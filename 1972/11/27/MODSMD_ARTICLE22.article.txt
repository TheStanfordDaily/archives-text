THE STANFORD WOMAN IN 1972
A survey of the senior class of 1972 shows that the
Stanford undergraduate woman has changed remarkably
over the past five years.' She no longer accepts the
traditional roles which society has assigned to her as a
member of the female sex. Graduating men and women
seniors have very similar educational and occupational
aspirations. There is little difference between the propor
tions of women and men who plan to become profes
sionals: doctors, lawyers, college professors, and scien
tists. And the same proportions of men and women plan
to go on for graduate study.
Sex discrimination occurs at Stanford but its inci
dence is limited. Almost one-fourth the graduating seni
or women say they were discouraged from some goal by
sex discrimination while they were at Stanford. And
changes between major fields can to some extent be
predicted by the sex of the student and the traditional
sexual composition of the majors.
This report presents the results of a survey of Stan
ford seniors and makes recommendations on how the
University can end discrimination and provide more op
portunities for women. The first section of the report
considers the educational and occupational plans of men
and women undergraduates in 1972 and in 1965. The
second section concerns sex-role expectations and the
Stanford environment. It discusses women's experiences
of discrimination at Stanford, and the pattern of choos
ing majors which perpetuates the existence of predomi
nantly male fields. The third section discusses the effects
of academic and occupation counselling at Stanford. The
Committee's recommendations are summarized at the
end of the report.
The data presented in this report is the result of a
survey of 280 graduating seniors conducted in the Spring
of 1972. The questionnaire, "A Survey of Major and
Occupational Choice," was designed to find out what
fields Stanford undergraduates choose for their studies
and future jobs, and how the University environment
influences their choices. Recipients of the questionnaire
were randomly chosen in groups by sex and the aca
demic field in which they were interested when they
entered Stanford. Data presented here has been weighted
to be representative of the whole graduating class, unless
otherwise indicated. 136 men and 144 women respon
ded to the mailed questionnaire, giving a response rate of
79%. The questionnaire and a discussion of research
procedures are presented in the Appendix.
I. THE NEW STANFORD WOMAN
Occupational Plans of the Class of 1972
Perhaps the most significant finding of the survey of
major and occupational choice is the similarity of the
plans of men and women students. In the past it was
assumed that most Stanford men would become profes
sionals or businessmen while Stanford women would
become housewives, school teachers, and secretaries.
This stereotype used to approximate reality. It is no
longer valid.
In the Stanford class of 1972, a similar proportion of
men and women plan to enter major professions. 69% of
the men and 53% of the women who have a single
definite long-range plan say they will become doctors,
lawyers, college professors and scientists. When this is
generalized to the entire class, (including those who have
vague plans or more than one plan), 28% of senior
women and 30% of senior men are definitely planning to
enter a major profession.
The following table shows the responses of those who
said they had definite long-range occupational plans.
Data representing the plans of the whole population,
including those who are uncertain, shows a very similar
pattern.

It is apparent that the occupational choices of Stan
ford women do not fit into sexual stereotypes. Informa
tion on all the occupations which students considered at
Stanford shows that the women respondents began with
more traditional ideas as freshmen and moved away
from traditional considerations during their time at the
University.
Women and men not only have very similar occupa
tional plans, they also seem to have the same level of
commitment to their occupations and the same expecta
tions of success. As a measure of the seriousness of
occupational intent, students were asked how they had
prepared for their planned future occupations. The same
proportion of women and men said that they had pre
pared themselves by such activities as talking to individ
uals in the occupation, acquiring needed credentials or
training, and finding employment.
Expectations of success were measured by asking
students what ideally would be their occupation or main
activity in five years and what, realistically, they thought

they would be doing. Most students said they would
probably be engaged in their ideal occupations, (71% of
the men and 58% of the women). While fewer women
than men believe they will be engaged in their ideal
occupations, no more women than men think they will
be engaged in lower status occupations. Of those who do
not believe they will be engaged in their ideal occupa
tions, 26% of the men and 28% of the women said they
would probably be engaged in an occupation that vns
lower status than their ideal occupation.
The three most frequently mentioned ideal occupa
tions were medicine, law, and college educator-scientist.

As Table 2 shows, virtually all of the men and women
that aspire to these professions expect to reach their
goals, with the single exception of women who would
like to be college professors or scientists. 12% of the
women hold this ideal but only 7% believe they can
realistically attain it. This is by far the biggest gap
between ideal and realistic assessments for any sex or
occupation. It is interesting that women students have
the least confidence about the occupation to which they
have had the most exposure at Stanford: college profes
sor.
Educational Plans of the Class of 1972
The educational plans of graduating men and women
students are also quite similar. Just as many men as
women plan to go on for further education at some
point in the future, as Table 3 shows.

TABLE 3

7c Having definite educational plans 84.5 81.3
% Having uncertain educational plans 4.4 8.5

N=l33 N=l44

Approximately the same proportion of men and
women are also going on for graduate study in the next
six months, (54 percent of the men and 49 percent of
the women).
Doctoral and professional programs have traditionally
been filled with men, while women have tended to enter
masters programs. This trend is still apparent with this
year's Stanford graduates, but the gap is closing. 52% of
the women and 74% of the men who said they were
going on for further education are planning to get a
doctorate, or a degree in law or medicine. 41% of the
women and 23% of the men are getting Masters degrees.
The remaining students will be getting technical licenses,
professional B.A.s or certificates of some kind.
A Comparison of Senior Women in 1965 and 1972
The plans of graduating Stanford women have
changed dramatically in the past few years. Data gather
ed on the Class of 1965 by the Institute for the Study of
Human Problems shows striking differences from the
Class of 1972. In "Career and Autonomy in College
Women," Joseph Katz draws the following conclusion:
.. .even in as academically able a group of students
as the Stanford women, the orientation toward
occupational roles is a very "traditional" one, even
though, as we will later see, there is a high valua
tion of the occupational life. .. .the women are
oriented towards family and their biggest occupa
tional aspiration is elementary and secondary
school teaching.
Similar findings have been reported by many other stud
ies of the occupational plans of women students in the
1950s and the early 1960s.
The following table compares the occupational plans
of women graduating in 1965 and 1972, and shows how
much Stanford undergraduates have changed in the past
7 years. The data for the two time periods are not
completely comparable, since different research pro
cedures were used in the two studies. However, the
comparisons between men and women within each time
period are valid.
The table shows a dramatic rise in the proportion of
women interested in the professions, and a sharp de
crease in the proportion who intend to be teachers.
These changes are clear, even though the 1972 data
represents women's most pessimistic estimates of their
future occupations, i.e., their realistic assessments of
what they would be doing in five years, as opposed to
their occupational plans.

In 1965, the ratio of men to women planning to
♦enter professions was 6to 1; in 1972 the ratio is 1.6 to
1. The proportion of women planning to enter elemen
tary and secondary education has decreased from 36% to
10% and the same proportion of men and women now
plan to enter business.
Stanford women have changed their conceptions of
their marital and childbearing roles, as well as their
occupational and education plans. Katz's respondents
were acutely aware of their future roles as wives and
mothers, and most assumed that their occupational goals
would be secondary to their duties to their husbands and
children. 70% of these women said they would not work
at all when their children were under 6 years old, and
only 43% intended to work full time when their children
were over 12 years of age.
Stanford women no longer think along these lines.
The 1972 respondents were not asked directly about
their plans for marriage and childrearing, but the women
were given ample opportunity to mention the future role
of wife and mother. Few women ever mentioned the
topic.
In one series of questions, we asked women what
they were planning to do after graduation, and how long
they planned to continue in that activity. Traditional
patterns led us to expect that a significant proportion of
the women would say they planned to work either until
they had put their husbands through school, or until it
was time to raise children. Only 3% of the women
who were leaving college to work said they would stop
when their husbands had finished school, and only 7%
said they would stop to raise children. Traditional role
expectations still exist at Stanford, but they are the
exception rather than the rule.
This conclusion is also supported by their responses
about "ideal" and "real" future activities. Only 3% of
the women said that, ideally, they would be housewives
in five years and an additional .4% thought that real
istically they would be housewives at that time. In five
years, most of these women will be 26 or 27 years old,
an age at which, in the past, a majority of women
already have small children. However, only 15% of the
women said that they realistically expected childraising
and housework to be a major activity, in addition to
some kind of employment. In all, only 18.5% of the
women mentioned the role of wife and mother as part of
their main activities in the next 5 years.
In sum, the data show that Stanford women have
broken away from traditional stereotypes about "the
woman's role" in the last seven years. Women and men
now have very similar occupational and educational
plans. Women no longer seem to regard a job as "some
thing to fall back on." They take their plans seriously,
and they expect to succeed.
Policy Implications
1. It is important that all members of the Stanford
community — administrators, professors, advisers, and
counsellors — understand the new aspirations of women
undergraduates. The best cure for sex-role stereotypes is
information. For this reason, the findings of this study
should be publicized as widely as possible. We recom
mend that the Dean of Undergraduate Studies and the
Provost take steps to ensure that the findings of this
study are communicated to all professors, advisers,
counsellors and administrators, especially those who
have extensive contact with undergraduates.
2. Stanford University as an institution employing over
7,000 men and women is responsible for setting an
example by eliminating all discriminatory hiring and
promotional practices. The administration should con
tinue to give high priority to its affirmative action ef
forts, and to publicize them as widely as possible.
11. SEX ROLE EXPECTATIONS AND THE STAN
FORD ENVIRONMENT
Knowing that Stanford men and women share sub
stantially the same aspirations, it is important to ask
whether Stanford's treatment of its students is consis
tent with these aspirations. Are Stanford women dis
couraged from entering traditionally male fields and
seeking careers in predominantly male areas? Are they
encouraged to be housewives and school teachers, when
many would prefer to be doctors and professors?
By and large, the answer to these questions appears to
be no. Most women do not believe that they encounter
ed discrimination while they were at Stanford, but a
significant number of Stanford women have been in
fluenced to limit their educational and occupational
choices because of their sex. Most departments and
professors do not discriminate against women; but some
do.
Experience with Discrimination
When asked, "do you feel you have been discouraged
from any academic or occupational goals by a member
of the Stanford community because of your sex?" 29 of
the 128 women who responded said yes. This generalizes
to 23% of all Stanford women. Another 5% of the
women experienced discrimination but were not dis
couraged by it. Most of these women were discouraged
by contacts with faculty members.

In all, almost one-quarter of Stanford women are
discouraged by discrimination. The forms which this
discrimination takes range from explicit discouragement
from a professor to more subtle environmental cues. The
observations of some of the women respondents illus
trate this quite clearly. The following quotations drawn
from survey responses illustrate overt discouragement of
women by their advisers:
Dr. X, a pre-med adviser, had a dim view of the
possibility of women actually making it through
all the work necessary to be a doctor, and later of
her juggling work, children, etc. .. .There were 2
other girls in our advisee group. He said he didn 't
expect to see us the next year.. . .
Not only my major adviser, but several of my
professors in my department failed to offer any
encouragement or assistance and in some cases
actively discouraged me from further study in
mathematics - both when I sought advice and
approval for advanced study and when I sought
assistance and consultation in courses I was taking.
A largely negative reaction (at best, I was ignored)
from male peers in math and science classes was
also quite evident.
My history adviser specifically discouraged me
from going on to grad school. He kept suggesting
high school teaching as "more flexible for a
woman." And he did this even after I took several
courses from him in which I did very well. He even
urged me to take on the honors thesis program.
Other women described comments made by professors
during lectures as a source of discouragement:
I took a class in (chemistry) from Dr. X - a
required course for many med schools. He began
his first lecture by saying there were 2 things he
couldn 't stand — premeds and women who
thought they could be scientists. His actions were
consistent with his prejudices.
One art teacher, XX, believes that women make
better art teachers than artists - his suggestions to
this effect have been to classes as a whole, not to
me individually, but I think that his underlying
sexism affects his relationship with me although he
shows a respect for my work.
Some women found assessments of the employment
situation for women in some fields more discouraging
than helpful:
I have been told of personal experience of the bias
against women in university level teaching. I would
not seek employment as a member of an academic
community (university).
. . .advisers have given me "realistic appraisals
which were very discouraging.
Finally, some women did not describe a direct communi
cation at all, but a sense they had from what was around
them:
It's difficult to be specific - one carries with him
the prejudices; I wish now I had gone pre-med; I
would like to be a doctor but women weren't
doctors; and women didn't go on to be English
professors - I didn 7 look much beyond teaching
- and no one suggested anything else.
Though discouragement has not been overt (ex
cept in a couple of cases where people couldn't
understand why I couldn't be happy teaching in
high school) there is a lot of subtle discourage
ment. 1) The lack of female professors which
really presents a problem in terms of role identity,
2) the number of professors that give only a nega
tive account of their role (Idon't understand why
they're still in it), 3) a disbelief, from both profes
sors and students, that I can combine being a
woman with being a professor, 4) the way I see
female professors now being treated (i.e. difficulty
in obtaining tenure, refusal to see their courses as
anything but "fun" (both professors and stu
dents), insinuations about their teaching ability
and/or intelligence related to sex, etc.).
Policy Implications
Overt discouragement of women wishing to enter
"male" fields and professions should not exist at Stan
ford in 1972. To counter such sexism when it results
from ignorance, an effort should be made to increase
awareness of the fact that women are capable of doing
"male jobs" and succeeding in "male fields," and that
many women do successfully combine professional and
childrearing responsibilities. Any professor or counsellor
who continues to discourage women students because of
their sex should not be asked to advise them. We recom
mend that the Dean of Undergraduate Studies develop a
list of advisers that are particularly interested in working
with women undergraduates. Students should be in
formed that they have the option of choosing someone
from this list to replace their current adviser. In addi
tion, the Dean of Undergraduate Studies should consider
developing procedures by which students can register
complaints if they experience discrimination from their
adviser.
111. CHOICE OF MAJORS
Just as some occupations are usually seen as "men's
jobs" and others as "women's jobs," so some academic
fields are seen as primarily "male" or "female." The
traditional perceptions of appropriate fields for men and
women closely fit the actual proportions of each sex
majoring in these fields at Stanford today. The science
fields have few women, the humanities many more than
their share. Students' changes between majors were
assessed in order to find out if this distribution was due
to interests and orientations acquired before students
entered Stanford, or if the Stanford environment was in
some way encouraging sex-typed choices of major fields.
The results show that students do tend to move into
fields dominated by their own sex while they are at
Stanford. Women more than men switch out of fields
such as Political Science and into fields like English and
Music. More men than women move into fields which
already have a large number of men and out of fields
with a larger proportion s of women. While students are
breaking traditiojn in their careqr N choices, they are per
petuating the, sex-typing of majoi; fields.
. ' \ v v • \ \ \ r •. * > *
of switching between majors, fields
were categorized as cither maje-dominated or non-male
dominated. All fields having less than 25% wom'en'were
, male-dominated, rest,, non-male-dominated.
(j3)S% of, Stanford undergraduates are women.) Male
dominated fields were further divided into science and
non-science fields. Students were asked about the field
ip vyhich' they expressed'an interest time they
were accepted to Stanfo'rd, (referred to as'their
man field of interest"), their first major, and the'major
with which they graduated.
Tn Ihe male-domma'ted sbifcnce fields, Stanford stu
dents appear to bring th v eir sex role stereotypes with
them.'Many mo're freshmen men. than women are inter
ested in these fields; but there is no change towards
greater sexvtyped choice between the freshman and
senior year. "Science fields, retain and attract an equal
proportion of men and women majors.
The fields where Stanford students increasingly make
their choices in terms of sex role stereotypes are the
male dominated, nonscience fields: economics, history,
political science, philosophy, architecture and urban de
sign. Of those students who were interested in these
fields as freshmen, more men than women remained in
these fields until they graduated (60% vs. 53%). More
over, in recruiting new majors, these fields attract many
more men than women. Nonscience male-dominated
fields attract 45% of the men who come to Stanford
interested in non-male-dominated fields, and only 10%
of the women.
Students who come to Stanford without a clear field
of interest seem to be most influenced by pressures to
select a field that is "appropriate" for their sex. The
students who said they were considering both a male
dominated and a non-male-dominated field when they
were accepted to Stanford showed almost no sex-typed
switching. (3% of all freshmen men and 7% of all fresh
men women were in this category.) On the other hand,
the final majors of those who were undecided as entering
freshmen and were not interested in any particular field,
can be almost entirely predicted by sex-typing. 79% of
these men graduated in male-dominated fields, 21% in
non-male-dominated fields. 27% of the undecided
women graduated in male-dominated fields, and 70% in
non-male-dominated fields. (20% of freshmen women
and 26% of freshmen men were undecided.)
The fact that students who come to Stanford with no
idea of what they want to do show the most sex-typed
behavior would seem to indicate that the University
environment influences students to make this kind of
choice. However, when students were asked why they
made the choices they did, such pressures from the
University were not evident. Women were not advised to
shift out of male-dominated fields any more often than
they were encouraged to shift into them. They did not
respond that experienced or anticipated discrimination
was a reason for such shifts, nor did they feel less
capable of succeeding in male-dominated fields. The
reasons which women give for changing majors do not
explain the pattern of sex-typed switching.
Most of the women's sex-typed switching occurred
between the time of their acceptance to Stanford and
•the time they declared their first major (by the end of
their sophomore years). This tendency for sex-typed
major choice to be more frequent in the freshman and
sophomore years has two possible explanations. Stu
dents may act more traditionally when they are younger
or sex-role stereotypes may have been more dominant at
Stanford three and four years ago.
i
Plans for graduate study also show some of the sex
typing. While more students plan graduate study in male

dominated than in non-male-dominated fields, in gen
eral, twice as many men as women do so. 45% of t,he
women and 86% of-the men with definite educational
i plaas, are going on in male-dominpted fields. , , \

Policy Implications ■ > < '. i i i - ! . . •< •„>
The overwhelming predominance' of men iri certain
social science and humanities fields is perpetuated as
women tend to avoid and leave these fields while thtfy
are at Stanford. These departments -*■ economics, his
tory, philosophy, political science, architecture and
urban design — should investigate this situation, looking,
in particular, at their introductory classes. The sciences,
which attract few women students, seem to be dealing
with a phenomenon inherited from the high schools. All
departments with few women majors should make an
effort to attract them. One obvious step in this direction
is to increase the number of women teaching in these
fields.
We recommend that departments with fewer than
25% women majors should experiment with ways of
attracting more women majors (such as distributing writ
ten materials through the Academic Information Center
or encouraging current women majors to discuss the
department's program with other women). These depart
ments should also determine the proportion of women
undergraduates that join and leave their undergraduate
program. Departments may wish to confer with the
Committee on the Employment and Education of
Women about methods for recruiting women, and they
should report their progress to the Committee by the
end of Spring Quarter, 1973.
IV. ACADEMIC AND OCCUPATIONAL COUNSEL
LING
The survey shows that many students find Stanford

services helpful at some point in their undergraduate
careers, but very few feel that Stanford's advisers or
counsellors have affected their occupational plans. Stu
dents were asked specifically about their contacts with
their freshman advisers, academic advisers, and career
counsellors in the placement center. Only a small pro
portion felt that these people had had any effect on
their occupational plans.

Advising and Sex-Roles
One question asked of the data was whether or not
men and womcjri were advised to chodsb fields "appro
priate to their'sex. In only one'case did this trend seem
apparept. There is some indication that the advice of
freshmen advisers reflected sex-role stereotypes. 4 of the
5 students who said they were discouraged by their
freshmen advisers were women and all of the women
were discouraged in male fields. This bias did not appear
ill responses about academic advisers and career counsel
lors. Studtnis tvere' also -asked about' the nature of the
boMattis'with their advisers which affected therin occupa
tional considerations. It is significant that one-quarter of
HHe wtlrti&n 1 whose occupational plans had b&eivaffected
■by l e!dritkets with ah advis'er or counsellor said that the
tridifttibaP hdd disdissed se* discrimination in the area
CoiTside'rihg.' Advisers are most influential as
fol£ rhollels. WhCri students were risked to "check the
statements' which; you feel accurately describe the nature
of 1 the contacts With your'freshman, adviser which affec
ted! ybur occupational consideration,"' the most fre
quently checked response was "Adviser acted as a posi
tive example of Individual in field." "Adviser acted as 1 a
negative example of individual in field" was also checked
frequently, and woijien students found advisers
equally important as role models. It is important to
note, however, that the large majority of these advisers
are men.
Suggestions for Improvements
Students were asked to respond to two open ended
questions about Stanford services: "What services that
Stanford now offers, if any, have been helpful to you in
planning your future:" and "What services which are not
now offered would you find helpful:" 60% of the 136
men answering the questionnaire and 54% of the 144
women mentioned some service at Stanford which had
been helpful to them. (These percentages refer to pro
portion of respondents. They have not been weighted to
represent the whole class.) Those services mentioned
most frequently were the Academic Information Center,
(41 times), the Career Counselling and Placement Cen
ter, (39 times), and the pre-med advising services, (18
times). 51 men and 61 women suggested improvements
in Stanford services. The most frequent target of sugges
tions were the departments, especially among women.
32 women and 15 men said that departments should be
more helpful in planning their futures. Helping students
plan their futures would be a new role for departments.
Only 11 students said their departments had actually
been helpful while they were at Stanford, and most of

the praise resulted from opportunities for practical ex
perience in their fields, not from advice or information
they had received.
Generally, students said they would have liked more
informal, personal contacts with professors, counsellors,
and people in the fields they are considering to give
them a better sense of what they wanted to do in the
future. One student suggested:

a broad, coordinated counselling service, with
competent people who can talk meaningfully
about a variety of occupations and lifestyles those
occupations shape. (Not just an engineering coun
sellor for engineering, an econ adviser for econ,
etc.)

Departments were suggested as an alternative source of
information about the employment possibilities stem
ming from a field of study.
A larger proportion of women than men students
have immediate need of career counselling and place
ment services. More of the women are planning to get a
full-time job as soon as they leave Stanford. 29% of the
women and 18% of the men said they expected to be
working full-time in the six months after graduation.
Women also seem to need more help in finding jobs. 26%
of the women who were planning to work full-time after
graduation have already looked for jobs in the area in
which they wanted to work, and only 7% had found
jobs. 18% of the men had looked for employment, and
11% had found jobs. Therefore, it is particularly im
portant for women students that occupational counsel
ling services be improved.
Policy Implications
1. The Career Planning and Placement Center should
make a special effort to help women plan their careers
and find jobs. Since a large number of women are trying
to find jobs in areas where few women have been hired
before, the Placement Center should make aggressive
efforts to place these women.
We recommend that the Career Planning and Place
ment Center report on what activities and what addi
tional staff are required in order to provide better service
to women undergraduates.
2. Women should be prepared to cope with discrimina
tion when they encounter it. We recommend that legal
and practical counselling about dealing with discrimina
tion be made available at the Placement Center.
3. Major department should be involved in occupation
counselling efforts. The experience and contacts of Stan
ford professors remain a largely untapped resource. As
some students suggested, departments should institute
programs in conjunction with the Career Planning and
Placement Center which offer an overview of the occu
pations open to men and women with training in differ
ent academic fields. Women should be well represented
in all such programs.
Wc recommend that each department provide a pro
gram of occupational counselling for its men and women
majors, either on its own or in conjunction with the
Career Planning and Placement Center.
4. Our data shows that advisers and counsellors current
ly discuss the problem of discrimination with their
women students. As several students suggested, this kind
of discussion can often be more discouraging than help
ful. Stanford advisers and counsellors need to be sensi
tive to the fine line between a fatalistic discussion of
discrimination and one that prepares women to meet the
difficulties they will encounter with determination in
stead of with surprise.
We recommend that the Dean of Students Office
develop written material and discussion sessions for ad
visers and counsellors that will orient them to the special
needs of women students.
5. Role modeling is an important function of Stanford
advisers. Yet most Stanford professors are men. There
fore. students have few opportunities to meet successful
professional women and to observe alternative ap
proaches to being a working woman or a working
mother. We recommend that the Dean of Students en
courage the participation of professional women in Uni
versity public functions and in activities at University
residences, until there are more women on the faculty.

mittee on the Education and Employment of Women in
the University.

THE STANFORD WOMAN IN 1972
A survey of the senior class of 1972 shows that the
Stanford undergraduate woman has changed remarkably
over the past five years.' She no longer accepts the
traditional roles which society has assigned to her as a
member of the female sex. Graduating men and women
seniors have very similar educational and occupational
aspirations. There is little difference between the propor
tions of women and men who plan to become profes
sionals: doctors, lawyers, college professors, and scien
tists. And the same proportions of men and women plan
to go on for graduate study.
Sex discrimination occurs at Stanford but its inci
dence is limited. Almost one-fourth the graduating seni
or women say they were discouraged from some goal by
sex discrimination while they were at Stanford. And
changes between major fields can to some extent be
predicted by the sex of the student and the traditional
sexual composition of the majors.
This report presents the results of a survey of Stan
ford seniors and makes recommendations on how the
University can end discrimination and provide more op
portunities for women. The first section of the report
considers the educational and occupational plans of men
and women undergraduates in 1972 and in 1965. The
second section concerns sex-role expectations and the
Stanford environment. It discusses women's experiences
of discrimination at Stanford, and the pattern of choos
ing majors which perpetuates the existence of predomi
nantly male fields. The third section discusses the effects
of academic and occupation counselling at Stanford. The
Committee's recommendations are summarized at the
end of the report.
The data presented in this report is the result of a
survey of 280 graduating seniors conducted in the Spring
of 1972. The questionnaire, "A Survey of Major and
Occupational Choice," was designed to find out what
fields Stanford undergraduates choose for their studies
and future jobs, and how the University environment
influences their choices. Recipients of the questionnaire
were randomly chosen in groups by sex and the aca
demic field in which they were interested when they
entered Stanford. Data presented here has been weighted
to be representative of the whole graduating class, unless
otherwise indicated. 136 men and 144 women respon
ded to the mailed questionnaire, giving a response rate of
79%. The questionnaire and a discussion of research
procedures are presented in the Appendix.
I. THE NEW STANFORD WOMAN
Occupational Plans of the Class of 1972
Perhaps the most significant finding of the survey of
major and occupational choice is the similarity of the
plans of men and women students. In the past it was
assumed that most Stanford men would become profes
sionals or businessmen while Stanford women would
become housewives, school teachers, and secretaries.
This stereotype used to approximate reality. It is no
longer valid.
In the Stanford class of 1972, a similar proportion of
men and women plan to enter major professions. 69% of
the men and 53% of the women who have a single
definite long-range plan say they will become doctors,
lawyers, college professors and scientists. When this is
generalized to the entire class, (including those who have
vague plans or more than one plan), 28% of senior
women and 30% of senior men are definitely planning to
enter a major profession.
The following table shows the responses of those who
said they had definite long-range occupational plans.
Data representing the plans of the whole population,
including those who are uncertain, shows a very similar
pattern.

N=6B N=B4

It is apparent that the occupational choices of Stan
ford women do not fit into sexual stereotypes. Informa
tion on all the occupations which students considered at
Stanford shows that the women respondents began with
more traditional ideas as freshmen and moved away
from traditional considerations during their time at the
University.
Women and men not only have very similar occupa
tional plans, they also seem to have the same level of
commitment to their occupations and the same expecta
tions of success. As a measure of the seriousness of
occupational intent, students were asked how they had
prepared for their planned future occupations. The same
proportion of women and men said that they had pre
pared themselves by such activities as talking to individ
uals in the occupation, acquiring needed credentials or
training, and finding employment.
Expectations of success were measured by asking
students what ideally would be their occupation or main
activity in five years and what, realistically, they thought

they would be doing. Most students said they would
probably be engaged in their ideal occupations, (71% of
the men and 58% of the women). While fewer women
than men believe they will be engaged in their ideal
occupations, no more women than men think they will
be engaged in lower status occupations. Of those who do
not believe they will be engaged in their ideal occupa
tions, 26% of the men and 28% of the women said they
would probably be engaged in an occupation that vns
lower status than their ideal occupation.
The three most frequently mentioned ideal occupa
tions were medicine, law, and college educator-scientist.

Medical professions 20 22 18 19
Legal professions 15 15 7 7

N=loB N=l2s

As Table 2 shows, virtually all of the men and women
that aspire to these professions expect to reach their
goals, with the single exception of women who would
like to be college professors or scientists. 12% of the
women hold this ideal but only 7% believe they can
realistically attain it. This is by far the biggest gap
between ideal and realistic assessments for any sex or
occupation. It is interesting that women students have
the least confidence about the occupation to which they
have had the most exposure at Stanford: college profes
sor.
Educational Plans of the Class of 1972
The educational plans of graduating men and women
students are also quite similar. Just as many men as
women plan to go on for further education at some
point in the future, as Table 3 shows.

TABLE 3
Male Female
7c Having definite educational plans 84.5 81.3
% Having uncertain educational plans 4.4 8.5

N=l33 N=l44

Approximately the same proportion of men and
women are also going on for graduate study in the next
six months, (54 percent of the men and 49 percent of
the women).
Doctoral and professional programs have traditionally
been filled with men, while women have tended to enter
masters programs. This trend is still apparent with this
year's Stanford graduates, but the gap is closing. 52% of
the women and 74% of the men who said they were
going on for further education are planning to get a
doctorate, or a degree in law or medicine. 41% of the
women and 23% of the men are getting Masters degrees.
The remaining students will be getting technical licenses,
professional B.A.s or certificates of some kind.
A Comparison of Senior Women in 1965 and 1972
The plans of graduating Stanford women have
changed dramatically in the past few years. Data gather
ed on the Class of 1965 by the Institute for the Study of
Human Problems shows striking differences from the
Class of 1972. In "Career and Autonomy in College
Women," Joseph Katz draws the following conclusion:
.. .even in as academically able a group of students
as the Stanford women, the orientation toward
occupational roles is a very "traditional" one, even
though, as we will later see, there is a high valua
tion of the occupational life. .. .the women are
oriented towards family and their biggest occupa
tional aspiration is elementary and secondary
school teaching.
Similar findings have been reported by many other stud
ies of the occupational plans of women students in the
1950s and the early 1960s.
The following table compares the occupational plans
of women graduating in 1965 and 1972, and shows how
much Stanford undergraduates have changed in the past
7 years. The data for the two time periods are not
completely comparable, since different research pro
cedures were used in the two studies. However, the
comparisons between men and women within each time
period are valid.
The table shows a dramatic rise in the proportion of
women interested in the professions, and a sharp de
crease in the proportion who intend to be teachers.
These changes are clear, even though the 1972 data
represents women's most pessimistic estimates of their
future occupations, i.e., their realistic assessments of
what they would be doing in five years, as opposed to
their occupational plans.

In 1965, the ratio of men to women planning to
♦enter professions was 6to 1; in 1972 the ratio is 1.6 to
1. The proportion of women planning to enter elemen
tary and secondary education has decreased from 36% to
10% and the same proportion of men and women now
plan to enter business.
Stanford women have changed their conceptions of
their marital and childbearing roles, as well as their
occupational and education plans. Katz's respondents
were acutely aware of their future roles as wives and
mothers, and most assumed that their occupational goals
would be secondary to their duties to their husbands and
children. 70% of these women said they would not work
at all when their children were under 6 years old, and
only 43% intended to work full time when their children
were over 12 years of age.
Stanford women no longer think along these lines.
The 1972 respondents were not asked directly about
their plans for marriage and childrearing, but the women
were given ample opportunity to mention the future role
of wife and mother. Few women ever mentioned the
topic.
In one series of questions, we asked women what
they were planning to do after graduation, and how long
they planned to continue in that activity. Traditional
patterns led us to expect that a significant proportion of
the women would say they planned to work either until
they had put their husbands through school, or until it
was time to raise children. Only 3% of the women
who were leaving college to work said they would stop
when their husbands had finished school, and only 7%
said they would stop to raise children. Traditional role
expectations still exist at Stanford, but they are the
exception rather than the rule.
This conclusion is also supported by their responses
about "ideal" and "real" future activities. Only 3% of
the women said that, ideally, they would be housewives
in five years and an additional .4% thought that real
istically they would be housewives at that time. In five
years, most of these women will be 26 or 27 years old,
an age at which, in the past, a majority of women
already have small children. However, only 15% of the
women said that they realistically expected childraising
and housework to be a major activity, in addition to
some kind of employment. In all, only 18.5% of the
women mentioned the role of wife and mother as part of
their main activities in the next 5 years.
In sum, the data show that Stanford women have
broken away from traditional stereotypes about "the
woman's role" in the last seven years. Women and men
now have very similar occupational and educational
plans. Women no longer seem to regard a job as "some
thing to fall back on." They take their plans seriously,
and they expect to succeed.
Policy Implications
1. It is important that all members of the Stanford
community — administrators, professors, advisers, and
counsellors — understand the new aspirations of women
undergraduates. The best cure for sex-role stereotypes is
information. For this reason, the findings of this study
should be publicized as widely as possible. We recom
mend that the Dean of Undergraduate Studies and the
Provost take steps to ensure that the findings of this
study are communicated to all professors, advisers,
counsellors and administrators, especially those who
have extensive contact with undergraduates.
2. Stanford University as an institution employing over
7,000 men and women is responsible for setting an
example by eliminating all discriminatory hiring and
promotional practices. The administration should con
tinue to give high priority to its affirmative action ef
forts, and to publicize them as widely as possible.
11. SEX ROLE EXPECTATIONS AND THE STAN
FORD ENVIRONMENT
Knowing that Stanford men and women share sub
stantially the same aspirations, it is important to ask
whether Stanford's treatment of its students is consis
tent with these aspirations. Are Stanford women dis
couraged from entering traditionally male fields and
seeking careers in predominantly male areas? Are they
encouraged to be housewives and school teachers, when
many would prefer to be doctors and professors?
By and large, the answer to these questions appears to
be no. Most women do not believe that they encounter
ed discrimination while they were at Stanford, but a
significant number of Stanford women have been in
fluenced to limit their educational and occupational
choices because of their sex. Most departments and
professors do not discriminate against women; but some
do.
Experience with Discrimination
When asked, "do you feel you have been discouraged
from any academic or occupational goals by a member
of the Stanford community because of your sex?" 29 of
the 128 women who responded said yes. This generalizes
to 23% of all Stanford women. Another 5% of the
women experienced discrimination but were not dis
couraged by it. Most of these women were discouraged
by contacts with faculty members.

In all, almost one-quarter of Stanford women are
discouraged by discrimination. The forms which this
discrimination takes range from explicit discouragement
from a professor to more subtle environmental cues. The
observations of some of the women respondents illus
trate this quite clearly. The following quotations drawn
from survey responses illustrate overt discouragement of
women by their advisers:
Dr. X, a pre-med adviser, had a dim view of the
possibility of women actually making it through
all the work necessary to be a doctor, and later of
her juggling work, children, etc. .. .There were 2
other girls in our advisee group. He said he didn 't
expect to see us the next year.. . .
Not only my major adviser, but several of my
professors in my department failed to offer any
encouragement or assistance and in some cases
actively discouraged me from further study in
mathematics - both when I sought advice and
approval for advanced study and when I sought
assistance and consultation in courses I was taking.
A largely negative reaction (at best, I was ignored)
from male peers in math and science classes was
also quite evident.
My history adviser specifically discouraged me
from going on to grad school. He kept suggesting
high school teaching as "more flexible for a
woman." And he did this even after I took several
courses from him in which I did very well. He even
urged me to take on the honors thesis program.
Other women described comments made by professors
during lectures as a source of discouragement:
I took a class in (chemistry) from Dr. X - a
required course for many med schools. He began
his first lecture by saying there were 2 things he
couldn 't stand — premeds and women who
thought they could be scientists. His actions were
consistent with his prejudices.
One art teacher, XX, believes that women make
better art teachers than artists - his suggestions to
this effect have been to classes as a whole, not to
me individually, but I think that his underlying
sexism affects his relationship with me although he
shows a respect for my work.
Some women found assessments of the employment
situation for women in some fields more discouraging
than helpful:
I have been told of personal experience of the bias
against women in university level teaching. I would
not seek employment as a member of an academic
community (university).
. . .advisers have given me "realistic appraisals
which were very discouraging.
Finally, some women did not describe a direct communi
cation at all, but a sense they had from what was around
them:
It's difficult to be specific - one carries with him
the prejudices; I wish now I had gone pre-med; I
would like to be a doctor but women weren't
doctors; and women didn't go on to be English
professors - I didn 7 look much beyond teaching
- and no one suggested anything else.
Though discouragement has not been overt (ex
cept in a couple of cases where people couldn't
understand why I couldn't be happy teaching in
high school) there is a lot of subtle discourage
ment. 1) The lack of female professors which
really presents a problem in terms of role identity,
2) the number of professors that give only a nega
tive account of their role (Idon't understand why
they're still in it), 3) a disbelief, from both profes
sors and students, that I can combine being a
woman with being a professor, 4) the way I see
female professors now being treated (i.e. difficulty
in obtaining tenure, refusal to see their courses as
anything but "fun" (both professors and stu
dents), insinuations about their teaching ability
and/or intelligence related to sex, etc.).
Policy Implications
Overt discouragement of women wishing to enter
"male" fields and professions should not exist at Stan
ford in 1972. To counter such sexism when it results
from ignorance, an effort should be made to increase
awareness of the fact that women are capable of doing
"male jobs" and succeeding in "male fields," and that
many women do successfully combine professional and
childrearing responsibilities. Any professor or counsellor
who continues to discourage women students because of
their sex should not be asked to advise them. We recom
mend that the Dean of Undergraduate Studies develop a
list of advisers that are particularly interested in working
with women undergraduates. Students should be in
formed that they have the option of choosing someone
from this list to replace their current adviser. In addi
tion, the Dean of Undergraduate Studies should consider
developing procedures by which students can register
complaints if they experience discrimination from their
adviser.
111. CHOICE OF MAJORS
Just as some occupations are usually seen as "men's
jobs" and others as "women's jobs," so some academic
fields are seen as primarily "male" or "female." The
traditional perceptions of appropriate fields for men and
women closely fit the actual proportions of each sex
majoring in these fields at Stanford today. The science
fields have few women, the humanities many more than
their share. Students' changes between majors were
assessed in order to find out if this distribution was due
to interests and orientations acquired before students
entered Stanford, or if the Stanford environment was in
some way encouraging sex-typed choices of major fields.
The results show that students do tend to move into
fields dominated by their own sex while they are at
Stanford. Women more than men switch out of fields
such as Political Science and into fields like English and
Music. More men than women move into fields which
already have a large number of men and out of fields
with a larger proportion s of women. While students are
breaking traditiojn in their careqr N choices, they are per
petuating the, sex-typing of majoi; fields.
. ' \ v v • \ \ \ r •. * > *
of switching between majors, fields
were categorized as cither maje-dominated or non-male
dominated. All fields having less than 25% wom'en'were
, male-dominated, rest,, non-male-dominated.
(j3)S% of, Stanford undergraduates are women.) Male
dominated fields were further divided into science and
non-science fields. Students were asked about the field
ip vyhich' they expressed'an interest time they
were accepted to Stanfo'rd, (referred to as'their
man field of interest"), their first major, and the'major
with which they graduated.
Tn Ihe male-domma'ted sbifcnce fields, Stanford stu
dents appear to bring th v eir sex role stereotypes with
them.'Many mo're freshmen men. than women are inter
ested in these fields; but there is no change towards
greater sexvtyped choice between the freshman and
senior year. "Science fields, retain and attract an equal
proportion of men and women majors.
The fields where Stanford students increasingly make
their choices in terms of sex role stereotypes are the
male dominated, nonscience fields: economics, history,
political science, philosophy, architecture and urban de
sign. Of those students who were interested in these
fields as freshmen, more men than women remained in
these fields until they graduated (60% vs. 53%). More
over, in recruiting new majors, these fields attract many
more men than women. Nonscience male-dominated
fields attract 45% of the men who come to Stanford
interested in non-male-dominated fields, and only 10%
of the women.
Students who come to Stanford without a clear field
of interest seem to be most influenced by pressures to
select a field that is "appropriate" for their sex. The
students who said they were considering both a male
dominated and a non-male-dominated field when they
were accepted to Stanford showed almost no sex-typed
switching. (3% of all freshmen men and 7% of all fresh
men women were in this category.) On the other hand,
the final majors of those who were undecided as entering
freshmen and were not interested in any particular field,
can be almost entirely predicted by sex-typing. 79% of
these men graduated in male-dominated fields, 21% in
non-male-dominated fields. 27% of the undecided
women graduated in male-dominated fields, and 70% in
non-male-dominated fields. (20% of freshmen women
and 26% of freshmen men were undecided.)
The fact that students who come to Stanford with no
idea of what they want to do show the most sex-typed
behavior would seem to indicate that the University
environment influences students to make this kind of
choice. However, when students were asked why they
made the choices they did, such pressures from the
University were not evident. Women were not advised to
shift out of male-dominated fields any more often than
they were encouraged to shift into them. They did not
respond that experienced or anticipated discrimination
was a reason for such shifts, nor did they feel less
capable of succeeding in male-dominated fields. The
reasons which women give for changing majors do not
explain the pattern of sex-typed switching.
Most of the women's sex-typed switching occurred
between the time of their acceptance to Stanford and
•the time they declared their first major (by the end of
their sophomore years). This tendency for sex-typed
major choice to be more frequent in the freshman and
sophomore years has two possible explanations. Stu
dents may act more traditionally when they are younger
or sex-role stereotypes may have been more dominant at
Stanford three and four years ago.
i
Plans for graduate study also show some of the sex
typing. While more students plan graduate study in male

dominated than in non-male-dominated fields, in gen
eral, twice as many men as women do so. 45% of t,he
women and 86% of-the men with definite educational
i plaas, are going on in male-dominpted fields. , , \

Policy Implications ■ > < '. i i i - ! . . •< •„>
The overwhelming predominance' of men iri certain
social science and humanities fields is perpetuated as
women tend to avoid and leave these fields while thtfy
are at Stanford. These departments -*■ economics, his
tory, philosophy, political science, architecture and
urban design — should investigate this situation, looking,
in particular, at their introductory classes. The sciences,
which attract few women students, seem to be dealing
with a phenomenon inherited from the high schools. All
departments with few women majors should make an
effort to attract them. One obvious step in this direction
is to increase the number of women teaching in these
fields.
We recommend that departments with fewer than
25% women majors should experiment with ways of
attracting more women majors (such as distributing writ
ten materials through the Academic Information Center
or encouraging current women majors to discuss the
department's program with other women). These depart
ments should also determine the proportion of women
undergraduates that join and leave their undergraduate
program. Departments may wish to confer with the
Committee on the Employment and Education of
Women about methods for recruiting women, and they
should report their progress to the Committee by the
end of Spring Quarter, 1973.
IV. ACADEMIC AND OCCUPATIONAL COUNSEL
LING
The survey shows that many students find Stanford

services helpful at some point in their undergraduate
careers, but very few feel that Stanford's advisers or
counsellors have affected their occupational plans. Stu
dents were asked specifically about their contacts with
their freshman advisers, academic advisers, and career
counsellors in the placement center. Only a small pro
portion felt that these people had had any effect on
their occupational plans.

Advising and Sex-Roles
One question asked of the data was whether or not
men and womcjri were advised to chodsb fields "appro
priate to their'sex. In only one'case did this trend seem
apparept. There is some indication that the advice of
freshmen advisers reflected sex-role stereotypes. 4 of the
5 students who said they were discouraged by their
freshmen advisers were women and all of the women
were discouraged in male fields. This bias did not appear
ill responses about academic advisers and career counsel
lors. Studtnis tvere' also -asked about' the nature of the
boMattis'with their advisers which affected therin occupa
tional considerations. It is significant that one-quarter of
HHe wtlrti&n 1 whose occupational plans had b&eivaffected
■by l e!dritkets with ah advis'er or counsellor said that the
tridifttibaP hdd disdissed se* discrimination in the area
CoiTside'rihg.' Advisers are most influential as
fol£ rhollels. WhCri students were risked to "check the
statements' which; you feel accurately describe the nature
of 1 the contacts With your'freshman, adviser which affec
ted! ybur occupational consideration,"' the most fre
quently checked response was "Adviser acted as a posi
tive example of Individual in field." "Adviser acted as 1 a
negative example of individual in field" was also checked
frequently, and woijien students found advisers
equally important as role models. It is important to
note, however, that the large majority of these advisers
are men.
Suggestions for Improvements
Students were asked to respond to two open ended
questions about Stanford services: "What services that
Stanford now offers, if any, have been helpful to you in
planning your future:" and "What services which are not
now offered would you find helpful:" 60% of the 136
men answering the questionnaire and 54% of the 144
women mentioned some service at Stanford which had
been helpful to them. (These percentages refer to pro
portion of respondents. They have not been weighted to
represent the whole class.) Those services mentioned
most frequently were the Academic Information Center,
(41 times), the Career Counselling and Placement Cen
ter, (39 times), and the pre-med advising services, (18
times). 51 men and 61 women suggested improvements
in Stanford services. The most frequent target of sugges
tions were the departments, especially among women.
32 women and 15 men said that departments should be
more helpful in planning their futures. Helping students
plan their futures would be a new role for departments.
Only 11 students said their departments had actually
been helpful while they were at Stanford, and most of

the praise resulted from opportunities for practical ex
perience in their fields, not from advice or information
they had received.
Generally, students said they would have liked more
informal, personal contacts with professors, counsellors,
and people in the fields they are considering to give
them a better sense of what they wanted to do in the
future. One student suggested:

a broad, coordinated counselling service, with
competent people who can talk meaningfully
about a variety of occupations and lifestyles those
occupations shape. (Not just an engineering coun
sellor for engineering, an econ adviser for econ,
etc.)
i>i 112 c / . ' ! ; i ) I
Departments were suggested as an alternative source of
information about the employment possibilities stem
ming from a field of study.
A larger proportion of women than men students
have immediate need of career counselling and place
ment services. More of the women are planning to get a
full-time job as soon as they leave Stanford. 29% of the
women and 18% of the men said they expected to be
working full-time in the six months after graduation.
Women also seem to need more help in finding jobs. 26%
of the women who were planning to work full-time after
graduation have already looked for jobs in the area in
which they wanted to work, and only 7% had found
jobs. 18% of the men had looked for employment, and
11% had found jobs. Therefore, it is particularly im
portant for women students that occupational counsel
ling services be improved.
Policy Implications
1. The Career Planning and Placement Center should
make a special effort to help women plan their careers
and find jobs. Since a large number of women are trying
to find jobs in areas where few women have been hired
before, the Placement Center should make aggressive
efforts to place these women.
We recommend that the Career Planning and Place
ment Center report on what activities and what addi
tional staff are required in order to provide better service
to women undergraduates.
2. Women should be prepared to cope with discrimina
tion when they encounter it. We recommend that legal
and practical counselling about dealing with discrimina
tion be made available at the Placement Center.
3. Major department should be involved in occupation
counselling efforts. The experience and contacts of Stan
ford professors remain a largely untapped resource. As
some students suggested, departments should institute
programs in conjunction with the Career Planning and
Placement Center which offer an overview of the occu
pations open to men and women with training in differ
ent academic fields. Women should be well represented
in all such programs.
Wc recommend that each department provide a pro
gram of occupational counselling for its men and women
majors, either on its own or in conjunction with the
Career Planning and Placement Center.
4. Our data shows that advisers and counsellors current
ly discuss the problem of discrimination with their
women students. As several students suggested, this kind
of discussion can often be more discouraging than help
ful. Stanford advisers and counsellors need to be sensi
tive to the fine line between a fatalistic discussion of
discrimination and one that prepares women to meet the
difficulties they will encounter with determination in
stead of with surprise.
We recommend that the Dean of Students Office
develop written material and discussion sessions for ad
visers and counsellors that will orient them to the special
needs of women students.
5. Role modeling is an important function of Stanford
advisers. Yet most Stanford professors are men. There
fore. students have few opportunities to meet successful
professional women and to observe alternative ap
proaches to being a working woman or a working
mother. We recommend that the Dean of Students en
courage the participation of professional women in Uni
versity public functions and in activities at University
residences, until there are more women on the faculty.

Following are the highlights of a report on the Stan
ford woman student in 1972 as compiled by the Com
mittee on the Education and Employment of Women in
the University.

Donham, ext. 4631.
THE STANFORD WOMAN IN 1972
A survey of the senior class of 1972 shows that the
Stanford undergraduate woman has changed remarkably
over the past five years.' She no longer accepts the
traditional roles which society has assigned to her as a
member of the female sex. Graduating men and women
seniors have very similar educational and occupational
aspirations. There is little difference between the propor
tions of women and men who plan to become profes
sionals: doctors, lawyers, college professors, and scien
tists. And the same proportions of men and women plan
to go on for graduate study.
Sex discrimination occurs at Stanford but its inci
dence is limited. Almost one-fourth the graduating seni
or women say they were discouraged from some goal by
sex discrimination while they were at Stanford. And
changes between major fields can to some extent be
predicted by the sex of the student and the traditional
sexual composition of the majors.
This report presents the results of a survey of Stan
ford seniors and makes recommendations on how the
University can end discrimination and provide more op
portunities for women. The first section of the report
considers the educational and occupational plans of men
and women undergraduates in 1972 and in 1965. The
second section concerns sex-role expectations and the
Stanford environment. It discusses women's experiences
of discrimination at Stanford, and the pattern of choos
ing majors which perpetuates the existence of predomi
nantly male fields. The third section discusses the effects
of academic and occupation counselling at Stanford. The
Committee's recommendations are summarized at the
end of the report.
The data presented in this report is the result of a
survey of 280 graduating seniors conducted in the Spring
of 1972. The questionnaire, "A Survey of Major and
Occupational Choice," was designed to find out what
fields Stanford undergraduates choose for their studies
and future jobs, and how the University environment
influences their choices. Recipients of the questionnaire
were randomly chosen in groups by sex and the aca
demic field in which they were interested when they
entered Stanford. Data presented here has been weighted
to be representative of the whole graduating class, unless
otherwise indicated. 136 men and 144 women respon
ded to the mailed questionnaire, giving a response rate of
79%. The questionnaire and a discussion of research
procedures are presented in the Appendix.
I. THE NEW STANFORD WOMAN
Occupational Plans of the Class of 1972
Perhaps the most significant finding of the survey of
major and occupational choice is the similarity of the
plans of men and women students. In the past it was
assumed that most Stanford men would become profes
sionals or businessmen while Stanford women would
become housewives, school teachers, and secretaries.
This stereotype used to approximate reality. It is no
longer valid.
In the Stanford class of 1972, a similar proportion of
men and women plan to enter major professions. 69% of
the men and 53% of the women who have a single
definite long-range plan say they will become doctors,
lawyers, college professors and scientists. When this is
generalized to the entire class, (including those who have
vague plans or more than one plan), 28% of senior
women and 30% of senior men are definitely planning to
enter a major profession.
The following table shows the responses of those who
said they had definite long-range occupational plans.
Data representing the plans of the whole population,
including those who are uncertain, shows a very similar
pattern.

N=6B N=B4

It is apparent that the occupational choices of Stan
ford women do not fit into sexual stereotypes. Informa
tion on all the occupations which students considered at
Stanford shows that the women respondents began with
more traditional ideas as freshmen and moved away
from traditional considerations during their time at the
University.
Women and men not only have very similar occupa
tional plans, they also seem to have the same level of
commitment to their occupations and the same expecta
tions of success. As a measure of the seriousness of
occupational intent, students were asked how they had
prepared for their planned future occupations. The same
proportion of women and men said that they had pre
pared themselves by such activities as talking to individ
uals in the occupation, acquiring needed credentials or
training, and finding employment.
Expectations of success were measured by asking
students what ideally would be their occupation or main
activity in five years and what, realistically, they thought

they would be doing. Most students said they would
probably be engaged in their ideal occupations, (71% of
the men and 58% of the women). While fewer women
than men believe they will be engaged in their ideal
occupations, no more women than men think they will
be engaged in lower status occupations. Of those who do
not believe they will be engaged in their ideal occupa
tions, 26% of the men and 28% of the women said they
would probably be engaged in an occupation that vns
lower status than their ideal occupation.
The three most frequently mentioned ideal occupa
tions were medicine, law, and college educator-scientist.

Legal professions 15 15 7 7

N=loB N=l2s

As Table 2 shows, virtually all of the men and women
that aspire to these professions expect to reach their
goals, with the single exception of women who would
like to be college professors or scientists. 12% of the
women hold this ideal but only 7% believe they can
realistically attain it. This is by far the biggest gap
between ideal and realistic assessments for any sex or
occupation. It is interesting that women students have
the least confidence about the occupation to which they
have had the most exposure at Stanford: college profes
sor.
Educational Plans of the Class of 1972
The educational plans of graduating men and women
students are also quite similar. Just as many men as
women plan to go on for further education at some
point in the future, as Table 3 shows.

TABLE 3

7c Having definite educational plans 84.5 81.3
% Having uncertain educational plans 4.4 8.5

N=l33 N=l44

Approximately the same proportion of men and
women are also going on for graduate study in the next
six months, (54 percent of the men and 49 percent of
the women).
Doctoral and professional programs have traditionally
been filled with men, while women have tended to enter
masters programs. This trend is still apparent with this
year's Stanford graduates, but the gap is closing. 52% of
the women and 74% of the men who said they were
going on for further education are planning to get a
doctorate, or a degree in law or medicine. 41% of the
women and 23% of the men are getting Masters degrees.
The remaining students will be getting technical licenses,
professional B.A.s or certificates of some kind.
A Comparison of Senior Women in 1965 and 1972
The plans of graduating Stanford women have
changed dramatically in the past few years. Data gather
ed on the Class of 1965 by the Institute for the Study of
Human Problems shows striking differences from the
Class of 1972. In "Career and Autonomy in College
Women," Joseph Katz draws the following conclusion:
.. .even in as academically able a group of students
as the Stanford women, the orientation toward
occupational roles is a very "traditional" one, even
though, as we will later see, there is a high valua
tion of the occupational life. .. .the women are
oriented towards family and their biggest occupa
tional aspiration is elementary and secondary
school teaching.
Similar findings have been reported by many other stud
ies of the occupational plans of women students in the
1950s and the early 1960s.
The following table compares the occupational plans
of women graduating in 1965 and 1972, and shows how
much Stanford undergraduates have changed in the past
7 years. The data for the two time periods are not
completely comparable, since different research pro
cedures were used in the two studies. However, the
comparisons between men and women within each time
period are valid.
The table shows a dramatic rise in the proportion of
women interested in the professions, and a sharp de
crease in the proportion who intend to be teachers.
These changes are clear, even though the 1972 data
represents women's most pessimistic estimates of their
future occupations, i.e., their realistic assessments of
what they would be doing in five years, as opposed to
their occupational plans.

In 1965, the ratio of men to women planning to
♦enter professions was 6to 1; in 1972 the ratio is 1.6 to
1. The proportion of women planning to enter elemen
tary and secondary education has decreased from 36% to
10% and the same proportion of men and women now
plan to enter business.
Stanford women have changed their conceptions of
their marital and childbearing roles, as well as their
occupational and education plans. Katz's respondents
were acutely aware of their future roles as wives and
mothers, and most assumed that their occupational goals
would be secondary to their duties to their husbands and
children. 70% of these women said they would not work
at all when their children were under 6 years old, and
only 43% intended to work full time when their children
were over 12 years of age.
Stanford women no longer think along these lines.
The 1972 respondents were not asked directly about
their plans for marriage and childrearing, but the women
were given ample opportunity to mention the future role
of wife and mother. Few women ever mentioned the
topic.
In one series of questions, we asked women what
they were planning to do after graduation, and how long
they planned to continue in that activity. Traditional
patterns led us to expect that a significant proportion of
the women would say they planned to work either until
they had put their husbands through school, or until it
was time to raise children. Only 3% of the women
who were leaving college to work said they would stop
when their husbands had finished school, and only 7%
said they would stop to raise children. Traditional role
expectations still exist at Stanford, but they are the
exception rather than the rule.
This conclusion is also supported by their responses
about "ideal" and "real" future activities. Only 3% of
the women said that, ideally, they would be housewives
in five years and an additional .4% thought that real
istically they would be housewives at that time. In five
years, most of these women will be 26 or 27 years old,
an age at which, in the past, a majority of women
already have small children. However, only 15% of the
women said that they realistically expected childraising
and housework to be a major activity, in addition to
some kind of employment. In all, only 18.5% of the
women mentioned the role of wife and mother as part of
their main activities in the next 5 years.
In sum, the data show that Stanford women have
broken away from traditional stereotypes about "the
woman's role" in the last seven years. Women and men
now have very similar occupational and educational
plans. Women no longer seem to regard a job as "some
thing to fall back on." They take their plans seriously,
and they expect to succeed.
Policy Implications
1. It is important that all members of the Stanford
community — administrators, professors, advisers, and
counsellors — understand the new aspirations of women
undergraduates. The best cure for sex-role stereotypes is
information. For this reason, the findings of this study
should be publicized as widely as possible. We recom
mend that the Dean of Undergraduate Studies and the
Provost take steps to ensure that the findings of this
study are communicated to all professors, advisers,
counsellors and administrators, especially those who
have extensive contact with undergraduates.
2. Stanford University as an institution employing over
7,000 men and women is responsible for setting an
example by eliminating all discriminatory hiring and
promotional practices. The administration should con
tinue to give high priority to its affirmative action ef
forts, and to publicize them as widely as possible.
11. SEX ROLE EXPECTATIONS AND THE STAN
FORD ENVIRONMENT
Knowing that Stanford men and women share sub
stantially the same aspirations, it is important to ask
whether Stanford's treatment of its students is consis
tent with these aspirations. Are Stanford women dis
couraged from entering traditionally male fields and
seeking careers in predominantly male areas? Are they
encouraged to be housewives and school teachers, when
many would prefer to be doctors and professors?
By and large, the answer to these questions appears to
be no. Most women do not believe that they encounter
ed discrimination while they were at Stanford, but a
significant number of Stanford women have been in
fluenced to limit their educational and occupational
choices because of their sex. Most departments and
professors do not discriminate against women; but some
do.
Experience with Discrimination
When asked, "do you feel you have been discouraged
from any academic or occupational goals by a member
of the Stanford community because of your sex?" 29 of
the 128 women who responded said yes. This generalizes
to 23% of all Stanford women. Another 5% of the
women experienced discrimination but were not dis
couraged by it. Most of these women were discouraged
by contacts with faculty members.

In all, almost one-quarter of Stanford women are
discouraged by discrimination. The forms which this
discrimination takes range from explicit discouragement
from a professor to more subtle environmental cues. The
observations of some of the women respondents illus
trate this quite clearly. The following quotations drawn
from survey responses illustrate overt discouragement of
women by their advisers:
Dr. X, a pre-med adviser, had a dim view of the
possibility of women actually making it through
all the work necessary to be a doctor, and later of
her juggling work, children, etc. .. .There were 2
other girls in our advisee group. He said he didn 't
expect to see us the next year.. . .
Not only my major adviser, but several of my
professors in my department failed to offer any
encouragement or assistance and in some cases
actively discouraged me from further study in
mathematics - both when I sought advice and
approval for advanced study and when I sought
assistance and consultation in courses I was taking.
A largely negative reaction (at best, I was ignored)
from male peers in math and science classes was
also quite evident.
My history adviser specifically discouraged me
from going on to grad school. He kept suggesting
high school teaching as "more flexible for a
woman." And he did this even after I took several
courses from him in which I did very well. He even
urged me to take on the honors thesis program.
Other women described comments made by professors
during lectures as a source of discouragement:
I took a class in (chemistry) from Dr. X - a
required course for many med schools. He began
his first lecture by saying there were 2 things he
couldn 't stand — premeds and women who
thought they could be scientists. His actions were
consistent with his prejudices.
One art teacher, XX, believes that women make
better art teachers than artists - his suggestions to
this effect have been to classes as a whole, not to
me individually, but I think that his underlying
sexism affects his relationship with me although he
shows a respect for my work.
Some women found assessments of the employment
situation for women in some fields more discouraging
than helpful:
I have been told of personal experience of the bias
against women in university level teaching. I would
not seek employment as a member of an academic
community (university).
. . .advisers have given me "realistic appraisals
which were very discouraging.
Finally, some women did not describe a direct communi
cation at all, but a sense they had from what was around
them:
It's difficult to be specific - one carries with him
the prejudices; I wish now I had gone pre-med; I
would like to be a doctor but women weren't
doctors; and women didn't go on to be English
professors - I didn 7 look much beyond teaching
- and no one suggested anything else.
Though discouragement has not been overt (ex
cept in a couple of cases where people couldn't
understand why I couldn't be happy teaching in
high school) there is a lot of subtle discourage
ment. 1) The lack of female professors which
really presents a problem in terms of role identity,
2) the number of professors that give only a nega
tive account of their role (Idon't understand why
they're still in it), 3) a disbelief, from both profes
sors and students, that I can combine being a
woman with being a professor, 4) the way I see
female professors now being treated (i.e. difficulty
in obtaining tenure, refusal to see their courses as
anything but "fun" (both professors and stu
dents), insinuations about their teaching ability
and/or intelligence related to sex, etc.).
Policy Implications
Overt discouragement of women wishing to enter
"male" fields and professions should not exist at Stan
ford in 1972. To counter such sexism when it results
from ignorance, an effort should be made to increase
awareness of the fact that women are capable of doing
"male jobs" and succeeding in "male fields," and that
many women do successfully combine professional and
childrearing responsibilities. Any professor or counsellor
who continues to discourage women students because of
their sex should not be asked to advise them. We recom
mend that the Dean of Undergraduate Studies develop a
list of advisers that are particularly interested in working
with women undergraduates. Students should be in
formed that they have the option of choosing someone
from this list to replace their current adviser. In addi
tion, the Dean of Undergraduate Studies should consider
developing procedures by which students can register
complaints if they experience discrimination from their
adviser.
111. CHOICE OF MAJORS
Just as some occupations are usually seen as "men's
jobs" and others as "women's jobs," so some academic
fields are seen as primarily "male" or "female." The
traditional perceptions of appropriate fields for men and
women closely fit the actual proportions of each sex
majoring in these fields at Stanford today. The science
fields have few women, the humanities many more than
their share. Students' changes between majors were
assessed in order to find out if this distribution was due
to interests and orientations acquired before students
entered Stanford, or if the Stanford environment was in
some way encouraging sex-typed choices of major fields.
The results show that students do tend to move into
fields dominated by their own sex while they are at
Stanford. Women more than men switch out of fields
such as Political Science and into fields like English and
Music. More men than women move into fields which
already have a large number of men and out of fields
with a larger proportion s of women. While students are
breaking traditiojn in their careqr N choices, they are per
petuating the, sex-typing of majoi; fields.
. ' \ v v • \ \ \ r •. * > *
of switching between majors, fields
were categorized as cither maje-dominated or non-male
dominated. All fields having less than 25% wom'en'were
, male-dominated, rest,, non-male-dominated.
(j3)S% of, Stanford undergraduates are women.) Male
dominated fields were further divided into science and
non-science fields. Students were asked about the field
ip vyhich' they expressed'an interest time they
were accepted to Stanfo'rd, (referred to as'their
man field of interest"), their first major, and the'major
with which they graduated.
Tn Ihe male-domma'ted sbifcnce fields, Stanford stu
dents appear to bring th v eir sex role stereotypes with
them.'Many mo're freshmen men. than women are inter
ested in these fields; but there is no change towards
greater sexvtyped choice between the freshman and
senior year. "Science fields, retain and attract an equal
proportion of men and women majors.
The fields where Stanford students increasingly make
their choices in terms of sex role stereotypes are the
male dominated, nonscience fields: economics, history,
political science, philosophy, architecture and urban de
sign. Of those students who were interested in these
fields as freshmen, more men than women remained in
these fields until they graduated (60% vs. 53%). More
over, in recruiting new majors, these fields attract many
more men than women. Nonscience male-dominated
fields attract 45% of the men who come to Stanford
interested in non-male-dominated fields, and only 10%
of the women.
Students who come to Stanford without a clear field
of interest seem to be most influenced by pressures to
select a field that is "appropriate" for their sex. The
students who said they were considering both a male
dominated and a non-male-dominated field when they
were accepted to Stanford showed almost no sex-typed
switching. (3% of all freshmen men and 7% of all fresh
men women were in this category.) On the other hand,
the final majors of those who were undecided as entering
freshmen and were not interested in any particular field,
can be almost entirely predicted by sex-typing. 79% of
these men graduated in male-dominated fields, 21% in
non-male-dominated fields. 27% of the undecided
women graduated in male-dominated fields, and 70% in
non-male-dominated fields. (20% of freshmen women
and 26% of freshmen men were undecided.)
The fact that students who come to Stanford with no
idea of what they want to do show the most sex-typed
behavior would seem to indicate that the University
environment influences students to make this kind of
choice. However, when students were asked why they
made the choices they did, such pressures from the
University were not evident. Women were not advised to
shift out of male-dominated fields any more often than
they were encouraged to shift into them. They did not
respond that experienced or anticipated discrimination
was a reason for such shifts, nor did they feel less
capable of succeeding in male-dominated fields. The
reasons which women give for changing majors do not
explain the pattern of sex-typed switching.
Most of the women's sex-typed switching occurred
between the time of their acceptance to Stanford and
•the time they declared their first major (by the end of
their sophomore years). This tendency for sex-typed
major choice to be more frequent in the freshman and
sophomore years has two possible explanations. Stu
dents may act more traditionally when they are younger
or sex-role stereotypes may have been more dominant at
Stanford three and four years ago.
i
Plans for graduate study also show some of the sex
typing. While more students plan graduate study in male

dominated than in non-male-dominated fields, in gen
eral, twice as many men as women do so. 45% of t,he
women and 86% of-the men with definite educational
i plaas, are going on in male-dominpted fields. , , \

Policy Implications ■ > < '. i i i - ! . . •< •„>
The overwhelming predominance' of men iri certain
social science and humanities fields is perpetuated as
women tend to avoid and leave these fields while thtfy
are at Stanford. These departments -*■ economics, his
tory, philosophy, political science, architecture and
urban design — should investigate this situation, looking,
in particular, at their introductory classes. The sciences,
which attract few women students, seem to be dealing
with a phenomenon inherited from the high schools. All
departments with few women majors should make an
effort to attract them. One obvious step in this direction
is to increase the number of women teaching in these
fields.
We recommend that departments with fewer than
25% women majors should experiment with ways of
attracting more women majors (such as distributing writ
ten materials through the Academic Information Center
or encouraging current women majors to discuss the
department's program with other women). These depart
ments should also determine the proportion of women
undergraduates that join and leave their undergraduate
program. Departments may wish to confer with the
Committee on the Employment and Education of
Women about methods for recruiting women, and they
should report their progress to the Committee by the

IV. ACADEMIC AND OCCUPATIONAL COUNSEL
LING
The survey shows that many students find Stanford

services helpful at some point in their undergraduate
careers, but very few feel that Stanford's advisers or
counsellors have affected their occupational plans. Stu
dents were asked specifically about their contacts with
their freshman advisers, academic advisers, and career
counsellors in the placement center. Only a small pro
portion felt that these people had had any effect on
their occupational plans.

Advising and Sex-Roles
One question asked of the data was whether or not
men and womcjri were advised to chodsb fields "appro
priate to their'sex. In only one'case did this trend seem
apparept. There is some indication that the advice of
freshmen advisers reflected sex-role stereotypes. 4 of the
5 students who said they were discouraged by their
freshmen advisers were women and all of the women
were discouraged in male fields. This bias did not appear
ill responses about academic advisers and career counsel
lors. Studtnis tvere' also -asked about' the nature of the
boMattis'with their advisers which affected therin occupa
tional considerations. It is significant that one-quarter of
HHe wtlrti&n 1 whose occupational plans had b&eivaffected
■by l e!dritkets with ah advis'er or counsellor said that the
tridifttibaP hdd disdissed se* discrimination in the area
CoiTside'rihg.' Advisers are most influential as
fol£ rhollels. WhCri students were risked to "check the
statements' which; you feel accurately describe the nature
of 1 the contacts With your'freshman, adviser which affec
ted! ybur occupational consideration,"' the most fre
quently checked response was "Adviser acted as a posi
tive example of Individual in field." "Adviser acted as 1 a
negative example of individual in field" was also checked
frequently, and woijien students found advisers
equally important as role models. It is important to
note, however, that the large majority of these advisers
are men.
Suggestions for Improvements
Students were asked to respond to two open ended
questions about Stanford services: "What services that
Stanford now offers, if any, have been helpful to you in
planning your future:" and "What services which are not
now offered would you find helpful:" 60% of the 136
men answering the questionnaire and 54% of the 144
women mentioned some service at Stanford which had
been helpful to them. (These percentages refer to pro
portion of respondents. They have not been weighted to
represent the whole class.) Those services mentioned
most frequently were the Academic Information Center,
(41 times), the Career Counselling and Placement Cen
ter, (39 times), and the pre-med advising services, (18
times). 51 men and 61 women suggested improvements
in Stanford services. The most frequent target of sugges
tions were the departments, especially among women.
32 women and 15 men said that departments should be
more helpful in planning their futures. Helping students
plan their futures would be a new role for departments.
Only 11 students said their departments had actually
been helpful while they were at Stanford, and most of

the praise resulted from opportunities for practical ex
perience in their fields, not from advice or information
they had received.
Generally, students said they would have liked more
informal, personal contacts with professors, counsellors,
and people in the fields they are considering to give
them a better sense of what they wanted to do in the
future. One student suggested:

a broad, coordinated counselling service, with
competent people who can talk meaningfully
about a variety of occupations and lifestyles those
occupations shape. (Not just an engineering coun
sellor for engineering, an econ adviser for econ,
etc.)
i>i 112 c / . ' ! ; i ) I
Departments were suggested as an alternative source of
information about the employment possibilities stem
ming from a field of study.
A larger proportion of women than men students
have immediate need of career counselling and place
ment services. More of the women are planning to get a
full-time job as soon as they leave Stanford. 29% of the
women and 18% of the men said they expected to be
working full-time in the six months after graduation.
Women also seem to need more help in finding jobs. 26%
of the women who were planning to work full-time after
graduation have already looked for jobs in the area in
which they wanted to work, and only 7% had found
jobs. 18% of the men had looked for employment, and
11% had found jobs. Therefore, it is particularly im
portant for women students that occupational counsel
ling services be improved.
Policy Implications
1. The Career Planning and Placement Center should
make a special effort to help women plan their careers
and find jobs. Since a large number of women are trying
to find jobs in areas where few women have been hired
before, the Placement Center should make aggressive
efforts to place these women.
We recommend that the Career Planning and Place
ment Center report on what activities and what addi
tional staff are required in order to provide better service
to women undergraduates.
2. Women should be prepared to cope with discrimina
tion when they encounter it. We recommend that legal
and practical counselling about dealing with discrimina
tion be made available at the Placement Center.
3. Major department should be involved in occupation
counselling efforts. The experience and contacts of Stan
ford professors remain a largely untapped resource. As
some students suggested, departments should institute
programs in conjunction with the Career Planning and
Placement Center which offer an overview of the occu
pations open to men and women with training in differ
ent academic fields. Women should be well represented
in all such programs.
Wc recommend that each department provide a pro
gram of occupational counselling for its men and women
majors, either on its own or in conjunction with the
Career Planning and Placement Center.
4. Our data shows that advisers and counsellors current
ly discuss the problem of discrimination with their
women students. As several students suggested, this kind
of discussion can often be more discouraging than help
ful. Stanford advisers and counsellors need to be sensi
tive to the fine line between a fatalistic discussion of
discrimination and one that prepares women to meet the
difficulties they will encounter with determination in
stead of with surprise.
We recommend that the Dean of Students Office
develop written material and discussion sessions for ad
visers and counsellors that will orient them to the special
needs of women students.
5. Role modeling is an important function of Stanford
advisers. Yet most Stanford professors are men. There
fore. students have few opportunities to meet successful
professional women and to observe alternative ap
proaches to being a working woman or a working
mother. We recommend that the Dean of Students en
courage the participation of professional women in Uni
versity public functions and in activities at University
residences, until there are more women on the faculty.
Space paid for by News and Publications
Following are the highlights of a report on the Stan
ford woman student in 1972 as compiled by the Com
mittee on the Education and Employment of Women in
the University.
For full copies of the report, please call Nancy
Donham, ext. 4631.
THE STANFORD WOMAN IN 1972
A survey of the senior class of 1972 shows that the
Stanford undergraduate woman has changed remarkably
over the past five years.' She no longer accepts the
traditional roles which society has assigned to her as a
member of the female sex. Graduating men and women
seniors have very similar educational and occupational
aspirations. There is little difference between the propor
tions of women and men who plan to become profes
sionals: doctors, lawyers, college professors, and scien
tists. And the same proportions of men and women plan
to go on for graduate study.
Sex discrimination occurs at Stanford but its inci
dence is limited. Almost one-fourth the graduating seni
or women say they were discouraged from some goal by
sex discrimination while they were at Stanford. And
changes between major fields can to some extent be
predicted by the sex of the student and the traditional
sexual composition of the majors.
This report presents the results of a survey of Stan
ford seniors and makes recommendations on how the
University can end discrimination and provide more op
portunities for women. The first section of the report
considers the educational and occupational plans of men
and women undergraduates in 1972 and in 1965. The
second section concerns sex-role expectations and the
Stanford environment. It discusses women's experiences
of discrimination at Stanford, and the pattern of choos
ing majors which perpetuates the existence of predomi
nantly male fields. The third section discusses the effects
of academic and occupation counselling at Stanford. The
Committee's recommendations are summarized at the
end of the report.
The data presented in this report is the result of a
survey of 280 graduating seniors conducted in the Spring
of 1972. The questionnaire, "A Survey of Major and
Occupational Choice," was designed to find out what
fields Stanford undergraduates choose for their studies
and future jobs, and how the University environment
influences their choices. Recipients of the questionnaire
were randomly chosen in groups by sex and the aca
demic field in which they were interested when they
entered Stanford. Data presented here has been weighted
to be representative of the whole graduating class, unless
otherwise indicated. 136 men and 144 women respon
ded to the mailed questionnaire, giving a response rate of
79%. The questionnaire and a discussion of research
procedures are presented in the Appendix.
I. THE NEW STANFORD WOMAN
Occupational Plans of the Class of 1972
Perhaps the most significant finding of the survey of
major and occupational choice is the similarity of the
plans of men and women students. In the past it was
assumed that most Stanford men would become profes
sionals or businessmen while Stanford women would
become housewives, school teachers, and secretaries.
This stereotype used to approximate reality. It is no
longer valid.
In the Stanford class of 1972, a similar proportion of
men and women plan to enter major professions. 69% of
the men and 53% of the women who have a single
definite long-range plan say they will become doctors,
lawyers, college professors and scientists. When this is
generalized to the entire class, (including those who have
vague plans or more than one plan), 28% of senior
women and 30% of senior men are definitely planning to
enter a major profession.
The following table shows the responses of those who
said they had definite long-range occupational plans.
Data representing the plans of the whole population,
including those who are uncertain, shows a very similar
pattern.

N=6B N=B4

It is apparent that the occupational choices of Stan
ford women do not fit into sexual stereotypes. Informa
tion on all the occupations which students considered at
Stanford shows that the women respondents began with
more traditional ideas as freshmen and moved away
from traditional considerations during their time at the
University.
Women and men not only have very similar occupa
tional plans, they also seem to have the same level of
commitment to their occupations and the same expecta
tions of success. As a measure of the seriousness of
occupational intent, students were asked how they had
prepared for their planned future occupations. The same
proportion of women and men said that they had pre
pared themselves by such activities as talking to individ
uals in the occupation, acquiring needed credentials or
training, and finding employment.
Expectations of success were measured by asking
students what ideally would be their occupation or main
activity in five years and what, realistically, they thought

they would be doing. Most students said they would
probably be engaged in their ideal occupations, (71% of
the men and 58% of the women). While fewer women
than men believe they will be engaged in their ideal
occupations, no more women than men think they will
be engaged in lower status occupations. Of those who do
not believe they will be engaged in their ideal occupa
tions, 26% of the men and 28% of the women said they
would probably be engaged in an occupation that vns
lower status than their ideal occupation.
The three most frequently mentioned ideal occupa
tions were medicine, law, and college educator-scientist.

Medical professions 20 22 18 19
Legal professions 15 15 7 7

N=loB N=l2s

As Table 2 shows, virtually all of the men and women
that aspire to these professions expect to reach their
goals, with the single exception of women who would
like to be college professors or scientists. 12% of the
women hold this ideal but only 7% believe they can
realistically attain it. This is by far the biggest gap
between ideal and realistic assessments for any sex or
occupation. It is interesting that women students have
the least confidence about the occupation to which they
have had the most exposure at Stanford: college profes
sor.
Educational Plans of the Class of 1972
The educational plans of graduating men and women
students are also quite similar. Just as many men as
women plan to go on for further education at some
point in the future, as Table 3 shows.

TABLE 3

7c Having definite educational plans 84.5 81.3
% Having uncertain educational plans 4.4 8.5

N=l33 N=l44

Approximately the same proportion of men and
women are also going on for graduate study in the next
six months, (54 percent of the men and 49 percent of
the women).
Doctoral and professional programs have traditionally
been filled with men, while women have tended to enter
masters programs. This trend is still apparent with this
year's Stanford graduates, but the gap is closing. 52% of
the women and 74% of the men who said they were
going on for further education are planning to get a
doctorate, or a degree in law or medicine. 41% of the
women and 23% of the men are getting Masters degrees.
The remaining students will be getting technical licenses,
professional B.A.s or certificates of some kind.
A Comparison of Senior Women in 1965 and 1972
The plans of graduating Stanford women have
changed dramatically in the past few years. Data gather
ed on the Class of 1965 by the Institute for the Study of
Human Problems shows striking differences from the
Class of 1972. In "Career and Autonomy in College
Women," Joseph Katz draws the following conclusion:
.. .even in as academically able a group of students
as the Stanford women, the orientation toward
occupational roles is a very "traditional" one, even
though, as we will later see, there is a high valua
tion of the occupational life. .. .the women are
oriented towards family and their biggest occupa
tional aspiration is elementary and secondary
school teaching.
Similar findings have been reported by many other stud
ies of the occupational plans of women students in the
1950s and the early 1960s.
The following table compares the occupational plans
of women graduating in 1965 and 1972, and shows how
much Stanford undergraduates have changed in the past
7 years. The data for the two time periods are not
completely comparable, since different research pro
cedures were used in the two studies. However, the
comparisons between men and women within each time
period are valid.
The table shows a dramatic rise in the proportion of
women interested in the professions, and a sharp de
crease in the proportion who intend to be teachers.
These changes are clear, even though the 1972 data
represents women's most pessimistic estimates of their
future occupations, i.e., their realistic assessments of
what they would be doing in five years, as opposed to
their occupational plans.

In 1965, the ratio of men to women planning to
♦enter professions was 6to 1; in 1972 the ratio is 1.6 to
1. The proportion of women planning to enter elemen
tary and secondary education has decreased from 36% to
10% and the same proportion of men and women now
plan to enter business.
Stanford women have changed their conceptions of
their marital and childbearing roles, as well as their
occupational and education plans. Katz's respondents
were acutely aware of their future roles as wives and
mothers, and most assumed that their occupational goals
would be secondary to their duties to their husbands and
children. 70% of these women said they would not work
at all when their children were under 6 years old, and
only 43% intended to work full time when their children
were over 12 years of age.
Stanford women no longer think along these lines.
The 1972 respondents were not asked directly about
their plans for marriage and childrearing, but the women
were given ample opportunity to mention the future role
of wife and mother. Few women ever mentioned the
topic.
In one series of questions, we asked women what
they were planning to do after graduation, and how long
they planned to continue in that activity. Traditional
patterns led us to expect that a significant proportion of
the women would say they planned to work either until
they had put their husbands through school, or until it
was time to raise children. Only 3% of the women
who were leaving college to work said they would stop
when their husbands had finished school, and only 7%
said they would stop to raise children. Traditional role
expectations still exist at Stanford, but they are the
exception rather than the rule.
This conclusion is also supported by their responses
about "ideal" and "real" future activities. Only 3% of
the women said that, ideally, they would be housewives
in five years and an additional .4% thought that real
istically they would be housewives at that time. In five
years, most of these women will be 26 or 27 years old,
an age at which, in the past, a majority of women
already have small children. However, only 15% of the
women said that they realistically expected childraising
and housework to be a major activity, in addition to
some kind of employment. In all, only 18.5% of the
women mentioned the role of wife and mother as part of
their main activities in the next 5 years.
In sum, the data show that Stanford women have
broken away from traditional stereotypes about "the
woman's role" in the last seven years. Women and men
now have very similar occupational and educational
plans. Women no longer seem to regard a job as "some
thing to fall back on." They take their plans seriously,
and they expect to succeed.
Policy Implications
1. It is important that all members of the Stanford
community — administrators, professors, advisers, and
counsellors — understand the new aspirations of women
undergraduates. The best cure for sex-role stereotypes is
information. For this reason, the findings of this study
should be publicized as widely as possible. We recom
mend that the Dean of Undergraduate Studies and the
Provost take steps to ensure that the findings of this
study are communicated to all professors, advisers,
counsellors and administrators, especially those who
have extensive contact with undergraduates.
2. Stanford University as an institution employing over
7,000 men and women is responsible for setting an
example by eliminating all discriminatory hiring and
promotional practices. The administration should con
tinue to give high priority to its affirmative action ef
forts, and to publicize them as widely as possible.
11. SEX ROLE EXPECTATIONS AND THE STAN
FORD ENVIRONMENT
Knowing that Stanford men and women share sub
stantially the same aspirations, it is important to ask
whether Stanford's treatment of its students is consis
tent with these aspirations. Are Stanford women dis
couraged from entering traditionally male fields and
seeking careers in predominantly male areas? Are they
encouraged to be housewives and school teachers, when
many would prefer to be doctors and professors?
By and large, the answer to these questions appears to
be no. Most women do not believe that they encounter
ed discrimination while they were at Stanford, but a
significant number of Stanford women have been in
fluenced to limit their educational and occupational
choices because of their sex. Most departments and
professors do not discriminate against women; but some
do.
Experience with Discrimination
When asked, "do you feel you have been discouraged
from any academic or occupational goals by a member
of the Stanford community because of your sex?" 29 of
the 128 women who responded said yes. This generalizes
to 23% of all Stanford women. Another 5% of the
women experienced discrimination but were not dis
couraged by it. Most of these women were discouraged
by contacts with faculty members.

In all, almost one-quarter of Stanford women are
discouraged by discrimination. The forms which this
discrimination takes range from explicit discouragement
from a professor to more subtle environmental cues. The
observations of some of the women respondents illus
trate this quite clearly. The following quotations drawn
from survey responses illustrate overt discouragement of
women by their advisers:
Dr. X, a pre-med adviser, had a dim view of the
possibility of women actually making it through
all the work necessary to be a doctor, and later of
her juggling work, children, etc. .. .There were 2
other girls in our advisee group. He said he didn 't
expect to see us the next year.. . .
Not only my major adviser, but several of my
professors in my department failed to offer any
encouragement or assistance and in some cases
actively discouraged me from further study in
mathematics - both when I sought advice and
approval for advanced study and when I sought
assistance and consultation in courses I was taking.
A largely negative reaction (at best, I was ignored)
from male peers in math and science classes was
also quite evident.
My history adviser specifically discouraged me
from going on to grad school. He kept suggesting
high school teaching as "more flexible for a
woman." And he did this even after I took several
courses from him in which I did very well. He even
urged me to take on the honors thesis program.
Other women described comments made by professors
during lectures as a source of discouragement:
I took a class in (chemistry) from Dr. X - a
required course for many med schools. He began
his first lecture by saying there were 2 things he
couldn 't stand — premeds and women who
thought they could be scientists. His actions were
consistent with his prejudices.
One art teacher, XX, believes that women make
better art teachers than artists - his suggestions to
this effect have been to classes as a whole, not to
me individually, but I think that his underlying
sexism affects his relationship with me although he
shows a respect for my work.
Some women found assessments of the employment
situation for women in some fields more discouraging
than helpful:
I have been told of personal experience of the bias
against women in university level teaching. I would
not seek employment as a member of an academic
community (university).
. . .advisers have given me "realistic appraisals
which were very discouraging.
Finally, some women did not describe a direct communi
cation at all, but a sense they had from what was around
them:
It's difficult to be specific - one carries with him
the prejudices; I wish now I had gone pre-med; I
would like to be a doctor but women weren't
doctors; and women didn't go on to be English
professors - I didn 7 look much beyond teaching
- and no one suggested anything else.
Though discouragement has not been overt (ex
cept in a couple of cases where people couldn't
understand why I couldn't be happy teaching in
high school) there is a lot of subtle discourage
ment. 1) The lack of female professors which
really presents a problem in terms of role identity,
2) the number of professors that give only a nega
tive account of their role (Idon't understand why
they're still in it), 3) a disbelief, from both profes
sors and students, that I can combine being a
woman with being a professor, 4) the way I see
female professors now being treated (i.e. difficulty
in obtaining tenure, refusal to see their courses as
anything but "fun" (both professors and stu
dents), insinuations about their teaching ability
and/or intelligence related to sex, etc.).
Policy Implications
Overt discouragement of women wishing to enter
"male" fields and professions should not exist at Stan
ford in 1972. To counter such sexism when it results
from ignorance, an effort should be made to increase
awareness of the fact that women are capable of doing
"male jobs" and succeeding in "male fields," and that
many women do successfully combine professional and
childrearing responsibilities. Any professor or counsellor
who continues to discourage women students because of
their sex should not be asked to advise them. We recom
mend that the Dean of Undergraduate Studies develop a
list of advisers that are particularly interested in working
with women undergraduates. Students should be in
formed that they have the option of choosing someone
from this list to replace their current adviser. In addi
tion, the Dean of Undergraduate Studies should consider
developing procedures by which students can register
complaints if they experience discrimination from their
adviser.
111. CHOICE OF MAJORS
Just as some occupations are usually seen as "men's
jobs" and others as "women's jobs," so some academic
fields are seen as primarily "male" or "female." The
traditional perceptions of appropriate fields for men and
women closely fit the actual proportions of each sex
majoring in these fields at Stanford today. The science
fields have few women, the humanities many more than
their share. Students' changes between majors were
assessed in order to find out if this distribution was due
to interests and orientations acquired before students
entered Stanford, or if the Stanford environment was in
some way encouraging sex-typed choices of major fields.
The results show that students do tend to move into
fields dominated by their own sex while they are at
Stanford. Women more than men switch out of fields
such as Political Science and into fields like English and
Music. More men than women move into fields which
already have a large number of men and out of fields
with a larger proportion s of women. While students are
breaking traditiojn in their careqr N choices, they are per
petuating the, sex-typing of majoi; fields.
. ' \ v v • \ \ \ r •. * > *
of switching between majors, fields
were categorized as cither maje-dominated or non-male
dominated. All fields having less than 25% wom'en'were
, male-dominated, rest,, non-male-dominated.
(j3)S% of, Stanford undergraduates are women.) Male
dominated fields were further divided into science and
non-science fields. Students were asked about the field
ip vyhich' they expressed'an interest time they
were accepted to Stanfo'rd, (referred to as'their
man field of interest"), their first major, and the'major
with which they graduated.
Tn Ihe male-domma'ted sbifcnce fields, Stanford stu
dents appear to bring th v eir sex role stereotypes with
them.'Many mo're freshmen men. than women are inter
ested in these fields; but there is no change towards
greater sexvtyped choice between the freshman and
senior year. "Science fields, retain and attract an equal
proportion of men and women majors.
The fields where Stanford students increasingly make
their choices in terms of sex role stereotypes are the
male dominated, nonscience fields: economics, history,
political science, philosophy, architecture and urban de
sign. Of those students who were interested in these
fields as freshmen, more men than women remained in
these fields until they graduated (60% vs. 53%). More
over, in recruiting new majors, these fields attract many
more men than women. Nonscience male-dominated
fields attract 45% of the men who come to Stanford
interested in non-male-dominated fields, and only 10%
of the women.
Students who come to Stanford without a clear field
of interest seem to be most influenced by pressures to
select a field that is "appropriate" for their sex. The
students who said they were considering both a male
dominated and a non-male-dominated field when they
were accepted to Stanford showed almost no sex-typed
switching. (3% of all freshmen men and 7% of all fresh
men women were in this category.) On the other hand,
the final majors of those who were undecided as entering
freshmen and were not interested in any particular field,
can be almost entirely predicted by sex-typing. 79% of
these men graduated in male-dominated fields, 21% in
non-male-dominated fields. 27% of the undecided
women graduated in male-dominated fields, and 70% in
non-male-dominated fields. (20% of freshmen women
and 26% of freshmen men were undecided.)
The fact that students who come to Stanford with no
idea of what they want to do show the most sex-typed
behavior would seem to indicate that the University
environment influences students to make this kind of
choice. However, when students were asked why they
made the choices they did, such pressures from the
University were not evident. Women were not advised to
shift out of male-dominated fields any more often than
they were encouraged to shift into them. They did not
respond that experienced or anticipated discrimination
was a reason for such shifts, nor did they feel less
capable of succeeding in male-dominated fields. The
reasons which women give for changing majors do not
explain the pattern of sex-typed switching.
Most of the women's sex-typed switching occurred
between the time of their acceptance to Stanford and
•the time they declared their first major (by the end of
their sophomore years). This tendency for sex-typed
major choice to be more frequent in the freshman and
sophomore years has two possible explanations. Stu
dents may act more traditionally when they are younger
or sex-role stereotypes may have been more dominant at
Stanford three and four years ago.
i
Plans for graduate study also show some of the sex
typing. While more students plan graduate study in male

dominated than in non-male-dominated fields, in gen
eral, twice as many men as women do so. 45% of t,he

Policy Implications ■ > < '. i i i - ! . . •< •„>
The overwhelming predominance' of men iri certain
social science and humanities fields is perpetuated as
women tend to avoid and leave these fields while thtfy
are at Stanford. These departments -*■ economics, his
tory, philosophy, political science, architecture and
urban design — should investigate this situation, looking,
in particular, at their introductory classes. The sciences,
which attract few women students, seem to be dealing
with a phenomenon inherited from the high schools. All
departments with few women majors should make an
effort to attract them. One obvious step in this direction
is to increase the number of women teaching in these
fields.
We recommend that departments with fewer than
25% women majors should experiment with ways of
attracting more women majors (such as distributing writ
ten materials through the Academic Information Center
or encouraging current women majors to discuss the
department's program with other women). These depart
ments should also determine the proportion of women
undergraduates that join and leave their undergraduate
program. Departments may wish to confer with the
Committee on the Employment and Education of
Women about methods for recruiting women, and they
should report their progress to the Committee by the
end of Spring Quarter, 1973.
IV. ACADEMIC AND OCCUPATIONAL COUNSEL
LING
The survey shows that many students find Stanford

services helpful at some point in their undergraduate
careers, but very few feel that Stanford's advisers or
counsellors have affected their occupational plans. Stu
dents were asked specifically about their contacts with
their freshman advisers, academic advisers, and career
counsellors in the placement center. Only a small pro
portion felt that these people had had any effect on
their occupational plans.

Advising and Sex-Roles
One question asked of the data was whether or not
men and womcjri were advised to chodsb fields "appro
priate to their'sex. In only one'case did this trend seem
apparept. There is some indication that the advice of
freshmen advisers reflected sex-role stereotypes. 4 of the
5 students who said they were discouraged by their
freshmen advisers were women and all of the women
were discouraged in male fields. This bias did not appear
ill responses about academic advisers and career counsel
lors. Studtnis tvere' also -asked about' the nature of the
boMattis'with their advisers which affected therin occupa
tional considerations. It is significant that one-quarter of
HHe wtlrti&n 1 whose occupational plans had b&eivaffected
■by l e!dritkets with ah advis'er or counsellor said that the
tridifttibaP hdd disdissed se* discrimination in the area
CoiTside'rihg.' Advisers are most influential as
fol£ rhollels. WhCri students were risked to "check the
statements' which; you feel accurately describe the nature
of 1 the contacts With your'freshman, adviser which affec
ted! ybur occupational consideration,"' the most fre
quently checked response was "Adviser acted as a posi
tive example of Individual in field." "Adviser acted as 1 a
negative example of individual in field" was also checked
frequently, and woijien students found advisers
equally important as role models. It is important to
note, however, that the large majority of these advisers
are men.
Suggestions for Improvements
Students were asked to respond to two open ended
questions about Stanford services: "What services that
Stanford now offers, if any, have been helpful to you in
planning your future:" and "What services which are not
now offered would you find helpful:" 60% of the 136
men answering the questionnaire and 54% of the 144
women mentioned some service at Stanford which had
been helpful to them. (These percentages refer to pro
portion of respondents. They have not been weighted to
represent the whole class.) Those services mentioned
most frequently were the Academic Information Center,
(41 times), the Career Counselling and Placement Cen
ter, (39 times), and the pre-med advising services, (18
times). 51 men and 61 women suggested improvements
in Stanford services. The most frequent target of sugges
tions were the departments, especially among women.
32 women and 15 men said that departments should be
more helpful in planning their futures. Helping students
plan their futures would be a new role for departments.
Only 11 students said their departments had actually
been helpful while they were at Stanford, and most of

the praise resulted from opportunities for practical ex
perience in their fields, not from advice or information
they had received.
Generally, students said they would have liked more
informal, personal contacts with professors, counsellors,
and people in the fields they are considering to give
them a better sense of what they wanted to do in the
future. One student suggested:

a broad, coordinated counselling service, with
competent people who can talk meaningfully
about a variety of occupations and lifestyles those
occupations shape. (Not just an engineering coun
sellor for engineering, an econ adviser for econ,
etc.)
i>i 112 c / . ' ! ; i ) I
Departments were suggested as an alternative source of
information about the employment possibilities stem
ming from a field of study.
A larger proportion of women than men students
have immediate need of career counselling and place
ment services. More of the women are planning to get a
full-time job as soon as they leave Stanford. 29% of the
women and 18% of the men said they expected to be
working full-time in the six months after graduation.
Women also seem to need more help in finding jobs. 26%
of the women who were planning to work full-time after
graduation have already looked for jobs in the area in
which they wanted to work, and only 7% had found
jobs. 18% of the men had looked for employment, and
11% had found jobs. Therefore, it is particularly im
portant for women students that occupational counsel
ling services be improved.
Policy Implications
1. The Career Planning and Placement Center should
make a special effort to help women plan their careers
and find jobs. Since a large number of women are trying
to find jobs in areas where few women have been hired
before, the Placement Center should make aggressive
efforts to place these women.
We recommend that the Career Planning and Place
ment Center report on what activities and what addi
tional staff are required in order to provide better service
to women undergraduates.
2. Women should be prepared to cope with discrimina
tion when they encounter it. We recommend that legal
and practical counselling about dealing with discrimina
tion be made available at the Placement Center.
3. Major department should be involved in occupation
counselling efforts. The experience and contacts of Stan
ford professors remain a largely untapped resource. As
some students suggested, departments should institute
programs in conjunction with the Career Planning and
Placement Center which offer an overview of the occu
pations open to men and women with training in differ
ent academic fields. Women should be well represented
in all such programs.
Wc recommend that each department provide a pro
gram of occupational counselling for its men and women
majors, either on its own or in conjunction with the
Career Planning and Placement Center.
4. Our data shows that advisers and counsellors current
ly discuss the problem of discrimination with their
women students. As several students suggested, this kind
of discussion can often be more discouraging than help
ful. Stanford advisers and counsellors need to be sensi
tive to the fine line between a fatalistic discussion of
discrimination and one that prepares women to meet the
difficulties they will encounter with determination in
stead of with surprise.
We recommend that the Dean of Students Office
develop written material and discussion sessions for ad
visers and counsellors that will orient them to the special
needs of women students.
5. Role modeling is an important function of Stanford
advisers. Yet most Stanford professors are men. There
fore. students have few opportunities to meet successful
professional women and to observe alternative ap
proaches to being a working woman or a working
mother. We recommend that the Dean of Students en
courage the participation of professional women in Uni
versity public functions and in activities at University
residences, until there are more women on the faculty.
Space paid for by News and Publications
Following are the highlights of a report on the Stan
ford woman student in 1972 as compiled by the Com
mittee on the Education and Employment of Women in
the University.
For full copies of the report, please call Nancy
Donham, ext. 4631.
THE STANFORD WOMAN IN 1972
A survey of the senior class of 1972 shows that the
Stanford undergraduate woman has changed remarkably
over the past five years.' She no longer accepts the
traditional roles which society has assigned to her as a
member of the female sex. Graduating men and women
seniors have very similar educational and occupational
aspirations. There is little difference between the propor
tions of women and men who plan to become profes
sionals: doctors, lawyers, college professors, and scien
tists. And the same proportions of men and women plan
to go on for graduate study.
Sex discrimination occurs at Stanford but its inci
dence is limited. Almost one-fourth the graduating seni
or women say they were discouraged from some goal by
sex discrimination while they were at Stanford. And
changes between major fields can to some extent be
predicted by the sex of the student and the traditional
sexual composition of the majors.
This report presents the results of a survey of Stan
ford seniors and makes recommendations on how the
University can end discrimination and provide more op
portunities for women. The first section of the report
considers the educational and occupational plans of men
and women undergraduates in 1972 and in 1965. The
second section concerns sex-role expectations and the
Stanford environment. It discusses women's experiences
of discrimination at Stanford, and the pattern of choos
ing majors which perpetuates the existence of predomi
nantly male fields. The third section discusses the effects
of academic and occupation counselling at Stanford. The
Committee's recommendations are summarized at the
end of the report.
The data presented in this report is the result of a
survey of 280 graduating seniors conducted in the Spring
of 1972. The questionnaire, "A Survey of Major and
Occupational Choice," was designed to find out what
fields Stanford undergraduates choose for their studies
and future jobs, and how the University environment
influences their choices. Recipients of the questionnaire
were randomly chosen in groups by sex and the aca
demic field in which they were interested when they
entered Stanford. Data presented here has been weighted
to be representative of the whole graduating class, unless
otherwise indicated. 136 men and 144 women respon
ded to the mailed questionnaire, giving a response rate of
79%. The questionnaire and a discussion of research
procedures are presented in the Appendix.
I. THE NEW STANFORD WOMAN
Occupational Plans of the Class of 1972
Perhaps the most significant finding of the survey of
major and occupational choice is the similarity of the
plans of men and women students. In the past it was
assumed that most Stanford men would become profes
sionals or businessmen while Stanford women would
become housewives, school teachers, and secretaries.
This stereotype used to approximate reality. It is no
longer valid.
In the Stanford class of 1972, a similar proportion of
men and women plan to enter major professions. 69% of
the men and 53% of the women who have a single
definite long-range plan say they will become doctors,
lawyers, college professors and scientists. When this is
generalized to the entire class, (including those who have
vague plans or more than one plan), 28% of senior
women and 30% of senior men are definitely planning to
enter a major profession.
The following table shows the responses of those who
said they had definite long-range occupational plans.
Data representing the plans of the whole population,
including those who are uncertain, shows a very similar
pattern.

N=6B N=B4

It is apparent that the occupational choices of Stan
ford women do not fit into sexual stereotypes. Informa
tion on all the occupations which students considered at
Stanford shows that the women respondents began with
more traditional ideas as freshmen and moved away
from traditional considerations during their time at the
University.
Women and men not only have very similar occupa
tional plans, they also seem to have the same level of
commitment to their occupations and the same expecta
tions of success. As a measure of the seriousness of
occupational intent, students were asked how they had
prepared for their planned future occupations. The same
proportion of women and men said that they had pre
pared themselves by such activities as talking to individ
uals in the occupation, acquiring needed credentials or
training, and finding employment.
Expectations of success were measured by asking
students what ideally would be their occupation or main
activity in five years and what, realistically, they thought

they would be doing. Most students said they would
probably be engaged in their ideal occupations, (71% of
the men and 58% of the women). While fewer women
than men believe they will be engaged in their ideal
occupations, no more women than men think they will
be engaged in lower status occupations. Of those who do
not believe they will be engaged in their ideal occupa
tions, 26% of the men and 28% of the women said they
would probably be engaged in an occupation that vns
lower status than their ideal occupation.
The three most frequently mentioned ideal occupa
tions were medicine, law, and college educator-scientist.

Medical professions 20 22 18 19
Legal professions 15 15 7 7
College educator-scientist 13 12 13 7
N=loB N=l2s

As Table 2 shows, virtually all of the men and women
that aspire to these professions expect to reach their
goals, with the single exception of women who would
like to be college professors or scientists. 12% of the
women hold this ideal but only 7% believe they can
realistically attain it. This is by far the biggest gap
between ideal and realistic assessments for any sex or
occupation. It is interesting that women students have
the least confidence about the occupation to which they
have had the most exposure at Stanford: college profes
sor.
Educational Plans of the Class of 1972
The educational plans of graduating men and women
students are also quite similar. Just as many men as
women plan to go on for further education at some
point in the future, as Table 3 shows.

TABLE 3
Male Female
7c Having definite educational plans 84.5 81.3
% Having uncertain educational plans 4.4 8.5
% Having no further education planned 11.2 10.2
N=l33 N=l44

Approximately the same proportion of men and
women are also going on for graduate study in the next
six months, (54 percent of the men and 49 percent of
the women).
Doctoral and professional programs have traditionally
been filled with men, while women have tended to enter
masters programs. This trend is still apparent with this
year's Stanford graduates, but the gap is closing. 52% of
the women and 74% of the men who said they were
going on for further education are planning to get a
doctorate, or a degree in law or medicine. 41% of the
women and 23% of the men are getting Masters degrees.
The remaining students will be getting technical licenses,
professional B.A.s or certificates of some kind.
A Comparison of Senior Women in 1965 and 1972
The plans of graduating Stanford women have
changed dramatically in the past few years. Data gather
ed on the Class of 1965 by the Institute for the Study of
Human Problems shows striking differences from the
Class of 1972. In "Career and Autonomy in College
Women," Joseph Katz draws the following conclusion:
.. .even in as academically able a group of students
as the Stanford women, the orientation toward
occupational roles is a very "traditional" one, even
though, as we will later see, there is a high valua
tion of the occupational life. .. .the women are
oriented towards family and their biggest occupa
tional aspiration is elementary and secondary
school teaching.
Similar findings have been reported by many other stud
ies of the occupational plans of women students in the
1950s and the early 1960s.
The following table compares the occupational plans
of women graduating in 1965 and 1972, and shows how
much Stanford undergraduates have changed in the past
7 years. The data for the two time periods are not
completely comparable, since different research pro
cedures were used in the two studies. However, the
comparisons between men and women within each time
period are valid.
The table shows a dramatic rise in the proportion of
women interested in the professions, and a sharp de
crease in the proportion who intend to be teachers.
These changes are clear, even though the 1972 data
represents women's most pessimistic estimates of their
future occupations, i.e., their realistic assessments of
what they would be doing in five years, as opposed to
their occupational plans.

In 1965, the ratio of men to women planning to
♦enter professions was 6to 1; in 1972 the ratio is 1.6 to
1. The proportion of women planning to enter elemen
tary and secondary education has decreased from 36% to
10% and the same proportion of men and women now
plan to enter business.
Stanford women have changed their conceptions of
their marital and childbearing roles, as well as their
occupational and education plans. Katz's respondents
were acutely aware of their future roles as wives and
mothers, and most assumed that their occupational goals
would be secondary to their duties to their husbands and
children. 70% of these women said they would not work
at all when their children were under 6 years old, and
only 43% intended to work full time when their children
were over 12 years of age.
Stanford women no longer think along these lines.
The 1972 respondents were not asked directly about
their plans for marriage and childrearing, but the women
were given ample opportunity to mention the future role
of wife and mother. Few women ever mentioned the
topic.
In one series of questions, we asked women what
they were planning to do after graduation, and how long
they planned to continue in that activity. Traditional
patterns led us to expect that a significant proportion of
the women would say they planned to work either until
they had put their husbands through school, or until it
was time to raise children. Only 3% of the women
who were leaving college to work said they would stop
when their husbands had finished school, and only 7%
said they would stop to raise children. Traditional role
expectations still exist at Stanford, but they are the
exception rather than the rule.
This conclusion is also supported by their responses
about "ideal" and "real" future activities. Only 3% of
the women said that, ideally, they would be housewives
in five years and an additional .4% thought that real
istically they would be housewives at that time. In five
years, most of these women will be 26 or 27 years old,
an age at which, in the past, a majority of women
already have small children. However, only 15% of the
women said that they realistically expected childraising
and housework to be a major activity, in addition to
some kind of employment. In all, only 18.5% of the
women mentioned the role of wife and mother as part of
their main activities in the next 5 years.
In sum, the data show that Stanford women have
broken away from traditional stereotypes about "the
woman's role" in the last seven years. Women and men
now have very similar occupational and educational
plans. Women no longer seem to regard a job as "some
thing to fall back on." They take their plans seriously,
and they expect to succeed.
Policy Implications
1. It is important that all members of the Stanford
community — administrators, professors, advisers, and
counsellors — understand the new aspirations of women
undergraduates. The best cure for sex-role stereotypes is
information. For this reason, the findings of this study
should be publicized as widely as possible. We recom
mend that the Dean of Undergraduate Studies and the
Provost take steps to ensure that the findings of this
study are communicated to all professors, advisers,
counsellors and administrators, especially those who
have extensive contact with undergraduates.
2. Stanford University as an institution employing over
7,000 men and women is responsible for setting an
example by eliminating all discriminatory hiring and
promotional practices. The administration should con
tinue to give high priority to its affirmative action ef
forts, and to publicize them as widely as possible.
11. SEX ROLE EXPECTATIONS AND THE STAN
FORD ENVIRONMENT
Knowing that Stanford men and women share sub
stantially the same aspirations, it is important to ask
whether Stanford's treatment of its students is consis
tent with these aspirations. Are Stanford women dis
couraged from entering traditionally male fields and
seeking careers in predominantly male areas? Are they
encouraged to be housewives and school teachers, when
many would prefer to be doctors and professors?
By and large, the answer to these questions appears to
be no. Most women do not believe that they encounter
ed discrimination while they were at Stanford, but a
significant number of Stanford women have been in
fluenced to limit their educational and occupational
choices because of their sex. Most departments and
professors do not discriminate against women; but some
do.
Experience with Discrimination
When asked, "do you feel you have been discouraged
from any academic or occupational goals by a member
of the Stanford community because of your sex?" 29 of
the 128 women who responded said yes. This generalizes
to 23% of all Stanford women. Another 5% of the
women experienced discrimination but were not dis
couraged by it. Most of these women were discouraged
by contacts with faculty members.

In all, almost one-quarter of Stanford women are
discouraged by discrimination. The forms which this
discrimination takes range from explicit discouragement
from a professor to more subtle environmental cues. The
observations of some of the women respondents illus
trate this quite clearly. The following quotations drawn
from survey responses illustrate overt discouragement of
women by their advisers:
Dr. X, a pre-med adviser, had a dim view of the
possibility of women actually making it through
all the work necessary to be a doctor, and later of
her juggling work, children, etc. .. .There were 2
other girls in our advisee group. He said he didn 't
expect to see us the next year.. . .
Not only my major adviser, but several of my
professors in my department failed to offer any
encouragement or assistance and in some cases
actively discouraged me from further study in
mathematics - both when I sought advice and
approval for advanced study and when I sought
assistance and consultation in courses I was taking.
A largely negative reaction (at best, I was ignored)
from male peers in math and science classes was
also quite evident.
My history adviser specifically discouraged me
from going on to grad school. He kept suggesting
high school teaching as "more flexible for a
woman." And he did this even after I took several
courses from him in which I did very well. He even
urged me to take on the honors thesis program.
Other women described comments made by professors
during lectures as a source of discouragement:
I took a class in (chemistry) from Dr. X - a
required course for many med schools. He began
his first lecture by saying there were 2 things he
couldn 't stand — premeds and women who
thought they could be scientists. His actions were
consistent with his prejudices.
One art teacher, XX, believes that women make
better art teachers than artists - his suggestions to
this effect have been to classes as a whole, not to
me individually, but I think that his underlying
sexism affects his relationship with me although he
shows a respect for my work.
Some women found assessments of the employment
situation for women in some fields more discouraging
than helpful:
I have been told of personal experience of the bias
against women in university level teaching. I would
not seek employment as a member of an academic
community (university).
. . .advisers have given me "realistic appraisals
which were very discouraging.
Finally, some women did not describe a direct communi
cation at all, but a sense they had from what was around
them:
It's difficult to be specific - one carries with him
the prejudices; I wish now I had gone pre-med; I
would like to be a doctor but women weren't
doctors; and women didn't go on to be English
professors - I didn 7 look much beyond teaching
- and no one suggested anything else.
Though discouragement has not been overt (ex
cept in a couple of cases where people couldn't
understand why I couldn't be happy teaching in
high school) there is a lot of subtle discourage
ment. 1) The lack of female professors which
really presents a problem in terms of role identity,
2) the number of professors that give only a nega
tive account of their role (Idon't understand why
they're still in it), 3) a disbelief, from both profes
sors and students, that I can combine being a
woman with being a professor, 4) the way I see
female professors now being treated (i.e. difficulty
in obtaining tenure, refusal to see their courses as
anything but "fun" (both professors and stu
dents), insinuations about their teaching ability
and/or intelligence related to sex, etc.).
Policy Implications
Overt discouragement of women wishing to enter
"male" fields and professions should not exist at Stan
ford in 1972. To counter such sexism when it results
from ignorance, an effort should be made to increase
awareness of the fact that women are capable of doing
"male jobs" and succeeding in "male fields," and that
many women do successfully combine professional and
childrearing responsibilities. Any professor or counsellor
who continues to discourage women students because of
their sex should not be asked to advise them. We recom
mend that the Dean of Undergraduate Studies develop a
list of advisers that are particularly interested in working
with women undergraduates. Students should be in
formed that they have the option of choosing someone
from this list to replace their current adviser. In addi
tion, the Dean of Undergraduate Studies should consider
developing procedures by which students can register
complaints if they experience discrimination from their
adviser.
111. CHOICE OF MAJORS
Just as some occupations are usually seen as "men's
jobs" and others as "women's jobs," so some academic
fields are seen as primarily "male" or "female." The
traditional perceptions of appropriate fields for men and
women closely fit the actual proportions of each sex
majoring in these fields at Stanford today. The science
fields have few women, the humanities many more than
their share. Students' changes between majors were
assessed in order to find out if this distribution was due
to interests and orientations acquired before students
entered Stanford, or if the Stanford environment was in
some way encouraging sex-typed choices of major fields.
The results show that students do tend to move into
fields dominated by their own sex while they are at
Stanford. Women more than men switch out of fields
such as Political Science and into fields like English and
Music. More men than women move into fields which
already have a large number of men and out of fields
with a larger proportion s of women. While students are
breaking traditiojn in their careqr N choices, they are per
petuating the, sex-typing of majoi; fields.
. ' \ v v • \ \ \ r •. * > *
of switching between majors, fields
were categorized as cither maje-dominated or non-male
dominated. All fields having less than 25% wom'en'were
, male-dominated, rest,, non-male-dominated.
(j3)S% of, Stanford undergraduates are women.) Male
dominated fields were further divided into science and
non-science fields. Students were asked about the field
ip vyhich' they expressed'an interest time they
were accepted to Stanfo'rd, (referred to as'their
man field of interest"), their first major, and the'major
with which they graduated.
Tn Ihe male-domma'ted sbifcnce fields, Stanford stu
dents appear to bring th v eir sex role stereotypes with
them.'Many mo're freshmen men. than women are inter
ested in these fields; but there is no change towards
greater sexvtyped choice between the freshman and
senior year. "Science fields, retain and attract an equal
proportion of men and women majors.
The fields where Stanford students increasingly make
their choices in terms of sex role stereotypes are the
male dominated, nonscience fields: economics, history,
political science, philosophy, architecture and urban de
sign. Of those students who were interested in these
fields as freshmen, more men than women remained in
these fields until they graduated (60% vs. 53%). More
over, in recruiting new majors, these fields attract many
more men than women. Nonscience male-dominated
fields attract 45% of the men who come to Stanford
interested in non-male-dominated fields, and only 10%
of the women.
Students who come to Stanford without a clear field
of interest seem to be most influenced by pressures to
select a field that is "appropriate" for their sex. The
students who said they were considering both a male
dominated and a non-male-dominated field when they
were accepted to Stanford showed almost no sex-typed
switching. (3% of all freshmen men and 7% of all fresh
men women were in this category.) On the other hand,
the final majors of those who were undecided as entering
freshmen and were not interested in any particular field,
can be almost entirely predicted by sex-typing. 79% of
these men graduated in male-dominated fields, 21% in
non-male-dominated fields. 27% of the undecided
women graduated in male-dominated fields, and 70% in
non-male-dominated fields. (20% of freshmen women
and 26% of freshmen men were undecided.)
The fact that students who come to Stanford with no
idea of what they want to do show the most sex-typed
behavior would seem to indicate that the University
environment influences students to make this kind of
choice. However, when students were asked why they
made the choices they did, such pressures from the
University were not evident. Women were not advised to
shift out of male-dominated fields any more often than
they were encouraged to shift into them. They did not
respond that experienced or anticipated discrimination
was a reason for such shifts, nor did they feel less
capable of succeeding in male-dominated fields. The
reasons which women give for changing majors do not
explain the pattern of sex-typed switching.
Most of the women's sex-typed switching occurred
between the time of their acceptance to Stanford and
•the time they declared their first major (by the end of
their sophomore years). This tendency for sex-typed
major choice to be more frequent in the freshman and
sophomore years has two possible explanations. Stu
dents may act more traditionally when they are younger
or sex-role stereotypes may have been more dominant at
Stanford three and four years ago.
i
Plans for graduate study also show some of the sex
typing. While more students plan graduate study in male

dominated than in non-male-dominated fields, in gen
eral, twice as many men as women do so. 45% of t,he
women and 86% of-the men with definite educational
i plaas, are going on in male-dominpted fields. , , \

Policy Implications ■ > < '. i i i - ! . . •< •„>
The overwhelming predominance' of men iri certain
social science and humanities fields is perpetuated as
women tend to avoid and leave these fields while thtfy
are at Stanford. These departments -*■ economics, his
tory, philosophy, political science, architecture and
urban design — should investigate this situation, looking,
in particular, at their introductory classes. The sciences,
which attract few women students, seem to be dealing
with a phenomenon inherited from the high schools. All
departments with few women majors should make an
effort to attract them. One obvious step in this direction
is to increase the number of women teaching in these
fields.
We recommend that departments with fewer than
25% women majors should experiment with ways of
attracting more women majors (such as distributing writ
ten materials through the Academic Information Center
or encouraging current women majors to discuss the
department's program with other women). These depart
ments should also determine the proportion of women
undergraduates that join and leave their undergraduate
program. Departments may wish to confer with the
Committee on the Employment and Education of
Women about methods for recruiting women, and they
should report their progress to the Committee by the
end of Spring Quarter, 1973.
IV. ACADEMIC AND OCCUPATIONAL COUNSEL
LING
The survey shows that many students find Stanford

services helpful at some point in their undergraduate
careers, but very few feel that Stanford's advisers or
counsellors have affected their occupational plans. Stu
dents were asked specifically about their contacts with
their freshman advisers, academic advisers, and career
counsellors in the placement center. Only a small pro
portion felt that these people had had any effect on
their occupational plans.

Advising and Sex-Roles
One question asked of the data was whether or not
men and womcjri were advised to chodsb fields "appro
priate to their'sex. In only one'case did this trend seem
apparept. There is some indication that the advice of
freshmen advisers reflected sex-role stereotypes. 4 of the
5 students who said they were discouraged by their
freshmen advisers were women and all of the women
were discouraged in male fields. This bias did not appear
ill responses about academic advisers and career counsel
lors. Studtnis tvere' also -asked about' the nature of the
boMattis'with their advisers which affected therin occupa
tional considerations. It is significant that one-quarter of
HHe wtlrti&n 1 whose occupational plans had b&eivaffected
■by l e!dritkets with ah advis'er or counsellor said that the
tridifttibaP hdd disdissed se* discrimination in the area
CoiTside'rihg.' Advisers are most influential as
fol£ rhollels. WhCri students were risked to "check the
statements' which; you feel accurately describe the nature
of 1 the contacts With your'freshman, adviser which affec
ted! ybur occupational consideration,"' the most fre
quently checked response was "Adviser acted as a posi
tive example of Individual in field." "Adviser acted as 1 a
negative example of individual in field" was also checked
frequently, and woijien students found advisers
equally important as role models. It is important to
note, however, that the large majority of these advisers
are men.
Suggestions for Improvements
Students were asked to respond to two open ended
questions about Stanford services: "What services that
Stanford now offers, if any, have been helpful to you in
planning your future:" and "What services which are not
now offered would you find helpful:" 60% of the 136
men answering the questionnaire and 54% of the 144
women mentioned some service at Stanford which had
been helpful to them. (These percentages refer to pro
portion of respondents. They have not been weighted to
represent the whole class.) Those services mentioned
most frequently were the Academic Information Center,
(41 times), the Career Counselling and Placement Cen
ter, (39 times), and the pre-med advising services, (18
times). 51 men and 61 women suggested improvements
in Stanford services. The most frequent target of sugges
tions were the departments, especially among women.
32 women and 15 men said that departments should be
more helpful in planning their futures. Helping students
plan their futures would be a new role for departments.
Only 11 students said their departments had actually
been helpful while they were at Stanford, and most of

the praise resulted from opportunities for practical ex
perience in their fields, not from advice or information
they had received.
Generally, students said they would have liked more
informal, personal contacts with professors, counsellors,
and people in the fields they are considering to give
them a better sense of what they wanted to do in the
future. One student suggested:

a broad, coordinated counselling service, with
competent people who can talk meaningfully
about a variety of occupations and lifestyles those
occupations shape. (Not just an engineering coun
sellor for engineering, an econ adviser for econ,
etc.)
i>i 112 c / . ' ! ; i ) I
Departments were suggested as an alternative source of
information about the employment possibilities stem
ming from a field of study.
A larger proportion of women than men students
have immediate need of career counselling and place
ment services. More of the women are planning to get a
full-time job as soon as they leave Stanford. 29% of the
women and 18% of the men said they expected to be
working full-time in the six months after graduation.
Women also seem to need more help in finding jobs. 26%
of the women who were planning to work full-time after
graduation have already looked for jobs in the area in
which they wanted to work, and only 7% had found
jobs. 18% of the men had looked for employment, and
11% had found jobs. Therefore, it is particularly im
portant for women students that occupational counsel
ling services be improved.
Policy Implications
1. The Career Planning and Placement Center should
make a special effort to help women plan their careers
and find jobs. Since a large number of women are trying
to find jobs in areas where few women have been hired
before, the Placement Center should make aggressive
efforts to place these women.
We recommend that the Career Planning and Place
ment Center report on what activities and what addi
tional staff are required in order to provide better service
to women undergraduates.
2. Women should be prepared to cope with discrimina
tion when they encounter it. We recommend that legal
and practical counselling about dealing with discrimina
tion be made available at the Placement Center.
3. Major department should be involved in occupation
counselling efforts. The experience and contacts of Stan
ford professors remain a largely untapped resource. As
some students suggested, departments should institute
programs in conjunction with the Career Planning and
Placement Center which offer an overview of the occu
pations open to men and women with training in differ
ent academic fields. Women should be well represented
in all such programs.
Wc recommend that each department provide a pro
gram of occupational counselling for its men and women
majors, either on its own or in conjunction with the
Career Planning and Placement Center.
4. Our data shows that advisers and counsellors current
ly discuss the problem of discrimination with their
women students. As several students suggested, this kind
of discussion can often be more discouraging than help
ful. Stanford advisers and counsellors need to be sensi
tive to the fine line between a fatalistic discussion of
discrimination and one that prepares women to meet the
difficulties they will encounter with determination in
stead of with surprise.
We recommend that the Dean of Students Office
develop written material and discussion sessions for ad
visers and counsellors that will orient them to the special
needs of women students.
5. Role modeling is an important function of Stanford
advisers. Yet most Stanford professors are men. There
fore. students have few opportunities to meet successful
professional women and to observe alternative ap
proaches to being a working woman or a working
mother. We recommend that the Dean of Students en
courage the participation of professional women in Uni
versity public functions and in activities at University
residences, until there are more women on the faculty.
Space paid for by News and Publications
Following are the highlights of a report on the Stan
ford woman student in 1972 as compiled by the Com
mittee on the Education and Employment of Women in
the University.
For full copies of the report, please call Nancy
Donham, ext. 4631.
THE STANFORD WOMAN IN 1972
A survey of the senior class of 1972 shows that the
Stanford undergraduate woman has changed remarkably
over the past five years.' She no longer accepts the
traditional roles which society has assigned to her as a
member of the female sex. Graduating men and women
seniors have very similar educational and occupational
aspirations. There is little difference between the propor
tions of women and men who plan to become profes
sionals: doctors, lawyers, college professors, and scien
tists. And the same proportions of men and women plan
to go on for graduate study.
Sex discrimination occurs at Stanford but its inci
dence is limited. Almost one-fourth the graduating seni
or women say they were discouraged from some goal by
sex discrimination while they were at Stanford. And
changes between major fields can to some extent be
predicted by the sex of the student and the traditional
sexual composition of the majors.
This report presents the results of a survey of Stan
ford seniors and makes recommendations on how the
University can end discrimination and provide more op
portunities for women. The first section of the report
considers the educational and occupational plans of men
and women undergraduates in 1972 and in 1965. The
second section concerns sex-role expectations and the
Stanford environment. It discusses women's experiences
of discrimination at Stanford, and the pattern of choos
ing majors which perpetuates the existence of predomi
nantly male fields. The third section discusses the effects
of academic and occupation counselling at Stanford. The
Committee's recommendations are summarized at the
end of the report.
The data presented in this report is the result of a
survey of 280 graduating seniors conducted in the Spring
of 1972. The questionnaire, "A Survey of Major and
Occupational Choice," was designed to find out what
fields Stanford undergraduates choose for their studies
and future jobs, and how the University environment
influences their choices. Recipients of the questionnaire
were randomly chosen in groups by sex and the aca
demic field in which they were interested when they
entered Stanford. Data presented here has been weighted
to be representative of the whole graduating class, unless
otherwise indicated. 136 men and 144 women respon
ded to the mailed questionnaire, giving a response rate of
79%. The questionnaire and a discussion of research
procedures are presented in the Appendix.
I. THE NEW STANFORD WOMAN
Occupational Plans of the Class of 1972
Perhaps the most significant finding of the survey of
major and occupational choice is the similarity of the
plans of men and women students. In the past it was
assumed that most Stanford men would become profes
sionals or businessmen while Stanford women would
become housewives, school teachers, and secretaries.
This stereotype used to approximate reality. It is no
longer valid.
In the Stanford class of 1972, a similar proportion of
men and women plan to enter major professions. 69% of
the men and 53% of the women who have a single
definite long-range plan say they will become doctors,
lawyers, college professors and scientists. When this is
generalized to the entire class, (including those who have
vague plans or more than one plan), 28% of senior
women and 30% of senior men are definitely planning to
enter a major profession.
The following table shows the responses of those who
said they had definite long-range occupational plans.
Data representing the plans of the whole population,
including those who are uncertain, shows a very similar
pattern.

N=6B N=B4

It is apparent that the occupational choices of Stan
ford women do not fit into sexual stereotypes. Informa
tion on all the occupations which students considered at
Stanford shows that the women respondents began with
more traditional ideas as freshmen and moved away
from traditional considerations during their time at the
University.
Women and men not only have very similar occupa
tional plans, they also seem to have the same level of
commitment to their occupations and the same expecta
tions of success. As a measure of the seriousness of
occupational intent, students were asked how they had
prepared for their planned future occupations. The same
proportion of women and men said that they had pre
pared themselves by such activities as talking to individ
uals in the occupation, acquiring needed credentials or
training, and finding employment.
Expectations of success were measured by asking
students what ideally would be their occupation or main
activity in five years and what, realistically, they thought

they would be doing. Most students said they would
probably be engaged in their ideal occupations, (71% of
the men and 58% of the women). While fewer women
than men believe they will be engaged in their ideal
occupations, no more women than men think they will
be engaged in lower status occupations. Of those who do
not believe they will be engaged in their ideal occupa
tions, 26% of the men and 28% of the women said they
would probably be engaged in an occupation that vns
lower status than their ideal occupation.
The three most frequently mentioned ideal occupa
tions were medicine, law, and college educator-scientist.

Medical professions 20 22 18 19
Legal professions 15 15 7 7
College educator-scientist 13 12 13 7
N=loB N=l2s

As Table 2 shows, virtually all of the men and women
that aspire to these professions expect to reach their
goals, with the single exception of women who would
like to be college professors or scientists. 12% of the
women hold this ideal but only 7% believe they can
realistically attain it. This is by far the biggest gap
between ideal and realistic assessments for any sex or
occupation. It is interesting that women students have
the least confidence about the occupation to which they
have had the most exposure at Stanford: college profes
sor.
Educational Plans of the Class of 1972
The educational plans of graduating men and women
students are also quite similar. Just as many men as
women plan to go on for further education at some
point in the future, as Table 3 shows.

TABLE 3
Male Female
7c Having definite educational plans 84.5 81.3
% Having uncertain educational plans 4.4 8.5
% Having no further education planned 11.2 10.2
N=l33 N=l44

Approximately the same proportion of men and
women are also going on for graduate study in the next
six months, (54 percent of the men and 49 percent of
the women).
Doctoral and professional programs have traditionally
been filled with men, while women have tended to enter
masters programs. This trend is still apparent with this
year's Stanford graduates, but the gap is closing. 52% of
the women and 74% of the men who said they were
going on for further education are planning to get a
doctorate, or a degree in law or medicine. 41% of the
women and 23% of the men are getting Masters degrees.
The remaining students will be getting technical licenses,
professional B.A.s or certificates of some kind.
A Comparison of Senior Women in 1965 and 1972
The plans of graduating Stanford women have
changed dramatically in the past few years. Data gather
ed on the Class of 1965 by the Institute for the Study of
Human Problems shows striking differences from the
Class of 1972. In "Career and Autonomy in College
Women," Joseph Katz draws the following conclusion:
.. .even in as academically able a group of students
as the Stanford women, the orientation toward
occupational roles is a very "traditional" one, even
though, as we will later see, there is a high valua
tion of the occupational life. .. .the women are
oriented towards family and their biggest occupa
tional aspiration is elementary and secondary
school teaching.
Similar findings have been reported by many other stud
ies of the occupational plans of women students in the
1950s and the early 1960s.
The following table compares the occupational plans
of women graduating in 1965 and 1972, and shows how
much Stanford undergraduates have changed in the past
7 years. The data for the two time periods are not
completely comparable, since different research pro
cedures were used in the two studies. However, the
comparisons between men and women within each time
period are valid.
The table shows a dramatic rise in the proportion of
women interested in the professions, and a sharp de
crease in the proportion who intend to be teachers.
These changes are clear, even though the 1972 data
represents women's most pessimistic estimates of their
future occupations, i.e., their realistic assessments of
what they would be doing in five years, as opposed to
their occupational plans.

In 1965, the ratio of men to women planning to
♦enter professions was 6to 1; in 1972 the ratio is 1.6 to
1. The proportion of women planning to enter elemen
tary and secondary education has decreased from 36% to
10% and the same proportion of men and women now
plan to enter business.
Stanford women have changed their conceptions of
their marital and childbearing roles, as well as their
occupational and education plans. Katz's respondents
were acutely aware of their future roles as wives and
mothers, and most assumed that their occupational goals
would be secondary to their duties to their husbands and
children. 70% of these women said they would not work
at all when their children were under 6 years old, and
only 43% intended to work full time when their children
were over 12 years of age.
Stanford women no longer think along these lines.
The 1972 respondents were not asked directly about
their plans for marriage and childrearing, but the women
were given ample opportunity to mention the future role
of wife and mother. Few women ever mentioned the
topic.
In one series of questions, we asked women what
they were planning to do after graduation, and how long
they planned to continue in that activity. Traditional
patterns led us to expect that a significant proportion of
the women would say they planned to work either until
they had put their husbands through school, or until it
was time to raise children. Only 3% of the women
who were leaving college to work said they would stop
when their husbands had finished school, and only 7%
said they would stop to raise children. Traditional role
expectations still exist at Stanford, but they are the
exception rather than the rule.
This conclusion is also supported by their responses
about "ideal" and "real" future activities. Only 3% of
the women said that, ideally, they would be housewives
in five years and an additional .4% thought that real
istically they would be housewives at that time. In five
years, most of these women will be 26 or 27 years old,
an age at which, in the past, a majority of women
already have small children. However, only 15% of the
women said that they realistically expected childraising
and housework to be a major activity, in addition to
some kind of employment. In all, only 18.5% of the
women mentioned the role of wife and mother as part of
their main activities in the next 5 years.
In sum, the data show that Stanford women have
broken away from traditional stereotypes about "the
woman's role" in the last seven years. Women and men
now have very similar occupational and educational
plans. Women no longer seem to regard a job as "some
thing to fall back on." They take their plans seriously,
and they expect to succeed.
Policy Implications
1. It is important that all members of the Stanford
community — administrators, professors, advisers, and
counsellors — understand the new aspirations of women
undergraduates. The best cure for sex-role stereotypes is
information. For this reason, the findings of this study
should be publicized as widely as possible. We recom
mend that the Dean of Undergraduate Studies and the
Provost take steps to ensure that the findings of this
study are communicated to all professors, advisers,
counsellors and administrators, especially those who
have extensive contact with undergraduates.
2. Stanford University as an institution employing over
7,000 men and women is responsible for setting an
example by eliminating all discriminatory hiring and
promotional practices. The administration should con
tinue to give high priority to its affirmative action ef
forts, and to publicize them as widely as possible.
11. SEX ROLE EXPECTATIONS AND THE STAN
FORD ENVIRONMENT
Knowing that Stanford men and women share sub
stantially the same aspirations, it is important to ask
whether Stanford's treatment of its students is consis
tent with these aspirations. Are Stanford women dis
couraged from entering traditionally male fields and
seeking careers in predominantly male areas? Are they
encouraged to be housewives and school teachers, when
many would prefer to be doctors and professors?
By and large, the answer to these questions appears to
be no. Most women do not believe that they encounter
ed discrimination while they were at Stanford, but a
significant number of Stanford women have been in
fluenced to limit their educational and occupational
choices because of their sex. Most departments and
professors do not discriminate against women; but some
do.
Experience with Discrimination
When asked, "do you feel you have been discouraged
from any academic or occupational goals by a member
of the Stanford community because of your sex?" 29 of
the 128 women who responded said yes. This generalizes
to 23% of all Stanford women. Another 5% of the
women experienced discrimination but were not dis
couraged by it. Most of these women were discouraged
by contacts with faculty members.

N=2oB N=46o N=l22 N=lll

In all, almost one-quarter of Stanford women are
discouraged by discrimination. The forms which this
discrimination takes range from explicit discouragement
from a professor to more subtle environmental cues. The
observations of some of the women respondents illus
trate this quite clearly. The following quotations drawn
from survey responses illustrate overt discouragement of
women by their advisers:
Dr. X, a pre-med adviser, had a dim view of the
possibility of women actually making it through
all the work necessary to be a doctor, and later of
her juggling work, children, etc. .. .There were 2
other girls in our advisee group. He said he didn 't
expect to see us the next year.. . .
Not only my major adviser, but several of my
professors in my department failed to offer any
encouragement or assistance and in some cases
actively discouraged me from further study in
mathematics - both when I sought advice and
approval for advanced study and when I sought
assistance and consultation in courses I was taking.
A largely negative reaction (at best, I was ignored)
from male peers in math and science classes was
also quite evident.
My history adviser specifically discouraged me
from going on to grad school. He kept suggesting
high school teaching as "more flexible for a
woman." And he did this even after I took several
courses from him in which I did very well. He even
urged me to take on the honors thesis program.
Other women described comments made by professors
during lectures as a source of discouragement:
I took a class in (chemistry) from Dr. X - a
required course for many med schools. He began
his first lecture by saying there were 2 things he
couldn 't stand — premeds and women who
thought they could be scientists. His actions were
consistent with his prejudices.
One art teacher, XX, believes that women make
better art teachers than artists - his suggestions to
this effect have been to classes as a whole, not to
me individually, but I think that his underlying
sexism affects his relationship with me although he
shows a respect for my work.
Some women found assessments of the employment
situation for women in some fields more discouraging
than helpful:
I have been told of personal experience of the bias
against women in university level teaching. I would
not seek employment as a member of an academic
community (university).
. . .advisers have given me "realistic appraisals
which were very discouraging.
Finally, some women did not describe a direct communi
cation at all, but a sense they had from what was around
them:
It's difficult to be specific - one carries with him
the prejudices; I wish now I had gone pre-med; I
would like to be a doctor but women weren't
doctors; and women didn't go on to be English
professors - I didn 7 look much beyond teaching
- and no one suggested anything else.
Though discouragement has not been overt (ex
cept in a couple of cases where people couldn't
understand why I couldn't be happy teaching in
high school) there is a lot of subtle discourage
ment. 1) The lack of female professors which
really presents a problem in terms of role identity,
2) the number of professors that give only a nega
tive account of their role (Idon't understand why
they're still in it), 3) a disbelief, from both profes
sors and students, that I can combine being a
woman with being a professor, 4) the way I see
female professors now being treated (i.e. difficulty
in obtaining tenure, refusal to see their courses as
anything but "fun" (both professors and stu
dents), insinuations about their teaching ability
and/or intelligence related to sex, etc.).
Policy Implications
Overt discouragement of women wishing to enter
"male" fields and professions should not exist at Stan
ford in 1972. To counter such sexism when it results
from ignorance, an effort should be made to increase
awareness of the fact that women are capable of doing
"male jobs" and succeeding in "male fields," and that
many women do successfully combine professional and
childrearing responsibilities. Any professor or counsellor
who continues to discourage women students because of
their sex should not be asked to advise them. We recom
mend that the Dean of Undergraduate Studies develop a
list of advisers that are particularly interested in working
with women undergraduates. Students should be in
formed that they have the option of choosing someone
from this list to replace their current adviser. In addi
tion, the Dean of Undergraduate Studies should consider
developing procedures by which students can register
complaints if they experience discrimination from their
adviser.
111. CHOICE OF MAJORS
Just as some occupations are usually seen as "men's
jobs" and others as "women's jobs," so some academic
fields are seen as primarily "male" or "female." The
traditional perceptions of appropriate fields for men and
women closely fit the actual proportions of each sex
majoring in these fields at Stanford today. The science
fields have few women, the humanities many more than
their share. Students' changes between majors were
assessed in order to find out if this distribution was due
to interests and orientations acquired before students
entered Stanford, or if the Stanford environment was in
some way encouraging sex-typed choices of major fields.
The results show that students do tend to move into
fields dominated by their own sex while they are at
Stanford. Women more than men switch out of fields
such as Political Science and into fields like English and
Music. More men than women move into fields which
already have a large number of men and out of fields
with a larger proportion s of women. While students are
breaking traditiojn in their careqr N choices, they are per
petuating the, sex-typing of majoi; fields.
. ' \ v v • \ \ \ r •. * > *
of switching between majors, fields
were categorized as cither maje-dominated or non-male
dominated. All fields having less than 25% wom'en'were
, male-dominated, rest,, non-male-dominated.
(j3)S% of, Stanford undergraduates are women.) Male
dominated fields were further divided into science and
non-science fields. Students were asked about the field
ip vyhich' they expressed'an interest time they
were accepted to Stanfo'rd, (referred to as'their
man field of interest"), their first major, and the'major
with which they graduated.
Tn Ihe male-domma'ted sbifcnce fields, Stanford stu
dents appear to bring th v eir sex role stereotypes with
them.'Many mo're freshmen men. than women are inter
ested in these fields; but there is no change towards
greater sexvtyped choice between the freshman and
senior year. "Science fields, retain and attract an equal
proportion of men and women majors.
The fields where Stanford students increasingly make
their choices in terms of sex role stereotypes are the
male dominated, nonscience fields: economics, history,
political science, philosophy, architecture and urban de
sign. Of those students who were interested in these
fields as freshmen, more men than women remained in
these fields until they graduated (60% vs. 53%). More
over, in recruiting new majors, these fields attract many
more men than women. Nonscience male-dominated
fields attract 45% of the men who come to Stanford
interested in non-male-dominated fields, and only 10%
of the women.
Students who come to Stanford without a clear field
of interest seem to be most influenced by pressures to
select a field that is "appropriate" for their sex. The
students who said they were considering both a male
dominated and a non-male-dominated field when they
were accepted to Stanford showed almost no sex-typed
switching. (3% of all freshmen men and 7% of all fresh
men women were in this category.) On the other hand,
the final majors of those who were undecided as entering
freshmen and were not interested in any particular field,
can be almost entirely predicted by sex-typing. 79% of
these men graduated in male-dominated fields, 21% in
non-male-dominated fields. 27% of the undecided
women graduated in male-dominated fields, and 70% in
non-male-dominated fields. (20% of freshmen women
and 26% of freshmen men were undecided.)
The fact that students who come to Stanford with no
idea of what they want to do show the most sex-typed
behavior would seem to indicate that the University
environment influences students to make this kind of
choice. However, when students were asked why they
made the choices they did, such pressures from the
University were not evident. Women were not advised to
shift out of male-dominated fields any more often than
they were encouraged to shift into them. They did not
respond that experienced or anticipated discrimination
was a reason for such shifts, nor did they feel less
capable of succeeding in male-dominated fields. The
reasons which women give for changing majors do not
explain the pattern of sex-typed switching.
Most of the women's sex-typed switching occurred
between the time of their acceptance to Stanford and
•the time they declared their first major (by the end of
their sophomore years). This tendency for sex-typed
major choice to be more frequent in the freshman and
sophomore years has two possible explanations. Stu
dents may act more traditionally when they are younger
or sex-role stereotypes may have been more dominant at
Stanford three and four years ago.
i
Plans for graduate study also show some of the sex
typing. While more students plan graduate study in male

dominated than in non-male-dominated fields, in gen
eral, twice as many men as women do so. 45% of t,he
women and 86% of-the men with definite educational
i plaas, are going on in male-dominpted fields. , , \

Policy Implications ■ > < '. i i i - ! . . •< •„>
The overwhelming predominance' of men iri certain
social science and humanities fields is perpetuated as
women tend to avoid and leave these fields while thtfy
are at Stanford. These departments -*■ economics, his
tory, philosophy, political science, architecture and
urban design — should investigate this situation, looking,
in particular, at their introductory classes. The sciences,
which attract few women students, seem to be dealing
with a phenomenon inherited from the high schools. All
departments with few women majors should make an
effort to attract them. One obvious step in this direction
is to increase the number of women teaching in these
fields.
We recommend that departments with fewer than
25% women majors should experiment with ways of
attracting more women majors (such as distributing writ
ten materials through the Academic Information Center
or encouraging current women majors to discuss the
department's program with other women). These depart
ments should also determine the proportion of women
undergraduates that join and leave their undergraduate
program. Departments may wish to confer with the
Committee on the Employment and Education of
Women about methods for recruiting women, and they
should report their progress to the Committee by the
end of Spring Quarter, 1973.
IV. ACADEMIC AND OCCUPATIONAL COUNSEL
LING
The survey shows that many students find Stanford

services helpful at some point in their undergraduate
careers, but very few feel that Stanford's advisers or
counsellors have affected their occupational plans. Stu
dents were asked specifically about their contacts with
their freshman advisers, academic advisers, and career
counsellors in the placement center. Only a small pro
portion felt that these people had had any effect on
their occupational plans.

Advising and Sex-Roles
One question asked of the data was whether or not
men and womcjri were advised to chodsb fields "appro
priate to their'sex. In only one'case did this trend seem
apparept. There is some indication that the advice of
freshmen advisers reflected sex-role stereotypes. 4 of the
5 students who said they were discouraged by their
freshmen advisers were women and all of the women
were discouraged in male fields. This bias did not appear
ill responses about academic advisers and career counsel
lors. Studtnis tvere' also -asked about' the nature of the
boMattis'with their advisers which affected therin occupa
tional considerations. It is significant that one-quarter of
HHe wtlrti&n 1 whose occupational plans had b&eivaffected
■by l e!dritkets with ah advis'er or counsellor said that the
tridifttibaP hdd disdissed se* discrimination in the area
CoiTside'rihg.' Advisers are most influential as
fol£ rhollels. WhCri students were risked to "check the
statements' which; you feel accurately describe the nature
of 1 the contacts With your'freshman, adviser which affec
ted! ybur occupational consideration,"' the most fre
quently checked response was "Adviser acted as a posi
tive example of Individual in field." "Adviser acted as 1 a
negative example of individual in field" was also checked
frequently, and woijien students found advisers
equally important as role models. It is important to
note, however, that the large majority of these advisers
are men.
Suggestions for Improvements
Students were asked to respond to two open ended
questions about Stanford services: "What services that
Stanford now offers, if any, have been helpful to you in
planning your future:" and "What services which are not
now offered would you find helpful:" 60% of the 136
men answering the questionnaire and 54% of the 144
women mentioned some service at Stanford which had
been helpful to them. (These percentages refer to pro
portion of respondents. They have not been weighted to
represent the whole class.) Those services mentioned
most frequently were the Academic Information Center,
(41 times), the Career Counselling and Placement Cen
ter, (39 times), and the pre-med advising services, (18
times). 51 men and 61 women suggested improvements
in Stanford services. The most frequent target of sugges
tions were the departments, especially among women.
32 women and 15 men said that departments should be
more helpful in planning their futures. Helping students
plan their futures would be a new role for departments.
Only 11 students said their departments had actually
been helpful while they were at Stanford, and most of

the praise resulted from opportunities for practical ex
perience in their fields, not from advice or information
they had received.
Generally, students said they would have liked more
informal, personal contacts with professors, counsellors,
and people in the fields they are considering to give
them a better sense of what they wanted to do in the
future. One student suggested:

a broad, coordinated counselling service, with
competent people who can talk meaningfully
about a variety of occupations and lifestyles those
occupations shape. (Not just an engineering coun
sellor for engineering, an econ adviser for econ,
etc.)
i>i 112 c / . ' ! ; i ) I
Departments were suggested as an alternative source of
information about the employment possibilities stem
ming from a field of study.
A larger proportion of women than men students
have immediate need of career counselling and place
ment services. More of the women are planning to get a
full-time job as soon as they leave Stanford. 29% of the
women and 18% of the men said they expected to be
working full-time in the six months after graduation.
Women also seem to need more help in finding jobs. 26%
of the women who were planning to work full-time after
graduation have already looked for jobs in the area in
which they wanted to work, and only 7% had found
jobs. 18% of the men had looked for employment, and
11% had found jobs. Therefore, it is particularly im
portant for women students that occupational counsel
ling services be improved.
Policy Implications
1. The Career Planning and Placement Center should
make a special effort to help women plan their careers
and find jobs. Since a large number of women are trying
to find jobs in areas where few women have been hired
before, the Placement Center should make aggressive
efforts to place these women.
We recommend that the Career Planning and Place
ment Center report on what activities and what addi
tional staff are required in order to provide better service
to women undergraduates.
2. Women should be prepared to cope with discrimina
tion when they encounter it. We recommend that legal
and practical counselling about dealing with discrimina
tion be made available at the Placement Center.
3. Major department should be involved in occupation
counselling efforts. The experience and contacts of Stan
ford professors remain a largely untapped resource. As
some students suggested, departments should institute
programs in conjunction with the Career Planning and
Placement Center which offer an overview of the occu
pations open to men and women with training in differ
ent academic fields. Women should be well represented
in all such programs.
Wc recommend that each department provide a pro
gram of occupational counselling for its men and women
majors, either on its own or in conjunction with the
Career Planning and Placement Center.
4. Our data shows that advisers and counsellors current
ly discuss the problem of discrimination with their
women students. As several students suggested, this kind
of discussion can often be more discouraging than help
ful. Stanford advisers and counsellors need to be sensi
tive to the fine line between a fatalistic discussion of
discrimination and one that prepares women to meet the
difficulties they will encounter with determination in
stead of with surprise.
We recommend that the Dean of Students Office
develop written material and discussion sessions for ad
visers and counsellors that will orient them to the special
needs of women students.
5. Role modeling is an important function of Stanford
advisers. Yet most Stanford professors are men. There
fore. students have few opportunities to meet successful
professional women and to observe alternative ap
proaches to being a working woman or a working
mother. We recommend that the Dean of Students en
courage the participation of professional women in Uni
versity public functions and in activities at University
residences, until there are more women on the faculty.
Space paid for by News and Publications
Following are the highlights of a report on the Stan
ford woman student in 1972 as compiled by the Com
mittee on the Education and Employment of Women in
the University.
For full copies of the report, please call Nancy
Donham, ext. 4631.
THE STANFORD WOMAN IN 1972
A survey of the senior class of 1972 shows that the
Stanford undergraduate woman has changed remarkably
over the past five years.' She no longer accepts the
traditional roles which society has assigned to her as a
member of the female sex. Graduating men and women
seniors have very similar educational and occupational
aspirations. There is little difference between the propor
tions of women and men who plan to become profes
sionals: doctors, lawyers, college professors, and scien
tists. And the same proportions of men and women plan
to go on for graduate study.
Sex discrimination occurs at Stanford but its inci
dence is limited. Almost one-fourth the graduating seni
or women say they were discouraged from some goal by
sex discrimination while they were at Stanford. And
changes between major fields can to some extent be
predicted by the sex of the student and the traditional
sexual composition of the majors.
This report presents the results of a survey of Stan
ford seniors and makes recommendations on how the
University can end discrimination and provide more op
portunities for women. The first section of the report
considers the educational and occupational plans of men
and women undergraduates in 1972 and in 1965. The
second section concerns sex-role expectations and the
Stanford environment. It discusses women's experiences
of discrimination at Stanford, and the pattern of choos
ing majors which perpetuates the existence of predomi
nantly male fields. The third section discusses the effects
of academic and occupation counselling at Stanford. The
Committee's recommendations are summarized at the
end of the report.
The data presented in this report is the result of a
survey of 280 graduating seniors conducted in the Spring
of 1972. The questionnaire, "A Survey of Major and
Occupational Choice," was designed to find out what
fields Stanford undergraduates choose for their studies
and future jobs, and how the University environment
influences their choices. Recipients of the questionnaire
were randomly chosen in groups by sex and the aca
demic field in which they were interested when they
entered Stanford. Data presented here has been weighted
to be representative of the whole graduating class, unless
otherwise indicated. 136 men and 144 women respon
ded to the mailed questionnaire, giving a response rate of
79%. The questionnaire and a discussion of research
procedures are presented in the Appendix.
I. THE NEW STANFORD WOMAN
Occupational Plans of the Class of 1972
Perhaps the most significant finding of the survey of
major and occupational choice is the similarity of the
plans of men and women students. In the past it was
assumed that most Stanford men would become profes
sionals or businessmen while Stanford women would
become housewives, school teachers, and secretaries.
This stereotype used to approximate reality. It is no
longer valid.
In the Stanford class of 1972, a similar proportion of
men and women plan to enter major professions. 69% of
the men and 53% of the women who have a single
definite long-range plan say they will become doctors,
lawyers, college professors and scientists. When this is
generalized to the entire class, (including those who have
vague plans or more than one plan), 28% of senior
women and 30% of senior men are definitely planning to
enter a major profession.
The following table shows the responses of those who
said they had definite long-range occupational plans.
Data representing the plans of the whole population,
including those who are uncertain, shows a very similar
pattern.

N=6B N=B4

It is apparent that the occupational choices of Stan
ford women do not fit into sexual stereotypes. Informa
tion on all the occupations which students considered at
Stanford shows that the women respondents began with
more traditional ideas as freshmen and moved away
from traditional considerations during their time at the
University.
Women and men not only have very similar occupa
tional plans, they also seem to have the same level of
commitment to their occupations and the same expecta
tions of success. As a measure of the seriousness of
occupational intent, students were asked how they had
prepared for their planned future occupations. The same
proportion of women and men said that they had pre
pared themselves by such activities as talking to individ
uals in the occupation, acquiring needed credentials or
training, and finding employment.
Expectations of success were measured by asking
students what ideally would be their occupation or main
activity in five years and what, realistically, they thought

they would be doing. Most students said they would
probably be engaged in their ideal occupations, (71% of
the men and 58% of the women). While fewer women
than men believe they will be engaged in their ideal
occupations, no more women than men think they will
be engaged in lower status occupations. Of those who do
not believe they will be engaged in their ideal occupa
tions, 26% of the men and 28% of the women said they
would probably be engaged in an occupation that vns
lower status than their ideal occupation.
The three most frequently mentioned ideal occupa
tions were medicine, law, and college educator-scientist.

Medical professions 20 22 18 19
Legal professions 15 15 7 7
College educator-scientist 13 12 13 7
N=loB N=l2s

As Table 2 shows, virtually all of the men and women
that aspire to these professions expect to reach their
goals, with the single exception of women who would
like to be college professors or scientists. 12% of the
women hold this ideal but only 7% believe they can
realistically attain it. This is by far the biggest gap
between ideal and realistic assessments for any sex or
occupation. It is interesting that women students have
the least confidence about the occupation to which they
have had the most exposure at Stanford: college profes
sor.
Educational Plans of the Class of 1972
The educational plans of graduating men and women
students are also quite similar. Just as many men as
women plan to go on for further education at some
point in the future, as Table 3 shows.

TABLE 3
Male Female
7c Having definite educational plans 84.5 81.3
% Having uncertain educational plans 4.4 8.5
% Having no further education planned 11.2 10.2
N=l33 N=l44

Approximately the same proportion of men and
women are also going on for graduate study in the next
six months, (54 percent of the men and 49 percent of
the women).
Doctoral and professional programs have traditionally
been filled with men, while women have tended to enter
masters programs. This trend is still apparent with this
year's Stanford graduates, but the gap is closing. 52% of
the women and 74% of the men who said they were
going on for further education are planning to get a
doctorate, or a degree in law or medicine. 41% of the
women and 23% of the men are getting Masters degrees.
The remaining students will be getting technical licenses,
professional B.A.s or certificates of some kind.
A Comparison of Senior Women in 1965 and 1972
The plans of graduating Stanford women have
changed dramatically in the past few years. Data gather
ed on the Class of 1965 by the Institute for the Study of
Human Problems shows striking differences from the
Class of 1972. In "Career and Autonomy in College
Women," Joseph Katz draws the following conclusion:
.. .even in as academically able a group of students
as the Stanford women, the orientation toward
occupational roles is a very "traditional" one, even
though, as we will later see, there is a high valua
tion of the occupational life. .. .the women are
oriented towards family and their biggest occupa
tional aspiration is elementary and secondary
school teaching.
Similar findings have been reported by many other stud
ies of the occupational plans of women students in the
1950s and the early 1960s.
The following table compares the occupational plans
of women graduating in 1965 and 1972, and shows how
much Stanford undergraduates have changed in the past
7 years. The data for the two time periods are not
completely comparable, since different research pro
cedures were used in the two studies. However, the
comparisons between men and women within each time
period are valid.
The table shows a dramatic rise in the proportion of
women interested in the professions, and a sharp de
crease in the proportion who intend to be teachers.
These changes are clear, even though the 1972 data
represents women's most pessimistic estimates of their
future occupations, i.e., their realistic assessments of
what they would be doing in five years, as opposed to
their occupational plans.

In 1965, the ratio of men to women planning to
♦enter professions was 6to 1; in 1972 the ratio is 1.6 to
1. The proportion of women planning to enter elemen
tary and secondary education has decreased from 36% to
10% and the same proportion of men and women now
plan to enter business.
Stanford women have changed their conceptions of
their marital and childbearing roles, as well as their
occupational and education plans. Katz's respondents
were acutely aware of their future roles as wives and
mothers, and most assumed that their occupational goals
would be secondary to their duties to their husbands and
children. 70% of these women said they would not work
at all when their children were under 6 years old, and
only 43% intended to work full time when their children
were over 12 years of age.
Stanford women no longer think along these lines.
The 1972 respondents were not asked directly about
their plans for marriage and childrearing, but the women
were given ample opportunity to mention the future role
of wife and mother. Few women ever mentioned the
topic.
In one series of questions, we asked women what
they were planning to do after graduation, and how long
they planned to continue in that activity. Traditional
patterns led us to expect that a significant proportion of
the women would say they planned to work either until
they had put their husbands through school, or until it
was time to raise children. Only 3% of the women
who were leaving college to work said they would stop
when their husbands had finished school, and only 7%
said they would stop to raise children. Traditional role
expectations still exist at Stanford, but they are the
exception rather than the rule.
This conclusion is also supported by their responses
about "ideal" and "real" future activities. Only 3% of
the women said that, ideally, they would be housewives
in five years and an additional .4% thought that real
istically they would be housewives at that time. In five
years, most of these women will be 26 or 27 years old,
an age at which, in the past, a majority of women
already have small children. However, only 15% of the
women said that they realistically expected childraising
and housework to be a major activity, in addition to
some kind of employment. In all, only 18.5% of the
women mentioned the role of wife and mother as part of
their main activities in the next 5 years.
In sum, the data show that Stanford women have
broken away from traditional stereotypes about "the
woman's role" in the last seven years. Women and men
now have very similar occupational and educational
plans. Women no longer seem to regard a job as "some
thing to fall back on." They take their plans seriously,
and they expect to succeed.
Policy Implications
1. It is important that all members of the Stanford
community — administrators, professors, advisers, and
counsellors — understand the new aspirations of women
undergraduates. The best cure for sex-role stereotypes is
information. For this reason, the findings of this study
should be publicized as widely as possible. We recom
mend that the Dean of Undergraduate Studies and the
Provost take steps to ensure that the findings of this
study are communicated to all professors, advisers,
counsellors and administrators, especially those who
have extensive contact with undergraduates.
2. Stanford University as an institution employing over
7,000 men and women is responsible for setting an
example by eliminating all discriminatory hiring and
promotional practices. The administration should con
tinue to give high priority to its affirmative action ef
forts, and to publicize them as widely as possible.
11. SEX ROLE EXPECTATIONS AND THE STAN
FORD ENVIRONMENT
Knowing that Stanford men and women share sub
stantially the same aspirations, it is important to ask
whether Stanford's treatment of its students is consis
tent with these aspirations. Are Stanford women dis
couraged from entering traditionally male fields and
seeking careers in predominantly male areas? Are they
encouraged to be housewives and school teachers, when
many would prefer to be doctors and professors?
By and large, the answer to these questions appears to
be no. Most women do not believe that they encounter
ed discrimination while they were at Stanford, but a
significant number of Stanford women have been in
fluenced to limit their educational and occupational
choices because of their sex. Most departments and
professors do not discriminate against women; but some
do.
Experience with Discrimination
When asked, "do you feel you have been discouraged
from any academic or occupational goals by a member
of the Stanford community because of your sex?" 29 of
the 128 women who responded said yes. This generalizes
to 23% of all Stanford women. Another 5% of the
women experienced discrimination but were not dis
couraged by it. Most of these women were discouraged
by contacts with faculty members.

In all, almost one-quarter of Stanford women are
discouraged by discrimination. The forms which this
discrimination takes range from explicit discouragement
from a professor to more subtle environmental cues. The
observations of some of the women respondents illus
trate this quite clearly. The following quotations drawn
from survey responses illustrate overt discouragement of
women by their advisers:
Dr. X, a pre-med adviser, had a dim view of the
possibility of women actually making it through
all the work necessary to be a doctor, and later of
her juggling work, children, etc. .. .There were 2
other girls in our advisee group. He said he didn 't
expect to see us the next year.. . .
Not only my major adviser, but several of my
professors in my department failed to offer any
encouragement or assistance and in some cases
actively discouraged me from further study in
mathematics - both when I sought advice and
approval for advanced study and when I sought
assistance and consultation in courses I was taking.
A largely negative reaction (at best, I was ignored)
from male peers in math and science classes was
also quite evident.
My history adviser specifically discouraged me
from going on to grad school. He kept suggesting
high school teaching as "more flexible for a
woman." And he did this even after I took several
courses from him in which I did very well. He even
urged me to take on the honors thesis program.
Other women described comments made by professors
during lectures as a source of discouragement:
I took a class in (chemistry) from Dr. X - a
required course for many med schools. He began
his first lecture by saying there were 2 things he
couldn 't stand — premeds and women who
thought they could be scientists. His actions were
consistent with his prejudices.
One art teacher, XX, believes that women make
better art teachers than artists - his suggestions to
this effect have been to classes as a whole, not to
me individually, but I think that his underlying
sexism affects his relationship with me although he
shows a respect for my work.
Some women found assessments of the employment
situation for women in some fields more discouraging
than helpful:
I have been told of personal experience of the bias
against women in university level teaching. I would
not seek employment as a member of an academic
community (university).
. . .advisers have given me "realistic appraisals
which were very discouraging.
Finally, some women did not describe a direct communi
cation at all, but a sense they had from what was around
them:
It's difficult to be specific - one carries with him
the prejudices; I wish now I had gone pre-med; I
would like to be a doctor but women weren't
doctors; and women didn't go on to be English
professors - I didn 7 look much beyond teaching
- and no one suggested anything else.
Though discouragement has not been overt (ex
cept in a couple of cases where people couldn't
understand why I couldn't be happy teaching in
high school) there is a lot of subtle discourage
ment. 1) The lack of female professors which
really presents a problem in terms of role identity,
2) the number of professors that give only a nega
tive account of their role (Idon't understand why
they're still in it), 3) a disbelief, from both profes
sors and students, that I can combine being a
woman with being a professor, 4) the way I see
female professors now being treated (i.e. difficulty
in obtaining tenure, refusal to see their courses as
anything but "fun" (both professors and stu
dents), insinuations about their teaching ability
and/or intelligence related to sex, etc.).
Policy Implications
Overt discouragement of women wishing to enter
"male" fields and professions should not exist at Stan
ford in 1972. To counter such sexism when it results
from ignorance, an effort should be made to increase
awareness of the fact that women are capable of doing
"male jobs" and succeeding in "male fields," and that
many women do successfully combine professional and
childrearing responsibilities. Any professor or counsellor
who continues to discourage women students because of
their sex should not be asked to advise them. We recom
mend that the Dean of Undergraduate Studies develop a
list of advisers that are particularly interested in working
with women undergraduates. Students should be in
formed that they have the option of choosing someone
from this list to replace their current adviser. In addi
tion, the Dean of Undergraduate Studies should consider
developing procedures by which students can register
complaints if they experience discrimination from their
adviser.
111. CHOICE OF MAJORS
Just as some occupations are usually seen as "men's
jobs" and others as "women's jobs," so some academic
fields are seen as primarily "male" or "female." The
traditional perceptions of appropriate fields for men and
women closely fit the actual proportions of each sex
majoring in these fields at Stanford today. The science
fields have few women, the humanities many more than
their share. Students' changes between majors were
assessed in order to find out if this distribution was due
to interests and orientations acquired before students
entered Stanford, or if the Stanford environment was in
some way encouraging sex-typed choices of major fields.
The results show that students do tend to move into
fields dominated by their own sex while they are at
Stanford. Women more than men switch out of fields
such as Political Science and into fields like English and
Music. More men than women move into fields which
already have a large number of men and out of fields
with a larger proportion s of women. While students are
breaking traditiojn in their careqr N choices, they are per
petuating the, sex-typing of majoi; fields.
. ' \ v v • \ \ \ r •. * > *
of switching between majors, fields
were categorized as cither maje-dominated or non-male
dominated. All fields having less than 25% wom'en'were
, male-dominated, rest,, non-male-dominated.
(j3)S% of, Stanford undergraduates are women.) Male
dominated fields were further divided into science and
non-science fields. Students were asked about the field
ip vyhich' they expressed'an interest time they
were accepted to Stanfo'rd, (referred to as'their
man field of interest"), their first major, and the'major
with which they graduated.
Tn Ihe male-domma'ted sbifcnce fields, Stanford stu
dents appear to bring th v eir sex role stereotypes with
them.'Many mo're freshmen men. than women are inter
ested in these fields; but there is no change towards
greater sexvtyped choice between the freshman and
senior year. "Science fields, retain and attract an equal
proportion of men and women majors.
The fields where Stanford students increasingly make
their choices in terms of sex role stereotypes are the
male dominated, nonscience fields: economics, history,
political science, philosophy, architecture and urban de
sign. Of those students who were interested in these
fields as freshmen, more men than women remained in
these fields until they graduated (60% vs. 53%). More
over, in recruiting new majors, these fields attract many
more men than women. Nonscience male-dominated
fields attract 45% of the men who come to Stanford
interested in non-male-dominated fields, and only 10%
of the women.
Students who come to Stanford without a clear field
of interest seem to be most influenced by pressures to
select a field that is "appropriate" for their sex. The
students who said they were considering both a male
dominated and a non-male-dominated field when they
were accepted to Stanford showed almost no sex-typed
switching. (3% of all freshmen men and 7% of all fresh
men women were in this category.) On the other hand,
the final majors of those who were undecided as entering
freshmen and were not interested in any particular field,
can be almost entirely predicted by sex-typing. 79% of
these men graduated in male-dominated fields, 21% in
non-male-dominated fields. 27% of the undecided
women graduated in male-dominated fields, and 70% in
non-male-dominated fields. (20% of freshmen women
and 26% of freshmen men were undecided.)
The fact that students who come to Stanford with no
idea of what they want to do show the most sex-typed
behavior would seem to indicate that the University
environment influences students to make this kind of
choice. However, when students were asked why they
made the choices they did, such pressures from the
University were not evident. Women were not advised to
shift out of male-dominated fields any more often than
they were encouraged to shift into them. They did not
respond that experienced or anticipated discrimination
was a reason for such shifts, nor did they feel less
capable of succeeding in male-dominated fields. The
reasons which women give for changing majors do not
explain the pattern of sex-typed switching.
Most of the women's sex-typed switching occurred
between the time of their acceptance to Stanford and
•the time they declared their first major (by the end of
their sophomore years). This tendency for sex-typed
major choice to be more frequent in the freshman and
sophomore years has two possible explanations. Stu
dents may act more traditionally when they are younger
or sex-role stereotypes may have been more dominant at
Stanford three and four years ago.
i
Plans for graduate study also show some of the sex
typing. While more students plan graduate study in male

dominated than in non-male-dominated fields, in gen
eral, twice as many men as women do so. 45% of t,he
women and 86% of-the men with definite educational
i plaas, are going on in male-dominpted fields. , , \

Policy Implications ■ > < '. i i i - ! . . •< •„>
The overwhelming predominance' of men iri certain
social science and humanities fields is perpetuated as
women tend to avoid and leave these fields while thtfy
are at Stanford. These departments -*■ economics, his
tory, philosophy, political science, architecture and
urban design — should investigate this situation, looking,
in particular, at their introductory classes. The sciences,
which attract few women students, seem to be dealing
with a phenomenon inherited from the high schools. All
departments with few women majors should make an
effort to attract them. One obvious step in this direction
is to increase the number of women teaching in these
fields.
We recommend that departments with fewer than
25% women majors should experiment with ways of
attracting more women majors (such as distributing writ
ten materials through the Academic Information Center
or encouraging current women majors to discuss the
department's program with other women). These depart
ments should also determine the proportion of women
undergraduates that join and leave their undergraduate
program. Departments may wish to confer with the
Committee on the Employment and Education of
Women about methods for recruiting women, and they
should report their progress to the Committee by the
end of Spring Quarter, 1973.
IV. ACADEMIC AND OCCUPATIONAL COUNSEL
LING
The survey shows that many students find Stanford

services helpful at some point in their undergraduate
careers, but very few feel that Stanford's advisers or
counsellors have affected their occupational plans. Stu
dents were asked specifically about their contacts with
their freshman advisers, academic advisers, and career
counsellors in the placement center. Only a small pro
portion felt that these people had had any effect on
their occupational plans.

Advising and Sex-Roles
One question asked of the data was whether or not
men and womcjri were advised to chodsb fields "appro
priate to their'sex. In only one'case did this trend seem
apparept. There is some indication that the advice of
freshmen advisers reflected sex-role stereotypes. 4 of the
5 students who said they were discouraged by their
freshmen advisers were women and all of the women
were discouraged in male fields. This bias did not appear
ill responses about academic advisers and career counsel
lors. Studtnis tvere' also -asked about' the nature of the
boMattis'with their advisers which affected therin occupa
tional considerations. It is significant that one-quarter of
HHe wtlrti&n 1 whose occupational plans had b&eivaffected
■by l e!dritkets with ah advis'er or counsellor said that the
tridifttibaP hdd disdissed se* discrimination in the area
CoiTside'rihg.' Advisers are most influential as
fol£ rhollels. WhCri students were risked to "check the
statements' which; you feel accurately describe the nature
of 1 the contacts With your'freshman, adviser which affec
ted! ybur occupational consideration,"' the most fre
quently checked response was "Adviser acted as a posi
tive example of Individual in field." "Adviser acted as 1 a
negative example of individual in field" was also checked
frequently, and woijien students found advisers
equally important as role models. It is important to
note, however, that the large majority of these advisers
are men.
Suggestions for Improvements
Students were asked to respond to two open ended
questions about Stanford services: "What services that
Stanford now offers, if any, have been helpful to you in
planning your future:" and "What services which are not
now offered would you find helpful:" 60% of the 136
men answering the questionnaire and 54% of the 144
women mentioned some service at Stanford which had
been helpful to them. (These percentages refer to pro
portion of respondents. They have not been weighted to
represent the whole class.) Those services mentioned
most frequently were the Academic Information Center,
(41 times), the Career Counselling and Placement Cen
ter, (39 times), and the pre-med advising services, (18
times). 51 men and 61 women suggested improvements
in Stanford services. The most frequent target of sugges
tions were the departments, especially among women.
32 women and 15 men said that departments should be
more helpful in planning their futures. Helping students
plan their futures would be a new role for departments.
Only 11 students said their departments had actually
been helpful while they were at Stanford, and most of

the praise resulted from opportunities for practical ex
perience in their fields, not from advice or information
they had received.
Generally, students said they would have liked more
informal, personal contacts with professors, counsellors,
and people in the fields they are considering to give
them a better sense of what they wanted to do in the
future. One student suggested:

a broad, coordinated counselling service, with
competent people who can talk meaningfully
about a variety of occupations and lifestyles those
occupations shape. (Not just an engineering coun
sellor for engineering, an econ adviser for econ,
etc.)
i>i 112 c / . ' ! ; i ) I
Departments were suggested as an alternative source of
information about the employment possibilities stem
ming from a field of study.
A larger proportion of women than men students
have immediate need of career counselling and place
ment services. More of the women are planning to get a
full-time job as soon as they leave Stanford. 29% of the
women and 18% of the men said they expected to be
working full-time in the six months after graduation.
Women also seem to need more help in finding jobs. 26%
of the women who were planning to work full-time after
graduation have already looked for jobs in the area in
which they wanted to work, and only 7% had found
jobs. 18% of the men had looked for employment, and
11% had found jobs. Therefore, it is particularly im
portant for women students that occupational counsel
ling services be improved.
Policy Implications
1. The Career Planning and Placement Center should
make a special effort to help women plan their careers
and find jobs. Since a large number of women are trying
to find jobs in areas where few women have been hired
before, the Placement Center should make aggressive
efforts to place these women.
We recommend that the Career Planning and Place
ment Center report on what activities and what addi
tional staff are required in order to provide better service
to women undergraduates.
2. Women should be prepared to cope with discrimina
tion when they encounter it. We recommend that legal
and practical counselling about dealing with discrimina
tion be made available at the Placement Center.
3. Major department should be involved in occupation
counselling efforts. The experience and contacts of Stan
ford professors remain a largely untapped resource. As
some students suggested, departments should institute
programs in conjunction with the Career Planning and
Placement Center which offer an overview of the occu
pations open to men and women with training in differ
ent academic fields. Women should be well represented
in all such programs.
Wc recommend that each department provide a pro
gram of occupational counselling for its men and women
majors, either on its own or in conjunction with the
Career Planning and Placement Center.
4. Our data shows that advisers and counsellors current
ly discuss the problem of discrimination with their
women students. As several students suggested, this kind
of discussion can often be more discouraging than help
ful. Stanford advisers and counsellors need to be sensi
tive to the fine line between a fatalistic discussion of
discrimination and one that prepares women to meet the
difficulties they will encounter with determination in
stead of with surprise.
We recommend that the Dean of Students Office
develop written material and discussion sessions for ad
visers and counsellors that will orient them to the special
needs of women students.
5. Role modeling is an important function of Stanford
advisers. Yet most Stanford professors are men. There
fore. students have few opportunities to meet successful
professional women and to observe alternative ap
proaches to being a working woman or a working
mother. We recommend that the Dean of Students en
courage the participation of professional women in Uni
versity public functions and in activities at University
residences, until there are more women on the faculty.
Space paid for by News and Publications
Following are the highlights of a report on the Stan
ford woman student in 1972 as compiled by the Com
mittee on the Education and Employment of Women in
the University.
For full copies of the report, please call Nancy
Donham, ext. 4631.
THE STANFORD WOMAN IN 1972
A survey of the senior class of 1972 shows that the
Stanford undergraduate woman has changed remarkably
over the past five years.' She no longer accepts the
traditional roles which society has assigned to her as a
member of the female sex. Graduating men and women
seniors have very similar educational and occupational
aspirations. There is little difference between the propor
tions of women and men who plan to become profes
sionals: doctors, lawyers, college professors, and scien
tists. And the same proportions of men and women plan
to go on for graduate study.
Sex discrimination occurs at Stanford but its inci
dence is limited. Almost one-fourth the graduating seni
or women say they were discouraged from some goal by
sex discrimination while they were at Stanford. And
changes between major fields can to some extent be
predicted by the sex of the student and the traditional
sexual composition of the majors.
This report presents the results of a survey of Stan
ford seniors and makes recommendations on how the
University can end discrimination and provide more op
portunities for women. The first section of the report
considers the educational and occupational plans of men
and women undergraduates in 1972 and in 1965. The
second section concerns sex-role expectations and the
Stanford environment. It discusses women's experiences
of discrimination at Stanford, and the pattern of choos
ing majors which perpetuates the existence of predomi
nantly male fields. The third section discusses the effects
of academic and occupation counselling at Stanford. The
Committee's recommendations are summarized at the
end of the report.
The data presented in this report is the result of a
survey of 280 graduating seniors conducted in the Spring
of 1972. The questionnaire, "A Survey of Major and
Occupational Choice," was designed to find out what
fields Stanford undergraduates choose for their studies
and future jobs, and how the University environment
influences their choices. Recipients of the questionnaire
were randomly chosen in groups by sex and the aca
demic field in which they were interested when they
entered Stanford. Data presented here has been weighted
to be representative of the whole graduating class, unless
otherwise indicated. 136 men and 144 women respon
ded to the mailed questionnaire, giving a response rate of
79%. The questionnaire and a discussion of research
procedures are presented in the Appendix.
I. THE NEW STANFORD WOMAN
Occupational Plans of the Class of 1972
Perhaps the most significant finding of the survey of
major and occupational choice is the similarity of the
plans of men and women students. In the past it was
assumed that most Stanford men would become profes
sionals or businessmen while Stanford women would
become housewives, school teachers, and secretaries.
This stereotype used to approximate reality. It is no
longer valid.
In the Stanford class of 1972, a similar proportion of
men and women plan to enter major professions. 69% of
the men and 53% of the women who have a single
definite long-range plan say they will become doctors,
lawyers, college professors and scientists. When this is
generalized to the entire class, (including those who have
vague plans or more than one plan), 28% of senior
women and 30% of senior men are definitely planning to
enter a major profession.
The following table shows the responses of those who
said they had definite long-range occupational plans.
Data representing the plans of the whole population,
including those who are uncertain, shows a very similar
pattern.

N=6B N=B4

It is apparent that the occupational choices of Stan
ford women do not fit into sexual stereotypes. Informa
tion on all the occupations which students considered at
Stanford shows that the women respondents began with
more traditional ideas as freshmen and moved away
from traditional considerations during their time at the
University.
Women and men not only have very similar occupa
tional plans, they also seem to have the same level of
commitment to their occupations and the same expecta
tions of success. As a measure of the seriousness of
occupational intent, students were asked how they had
prepared for their planned future occupations. The same
proportion of women and men said that they had pre
pared themselves by such activities as talking to individ
uals in the occupation, acquiring needed credentials or
training, and finding employment.
Expectations of success were measured by asking
students what ideally would be their occupation or main
activity in five years and what, realistically, they thought

they would be doing. Most students said they would
probably be engaged in their ideal occupations, (71% of
the men and 58% of the women). While fewer women
than men believe they will be engaged in their ideal
occupations, no more women than men think they will
be engaged in lower status occupations. Of those who do
not believe they will be engaged in their ideal occupa
tions, 26% of the men and 28% of the women said they
would probably be engaged in an occupation that vns
lower status than their ideal occupation.
The three most frequently mentioned ideal occupa
tions were medicine, law, and college educator-scientist.

Legal professions 15 15 7 7

N=loB N=l2s

As Table 2 shows, virtually all of the men and women
that aspire to these professions expect to reach their
goals, with the single exception of women who would
like to be college professors or scientists. 12% of the
women hold this ideal but only 7% believe they can
realistically attain it. This is by far the biggest gap
between ideal and realistic assessments for any sex or
occupation. It is interesting that women students have
the least confidence about the occupation to which they
have had the most exposure at Stanford: college profes
sor.
Educational Plans of the Class of 1972
The educational plans of graduating men and women
students are also quite similar. Just as many men as
women plan to go on for further education at some
point in the future, as Table 3 shows.

TABLE 3
Male Female
7c Having definite educational plans 84.5 81.3
% Having uncertain educational plans 4.4 8.5

N=l33 N=l44

Approximately the same proportion of men and
women are also going on for graduate study in the next
six months, (54 percent of the men and 49 percent of
the women).
Doctoral and professional programs have traditionally
been filled with men, while women have tended to enter
masters programs. This trend is still apparent with this
year's Stanford graduates, but the gap is closing. 52% of
the women and 74% of the men who said they were
going on for further education are planning to get a
doctorate, or a degree in law or medicine. 41% of the
women and 23% of the men are getting Masters degrees.
The remaining students will be getting technical licenses,
professional B.A.s or certificates of some kind.
A Comparison of Senior Women in 1965 and 1972
The plans of graduating Stanford women have
changed dramatically in the past few years. Data gather
ed on the Class of 1965 by the Institute for the Study of
Human Problems shows striking differences from the
Class of 1972. In "Career and Autonomy in College
Women," Joseph Katz draws the following conclusion:
.. .even in as academically able a group of students
as the Stanford women, the orientation toward
occupational roles is a very "traditional" one, even
though, as we will later see, there is a high valua
tion of the occupational life. .. .the women are
oriented towards family and their biggest occupa
tional aspiration is elementary and secondary
school teaching.
Similar findings have been reported by many other stud
ies of the occupational plans of women students in the
1950s and the early 1960s.
The following table compares the occupational plans
of women graduating in 1965 and 1972, and shows how
much Stanford undergraduates have changed in the past
7 years. The data for the two time periods are not
completely comparable, since different research pro
cedures were used in the two studies. However, the
comparisons between men and women within each time
period are valid.
The table shows a dramatic rise in the proportion of
women interested in the professions, and a sharp de
crease in the proportion who intend to be teachers.
These changes are clear, even though the 1972 data
represents women's most pessimistic estimates of their
future occupations, i.e., their realistic assessments of
what they would be doing in five years, as opposed to
their occupational plans.

In 1965, the ratio of men to women planning to
♦enter professions was 6to 1; in 1972 the ratio is 1.6 to
1. The proportion of women planning to enter elemen
tary and secondary education has decreased from 36% to
10% and the same proportion of men and women now
plan to enter business.
Stanford women have changed their conceptions of
their marital and childbearing roles, as well as their
occupational and education plans. Katz's respondents
were acutely aware of their future roles as wives and
mothers, and most assumed that their occupational goals
would be secondary to their duties to their husbands and
children. 70% of these women said they would not work
at all when their children were under 6 years old, and
only 43% intended to work full time when their children
were over 12 years of age.
Stanford women no longer think along these lines.
The 1972 respondents were not asked directly about
their plans for marriage and childrearing, but the women
were given ample opportunity to mention the future role
of wife and mother. Few women ever mentioned the
topic.
In one series of questions, we asked women what
they were planning to do after graduation, and how long
they planned to continue in that activity. Traditional
patterns led us to expect that a significant proportion of
the women would say they planned to work either until
they had put their husbands through school, or until it
was time to raise children. Only 3% of the women
who were leaving college to work said they would stop
when their husbands had finished school, and only 7%
said they would stop to raise children. Traditional role
expectations still exist at Stanford, but they are the
exception rather than the rule.
This conclusion is also supported by their responses
about "ideal" and "real" future activities. Only 3% of
the women said that, ideally, they would be housewives
in five years and an additional .4% thought that real
istically they would be housewives at that time. In five
years, most of these women will be 26 or 27 years old,
an age at which, in the past, a majority of women
already have small children. However, only 15% of the
women said that they realistically expected childraising
and housework to be a major activity, in addition to
some kind of employment. In all, only 18.5% of the
women mentioned the role of wife and mother as part of
their main activities in the next 5 years.
In sum, the data show that Stanford women have
broken away from traditional stereotypes about "the
woman's role" in the last seven years. Women and men
now have very similar occupational and educational
plans. Women no longer seem to regard a job as "some
thing to fall back on." They take their plans seriously,
and they expect to succeed.
Policy Implications
1. It is important that all members of the Stanford
community — administrators, professors, advisers, and
counsellors — understand the new aspirations of women
undergraduates. The best cure for sex-role stereotypes is
information. For this reason, the findings of this study
should be publicized as widely as possible. We recom
mend that the Dean of Undergraduate Studies and the
Provost take steps to ensure that the findings of this
study are communicated to all professors, advisers,
counsellors and administrators, especially those who
have extensive contact with undergraduates.
2. Stanford University as an institution employing over
7,000 men and women is responsible for setting an
example by eliminating all discriminatory hiring and
promotional practices. The administration should con
tinue to give high priority to its affirmative action ef
forts, and to publicize them as widely as possible.
11. SEX ROLE EXPECTATIONS AND THE STAN
FORD ENVIRONMENT
Knowing that Stanford men and women share sub
stantially the same aspirations, it is important to ask
whether Stanford's treatment of its students is consis
tent with these aspirations. Are Stanford women dis
couraged from entering traditionally male fields and
seeking careers in predominantly male areas? Are they
encouraged to be housewives and school teachers, when
many would prefer to be doctors and professors?
By and large, the answer to these questions appears to
be no. Most women do not believe that they encounter
ed discrimination while they were at Stanford, but a
significant number of Stanford women have been in
fluenced to limit their educational and occupational
choices because of their sex. Most departments and
professors do not discriminate against women; but some
do.
Experience with Discrimination
When asked, "do you feel you have been discouraged
from any academic or occupational goals by a member
of the Stanford community because of your sex?" 29 of
the 128 women who responded said yes. This generalizes
to 23% of all Stanford women. Another 5% of the
women experienced discrimination but were not dis
couraged by it. Most of these women were discouraged
by contacts with faculty members.

discouraged by discrimination. The forms which this
discrimination takes range from explicit discouragement
from a professor to more subtle environmental cues. The
observations of some of the women respondents illus
trate this quite clearly. The following quotations drawn
from survey responses illustrate overt discouragement of
women by their advisers:
Dr. X, a pre-med adviser, had a dim view of the
possibility of women actually making it through
all the work necessary to be a doctor, and later of
her juggling work, children, etc. .. .There were 2
other girls in our advisee group. He said he didn 't
expect to see us the next year.. . .
Not only my major adviser, but several of my
professors in my department failed to offer any
encouragement or assistance and in some cases
actively discouraged me from further study in
mathematics - both when I sought advice and
approval for advanced study and when I sought
assistance and consultation in courses I was taking.
A largely negative reaction (at best, I was ignored)
from male peers in math and science classes was
also quite evident.
My history adviser specifically discouraged me
from going on to grad school. He kept suggesting
high school teaching as "more flexible for a
woman." And he did this even after I took several
courses from him in which I did very well. He even
urged me to take on the honors thesis program.
Other women described comments made by professors
during lectures as a source of discouragement:
I took a class in (chemistry) from Dr. X - a
required course for many med schools. He began
his first lecture by saying there were 2 things he
couldn 't stand — premeds and women who
thought they could be scientists. His actions were
consistent with his prejudices.
One art teacher, XX, believes that women make
better art teachers than artists - his suggestions to
this effect have been to classes as a whole, not to
me individually, but I think that his underlying
sexism affects his relationship with me although he
shows a respect for my work.
Some women found assessments of the employment
situation for women in some fields more discouraging
than helpful:
I have been told of personal experience of the bias
against women in university level teaching. I would
not seek employment as a member of an academic
community (university).
. . .advisers have given me "realistic appraisals
which were very discouraging.
Finally, some women did not describe a direct communi
cation at all, but a sense they had from what was around
them:
It's difficult to be specific - one carries with him
the prejudices; I wish now I had gone pre-med; I
would like to be a doctor but women weren't
doctors; and women didn't go on to be English
professors - I didn 7 look much beyond teaching
- and no one suggested anything else.
Though discouragement has not been overt (ex
cept in a couple of cases where people couldn't
understand why I couldn't be happy teaching in
high school) there is a lot of subtle discourage
ment. 1) The lack of female professors which
really presents a problem in terms of role identity,
2) the number of professors that give only a nega
tive account of their role (Idon't understand why
they're still in it), 3) a disbelief, from both profes
sors and students, that I can combine being a
woman with being a professor, 4) the way I see
female professors now being treated (i.e. difficulty
in obtaining tenure, refusal to see their courses as
anything but "fun" (both professors and stu
dents), insinuations about their teaching ability
and/or intelligence related to sex, etc.).
Policy Implications
Overt discouragement of women wishing to enter
"male" fields and professions should not exist at Stan
ford in 1972. To counter such sexism when it results
from ignorance, an effort should be made to increase
awareness of the fact that women are capable of doing
"male jobs" and succeeding in "male fields," and that
many women do successfully combine professional and
childrearing responsibilities. Any professor or counsellor
who continues to discourage women students because of
their sex should not be asked to advise them. We recom
mend that the Dean of Undergraduate Studies develop a
list of advisers that are particularly interested in working
with women undergraduates. Students should be in
formed that they have the option of choosing someone
from this list to replace their current adviser. In addi
tion, the Dean of Undergraduate Studies should consider
developing procedures by which students can register
complaints if they experience discrimination from their
adviser.
111. CHOICE OF MAJORS
Just as some occupations are usually seen as "men's
jobs" and others as "women's jobs," so some academic
fields are seen as primarily "male" or "female." The
traditional perceptions of appropriate fields for men and
women closely fit the actual proportions of each sex
majoring in these fields at Stanford today. The science
fields have few women, the humanities many more than
their share. Students' changes between majors were
assessed in order to find out if this distribution was due
to interests and orientations acquired before students
entered Stanford, or if the Stanford environment was in
some way encouraging sex-typed choices of major fields.
The results show that students do tend to move into
fields dominated by their own sex while they are at
Stanford. Women more than men switch out of fields
such as Political Science and into fields like English and
Music. More men than women move into fields which
already have a large number of men and out of fields
with a larger proportion s of women. While students are
breaking traditiojn in their careqr N choices, they are per
petuating the, sex-typing of majoi; fields.
. ' \ v v • \ \ \ r •. * > *
of switching between majors, fields
were categorized as cither maje-dominated or non-male
dominated. All fields having less than 25% wom'en'were
, male-dominated, rest,, non-male-dominated.
(j3)S% of, Stanford undergraduates are women.) Male
dominated fields were further divided into science and
non-science fields. Students were asked about the field
ip vyhich' they expressed'an interest time they
were accepted to Stanfo'rd, (referred to as'their
man field of interest"), their first major, and the'major
with which they graduated.
Tn Ihe male-domma'ted sbifcnce fields, Stanford stu
dents appear to bring th v eir sex role stereotypes with
them.'Many mo're freshmen men. than women are inter
ested in these fields; but there is no change towards
greater sexvtyped choice between the freshman and
senior year. "Science fields, retain and attract an equal
proportion of men and women majors.
The fields where Stanford students increasingly make
their choices in terms of sex role stereotypes are the
male dominated, nonscience fields: economics, history,
political science, philosophy, architecture and urban de
sign. Of those students who were interested in these
fields as freshmen, more men than women remained in
these fields until they graduated (60% vs. 53%). More
over, in recruiting new majors, these fields attract many
more men than women. Nonscience male-dominated
fields attract 45% of the men who come to Stanford
interested in non-male-dominated fields, and only 10%
of the women.
Students who come to Stanford without a clear field
of interest seem to be most influenced by pressures to
select a field that is "appropriate" for their sex. The
students who said they were considering both a male
dominated and a non-male-dominated field when they
were accepted to Stanford showed almost no sex-typed
switching. (3% of all freshmen men and 7% of all fresh
men women were in this category.) On the other hand,
the final majors of those who were undecided as entering
freshmen and were not interested in any particular field,
can be almost entirely predicted by sex-typing. 79% of
these men graduated in male-dominated fields, 21% in
non-male-dominated fields. 27% of the undecided
women graduated in male-dominated fields, and 70% in
non-male-dominated fields. (20% of freshmen women
and 26% of freshmen men were undecided.)
The fact that students who come to Stanford with no
idea of what they want to do show the most sex-typed
behavior would seem to indicate that the University
environment influences students to make this kind of
choice. However, when students were asked why they
made the choices they did, such pressures from the
University were not evident. Women were not advised to
shift out of male-dominated fields any more often than
they were encouraged to shift into them. They did not
respond that experienced or anticipated discrimination
was a reason for such shifts, nor did they feel less
capable of succeeding in male-dominated fields. The
reasons which women give for changing majors do not
explain the pattern of sex-typed switching.
Most of the women's sex-typed switching occurred
between the time of their acceptance to Stanford and
•the time they declared their first major (by the end of
their sophomore years). This tendency for sex-typed
major choice to be more frequent in the freshman and
sophomore years has two possible explanations. Stu
dents may act more traditionally when they are younger
or sex-role stereotypes may have been more dominant at
Stanford three and four years ago.
i
Plans for graduate study also show some of the sex
typing. While more students plan graduate study in male

dominated than in non-male-dominated fields, in gen
eral, twice as many men as women do so. 45% of t,he
women and 86% of-the men with definite educational
i plaas, are going on in male-dominpted fields. , , \

Policy Implications ■ > < '. i i i - ! . . •< •„>
The overwhelming predominance' of men iri certain
social science and humanities fields is perpetuated as
women tend to avoid and leave these fields while thtfy
are at Stanford. These departments -*■ economics, his
tory, philosophy, political science, architecture and
urban design — should investigate this situation, looking,
in particular, at their introductory classes. The sciences,
which attract few women students, seem to be dealing
with a phenomenon inherited from the high schools. All
departments with few women majors should make an
effort to attract them. One obvious step in this direction
is to increase the number of women teaching in these
fields.
We recommend that departments with fewer than
25% women majors should experiment with ways of
attracting more women majors (such as distributing writ
ten materials through the Academic Information Center
or encouraging current women majors to discuss the
department's program with other women). These depart
ments should also determine the proportion of women
undergraduates that join and leave their undergraduate
program. Departments may wish to confer with the
Committee on the Employment and Education of
Women about methods for recruiting women, and they
should report their progress to the Committee by the
end of Spring Quarter, 1973.
IV. ACADEMIC AND OCCUPATIONAL COUNSEL
LING
The survey shows that many students find Stanford

services helpful at some point in their undergraduate
careers, but very few feel that Stanford's advisers or
counsellors have affected their occupational plans. Stu
dents were asked specifically about their contacts with
their freshman advisers, academic advisers, and career
counsellors in the placement center. Only a small pro
portion felt that these people had had any effect on
their occupational plans.

Advising and Sex-Roles
One question asked of the data was whether or not
men and womcjri were advised to chodsb fields "appro
priate to their'sex. In only one'case did this trend seem
apparept. There is some indication that the advice of
freshmen advisers reflected sex-role stereotypes. 4 of the
5 students who said they were discouraged by their
freshmen advisers were women and all of the women
were discouraged in male fields. This bias did not appear
ill responses about academic advisers and career counsel
lors. Studtnis tvere' also -asked about' the nature of the
boMattis'with their advisers which affected therin occupa
tional considerations. It is significant that one-quarter of
HHe wtlrti&n 1 whose occupational plans had b&eivaffected
■by l e!dritkets with ah advis'er or counsellor said that the
tridifttibaP hdd disdissed se* discrimination in the area
CoiTside'rihg.' Advisers are most influential as
fol£ rhollels. WhCri students were risked to "check the
statements' which; you feel accurately describe the nature
of 1 the contacts With your'freshman, adviser which affec
ted! ybur occupational consideration,"' the most fre
quently checked response was "Adviser acted as a posi
tive example of Individual in field." "Adviser acted as 1 a
negative example of individual in field" was also checked
frequently, and woijien students found advisers
equally important as role models. It is important to
note, however, that the large majority of these advisers
are men.
Suggestions for Improvements
Students were asked to respond to two open ended
questions about Stanford services: "What services that
Stanford now offers, if any, have been helpful to you in
planning your future:" and "What services which are not
now offered would you find helpful:" 60% of the 136
men answering the questionnaire and 54% of the 144
women mentioned some service at Stanford which had
been helpful to them. (These percentages refer to pro
portion of respondents. They have not been weighted to
represent the whole class.) Those services mentioned
most frequently were the Academic Information Center,
(41 times), the Career Counselling and Placement Cen
ter, (39 times), and the pre-med advising services, (18
times). 51 men and 61 women suggested improvements
in Stanford services. The most frequent target of sugges
tions were the departments, especially among women.
32 women and 15 men said that departments should be
more helpful in planning their futures. Helping students
plan their futures would be a new role for departments.
Only 11 students said their departments had actually
been helpful while they were at Stanford, and most of

the praise resulted from opportunities for practical ex
perience in their fields, not from advice or information
they had received.
Generally, students said they would have liked more
informal, personal contacts with professors, counsellors,
and people in the fields they are considering to give
them a better sense of what they wanted to do in the
future. One student suggested:

a broad, coordinated counselling service, with
competent people who can talk meaningfully
about a variety of occupations and lifestyles those
occupations shape. (Not just an engineering coun
sellor for engineering, an econ adviser for econ,
etc.)
i>i 112 c / . ' ! ; i ) I
Departments were suggested as an alternative source of
information about the employment possibilities stem
ming from a field of study.
A larger proportion of women than men students
have immediate need of career counselling and place
ment services. More of the women are planning to get a
full-time job as soon as they leave Stanford. 29% of the
women and 18% of the men said they expected to be
working full-time in the six months after graduation.
Women also seem to need more help in finding jobs. 26%
of the women who were planning to work full-time after
graduation have already looked for jobs in the area in
which they wanted to work, and only 7% had found
jobs. 18% of the men had looked for employment, and
11% had found jobs. Therefore, it is particularly im
portant for women students that occupational counsel
ling services be improved.
Policy Implications
1. The Career Planning and Placement Center should
make a special effort to help women plan their careers
and find jobs. Since a large number of women are trying
to find jobs in areas where few women have been hired
before, the Placement Center should make aggressive
efforts to place these women.
We recommend that the Career Planning and Place
ment Center report on what activities and what addi
tional staff are required in order to provide better service
to women undergraduates.
2. Women should be prepared to cope with discrimina
tion when they encounter it. We recommend that legal
and practical counselling about dealing with discrimina
tion be made available at the Placement Center.
3. Major department should be involved in occupation
counselling efforts. The experience and contacts of Stan
ford professors remain a largely untapped resource. As
some students suggested, departments should institute
programs in conjunction with the Career Planning and
Placement Center which offer an overview of the occu
pations open to men and women with training in differ
ent academic fields. Women should be well represented
in all such programs.
Wc recommend that each department provide a pro
gram of occupational counselling for its men and women
majors, either on its own or in conjunction with the
Career Planning and Placement Center.
4. Our data shows that advisers and counsellors current
ly discuss the problem of discrimination with their
women students. As several students suggested, this kind
of discussion can often be more discouraging than help
ful. Stanford advisers and counsellors need to be sensi
tive to the fine line between a fatalistic discussion of
discrimination and one that prepares women to meet the
difficulties they will encounter with determination in
stead of with surprise.
We recommend that the Dean of Students Office
develop written material and discussion sessions for ad
visers and counsellors that will orient them to the special
needs of women students.
5. Role modeling is an important function of Stanford
advisers. Yet most Stanford professors are men. There
fore. students have few opportunities to meet successful
professional women and to observe alternative ap
proaches to being a working woman or a working
mother. We recommend that the Dean of Students en
courage the participation of professional women in Uni
versity public functions and in activities at University
residences, until there are more women on the faculty.
Space paid for by News and Publications
Following are the highlights of a report on the Stan
ford woman student in 1972 as compiled by the Com
mittee on the Education and Employment of Women in
the University.
For full copies of the report, please call Nancy
Donham, ext. 4631.
THE STANFORD WOMAN IN 1972
A survey of the senior class of 1972 shows that the
Stanford undergraduate woman has changed remarkably
over the past five years.' She no longer accepts the
traditional roles which society has assigned to her as a
member of the female sex. Graduating men and women
seniors have very similar educational and occupational
aspirations. There is little difference between the propor
tions of women and men who plan to become profes
sionals: doctors, lawyers, college professors, and scien
tists. And the same proportions of men and women plan
to go on for graduate study.
Sex discrimination occurs at Stanford but its inci
dence is limited. Almost one-fourth the graduating seni
or women say they were discouraged from some goal by
sex discrimination while they were at Stanford. And
changes between major fields can to some extent be
predicted by the sex of the student and the traditional
sexual composition of the majors.
This report presents the results of a survey of Stan
ford seniors and makes recommendations on how the
University can end discrimination and provide more op
portunities for women. The first section of the report
considers the educational and occupational plans of men
and women undergraduates in 1972 and in 1965. The
second section concerns sex-role expectations and the
Stanford environment. It discusses women's experiences
of discrimination at Stanford, and the pattern of choos
ing majors which perpetuates the existence of predomi
nantly male fields. The third section discusses the effects
of academic and occupation counselling at Stanford. The
Committee's recommendations are summarized at the
end of the report.
The data presented in this report is the result of a
survey of 280 graduating seniors conducted in the Spring
of 1972. The questionnaire, "A Survey of Major and
Occupational Choice," was designed to find out what
fields Stanford undergraduates choose for their studies
and future jobs, and how the University environment
influences their choices. Recipients of the questionnaire
were randomly chosen in groups by sex and the aca
demic field in which they were interested when they
entered Stanford. Data presented here has been weighted
to be representative of the whole graduating class, unless
otherwise indicated. 136 men and 144 women respon
ded to the mailed questionnaire, giving a response rate of
79%. The questionnaire and a discussion of research
procedures are presented in the Appendix.
I. THE NEW STANFORD WOMAN
Occupational Plans of the Class of 1972
Perhaps the most significant finding of the survey of
major and occupational choice is the similarity of the
plans of men and women students. In the past it was
assumed that most Stanford men would become profes
sionals or businessmen while Stanford women would
become housewives, school teachers, and secretaries.
This stereotype used to approximate reality. It is no
longer valid.
In the Stanford class of 1972, a similar proportion of
men and women plan to enter major professions. 69% of
the men and 53% of the women who have a single
definite long-range plan say they will become doctors,
lawyers, college professors and scientists. When this is
generalized to the entire class, (including those who have
vague plans or more than one plan), 28% of senior
women and 30% of senior men are definitely planning to
enter a major profession.
The following table shows the responses of those who
said they had definite long-range occupational plans.
Data representing the plans of the whole population,
including those who are uncertain, shows a very similar
pattern.

N=6B N=B4

It is apparent that the occupational choices of Stan
ford women do not fit into sexual stereotypes. Informa
tion on all the occupations which students considered at
Stanford shows that the women respondents began with
more traditional ideas as freshmen and moved away
from traditional considerations during their time at the
University.
Women and men not only have very similar occupa
tional plans, they also seem to have the same level of
commitment to their occupations and the same expecta
tions of success. As a measure of the seriousness of
occupational intent, students were asked how they had
prepared for their planned future occupations. The same
proportion of women and men said that they had pre
pared themselves by such activities as talking to individ
uals in the occupation, acquiring needed credentials or
training, and finding employment.
Expectations of success were measured by asking
students what ideally would be their occupation or main
activity in five years and what, realistically, they thought

they would be doing. Most students said they would
probably be engaged in their ideal occupations, (71% of
the men and 58% of the women). While fewer women
than men believe they will be engaged in their ideal
occupations, no more women than men think they will
be engaged in lower status occupations. Of those who do
not believe they will be engaged in their ideal occupa
tions, 26% of the men and 28% of the women said they
would probably be engaged in an occupation that vns
lower status than their ideal occupation.
The three most frequently mentioned ideal occupa
tions were medicine, law, and college educator-scientist.

Legal professions 15 15 7 7

N=loB N=l2s

As Table 2 shows, virtually all of the men and women
that aspire to these professions expect to reach their
goals, with the single exception of women who would
like to be college professors or scientists. 12% of the
women hold this ideal but only 7% believe they can
realistically attain it. This is by far the biggest gap
between ideal and realistic assessments for any sex or
occupation. It is interesting that women students have
the least confidence about the occupation to which they
have had the most exposure at Stanford: college profes
sor.
Educational Plans of the Class of 1972
The educational plans of graduating men and women
students are also quite similar. Just as many men as
women plan to go on for further education at some
point in the future, as Table 3 shows.

TABLE 3

7c Having definite educational plans 84.5 81.3
% Having uncertain educational plans 4.4 8.5

N=l33 N=l44

Approximately the same proportion of men and
women are also going on for graduate study in the next
six months, (54 percent of the men and 49 percent of
the women).
Doctoral and professional programs have traditionally
been filled with men, while women have tended to enter
masters programs. This trend is still apparent with this
year's Stanford graduates, but the gap is closing. 52% of
the women and 74% of the men who said they were
going on for further education are planning to get a
doctorate, or a degree in law or medicine. 41% of the
women and 23% of the men are getting Masters degrees.
The remaining students will be getting technical licenses,
professional B.A.s or certificates of some kind.
A Comparison of Senior Women in 1965 and 1972
The plans of graduating Stanford women have
changed dramatically in the past few years. Data gather
ed on the Class of 1965 by the Institute for the Study of
Human Problems shows striking differences from the
Class of 1972. In "Career and Autonomy in College
Women," Joseph Katz draws the following conclusion:
.. .even in as academically able a group of students
as the Stanford women, the orientation toward
occupational roles is a very "traditional" one, even
though, as we will later see, there is a high valua
tion of the occupational life. .. .the women are
oriented towards family and their biggest occupa
tional aspiration is elementary and secondary
school teaching.
Similar findings have been reported by many other stud
ies of the occupational plans of women students in the
1950s and the early 1960s.
The following table compares the occupational plans
of women graduating in 1965 and 1972, and shows how
much Stanford undergraduates have changed in the past
7 years. The data for the two time periods are not
completely comparable, since different research pro
cedures were used in the two studies. However, the
comparisons between men and women within each time
period are valid.
The table shows a dramatic rise in the proportion of
women interested in the professions, and a sharp de
crease in the proportion who intend to be teachers.
These changes are clear, even though the 1972 data
represents women's most pessimistic estimates of their
future occupations, i.e., their realistic assessments of
what they would be doing in five years, as opposed to
their occupational plans.

In 1965, the ratio of men to women planning to
♦enter professions was 6to 1; in 1972 the ratio is 1.6 to
1. The proportion of women planning to enter elemen
tary and secondary education has decreased from 36% to
10% and the same proportion of men and women now
plan to enter business.
Stanford women have changed their conceptions of
their marital and childbearing roles, as well as their
occupational and education plans. Katz's respondents
were acutely aware of their future roles as wives and
mothers, and most assumed that their occupational goals
would be secondary to their duties to their husbands and
children. 70% of these women said they would not work
at all when their children were under 6 years old, and
only 43% intended to work full time when their children
were over 12 years of age.
Stanford women no longer think along these lines.
The 1972 respondents were not asked directly about
their plans for marriage and childrearing, but the women
were given ample opportunity to mention the future role
of wife and mother. Few women ever mentioned the
topic.
In one series of questions, we asked women what
they were planning to do after graduation, and how long
they planned to continue in that activity. Traditional
patterns led us to expect that a significant proportion of
the women would say they planned to work either until
they had put their husbands through school, or until it
was time to raise children. Only 3% of the women
who were leaving college to work said they would stop
when their husbands had finished school, and only 7%
said they would stop to raise children. Traditional role
expectations still exist at Stanford, but they are the
exception rather than the rule.
This conclusion is also supported by their responses
about "ideal" and "real" future activities. Only 3% of
the women said that, ideally, they would be housewives
in five years and an additional .4% thought that real
istically they would be housewives at that time. In five
years, most of these women will be 26 or 27 years old,
an age at which, in the past, a majority of women
already have small children. However, only 15% of the
women said that they realistically expected childraising
and housework to be a major activity, in addition to
some kind of employment. In all, only 18.5% of the
women mentioned the role of wife and mother as part of
their main activities in the next 5 years.
In sum, the data show that Stanford women have
broken away from traditional stereotypes about "the
woman's role" in the last seven years. Women and men
now have very similar occupational and educational
plans. Women no longer seem to regard a job as "some
thing to fall back on." They take their plans seriously,
and they expect to succeed.
Policy Implications
1. It is important that all members of the Stanford
community — administrators, professors, advisers, and
counsellors — understand the new aspirations of women
undergraduates. The best cure for sex-role stereotypes is
information. For this reason, the findings of this study
should be publicized as widely as possible. We recom
mend that the Dean of Undergraduate Studies and the
Provost take steps to ensure that the findings of this
study are communicated to all professors, advisers,
counsellors and administrators, especially those who
have extensive contact with undergraduates.
2. Stanford University as an institution employing over
7,000 men and women is responsible for setting an
example by eliminating all discriminatory hiring and
promotional practices. The administration should con
tinue to give high priority to its affirmative action ef
forts, and to publicize them as widely as possible.
11. SEX ROLE EXPECTATIONS AND THE STAN
FORD ENVIRONMENT
Knowing that Stanford men and women share sub
stantially the same aspirations, it is important to ask
whether Stanford's treatment of its students is consis
tent with these aspirations. Are Stanford women dis
couraged from entering traditionally male fields and
seeking careers in predominantly male areas? Are they
encouraged to be housewives and school teachers, when
many would prefer to be doctors and professors?
By and large, the answer to these questions appears to
be no. Most women do not believe that they encounter
ed discrimination while they were at Stanford, but a
significant number of Stanford women have been in
fluenced to limit their educational and occupational
choices because of their sex. Most departments and
professors do not discriminate against women; but some
do.
Experience with Discrimination
When asked, "do you feel you have been discouraged
from any academic or occupational goals by a member
of the Stanford community because of your sex?" 29 of
the 128 women who responded said yes. This generalizes
to 23% of all Stanford women. Another 5% of the
women experienced discrimination but were not dis
couraged by it. Most of these women were discouraged
by contacts with faculty members.

In all, almost one-quarter of Stanford women are
discouraged by discrimination. The forms which this
discrimination takes range from explicit discouragement
from a professor to more subtle environmental cues. The
observations of some of the women respondents illus
trate this quite clearly. The following quotations drawn
from survey responses illustrate overt discouragement of
women by their advisers:
Dr. X, a pre-med adviser, had a dim view of the
possibility of women actually making it through
all the work necessary to be a doctor, and later of
her juggling work, children, etc. .. .There were 2
other girls in our advisee group. He said he didn 't
expect to see us the next year.. . .
Not only my major adviser, but several of my
professors in my department failed to offer any
encouragement or assistance and in some cases
actively discouraged me from further study in
mathematics - both when I sought advice and
approval for advanced study and when I sought
assistance and consultation in courses I was taking.
A largely negative reaction (at best, I was ignored)
from male peers in math and science classes was
also quite evident.
My history adviser specifically discouraged me
from going on to grad school. He kept suggesting
high school teaching as "more flexible for a
woman." And he did this even after I took several
courses from him in which I did very well. He even
urged me to take on the honors thesis program.
Other women described comments made by professors
during lectures as a source of discouragement:
I took a class in (chemistry) from Dr. X - a
required course for many med schools. He began
his first lecture by saying there were 2 things he
couldn 't stand — premeds and women who
thought they could be scientists. His actions were
consistent with his prejudices.
One art teacher, XX, believes that women make
better art teachers than artists - his suggestions to
this effect have been to classes as a whole, not to
me individually, but I think that his underlying
sexism affects his relationship with me although he
shows a respect for my work.
Some women found assessments of the employment
situation for women in some fields more discouraging
than helpful:
I have been told of personal experience of the bias
against women in university level teaching. I would
not seek employment as a member of an academic
community (university).
. . .advisers have given me "realistic appraisals
which were very discouraging.
Finally, some women did not describe a direct communi
cation at all, but a sense they had from what was around
them:
It's difficult to be specific - one carries with him
the prejudices; I wish now I had gone pre-med; I
would like to be a doctor but women weren't
doctors; and women didn't go on to be English
professors - I didn 7 look much beyond teaching
- and no one suggested anything else.
Though discouragement has not been overt (ex
cept in a couple of cases where people couldn't
understand why I couldn't be happy teaching in
high school) there is a lot of subtle discourage
ment. 1) The lack of female professors which
really presents a problem in terms of role identity,
2) the number of professors that give only a nega
tive account of their role (Idon't understand why
they're still in it), 3) a disbelief, from both profes
sors and students, that I can combine being a
woman with being a professor, 4) the way I see
female professors now being treated (i.e. difficulty
in obtaining tenure, refusal to see their courses as
anything but "fun" (both professors and stu
dents), insinuations about their teaching ability
and/or intelligence related to sex, etc.).
Policy Implications
Overt discouragement of women wishing to enter
"male" fields and professions should not exist at Stan
ford in 1972. To counter such sexism when it results
from ignorance, an effort should be made to increase
awareness of the fact that women are capable of doing
"male jobs" and succeeding in "male fields," and that
many women do successfully combine professional and
childrearing responsibilities. Any professor or counsellor
who continues to discourage women students because of
their sex should not be asked to advise them. We recom
mend that the Dean of Undergraduate Studies develop a
list of advisers that are particularly interested in working
with women undergraduates. Students should be in
formed that they have the option of choosing someone
from this list to replace their current adviser. In addi
tion, the Dean of Undergraduate Studies should consider
developing procedures by which students can register
complaints if they experience discrimination from their
adviser.
111. CHOICE OF MAJORS
Just as some occupations are usually seen as "men's
jobs" and others as "women's jobs," so some academic
fields are seen as primarily "male" or "female." The
traditional perceptions of appropriate fields for men and
women closely fit the actual proportions of each sex
majoring in these fields at Stanford today. The science
fields have few women, the humanities many more than
their share. Students' changes between majors were
assessed in order to find out if this distribution was due
to interests and orientations acquired before students
entered Stanford, or if the Stanford environment was in
some way encouraging sex-typed choices of major fields.
The results show that students do tend to move into
fields dominated by their own sex while they are at
Stanford. Women more than men switch out of fields
such as Political Science and into fields like English and
Music. More men than women move into fields which
already have a large number of men and out of fields
with a larger proportion s of women. While students are
breaking traditiojn in their careqr N choices, they are per
petuating the, sex-typing of majoi; fields.
. ' \ v v • \ \ \ r •. * > *
of switching between majors, fields
were categorized as cither maje-dominated or non-male
dominated. All fields having less than 25% wom'en'were
, male-dominated, rest,, non-male-dominated.
(j3)S% of, Stanford undergraduates are women.) Male
dominated fields were further divided into science and
non-science fields. Students were asked about the field
ip vyhich' they expressed'an interest time they
were accepted to Stanfo'rd, (referred to as'their
man field of interest"), their first major, and the'major
with which they graduated.
Tn Ihe male-domma'ted sbifcnce fields, Stanford stu
dents appear to bring th v eir sex role stereotypes with
them.'Many mo're freshmen men. than women are inter
ested in these fields; but there is no change towards
greater sexvtyped choice between the freshman and
senior year. "Science fields, retain and attract an equal
proportion of men and women majors.
The fields where Stanford students increasingly make
their choices in terms of sex role stereotypes are the
male dominated, nonscience fields: economics, history,
political science, philosophy, architecture and urban de
sign. Of those students who were interested in these
fields as freshmen, more men than women remained in
these fields until they graduated (60% vs. 53%). More
over, in recruiting new majors, these fields attract many
more men than women. Nonscience male-dominated
fields attract 45% of the men who come to Stanford
interested in non-male-dominated fields, and only 10%
of the women.
Students who come to Stanford without a clear field
of interest seem to be most influenced by pressures to
select a field that is "appropriate" for their sex. The
students who said they were considering both a male
dominated and a non-male-dominated field when they
were accepted to Stanford showed almost no sex-typed
switching. (3% of all freshmen men and 7% of all fresh
men women were in this category.) On the other hand,
the final majors of those who were undecided as entering
freshmen and were not interested in any particular field,
can be almost entirely predicted by sex-typing. 79% of
these men graduated in male-dominated fields, 21% in
non-male-dominated fields. 27% of the undecided
women graduated in male-dominated fields, and 70% in
non-male-dominated fields. (20% of freshmen women
and 26% of freshmen men were undecided.)
The fact that students who come to Stanford with no
idea of what they want to do show the most sex-typed
behavior would seem to indicate that the University
environment influences students to make this kind of
choice. However, when students were asked why they
made the choices they did, such pressures from the
University were not evident. Women were not advised to
shift out of male-dominated fields any more often than
they were encouraged to shift into them. They did not
respond that experienced or anticipated discrimination
was a reason for such shifts, nor did they feel less
capable of succeeding in male-dominated fields. The
reasons which women give for changing majors do not
explain the pattern of sex-typed switching.
Most of the women's sex-typed switching occurred
between the time of their acceptance to Stanford and
•the time they declared their first major (by the end of
their sophomore years). This tendency for sex-typed
major choice to be more frequent in the freshman and
sophomore years has two possible explanations. Stu
dents may act more traditionally when they are younger
or sex-role stereotypes may have been more dominant at
Stanford three and four years ago.
i
Plans for graduate study also show some of the sex
typing. While more students plan graduate study in male

dominated than in non-male-dominated fields, in gen
eral, twice as many men as women do so. 45% of t,he
women and 86% of-the men with definite educational
i plaas, are going on in male-dominpted fields. , , \

Policy Implications ■ > < '. i i i - ! . . •< •„>
The overwhelming predominance' of men iri certain
social science and humanities fields is perpetuated as
women tend to avoid and leave these fields while thtfy
are at Stanford. These departments -*■ economics, his
tory, philosophy, political science, architecture and
urban design — should investigate this situation, looking,
in particular, at their introductory classes. The sciences,
which attract few women students, seem to be dealing
with a phenomenon inherited from the high schools. All
departments with few women majors should make an
effort to attract them. One obvious step in this direction
is to increase the number of women teaching in these
fields.
We recommend that departments with fewer than
25% women majors should experiment with ways of
attracting more women majors (such as distributing writ
ten materials through the Academic Information Center
or encouraging current women majors to discuss the
department's program with other women). These depart
ments should also determine the proportion of women
undergraduates that join and leave their undergraduate
program. Departments may wish to confer with the
Committee on the Employment and Education of
Women about methods for recruiting women, and they
should report their progress to the Committee by the
end of Spring Quarter, 1973.
IV. ACADEMIC AND OCCUPATIONAL COUNSEL
LING
The survey shows that many students find Stanford

services helpful at some point in their undergraduate
careers, but very few feel that Stanford's advisers or
counsellors have affected their occupational plans. Stu
dents were asked specifically about their contacts with
their freshman advisers, academic advisers, and career
counsellors in the placement center. Only a small pro
portion felt that these people had had any effect on
their occupational plans.

Advising and Sex-Roles
One question asked of the data was whether or not
men and womcjri were advised to chodsb fields "appro
priate to their'sex. In only one'case did this trend seem
apparept. There is some indication that the advice of
freshmen advisers reflected sex-role stereotypes. 4 of the
5 students who said they were discouraged by their
freshmen advisers were women and all of the women
were discouraged in male fields. This bias did not appear
ill responses about academic advisers and career counsel
lors. Studtnis tvere' also -asked about' the nature of the
boMattis'with their advisers which affected therin occupa
tional considerations. It is significant that one-quarter of
HHe wtlrti&n 1 whose occupational plans had b&eivaffected
■by l e!dritkets with ah advis'er or counsellor said that the
tridifttibaP hdd disdissed se* discrimination in the area
CoiTside'rihg.' Advisers are most influential as
fol£ rhollels. WhCri students were risked to "check the
statements' which; you feel accurately describe the nature
of 1 the contacts With your'freshman, adviser which affec
ted! ybur occupational consideration,"' the most fre
quently checked response was "Adviser acted as a posi
tive example of Individual in field." "Adviser acted as 1 a
negative example of individual in field" was also checked
frequently, and woijien students found advisers
equally important as role models. It is important to
note, however, that the large majority of these advisers
are men.
Suggestions for Improvements
Students were asked to respond to two open ended
questions about Stanford services: "What services that
Stanford now offers, if any, have been helpful to you in
planning your future:" and "What services which are not
now offered would you find helpful:" 60% of the 136
men answering the questionnaire and 54% of the 144
women mentioned some service at Stanford which had
been helpful to them. (These percentages refer to pro
portion of respondents. They have not been weighted to
represent the whole class.) Those services mentioned
most frequently were the Academic Information Center,
(41 times), the Career Counselling and Placement Cen
ter, (39 times), and the pre-med advising services, (18
times). 51 men and 61 women suggested improvements
in Stanford services. The most frequent target of sugges
tions were the departments, especially among women.
32 women and 15 men said that departments should be
more helpful in planning their futures. Helping students
plan their futures would be a new role for departments.
Only 11 students said their departments had actually
been helpful while they were at Stanford, and most of

the praise resulted from opportunities for practical ex
perience in their fields, not from advice or information
they had received.
Generally, students said they would have liked more
informal, personal contacts with professors, counsellors,
and people in the fields they are considering to give
them a better sense of what they wanted to do in the
future. One student suggested:

a broad, coordinated counselling service, with
competent people who can talk meaningfully
about a variety of occupations and lifestyles those
occupations shape. (Not just an engineering coun
sellor for engineering, an econ adviser for econ,
etc.)
i>i 112 c / . ' ! ; i ) I
Departments were suggested as an alternative source of
information about the employment possibilities stem
ming from a field of study.
A larger proportion of women than men students
have immediate need of career counselling and place
ment services. More of the women are planning to get a
full-time job as soon as they leave Stanford. 29% of the
women and 18% of the men said they expected to be
working full-time in the six months after graduation.
Women also seem to need more help in finding jobs. 26%
of the women who were planning to work full-time after
graduation have already looked for jobs in the area in
which they wanted to work, and only 7% had found
jobs. 18% of the men had looked for employment, and
11% had found jobs. Therefore, it is particularly im
portant for women students that occupational counsel
ling services be improved.
Policy Implications
1. The Career Planning and Placement Center should
make a special effort to help women plan their careers
and find jobs. Since a large number of women are trying
to find jobs in areas where few women have been hired
before, the Placement Center should make aggressive
efforts to place these women.
We recommend that the Career Planning and Place
ment Center report on what activities and what addi
tional staff are required in order to provide better service
to women undergraduates.
2. Women should be prepared to cope with discrimina
tion when they encounter it. We recommend that legal
and practical counselling about dealing with discrimina
tion be made available at the Placement Center.
3. Major department should be involved in occupation
counselling efforts. The experience and contacts of Stan
ford professors remain a largely untapped resource. As
some students suggested, departments should institute
programs in conjunction with the Career Planning and
Placement Center which offer an overview of the occu
pations open to men and women with training in differ
ent academic fields. Women should be well represented
in all such programs.
Wc recommend that each department provide a pro
gram of occupational counselling for its men and women
majors, either on its own or in conjunction with the
Career Planning and Placement Center.
4. Our data shows that advisers and counsellors current
ly discuss the problem of discrimination with their
women students. As several students suggested, this kind
of discussion can often be more discouraging than help
ful. Stanford advisers and counsellors need to be sensi
tive to the fine line between a fatalistic discussion of
discrimination and one that prepares women to meet the
difficulties they will encounter with determination in
stead of with surprise.
We recommend that the Dean of Students Office
develop written material and discussion sessions for ad
visers and counsellors that will orient them to the special
needs of women students.
5. Role modeling is an important function of Stanford
advisers. Yet most Stanford professors are men. There
fore. students have few opportunities to meet successful
professional women and to observe alternative ap
proaches to being a working woman or a working
mother. We recommend that the Dean of Students en
courage the participation of professional women in Uni
versity public functions and in activities at University
residences, until there are more women on the faculty.
Space paid for by News and Publications
Following are the highlights of a report on the Stan
ford woman student in 1972 as compiled by the Com
mittee on the Education and Employment of Women in
the University.
For full copies of the report, please call Nancy
Donham, ext. 4631.
THE STANFORD WOMAN IN 1972
A survey of the senior class of 1972 shows that the
Stanford undergraduate woman has changed remarkably
over the past five years.' She no longer accepts the
traditional roles which society has assigned to her as a
member of the female sex. Graduating men and women
seniors have very similar educational and occupational
aspirations. There is little difference between the propor
tions of women and men who plan to become profes
sionals: doctors, lawyers, college professors, and scien
tists. And the same proportions of men and women plan
to go on for graduate study.
Sex discrimination occurs at Stanford but its inci
dence is limited. Almost one-fourth the graduating seni
or women say they were discouraged from some goal by
sex discrimination while they were at Stanford. And
changes between major fields can to some extent be
predicted by the sex of the student and the traditional
sexual composition of the majors.
This report presents the results of a survey of Stan
ford seniors and makes recommendations on how the
University can end discrimination and provide more op
portunities for women. The first section of the report
considers the educational and occupational plans of men
and women undergraduates in 1972 and in 1965. The
second section concerns sex-role expectations and the
Stanford environment. It discusses women's experiences
of discrimination at Stanford, and the pattern of choos
ing majors which perpetuates the existence of predomi
nantly male fields. The third section discusses the effects
of academic and occupation counselling at Stanford. The
Committee's recommendations are summarized at the
end of the report.
The data presented in this report is the result of a
survey of 280 graduating seniors conducted in the Spring
of 1972. The questionnaire, "A Survey of Major and
Occupational Choice," was designed to find out what
fields Stanford undergraduates choose for their studies
and future jobs, and how the University environment
influences their choices. Recipients of the questionnaire
were randomly chosen in groups by sex and the aca
demic field in which they were interested when they
entered Stanford. Data presented here has been weighted
to be representative of the whole graduating class, unless
otherwise indicated. 136 men and 144 women respon
ded to the mailed questionnaire, giving a response rate of
79%. The questionnaire and a discussion of research
procedures are presented in the Appendix.
I. THE NEW STANFORD WOMAN
Occupational Plans of the Class of 1972
Perhaps the most significant finding of the survey of
major and occupational choice is the similarity of the
plans of men and women students. In the past it was
assumed that most Stanford men would become profes
sionals or businessmen while Stanford women would
become housewives, school teachers, and secretaries.
This stereotype used to approximate reality. It is no
longer valid.
In the Stanford class of 1972, a similar proportion of
men and women plan to enter major professions. 69% of
the men and 53% of the women who have a single
definite long-range plan say they will become doctors,
lawyers, college professors and scientists. When this is
generalized to the entire class, (including those who have
vague plans or more than one plan), 28% of senior
women and 30% of senior men are definitely planning to
enter a major profession.
The following table shows the responses of those who
said they had definite long-range occupational plans.
Data representing the plans of the whole population,
including those who are uncertain, shows a very similar
pattern.

N=6B N=B4

It is apparent that the occupational choices of Stan
ford women do not fit into sexual stereotypes. Informa
tion on all the occupations which students considered at
Stanford shows that the women respondents began with
more traditional ideas as freshmen and moved away
from traditional considerations during their time at the
University.
Women and men not only have very similar occupa
tional plans, they also seem to have the same level of
commitment to their occupations and the same expecta
tions of success. As a measure of the seriousness of
occupational intent, students were asked how they had
prepared for their planned future occupations. The same
proportion of women and men said that they had pre
pared themselves by such activities as talking to individ
uals in the occupation, acquiring needed credentials or
training, and finding employment.
Expectations of success were measured by asking
students what ideally would be their occupation or main
activity in five years and what, realistically, they thought

they would be doing. Most students said they would
probably be engaged in their ideal occupations, (71% of
the men and 58% of the women). While fewer women
than men believe they will be engaged in their ideal
occupations, no more women than men think they will
be engaged in lower status occupations. Of those who do
not believe they will be engaged in their ideal occupa
tions, 26% of the men and 28% of the women said they
would probably be engaged in an occupation that vns
lower status than their ideal occupation.
The three most frequently mentioned ideal occupa
tions were medicine, law, and college educator-scientist.

Legal professions 15 15 7 7

N=loB N=l2s

As Table 2 shows, virtually all of the men and women
that aspire to these professions expect to reach their
goals, with the single exception of women who would
like to be college professors or scientists. 12% of the
women hold this ideal but only 7% believe they can
realistically attain it. This is by far the biggest gap
between ideal and realistic assessments for any sex or
occupation. It is interesting that women students have
the least confidence about the occupation to which they
have had the most exposure at Stanford: college profes
sor.
Educational Plans of the Class of 1972
The educational plans of graduating men and women
students are also quite similar. Just as many men as
women plan to go on for further education at some
point in the future, as Table 3 shows.

TABLE 3

7c Having definite educational plans 84.5 81.3
% Having uncertain educational plans 4.4 8.5

N=l33 N=l44

Approximately the same proportion of men and
women are also going on for graduate study in the next
six months, (54 percent of the men and 49 percent of
the women).
Doctoral and professional programs have traditionally
been filled with men, while women have tended to enter
masters programs. This trend is still apparent with this
year's Stanford graduates, but the gap is closing. 52% of
the women and 74% of the men who said they were
going on for further education are planning to get a
doctorate, or a degree in law or medicine. 41% of the
women and 23% of the men are getting Masters degrees.
The remaining students will be getting technical licenses,
professional B.A.s or certificates of some kind.
A Comparison of Senior Women in 1965 and 1972
The plans of graduating Stanford women have
changed dramatically in the past few years. Data gather
ed on the Class of 1965 by the Institute for the Study of
Human Problems shows striking differences from the
Class of 1972. In "Career and Autonomy in College
Women," Joseph Katz draws the following conclusion:
.. .even in as academically able a group of students
as the Stanford women, the orientation toward
occupational roles is a very "traditional" one, even
though, as we will later see, there is a high valua
tion of the occupational life. .. .the women are
oriented towards family and their biggest occupa
tional aspiration is elementary and secondary
school teaching.
Similar findings have been reported by many other stud
ies of the occupational plans of women students in the
1950s and the early 1960s.
The following table compares the occupational plans
of women graduating in 1965 and 1972, and shows how
much Stanford undergraduates have changed in the past
7 years. The data for the two time periods are not
completely comparable, since different research pro
cedures were used in the two studies. However, the
comparisons between men and women within each time
period are valid.
The table shows a dramatic rise in the proportion of
women interested in the professions, and a sharp de
crease in the proportion who intend to be teachers.
These changes are clear, even though the 1972 data
represents women's most pessimistic estimates of their
future occupations, i.e., their realistic assessments of
what they would be doing in five years, as opposed to
their occupational plans.

In 1965, the ratio of men to women planning to
♦enter professions was 6to 1; in 1972 the ratio is 1.6 to
1. The proportion of women planning to enter elemen
tary and secondary education has decreased from 36% to
10% and the same proportion of men and women now
plan to enter business.
Stanford women have changed their conceptions of
their marital and childbearing roles, as well as their
occupational and education plans. Katz's respondents
were acutely aware of their future roles as wives and
mothers, and most assumed that their occupational goals
would be secondary to their duties to their husbands and
children. 70% of these women said they would not work
at all when their children were under 6 years old, and
only 43% intended to work full time when their children
were over 12 years of age.
Stanford women no longer think along these lines.
The 1972 respondents were not asked directly about
their plans for marriage and childrearing, but the women
were given ample opportunity to mention the future role
of wife and mother. Few women ever mentioned the
topic.
In one series of questions, we asked women what
they were planning to do after graduation, and how long
they planned to continue in that activity. Traditional
patterns led us to expect that a significant proportion of
the women would say they planned to work either until
they had put their husbands through school, or until it
was time to raise children. Only 3% of the women
who were leaving college to work said they would stop
when their husbands had finished school, and only 7%
said they would stop to raise children. Traditional role
expectations still exist at Stanford, but they are the
exception rather than the rule.
This conclusion is also supported by their responses
about "ideal" and "real" future activities. Only 3% of
the women said that, ideally, they would be housewives
in five years and an additional .4% thought that real
istically they would be housewives at that time. In five
years, most of these women will be 26 or 27 years old,
an age at which, in the past, a majority of women
already have small children. However, only 15% of the
women said that they realistically expected childraising
and housework to be a major activity, in addition to
some kind of employment. In all, only 18.5% of the
women mentioned the role of wife and mother as part of
their main activities in the next 5 years.
In sum, the data show that Stanford women have
broken away from traditional stereotypes about "the
woman's role" in the last seven years. Women and men
now have very similar occupational and educational
plans. Women no longer seem to regard a job as "some
thing to fall back on." They take their plans seriously,
and they expect to succeed.
Policy Implications
1. It is important that all members of the Stanford
community — administrators, professors, advisers, and
counsellors — understand the new aspirations of women
undergraduates. The best cure for sex-role stereotypes is
information. For this reason, the findings of this study
should be publicized as widely as possible. We recom
mend that the Dean of Undergraduate Studies and the
Provost take steps to ensure that the findings of this
study are communicated to all professors, advisers,
counsellors and administrators, especially those who
have extensive contact with undergraduates.
2. Stanford University as an institution employing over
7,000 men and women is responsible for setting an
example by eliminating all discriminatory hiring and
promotional practices. The administration should con
tinue to give high priority to its affirmative action ef
forts, and to publicize them as widely as possible.
11. SEX ROLE EXPECTATIONS AND THE STAN
FORD ENVIRONMENT
Knowing that Stanford men and women share sub
stantially the same aspirations, it is important to ask
whether Stanford's treatment of its students is consis
tent with these aspirations. Are Stanford women dis
couraged from entering traditionally male fields and
seeking careers in predominantly male areas? Are they
encouraged to be housewives and school teachers, when
many would prefer to be doctors and professors?
By and large, the answer to these questions appears to
be no. Most women do not believe that they encounter
ed discrimination while they were at Stanford, but a
significant number of Stanford women have been in
fluenced to limit their educational and occupational
choices because of their sex. Most departments and
professors do not discriminate against women; but some
do.
Experience with Discrimination
When asked, "do you feel you have been discouraged
from any academic or occupational goals by a member
of the Stanford community because of your sex?" 29 of
the 128 women who responded said yes. This generalizes
to 23% of all Stanford women. Another 5% of the
women experienced discrimination but were not dis
couraged by it. Most of these women were discouraged
by contacts with faculty members.

In all, almost one-quarter of Stanford women are
discouraged by discrimination. The forms which this
discrimination takes range from explicit discouragement
from a professor to more subtle environmental cues. The
observations of some of the women respondents illus
trate this quite clearly. The following quotations drawn
from survey responses illustrate overt discouragement of
women by their advisers:
Dr. X, a pre-med adviser, had a dim view of the
possibility of women actually making it through
all the work necessary to be a doctor, and later of
her juggling work, children, etc. .. .There were 2
other girls in our advisee group. He said he didn 't
expect to see us the next year.. . .
Not only my major adviser, but several of my
professors in my department failed to offer any
encouragement or assistance and in some cases
actively discouraged me from further study in
mathematics - both when I sought advice and
approval for advanced study and when I sought
assistance and consultation in courses I was taking.
A largely negative reaction (at best, I was ignored)
from male peers in math and science classes was
also quite evident.
My history adviser specifically discouraged me
from going on to grad school. He kept suggesting
high school teaching as "more flexible for a
woman." And he did this even after I took several
courses from him in which I did very well. He even
urged me to take on the honors thesis program.
Other women described comments made by professors
during lectures as a source of discouragement:
I took a class in (chemistry) from Dr. X - a
required course for many med schools. He began
his first lecture by saying there were 2 things he
couldn 't stand — premeds and women who
thought they could be scientists. His actions were
consistent with his prejudices.
One art teacher, XX, believes that women make
better art teachers than artists - his suggestions to
this effect have been to classes as a whole, not to
me individually, but I think that his underlying
sexism affects his relationship with me although he
shows a respect for my work.
Some women found assessments of the employment
situation for women in some fields more discouraging
than helpful:
I have been told of personal experience of the bias
against women in university level teaching. I would
not seek employment as a member of an academic
community (university).
. . .advisers have given me "realistic appraisals
which were very discouraging.
Finally, some women did not describe a direct communi
cation at all, but a sense they had from what was around
them:
It's difficult to be specific - one carries with him
the prejudices; I wish now I had gone pre-med; I
would like to be a doctor but women weren't
doctors; and women didn't go on to be English
professors - I didn 7 look much beyond teaching
- and no one suggested anything else.
Though discouragement has not been overt (ex
cept in a couple of cases where people couldn't
understand why I couldn't be happy teaching in
high school) there is a lot of subtle discourage
ment. 1) The lack of female professors which
really presents a problem in terms of role identity,
2) the number of professors that give only a nega
tive account of their role (Idon't understand why
they're still in it), 3) a disbelief, from both profes
sors and students, that I can combine being a
woman with being a professor, 4) the way I see
female professors now being treated (i.e. difficulty
in obtaining tenure, refusal to see their courses as
anything but "fun" (both professors and stu
dents), insinuations about their teaching ability
and/or intelligence related to sex, etc.).
Policy Implications
Overt discouragement of women wishing to enter
"male" fields and professions should not exist at Stan
ford in 1972. To counter such sexism when it results
from ignorance, an effort should be made to increase
awareness of the fact that women are capable of doing
"male jobs" and succeeding in "male fields," and that
many women do successfully combine professional and
childrearing responsibilities. Any professor or counsellor
who continues to discourage women students because of
their sex should not be asked to advise them. We recom
mend that the Dean of Undergraduate Studies develop a
list of advisers that are particularly interested in working
with women undergraduates. Students should be in
formed that they have the option of choosing someone
from this list to replace their current adviser. In addi
tion, the Dean of Undergraduate Studies should consider
developing procedures by which students can register
complaints if they experience discrimination from their
adviser.
111. CHOICE OF MAJORS
Just as some occupations are usually seen as "men's
jobs" and others as "women's jobs," so some academic
fields are seen as primarily "male" or "female." The
traditional perceptions of appropriate fields for men and
women closely fit the actual proportions of each sex
majoring in these fields at Stanford today. The science
fields have few women, the humanities many more than
their share. Students' changes between majors were
assessed in order to find out if this distribution was due
to interests and orientations acquired before students
entered Stanford, or if the Stanford environment was in
some way encouraging sex-typed choices of major fields.
The results show that students do tend to move into
fields dominated by their own sex while they are at
Stanford. Women more than men switch out of fields
such as Political Science and into fields like English and
Music. More men than women move into fields which
already have a large number of men and out of fields
with a larger proportion s of women. While students are
breaking traditiojn in their careqr N choices, they are per
petuating the, sex-typing of majoi; fields.
. ' \ v v • \ \ \ r •. * > *
of switching between majors, fields
were categorized as cither maje-dominated or non-male
dominated. All fields having less than 25% wom'en'were
, male-dominated, rest,, non-male-dominated.
(j3)S% of, Stanford undergraduates are women.) Male
dominated fields were further divided into science and
non-science fields. Students were asked about the field
ip vyhich' they expressed'an interest time they
were accepted to Stanfo'rd, (referred to as'their
man field of interest"), their first major, and the'major
with which they graduated.
Tn Ihe male-domma'ted sbifcnce fields, Stanford stu
dents appear to bring th v eir sex role stereotypes with
them.'Many mo're freshmen men. than women are inter
ested in these fields; but there is no change towards
greater sexvtyped choice between the freshman and
senior year. "Science fields, retain and attract an equal
proportion of men and women majors.
The fields where Stanford students increasingly make
their choices in terms of sex role stereotypes are the
male dominated, nonscience fields: economics, history,
political science, philosophy, architecture and urban de
sign. Of those students who were interested in these
fields as freshmen, more men than women remained in
these fields until they graduated (60% vs. 53%). More
over, in recruiting new majors, these fields attract many
more men than women. Nonscience male-dominated
fields attract 45% of the men who come to Stanford
interested in non-male-dominated fields, and only 10%
of the women.
Students who come to Stanford without a clear field
of interest seem to be most influenced by pressures to
select a field that is "appropriate" for their sex. The
students who said they were considering both a male
dominated and a non-male-dominated field when they
were accepted to Stanford showed almost no sex-typed
switching. (3% of all freshmen men and 7% of all fresh
men women were in this category.) On the other hand,
the final majors of those who were undecided as entering
freshmen and were not interested in any particular field,
can be almost entirely predicted by sex-typing. 79% of
these men graduated in male-dominated fields, 21% in
non-male-dominated fields. 27% of the undecided
women graduated in male-dominated fields, and 70% in
non-male-dominated fields. (20% of freshmen women
and 26% of freshmen men were undecided.)
The fact that students who come to Stanford with no
idea of what they want to do show the most sex-typed
behavior would seem to indicate that the University
environment influences students to make this kind of
choice. However, when students were asked why they
made the choices they did, such pressures from the
University were not evident. Women were not advised to
shift out of male-dominated fields any more often than
they were encouraged to shift into them. They did not
respond that experienced or anticipated discrimination
was a reason for such shifts, nor did they feel less
capable of succeeding in male-dominated fields. The
reasons which women give for changing majors do not
explain the pattern of sex-typed switching.
Most of the women's sex-typed switching occurred
between the time of their acceptance to Stanford and
•the time they declared their first major (by the end of
their sophomore years). This tendency for sex-typed
major choice to be more frequent in the freshman and
sophomore years has two possible explanations. Stu
dents may act more traditionally when they are younger
or sex-role stereotypes may have been more dominant at
Stanford three and four years ago.
i
Plans for graduate study also show some of the sex
typing. While more students plan graduate study in male

dominated than in non-male-dominated fields, in gen
eral, twice as many men as women do so. 45% of t,he
women and 86% of-the men with definite educational
i plaas, are going on in male-dominpted fields. , , \

Policy Implications ■ > < '. i i i - ! . . •< •„>
The overwhelming predominance' of men iri certain
social science and humanities fields is perpetuated as
women tend to avoid and leave these fields while thtfy
are at Stanford. These departments -*■ economics, his
tory, philosophy, political science, architecture and
urban design — should investigate this situation, looking,
in particular, at their introductory classes. The sciences,
which attract few women students, seem to be dealing
with a phenomenon inherited from the high schools. All
departments with few women majors should make an
effort to attract them. One obvious step in this direction
is to increase the number of women teaching in these
fields.
We recommend that departments with fewer than
25% women majors should experiment with ways of
attracting more women majors (such as distributing writ
ten materials through the Academic Information Center
or encouraging current women majors to discuss the
department's program with other women). These depart
ments should also determine the proportion of women
undergraduates that join and leave their undergraduate
program. Departments may wish to confer with the
Committee on the Employment and Education of
Women about methods for recruiting women, and they
should report their progress to the Committee by the
end of Spring Quarter, 1973.
IV. ACADEMIC AND OCCUPATIONAL COUNSEL
LING
The survey shows that many students find Stanford

services helpful at some point in their undergraduate
careers, but very few feel that Stanford's advisers or
counsellors have affected their occupational plans. Stu
dents were asked specifically about their contacts with
their freshman advisers, academic advisers, and career
counsellors in the placement center. Only a small pro
portion felt that these people had had any effect on
their occupational plans.

Advising and Sex-Roles
One question asked of the data was whether or not
men and womcjri were advised to chodsb fields "appro
priate to their'sex. In only one'case did this trend seem
apparept. There is some indication that the advice of
freshmen advisers reflected sex-role stereotypes. 4 of the
5 students who said they were discouraged by their
freshmen advisers were women and all of the women
were discouraged in male fields. This bias did not appear
ill responses about academic advisers and career counsel
lors. Studtnis tvere' also -asked about' the nature of the
boMattis'with their advisers which affected therin occupa
tional considerations. It is significant that one-quarter of
HHe wtlrti&n 1 whose occupational plans had b&eivaffected
■by l e!dritkets with ah advis'er or counsellor said that the
tridifttibaP hdd disdissed se* discrimination in the area
CoiTside'rihg.' Advisers are most influential as
fol£ rhollels. WhCri students were risked to "check the
statements' which; you feel accurately describe the nature
of 1 the contacts With your'freshman, adviser which affec
ted! ybur occupational consideration,"' the most fre
quently checked response was "Adviser acted as a posi
tive example of Individual in field." "Adviser acted as 1 a
negative example of individual in field" was also checked
frequently, and woijien students found advisers
equally important as role models. It is important to
note, however, that the large majority of these advisers
are men.
Suggestions for Improvements
Students were asked to respond to two open ended
questions about Stanford services: "What services that
Stanford now offers, if any, have been helpful to you in
planning your future:" and "What services which are not
now offered would you find helpful:" 60% of the 136
men answering the questionnaire and 54% of the 144
women mentioned some service at Stanford which had
been helpful to them. (These percentages refer to pro
portion of respondents. They have not been weighted to
represent the whole class.) Those services mentioned
most frequently were the Academic Information Center,
(41 times), the Career Counselling and Placement Cen
ter, (39 times), and the pre-med advising services, (18
times). 51 men and 61 women suggested improvements
in Stanford services. The most frequent target of sugges
tions were the departments, especially among women.
32 women and 15 men said that departments should be
more helpful in planning their futures. Helping students
plan their futures would be a new role for departments.
Only 11 students said their departments had actually
been helpful while they were at Stanford, and most of

the praise resulted from opportunities for practical ex
perience in their fields, not from advice or information
they had received.
Generally, students said they would have liked more
informal, personal contacts with professors, counsellors,
and people in the fields they are considering to give
them a better sense of what they wanted to do in the
future. One student suggested:

a broad, coordinated counselling service, with
competent people who can talk meaningfully
about a variety of occupations and lifestyles those
occupations shape. (Not just an engineering coun
sellor for engineering, an econ adviser for econ,
etc.)
i>i 112 c / . ' ! ; i ) I
Departments were suggested as an alternative source of
information about the employment possibilities stem
ming from a field of study.
A larger proportion of women than men students
have immediate need of career counselling and place
ment services. More of the women are planning to get a
full-time job as soon as they leave Stanford. 29% of the
women and 18% of the men said they expected to be
working full-time in the six months after graduation.
Women also seem to need more help in finding jobs. 26%
of the women who were planning to work full-time after
graduation have already looked for jobs in the area in
which they wanted to work, and only 7% had found
jobs. 18% of the men had looked for employment, and
11% had found jobs. Therefore, it is particularly im
portant for women students that occupational counsel
ling services be improved.
Policy Implications
1. The Career Planning and Placement Center should
make a special effort to help women plan their careers
and find jobs. Since a large number of women are trying
to find jobs in areas where few women have been hired
before, the Placement Center should make aggressive
efforts to place these women.
We recommend that the Career Planning and Place
ment Center report on what activities and what addi
tional staff are required in order to provide better service
to women undergraduates.
2. Women should be prepared to cope with discrimina
tion when they encounter it. We recommend that legal
and practical counselling about dealing with discrimina
tion be made available at the Placement Center.
3. Major department should be involved in occupation
counselling efforts. The experience and contacts of Stan
ford professors remain a largely untapped resource. As
some students suggested, departments should institute
programs in conjunction with the Career Planning and
Placement Center which offer an overview of the occu
pations open to men and women with training in differ
ent academic fields. Women should be well represented
in all such programs.
Wc recommend that each department provide a pro
gram of occupational counselling for its men and women
majors, either on its own or in conjunction with the
Career Planning and Placement Center.
4. Our data shows that advisers and counsellors current
ly discuss the problem of discrimination with their
women students. As several students suggested, this kind
of discussion can often be more discouraging than help
ful. Stanford advisers and counsellors need to be sensi
tive to the fine line between a fatalistic discussion of
discrimination and one that prepares women to meet the
difficulties they will encounter with determination in
stead of with surprise.
We recommend that the Dean of Students Office
develop written material and discussion sessions for ad
visers and counsellors that will orient them to the special
needs of women students.
5. Role modeling is an important function of Stanford
advisers. Yet most Stanford professors are men. There
fore. students have few opportunities to meet successful
professional women and to observe alternative ap
proaches to being a working woman or a working
mother. We recommend that the Dean of Students en
courage the participation of professional women in Uni
versity public functions and in activities at University
residences, until there are more women on the faculty.
Space paid for by News and Publications
Following are the highlights of a report on the Stan
ford woman student in 1972 as compiled by the Com
mittee on the Education and Employment of Women in
the University.
For full copies of the report, please call Nancy
Donham, ext. 4631.
THE STANFORD WOMAN IN 1972
A survey of the senior class of 1972 shows that the
Stanford undergraduate woman has changed remarkably
over the past five years.' She no longer accepts the
traditional roles which society has assigned to her as a
member of the female sex. Graduating men and women
seniors have very similar educational and occupational
aspirations. There is little difference between the propor
tions of women and men who plan to become profes
sionals: doctors, lawyers, college professors, and scien
tists. And the same proportions of men and women plan
to go on for graduate study.
Sex discrimination occurs at Stanford but its inci
dence is limited. Almost one-fourth the graduating seni
or women say they were discouraged from some goal by
sex discrimination while they were at Stanford. And
changes between major fields can to some extent be
predicted by the sex of the student and the traditional
sexual composition of the majors.
This report presents the results of a survey of Stan
ford seniors and makes recommendations on how the
University can end discrimination and provide more op
portunities for women. The first section of the report
considers the educational and occupational plans of men
and women undergraduates in 1972 and in 1965. The
second section concerns sex-role expectations and the
Stanford environment. It discusses women's experiences
of discrimination at Stanford, and the pattern of choos
ing majors which perpetuates the existence of predomi
nantly male fields. The third section discusses the effects
of academic and occupation counselling at Stanford. The
Committee's recommendations are summarized at the
end of the report.
The data presented in this report is the result of a
survey of 280 graduating seniors conducted in the Spring
of 1972. The questionnaire, "A Survey of Major and
Occupational Choice," was designed to find out what
fields Stanford undergraduates choose for their studies
and future jobs, and how the University environment
influences their choices. Recipients of the questionnaire
were randomly chosen in groups by sex and the aca
demic field in which they were interested when they
entered Stanford. Data presented here has been weighted
to be representative of the whole graduating class, unless
otherwise indicated. 136 men and 144 women respon
ded to the mailed questionnaire, giving a response rate of
79%. The questionnaire and a discussion of research
procedures are presented in the Appendix.
I. THE NEW STANFORD WOMAN
Occupational Plans of the Class of 1972
Perhaps the most significant finding of the survey of
major and occupational choice is the similarity of the
plans of men and women students. In the past it was
assumed that most Stanford men would become profes
sionals or businessmen while Stanford women would
become housewives, school teachers, and secretaries.
This stereotype used to approximate reality. It is no
longer valid.
In the Stanford class of 1972, a similar proportion of
men and women plan to enter major professions. 69% of
the men and 53% of the women who have a single
definite long-range plan say they will become doctors,
lawyers, college professors and scientists. When this is
generalized to the entire class, (including those who have
vague plans or more than one plan), 28% of senior
women and 30% of senior men are definitely planning to
enter a major profession.
The following table shows the responses of those who
said they had definite long-range occupational plans.
Data representing the plans of the whole population,
including those who are uncertain, shows a very similar
pattern.

N=6B N=B4

It is apparent that the occupational choices of Stan
ford women do not fit into sexual stereotypes. Informa
tion on all the occupations which students considered at
Stanford shows that the women respondents began with
more traditional ideas as freshmen and moved away
from traditional considerations during their time at the
University.
Women and men not only have very similar occupa
tional plans, they also seem to have the same level of
commitment to their occupations and the same expecta
tions of success. As a measure of the seriousness of
occupational intent, students were asked how they had
prepared for their planned future occupations. The same
proportion of women and men said that they had pre
pared themselves by such activities as talking to individ
uals in the occupation, acquiring needed credentials or
training, and finding employment.
Expectations of success were measured by asking
students what ideally would be their occupation or main
activity in five years and what, realistically, they thought

they would be doing. Most students said they would
probably be engaged in their ideal occupations, (71% of
the men and 58% of the women). While fewer women
than men believe they will be engaged in their ideal
occupations, no more women than men think they will
be engaged in lower status occupations. Of those who do
not believe they will be engaged in their ideal occupa
tions, 26% of the men and 28% of the women said they
would probably be engaged in an occupation that vns
lower status than their ideal occupation.
The three most frequently mentioned ideal occupa
tions were medicine, law, and college educator-scientist.

Legal professions 15 15 7 7

N=loB N=l2s

As Table 2 shows, virtually all of the men and women
that aspire to these professions expect to reach their
goals, with the single exception of women who would
like to be college professors or scientists. 12% of the
women hold this ideal but only 7% believe they can
realistically attain it. This is by far the biggest gap
between ideal and realistic assessments for any sex or
occupation. It is interesting that women students have
the least confidence about the occupation to which they
have had the most exposure at Stanford: college profes
sor.
Educational Plans of the Class of 1972
The educational plans of graduating men and women
students are also quite similar. Just as many men as
women plan to go on for further education at some
point in the future, as Table 3 shows.

TABLE 3

7c Having definite educational plans 84.5 81.3
% Having uncertain educational plans 4.4 8.5

N=l33 N=l44

Approximately the same proportion of men and
women are also going on for graduate study in the next
six months, (54 percent of the men and 49 percent of
the women).
Doctoral and professional programs have traditionally
been filled with men, while women have tended to enter
masters programs. This trend is still apparent with this
year's Stanford graduates, but the gap is closing. 52% of
the women and 74% of the men who said they were
going on for further education are planning to get a
doctorate, or a degree in law or medicine. 41% of the
women and 23% of the men are getting Masters degrees.
The remaining students will be getting technical licenses,
professional B.A.s or certificates of some kind.
A Comparison of Senior Women in 1965 and 1972
The plans of graduating Stanford women have
changed dramatically in the past few years. Data gather
ed on the Class of 1965 by the Institute for the Study of
Human Problems shows striking differences from the
Class of 1972. In "Career and Autonomy in College
Women," Joseph Katz draws the following conclusion:
.. .even in as academically able a group of students
as the Stanford women, the orientation toward
occupational roles is a very "traditional" one, even
though, as we will later see, there is a high valua
tion of the occupational life. .. .the women are
oriented towards family and their biggest occupa
tional aspiration is elementary and secondary
school teaching.
Similar findings have been reported by many other stud
ies of the occupational plans of women students in the
1950s and the early 1960s.
The following table compares the occupational plans
of women graduating in 1965 and 1972, and shows how
much Stanford undergraduates have changed in the past
7 years. The data for the two time periods are not
completely comparable, since different research pro
cedures were used in the two studies. However, the
comparisons between men and women within each time
period are valid.
The table shows a dramatic rise in the proportion of
women interested in the professions, and a sharp de
crease in the proportion who intend to be teachers.
These changes are clear, even though the 1972 data
represents women's most pessimistic estimates of their
future occupations, i.e., their realistic assessments of
what they would be doing in five years, as opposed to
their occupational plans.

In 1965, the ratio of men to women planning to
♦enter professions was 6to 1; in 1972 the ratio is 1.6 to
1. The proportion of women planning to enter elemen
tary and secondary education has decreased from 36% to
10% and the same proportion of men and women now
plan to enter business.
Stanford women have changed their conceptions of
their marital and childbearing roles, as well as their
occupational and education plans. Katz's respondents
were acutely aware of their future roles as wives and
mothers, and most assumed that their occupational goals
would be secondary to their duties to their husbands and
children. 70% of these women said they would not work
at all when their children were under 6 years old, and
only 43% intended to work full time when their children
were over 12 years of age.
Stanford women no longer think along these lines.
The 1972 respondents were not asked directly about
their plans for marriage and childrearing, but the women
were given ample opportunity to mention the future role
of wife and mother. Few women ever mentioned the
topic.
In one series of questions, we asked women what
they were planning to do after graduation, and how long
they planned to continue in that activity. Traditional
patterns led us to expect that a significant proportion of
the women would say they planned to work either until
they had put their husbands through school, or until it
was time to raise children. Only 3% of the women
who were leaving college to work said they would stop
when their husbands had finished school, and only 7%
said they would stop to raise children. Traditional role
expectations still exist at Stanford, but they are the
exception rather than the rule.
This conclusion is also supported by their responses
about "ideal" and "real" future activities. Only 3% of
the women said that, ideally, they would be housewives
in five years and an additional .4% thought that real
istically they would be housewives at that time. In five
years, most of these women will be 26 or 27 years old,
an age at which, in the past, a majority of women
already have small children. However, only 15% of the
women said that they realistically expected childraising
and housework to be a major activity, in addition to
some kind of employment. In all, only 18.5% of the
women mentioned the role of wife and mother as part of
their main activities in the next 5 years.
In sum, the data show that Stanford women have
broken away from traditional stereotypes about "the
woman's role" in the last seven years. Women and men
now have very similar occupational and educational
plans. Women no longer seem to regard a job as "some
thing to fall back on." They take their plans seriously,
and they expect to succeed.
Policy Implications
1. It is important that all members of the Stanford
community — administrators, professors, advisers, and
counsellors — understand the new aspirations of women
undergraduates. The best cure for sex-role stereotypes is
information. For this reason, the findings of this study
should be publicized as widely as possible. We recom
mend that the Dean of Undergraduate Studies and the
Provost take steps to ensure that the findings of this
study are communicated to all professors, advisers,
counsellors and administrators, especially those who
have extensive contact with undergraduates.
2. Stanford University as an institution employing over
7,000 men and women is responsible for setting an
example by eliminating all discriminatory hiring and
promotional practices. The administration should con
tinue to give high priority to its affirmative action ef
forts, and to publicize them as widely as possible.
11. SEX ROLE EXPECTATIONS AND THE STAN
FORD ENVIRONMENT
Knowing that Stanford men and women share sub
stantially the same aspirations, it is important to ask
whether Stanford's treatment of its students is consis
tent with these aspirations. Are Stanford women dis
couraged from entering traditionally male fields and
seeking careers in predominantly male areas? Are they
encouraged to be housewives and school teachers, when
many would prefer to be doctors and professors?
By and large, the answer to these questions appears to
be no. Most women do not believe that they encounter
ed discrimination while they were at Stanford, but a
significant number of Stanford women have been in
fluenced to limit their educational and occupational
choices because of their sex. Most departments and
professors do not discriminate against women; but some
do.
Experience with Discrimination
When asked, "do you feel you have been discouraged
from any academic or occupational goals by a member
of the Stanford community because of your sex?" 29 of
the 128 women who responded said yes. This generalizes
to 23% of all Stanford women. Another 5% of the
women experienced discrimination but were not dis
couraged by it. Most of these women were discouraged
by contacts with faculty members.

In all, almost one-quarter of Stanford women are
discouraged by discrimination. The forms which this
discrimination takes range from explicit discouragement
from a professor to more subtle environmental cues. The
observations of some of the women respondents illus
trate this quite clearly. The following quotations drawn
from survey responses illustrate overt discouragement of
women by their advisers:
Dr. X, a pre-med adviser, had a dim view of the
possibility of women actually making it through
all the work necessary to be a doctor, and later of
her juggling work, children, etc. .. .There were 2
other girls in our advisee group. He said he didn 't
expect to see us the next year.. . .
Not only my major adviser, but several of my
professors in my department failed to offer any
encouragement or assistance and in some cases
actively discouraged me from further study in
mathematics - both when I sought advice and
approval for advanced study and when I sought
assistance and consultation in courses I was taking.
A largely negative reaction (at best, I was ignored)
from male peers in math and science classes was
also quite evident.
My history adviser specifically discouraged me
from going on to grad school. He kept suggesting
high school teaching as "more flexible for a
woman." And he did this even after I took several
courses from him in which I did very well. He even
urged me to take on the honors thesis program.
Other women described comments made by professors
during lectures as a source of discouragement:
I took a class in (chemistry) from Dr. X - a
required course for many med schools. He began
his first lecture by saying there were 2 things he
couldn 't stand — premeds and women who
thought they could be scientists. His actions were
consistent with his prejudices.
One art teacher, XX, believes that women make
better art teachers than artists - his suggestions to
this effect have been to classes as a whole, not to
me individually, but I think that his underlying
sexism affects his relationship with me although he
shows a respect for my work.
Some women found assessments of the employment
situation for women in some fields more discouraging
than helpful:
I have been told of personal experience of the bias
against women in university level teaching. I would
not seek employment as a member of an academic
community (university).
. . .advisers have given me "realistic appraisals
which were very discouraging.
Finally, some women did not describe a direct communi
cation at all, but a sense they had from what was around
them:
It's difficult to be specific - one carries with him
the prejudices; I wish now I had gone pre-med; I
would like to be a doctor but women weren't
doctors; and women didn't go on to be English
professors - I didn 7 look much beyond teaching
- and no one suggested anything else.
Though discouragement has not been overt (ex
cept in a couple of cases where people couldn't
understand why I couldn't be happy teaching in
high school) there is a lot of subtle discourage
ment. 1) The lack of female professors which
really presents a problem in terms of role identity,
2) the number of professors that give only a nega
tive account of their role (Idon't understand why
they're still in it), 3) a disbelief, from both profes
sors and students, that I can combine being a
woman with being a professor, 4) the way I see
female professors now being treated (i.e. difficulty
in obtaining tenure, refusal to see their courses as
anything but "fun" (both professors and stu
dents), insinuations about their teaching ability
and/or intelligence related to sex, etc.).
Policy Implications
Overt discouragement of women wishing to enter
"male" fields and professions should not exist at Stan
ford in 1972. To counter such sexism when it results
from ignorance, an effort should be made to increase
awareness of the fact that women are capable of doing
"male jobs" and succeeding in "male fields," and that
many women do successfully combine professional and
childrearing responsibilities. Any professor or counsellor
who continues to discourage women students because of
their sex should not be asked to advise them. We recom
mend that the Dean of Undergraduate Studies develop a
list of advisers that are particularly interested in working
with women undergraduates. Students should be in
formed that they have the option of choosing someone
from this list to replace their current adviser. In addi
tion, the Dean of Undergraduate Studies should consider
developing procedures by which students can register
complaints if they experience discrimination from their
adviser.
111. CHOICE OF MAJORS
Just as some occupations are usually seen as "men's
jobs" and others as "women's jobs," so some academic
fields are seen as primarily "male" or "female." The
traditional perceptions of appropriate fields for men and
women closely fit the actual proportions of each sex
majoring in these fields at Stanford today. The science
fields have few women, the humanities many more than
their share. Students' changes between majors were
assessed in order to find out if this distribution was due
to interests and orientations acquired before students
entered Stanford, or if the Stanford environment was in
some way encouraging sex-typed choices of major fields.
The results show that students do tend to move into
fields dominated by their own sex while they are at
Stanford. Women more than men switch out of fields
such as Political Science and into fields like English and
Music. More men than women move into fields which
already have a large number of men and out of fields
with a larger proportion s of women. While students are
breaking traditiojn in their careqr N choices, they are per
petuating the, sex-typing of majoi; fields.
. ' \ v v • \ \ \ r •. * > *
of switching between majors, fields
were categorized as cither maje-dominated or non-male
dominated. All fields having less than 25% wom'en'were
, male-dominated, rest,, non-male-dominated.
(j3)S% of, Stanford undergraduates are women.) Male
dominated fields were further divided into science and
non-science fields. Students were asked about the field
ip vyhich' they expressed'an interest time they
were accepted to Stanfo'rd, (referred to as'their
man field of interest"), their first major, and the'major
with which they graduated.
Tn Ihe male-domma'ted sbifcnce fields, Stanford stu
dents appear to bring th v eir sex role stereotypes with
them.'Many mo're freshmen men. than women are inter
ested in these fields; but there is no change towards
greater sexvtyped choice between the freshman and
senior year. "Science fields, retain and attract an equal
proportion of men and women majors.
The fields where Stanford students increasingly make
their choices in terms of sex role stereotypes are the
male dominated, nonscience fields: economics, history,
political science, philosophy, architecture and urban de
sign. Of those students who were interested in these
fields as freshmen, more men than women remained in
these fields until they graduated (60% vs. 53%). More
over, in recruiting new majors, these fields attract many
more men than women. Nonscience male-dominated
fields attract 45% of the men who come to Stanford
interested in non-male-dominated fields, and only 10%
of the women.
Students who come to Stanford without a clear field
of interest seem to be most influenced by pressures to
select a field that is "appropriate" for their sex. The
students who said they were considering both a male
dominated and a non-male-dominated field when they
were accepted to Stanford showed almost no sex-typed
switching. (3% of all freshmen men and 7% of all fresh
men women were in this category.) On the other hand,
the final majors of those who were undecided as entering
freshmen and were not interested in any particular field,
can be almost entirely predicted by sex-typing. 79% of
these men graduated in male-dominated fields, 21% in
non-male-dominated fields. 27% of the undecided
women graduated in male-dominated fields, and 70% in
non-male-dominated fields. (20% of freshmen women
and 26% of freshmen men were undecided.)
The fact that students who come to Stanford with no
idea of what they want to do show the most sex-typed
behavior would seem to indicate that the University
environment influences students to make this kind of
choice. However, when students were asked why they
made the choices they did, such pressures from the
University were not evident. Women were not advised to
shift out of male-dominated fields any more often than
they were encouraged to shift into them. They did not
respond that experienced or anticipated discrimination
was a reason for such shifts, nor did they feel less
capable of succeeding in male-dominated fields. The
reasons which women give for changing majors do not
explain the pattern of sex-typed switching.
Most of the women's sex-typed switching occurred
between the time of their acceptance to Stanford and
•the time they declared their first major (by the end of
their sophomore years). This tendency for sex-typed
major choice to be more frequent in the freshman and
sophomore years has two possible explanations. Stu
dents may act more traditionally when they are younger
or sex-role stereotypes may have been more dominant at
Stanford three and four years ago.
i
Plans for graduate study also show some of the sex
typing. While more students plan graduate study in male

dominated than in non-male-dominated fields, in gen
eral, twice as many men as women do so. 45% of t,he
women and 86% of-the men with definite educational
i plaas, are going on in male-dominpted fields. , , \

Policy Implications ■ > < '. i i i - ! . . •< •„>
The overwhelming predominance' of men iri certain
social science and humanities fields is perpetuated as
women tend to avoid and leave these fields while thtfy
are at Stanford. These departments -*■ economics, his
tory, philosophy, political science, architecture and
urban design — should investigate this situation, looking,
in particular, at their introductory classes. The sciences,
which attract few women students, seem to be dealing
with a phenomenon inherited from the high schools. All
departments with few women majors should make an
effort to attract them. One obvious step in this direction
is to increase the number of women teaching in these
fields.
We recommend that departments with fewer than
25% women majors should experiment with ways of
attracting more women majors (such as distributing writ
ten materials through the Academic Information Center
or encouraging current women majors to discuss the
department's program with other women). These depart
ments should also determine the proportion of women
undergraduates that join and leave their undergraduate
program. Departments may wish to confer with the
Committee on the Employment and Education of
Women about methods for recruiting women, and they
should report their progress to the Committee by the
end of Spring Quarter, 1973.
IV. ACADEMIC AND OCCUPATIONAL COUNSEL
LING
The survey shows that many students find Stanford

services helpful at some point in their undergraduate
careers, but very few feel that Stanford's advisers or
counsellors have affected their occupational plans. Stu
dents were asked specifically about their contacts with
their freshman advisers, academic advisers, and career
counsellors in the placement center. Only a small pro
portion felt that these people had had any effect on
their occupational plans.

Advising and Sex-Roles
One question asked of the data was whether or not
men and womcjri were advised to chodsb fields "appro
priate to their'sex. In only one'case did this trend seem
apparept. There is some indication that the advice of
freshmen advisers reflected sex-role stereotypes. 4 of the
5 students who said they were discouraged by their
freshmen advisers were women and all of the women
were discouraged in male fields. This bias did not appear
ill responses about academic advisers and career counsel
lors. Studtnis tvere' also -asked about' the nature of the
boMattis'with their advisers which affected therin occupa
tional considerations. It is significant that one-quarter of
HHe wtlrti&n 1 whose occupational plans had b&eivaffected
■by l e!dritkets with ah advis'er or counsellor said that the
tridifttibaP hdd disdissed se* discrimination in the area
CoiTside'rihg.' Advisers are most influential as
fol£ rhollels. WhCri students were risked to "check the
statements' which; you feel accurately describe the nature
of 1 the contacts With your'freshman, adviser which affec
ted! ybur occupational consideration,"' the most fre
quently checked response was "Adviser acted as a posi
tive example of Individual in field." "Adviser acted as 1 a
negative example of individual in field" was also checked
frequently, and woijien students found advisers
equally important as role models. It is important to
note, however, that the large majority of these advisers
are men.
Suggestions for Improvements
Students were asked to respond to two open ended
questions about Stanford services: "What services that
Stanford now offers, if any, have been helpful to you in
planning your future:" and "What services which are not
now offered would you find helpful:" 60% of the 136
men answering the questionnaire and 54% of the 144
women mentioned some service at Stanford which had
been helpful to them. (These percentages refer to pro
portion of respondents. They have not been weighted to
represent the whole class.) Those services mentioned
most frequently were the Academic Information Center,
(41 times), the Career Counselling and Placement Cen
ter, (39 times), and the pre-med advising services, (18
times). 51 men and 61 women suggested improvements
in Stanford services. The most frequent target of sugges
tions were the departments, especially among women.
32 women and 15 men said that departments should be
more helpful in planning their futures. Helping students
plan their futures would be a new role for departments.
Only 11 students said their departments had actually
been helpful while they were at Stanford, and most of

the praise resulted from opportunities for practical ex
perience in their fields, not from advice or information
they had received.
Generally, students said they would have liked more
informal, personal contacts with professors, counsellors,
and people in the fields they are considering to give
them a better sense of what they wanted to do in the
future. One student suggested:

a broad, coordinated counselling service, with
competent people who can talk meaningfully
about a variety of occupations and lifestyles those
occupations shape. (Not just an engineering coun
sellor for engineering, an econ adviser for econ,
etc.)
i>i 112 c / . ' ! ; i ) I
Departments were suggested as an alternative source of
information about the employment possibilities stem
ming from a field of study.
A larger proportion of women than men students
have immediate need of career counselling and place
ment services. More of the women are planning to get a
full-time job as soon as they leave Stanford. 29% of the
women and 18% of the men said they expected to be
working full-time in the six months after graduation.
Women also seem to need more help in finding jobs. 26%
of the women who were planning to work full-time after
graduation have already looked for jobs in the area in
which they wanted to work, and only 7% had found
jobs. 18% of the men had looked for employment, and
11% had found jobs. Therefore, it is particularly im
portant for women students that occupational counsel
ling services be improved.
Policy Implications
1. The Career Planning and Placement Center should
make a special effort to help women plan their careers
and find jobs. Since a large number of women are trying
to find jobs in areas where few women have been hired
before, the Placement Center should make aggressive
efforts to place these women.
We recommend that the Career Planning and Place
ment Center report on what activities and what addi
tional staff are required in order to provide better service
to women undergraduates.
2. Women should be prepared to cope with discrimina
tion when they encounter it. We recommend that legal
and practical counselling about dealing with discrimina
tion be made available at the Placement Center.
3. Major department should be involved in occupation
counselling efforts. The experience and contacts of Stan
ford professors remain a largely untapped resource. As
some students suggested, departments should institute
programs in conjunction with the Career Planning and
Placement Center which offer an overview of the occu
pations open to men and women with training in differ
ent academic fields. Women should be well represented
in all such programs.
Wc recommend that each department provide a pro
gram of occupational counselling for its men and women
majors, either on its own or in conjunction with the
Career Planning and Placement Center.
4. Our data shows that advisers and counsellors current
ly discuss the problem of discrimination with their
women students. As several students suggested, this kind
of discussion can often be more discouraging than help
ful. Stanford advisers and counsellors need to be sensi
tive to the fine line between a fatalistic discussion of
discrimination and one that prepares women to meet the
difficulties they will encounter with determination in
stead of with surprise.
We recommend that the Dean of Students Office
develop written material and discussion sessions for ad
visers and counsellors that will orient them to the special
needs of women students.
5. Role modeling is an important function of Stanford
advisers. Yet most Stanford professors are men. There
fore. students have few opportunities to meet successful
professional women and to observe alternative ap
proaches to being a working woman or a working
mother. We recommend that the Dean of Students en
courage the participation of professional women in Uni
versity public functions and in activities at University
residences, until there are more women on the faculty.
Space paid for by News and Publications
Following are the highlights of a report on the Stan
ford woman student in 1972 as compiled by the Com
mittee on the Education and Employment of Women in
the University.
For full copies of the report, please call Nancy
Donham, ext. 4631.
THE STANFORD WOMAN IN 1972
A survey of the senior class of 1972 shows that the
Stanford undergraduate woman has changed remarkably
over the past five years.' She no longer accepts the
traditional roles which society has assigned to her as a
member of the female sex. Graduating men and women
seniors have very similar educational and occupational
aspirations. There is little difference between the propor
tions of women and men who plan to become profes
sionals: doctors, lawyers, college professors, and scien
tists. And the same proportions of men and women plan
to go on for graduate study.
Sex discrimination occurs at Stanford but its inci
dence is limited. Almost one-fourth the graduating seni
or women say they were discouraged from some goal by
sex discrimination while they were at Stanford. And
changes between major fields can to some extent be
predicted by the sex of the student and the traditional
sexual composition of the majors.
This report presents the results of a survey of Stan
ford seniors and makes recommendations on how the
University can end discrimination and provide more op
portunities for women. The first section of the report
considers the educational and occupational plans of men
and women undergraduates in 1972 and in 1965. The
second section concerns sex-role expectations and the
Stanford environment. It discusses women's experiences
of discrimination at Stanford, and the pattern of choos
ing majors which perpetuates the existence of predomi
nantly male fields. The third section discusses the effects
of academic and occupation counselling at Stanford. The
Committee's recommendations are summarized at the
end of the report.
The data presented in this report is the result of a
survey of 280 graduating seniors conducted in the Spring
of 1972. The questionnaire, "A Survey of Major and
Occupational Choice," was designed to find out what
fields Stanford undergraduates choose for their studies
and future jobs, and how the University environment
influences their choices. Recipients of the questionnaire
were randomly chosen in groups by sex and the aca
demic field in which they were interested when they
entered Stanford. Data presented here has been weighted
to be representative of the whole graduating class, unless
otherwise indicated. 136 men and 144 women respon
ded to the mailed questionnaire, giving a response rate of
79%. The questionnaire and a discussion of research
procedures are presented in the Appendix.
I. THE NEW STANFORD WOMAN
Occupational Plans of the Class of 1972
Perhaps the most significant finding of the survey of
major and occupational choice is the similarity of the
plans of men and women students. In the past it was
assumed that most Stanford men would become profes
sionals or businessmen while Stanford women would
become housewives, school teachers, and secretaries.
This stereotype used to approximate reality. It is no
longer valid.
In the Stanford class of 1972, a similar proportion of
men and women plan to enter major professions. 69% of
the men and 53% of the women who have a single
definite long-range plan say they will become doctors,
lawyers, college professors and scientists. When this is
generalized to the entire class, (including those who have
vague plans or more than one plan), 28% of senior
women and 30% of senior men are definitely planning to
enter a major profession.
The following table shows the responses of those who
said they had definite long-range occupational plans.
Data representing the plans of the whole population,
including those who are uncertain, shows a very similar
pattern.

It is apparent that the occupational choices of Stan
ford women do not fit into sexual stereotypes. Informa
tion on all the occupations which students considered at
Stanford shows that the women respondents began with
more traditional ideas as freshmen and moved away
from traditional considerations during their time at the
University.
Women and men not only have very similar occupa
tional plans, they also seem to have the same level of
commitment to their occupations and the same expecta
tions of success. As a measure of the seriousness of
occupational intent, students were asked how they had
prepared for their planned future occupations. The same
proportion of women and men said that they had pre
pared themselves by such activities as talking to individ
uals in the occupation, acquiring needed credentials or
training, and finding employment.
Expectations of success were measured by asking
students what ideally would be their occupation or main
activity in five years and what, realistically, they thought

they would be doing. Most students said they would
probably be engaged in their ideal occupations, (71% of
the men and 58% of the women). While fewer women
than men believe they will be engaged in their ideal
occupations, no more women than men think they will
be engaged in lower status occupations. Of those who do
not believe they will be engaged in their ideal occupa
tions, 26% of the men and 28% of the women said they
would probably be engaged in an occupation that vns
lower status than their ideal occupation.
The three most frequently mentioned ideal occupa
tions were medicine, law, and college educator-scientist.

As Table 2 shows, virtually all of the men and women
that aspire to these professions expect to reach their
goals, with the single exception of women who would
like to be college professors or scientists. 12% of the
women hold this ideal but only 7% believe they can
realistically attain it. This is by far the biggest gap
between ideal and realistic assessments for any sex or
occupation. It is interesting that women students have
the least confidence about the occupation to which they
have had the most exposure at Stanford: college profes
sor.
Educational Plans of the Class of 1972
The educational plans of graduating men and women
students are also quite similar. Just as many men as
women plan to go on for further education at some
point in the future, as Table 3 shows.

TABLE 3

7c Having definite educational plans 84.5 81.3
% Having uncertain educational plans 4.4 8.5

N=l33 N=l44

Approximately the same proportion of men and
women are also going on for graduate study in the next
six months, (54 percent of the men and 49 percent of
the women).
Doctoral and professional programs have traditionally
been filled with men, while women have tended to enter
masters programs. This trend is still apparent with this
year's Stanford graduates, but the gap is closing. 52% of
the women and 74% of the men who said they were
going on for further education are planning to get a
doctorate, or a degree in law or medicine. 41% of the
women and 23% of the men are getting Masters degrees.
The remaining students will be getting technical licenses,
professional B.A.s or certificates of some kind.
A Comparison of Senior Women in 1965 and 1972
The plans of graduating Stanford women have
changed dramatically in the past few years. Data gather
ed on the Class of 1965 by the Institute for the Study of
Human Problems shows striking differences from the
Class of 1972. In "Career and Autonomy in College
Women," Joseph Katz draws the following conclusion:
.. .even in as academically able a group of students
as the Stanford women, the orientation toward
occupational roles is a very "traditional" one, even
though, as we will later see, there is a high valua
tion of the occupational life. .. .the women are
oriented towards family and their biggest occupa
tional aspiration is elementary and secondary
school teaching.
Similar findings have been reported by many other stud
ies of the occupational plans of women students in the
1950s and the early 1960s.
The following table compares the occupational plans
of women graduating in 1965 and 1972, and shows how
much Stanford undergraduates have changed in the past
7 years. The data for the two time periods are not
completely comparable, since different research pro
cedures were used in the two studies. However, the
comparisons between men and women within each time
period are valid.
The table shows a dramatic rise in the proportion of
women interested in the professions, and a sharp de
crease in the proportion who intend to be teachers.
These changes are clear, even though the 1972 data
represents women's most pessimistic estimates of their
future occupations, i.e., their realistic assessments of
what they would be doing in five years, as opposed to
their occupational plans.

In 1965, the ratio of men to women planning to
♦enter professions was 6to 1; in 1972 the ratio is 1.6 to
1. The proportion of women planning to enter elemen
tary and secondary education has decreased from 36% to
10% and the same proportion of men and women now
plan to enter business.
Stanford women have changed their conceptions of
their marital and childbearing roles, as well as their
occupational and education plans. Katz's respondents
were acutely aware of their future roles as wives and
mothers, and most assumed that their occupational goals
would be secondary to their duties to their husbands and
children. 70% of these women said they would not work
at all when their children were under 6 years old, and
only 43% intended to work full time when their children
were over 12 years of age.
Stanford women no longer think along these lines.
The 1972 respondents were not asked directly about
their plans for marriage and childrearing, but the women
were given ample opportunity to mention the future role
of wife and mother. Few women ever mentioned the
topic.
In one series of questions, we asked women what
they were planning to do after graduation, and how long
they planned to continue in that activity. Traditional
patterns led us to expect that a significant proportion of
the women would say they planned to work either until
they had put their husbands through school, or until it
was time to raise children. Only 3% of the women
who were leaving college to work said they would stop
when their husbands had finished school, and only 7%
said they would stop to raise children. Traditional role
expectations still exist at Stanford, but they are the
exception rather than the rule.
This conclusion is also supported by their responses
about "ideal" and "real" future activities. Only 3% of
the women said that, ideally, they would be housewives
in five years and an additional .4% thought that real
istically they would be housewives at that time. In five
years, most of these women will be 26 or 27 years old,
an age at which, in the past, a majority of women
already have small children. However, only 15% of the
women said that they realistically expected childraising
and housework to be a major activity, in addition to
some kind of employment. In all, only 18.5% of the
women mentioned the role of wife and mother as part of
their main activities in the next 5 years.
In sum, the data show that Stanford women have
broken away from traditional stereotypes about "the
woman's role" in the last seven years. Women and men
now have very similar occupational and educational
plans. Women no longer seem to regard a job as "some
thing to fall back on." They take their plans seriously,
and they expect to succeed.
Policy Implications
1. It is important that all members of the Stanford
community — administrators, professors, advisers, and
counsellors — understand the new aspirations of women
undergraduates. The best cure for sex-role stereotypes is
information. For this reason, the findings of this study
should be publicized as widely as possible. We recom
mend that the Dean of Undergraduate Studies and the
Provost take steps to ensure that the findings of this
study are communicated to all professors, advisers,
counsellors and administrators, especially those who
have extensive contact with undergraduates.
2. Stanford University as an institution employing over
7,000 men and women is responsible for setting an
example by eliminating all discriminatory hiring and
promotional practices. The administration should con
tinue to give high priority to its affirmative action ef
forts, and to publicize them as widely as possible.
11. SEX ROLE EXPECTATIONS AND THE STAN
FORD ENVIRONMENT
Knowing that Stanford men and women share sub
stantially the same aspirations, it is important to ask
whether Stanford's treatment of its students is consis
tent with these aspirations. Are Stanford women dis
couraged from entering traditionally male fields and
seeking careers in predominantly male areas? Are they
encouraged to be housewives and school teachers, when
many would prefer to be doctors and professors?
By and large, the answer to these questions appears to
be no. Most women do not believe that they encounter
ed discrimination while they were at Stanford, but a
significant number of Stanford women have been in
fluenced to limit their educational and occupational
choices because of their sex. Most departments and
professors do not discriminate against women; but some
do.
Experience with Discrimination
When asked, "do you feel you have been discouraged
from any academic or occupational goals by a member
of the Stanford community because of your sex?" 29 of
the 128 women who responded said yes. This generalizes
to 23% of all Stanford women. Another 5% of the
women experienced discrimination but were not dis
couraged by it. Most of these women were discouraged
by contacts with faculty members.

In all, almost one-quarter of Stanford women are
discouraged by discrimination. The forms which this
discrimination takes range from explicit discouragement
from a professor to more subtle environmental cues. The
observations of some of the women respondents illus
trate this quite clearly. The following quotations drawn
from survey responses illustrate overt discouragement of
women by their advisers:
Dr. X, a pre-med adviser, had a dim view of the
possibility of women actually making it through
all the work necessary to be a doctor, and later of
her juggling work, children, etc. .. .There were 2
other girls in our advisee group. He said he didn 't
expect to see us the next year.. . .
Not only my major adviser, but several of my
professors in my department failed to offer any
encouragement or assistance and in some cases
actively discouraged me from further study in
mathematics - both when I sought advice and
approval for advanced study and when I sought
assistance and consultation in courses I was taking.
A largely negative reaction (at best, I was ignored)
from male peers in math and science classes was
also quite evident.
My history adviser specifically discouraged me
from going on to grad school. He kept suggesting
high school teaching as "more flexible for a
woman." And he did this even after I took several
courses from him in which I did very well. He even
urged me to take on the honors thesis program.
Other women described comments made by professors
during lectures as a source of discouragement:
I took a class in (chemistry) from Dr. X - a
required course for many med schools. He began
his first lecture by saying there were 2 things he
couldn 't stand — premeds and women who
thought they could be scientists. His actions were
consistent with his prejudices.
One art teacher, XX, believes that women make
better art teachers than artists - his suggestions to
this effect have been to classes as a whole, not to
me individually, but I think that his underlying
sexism affects his relationship with me although he
shows a respect for my work.
Some women found assessments of the employment
situation for women in some fields more discouraging
than helpful:
I have been told of personal experience of the bias
against women in university level teaching. I would
not seek employment as a member of an academic
community (university).
. . .advisers have given me "realistic appraisals
which were very discouraging.
Finally, some women did not describe a direct communi
cation at all, but a sense they had from what was around
them:
It's difficult to be specific - one carries with him
the prejudices; I wish now I had gone pre-med; I
would like to be a doctor but women weren't
doctors; and women didn't go on to be English
professors - I didn 7 look much beyond teaching
- and no one suggested anything else.
Though discouragement has not been overt (ex
cept in a couple of cases where people couldn't
understand why I couldn't be happy teaching in
high school) there is a lot of subtle discourage
ment. 1) The lack of female professors which
really presents a problem in terms of role identity,
2) the number of professors that give only a nega
tive account of their role (Idon't understand why
they're still in it), 3) a disbelief, from both profes
sors and students, that I can combine being a
woman with being a professor, 4) the way I see
female professors now being treated (i.e. difficulty
in obtaining tenure, refusal to see their courses as
anything but "fun" (both professors and stu
dents), insinuations about their teaching ability
and/or intelligence related to sex, etc.).
Policy Implications
Overt discouragement of women wishing to enter
"male" fields and professions should not exist at Stan
ford in 1972. To counter such sexism when it results
from ignorance, an effort should be made to increase
awareness of the fact that women are capable of doing
"male jobs" and succeeding in "male fields," and that
many women do successfully combine professional and
childrearing responsibilities. Any professor or counsellor
who continues to discourage women students because of
their sex should not be asked to advise them. We recom
mend that the Dean of Undergraduate Studies develop a
list of advisers that are particularly interested in working
with women undergraduates. Students should be in
formed that they have the option of choosing someone
from this list to replace their current adviser. In addi
tion, the Dean of Undergraduate Studies should consider
developing procedures by which students can register
complaints if they experience discrimination from their
adviser.
111. CHOICE OF MAJORS
Just as some occupations are usually seen as "men's
jobs" and others as "women's jobs," so some academic
fields are seen as primarily "male" or "female." The
traditional perceptions of appropriate fields for men and
women closely fit the actual proportions of each sex
majoring in these fields at Stanford today. The science
fields have few women, the humanities many more than
their share. Students' changes between majors were
assessed in order to find out if this distribution was due
to interests and orientations acquired before students
entered Stanford, or if the Stanford environment was in
some way encouraging sex-typed choices of major fields.
The results show that students do tend to move into
fields dominated by their own sex while they are at
Stanford. Women more than men switch out of fields
such as Political Science and into fields like English and
Music. More men than women move into fields which
already have a large number of men and out of fields
with a larger proportion s of women. While students are
breaking traditiojn in their careqr N choices, they are per
petuating the, sex-typing of majoi; fields.
. ' \ v v • \ \ \ r •. * > *
of switching between majors, fields
were categorized as cither maje-dominated or non-male
dominated. All fields having less than 25% wom'en'were
, male-dominated, rest,, non-male-dominated.
(j3)S% of, Stanford undergraduates are women.) Male
dominated fields were further divided into science and
non-science fields. Students were asked about the field
ip vyhich' they expressed'an interest time they
were accepted to Stanfo'rd, (referred to as'their
man field of interest"), their first major, and the'major
with which they graduated.
Tn Ihe male-domma'ted sbifcnce fields, Stanford stu
dents appear to bring th v eir sex role stereotypes with
them.'Many mo're freshmen men. than women are inter
ested in these fields; but there is no change towards
greater sexvtyped choice between the freshman and
senior year. "Science fields, retain and attract an equal
proportion of men and women majors.
The fields where Stanford students increasingly make
their choices in terms of sex role stereotypes are the
male dominated, nonscience fields: economics, history,
political science, philosophy, architecture and urban de
sign. Of those students who were interested in these
fields as freshmen, more men than women remained in
these fields until they graduated (60% vs. 53%). More
over, in recruiting new majors, these fields attract many
more men than women. Nonscience male-dominated
fields attract 45% of the men who come to Stanford
interested in non-male-dominated fields, and only 10%
of the women.
Students who come to Stanford without a clear field
of interest seem to be most influenced by pressures to
select a field that is "appropriate" for their sex. The
students who said they were considering both a male
dominated and a non-male-dominated field when they
were accepted to Stanford showed almost no sex-typed
switching. (3% of all freshmen men and 7% of all fresh
men women were in this category.) On the other hand,
the final majors of those who were undecided as entering
freshmen and were not interested in any particular field,
can be almost entirely predicted by sex-typing. 79% of
these men graduated in male-dominated fields, 21% in
non-male-dominated fields. 27% of the undecided
women graduated in male-dominated fields, and 70% in
non-male-dominated fields. (20% of freshmen women
and 26% of freshmen men were undecided.)
The fact that students who come to Stanford with no
idea of what they want to do show the most sex-typed
behavior would seem to indicate that the University
environment influences students to make this kind of
choice. However, when students were asked why they
made the choices they did, such pressures from the
University were not evident. Women were not advised to
shift out of male-dominated fields any more often than
they were encouraged to shift into them. They did not
respond that experienced or anticipated discrimination
was a reason for such shifts, nor did they feel less
capable of succeeding in male-dominated fields. The
reasons which women give for changing majors do not
explain the pattern of sex-typed switching.
Most of the women's sex-typed switching occurred
between the time of their acceptance to Stanford and
•the time they declared their first major (by the end of
their sophomore years). This tendency for sex-typed
major choice to be more frequent in the freshman and
sophomore years has two possible explanations. Stu
dents may act more traditionally when they are younger
or sex-role stereotypes may have been more dominant at
Stanford three and four years ago.
i
Plans for graduate study also show some of the sex
typing. While more students plan graduate study in male

dominated than in non-male-dominated fields, in gen
eral, twice as many men as women do so. 45% of t,he
women and 86% of-the men with definite educational
i plaas, are going on in male-dominpted fields. , , \

Policy Implications ■ > < '. i i i - ! . . •< •„>
The overwhelming predominance' of men iri certain
social science and humanities fields is perpetuated as
women tend to avoid and leave these fields while thtfy
are at Stanford. These departments -*■ economics, his
tory, philosophy, political science, architecture and
urban design — should investigate this situation, looking,
in particular, at their introductory classes. The sciences,
which attract few women students, seem to be dealing
with a phenomenon inherited from the high schools. All
departments with few women majors should make an
effort to attract them. One obvious step in this direction
is to increase the number of women teaching in these
fields.
We recommend that departments with fewer than
25% women majors should experiment with ways of
attracting more women majors (such as distributing writ
ten materials through the Academic Information Center
or encouraging current women majors to discuss the
department's program with other women). These depart
ments should also determine the proportion of women
undergraduates that join and leave their undergraduate
program. Departments may wish to confer with the
Committee on the Employment and Education of
Women about methods for recruiting women, and they
should report their progress to the Committee by the
end of Spring Quarter, 1973.
IV. ACADEMIC AND OCCUPATIONAL COUNSEL
LING
The survey shows that many students find Stanford

services helpful at some point in their undergraduate
careers, but very few feel that Stanford's advisers or
counsellors have affected their occupational plans. Stu
dents were asked specifically about their contacts with
their freshman advisers, academic advisers, and career
counsellors in the placement center. Only a small pro
portion felt that these people had had any effect on
their occupational plans.

Advising and Sex-Roles
One question asked of the data was whether or not
men and womcjri were advised to chodsb fields "appro
priate to their'sex. In only one'case did this trend seem
apparept. There is some indication that the advice of
freshmen advisers reflected sex-role stereotypes. 4 of the
5 students who said they were discouraged by their
freshmen advisers were women and all of the women
were discouraged in male fields. This bias did not appear
ill responses about academic advisers and career counsel
lors. Studtnis tvere' also -asked about' the nature of the
boMattis'with their advisers which affected therin occupa
tional considerations. It is significant that one-quarter of
HHe wtlrti&n 1 whose occupational plans had b&eivaffected
■by l e!dritkets with ah advis'er or counsellor said that the
tridifttibaP hdd disdissed se* discrimination in the area
CoiTside'rihg.' Advisers are most influential as
fol£ rhollels. WhCri students were risked to "check the
statements' which; you feel accurately describe the nature
of 1 the contacts With your'freshman, adviser which affec
ted! ybur occupational consideration,"' the most fre
quently checked response was "Adviser acted as a posi
tive example of Individual in field." "Adviser acted as 1 a
negative example of individual in field" was also checked
frequently, and woijien students found advisers
equally important as role models. It is important to
note, however, that the large majority of these advisers
are men.
Suggestions for Improvements
Students were asked to respond to two open ended
questions about Stanford services: "What services that
Stanford now offers, if any, have been helpful to you in
planning your future:" and "What services which are not
now offered would you find helpful:" 60% of the 136
men answering the questionnaire and 54% of the 144
women mentioned some service at Stanford which had
been helpful to them. (These percentages refer to pro
portion of respondents. They have not been weighted to
represent the whole class.) Those services mentioned
most frequently were the Academic Information Center,
(41 times), the Career Counselling and Placement Cen
ter, (39 times), and the pre-med advising services, (18
times). 51 men and 61 women suggested improvements
in Stanford services. The most frequent target of sugges
tions were the departments, especially among women.
32 women and 15 men said that departments should be
more helpful in planning their futures. Helping students
plan their futures would be a new role for departments.
Only 11 students said their departments had actually
been helpful while they were at Stanford, and most of

the praise resulted from opportunities for practical ex
perience in their fields, not from advice or information
they had received.
Generally, students said they would have liked more
informal, personal contacts with professors, counsellors,
and people in the fields they are considering to give
them a better sense of what they wanted to do in the
future. One student suggested:

a broad, coordinated counselling service, with
competent people who can talk meaningfully
about a variety of occupations and lifestyles those
occupations shape. (Not just an engineering coun
sellor for engineering, an econ adviser for econ,
etc.)
i>i 112 c / . ' ! ; i ) I
Departments were suggested as an alternative source of
information about the employment possibilities stem
ming from a field of study.
A larger proportion of women than men students
have immediate need of career counselling and place
ment services. More of the women are planning to get a
full-time job as soon as they leave Stanford. 29% of the
women and 18% of the men said they expected to be
working full-time in the six months after graduation.
Women also seem to need more help in finding jobs. 26%
of the women who were planning to work full-time after
graduation have already looked for jobs in the area in
which they wanted to work, and only 7% had found
jobs. 18% of the men had looked for employment, and
11% had found jobs. Therefore, it is particularly im
portant for women students that occupational counsel
ling services be improved.
Policy Implications
1. The Career Planning and Placement Center should
make a special effort to help women plan their careers
and find jobs. Since a large number of women are trying
to find jobs in areas where few women have been hired
before, the Placement Center should make aggressive
efforts to place these women.
We recommend that the Career Planning and Place
ment Center report on what activities and what addi
tional staff are required in order to provide better service
to women undergraduates.
2. Women should be prepared to cope with discrimina
tion when they encounter it. We recommend that legal
and practical counselling about dealing with discrimina
tion be made available at the Placement Center.
3. Major department should be involved in occupation
counselling efforts. The experience and contacts of Stan
ford professors remain a largely untapped resource. As
some students suggested, departments should institute
programs in conjunction with the Career Planning and
Placement Center which offer an overview of the occu
pations open to men and women with training in differ
ent academic fields. Women should be well represented
in all such programs.
Wc recommend that each department provide a pro
gram of occupational counselling for its men and women
majors, either on its own or in conjunction with the
Career Planning and Placement Center.
4. Our data shows that advisers and counsellors current
ly discuss the problem of discrimination with their
women students. As several students suggested, this kind
of discussion can often be more discouraging than help
ful. Stanford advisers and counsellors need to be sensi
tive to the fine line between a fatalistic discussion of
discrimination and one that prepares women to meet the
difficulties they will encounter with determination in
stead of with surprise.
We recommend that the Dean of Students Office
develop written material and discussion sessions for ad
visers and counsellors that will orient them to the special
needs of women students.
5. Role modeling is an important function of Stanford
advisers. Yet most Stanford professors are men. There
fore. students have few opportunities to meet successful
professional women and to observe alternative ap
proaches to being a working woman or a working
mother. We recommend that the Dean of Students en
courage the participation of professional women in Uni
versity public functions and in activities at University
residences, until there are more women on the faculty.
Space paid for by News and Publications
Following are the highlights of a report on the Stan
ford woman student in 1972 as compiled by the Com
mittee on the Education and Employment of Women in
the University.
For full copies of the report, please call Nancy
Donham, ext. 4631.
THE STANFORD WOMAN IN 1972
A survey of the senior class of 1972 shows that the
Stanford undergraduate woman has changed remarkably
over the past five years.' She no longer accepts the
traditional roles which society has assigned to her as a
member of the female sex. Graduating men and women
seniors have very similar educational and occupational
aspirations. There is little difference between the propor
tions of women and men who plan to become profes
sionals: doctors, lawyers, college professors, and scien
tists. And the same proportions of men and women plan
to go on for graduate study.
Sex discrimination occurs at Stanford but its inci
dence is limited. Almost one-fourth the graduating seni
or women say they were discouraged from some goal by
sex discrimination while they were at Stanford. And
changes between major fields can to some extent be
predicted by the sex of the student and the traditional
sexual composition of the majors.
This report presents the results of a survey of Stan
ford seniors and makes recommendations on how the
University can end discrimination and provide more op
portunities for women. The first section of the report
considers the educational and occupational plans of men
and women undergraduates in 1972 and in 1965. The
second section concerns sex-role expectations and the
Stanford environment. It discusses women's experiences
of discrimination at Stanford, and the pattern of choos
ing majors which perpetuates the existence of predomi
nantly male fields. The third section discusses the effects
of academic and occupation counselling at Stanford. The
Committee's recommendations are summarized at the
end of the report.
The data presented in this report is the result of a
survey of 280 graduating seniors conducted in the Spring
of 1972. The questionnaire, "A Survey of Major and
Occupational Choice," was designed to find out what
fields Stanford undergraduates choose for their studies
and future jobs, and how the University environment
influences their choices. Recipients of the questionnaire
were randomly chosen in groups by sex and the aca
demic field in which they were interested when they
entered Stanford. Data presented here has been weighted
to be representative of the whole graduating class, unless
otherwise indicated. 136 men and 144 women respon
ded to the mailed questionnaire, giving a response rate of
79%. The questionnaire and a discussion of research
procedures are presented in the Appendix.
I. THE NEW STANFORD WOMAN
Occupational Plans of the Class of 1972
Perhaps the most significant finding of the survey of
major and occupational choice is the similarity of the
plans of men and women students. In the past it was
assumed that most Stanford men would become profes
sionals or businessmen while Stanford women would
become housewives, school teachers, and secretaries.
This stereotype used to approximate reality. It is no
longer valid.
In the Stanford class of 1972, a similar proportion of
men and women plan to enter major professions. 69% of
the men and 53% of the women who have a single
definite long-range plan say they will become doctors,
lawyers, college professors and scientists. When this is
generalized to the entire class, (including those who have
vague plans or more than one plan), 28% of senior
women and 30% of senior men are definitely planning to
enter a major profession.
The following table shows the responses of those who
said they had definite long-range occupational plans.
Data representing the plans of the whole population,
including those who are uncertain, shows a very similar
pattern.

It is apparent that the occupational choices of Stan
ford women do not fit into sexual stereotypes. Informa
tion on all the occupations which students considered at
Stanford shows that the women respondents began with
more traditional ideas as freshmen and moved away
from traditional considerations during their time at the
University.
Women and men not only have very similar occupa
tional plans, they also seem to have the same level of
commitment to their occupations and the same expecta
tions of success. As a measure of the seriousness of
occupational intent, students were asked how they had
prepared for their planned future occupations. The same
proportion of women and men said that they had pre
pared themselves by such activities as talking to individ
uals in the occupation, acquiring needed credentials or
training, and finding employment.
Expectations of success were measured by asking
students what ideally would be their occupation or main
activity in five years and what, realistically, they thought

they would be doing. Most students said they would
probably be engaged in their ideal occupations, (71% of
the men and 58% of the women). While fewer women
than men believe they will be engaged in their ideal
occupations, no more women than men think they will
be engaged in lower status occupations. Of those who do
not believe they will be engaged in their ideal occupa
tions, 26% of the men and 28% of the women said they
would probably be engaged in an occupation that vns
lower status than their ideal occupation.
The three most frequently mentioned ideal occupa
tions were medicine, law, and college educator-scientist.

As Table 2 shows, virtually all of the men and women
that aspire to these professions expect to reach their
goals, with the single exception of women who would
like to be college professors or scientists. 12% of the
women hold this ideal but only 7% believe they can
realistically attain it. This is by far the biggest gap
between ideal and realistic assessments for any sex or
occupation. It is interesting that women students have
the least confidence about the occupation to which they
have had the most exposure at Stanford: college profes
sor.
Educational Plans of the Class of 1972
The educational plans of graduating men and women
students are also quite similar. Just as many men as
women plan to go on for further education at some
point in the future, as Table 3 shows.

7c Having definite educational plans 84.5 81.3
% Having uncertain educational plans 4.4 8.5

N=l33 N=l44

Approximately the same proportion of men and
women are also going on for graduate study in the next
six months, (54 percent of the men and 49 percent of
the women).
Doctoral and professional programs have traditionally
been filled with men, while women have tended to enter
masters programs. This trend is still apparent with this
year's Stanford graduates, but the gap is closing. 52% of
the women and 74% of the men who said they were
going on for further education are planning to get a
doctorate, or a degree in law or medicine. 41% of the
women and 23% of the men are getting Masters degrees.
The remaining students will be getting technical licenses,
professional B.A.s or certificates of some kind.
A Comparison of Senior Women in 1965 and 1972
The plans of graduating Stanford women have
changed dramatically in the past few years. Data gather
ed on the Class of 1965 by the Institute for the Study of
Human Problems shows striking differences from the
Class of 1972. In "Career and Autonomy in College
Women," Joseph Katz draws the following conclusion:
.. .even in as academically able a group of students
as the Stanford women, the orientation toward
occupational roles is a very "traditional" one, even
though, as we will later see, there is a high valua
tion of the occupational life. .. .the women are
oriented towards family and their biggest occupa
tional aspiration is elementary and secondary
school teaching.
Similar findings have been reported by many other stud
ies of the occupational plans of women students in the
1950s and the early 1960s.
The following table compares the occupational plans
of women graduating in 1965 and 1972, and shows how
much Stanford undergraduates have changed in the past
7 years. The data for the two time periods are not
completely comparable, since different research pro
cedures were used in the two studies. However, the
comparisons between men and women within each time
period are valid.
The table shows a dramatic rise in the proportion of
women interested in the professions, and a sharp de
crease in the proportion who intend to be teachers.
These changes are clear, even though the 1972 data
represents women's most pessimistic estimates of their
future occupations, i.e., their realistic assessments of
what they would be doing in five years, as opposed to
their occupational plans.

In 1965, the ratio of men to women planning to
♦enter professions was 6to 1; in 1972 the ratio is 1.6 to
1. The proportion of women planning to enter elemen
tary and secondary education has decreased from 36% to
10% and the same proportion of men and women now
plan to enter business.
Stanford women have changed their conceptions of
their marital and childbearing roles, as well as their
occupational and education plans. Katz's respondents
were acutely aware of their future roles as wives and
mothers, and most assumed that their occupational goals
would be secondary to their duties to their husbands and
children. 70% of these women said they would not work
at all when their children were under 6 years old, and
only 43% intended to work full time when their children
were over 12 years of age.
Stanford women no longer think along these lines.
The 1972 respondents were not asked directly about
their plans for marriage and childrearing, but the women
were given ample opportunity to mention the future role
of wife and mother. Few women ever mentioned the
topic.
In one series of questions, we asked women what
they were planning to do after graduation, and how long
they planned to continue in that activity. Traditional
patterns led us to expect that a significant proportion of
the women would say they planned to work either until
they had put their husbands through school, or until it
was time to raise children. Only 3% of the women
who were leaving college to work said they would stop
when their husbands had finished school, and only 7%
said they would stop to raise children. Traditional role
expectations still exist at Stanford, but they are the
exception rather than the rule.
This conclusion is also supported by their responses
about "ideal" and "real" future activities. Only 3% of
the women said that, ideally, they would be housewives
in five years and an additional .4% thought that real
istically they would be housewives at that time. In five
years, most of these women will be 26 or 27 years old,
an age at which, in the past, a majority of women
already have small children. However, only 15% of the
women said that they realistically expected childraising
and housework to be a major activity, in addition to
some kind of employment. In all, only 18.5% of the
women mentioned the role of wife and mother as part of
their main activities in the next 5 years.
In sum, the data show that Stanford women have
broken away from traditional stereotypes about "the
woman's role" in the last seven years. Women and men
now have very similar occupational and educational
plans. Women no longer seem to regard a job as "some
thing to fall back on." They take their plans seriously,
and they expect to succeed.
Policy Implications
1. It is important that all members of the Stanford
community — administrators, professors, advisers, and
counsellors — understand the new aspirations of women
undergraduates. The best cure for sex-role stereotypes is
information. For this reason, the findings of this study
should be publicized as widely as possible. We recom
mend that the Dean of Undergraduate Studies and the
Provost take steps to ensure that the findings of this
study are communicated to all professors, advisers,
counsellors and administrators, especially those who
have extensive contact with undergraduates.
2. Stanford University as an institution employing over
7,000 men and women is responsible for setting an
example by eliminating all discriminatory hiring and
promotional practices. The administration should con
tinue to give high priority to its affirmative action ef
forts, and to publicize them as widely as possible.
11. SEX ROLE EXPECTATIONS AND THE STAN
FORD ENVIRONMENT
Knowing that Stanford men and women share sub
stantially the same aspirations, it is important to ask
whether Stanford's treatment of its students is consis
tent with these aspirations. Are Stanford women dis
couraged from entering traditionally male fields and
seeking careers in predominantly male areas? Are they
encouraged to be housewives and school teachers, when
many would prefer to be doctors and professors?
By and large, the answer to these questions appears to
be no. Most women do not believe that they encounter
ed discrimination while they were at Stanford, but a
significant number of Stanford women have been in
fluenced to limit their educational and occupational
choices because of their sex. Most departments and
professors do not discriminate against women; but some
do.
Experience with Discrimination
When asked, "do you feel you have been discouraged
from any academic or occupational goals by a member
of the Stanford community because of your sex?" 29 of
the 128 women who responded said yes. This generalizes
to 23% of all Stanford women. Another 5% of the
women experienced discrimination but were not dis
couraged by it. Most of these women were discouraged
by contacts with faculty members.

In all, almost one-quarter of Stanford women are
discouraged by discrimination. The forms which this
discrimination takes range from explicit discouragement
from a professor to more subtle environmental cues. The
observations of some of the women respondents illus
trate this quite clearly. The following quotations drawn
from survey responses illustrate overt discouragement of
women by their advisers:
Dr. X, a pre-med adviser, had a dim view of the
possibility of women actually making it through
all the work necessary to be a doctor, and later of
her juggling work, children, etc. .. .There were 2
other girls in our advisee group. He said he didn 't
expect to see us the next year.. . .
Not only my major adviser, but several of my
professors in my department failed to offer any
encouragement or assistance and in some cases
actively discouraged me from further study in
mathematics - both when I sought advice and
approval for advanced study and when I sought
assistance and consultation in courses I was taking.
A largely negative reaction (at best, I was ignored)
from male peers in math and science classes was
also quite evident.
My history adviser specifically discouraged me
from going on to grad school. He kept suggesting
high school teaching as "more flexible for a
woman." And he did this even after I took several
courses from him in which I did very well. He even
urged me to take on the honors thesis program.
Other women described comments made by professors
during lectures as a source of discouragement:
I took a class in (chemistry) from Dr. X - a
required course for many med schools. He began
his first lecture by saying there were 2 things he
couldn 't stand — premeds and women who
thought they could be scientists. His actions were
consistent with his prejudices.
One art teacher, XX, believes that women make
better art teachers than artists - his suggestions to
this effect have been to classes as a whole, not to
me individually, but I think that his underlying
sexism affects his relationship with me although he
shows a respect for my work.
Some women found assessments of the employment
situation for women in some fields more discouraging
than helpful:
I have been told of personal experience of the bias
against women in university level teaching. I would
not seek employment as a member of an academic
community (university).
. . .advisers have given me "realistic appraisals
which were very discouraging.
Finally, some women did not describe a direct communi
cation at all, but a sense they had from what was around
them:
It's difficult to be specific - one carries with him
the prejudices; I wish now I had gone pre-med; I
would like to be a doctor but women weren't
doctors; and women didn't go on to be English
professors - I didn 7 look much beyond teaching
- and no one suggested anything else.
Though discouragement has not been overt (ex
cept in a couple of cases where people couldn't
understand why I couldn't be happy teaching in
high school) there is a lot of subtle discourage
ment. 1) The lack of female professors which
really presents a problem in terms of role identity,
2) the number of professors that give only a nega
tive account of their role (Idon't understand why
they're still in it), 3) a disbelief, from both profes
sors and students, that I can combine being a
woman with being a professor, 4) the way I see
female professors now being treated (i.e. difficulty
in obtaining tenure, refusal to see their courses as
anything but "fun" (both professors and stu
dents), insinuations about their teaching ability
and/or intelligence related to sex, etc.).
Policy Implications
Overt discouragement of women wishing to enter
"male" fields and professions should not exist at Stan
ford in 1972. To counter such sexism when it results
from ignorance, an effort should be made to increase
awareness of the fact that women are capable of doing
"male jobs" and succeeding in "male fields," and that
many women do successfully combine professional and
childrearing responsibilities. Any professor or counsellor
who continues to discourage women students because of
their sex should not be asked to advise them. We recom
mend that the Dean of Undergraduate Studies develop a
list of advisers that are particularly interested in working
with women undergraduates. Students should be in
formed that they have the option of choosing someone
from this list to replace their current adviser. In addi
tion, the Dean of Undergraduate Studies should consider
developing procedures by which students can register
complaints if they experience discrimination from their
adviser.
111. CHOICE OF MAJORS
Just as some occupations are usually seen as "men's
jobs" and others as "women's jobs," so some academic
fields are seen as primarily "male" or "female." The
traditional perceptions of appropriate fields for men and
women closely fit the actual proportions of each sex
majoring in these fields at Stanford today. The science
fields have few women, the humanities many more than
their share. Students' changes between majors were
assessed in order to find out if this distribution was due
to interests and orientations acquired before students
entered Stanford, or if the Stanford environment was in
some way encouraging sex-typed choices of major fields.
The results show that students do tend to move into
fields dominated by their own sex while they are at
Stanford. Women more than men switch out of fields
such as Political Science and into fields like English and
Music. More men than women move into fields which
already have a large number of men and out of fields
with a larger proportion s of women. While students are
breaking traditiojn in their careqr N choices, they are per
petuating the, sex-typing of majoi; fields.
. ' \ v v • \ \ \ r •. * > *
of switching between majors, fields
were categorized as cither maje-dominated or non-male
dominated. All fields having less than 25% wom'en'were
, male-dominated, rest,, non-male-dominated.
(j3)S% of, Stanford undergraduates are women.) Male
dominated fields were further divided into science and
non-science fields. Students were asked about the field
ip vyhich' they expressed'an interest time they
were accepted to Stanfo'rd, (referred to as'their
man field of interest"), their first major, and the'major
with which they graduated.
Tn Ihe male-domma'ted sbifcnce fields, Stanford stu
dents appear to bring th v eir sex role stereotypes with
them.'Many mo're freshmen men. than women are inter
ested in these fields; but there is no change towards
greater sexvtyped choice between the freshman and
senior year. "Science fields, retain and attract an equal
proportion of men and women majors.
The fields where Stanford students increasingly make
their choices in terms of sex role stereotypes are the
male dominated, nonscience fields: economics, history,
political science, philosophy, architecture and urban de
sign. Of those students who were interested in these
fields as freshmen, more men than women remained in
these fields until they graduated (60% vs. 53%). More
over, in recruiting new majors, these fields attract many
more men than women. Nonscience male-dominated
fields attract 45% of the men who come to Stanford
interested in non-male-dominated fields, and only 10%
of the women.
Students who come to Stanford without a clear field
of interest seem to be most influenced by pressures to
select a field that is "appropriate" for their sex. The
students who said they were considering both a male
dominated and a non-male-dominated field when they
were accepted to Stanford showed almost no sex-typed
switching. (3% of all freshmen men and 7% of all fresh
men women were in this category.) On the other hand,
the final majors of those who were undecided as entering
freshmen and were not interested in any particular field,
can be almost entirely predicted by sex-typing. 79% of
these men graduated in male-dominated fields, 21% in
non-male-dominated fields. 27% of the undecided
women graduated in male-dominated fields, and 70% in
non-male-dominated fields. (20% of freshmen women
and 26% of freshmen men were undecided.)
The fact that students who come to Stanford with no
idea of what they want to do show the most sex-typed
behavior would seem to indicate that the University
environment influences students to make this kind of
choice. However, when students were asked why they
made the choices they did, such pressures from the
University were not evident. Women were not advised to
shift out of male-dominated fields any more often than
they were encouraged to shift into them. They did not
respond that experienced or anticipated discrimination
was a reason for such shifts, nor did they feel less
capable of succeeding in male-dominated fields. The
reasons which women give for changing majors do not
explain the pattern of sex-typed switching.
Most of the women's sex-typed switching occurred
between the time of their acceptance to Stanford and
•the time they declared their first major (by the end of
their sophomore years). This tendency for sex-typed
major choice to be more frequent in the freshman and
sophomore years has two possible explanations. Stu
dents may act more traditionally when they are younger
or sex-role stereotypes may have been more dominant at
Stanford three and four years ago.
i
Plans for graduate study also show some of the sex
typing. While more students plan graduate study in male

dominated than in non-male-dominated fields, in gen
eral, twice as many men as women do so. 45% of t,he
women and 86% of-the men with definite educational
i plaas, are going on in male-dominpted fields. , , \

Policy Implications ■ > < '. i i i - ! . . •< •„>
The overwhelming predominance' of men iri certain
social science and humanities fields is perpetuated as
women tend to avoid and leave these fields while thtfy
are at Stanford. These departments -*■ economics, his
tory, philosophy, political science, architecture and
urban design — should investigate this situation, looking,
in particular, at their introductory classes. The sciences,
which attract few women students, seem to be dealing
with a phenomenon inherited from the high schools. All
departments with few women majors should make an
effort to attract them. One obvious step in this direction
is to increase the number of women teaching in these
fields.
We recommend that departments with fewer than
25% women majors should experiment with ways of
attracting more women majors (such as distributing writ
ten materials through the Academic Information Center
or encouraging current women majors to discuss the
department's program with other women). These depart
ments should also determine the proportion of women
undergraduates that join and leave their undergraduate
program. Departments may wish to confer with the
Committee on the Employment and Education of
Women about methods for recruiting women, and they
should report their progress to the Committee by the
end of Spring Quarter, 1973.
IV. ACADEMIC AND OCCUPATIONAL COUNSEL
LING
The survey shows that many students find Stanford

services helpful at some point in their undergraduate
careers, but very few feel that Stanford's advisers or
counsellors have affected their occupational plans. Stu
dents were asked specifically about their contacts with
their freshman advisers, academic advisers, and career
counsellors in the placement center. Only a small pro
portion felt that these people had had any effect on
their occupational plans.

Advising and Sex-Roles
One question asked of the data was whether or not
men and womcjri were advised to chodsb fields "appro
priate to their'sex. In only one'case did this trend seem
apparept. There is some indication that the advice of
freshmen advisers reflected sex-role stereotypes. 4 of the
5 students who said they were discouraged by their
freshmen advisers were women and all of the women
were discouraged in male fields. This bias did not appear
ill responses about academic advisers and career counsel
lors. Studtnis tvere' also -asked about' the nature of the
boMattis'with their advisers which affected therin occupa
tional considerations. It is significant that one-quarter of
HHe wtlrti&n 1 whose occupational plans had b&eivaffected
■by l e!dritkets with ah advis'er or counsellor said that the
tridifttibaP hdd disdissed se* discrimination in the area
CoiTside'rihg.' Advisers are most influential as
fol£ rhollels. WhCri students were risked to "check the
statements' which; you feel accurately describe the nature
of 1 the contacts With your'freshman, adviser which affec
ted! ybur occupational consideration,"' the most fre
quently checked response was "Adviser acted as a posi
tive example of Individual in field." "Adviser acted as 1 a
negative example of individual in field" was also checked
frequently, and woijien students found advisers
equally important as role models. It is important to
note, however, that the large majority of these advisers
are men.
Suggestions for Improvements
Students were asked to respond to two open ended
questions about Stanford services: "What services that
Stanford now offers, if any, have been helpful to you in
planning your future:" and "What services which are not
now offered would you find helpful:" 60% of the 136
men answering the questionnaire and 54% of the 144
women mentioned some service at Stanford which had
been helpful to them. (These percentages refer to pro
portion of respondents. They have not been weighted to
represent the whole class.) Those services mentioned
most frequently were the Academic Information Center,
(41 times), the Career Counselling and Placement Cen
ter, (39 times), and the pre-med advising services, (18
times). 51 men and 61 women suggested improvements
in Stanford services. The most frequent target of sugges
tions were the departments, especially among women.
32 women and 15 men said that departments should be
more helpful in planning their futures. Helping students
plan their futures would be a new role for departments.
Only 11 students said their departments had actually
been helpful while they were at Stanford, and most of

the praise resulted from opportunities for practical ex
perience in their fields, not from advice or information
they had received.
Generally, students said they would have liked more
informal, personal contacts with professors, counsellors,
and people in the fields they are considering to give
them a better sense of what they wanted to do in the
future. One student suggested:

a broad, coordinated counselling service, with
competent people who can talk meaningfully
about a variety of occupations and lifestyles those
occupations shape. (Not just an engineering coun
sellor for engineering, an econ adviser for econ,
etc.)
i>i 112 c / . ' ! ; i ) I
Departments were suggested as an alternative source of
information about the employment possibilities stem
ming from a field of study.
A larger proportion of women than men students
have immediate need of career counselling and place
ment services. More of the women are planning to get a
full-time job as soon as they leave Stanford. 29% of the
women and 18% of the men said they expected to be
working full-time in the six months after graduation.
Women also seem to need more help in finding jobs. 26%
of the women who were planning to work full-time after
graduation have already looked for jobs in the area in
which they wanted to work, and only 7% had found
jobs. 18% of the men had looked for employment, and
11% had found jobs. Therefore, it is particularly im
portant for women students that occupational counsel
ling services be improved.
Policy Implications
1. The Career Planning and Placement Center should
make a special effort to help women plan their careers
and find jobs. Since a large number of women are trying
to find jobs in areas where few women have been hired
before, the Placement Center should make aggressive
efforts to place these women.
We recommend that the Career Planning and Place
ment Center report on what activities and what addi
tional staff are required in order to provide better service
to women undergraduates.
2. Women should be prepared to cope with discrimina
tion when they encounter it. We recommend that legal
and practical counselling about dealing with discrimina
tion be made available at the Placement Center.
3. Major department should be involved in occupation
counselling efforts. The experience and contacts of Stan
ford professors remain a largely untapped resource. As
some students suggested, departments should institute
programs in conjunction with the Career Planning and
Placement Center which offer an overview of the occu
pations open to men and women with training in differ
ent academic fields. Women should be well represented
in all such programs.
Wc recommend that each department provide a pro
gram of occupational counselling for its men and women
majors, either on its own or in conjunction with the
Career Planning and Placement Center.
4. Our data shows that advisers and counsellors current
ly discuss the problem of discrimination with their
women students. As several students suggested, this kind
of discussion can often be more discouraging than help
ful. Stanford advisers and counsellors need to be sensi
tive to the fine line between a fatalistic discussion of
discrimination and one that prepares women to meet the
difficulties they will encounter with determination in
stead of with surprise.
We recommend that the Dean of Students Office
develop written material and discussion sessions for ad
visers and counsellors that will orient them to the special
needs of women students.
5. Role modeling is an important function of Stanford
advisers. Yet most Stanford professors are men. There
fore. students have few opportunities to meet successful
professional women and to observe alternative ap
proaches to being a working woman or a working
mother. We recommend that the Dean of Students en
courage the participation of professional women in Uni
versity public functions and in activities at University
residences, until there are more women on the faculty.
Space paid for by News and Publications
Following are the highlights of a report on the Stan
ford woman student in 1972 as compiled by the Com
mittee on the Education and Employment of Women in
the University.
For full copies of the report, please call Nancy
Donham, ext. 4631.
THE STANFORD WOMAN IN 1972
A survey of the senior class of 1972 shows that the
Stanford undergraduate woman has changed remarkably
over the past five years.' She no longer accepts the
traditional roles which society has assigned to her as a
member of the female sex. Graduating men and women
seniors have very similar educational and occupational
aspirations. There is little difference between the propor
tions of women and men who plan to become profes
sionals: doctors, lawyers, college professors, and scien
tists. And the same proportions of men and women plan
to go on for graduate study.
Sex discrimination occurs at Stanford but its inci
dence is limited. Almost one-fourth the graduating seni
or women say they were discouraged from some goal by
sex discrimination while they were at Stanford. And
changes between major fields can to some extent be
predicted by the sex of the student and the traditional
sexual composition of the majors.
This report presents the results of a survey of Stan
ford seniors and makes recommendations on how the
University can end discrimination and provide more op
portunities for women. The first section of the report
considers the educational and occupational plans of men
and women undergraduates in 1972 and in 1965. The
second section concerns sex-role expectations and the
Stanford environment. It discusses women's experiences
of discrimination at Stanford, and the pattern of choos
ing majors which perpetuates the existence of predomi
nantly male fields. The third section discusses the effects
of academic and occupation counselling at Stanford. The
Committee's recommendations are summarized at the
end of the report.
The data presented in this report is the result of a
survey of 280 graduating seniors conducted in the Spring
of 1972. The questionnaire, "A Survey of Major and
Occupational Choice," was designed to find out what
fields Stanford undergraduates choose for their studies
and future jobs, and how the University environment
influences their choices. Recipients of the questionnaire
were randomly chosen in groups by sex and the aca
demic field in which they were interested when they
entered Stanford. Data presented here has been weighted
to be representative of the whole graduating class, unless
otherwise indicated. 136 men and 144 women respon
ded to the mailed questionnaire, giving a response rate of
79%. The questionnaire and a discussion of research
procedures are presented in the Appendix.
I. THE NEW STANFORD WOMAN
Occupational Plans of the Class of 1972
Perhaps the most significant finding of the survey of
major and occupational choice is the similarity of the
plans of men and women students. In the past it was
assumed that most Stanford men would become profes
sionals or businessmen while Stanford women would
become housewives, school teachers, and secretaries.
This stereotype used to approximate reality. It is no
longer valid.
In the Stanford class of 1972, a similar proportion of
men and women plan to enter major professions. 69% of
the men and 53% of the women who have a single
definite long-range plan say they will become doctors,
lawyers, college professors and scientists. When this is
generalized to the entire class, (including those who have
vague plans or more than one plan), 28% of senior
women and 30% of senior men are definitely planning to
enter a major profession.
The following table shows the responses of those who
said they had definite long-range occupational plans.
Data representing the plans of the whole population,
including those who are uncertain, shows a very similar
pattern.

It is apparent that the occupational choices of Stan
ford women do not fit into sexual stereotypes. Informa
tion on all the occupations which students considered at
Stanford shows that the women respondents began with
more traditional ideas as freshmen and moved away
from traditional considerations during their time at the
University.
Women and men not only have very similar occupa
tional plans, they also seem to have the same level of
commitment to their occupations and the same expecta
tions of success. As a measure of the seriousness of
occupational intent, students were asked how they had
prepared for their planned future occupations. The same
proportion of women and men said that they had pre
pared themselves by such activities as talking to individ
uals in the occupation, acquiring needed credentials or
training, and finding employment.
Expectations of success were measured by asking
students what ideally would be their occupation or main
activity in five years and what, realistically, they thought

they would be doing. Most students said they would
probably be engaged in their ideal occupations, (71% of
the men and 58% of the women). While fewer women
than men believe they will be engaged in their ideal
occupations, no more women than men think they will
be engaged in lower status occupations. Of those who do
not believe they will be engaged in their ideal occupa
tions, 26% of the men and 28% of the women said they
would probably be engaged in an occupation that vns
lower status than their ideal occupation.
The three most frequently mentioned ideal occupa
tions were medicine, law, and college educator-scientist.

N=loB N=l2s

As Table 2 shows, virtually all of the men and women
that aspire to these professions expect to reach their
goals, with the single exception of women who would
like to be college professors or scientists. 12% of the
women hold this ideal but only 7% believe they can
realistically attain it. This is by far the biggest gap
between ideal and realistic assessments for any sex or
occupation. It is interesting that women students have
the least confidence about the occupation to which they
have had the most exposure at Stanford: college profes
sor.
Educational Plans of the Class of 1972
The educational plans of graduating men and women
students are also quite similar. Just as many men as
women plan to go on for further education at some
point in the future, as Table 3 shows.

TABLE 3

7c Having definite educational plans 84.5 81.3
% Having uncertain educational plans 4.4 8.5

N=l33 N=l44

Approximately the same proportion of men and
women are also going on for graduate study in the next
six months, (54 percent of the men and 49 percent of
the women).
Doctoral and professional programs have traditionally
been filled with men, while women have tended to enter
masters programs. This trend is still apparent with this
year's Stanford graduates, but the gap is closing. 52% of
the women and 74% of the men who said they were
going on for further education are planning to get a
doctorate, or a degree in law or medicine. 41% of the
women and 23% of the men are getting Masters degrees.
The remaining students will be getting technical licenses,
professional B.A.s or certificates of some kind.
A Comparison of Senior Women in 1965 and 1972
The plans of graduating Stanford women have
changed dramatically in the past few years. Data gather
ed on the Class of 1965 by the Institute for the Study of
Human Problems shows striking differences from the
Class of 1972. In "Career and Autonomy in College
Women," Joseph Katz draws the following conclusion:
.. .even in as academically able a group of students
as the Stanford women, the orientation toward
occupational roles is a very "traditional" one, even
though, as we will later see, there is a high valua
tion of the occupational life. .. .the women are
oriented towards family and their biggest occupa
tional aspiration is elementary and secondary
school teaching.
Similar findings have been reported by many other stud
ies of the occupational plans of women students in the
1950s and the early 1960s.
The following table compares the occupational plans
of women graduating in 1965 and 1972, and shows how
much Stanford undergraduates have changed in the past
7 years. The data for the two time periods are not
completely comparable, since different research pro
cedures were used in the two studies. However, the
comparisons between men and women within each time
period are valid.
The table shows a dramatic rise in the proportion of
women interested in the professions, and a sharp de
crease in the proportion who intend to be teachers.
These changes are clear, even though the 1972 data
represents women's most pessimistic estimates of their
future occupations, i.e., their realistic assessments of
what they would be doing in five years, as opposed to
their occupational plans.

In 1965, the ratio of men to women planning to
♦enter professions was 6to 1; in 1972 the ratio is 1.6 to
1. The proportion of women planning to enter elemen
tary and secondary education has decreased from 36% to
10% and the same proportion of men and women now
plan to enter business.
Stanford women have changed their conceptions of
their marital and childbearing roles, as well as their
occupational and education plans. Katz's respondents
were acutely aware of their future roles as wives and
mothers, and most assumed that their occupational goals
would be secondary to their duties to their husbands and
children. 70% of these women said they would not work
at all when their children were under 6 years old, and
only 43% intended to work full time when their children
were over 12 years of age.
Stanford women no longer think along these lines.
The 1972 respondents were not asked directly about
their plans for marriage and childrearing, but the women
were given ample opportunity to mention the future role
of wife and mother. Few women ever mentioned the
topic.
In one series of questions, we asked women what
they were planning to do after graduation, and how long
they planned to continue in that activity. Traditional
patterns led us to expect that a significant proportion of
the women would say they planned to work either until
they had put their husbands through school, or until it
was time to raise children. Only 3% of the women
who were leaving college to work said they would stop
when their husbands had finished school, and only 7%
said they would stop to raise children. Traditional role
expectations still exist at Stanford, but they are the
exception rather than the rule.
This conclusion is also supported by their responses
about "ideal" and "real" future activities. Only 3% of
the women said that, ideally, they would be housewives
in five years and an additional .4% thought that real
istically they would be housewives at that time. In five
years, most of these women will be 26 or 27 years old,
an age at which, in the past, a majority of women
already have small children. However, only 15% of the
women said that they realistically expected childraising
and housework to be a major activity, in addition to
some kind of employment. In all, only 18.5% of the
women mentioned the role of wife and mother as part of
their main activities in the next 5 years.
In sum, the data show that Stanford women have
broken away from traditional stereotypes about "the
woman's role" in the last seven years. Women and men
now have very similar occupational and educational
plans. Women no longer seem to regard a job as "some
thing to fall back on." They take their plans seriously,
and they expect to succeed.
Policy Implications
1. It is important that all members of the Stanford
community — administrators, professors, advisers, and
counsellors — understand the new aspirations of women
undergraduates. The best cure for sex-role stereotypes is
information. For this reason, the findings of this study
should be publicized as widely as possible. We recom
mend that the Dean of Undergraduate Studies and the
Provost take steps to ensure that the findings of this
study are communicated to all professors, advisers,
counsellors and administrators, especially those who
have extensive contact with undergraduates.
2. Stanford University as an institution employing over
7,000 men and women is responsible for setting an
example by eliminating all discriminatory hiring and
promotional practices. The administration should con
tinue to give high priority to its affirmative action ef
forts, and to publicize them as widely as possible.
11. SEX ROLE EXPECTATIONS AND THE STAN
FORD ENVIRONMENT
Knowing that Stanford men and women share sub
stantially the same aspirations, it is important to ask
whether Stanford's treatment of its students is consis
tent with these aspirations. Are Stanford women dis
couraged from entering traditionally male fields and
seeking careers in predominantly male areas? Are they
encouraged to be housewives and school teachers, when
many would prefer to be doctors and professors?
By and large, the answer to these questions appears to
be no. Most women do not believe that they encounter
ed discrimination while they were at Stanford, but a
significant number of Stanford women have been in
fluenced to limit their educational and occupational
choices because of their sex. Most departments and
professors do not discriminate against women; but some
do.
Experience with Discrimination
When asked, "do you feel you have been discouraged
from any academic or occupational goals by a member
of the Stanford community because of your sex?" 29 of
the 128 women who responded said yes. This generalizes
to 23% of all Stanford women. Another 5% of the
women experienced discrimination but were not dis
couraged by it. Most of these women were discouraged
by contacts with faculty members.

In all, almost one-quarter of Stanford women are
discouraged by discrimination. The forms which this
discrimination takes range from explicit discouragement
from a professor to more subtle environmental cues. The
observations of some of the women respondents illus
trate this quite clearly. The following quotations drawn
from survey responses illustrate overt discouragement of
women by their advisers:
Dr. X, a pre-med adviser, had a dim view of the
possibility of women actually making it through
all the work necessary to be a doctor, and later of
her juggling work, children, etc. .. .There were 2
other girls in our advisee group. He said he didn 't
expect to see us the next year.. . .
Not only my major adviser, but several of my
professors in my department failed to offer any
encouragement or assistance and in some cases
actively discouraged me from further study in
mathematics - both when I sought advice and
approval for advanced study and when I sought
assistance and consultation in courses I was taking.
A largely negative reaction (at best, I was ignored)
from male peers in math and science classes was
also quite evident.
My history adviser specifically discouraged me
from going on to grad school. He kept suggesting
high school teaching as "more flexible for a
woman." And he did this even after I took several
courses from him in which I did very well. He even
urged me to take on the honors thesis program.
Other women described comments made by professors
during lectures as a source of discouragement:
I took a class in (chemistry) from Dr. X - a
required course for many med schools. He began
his first lecture by saying there were 2 things he
couldn 't stand — premeds and women who
thought they could be scientists. His actions were
consistent with his prejudices.
One art teacher, XX, believes that women make
better art teachers than artists - his suggestions to
this effect have been to classes as a whole, not to
me individually, but I think that his underlying
sexism affects his relationship with me although he
shows a respect for my work.
Some women found assessments of the employment
situation for women in some fields more discouraging
than helpful:
I have been told of personal experience of the bias
against women in university level teaching. I would
not seek employment as a member of an academic
community (university).
. . .advisers have given me "realistic appraisals
which were very discouraging.
Finally, some women did not describe a direct communi
cation at all, but a sense they had from what was around
them:
It's difficult to be specific - one carries with him
the prejudices; I wish now I had gone pre-med; I
would like to be a doctor but women weren't
doctors; and women didn't go on to be English
professors - I didn 7 look much beyond teaching
- and no one suggested anything else.
Though discouragement has not been overt (ex
cept in a couple of cases where people couldn't
understand why I couldn't be happy teaching in
high school) there is a lot of subtle discourage
ment. 1) The lack of female professors which
really presents a problem in terms of role identity,
2) the number of professors that give only a nega
tive account of their role (Idon't understand why
they're still in it), 3) a disbelief, from both profes
sors and students, that I can combine being a
woman with being a professor, 4) the way I see
female professors now being treated (i.e. difficulty
in obtaining tenure, refusal to see their courses as
anything but "fun" (both professors and stu
dents), insinuations about their teaching ability
and/or intelligence related to sex, etc.).
Policy Implications
Overt discouragement of women wishing to enter
"male" fields and professions should not exist at Stan
ford in 1972. To counter such sexism when it results
from ignorance, an effort should be made to increase
awareness of the fact that women are capable of doing
"male jobs" and succeeding in "male fields," and that
many women do successfully combine professional and
childrearing responsibilities. Any professor or counsellor
who continues to discourage women students because of
their sex should not be asked to advise them. We recom
mend that the Dean of Undergraduate Studies develop a
list of advisers that are particularly interested in working
with women undergraduates. Students should be in
formed that they have the option of choosing someone
from this list to replace their current adviser. In addi
tion, the Dean of Undergraduate Studies should consider
developing procedures by which students can register
complaints if they experience discrimination from their
adviser.
111. CHOICE OF MAJORS
Just as some occupations are usually seen as "men's
jobs" and others as "women's jobs," so some academic
fields are seen as primarily "male" or "female." The
traditional perceptions of appropriate fields for men and
women closely fit the actual proportions of each sex
majoring in these fields at Stanford today. The science
fields have few women, the humanities many more than
their share. Students' changes between majors were
assessed in order to find out if this distribution was due
to interests and orientations acquired before students
entered Stanford, or if the Stanford environment was in
some way encouraging sex-typed choices of major fields.
The results show that students do tend to move into
fields dominated by their own sex while they are at
Stanford. Women more than men switch out of fields
such as Political Science and into fields like English and
Music. More men than women move into fields which
already have a large number of men and out of fields
with a larger proportion s of women. While students are
breaking traditiojn in their careqr N choices, they are per
petuating the, sex-typing of majoi; fields.
. ' \ v v • \ \ \ r •. * > *
of switching between majors, fields
were categorized as cither maje-dominated or non-male
dominated. All fields having less than 25% wom'en'were
, male-dominated, rest,, non-male-dominated.
(j3)S% of, Stanford undergraduates are women.) Male
dominated fields were further divided into science and
non-science fields. Students were asked about the field
ip vyhich' they expressed'an interest time they
were accepted to Stanfo'rd, (referred to as'their
man field of interest"), their first major, and the'major
with which they graduated.
Tn Ihe male-domma'ted sbifcnce fields, Stanford stu
dents appear to bring th v eir sex role stereotypes with
them.'Many mo're freshmen men. than women are inter
ested in these fields; but there is no change towards
greater sexvtyped choice between the freshman and
senior year. "Science fields, retain and attract an equal
proportion of men and women majors.
The fields where Stanford students increasingly make
their choices in terms of sex role stereotypes are the
male dominated, nonscience fields: economics, history,
political science, philosophy, architecture and urban de
sign. Of those students who were interested in these
fields as freshmen, more men than women remained in
these fields until they graduated (60% vs. 53%). More
over, in recruiting new majors, these fields attract many
more men than women. Nonscience male-dominated
fields attract 45% of the men who come to Stanford
interested in non-male-dominated fields, and only 10%
of the women.
Students who come to Stanford without a clear field
of interest seem to be most influenced by pressures to
select a field that is "appropriate" for their sex. The
students who said they were considering both a male
dominated and a non-male-dominated field when they
were accepted to Stanford showed almost no sex-typed
switching. (3% of all freshmen men and 7% of all fresh
men women were in this category.) On the other hand,
the final majors of those who were undecided as entering
freshmen and were not interested in any particular field,
can be almost entirely predicted by sex-typing. 79% of
these men graduated in male-dominated fields, 21% in
non-male-dominated fields. 27% of the undecided
women graduated in male-dominated fields, and 70% in
non-male-dominated fields. (20% of freshmen women
and 26% of freshmen men were undecided.)
The fact that students who come to Stanford with no
idea of what they want to do show the most sex-typed
behavior would seem to indicate that the University
environment influences students to make this kind of
choice. However, when students were asked why they
made the choices they did, such pressures from the
University were not evident. Women were not advised to
shift out of male-dominated fields any more often than
they were encouraged to shift into them. They did not
respond that experienced or anticipated discrimination
was a reason for such shifts, nor did they feel less
capable of succeeding in male-dominated fields. The
reasons which women give for changing majors do not
explain the pattern of sex-typed switching.
Most of the women's sex-typed switching occurred
between the time of their acceptance to Stanford and
•the time they declared their first major (by the end of
their sophomore years). This tendency for sex-typed
major choice to be more frequent in the freshman and
sophomore years has two possible explanations. Stu
dents may act more traditionally when they are younger
or sex-role stereotypes may have been more dominant at
Stanford three and four years ago.
i
Plans for graduate study also show some of the sex
typing. While more students plan graduate study in male

dominated than in non-male-dominated fields, in gen
eral, twice as many men as women do so. 45% of t,he
women and 86% of-the men with definite educational
i plaas, are going on in male-dominpted fields. , , \

Policy Implications ■ > < '. i i i - ! . . •< •„>
The overwhelming predominance' of men iri certain
social science and humanities fields is perpetuated as
women tend to avoid and leave these fields while thtfy
are at Stanford. These departments -*■ economics, his
tory, philosophy, political science, architecture and
urban design — should investigate this situation, looking,
in particular, at their introductory classes. The sciences,
which attract few women students, seem to be dealing
with a phenomenon inherited from the high schools. All
departments with few women majors should make an
effort to attract them. One obvious step in this direction
is to increase the number of women teaching in these
fields.
We recommend that departments with fewer than
25% women majors should experiment with ways of
attracting more women majors (such as distributing writ
ten materials through the Academic Information Center
or encouraging current women majors to discuss the
department's program with other women). These depart
ments should also determine the proportion of women
undergraduates that join and leave their undergraduate
program. Departments may wish to confer with the
Committee on the Employment and Education of
Women about methods for recruiting women, and they
should report their progress to the Committee by the
end of Spring Quarter, 1973.
IV. ACADEMIC AND OCCUPATIONAL COUNSEL
LING
The survey shows that many students find Stanford

services helpful at some point in their undergraduate
careers, but very few feel that Stanford's advisers or
counsellors have affected their occupational plans. Stu
dents were asked specifically about their contacts with
their freshman advisers, academic advisers, and career
counsellors in the placement center. Only a small pro
portion felt that these people had had any effect on
their occupational plans.

Advising and Sex-Roles
One question asked of the data was whether or not
men and womcjri were advised to chodsb fields "appro
priate to their'sex. In only one'case did this trend seem
apparept. There is some indication that the advice of
freshmen advisers reflected sex-role stereotypes. 4 of the
5 students who said they were discouraged by their
freshmen advisers were women and all of the women
were discouraged in male fields. This bias did not appear
ill responses about academic advisers and career counsel
lors. Studtnis tvere' also -asked about' the nature of the
boMattis'with their advisers which affected therin occupa
tional considerations. It is significant that one-quarter of
HHe wtlrti&n 1 whose occupational plans had b&eivaffected
■by l e!dritkets with ah advis'er or counsellor said that the
tridifttibaP hdd disdissed se* discrimination in the area
CoiTside'rihg.' Advisers are most influential as
fol£ rhollels. WhCri students were risked to "check the
statements' which; you feel accurately describe the nature
of 1 the contacts With your'freshman, adviser which affec
ted! ybur occupational consideration,"' the most fre
quently checked response was "Adviser acted as a posi
tive example of Individual in field." "Adviser acted as 1 a
negative example of individual in field" was also checked
frequently, and woijien students found advisers
equally important as role models. It is important to
note, however, that the large majority of these advisers
are men.
Suggestions for Improvements
Students were asked to respond to two open ended
questions about Stanford services: "What services that
Stanford now offers, if any, have been helpful to you in
planning your future:" and "What services which are not
now offered would you find helpful:" 60% of the 136
men answering the questionnaire and 54% of the 144
women mentioned some service at Stanford which had
been helpful to them. (These percentages refer to pro
portion of respondents. They have not been weighted to
represent the whole class.) Those services mentioned
most frequently were the Academic Information Center,
(41 times), the Career Counselling and Placement Cen
ter, (39 times), and the pre-med advising services, (18
times). 51 men and 61 women suggested improvements
in Stanford services. The most frequent target of sugges
tions were the departments, especially among women.
32 women and 15 men said that departments should be
more helpful in planning their futures. Helping students
plan their futures would be a new role for departments.
Only 11 students said their departments had actually
been helpful while they were at Stanford, and most of

the praise resulted from opportunities for practical ex
perience in their fields, not from advice or information
they had received.
Generally, students said they would have liked more
informal, personal contacts with professors, counsellors,
and people in the fields they are considering to give
them a better sense of what they wanted to do in the
future. One student suggested:

a broad, coordinated counselling service, with
competent people who can talk meaningfully
about a variety of occupations and lifestyles those
occupations shape. (Not just an engineering coun
sellor for engineering, an econ adviser for econ,
etc.)
i>i 112 c / . ' ! ; i ) I
Departments were suggested as an alternative source of
information about the employment possibilities stem
ming from a field of study.
A larger proportion of women than men students
have immediate need of career counselling and place
ment services. More of the women are planning to get a
full-time job as soon as they leave Stanford. 29% of the
women and 18% of the men said they expected to be
working full-time in the six months after graduation.
Women also seem to need more help in finding jobs. 26%
of the women who were planning to work full-time after
graduation have already looked for jobs in the area in
which they wanted to work, and only 7% had found
jobs. 18% of the men had looked for employment, and
11% had found jobs. Therefore, it is particularly im
portant for women students that occupational counsel
ling services be improved.
Policy Implications
1. The Career Planning and Placement Center should
make a special effort to help women plan their careers
and find jobs. Since a large number of women are trying
to find jobs in areas where few women have been hired
before, the Placement Center should make aggressive
efforts to place these women.
We recommend that the Career Planning and Place
ment Center report on what activities and what addi
tional staff are required in order to provide better service
to women undergraduates.
2. Women should be prepared to cope with discrimina
tion when they encounter it. We recommend that legal
and practical counselling about dealing with discrimina
tion be made available at the Placement Center.
3. Major department should be involved in occupation
counselling efforts. The experience and contacts of Stan
ford professors remain a largely untapped resource. As
some students suggested, departments should institute
programs in conjunction with the Career Planning and
Placement Center which offer an overview of the occu
pations open to men and women with training in differ
ent academic fields. Women should be well represented
in all such programs.
Wc recommend that each department provide a pro
gram of occupational counselling for its men and women
majors, either on its own or in conjunction with the
Career Planning and Placement Center.
4. Our data shows that advisers and counsellors current
ly discuss the problem of discrimination with their
women students. As several students suggested, this kind
of discussion can often be more discouraging than help
ful. Stanford advisers and counsellors need to be sensi
tive to the fine line between a fatalistic discussion of
discrimination and one that prepares women to meet the
difficulties they will encounter with determination in
stead of with surprise.
We recommend that the Dean of Students Office
develop written material and discussion sessions for ad
visers and counsellors that will orient them to the special
needs of women students.
5. Role modeling is an important function of Stanford
advisers. Yet most Stanford professors are men. There
fore. students have few opportunities to meet successful
professional women and to observe alternative ap
proaches to being a working woman or a working
mother. We recommend that the Dean of Students en
courage the participation of professional women in Uni
versity public functions and in activities at University
residences, until there are more women on the faculty.
