# Kelley Leads Team
## Basketball Season Opens 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
When the 1972-73 Stanford basketball team
picture was taken four weeks ago, Coach Howie
Dallmar assumed an unfamiliar pose. For the first
time in many picture days, Dallmar smiled.
The 19 year Stanford coach has endured five
straight losing seasons but his picture day smile may
have signified the start of a new era of Stanford
basketball. Dallmar's 1972-73 squad features the
youngest, tallest, and possibly best group of talent
ever assembled at Stanford.
Last year's entire front line returns along with six
sophomores from last year's 16-3 freshman team, a
squad which Dallmar called "Stanford's best
freshman team ever." Two promising freshmen,
6-11 Tim Patterson and 6-9 Ed Schweitzer further
brighten the Cards' outlook.
"We've never had this much height or depth,"
says Dallmar. "We'll be able to do a lot more things
offensively and defensively."
7 Foot Soph •
The biggest reason for Dallmar's optimism is 7
foot sophomore center Rich Kelley, who averaged
18.1 points and 16.7 rebounds for the frosh last
year. Kelley, whose skills are remarkably advanced
for a sophomore "has all the tools to be a great
one," according to new assistant coach Billy Jones.
Dallmar agrees wholeheartedly with Jones'
appraisal. "Kelley will be an outstanding player,
there isn't any doubt," he says.
Kelley is probably the only sure starter on a team
which includes at least 10 candidates for starting
roles. "The starting spots are wide open," says
Dallmar. "We'll probably start different lineups for
different teams, particularly in December."
Dallmar has installed a double post offense to
take advantage of Stanford's height and versatility.
Kelley, Mike Mann (6-9), Steve Shupe (6-6),
Patterson, and Schweitzer are the leading candidates
for the two post positions. Also in the running is
6-10 Jack Loomis, who gained immeasurable fame
against Air Force last year when he fouled out in
3:50.
Playmaker
Sophomore Mark Gilberg has the inside track on
the point position, the only bona fide guard spot in
the Card offense. Gilberg, the leading scorer in

California as a prep at Lowell High School with an
average of 34 points a game, turned play maker for
the frosh last year. He scored only 9.5 points a game
but his ballhandling, passing, and quickness were
important factors in Stanford's success.
Gilberg may be pressed by Jim Montague, a 6-0
transfer from El Camino Jr. College.
The two wing positions are up for grabs.
Veterans Bob Buell (6-5), Dave Frost (6-5), and Pat
Rusco (6-4), will be challenged by newcomers Scott
Trobbe (6-6), Mel Arterberry (6-5), Mike Simons
(6-4), and Archie Dean (6-5) from last year's frosh.
Frost, the team's best outside shooter, is the
most likely starter. Frost averaged 10.5 points a
game last year even though he was sidelined much
of the season with a bad back. This year his back is
completely recovered and the bruising 230 pound
junior who is also a pitcher on the Card baseball
team could put himself high on the list of Stanford
all-time scorers in the next year years.
Open At USF
The Cards open their season on Dec. 1 against
USF, a team which is ranked in the nation's top 20
in most of the preseason polls. "USF will be a tough
assignment for a young team to face in their first
game," says Dallmar.
The Dons have four starters returning from last
year's West Coast Athletic Conference champions,
including 6-9 forwards Kevin Restani and Byron
(Snake) Jones. Restani, Jones, and 6-9 sophomore
Eric Fernstein give USF one of the nation's biggest
and toughest front lines.
If the Cards can defeat the Dons in the opener, it
could provide the momentum for the best Stanford
season since Dallmar's 1962 team posted a 20-6
record.
Flexibility
Bub Bowling, who starts his fourth year as a
Stanford assistant, is equally optimistic. "We'll have
a tremendous amount of flexibility," he says. "We
can run, press, and handle the ball-things that are
enjoyable to watch and for the players to do.
Dallmar, Bowling, and Jones pointed to defense
and rebounding aggression as the team's most likely
weaknesses. And of course Stanford's lack of
experience could be a tough obstacle to overcome,
especially early in the season.

GONE BUT NOT FORGOTTEN - Claude Terry, the most prolific
scorer in Stanford basketball history, has graduated to the
professional ranks. But four other starters return, and sophomore
center Rich Kelley (7-0) and two tall, talented freshmen, Tim
Patterson and Ed Schweitzer, add depth to coach Howie Dallmar's
tallest team ever.
