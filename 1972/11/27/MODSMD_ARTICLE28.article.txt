Services Held At Southern U.
BATON ROUGE, La. — A memorial service for the
two black students slain at Southern University
drew 400 people to the steps of the state capitol
yesterday as two independent commissions prepared
to begin full-scale investigations of the Nov. 16
police-student confrontation at the school.
State officials and school administrators,
meanwhile, countered threats of continued
turbulence with pleas for calm as they prepared to
resume classes at Southern's smaller New Orleans
branch for the first time since the tragedy 90 miles
to the north.
About 400 blacks assembled for the hour-long
rally. Leaders said it was in memorial for the two
dead students. John E. Brown, who told the crowd
he had organized the event, said, "The very
existence of the black race today is threatened."
Brown said several national civil rights leaders
had been invited to speak, but he said none was able
to attend.
Focal point for the activity was the 30 minutes
of violence on Nov. 16 which exploded as officers
chased students from Southern's administration
building. Denver A. Smith of New Roads, La., and
Leonard Douglas Brown, Bilbert, La., both 20, were
sprayed with buckshot and died of head wounds.
Authorities contended at the start that officers fired
nothing but tear gas. Later, however, they conceded
that an officer could have mistaken a shotgun
cartridge for tear gas cartridge.

Four Slain In Dublin Shootout
DUBLIN — Gunmen disguised as priests and doctors
staged a blazing shootout with Irish detectives inside
a Dublin hospital last night in a vain attempt to
spring ailing Sean MacStiofain, reputed commander
of the Irish Republican Army's guerrillas, from
police custody.
Police said four persons were shot and wounded
in the bid by eight gunmen to free MacStiofain from
the Mater Hospital, where he was confined after
being sentenced Saturday to six months in jail.
The casualties were one gunman, one policeman
and two bystanders, all reported "slightly injured."
Hussein Escapes Assassination
BEIRUT — King Hussein of Jordan narrowly
escaped assassination earlier this month when a
rebel Jordanian air force pilot fired a rocket at the
monarch's helicopter on the palace grounds and
blew it up, the Lebanese newspaper An Nahar said
yesterday.
Earlier in the weekend, the leftist newspaper A 1
Moharrer reported that a coup engineered by 300
dissident air force and army officers had failed after
word of it was leaked to Hussein.
There was no official word from Jordan on the
reports of the attempts at a coup and assassination.
Hussein, who was about to board the helicopter,
escaped with a minor shrapnel wound in the thigh,
An Nahar reported.
A 1 Moharrer reported that the officers behind the

coup wanted to overthrow Hussein and proclaim a
republic in Jordan.
Firebomb Suspect Booked
MENLO PARK — A 39-year-old Menlo Park man
was booked for investigation of attempted murder
yesterday in a tavern firebombing which severely
burned two customers, the San Mateo County
Sheriffs office reported.
A department spokesman said Francis Leroy
Thornton, who lives about 14 blocks from the
bombed establishment, was booked on two counts
of attempted murder, possession of a firebomb and
making a false bomb report.
A gallon jug of flammable liquid was tossed
through the doorway of The Mug, a tavern at
Middlefield Road at 7th Avenue east of here
Saturday night, burning two persons and causing an
estimated $12,000 damage, investigators said.
At Stanford University Medical Center, Vincent
McMorrow, 52, and his wife, Leona, 49, of
Redwood City were reported in serious condition
yesterday.
Sheriff's Sgt. William Sweeney said it was a
miracle no one else was hurt. Patrons kicked down
the rear door to escape the building, he said.
Today's Weather
Fair through tomorrow except patchy morning fog.
Little temperature change. Low tonight in the 40s.
Highs today and tomorrow in the mid 50s to low
60s. Light wind.
