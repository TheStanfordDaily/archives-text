# Campaigners Plan Future Political Activity
## 
### NANCI COLVERT 
Two weeks ago many Stanford
students were deeply involved in
various election campaigns. Today
they are trying to catch up
academically, and have differing plans
regarding future political activity.
Nixon supporters who revived the
lagging Young Republican group to
campaign for the President are
planning a membership drive in order
to "establish a vehicle for meeting
other Republicans and hanging
together socially until we have
somebody to work for again,"
according to Ray White, who served as
chairman of the group's dorm canvass
committee.
"In our canvass of one-third of the
dorms we contacted 600 pro-Nixon
people. We intend to build a

community that hasn't existed before,
composed of pro-Nixon people and
those to the right of him," he said.
According to Kevin O'Grady,
Chairman of the campus' campaign for
McGovern, the Senator's backers here
plan to continue their political
involvement through an independent
group they are organizing called the
Stanford Committee on Political
Education (SCOPE).
Plans for the group tentatively
include film and lecture series and
study groups on specific issues
including those facing distinct groups
such as the legal and medical
professions.
Jim Friend, Co-chairman of
McCloskey's Stanford campaign
referred to himself as "not politically
oriented."

"McCloskey is one of the few
candidates that can get me involved
politically. He is the ideal candidate in
that he is so honest and straight
forward.
"I think that our people did not
become as disillusioned as some of the
other campaign workers because of
this," he said.
Friend emphasized that most of the
workers were not Republicans with
ties to the party because McCloskey's>
liberal stance doesn't appeal to many
of those.
They are not staying together in
any formal organization to work for
future candidates, but Friend, who has
worked for McCloskey since 1967,
said he would continue to support him
in the future.

Larry Diamond, who was north
district campus co-ordinator of the
Stewart campaign and a delegate to
the Democratic convention, has not
alighned himself with a Young Dems
organization because, "they are all
farces," he said.
"All they do is bicker and struggle
for power within the group and the
party. Even the youth caucus at the
convention was that way," he said.
Diamond stated he is close to
Stewart and will continue to work for
him as he feels there is a good chance
he will run for office again because of
upcoming statewide redistricting.
Speculating on the 1976 election,
White said Vice President Agnew Spiro
has present control of the Republican
Party and a headstart towards the
nomination.

convention was that way," he said.
Diamond stated he is close to
Stewart and will continue to work for
him as he feels there is a good chance
he will run for office again because of
upcoming statewide redistricting.
Speculating on the 1976 election,
White said Vice President Agnew Spiro
has present control of the Republican
Party and a headstart towards the
nomination.
Two weeks ago many Stanford
students were deeply involved in
various election campaigns. Today
they are trying to catch up
academically, and have differing plans
regarding future political activity.
Nixon supporters who revived the
lagging Young Republican group to
campaign for the President are
planning a membership drive in order
to "establish a vehicle for meeting
other Republicans and hanging
together socially until we have
somebody to work for again,"
according to Ray White, who served as
chairman of the group's dorm canvass
committee.
"In our canvass of one-third of the
dorms we contacted 600 pro-Nixon
people. We intend to build a

community that hasn't existed before,
composed of pro-Nixon people and
those to the right of him," he said.
According to Kevin O'Grady,
Chairman of the campus' campaign for
McGovern, the Senator's backers here
plan to continue their political
involvement through an independent
group they are organizing called the
Stanford Committee on Political
Education (SCOPE).
Plans for the group tentatively
include film and lecture series and
study groups on specific issues
including those facing distinct groups
such as the legal and medical
professions.
Jim Friend, Co-chairman of
McCloskey's Stanford campaign
referred to himself as "not politically
oriented."

"McCloskey is one of the few
candidates that can get me involved
politically. He is the ideal candidate in
that he is so honest and straight
forward.
"I think that our people did not
become as disillusioned as some of the
other campaign workers because of
this," he said.
Friend emphasized that most of the
workers were not Republicans with
ties to the party because McCloskey's>
liberal stance doesn't appeal to many
of those.
They are not staying together in
any formal organization to work for
future candidates, but Friend, who has
worked for McCloskey since 1967,
said he would continue to support him
in the future.

Larry Diamond, who was north
district campus co-ordinator of the
Stewart campaign and a delegate to
the Democratic convention, has not
alighned himself with a Young Dems
organization because, "they are all
farces," he said.
"All they do is bicker and struggle
for power within the group and the
party. Even the youth caucus at the
convention was that way," he said.
Diamond stated he is close to
Stewart and will continue to work for
him as he feels there is a good chance
he will run for office again because of
upcoming statewide redistricting.
