# President, Kissinger Discuss Stalled Talks
## 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) - President Nixon,
described as confident of the "right
kind" of Vietnam peace settlement,
resumed conferences on the recessed
Paris talks yesterday with chief
negotiator Henry A. Kissinger.
Nixon and Kissinger met for almost
an hour yesterday morning at the
Waldorf Astoria, where the President
and his family were spending the
weekend. It was the second meeting
since Kissinger returned from Paris late
Saturday night after he and North
Vietnamese negotiators agreed to
break off the talks for nine days.
Nixon was scheduled to return to
his retreat at Camp David, Md., later in
the day, while Kissinger was expected
to go on to Washington. The two will
confer again today at Camp David, a
White House spokesman said.
Ronald Ziegler, the presidential
press secretary, also said Nixon and
Kissinger would meet this week with
Nguyen Phu Due, an emissary of
South Vietnamese President Nguyen
Van Thieu. The exact time of the
meeting was not set.
The meeting was requested by
Thieu last week and has been seen by
some observers as an effort to bypass
Kissinger, who has been criticized by
the South Vietnamese for not paying
enough attention to their objections to
the peace proposals.
The Paris meetings between
Kissinger and Hanoi's Le Due Tho
were suspended until Dec. 4 on
Saturday amid some speculation that
serious difficulties had arisen.
American officials would not
comment on the cause of the
interruption, which came after six
sessions.
South Vietnam's special observers
at the talks were reported to have told
Thieu that negotiations were "virtually
deadlocked over North Vietnamese
troop withdrawals." A Saigon
newspaper controlled by Thieu's
Independence Palace quoted a "high
source" as saying no optimistic signs
had been seen in Paris.
Kissinger and Tho refused comment
on a Washington Post story that said
the talks were deadlocked by an
American refusal to honor the

tentative agreement reached last
month.
However, Ziegler, when asked if
interruption of the talks indicated
serious problems, said, "I'd be very
cautious about that kind of
speculation." He said the break would
allow further consultations with South
Vietnam.
