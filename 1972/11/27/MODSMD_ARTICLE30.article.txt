# German 1-P To Use Computer Instruction
## 
### 
The German Studies Department
and the Institute for Mathematical
Studies in the Social Sciences have
organized what might be the most
advanced computer teaching method
in use.
German 1-P, a first quarter, first
year course, will be offered Winter
Quarter as an independent study
option using a computer and allowing
the student to finish as much of first
year German as he is able. Students
will use the same text as the regular
classes but instead of attending class
will do exercises on the computer in
Ventura Hall as well as working in the
language laboratory.
Margarete Eifler, Assistant
Professor of German will teach the
course, holding office hours and some
sections on specific topics, with class
attendance optional. Students can take
the course for anywhere from three to
15 units, depending on how far they
get.
Each student will have to pass a test
on each unit before receiving credit for
it. According to Walter Lohnes,
Director of first and second year
German and co-author of the text,
students on independent study will
have to score better than those in
classes.

The computer portion of the
program is being coordinated by
Professor Patrick Suppes, Director of
the Institute of Mathematical Studies
and Social Sciences, along with two
graduate students; David Levine and
Renate Krug von Nidden. Levine is
doing his doctoral thesis on
programming for language teaching.
According to Suppes this is one of
the most sophisticated programs for
language instruction to be applied to
actual teaching. In his words, "The
nice thing about this program is that it
is in a direct application to instruction,
in this case the teaching of German. I
think it is probably the first time in
that area."
The unique thing about the
program is its ability to correct
grammatical errors, rather than just give
the correct answer. For example, if a
student writes, "the cup are broken"
the computer would not only correct
him by printing "the cup is broken"
but in addition would print that "cup"
needs a singular verb.
According to Suppes, instructional
programming is an area of intense
investigation now and that this
project, founded under the National
Science Foundation, is a breakthrough
in this area.
