# Students Fight For Hopkins Base
## 
### BRAD THOMPSON 
Reactions to a year-old evaluation, a number of
misunderstandings, and the resignation of the director are
among the problems that have kept the Hopkins Marine
Station in Pacific Grove immersed in controversy for the
past few weeks.
Sparking a series of charges, countercharges and
committee meetings was an opinion article in the Nov. 15
Daily by Allen Shotwell, a senior in biology, who
maintained that through a number of actions and
attitudes, the University was slowly "phasing out" the
marine station.
"Because the station is viewed as such an important
national facility, Stanford is wholly committed to keeping
it open," said Biology Dept. Chairman Norman Wessells.
As Shotwell maintains that his letter summarized the
objections of a significant number of students and faculty
dealing with the marine station, University officials have
denied any validity to his charges.
Wants Fair Shake
"I don't want to hang anyone," Shotwell said when
contacted by the Daily, "I just want to make sure the
marine station gets a fair shake from the University."
Shotwell's objections, outlined in his article, centered
around the use of funds; the basic direction and focus the
station was to assume and the University's "suppression"
of a report praising the marine station.
Quite separate from the charges and countercharges,
the University has announced the resignation of Prof.
John H. Phillips, Jr. as director of the marine station in
order that he may resume teaching at the marine station.
Poor Money Use
"I can sympathize with the University and a tight
money situation," Shotwell said. "But I really think that
the money the marine station is granted is being used less
and less for quality teaching."
Examples, Shotwell said, were the cutback in faculty
positions of the University's oceanographic research
vessel, the R/V Proteus, and "one of the most valuable
teachers and researchers, [Dr.] Welton Lee," who did not
receive tenure recommendation.
Wessells, responding to the examination and use of
funds said that "the marine station is receiving the same
hard look that all small, expensive programs receive. A

small number of students are getting a terrific education,
but the costs are so high that it can't be expanded to a
campus-wide basis."
Three Professors Now
Wessells said that the present staff at the station was
three professors, with plans to hire at least one more.
"One of our major goals is to increase the interaction
between the main campus and the base at Pacific Grove,"
Wessells said. "We are keeping the 15-unit spring course
and the base faculty will be teaching at least part of the
time on campus."
Provost William Miller echoed the cutback rationale:
"The deep-water program was very expensive. Our
intention was to phase out the expensive deep-water
program and strengthen the less-expensive shore base
program."
Shotwell further charged that the station has been
misdirected, resulting in a general feeling of "ambivilance"
towards teaching and students on the part of the
department of biology and a total devotion to research.
The third charge leveled by Shotwell was that the
University was "suppressing" a highly complimentary
report on the station that could have led to increased
budgetary allowances.
Shotwell was referring to a report on evaluation made a
year ago for the president of the University by a group of
visiting researchers.
Good Evaluation
"The report, which was finally released to the faculty
at the station and a few students, could have been
published very easily without publicly hurting anyone. It
was a good evaluation," Shotwell said, "and could have
done the station a lot of good. It was suppressed just as a
matter of standard procedure."
Wessells concurred that the report was not released as a
matter of policy. "We never release reports of this nature.
Their purpose is to survey a portion of the University. It's
hoped that this allows the observers to assume a 'gloves
off attitude to the problems they see."
Miller said that the confidential reports have been very
useful tools, allowing evaluaters to make comments of a
candid nature they might otherwise feel inhibited to make
if they knew their comments would be published.

past few weeks.
Sparking a series of charges, countercharges and
committee meetings was an opinion article in the Nov. 15
Daily by Allen Shotwell, a senior in biology, who
maintained that through a number of actions and
attitudes, the University was slowly "phasing out" the
marine station.
"Because the station is viewed as such an important
national facility, Stanford is wholly committed to keeping
it open," said Biology Dept. Chairman Norman Wessells.
As Shotwell maintains that his letter summarized the
objections of a significant number of students and faculty
dealing with the marine station, University officials have
denied any validity to his charges.
Wants Fair Shake
"I don't want to hang anyone," Shotwell said when
contacted by the Daily, "I just want to make sure the
marine station gets a fair shake from the University."
Shotwell's objections, outlined in his article, centered
around the use of funds; the basic direction and focus the
station was to assume and the University's "suppression"
of a report praising the marine station.
Quite separate from the charges and countercharges,
the University has announced the resignation of Prof.
John H. Phillips, Jr. as director of the marine station in
order that he may resume teaching at the marine station.
Poor Money Use
"I can sympathize with the University and a tight
money situation," Shotwell said. "But I really think that
the money the marine station is granted is being used less
and less for quality teaching."
Examples, Shotwell said, were the cutback in faculty
positions of the University's oceanographic research
vessel, the R/V Proteus, and "one of the most valuable
teachers and researchers, [Dr.] Welton Lee," who did not
receive tenure recommendation.
Wessells, responding to the examination and use of
funds said that "the marine station is receiving the same
hard look that all small, expensive programs receive. A

small number of students are getting a terrific education,
but the costs are so high that it can't be expanded to a
campus-wide basis."
Three Professors Now
Wessells said that the present staff at the station was
three professors, with plans to hire at least one more.
"One of our major goals is to increase the interaction
between the main campus and the base at Pacific Grove,"
Wessells said. "We are keeping the 15-unit spring course
and the base faculty will be teaching at least part of the
time on campus."
Provost William Miller echoed the cutback rationale:
"The deep-water program was very expensive. Our
intention was to phase out the expensive deep-water
program and strengthen the less-expensive shore base
program."
Shotwell further charged that the station has been
misdirected, resulting in a general feeling of "ambivilance"
towards teaching and students on the part of the
department of biology and a total devotion to research.
The third charge leveled by Shotwell was that the
University was "suppressing" a highly complimentary
report on the station that could have led to increased
budgetary allowances.
Shotwell was referring to a report on evaluation made a
year ago for the president of the University by a group of
visiting researchers.
Good Evaluation
"The report, which was finally released to the faculty
at the station and a few students, could have been
published very easily without publicly hurting anyone. It
was a good evaluation," Shotwell said, "and could have
done the station a lot of good. It was suppressed just as a
matter of standard procedure."
Wessells concurred that the report was not released as a
matter of policy. "We never release reports of this nature.
Their purpose is to survey a portion of the University. It's
hoped that this allows the observers to assume a 'gloves
off attitude to the problems they see."
Miller said that the confidential reports have been very
useful tools, allowing evaluaters to make comments of a
candid nature they might otherwise feel inhibited to make
if they knew their comments would be published.
Reactions to a year-old evaluation, a number of
misunderstandings, and the resignation of the director are
among the problems that have kept the Hopkins Marine
Station in Pacific Grove immersed in controversy for the
past few weeks.
