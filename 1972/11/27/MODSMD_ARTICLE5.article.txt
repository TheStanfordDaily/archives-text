# Trustees Modify Housing Plans; Committees Plan Public Hearing
## 
### ROBERT BACON 
University Trustees last week
modified plans for the Frenchman's
Terrace low/moderate-income housing
development to give tenancy priority
to some persons not employed on
Stanford lands.

In a related matter, two University
committees announced plans for a
joint public hearing Dec. 11 on the
proposed annexation to Palo Alto of
the inter-section of Stanford Avenue
and Bowdoin Street.
Both actions were reported in a
letter from University Vice President
for Business and Finance, Robert R.
Augsburger, to the Palo Alto City
Council, written Nov. 16 and released
by the City Clerk's office over the
weekend.
The Board of Trustees voted to
alter the tenancy priority system at
the proposed development so that first
priority for 25 percent of the 225
housing units will go to persons
employed in non-Stanford-related
concerns in Palo Alto.
Priorities Announced
Priority for one-half the units will
go to Stanford employees; the Board
reduced from 50 percent to 25 percent
the proportion of units for which
employees of commercial and
industrial tenants of Stanford
principally the Industrial Park and
Shopping Center - will have priority.
Augsburger said that the change
was made on his recommendation as a

response to "a concern expressed at
Planning Commission and City Council
meetings that this project ought to be
a joint effort between the city and
Stanford."
On Oct. 4, the Palo Alto Planning
Commission, considering zoning of the
project site, voted to prohibit any
priority scheme in the development.
That decision was reversed by the City
Council, the final authority, by a 5-4
vote Oct. 30. An attempt to reconsider
on Nov. 13 failed.
Previous Plan Rejected
Several planning commissioners and
council members stressed that the
all-Stanford priority scheme previously
proposed by the University was
unacceptable. Augsburger, in his
testimony before the two city bodies,
was equally insistent that such a
scheme was necessary to justify use of
University land for the project.
Augsburger yesterday denied that
addition of the 25 percent Palo Alto
priority was part of a deal to gain City
approval for any priority scheme.
City Planning Director Naphtali H.
Knox, in a report to the Council on
Oct. 27, suggested a scheme similar to
that adopted by the Trustees, as a

potential compromise on the priorities
question.
On Stanford Land
The federally-financed development
is to be located on Stanford land at
the intersections of Peter Coutts and
Page Mill Roads, between the faculty
housing area and the Stanford
Industrial Park.
Final approval of the zoning
ordinance earlier this month leaves
annexation of the site pending before
the Council, which is scheduled to
consider it Dec. 18.
This issue has been complicated by
questions as to the exact extent of th
area to be annexed.
Bid Expanded
The University originally applied to
have the 20-acre project site and that
portion of Peter Coutts Road adjacent
thereto, brought into the city limits.
They have since expanded their bid to
include the entire length of Peter
Coutts Road. The County Local
Agency Formation Commission
(LAFCO) has approved this
application.
In January, Stanford will seek
LAFCO approval, required by law, for
