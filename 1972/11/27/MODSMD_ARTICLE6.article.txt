# Search For Boggs Indefinitely Suspended
## 
### 
The search for House Majority
Leader Hale Boggs (D-La) and three
others missing since Oct. 16 along the
rugged southern coast of Alaska has
been indefinitely suspended.
Defense Secretary Melvin R. Laird
and Alaska Gov. William Egan told
Boggs' wife that the six-week search
was being ended because it had proved
fruitless and because of worsening
weather conditions.
A Cessna 310 bearing Boggs,
Congressman Nicholas Begich
(D-Alaska), Begich aide Russell L.
Brown and pilot Don E. Jonz
disappeared on a flight from
Anchorage to Juneau. Boggs had been

campaigning for Begich's reelection.
Air Force Major Ken Shelley said
that the search would be resumed only
if new clues are found.
Will Seek Vacant Post
Although Boggs' seat has not been
officially declared vacant, two
congressmen have already announced
their intention to seek his post as
Majority Leader. The current Majority
Whip, Thomas P. O'Neill (D-Mass.),
appears to have the necessary votes for
selection as Boggs' successor.
O'Neill, 59, was first elected to the
House in 1952 to replace John F.
Kennedy, who was a successful
candidate for the Senate that year. He

was elected to succeed Boggs as
Majority Whip in Januray 1971 and is
considered one of the most popular
men in the House.
Observers estimate that O'Neill has
at least 150 votes pledged to him,
while he needs only 123 to beat
Florida Congressman Sam Gibbons.
The majority leadership has
traditionally been the key stepping
stone towards election as House
Speaker.
Some factions in the House had
wanted Boggs to challenge incumbent
Speaker Carl B. Albert (D-Okla.) for
his job when Congress reconvenes on
Jan. 3. It now appears that Albert will
face only token opposition from
Georgia Congressman Phil Landrum.
"Extraordinary" Seach Effort
Boggs' wife, Lindy, has expressed
interest in seeking her husband's seat
when it is declared vacant either by
Congress or by Arkansas Gov. Dale
Bumpers. Both Boggs and Begich were
reelected last Nov. 7.

Begich's wife, Pegge, has also
announced plans to seek her husband's
seat when it is declared vacant. She
faces possible oppostition from
Democrats Chancy Croft, a State
Senator, Lt. Gov. H. A. Boucher and
State Attorney General John E.
Havelock. The likely Republican
nominee is riverboat operator Don
Young, who opposed Begich in the
latest election.
Presumption-of-death hearings
under Alaska law are expected to
being on Dec. 11. The hearing could
be followed by special elections to fill
the two Congressmen's seats.
Military and private planes logged
more than 3600 hours in the air and
covered an estimated 325,000 square
miles in their search for the missing
plane. The operation was the largest of
its kind in Alaska history. Laird said
that the search effort, which involved
1,030 flights, was an "extraordinary"
effort.
