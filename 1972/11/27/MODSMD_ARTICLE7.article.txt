## ASSU Senate 
### 
In the past few years, the ASSU Senate has been
characterized as a "sandbox" many times. This label has
often been very appropriate for a body which has been
dominated by petty political fighting and which has
accomplished very little of substance.
Stanford's student government, with its history of
problems, is not unique. Most student governments are
characterized by egotism, bickering and incompetence. Part
of the problem is due to the small amount of power given to
most student governments by college administrations. But
much of the problem at Stanford can be traced to a number
of student politicians who have been interested primarily in
personal gain.
Student government officials should spend their time
using what power they have to serve their constituency and
at the same time try to increase that power through effective
application of pressure on administrations. These directions
liave been noticeably lacking at Stanford for a number of
years.
All too often, ASSU officials have been very unresponsive
to the wishes and desires of their constituency. The lack of
faith in the ASSU is illustrated by the low number of
candidates and voters who participated in the most recent
senatorial elections.
This year's Student Senate has finally met for the first
time and elected a chairman. Rocky Barber now has the
unenviable job of trying to improve the record of the
Senate, which has been dismal at best. Barber realizes
correctly that students have little faith in the body he now
heads and that power will come only when the students
"believe in" the Senate. More student support is a crucial
prerequisite for gaining additional power and we hope that
this year's Senate will merit increased support. We cannot
fequarrel with Barber's analysis, but taking into consideration
sthe records of recent Senates, we are frankly skeptical of his
Schances for success.
fj The current ASSU Council of Presidents instituted a
I number of reforms in the structure of the Senate earlier this
" quarter. Regardless of the merits of those reforms, we feel it
v is obvious that the Senate will improve only as the people
|who make up the body become more responsible and
Iresponsive. We're anxious to see how the newly-elected
will operate. Hopefully this year most Senators will
A*be more Viterested in serving students than in adding a
-student government post to their transcripts.
