BAND BANNED IN PHILLY
— While Stanford's Band manages
to get away with just about
anything the Stanford Marching
Unit Thinkers (SMUT) can dream
up, not so in Frank Rizzo's
Philadelphia. A musical skit
satirizing President Nixon and ITT
was removed from the University
of Pennsylvania's halftime
performance after a Penn VP
criticized the band and said that
the skit would "irritate alumni."
The Penn marchers, who had
spelled out ITT while playing
"Hail To The Chief" in an Oct. 14
game against Cornell, had to
change "ITT" to "PAT." One of
the big pressures at Penn for

switching the letters, according to
a university officer, was the
"generous contribution and
support" from the government
and ITT. As Peg Schnarr, Band
President (how about that
MCP's!) tittered, she did not want
to "bite the hand that feeds you,"
and apologized to the university.
Coincidentally, President
Nixon, Vice President Agnew, and
Governor Nelson "Rocky"
Rockefeller were in the City of
Brotherly Love the Friday before
the game signing a big
revenue-sharing bill. Well, that's
show biz.

RAHRAHRAH: YOU'RE

UNDER ARREST - In the latest
effort to catch illegal grandstand
drinking, fighting, gate crashing
and so forth, the University of
Colorado in Boulder has installed
TV cameras in the football
stadium pressbox to spy on the
fans. A telephoto lens pans the
the crowd, recording rooting,
boozing, yelling, cheering, and —
horrors! — chanting. They ought
to play the Rose Bowl in Boulder
in 1984; they're set up for it.

AHHHHHHPATHY
Northern Illinois University really
got excited about voting on
election day. But they weren't
lining up all day to vote for Nixon

or McGovern. No, the big contest
that day was the vote for "The
Most Dateable Greek," with
candidates coming from the Greek
fraternities and sororities on
campus. The big issues of the day
there weren't war or inflation or
national security; instead voters
were ... troubled by trying to
decide who indeed was the most
friendly or best looking of their
frat bro and sisters. As a
columnist for the Northern Star
wrote, "After all, even one of the
most famous, if not most
dateable, Greek Mythers, the
Cyclops, had a rather limited
perspective and one-sided view."

SERVED ON A BED OF
LETTUCE? — From Texas Tech
University, Lubbock, Tex. comes
the report that female occupants
of university apartments there
label the visitation policy for men
"a bunch of baloney." The rules
state that male visitors may make
house calls each week only from
noon Friday to 1:30 a.m.
Saturday, noon Saturday to 1:30
a.m. Sunday, and noon to
midnight Sunday. Clifford Yoder,
an adminstration assistant (read
lackey) confirmed that the
visitation policy was drawn up
because "a 24-hour open house
policy doesn't provide satisfactory
living for girls on or off campus."
"Baloney," socked Susie
Pankratz, senior secondary
education major. "What are our
dates supposed to do when they
come to pick us up, drive up and
honk?" Honk?
On the other side of the
picture, Texas Tech has decided —
now get this — to permit women's
visiting hours in men's dorms
from weekends only to seven big
nights a week. Administration
Assistant Yoder (remember him?)
gave the OK after residence halls
overwhelmingly approved of the
new proposal. One wonders what
they'd do when they found out
that Stanford has co-ed
dormitories.

HORDES! THUNDERING
HORDES! — Down in Smog
Angeles, the sale of UCLA student
season basketball tickets caused a
big rush as 1000 more students
showed up than there were

tickets. Although there won't be a
Rose Bowl rush at Maples this
year, anyone who tried to buy a
ticket last year will recall the
incredible crunch of people, the
cuts being taken in line, and the
guy in front of the line who
wanted to kp.ow every seat
available beiore making a
purchase. Many students waited
over 12 hours in L.A. just to be
turned down for a seat.

FAIR PLAY FOR DOGS:
PUPPY POWER - At Utah
(yawn) State University, the Oct.
13 editorial of the school paper
Student Life dealt with the unjust
discrimination of dogs on campus.
Seems the university announced
"No dogs, on leash or otherwise
will be allowed on campus." Well,
the managing editor was snarling
mad. "It doesn't take 'Judd for
the Defense' or Melvin Belli to
free the dogs of these ridiculous
charges," barked Barry Willis in
response to the Logan City ruling.
While Stanford has a lot of dogs
running all over, most of them are
friendly, and those that aren't
should be on a leash or at least
muzzled.

Y 0 U-THINK-THE-DORM
FOOD-flEfl£-IS-BADDEPT. At
the Lake Shore Dining Hall at
Loyola University in Illinois, at
least 250 Loyola residents were
striken ill and one hospitalized
after tainted meat was served. At
other university residences,
especially the Mertz cafeteria,
people were turning various
shades of purple from the rotten
roast. Mertz food committee
chairman Even Karnes burped,
"It's never been this bad before."
The pois-in happened late last
month and almost the whole
campus, athletes included, were
punched out of shape. So be
careful if your plate of food seems
to be forming a chemical reaction
before you.
Luckily, the food here at
Stanford has seldom caused such
an organic reaction. Remember
though, Rol-aids do consume 47
times their weight in excess
stomach acid.
