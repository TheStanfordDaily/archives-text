# Wilbur's Grandson Treats Cancer
## 
### JON BRAUN 
With the opening of the Oncology Unit of the
Children's Hospital at Stanford this fall, a venerable
name in University history has returned to campus.
Dr. Jordan R. Wilbur, grandson of Ray Lyman
Wilbur, University president (1916-1943), and
director of the Children's Oncology Unit, discussed
memories of his famous grandfather, his association
with the campus, and his work at the Children's
Hospital.
Dr. Wilbur grew up in San Francisco, where he
attended Lowell High School. He entered Stanford
as a student in 1949, the year of President Wilbur's
death, but remembers many afternoons with his
grandfather at the Knoll (the cavernous old
presidential mansion): "Of course, my grandfather
had 22 grandchildren, so we had to have a little
room for everyone to run around."
As an undergraduate, Wilbur majored in child
psychology and taught at the Stanford Village
Nursery School. "I was never treated any
differently, or at least I don't think so, because I
was a member of the Wilbur family."
In fact, his first association with the Children's
Hospital came about because "in the old days, as a
standard punishment, you'd have to come over to
spend a few hours working here. The first thing I
ever did over here was trim hedges."
Largest Amount
During those years, at the beginning of the
Korean War, Wilbur was also involved in a blood

drive which collected over 4000 units in a single
week, "the largest amount of blood collected in
such a short time, anywhere."
Wilbur decided on a medical career in his senior
year because "if I wanted to work with children, the
best way, the most helpful way, was to work as a
physician."
After graduating from Stanford Medical School,
Wilbur spent two years at the Children's Hospital in
Boston, where he was trained by Dr. Sidney Farber,
a pioneer in chemotherapy treatment of cancer in
children.
Pediatric Program
Returning to Stanford Hospital, Wilbur
completed his residency and joined the hospital
faculty. During that period he participated in the
University-Children's Hospital joint pediatric
program.
Wilbur explained that although the two hospitals
have separate corporate structures, they share
faculty and resources. "For example, diagnostic
X-ray is done here for most studies, but the
diagnostic radiologist is a Stanford radiologist."
The two hospitals are working toward a common
medical record, and in general, "it's a separate
institution, but very closely related to the Stanford
institution." However, the Children's Hospital —
located on Willow Road across the street from the
Stanford Hospital — looks to the public for support
to continue services, and funds are provided by its
Bay Area auxiliaries, endowments, public funds, and
major gifts.

In 1968, Wilbur began work at the M.D.
Anderson Hospital of the University of Texas at
Houston, the largest in patient service for children
with cancer in the country.
Cancer In Children
He explained that "cancer in children is not a real
common disease, and yet it causes more deaths in
children than any other disease. Most of the diseases
which used to cause deaths in children don't occur
anymore — they are handled by antibiotics."
Leukemia is the most common form of cancer in
children.
At Anderson, Wilbur helped develop a broad
approach to the treatment of cancer in children,
emphasizing both care and treatment: "Our primary
concern is to take care of children and to provide
them with the best possible care. But the only way
you can really do this is to do research — almost
every patient we treat is on some type of research
study program.
"In general, we don't use routine therapy that
everyone else uses. We're using therapy that we
think offers something more than what was
previously used. For example, if a patient has a
tumor which in the past has been fatal, we would
not use any therapy which in the past has routinely
failed. There's no point in that."
Goal: Normal Lifestyle
Wilbur explained that combinations of drugs and
radiotherapy are used "in an attempt to thoroughly
eradicate the disease. It's our goal in every patient

when we start to see if we can't remove the disease
totally and return the child to a completely normal
lifestyle.
"I think that's different from most places
because there are some people who will say 'there
are some things we can treat and other things we
can't treat' and they just try and make the patient
better for a period of time. That's just not our goal.
Our goal is to completely eradicate the disease."
An important aspect of treatment is the
"parent share "program which Wilbur has introduced
at the Children's Hospital. In it, the nature of the
disease and the effects of the treatment are

explained to the parents and the child in order to
establish "an honest, mutually trusting approach
between the physician and the parent and patient."
The program "is organized so that the parent or
parent-substitute can live at the child's bedside and
actively participate in all phases of the child's care,
even when he is seriously ill."
For example, cooking facilities are provided so
that parents can prepare familiar home meals if their
child is unaccustomed to the hospital menu. Wilbur
further explained that developing an atmosphere of
reassurrance allows children to leave the hospital
earlier, and reenter a more normal life.
To continue with research, Wilbur said, the
laboratory and clinical staff will be expanded, and

limited volunteer program has been organized.
Eventually, Wilbur hopes to expand the parent-share
program to decrease the cost and time of treatment
at the cancer unit.
With "motel" living units built at the hospital, a
child could live with his family, enjoying full
hospital services without undergoing costly full
hospitalization.
Despite the scope of services at the Children's
Hospital, it will never turn away a patient because
of lack of ability to pay, said Wilbur. Public
programs like the Crippled Children's Service help
to meet expenses, and the family may subsequently
pay a portion of the hospital expenses, in relation t r
the ability to pay.

drive which collected over 4000 units in a single
week, "the largest amount of blood collected in
such a short time, anywhere."
Wilbur decided on a medical career in his senior
year because "if I wanted to work with children, the
best way, the most helpful way, was to work as a
physician."
After graduating from Stanford Medical School,
Wilbur spent two years at the Children's Hospital in
Boston, where he was trained by Dr. Sidney Farber,
a pioneer in chemotherapy treatment of cancer in
children.
Pediatric Program
Returning to Stanford Hospital, Wilbur
completed his residency and joined the hospital
faculty. During that period he participated in the
University-Children's Hospital joint pediatric
program.
Wilbur explained that although the two hospitals
have separate corporate structures, they share
faculty and resources. "For example, diagnostic
X-ray is done here for most studies, but the
diagnostic radiologist is a Stanford radiologist."
The two hospitals are working toward a common
medical record, and in general, "it's a separate
institution, but very closely related to the Stanford
institution." However, the Children's Hospital —
located on Willow Road across the street from the
Stanford Hospital — looks to the public for support
to continue services, and funds are provided by its
Bay Area auxiliaries, endowments, public funds, and
major gifts.

In 1968, Wilbur began work at the M.D.
Anderson Hospital of the University of Texas at
Houston, the largest in patient service for children
with cancer in the country.
Cancer In Children
He explained that "cancer in children is not a real
common disease, and yet it causes more deaths in
children than any other disease. Most of the diseases
which used to cause deaths in children don't occur
anymore — they are handled by antibiotics."
Leukemia is the most common form of cancer in
children.
At Anderson, Wilbur helped develop a broad
approach to the treatment of cancer in children,
emphasizing both care and treatment: "Our primary
concern is to take care of children and to provide
them with the best possible care. But the only way
you can really do this is to do research — almost
every patient we treat is on some type of research
study program.
"In general, we don't use routine therapy that
everyone else uses. We're using therapy that we
think offers something more than what was
previously used. For example, if a patient has a
tumor which in the past has been fatal, we would
not use any therapy which in the past has routinely
failed. There's no point in that."
Goal: Normal Lifestyle
Wilbur explained that combinations of drugs and
radiotherapy are used "in an attempt to thoroughly
eradicate the disease. It's our goal in every patient

when we start to see if we can't remove the disease
totally and return the child to a completely normal
lifestyle.
"I think that's different from most places
because there are some people who will say 'there
are some things we can treat and other things we
can't treat' and they just try and make the patient
better for a period of time. That's just not our goal.
Our goal is to completely eradicate the disease."
An important aspect of treatment is the
"parent share "program which Wilbur has introduced
at the Children's Hospital. In it, the nature of the
disease and the effects of the treatment are

explained to the parents and the child in order to
establish "an honest, mutually trusting approach
between the physician and the parent and patient."
The program "is organized so that the parent or
parent-substitute can live at the child's bedside and
actively participate in all phases of the child's care,
even when he is seriously ill."
For example, cooking facilities are provided so
that parents can prepare familiar home meals if their
child is unaccustomed to the hospital menu. Wilbur
further explained that developing an atmosphere of
reassurrance allows children to leave the hospital
earlier, and reenter a more normal life.
To continue with research, Wilbur said, the
laboratory and clinical staff will be expanded, and

limited volunteer program has been organized.
Eventually, Wilbur hopes to expand the parent-share
program to decrease the cost and time of treatment
at the cancer unit.
With "motel" living units built at the hospital, a
child could live with his family, enjoying full
hospital services without undergoing costly full
hospitalization.
Despite the scope of services at the Children's
Hospital, it will never turn away a patient because
of lack of ability to pay, said Wilbur. Public
programs like the Crippled Children's Service help
to meet expenses, and the family may subsequently
pay a portion of the hospital expenses, in relation t r
the ability to pay.
With the opening of the Oncology Unit of the
Children's Hospital at Stanford this fall, a venerable
name in University history has returned to campus.
Dr. Jordan R. Wilbur, grandson of Ray Lyman
Wilbur, University president (1916-1943), and
director of the Children's Oncology Unit, discussed
memories of his famous grandfather, his association
with the campus, and his work at the Children's
Hospital.
Dr. Wilbur grew up in San Francisco, where he
attended Lowell High School. He entered Stanford
as a student in 1949, the year of President Wilbur's
death, but remembers many afternoons with his
grandfather at the Knoll (the cavernous old
presidential mansion): "Of course, my grandfather
had 22 grandchildren, so we had to have a little
room for everyone to run around."
As an undergraduate, Wilbur majored in child
psychology and taught at the Stanford Village
Nursery School. "I was never treated any
differently, or at least I don't think so, because I
was a member of the Wilbur family."
In fact, his first association with the Children's
Hospital came about because "in the old days, as a
standard punishment, you'd have to come over to
spend a few hours working here. The first thing I
ever did over here was trim hedges."

Houston, the largest in patient service for children
with cancer in the country.
Cancer In Children
He explained that "cancer in children is not a real
common disease, and yet it causes more deaths in
children than any other disease. Most of the diseases
which used to cause deaths in children don't occur
anymore — they are handled by antibiotics."
Leukemia is the most common form of cancer in
children.
At Anderson, Wilbur helped develop a broad
approach to the treatment of cancer in children,
emphasizing both care and treatment: "Our primary
concern is to take care of children and to provide
them with the best possible care. But the only way
you can really do this is to do research — almost
every patient we treat is on some type of research
study program.
"In general, we don't use routine therapy that
everyone else uses. We're using therapy that we
think offers something more than what was
previously used. For example, if a patient has a
tumor which in the past has been fatal, we would
not use any therapy which in the past has routinely
failed. There's no point in that."
Goal: Normal Lifestyle
Wilbur explained that combinations of drugs and
radiotherapy are used "in an attempt to thoroughly
eradicate the disease. It's our goal in every patient

when we start to see if we can't remove the disease
totally and return the child to a completely normal
lifestyle.
"I think that's different from most places
because there are some people who will say 'there
are some things we can treat and other things we
can't treat' and they just try and make the patient
better for a period of time. That's just not our goal.
Our goal is to completely eradicate the disease."
An important aspect of treatment is the
"parent share "program which Wilbur has introduced
at the Children's Hospital. In it, the nature of the
disease and the effects of the treatment are

explained to the parents and the child in order to
establish "an honest, mutually trusting approach
between the physician and the parent and patient."
The program "is organized so that the parent or
parent-substitute can live at the child's bedside and
actively participate in all phases of the child's care,
even when he is seriously ill."
For example, cooking facilities are provided so
that parents can prepare familiar home meals if their
child is unaccustomed to the hospital menu. Wilbur
further explained that developing an atmosphere of
reassurrance allows children to leave the hospital
earlier, and reenter a more normal life.
To continue with research, Wilbur said, the
laboratory and clinical staff will be expanded, and

limited volunteer program has been organized.
Eventually, Wilbur hopes to expand the parent-share
program to decrease the cost and time of treatment
at the cancer unit.
With "motel" living units built at the hospital, a
child could live with his family, enjoying full
hospital services without undergoing costly full
hospitalization.
Despite the scope of services at the Children's
Hospital, it will never turn away a patient because
of lack of ability to pay, said Wilbur. Public
programs like the Crippled Children's Service help
to meet expenses, and the family may subsequently
pay a portion of the hospital expenses, in relation t r
the ability to pay.
With the opening of the Oncology Unit of the
Children's Hospital at Stanford this fall, a venerable
name in University history has returned to campus.
Dr. Jordan R. Wilbur, grandson of Ray Lyman
Wilbur, University president (1916-1943), and
director of the Children's Oncology Unit, discussed
memories of his famous grandfather, his association
with the campus, and his work at the Children's
Hospital.
Dr. Wilbur grew up in San Francisco, where he
attended Lowell High School. He entered Stanford
as a student in 1949, the year of President Wilbur's
death, but remembers many afternoons with his
grandfather at the Knoll (the cavernous old
presidential mansion): "Of course, my grandfather
had 22 grandchildren, so we had to have a little
room for everyone to run around."
As an undergraduate, Wilbur majored in child
psychology and taught at the Stanford Village
Nursery School. "I was never treated any
differently, or at least I don't think so, because I
was a member of the Wilbur family."
In fact, his first association with the Children's
Hospital came about because "in the old days, as a
standard punishment, you'd have to come over to
spend a few hours working here. The first thing I
ever did over here was trim hedges."
Largest Amount
During those years, at the beginning of the
Korean War, Wilbur was also involved in a blood

drive which collected over 4000 units in a single
week, "the largest amount of blood collected in
such a short time, anywhere."
Wilbur decided on a medical career in his senior
year because "if I wanted to work with children, the
best way, the most helpful way, was to work as a
physician."
After graduating from Stanford Medical School,
Wilbur spent two years at the Children's Hospital in
Boston, where he was trained by Dr. Sidney Farber,
a pioneer in chemotherapy treatment of cancer in
children.
Pediatric Program
Returning to Stanford Hospital, Wilbur
completed his residency and joined the hospital
faculty. During that period he participated in the
University-Children's Hospital joint pediatric
program.
Wilbur explained that although the two hospitals
have separate corporate structures, they share
faculty and resources. "For example, diagnostic
X-ray is done here for most studies, but the
diagnostic radiologist is a Stanford radiologist."
The two hospitals are working toward a common
medical record, and in general, "it's a separate
institution, but very closely related to the Stanford
institution." However, the Children's Hospital —
located on Willow Road across the street from the
Stanford Hospital — looks to the public for support
to continue services, and funds are provided by its
Bay Area auxiliaries, endowments, public funds, and
major gifts.

In 1968, Wilbur began work at the M.D.
Anderson Hospital of the University of Texas at
Houston, the largest in patient service for children
with cancer in the country.
