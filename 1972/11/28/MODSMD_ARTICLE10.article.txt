Letter To The
Sansei At Stanford
You'll have to agree with me.
There's no possibility of
"revolution" by our people at
Stanford. Revolution now is both
an impossible and impractical way
of doing things here.
What we need now, is an
identification with our situation.
Identification means a definition
of ourselves and an addressing of
ourselves to the Stanford
Community. This has never been
done. And because we have
neglected to do so, our
community has been unable to
communicate within itself and
with the other communities at
Stanford.
Tho we are the smallest
minority, we are the least solid
minority. I find myself just not
knowing how to approach another
Sansei on campus, and not

because we have no common
interests. Rather, it's because I
don't really know what interests
we have. This situation not only
leaves us powerless, it invites
exploitation and domination by
other cultural communities.
Unless we begin steps towards
identification, we shall remain
carelessly open to the interests of
others.
I say, "identification thru
resolution," first. We must find
the time to meet and draft a
resolution which will address the
Stanford Community. This
resolution will define our interests
and our direction as a group.
I'm tired of bein' labeled
this-and-that kind of minority
group. I believe bein' Sansei
should bring more benefits than it
presently does.
I end with a poem; and hope it
will serve as the initial remark in a
dialogue towards resolution.
