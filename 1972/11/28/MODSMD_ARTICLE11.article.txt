IT WAS
MY FACE IN THE MIRROR
Yesterday, I caught
myself kneading. It
wouldn't have bothered
me, except it was
my face being pressed
by my own hands. And
Ever since, I haven't been able
to decide
whether it was
just another practical joke
Or whether my own mirror
had finally accepted it all
as puffed and swole.
