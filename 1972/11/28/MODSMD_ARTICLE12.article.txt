# anti-abortion columns 'ludicrous'
## Abortion Forum 'Not Balanced' 
### 
donn dimichele

I would like to register a
complaint concerning the fairness
of the "Abortion Forum (Daily,
Nov. 17). It looked from first
glance at the headlines of the four
stories included that there was an
equal balance of opinion, that is,
two articles attacking abortion
and two defending it.
Upon reading the articles that
were supposedly against abortion,
however, one gets the impression
that these were actually planted
by pro-abortionists to weaken the
anti-abortion movement by
making it appear ludicrous. I refer
to those would-be realists, Mr.
Garvin and Mr. Swendsen.
First, Mr. Garvin puts the issue
on a "realistic" plane by
subjecting it to piercing legal
analysis. Sexual intercourse is
suddenly a "contract" into which
a woman enters by deciding to
make love. Apparently, passion no
longer has anything to do with it.
It is notable that Mr. Garvin
makes no mention of the other
"party to the contract," the male
partner in procreation.
Responsibility
Apparently, Mr. Garvin sees
the responsibility for pregnancy as

exclusively female, reflecting
either questionable logic or lack
of sexual information. It's a little
bit like saying that every time Mr.
Garvin writes a story, he enters
into a contract with anyone who
may take exception to his story,
and if I decide to throw Mr.
Garvin out the window, it is not
my responsibility to pay the
medical bills, but his own, since
he accepted the risk by writing
the story in the first place.
Mr. Garvin later wonders if
"nine months of inconvenience"
is worth the life of the child borne
by a rape victim. Assuming that
the mother does not keep the
child after giving birth, we could
ask Mr. Garvin if his personal
moral outrage is worth the years
of "inconvenience" to that
unwanted child in orphanages,
reform school, and perhaps
prison, where Mr. Garvin will
probably be waiting with the gas
chamber. Obviously, the view
makes no more sense than Mr.
Garvin's "contractual" view of
sexual intercourse does. But then,
Mr. Garvin is not a law student, as
Mr. Swendsen is.
Mr. Swendsen's article,
accordingly, contains even more
pseudo-realism. He seems to
believe that since a camera only
records actual facts, the mere act
of his showing me movies of
abortions in action constitutes
rational proof of abortion's
immorality. He rejects charges
that these "audio-visual aids" rely
on emotional appeal, because "the
camera does not lie."
Silent Camera
I shall go Mr. Swendsen one
better. The camera does not even
talk. It doesn't argue one way or
the other. No matter how many
movies of maimed fetuses Mr.
Swendsen shows me, he will not
convince me to support him, any
more than I could change his
views by showing him pictures of
women who died from
do-it-yourself or quack abortions
because "pro-lifers" denied them
legal, safe abortions.
No, Mr. Swendsen's home
movies won't convince me,
although they may have an
emotional effect on me, since, like
most people, I have a negative
reaction to excessive camage, a
fact which Mr. Swendsen seems to
want to overlook. But I will do
my best not to be influenced by
emotional appeals.
'Platitudinous Nonsense'
If Mr. Swendsen could come
up with a rational line of

argument, I might believe him,
but instead, he offers such
platitudinous nonsense as "the
only possible solution to the
problem of unwanted and unloved
children is to want them and to
love them, and beyond that
solution there is no other."
While Mr. Swendsen is at it, he
may as well solve our other social
problems too: "The only solution
to poverty and hunger is wealth

and nutrition. The only solution
to racism is brotherhood" . . . etc.
Do not be surprised if, in about
three years, you enter a
courtroom and hear a supremely
rational, unemotional voice
intoning, "Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury, the only possible
solution to crime is obedience to
the law, and beyond that . .

"party to the contract," the male
partner in procreation.
Responsibility
Apparently, Mr. Garvin sees
the responsibility for pregnancy as

exclusively female, reflecting
either questionable logic or lack
of sexual information. It's a little
bit like saying that every time Mr.
Garvin writes a story, he enters
into a contract with anyone who
may take exception to his story,
and if I decide to throw Mr.
Garvin out the window, it is not
my responsibility to pay the
medical bills, but his own, since
he accepted the risk by writing
the story in the first place.
Mr. Garvin later wonders if
"nine months of inconvenience"
is worth the life of the child borne
by a rape victim. Assuming that
the mother does not keep the
child after giving birth, we could
ask Mr. Garvin if his personal
moral outrage is worth the years
of "inconvenience" to that
unwanted child in orphanages,
reform school, and perhaps
prison, where Mr. Garvin will
probably be waiting with the gas
chamber. Obviously, the view
makes no more sense than Mr.
Garvin's "contractual" view of
sexual intercourse does. But then,
Mr. Garvin is not a law student, as
Mr. Swendsen is.
Mr. Swendsen's article,
accordingly, contains even more
pseudo-realism. He seems to
believe that since a camera only
records actual facts, the mere act
of his showing me movies of
abortions in action constitutes
rational proof of abortion's
immorality. He rejects charges
that these "audio-visual aids" rely
on emotional appeal, because "the
camera does not lie."
Silent Camera
I shall go Mr. Swendsen one
better. The camera does not even
talk. It doesn't argue one way or
the other. No matter how many
movies of maimed fetuses Mr.
Swendsen shows me, he will not
convince me to support him, any
more than I could change his
views by showing him pictures of
women who died from
do-it-yourself or quack abortions
because "pro-lifers" denied them
legal, safe abortions.
No, Mr. Swendsen's home
movies won't convince me,
although they may have an
emotional effect on me, since, like
most people, I have a negative
reaction to excessive camage, a
fact which Mr. Swendsen seems to
want to overlook. But I will do
my best not to be influenced by
emotional appeals.
'Platitudinous Nonsense'
If Mr. Swendsen could come
up with a rational line of

argument, I might believe him,
but instead, he offers such
platitudinous nonsense as "the
only possible solution to the
problem of unwanted and unloved
children is to want them and to
love them, and beyond that
solution there is no other."
While Mr. Swendsen is at it, he
may as well solve our other social
problems too: "The only solution
to poverty and hunger is wealth

and nutrition. The only solution
to racism is brotherhood" . . . etc.
Do not be surprised if, in about
three years, you enter a
courtroom and hear a supremely
rational, unemotional voice
intoning, "Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury, the only possible
solution to crime is obedience to
the law, and beyond that . .

I would like to register a
complaint concerning the fairness
of the "Abortion Forum (Daily,
Nov. 17). It looked from first
glance at the headlines of the four
stories included that there was an
equal balance of opinion, that is,
two articles attacking abortion
and two defending it.
Upon reading the articles that
were supposedly against abortion,
however, one gets the impression
that these were actually planted
by pro-abortionists to weaken the
anti-abortion movement by
making it appear ludicrous. I refer
to those would-be realists, Mr.
Garvin and Mr. Swendsen.
First, Mr. Garvin puts the issue
on a "realistic" plane by
subjecting it to piercing legal
analysis. Sexual intercourse is
suddenly a "contract" into which
a woman enters by deciding to
make love. Apparently, passion no
longer has anything to do with it.
It is notable that Mr. Garvin
makes no mention of the other
"party to the contract," the male
partner in procreation.
