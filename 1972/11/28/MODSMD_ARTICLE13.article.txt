## Last Column Of The Year 
### 
Chris hocker

Having written a column every
week, except one, since the
beginning of the quarter, I'm
starting to feel like a
battle-scarred veteran of the great
War of Polemics. After all, there
have been a grand total of four
letters to the Daily commenting
on my articles, and they have all
been generally unanimous in their
opinion. One said I was inane, one
said I was absurd, and the third
said I was inane. Or maybe the
second said I was inane and the
third said I was absurd. I get them
all mixed up.
Apart from the written
comments, I get unsolicited oral
opinions from time to time. While
some of them are of the "How do
you keep writing that crap?"
variety, the most frequent are
distinguished more by what is left
unsaid than by what is actually
put into words.
For instance, I was talking with
a professor of my acquaintance a
few weeks ago, and toward the
end of the conversation he said,
"Oh, I've been reading your
articles in the Daily." I said
something encouraging like, "Oh,
really," expecting something more
from him. Instead, he finished,
"Well, I have to be going," and
went on his way. The net effect
was the same as if he had said,
"There was a dead rat in my living
room this morning." What else is
there to add?
No Tirade
Anyway, you are no doubt
expecting some sort of tirade
about how hard it is to express
unliberal (illiberal?) views on this
campus, and how no one
appreciates me, and how unfair
the world is, and how my friends

and I have become academic
lepers, and how patriotism is on
the wane. However, since you
already know that, and I certainly
know that, I don't think I'll
bother with it.
Instead, I think I'll write about
a subject that is very near and
dear to my heart: Political trivia.
For instance, everyone knows
that Ronald Reagan beat Edmund
Brown for Governor of California
in 1966. And most people
remember that Brown beat
Richard Nixon in 1962. But does
anyone know who Brown
defeated originally in 1958?
Okay, okay, that's an easy one.
William F. Knowland, the
publisher of the Oakland Tribune
and former Minority Leader of
the U.S. Senate.
Japanese Internment
Who was the Governor of
California who authorized the
internment of the Japanese in
camps during World War II? Who
was the U.S. Attorney General
who approved the action?
Earl Warren and Tom Clark,
respectively. Look them up in
your Encyclopedia of
Distinguished Liberal Jurists. Tom
Clark also happens to be Ramsey
Clark's father.
Another one on California
politics: Can you name the last
four men to occupy the Senate
seat now held by John Tunney?
(Knowland, Clair Engel, Pierre
Salinger, and George Murphy.)
Whom did Salinger defeat in the
1964 Democratic primary? (Alan
Cranston.)
Moving right along, most of

you are aware that Robert Byrd
of West Virginia is the Senate
Majority Whip, and you probably
remember that he defeated Teddy
Kennedy for the job. Who was
defeated by Kennedy two years
before that? (Russell Long of
Louisiana.)
Correct Line
A few years ago, everyone who
had the Correct Line knew who
the two Senators were who voted
against the Gulf of Tonkin
Resolution (Wayne Morse and
Ernest Gruening). Morse just lost
to Mark Hatfield, who replaced
the third-to-last woman to sit in
the Senate, whose name
was. .. (Maurine Neuberger). The
other two were Margaret Chase
Smith and .. . (the wife of
Louisiana Governor Edwin
Edwards, whose first name
escapes me at the moment. Yes,
that's the Governor Edwards, and
that's the closest I'm going to
come to a relevant issue in this
column).
I could go on like this forever
— doesn't time fly when you're
having fun? — but time and space
won't allow it. Next year, I'll
return to my pontificating
pomposities. But I'll leave you
with these unanswered questions:
Who finished third in the 1960
Presidential race?
And, as a tiebreaker, whom did
Teddy Kennedy defeat in 1962
when he won election to the U.S.
Senate?
No fair checking your
Almanac. The winner's name will
be printed in italics in my next
column.
(Chris Hocker is inane.)
