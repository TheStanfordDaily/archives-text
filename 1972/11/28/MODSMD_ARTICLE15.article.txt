What is that big antenna on the hills behind Stanford? D.B.
There are actually many antennas up in the hill, but the biggest is
the 150 foot steerable parabolic dish. This antenna is operated by the
Center for Radar Astronomy, which is run jointly by Stanford and the
Stanford Research Institute.
The dish is used by the center to study solar wind in conjunction
with the pioneer spacecraft, to map the moon in conjunction with the
Apollo program, in various other projects.
The dish was the largest of its kind when built eight years ago, but
has since been outclassed. Originally paid for by the Air Force at a
cost of $1 million, it has since been used mostly by NASA.
Recently, however, the dish has run out of things to do. Up to
1970 the dish ran up to 60 hours a week, but now it rarely reaches
about 30 hours a month. In fact, the dish is available to anyone with a
legitimate project for $45 an hour. If interested, call extension 3536.

Why is it that the University can continue to raise tuition fees in
spite of Nixon's wage-price freeze? P.B.
This University along with all others received a special exemption
from the price freeze. The rational was basically that the Universities
would all go broke if they did not get the exemption.

Where can I get a golf cart to get around with. I broke my leg. J. W.
The University health service provides the carts. To get one call
Mrs. Allene Lueck at extension 4841. This year there are 10 carts
available, twice the number available last year, so that so far this year
there hasn't been any problem getting one.
After Christmas vacation, however, when all the skiers return there
will not be enough to go around. At that time students will be put on
a first come, first serve waiting list.
The basic charge for a cart is nine dollars service charge, but
students will be billed for the repairs if the cart is wrecked. The carts
cannot be paid for with insurance.

Bug Me, a regular column in the Daily answers questions
concerning the University, how to deal with the Stanford
bureaucracy, Daily stories, local or national issues, personal or
professional problems. Basically, the idea is to provide a regular
department through which the Daily can function as an advocate for
its readers. Address inquiries to Bug Me, The Stanford Daily, Storke
Student Ihiblications Building, Stanford, California, 94305; or bring
them by the Daily offices at the corner of Panama and Lomita streets.

the 150 foot steerable parabolic dish. This antenna is operated by the
Center for Radar Astronomy, which is run jointly by Stanford and the
Stanford Research Institute.
The dish is used by the center to study solar wind in conjunction
with the pioneer spacecraft, to map the moon in conjunction with the
Apollo program, in various other projects.
The dish was the largest of its kind when built eight years ago, but
has since been outclassed. Originally paid for by the Air Force at a
cost of $1 million, it has since been used mostly by NASA.
Recently, however, the dish has run out of things to do. Up to
1970 the dish ran up to 60 hours a week, but now it rarely reaches
about 30 hours a month. In fact, the dish is available to anyone with a
legitimate project for $45 an hour. If interested, call extension 3536.

Why is it that the University can continue to raise tuition fees in
spite of Nixon's wage-price freeze? P.B.
This University along with all others received a special exemption
from the price freeze. The rational was basically that the Universities
would all go broke if they did not get the exemption.

Where can I get a golf cart to get around with. I broke my leg. J. W.
The University health service provides the carts. To get one call
Mrs. Allene Lueck at extension 4841. This year there are 10 carts
available, twice the number available last year, so that so far this year
there hasn't been any problem getting one.
After Christmas vacation, however, when all the skiers return there
will not be enough to go around. At that time students will be put on
a first come, first serve waiting list.
The basic charge for a cart is nine dollars service charge, but
students will be billed for the repairs if the cart is wrecked. The carts
cannot be paid for with insurance.

Bug Me, a regular column in the Daily answers questions
concerning the University, how to deal with the Stanford
bureaucracy, Daily stories, local or national issues, personal or
professional problems. Basically, the idea is to provide a regular
department through which the Daily can function as an advocate for
its readers. Address inquiries to Bug Me, The Stanford Daily, Storke
Student Ihiblications Building, Stanford, California, 94305; or bring
them by the Daily offices at the corner of Panama and Lomita streets.
Only initials will be used.
