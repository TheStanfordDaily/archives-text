## Med School Mends Scars From War 
### 
For many veterans of the
Vietnamese war, the return home
has been marred by the prospect
of learning to live with a
grotesque facial deformity caused
by war wounds.
Hundreds of these veterans —
as well as many others who have
similar disfigurements resulting
from cancer, birth defects, and
automobile accidents — are being
surgically rehabilitated through a
unique program operated by the
School of Medicine and the Palo
Alto Veterans Administration
Hospital.
The goal of the program, says
its director, Dr. Donald R. Laub,
is to improve not only the
appearance of these patients, but
also their self-concept and
psychological approach to life.
"This is by no means strictly a
cosmetic thing," says Laub, head
of the division of plastic and
reconstructive surgery. "It's a very
valid way of changing a person's
life for the better."
Patients have been referred to
Stanford and the VA Hospital
from throughout the western U.S.
and all over the world since the
program began about five years
ago. They usually require one or
more of three services: silicone
implants for facial or cranial
defects; artificial eyes; and
external anatomical restorations
such as artificial ears, noses and
breasts.
The program was initiated in
the late 1960's in response to the
great increase in the number of
veterans returning from Vietnam
with facial disfigurement. This
increase was caused, Laub says, by
the advent of high velocity rifles
which increased the wounding
power of hand weapons, and by
the development of rapid
helicopter evacuation which saved
the lives of many wounded
soldiers.
"Fortunately, over the past
few years, the number of such
injuries in Vietnam has dropped
considerably," Laub says.
"However, the services we provide

also have good application for
deformities caused by auto
crashes, certain congenital defects,
and surgical treatment of cancer."
For these patients, Laub says,
surgical rehabilitation usually has
a very beneficial effect on the
psychological impairment which
accompanies facial disfigurement.
"Self-image has a direct bearing
on a patient's social and
educational development," he
says. "In countless cases, we've
noticed just a fantastic
improvement in a patient's entire
outlook and approach to life once
his appearance has been restored
to normal."
The implants and artificial
facial parts used in the program
are created by anaplastologist
Walter Spohn of Stanford's
division of plastic and
reconstructive surgery. Spohn,
who recently launched the first
anaplastology training program in
the world at Stanford, was
formerly head of the anatomical
restorations clinic at the San
Francisco VA Hospital for 25
years.
Since he was trained as an
anaplastologist in Germany 30
years ago, Spohn has created
thousands of artificial eyes. While
at the San Francisco VA in the
late 1940'5, he developed the
fast-curing one-day process for
making artifical eyes which is still
utilized today.
To create artificial ears or
noses, Spohn uses vinyl which is
tinted to blend with the patient's
skin. The replica is molded to the
size and shape that fits in with the
rest of the anatomy.
Once the organ is completed, it
is attached with the same kind of
glue that is used to fasten false
eyelashes, he says. Patients can go
for seveal days between regluings,
and since the glue is waterproof,
there are almost no restrictions on
bathing or swimming.
Medical grade silicone rubber,
one of the most physiologically
inert substances known, is used to
make the cranial and facial
implants.
'The person's own tissue
would be best, but silicone is a
close second," Laub says. "It's

nonreactive, can be preoperatively
formed to the exact configuration
desired, and is not affected by
temperature change."
Spohn has created over 200
silicone implants for forehead,
cranial and facial defects since
beginning his affiliation with the
program in 1968.
The technique for creating an
implant begins with the making of
a negative impression of the
patient's face by applying dental
alginate reinforced with plaster.
After the hardened moulage is
removed intact, a positive model
of the face is made by filling the

impression with artificial stone.
The defect on the stone model
is corrected by filling it with wax,
and the wax is then used to make
a mold of the defect. Next,
silicone rubber is inserted into the
mold of the defect and shaped to
fit.
'The silicone implant is baked
at 400° C. under 10,000 pounds
of pressure for 10 minutes and
then placed in an air circulating
over for six hours," Spohn says.
"After being carefully washed,
sterilized and autoclaved, it is
ready for implantation."
This technique was developed

over the past 10 years by several
physicians and anaplastologists
working independently, including
Spohn and Dr. Harvey Lash,
clinical assistant professor of
surgery and surgeon at the Palo
Alto Medical Clinic.
The surgical implantation is
performed by Laub and Dr. Lars
Vistnes, assistant professor of
surgery at Stanford and head of
plastic surgery at the VA.
"Surgically, the advantage of
silicone implants is that you have
the model ready to go, and you
know it'll fit," Laub says.
"Additionally, there's a good
blood supply in the cranial area,
so foreign materials can be better
retained."
The surgical technique is
tailored to the operative site and
the condition of the defect, he
says. For a forehead, cranial or
periorbital implant, the incision is
placed away from the implant,
and a large skin flap is fashioned.
The dissection extends down
to the underlying bone
surrounding the defect, and holes
are drilled in the bone. Then the
implant is secured by permanent
wire sutures placed through the
drilled holes, and the flap is
closed.
"The result," Laub says, "is
that the patient's appearance is
restored to normal, or near
normal. Also, in many cases, the
body's natural protection for the
brain and eye is reconstructed."
For many patients, Spohn says,
a silicone implant or artificial
restoration represents a chance to
rejoin society.
"There are a lot of people who
need this work, but they don't
know where to go," he says.
"They're really under 'house
arrest,' so to speak. They're afraid
to go out because they look so
bad.
"Recently, I made a
restoration and an artificial eye
for a young school teacher who
lost her eye when she was five
because of a tumor behind the
eye. When she saw herself in the
mirror, she was so happy she
almost jumped up to the ceiling."

nonreactive, can be preoperatively
formed to the exact configuration
desired, and is not affected by
temperature change."
Spohn has created over 200
silicone implants for forehead,
cranial and facial defects since
beginning his affiliation with the
program in 1968.
The technique for creating an
implant begins with the making of
a negative impression of the
patient's face by applying dental
alginate reinforced with plaster.
After the hardened moulage is
removed intact, a positive model
of the face is made by filling the

impression with artificial stone.
The defect on the stone model
is corrected by filling it with wax,
and the wax is then used to make
a mold of the defect. Next,
silicone rubber is inserted into the
mold of the defect and shaped to
fit.
'The silicone implant is baked
at 400° C. under 10,000 pounds
of pressure for 10 minutes and
then placed in an air circulating
over for six hours," Spohn says.
"After being carefully washed,
sterilized and autoclaved, it is
ready for implantation."
This technique was developed

over the past 10 years by several
physicians and anaplastologists
working independently, including
Spohn and Dr. Harvey Lash,
clinical assistant professor of
surgery and surgeon at the Palo
Alto Medical Clinic.
The surgical implantation is
performed by Laub and Dr. Lars
Vistnes, assistant professor of
surgery at Stanford and head of
plastic surgery at the VA.
"Surgically, the advantage of
silicone implants is that you have
the model ready to go, and you
know it'll fit," Laub says.
"Additionally, there's a good
blood supply in the cranial area,
so foreign materials can be better
retained."
The surgical technique is
tailored to the operative site and
the condition of the defect, he
says. For a forehead, cranial or
periorbital implant, the incision is
placed away from the implant,
and a large skin flap is fashioned.
The dissection extends down
to the underlying bone
surrounding the defect, and holes
are drilled in the bone. Then the
implant is secured by permanent
wire sutures placed through the
drilled holes, and the flap is
closed.
"The result," Laub says, "is
that the patient's appearance is
restored to normal, or near
normal. Also, in many cases, the
body's natural protection for the
brain and eye is reconstructed."
For many patients, Spohn says,
a silicone implant or artificial
restoration represents a chance to
rejoin society.
"There are a lot of people who
need this work, but they don't
know where to go," he says.
"They're really under 'house
arrest,' so to speak. They're afraid
to go out because they look so
bad.
"Recently, I made a
restoration and an artificial eye
for a young school teacher who
lost her eye when she was five
because of a tumor behind the
eye. When she saw herself in the
mirror, she was so happy she
almost jumped up to the ceiling."

FACIAL MOLD — Stanford anaplastologist Walter Spohn applies
dental alignate to make a negative impression of the face of Vietnam
veteran Robert Veal.
For many veterans of the
Vietnamese war, the return home
has been marred by the prospect
of learning to live with a
grotesque facial deformity caused
by war wounds.
Hundreds of these veterans —
as well as many others who have
similar disfigurements resulting
from cancer, birth defects, and
automobile accidents — are being
surgically rehabilitated through a
unique program operated by the
School of Medicine and the Palo
Alto Veterans Administration
Hospital.
The goal of the program, says
its director, Dr. Donald R. Laub,
is to improve not only the
appearance of these patients, but
also their self-concept and
psychological approach to life.
"This is by no means strictly a
cosmetic thing," says Laub, head
of the division of plastic and
reconstructive surgery. "It's a very
valid way of changing a person's
life for the better."
Patients have been referred to
Stanford and the VA Hospital
from throughout the western U.S.
and all over the world since the
program began about five years
ago. They usually require one or
more of three services: silicone
implants for facial or cranial
defects; artificial eyes; and
external anatomical restorations
such as artificial ears, noses and
breasts.
The program was initiated in
the late 1960's in response to the
great increase in the number of
veterans returning from Vietnam
with facial disfigurement. This
increase was caused, Laub says, by
the advent of high velocity rifles
which increased the wounding
power of hand weapons, and by
the development of rapid
helicopter evacuation which saved
the lives of many wounded
soldiers.
"Fortunately, over the past
few years, the number of such
injuries in Vietnam has dropped
considerably," Laub says.
"However, the services we provide

also have good application for
deformities caused by auto
crashes, certain congenital defects,
and surgical treatment of cancer."
For these patients, Laub says,
surgical rehabilitation usually has
a very beneficial effect on the
psychological impairment which
accompanies facial disfigurement.
"Self-image has a direct bearing
on a patient's social and
educational development," he
says. "In countless cases, we've
noticed just a fantastic
improvement in a patient's entire
outlook and approach to life once
his appearance has been restored
to normal."
The implants and artificial
facial parts used in the program
are created by anaplastologist
Walter Spohn of Stanford's
division of plastic and
reconstructive surgery. Spohn,
who recently launched the first
anaplastology training program in
the world at Stanford, was
formerly head of the anatomical
restorations clinic at the San
Francisco VA Hospital for 25
years.
Since he was trained as an
anaplastologist in Germany 30
years ago, Spohn has created
thousands of artificial eyes. While
at the San Francisco VA in the
late 1940'5, he developed the
fast-curing one-day process for
making artifical eyes which is still
utilized today.
To create artificial ears or
noses, Spohn uses vinyl which is
tinted to blend with the patient's
skin. The replica is molded to the
size and shape that fits in with the
rest of the anatomy.
Once the organ is completed, it
is attached with the same kind of
glue that is used to fasten false
eyelashes, he says. Patients can go
for seveal days between regluings,
and since the glue is waterproof,
there are almost no restrictions on
bathing or swimming.
Medical grade silicone rubber,
one of the most physiologically
inert substances known, is used to
make the cranial and facial
implants.
'The person's own tissue
would be best, but silicone is a
close second," Laub says. "It's

nonreactive, can be preoperatively
formed to the exact configuration
desired, and is not affected by
temperature change."

its director, Dr. Donald R. Laub,
is to improve not only the
appearance of these patients, but
also their self-concept and
psychological approach to life.
"This is by no means strictly a
cosmetic thing," says Laub, head
of the division of plastic and
reconstructive surgery. "It's a very
valid way of changing a person's
life for the better."
Patients have been referred to
Stanford and the VA Hospital
from throughout the western U.S.
and all over the world since the
program began about five years
ago. They usually require one or
more of three services: silicone
implants for facial or cranial
defects; artificial eyes; and
external anatomical restorations
such as artificial ears, noses and
breasts.
The program was initiated in
the late 1960's in response to the
great increase in the number of
veterans returning from Vietnam
with facial disfigurement. This
increase was caused, Laub says, by
the advent of high velocity rifles
which increased the wounding
power of hand weapons, and by
the development of rapid
helicopter evacuation which saved
the lives of many wounded
soldiers.
"Fortunately, over the past
few years, the number of such
injuries in Vietnam has dropped
considerably," Laub says.
"However, the services we provide

also have good application for
deformities caused by auto
crashes, certain congenital defects,
and surgical treatment of cancer."
For these patients, Laub says,
surgical rehabilitation usually has
a very beneficial effect on the
psychological impairment which
accompanies facial disfigurement.
"Self-image has a direct bearing
on a patient's social and
educational development," he
says. "In countless cases, we've
noticed just a fantastic
improvement in a patient's entire
outlook and approach to life once
his appearance has been restored
to normal."
The implants and artificial
facial parts used in the program
are created by anaplastologist
Walter Spohn of Stanford's
division of plastic and
reconstructive surgery. Spohn,
who recently launched the first
anaplastology training program in
the world at Stanford, was
formerly head of the anatomical
restorations clinic at the San
Francisco VA Hospital for 25
years.
Since he was trained as an
anaplastologist in Germany 30
years ago, Spohn has created
thousands of artificial eyes. While
at the San Francisco VA in the
late 1940'5, he developed the
fast-curing one-day process for
making artifical eyes which is still
utilized today.
To create artificial ears or
noses, Spohn uses vinyl which is
tinted to blend with the patient's
skin. The replica is molded to the
size and shape that fits in with the
rest of the anatomy.
Once the organ is completed, it
is attached with the same kind of
glue that is used to fasten false
eyelashes, he says. Patients can go
for seveal days between regluings,
and since the glue is waterproof,
there are almost no restrictions on
bathing or swimming.
Medical grade silicone rubber,
one of the most physiologically
inert substances known, is used to
make the cranial and facial
implants.
'The person's own tissue
would be best, but silicone is a
close second," Laub says. "It's

nonreactive, can be preoperatively
formed to the exact configuration
desired, and is not affected by
temperature change."
Spohn has created over 200
silicone implants for forehead,
cranial and facial defects since
beginning his affiliation with the
program in 1968.
The technique for creating an
implant begins with the making of
a negative impression of the
patient's face by applying dental
alginate reinforced with plaster.
After the hardened moulage is
removed intact, a positive model
of the face is made by filling the

impression with artificial stone.
The defect on the stone model
is corrected by filling it with wax,
and the wax is then used to make
a mold of the defect. Next,
silicone rubber is inserted into the
mold of the defect and shaped to
fit.
'The silicone implant is baked
at 400° C. under 10,000 pounds
of pressure for 10 minutes and
then placed in an air circulating
over for six hours," Spohn says.
"After being carefully washed,
sterilized and autoclaved, it is
ready for implantation."
This technique was developed

over the past 10 years by several
physicians and anaplastologists
working independently, including
Spohn and Dr. Harvey Lash,
clinical assistant professor of
surgery and surgeon at the Palo
Alto Medical Clinic.
The surgical implantation is
performed by Laub and Dr. Lars
Vistnes, assistant professor of
surgery at Stanford and head of
plastic surgery at the VA.
"Surgically, the advantage of
silicone implants is that you have
the model ready to go, and you
know it'll fit," Laub says.
"Additionally, there's a good
blood supply in the cranial area,
so foreign materials can be better
retained."
The surgical technique is
tailored to the operative site and
the condition of the defect, he
says. For a forehead, cranial or
periorbital implant, the incision is
placed away from the implant,
and a large skin flap is fashioned.
The dissection extends down
to the underlying bone
surrounding the defect, and holes
are drilled in the bone. Then the
implant is secured by permanent
wire sutures placed through the
drilled holes, and the flap is
closed.
"The result," Laub says, "is
that the patient's appearance is
restored to normal, or near
normal. Also, in many cases, the
body's natural protection for the
brain and eye is reconstructed."
For many patients, Spohn says,
a silicone implant or artificial
restoration represents a chance to
rejoin society.
"There are a lot of people who
need this work, but they don't
know where to go," he says.
"They're really under 'house
arrest,' so to speak. They're afraid
to go out because they look so
bad.
"Recently, I made a
restoration and an artificial eye
for a young school teacher who
lost her eye when she was five
because of a tumor behind the
eye. When she saw herself in the
mirror, she was so happy she
almost jumped up to the ceiling."

of the face is made by filling the

impression with artificial stone.
The defect on the stone model
is corrected by filling it with wax,
and the wax is then used to make
a mold of the defect. Next,
silicone rubber is inserted into the
mold of the defect and shaped to
fit.
'The silicone implant is baked
at 400° C. under 10,000 pounds
of pressure for 10 minutes and
then placed in an air circulating
over for six hours," Spohn says.
"After being carefully washed,
sterilized and autoclaved, it is
ready for implantation."
This technique was developed

over the past 10 years by several
physicians and anaplastologists
working independently, including
Spohn and Dr. Harvey Lash,
clinical assistant professor of
surgery and surgeon at the Palo
Alto Medical Clinic.
The surgical implantation is
performed by Laub and Dr. Lars
Vistnes, assistant professor of
surgery at Stanford and head of
plastic surgery at the VA.
"Surgically, the advantage of
silicone implants is that you have
the model ready to go, and you
know it'll fit," Laub says.
"Additionally, there's a good
blood supply in the cranial area,
so foreign materials can be better
retained."
The surgical technique is
tailored to the operative site and
the condition of the defect, he
says. For a forehead, cranial or
periorbital implant, the incision is
placed away from the implant,
and a large skin flap is fashioned.
The dissection extends down
to the underlying bone
surrounding the defect, and holes
are drilled in the bone. Then the
implant is secured by permanent
wire sutures placed through the
drilled holes, and the flap is
closed.
"The result," Laub says, "is
that the patient's appearance is
restored to normal, or near
normal. Also, in many cases, the
body's natural protection for the
brain and eye is reconstructed."
For many patients, Spohn says,
a silicone implant or artificial
restoration represents a chance to
rejoin society.
"There are a lot of people who
need this work, but they don't
know where to go," he says.
"They're really under 'house
arrest,' so to speak. They're afraid
to go out because they look so
bad.
"Recently, I made a
restoration and an artificial eye
for a young school teacher who
lost her eye when she was five
because of a tumor behind the
eye. When she saw herself in the
mirror, she was so happy she
almost jumped up to the ceiling."
