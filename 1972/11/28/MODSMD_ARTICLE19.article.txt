The programming language
APL, an important addition
to the Stanford Computation
Center services, is now
available at the Campus
Facility. APL is particularly
effective for high-order
mathematics and matrix
algebra applications.
Demonstrations of APL
will be given at the Campus
Facility in the public terminal
area from 10:00 a.m. until
12:00 noon every weekday
until December 1. The
Campus Facility is located in
Pine Hall.
