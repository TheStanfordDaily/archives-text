# Kissinger, President Confer
## Thieu's Rep To Meet With Nixon 
### 
CAMP DAVID, Md. (AP) - President
Nixon conferred twice yesterday with
Henry A. Kissinger on Vietnam peace
talks but the Camp David White House
gave no clue as to what points were
discussed.
Press secretary Ronald L. Ziegler
limited himself to cautioning reporters
anew against drawing pessimistic
conclusions from the current recess in
the Paris talks.
Kissinger, Nixon's assistant for
national security affairs, will fly back
to Paris Sunday to renew talks the
next day with Hanoi negotiator Le
Due Tho.

Nixon has held at least four
meetings with Kissinger since the
negotiator returned from the French
capital Saturday night. Ziegler said
Nixon will meet tomorrow with
Nguyen Phu Due, who is bound here
from Saigon as a special representative
of South Vietnamese President
Nguyen Van Thieu.
Saigon Sought Meeting
The South Vietnamese had sought
the meeting and the White House had
indicated from the outset that there
would be consultations with the
Saigon government following
Kissinger's most recent Paris trip.

Ziegler said Nixon will meet Due
either at Camp David or the White
House.
In Saigon, South Vietnamese
sources reported that the Thieu
government has demanded that North
Vietnam negotiate directly with it
before any breakthrough can be made
at the Paris talks.
Quang Tri Fighting
While Kissinger and Nixon
conferred, South Vietnamese
paratroopers claimed victory yesterday
in fighting to expand their front in the
northernmost province of Quang Tri.
The airborne troops reported killing
31 North Vietnamese with the help of
artillery and air strikes in the third
straight day of sharp action in foothills
southwest of Quang Tri, the provincial
capital. Government losses were put at
one man killed, seven wounded.
The U.S. Command reported six
852 heavy bomber strikes were aimed
at enemy concentrations in the battle
area eight miles southwest of Quang
Tri. It said Navy jets destroyed a truck
and set off six secondary explosions at
a Viet Cong truck park two miles
closer to Quang Tri.
The North Vietnamese had long
contested and controlled large areas of
the mountain sector even before their
invasion March 30 across the DMZ.
The Saigon government insists that
any cease-fire agreement must provide
for North Vietnamese withdrawal and
reestablishment of the DMZ at the
17th Parallel.
While peace talks remained stalled
over that issue, U.S. 852s flew more
than 40 strikes against war supply
buildups in the DMZ and in the
southern panhandle of North Vietnam.

â€¢ Most of the raids were concentrated
along the road that leads from North
Vietnam through the Rathelemy Pass
into the Plain of Jars in Laos. U.S.
officials said Hanoi has launched a
massive resupply effort for its troops
in their annual dry season offensive on
the plain.
