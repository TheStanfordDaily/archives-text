# Mason Wins Competition
## 
### 
James W. Mason, a Stanford
graduate student, won an award in
competition at the International
Institute for Conductors in Monte
Carlo last month, the Music
Department has announced.
Mason was one of three
participants out of 50 who shared
the Burse du Prince, the top
honor awarded at the end of the
five-week institute.
The 50 young conductors in
the institute came from all over
Europe as well as from the U.S.
For three weeks of the
workshop, the students had the
unusual opportunity of
conducting rehearsals of the
professional National Orchestra of
Monte Carlo six hours a day.
In both closed rehearsals and
some that were open to the
public, the students conducted —
from memory — a repertoire
including music of Haydn,
Beethoven, Weber, Tchaikovsky,
Sibelius, Rimsky-Korsakov,
Ginastera, and Bach.
"Conducting everything from
memory makes a tremendous
difference," Mason said, "and the
Monte Carlo orchestra is a typical
French orchestra in one way —
they let you know exactly how

you're doing. If you miss a cue,
they may well stand up in the
middle of the piece and tell you.
And if you do something they
like, they'll also tell you," he
added.
Mason, 27, is a doctoral
student in orchestral conducting.
His teacher is Sandor Salgo,
professor of music and the
University's director of orchestras
and opera.
