# Doc And His Son Give A Fine Show
## 
### DAN FORTE 
On the evening of November 18 at Marin County Veterans'
Memorial Theater, Doc and Merle Watson made their last Bay Area
appearance of 1972.
Doc Watson, who is now 49 years old and has been blind all his
life, is most famous for his grease lightning "double-picking" on
guitar. From his first song, "Sweet Heaven When I Die," the audience
was "oohing and ahing" in amazement over every piece he played.
Watson showed just how fast he could play on instrumentals like
"Alabama Jubilee," "Nothin' To It," "Leather Britches," with Doc's
guitar sounding like a dulcimer in parts, and "Black Mountain Rag,"
which Doc adapted from an old fiddle tune. At the end of "Black
Mountain Rag," after playing some fantastic runs, Doc and Merle
double-timed the last few choruses. The entire audience collectively
dropped its jaw in disbelief.
Doc Watson is perhaps the best folk guitarist alive, and his son,
Merle, isn't too far behind. Merle displayed some beautiful
finger-picking on "Goin' Down This Road Feeling Bad," which
showed the influence of the late Mississippi John Hurt, and "Sitting
On Top of The World," which was originally recorded by the
Mississippi Sheiks.
On their beautiful arrangement of "St. James Infirmary " Merle got
into some contemporary, blues picking, and played some very tasteful
single-note leads. This was also the case on Doc's rendition of
"Summertime," from his latest album, "Elementary Doctor Watson."
On "Rain Crow Bill," an old minstrel piece, Merle played banjo
and Doc played harmonica. Doc usually plays harmonica with a neck
harness (like the one Dylan uses), but on this song he cupped his
hands around the harp, and didn't play guitar. It sounded quite a bit
like Sonny Terry.
As if being such a talented musician wasn't enough, Doc Watson is
also a fine singer. He's got one of those voices that's naturally pretty.
"A-Rovin' On a Winter's Night," a love song adapted from various
English folk songs, was probably the best showcase for Doc's singing.
Explaining how he used to play in an electric country-swing band
for dances, Doc ripped into Elvis Presley's "Treat Me Nice" (I think)
and "Blue Suede Shoes." The predominately young audience loved it.
These were not fiat, empty take-offs, mind you; Doc really got into it.
But, Merle had a hard time playing rhythm on these tunes, because he
was laughing too hard.
Doc also has a great knack for story telling, and made a point to
include one humorous little folk tale per set.
All of the Watson's twenty-seven songs were masterpieces, spanning
country, folk, blues, jazz, and even Elvis Presley. Watson included one
"new song" written by folk singer Townes Van Zandt, called "If I
Needed You."
Other songs which can't go unmentioned were Doc's new single
"Freight Train Boggie," a haunting prison song called "Black Jack
County Train," and a singalong "Wabash Cannonball," which featured
some very nice harp playing.
The show ended with the fast "Train That Carried My Girl From
Town," after which the Watsons came back to play the instrumental
"Hardtimes." Both featured Merle's great banjo picking.
This was the last show Doc and Merle will do in the Bay Area this
year, and I think it was the best show I've seen all year. Doc Watson is
a great guy who happens to be extremely talented. He makes it a
point to be very informal and relaxed on stage, which is appropriate
for the type of music he plays.

"Freight Train Boggie," a haunting prison song called "Black Jack
County Train," and a singalong "Wabash Cannonball," which featured
some very nice harp playing.
The show ended with the fast "Train That Carried My Girl From
Town," after which the Watsons came back to play the instrumental
"Hardtimes." Both featured Merle's great banjo picking.
This was the last show Doc and Merle will do in the Bay Area this
year, and I think it was the best show I've seen all year. Doc Watson is
a great guy who happens to be extremely talented. He makes it a
point to be very informal and relaxed on stage, which is appropriate
for the type of music he plays.
Special Announcement
Alea 11, Stanford's new music ensemble, performs a free concert
tonight at 8 in Dinkelspiel Auditorium. All the music on the program
was composed after 1940. Included are Karlheinz Stockhausen's
"Zyklus," the American premiere of Loren Rush's "Soft Music, Hard
Music," Mauricio Kagel's "Die Himmelsmechanik," two pieces by
John Cage, in honor of his 60th birthday, and the world premiere of a
work by Martin Bresnik, a Stanford lecturer in music.
Guest performers include Bonnie Hampton, the cellist for
Stanford's resident chamber ensemble, the Francesco Trio, who
performs Bresnik's "3 Intermezzi."
On the evening of November 18 at Marin County Veterans'
Memorial Theater, Doc and Merle Watson made their last Bay Area
appearance of 1972.
Doc Watson, who is now 49 years old and has been blind all his
life, is most famous for his grease lightning "double-picking" on
guitar. From his first song, "Sweet Heaven When I Die," the audience
was "oohing and ahing" in amazement over every piece he played.
Watson showed just how fast he could play on instrumentals like
"Alabama Jubilee," "Nothin' To It," "Leather Britches," with Doc's
guitar sounding like a dulcimer in parts, and "Black Mountain Rag,"
which Doc adapted from an old fiddle tune. At the end of "Black
Mountain Rag," after playing some fantastic runs, Doc and Merle
double-timed the last few choruses. The entire audience collectively
dropped its jaw in disbelief.
Doc Watson is perhaps the best folk guitarist alive, and his son,
Merle, isn't too far behind. Merle displayed some beautiful
finger-picking on "Goin' Down This Road Feeling Bad," which
showed the influence of the late Mississippi John Hurt, and "Sitting
On Top of The World," which was originally recorded by the
Mississippi Sheiks.
On their beautiful arrangement of "St. James Infirmary " Merle got
into some contemporary, blues picking, and played some very tasteful
single-note leads. This was also the case on Doc's rendition of
"Summertime," from his latest album, "Elementary Doctor Watson."
On "Rain Crow Bill," an old minstrel piece, Merle played banjo
and Doc played harmonica. Doc usually plays harmonica with a neck
harness (like the one Dylan uses), but on this song he cupped his
hands around the harp, and didn't play guitar. It sounded quite a bit
like Sonny Terry.
As if being such a talented musician wasn't enough, Doc Watson is
also a fine singer. He's got one of those voices that's naturally pretty.
"A-Rovin' On a Winter's Night," a love song adapted from various
English folk songs, was probably the best showcase for Doc's singing.
Explaining how he used to play in an electric country-swing band
for dances, Doc ripped into Elvis Presley's "Treat Me Nice" (I think)
and "Blue Suede Shoes." The predominately young audience loved it.
These were not fiat, empty take-offs, mind you; Doc really got into it.
But, Merle had a hard time playing rhythm on these tunes, because he
was laughing too hard.
Doc also has a great knack for story telling, and made a point to
include one humorous little folk tale per set.
All of the Watson's twenty-seven songs were masterpieces, spanning
country, folk, blues, jazz, and even Elvis Presley. Watson included one
"new song" written by folk singer Townes Van Zandt, called "If I
Needed You."
Other songs which can't go unmentioned were Doc's new single
"Freight Train Boggie," a haunting prison song called "Black Jack
County Train," and a singalong "Wabash Cannonball," which featured
some very nice harp playing.
