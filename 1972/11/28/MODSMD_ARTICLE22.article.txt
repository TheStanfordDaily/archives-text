## Entertainment Schwarzkopf Still Sings With Spirit 
### BRUCE LAMOTT 
Elizabeth Schwarzkopf has no
difficulty living up to her
reputation as a musical legend.
Singing a lieder recital at Flint
Center on Thanksgiving eve, she
satisfied the expectations of her
ardent admirers and made
converts of those hearing her for
the first time. Now in her late
fifties, she is an artist whose age
has colored, but not lessened, the
talents of her youth.
The brooding reflection of
Mozart's Abendempfindung, a
song of evening and death, met
our expectations — and
reservations — of a singer in her
late maturity. The darkly covered
vowels and pathos of her delivery
elicited a personal empathy with
the singer as well as with the poet.
Suddenly casting off this mask
of age, however, Schwarzkopf
caught the audience off-guard
with the delightful enthusiasm of
Meine Wunsche, Mozart's childish
assertion of what he would do if
he were the Kaiser. Any further
maudlin thoughts of 'twilight
years' were promptly dismissed.
The scena Die drei Zigeuner by
Liszt reaffirmed her reputation as
an actress as well as a singer. Her
characterization of three old
gypsies, complemented by the
virtuoso piano scenery of
accompanist Geoffrey Parsons,
effectively conveyed their
bittersweet philosophy of life.
Earthy Interpretation
Stepping out of the confines of
matronly propriety,
Schwarzkopf became a wholly
new kind of gypsy for Hugo
Wolf's Die Zigeunerin. Her
interpretation — for which she is
especially noted — is earthy, sung
with the nasal timbre associated
with the folk-songs of the
Hungarian vagabonds.
Programming this and other works
with such exhausting technical
demands would tax the energies
of many singers twenty years
younger.
The greatest loss evidenced by
her maturity is that of diction.
There is a sameness in her vowel

sounds which is resonant but
indistinguishable. However, her
mastery of facial expression and
precision of consonants
compensates effectively. Her
accuracy of pitch was certain,
although the route of arrival was
questionable at times.
Her command of mood and
characterization never flagged. In
the naughty playfulness of Wolf's
Philine, the charming grace of
Loewe's Kleiner Haushalt, and the
maternal arrogance of
Mutterandelei by Richard Strauss
she bantered with the audience.
But in such as Kennst du das
Land, she could transport the
listener with such intensity that at
the final cadence there was only a
vague memory of when and where
we had begun.
What more could be said than
that accompanist Geoffrey
Parsons and Elizabeth
Schwartkopf deserve one another?
Much of the dramatic impact
came from his intelligent
interpretation of the poetry as
well as the technical command of
the music. The fragile line of the
Strauss song Morgen! displayed
their ensemble even more than the
brilliant passages elsewhere. The
piano prelude and postlude were
so effective, that the ethereal
vocal line entered and finished
without a perceptible alteration of
the musical fabric.
It was indeed 'her' audience
which, in a spirited ovation,
brought Schwarzkopf out for
two hilarious encores by Wolf and
Strauss.

Meine Wunsche, Mozart's childish
assertion of what he would do if
he were the Kaiser. Any further
maudlin thoughts of 'twilight
years' were promptly dismissed.
The scena Die drei Zigeuner by
Liszt reaffirmed her reputation as
an actress as well as a singer. Her
characterization of three old
gypsies, complemented by the
virtuoso piano scenery of
accompanist Geoffrey Parsons,
effectively conveyed their
bittersweet philosophy of life.
Earthy Interpretation
Stepping out of the confines of
matronly propriety,
Schwarzkopf became a wholly
new kind of gypsy for Hugo
Wolf's Die Zigeunerin. Her
interpretation — for which she is
especially noted — is earthy, sung
with the nasal timbre associated
with the folk-songs of the
Hungarian vagabonds.
Programming this and other works
with such exhausting technical
demands would tax the energies
of many singers twenty years
younger.
The greatest loss evidenced by
her maturity is that of diction.
There is a sameness in her vowel

sounds which is resonant but
indistinguishable. However, her
mastery of facial expression and
precision of consonants
compensates effectively. Her
accuracy of pitch was certain,
although the route of arrival was
questionable at times.
Her command of mood and
characterization never flagged. In
the naughty playfulness of Wolf's
Philine, the charming grace of
Loewe's Kleiner Haushalt, and the
maternal arrogance of
Mutterandelei by Richard Strauss
she bantered with the audience.
But in such as Kennst du das
Land, she could transport the
listener with such intensity that at
the final cadence there was only a
vague memory of when and where
we had begun.
What more could be said than
that accompanist Geoffrey
Parsons and Elizabeth
Schwartkopf deserve one another?
Much of the dramatic impact
came from his intelligent
interpretation of the poetry as
well as the technical command of
the music. The fragile line of the
Strauss song Morgen! displayed
their ensemble even more than the
brilliant passages elsewhere. The
piano prelude and postlude were
so effective, that the ethereal
vocal line entered and finished
without a perceptible alteration of
the musical fabric.
It was indeed 'her' audience
which, in a spirited ovation,
brought Schwarzkopf out for
two hilarious encores by Wolf and
Strauss.
Elizabeth Schwarzkopf has no
difficulty living up to her
reputation as a musical legend.
Singing a lieder recital at Flint
Center on Thanksgiving eve, she
satisfied the expectations of her
ardent admirers and made
converts of those hearing her for
the first time. Now in her late
fifties, she is an artist whose age
has colored, but not lessened, the
talents of her youth.
The brooding reflection of
Mozart's Abendempfindung, a
song of evening and death, met
our expectations — and
reservations — of a singer in her
late maturity. The darkly covered
vowels and pathos of her delivery
elicited a personal empathy with
the singer as well as with the poet.
Suddenly casting off this mask
of age, however, Schwarzkopf
caught the audience off-guard
with the delightful enthusiasm of
Meine Wunsche, Mozart's childish
assertion of what he would do if
he were the Kaiser. Any further
maudlin thoughts of 'twilight
