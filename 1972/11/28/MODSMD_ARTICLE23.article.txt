# Drama Dept. Production
## 'Twelfth Night': Pleasurable 
### D. CAROL BAIN 
The Stanford Drama
Department's production of
Shakespeare's "Twelfth Night"
provides a pleasurable evening of
fantasy interlaced with music.
The Renaissance ambiance is
effected in large part by the live
and recorded music performed by
members of the Stanford Music
Department. Costumed musicians
greet the audience with
Traditional Aires in the Memorial
Auditorium foyer.
From the foyer, the audience is
ushered into the Arena Theater
located on the Mem. Aud. stage.
The Arena, with its raised
bleachers arranged in a semicircle,
provides the close proximity
between cast and audience that
serves to enhance the plays intent.
The viewer is thereby treated to a
colorful display of visual delights
— the most obvious being the
sumptuous costumes.
With Duke Orsino's opening
lines, "If music be the food of
love, play on," the musical
fantasy of romance and intrigue
begins.
Mistaken Identities
The plot becomes increasingly
convoluted with mistaken
identities and mistaken passions.
Viola, dressed as the Duke's
gentleman, Cesario, carries a
message of the Duke's affections
to the Countess Olivia. This scene
displays the skills of both Carolyn
Gillespie as Viola and Jan Lipman
as Olivia. The contrast between
the cold, overly dignified Olivia
and the practical, unassuming
Viola is underscored in a lively
display of Elizabethan wit.
The drinking scene was
unfortunately staged with the
principals in a prone position
visible only to the first and last
rows of the audience. However,
the low comedy of Olivia's
disreputable uncle Sir Toby,
stirringly played by Richard Bey
despite occasional lapses into a
W.C. Fields impersonation, and

the witless Sir Andrew, portrayed
with plodding accuracy by Lloyd
Loom, provides a noisy contrast
to the quiet romance of the
preceding scenes.
The undoing of the priggish,
sneering Malvolio is the most
skillfully executed scene in this
production. Malvolio, exceedingly
well drawn by Richard Cordtz,
reads the contrived letter telling
of Olivia's great affection for him.
Hilarious Asides
Cordtz proceeds deftly from
incredulous admirer to attendant
lover, waxing confident with
"Some are born great, some
achieve greatness, and some have
greatness thrust upon them." All
this is spiced with the hilarious
asides of Sir Toby, Sir Andrew,
and Fabian who secretly view the
success of their scheme with
gloating satisfaction.
The subsequent scenes build
intrigue and confusion to a fever
pitch — Cesario longs for the
Duke who loves Olivia who desires
Cesario. And to top it off,
Malvolio declares his love to Olivia
who pronounces him mad and
packs him off to a lunatic asylum.
The actors manage to keep up the
madding pace.
The reappearance of Viola's
supposedly drowned identical
twin Sebastian compounds the
confusion. At this point the
viewer's credulity is stretched to
the breaking point as the
bewildered Sebastian is swept into
marriage with Olivia who has
mistaken him, naturally enough,
for Cesario.

Gathering on stage for the
climax, the cast does a creditable
job of tying up the loose ends.
Brother and sister are reunited, if
not altogether convincingly so.
Lover is united to suitable lover —
the L)uke to Viola, Olivia to
Sebastian. Even Sir Toby "lives
happily ever after" with Olivia's
waiting woman, Maria.
The final summation is aptly
expressed in song to round out
the musical theme of the play.
The Clown Feste, skillfully played
by Michael Gillespie, assures us
that "All's well that ends well"
especially when the primary
intent is to please and delight.
Judging from audience
reaction, the primary intent was
achieved. One woman commented
that she enjoyed the play as much
as any movie. Another remarked
that she couldn't select a favorite
character since all the characters
were equally pleasing. The only
sour note was struck by a man
who added, "I still would have
preferred a John Wayne movie."

preferred a John Wayne movie."
The Stanford Drama
Department's production of
Shakespeare's "Twelfth Night"
provides a pleasurable evening of
fantasy interlaced with music.
The Renaissance ambiance is
effected in large part by the live
and recorded music performed by
members of the Stanford Music
Department. Costumed musicians
greet the audience with
Traditional Aires in the Memorial
Auditorium foyer.
From the foyer, the audience is
ushered into the Arena Theater
located on the Mem. Aud. stage.
The Arena, with its raised
bleachers arranged in a semicircle,
provides the close proximity
between cast and audience that
serves to enhance the plays intent.
The viewer is thereby treated to a
colorful display of visual delights
— the most obvious being the
sumptuous costumes.
With Duke Orsino's opening
lines, "If music be the food of
love, play on," the musical
fantasy of romance and intrigue
begins.
Mistaken Identities
The plot becomes increasingly
convoluted with mistaken
identities and mistaken passions.
Viola, dressed as the Duke's
gentleman, Cesario, carries a
message of the Duke's affections
to the Countess Olivia. This scene
displays the skills of both Carolyn
Gillespie as Viola and Jan Lipman
as Olivia. The contrast between
the cold, overly dignified Olivia
and the practical, unassuming
Viola is underscored in a lively
display of Elizabethan wit.
The drinking scene was
unfortunately staged with the
principals in a prone position
visible only to the first and last
rows of the audience. However,
the low comedy of Olivia's
disreputable uncle Sir Toby,
stirringly played by Richard Bey
despite occasional lapses into a
W.C. Fields impersonation, and

the witless Sir Andrew, portrayed
with plodding accuracy by Lloyd
Loom, provides a noisy contrast
to the quiet romance of the
preceding scenes.
The undoing of the priggish,
sneering Malvolio is the most
skillfully executed scene in this
production. Malvolio, exceedingly
well drawn by Richard Cordtz,
reads the contrived letter telling
of Olivia's great affection for him.
Hilarious Asides
Cordtz proceeds deftly from
incredulous admirer to attendant
lover, waxing confident with
"Some are born great, some
achieve greatness, and some have
greatness thrust upon them." All
this is spiced with the hilarious
asides of Sir Toby, Sir Andrew,
and Fabian who secretly view the
success of their scheme with
gloating satisfaction.
The subsequent scenes build
intrigue and confusion to a fever
pitch — Cesario longs for the
Duke who loves Olivia who desires
Cesario. And to top it off,
Malvolio declares his love to Olivia
who pronounces him mad and
packs him off to a lunatic asylum.
The actors manage to keep up the
madding pace.
The reappearance of Viola's
supposedly drowned identical
twin Sebastian compounds the
confusion. At this point the
viewer's credulity is stretched to
the breaking point as the
bewildered Sebastian is swept into
marriage with Olivia who has
mistaken him, naturally enough,
for Cesario.

Gathering on stage for the
climax, the cast does a creditable
job of tying up the loose ends.
Brother and sister are reunited, if
not altogether convincingly so.
Lover is united to suitable lover —
the L)uke to Viola, Olivia to
Sebastian. Even Sir Toby "lives
happily ever after" with Olivia's
waiting woman, Maria.
The final summation is aptly
expressed in song to round out
the musical theme of the play.
The Clown Feste, skillfully played
by Michael Gillespie, assures us
that "All's well that ends well"
especially when the primary
intent is to please and delight.
Judging from audience
reaction, the primary intent was
achieved. One woman commented
that she enjoyed the play as much
as any movie. Another remarked
that she couldn't select a favorite
character since all the characters
were equally pleasing. The only
sour note was struck by a man
who added, "I still would have
preferred a John Wayne movie."
