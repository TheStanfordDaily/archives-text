Egypt Ready For War
CAIRO — Egypt's premier said yesterday his nation
is ready for war with Israel and has provided its
army with all its needs.
Addressing the People's Assembly in Cairo, Aziz
Sidky said: "The government has given the armed
forces priority over all other sectors in the budget
allocations."
Making his second policy statement since his
appointment as premier last January, Sidky
reiterated Egypt's position of rejecting any partial
settlement in the Middle East, and stressed that
Egypt will not give up a single inch of the lands
occupied by Israel in the 1967 war.
Romney Quits Cabinet Poet
WASHINGTON — Secretary George Romney said
yesterday he will leave the Department of Housing
and Urban Development to create a concerned
citizens' coalition because of what he called the
limitations in the nation's political process.
Romney, 56-year-old former Michigan governor
and head of American Motors, told a news
conference that the greatest need in America "is to
strengthen its voluntary and private aspects
including our political process."
He said the American public must be informed
on the real political issues which he described as
those concerned with "life and death." He said the
real issues were not discussed during President
Nixon's successful race for re-election because both
the President and his Democratic challenger Sen.
George S. McGovern, feared it would cost them
votes to do so.
No New Job For Connally
CAMP DAVID, Md. — President Nixon, promising
to begin announcements of sweeping Cabinet
changes today, ruled out yesterday a new federal
job for his former Treasury secretary, Democrat
John B. Connally.

Talking to a dozen newsmen at his Camp David
retreat, Nixon disclosed also that Secretary of
Defense Melvin R. Laird will leave government
service. Laird had made no secret of his plans to
vacate his Pentagon post but there had been rumors
he was in line for some other high position.
Nixon said that as he works to reorganize the
federal bureaucracy, the biggest personnel cuts will
come in the White House staff.
Saying that his personal entourage should set an
example, he said the White House establishment
"has grown like Topsy."
The chief executive said that many of the
personnel cuts in the White House will be achieved
by assigning what had been White House functions
to members of the Cabinet.
In discussing personnel changes, Nixon disclosed
that Caspar Weinberger, director of the Office of
Management and Budget, will be leaving that post.
However, he said Weinberger will get another top
position.
The President said he hopes to make all
announcements of major personnel changes by Dec.
15.
High School Students Shot
PONTIAC, Mich. — Five Pontiac Central High
School sophomores were wounded by gunfire
yesterday in an incident that followed a fight
between two groups of pupils, police said.
Lt. James Lafnear, school probation officer, said
that minutes after the fight, a young man — believed
to be a pupil — pushed his v/ay through the crowd
and started shooting a handgun.
One of the pupils was listed in serious condition
with an abdominal wound. Police said four of those
shot were white and one black.
Asked if the shooting had racial overtones,
Lafnear told newsmen, "In a situation like this,
there always are, even if there weren't any to start
with."
Lafnear said two youths had been detained for

questioning, but that no charges had been filed.
U. S. Backs Rumanian Plea
HELSINKI, Finland — The United States and its
West European allies threw their weight yesterday
behind a plea from the Rumania government that
the Soviet Union agree to disregard military
alliances in preparing a 34-nation conference on
security and cooperation in Europe.
The Soviets say the statement is unnecessary.
There could be a backlash if they insist.
U.S. sources said Val Peterson, head of the
delegation, announced he could support Valentin
Lipatti, who speaks for the Rumanians. Lipatti
asked Friday that the rules of procedure pledge all
countries to take part on a basis of equality and
independence, regardless of military alliances.
Rumania belongs to the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact, but
likes to act on its own.
Delegates reported additional backing for
Rumania from France, Britain, the Netherlands,
Greece, Turkey, Spain, Ireland and Switzerland.
Yugoslavia, another maverick Communist country
was also said to be sympathetic.
Hungary, Poland, East Germany, Czechoslovakia
and Bulgaria supported the Soviet Union. On
Friday, Soviet Ambassador Viktor Maltsev said a
reference to military alliances would have no legal
value — that an alliance does not limit a country's
independence.
