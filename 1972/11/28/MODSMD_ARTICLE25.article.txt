# FBI Continues Probe Into SLAC Bombing
## 
### 
Almost a full year after two bombs
caused $45,000 damage to the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center
(SLAC), federal officials are still
investigating the blasts, and have yet
to make any arrests in the case.
A spokesman for the San Francisco
office of the Federal Bureau of
Investigation said yesterday that the
case is still open, but declined to say if
any new leads had been turned up in
the last year.
The first of the two bombs
exploded at 3:28 a.m. on the morning
of Dec. 7, 1971, with the second blast
occurring moments later. The damage
was centered in Sector 0 of the Sand
Hill Road facility, disabling the master
oscillator and the beam knock-out
system.
The two-mile long main tunnel,
which runs beneath Interstate
Highway 280 in the foothills behind
campus, was not damaged, and the
facility routinely reopened on Jan. 3.

SLAC is funded by the U.S. Atomic
Energy Commission. It was this tie
that brought the FBI into the case.
Stanley Hennessy, a spokesman for
FBI special agent Charles Bates, would
say only that the case was "still under
investigation" but declined to say if
there are any suspects or any recent
information in the case.
SLAC Director Wolfgang K.H.
Panofsky said yesterday that he had
no information in the matter, but
cited several possible motives for the
bombing.
He said it might have been done to
mark the 30th anniversary of the
attack on Pearl Harbor, by a
disgruntled unemployed technical
worker, or by left- or right-wing
extremists.
A caller to Bay Area television
station KQED claimed credit for the
bombing shortly after the attack, but
the FBI and Dr. Panofsky discounted
the call as the work of a crank.
