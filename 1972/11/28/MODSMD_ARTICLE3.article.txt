## USE Criticizes SLAC Budget Cutbacks 
### 
United Stanford Employees (USE), a University
staff organization, has released two unsigned
handbills vigorously criticizing budget cutbacks at
the Stanford Linear Accelerator (SLAC) and
advancing its own counterproposal.
SLAC Director Wolfgang Panofsky two weeks
ago issued a memorandum informing his employees
that the accelerator would curtail its operations to
meet a half-million dollar budget cut mandated by
the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), which funds
SLAC's $25 million budget.
Panofsky responded to the sudden, mid-financial
year cutback by reducing accelerator operating
time, reducing his staff by "between twenty-five
and fifty regular employees," hopefully through
attrition and a temporary hiring freeze, asking
employees to take large amounts of vacation before
July 1, and reducing the number of "contract
people" at SLAC.
In a handout released just before Thanksgiving
break, USE accused Panofsky of contributing to the
drastic budget-cutting with a $165,000
"expenditure overrun," in addition to the AEC cut.
In an earlier statement, USE had accused SLAC's
"Fat Cat Bureaucrats" of protecting themselves

while they " 'reluctantly' sharpen up the axe to use
on lower paid workers."
No Comment
Panofsky yesterday said he had read the USE
handbills, but did not feel he was expected to
respond to them. He would not elaborate.
In a November 16 handbill, USE accused SLAC
administrators of " 'crisis management,' with the
lowest paid workers being threatened first and
most." The union also said Panofsky's request that
worker's take early vacations was a "nonsolution,
and only punishes those who can afford it least."
USE requested a cost breakdown of "all budget
adjustment possibilities," and asked management to
supply statistics on "monies saved with the
'suggested' vacation program last year."
In a "counterproposal," the union alleged that a
one-month leave without pay for the 180 SLAC
employees who earn more than $1400 per month
would bring in $252,000. "We challenge SLAC
management to test their theory that all the top
people would quit if their pay were cut," the
handout said. The accelerator employs 1200 people.
In their November 21 "Program for the Future,"
anonymous USE officers suggested that

management form a "SLAC Employees Caucus" of
elected representatives from all employee
classifications.
The Caucus could then "meet with management
to discuss budget options and alternatives before
decisions are made," the union officers wrote.
Four Proposals
The handbill also advanced four other proposals:
—"Higher paid people should suffer from
unplanned budget cuts first, not last, and
proportionally to their income";
—"seniority should be protected with job
security as a matter of laboratory policy," and that
SLAC should implement the University's "equal pay
for equal work" policy;
—"In-house training programs should eliminate
the use of job-shoppers, who earn exceptional
salaries and are treated as a separate class."
"Job-shoppers" are contracted employees not
employed by the accelerator; and
—Management should "send out a questionnaire
to employees, asking them, "How would you save
money?"
The handbill concluded by asking management
to respond to the union's "serious proposals."

to respond to the union's "serious proposals."
United Stanford Employees (USE), a University
staff organization, has released two unsigned
handbills vigorously criticizing budget cutbacks at
the Stanford Linear Accelerator (SLAC) and
advancing its own counterproposal.
SLAC Director Wolfgang Panofsky two weeks
ago issued a memorandum informing his employees
that the accelerator would curtail its operations to
meet a half-million dollar budget cut mandated by
the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), which funds
SLAC's $25 million budget.
Panofsky responded to the sudden, mid-financial
year cutback by reducing accelerator operating
time, reducing his staff by "between twenty-five
and fifty regular employees," hopefully through
attrition and a temporary hiring freeze, asking
employees to take large amounts of vacation before
July 1, and reducing the number of "contract
people" at SLAC.
In a handout released just before Thanksgiving
break, USE accused Panofsky of contributing to the
drastic budget-cutting with a $165,000
"expenditure overrun," in addition to the AEC cut.
In an earlier statement, USE had accused SLAC's
"Fat Cat Bureaucrats" of protecting themselves

while they " 'reluctantly' sharpen up the axe to use
on lower paid workers."
No Comment
Panofsky yesterday said he had read the USE
handbills, but did not feel he was expected to
respond to them. He would not elaborate.
In a November 16 handbill, USE accused SLAC
administrators of " 'crisis management,' with the
lowest paid workers being threatened first and
most." The union also said Panofsky's request that
worker's take early vacations was a "nonsolution,
and only punishes those who can afford it least."
USE requested a cost breakdown of "all budget
adjustment possibilities," and asked management to
supply statistics on "monies saved with the
'suggested' vacation program last year."
In a "counterproposal," the union alleged that a
one-month leave without pay for the 180 SLAC
employees who earn more than $1400 per month
would bring in $252,000. "We challenge SLAC
management to test their theory that all the top
people would quit if their pay were cut," the
handout said. The accelerator employs 1200 people.
In their November 21 "Program for the Future,"
anonymous USE officers suggested that

management form a "SLAC Employees Caucus" of
elected representatives from all employee
classifications.
The Caucus could then "meet with management
to discuss budget options and alternatives before
decisions are made," the union officers wrote.
Four Proposals
The handbill also advanced four other proposals:
—"Higher paid people should suffer from
unplanned budget cuts first, not last, and
proportionally to their income";
—"seniority should be protected with job
security as a matter of laboratory policy," and that
SLAC should implement the University's "equal pay
for equal work" policy;
—"In-house training programs should eliminate
the use of job-shoppers, who earn exceptional
salaries and are treated as a separate class."
"Job-shoppers" are contracted employees not
employed by the accelerator; and
—Management should "send out a questionnaire
to employees, asking them, "How would you save
money?"
The handbill concluded by asking management
to respond to the union's "serious proposals."
