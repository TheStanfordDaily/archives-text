# BSU Requests Investigation Of Student Deaths At Southern U.
## 
### 
The Nov. 16 shootings of two black
students at Southern University have
resulted in a wave of activity by the
black community at Stanford.
The Black Students Union has
forwarded petitions to the Black
Congressional Caucus in Washington,
D.C., urging an immediate
Congressional investigation of the
shootings. The petitions ask that
members of the Caucus be included on
the investigatory body, and that the
National Guard be removed from the
Southern University campus and
surrounding communities.
Charles Ogletree, head of the Black
Students Union, said that the petitions

should arrive in Washington today, and
that they should receive response by
Friday.
Ogletree predicts that the Caucus
will be "very receptive" to the
petitions. "They're kind of ad hoc
right now, but I think that when they
see that they have wide support, there
will be more participation."
Ogletree believes that the Caucus
will be concerned about the presence
of military units on the campus, which
he said was a threat not only to black
students, but to all students that
attend the school.
The Black Students Union also
began a fund-raising drive at a Nov. 17

rally held here at Stanford. Ninety
dollars was collected at the rally, and
their goal is to collect $2000 by the
next academic quarter.
The immediate goal of the drive is
to send financial aid to the families of
Leonard D. Brown and Denver A.
Smith, the two students killed at
Southern U.
The Union also intends to set up a
scholarship fund in the names of the
two slain students. The scholarships
will be given to incoming students at
Southern U.
Harold Boyd, Asst. Dean of
Students, is planning a parallel drive
among Stanford faculty members.
On Nov. 24, the Bay Area black
community held a press conference on
the shootings. Appearing at the
conference were representatives of Bay
Area Black organizations.
Jon Sylvester from the Nairobi
Committee for Community Control
opened the meeting. He explained that
the purpose of the meeting was to
express the solidarity of the
organizations present. He said that
urgent action was needed to challenge
the "racist aggression" behind the law
and order tactics of the Nixon
Administration.
Ron Bailey of the Bay African
Liberation Support Committee
discussed a boycott led by Southern

U. students and black dock workers in
Burnside, Louisiana. The boycott
resulted in the stoppage of the
unloading of chromium ore from
Rhodesia, which the American
government has brought here in
contradiction to UN sanctions. He said
that this act was part of a continual
degradation of black people.
Also represented at the meeting
were the Stanford University Black
Students Union, San Jose Southern
University Coalition, the Malcolm X
Unity House, the San Francisco
Coalition for Southern University, and
the Berkeley City Council.
Two days later, there was a rally
and march in San Francisco. Over 200
people participated in the march from
the Malcolm X Unity House to
Raymond Kimball Park.
Ogletree said that the march was
very effective, despite "lackadaisical
press coverage." He believed it to be a
good show of solidarity among black
people in the Bay Area.
Ogletree added that there was a
great deal of activity in other
California schools as well. He noted
that students at San Francisco State
College and Sacramento City College
were boycotting classes this week. He
said that he has not been contacted by
Southern California schools, but he
understands them to be active.
