# University Fund Raising Drive Nets 70.6 Million In Pledges
## 
### BRUCE KADDEN 
Gifts and pledges totaling $70.6
million have put the Stanford
fund-raising campaign ahead of
schedule. The University has already
obtained almost one-fourth of the
$300 million goal.
The figures are for the period from
April 11, when the campaign effort
was officially launched, through the
end of October. The campaign is slated
as a five-year drive.
An anonymous pledge of $15
million announced at the beginning of
the campaign is the largest
contribution to date. It was part of a
$45 million nucleus fund collected to
get the drive started.
The campaign is divided into three
organizing groups: major gifts of
$100,000 or more, special gifts of
$10,000-$lOO,OOO, and Annual Fund
gifts of less than $10,000.
Each division is run by a volunteer
group, which solicits funds from
individuals and corporations. Kenneth
Cuthbertson, University vice-president

for development, attributes the drive's
early success to the volunteers' hard
work.
Encouraging Figure
Dave Fulton, communications
director for the campaign said the
$70.6 million is "a very encouraging
figure."
He does not feel the relative calm
on the campus so far this year has
substantially helped the drive. "I have
been told that gifts to the university
held up, despite any campus
disruptions," he said.
Most of the money that comes in is
donated for a specific purpose such as
an endowed professorship or a new
building. This money is immediately
put to use in its prescribed area.
Breakdown Of Funds
The $300 million goal will provide
$125 million in endowments, which

do not benefit the University in the
short run, $92 million for financial
aid, libraries, and other general uses,
and $85 million for a building fund to
renovate the Quad and construct new
buildings.
Administrators and trustees decided
to initiate the drive after concluding
that Stanford could continue to
provide the same quality of education
"only by an increase in private gift
support."
The current drive is the largest by a
private educational institution in
history, and seeks to raise Stanford's
gift income from $30 million per year
to $60 million.
Planning of the drive was first set in
motion in January, 1970, when the
Board of Trustees appointed an ad hoc
committee to discuss means of
increasing Stanford's gift income.

that Stanford could continue to
provide the same quality of education
"only by an increase in private gift
support."
The current drive is the largest by a
private educational institution in
history, and seeks to raise Stanford's
gift income from $30 million per year
to $60 million.
Planning of the drive was first set in
motion in January, 1970, when the
Board of Trustees appointed an ad hoc
committee to discuss means of
increasing Stanford's gift income.

WAILING WALL — Plywood seems to be the most popular form of campus
expression and the wall around the School construction is no exception.
One entry stood out among the many slogans and anecdotes, "EDIFACE
COMPLEX-Build we must."
Gifts and pledges totaling $70.6
million have put the Stanford
fund-raising campaign ahead of
schedule. The University has already
obtained almost one-fourth of the
$300 million goal.
The figures are for the period from
April 11, when the campaign effort
was officially launched, through the
end of October. The campaign is slated
as a five-year drive.
An anonymous pledge of $15
million announced at the beginning of
the campaign is the largest
contribution to date. It was part of a
$45 million nucleus fund collected to
get the drive started.
The campaign is divided into three
organizing groups: major gifts of
$100,000 or more, special gifts of
$10,000-$lOO,OOO, and Annual Fund
gifts of less than $10,000.
Each division is run by a volunteer
group, which solicits funds from
individuals and corporations. Kenneth
Cuthbertson, University vice-president

for development, attributes the drive's
early success to the volunteers' hard
work.
Encouraging Figure
Dave Fulton, communications
director for the campaign said the
$70.6 million is "a very encouraging
figure."
He does not feel the relative calm
on the campus so far this year has
substantially helped the drive. "I have
been told that gifts to the university
held up, despite any campus
disruptions," he said.
Most of the money that comes in is
donated for a specific purpose such as
an endowed professorship or a new
building. This money is immediately
put to use in its prescribed area.
Breakdown Of Funds
The $300 million goal will provide
$125 million in endowments, which

do not benefit the University in the
short run, $92 million for financial
aid, libraries, and other general uses,
and $85 million for a building fund to
renovate the Quad and construct new
buildings.
Administrators and trustees decided
to initiate the drive after concluding
that Stanford could continue to
provide the same quality of education
"only by an increase in private gift
support."
