## SALT: Phase II 
### 
One of the best things to come out of President Nixon's
first term in office was the initiation of the Strategic Arms
Limitation Talks (SALT) with the Soviet Union.
The first phase of the talks produced an agreement which
took a major first step in limiting the growing number of
weapons in each country's nuclear stockpile.
Now the second phase is underway and hopefully it will
culminate in a more substantial, permanent agreement. If a
solid, binding agreement is reached, then both sides will have
come a long way toward decreasing the likelihood of a
disastrous nuclear war.
The weapons spiral of the past two decades has lasted
much too long. Both the United States and the Soviet Union
have far more weapons than are necessary to maintain
adequate defenses. In addition, the production of these
weapons has taken money away from needed social and
domestic uses.
SALT has also led to the reduction of Cold War tensions
which have plagued the world for most of the last 20 years.
The working relationship established between the United
States and the Soviet Union has finally made a dent in the
shield of fear and suspicion which has so often threatened
the possibility of world peace.
We hope that these groundbreaking steps with Russia will
lead to further talks with the People's Republic of China,
and eventually with all major world powers. Only then can
we be assured that all countries are willing to cooperate in
the effort to stop the senseless and costly arms race.
Perhaps the limitation of weapons will enable us finally
to turn our attention to the problems that most need our
attention. If the frantic pace of military juggernaut can be
slowed, then hopefully there will be more funds to deal with
our poor people, our cities, our environment and the other
pressing problems which desperately need money.
If a solid strategic arms pact is agreed upon, the entire
world, not just the United States and the Soviet Union, will
be safer. Perhaps the world can be made better as well, if
money currently used for military expenditures can be
directed towards more useful purposes.
