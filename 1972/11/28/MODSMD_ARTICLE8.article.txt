# 'we must become peace-makers'
## Catholics Oppose Honeywell 
### 
st. Ann parish council

The following statement was
adopted by 50 of the 57 members
of our community who expressed
an opinion. It was commissioned
by the St. Ann Council, serving
the Catholic Community at
Stanford, following the
recruitment efforts by Honeywell
at the Placement Center. In light
of current world events regarding
impending cessation of hostilities
in Asia, we feel our statement is
even more timely, and that it
speaks for itself.
We of the Catholic Community
at Stanford feel compelled to
speak out on the question of
war-oriented recruiting at the
Stanford Placement Center. While
we admit the modern necessity
for defense, we do not rest
content with facile conceptions of
it.
The Catholic tradition does not
absolutely condemn war, but
neither does it embrace it. St.
Thomas held that war is opposed
to charity, though he held that
some wars can be called "just," as
determined by individual moral
judgment. The modern Church
has been compelled to reconcile
this tradition with the new
horrors of modern war.
Consequently, we are exhorted by
our fathers to become
peace-makers in the fullest
possible sense. This means 1) to
nurture personal sensitivity to the
cause of peace by serving others;
2) to act responsibly as nations
ever aware of our interdependence
with other nations and peoples;
and 3) collectively, to further the
cause of social justice for all
peoples.
Beyond individualistic Morality*
Taking note of this, Vatican II
admonishes us that "profound
and rapid changes make it
particularly urgent that no one,
ignoring the trends of events or
drugged by laziness, content
himself with a merely
individualistic morality." We are
urged by Pope John to seek the
"true and solid peace of nations

(which) consists not in equality of
arms, but in mutual trust alone."
(Pacem in Terris.) And Pope Paul
notes in his apostolic writings that
"peace cannot be limited to mere
absence of war. No, peace is
something that is built up day
after day, in pursuit of an order
intended by God, which implies a
more perfect form of justice
among men."
In view of these doctrines, we
make the following statement:
1. WE DEPLORE AND
DISAPPROVE of the presence of
Honeywell recruiters on campus.
2. WE HOLD that each
member of our community is free
and encouraged to express his
disapproval in the manner he finds
most effective, consistent with
charity.
Rational Policy
3. WE URGE the University to
formulate a rational policy by
which corporations, the bulk of
whose activities promote the
cause of war, might be barred

from the campus for purposes of
personnel recruitment. In
Honeywell's case, the evidence is
prima facie suggestive of
corporate products designed for
goals beyond those of mere
defense. We fully realize that this
is no simple task, and that the
activities of many companies may
yield products both benign and
offensive. Nevertheless, we do not
view these difficulties of
definition as sufficiently
justifiable of a blind continuance
of a policy which is considered by
so many to be unsatisfactory, if
not blatantly immoral.
4. WE URGE others of all
traditions and beliefs to express
by appropriate means the
indignation which we in our
common humanity are capable of
sharing, and to work together for
the furtherance of peace and
justice in our communities.

Council for the Stanford Catholic
Community.)
