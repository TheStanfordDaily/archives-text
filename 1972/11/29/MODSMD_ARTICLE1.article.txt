# Small Patrons Enjoy The Children's Center
## 
### JEFF HALL 
Even after a hard day of "Buster
Rabbit Time," playing house, and
eating graham crackers, the little
people of the Stanford Children's
Center aren't ready to go home —
they're having too much fun.
When one mother showed up
yesterday to pick up her child, she was
received by an army of three to five
year olds, all shooting their
make-believe guns from behind the
protection of a grassy knoll.
Just what goes on over at the Day
Care Center? "We play a lot,"
according to SWOPSI volunteer Julie
Steinmetz.
Located on Mayfield Ave. in the
old Stanford Elementary School
building, the Center serves about 100
children each day. There are two
separate facilities on the site — the
Day Care Center for the three to five
year olds, and the Little Kid's Place
for the younger group ranging from
nine months to three years of age.
Animal Entertainment
"Dippy," the resident dog, is a
regular friend of the kids, as are the
fish, the salamanders, the guinea pig,
and the rats. At one time, a
boa-constrictor was on hand for the
braver youngsters to admire.
The sandbox and the swings find
much use, thanks to many
improvements made at the center this
year. A combination of volunteers,
staff, parents, and funds received from
an ASSU fee assessment have
transformed the Center into a colorful
and fun place for working Stanford
community parents to leave their
offspring during the day.
Parents pay for the service
according to their ability to do so. $90
a month provides full time day care
for a child, and half day rates are
available. For parents who cannot
afford the full fee, some scholarship
help has been granted. A fund raising
drive is planned to help out more

parents in need. Presently, the
monthly fees cover all expenses.
Last spring, the ASSU passed a Day
Care fee assessment, providing slightly
more than $11,000 for capital
improvements on the center. About
half of this money has been spent or
committed, with the remainder being
saved for future purposes.
Most of the money has been spent
in preparation for obtaining a state
license from the Department of Social
Welfare. Fire-proofing measures such
as the addition of a sprinkler system
and fire extinguishers have been taken,
and all windows have been screened.
Progress in the playground is
readily apparent. What was once a
muddy plot is now covered by hills
and a thick lawn, with gravel
walkways. "I like playing in the grass,"
said little blue-eyed Laura, scratching
her nose.
Three-Wheel Menaces
The kids play with toys, and
contemplate over jigsaw puzzles. Paint
ends up on their faces as well as their
papers, and pedestrians should keep
their eyes open for reckless tricycle
riders.
Activities are structured by four
regular staff members and SWOPSI
students taking "Child Care For the
Future." Arts and crafts are taught,
stories are told, and cooking projects
are consumed. An afternoon nap gives
the children that extra energy they
always seem to possess. But "the trick
is getting them to sleep," said a Center
staff member. Generally, the kids are
very self-sufficient and find plenty to
do on their own.
Phyllis Craig, executive director of
the center, said it was "wonderful"
that parents could leave their children
at the center, while they, the parents
could pursue their own careers or help
add to the family income.
Right now, the budget is of prime
importance. One of the problems is
that the building is available only until
1974, when the University might put

the land to other uses. Money must be
saved up to cover possible moving
expenses, noted Craig, so the Center
"doesn't dare spend it all on goodies"
now, referring to the ASSU grant.
No federal or state funds are
available to the Center, and so it is
dependent, in large part, to the
volunteer efforts of parents. Two
fund-raising projects are currently
under way. Christmas cards are being
sold and the Center is soliciting
associated memberships for a $5 fee,
with the money going to the
scholarship fund.
In order to show the community
how the Center operates, an open
house is being held during the
afternoon of December 7, from 4:30
to 6 p.m.

HARD DAY'S PLAY - Supervised activity goes on at the Stanford Children's Center at the site of the former Stanford
Elementary School. The Day Care Center is run by four full-time staffers and students taking a SWOPSI course.
Even after a hard day of "Buster
Rabbit Time," playing house, and
eating graham crackers, the little
people of the Stanford Children's
Center aren't ready to go home —
they're having too much fun.
When one mother showed up
yesterday to pick up her child, she was
received by an army of three to five
year olds, all shooting their
make-believe guns from behind the
protection of a grassy knoll.
Just what goes on over at the Day
Care Center? "We play a lot,"
according to SWOPSI volunteer Julie
Steinmetz.
Located on Mayfield Ave. in the
old Stanford Elementary School
building, the Center serves about 100
children each day. There are two
separate facilities on the site — the
Day Care Center for the three to five
year olds, and the Little Kid's Place
for the younger group ranging from
nine months to three years of age.
Animal Entertainment
"Dippy," the resident dog, is a
regular friend of the kids, as are the
fish, the salamanders, the guinea pig,
and the rats. At one time, a
boa-constrictor was on hand for the
braver youngsters to admire.
The sandbox and the swings find
much use, thanks to many
improvements made at the center this
year. A combination of volunteers,
staff, parents, and funds received from
an ASSU fee assessment have
transformed the Center into a colorful
and fun place for working Stanford
community parents to leave their
offspring during the day.
Parents pay for the service
according to their ability to do so. $90
a month provides full time day care
for a child, and half day rates are
available. For parents who cannot
afford the full fee, some scholarship
help has been granted. A fund raising
drive is planned to help out more

parents in need. Presently, the
monthly fees cover all expenses.
Last spring, the ASSU passed a Day
Care fee assessment, providing slightly
more than $11,000 for capital
improvements on the center. About
half of this money has been spent or
committed, with the remainder being
saved for future purposes.
Most of the money has been spent
in preparation for obtaining a state
license from the Department of Social
Welfare. Fire-proofing measures such
as the addition of a sprinkler system
and fire extinguishers have been taken,
and all windows have been screened.
Progress in the playground is
readily apparent. What was once a
muddy plot is now covered by hills
and a thick lawn, with gravel
walkways. "I like playing in the grass,"
said little blue-eyed Laura, scratching
her nose.
Three-Wheel Menaces
The kids play with toys, and
contemplate over jigsaw puzzles. Paint
ends up on their faces as well as their
papers, and pedestrians should keep
their eyes open for reckless tricycle
riders.
Activities are structured by four
regular staff members and SWOPSI
students taking "Child Care For the
Future." Arts and crafts are taught,
stories are told, and cooking projects
are consumed. An afternoon nap gives
the children that extra energy they
always seem to possess. But "the trick
is getting them to sleep," said a Center
staff member. Generally, the kids are
very self-sufficient and find plenty to
do on their own.
Phyllis Craig, executive director of
the center, said it was "wonderful"
that parents could leave their children
at the center, while they, the parents
could pursue their own careers or help
add to the family income.
Right now, the budget is of prime
importance. One of the problems is
that the building is available only until
1974, when the University might put

the land to other uses. Money must be
saved up to cover possible moving
expenses, noted Craig, so the Center
"doesn't dare spend it all on goodies"
now, referring to the ASSU grant.
No federal or state funds are
available to the Center, and so it is
dependent, in large part, to the
volunteer efforts of parents. Two
fund-raising projects are currently
under way. Christmas cards are being
sold and the Center is soliciting
associated memberships for a $5 fee,
with the money going to the
scholarship fund.
In order to show the community
how the Center operates, an open
house is being held during the
afternoon of December 7, from 4:30
to 6 p.m.
