# equality for women 'long overdue'
## 'Are We Liberated Men?' 
###

In the last year or two a great
deal of attention and interest has
been focused by the media on the
Women's Liberation Movement.
The second awakening of women
after a fifty-year slumber has been
met in various ways by various
segments of society. From the
cries of "the woman's place is in
the home" to the newly emerging
up-front attitude of homosexuals
and lesbians, the Women's
Movement is generating the
beginnings of social upheaval.
Never before equaled anywhere
in history, this upheaval spans
every social and economic class in
the nation. When the most
oppressed "majority" in the
nation rise up to be heard, they
will volcanically touch all facets
of society. For this reason a very
serious look by men at what
Women's Liberation means to
them as men is in order.
When advocates of Women's
Lib say "Women's Liberation

means Men's Liberation" exactly
what are they saying to us? Are
they calling us to join them in
their struggle, or are they saying
something else entirely? What is
meant by "Men's Liberation"? As
men these are probably the most
vital questions we will ever be
called upon to answer. Let us look
at what being "liberated" really
means.
Liberal Institution
Being involved in one of the
leading liberal-thinking
institutions in the nation, male
students at Stanford seem to take
the state of their liberation for
granted. After all as long as the
war is slowing down (at least as
far as the draft goes) and as long
as I have an income, I can afford
to be liberated. It's no sweat off
my back to sympathize with and
pay lip service to Women's Lib. It
keeps my women happy; and
since I am a liberated man, it
doesn't hurt me to throw a few
crumbs to the chicks. Besides, it
makes them feel better; almost
like I really cared.
Such a magnanimous attitude
is typical of so-called (by
themselves) liberated men.
However, what would being truly
liberated men mean to us? First, it
would mean the loss of certain
male prerogatives and "rights"
now freely assumed almost
without thought by most men.
No longer would men be able
to take for granted that women
are responsible for supplying
subordinate labor: taking memos,
typing decisions, making coffee,
and generally playing the
"step-and-fetch-it" roles. No
longer will men sit on councils
and boards making the decisions
and handing down the dictates
designed to ease world dilemmas
and to dazzle the childish minds
of their women.
Back Seat
It means that men may have to
accustom themselves to the idea
of taking a back seat to superiorly
qualified women on those
councils and boards heretofore
closed to women. Men are going
to make some of the coffee and to
do some of the typing that they
have relegated to women for such
a long time.
When a woman stands to
speak, she will have men listening
for a change. When she is done
giving her ideas and opinions, she
will receive the same
consideration piven to opinions of
the men. The man will no longer
find it easy to marry a
wife-whore, housekeeper-cook,
baby-factory-day-care-center, and
virtual slave whose services can be
obtained for the price of a
wedding and the dubious honors
of the marital bed.
Women's Liberation means
human rights for women. Those
are the same rights that men have
demanded for themselves but have
never seen fit to allow women. It
is the right to be a person who can
respect herself because she is
human and an equal part of
mankind — not a mere possession
of it.
You may say, "I am a liberated
man. I do believe in all of those

things; therefore, I have already
answered these questions."
Don't delude yourself into
thinking that the casting away of
your sex role and the acceptance
of a new identity can be so easy.
All of you who claim to be
liberated, watch yourselves! The
next time that you look at a
Playboy centerfold and compare
her boobs with last month's issue,
imagine yourself in the centerfold.
Visualize some woman comparing
the size of your cock and balls
with last month's issue and saying,
"My, last month's Play Stud was
hung better."
If you still think that you're
liberated, ask yourself what you
would say when friends, or any
group of males, start saying things
like: "Boy, that chick sure has a
nice set of tits. I'd sure like to
fuck her." "I wonder when the
sweat-piggies will get here for the
party tonight. I need a piece-of-ass
and don't care what it looks like.
After all, you can always put a
sack over he head." "BOY! That
chick can sure give good B.J.'s. All
you have to do is get her drunk
and start playing with her
tits .. ."
If you haven't got the guts to
stand up and shout out what pig
talk this is, then you're not
liberated. If you still believe that
the proper role in life for a
woman is on her back, brother,
you are in for a cruel awakening.
Women are not asking men to
join them in their struggle for
liberation or merely to support
them. They're serving notice on
malekind. They're saying, "We're
going to liberate ourselves in spite
of what you do." You've heard it
from the blacks. Now, you're
going to hear it from the women.
"You are not a woman. You don't
know what it is to be a woman, so
don't presume to try. We've got
our own problems, and you are
the major one. You had better get
your shit together, or we'll get it
together for you."
Once women finally attain
their human rights, there is going
to be no room for the un-liberated
man. The more overt behavior
exemplified above is already on its
way out. Very few open-minded
men will admit to being party to
it anymore. The problems men
face in liberating themselves are
more subtle and more ingrained in
the very fiber and definition of
masculinity.
A whole new definition of
what is appropriate behavior for
men is in order and perhaps long
overdue. Men are going to have to
liberate themselves of the ugly
traits which have scarred women,
scarred society, and scarred
ourselves. Women's liberation
means isolation for all of those
men who refuse to liberate
themselves.
In this struggle for freedom,
there is no middle ground. You
choose your own fate: to change
and grow in a world of equality
increased a hundredfold by the
addition of women as humans, or
to be cast out and castrated by
your own prejudices.

Don't delude yourself into
thinking that the casting away of
your sex role and the acceptance
of a new identity can be so easy.
All of you who claim to be
liberated, watch yourselves! The
next time that you look at a
Playboy centerfold and compare
her boobs with last month's issue,
imagine yourself in the centerfold.
Visualize some woman comparing
the size of your cock and balls
with last month's issue and saying,
"My, last month's Play Stud was
hung better."
If you still think that you're
liberated, ask yourself what you
would say when friends, or any
group of males, start saying things
like: "Boy, that chick sure has a
nice set of tits. I'd sure like to
fuck her." "I wonder when the
sweat-piggies will get here for the
party tonight. I need a piece-of-ass
and don't care what it looks like.
After all, you can always put a
sack over he head." "BOY! That
chick can sure give good B.J.'s. All
you have to do is get her drunk
and start playing with her
tits .. ."
If you haven't got the guts to
stand up and shout out what pig
talk this is, then you're not
liberated. If you still believe that
the proper role in life for a
woman is on her back, brother,
you are in for a cruel awakening.
Women are not asking men to
join them in their struggle for
liberation or merely to support
them. They're serving notice on
malekind. They're saying, "We're
going to liberate ourselves in spite
of what you do." You've heard it
from the blacks. Now, you're
going to hear it from the women.
"You are not a woman. You don't
know what it is to be a woman, so
don't presume to try. We've got
our own problems, and you are
the major one. You had better get
your shit together, or we'll get it
together for you."
Once women finally attain
their human rights, there is going
to be no room for the un-liberated
man. The more overt behavior
exemplified above is already on its
way out. Very few open-minded
men will admit to being party to
it anymore. The problems men
face in liberating themselves are
more subtle and more ingrained in
the very fiber and definition of
masculinity.
A whole new definition of
what is appropriate behavior for
men is in order and perhaps long
overdue. Men are going to have to
liberate themselves of the ugly
traits which have scarred women,
scarred society, and scarred
ourselves. Women's liberation
means isolation for all of those
men who refuse to liberate
themselves.
In this struggle for freedom,
there is no middle ground. You
choose your own fate: to change
and grow in a world of equality
increased a hundredfold by the
addition of women as humans, or
to be cast out and castrated by
your own prejudices.

In the last year or two a great
deal of attention and interest has
been focused by the media on the
Women's Liberation Movement.
The second awakening of women
after a fifty-year slumber has been
met in various ways by various
segments of society. From the
cries of "the woman's place is in
the home" to the newly emerging
up-front attitude of homosexuals
and lesbians, the Women's
Movement is generating the
beginnings of social upheaval.
Never before equaled anywhere
in history, this upheaval spans
every social and economic class in
the nation. When the most
oppressed "majority" in the
nation rise up to be heard, they
will volcanically touch all facets
of society. For this reason a very
serious look by men at what
Women's Liberation means to
them as men is in order.
When advocates of Women's
Lib say "Women's Liberation

means Men's Liberation" exactly
what are they saying to us? Are
they calling us to join them in
their struggle, or are they saying
something else entirely? What is
meant by "Men's Liberation"? As
men these are probably the most
vital questions we will ever be
called upon to answer. Let us look
at what being "liberated" really
means.
Liberal Institution
Being involved in one of the
leading liberal-thinking
institutions in the nation, male
students at Stanford seem to take
the state of their liberation for
granted. After all as long as the
war is slowing down (at least as
far as the draft goes) and as long
as I have an income, I can afford
to be liberated. It's no sweat off
my back to sympathize with and
pay lip service to Women's Lib. It
keeps my women happy; and
since I am a liberated man, it
doesn't hurt me to throw a few
crumbs to the chicks. Besides, it
makes them feel better; almost
like I really cared.
Such a magnanimous attitude
is typical of so-called (by
themselves) liberated men.
However, what would being truly
liberated men mean to us? First, it
would mean the loss of certain
male prerogatives and "rights"
now freely assumed almost
without thought by most men.
No longer would men be able
to take for granted that women
are responsible for supplying
subordinate labor: taking memos,
typing decisions, making coffee,
and generally playing the
"step-and-fetch-it" roles. No
longer will men sit on councils
and boards making the decisions
and handing down the dictates
designed to ease world dilemmas
and to dazzle the childish minds
of their women.
Back Seat
It means that men may have to
accustom themselves to the idea
of taking a back seat to superiorly
qualified women on those
councils and boards heretofore
closed to women. Men are going
to make some of the coffee and to
do some of the typing that they
have relegated to women for such
a long time.
When a woman stands to
speak, she will have men listening
for a change. When she is done
giving her ideas and opinions, she
will receive the same
consideration piven to opinions of
the men. The man will no longer
find it easy to marry a
wife-whore, housekeeper-cook,
baby-factory-day-care-center, and
virtual slave whose services can be
obtained for the price of a
wedding and the dubious honors
of the marital bed.
Women's Liberation means
human rights for women. Those
are the same rights that men have
demanded for themselves but have
never seen fit to allow women. It
is the right to be a person who can
respect herself because she is
human and an equal part of
mankind — not a mere possession
of it.
You may say, "I am a liberated
man. I do believe in all of those

things; therefore, I have already
answered these questions."
Don't delude yourself into
thinking that the casting away of
your sex role and the acceptance
of a new identity can be so easy.

Lib say "Women's Liberation

means Men's Liberation" exactly
what are they saying to us? Are
they calling us to join them in
their struggle, or are they saying
something else entirely? What is
meant by "Men's Liberation"? As
men these are probably the most
vital questions we will ever be
called upon to answer. Let us look
at what being "liberated" really
means.
Liberal Institution
Being involved in one of the
leading liberal-thinking
institutions in the nation, male
students at Stanford seem to take
the state of their liberation for
granted. After all as long as the
war is slowing down (at least as
far as the draft goes) and as long
as I have an income, I can afford
to be liberated. It's no sweat off
my back to sympathize with and
pay lip service to Women's Lib. It
keeps my women happy; and
since I am a liberated man, it
doesn't hurt me to throw a few
crumbs to the chicks. Besides, it
makes them feel better; almost
like I really cared.
Such a magnanimous attitude
is typical of so-called (by
themselves) liberated men.
However, what would being truly
liberated men mean to us? First, it
would mean the loss of certain
male prerogatives and "rights"
now freely assumed almost
without thought by most men.
No longer would men be able
to take for granted that women
are responsible for supplying
subordinate labor: taking memos,
typing decisions, making coffee,
and generally playing the
"step-and-fetch-it" roles. No
longer will men sit on councils
and boards making the decisions
and handing down the dictates
designed to ease world dilemmas
and to dazzle the childish minds
of their women.
Back Seat
It means that men may have to
accustom themselves to the idea
of taking a back seat to superiorly
qualified women on those
councils and boards heretofore
closed to women. Men are going
to make some of the coffee and to
do some of the typing that they
have relegated to women for such
a long time.
When a woman stands to
speak, she will have men listening
for a change. When she is done
giving her ideas and opinions, she
will receive the same
consideration piven to opinions of
the men. The man will no longer
find it easy to marry a
wife-whore, housekeeper-cook,
baby-factory-day-care-center, and
virtual slave whose services can be
obtained for the price of a
wedding and the dubious honors
of the marital bed.
Women's Liberation means
human rights for women. Those
are the same rights that men have
demanded for themselves but have
never seen fit to allow women. It
is the right to be a person who can
respect herself because she is
human and an equal part of
mankind — not a mere possession
of it.
You may say, "I am a liberated
man. I do believe in all of those

things; therefore, I have already
answered these questions."
Don't delude yourself into
thinking that the casting away of
your sex role and the acceptance
of a new identity can be so easy.
All of you who claim to be
liberated, watch yourselves! The
next time that you look at a
Playboy centerfold and compare
her boobs with last month's issue,
imagine yourself in the centerfold.
Visualize some woman comparing
the size of your cock and balls
with last month's issue and saying,
"My, last month's Play Stud was
hung better."
If you still think that you're
liberated, ask yourself what you
would say when friends, or any
group of males, start saying things
like: "Boy, that chick sure has a
nice set of tits. I'd sure like to
fuck her." "I wonder when the
sweat-piggies will get here for the
party tonight. I need a piece-of-ass
and don't care what it looks like.
After all, you can always put a
sack over he head." "BOY! That
chick can sure give good B.J.'s. All
you have to do is get her drunk
and start playing with her
tits .. ."
If you haven't got the guts to
stand up and shout out what pig
talk this is, then you're not
liberated. If you still believe that
the proper role in life for a
woman is on her back, brother,
you are in for a cruel awakening.
Women are not asking men to
join them in their struggle for
liberation or merely to support
them. They're serving notice on
malekind. They're saying, "We're
going to liberate ourselves in spite
of what you do." You've heard it
from the blacks. Now, you're
going to hear it from the women.
"You are not a woman. You don't
know what it is to be a woman, so
don't presume to try. We've got
our own problems, and you are
the major one. You had better get
your shit together, or we'll get it
together for you."
Once women finally attain
their human rights, there is going
to be no room for the un-liberated
man. The more overt behavior
exemplified above is already on its
way out. Very few open-minded
men will admit to being party to
it anymore. The problems men
face in liberating themselves are
more subtle and more ingrained in
the very fiber and definition of
masculinity.
A whole new definition of
what is appropriate behavior for
men is in order and perhaps long
overdue. Men are going to have to
liberate themselves of the ugly
traits which have scarred women,
scarred society, and scarred
ourselves. Women's liberation
means isolation for all of those
men who refuse to liberate
themselves.
In this struggle for freedom,
there is no middle ground. You
choose your own fate: to change
and grow in a world of equality
increased a hundredfold by the
addition of women as humans, or
to be cast out and castrated by
your own prejudices.

In the last year or two a great
deal of attention and interest has
been focused by the media on the
Women's Liberation Movement.
The second awakening of women
after a fifty-year slumber has been
met in various ways by various
segments of society. From the
cries of "the woman's place is in
the home" to the newly emerging
up-front attitude of homosexuals
and lesbians, the Women's
Movement is generating the
beginnings of social upheaval.
Never before equaled anywhere
in history, this upheaval spans
every social and economic class in
the nation. When the most
oppressed "majority" in the
nation rise up to be heard, they
will volcanically touch all facets
of society. For this reason a very
serious look by men at what
Women's Liberation means to

and don't care what it looks like.
After all, you can always put a
sack over he head." "BOY! That
chick can sure give good B.J.'s. All
you have to do is get her drunk
and start playing with her
tits .. ."
If you haven't got the guts to
stand up and shout out what pig
talk this is, then you're not
liberated. If you still believe that
the proper role in life for a
woman is on her back, brother,
you are in for a cruel awakening.
Women are not asking men to
join them in their struggle for
liberation or merely to support
them. They're serving notice on
malekind. They're saying, "We're
going to liberate ourselves in spite
of what you do." You've heard it
from the blacks. Now, you're
going to hear it from the women.
"You are not a woman. You don't
know what it is to be a woman, so
don't presume to try. We've got
our own problems, and you are
the major one. You had better get
your shit together, or we'll get it
together for you."
Once women finally attain
their human rights, there is going
to be no room for the un-liberated
man. The more overt behavior
exemplified above is already on its
way out. Very few open-minded
men will admit to being party to
it anymore. The problems men
face in liberating themselves are
more subtle and more ingrained in
the very fiber and definition of
masculinity.
A whole new definition of
what is appropriate behavior for
men is in order and perhaps long
overdue. Men are going to have to
liberate themselves of the ugly
traits which have scarred women,
scarred society, and scarred
ourselves. Women's liberation
means isolation for all of those
men who refuse to liberate
themselves.
In this struggle for freedom,
there is no middle ground. You
choose your own fate: to change
and grow in a world of equality
increased a hundredfold by the
addition of women as humans, or
to be cast out and castrated by
your own prejudices.
