'Our Debauched Society'
Editor:
I have a niece attending your
school. I shall not reveal her name
for fear she will be scoffed at,
called Priscilla Prude and Virginia
Virgin and other such
appellations.
However, she is one of the
fortunate girls. She is immune to
this hideous age and its scarlet
values. Her long brown limbs and
tender bosom will not be
despoiled by some lusting lout out
for a cheap night's adventure.
But what sort of age is this that
permits institutions of higher
learning to pass out birth control
pills willy nilly, that allows
students to cohabit without
penalty? How long can our
debauched society go on ignoring
the mass distribution of films like
Marjoe, pocket books like The
Story of 0, or more recently
Dolinsky's Mind One? How long
can obnoxious disc jockeys
continue to play recordings
nationwide extolling drugs and
urging girls to "bang the whole
gang."?
Young people, I ask you to
take a moment! Pause, reconsider
your peril. Save yourselves. Turn
your backs on the licentiousness
around you.
And dear editor I ask you,
please print my letter. Allow one
shaft of sunlight to pierce the
gloom of "the stone zone."

'Restore Language
Requirement'
When the Stanford Study of
Education advocated
interdisciplinary programs in
1968, it did not foresee the
co nseq uences of its
recommendation on foreign
language study. The decision to
drop the foreign language
requirement made it necessary for
individual departments to
convince students of the value of
this discipline. From my own
observation, the result has not
been a happy one.
High schools, which are known
to take their clue from the
colleges, are not training students
adequately in foreign languages.
For example, a term paper written
in French, in high school, was
brought to my attention recently.
Each . page was covered with
grammatical errors of which the
writer was unaware. The student
had received an "A" on the paper,
and stated quite complacently
that the emphasis of the course
had been on "ideas."
This kind of situation is
confronting us daily. Students are
enrolling in courses for which
they are linguistically unprepared.
Literature courses are
proliferating in translation.
Renowned French scholars are
invited to campus to lecture in
English. Language majors are
permitted to submit papers in
English, in literature courses
required for their major.
Before it is too late, we must
realize the disservice we are doing
to humanistic studies. A foreign
language cannot be "picked up"
when needed, like a tool. It is
mastered through sustained
inquiry, and has subtleties and
nuances of its own. To learn a
foreign language is a complex
process, unfolding from basic
skills and leading to new areas of
awareness and sensitivity.
Under the present system, we
are setting up arbitrary barriers
between language study and ideas.
We are using the latter as a means
to escape the former. Only
something drastic will turn the
tide. Is it really too soon to
consider restoring the language
requirement? Standards would
return, at least in one
well-structured area, and a
rational sense of order would
again prevail. Students in
humanities would confront the
real challenge of a discipline they
so readily accept in name.

McGovern's 'Poor Strategy'
Editor:
Senator McGovern's "poor
strategy" has become the theme
of an exultant chorus of
post-election analysts. One gathers
he should have followed tradition
— spoken more and said less;
confined himself to the safe and
time-worn promises of better
roads, lower taxes and higher
profits, a balanced budget, more
schools, higher living standards,
peace with "honor," etc. He
should have posed as a Mod Uncle
Sam; let himself be groomed by
one of those Madison Ave.
personality dry-cleaning
establishments, that cosmetize
your thoughts and words, as well
as your skin and hair — the
image-makers. He should have
bought himself "a new
McGovern."
After all, Mr. Nixon is not a
popular man, as was Eisenhower
in the Stevenson days. Nobody
extols his character, courage,
integrity, or even his looks. We
have simply gotten used to him.
All he had to do was say nothing
and bask in the self-assumed role
as author of the general
prosperity, inflation and unrest
notwithstanding. How many
voters speculate on how his
reckless use of an unlimited Credit
Card (is he not virtually his own
banker, as well as borrower?) has
put us in hock for generations to
come? "Don't rock the boat," the
Madison Boulevardiers would have
warned the Senator, who might
have added, "not even when it's
headed for the rocks?"
The truth has seldom been
good strategy in elections. Telling
people what they don't want to
believe is a bore. Besides, there are
the polls, which tend to confirm
themselves. I wonder how many
millions simply vote for the
pre-announced winner. We're a
gambling people, and frankly
more sports-loving than
sportsmanlike; inclined also to
forget that there is no correlation
between winning an athletic
contest and winning an election.
Mr. McGovern joins a very
distinguished company of the
defeated, including Jefferson, J.Q.
Adams, Jackson, Clay, Fremont,
Greely, Bryan, T. Roosevelt, C.E.
Hughes, La Follette, A 1 Smith,
Wilkie, Adlai Stevenson, and
Humphrey — nearly all better men
than the respective winners.
Indeed, it may not have been
McGovern who lost the election,
but the United States. Of Mr.
Nixon's landslide, one could
almost say, with the ancient King
of Epirus, 279 8.C.: "One more
such victory and we are undone."

Value of Honest
Communication
Editor:
If there is anything which
desperately lacks in this society it
is a great respect toward trying to
understand problems which exist
in America. When we have the
absence of understanding (as we
do in this country) we can't help
but create a very hating society.
People like Chris Hocker are in
very desperate need in this world
because it is such people who can
retrieve our lack of compassion
for mankind (here I refer to his
article about the Southern
University incident). The thoughts
which he expressed in his column
(Daily Nov. 21) valued greatly the
importance in communicating
honestly a very tragic event.
But when an event (such as
Southern University) is treated in
such a way as in the article by
Mike Enos (Daily, Nov. 27) or the
reply made by Rischa Williams
(Daily, Nov. 27) to Hocker's
article, then hate will continue to
exist while any attempt toward
creating a loving society will be
lost.
