# O'Toole Merits Watching

### ELLEN KENESHEA 
The problem with Peter
Medak's film "The Ruling Class"
is that the script is lucid but not
illuminating. Both Peter Barnes'
play and screeplay are amusing
but unfocused polemics against
the English aristocracy.
"The Ruling Class" tells of a
schizophrenic aristocrat named
Jack (Peter OToole) who thinks
he is the god of love, otherwise
known as J.C. His father is an earl
(Harry Andrews) who hangs
himself a little every night just for
the fun of it. One night he slips
and dies, and Jack inherits his
earldom.
The story then centers, more
or less, on uncle's efforts to have
Jack committed as soon as he has
produced an heir, and Jack's
wife's efforts to have him
pronounced sane before that date.
His wife wins, sort of. Jack gives
up his identity as the god of love,
but only to become the god of
ve'ngeances personified as Jack the
Ripper.
That's fine with the rest of
English nobility, says playwright
Barnes; they're right at home with
the new Jack and vice-versa. But
it's hard on those near and dear to
him, who end up dead, insane or
in politics.
Lacks Smooth Flow
This is all a terribly facile way
of dealing with things, and"The
Ruling Class" lacks the smooth
flow of inevitability in its fantasy,
and a fine cutting edge in its
satire.
Director Medak works his
material into an interesting if
overlong, film. There is nothing
spare or ascetic about 'The

Ruling Class." Pared to its core,
the film is built on
one-dimensional conceits posed
with such finality that they don't
encourage further thought or even
interest.
In order to avoid exposing the
trivial basis of the film, Medak
decks it out in full, even
overblown, regalia. He doesn't
quite succeed, for, though "The
Ruling Class" works grandly in
bits and pieces, it hasn't a driving
force to pace the whole.
Medak's strength here is in his
actors. They are exceptionally

fine, and, with few lapses, great
characters not caricatures. Their
quality is no small feat,
considering that the lines often
beg for self-parody.
Harry Andrews gives a brief
but incisive view of a gruff earl
who is forced to wear helmet and
sword when he'd rather be in a
tutu. Arthur Love plays the
family butler who inherits 30,000
pounds when the old earl dies,
and discovers in himself an
irascible inclination to uncover
the absurd in everyone else.
But it is O'Toole who carries

the film. Words flow out of him
like quicksilver. He can begin any
conversation quite rationally, but
before he is half-way into it he
loses himself to his language,
becoming what he says in a
beautifully mad way. He slips into
his delusions with such grace that
what is real merges in him with
what is only whim or fantasy.
Medak seems to have given
O'Toole full-reign, and rightly so,
for in spite of its flaws, "The
Rul.ng Class" is worth watching
for his performance alone.

tutu. Arthur Love plays the
family butler who inherits 30,000
pounds when the old earl dies,
and discovers in himself an
irascible inclination to uncover
the absurd in everyone else.
But it is O'Toole who carries

the film. Words flow out of him
like quicksilver. He can begin any
conversation quite rationally, but
before he is half-way into it he
loses himself to his language,
becoming what he says in a
beautifully mad way. He slips into
his delusions with such grace that
what is real merges in him with
what is only whim or fantasy.
Medak seems to have given
O'Toole full-reign, and rightly so,
for in spite of its flaws, "The
Rul.ng Class" is worth watching
for his performance alone.
The problem with Peter
Medak's film "The Ruling Class"
is that the script is lucid but not
illuminating. Both Peter Barnes'
play and screeplay are amusing
but unfocused polemics against
the English aristocracy.
"The Ruling Class" tells of a
schizophrenic aristocrat named
Jack (Peter OToole) who thinks
he is the god of love, otherwise
known as J.C. His father is an earl
(Harry Andrews) who hangs
himself a little every night just for
the fun of it. One night he slips
and dies, and Jack inherits his
earldom.
The story then centers, more
or less, on uncle's efforts to have
Jack committed as soon as he has
produced an heir, and Jack's
wife's efforts to have him
pronounced sane before that date.
His wife wins, sort of. Jack gives
up his identity as the god of love,
but only to become the god of
ve'ngeances personified as Jack the
Ripper.
That's fine with the rest of
English nobility, says playwright
Barnes; they're right at home with
the new Jack and vice-versa. But
it's hard on those near and dear to
him, who end up dead, insane or
in politics.
Lacks Smooth Flow
This is all a terribly facile way
of dealing with things, and"The
Ruling Class" lacks the smooth
flow of inevitability in its fantasy,
and a fine cutting edge in its
satire.
Director Medak works his
material into an interesting if
overlong, film. There is nothing
spare or ascetic about 'The

Ruling Class." Pared to its core,
the film is built on
one-dimensional conceits posed
with such finality that they don't
encourage further thought or even
interest.
In order to avoid exposing the
trivial basis of the film, Medak
decks it out in full, even
overblown, regalia. He doesn't
quite succeed, for, though "The
Ruling Class" works grandly in
bits and pieces, it hasn't a driving
force to pace the whole.
Medak's strength here is in his
actors. They are exceptionally

fine, and, with few lapses, great
characters not caricatures. Their
quality is no small feat,
considering that the lines often
beg for self-parody.
Harry Andrews gives a brief
but incisive view of a gruff earl
who is forced to wear helmet and
sword when he'd rather be in a
tutu. Arthur Love plays the
