# Diana 'Sings The Blues'

### DAN FORTE 
"Lady Sings The Blues," the story of jazz singer
Billie Holiday, will undoubtedly earn Diana Ross an
Academy Award nomination.
Although the film is highly fictionalized, good
music and good acting overshadow the
incongruities.
The film starts in 1936 with Billie, who was then
Eleanora Gough, being raped at age 14. In truth,
Billie Holiday was 21 years old in 1936, and
actually got raped at the age of 10, in 1925.
If you're thinking there's no way Diana Ross
could look 14, you're right. But, Ross' acting
was so good that the role was quite convincing. It
seemed as if Diana stole some of the mannerisms of
Stepin Fetchit for this segment.
The film follows the career of Billie Holiday
through her years as a prostitute, singer, and heroin
addict. Billie Holiday was the first black singer to
perform regularly with a white band.
Diana Ross handled all of the singing in the
movie with the exception of an old 78 of 'Tain't
Nobody's Business," which I think was supposed to
be Bessie Smith. (Whether or not it actually was
Bessie Smith's original 78 I couldn't tell.)
Rather than try to copy Billie Holiday's singing

style, Diana Ross chose to interpret the tunes in her
own way. Judging by the result, it was a smart
move.
Diana Ross sang such Lady Day standards as "All
of Me," "Gimme A Pigfoot and A Bottle of Beer,"
"God Bless The Child," which was later ruined by
Blood, Sweat, and Tears, and her own composition
"Strange Fruit" with its haunting lyrics describing
the bodies of lynched Negroes:
"Southern trees bearing strange fruit,
Blood on the leaves and blood at the roots.
Black bodies swining in the southern breeze,
Strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees."
Besides Diana's fine acting, the movie also
featured good work by Billy Dee Williams as Billie's
lover, and comedian Richard Pryor as Piano Man.
Sid Melton, Danny Thomas' manager on "Make
Room For Daddy," played the club owner.
I was surprised that this production, by
Motown's Berry Gordy, was not over-pitying. The
film concentrated on Billie Holiday, her music and
her life, rather than on "social commentary."
My own criticism is that the movie followed her
career up through her big Carnegie Hall concert, but
cut off before her days with Count Basie during the
forties.
