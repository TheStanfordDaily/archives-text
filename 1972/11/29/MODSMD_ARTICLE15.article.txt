# Spirited Mali Dancers
## 
### ANN MALMUTH 
The tam-tam is a drum made of sacrificial animal
skins. To its call the National Ensemble of the
Republic of Mali danced a landscape of its culture.
The tamtam evoked images of the tribal doctor's
pulse rising up from beneath his skin, or of thunder
roaring on the desert plains. Tam-tam lures the men
from their sleep and sacred masks from the gloomy
forests.
In Mali, an audience viewing the performance
which took place on November 19 at Flint Center,
may well have been killed, for many of the dances
were religious rites reserved for the elders and
priests. Tribesmen, bribed with feasts and gifts from
the government, consented to exhibit their culture
onstage.
Of the many dances presented the most
compelling was "The Possessed." Portrayed is the
failure of the tribal doctor to exorcise the Devil
from a young girl. Then arrives the "fetish man,"

the African wanderer in search of the Devil. He
succeeds in curing the girl, but not for long, for as
the drums resume their entrancing rhythm, the
whole village once again becomes possessed.
Unlike western dancers, this troupe makes little
attempt to achieve a martial execution of
pre-ordained choreography. Also, unlike western
art, these men and women are clearly and
abundantly enjoying themselves.
They bask in the applause and in one another's
company. They laugh and exchange jokes. The
movement is usually exciting, or strong and
graceful.
There are, however, occasional moments when
the performance threatens to descend into the
commonplace, such as when the dancers exhibit
their acrobatics. But these unspectacular times are
more than compensated for by the dancers' spirited
belief that they are just the opposite.
