# Poltl Rated As All-American Candidate
## 
### JIM WASCHER 
Randy Poltl doesn't look, act
or talk as a football player should.
This may be a function of the
unique football program here, but
it is more likely the result of
Poltl's own special character.
The red-haired strong safety's
abilities first became obvious
during the 1972 Rose Bowl, when
he made 14 tackles, ten of them
unassisted. Since then, Poltl has
been what Head Coach Jack
Christiansen calls'"an outstanding
performer." In the last week Poltl
was selected for the AP and UPI
All-Coast teams and for the
Pacific-B's All-Conference squad.
Both Christiansen and defensive
backs coach George Seifert agree
that the junior from Van Nuys
will be "an All-American
candidate" next season.
Poltl says he finds football
"really exciting." He looks
forward to playing the "mental
game" of trying to read the
differing offenses of each team he

faces. Most importantly, Poltl says
that football is "paying my way
through school."
Seifert says that in "athletic
ability," Poltl is one of "the top
two" young men he has "ever
dealt with" here or at Oregon,
where he coached up until last
year. Christiansen feels that Poltl
•is "potentially one of the most
outstanding defensive backs that
has ever played at Stanford."
According to the head coach,
Poltl has "a desire to excel in
football...(so) he dedicates himself
to doing the things he has to do to
improve himself."
Poltl says that he and the other
players are disappointed about the
way this season has turned out.
He adds that the team's poor
record has forced him to critically
reexamine his performance in
each game searching for what
might have been a game-turning
error.
New Coaching Staff
Both Poltl and Seifert say that
working under a new coaching
staff has handicapped the team's
efforts. However, Poltl feels that
"we developed a lot as a team this
year." Seifert adds that,
particularly because of the
coaching shifts, Poltl himself
"didn't reach his full potential
this year" even though "he
became better as the season
progressed."
According to Poltl,
Christiansen and his predecessor
as head coach, John Ralston,
"both have the same coaching
idea that has made Stanford
football unique." He says that
Christiansen "gives the players the
opportunity to run their own
team." Poltl feels that it is easier
to work under coaches who
essentially allow their players to
"take the responsibility" for their
discipline upon themselves rather
than under those who insist upon
strict rules.
'God You're Slow'
Discussing his game-saving
interception against Oregon State

this year, Poltl says he received
the normal, excited
congratulations from his
teammates until they returned to
their "usual" selves. "It was
funny," Poltl says, grinning. After
about a minute, "they started
coming up to me and saying 'God
you're slow-why didn't you
score?"'
Poltl says he still gets kidded
about a fluke play during this
year's SC game when he was hit in
the ankle by an errant Stanford
punt. The play, technically a
fumble, set up a Trojan
touchdown. Poltl says "there
wasn't anything I could do." He
remembers thinking "no-it
couldn't be me" as the ball hit
him. Poltl says he turned around
to see "this big, 300-pound
monster" fall on the ball.
Christiansen says that Poltl
"gets along well" with the other
players. "Everybody likes him."
Right halfback Craig Zaltosky
says Poltl is "an easy going guy"
who is "kind of quiet." According
to Zaltosky, Poltl is "good and he
doesn't say anything about it,
unlike some guys who aren't as
good as they say." Left halfback
Charles McCloud feels that Poltl is
"more open with the people he
knows better." He adds that, even
though his teammate is "down to
earth," he still "clowns a lot and is
a lot of fun."
Position Change
Christiansen says that Poltl
"might be moved to another

position in the defensive
backfield" next season. He
mentioned free safety as the most
likely alternative. Seifert says such
a move is "still possible," but
Poltl himself is reluctant. He says
"I wouldn't particularly want to"
switch, but adds that he would if
Christiansen asked him to. Poltl
says that after two years as a
strong safety, the position is "a
natural thing" for him.
Wherever he plays, Poltl says
he is looking forward to the next
season and particularly to the SC
game. Seifert recognizes Poltl's
"desire" for greater achievement
next year, adding that Poltl is
"willing to work hard" towards
any goal he sets for himself.
Poltl "wouldn't mind" playing
pro football, although "it's not
anything I plan on." Football
equipment manager Doc Marvin
says "I'm sure he could make
it...like Benny Barnes (a former
Stanford free safety now with the
Dallas Cowboys) did."
Christiansen says that Poltl
"definitely...has all the tools" to
play pro ball. The head coach
specifically mentioned Poltl's
"sprinter" speed, "his range, his
size and his tackling ability."
Poltl finds autumn quarters
difficult, particularly because of
the time-consuming nature of his
architecture major. "It's hard to
get as much out of school as you
would like" during the football
season.
During what little spare time
he has, Poltl plays the piano to

relax. Although he insists that he
taught himself, those who hear
him play come away convinced
that he has been professionally
tutored.
Christiansen gave the best
evaluation of Poltl, saying he i,s
"the type of young man that
makes coaching fun....1 wish we
had 49 other players like him."

He has been named to this year's AP and UPI All-Coast teams and to
the Pacific-B's All-Conference squad, and he is rated as an
All-American possibility next season.
Randy Poltl doesn't look, act
or talk as a football player should.
This may be a function of the
unique football program here, but
it is more likely the result of
Poltl's own special character.
The red-haired strong safety's
abilities first became obvious
during the 1972 Rose Bowl, when
he made 14 tackles, ten of them
unassisted. Since then, Poltl has
been what Head Coach Jack
Christiansen calls'"an outstanding
performer." In the last week Poltl
was selected for the AP and UPI
All-Coast teams and for the
Pacific-B's All-Conference squad.
Both Christiansen and defensive
backs coach George Seifert agree
that the junior from Van Nuys
will be "an All-American
candidate" next season.
Poltl says he finds football
"really exciting." He looks
forward to playing the "mental
game" of trying to read the
differing offenses of each team he

faces. Most importantly, Poltl says
that football is "paying my way
through school."
Seifert says that in "athletic
ability," Poltl is one of "the top
two" young men he has "ever
dealt with" here or at Oregon,
where he coached up until last
year. Christiansen feels that Poltl
•is "potentially one of the most
outstanding defensive backs that
has ever played at Stanford."
According to the head coach,
Poltl has "a desire to excel in
football...(so) he dedicates himself
to doing the things he has to do to
improve himself."
Poltl says that he and the other
players are disappointed about the
way this season has turned out.
He adds that the team's poor
record has forced him to critically
reexamine his performance in
each game searching for what
might have been a game-turning
error.
New Coaching Staff
Both Poltl and Seifert say that
working under a new coaching
staff has handicapped the team's
efforts. However, Poltl feels that
"we developed a lot as a team this
year." Seifert adds that,
particularly because of the
coaching shifts, Poltl himself
"didn't reach his full potential
this year" even though "he
became better as the season
progressed."
According to Poltl,
Christiansen and his predecessor
as head coach, John Ralston,
"both have the same coaching
idea that has made Stanford
football unique." He says that
Christiansen "gives the players the
opportunity to run their own
team." Poltl feels that it is easier
to work under coaches who
essentially allow their players to
"take the responsibility" for their
discipline upon themselves rather
than under those who insist upon
strict rules.
'God You're Slow'
Discussing his game-saving
interception against Oregon State

this year, Poltl says he received
the normal, excited
congratulations from his
teammates until they returned to
their "usual" selves. "It was
funny," Poltl says, grinning. After
about a minute, "they started
coming up to me and saying 'God
you're slow-why didn't you
score?"'
Poltl says he still gets kidded
about a fluke play during this
year's SC game when he was hit in
the ankle by an errant Stanford
punt. The play, technically a
fumble, set up a Trojan
touchdown. Poltl says "there
wasn't anything I could do." He
remembers thinking "no-it
couldn't be me" as the ball hit
him. Poltl says he turned around
to see "this big, 300-pound
monster" fall on the ball.
Christiansen says that Poltl
"gets along well" with the other
players. "Everybody likes him."
Right halfback Craig Zaltosky
says Poltl is "an easy going guy"
who is "kind of quiet." According
to Zaltosky, Poltl is "good and he
doesn't say anything about it,
unlike some guys who aren't as
good as they say." Left halfback
Charles McCloud feels that Poltl is
"more open with the people he
knows better." He adds that, even
though his teammate is "down to
earth," he still "clowns a lot and is
a lot of fun."
Position Change
Christiansen says that Poltl
"might be moved to another

position in the defensive
backfield" next season. He
mentioned free safety as the most
likely alternative. Seifert says such
a move is "still possible," but
Poltl himself is reluctant. He says
"I wouldn't particularly want to"
switch, but adds that he would if
Christiansen asked him to. Poltl
says that after two years as a
strong safety, the position is "a
natural thing" for him.
Wherever he plays, Poltl says
he is looking forward to the next
season and particularly to the SC
game. Seifert recognizes Poltl's
"desire" for greater achievement
next year, adding that Poltl is
"willing to work hard" towards
any goal he sets for himself.
Poltl "wouldn't mind" playing
pro football, although "it's not
anything I plan on." Football
equipment manager Doc Marvin
says "I'm sure he could make
it...like Benny Barnes (a former
Stanford free safety now with the
Dallas Cowboys) did."
Christiansen says that Poltl
"definitely...has all the tools" to
play pro ball. The head coach
specifically mentioned Poltl's
"sprinter" speed, "his range, his
size and his tackling ability."
Poltl finds autumn quarters
difficult, particularly because of
the time-consuming nature of his
architecture major. "It's hard to
get as much out of school as you
would like" during the football
season.
During what little spare time
he has, Poltl plays the piano to

relax. Although he insists that he
taught himself, those who hear
him play come away convinced
that he has been professionally
tutored.
Christiansen gave the best
evaluation of Poltl, saying he i,s
"the type of young man that
makes coaching fun....1 wish we
had 49 other players like him."

RANDY — Strong safety Randy Poltl is a junior from Van Nuys.
He has been named to this year's AP and UPI All-Coast teams and to
the Pacific-B's All-Conference squad, and he is rated as an
All-American possibility next season.
Randy Poltl doesn't look, act
or talk as a football player should.
This may be a function of the
unique football program here, but
it is more likely the result of
Poltl's own special character.
The red-haired strong safety's
abilities first became obvious
during the 1972 Rose Bowl, when
he made 14 tackles, ten of them
unassisted. Since then, Poltl has
been what Head Coach Jack
Christiansen calls'"an outstanding
performer." In the last week Poltl
was selected for the AP and UPI
All-Coast teams and for the
Pacific-B's All-Conference squad.
Both Christiansen and defensive
backs coach George Seifert agree
that the junior from Van Nuys
will be "an All-American
candidate" next season.
Poltl says he finds football
"really exciting." He looks
forward to playing the "mental
game" of trying to read the
differing offenses of each team he

faces. Most importantly, Poltl says
that football is "paying my way
through school."
Seifert says that in "athletic
ability," Poltl is one of "the top
two" young men he has "ever
dealt with" here or at Oregon,
where he coached up until last
year. Christiansen feels that Poltl
•is "potentially one of the most
outstanding defensive backs that
has ever played at Stanford."
According to the head coach,
Poltl has "a desire to excel in
football...(so) he dedicates himself
to doing the things he has to do to
improve himself."
Poltl says that he and the other
players are disappointed about the
way this season has turned out.
He adds that the team's poor
record has forced him to critically
reexamine his performance in
each game searching for what
might have been a game-turning
error.
New Coaching Staff
Both Poltl and Seifert say that
working under a new coaching
staff has handicapped the team's
efforts. However, Poltl feels that
"we developed a lot as a team this
year." Seifert adds that,
particularly because of the
coaching shifts, Poltl himself
"didn't reach his full potential
this year" even though "he
became better as the season
progressed."
According to Poltl,
Christiansen and his predecessor
as head coach, John Ralston,
"both have the same coaching
idea that has made Stanford
football unique." He says that
Christiansen "gives the players the
opportunity to run their own
team." Poltl feels that it is easier
to work under coaches who
essentially allow their players to
"take the responsibility" for their
discipline upon themselves rather
than under those who insist upon
strict rules.
'God You're Slow'
Discussing his game-saving
interception against Oregon State

this year, Poltl says he received
the normal, excited
congratulations from his
teammates until they returned to
their "usual" selves. "It was
funny," Poltl says, grinning. After
about a minute, "they started
coming up to me and saying 'God
you're slow-why didn't you
score?"'
Poltl says he still gets kidded
about a fluke play during this
year's SC game when he was hit in
the ankle by an errant Stanford
punt. The play, technically a
fumble, set up a Trojan
touchdown. Poltl says "there
wasn't anything I could do." He
remembers thinking "no-it
couldn't be me" as the ball hit
him. Poltl says he turned around
to see "this big, 300-pound
monster" fall on the ball.
Christiansen says that Poltl
"gets along well" with the other
players. "Everybody likes him."
Right halfback Craig Zaltosky
says Poltl is "an easy going guy"
who is "kind of quiet." According
to Zaltosky, Poltl is "good and he
doesn't say anything about it,
unlike some guys who aren't as
good as they say." Left halfback
Charles McCloud feels that Poltl is
"more open with the people he
knows better." He adds that, even
though his teammate is "down to
earth," he still "clowns a lot and is
a lot of fun."
Position Change
Christiansen says that Poltl
"might be moved to another

position in the defensive
backfield" next season. He
mentioned free safety as the most
likely alternative. Seifert says such
a move is "still possible," but
Poltl himself is reluctant. He says
"I wouldn't particularly want to"
switch, but adds that he would if
Christiansen asked him to. Poltl
says that after two years as a
strong safety, the position is "a
natural thing" for him.
Wherever he plays, Poltl says
he is looking forward to the next
season and particularly to the SC
game. Seifert recognizes Poltl's
"desire" for greater achievement
next year, adding that Poltl is
"willing to work hard" towards
any goal he sets for himself.
Poltl "wouldn't mind" playing
pro football, although "it's not
anything I plan on." Football
equipment manager Doc Marvin
says "I'm sure he could make
it...like Benny Barnes (a former
Stanford free safety now with the
Dallas Cowboys) did."
Christiansen says that Poltl
"definitely...has all the tools" to
play pro ball. The head coach
specifically mentioned Poltl's
"sprinter" speed, "his range, his
size and his tackling ability."
Poltl finds autumn quarters
difficult, particularly because of
the time-consuming nature of his
architecture major. "It's hard to
get as much out of school as you
would like" during the football
season.
During what little spare time
he has, Poltl plays the piano to

relax. Although he insists that he
taught himself, those who hear
him play come away convinced
that he has been professionally
tutored.
Christiansen gave the best
evaluation of Poltl, saying he i,s
"the type of young man that
makes coaching fun....1 wish we
had 49 other players like him."
