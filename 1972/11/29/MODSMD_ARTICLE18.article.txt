Laird Announces Draft Calls
WASHINGTON — Secretary of Defense Melvin R. Laird
announced yesterday final draft calls of fewer than
10,000 men next year before military conscription is
ended June 30 and the nation shifts to an all-volunteer
force.
Laird said inductions will be spread over a five-month
period between February and June with no one to be
drafted in January.
Selective Service officials said those who would be
called first would be young men with lottery numbers up
to 95 in this year's pool who lost their deferments late
this year. However, the law provides that they may be
drafted only up to March 31.
Beyond that, the officials said those holding lottery
numbers over 40 in next year's pool can consider
themselves safe from the draft.
In announcing the draft call at a Pentagon news
conference, Laird urged Congress to approve his plan to
give enlistment and re-enlistment bonuses to men and
women signing up for the National Guard and Reserves.
Without it, he said, Congress may have to pass a special
law to draft men into the Reserves once the current
Selective Service Act expires June 30.
U.S. Bombs Hit Viet Hamlet
SAIGON — A mistaken U.S. bombing just south of Da
Nang took a heavy toll of Vietnamese civilian casualties
yesterday and wrecked a hamlet, the U.S. Command
reported.
The Saigon command said the casualty toll rose to 21
civilians killed. More than a score of civilians were
wounded. The U.S. Command said 29, the Saigon
command 23.
Both commands said 30 homes were destroyed and 50
others were heavily damaged. The U.S. Command said
two Air Force fighter-bombers and four Navy attack
planes were involved in the mistaken bombing, the worst
reported in several months. Field reports said up to ten
500-pound bombs hit the settlement west of Hoi An
about 15 miles south of Da Nang. The cause of the
accident is under investigation.
South Vietnamese marines and paratroopers to the
north battled to extend their positions in Quang Tri
Province, South Vietnam's northernmost territory that
was overrun in North Vietnam's spring offensive. U.S. 852
bombers backed them with blanket bombing runs.
Moscow Air Crash Kills 60
MOSCOW — A Japan Air Lines jet lifting into the wintry
sky over Moscow's international airport crashed in a ball
of fire last night, killing most of the 76 persons aboard.
The official Soviet news agency Tass reported 16
persons were hospitalized. It was feared the other 60
passengers and crew members died in a fiery plunge into
the snow near Sheremetyevo Airport.
An American Embassy officer said two Americans were
among the survivors. The two were receiving emergency
treatment at Moscow's Botkin hospital, he said, but their
identities or condition were not immediately available.
Officials of Japan Air Lines in Moscow were unable to
say whether any Americans were among the killed because
the on board passenger list carried no mention of
nationality.

Last night's JAL flight 446 originated in Copenhagen.
It had just taken off for a long haul over Siberia to Tokyo
when, for unexplained reasons, it burst into flames. It
plunged 400 feet into the snow-covered ground 2 x h miles
from the airport.
Harvard Professor Freed
BOSTON — Harvard Prof. Samuel L. Popkin, who was
jailed because he refused to answer a grand jury's
questions about the release of the Pentagon Papers, was
freed yesterday after a week in jail.
Popkin, whose sentence was to have lasted as long as
18 months or until the grand jury disbanded, said grand
juries in this country "have become the government's tool
for gathering intelligence."
Popkin was released from the Norfolk County Jail in
Dedham, Mass., after the federal grand jury which has
investigated the Pentagon Papers' release for most of this
year disbanded in Boston without returning an
indictment.
He had been cited for contempt of court for refusing
to answer questions about the once-secret reports on U.S.
involvement in Indochina.
Popkin, a 30-year-old assistant professor of
government, has researched U.S. involvement in Vietnam
and was an associate of Daniel Ellsberg, a professor at
Massachusetts Institute of Technology and one of two
men on trial in connection with the Pentagon Papers
publication.
Magee Jury To Be Sequestered
SAN FRANCISCO — A judge's decision to sequester the
jury for the Ruchell Magee trial was criticized sharply by
attorneys for both sides yesterday, but Judge Morton
Colvin refused to reconsider.
Defense attorney Robert Carrow, who said the lengthy
seclusion would create "a hanging jury," announced he
would seek a reversal today at the state Court of Appeals.
Colvin's order means the 12 jurors and two alternates
will be secluded together and live under guard at a San
Francisco hotel unable to be with family or friends for the
duration of the trial. The judge estimated the trial will last
seven to 11 weeks, possibly longer, through the holidays.
Colvin sealed his findings in the decision and refused
Carrow's bid to see them. In court, the judge cited news
media publicity over the case as his reason, without
elaborating. Magee was absent for most of Tuesday, the
second day of his trial in the kidnap and murder of Marin
County Superior Court Judge Harold J. Haley on Aug. 7,
1970.
He was ousted twice and put in a holding cell to listen
over a loudspeaker to proceedings, first when he began
whistling and second when he began shouting protests at
one of Colvin's remarks.
Magee slugged Carrow and knocked him over Monday,
and the judge warned yesterday if Magee becomes violent
again he will order the defendant handcuffed.
"I did not swing at him," Magee shouted. "I was trying
to break his face in."
Today's Weather
Fair through tomorrow but with late night and morning
fog increasing tomorrow morning. Lows tonight in the 30s
to low 40s. Highs both days in the upper 50s to low 60s.
Light wind.
