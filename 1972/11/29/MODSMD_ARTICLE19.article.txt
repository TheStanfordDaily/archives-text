"My first big decision after being
appointed was who to go out to coffee
with," Anne Miner, University
Affirmative Action Officer, told a
group of fifteen at a luncheon
discussion on sex roles in the
Clubhouse yesterday.
Explaining the statement to the
YWCA sponsored gathering, Miner said
she found herself to be the only
woman administrator in the office and
was unsure whether she was supposed
to go for coffee with the men, the
other administrators, or the women,
their secretaries.
"I resolved it by going out to coffee
all of the time, with anyone," she said.
After citing this example as one of
the more subtle of the attitudes
affecting women, she turned more
seriously to the question of
discrimination against women and
stated that it is these subtle
discriminations that are interesting,
and not the overt discrimination
"everyone knows about and is
boring."
Misguided 'Guidance'
These discriminations include the
"guidance" of advisers who steer
women away from fields such as
engineering, and the constant picturing
of engineers as males.

"As far as we can tell, there is no
discrimination in graduate school
admissions," she said.
She also cited as important factors
in such cases peer pressure and the fear
felt by women, more in the past than
presently, of appearing "unfeminine,
or desiring to be like males, or seeming
to hate them."
Women Hard Pressed
Women also associate aggression
with hostility, she said, and therefore

are hard pressed to succeed in the
business world.
"Men must also learn how to relate
to women as their peers," she added.
Miner, a 1962 Radcliffe graduate,
worked before her June appointment
on the report on the Academic
Employment of Women at Stanford
for President Richard Lyman.
No Malicious Lying
"The bureaucracy at Stanford may
be slow, but there is none of the
malicious and deliberate lying and
secrecy I've seen in many of the
institutions back East," she said.
She expressed the belief that both
President Lyman and acting President
William Miller are very open and have
progressive attitudes toward women.
Because the University is
decentralized it is hard to implement
changes in attitudes and policies
because often no formal policies even
exist, she said.
She stated that she thinks positive
change regarding women in the
University system should be achieved
by placing "agents for change" in the
already existing structure instead of
adding a special office to it "which
could easily be ignored."
The YWCA plans to continue the
luncheon series discussions next
quarter on a weekly basis.

felt by women, more in the past than
presently, of appearing "unfeminine,
or desiring to be like males, or seeming
to hate them."
Women Hard Pressed
Women also associate aggression
with hostility, she said, and therefore

are hard pressed to succeed in the
business world.
"Men must also learn how to relate
to women as their peers," she added.
Miner, a 1962 Radcliffe graduate,
worked before her June appointment
on the report on the Academic
Employment of Women at Stanford
for President Richard Lyman.
No Malicious Lying
"The bureaucracy at Stanford may
be slow, but there is none of the
malicious and deliberate lying and
secrecy I've seen in many of the
institutions back East," she said.
She expressed the belief that both
President Lyman and acting President
William Miller are very open and have
progressive attitudes toward women.
Because the University is
decentralized it is hard to implement
changes in attitudes and policies
because often no formal policies even
exist, she said.
She stated that she thinks positive
change regarding women in the
University system should be achieved
by placing "agents for change" in the
already existing structure instead of
adding a special office to it "which
could easily be ignored."
The YWCA plans to continue the
luncheon series discussions next
quarter on a weekly basis.


ANNE MINER
"My first big decision after being
appointed was who to go out to coffee
with," Anne Miner, University
Affirmative Action Officer, told a
group of fifteen at a luncheon
discussion on sex roles in the
Clubhouse yesterday.
Explaining the statement to the
YWCA sponsored gathering, Miner said
she found herself to be the only
woman administrator in the office and
was unsure whether she was supposed
to go for coffee with the men, the
other administrators, or the women,
their secretaries.
"I resolved it by going out to coffee
all of the time, with anyone," she said.
After citing this example as one of
the more subtle of the attitudes
affecting women, she turned more
seriously to the question of
discrimination against women and
stated that it is these subtle
discriminations that are interesting,
and not the overt discrimination
"everyone knows about and is
boring."
Misguided 'Guidance'
These discriminations include the
"guidance" of advisers who steer
women away from fields such as
engineering, and the constant picturing
of engineers as males.

"As far as we can tell, there is no
discrimination in graduate school
admissions," she said.
She also cited as important factors
in such cases peer pressure and the fear
felt by women, more in the past than
presently, of appearing "unfeminine,
or desiring to be like males, or seeming
to hate them."
