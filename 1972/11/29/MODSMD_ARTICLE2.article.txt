# SGES Head Advises
## Ph.D. Time Limit Not Rigid 
### DOYLE McMANUS 
The chairman of the Study of
Graduate Education at Stanford said
last night that the study's
recommendation for four-year Ph.D. is
"by no means a rigid rule."
"Certainly there's going to have to
be some flexibility," Assistant Dean of
Graduate Study J. Merrill Carlsmith
said on KZSU's "Campus Conference"
program. "The main point of that
recommendation is for each
department to clearly spell out how
much time it should be taking to finish
the Ph.D. — the clarity is the
important thing.
"I don't think that we're ever going
to see that the Ph.D. is given in four
years, or even in less than
four-and-a-half or five years. But it's
the ones that take eight years, twelve
years, fourteen years that are worrying
me."
The length of the graduate program
will still vary department by
department if the SGES
recommendations are adopted fully,
Carlsmith said. But, he admitted, "I
suppose there will be some inroads on
departmental autonomy."
The SGES report, completed last
March and now under consideration
by the Faculty Senate, also deals with

graduate enrollment of minorities and
women. In addition, it redefines the
concept of the dissertation, and
clarifies the status of Ph.D. candidates.
On The Increase
"Minority enrollment is perceptibly
on the increase — I can't but be
confident about the hope there,"
Carlsmith said. "Probably the easiest
way to increase the enrollment of
women is to increase the number of
women who are applying; we've found
that virtually all departments accept
roughly the [same] proportion of
women [as of men] who apply.
"A few departments are now
advertising for women applicants, and
a few others are going through their
literature to see if they can eliminate
any unintended sexism.
"In some departments any change
is going to be slow. I'm not confident
that we're going to see any overnight
transformation of graduate education,
but I'm confident that the change is
going to take place eventually."
Humanities Want Book
"There definitely has to be some
redefinition of the dissertation,"
Carlsmith said. "One of the problems
that the humanities have had is that
their concept of what a dissertation is
has been a book — and a major book.

That takes an awful lot of time."
The study also recommended that
graduate students be given a clear
decision by their second year of study
on admission to Ph.D. candidacy.
"In talking to graduate students,
you find that there really does exist a
widespread nervousness about status,"
Carlsmith noted. "There could easily
be a decision by the second year, and
the Faculty Senate has accepted that
recommendation.
"The thrust of our programs ought
to remain pretty much what they are,
overall. We're among the very best of
the graduate institutions."
