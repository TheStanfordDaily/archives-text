# Nixon Begins Cabinet Shakeup; Names Richardson Defense Chief
## 
### 
CAMP DAVID, Md. (AP) - President
Nixon launched his sweeping
second-term Cabinet shakeup
yesterday by naming administration
veteran Elliot L. Richardson to be the
next secretary of Defense.
To succeed Richardson as the
secretary of Health, Education and

Welfare, Nixon said he will nominate
Caspar Weinberger who is now director
of the Office of Management and
Budget.
Completing a triple-header
announcement, the President named
millionaire industrialist Roy Ash,
president of Litton Industries, to
succeed Weinberger in the
Cabinet-level OMB post.
The selections of Richardson and
Weinberger are subject to confirmation
by the Senate when it returns in
January. Ash does not need Senate
confirmation.
Part Of Intensive Review
Press secretary Ronald L. Ziegler,
disclosing the personnel changes to
newsmen, said: "These three
announcements come at a time when
an intensive review is being undertaken
of the entire government structure and
they are part of the President's broad
plan to bring fresh perspective and
new vitality to the second four years
of his administration."
Richardson, 52, has been HEW
chief since 1970.
Long active in Republican politics
in Massachusetts, the erudite
Richardson was lieutenant governor

and attorney general of that state in
the 19605.
Weinberger, 55, joined the Nixon
team in 1970 as chairman of the
Federal Trade Commission after
serving as director of finance for
Nixon's native state of California.
Like Richardson a Harvard
graduate, he became deputy director
of OMB when the agency was created
on July 1, 1970, and moved up to the
top job last May when George Shultz
became secretary of the Treasury.
Weinberger will be expected by
Nixon to "bring about further
efficiencies within HEW," Ziegler said.
Ziegler said Richardson also will
have a mandate to try to slim down
the Defense budget.
Litton President
Ash, perhaps the least known of the
trio of appointees, co-founded Litton
Industries of Beveny Hills, Caiif., in
1953 and has been its president since
1961.
Responding to inquiries, Ziegler
said Ash will resign as Litton president
Dec. 9 and would divest himself of his
considerable stockholdings in the
company.
During the first two years of the
Nixon administration, Ash served as

chairman of Nixon's Advisory Council
on Executive Organization — a
part-time job.
Couldn't Refuse
Richardson said at a Washington
news conference "I would liked to
have had the opportunity to stay here
at HEW longer" but Nixon's offer of
the Defense post came as the latest in
a series "that I have not been able to
refuse."
He added that Nixon "convinced
me that if I could survive nearly 2Vi
years in HEW, I could probably get
along at the Defense Department."
Richardson had nothing to say on
his plans as Defense secretary and no
questions on this subject were
permitted.
"I have thought this was the worst
job in Washington,"he told newsmen.
Under ground rules set by the
White House, Weinberger refused to
discuss how he would run HEW,
pending Senate confirmation hearings.
On a rainy day here, Nixon spent
much of his time discussing his
reorganization plans with a series of
official visitors, taking time out for a
telephone conference with Vietnam
peace negotiator Henry A. Kissinger
back in Washington.

Richardson was lieutenant governor

and attorney general of that state in
the 19605.
Weinberger, 55, joined the Nixon
team in 1970 as chairman of the
Federal Trade Commission after
serving as director of finance for
Nixon's native state of California.
Like Richardson a Harvard
graduate, he became deputy director
of OMB when the agency was created
on July 1, 1970, and moved up to the
top job last May when George Shultz
became secretary of the Treasury.
Weinberger will be expected by
Nixon to "bring about further
efficiencies within HEW," Ziegler said.
Ziegler said Richardson also will
have a mandate to try to slim down
the Defense budget.
Litton President
Ash, perhaps the least known of the
trio of appointees, co-founded Litton
Industries of Beveny Hills, Caiif., in
1953 and has been its president since
1961.
Responding to inquiries, Ziegler
said Ash will resign as Litton president
Dec. 9 and would divest himself of his
considerable stockholdings in the
company.
During the first two years of the
Nixon administration, Ash served as

chairman of Nixon's Advisory Council
on Executive Organization — a
part-time job.
Couldn't Refuse
Richardson said at a Washington
news conference "I would liked to
have had the opportunity to stay here
at HEW longer" but Nixon's offer of
the Defense post came as the latest in
a series "that I have not been able to
refuse."
He added that Nixon "convinced
me that if I could survive nearly 2Vi
years in HEW, I could probably get
along at the Defense Department."
Richardson had nothing to say on
his plans as Defense secretary and no
questions on this subject were
permitted.
"I have thought this was the worst
job in Washington,"he told newsmen.
Under ground rules set by the
White House, Weinberger refused to
discuss how he would run HEW,
pending Senate confirmation hearings.
On a rainy day here, Nixon spent
much of his time discussing his
reorganization plans with a series of
official visitors, taking time out for a
telephone conference with Vietnam
peace negotiator Henry A. Kissinger
back in Washington.
CAMP DAVID, Md. (AP) - President
Nixon launched his sweeping
second-term Cabinet shakeup
yesterday by naming administration
veteran Elliot L. Richardson to be the
next secretary of Defense.
To succeed Richardson as the
secretary of Health, Education and

Welfare, Nixon said he will nominate
Caspar Weinberger who is now director
of the Office of Management and
Budget.
Completing a triple-header
announcement, the President named
millionaire industrialist Roy Ash,
president of Litton Industries, to
succeed Weinberger in the
Cabinet-level OMB post.
The selections of Richardson and
Weinberger are subject to confirmation
by the Senate when it returns in
January. Ash does not need Senate
confirmation.
Part Of Intensive Review
Press secretary Ronald L. Ziegler,
disclosing the personnel changes to
newsmen, said: "These three
announcements come at a time when
an intensive review is being undertaken
of the entire government structure and
they are part of the President's broad
plan to bring fresh perspective and
new vitality to the second four years
of his administration."
Richardson, 52, has been HEW
chief since 1970.
Long active in Republican politics
in Massachusetts, the erudite
Richardson was lieutenant governor

and attorney general of that state in
the 19605.

Federal Trade Commission after
