# Student Senate Approves '72-'73 Budget
## 
### TERRY ANZUR 
Last night the ASSU Senate
approved the 1972-1973 ASSU Budget
and By-Law revisions concerning the
Publications Board, clearing the way
for the possible publication of an
ASSU Course Review this year.
Twenty-five senators present at the
meeting passed the budget proposals
by a 19-6 vote. The approved
amendments will reappropriate $225
for administrative costs involved in the
preparation of the ASSU Course

Review.
The Senate passed the Pub Board
revisions by a 22-1 vote. The approved
amendments and revisions enable
student publications not represented
on the board to become members. The
Pub Board member publications now
include the Chaparral, the Daily, the
Quad, the Sequoia, the ASSU Course
Review and The Real News.
Senators Charles Ogletree, David
Levine, Jim Yedor, Glen Jacobs, and
Mike Herman will represent the Senate

as members of the Board.
A motion to eliminate all salaries
for student officers failed 19-6.
Senators Ogletree, Yedor, Reed,
Dorothy Rosenberg, and Dan Fitch
were named to a committee to study
the possibility of offering an academic
credit option to officers and setting up
a scholarship fund with the money
saved in salaries.
The proposed system would
eliminate tuition grants and salaries for

the ASSU Council of Presidents and
the Student Financial Manager which
total over $11,000 per year, and
respective salaries of $635 and $180 of
the Senate Chairman and
Parliamentarian.
Senator Bob Barker reported an
ASSU expenditure of $346 to pay
gambling debts of former ASSU
President Doug McHenry last March.
Meal Card Abuse
Financial Manager Sara Moore
assured the Senate that she would
investigate this charge. She also said
use of meal cards paid for by the
students for the ASSU Presidents
would be reviewed. "Last year it was
totally abused," she commented.
The Senate also voted 12-8 to
retain control of a $36,000 student fee
assessment passed last spring for
increased power and new equipment at
KZSU. KZSU's request to transfer the
money to its University account was
denied under the Voluntary Banking
Amendment, which requires all fee
assessments to be deposited with the
ASSU unless released by vote of the
Senate.
In a rare unanimous vote, the
Senate extended the deadline for Daily
independence from Jan. 1 to Feb. 1 of
next year. Students voted for Daily
independence in elections held Oct.

5-6. Because certification of the
election results was delayed, the
Daily's incorporation process was held
up.
The Senate approved numerous
committee appointments last night.

Elections Commissioner Mike Nilsson
and Senators Dave Garvin and Tom
Flohr were named to the Nominations
Committee, and will submit
nominations to the Senate for all
student committee positions.

on the board to become members. The
Pub Board member publications now
include the Chaparral, the Daily, the
Quad, the Sequoia, the ASSU Course
Review and The Real News.
Senators Charles Ogletree, David
Levine, Jim Yedor, Glen Jacobs, and
Mike Herman will represent the Senate

as members of the Board.
A motion to eliminate all salaries
for student officers failed 19-6.
Senators Ogletree, Yedor, Reed,
Dorothy Rosenberg, and Dan Fitch
were named to a committee to study
the possibility of offering an academic
credit option to officers and setting up
a scholarship fund with the money
saved in salaries.
The proposed system would
eliminate tuition grants and salaries for

the ASSU Council of Presidents and
the Student Financial Manager which
total over $11,000 per year, and
respective salaries of $635 and $180 of
the Senate Chairman and
Parliamentarian.
Senator Bob Barker reported an
ASSU expenditure of $346 to pay
gambling debts of former ASSU
President Doug McHenry last March.
Meal Card Abuse
Financial Manager Sara Moore
assured the Senate that she would
investigate this charge. She also said
use of meal cards paid for by the
students for the ASSU Presidents
would be reviewed. "Last year it was
totally abused," she commented.
The Senate also voted 12-8 to
retain control of a $36,000 student fee
assessment passed last spring for
increased power and new equipment at
KZSU. KZSU's request to transfer the
money to its University account was
denied under the Voluntary Banking
Amendment, which requires all fee
assessments to be deposited with the
ASSU unless released by vote of the
Senate.
In a rare unanimous vote, the
Senate extended the deadline for Daily
independence from Jan. 1 to Feb. 1 of
next year. Students voted for Daily
independence in elections held Oct.

5-6. Because certification of the
election results was delayed, the
Daily's incorporation process was held
up.
The Senate approved numerous
committee appointments last night.

Elections Commissioner Mike Nilsson
and Senators Dave Garvin and Tom
Flohr were named to the Nominations
Committee, and will submit
nominations to the Senate for all
student committee positions.
Last night the ASSU Senate
approved the 1972-1973 ASSU Budget
and By-Law revisions concerning the
Publications Board, clearing the way
for the possible publication of an
ASSU Course Review this year.
Twenty-five senators present at the
meeting passed the budget proposals
by a 19-6 vote. The approved
amendments will reappropriate $225
for administrative costs involved in the
preparation of the ASSU Course

Review.
The Senate passed the Pub Board
revisions by a 22-1 vote. The approved
amendments and revisions enable
student publications not represented
on the board to become members. The
Pub Board member publications now
include the Chaparral, the Daily, the
Quad, the Sequoia, the ASSU Course
Review and The Real News.
