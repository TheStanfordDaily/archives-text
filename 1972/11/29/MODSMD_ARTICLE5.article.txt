# Halligan Prosecutes CJP Cases, Advises Police
## 
### BOB FUSS 
The burgeoning caseload of the
Campus Judicial Panel (CJP) and the
impending deputization of some
Stanford Department of Public Safety
employees prompted President
Richard Lyman to appoint another
legal adviser over the summer.
The new assistant staff counsel to
the President, 27-year-old Jerry
Halligan, will prosecute most CJP cases
which arise this year, advise Director
of Public Safety Marvin Herrington on
legal matters, and perform general
duties under Legal Adviser James
Siena.
Last year, the CJP caseload
occupied special Assistant to the
President John Schwartz full-time,
removing him from other assigned
duties and overworking both Schwartz
and Siena.
Halligan has not yet obtained
practical experience with the CJP, but
believes it is a "fairly good system,
better than what they had before. It is
a fair system and the hearing officer
feature is particularly efficient."
The former real estate attorney
attended a recent Placement Center
demonstration against recruiting by
Honeywell Corp. in his prosecutorial
capacity, and observed that
demonstrators inside the building were
"consciously thinking about how far
they could go."
Contrasted With Spring Riots
Halligan contrasted the docile
an ti-Honeywell protest with
demonstrations he witnessed in the
spring of 1970, while attending the

Stanford Law School. When he first
saw Sheriff's deputies in tactical gear,
Halligan recalled, "I couldn't believe
how armed the cops were. Some had
shotguns, and they especially shook
me up."
He also remembered an incident
near the Undergraduate Library when
he watched a group of demonstrators
in "a destructive frenzy." He said that
he wanted to ask, "Hey guys, what the
hell are you doing that for?," but did
not.
One man did try to stop people
throwing rocks, according to Halligan.
"I think he was carried away to the
hospital."
According to Schwartz, the
University hired its new attorney
partly because "we needed someone to
acquire some expertise in the law and
the proper operation of the Police
Department," especially in light of the
impending deputization, which will
confer full police power on some
Stanford officers.
Job Only Advisory
Halligan will advise the department
on legal aspects of the rules,
procedures, and operation of the
Department of Public Safety, but will
have no command authority with the
department, Schwartz said.
Herrington noted that Halligan has
no background in criminal law and law
enforcement, and so will not affect the
department significantly until he
learns these areas.
In addition to his dual duties with
Herrington and the CJP, Halligan will

work at general legal tasks assigned by
Schwartz and Siena.
Bored With Job
Halligan came to work for the
University after becoming "bored with
mortgages" while working in the real
estate section of Rutan and Tucker, a
45-man Orange County law firm. He
complains that he had no clients of his
own and dealt with paper rather than
people, "spending most of my time
making rich people richer."
He alleviated the boredom by
organizing, along with other attorneys,
a legal aid group for students at the
University of California's Irvine
campus.
Because he now works with a

broader range of questions involving
constitutional, criminal, and agency
law, Halligan believes he now practices
"in a far more intellectually
challenging way than the last few
years." But now, he says, he has "one
client — President Lyman."
After growing up in Seattle,
Halligan studied as an undergraduate
at the University of Washington and
worked as a ski instructor at a nearby
resort.
He majored in finance at
Washington, but decided on a career in
law after considering the "poor salaries
available with a B.A. in business."
When he entered the California
bar he specialized in real estate law.
