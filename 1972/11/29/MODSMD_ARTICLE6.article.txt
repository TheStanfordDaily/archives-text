## Southern U. 
### 
The much discussed "information explosion" of the past
decade has made tragic news a regular part of almost every
day. People in our society can now learn almost immediately
of news events happening anywhere in the world. These
advances in communication have obvious benefits, but one
liability is that many people have become callous and
apathetic about the news.
Nearly two weeks have passed since the deplorable
killings of two black students at Southern University. This
tragedy must not be allowed to quickly slip into oblivion,
for what happened in Baton Rouge has importance far
beyond that one sad day.
Three things are illustrated by the events at Southern.
First of all, racism in this country and especially in the
South is not dead. Attica, Orangesburg, Jackson and now
Baton Rouge are grim reminders of the hatred which exists
in our society.
The fight against racism in large part depends on the
federal government. Unfortunately, President Nixon has
demonstrated a deplorable and* regressive attitude towards
civil rights during his term in office. Given this record at the
executive level, we echo the urgings of Stanford's Black
Students Union for a congressional investigation of what
happened in Baton Rouge. Nixon has formed what is
possibly the most political Justice Department of this
century and its credibility is very low in our eyes. Similarly,
we have little faith in a Louisiana state investigation, given
the insensitivity displayed in recent weeks by Gov. Edwin
Edwards. A congressional investigation is sorely needed.
Secondly, the tragedy shows the need for more sane law
enforcement practices on all college campuses. There was
absolutely no excuse for deputies in Baton Rouge to carry
shotguns and live ammunition. Tear gas cannisters could just
as easily been used and, if they had, there wouldn't have
been any room for "error."
Policemen should be allowed to come onto campuses
with drawn weapons only when there is evidence of a sniper
or someone who is directly endangering human lives. There
was absolutely no such evidence of armed students at
Southern. Until uniform, humane and rational police
procedures are established for all this string of
tragedies will continue.
Finally, the killings in Baton Rouge illustrate the
problems confronting black colleges in the South. The black
presidents at many black public colleges have been chosen
because of their ability to please white governors and white
legislatures. As black students and faculty members have
become more and more politically active during the last
decade, a big gap between them and their presidents has
been evident at many schools in the South.
This gap is epitomized by Southern's president, Dr. Leon
Nettervilie, who responded to the demands of his students
by calling in the police. Since the killings, Nettervilie has
continued to show how out of touch he is by attempting to
purge those faculty members who actively supported the
student demands.
The only realistic solution to this problem is to replace
politically outdated administrators with people more in
touch with the current black movement. Unfortunately,
white legislators and governors are almost certain to strongly
oppose attempts by students and faculty members for more
self-determination. But those students and faculty members
must continue their struggle, if black colleges are to survive
as viable institutions of higher learning.
The killings at Southern were a very predictable product
of American racism. What happened on Nov. 16 must not be
forgotten as quickly as past tragedies. The horror of
Southern must be used as a reminder to all Americans that
we still have a long way to go.

of news events happening anywhere in the world. These
advances in communication have obvious benefits, but one
liability is that many people have become callous and
apathetic about the news.
Nearly two weeks have passed since the deplorable
killings of two black students at Southern University. This
tragedy must not be allowed to quickly slip into oblivion,
for what happened in Baton Rouge has importance far
beyond that one sad day.
Three things are illustrated by the events at Southern.
First of all, racism in this country and especially in the
South is not dead. Attica, Orangesburg, Jackson and now
Baton Rouge are grim reminders of the hatred which exists
in our society.
The fight against racism in large part depends on the
federal government. Unfortunately, President Nixon has
demonstrated a deplorable and* regressive attitude towards
civil rights during his term in office. Given this record at the
executive level, we echo the urgings of Stanford's Black
Students Union for a congressional investigation of what
happened in Baton Rouge. Nixon has formed what is
possibly the most political Justice Department of this
century and its credibility is very low in our eyes. Similarly,
we have little faith in a Louisiana state investigation, given
the insensitivity displayed in recent weeks by Gov. Edwin
Edwards. A congressional investigation is sorely needed.
Secondly, the tragedy shows the need for more sane law
enforcement practices on all college campuses. There was
absolutely no excuse for deputies in Baton Rouge to carry
shotguns and live ammunition. Tear gas cannisters could just
as easily been used and, if they had, there wouldn't have
been any room for "error."
Policemen should be allowed to come onto campuses
with drawn weapons only when there is evidence of a sniper
or someone who is directly endangering human lives. There
was absolutely no such evidence of armed students at
Southern. Until uniform, humane and rational police
procedures are established for all this string of
tragedies will continue.
Finally, the killings in Baton Rouge illustrate the
problems confronting black colleges in the South. The black
presidents at many black public colleges have been chosen
because of their ability to please white governors and white
legislatures. As black students and faculty members have
become more and more politically active during the last
decade, a big gap between them and their presidents has
been evident at many schools in the South.
This gap is epitomized by Southern's president, Dr. Leon
Nettervilie, who responded to the demands of his students
by calling in the police. Since the killings, Nettervilie has
continued to show how out of touch he is by attempting to
purge those faculty members who actively supported the
student demands.
The only realistic solution to this problem is to replace
politically outdated administrators with people more in
touch with the current black movement. Unfortunately,
white legislators and governors are almost certain to strongly
oppose attempts by students and faculty members for more
self-determination. But those students and faculty members
must continue their struggle, if black colleges are to survive
as viable institutions of higher learning.
The killings at Southern were a very predictable product
of American racism. What happened on Nov. 16 must not be
forgotten as quickly as past tragedies. The horror of
Southern must be used as a reminder to all Americans that
we still have a long way to go.
The much discussed "information explosion" of the past
decade has made tragic news a regular part of almost every
day. People in our society can now learn almost immediately
of news events happening anywhere in the world. These
advances in communication have obvious benefits, but one
liability is that many people have become callous and
