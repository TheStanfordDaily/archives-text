# 'unjustified harassment'
## Citizens Stopped By Police 
### 
Coming from Oklahoma,
last week's Thanksgiving was
particularly satisfying. Toward
midnight, our gathering of close
friends broke up, and one friend
began to walk home the two
blocks from my house on the edge
of campus (Stanford Ave.) to his
dorm in which he is an R.A.
On the way he was stopped by
a Santa Clara County Deputy and
questioned. By this officer's
account, the incident took 15
minutes; by an independent
account (a girl in the dorm
watching her R.A. being
"questioned"), it took 25.
My friend who was stopped
not only produced a student body
card with, of course, his picture
on it, but also was carrying a
rather heavy law book he was

using in one of his classes in the
law school. Nonetheless, the
officer's suspicion apparently
continued, and, in the interest of
protecting the "public" from
danger I suppose, he called the
"suspect's" name into the
all-knowing computer. The officer
discovered, of course, that the
computer had nothing on the
"suspect," and finally my friend
was generously allowed to
continue on to his dorm.
New Policy
When I subsequently called the
police station and talked to the
officer involved, he told me that
stopping people walking on the
streets was a policy established by
the Santa Clara Deputies because
of the high crime rate in the area.
He went on to say that, in fact,

eroger boesche

they stopped anyone they saw on
a street such as Bowdoin so late
(midnight) at night.
When I pointed out that I have
walked that street many times in
the last year (and often much
later in the evening), and, in
addition, have seen police cars
drive by quite often but have
never yet been stopped, he gave
no coherent response. I then
proceeded to ask whether the fact
that my close friend is black had
anything to do with his looking
suspicious, but of course the
police officer denied that.
It seems more than apparent to
me that the racist tinge of this
incident goes far toward
explaining why the original
suspicion far outweighed such
things as a student body card, a
law book, and an innocent walk
home after a Thanksgiving dinner.
No Justification
But for the moment let's
assume there is no racist element.
What possible justification can
there be for police officers
stopping people out walking at
night? Other than the case in
which there has been a crime just
reported in the immediate area,
there can be no justification for
such "questioning," and there can
never be justification for such
harassment. Do people who steal
things really walk with a law book
in their hands, or do they more
often drive away in a car? And to
those who think this is a small
thing: what threatens our liberties
more, an occasional stolen
transistor radio or community
acquiescence in policemen
stopping for questioning anyone
doing such eccentric things as
taking a walk at midnight in his
own neighborhood?

officer's suspicion apparently
continued, and, in the interest of
protecting the "public" from
danger I suppose, he called the
"suspect's" name into the
all-knowing computer. The officer
discovered, of course, that the
computer had nothing on the
"suspect," and finally my friend
was generously allowed to
continue on to his dorm.
New Policy
When I subsequently called the
police station and talked to the
officer involved, he told me that
stopping people walking on the
streets was a policy established by
the Santa Clara Deputies because
of the high crime rate in the area.
He went on to say that, in fact,

eroger boesche

they stopped anyone they saw on
a street such as Bowdoin so late
(midnight) at night.
When I pointed out that I have
walked that street many times in
the last year (and often much
later in the evening), and, in
addition, have seen police cars
drive by quite often but have
never yet been stopped, he gave
no coherent response. I then
proceeded to ask whether the fact
that my close friend is black had
anything to do with his looking
suspicious, but of course the
police officer denied that.
It seems more than apparent to
me that the racist tinge of this
incident goes far toward
explaining why the original
suspicion far outweighed such
things as a student body card, a
law book, and an innocent walk
home after a Thanksgiving dinner.
No Justification
But for the moment let's
assume there is no racist element.
What possible justification can
there be for police officers
stopping people out walking at
night? Other than the case in
which there has been a crime just
reported in the immediate area,
there can be no justification for
such "questioning," and there can
never be justification for such
harassment. Do people who steal
things really walk with a law book
in their hands, or do they more
often drive away in a car? And to
those who think this is a small
thing: what threatens our liberties
more, an occasional stolen
transistor radio or community
acquiescence in policemen
stopping for questioning anyone
doing such eccentric things as
taking a walk at midnight in his
own neighborhood?

Coming from Oklahoma,
last week's Thanksgiving was
particularly satisfying. Toward
midnight, our gathering of close
friends broke up, and one friend
began to walk home the two
blocks from my house on the edge
of campus (Stanford Ave.) to his
dorm in which he is an R.A.
On the way he was stopped by
a Santa Clara County Deputy and
questioned. By this officer's
account, the incident took 15
minutes; by an independent
account (a girl in the dorm
watching her R.A. being
"questioned"), it took 25.
My friend who was stopped
not only produced a student body
card with, of course, his picture
on it, but also was carrying a
rather heavy law book he was

using in one of his classes in the
law school. Nonetheless, the
officer's suspicion apparently
continued, and, in the interest of
protecting the "public" from
danger I suppose, he called the
"suspect's" name into the
all-knowing computer. The officer
