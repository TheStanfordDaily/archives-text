EuroMed
may oiler RX via
overseas training
For the session starting Fall, 1973,
the European Medical Students
Placement Service, Inc. will assist
qualified American students in
gaining admission to recognized
overseas medical schools.
And that's just the beginning.
Since the language barrier constitutes
the preponderate ditficulty in succeed
ing at a foreign school, the Euromed
program also includes an intensive
8-12 week medical and conversational
language course, mandatory for all
students. Five hours daily, the course
is given in the country where the stu
dent will attend medical school.
In addition, the European Medical
Students Placement Service provides
students with an 8-12 week intensive
cultural orientation course, with Amer
ican students now studying medicine
in that particular country serving as
counselors.
Senior or graduate students currently
enrolled in an American university are
eligible to participate in the Euromed
program.
