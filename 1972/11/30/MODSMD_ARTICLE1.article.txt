# Workshop To Investigate Industrial Conversion
## 
### BRUCE KADDEN 
"Peace can only become a reality if
people can make their living in
life-enhancing rather than
life-destroying industries," states the
description of SWOPSI course 150.
Officially titled "Influence of
Defense Industry on the Midpeninsula:
A Community Action Project," the
workshop will confront the problem
of converting industry to products and
services that meet domestic social
needs, rather than military needs.
The class is part of a larger project,

based on the same idea, involving a
cross-section of people in the
midpeninsula area.
"Everyone from members of
political action groups to unemployed
engineers will be working on this
project," said Conway Collis, on
whose idea the program is based, and
who will be one of the course's
instructors.
"This project will help the
undereducated, as well as the highly
skilled by training or retraining them
as needed," he continued.

The community program will be
divided into two parts: "Town Hall"
meetings and study groups. The
meetings will be sponsored by a
number of legislators on a non-partisan
basis and by action-oriented groups in
the area. People in the community will
be able to get together to discuss the
problems, air their complaints and
make suggestions.
The study groups will be a
continuous project in which engineers
and other people will take in all the
various ideas and try to achieve
workable changes in specific areas.
Currently, Collis sees the
midpeninsula covering the area from
San Mateo to San Jose, but he said the
boundaries were very flexible.
Collis said that representatives of
industries that will be affected will
work along with the study groups.
"Most industries understand the
problem," he said, "but unless it is
feasible to switch over they will
remain defense-oriented."
One of the reasons Collis believes
previous endeavors have failed is that

they have been directed against the
industries. Instead, he suggests
legislative action, by proposing bills
that would establish socially
acceptable contracts.
"If we expect them (the industries)
to convert, we'd better give them
contracts they'll bid for," he insisted.
Good Response
Collis believes politicians on the
local, state and national levels will
make commitments to the people and
work for proposed legislation. He has
talked with many already and is
pleased by their response, but he
cannot release any names.
Collis pointed out two specific
projects — low cost housing in the
midpeninsula area and a pollution
contror program — which will be
included in the conversion.
"The need for a program such as
this is obvious," Collis said. "We are
the wealthiest country in the world
yet we have 23 million illiterate
children. Our schools are grossly
overcrowded, yet we build TFX
airplanes instead of more schools.
"For the cost of every TFX

airplane we could build 13 elementary
schools. With one month's Vietnam
budget we could retrain 100,000
scientists.
"We can change these facts along
with reducing unemployment at no
cost to the community if we change
our priorities."
Need Organization
Collis, a second year graduate
student in law, also said that powerful
interest groups must be built. "The
people are there, but they must be
organized.
"Everyone is becoming dissatisfied
with available jobs, air pollution,
crime, and so forth. It's only a matter
of time before they realize they are all
losing for the same reasons."
The SWOPSI course is offered to
give Stanford students a chance to
participate in the project. During
winter quarter the workshop will
consist of "half study projects and half
action." By spring quarter the course
should be completely action, he said.
Students can get three to five units
credit for the workshop, which will
meet Tuesday evenings at 7:30 in

room 62N, beginning Jan. 9.
Bob Davis, a second year graduate
student in the combined business-law
program, will be teaching the course
along with Collis. Prof. Anthony
Amsterdam is the workshop's sponsor.
Community Involvement
Assisting Collis and Davis will be
Frederick Baron, also a graduate
student in law, who is working mainly
on the various aspects of community
involvement.
Collis thought of the idea for the
project after receiving a fellowship
from the Carnegie Foundation for
International Peace.
He knew there "had to be concrete
ways for our ideals to become reality,"
and came up with this program.
If all goes well, the project could
become a national model for
conversion from defense-related
industries to socially beneficial
industries.
Collis said he expects "relatively
quick results" and promises a
publication at the end of winter
quarter which will describe the
conversion process.
