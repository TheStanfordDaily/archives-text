'Forum Lacked Moderation'
Editor:
1 was greatly disturbed by the
Daily's "Abortion Forum" of
Nov. 17, initially because of the
predominance of male
contributors, but more deeply
because of the conspicuous
neglect of more moderate points
of view. I did not respond sooner
because I could not find the right
words, but I found those words
finally in an excerpt from a book
by gynecologist Boyd Cooper.
(Sex Without Tears, pp. 21-22) He
recounts his first abortion, which
he performed to save the mother's
life:
"The procedure, which called
for an incision in the lower
abdominal wall, was similar to the
operation by which Caesarean
deliveries are made, and rather
matter-of-factly I prepared for
surgery. I had done many
Caesarians before and had the
confidence born of successful
experience. Then as I slipped my
gloved hand into Lisa's uterus and
cupped it around the unborn fetus
everything changed.
"I brought the baby, encased
in its sac, out of Lisa's
unconscious body, and as I looked
at it I trembled and broke into a
cold sweat. Had this been a
routine abortion early in
pregnancy, I would have had little
more than an unformed mass to
remove. But, after four months of
prenatal development, this was a
perfectly formed miniature baby,
with its legs, arms and head all
recognizable. And within its
glistening sac, it struggled to stay
alive. By separating it from its

mother, I ended its life.
"For weeks I was haunted by
the memory of the struggling life
that I had ended. What I had done
was contrary to everything I had
been taught in my home, my
church and my professional
training. The ethics of my
profession were strongly
imprinted on me, and they still
are. After months of
soul-searching, however, I found a
new meaning in those ethics. I
learned that the value of life itself,
as a mere body count, is not the
ultimate judgment for a doctor. I
came to believe that it is the
quality of life, not its mere
existence, that matters."

(Editor's Note: The Daily does
not intend to "neglect" certain
points of view. For our Forum
pages, we essentially take what
articles are available, and people
with strongly developed views are
usually more willing to write. The
purpose of our Forum pages is to
stimulate debate, not necessarily
to present a completely balanced
point-of-view.)
'Lou Ebner: We Sit In
Awe Of You Also'
Editor:
May I recommend "Ebner, The
Impractical Stylist" (Daily, Nov.
22)?
This letter, though boring, is
short.
