# 'no more sloppy elections'
## 'Current ASSU Administration Is Different' 
### 
; michael j. nilsson

This year as every year, the
ASSU will hold several elections.
In the past, the ASSU has been
plagued by mismanagement and
general incompetence on the part
of the elections commissioner. As
a result of these problems, many
conflicts within the government
have been created and have caused

the ASSU to "sag" immeasurably.
Students have responded to this
egregious system with caustic
criticism of student government
and all the persons connected
therewith.
Apathy, a much overused but
still applicable word, has taken its
toll on this campus. Witness our

last election (Oct. 5 and 6). Only
2,171 students voted out of an
eligible 11,700. This is a typical
indication of the participation
level in all the previous elections I
can recall.
Students often wonder how
this attitude developed. I can see
only one logical answer: at one

point, ASSU officers treated the
government as a joke, used it
merely to get into graduate
schools and didn't care whom
they appointed to the
administrative offices. If this was
the kind of treatment elected
officials gave the students, how
could they expect any better
treatment in return?
This was the pattern for several
years. Whatever the officers
decided or wanted to do, the
students didn't give a damn about.
Sure, elections continued but the
turnouts were so insignificant in
many cases that it would have
been more economical to the
students not to have had them.
Elections Costly
This brings up another
disturbing point. The elections
used to be relatively inexpensive,
now it costs nearly $400
every time the ballot boxes are
dusted off and put out. Why? The
elections commissioner used to be
able to get volunteers to work.
Due to the fact that so many of
the elections have been poorly
handled and very few students
want to be readily associated with
them, we now have to pay the
workers $2 per hour.
There are six polling places,
four of which are open four hours
a day, the other two for six hours
per day; the polls are open for
two days; and there are two
persons at each polling place. This
all adds up to $224 in general
labor expenses. Add to that total
the commission's salary, cost of
ballot counters, computer time,
printing costs and you have nearly
enough money to buv two shares
of IBM.
Considering the quality of the
past ASSU governments, the
elections just aren't that good an
investment. The governments
haven't offered much in the way
of dividends — they haven't even
provided the students with
minimally competent persons to
fulfill the routine jobs created by
a government.
After this substandard
performance of the previous
governments, you may wonder
what is being, done this year that
is any different from the past. I
am not going to criticize or praise

the current administration,
because I myself am working to
insure that it will not be like all
the others have been. I know that
it is not following the established
path of mediocrity. Eventually
many other students will also
come to realize its numerous
strong points.
As it is now, the ASSU
government is only noticed when
students feel something has been
done poorly. If the students took
note of the decent things that are
being done instead of dwelling on
the shortcomings; if they would
help the various officers with the
projects they are involved with,
then and only then will the ASSU
be able to avoid total ignominy.
When I assumed my office last
spring, I was immediately
surrounded by a political
controversy. What power does the
Elections Commissioner have? Is
his appointment legitimate? What
are his political leanings? These
were questions I heard and read
over and over again.
Appointment Confusion
I honestly don't care what
powers I have or don't have, as
long as I can constitutionally do
what I am supposed to do. At the
time I was appointed, the Senate
was so unconcerned that it wasn't
able to get a quorum to approve
the appointment. Then a faction
of the Senate came forward and
bitched and screamed bloody
murder because I was holding the
office.
My particular office is an
administrative one. I refuse to
take sides on any campus political
questions. I do not support any of
the candidates for office. I merely
operate the mechanism through
which political questions are
settled and officers are chosen.
After examining the records of
my predecessors, this statement
may seem dubious. However, I
can assure you that I have no
desire to follow in their
footsteps. It is my immediate
concern to see to it that this
year's elections do not fall into
the same miserable category as
last year's and I am going to do
just that!

Considering the quality of the
past ASSU governments, the
elections just aren't that good an
investment. The governments
haven't offered much in the way
of dividends — they haven't even
provided the students with
minimally competent persons to
fulfill the routine jobs created by
a government.
After this substandard
performance of the previous
governments, you may wonder
what is being, done this year that
is any different from the past. I
am not going to criticize or praise

the current administration,
because I myself am working to
insure that it will not be like all
the others have been. I know that
it is not following the established
path of mediocrity. Eventually
many other students will also
come to realize its numerous
strong points.
As it is now, the ASSU
government is only noticed when
students feel something has been
done poorly. If the students took
note of the decent things that are
being done instead of dwelling on
the shortcomings; if they would
help the various officers with the
projects they are involved with,
then and only then will the ASSU
be able to avoid total ignominy.
When I assumed my office last
spring, I was immediately
surrounded by a political
controversy. What power does the
Elections Commissioner have? Is
his appointment legitimate? What
are his political leanings? These
were questions I heard and read
over and over again.
Appointment Confusion
I honestly don't care what
powers I have or don't have, as
long as I can constitutionally do
what I am supposed to do. At the
time I was appointed, the Senate
was so unconcerned that it wasn't
able to get a quorum to approve
the appointment. Then a faction
of the Senate came forward and
bitched and screamed bloody
murder because I was holding the
office.
My particular office is an
administrative one. I refuse to
take sides on any campus political
questions. I do not support any of
the candidates for office. I merely
operate the mechanism through
which political questions are
settled and officers are chosen.
After examining the records of
my predecessors, this statement
may seem dubious. However, I
can assure you that I have no
desire to follow in their
footsteps. It is my immediate
concern to see to it that this
year's elections do not fall into
the same miserable category as
last year's and I am going to do
just that!

This year as every year, the
ASSU will hold several elections.
In the past, the ASSU has been
plagued by mismanagement and
general incompetence on the part
of the elections commissioner. As
a result of these problems, many
conflicts within the government
have been created and have caused

the ASSU to "sag" immeasurably.
Students have responded to this
egregious system with caustic
criticism of student government
and all the persons connected
therewith.
Apathy, a much overused but
still applicable word, has taken its
toll on this campus. Witness our

last election (Oct. 5 and 6). Only
2,171 students voted out of an
eligible 11,700. This is a typical
indication of the participation
level in all the previous elections I
can recall.
Students often wonder how
this attitude developed. I can see
only one logical answer: at one

point, ASSU officers treated the
government as a joke, used it
merely to get into graduate
schools and didn't care whom
they appointed to the
administrative offices. If this was
the kind of treatment elected
officials gave the students, how
could they expect any better
treatment in return?
This was the pattern for several
years. Whatever the officers
decided or wanted to do, the
students didn't give a damn about.
Sure, elections continued but the
turnouts were so insignificant in
many cases that it would have
been more economical to the
students not to have had them.
Elections Costly
This brings up another
disturbing point. The elections
used to be relatively inexpensive,
now it costs nearly $400
every time the ballot boxes are
dusted off and put out. Why? The
elections commissioner used to be
able to get volunteers to work.
Due to the fact that so many of
the elections have been poorly
handled and very few students
want to be readily associated with
them, we now have to pay the
workers $2 per hour.
There are six polling places,
four of which are open four hours
a day, the other two for six hours
per day; the polls are open for
two days; and there are two
persons at each polling place. This
all adds up to $224 in general
labor expenses. Add to that total
the commission's salary, cost of
ballot counters, computer time,
printing costs and you have nearly
enough money to buv two shares
of IBM.

This year as every year, the
ASSU will hold several elections.
In the past, the ASSU has been
plagued by mismanagement and
general incompetence on the part
of the elections commissioner. As
a result of these problems, many
conflicts within the government
have been created and have caused

the ASSU to "sag" immeasurably.
Students have responded to this
egregious system with caustic
criticism of student government
and all the persons connected
therewith.
Apathy, a much overused but
still applicable word, has taken its
toll on this campus. Witness our

last election (Oct. 5 and 6). Only
2,171 students voted out of an
eligible 11,700. This is a typical
indication of the participation
level in all the previous elections I
can recall.
Students often wonder how
this attitude developed. I can see
only one logical answer: at one

point, ASSU officers treated the
government as a joke, used it
merely to get into graduate
schools and didn't care whom
they appointed to the
administrative offices. If this was
the kind of treatment elected
officials gave the students, how
could they expect any better
treatment in return?
This was the pattern for several
years. Whatever the officers
decided or wanted to do, the
students didn't give a damn about.
Sure, elections continued but the
turnouts were so insignificant in
many cases that it would have
been more economical to the
students not to have had them.
Elections Costly
This brings up another
disturbing point. The elections
used to be relatively inexpensive,
now it costs nearly $400
every time the ballot boxes are
dusted off and put out. Why? The
elections commissioner used to be
able to get volunteers to work.
Due to the fact that so many of
the elections have been poorly
handled and very few students
want to be readily associated with
them, we now have to pay the
workers $2 per hour.
There are six polling places,
four of which are open four hours
a day, the other two for six hours
per day; the polls are open for
two days; and there are two
persons at each polling place. This
all adds up to $224 in general
labor expenses. Add to that total
the commission's salary, cost of
ballot counters, computer time,
printing costs and you have nearly
enough money to buv two shares
of IBM.
Considering the quality of the
past ASSU governments, the
elections just aren't that good an
investment. The governments
haven't offered much in the way
of dividends — they haven't even
provided the students with
minimally competent persons to
fulfill the routine jobs created by
a government.
After this substandard
performance of the previous
governments, you may wonder
what is being, done this year that
is any different from the past. I
am not going to criticize or praise

the current administration,
because I myself am working to
insure that it will not be like all
the others have been. I know that
it is not following the established
path of mediocrity. Eventually
many other students will also
come to realize its numerous
strong points.
As it is now, the ASSU
government is only noticed when
students feel something has been
done poorly. If the students took
note of the decent things that are
being done instead of dwelling on
the shortcomings; if they would
help the various officers with the
projects they are involved with,
then and only then will the ASSU
be able to avoid total ignominy.
When I assumed my office last
spring, I was immediately
surrounded by a political
controversy. What power does the
Elections Commissioner have? Is
his appointment legitimate? What
are his political leanings? These
were questions I heard and read
over and over again.
Appointment Confusion
I honestly don't care what
powers I have or don't have, as
long as I can constitutionally do
what I am supposed to do. At the
time I was appointed, the Senate
was so unconcerned that it wasn't
able to get a quorum to approve
the appointment. Then a faction
of the Senate came forward and
bitched and screamed bloody
murder because I was holding the
office.
My particular office is an
administrative one. I refuse to
take sides on any campus political
questions. I do not support any of
the candidates for office. I merely
operate the mechanism through
which political questions are
settled and officers are chosen.
After examining the records of
my predecessors, this statement
may seem dubious. However, I
can assure you that I have no
desire to follow in their
footsteps. It is my immediate
concern to see to it that this
year's elections do not fall into
the same miserable category as
last year's and I am going to do
just that!
