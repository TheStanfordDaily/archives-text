# New Bicycle Lane Construction Starts
## 
### 
Weather permitting, work will
proceed on approximately
$150,000 worth of eight-foot
bicycle pathways and additional
campus lighting, John Lerry,
manager of construction and
engineering has reported.
On the schedule for the
remainder of fall quarter as well as
winter and spring are:
—Completion of the Campus
Drive pathway between Cowell
Health Center and Stanford
Medical Center;
- Completion of paths along
both sides of Escondido Road
between Galvez Street and
Stanford Ave.;
—A connection between the
west campus and Menlo Park via
the Old Searsville Road and
Willow Road;

—A path between Campus
Drive and Quarry Road; and
—Another along Arboretum
Road between Galvez and Palm
Drive.
All new pathways, Lerry said,
will be eight feet wide for
maximum safety of two-way
pedestrian and bicycle traffic.
Lighting of the pathways is
under private contract with a
completion date of next March.
Pathways will be installed as work
load and weather permits by the
Plant Services Department.
The pathway and lighting
system has been worked out
jointly by the Planning Office, the
President's Advisory Committee
on Parking and Traffic, and
Marvin Herrington, director of
police services.
