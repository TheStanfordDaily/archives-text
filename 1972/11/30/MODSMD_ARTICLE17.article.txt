Most writers are neither born
nor made; they evolve and at
some point jell. In the case of the
man who, until 1933, was known
as Eric Blair and thereafter wrote
under the pseudonym of "George
Orwell," this evolution was
marked by a late start and by a
long apprenticeship. Blair/Orwell's
first full length work — Down and
Out in Paris and London (1933) —
was not written until the author
was thirty, and was published
only after several rejections and
months of rewriting.
Significantly, Peter Stansky
and William Abrahams end their
work with the publication of
"Down and Out" and the
emergence of George Orwell.
For The Unknown Orwell, in
contrast to all too many literary
biographies, does not take the
easy way out; it does not assume
that the young Blair contained
and was nurturing the seeds for
the later Orwell; as the authors
take pains to point out, the path
from Blair to Orwell was not only
not inevitable, but circuitous and
bumpy.
One influence on Orwell,
however, was there almost from
the beginning: the sensitivity to
class, be it Eric Blair's priggishness
over the "smelly" children of
factory workers or his own
anxieties at St. Cyprian and Eton
at belonging to the
"lower-upper-middle class," as he
sardonically called it.
It was perhaps the Blair
sensitivity at being at the very
bottom of the aristocracy that
helped him adjust to and stick it
out at the bottom during the
"down and out" days.
If throughout the public school
years the writer was not "there"
in Blair, he was "fermenting" in
numerous school sketches and
compositions, in a certain
irreverence, questioning spirit,
cynicism.
The young Blair was also
marked by a strong degree of
inwardness, not so much
soul-searching introspection as

years of writing a story in my
mind. One evidence of this
tendency is the fact that the
authors have precious little
autobiographical material to go
on; Blair pre-Orwell wrote only a
handful of essays and reviews, few
letters, and apparently no diary or
journal.
Moreover, apart from a few
visits to a brothel, it appears that
Eric Blair had a rather limited sex
life, and no affairs or even lasting
"relationships" before becoming
Orwell. Indeed, we learn that until
his marriage in 1936, he felt the
closest woman in his life was his
mother.
Sheltered Blair
For about half of this book, we
are offered a rather sheltered
Blair, supported by his parents'
financial sacrifices in the elitist
world of St. Cyprian and Eton.
With his graduation from the
latter, however, Blair broke
sharply from both his past and
with the normal path that young
men of his intelligence and class
were expected to take — to the
university.
Like his father, he entered the
imperial service, in time becoming
an Assistant Superintendent of
Police in Burma. While
acknowledging the pragmatic
reasons for this decision — Blair's
family's financial problems and
that he had little desire or
aptitude for college — they go on
to note that "Not going to the
university was a decisive part in
the making of the writing."
Burmese Days notwithstand
ing, Blair did not experience
paroxisms of anti-imperialist
sentiments during his five years
(1922-27) in Burma. Yet,
although externally a-political, he
was affected by certain troubling
incidents like seeing a coolie
beaten when Blair had first landed
in Rangoon. The day-to-day sense
of being unwanted, of being the
alien oppressor who was to be
resisted by oblique shows of
contempt and cold silence left a
lasting impression on him. As the
authors put it, with regard to the
"Burmese days," but with
implications which go beyond,
"His response to Burma was
a very moving demonstration
that, for him, personal
consideration (the particular

experience) was more
important than political
considerations (the abstract
experience) and that he had to
move through the former to
arrive at the latter."
Tough-Mindedness
The renunciation of academia,
and later of the imperial
bureaucracy, insured that Blair's
and later Orwell's
tough-mindedness would be
rooted in experience rather than
in institutions or ideology.
The process of "becoming a
writer" took another five years,
and was marked by months of
indecision, mediocre outlook, and
recurring failure. The decision to
go "down and out," which,
according to the authors, began as
a combination of "economic
necessity and literary curiosity"
was within a year reduced to the
former.
The romanticism of poverty, of
the gentleman-cum-tramp, wore
off quickly. Though Blair could
have received financial aid from
an aunt in Paris, a combination of
pride and tenacity led him to the
life of a plogeur, or dishwasher.
"He had to blast from his
consciousness the invented or
synthetic character.... At the
bottom, where "I had chosen to
be, one took bottom jobs." To be
effective in depicting the world
around him, the autobiographical
writer could not assume a pose; he
had to get dirty hands.
Finally Published
After coming back to England,
he tapped out "Down and Out" in
nine months, saw it rejected,
endured some more poverty,
rewrote the work, saw it rejected
again, and finally, thanks to some
rather chance connections, saw
the book published. By the
long apprenticeship's end, Biair
had learned to endure and to
make creative use of the ironies,
frustrations, and pains of that
endurance. Only then could Eric

Blair become George Orwell.
The Unknown Orwell is
beautifully written, refreshingly
free of academese and pseudo
-psychoanalytic pretensions. Its'
style is succinct and frequently
witty. Describing Blair's rather
mediocre early poems, for
example, the authors note, 'Their
tone was cynical; their language,
banal; their ironies predictable. It
was as though sub-Maugham
subjects had been set to
sub-Housman verse."
Social History Too
The book may be enjoyed as
social history as well as
biography: the sketches of English
public schools in the first fifth of
this century, and of a dying
colonialism in Burma, especially
as it affected the middle and
lower bureaucracy, are especially
effective. One wishes only for
some more photographs and for
some more discussion of Blair's
inter-personal relationships,
especially with women — there
must be more than this.
Yet these are irritations in light
of the thoroughness and
readability of this book: our best
grasp yet of 'The Unknown
Orwell" makes the work of the
"known Orwell," the fiction,
essays, and journalistic pieces,
that much more alluring.

are offered a rather sheltered
Blair, supported by his parents'
financial sacrifices in the elitist
world of St. Cyprian and Eton.
With his graduation from the
latter, however, Blair broke
sharply from both his past and
with the normal path that young
men of his intelligence and class
were expected to take — to the
university.
Like his father, he entered the
imperial service, in time becoming
an Assistant Superintendent of
Police in Burma. While
acknowledging the pragmatic
reasons for this decision — Blair's
family's financial problems and
that he had little desire or
aptitude for college — they go on
to note that "Not going to the
university was a decisive part in
the making of the writing."
Burmese Days notwithstand
ing, Blair did not experience
paroxisms of anti-imperialist
sentiments during his five years
(1922-27) in Burma. Yet,
although externally a-political, he
was affected by certain troubling
incidents like seeing a coolie
beaten when Blair had first landed
in Rangoon. The day-to-day sense
of being unwanted, of being the
alien oppressor who was to be
resisted by oblique shows of
contempt and cold silence left a
lasting impression on him. As the
authors put it, with regard to the
"Burmese days," but with
implications which go beyond,
"His response to Burma was
a very moving demonstration
that, for him, personal
consideration (the particular

experience) was more
important than political
considerations (the abstract
experience) and that he had to
move through the former to
arrive at the latter."
Tough-Mindedness
The renunciation of academia,
and later of the imperial
bureaucracy, insured that Blair's
and later Orwell's
tough-mindedness would be
rooted in experience rather than
in institutions or ideology.
The process of "becoming a
writer" took another five years,
and was marked by months of
indecision, mediocre outlook, and
recurring failure. The decision to
go "down and out," which,
according to the authors, began as
a combination of "economic
necessity and literary curiosity"
was within a year reduced to the
former.
The romanticism of poverty, of
the gentleman-cum-tramp, wore
off quickly. Though Blair could
have received financial aid from
an aunt in Paris, a combination of
pride and tenacity led him to the
life of a plogeur, or dishwasher.
"He had to blast from his
consciousness the invented or
synthetic character.... At the
bottom, where "I had chosen to
be, one took bottom jobs." To be
effective in depicting the world
around him, the autobiographical
writer could not assume a pose; he
had to get dirty hands.
Finally Published
After coming back to England,
he tapped out "Down and Out" in
nine months, saw it rejected,
endured some more poverty,
rewrote the work, saw it rejected
again, and finally, thanks to some
rather chance connections, saw
the book published. By the
long apprenticeship's end, Biair
had learned to endure and to
make creative use of the ironies,
frustrations, and pains of that
endurance. Only then could Eric

Blair become George Orwell.
The Unknown Orwell is
beautifully written, refreshingly
free of academese and pseudo
-psychoanalytic pretensions. Its'
style is succinct and frequently
witty. Describing Blair's rather
mediocre early poems, for
example, the authors note, 'Their
tone was cynical; their language,
banal; their ironies predictable. It
was as though sub-Maugham
subjects had been set to
sub-Housman verse."
Social History Too
The book may be enjoyed as
social history as well as
biography: the sketches of English
public schools in the first fifth of
this century, and of a dying
colonialism in Burma, especially
as it affected the middle and
lower bureaucracy, are especially
effective. One wishes only for
some more photographs and for
some more discussion of Blair's
inter-personal relationships,
especially with women — there
must be more than this.
Yet these are irritations in light
of the thoroughness and
readability of this book: our best
grasp yet of 'The Unknown
Orwell" makes the work of the
"known Orwell," the fiction,
essays, and journalistic pieces,
that much more alluring.

Most writers are neither born
nor made; they evolve and at
some point jell. In the case of the
man who, until 1933, was known
as Eric Blair and thereafter wrote
under the pseudonym of "George
Orwell," this evolution was
marked by a late start and by a
long apprenticeship. Blair/Orwell's
first full length work — Down and
Out in Paris and London (1933) —
was not written until the author
was thirty, and was published
only after several rejections and
months of rewriting.
Significantly, Peter Stansky
and William Abrahams end their
work with the publication of
"Down and Out" and the
emergence of George Orwell.
For The Unknown Orwell, in
contrast to all too many literary
biographies, does not take the
easy way out; it does not assume
that the young Blair contained
and was nurturing the seeds for
the later Orwell; as the authors
take pains to point out, the path
from Blair to Orwell was not only
not inevitable, but circuitous and
bumpy.
One influence on Orwell,
however, was there almost from
the beginning: the sensitivity to
class, be it Eric Blair's priggishness
over the "smelly" children of
factory workers or his own
anxieties at St. Cyprian and Eton
at belonging to the
"lower-upper-middle class," as he
sardonically called it.
It was perhaps the Blair
sensitivity at being at the very
bottom of the aristocracy that
helped him adjust to and stick it
out at the bottom during the
"down and out" days.
If throughout the public school
years the writer was not "there"
in Blair, he was "fermenting" in
numerous school sketches and
compositions, in a certain
irreverence, questioning spirit,
cynicism.
The young Blair was also
marked by a strong degree of
inwardness, not so much
soul-searching introspection as

years of writing a story in my
mind. One evidence of this
tendency is the fact that the
authors have precious little
autobiographical material to go
on; Blair pre-Orwell wrote only a
handful of essays and reviews, few
letters, and apparently no diary or
journal.
Moreover, apart from a few
visits to a brothel, it appears that
Eric Blair had a rather limited sex
life, and no affairs or even lasting
"relationships" before becoming
Orwell. Indeed, we learn that until
his marriage in 1936, he felt the
closest woman in his life was his
mother.

endured some more poverty,

The Unknown Orwell is
beautifully written, refreshingly
free of academese and pseudo

style is succinct and frequently
witty. Describing Blair's rather
mediocre early poems, for

tone was cynical; their language,
banal; their ironies predictable. It
was as though sub-Maugham
subjects had been set to
sub-Housman verse."
Social History Too
The book may be enjoyed as
social history as well as
biography: the sketches of English
public schools in the first fifth of
this century, and of a dying
colonialism in Burma, especially
as it affected the middle and
lower bureaucracy, are especially
effective. One wishes only for
some more photographs and for
some more discussion of Blair's
inter-personal relationships,
especially with women — there
must be more than this.
Yet these are irritations in light
of the thoroughness and
readability of this book: our best
grasp yet of 'The Unknown
Orwell" makes the work of the
"known Orwell," the fiction,
essays, and journalistic pieces,
that much more alluring.

Most writers are neither born
nor made; they evolve and at
some point jell. In the case of the
man who, until 1933, was known
as Eric Blair and thereafter wrote
under the pseudonym of "George
Orwell," this evolution was
marked by a late start and by a
long apprenticeship. Blair/Orwell's
first full length work — Down and
Out in Paris and London (1933) —
was not written until the author
was thirty, and was published
only after several rejections and
months of rewriting.
Significantly, Peter Stansky
and William Abrahams end their
work with the publication of
"Down and Out" and the
emergence of George Orwell.
For The Unknown Orwell, in
contrast to all too many literary
biographies, does not take the
easy way out; it does not assume
that the young Blair contained
and was nurturing the seeds for
the later Orwell; as the authors
take pains to point out, the path
from Blair to Orwell was not only
not inevitable, but circuitous and
bumpy.
One influence on Orwell,
however, was there almost from
the beginning: the sensitivity to
class, be it Eric Blair's priggishness
over the "smelly" children of
factory workers or his own
anxieties at St. Cyprian and Eton
at belonging to the
"lower-upper-middle class," as he
sardonically called it.
It was perhaps the Blair
sensitivity at being at the very
bottom of the aristocracy that
helped him adjust to and stick it
out at the bottom during the
"down and out" days.
If throughout the public school
years the writer was not "there"
in Blair, he was "fermenting" in
numerous school sketches and
compositions, in a certain
irreverence, questioning spirit,
cynicism.
The young Blair was also
marked by a strong degree of
inwardness, not so much
soul-searching introspection as

years of writing a story in my
mind. One evidence of this
tendency is the fact that the
authors have precious little
autobiographical material to go
on; Blair pre-Orwell wrote only a
handful of essays and reviews, few
letters, and apparently no diary or
journal.
Moreover, apart from a few
visits to a brothel, it appears that
Eric Blair had a rather limited sex
life, and no affairs or even lasting
"relationships" before becoming
Orwell. Indeed, we learn that until
his marriage in 1936, he felt the
closest woman in his life was his
mother.
Sheltered Blair
For about half of this book, we
are offered a rather sheltered
Blair, supported by his parents'
financial sacrifices in the elitist
world of St. Cyprian and Eton.
With his graduation from the
latter, however, Blair broke
sharply from both his past and
with the normal path that young
men of his intelligence and class
were expected to take — to the
university.
Like his father, he entered the
imperial service, in time becoming
an Assistant Superintendent of
Police in Burma. While
acknowledging the pragmatic
reasons for this decision — Blair's
family's financial problems and
that he had little desire or
aptitude for college — they go on
to note that "Not going to the
university was a decisive part in
the making of the writing."
Burmese Days notwithstand
ing, Blair did not experience
paroxisms of anti-imperialist
sentiments during his five years
(1922-27) in Burma. Yet,
although externally a-political, he
was affected by certain troubling
incidents like seeing a coolie
beaten when Blair had first landed
in Rangoon. The day-to-day sense
of being unwanted, of being the
alien oppressor who was to be
resisted by oblique shows of
contempt and cold silence left a
lasting impression on him. As the
authors put it, with regard to the
"Burmese days," but with
implications which go beyond,
"His response to Burma was
a very moving demonstration
that, for him, personal
consideration (the particular

experience) was more
important than political
considerations (the abstract
experience) and that he had to
move through the former to
arrive at the latter."
Tough-Mindedness
The renunciation of academia,
and later of the imperial
bureaucracy, insured that Blair's
and later Orwell's
tough-mindedness would be
rooted in experience rather than
in institutions or ideology.
The process of "becoming a
writer" took another five years,
and was marked by months of
indecision, mediocre outlook, and
recurring failure. The decision to
go "down and out," which,
according to the authors, began as
a combination of "economic
necessity and literary curiosity"
was within a year reduced to the
former.
The romanticism of poverty, of
the gentleman-cum-tramp, wore
off quickly. Though Blair could
have received financial aid from
an aunt in Paris, a combination of
pride and tenacity led him to the
life of a plogeur, or dishwasher.
"He had to blast from his
consciousness the invented or
synthetic character.... At the
bottom, where "I had chosen to
be, one took bottom jobs." To be
effective in depicting the world
around him, the autobiographical
writer could not assume a pose; he
had to get dirty hands.

the later Orwell; as the authors
take pains to point out, the path
from Blair to Orwell was not only
not inevitable, but circuitous and
bumpy.
One influence on Orwell,
however, was there almost from
the beginning: the sensitivity to
class, be it Eric Blair's priggishness
over the "smelly" children of
factory workers or his own
anxieties at St. Cyprian and Eton
at belonging to the
"lower-upper-middle class," as he
sardonically called it.
It was perhaps the Blair
sensitivity at being at the very
bottom of the aristocracy that
helped him adjust to and stick it
out at the bottom during the
"down and out" days.
If throughout the public school
years the writer was not "there"
in Blair, he was "fermenting" in
numerous school sketches and
compositions, in a certain
irreverence, questioning spirit,
cynicism.
The young Blair was also
marked by a strong degree of
inwardness, not so much
soul-searching introspection as

years of writing a story in my
mind. One evidence of this
tendency is the fact that the
authors have precious little
autobiographical material to go
on; Blair pre-Orwell wrote only a
handful of essays and reviews, few
letters, and apparently no diary or
journal.
Moreover, apart from a few
visits to a brothel, it appears that
Eric Blair had a rather limited sex
life, and no affairs or even lasting
"relationships" before becoming
Orwell. Indeed, we learn that until
his marriage in 1936, he felt the
closest woman in his life was his
mother.
Sheltered Blair
For about half of this book, we
are offered a rather sheltered
Blair, supported by his parents'
financial sacrifices in the elitist
world of St. Cyprian and Eton.
With his graduation from the
latter, however, Blair broke
sharply from both his past and
with the normal path that young
men of his intelligence and class
were expected to take — to the
university.
Like his father, he entered the
imperial service, in time becoming
an Assistant Superintendent of
Police in Burma. While
acknowledging the pragmatic
reasons for this decision — Blair's
family's financial problems and
that he had little desire or
aptitude for college — they go on
to note that "Not going to the
university was a decisive part in
the making of the writing."
Burmese Days notwithstand
ing, Blair did not experience
paroxisms of anti-imperialist
sentiments during his five years
(1922-27) in Burma. Yet,
although externally a-political, he
was affected by certain troubling
incidents like seeing a coolie
beaten when Blair had first landed
in Rangoon. The day-to-day sense
of being unwanted, of being the
alien oppressor who was to be
resisted by oblique shows of
contempt and cold silence left a
lasting impression on him. As the
authors put it, with regard to the
"Burmese days," but with
implications which go beyond,
"His response to Burma was
a very moving demonstration
that, for him, personal
consideration (the particular

experience) was more
important than political
considerations (the abstract
experience) and that he had to
move through the former to
arrive at the latter."
Tough-Mindedness
The renunciation of academia,
and later of the imperial
bureaucracy, insured that Blair's
and later Orwell's
tough-mindedness would be
rooted in experience rather than
in institutions or ideology.
The process of "becoming a
writer" took another five years,
and was marked by months of
indecision, mediocre outlook, and
recurring failure. The decision to
go "down and out," which,
according to the authors, began as
a combination of "economic
necessity and literary curiosity"
was within a year reduced to the
former.
The romanticism of poverty, of
the gentleman-cum-tramp, wore
off quickly. Though Blair could
have received financial aid from
an aunt in Paris, a combination of
pride and tenacity led him to the
life of a plogeur, or dishwasher.
"He had to blast from his
consciousness the invented or
synthetic character.... At the
bottom, where "I had chosen to
be, one took bottom jobs." To be
effective in depicting the world
around him, the autobiographical
writer could not assume a pose; he
had to get dirty hands.
Finally Published
After coming back to England,
he tapped out "Down and Out" in
nine months, saw it rejected,
endured some more poverty,
rewrote the work, saw it rejected
again, and finally, thanks to some
rather chance connections, saw
the book published. By the
long apprenticeship's end, Biair
had learned to endure and to
make creative use of the ironies,
frustrations, and pains of that
endurance. Only then could Eric

Blair become George Orwell.
The Unknown Orwell is
beautifully written, refreshingly
free of academese and pseudo
-psychoanalytic pretensions. Its'
style is succinct and frequently
witty. Describing Blair's rather
mediocre early poems, for
example, the authors note, 'Their
tone was cynical; their language,
banal; their ironies predictable. It
was as though sub-Maugham
subjects had been set to
sub-Housman verse."
Social History Too
The book may be enjoyed as
social history as well as
biography: the sketches of English
public schools in the first fifth of
this century, and of a dying
colonialism in Burma, especially
as it affected the middle and
lower bureaucracy, are especially
effective. One wishes only for
some more photographs and for
some more discussion of Blair's
inter-personal relationships,
especially with women — there
must be more than this.
Yet these are irritations in light
of the thoroughness and
readability of this book: our best
grasp yet of 'The Unknown
Orwell" makes the work of the
"known Orwell," the fiction,
essays, and journalistic pieces,
that much more alluring.
