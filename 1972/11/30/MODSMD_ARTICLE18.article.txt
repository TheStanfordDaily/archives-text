'Hardhat' Leader Gels Labor Post
WASHINGTON — President Nixon said yesterday he will nominate "hardhat"
union leader Peter J. Brennan to be Secretary of Labor — the first unionist in 20
years to be picked for the post.
In relaying the surprise announcement to newsmen, press secretary Ronald L.
Ziegler said the present labor department chief, James D. Hodgson, had told
Nixon he wants to return to private life. However, Ziegler said Hodgson is
weighing a Nixon offer to accept a position — not specified — in the
international area.
Brennan, president of New York City and State Building and Construction
Trades Council for the past 15 years, was described by Ziegler as a life-long
Democrat who worked hard for Nixon's re-election.
The President first met Brennan after the labor leader led a 1970 mass march
of construction workers and longshoremen through downtown Manhattan to
demonstrate support for Nixon's Vietnam policies.
Ziegler said the Brennan nomination, subject to confirmation by the Senate,
has the blessing of AFL-CIO President George Meany and the Teamsters'
president, Frank Fitzsimmons. The 54-year-old Brennan conferred with Nixon
secretly at Camp David Tuesday.
Brennan's choice by Nixon is viewed in labor circles as an overture toward
Meany, who has supported Nixon in Vietnam but has been harshly critical of
administration economic policies.
Philip Berrigan Paroled
WASHINGTON — Father Philip Berrigan, serving a six-year sentence for
damaging draft board records, was granted parole by the U.S. Parole Board
effective Dec. 20, the board announced yesterday.
The 49-year-old Jesuit priest, now in the Federal Correctional Institute at
Danbury, Conn., has been in prison since July 5, 1968. He was sentenced May
24, 1968 for damaging draft board records at the Baltimore Selective Service
office in 1967.
Father Berrigan's full term expires Feb. 15,1974.
Tax Bill Passes Assembly
SACRAMENTO — A $1.1 billion school finance and property tax relief bill
sailed through the Assembly yesterday on a 64-8 vote, but Senate foes who have
defeated the tax bill twice before threatened to kill it again unless new
amendments are made.
Backers said the next Senate vote "will be the last chance" for the tax shift
bill. But Senate President pro tem James Mills, a foe of the tax bill, said the
Senate would form a new negotiating committee to make a fourth try if this bill
fails.
The bill stood one vote short of the 27-vote, two-thirds Senate majority
needed for final passage yesterday. Backers said they were uncertain when they
would call for the final Senate vote, but final adjournment is scheduled
tomorrow.
The massive tax shift proposal is the result of compromise negotiations
between Republican Gov. Reagan and Democratic Assembly Speaker Bob
Moretti.
It would give local schools another $332 million a year in new state funds,
roll back school property taxes another $229 million and increase homeowner
and renter tax exemptions and credits by $488 million a year.
They would be paid for by a one cent per dollar increase in the state sales tax,
a 1.4 percent hike in business taxes and use of surplus funds in the state budget.
Farr Loses Another Appeal
SAN FRANCISCO — The California Supreme Court refused without comment
yesterday to release jailed newsman William Farr from prison and denied a
request for a hearing on new issues in his dispute with the Charles Manson trial
judge over a news story.
Farr's attorney, Mark Hurwitz is expected to appeal next to the U.S. District
Court.
The state court's terse decision said only, "The petition for writ of habeas
corpus and application for release on own recognizance denied." It offered no
opinions on the issues involved.
Farr, 37, has been in jail since Monday when Superior Court Judge Charles
Older imposed an indefinite sentence for contempt of court. The punishment
was ordered because Farr refused to tell Older the source of a story he wrote in
1970 during the Manson trial and Older said he'd keep Farr in jail until he talks.
Earlier this month, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear Farr's first appeal

of the contempt conviction. Hurwitz is appealing now on other grounds.
In the latest petition, he contended that Older "is so personally embroiled in
controversy" with Farr that he cannot be an impartial judge and should
disqualify himself.
Nixon, South Viet Envoy Confer
WASHINGTON — President Nixon held a lengthy meeting yesterday with special
South Vietnamese envoy Nguyen Phu Due to review the Indochina peace efforts.
White House press secretary Ronald L. Ziegler said the two-and-a-half-hour
meeting was a frank, detailed exchange of views. But he refused to discuss any of
the substance of the talk.
Prior to the meeting, some diplomatic sources said Due would propose in his
talk with the President that such a summit session be held in December.
Ziegler, who was not in the meeting, said he had no personal knowledge that
Due had proposed a meeting. However, he repeated an earlier statement that "no
meeting is planned at this time."
But he added, "obviously I cannot... rule out a meeting between President
Nixon and President Thieu sometime in the near future."
Today's Weather
Mostly fair through tomorrow but with patches of fog late night and moming
hours. Lows tonight in the mid 30s to mid 40s. Highs both days in the upper 40s
and 50s. Light winds.
