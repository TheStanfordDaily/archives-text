# Draft Worries Ebb With Fewer Calls
## 
### CHRIS KENRICK 
Although student draft deferments
are no longer available, the first crop
of students without them — this year's
sophomores — may be virtually
unaffected, according to Stanford
draft counselors.
After Monday's Pentagon
announcement that 1973 induction
calls will not exceed 10,000, draft
counselors were optimistic.
If there are any draft calls at all
next year the number will be relatively
small, possibly not even tapping the
pool of men that first becomes eligible
for conscription in January, according
to Special Services Counselor Peter
Hanawalt.
Draft quotas for 1973 may be
completely satisfied by extended
priority draftees from 1972 — men
whose lottery numbers were reached
in 1972, but whose actual induction
processes were not completed by the
end of the year.
Hanawalt, who has been draft
counselling for three years, noted that
overall student consciousness of the
draft has significantly reduced in the
last several years.
"Not so many people are
threatened any more," he remarked.
"Now, once you get your number, you
pretty much know what your situation
is."
Hanawalt also pointed out that
"ceiling" lottery numbers have been
lower each year since the lottery was
instituted. In 1970, draft calls went up
to number 195; in 1971,125; and this
year's ceiling will be 95.
Apparently, even students still
facing the draft are no longer too
worried. One 19-year-old Stanford
freshman, who was assigned number
one in February's lottery and was
called for his physical this month, was
unalarmed.
"I think the draft will end before
they get me," he said. "I haven't even
been to the draft counselor yet."

Monday's Pentagon announcement
also included a statement that there
will be no January, 1973 draft calls, so
inductions will be spread over a
five-month period between February
and June, when military conscription
is ended and the nation shifts to an
all-volunteer force.
In order for the draft to continue
beyond June 30, 1973, President
Nixon would have to again ask
Congress for authority to induct, and
right now he is not expected to do so,
Hanawalt said.
Although a few Stanford students
have been drafted right out of school
since 2-S deferments were abolished,
Hanawalt had no exact figures.
In the absence of the deferment,
some students are seeking 4-F,
hardship, or conscientious objector
status, Hanawalt said.
He noted that many students need
not worry beyond the Army physical,
because on the national average a full
one-half of potential draftees flunk the
examination.
"As draft counselors, we feel very
strongly that we don't want to push
people into anything," Hanawalt
concluded.
"We will help students with appeal
cases, or help them use their appeal
rights to gain time; but our major aim
is to present them with the alternatives
and let them decide."

completely satisfied by extended
priority draftees from 1972 — men
whose lottery numbers were reached
in 1972, but whose actual induction
processes were not completed by the
end of the year.
Hanawalt, who has been draft
counselling for three years, noted that
overall student consciousness of the
draft has significantly reduced in the
last several years.
"Not so many people are
threatened any more," he remarked.
"Now, once you get your number, you
pretty much know what your situation
is."
Hanawalt also pointed out that
"ceiling" lottery numbers have been
lower each year since the lottery was
instituted. In 1970, draft calls went up
to number 195; in 1971,125; and this
year's ceiling will be 95.
Apparently, even students still
facing the draft are no longer too
worried. One 19-year-old Stanford
freshman, who was assigned number
one in February's lottery and was
called for his physical this month, was
unalarmed.
"I think the draft will end before
they get me," he said. "I haven't even
been to the draft counselor yet."

Monday's Pentagon announcement
also included a statement that there
will be no January, 1973 draft calls, so
inductions will be spread over a
five-month period between February
and June, when military conscription
is ended and the nation shifts to an
all-volunteer force.
In order for the draft to continue
beyond June 30, 1973, President
Nixon would have to again ask
Congress for authority to induct, and
right now he is not expected to do so,
Hanawalt said.
Although a few Stanford students
have been drafted right out of school
since 2-S deferments were abolished,
Hanawalt had no exact figures.
In the absence of the deferment,
some students are seeking 4-F,
hardship, or conscientious objector
status, Hanawalt said.
He noted that many students need
not worry beyond the Army physical,
because on the national average a full
one-half of potential draftees flunk the
examination.
"As draft counselors, we feel very
strongly that we don't want to push
people into anything," Hanawalt
concluded.
"We will help students with appeal
cases, or help them use their appeal
rights to gain time; but our major aim
is to present them with the alternatives
and let them decide."
Although student draft deferments
are no longer available, the first crop
of students without them — this year's
sophomores — may be virtually
unaffected, according to Stanford
draft counselors.
After Monday's Pentagon
announcement that 1973 induction
calls will not exceed 10,000, draft
counselors were optimistic.
If there are any draft calls at all
next year the number will be relatively
small, possibly not even tapping the
pool of men that first becomes eligible
for conscription in January, according
to Special Services Counselor Peter
Hanawalt.
Draft quotas for 1973 may be
completely satisfied by extended
