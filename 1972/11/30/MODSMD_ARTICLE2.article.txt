# Student Senate Bill Vetoed; Burke Stops Salary Panel
## 
### TERRY ANZUR 
ASSU President Scott Burke yesterday vetoed a bill
passed Tuesday night by the Student Senate establishing a
committee to investigate the possibility of substituting
academic credit for the salaries of ASSU officers.
Burke exercised his veto power and listed five reasons
for his action in a letter to Senate Chairman Rocky
Barber:
—the panel would be purposeless because it is known
that "ASSU Officers are already grossly underpaid."
—academic credit granted by the political science
department for ASSU service would provide an incentive
for only political and social science majors. It would
discourage students in engineering, math, sciences, law,
business and education from participation in ASSU
government.
—that "the sponsor's comment on the Senate floor that
'white middle class' students should not receive pay for
their work in student government is blatantly and
viciously racist."
—the elimination of salaries would make it possible for
only the very wealthy or the very poor to hold office.
—the committee is composed of Senate volunteers who
are predisposed toward eliminating salaries.
Must Veto
"I cannot in good conscience do otherwise than veto
this measure so grossly contaminated by racism, hatred
for the economic middle class, and political bias," Burke
wrote.
A motion to override Burke's veto will be in order at
the Senate's next meeting, scheduled for 7:30 p.m. next
Tuesday.
In other reaction to Tuesday night's Senate business,
ASSU Financial Manager Sara Moore produced records
yesterday proving that Sen. Bob Barker's report of a $346
ASSU expenditure last March to pay supposed gambling
debts of Doug McHenry, a former member of the Council
of Presidents, to be based on a joke.

McHenry obtained a $346 advance of funds from the
Council of Presidents' administration account on March 8
to cover his travel expenses to a meeting in Gary, Indiana.
The University had planned to pay the expenses, but
because the President's office could not produce the
check in time for the trip, McHenry was forced to borrow
from the ASSU account.
The President's office repaid the amount in full, and
the money was redeposited in the council's account by
April 26.
Barker's charge was based on McHenry's description of
the fund request on a March 8 purchase order, which he
wrote as a joke.
The notation said "a senate member of the council
needed cash immediately for a gambling debt. The
President's office could not get the check out until 4 p.m.
The gang demanded payment before 12 p.m. today, thus
the money was needed pronto."
Last year's financial manager ignored the joke and
issued a check for "emergency funds for reimbursement
to the President's office."
Meal Expenses Records
Moore, the current financial manager, also produced
records of ASSU disbursements to cover meal expenses of
the ASSU Council of Presidents during winter quarter of
last year.
Council members were permitted to open an account
with the eating service, so that they could meet with their
constituents by eating occasional meals in various dorms
and row houses. Moore said the privilege was "totally
abused."
This year, the eating account is a separate $500
allocation in the budget. Members of the council will no
longer be able to charge personal meals to the account.
Instead, the money will pay occasional meal expenses for
student committee meetings and university officials.

Moore, the current financial manager, also produced
records of ASSU disbursements to cover meal expenses of
the ASSU Council of Presidents during winter quarter of
last year.
Council members were permitted to open an account
with the eating service, so that they could meet with their
constituents by eating occasional meals in various dorms
and row houses. Moore said the privilege was "totally
abused."
This year, the eating account is a separate $500
allocation in the budget. Members of the council will no
longer be able to charge personal meals to the account.
Instead, the money will pay occasional meal expenses for
student committee meetings and university officials.
ASSU President Scott Burke yesterday vetoed a bill
passed Tuesday night by the Student Senate establishing a
committee to investigate the possibility of substituting
academic credit for the salaries of ASSU officers.
Burke exercised his veto power and listed five reasons
for his action in a letter to Senate Chairman Rocky
Barber:
—the panel would be purposeless because it is known
that "ASSU Officers are already grossly underpaid."
—academic credit granted by the political science
department for ASSU service would provide an incentive
for only political and social science majors. It would
discourage students in engineering, math, sciences, law,
business and education from participation in ASSU
government.
—that "the sponsor's comment on the Senate floor that
'white middle class' students should not receive pay for
their work in student government is blatantly and
viciously racist."
—the elimination of salaries would make it possible for
only the very wealthy or the very poor to hold office.
—the committee is composed of Senate volunteers who
are predisposed toward eliminating salaries.
Must Veto
"I cannot in good conscience do otherwise than veto
this measure so grossly contaminated by racism, hatred
for the economic middle class, and political bias," Burke
wrote.
A motion to override Burke's veto will be in order at
the Senate's next meeting, scheduled for 7:30 p.m. next
Tuesday.
In other reaction to Tuesday night's Senate business,
ASSU Financial Manager Sara Moore produced records
yesterday proving that Sen. Bob Barker's report of a $346
ASSU expenditure last March to pay supposed gambling
debts of Doug McHenry, a former member of the Council
of Presidents, to be based on a joke.

McHenry obtained a $346 advance of funds from the
Council of Presidents' administration account on March 8
to cover his travel expenses to a meeting in Gary, Indiana.
The University had planned to pay the expenses, but
because the President's office could not produce the
check in time for the trip, McHenry was forced to borrow
from the ASSU account.
The President's office repaid the amount in full, and
the money was redeposited in the council's account by
April 26.
Barker's charge was based on McHenry's description of
the fund request on a March 8 purchase order, which he
wrote as a joke.
The notation said "a senate member of the council
needed cash immediately for a gambling debt. The
President's office could not get the check out until 4 p.m.
The gang demanded payment before 12 p.m. today, thus
the money was needed pronto."
Last year's financial manager ignored the joke and
issued a check for "emergency funds for reimbursement
to the President's office."
