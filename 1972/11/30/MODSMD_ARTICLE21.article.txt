Dr. Nancy Jewell Cross, a Stanford alumna who has figured in previous legal
battles with the University, is suing the University in small claims court for
$500, the Daily learned yesterday.
The suit stems from a Nov. 2 parking citation Cross received from campus
security guard Lowell M. Scadden. The citation was subsequently dismissed in
North County Municipal Court.
Named as defendants in the suit, which comes up today at 9 a.m., are Acting
President William Miller, University Counsel Cassius L. Kirk Jr., the Board of
Trustees on behalf of the University, and Scadden.
Court officials confirmed yesterday that papers in the suit had been served on
all defendants.
Cross said yesterday that the University "harrasses people" over parking
tickets and claimed that Scadden lacked legal authority to issue the citation.
North County Municipal Court Judge Timothy Hanifin will hear the case
today.
