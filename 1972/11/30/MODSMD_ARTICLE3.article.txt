# U. S. Role Far From Over
## Further Vietnam Involvement Hinted 
### DOYLE McMANUS News Analysis 
Three separate, well-documented,
but apparently little-noticed reports
from Saigon indicate that the role of
U.S. manpower in Vietnam is far from
over — despite the expectation of a
cease-fire by early 1973.
The New York Times reported
Monday that American officials are
secretly planning a major postwar
presence of American civilians in
Vietnam, with many of them simply
replacing military personnel. The
Times quoted "well-informed sources"
as saying that about 10,000 American
advisers and technicians, most of them
working under Defense Department
contract, will stay on after a cease-fire.
Reportedly, they will do everything
from running the South Vietnamese
military's personnel and logistics
computers to teaching the Vietnamese
air force how to fly newly-provided
planes and maintain U.S.-provided
aircraft and communications systems.
Meanwhile, both sides are rushing
to complete a military buildup before
a cease-fire agreement is signed. The
proposed settlement now under

discussion calls for the withdrawal of
all U.S. troops within 60 days of a
cease-fire, but includes no known
provision regarding U.S. civilians.
Civilian Contracts
The U.S. secretly plans to take
advantage of that loophole by
contracting with American civilian
firms to carry out wide-ranging
military advisory functions, the
Associated Press and United Press
International quoted U.S. military
sources as saying.
About half of the civilian advisers
are already in Vietnam, with others
beginning to arrive almost daily at
Saigon's Tan Son Nhut airport under
new contracts signed confidentially in
the last few weeks. A high-ranking
U.S. Army officer said some of the
advisers would function "more or less
as joint chiefs of staff." He likened
them to a brain trust made up largely
of West Point graduates, but not in
military service.
Senior American officials insist that
such a continuing American presence
following a cease-fire period would
violate "neither the letter nor the spirit
of the peace settlement," as one

diplomat said. But these officials, both
civilian and military, have repeatedly
refused to provide any details about
American planning for the postwar
period, and there has been no attempt
to deny the escalation of advisers.
"It might upset the Paris peace
talks," the Times quoted a U.S.
military spokesman as saying, "and it's
just not in the national interest to have
these things known."
A few Americans and some foreign
diplomats in Saigon apparently have
doubts about the wisdom of such a
postwar policy.
Americans Optimistic
"It's like 1961 or 1965 all over
again," one Western official who has
served several tours of duty in
Indochina said. "The Americans are
full of optimism again, and once more
they are proceeding as if the
Vietnamese aren't even around.
They're just bringing in Americans to
do the job."
Until these recent developments,
the number of American civilian
contract employees had fallen from a
high of over 9000 in 1970 to about
5000 earlier this vear.

Of the American companies already
operating in Vietnam, several now
specialize in supply and maintenance.
They could simply expand their
current projects, sources said, and
replace the U.S. military in a number
of areas.
The scope of the projects planned
isn't known, but informants said the
framework would be similar to that in
Laos, where the U.S. has been fighting
a "secret war" for ten years while
prohibited from overt military
involvement by the 1962 Geneva
agreements.
One private firm in Laos, Air
America, flies supply and even combat
missions under contract to the U.S.
government; Air America also
currently flies supply missions in
Vietnam. And the requirements office
of the U.S. Agency for International
Development (AID) in Vientiane is
staffed largely by former military
personnel who funnel arms and
supplies to the CIA-backed army of
Meo tribesmen; about 1000 AID
members and several hundred U.S.
military attaches are expected to
remain in Vietnam after a peace
accord is signed.
Although officials have refused to
divulge anything about the new
Vietnam contracts, two companies
that are reported to have received
them are Lear Siegler, Inc., and NHA,
Inc. The English-language Saigon Post
has been carrying advertisements from
Lear Siegler and an unidentified
"major U.S.-invited contractor,"
seeking applications for "armaments
specialists."
Lear Siegler is said to have been
given about 300 new jobs serving the
120 F-105 fighter planes that the
United States rushed to South
Vietnam earlier this month, and
Dallas-based MHA is reported to have
been awarded at least 200 other

aircraft maintenance jobs for the
South Vietnamese Air Force.
Spokesmen for the companies say they
are unable to comment on the new
contracts.
It apparently remains uncertain
precisely who will control these
civilian contractors after the United
States military command withdraws
from Vietnam. The United States
Army Procurement Agency is
currently in charge. U.S. Embassy
officials are known to think that the
embassy should assume control as
soon as the Army leaves.
But the Pentagon last week
dispatched a civilian, Wilfred J. Curley,
to take over the Army Procurement
Agency in Saigon from its military
commander — leading to speculation
that the agency will be converted into
an ostensibly civilian bureau under
effective military control.
Combat in Vietnam is at its most
intense now as Viet Cong and South
Vietnamese alike struggle to gain
control of as much territory as
possible before any agreement is
signed. And despite the apparent
proximity of a settlement with North
Vietnam — President Nixon's latest
estimate is "by the first of the year" —
both sides privately admit that
sporadic fighting will almost surely
continue past any cease-fire date.
It now appears that although a
peace treaty will be signed within the
next few months, the war may well
drag on and on much as it has for the
past ten years — with American
support.

the last few weeks. A high-ranking
U.S. Army officer said some of the
advisers would function "more or less
as joint chiefs of staff." He likened
them to a brain trust made up largely
of West Point graduates, but not in
military service.
Senior American officials insist that
such a continuing American presence
following a cease-fire period would
violate "neither the letter nor the spirit
of the peace settlement," as one

diplomat said. But these officials, both
civilian and military, have repeatedly
refused to provide any details about
American planning for the postwar
period, and there has been no attempt
to deny the escalation of advisers.
"It might upset the Paris peace
talks," the Times quoted a U.S.
military spokesman as saying, "and it's
just not in the national interest to have
these things known."
A few Americans and some foreign
diplomats in Saigon apparently have
doubts about the wisdom of such a
postwar policy.
Americans Optimistic
"It's like 1961 or 1965 all over
again," one Western official who has
served several tours of duty in
Indochina said. "The Americans are
full of optimism again, and once more
they are proceeding as if the
Vietnamese aren't even around.
They're just bringing in Americans to
do the job."
Until these recent developments,
the number of American civilian
contract employees had fallen from a
high of over 9000 in 1970 to about
5000 earlier this vear.

Of the American companies already
operating in Vietnam, several now
specialize in supply and maintenance.
They could simply expand their
current projects, sources said, and
replace the U.S. military in a number
of areas.
The scope of the projects planned
isn't known, but informants said the
framework would be similar to that in
Laos, where the U.S. has been fighting
a "secret war" for ten years while
prohibited from overt military
involvement by the 1962 Geneva
agreements.
One private firm in Laos, Air
America, flies supply and even combat
missions under contract to the U.S.
government; Air America also
currently flies supply missions in
Vietnam. And the requirements office
of the U.S. Agency for International
Development (AID) in Vientiane is
staffed largely by former military
personnel who funnel arms and
supplies to the CIA-backed army of
Meo tribesmen; about 1000 AID
members and several hundred U.S.
military attaches are expected to
remain in Vietnam after a peace
accord is signed.
Although officials have refused to
divulge anything about the new
Vietnam contracts, two companies
that are reported to have received
them are Lear Siegler, Inc., and NHA,
Inc. The English-language Saigon Post
has been carrying advertisements from
Lear Siegler and an unidentified
"major U.S.-invited contractor,"
seeking applications for "armaments
specialists."
Lear Siegler is said to have been
given about 300 new jobs serving the
120 F-105 fighter planes that the
United States rushed to South
Vietnam earlier this month, and
Dallas-based MHA is reported to have
been awarded at least 200 other

aircraft maintenance jobs for the
South Vietnamese Air Force.
Spokesmen for the companies say they
are unable to comment on the new
contracts.
It apparently remains uncertain
precisely who will control these
civilian contractors after the United
States military command withdraws
from Vietnam. The United States
Army Procurement Agency is
currently in charge. U.S. Embassy
officials are known to think that the
embassy should assume control as
soon as the Army leaves.
But the Pentagon last week
dispatched a civilian, Wilfred J. Curley,
to take over the Army Procurement
Agency in Saigon from its military
commander — leading to speculation
that the agency will be converted into
an ostensibly civilian bureau under
effective military control.
Combat in Vietnam is at its most
intense now as Viet Cong and South
Vietnamese alike struggle to gain
control of as much territory as
possible before any agreement is
signed. And despite the apparent
proximity of a settlement with North
Vietnam — President Nixon's latest
estimate is "by the first of the year" —
both sides privately admit that
sporadic fighting will almost surely
continue past any cease-fire date.
It now appears that although a
peace treaty will be signed within the
next few months, the war may well
drag on and on much as it has for the
past ten years — with American
support.
Three separate, well-documented,
but apparently little-noticed reports
from Saigon indicate that the role of
U.S. manpower in Vietnam is far from
over — despite the expectation of a
cease-fire by early 1973.
The New York Times reported
Monday that American officials are
secretly planning a major postwar
presence of American civilians in
Vietnam, with many of them simply
replacing military personnel. The
Times quoted "well-informed sources"
as saying that about 10,000 American
advisers and technicians, most of them
working under Defense Department
contract, will stay on after a cease-fire.
Reportedly, they will do everything
from running the South Vietnamese
military's personnel and logistics
computers to teaching the Vietnamese
air force how to fly newly-provided
planes and maintain U.S.-provided
aircraft and communications systems.
Meanwhile, both sides are rushing
to complete a military buildup before
a cease-fire agreement is signed. The
proposed settlement now under

discussion calls for the withdrawal of
all U.S. troops within 60 days of a
cease-fire, but includes no known
provision regarding U.S. civilians.

The U.S. secretly plans to take

firms to carry out wide-ranging
military advisory functions, the
Associated Press and United Press
International quoted U.S. military

About half of the civilian advisers
are already in Vietnam, with others

Saigon's Tan Son Nhut airport under
new contracts signed confidentially in
the last few weeks. A high-ranking

current projects, sources said, and
replace the U.S. military in a number
of areas.
The scope of the projects planned
isn't known, but informants said the
framework would be similar to that in
Laos, where the U.S. has been fighting
a "secret war" for ten years while
prohibited from overt military
involvement by the 1962 Geneva
agreements.
One private firm in Laos, Air
America, flies supply and even combat
missions under contract to the U.S.
government; Air America also
currently flies supply missions in
Vietnam. And the requirements office
of the U.S. Agency for International
Development (AID) in Vientiane is
staffed largely by former military
personnel who funnel arms and
supplies to the CIA-backed army of
Meo tribesmen; about 1000 AID
members and several hundred U.S.
military attaches are expected to
remain in Vietnam after a peace
accord is signed.
Although officials have refused to
divulge anything about the new
Vietnam contracts, two companies
that are reported to have received
them are Lear Siegler, Inc., and NHA,
Inc. The English-language Saigon Post
has been carrying advertisements from
Lear Siegler and an unidentified
"major U.S.-invited contractor,"
seeking applications for "armaments
specialists."
Lear Siegler is said to have been
given about 300 new jobs serving the
120 F-105 fighter planes that the
United States rushed to South
Vietnam earlier this month, and
Dallas-based MHA is reported to have
been awarded at least 200 other

aircraft maintenance jobs for the
South Vietnamese Air Force.
Spokesmen for the companies say they
are unable to comment on the new
contracts.
It apparently remains uncertain
precisely who will control these
civilian contractors after the United
States military command withdraws
from Vietnam. The United States
Army Procurement Agency is
currently in charge. U.S. Embassy
officials are known to think that the
embassy should assume control as
soon as the Army leaves.
But the Pentagon last week
dispatched a civilian, Wilfred J. Curley,
to take over the Army Procurement
Agency in Saigon from its military
commander — leading to speculation
that the agency will be converted into
an ostensibly civilian bureau under
effective military control.
Combat in Vietnam is at its most
intense now as Viet Cong and South
Vietnamese alike struggle to gain
control of as much territory as
possible before any agreement is
signed. And despite the apparent
proximity of a settlement with North
Vietnam — President Nixon's latest
estimate is "by the first of the year" —
both sides privately admit that
sporadic fighting will almost surely
continue past any cease-fire date.
It now appears that although a
peace treaty will be signed within the
next few months, the war may well
drag on and on much as it has for the
past ten years — with American
support.
Three separate, well-documented,
but apparently little-noticed reports
from Saigon indicate that the role of
U.S. manpower in Vietnam is far from
over — despite the expectation of a
cease-fire by early 1973.
The New York Times reported
Monday that American officials are
secretly planning a major postwar
presence of American civilians in
Vietnam, with many of them simply
replacing military personnel. The
Times quoted "well-informed sources"
as saying that about 10,000 American
advisers and technicians, most of them
working under Defense Department
contract, will stay on after a cease-fire.
Reportedly, they will do everything
from running the South Vietnamese
military's personnel and logistics
computers to teaching the Vietnamese
air force how to fly newly-provided
planes and maintain U.S.-provided
aircraft and communications systems.
Meanwhile, both sides are rushing
to complete a military buildup before
a cease-fire agreement is signed. The
proposed settlement now under

discussion calls for the withdrawal of
all U.S. troops within 60 days of a
cease-fire, but includes no known
provision regarding U.S. civilians.
Civilian Contracts
The U.S. secretly plans to take
advantage of that loophole by
contracting with American civilian
firms to carry out wide-ranging
military advisory functions, the
Associated Press and United Press
International quoted U.S. military
sources as saying.
About half of the civilian advisers
are already in Vietnam, with others
beginning to arrive almost daily at
Saigon's Tan Son Nhut airport under
new contracts signed confidentially in
the last few weeks. A high-ranking
U.S. Army officer said some of the
advisers would function "more or less
as joint chiefs of staff." He likened
them to a brain trust made up largely
of West Point graduates, but not in
military service.
Senior American officials insist that
such a continuing American presence
following a cease-fire period would
violate "neither the letter nor the spirit
of the peace settlement," as one

diplomat said. But these officials, both
civilian and military, have repeatedly
refused to provide any details about
American planning for the postwar
period, and there has been no attempt
to deny the escalation of advisers.
"It might upset the Paris peace
talks," the Times quoted a U.S.
military spokesman as saying, "and it's
just not in the national interest to have
these things known."
A few Americans and some foreign
diplomats in Saigon apparently have
doubts about the wisdom of such a
postwar policy.
Americans Optimistic
"It's like 1961 or 1965 all over
again," one Western official who has
served several tours of duty in
Indochina said. "The Americans are
full of optimism again, and once more
they are proceeding as if the
Vietnamese aren't even around.
They're just bringing in Americans to
do the job."
Until these recent developments,
the number of American civilian
contract employees had fallen from a
high of over 9000 in 1970 to about
5000 earlier this vear.

Of the American companies already
operating in Vietnam, several now
specialize in supply and maintenance.
They could simply expand their
current projects, sources said, and
replace the U.S. military in a number
of areas.
