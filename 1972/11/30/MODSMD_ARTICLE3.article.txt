# U. S. Role Far From Over
## Further Vietnam Involvement Hinted 
### DOYLE McMANUS News Analysis 
Three separate, well-documented,
but apparently little-noticed reports
from Saigon indicate that the role of
U.S. manpower in Vietnam is far from
over — despite the expectation of a
cease-fire by early 1973.
The New York Times reported
Monday that American officials are
secretly planning a major postwar
presence of American civilians in
Vietnam, with many of them simply
replacing military personnel. The
Times quoted "well-informed sources"
as saying that about 10,000 American
advisers and technicians, most of them
working under Defense Department
contract, will stay on after a cease-fire.
Reportedly, they will do everything
from running the South Vietnamese
military's personnel and logistics
computers to teaching the Vietnamese
air force how to fly newly-provided
planes and maintain U.S.-provided
aircraft and communications systems.
Meanwhile, both sides are rushing
to complete a military buildup before
a cease-fire agreement is signed. The
proposed settlement now under

discussion calls for the withdrawal of
all U.S. troops within 60 days of a
cease-fire, but includes no known
provision regarding U.S. civilians.
Civilian Contracts
The U.S. secretly plans to take
advantage of that loophole by
contracting with American civilian
firms to carry out wide-ranging
military advisory functions, the
Associated Press and United Press
International quoted U.S. military
sources as saying.
About half of the civilian advisers
are already in Vietnam, with others
beginning to arrive almost daily at
Saigon's Tan Son Nhut airport under
new contracts signed confidentially in
the last few weeks. A high-ranking
U.S. Army officer said some of the
advisers would function "more or less
as joint chiefs of staff." He likened
them to a brain trust made up largely
of West Point graduates, but not in
military service.
Senior American officials insist that
such a continuing American presence
following a cease-fire period would
violate "neither the letter nor the spirit
of the peace settlement," as one

diplomat said. But these officials, both
civilian and military, have repeatedly
refused to provide any details about
American planning for the postwar
period, and there has been no attempt
to deny the escalation of advisers.
"It might upset the Paris peace
talks," the Times quoted a U.S.
military spokesman as saying, "and it's
just not in the national interest to have
these things known."
A few Americans and some foreign
diplomats in Saigon apparently have
doubts about the wisdom of such a
postwar policy.
Americans Optimistic
"It's like 1961 or 1965 all over
again," one Western official who has
served several tours of duty in
Indochina said. "The Americans are
full of optimism again, and once more
they are proceeding as if the
Vietnamese aren't even around.
They're just bringing in Americans to
do the job."
Until these recent developments,
the number of American civilian
contract employees had fallen from a
high of over 9000 in 1970 to about
5000 earlier this vear.

Of the American companies already
operating in Vietnam, several now
specialize in supply and maintenance.
They could simply expand their
current projects, sources said, and
replace the U.S. military in a number
of areas.
The scope of the projects planned
isn't known, but informants said the
