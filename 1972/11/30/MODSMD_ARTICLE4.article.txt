# Police Union President Dismissed
## 
### DAVID THIEMANN 
The University has given Wayne
Warwick, president of the Stanford
security officers' union, a notice of
dismissal, the Daily learned yesterday.
Doug Barton, Stanford's staff
counsel for employee relations,
confirmed that the University had sent
Warwick a notice of dismissal and had

suspended him "for a prior period,"
but would not comment further.
According to Harold Chapman, an
attorney for the Stanford Department
of Public Safety Officers Association
(SDPSOA), Director of Public Safety
Marvin Herrington dismissed Warwick
"only because of his union activities."
The attorney promised that
Stanford has "got a fight on its
hands," and vowed to attempt a "total
strike on the whole University"
because of the firing. The SDPSOA
will try to obtain Teamster backing for
a strike, he said.
Herrington had suspended Warwick
about a week ago because the mobile
patrol officer had worked five hours a
day for two days as a store detective
while on sick leave, Chapman said.
Claimed 111
The attorney claimed that Warwick
was ill and under a physician's care at
the time and worked against his
doctor's orders.
Barton would not state reasons for
the dismissal. When the Daily
attempted to contact Herrington for
comment at Special Assistant to the
President John Schwartz's office, a
secretary said he was in, but returned
to the telephone two minutes later to
report that Herrington had just
"stepped out of the office."
Later last night, the police
communicator on duty said

Herrington was "unavailable for the
evening."
When informed of Chapman's
allegations, Barton remarked that "I
would be very disappointed if he really
did entertain those views. I see no
substance for them."
"I'm sorry if we're in for another
round of that," he continued.
Earlier this year, Chapman harshly
criticized the University's treatment of
the SDPSOA and its handling of
negotiations with the union.
Albert King, vice-president of the
SDPSOA, yesterday said Herrington
dismissed Warwick "to harass union
officials and to get them to back off
from the University."
To File Complaints
The union is now investigating the
dismissal, and will file grievance
complaints against the University,
King said.
Chapman promised to file "every
(legal) action we can take" challenging
the dismissal in addition to a grievance
on Warwick's behalf.
Barton said he hoped the dismissal
would not affect negotiations between
the union and the University about a
deputization plan prepared by
Herrington, but the union attorney
indicated that "this is going to bring a
halt to the negotiations."
The union has vigorously resisted
Herrington's plan, developed last

spring after Santa Clara County Sheriff
James Geary agreed to commission
qualified Stanford officers as reserve
Sheriffs deputies.
While on duty, reserve deputies can
exercise the same legal authority as
regular policemen or deputies, with
special arrest, detention, and search
powers.
Fought Plan
The SDPSOA has fought the
deputization plan because it would
demote some mobile patrol officers to
foot patrol or "community service
officer" status, with a commensurate
reduction in pay and status.
In October, Chapman threatened to
file suit for an injunction barring the
University from implementing the
deputization plan, but he has not yet
actually commenced legal action.
Union spokesmen charge that
Herrington hopes to fire all current
employees and hire an entirely new
group of men for deputization, and
that he designed job prerequisites for
deputized positions to exclude present
employees.
Stanford has modified the
prerequisites somewhat, but still
refuses to accede to the union demand
that all present mobile patrol officers
receive special training for
deputization before outsiders are
hired.

The union is now investigating the
dismissal, and will file grievance
complaints against the University,
King said.
Chapman promised to file "every
(legal) action we can take" challenging
the dismissal in addition to a grievance
on Warwick's behalf.
Barton said he hoped the dismissal
would not affect negotiations between
the union and the University about a
deputization plan prepared by
Herrington, but the union attorney
indicated that "this is going to bring a
halt to the negotiations."
The union has vigorously resisted
Herrington's plan, developed last

spring after Santa Clara County Sheriff
James Geary agreed to commission
qualified Stanford officers as reserve
Sheriffs deputies.
While on duty, reserve deputies can
exercise the same legal authority as
regular policemen or deputies, with
special arrest, detention, and search
powers.
Fought Plan
The SDPSOA has fought the
deputization plan because it would
demote some mobile patrol officers to
foot patrol or "community service
officer" status, with a commensurate
reduction in pay and status.
In October, Chapman threatened to
file suit for an injunction barring the
University from implementing the
deputization plan, but he has not yet
actually commenced legal action.
Union spokesmen charge that
Herrington hopes to fire all current
employees and hire an entirely new
group of men for deputization, and
that he designed job prerequisites for
deputized positions to exclude present
employees.
Stanford has modified the
prerequisites somewhat, but still
refuses to accede to the union demand
that all present mobile patrol officers
receive special training for
deputization before outsiders are
hired.
The University has given Wayne
Warwick, president of the Stanford
security officers' union, a notice of
dismissal, the Daily learned yesterday.
Doug Barton, Stanford's staff
counsel for employee relations,
confirmed that the University had sent
Warwick a notice of dismissal and had

suspended him "for a prior period,"
but would not comment further.
According to Harold Chapman, an
attorney for the Stanford Department
of Public Safety Officers Association
(SDPSOA), Director of Public Safety
Marvin Herrington dismissed Warwick
"only because of his union activities."
The attorney promised that
Stanford has "got a fight on its
hands," and vowed to attempt a "total
strike on the whole University"
because of the firing. The SDPSOA
will try to obtain Teamster backing for
a strike, he said.
Herrington had suspended Warwick
about a week ago because the mobile
patrol officer had worked five hours a
day for two days as a store detective
while on sick leave, Chapman said.
Claimed 111
The attorney claimed that Warwick
was ill and under a physician's care at
the time and worked against his
doctor's orders.
Barton would not state reasons for
the dismissal. When the Daily
attempted to contact Herrington for
comment at Special Assistant to the
President John Schwartz's office, a
secretary said he was in, but returned
to the telephone two minutes later to
report that Herrington had just
"stepped out of the office."
Later last night, the police
communicator on duty said

Herrington was "unavailable for the
evening."
When informed of Chapman's
allegations, Barton remarked that "I
would be very disappointed if he really
did entertain those views. I see no
substance for them."
"I'm sorry if we're in for another
round of that," he continued.
Earlier this year, Chapman harshly
criticized the University's treatment of
the SDPSOA and its handling of
negotiations with the union.
Albert King, vice-president of the
SDPSOA, yesterday said Herrington
dismissed Warwick "to harass union
officials and to get them to back off
from the University."
