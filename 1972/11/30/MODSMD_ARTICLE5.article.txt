# Academic Senate Slates Review Of Future SWOPSI Structure
## 
### CHRISTY WISE 
The proposed future structure of
SWOPSI will be reviewed by the
Academic Senate on Dec. 14 when
three main charges for operation will
be presented, two of which alter the
present SWOPSI structure.
The first of these charges involves a
change in the appointment of the
student members to the SWOPSI
Policy Board which consists of five
students, five faculty members and

one non-faculty member.
As in the past, the ASSU will
nominate students to be appointed to
the board by the Committee on
Undergraduate Studies (CUS) which
also appoints the faculty members of
the board. The proposal gives the final
student appointment to the board to
the Dean of Undergraduate Studies.
The second charge stipulates that
the SWOPSI director be chosen by the
Dean of Undergraduate Studies rather
than by the SWOPSI Policy Board.
The third charge, maintaining
present structure, allows the SWOPSI
Policy Board to approve courses for
credit. If the Dean of Undergraduate
Studies doesn't like what is approved,
the course is sent to a third party, the
CUS, which then makes the final
decision.
Different Operation
"In my sense, the third charge will
be the central element in the
discussion," stated SWOPSI Director
Dan Lewis. "Although it is not
different from the way we operated
last year, it is different from the way
the rest of the university operates," he
added.

Academic Senate Chairman Halsey
Royden said, "There will probably be
substantial debate about whether
SWOPSI should continue operating in
its present form. Some faculty
members are concerned that arbitrary
standards have been used for reviewing
courses. There will probably be a
certain amount of discussion about the
SWOPSI decision not to accredit the
Shockley course."
According to 1971-72 Academic
Chairman Daniel Bershader, "The
sub-committee reviewing the history
of Shockley's proposal, although
working very hard putting in hours,
will probably not be ready to report
on Dec. 14." Bershader added, "This is
one particular course. Keep these
things in perspective."
Good Record
Lewis explained, "SWOPSI's track
record is good. We are proposing a
system which has already been shown
to work well. SWOPSI has accredited
over fifty courses which the Dean
didn't feel the need to challenge. The
Shockley proposal shouldn't be central
to the decision. It is one course which
was turned down lots of places. On the
other hand, maybe SWOPSI made a
mistake."
Bershader mentioned, "The faculty
is interested in seeing that the
standards of Stanford University are
maintained in this particular nature of
the program."
"Several faculty members were
concerned that the report about the
Department of Defense sponsored
research was not a properly rounded,
balanced picture of what the situation
is," elaborated Bershader. He added,
"Basically there is a good deal of
support among Faculty Senate
members toward innovative programs.
I suspect there is a good deal of
support and sympathy for SWOPSI."
The proposed future structure of
SWOPSI will be reviewed by the

substantial debate about whether
SWOPSI should continue operating in
its present form. Some faculty
members are concerned that arbitrary
standards have been used for reviewing
courses. There will probably be a
certain amount of discussion about the
SWOPSI decision not to accredit the
Shockley course."
According to 1971-72 Academic
Chairman Daniel Bershader, "The
sub-committee reviewing the history
of Shockley's proposal, although
working very hard putting in hours,
will probably not be ready to report
on Dec. 14." Bershader added, "This is
one particular course. Keep these
things in perspective."
Good Record
Lewis explained, "SWOPSI's track
record is good. We are proposing a
system which has already been shown
to work well. SWOPSI has accredited
over fifty courses which the Dean
didn't feel the need to challenge. The
Shockley proposal shouldn't be central
to the decision. It is one course which
was turned down lots of places. On the
other hand, maybe SWOPSI made a
mistake."
Bershader mentioned, "The faculty
is interested in seeing that the
standards of Stanford University are
maintained in this particular nature of
the program."
"Several faculty members were
concerned that the report about the
Department of Defense sponsored
research was not a properly rounded,
balanced picture of what the situation
is," elaborated Bershader. He added,
"Basically there is a good deal of
support among Faculty Senate
members toward innovative programs.
I suspect there is a good deal of
support and sympathy for SWOPSI."
The proposed future structure of
SWOPSI will be reviewed by the
Academic Senate on Dec. 14 when
three main charges for operation will
be presented, two of which alter the
present SWOPSI structure.
The first of these charges involves a
change in the appointment of the
student members to the SWOPSI
Policy Board which consists of five
students, five faculty members and

one non-faculty member.
As in the past, the ASSU will
nominate students to be appointed to
the board by the Committee on
Undergraduate Studies (CUS) which
also appoints the faculty members of
the board. The proposal gives the final
student appointment to the board to
the Dean of Undergraduate Studies.
The second charge stipulates that
the SWOPSI director be chosen by the
Dean of Undergraduate Studies rather
than by the SWOPSI Policy Board.
The third charge, maintaining
present structure, allows the SWOPSI
Policy Board to approve courses for
credit. If the Dean of Undergraduate
Studies doesn't like what is approved,
the course is sent to a third party, the
CUS, which then makes the final
decision.
Different Operation
"In my sense, the third charge will
be the central element in the
discussion," stated SWOPSI Director
Dan Lewis. "Although it is not
different from the way we operated
last year, it is different from the way
the rest of the university operates," he
added.

Royden said, "There will probably be

SWOPSI should continue operating in
