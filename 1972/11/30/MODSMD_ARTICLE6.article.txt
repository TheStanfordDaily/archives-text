## Democrats' Future 
### 
! robert bacon

The Democratic Party is in an unusual position. Its Presidential
ticket was buried under one of the largest landslides in history, but it
is as strong in Congress as it was four years ago, when it only narrowly
lost the Presidency.
In the past four years, the party has undergone massive and
unprecedented reforms. Some Democrats see as the lesson of Nov. 7
that those reforms were an utter failure because they produced an
unelectable nominee, and ought to be totally abandoned. Others take
the view that the reforms, although failing to elect a President, have
made an ideological point, and that sooner or latei, the nation will
catch up with the party.
Both elements have their point; conversely, I hope that neither
prevails in the extreme. The best hope for the Democratic party lies in
taking the best of both and the worst of neither.
On the one hand, the "old" Democratic Party won seven of nine
Presidential elections from 1932 to 1964, and elected 18 Democratic
Congresses out of 20 between 1932 and 1970. It was responsible for
great strides forward toward the goal of social justice for all. Its
backers are correct when they insist that the purpose of the
Democratic Party is to elect liberal public officials, not to make
ideological brownie points on a rule-or-ruin basis.
Conversely, those who led the party's reforms also have their valid
points. However trite it may be, it is true that times are changing.
Specifically, the enfranchisement of 18-to-21-year olds, large numbers
of blacks in the South, the non-English-speaking and more transient
elements of the population has created a new field of opportunity for
the party. And many voters in these categories do not fit within the
"Roosevelt coalition" that was the mainstay of the "old" Democratic
party.
The party should not retreat from the great strides forward it took
in 1972 toward making the Democratic party a more democratic
party. The new structure alone did not cause the defeat; a democratic
party is not a doomed party. But the framework must be widened to
admit the old partisans as well as the new.
Democrats of all persuasions should realize that their primary foe is
not each other but Richard Nixon and his policies. They must not
seek to assign blame for Sen. McGovern's defeat, or to purge, or to
ostracize. In order to elect a President in 1976, the Democrats must
regain their old strength without losing their new strength. This will
be difficult but not impossible.
In his acceptance speech, McGovern described Richard Nixon as
the greatest unifier of Democrats. Unfortunately for the party, many
Democrats were more interested in making points vis-a-vis each other
than with ousting Nixon from Pennsylvania Avenue; hence that
unifying force was not enough. The same need not happen again.
Should the second Nixon Administration prove to be as distasteful
as the first, the party should work to insure that a majority coalition
of discontent can elect a Democrat to the White House four years
hence.
The regrouping period after the Wilson administration lasted twelve
years; after Roosevelt and Truman, eight; now, after Kennedy and
Johnson, at least eight. That history suggests that there is reason for
Democrats of all persuasions to be optimistic that in 1976 the nation
will again begin to move forward in the Democratic tradition.
In the meantime, it behooves the Democratic Congress, and all
Democrats, to follow Sen. McGovern's election night advice — to
refuse to acquiesce in policies which go against Democratic ideals; to
continue to love the country; and to continue to beckon it to a higher
standard.

The Democratic Party is in an unusual position. Its Presidential
ticket was buried under one of the largest landslides in history, but it
is as strong in Congress as it was four years ago, when it only narrowly
lost the Presidency.
In the past four years, the party has undergone massive and
unprecedented reforms. Some Democrats see as the lesson of Nov. 7
that those reforms were an utter failure because they produced an
unelectable nominee, and ought to be totally abandoned. Others take
the view that the reforms, although failing to elect a President, have
made an ideological point, and that sooner or latei, the nation will
catch up with the party.
Both elements have their point; conversely, I hope that neither
prevails in the extreme. The best hope for the Democratic party lies in
taking the best of both and the worst of neither.
On the one hand, the "old" Democratic Party won seven of nine
Presidential elections from 1932 to 1964, and elected 18 Democratic
Congresses out of 20 between 1932 and 1970. It was responsible for
great strides forward toward the goal of social justice for all. Its
backers are correct when they insist that the purpose of the
Democratic Party is to elect liberal public officials, not to make
ideological brownie points on a rule-or-ruin basis.
Conversely, those who led the party's reforms also have their valid
points. However trite it may be, it is true that times are changing.
Specifically, the enfranchisement of 18-to-21-year olds, large numbers
of blacks in the South, the non-English-speaking and more transient
elements of the population has created a new field of opportunity for
the party. And many voters in these categories do not fit within the
"Roosevelt coalition" that was the mainstay of the "old" Democratic
party.
The party should not retreat from the great strides forward it took
in 1972 toward making the Democratic party a more democratic
party. The new structure alone did not cause the defeat; a democratic
party is not a doomed party. But the framework must be widened to
admit the old partisans as well as the new.
Democrats of all persuasions should realize that their primary foe is
not each other but Richard Nixon and his policies. They must not
seek to assign blame for Sen. McGovern's defeat, or to purge, or to
ostracize. In order to elect a President in 1976, the Democrats must
regain their old strength without losing their new strength. This will
be difficult but not impossible.
In his acceptance speech, McGovern described Richard Nixon as
the greatest unifier of Democrats. Unfortunately for the party, many
Democrats were more interested in making points vis-a-vis each other
than with ousting Nixon from Pennsylvania Avenue; hence that
unifying force was not enough. The same need not happen again.
Should the second Nixon Administration prove to be as distasteful
as the first, the party should work to insure that a majority coalition
of discontent can elect a Democrat to the White House four years
hence.
The regrouping period after the Wilson administration lasted twelve
years; after Roosevelt and Truman, eight; now, after Kennedy and
Johnson, at least eight. That history suggests that there is reason for
Democrats of all persuasions to be optimistic that in 1976 the nation
will again begin to move forward in the Democratic tradition.
In the meantime, it behooves the Democratic Congress, and all
Democrats, to follow Sen. McGovern's election night advice — to
refuse to acquiesce in policies which go against Democratic ideals; to
continue to love the country; and to continue to beckon it to a higher
standard.
