## Intellectuals Debate Theories Of Equality 
### 
* bill evers

Many of America's leading intellectuals are choosing
sides in the newly-revived historic controversy over
whether equality should be the goal of social policy.
Fueled by concern over specific egalitarian measures, like
the busing of public school children on a racial basis,
Nixon's and McGovern's guaranteed income proposals,
and race-related and gender-related quotas in the
universities, an intense argument has developed in the
last two years over the attainability and desirability of
equality.
The ideas which emerge from the current debate as
most convincing or most useful will doubtless shape the
public policies as well as the academic social science and
political philosophy of the future.
The place to begin reading about this issue is in the
classics on the subject: Jean-Jacques Rousseau's
egalitarian Second Discourse and George Harris'
anti-egalitarian Inequality and Progress.
For Harris, inequality is the same thing as the natural
and necessary condition of human diversity. Arno Press
and the New York Times have recently reprinted Harris'
book.
Rousseau's Solution
A special concern of Rousseau's political writings is
the artificial inequalities which he sees as stemming from
organized society. Rousseau's democratic solution is the
incorporation of individuals into a political "general
will."
Two of the sharpest contemporary dissents from the
goal of equality have been those of Irving Kristol and
Murray N. Rothbard. In the November 1972
Commentary, Kristol describes an iron law of the
bell-shaped curve in the distribution of human talents
and suggests that in modern industrial societies the
repetition of this curve in the distribution of income can
only be modified very slightly.
Kristol also complains that the proponents of

equality are unusually vague about what the concept
means. "Despite all the talk 'about equality,' no one
seems willing to commit himself to a precise definition
from which statesmen and social critics can take their
bearings."
In the summer 1971 issue of Modern Age, Rothbard
links the current advocacy of equality to the repudiation
of specialization and the division of labor found in the
Romanticist works of Rousseau and in Marx's German
Ideology.
Rothbard recommends reading Helmut Schoeck's
Envy, which Harcourt has now issued in paperback.
Rothbard maintains that Schoeck's book "makes a
powerful case for the view that the modern egalitarian
drive for socialism and similar doctrines is a pandering to
envy of the different and unequal, but that the socialist
attempt to eliminate envy through egalitarianism can
never hope to succeed. For there will always be personal
differences, such as looks, ability, health, and good or
bad fortune, which no egalitarian program, however
rigorous, can stamp out, and on which envy will be able
to fasten its concerns."
Other important attacks on egalitarian doctrines can
be found in psychologist Richard J. Herrnstein's article
in the September 1971 Atlantic saying that intelligence
is mostly determined by heredity and in the articles by
sociologists Daniel Bell, Daniel P. Moynihan, and
Seymour Martin Lipset in the fall 1972 Public Interest.
Anti-Egalitarians
Bell defends meritocracy against its historic and
current egalitarian opponents. Moynihan urges us to
look closely at "who benefits" when public programs are
expanded in the name of equality. Lipset contends that
the available data indicate social mobility has not
diminished during the period of industrial capitalism.
These and other anti-egalitarian social scientists (like
Edward Banfield and Nathan Glazer) are vigorously

opposed in a recent issue of Social Policy almost entirely
devoted to rebutting the current attacks on equality.
The publication of Christopher Jencks'study entitled
Inequality has provided ammunition for the egalitarians.
This work starts with the goal of equality, finds that
equalizing inputs in public schools has not equalized
incomes, and suggests that income should therefore be
equalized directly.
The most important recent philosophical defense of
egalitarianism is John Rawls's Theory of Justice, now
available in a paperback edition published by Harvard
University Press.
Fair Society
Rawls argues that in a just society social and
economic inequalities should be "arranged so that they
are both (a) to the greatest benefit of the least
advantaged and (b) attached to offices and positions
open to all under conditions of fair equality of
opportunity."
The excellent job Rawls does in expressing the social
democratic position is generally acknowledged, but his
goal does not go entirely unchallenged. A colleague of
Rawls in the Harvard philosophy department, Robert
Nozick, has written a book on political philosophy which
is forthcoming from Basic Books. In discussing Rawls's
theory, Nozick argues that the "snapshot" of equal hold
ings and entitlements which egalitarians picture in their
minds' eyes as their goal has within it the basis for
disintegration into a renewed condition of inequality.
The debate over human differences and equality is not
over yet, and the bibliography on the subject will
continue to grow. But the serious student will find in the
literature now available a basis on which to sort out his
own views on the matter.

never hope to succeed. For there will always be personal
differences, such as looks, ability, health, and good or
bad fortune, which no egalitarian program, however
rigorous, can stamp out, and on which envy will be able
to fasten its concerns."
Other important attacks on egalitarian doctrines can
be found in psychologist Richard J. Herrnstein's article
in the September 1971 Atlantic saying that intelligence
is mostly determined by heredity and in the articles by
sociologists Daniel Bell, Daniel P. Moynihan, and
Seymour Martin Lipset in the fall 1972 Public Interest.
Anti-Egalitarians
Bell defends meritocracy against its historic and
current egalitarian opponents. Moynihan urges us to
look closely at "who benefits" when public programs are
expanded in the name of equality. Lipset contends that
the available data indicate social mobility has not
diminished during the period of industrial capitalism.
These and other anti-egalitarian social scientists (like
Edward Banfield and Nathan Glazer) are vigorously

opposed in a recent issue of Social Policy almost entirely
devoted to rebutting the current attacks on equality.
The publication of Christopher Jencks'study entitled
Inequality has provided ammunition for the egalitarians.
This work starts with the goal of equality, finds that
equalizing inputs in public schools has not equalized
incomes, and suggests that income should therefore be
equalized directly.
The most important recent philosophical defense of
egalitarianism is John Rawls's Theory of Justice, now
available in a paperback edition published by Harvard
University Press.
Fair Society
Rawls argues that in a just society social and
economic inequalities should be "arranged so that they
are both (a) to the greatest benefit of the least
advantaged and (b) attached to offices and positions
open to all under conditions of fair equality of
opportunity."
The excellent job Rawls does in expressing the social
democratic position is generally acknowledged, but his
goal does not go entirely unchallenged. A colleague of
Rawls in the Harvard philosophy department, Robert
Nozick, has written a book on political philosophy which
is forthcoming from Basic Books. In discussing Rawls's
theory, Nozick argues that the "snapshot" of equal hold
ings and entitlements which egalitarians picture in their
minds' eyes as their goal has within it the basis for
disintegration into a renewed condition of inequality.
The debate over human differences and equality is not
over yet, and the bibliography on the subject will
continue to grow. But the serious student will find in the
literature now available a basis on which to sort out his
own views on the matter.

Many of America's leading intellectuals are choosing
sides in the newly-revived historic controversy over
whether equality should be the goal of social policy.
Fueled by concern over specific egalitarian measures, like
the busing of public school children on a racial basis,
Nixon's and McGovern's guaranteed income proposals,
and race-related and gender-related quotas in the
universities, an intense argument has developed in the
last two years over the attainability and desirability of
equality.
The ideas which emerge from the current debate as
most convincing or most useful will doubtless shape the
public policies as well as the academic social science and
political philosophy of the future.
The place to begin reading about this issue is in the
classics on the subject: Jean-Jacques Rousseau's
egalitarian Second Discourse and George Harris'
anti-egalitarian Inequality and Progress.
For Harris, inequality is the same thing as the natural
and necessary condition of human diversity. Arno Press
and the New York Times have recently reprinted Harris'
book.
Rousseau's Solution
A special concern of Rousseau's political writings is
the artificial inequalities which he sees as stemming from
organized society. Rousseau's democratic solution is the
incorporation of individuals into a political "general
will."
Two of the sharpest contemporary dissents from the
goal of equality have been those of Irving Kristol and
Murray N. Rothbard. In the November 1972
Commentary, Kristol describes an iron law of the
bell-shaped curve in the distribution of human talents
and suggests that in modern industrial societies the
repetition of this curve in the distribution of income can
only be modified very slightly.
Kristol also complains that the proponents of

equality are unusually vague about what the concept
means. "Despite all the talk 'about equality,' no one
seems willing to commit himself to a precise definition
from which statesmen and social critics can take their
bearings."
In the summer 1971 issue of Modern Age, Rothbard
links the current advocacy of equality to the repudiation
of specialization and the division of labor found in the
Romanticist works of Rousseau and in Marx's German
Ideology.
Rothbard recommends reading Helmut Schoeck's
Envy, which Harcourt has now issued in paperback.
Rothbard maintains that Schoeck's book "makes a
powerful case for the view that the modern egalitarian
drive for socialism and similar doctrines is a pandering to
envy of the different and unequal, but that the socialist
attempt to eliminate envy through egalitarianism can
never hope to succeed. For there will always be personal
differences, such as looks, ability, health, and good or
bad fortune, which no egalitarian program, however
rigorous, can stamp out, and on which envy will be able

Many of America's leading intellectuals are choosing
sides in the newly-revived historic controversy over
whether equality should be the goal of social policy.
Fueled by concern over specific egalitarian measures, like
the busing of public school children on a racial basis,
Nixon's and McGovern's guaranteed income proposals,
and race-related and gender-related quotas in the
universities, an intense argument has developed in the
last two years over the attainability and desirability of
equality.
The ideas which emerge from the current debate as
most convincing or most useful will doubtless shape the
public policies as well as the academic social science and
political philosophy of the future.
The place to begin reading about this issue is in the
classics on the subject: Jean-Jacques Rousseau's
egalitarian Second Discourse and George Harris'
anti-egalitarian Inequality and Progress.
For Harris, inequality is the same thing as the natural
and necessary condition of human diversity. Arno Press
and the New York Times have recently reprinted Harris'
book.
Rousseau's Solution
A special concern of Rousseau's political writings is
the artificial inequalities which he sees as stemming from
organized society. Rousseau's democratic solution is the
incorporation of individuals into a political "general
will."
Two of the sharpest contemporary dissents from the
goal of equality have been those of Irving Kristol and
Murray N. Rothbard. In the November 1972
Commentary, Kristol describes an iron law of the
bell-shaped curve in the distribution of human talents
and suggests that in modern industrial societies the
repetition of this curve in the distribution of income can
only be modified very slightly.
Kristol also complains that the proponents of

equality are unusually vague about what the concept
means. "Despite all the talk 'about equality,' no one
seems willing to commit himself to a precise definition
from which statesmen and social critics can take their
bearings."
In the summer 1971 issue of Modern Age, Rothbard
links the current advocacy of equality to the repudiation
of specialization and the division of labor found in the
Romanticist works of Rousseau and in Marx's German
Ideology.
Rothbard recommends reading Helmut Schoeck's
Envy, which Harcourt has now issued in paperback.
Rothbard maintains that Schoeck's book "makes a
powerful case for the view that the modern egalitarian
drive for socialism and similar doctrines is a pandering to
envy of the different and unequal, but that the socialist
attempt to eliminate envy through egalitarianism can
never hope to succeed. For there will always be personal
differences, such as looks, ability, health, and good or
bad fortune, which no egalitarian program, however
rigorous, can stamp out, and on which envy will be able
to fasten its concerns."
Other important attacks on egalitarian doctrines can
be found in psychologist Richard J. Herrnstein's article
in the September 1971 Atlantic saying that intelligence
is mostly determined by heredity and in the articles by
sociologists Daniel Bell, Daniel P. Moynihan, and
Seymour Martin Lipset in the fall 1972 Public Interest.
Anti-Egalitarians
Bell defends meritocracy against its historic and
current egalitarian opponents. Moynihan urges us to
look closely at "who benefits" when public programs are
expanded in the name of equality. Lipset contends that
the available data indicate social mobility has not
diminished during the period of industrial capitalism.
These and other anti-egalitarian social scientists (like
Edward Banfield and Nathan Glazer) are vigorously

opposed in a recent issue of Social Policy almost entirely
devoted to rebutting the current attacks on equality.
The publication of Christopher Jencks'study entitled
Inequality has provided ammunition for the egalitarians.
This work starts with the goal of equality, finds that
equalizing inputs in public schools has not equalized
incomes, and suggests that income should therefore be
equalized directly.
The most important recent philosophical defense of
egalitarianism is John Rawls's Theory of Justice, now
available in a paperback edition published by Harvard
University Press.
Fair Society
Rawls argues that in a just society social and
economic inequalities should be "arranged so that they
are both (a) to the greatest benefit of the least
advantaged and (b) attached to offices and positions
open to all under conditions of fair equality of
opportunity."
The excellent job Rawls does in expressing the social
democratic position is generally acknowledged, but his
goal does not go entirely unchallenged. A colleague of
Rawls in the Harvard philosophy department, Robert
Nozick, has written a book on political philosophy which
is forthcoming from Basic Books. In discussing Rawls's
theory, Nozick argues that the "snapshot" of equal hold
ings and entitlements which egalitarians picture in their
minds' eyes as their goal has within it the basis for
disintegration into a renewed condition of inequality.
The debate over human differences and equality is not
over yet, and the bibliography on the subject will
continue to grow. But the serious student will find in the
literature now available a basis on which to sort out his
own views on the matter.
