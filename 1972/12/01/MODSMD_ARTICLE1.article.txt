# Blacks Getting Together Creates Racial Grouping
## 
### BOB LITTERMAN 
"White people in Roble feel
alienated towards the blacks. It's their
dorm. You almost feel like an
outsider," says Mike Peterson, a white
freshman living there.
"It isn't a set segregation," says
Roble house president Reggie Turner,
a black. "Black students like to spend
a lot of time together, so do white
students."
Reactions vary, but the
phenomenon is familiar — black
students in dorms, in classes, at dinner,
and in many facets of campus life are
more likely to form a group among
themselves than to mix with whites.
The same could probably be said of
any social group, but with blacks the
phenomenon has become somewhat of
an issue.
Time magazine last week ran a

story in their education section titled
"The Two Societies," which featured
two pictures from Stanford. One
showed a line of white students
waiting for food in Roble's dining
room B. The other showed a table of
black students in Roble's dining room
A with the following cutline: "black
students in same dorm eat in separate
dining room."
Most residents feel the magazine
simplified and overstated the situation.
The dorm, known officially as the
"black theme house," is only 30
percent black. Even if all the black
students ate together they would not
fill room A. Still, the fact is that very
few blacks eat in room B, and the
whites that do eat in room A often sit
at all white tables.
When the Time photographer came
to Roble a few weeks ago and
explained he was taking pictures to
illustrate black self-segregation, one
black woman told him "you've come
to the right place."
Other Segregation
In addition to the Roble dining
situation the phenomenon occurs in
other areas. In classes with large
numbers of students, often one area of
the class becomes a gathering point for
the black students. Tables of students
eating in Tresidder are more likely to
be all black or all white than
integrated. At the varsity football
training tables blacks eat separately.
The racial grouping is often found
at parties. In Roble, for example, the
parties are often segregated. When the
BSU holds a function there, it is all
black. "No one says anything if a
white walks in," noted one resident,
"but you get the picture pretty
quickly."
Says Patty Fels, a white
sophomore, "There are no written
rules, but you learn really fast. . . it's
really bad."
Even all-dorm functions, which are
integrated to some extent, reflect the
phenomenon. Whites tend to group
themselves, as do blacks. Faculty
resident Warren Hayman noted, for

example, that at parties, "the question
arises of which music is going to be
played. Blacks like to listen to black
music, and whites groove on other
music. People shouldn't be expected
to be the same. White students have
got to realize that the melting pot
myth is just that — a myth."
An integrated couple would stand
out at Roble. Turner admits that
"they would go through a lot from
both sides." He added that "white
guys ask about black girls a lot, but
black guys would never talk about
white girls. That's kind of taboo, just
because it's an old white stereotype."
Black's Attitude
"Blacks have kind of a cliquish
attitude towards whites," says Bob
Hiserodt, a white freshman in Roble,
"they might feel that people would
talk about them if they mix with
whites."
Various reasons are given for the
lack of racial mixing. Turner explains
it as simply a "strength in numbers"
situation. Hayman explains that
"blacks at a white University like
Stanford face a hostile environment.
Whenever people have common
problems and interests they come
together. It has nothing to do with
segregation or integration."
According to assistant to the
President James Simmons, a black,
"The reason for this separation is that
we really want to get ourselves
together. White kids ought not to see
this as a rejection out of hatred. It is
really a rejection out of love of self. If
bloods like to be with each other
better, it's because we can learn more
about ourselves from each other; we
get strength from each other."
BSU chairman Charles Ogletree says
the BSU definitely supports black
segregation. "The reason we support
separtism, segregation, trying to get
ourselves together, or whatever you
want to call it, is because we are trying
to build a black family concept. We
are supporting our own activities with
our own bodies, our own work, our

SELF-SEGREGATION At Roble's 'A' dining hall, blacks and whites nearly invariably sit at separate tables. The 'B'
dining hall is nearly 100 percent white. These facts were recently used in a Time magazine article about segregation at
Roble.
