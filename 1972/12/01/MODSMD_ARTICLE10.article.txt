# ending with a bang
## A 						Flight Of Fancy

This is my last column of the quarter. I'll be back
in January, but today I feel obliged to provide some
sweeping panorama, some broad yet penetrating
overview that will leave its impression firm until the
new year.
And so I offer a suggestion for Stanford — a new
tradition, really — which will bring a profound, new
meaning to these last days of Autumn quarter.
It has long been the habit of the peoples of many
civilized nations to pause for a moment at the year's
end, and reflect upon their futures. Should not the
Stanford community as well make such a
self-reflection?
Drawing from the pomp and richness of
Stanford's past, I have conceptualized just such a
gathering. Thus, I propose that we end each
calendar year on campus like this:
Preliminary Measures
During the Thanksgiving recess, a Stanford
Committee of the Esoteric will choose a theme for
the gathering and will inform the Stanford
community of its choice by painting the theme on
all major campus buildings.
Student valedictorians will then be selected, on
the basis of their speech ability, clarity of content,
and their true representiveness of divergent views of
opinion.
Decorations crews, costume designers, cooking
committees, props specialists, and crowd control
supervisors will all prepare furiously for the great
day.
Students, deep in thought about the theme, will
design and construct personal emblems which they
will carry on the end of tall poles during the
procession held on the great day.
Ah — yes: the theme! Every year the Committee
will deliberate thoughtfully, every year they will
consider many suggestions, and every year they will
choose the same theme: LESSONS OF THE PAST
- CHALLENGE FOR THE FUTURE.
The Day Arrives
At last the day arrives! On this day (traditionally
the Saturday after dead week) the entire Stanford
community gathers at the comer of Campus Drive
and Lasuen Mall.
There they form into ranks of seven (a number
that signifies the great striving we must anticipate
before we reach our goals), and begin a march down
White Plaza, silent except for the rhythmic

occasional pounding of a bass drum.
Imagine the scene: a legion of thousands, seven
abreast, all out of step, each carrying a different
emblem, and everyone wearing a cardinal and white
bathrobe.
In fact, there are two processions from the
observers' point of view — one of the like-clad
people, symbolizing rigid conformity to the
standards of academic excellence, and one of the
emblems bouncing on high, standing for the rugged
individualism that must never be sacrificed in the
pursuit of higher education.
As the procession reaches the Oval (at the head
of Palm Drive in front of the Quad), groups of
Physical Ed. instructors in flowing white fortrel
polyester robes toss boughs of ivy at the marchers'
sandaled feet.
Approaching A Climax
The speeches are then given, with muffled
applause allowed at the end of each one. Following
that event, the entire gathering next observes ten
minutes of personal introspection about the future,
with the background accompaniment of a recording
of "In-a-Gadda-Da-Vida."
All heads tilt skyward, as if pulled by hidden
strings from below, to observe the day's climax.
From out of a cloud-laden heaven, following the
path of a narrow sunbeam, comes a giant hot air
balloon.
Dangling from-the wicker basket at the balloon's
base is a long banner; as the airborne gas bag
appraoches terra firma, ten thousand throats shout
out the banner's inscription: BEAT CAL.
Wax Figurine
Then, as basket and balloon hover a scant
distance above the central quad, a rope ladder
drops, and down it comes the wax figurine
(borrowed from Ripley's) of Leland Stanford
Senior.
A tape recording hidden in his beard, the
venerable Senator booms to the crowd, arms
outstretched, "Now all the children of California
will be my children!"
Great hurrahs! go up from the audience and
much feasting and merriment ensue. Cauldrons of
steaming hot food service delights are brought in
and all share in the magnificent repast, looking
joyously and without trepidation toward the days
ahead at Stanford.
(Jerry Coleman is out of his fucking mind!)
