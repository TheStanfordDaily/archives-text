Journalistic Responsibility
Editor:
Both the manner in which the
allegation was made and the front
page Daily (Nov. 29) coverage of
the allegation, that a member of
last year's ASSU Council of
Presidents improperly used
student funds raises important
about the ASSU senator
who made the allegations and the
journalistic responsibility of the
newspaper that printed the
allegations.
Of course, members of the
ASSU Senate have the right and
responsibility to insure that
student funds are properly
handled. However, given the
extreme seriousness of the
accusations involved, a more
responsible to approach the
matter would have been for the
senator to have privately asked

the financial manager about the
expenditure in question, and if no
satisfaction was received, then a
senate investigation would have
been proper.
By "grandstanding" the
question, one wonders whether
the senator was interested in the
truth about the expenditure or
whether the greater interest was
to slur Mr. McHenry. If the
interest was the former, the
matter was handled with a lack of
responsibility; if the interest was
the latter, the act was obviously
petty and thoroughly disgusting.
Whatever were the intentions
of the senator, the Daily's
reporting job was extremely
negligent at best. Normally, when
a serious accusation is made, a
reporter takes some additional
steps to verify the matter before
printing. At the minimum, Mr.
McHenry should have been
contacted for a response. As I
have understood Daily policy in
the past, such attempts at
verification are made as a matter
of routine. Why these checks were
not made raises issues of motive.
Even though retractions are
printed with respect to these
accusations, much damage will
remain. Initial accusations
normally have greater impact than
subsequent retractions. Persons
who read the first story may not
read later stories.
Minority group leaders
throughout the nation who are
moving into positions of political
power are experiencing numerous
unsubstantiated attacks on their
character and purpose. Certainly,
we should be able to expect more
of the campus newspaper than to
fall prey to this syndrome.

(Editor's note: The situation
deserves some explanation. The
Daily article in question did not
make any allegations whatsoever
concerning McHenry â€” rather, it
clearly attributed the statement in
question to Sen. Barker, and
noted that ASSU Financial
Manager Sara Moore would
investigate. This investigation
showed that Barker's charge
stemmed from a facetious item
listed by McHenry. Our error was
not in printing the statement,
rather it was in not immediately
contacting McHenry for his
statement. Time pressures
prevented this from being done,
and for this the Daily apologizes.)
'Unwarranted Attack
on Doug McHenry'
Editor:
It is quite a surprise viewing
the levels to which individuals will
lower themselves in attempts to
degrade others. The negativism by
which the Stanford Community is
bent on viewing Doug McHenry,
former President of the ASSU
Council of Presidents, is quite
absurd. The Black Community is
continually forced to defend
those individuals who have
attempted to protect the interests
of the community.
In the Daily article dated Nov.
29, McHenry had been accused of
using University money for
gambling debts. Such accusations
evidence distorted facts and
outright lies. Before such
statements are printed and carried
over the air (KZSU News, Nov.
29), those accused should be
contacted. Until such time that
such accusations are verified those
individuals responsible for
presenting the information should
refrain from such acts.
Doug McHenry was
instrumental in initiating several
important programs during his
term which the media has to date
failed to mention, (i.e. Student
Intern program, Political Prisoners
Conference, Angela Davis Defense
Committee, Northern California
Black Student Association, etc.).
The unprovoked abuse given
Doug McHenry since his leaving
office has caused unbearable
hardships which he has,
understandably, refused to even
encourage or accept sympathy

from the Stanford Community.
We would hope that it is not your
intention to "systematically
eliminate" another potential black
leader.
We have not questioned Doug's
integrity and we don't feel others
should. We would hope that the
various methods of
communication used to imply
misgivings about particular
individuals, such as McHenry,
would cease. Such acts are not
called for and viewed as having
racist implications in the Black
Community. In the future, a
policy of knowing the facts before
presenting the facts would be the
proper procedure.

'Serious Misimpressions'
Editor:
The Nov. 29, issue of the Daily
contained an article headline
"Student Senate Approves '72-'73
Budget,"and a cartoon entitled
"Student Government in Action."
Both probably left those who read
them with some serious
misimpressions.
The budget article asserted that
ASSU Financial Manager Sara
Moore said "use of meal cards
paid for by the students for the
ASSU Presidents would be
reviewed," and quoted her as
commenting that "Last year it
was totally abused."
When the present ASSU
Co-Presidents took office last
May, we were very surprised to be
informed by the Financial
Manager that one or more
members of the preceding group
had used ASSU funds to purchase
meals in the dorms, rather than
buying meal cards with their own
personal funds.
While we understood that our
predecessors felt this was justified,
we decided to change the policy.
Neither the students nor anyone
but ourselves pay for our meal
cards or for meals in the dorms. I,
for instance, pay full board at
Lambda Nu Fraternity.
The funds used last year for
dorm meals this year are devoted
exclusively to buying sandwiches
or meals for meetings with
student committee members or
University administrators.
The cartoon which you
published pictured a creature
representing the student
government axing the budget
request of the Daily and implying
that such cuts are related to
editorials run by the newspaper.
The fact of the matter is that
the cartoon in question in no way
relates to circumstances at
Stanford. The Daily does not
make budget requests of the
ASSU, nor has the student
government sought to exercize
any control over Daily budgets
since 1970. Indeed, the present
ASSU has cooperated in every
way to make the Daily totally
independent of the University and
of the student government.
The present ASSU
Co-Presidents endorsed and
worked for passage of the Daily
independence resolution
appearing on the ballot last
month. Last April, we endorsed
the fee assessment which helps
support the Daily. The present
Senate unanimously approved
extension of the deadline for
Daily independence from Jan. 1
to Feb. 15.
It may have been somewhat
unfair to run that cartoon without
clearly explaining that it had no
relation to present circumstances
at this University.
Scott Burke
ASSU Co-President
(Editor's Note: The cartoon in
question was drawn by Gene
Mater, a professional cartoonist
from Pennsylvania. Mater sells
cartoons to many college
newspapers, and consequently the
cartoon did not refer specifically
to Stanford. We regret any
misunderstanding caused by its
publication.)
