Why no mail pickup on weekends anymore? G.G.
The mail pickup from collection boxes on weekends has been cut
back as part of an economy move on the part of the post office. There
are still some boxes with weekend pickup, but only at post offices,
branch offices and arterial boxes.
All boxes have stickers attached which tell where the nearest
weekend and late pickup box is located. This cutback is only one of
several the post office has been taking to cut back its overhead.
How are the Sunday flicks selected? Also, how much is the Sunday
flicks manager paid? J. C.
Baker Terry, the Sunday flicks manager, explained that they are
picked by him on the basis of a survey taken once a year. The
manager takes a list of the most popular films and determines which
are available.
The film must be expected to attract a large enough crowd to make
money while keeping the prices down. Because of a large overhead, he
says that at least 2000 people must attend before the flicks make
money.
The flicks picked so far for next quarter are "French Connection,
Camelot, Bonnie and Clyde, and Play It Again Sam.
The flicks manager is paid $30 per film plus any profits up to a
certain limit. The limit on the profit sharing is that it cannot be
greater than 2.4 percent of the revenues if the movie has a 50 cent
charge, or 1.2 percent of revenues if there is a 75 cent charge.
Does the University Business and Finance office have the facilities
and personnel to do a cost-effectiveness study of a particular aspect of
the University's operations? If so, how is such a study initiated? R.C.
The Business and Finance office does have the staff, and according
to Deputy Vice President Frank Riddle they do studies like that all
the time.
The two types of studies they do are analytical and managerial.
The analytical study looks at the cost-effectiveness of what is being
done now and what it costs. This type of study is used by the Budget
Adjustment Program to determine where changes should be made.
The managerial studies act as a sort of an internal management
consulting group, making suggestions of how facilities can be best
used.
If you have any suggestions for such studies in administrative areas
write them down and send them to Bob Augsberger or Ken Creighton.
If your suggestions are in academic areas send them to Bill Miller or
Ray Bachetti.
