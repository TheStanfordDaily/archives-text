# Hoover Scholar Reviews Myths And Pentagon Papers
## 
### 
One important lesson of the Pentagon Papers is
that much of the so-called credibility gap which the
U.S. government has suffered on the Vietnam war is
due to inaccurate statements from misinformed
scholars, newsmen, and public figures.
This is the conclusion Hoover Institution
Research Associate Robert Turner reaches in
"Myths of the Vietnam War: The Pentagon Papers
Reconsidered," an article appearing in Southeast
Asia Perspectives.
I urner, who has been in South Vietnam three
times, twice with the North Vietnamese/Viet Cong
Affairs Division of the Joint U.S. Public Affairs
Office of the American Embassy in Saigon,
concludes:
"It is difficult ... to read the Pentagon Papers
without being impressed with how frequently the
government has been right about Vietnam,
especially during the earlier days of our
involvement.. . .
"In retrospect, for example, the government

analysis ot the 1968 Viet Cong Tet Offensive was
clearly more accurate than those of most of the
press and other critics like Daniel Ellsberg, who
concluded that 'the war is over,' that 'it is the death
of pacification,' and that 'two months from
now ... things are going to get much worse.'
"From a military standpoint, the Tet Offensive
was a major defeat for the communists. Thanks to
excessively pessimistic journalistic accounts and the
totally erroneous predictions of critics like Ellsberg,
let was transformed into a major Viet Cong victory
in the minds of the American people."
Another anti-war belief is that, if the U.S. had
just left Ho Chi Minh alone, he would have become
another 1 ito, serving to block Chinese expansion
southward. But, regarding the Titoist argument, the
Pentagon Papers note that "a dynamic and unified
Communist Vietnam under Ho Chi Minh could have
been vigorously expansionist, thus causing
unanticipated difficult problems in some ways
comparable to current ones."
