# Daumier Exhibit Extended
## 
### JOHN LOOMIS 
The exhibit of lithographs by
Honore Daumier now on display
at the Stanford Art Gallery has
been extended until Dec. 31. This
exhibit is worth seeing because it
brings to light the work of one of
the most brilliant political satirists
who ever lived. Daumier was also
a well known painter and
sculptor, but his main talent lay in
his political caricatures as can be
seen in this show.
For Daumier art was not
merely for the intellectual pursuit
of some abstract aesthetic or ideal
of beauty. Instead, it was a tool of
political and social
communication. Daumier himself
had strong political convictions.

The July revolution of 1830
brought to the throne Louis
Phillippe with a promise of
reform.
But reform remained only a
promise, and Daumier attacked
the crown with his cartoons
culminating in his arrest and
imprisonment for six months in
1832. The offensive work was
called "Gargantua," in which
Louis Phillippe, portrayed as an
obese giant sitting on a toilet
throne being fed gold by the
workers and defecating favors,
medals, and titles to the
privileged.
"Gargantua" was only one of
the many works that had upset
the government. Earlier Daumier
had done a series of heads of
Louis Phillippe abstracting the
shape of his head into a pear
(metaphor for a fool in French).
For this he had been fined, to
which he responded, ironically, by
selling a limited edition of this
lithograph to pay the fine.
Idealized Worker
Freedom of the press was
logically a subject for several

works by Daumier. The most
famous, "Freedom of the Press,"
"Don't Meddle With It," focuses
on an idealized worker, champion
of the proletariat, a figure that
was to be further developed in
later socialist art.
Due to the strict censorship
laws of 1836, Daumier was forced
to stop ridiculing public officials,
especially the king. He therefore
turned to social types: lawyers,
bankers, and capitalists. During
the 1840's he took on the Paris
middle class in a series called "Les
Types Parisiens."
Interestingly enough,
Daumier's radical social and
political ideals did not extend
towards feminism. For women
seeking careers in a "man's world"
and demanding equal rights, he
stood .a Frenchman. These
enlightened women, too, felt the
weight of his ridicule in such
lithographs as "Les Femmes
socialistes," where they were
portrayed as self-righteous,
unattractive, old maids.
Daumier's lithographs are not
all humorous, grotesque
charicatures. One of his most
beautiful serious works is "Rue
Transnomain." In 1834 there
occured an incident all too
familiar to us today. The civil
guard, called out to quell a
worker's revolt, was fired upon
from an unknown building. In
retaliation they marched into a
nearby building and slaughtered

fourteen men, women and
children.
Not Far Away
In a world of Kent States, My
Lais and Southern Universities,
Daumier is not far away. He
represented the horror felt in a
well thought out, long worked
upon composition showing a
father spread out Christ-like over
the bodies of his children.
Daumier's feeling for the rich
blacks of lithography here add a
new dimension to his art.
Daumier must stand out in
history as one of the first artists
who not only exists outside of the
patronage of the establishment,
but harshly attacks that
establishment and its values.
Though Daumier had an academic
education, he refused to live the
traditional role of the artist,
catering to bourgeois taste. Due to
his own inventiveness and talent
he also stands far above many
other political satirists.
The Daumier exhibit will be at
the Gallery until December 31.
The hours of the Gallery are
Tuesday through Friday: 10-5 and
Saturday and Sunday: 1-5.
