# Academic Senate Rejects Plans To Expand Student Role In CJP
## 
### CHARLIE HOFFMAN 
The Faculty Senate refused
yesterday to send recommendations
calling for the expansion of students'
roles in the campus judicial process to
the Committee of Fifteen (C-15).
Asst. Prof. of Electrical
Engineering, Edward S. Davidson had
drawn up the recommendations in
response to a petition signed by 58
Academic Council members.
The petitioners had hoped to have
the Faculty Senate charge the C-15 —
composed of students, faculty, and
Administration members and
responsible for the development of
changes in the campus judicial system
— with examining the following
proposals:
—to provide students with a trial by
peers;

—to provide students in disciplinary
proceedings with the minimum of
constitutional rights accorded criminal
defendants;
—to limit the residual authority of
the University president in matters of
student discipline;
—to develop the details of the
above amendments for the purpose of
making student discipline policy
acceptable to the three constituencies
required for approval — the student
body, the Academic Council, and the
president.
Changes 'Objectionable'
Chairman of last year's C-15, Elec.
Engineering Prof. Frederick Crawford,
stated that he found the proposed
changes "objectionable." He claimed
that the "C-15 wants to heal the
wounds caused by campus judicial

process issue" but acknowledged that
it is a difficult task to determine what
the community wants. "Any system
has to be approved by the Academic
Council, the student Senate, and the
president," Crawford continued, "but
do these bodies represent their
constituents?"
The debate indicated that there was
little chance of the amendments'
passage and the Senate indeed turned
them down 6-27 with eight
abstentions.
In his report to the Senate, Acting
President William F. Miller announced
thai the preparation of the 1973-74
budget has begun. Miller stated that
the University was under "intense"
financial pressure and has a one
million dollar budget gap to close. The
combination of student attrition and

the failure of income projections to
meet expectations has accounted for
the gap. Miller said he was confident
that the gap, which the University has
to close at this time every year, could
be handled through cutbacks and
selective denials of fund requests.
