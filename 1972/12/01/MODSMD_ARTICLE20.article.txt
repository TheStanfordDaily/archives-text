## Entertainment 'Father's Day' Is No Picnic 
### STU ALLEN 
The current Berkeley
Repertory production of Oliver
Hailey's "Father's Day" is an
entertaining show that draws
capacity audiences to the Theatre.
It is, however, an imperfect play,
and not profound in any sense of
the word.
The story concerns the brittle
bitterness of divorce for three
women whose children have been
away for an afternoon trip with
their fathers — the wives' former
husbands — because it is, after all,
Father's Day. The men are invited
back after the trip for a cocktail
hour of whiskey and
recrimination.
The women characters are
more important to the play, the
first act being devoted to them
exclusively. One is a hardbitten
actress who is quick with
humorous insults that are usually
comic only because of her
relentlessness.
Her belief that her friend's
ex-husband is now a homosexual
is "not likely to be dissuaded by
circumstantial evidence," remarks

the third ex-wife. The part of the
actress is portrayed by Holly
Barron with more grace than it
deserves, and the production
benefits thereby.
The other two ladies are the
daughter of a Communist essayist
of the 1930's and an orphan. The
snobbery of the essayist's
daughter, who is ladylike to a
fault, is presented by leClanche du
Rand with an exceedingly credible
combination of awkwardness and
strain with graciousness.
The third, whose husband is
suspected of being a homosexual
until he reveals his longstanding
romance with a poor duPont, is an
orphan who is looking for
parentage, but could never
infiltrate a family. This role is
played by Leigh Blicher without
successfully bringing Hailey's
narrow character to life.
Blicher's character
illustrates the major weaknesses of
the play, as all the characters are
poorly developed by the author
with the exception of the part
played by leClanche dußand.
While her part seems to have been

deeply felt by the author, the
other roles are generally
tiresomely repetitive.
While there are some very
sardonic lines, the attempt to
make the actress' commonplace
humor witty by the addition of
references to Doris Day and June
Allyson is too transparent to be
effective.
An example of this ineffective
characterization comes at the end
of the play, when the three
women are again alone, this time
making heavy-handed allusions to
Chekhov. This scene is neither
touching nor funny, and one
leaves the theater somewhat
disappointed.
It seems the audiences are
drawn by the fast-paced humor
that the director, Michael Leibert,
extracts from the script with his
skillful blocking designed to
emphasize not the allegedly
serious message of the play but its
comic interplay of unrealistic
characters in unbelievable
situations. The continual
movement reminds one of
television comedies.

relentlessness.
Her belief that her friend's
ex-husband is now a homosexual
is "not likely to be dissuaded by
circumstantial evidence," remarks

the third ex-wife. The part of the
actress is portrayed by Holly
Barron with more grace than it
deserves, and the production
benefits thereby.
The other two ladies are the
daughter of a Communist essayist
of the 1930's and an orphan. The
snobbery of the essayist's
daughter, who is ladylike to a
fault, is presented by leClanche du
Rand with an exceedingly credible
combination of awkwardness and
strain with graciousness.
The third, whose husband is
suspected of being a homosexual
until he reveals his longstanding
romance with a poor duPont, is an
orphan who is looking for
parentage, but could never
infiltrate a family. This role is
played by Leigh Blicher without
successfully bringing Hailey's
narrow character to life.
Blicher's character
illustrates the major weaknesses of
the play, as all the characters are
poorly developed by the author
with the exception of the part
played by leClanche dußand.
While her part seems to have been

deeply felt by the author, the
other roles are generally
tiresomely repetitive.
While there are some very
sardonic lines, the attempt to
make the actress' commonplace
humor witty by the addition of
references to Doris Day and June
Allyson is too transparent to be
effective.
An example of this ineffective
characterization comes at the end
of the play, when the three
women are again alone, this time
making heavy-handed allusions to
Chekhov. This scene is neither
touching nor funny, and one
leaves the theater somewhat
disappointed.
It seems the audiences are
drawn by the fast-paced humor
that the director, Michael Leibert,
extracts from the script with his
skillful blocking designed to
emphasize not the allegedly
serious message of the play but its
comic interplay of unrealistic
characters in unbelievable
situations. The continual
movement reminds one of
television comedies.
The current Berkeley
Repertory production of Oliver
Hailey's "Father's Day" is an
entertaining show that draws
capacity audiences to the Theatre.
It is, however, an imperfect play,
and not profound in any sense of
the word.
The story concerns the brittle
bitterness of divorce for three
women whose children have been
away for an afternoon trip with
their fathers — the wives' former
husbands — because it is, after all,
Father's Day. The men are invited
back after the trip for a cocktail
hour of whiskey and
recrimination.
The women characters are
more important to the play, the
first act being devoted to them
exclusively. One is a hardbitten
actress who is quick with
humorous insults that are usually
comic only because of her
relentlessness.
