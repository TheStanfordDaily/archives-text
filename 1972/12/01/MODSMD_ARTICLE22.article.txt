# Latest Issue Of 'Sequoia' Shows High Accomplishment
## 
### NANCY H. PACKER 
The first thing I want to say about the new
"Sequoia" is that I like it. The intentions of
the magazine are literary but unpretentious
and they are accomplished. The editorial taste
is consistent and pleasing. The quality of the
individual work is high, some of it
outstanding.
Some student-managed publications, in the
past occasionally including "Sequoia," suffer
from an excess of ambition uninformed by
irony or practicality. A few come on as
editorial ego trips. Many have seemed intent
on breaking new trails, but over terrain that
was at once well-worn and impenetrable and
with tools that were, to say the least,
untempered. (Getting entangled in a metaphor
like that ought to have some pedagogic value.)
Some magazines have lacked a unified
editorial taste and one or two have lacked
"good taste" in that they sacrificed discretion
and reserve to shock and vulgarity.
The editing of this issue suffers none of
these ailments. In my lexicon of criticism this
is not damning with faint praise. While
individual artists ought to set tasks beyond
their present means, ought to strive for higher
ground, a board of editors ought to strive
after balance, measure, the graspable. A
publication should be a showcase for the
artists rather than putting itself forth as the
thing to be admired. Judged by this standard,
this "Sequoia" succeeds admirably.
The editorial hand is modest,
unpretentious, open, and has created a fine
opportunity for the artists. ISven the strong,
distinct woodcuts and drawings of Mark
Rathbun are, with the exception of the
illustration of Stillman's poems, in the service
of the literary work. Except for that one
illustration, Rathbun does not compete or
attempt to dominate, he does not say, "Look,
Ma, I'm drawing." So too with the format, the
type, the placement of the pieces, all are in
the service of the poems and stories. Nothing
is cute.
In commenting on the poetry, I feel
slightly out of my depth. Over the last two
years or so I have occasionally thought that
maybe I was the only person at Stanford not
writing poetry.

The centerpiece of the poems, and of the
magazine, is the group by Diane Middlebrook.
These are the first poems of Prof.
Middlebrook that I have read and I thought
they were fine: humane, poignant, intimate
and sophisticated in meaning and graceful and
surprising in the way they took shape. You
don't just read these poems, you really
experience them.
Michael B. Stillman's five Improvisations
on Shakespearean Themes requires a more
cerebral attention as well as a closer physical
look. The way the poet has set the lines down
sculpts the page, forces the eye to stretch as it
causes the mind to pause. Being stodgy, I
usually resist this kind of thing, and I admit
that it took several readings before I could see
that there was a gain in the method, that
something actually happens in the reader's
understanding as a result of the sculpting.
Stillman has a sure hand with his method and
his complex themes.
One of the problems of "Sequoia" in the
past was nepotism, with the editorial board
and friends dominating the printed pages.
There are two editors represented in this issue.
Dana Gioia, the head editor, has a translation,
or adaptation, from Rilke but it seems fully
justified: it is an invitation to the reader to
use "eyes which have forgotten how to see"
and is one of the best poems from the
younger writers. The other staff member,
Christine Cozzens, has two poems on
interesting themes, Virginia Woolf's suicide
and Andrew Wyeth's most famous painting.
Both poems are slight but strike the
imagination.
Looking through the list of contributors, I
noticed that these two are the only "presently
matriculated" students, and that seems to me
bad, a real weakness of the issue. Two
ex-students, David Scranton and John Weeks,
are represented, the former with a poem that
depends on the reader's willingness to
visualize color for himself, and the latter two
poems that are airy and pleasant.
Finally, two persons whose connection
with the University is unclear: Vicky Kouba
with a poem to Winter and Karen Bunting
with two good, tough, ironic poems. I have
long since run out of appropriate adjectives

and so suggest you read these poems yourself.
The short stories strike me as very strong,
both in their subject matter and in the skill of
their treatment. I suggested earlier that the
magazine had not failed the test of "good
taste" but I did not mean to imply a
blue-stocking aspect, as witness these stories.
Louie Nussbaum's graphic account of a
rape is neither sentimental nor tough-guy, but
rather a deeply rendered experience that the
reader can share in a way he could never share
a purely factual account. The story is at its
best when the writer deals directly with the
girl. The opening pages, describing the rapist's
conversation, seemed to me a little long and
non-functional in terms of developing the
feeling of the story. But that is no doubt a
quibble.
I laughed out loud half a dozen times while
reading Steve Babson's story of a young man's
fantasies of greatness as a writer and sexual
athleticism. My laughter was tinged with
anxiety: Babson's best wit is spent on two
creative writing instructors and I kept waiting
for the guillotine to fall on my neck. "Kept
waiting" implies that it never did. Did it? Did
it?
Criticism. Too little student poetry. This is
after all a student magazine and there must be
some poets. I like having non-student work
but there ought to be more student stuff
around among all the people writing poetry.
No articles or essays or book reviews or
comments. Mostly, though, the price: one
dollar. I am not privy to the financial
arrangements of "Sequoia" but I assume that
there are subsidies from ASSU and the
Creative Writing Center and these subsidies are
more or less fixed regardless of the number of
issues.
Better two issues at fifty cents an issue
than four issues at a dollar. The magazine
ought to be within the reach of practically
every Stanford student, which fifty cents just
about is. This is a good publication that ought
to make the University proud, but it ought
not to be priced to compete with major
magazines.

from an excess of ambition uninformed by
irony or practicality. A few come on as
editorial ego trips. Many have seemed intent
on breaking new trails, but over terrain that
was at once well-worn and impenetrable and
with tools that were, to say the least,
untempered. (Getting entangled in a metaphor
like that ought to have some pedagogic value.)
Some magazines have lacked a unified
editorial taste and one or two have lacked
"good taste" in that they sacrificed discretion
and reserve to shock and vulgarity.
The editing of this issue suffers none of
these ailments. In my lexicon of criticism this
is not damning with faint praise. While
individual artists ought to set tasks beyond
their present means, ought to strive for higher
ground, a board of editors ought to strive
after balance, measure, the graspable. A
publication should be a showcase for the
artists rather than putting itself forth as the
thing to be admired. Judged by this standard,
this "Sequoia" succeeds admirably.
The editorial hand is modest,
unpretentious, open, and has created a fine
opportunity for the artists. ISven the strong,
distinct woodcuts and drawings of Mark
Rathbun are, with the exception of the
illustration of Stillman's poems, in the service
of the literary work. Except for that one
illustration, Rathbun does not compete or
attempt to dominate, he does not say, "Look,
Ma, I'm drawing." So too with the format, the
type, the placement of the pieces, all are in
the service of the poems and stories. Nothing
is cute.
In commenting on the poetry, I feel
slightly out of my depth. Over the last two
years or so I have occasionally thought that
maybe I was the only person at Stanford not
writing poetry.

The centerpiece of the poems, and of the
magazine, is the group by Diane Middlebrook.
These are the first poems of Prof.
Middlebrook that I have read and I thought
they were fine: humane, poignant, intimate
and sophisticated in meaning and graceful and
surprising in the way they took shape. You
don't just read these poems, you really
experience them.
Michael B. Stillman's five Improvisations
on Shakespearean Themes requires a more
cerebral attention as well as a closer physical
look. The way the poet has set the lines down
sculpts the page, forces the eye to stretch as it
causes the mind to pause. Being stodgy, I
usually resist this kind of thing, and I admit
that it took several readings before I could see
that there was a gain in the method, that
something actually happens in the reader's
understanding as a result of the sculpting.
Stillman has a sure hand with his method and
his complex themes.
One of the problems of "Sequoia" in the
past was nepotism, with the editorial board
and friends dominating the printed pages.
There are two editors represented in this issue.
Dana Gioia, the head editor, has a translation,
or adaptation, from Rilke but it seems fully
justified: it is an invitation to the reader to
use "eyes which have forgotten how to see"
and is one of the best poems from the
younger writers. The other staff member,
Christine Cozzens, has two poems on
interesting themes, Virginia Woolf's suicide
and Andrew Wyeth's most famous painting.
Both poems are slight but strike the
imagination.
Looking through the list of contributors, I
noticed that these two are the only "presently
matriculated" students, and that seems to me
bad, a real weakness of the issue. Two
ex-students, David Scranton and John Weeks,
are represented, the former with a poem that
depends on the reader's willingness to
visualize color for himself, and the latter two
poems that are airy and pleasant.
Finally, two persons whose connection
with the University is unclear: Vicky Kouba
with a poem to Winter and Karen Bunting
with two good, tough, ironic poems. I have
long since run out of appropriate adjectives

and so suggest you read these poems yourself.
The short stories strike me as very strong,
both in their subject matter and in the skill of
their treatment. I suggested earlier that the
magazine had not failed the test of "good
taste" but I did not mean to imply a
blue-stocking aspect, as witness these stories.
Louie Nussbaum's graphic account of a
rape is neither sentimental nor tough-guy, but
rather a deeply rendered experience that the
reader can share in a way he could never share
a purely factual account. The story is at its
best when the writer deals directly with the
girl. The opening pages, describing the rapist's
conversation, seemed to me a little long and
non-functional in terms of developing the
feeling of the story. But that is no doubt a
quibble.
I laughed out loud half a dozen times while
reading Steve Babson's story of a young man's
fantasies of greatness as a writer and sexual
athleticism. My laughter was tinged with
anxiety: Babson's best wit is spent on two
creative writing instructors and I kept waiting
for the guillotine to fall on my neck. "Kept
waiting" implies that it never did. Did it? Did
it?
Criticism. Too little student poetry. This is
after all a student magazine and there must be
some poets. I like having non-student work
but there ought to be more student stuff
around among all the people writing poetry.
No articles or essays or book reviews or
comments. Mostly, though, the price: one
dollar. I am not privy to the financial
arrangements of "Sequoia" but I assume that
there are subsidies from ASSU and the
Creative Writing Center and these subsidies are
more or less fixed regardless of the number of
issues.
Better two issues at fifty cents an issue
than four issues at a dollar. The magazine
ought to be within the reach of practically
every Stanford student, which fifty cents just
about is. This is a good publication that ought
to make the University proud, but it ought
not to be priced to compete with major
magazines.

Creative Writing in the Stanford University

The first thing I want to say about the new

editorial taste and one or two have lacked
"good taste" in that they sacrificed discretion
and reserve to shock and vulgarity.
The editing of this issue suffers none of
these ailments. In my lexicon of criticism this
is not damning with faint praise. While
individual artists ought to set tasks beyond
their present means, ought to strive for higher
ground, a board of editors ought to strive
after balance, measure, the graspable. A
publication should be a showcase for the
artists rather than putting itself forth as the
thing to be admired. Judged by this standard,
this "Sequoia" succeeds admirably.
The editorial hand is modest,
unpretentious, open, and has created a fine
opportunity for the artists. ISven the strong,
distinct woodcuts and drawings of Mark
Rathbun are, with the exception of the
illustration of Stillman's poems, in the service
of the literary work. Except for that one
illustration, Rathbun does not compete or
attempt to dominate, he does not say, "Look,
Ma, I'm drawing." So too with the format, the
type, the placement of the pieces, all are in
the service of the poems and stories. Nothing
is cute.
In commenting on the poetry, I feel
slightly out of my depth. Over the last two
years or so I have occasionally thought that
maybe I was the only person at Stanford not
writing poetry.

The centerpiece of the poems, and of the
magazine, is the group by Diane Middlebrook.
These are the first poems of Prof.
Middlebrook that I have read and I thought
they were fine: humane, poignant, intimate
and sophisticated in meaning and graceful and
surprising in the way they took shape. You
don't just read these poems, you really
experience them.
Michael B. Stillman's five Improvisations
on Shakespearean Themes requires a more
cerebral attention as well as a closer physical
look. The way the poet has set the lines down
sculpts the page, forces the eye to stretch as it
causes the mind to pause. Being stodgy, I
usually resist this kind of thing, and I admit
that it took several readings before I could see
that there was a gain in the method, that
something actually happens in the reader's
understanding as a result of the sculpting.
Stillman has a sure hand with his method and
his complex themes.
One of the problems of "Sequoia" in the
past was nepotism, with the editorial board
and friends dominating the printed pages.
There are two editors represented in this issue.
Dana Gioia, the head editor, has a translation,
or adaptation, from Rilke but it seems fully
justified: it is an invitation to the reader to
use "eyes which have forgotten how to see"
and is one of the best poems from the
younger writers. The other staff member,
Christine Cozzens, has two poems on
interesting themes, Virginia Woolf's suicide
and Andrew Wyeth's most famous painting.
Both poems are slight but strike the
imagination.
Looking through the list of contributors, I
noticed that these two are the only "presently
matriculated" students, and that seems to me
bad, a real weakness of the issue. Two
ex-students, David Scranton and John Weeks,
are represented, the former with a poem that
depends on the reader's willingness to
visualize color for himself, and the latter two
poems that are airy and pleasant.
Finally, two persons whose connection
with the University is unclear: Vicky Kouba
with a poem to Winter and Karen Bunting
with two good, tough, ironic poems. I have
long since run out of appropriate adjectives

and so suggest you read these poems yourself.
The short stories strike me as very strong,
both in their subject matter and in the skill of
their treatment. I suggested earlier that the
magazine had not failed the test of "good
taste" but I did not mean to imply a
blue-stocking aspect, as witness these stories.
Louie Nussbaum's graphic account of a
rape is neither sentimental nor tough-guy, but
rather a deeply rendered experience that the
reader can share in a way he could never share
a purely factual account. The story is at its
best when the writer deals directly with the
girl. The opening pages, describing the rapist's
conversation, seemed to me a little long and
non-functional in terms of developing the
feeling of the story. But that is no doubt a
quibble.
I laughed out loud half a dozen times while
reading Steve Babson's story of a young man's
fantasies of greatness as a writer and sexual
athleticism. My laughter was tinged with
anxiety: Babson's best wit is spent on two
creative writing instructors and I kept waiting
for the guillotine to fall on my neck. "Kept
waiting" implies that it never did. Did it? Did
it?
Criticism. Too little student poetry. This is
after all a student magazine and there must be
some poets. I like having non-student work
but there ought to be more student stuff
around among all the people writing poetry.
No articles or essays or book reviews or
comments. Mostly, though, the price: one
dollar. I am not privy to the financial
arrangements of "Sequoia" but I assume that
there are subsidies from ASSU and the
Creative Writing Center and these subsidies are
more or less fixed regardless of the number of
issues.
Better two issues at fifty cents an issue
than four issues at a dollar. The magazine
ought to be within the reach of practically
every Stanford student, which fifty cents just
about is. This is a good publication that ought
to make the University proud, but it ought
not to be priced to compete with major
magazines.
(Nancy Packer is an Assistant Professor of
Creative Writing in the Stanford University
English Department.)
The first thing I want to say about the new
"Sequoia" is that I like it. The intentions of
the magazine are literary but unpretentious
and they are accomplished. The editorial taste
is consistent and pleasing. The quality of the
individual work is high, some of it
outstanding.
Some student-managed publications, in the
past occasionally including "Sequoia," suffer
from an excess of ambition uninformed by
irony or practicality. A few come on as
editorial ego trips. Many have seemed intent
on breaking new trails, but over terrain that
was at once well-worn and impenetrable and
with tools that were, to say the least,
untempered. (Getting entangled in a metaphor
like that ought to have some pedagogic value.)
