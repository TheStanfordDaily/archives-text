# West, Bruce And Laing: Limited By Ego Trips
## 
### MARK WILSON 
West, Bruce and Laing played
Winterland Thanksgiving eve to an
audience exuding avid
appreciation for the group's
improvised hard rock. Consciously
playing the game of supergroup,
the three musicians fulfilled their
fans' wildest dreams. But the
frantic music was limited to their
own self-preoccupations. What
sauntered and strutted across
stage were the ego trips of West
and Bruce.
Leslie West waddled in his
shoes, emitting a miasma of
background chords and simple
riffs, distinctive only for their
sloppiness. Jack Bruce burned up
and down his bass, improvising
with mad genius. And despite his
role as non-entity, Corky Laing
filled out effectively on drums.
The group performed five
numbers from their LP "Why
Dontcha." The title track showed
the group at its best. West's wall
of sound technique worked well
with Bruce's dancing, knifing bass
lines to create real excitement.
Bruce turned out his best
performance as "Pleasure" and
the Eddie Boyd number "Third
Degree." On "Pleasure," Bruce,
with distorted face, agitated his
pelvis as he enacted a frenzied
masturbation and urination
fantasy. Bruce pretends to beat
off this tune for woman's sake:
"You say you got yourself a local
man, but does he give you
PLEASURE?" On 'Third
Degree," Bruce played cry baby
with a self-righteous intensity all
his own.
Just A Hunk
Leslie West was just a hunk of
Leslie West. He has regained all
those hard-lost pounds: once
again his guitar was at arms'
length cantilevered under mounds
of fat. West was a worse guitarist

than when he was with Mountain
or when 1 saw him at Winterland
nine months ago.
It was a pleasure to see West
happier and more self-assured. He
came out beaming in a
cream-whtie suit and strapping an
outrageous flying-V Gibson axe.
Laughing hysterically, he praised
Bill Graham and did tribute to
San Francisco in "Mississippi
Queen."
However, West's distorted leers
and recurring guitar shrieks
became a trifle boring, and dare I
admit it, disturbing. It all would
have been okay if he hadn't
missed so many notes in the
process of playing nothing.
But to get back to the
superstar. Jack Bruce was truly
amazing. Nine months ago he was
feeling his way back into live rock
and played somewhat in the style
of Spoonful on the Wheels of Fire
album. Wednesday night he
exhibited just how far he has
developed since then.

Working within and around the
chord progressions, Bruce skipped
all over the fretboard to produce
sounds of varigated intensity and
dazzling precision. Bruce has
elevated his riffing to a level of
continuous tour de force.
West, Bruce and Laing are a
mind-fucking draining experience.
They would be all the more
effective if they would
concentrate on the dynamics of
their sound. Starting loud, they
stay loud, and use little stylistic
variation. The result is
aesthetically deadening.
Furthermore, West, Bruce and
Laing seem unwilling to do much
more than slap their material
together. New material from
"Why Dontcha" was more than
matched by shady versions of
ancient tunes like "Mississippi
Queen," "Don't Look Around,"
"Sunshine of Your Love" and
"Politician."
If West and Bruce could only
get their minds off themselves for
a moment. .. .
