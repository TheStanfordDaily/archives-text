# Three Sophs Will Start
## Young Cagers Challenge USF 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
Stanford won't have a senior on the court
when the Cards tip-off-their 1972-73
basketball campaign in an 8 p.m. game tonight
at USF.
Coach Howie Dallmar plans to start three
sophomores and two juniors against an
experienced USF squad which is favored to
repeat as West Coast Athletic Conference
champions. But the Cards, with more height
and depth than any other team in Stanford
history, may have the strength to pull an
upset.
Tonight's youthful lineup includes
sophomore Rich Kelley (7-0), junior Mike
Mann (6-9), junior Dave Frost (6-6),
sophomore Mel Arterberry (6-4), and
sophomore Mark Gilberg (6-0). Kelley and
Mann will play the post positions in
Stanford's new double post offense, Frost and
Arterberry will play the wing spots, and
playmaker Gilberg will occupy the point
position.
USF will counter with practically the same
lineup that recorded a 20-8 mark last year,
including a 13-1 long in WCAC play.
Returning starters Byron (Snake) Jones (6-9),
Kevin Restani (6-10), Phil Smith (6-4), and
Mike Quick (6-3) will be joined by 6-9
sophomore center Eric Fernsten, who USF
coach Bob Gaillard called "a shot rejector."
Fernsten's defensive abilities and the

team's overall quickness make the current
USF squad reminiscent of the Bill
Russellâ€”K.C. Jones teams that won 60
straight games for USF in the 1950'5. The
1972-73 Dons are included among the
nation's top 25 teams in Sports Illustrated's
annual college basketball rankings.
Smith led the Dons in scoring last year
with a 15.0 average while Restani scored at a
14.8 clip. Jones and Quick also scored in
double figures.
Dallmar is obviously concerned about
USF's strength but he expressed confidence in
his own personnel. "Some have questioned
our experience and quickness," he said. "But I
have a lot of confidence in our players."
Dallmar stressed that Stanford's lineup will
be flexible. "I expect to utilize all my
players," he said. "We will probably substitute
freely, trying to keep fresh people in the game
at all times."
Some of the non-starters who will probably
see a lot of action tonight include seniors Bob
Buell and Pat Rusco, juniors Steve Shupe and
Jim Montague, and sophomores Scott Trobbe
and Archie Dean.
Stanford's coaches had also planned to use
freshmen Tim Patterson and Ed Schweitzer
tonight but the University administration
ruled that the frosh will not be able to play at
least until the end of fall quarter.
Associate Dean of Undergraduate Studies

Doug Davis indicated that the University would
reach a decision on the eligibility of the two
frosh around Dec. 20, after first quarter
grades are in and the administration can
determine whether Patterson and Schweitzer
have made the necessary "academic and social
adjustments."
Patterson (6-11) and Schweitzer (6-9) have
been impressive in practice and both figure
prominently in Dallmar's plans. Both have
performed well academically but despite a
special request by Dallmar, the administration
refused to change an existing Stanford policy
which prohibits freshmen from competing in
varsity football or basketball during their first
quarter at Stanford.
The two frosh will play for the Cards'
frosh-JV team tonight in a 6 p.m. preliminary
game against the Dons' frosh-JV.
Tonight's varsity contest will mark the first
time that a seven footer has played basketball
for Stanford. Sophomore center Rich Kelley,
who averaged -18.1 points and 16.7 rebounds
for last year's 16-3 frosh team, will be severely
tested by USF's tough front line. Kelley has
been bothered by a slight case of bursitis in
his right knee but he expects to be 100% by
game time.
Otherwise, Stanford is healthy. "We have
been fortunate up to this point with the
injury situation," said Dallmar, "and I just
hope the good luck continues."
