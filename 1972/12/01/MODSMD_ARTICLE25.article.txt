# Cards Look For Winning Season
## 
### STAN WILSON 
Stanford invades Honolulu, Hawaii tomorrow, with a winning
season on the line for the Cards.
Stanford, 5-5 this season, will send the nation's number-four
passer senior quarterback Mike Boryla, against the Rainbows, who are
8-2 for the year. Boryla's chances of catching the nation's passing
leader, Don Strock of Virginig Tech, are less than slim. Boryla has
completed 166 of 320 passes for 2,055 yards, but is 66 completions
off the top mark.
Hawaii's 8-2 record is deceptive, and the Cards should be rated as
favorites over the 'Bows. Hawaii has beaten Portland State, Cal
Lutheran, Puget Sound, Fullerton State, Montana, Northern Arizona,
Linfield, and San Jose State. But none of these teams are rated as
powerhouses in anyone's book.
The 'Bows' two losses have come at the hands of Tennessee (34-2)
and Grambling (46-7), both capable football teams.
But Hawaii has played eight of their ten contests this year on their
own turf, winning all but one, while the Cards have compiled a
disappointing 1-4 record on the road. The Stanford team has been in
Honolulu since late Wednesday night, and a few days under the
Hawaiian sun could prove to be fatal for the Cards.
Tailback Albert Holmes, from San Antonio, Texas, is Hawaii's
leading rusher, having gained over 900 yards this season, with an
average of 5.8 yards per carry.
The 'Bows feature a balanced attack, rolling up 1910 yards on the
ground, and gaining 1419 yards through the air. Quarterback Elroy
Chong has taken over the quarterback duties, and has connected on
30 of 80 pass attempts for 481 yards and seven touchdowns. Chong
underwent acupuncture treatment a few weeks ago, and has come
back stronger than ever the past few games.
The Cards should have everyone healthy for the game.
