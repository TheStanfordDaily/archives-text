# Tall Frosh Team Opens '72 Season
## 
### MARK WHITE 
Stanford's tallest freshman
basketball squad in recent history
opens its season against a strong
University of San Francisco team
today in San Francisco's gym
at 6:00, two hours prior to the
Cardinal varsity game.
Of the 13 freshman and four
sophomores first year coach Bill
Jones leads against USF, six are
6'5" or taller. "As of now, our
strength lies in our overall
heighth" said coach Jones, "and
we plan to utilize it in our
offensive strategy."
The Cardinals will sport a
double-post. Three out-two in
offense using a point man. The
alignment is a variation on the
standard two guard-center-two
forward formation. Two post men
are stationed inside, near the three
second area, while two wingmen
are stationed further to the
outside and wide. At the top of
the key is the point man, usually
the best ball handler on the team.
The wings correspond to
swingmen in the standard setup
while the point man is comparable
to a guard.
"With this alignment we expect
to set a lot of picks and screens.
We'll look to go inside quite a bit,
but we'll be flexible enough to
attack the weaknesses of our
opponents," said Jones.
Tim Patterson, the 6'11"
younger brother of former UCLA
star Steve Patterson, and 6'BV2"
forward-center Ed Schweitzer are
the post men that head the list of
freshmen. Both men were MVP's
of their respective prep leagues,
Patterson making AAA all-CIF
first team center, and Schweitzer
was an AAA all-CIF second team
forward selection. Schweitzer
connected on 68% of his shots in
high school, but is better known
as an excellent rebounder.
Patterson owns a fine touch on
shots within 20 feet and has good
moves to the basket.
Freshman Rich Wohlstadter

(6-4) from Los Angeles will start
at one wing position along with
sophomore Kevin Enright. Enright
played on the 1971-72 frosh team
that posted a 16-3 record.
Another teammate of his from
last year, sophomore Steve
Kristovieh, will start at the point
man position Friday.
Mike Kehrli, a 6-6 post man
and 6-1 point man Bill Whiting
should be the first men off the
bench. The amount of play the
reserves will get depends on the
performances of the regulars —
and on the fates of Patterson and
Schweitzer.
There is some indication the
latter two will play on the varsity
team if the administration feels
they can handle the academic
pressures. It appears both have the
ability to play for the varsity.
Another pair of good freshmen
may or may not play for USE this
Friday. Hefty, quick 6'9" Howard
Smith and 6'6" Richard Johnson
from City champion Jefferson
High in Los Angeles are in the
same position as Patterson and
Schweitzer, as both players appear
capable of playing for the USF
varsity. If the two from L.A. do
play for the USF frosh December
1, the game should develop into a
classic battle of big men.
Of the 21 games the frosh will
play this season, 11 will be at
home. All but three of the home
games will precede a varsity
contest which will follow at 8:00.
Most of the frosh games will start
at 6:00 p.m.

ONE TO GO — Stanford closes out its 1972 football campaign
tomorrow when the Cards travel to Honolulu to challenge Hawaii.
Quarterback Mike Boryla leads the Pac-Eight Conference in passing,
and is fourth in the nation in that category.
