## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - William P.
Rogers will continue as Secretary of
State in President Nixon's second
administration but his top-level staff
will be filled with new faces, the White
House announced yesterday.
Ronald L. Ziegler, the President's
press secretary, told reporters that
Nixon will retain the 59-year-old
Rogers in the interest of continuity in
foreign policy.
Pressed on the decision to keep
Rogers, Ziegler said, "Secretary Rogers
is a good friend of the President. Their
relationship is pretty well in place."
Henry A. Kissinger has been a
dominant policymaker in foreign
affairs and adviser to Nixon at the
White House, particularly in the
Vietnam peace talks. Rogers has
played a strong role in trying to reach
a settlement in the Middle East and a

mutual reduction of military forces in
Europe.
Ziegler announced that Kenneth
Rush, now deputy secretary of
Defense, will be nominated to succeed
John N. Irwin II to be deputy
secretary of State, the No. 2 man at
the State Department.
William J. Casey, chairman of the
Securities and Exchange Commission,
will be nominated as undersecretary
for economic affairs.
William P. Clements Jr., 55, a
multimillion dollar Texas oilman, has
been picked to be deputy secretary of
Defense, Pentagon sources said.
Clements is a close friend of Sen. John
Tower, R-Tex., and was co-chairman
of the Texas committee for the
re-election of the President.
Ziegler said that William J. Porter, a
negotiator at the Paris peace talks, will

be undersecretary of State for political
affairs, succeeding the veteran U.
Alexis Johnson, who was offered a
"major new assignment" in the
international field.
Sources said that Johnson, who is
due to retire in about a year, may have
been offered the job of ambassador to
South Vietnam.
Ziegler said Nixon has known Rush
since his student days at law school.
Rush is a former U.S. ambassador to
West Germany before he was named
deputy Defense secretary on Feb. 7,
1972. He is 63.
Ziegler also announced that Curtis
J. Tarr would remain as undersecretary
of State for coordinating security
assistance affairs.
Ziegler indicated that Nixon would
make further announcements on his
Cabinet in the second term while he is
at the Florida White House.
