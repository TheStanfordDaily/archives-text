## How Important Is Emotion? The 						Stanford Daily SPORTS 
### Mike Chasson 
As Stanford heads for Hawaii
for its season finale it is easy to
look back at a season that could
have been. The Cards seemed so
close to a great season yet they
are 5-5 going off to the Islands.
Only against Washington State
did the Cards appear completely
outclassed. In each of their other
four defeats they had a chance to
win it, but they just couldn't put
it together.
Everyone has their own theory
as to why Stanford failed to do
better this season. Many people
point to the offensive line for
being inconsistant, or the lack of a
running attack, or the defense's
inability to stop the run.
Explanation
One possible explanation
revolves around whether the

Cardinals were "emotionally
ready" or "up" for their
opponents. After each defeat
Coach Jack Christiansen would be
asked if Stanford had been
mentally ready to play winning
football. He could only respond
with something such as "I thought
we were ready," or "we should
have been up."
The question seemed fair for at
no time this season did Stanford
seem emotional about the game or
excited about their opponent. On
the other hand, each team they
played was excited about the
game, as they wanted to beat
Stanford.
Christiansen stated time and
time again during the season that
the players would have to get

themselves mentally ready for
each game. He told the players
that it was their team and that he
would leave it up to each
individual to get himself "psyched
up."
Players Happy
Many players stated on
numerous occasions this season
they were more than happy with
this arrangement. In fact, this is
one of the reasons many of the
players respect Christiansen, and
prefer him to former coach John
Ralston. His approach to the game
is low key and seemingly
unemotional.
The question is whether this is
the way to prepare to play
winning football. Under Ralston
there was much more of a
"rah-rah" atmosphere. Ralston

would attempt to get the team
excited about the big games and
they would usually win. The
problem is that it is impossible to
stay that "high" for every game
and accordingly Stanford lost
some games in which they were
heavily favored.
Football is an emotional game
to which the team that is more
"psyched up" will win most of
the time. Stanford proved this
many times while Ralston was
coach as they defeated Ohio
State, Michigan, and USC in
games they were expected to lose.
The problem that exists when a
player is expected to prepare
himself mentally for a particular
game is that he doesn't really
know how mentally prepared he

actually is. Following the defeats
this year Stanford players would
be asked if they thought the team
had been "ready" for the game.
Even in the USC game which
the team knew would mean the
Rose Bowl the players seemed
unemotional when one has
watched the Cardinals' two Rose
Bowl wins and the victories over
the Trojans the last two seasons.
I wonder whether this lack of
emotion was the result of
Christiansen's philosophy or the
fact they had already won two
Rose Bowls, or just that after the
USC game they couldn't get
excited about the rest of the
season.
It is much too early to say
which is better, the Ralston
method or the Christiansen

method. Ralston had a great deal
of success, but did his type of
"rah-rah" approach to football fit
in at Stanford is an important
question.
Christiansen's approach seems
to fit the campus as a whole's
attitude towards football better,
but its success will depend on the
players' ability to get themselves
emotionally ready as Christiansen
says they should be able to do.
A true test for the players
ability to get themselves psyched
for a game will be in Hawaii. The
vacation atmosphere of the
Islands coupled with the fact
Hawaii is not a football power will
work against the Cardinals playing
emotional football.
We can only wait and see.

We can only wait and see.
As Stanford heads for Hawaii
for its season finale it is easy to
look back at a season that could
have been. The Cards seemed so
close to a great season yet they
are 5-5 going off to the Islands.
Only against Washington State
did the Cards appear completely
outclassed. In each of their other
four defeats they had a chance to
win it, but they just couldn't put
it together.
Everyone has their own theory
as to why Stanford failed to do
better this season. Many people
point to the offensive line for
being inconsistant, or the lack of a
running attack, or the defense's
inability to stop the run.
Explanation
One possible explanation
revolves around whether the

Cardinals were "emotionally
ready" or "up" for their
opponents. After each defeat
Coach Jack Christiansen would be
asked if Stanford had been
mentally ready to play winning
football. He could only respond
with something such as "I thought
we were ready," or "we should
have been up."
The question seemed fair for at
no time this season did Stanford
seem emotional about the game or
excited about their opponent. On
the other hand, each team they
played was excited about the
game, as they wanted to beat
Stanford.
Christiansen stated time and
time again during the season that
the players would have to get

themselves mentally ready for
each game. He told the players
that it was their team and that he
would leave it up to each
individual to get himself "psyched
up."
Players Happy
Many players stated on
numerous occasions this season
they were more than happy with
this arrangement. In fact, this is
one of the reasons many of the
players respect Christiansen, and
prefer him to former coach John
Ralston. His approach to the game
is low key and seemingly
unemotional.
The question is whether this is
the way to prepare to play
winning football. Under Ralston
there was much more of a
"rah-rah" atmosphere. Ralston

would attempt to get the team
excited about the big games and
they would usually win. The
problem is that it is impossible to
stay that "high" for every game
and accordingly Stanford lost
some games in which they were
heavily favored.
Football is an emotional game
to which the team that is more
"psyched up" will win most of
the time. Stanford proved this
many times while Ralston was
coach as they defeated Ohio
State, Michigan, and USC in
games they were expected to lose.
The problem that exists when a
player is expected to prepare
himself mentally for a particular
game is that he doesn't really
know how mentally prepared he

actually is. Following the defeats
this year Stanford players would
be asked if they thought the team
had been "ready" for the game.
Even in the USC game which
the team knew would mean the
Rose Bowl the players seemed
unemotional when one has
watched the Cardinals' two Rose
Bowl wins and the victories over
the Trojans the last two seasons.
I wonder whether this lack of
emotion was the result of
Christiansen's philosophy or the
fact they had already won two
Rose Bowls, or just that after the
USC game they couldn't get
excited about the rest of the
season.
It is much too early to say
which is better, the Ralston
method or the Christiansen

method. Ralston had a great deal
of success, but did his type of
"rah-rah" approach to football fit
in at Stanford is an important
question.
Christiansen's approach seems
to fit the campus as a whole's
attitude towards football better,
but its success will depend on the
players' ability to get themselves
emotionally ready as Christiansen
says they should be able to do.
