Nixon, Saigon Envoy Meet
WASHINGTON — President Nixon held an
unexpected second meeting with South Vietnamese
special envoy Nguyen Phu Due as signs increased
that a climax is near on setting a final allied position
on peace negotiations.
The meeting was held shortly after the Pentagon
said the White House would make no more formal
announcements on withdrawal of U.S. troops from
South Vietnam.
Due was ushered into the President's office one
hour after his scheduled 11:30 a.m. appointment.
The South Vietnamese official left 35 minutes later.
Shortly afterward, Nixon left for a long weekend in
Florida.
White House spokesman Gerald Warren said
yesterday's meeting with Due, who is South
Vietnamese President Nguyen Van Thieu's special
representative, was "to review the entire situation in
Vietnam."
Meantime, the Pentagon said that no more
formal announcements will be made by the White
House on withdrawal of U.S. troops from South
Vietnam.
The White House added that the 27,000 troop
ceiling set for Dec. 1 has been reached and
acknowledged that it would not make the type of
announcements it has in the past concerning future
pullouts.
The Pentagon added, however, that the
Vietnamization program would continue, indicating
some American forces will continue to come out,
although in necessarily small numbers.
The Defense Department added that the end of
formal announcements would give the United States
added flexibility in negotiating with North Vietnam.
These negotiations resume Monday in Paris with
Kissinger's return to the French capital where North
Vietnamese negotiator Le Due Tho has been waiting
since last Saturday.
Burger Blocks 'Pure Air' Order
WASHINGTON - Supreme Court Chief Justice
Warren E. Burger temporarily blocked yesterday a
lower court order protecting pure air from
pollution, only hours before the order would have
required nationwide issuance of federal regulations.
The Environmental Protection Agency, through a
Solicitor General Irwin N. Griswold, had requested
the stay Wednesday to allow time for an appeal of
the lower court's decision.
Burger granted a stay only until the full Supreme
Court, which meets today, can consider whether a
longer stay is warranted.
Without Burger's action, EPA administrator
William D. Ruckelshaus would have been required
to issue by midnight regulations imposingaclean-air
"non-degradation standard" throughout the nation.
Such a rule would bar any substantial pollution
of air which is still pure, a standard which, Griswold
argued, would impose "a virtually complete freeze"
on further economic development in clear-air
regions.
Irish Leader Gives Ultimatum
DUBLIN — Prime Minister Jack Lynch's
government yesterday flung an ultimatum at its
divided opposition: vote for tougher action against
the rocket-wielding Irish Republican Army or face
the people in national elections.
The gauntlet was thrown down in the Dail — or
parliament — by Lynch's labor minister, Joseph

Brennan, during the second day of debate on a
government bill to give police greater power to put
the men of the IRA behind bars. A critical vote on
the bill, first scheduled for last night, was now
expected today or perhaps next week.
Apparently in step with Lynch's stiffening
resolve to break the power of the IRA, officials in
Northern Ireland disclosed that Britain had rejected
peace overtures from the IRA's extremist
Provisional wing.
San Jose Robbers Seized
SAN JOSE — A police chase for two bank robbers,
two women hostages and $116,000 holdup money
ended when the getaway vehicle was surrounded
and a police sergeant shot one man as he held a gun
to a kidnap victim's head yesterday, police said.
The two women were rescued unharmed, and
bank officials said they believe all the money was
recovered. One holdup man was critically wounded.
Larry Hoge, spokesman for Wells Fargo Bank,
said two men wearing masks entered the bank's
Alum Rock branch, fired a shot in the air, said
"This is a holdup," then cleaned out all the teller
stations and the vault.
A silent alarm tripped shortly before noon
brought police who surrounded the bank while the
robbery was in progress, he said.
The gunmen used the women employees as
shields, then took a customer's car for their
getaway, followed by a helicopter and 30 vehicles
representing the city police, the Santa Clara County
sheriff's office, the FBI and the California Highway
Patrol.
Chief of Detectives Bart Collins said that during
the chase, the holdup men, with one of the women
at the wheel, stopped at a service station where they
demanded gasoline. Tow truck operator Tom Gue
said "all the attendants dove for cover" as the car
suddenly sped away. He said a shot was fired, but
no one was hit.
The chase finally ended, after almost one hour,
when the car attempted a U-turn on Highway 101
just south of here, rammed into a mud bank then
became mired, Collins said.
Blaze Smokes Downtown SF
SAN FRANCISCO — A five-alarm fire that sent
black clouds of smoke boiling over downtown San
Francisco and the bay was brought under control
yesterday after burning at least three piers on the
Embarcadero.
One fireman was reported hurt in the collapse of
a wall, the fire department said, adding "it is
possible" that some persons might have been
trapped on Pier 18 where transients sometimes
camp.
The smoke was so thick it stalled traffic on the
nearby Oakland-San Francisco Bay Bridge and the
adjacent freeway carrying north-south traffic from
the Peninsula.
Early reports said an explosion might have
started the fire because it spread so fast.
Burning creosoted pierside roofs and pier pilings
sent such acrid fumes into the area that many of the
thousands of spectators were driven away. Fire
fighters wore gas masks.
Flames struck among piers 18, 20 and 22 starting
at about 1 p.m.
Press Council Planned
NEW YORK — Plans for the establishment of a
press council to monitor the fairness and accuracy

of the national news media — both electronic and
print — were announced yesterday by a Twentieth
Century Fund Task Force.
The council is expected to begin operations early
next year, said M.J. Rossant, director of the fund, a
nonprofit research organization.
The task force report said the purpose of the
group, to be composed of 15 members from
journalism and the public sector, is "to receive, to
examine and to report on complaints concerning the
accuracy and fairness of news reporting in the
United States, as well as to initiate studies and
report on issues involving the freedom of the press."
Discrimination Charges Supported
WASHINGTON — A biracial Pentagon task force
yesterday supported charges by blacks of
discrimination in the administration of military
justice and recommended changes to standardize
punishment for minor offenses and the recruitment
of more black lawyers.
The panel also recommended that the system of
selecting military jurors by commanding officers be
revised to eliminate possible command influence in
trials.
These recommendations, among more than 100
proposed by the military-civilian panel for
dampening racial strife, were contained in a
four-volume study of how the armed forces
administer the Uniform Code of Military Justice.
In accepting the report, Secretary of Defense
Melvin R. Laird declared that "justice and discipline
are inseparable and indispensable" and said a
number of changes are in the works and others will
be put into effect in coming months.
Black servicemen have often complained of
receiving more severe punishment from commanders
for minor offenses without requiring formal trials
and of receiving disproportionate numbers of
administrative discharges. Another complaint has
been that blacks often are put under pretrial
confinement while whites charged with the same
offenses go free.
The panel said it found basis for these charges in
interviews with scores of servicemen. It concluded
this contributes "to racial animosity and tension"
which afflicts the military services.
Property Tax Vote Slated Today
SACRAMENTO — Gov. Reagan's five-year battle to
win a major property tax cut for California
homeowners faces a final showdown vote today in
the Senate — the graveyard of Reagan tax plans.
It was the last day of the 1972 session and there
was no tomorrow for the measure.
Prospects for the Reagan plan were bleak.
The compromise $1.1 billion tax relief and
school finance bill co-sponsored by Assembly
Speaker Bob Moretti was up for a final vote in the
Senate, where Reagan tax plans have met defeat
since 1968.
"I would say our prospects for passage are about
30 percent," said an aide to the Republican
governor.
The measure needs 27 votes to pass and at last
count the Reagan-Moretti forces had 26.
Today's Weather
Mostly fair thru tomorrow but with patches of night
and morning fog. Little change in temperatures.
Low tonight in the low 30s to low 40s. Highs both
days in the mid 50s tc low 60s. Light winds.

Discrimination Charges Supported
WASHINGTON — A biracial Pentagon task force
yesterday supported charges by blacks of
discrimination in the administration of military
justice and recommended changes to standardize
punishment for minor offenses and the recruitment
of more black lawyers.
The panel also recommended that the system of
selecting military jurors by commanding officers be
revised to eliminate possible command influence in
trials.
These recommendations, among more than 100
proposed by the military-civilian panel for
dampening racial strife, were contained in a
four-volume study of how the armed forces
administer the Uniform Code of Military Justice.
In accepting the report, Secretary of Defense
Melvin R. Laird declared that "justice and discipline
are inseparable and indispensable" and said a
number of changes are in the works and others will
be put into effect in coming months.
Black servicemen have often complained of
receiving more severe punishment from commanders
for minor offenses without requiring formal trials
and of receiving disproportionate numbers of
administrative discharges. Another complaint has
been that blacks often are put under pretrial
confinement while whites charged with the same
offenses go free.
The panel said it found basis for these charges in
interviews with scores of servicemen. It concluded
this contributes "to racial animosity and tension"
which afflicts the military services.
Property Tax Vote Slated Today
SACRAMENTO — Gov. Reagan's five-year battle to
win a major property tax cut for California
homeowners faces a final showdown vote today in
the Senate — the graveyard of Reagan tax plans.
It was the last day of the 1972 session and there
was no tomorrow for the measure.
Prospects for the Reagan plan were bleak.
The compromise $1.1 billion tax relief and
school finance bill co-sponsored by Assembly
Speaker Bob Moretti was up for a final vote in the
Senate, where Reagan tax plans have met defeat
since 1968.
"I would say our prospects for passage are about
30 percent," said an aide to the Republican
governor.
The measure needs 27 votes to pass and at last
count the Reagan-Moretti forces had 26.
Today's Weather
Mostly fair thru tomorrow but with patches of night
and morning fog. Little change in temperatures.
Low tonight in the low 30s to low 40s. Highs both
days in the mid 50s tc low 60s. Light winds.
Nixon, Saigon Envoy Meet
WASHINGTON — President Nixon held an
unexpected second meeting with South Vietnamese
special envoy Nguyen Phu Due as signs increased
that a climax is near on setting a final allied position
on peace negotiations.
The meeting was held shortly after the Pentagon
said the White House would make no more formal
announcements on withdrawal of U.S. troops from
South Vietnam.
Due was ushered into the President's office one
hour after his scheduled 11:30 a.m. appointment.
The South Vietnamese official left 35 minutes later.
Shortly afterward, Nixon left for a long weekend in
Florida.
White House spokesman Gerald Warren said
yesterday's meeting with Due, who is South
Vietnamese President Nguyen Van Thieu's special
representative, was "to review the entire situation in
Vietnam."
Meantime, the Pentagon said that no more
formal announcements will be made by the White
House on withdrawal of U.S. troops from South
Vietnam.
The White House added that the 27,000 troop
ceiling set for Dec. 1 has been reached and
acknowledged that it would not make the type of
announcements it has in the past concerning future
pullouts.
The Pentagon added, however, that the
Vietnamization program would continue, indicating
some American forces will continue to come out,
although in necessarily small numbers.
The Defense Department added that the end of
formal announcements would give the United States
added flexibility in negotiating with North Vietnam.
These negotiations resume Monday in Paris with
Kissinger's return to the French capital where North
Vietnamese negotiator Le Due Tho has been waiting
since last Saturday.
Burger Blocks 'Pure Air' Order
WASHINGTON - Supreme Court Chief Justice
Warren E. Burger temporarily blocked yesterday a
lower court order protecting pure air from
pollution, only hours before the order would have
required nationwide issuance of federal regulations.
The Environmental Protection Agency, through a
Solicitor General Irwin N. Griswold, had requested
the stay Wednesday to allow time for an appeal of
the lower court's decision.
Burger granted a stay only until the full Supreme
Court, which meets today, can consider whether a
longer stay is warranted.
Without Burger's action, EPA administrator
William D. Ruckelshaus would have been required
to issue by midnight regulations imposingaclean-air
"non-degradation standard" throughout the nation.
Such a rule would bar any substantial pollution
of air which is still pure, a standard which, Griswold
argued, would impose "a virtually complete freeze"
on further economic development in clear-air
regions.
Irish Leader Gives Ultimatum
DUBLIN — Prime Minister Jack Lynch's
government yesterday flung an ultimatum at its
divided opposition: vote for tougher action against
the rocket-wielding Irish Republican Army or face
the people in national elections.
The gauntlet was thrown down in the Dail — or
parliament — by Lynch's labor minister, Joseph

Brennan, during the second day of debate on a
government bill to give police greater power to put
the men of the IRA behind bars. A critical vote on
the bill, first scheduled for last night, was now
expected today or perhaps next week.
Apparently in step with Lynch's stiffening
resolve to break the power of the IRA, officials in
Northern Ireland disclosed that Britain had rejected
peace overtures from the IRA's extremist
Provisional wing.
San Jose Robbers Seized
SAN JOSE — A police chase for two bank robbers,
two women hostages and $116,000 holdup money
ended when the getaway vehicle was surrounded
and a police sergeant shot one man as he held a gun
to a kidnap victim's head yesterday, police said.
The two women were rescued unharmed, and
bank officials said they believe all the money was
recovered. One holdup man was critically wounded.
Larry Hoge, spokesman for Wells Fargo Bank,
said two men wearing masks entered the bank's
Alum Rock branch, fired a shot in the air, said
"This is a holdup," then cleaned out all the teller
stations and the vault.
A silent alarm tripped shortly before noon
brought police who surrounded the bank while the
robbery was in progress, he said.
The gunmen used the women employees as
shields, then took a customer's car for their
getaway, followed by a helicopter and 30 vehicles
representing the city police, the Santa Clara County
sheriff's office, the FBI and the California Highway
Patrol.
Chief of Detectives Bart Collins said that during
the chase, the holdup men, with one of the women
at the wheel, stopped at a service station where they
demanded gasoline. Tow truck operator Tom Gue
said "all the attendants dove for cover" as the car
suddenly sped away. He said a shot was fired, but
no one was hit.
The chase finally ended, after almost one hour,
when the car attempted a U-turn on Highway 101
just south of here, rammed into a mud bank then
became mired, Collins said.
Blaze Smokes Downtown SF
SAN FRANCISCO — A five-alarm fire that sent
black clouds of smoke boiling over downtown San
Francisco and the bay was brought under control
yesterday after burning at least three piers on the
Embarcadero.
One fireman was reported hurt in the collapse of
a wall, the fire department said, adding "it is
possible" that some persons might have been
trapped on Pier 18 where transients sometimes
camp.
The smoke was so thick it stalled traffic on the
nearby Oakland-San Francisco Bay Bridge and the
adjacent freeway carrying north-south traffic from
the Peninsula.
Early reports said an explosion might have
started the fire because it spread so fast.
Burning creosoted pierside roofs and pier pilings
sent such acrid fumes into the area that many of the
thousands of spectators were driven away. Fire
fighters wore gas masks.
Flames struck among piers 18, 20 and 22 starting
at about 1 p.m.
Press Council Planned
NEW YORK — Plans for the establishment of a
press council to monitor the fairness and accuracy

of the national news media — both electronic and
print — were announced yesterday by a Twentieth
Century Fund Task Force.
The council is expected to begin operations early
next year, said M.J. Rossant, director of the fund, a
nonprofit research organization.
The task force report said the purpose of the
group, to be composed of 15 members from
journalism and the public sector, is "to receive, to
examine and to report on complaints concerning the
accuracy and fairness of news reporting in the
United States, as well as to initiate studies and
report on issues involving the freedom of the press."

brought police who surrounded the bank while the
robbery was in progress, he said.
The gunmen used the women employees as
shields, then took a customer's car for their
getaway, followed by a helicopter and 30 vehicles
representing the city police, the Santa Clara County
sheriff's office, the FBI and the California Highway
Patrol.
Chief of Detectives Bart Collins said that during
the chase, the holdup men, with one of the women
at the wheel, stopped at a service station where they
demanded gasoline. Tow truck operator Tom Gue
said "all the attendants dove for cover" as the car
suddenly sped away. He said a shot was fired, but
no one was hit.
The chase finally ended, after almost one hour,
when the car attempted a U-turn on Highway 101
just south of here, rammed into a mud bank then
became mired, Collins said.
Blaze Smokes Downtown SF
SAN FRANCISCO — A five-alarm fire that sent
black clouds of smoke boiling over downtown San
Francisco and the bay was brought under control
yesterday after burning at least three piers on the
Embarcadero.
One fireman was reported hurt in the collapse of
a wall, the fire department said, adding "it is
possible" that some persons might have been
trapped on Pier 18 where transients sometimes
camp.
The smoke was so thick it stalled traffic on the
nearby Oakland-San Francisco Bay Bridge and the
adjacent freeway carrying north-south traffic from
the Peninsula.
Early reports said an explosion might have
started the fire because it spread so fast.
Burning creosoted pierside roofs and pier pilings
sent such acrid fumes into the area that many of the
thousands of spectators were driven away. Fire
fighters wore gas masks.
Flames struck among piers 18, 20 and 22 starting
at about 1 p.m.
Press Council Planned
NEW YORK — Plans for the establishment of a
press council to monitor the fairness and accuracy

of the national news media — both electronic and
print — were announced yesterday by a Twentieth
Century Fund Task Force.
The council is expected to begin operations early
next year, said M.J. Rossant, director of the fund, a
nonprofit research organization.
The task force report said the purpose of the
group, to be composed of 15 members from
journalism and the public sector, is "to receive, to
examine and to report on complaints concerning the
accuracy and fairness of news reporting in the
United States, as well as to initiate studies and
report on issues involving the freedom of the press."
Discrimination Charges Supported
WASHINGTON — A biracial Pentagon task force
yesterday supported charges by blacks of
discrimination in the administration of military
justice and recommended changes to standardize
punishment for minor offenses and the recruitment
of more black lawyers.
The panel also recommended that the system of
selecting military jurors by commanding officers be
revised to eliminate possible command influence in
trials.
These recommendations, among more than 100
proposed by the military-civilian panel for
dampening racial strife, were contained in a
four-volume study of how the armed forces
administer the Uniform Code of Military Justice.
In accepting the report, Secretary of Defense
Melvin R. Laird declared that "justice and discipline
are inseparable and indispensable" and said a
number of changes are in the works and others will
be put into effect in coming months.
Black servicemen have often complained of
receiving more severe punishment from commanders
for minor offenses without requiring formal trials
and of receiving disproportionate numbers of
administrative discharges. Another complaint has
been that blacks often are put under pretrial
confinement while whites charged with the same
offenses go free.
The panel said it found basis for these charges in
interviews with scores of servicemen. It concluded
this contributes "to racial animosity and tension"
which afflicts the military services.
Property Tax Vote Slated Today
SACRAMENTO — Gov. Reagan's five-year battle to
win a major property tax cut for California
homeowners faces a final showdown vote today in
the Senate — the graveyard of Reagan tax plans.
It was the last day of the 1972 session and there
was no tomorrow for the measure.
Prospects for the Reagan plan were bleak.
The compromise $1.1 billion tax relief and
school finance bill co-sponsored by Assembly
Speaker Bob Moretti was up for a final vote in the
Senate, where Reagan tax plans have met defeat
since 1968.
"I would say our prospects for passage are about
30 percent," said an aide to the Republican
governor.
The measure needs 27 votes to pass and at last
count the Reagan-Moretti forces had 26.
Today's Weather
Mostly fair thru tomorrow but with patches of night
and morning fog. Little change in temperatures.
Low tonight in the low 30s to low 40s. Highs both
days in the mid 50s tc low 60s. Light winds.
Nixon, Saigon Envoy Meet
WASHINGTON — President Nixon held an
unexpected second meeting with South Vietnamese
special envoy Nguyen Phu Due as signs increased
that a climax is near on setting a final allied position
on peace negotiations.
The meeting was held shortly after the Pentagon
said the White House would make no more formal
announcements on withdrawal of U.S. troops from
South Vietnam.
Due was ushered into the President's office one
hour after his scheduled 11:30 a.m. appointment.
The South Vietnamese official left 35 minutes later.
Shortly afterward, Nixon left for a long weekend in
Florida.
White House spokesman Gerald Warren said
yesterday's meeting with Due, who is South
Vietnamese President Nguyen Van Thieu's special
representative, was "to review the entire situation in
Vietnam."
Meantime, the Pentagon said that no more
formal announcements will be made by the White
House on withdrawal of U.S. troops from South
Vietnam.
The White House added that the 27,000 troop
ceiling set for Dec. 1 has been reached and
acknowledged that it would not make the type of
announcements it has in the past concerning future
pullouts.
The Pentagon added, however, that the
Vietnamization program would continue, indicating
some American forces will continue to come out,
although in necessarily small numbers.
The Defense Department added that the end of
formal announcements would give the United States
added flexibility in negotiating with North Vietnam.
These negotiations resume Monday in Paris with
Kissinger's return to the French capital where North
Vietnamese negotiator Le Due Tho has been waiting
since last Saturday.
Burger Blocks 'Pure Air' Order
WASHINGTON - Supreme Court Chief Justice
Warren E. Burger temporarily blocked yesterday a
lower court order protecting pure air from
pollution, only hours before the order would have
required nationwide issuance of federal regulations.
The Environmental Protection Agency, through a
Solicitor General Irwin N. Griswold, had requested
the stay Wednesday to allow time for an appeal of
the lower court's decision.
Burger granted a stay only until the full Supreme
Court, which meets today, can consider whether a
longer stay is warranted.
Without Burger's action, EPA administrator
William D. Ruckelshaus would have been required
to issue by midnight regulations imposingaclean-air
"non-degradation standard" throughout the nation.
Such a rule would bar any substantial pollution
of air which is still pure, a standard which, Griswold
argued, would impose "a virtually complete freeze"
on further economic development in clear-air
regions.
Irish Leader Gives Ultimatum
DUBLIN — Prime Minister Jack Lynch's
government yesterday flung an ultimatum at its
divided opposition: vote for tougher action against
the rocket-wielding Irish Republican Army or face
the people in national elections.
The gauntlet was thrown down in the Dail — or
parliament — by Lynch's labor minister, Joseph

Brennan, during the second day of debate on a
government bill to give police greater power to put
the men of the IRA behind bars. A critical vote on
the bill, first scheduled for last night, was now
expected today or perhaps next week.
Apparently in step with Lynch's stiffening
resolve to break the power of the IRA, officials in
Northern Ireland disclosed that Britain had rejected
peace overtures from the IRA's extremist
Provisional wing.
San Jose Robbers Seized
SAN JOSE — A police chase for two bank robbers,
two women hostages and $116,000 holdup money
ended when the getaway vehicle was surrounded
and a police sergeant shot one man as he held a gun
to a kidnap victim's head yesterday, police said.
The two women were rescued unharmed, and
bank officials said they believe all the money was
recovered. One holdup man was critically wounded.
Larry Hoge, spokesman for Wells Fargo Bank,
said two men wearing masks entered the bank's
Alum Rock branch, fired a shot in the air, said
"This is a holdup," then cleaned out all the teller
stations and the vault.
A silent alarm tripped shortly before noon
brought police who surrounded the bank while the
robbery was in progress, he said.
The gunmen used the women employees as
shields, then took a customer's car for their
getaway, followed by a helicopter and 30 vehicles
representing the city police, the Santa Clara County
sheriff's office, the FBI and the California Highway
Patrol.
Chief of Detectives Bart Collins said that during
the chase, the holdup men, with one of the women
at the wheel, stopped at a service station where they
demanded gasoline. Tow truck operator Tom Gue
said "all the attendants dove for cover" as the car
suddenly sped away. He said a shot was fired, but
no one was hit.
The chase finally ended, after almost one hour,
when the car attempted a U-turn on Highway 101

Burger Blocks 'Pure Air' Order
WASHINGTON - Supreme Court Chief Justice
Warren E. Burger temporarily blocked yesterday a
lower court order protecting pure air from
pollution, only hours before the order would have
required nationwide issuance of federal regulations.
The Environmental Protection Agency, through a
Solicitor General Irwin N. Griswold, had requested
the stay Wednesday to allow time for an appeal of
the lower court's decision.
Burger granted a stay only until the full Supreme
Court, which meets today, can consider whether a
longer stay is warranted.
Without Burger's action, EPA administrator
William D. Ruckelshaus would have been required
to issue by midnight regulations imposingaclean-air
"non-degradation standard" throughout the nation.
Such a rule would bar any substantial pollution
of air which is still pure, a standard which, Griswold
argued, would impose "a virtually complete freeze"
on further economic development in clear-air
regions.
Irish Leader Gives Ultimatum
DUBLIN — Prime Minister Jack Lynch's
government yesterday flung an ultimatum at its
divided opposition: vote for tougher action against
the rocket-wielding Irish Republican Army or face
the people in national elections.
The gauntlet was thrown down in the Dail — or
parliament — by Lynch's labor minister, Joseph

Brennan, during the second day of debate on a
government bill to give police greater power to put
the men of the IRA behind bars. A critical vote on
the bill, first scheduled for last night, was now
expected today or perhaps next week.
Apparently in step with Lynch's stiffening
resolve to break the power of the IRA, officials in
Northern Ireland disclosed that Britain had rejected
peace overtures from the IRA's extremist
Provisional wing.
San Jose Robbers Seized
SAN JOSE — A police chase for two bank robbers,
two women hostages and $116,000 holdup money
ended when the getaway vehicle was surrounded
and a police sergeant shot one man as he held a gun
to a kidnap victim's head yesterday, police said.
The two women were rescued unharmed, and
bank officials said they believe all the money was
recovered. One holdup man was critically wounded.
Larry Hoge, spokesman for Wells Fargo Bank,
said two men wearing masks entered the bank's
Alum Rock branch, fired a shot in the air, said
"This is a holdup," then cleaned out all the teller
stations and the vault.
A silent alarm tripped shortly before noon
brought police who surrounded the bank while the
robbery was in progress, he said.
The gunmen used the women employees as
shields, then took a customer's car for their
getaway, followed by a helicopter and 30 vehicles
representing the city police, the Santa Clara County
sheriff's office, the FBI and the California Highway
Patrol.
Chief of Detectives Bart Collins said that during
the chase, the holdup men, with one of the women
at the wheel, stopped at a service station where they
demanded gasoline. Tow truck operator Tom Gue
said "all the attendants dove for cover" as the car
suddenly sped away. He said a shot was fired, but
no one was hit.
The chase finally ended, after almost one hour,
when the car attempted a U-turn on Highway 101
just south of here, rammed into a mud bank then
became mired, Collins said.
Blaze Smokes Downtown SF
SAN FRANCISCO — A five-alarm fire that sent
black clouds of smoke boiling over downtown San
Francisco and the bay was brought under control
yesterday after burning at least three piers on the
Embarcadero.
One fireman was reported hurt in the collapse of
a wall, the fire department said, adding "it is
possible" that some persons might have been
trapped on Pier 18 where transients sometimes
camp.
The smoke was so thick it stalled traffic on the
nearby Oakland-San Francisco Bay Bridge and the
adjacent freeway carrying north-south traffic from
the Peninsula.
Early reports said an explosion might have
started the fire because it spread so fast.
Burning creosoted pierside roofs and pier pilings
sent such acrid fumes into the area that many of the
thousands of spectators were driven away. Fire
fighters wore gas masks.
Flames struck among piers 18, 20 and 22 starting
at about 1 p.m.
Press Council Planned
NEW YORK — Plans for the establishment of a
press council to monitor the fairness and accuracy

of the national news media — both electronic and
print — were announced yesterday by a Twentieth
Century Fund Task Force.
The council is expected to begin operations early
next year, said M.J. Rossant, director of the fund, a
nonprofit research organization.
The task force report said the purpose of the
group, to be composed of 15 members from
journalism and the public sector, is "to receive, to
examine and to report on complaints concerning the
accuracy and fairness of news reporting in the
United States, as well as to initiate studies and
report on issues involving the freedom of the press."
Discrimination Charges Supported
WASHINGTON — A biracial Pentagon task force
yesterday supported charges by blacks of
discrimination in the administration of military
justice and recommended changes to standardize
punishment for minor offenses and the recruitment
of more black lawyers.
The panel also recommended that the system of
selecting military jurors by commanding officers be
revised to eliminate possible command influence in
trials.
These recommendations, among more than 100
proposed by the military-civilian panel for
dampening racial strife, were contained in a
four-volume study of how the armed forces
administer the Uniform Code of Military Justice.
In accepting the report, Secretary of Defense
Melvin R. Laird declared that "justice and discipline
are inseparable and indispensable" and said a
number of changes are in the works and others will
be put into effect in coming months.
Black servicemen have often complained of
receiving more severe punishment from commanders
for minor offenses without requiring formal trials
and of receiving disproportionate numbers of
administrative discharges. Another complaint has
been that blacks often are put under pretrial
confinement while whites charged with the same
offenses go free.
The panel said it found basis for these charges in
interviews with scores of servicemen. It concluded
this contributes "to racial animosity and tension"
which afflicts the military services.
Property Tax Vote Slated Today
SACRAMENTO — Gov. Reagan's five-year battle to
win a major property tax cut for California
homeowners faces a final showdown vote today in
the Senate — the graveyard of Reagan tax plans.
It was the last day of the 1972 session and there
was no tomorrow for the measure.
Prospects for the Reagan plan were bleak.
The compromise $1.1 billion tax relief and
school finance bill co-sponsored by Assembly
Speaker Bob Moretti was up for a final vote in the
Senate, where Reagan tax plans have met defeat
since 1968.
"I would say our prospects for passage are about
30 percent," said an aide to the Republican
governor.
The measure needs 27 votes to pass and at last
count the Reagan-Moretti forces had 26.
Today's Weather
Mostly fair thru tomorrow but with patches of night
and morning fog. Little change in temperatures.
Low tonight in the low 30s to low 40s. Highs both
days in the mid 50s tc low 60s. Light winds.
Nixon, Saigon Envoy Meet
WASHINGTON — President Nixon held an
unexpected second meeting with South Vietnamese
special envoy Nguyen Phu Due as signs increased
that a climax is near on setting a final allied position
on peace negotiations.
The meeting was held shortly after the Pentagon
said the White House would make no more formal
announcements on withdrawal of U.S. troops from
South Vietnam.
Due was ushered into the President's office one
hour after his scheduled 11:30 a.m. appointment.
The South Vietnamese official left 35 minutes later.
Shortly afterward, Nixon left for a long weekend in
Florida.
White House spokesman Gerald Warren said
yesterday's meeting with Due, who is South
Vietnamese President Nguyen Van Thieu's special
representative, was "to review the entire situation in
Vietnam."
Meantime, the Pentagon said that no more
formal announcements will be made by the White
House on withdrawal of U.S. troops from South
Vietnam.
The White House added that the 27,000 troop
ceiling set for Dec. 1 has been reached and
acknowledged that it would not make the type of
announcements it has in the past concerning future
pullouts.
The Pentagon added, however, that the
Vietnamization program would continue, indicating
some American forces will continue to come out,
although in necessarily small numbers.
The Defense Department added that the end of
formal announcements would give the United States
added flexibility in negotiating with North Vietnam.
These negotiations resume Monday in Paris with
Kissinger's return to the French capital where North
Vietnamese negotiator Le Due Tho has been waiting
since last Saturday.
