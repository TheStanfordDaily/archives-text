# Ellsberg Motions Denied By Judge
##

Special to the Daily
LOS ANGELES — U.S. District Court
Judge Matthew Byrne Jr. late
yesterday denied two more defense
motions during another pre-trial
hearing in the Pentagon Papers case.
His rulings appeared to have cleared
the way for a possible resumption of
the trial next week.
Byrne denied a defense request that
the defendants in the case, Dr. Daniel
Ellsberg and Anthony Russo, be
allowed to cross-examine witnesses in
their own fields of expertise, espionage
and international relations.
He also denied a motion that would
have dismissed the charges against the
pair on grounds of improper behavior
by the government in its investigation
of Ellsberg and Russo.
They are charged with various
violations of the Espionage Act for
their alleged roles in photocopying the
Pentagon Papers, a "top secret" study
of the United States' involvement in
Indochina, and distributing copies to
various newspapers across the country.
Dismissal Motion
Earlier in the day, Byrne took
under consideration a key defense
motion that would call for the
dismissal of the present jury in the
case and the selection of a new panel.
The present jury was impaneled
July 21, but has not been in court
since Aug. 9. The jurors have been
instructed to ignore any mention of
the case or the defendants.
Defense attorney Leonard Boudin
termed the four-month "hiatus"
unprecedented and argued that a new
jury should be chosen to avoid an
"aberrational form of jury trial."
The trial has been in recess while

the defense pursued an unsuccessful
plea to the U.S. Supreme Court. The
defendants asked the high court to
rule on governmental wiretap that
cropped up in an earlier pre-trial
hearing, but the court voted several
weeks ago not to hear the case.
Boudin argued that the jurors must
have become "sensitized" on several
key subjects such as national security
by recent statements made about the
defendants by Vice President Spiro T.
Agnew and Senator Robert J. Dole,
Chairman of the Republican National
Committee.
No Arguments
Chief prosecutor David Nisson did
not make any additional oral
arguments against the motion, and
maintained that the present jury is
adequate to try the case. He told the
court that the 12 affidavits submitted
by the defense in support of its
motion "are worth more to the court
as blank paper than as affidavits."
Most of the statements are signed by
university professors, many of them
from Harvard.
Bryne is expected to rule on the
motion when court resumes this
morning. He will also hear oral
arguments on two other motions, one
dealing with wiretapping and the other
a motion to have Russo declared a
pauper.
Byrne has also ordered the 18
jurors and alternates to appear so that
he may conduct voirdire examination
to determine whether or not they
followed his instructions to ignore all
mention of the case. If Byrne rules
against the defense on the motion for
a new jury he is expected to reopen
the trial Wednesday.

university professors, many of them
from Harvard.
Bryne is expected to rule on the
motion when court resumes this
morning. He will also hear oral
arguments on two other motions, one
dealing with wiretapping and the other
a motion to have Russo declared a
pauper.
Byrne has also ordered the 18
jurors and alternates to appear so that
he may conduct voirdire examination
to determine whether or not they
followed his instructions to ignore all
mention of the case. If Byrne rules
against the defense on the motion for
a new jury he is expected to reopen
the trial Wednesday.
Special to the Daily
LOS ANGELES — U.S. District Court
Judge Matthew Byrne Jr. late
yesterday denied two more defense
motions during another pre-trial
hearing in the Pentagon Papers case.
His rulings appeared to have cleared
the way for a possible resumption of
the trial next week.
Byrne denied a defense request that
the defendants in the case, Dr. Daniel
Ellsberg and Anthony Russo, be
allowed to cross-examine witnesses in
their own fields of expertise, espionage
and international relations.
He also denied a motion that would
have dismissed the charges against the
pair on grounds of improper behavior
by the government in its investigation
of Ellsberg and Russo.
They are charged with various
violations of the Espionage Act for
their alleged roles in photocopying the
Pentagon Papers, a "top secret" study
of the United States' involvement in
Indochina, and distributing copies to
various newspapers across the country.
Dismissal Motion
Earlier in the day, Byrne took
under consideration a key defense
motion that would call for the
dismissal of the present jury in the
case and the selection of a new panel.
The present jury was impaneled
July 21, but has not been in court
since Aug. 9. The jurors have been
instructed to ignore any mention of
the case or the defendants.
Defense attorney Leonard Boudin
termed the four-month "hiatus"
unprecedented and argued that a new
jury should be chosen to avoid an
"aberrational form of jury trial."
The trial has been in recess while

the defense pursued an unsuccessful
plea to the U.S. Supreme Court. The
defendants asked the high court to
rule on governmental wiretap that
cropped up in an earlier pre-trial
hearing, but the court voted several
weeks ago not to hear the case.
Boudin argued that the jurors must
have become "sensitized" on several
key subjects such as national security
by recent statements made about the
defendants by Vice President Spiro T.
Agnew and Senator Robert J. Dole,
Chairman of the Republican National
Committee.
No Arguments
Chief prosecutor David Nisson did
not make any additional oral
arguments against the motion, and
maintained that the present jury is
adequate to try the case. He told the
court that the 12 affidavits submitted
by the defense in support of its
motion "are worth more to the court
as blank paper than as affidavits."
Most of the statements are signed by
university professors, many of them
from Harvard.
Bryne is expected to rule on the
motion when court resumes this
morning. He will also hear oral
arguments on two other motions, one
