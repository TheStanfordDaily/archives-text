# Survey Ranks Status Of Majors
## 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
Students consider biology the
highest-status major at Stanford. A
survey of 203 sophomores, juniors,
and seniors done by students in Prof.
Morris Zelditch's Sociology I class
revealed this finding.
Each member of the class was
required to interview three students,
asking them to rank 16 selected
majors, and also to answer several
questions designed to prove or
disprove the "functional theory of
stratification" which states that the
value persons give to some trait (in this
case, major) will be in proportion to
the value they give to a specific goal in
this case, reasons for coming here.
In order to attempt to verify the
hypothesis, TA's Don Comstock and
Joane Nagel, who compiled the results,
broke the results down into two parts,
with psychology and physics turning
out to be the keys.
Students who ranked psychology
from one to five on the 16-major scale
tended to place physics over five
positions lower than those who ranked
psychology lower.
The reasons for this were
apparently found in the responses to
the question "when you ranked the
majors, what rationale did you use?"
Of the students who ranked
psychology high, 47.4 percent gave
"popularity" as the reason, while only
10.3 percent mentioned "difficulty."
However, only 16.0 percent of those

who ranked psychology low used
popularity as a criteria, while 46.2
percent mentioned difficulty, a nearly
perfect inverse ratio.
Other reasons chosen for ranking
the majors were career or grad school,
social relevance, and reasons which
were not codeable.
Another question asked by the
survey was, "Why do you think most
students come to Stanford?" Over 80
percent of the students chose
"prestige" as a reason, however
students who mentioned other reasons
in addition to prestige were put into
the other groupings. Academic quality
was the second most frequent reason
chosen, with career goals third, and
location fourth.
Results of the question "Why did
you come to Stanford?" turned out to
be very similar.
No systematic difference was
observed between students who
ranked psychology high and physics
low and the inverse group in answering
either of these questions, and there
was also no difference in ranking by
age, living group, or sex, thus throwing
doubt on the "functional theory of
stratification."
Students in the humanities tended
to rate the sciences higher than those
in other fields; students in the
biological sciences ranked psychology
higher than the norm, and students in
the behavioral sciences showed a small

tendency to rate their own majors
lower than others. No group showed a
significant tendency to overrate their
own majors.
Results of the tabular survey of
majors follow. Ranking one includes
those who ranked psychology from
one to five, and the major criterion for
ranking was popularity. Ranking two
includes those who ranked psychology
six to 15, and who most frequently
mentioned difficulty as their criterion
for ranking. The lower the mean rank,
the higher the status of the major.

The following chart is the result of
the survey for all 203 students. The 16
majors selected were chosen to
represent different fields of study, and
the survey is not intended to be an
exact ranking. Physical Education is
not an undergraduate major at
Stanford, however, respondants were
asked to rank it anyway.
