## Grad Describes Martial Law 
### KATHY ALCALA 
Doug Sorenson, a Stanford graduate
who was deported from the
Philippines recently, spoke in the
Tresidder Large Lounge last night on
his experiences in the Philippines.
Addressing an audience of about 60
people, many of them Philippinos,
Sorenson described how President
Marcos established martial law and the
consequences hnvp resulted.
According to Sorenson, Marcos had
three main reasons for declaring
martial law.
The first is Marcos' personal
ambition. According to Time
magazine, Marcos is probably the
richest man in Asia. He has about 200
million dollars in liquid assets, mostly
in real estate, which has been gained
since he took power.
Military Assistance
According to Sorenson, President
Johnson gave 42 million dollars in
military assistance to the Philippines in
1966. A few years later, the U.S.
Senate held hearings to find out what
happened to the money. At that time
it was decided that Marcos had
personally kept it.
Sorenson continued that since
Marcos's term as President was due to
expire next year, he had planned on
having his wife run for the office.

However, since he himself is so
unpopular, there was no possibility
that she would win. Marcos therefore
decided to have a constitutional
convention to revise the government
body into a parliament, with Marcos
serving as the President through the
indefinite transition period. This has
been accomplished.
The second reason is the enormous
interests which American business has
in the Philippines. Sorenson feels that
this is a "perfect case study of
imperialism." American business has
control of over 50 percent of the
natural resources in the Philippines,
especially oil companies such as Getty
and Mobil. There is a two billion dollar
investment which provides a return of
18 percent to the U.S. each year.
Martial Law
According to the Daily Express, the
official government newspaper in the
Philippines, said Sorenson, American
representatives approached Marcos to
declare martial law. They made an

"explicit deal" that the U.S. would
support his regime if he would stand
behind U.S. business. The main reason
for this was that the Parity
Amendment, a law which allowed U.S.
ownership and control of resources in
the Philippines, was due to expire in
1974.
Finally, there is a "strong, growing,
nationalist movement," says Sorenson,
which would like to rid the country ot
American military bases, limit
American economic control, and
"change the basically feudal system of
land tenure" which now exists. It is
supported by both businessmen and
farmers who have suffered from the
present situation. Sorenson feels that
the popular movement will ultimately
win "not so much from the statistics,
as from the people's will to fight."
The National Committee for the
Restoration of Civil Liberties in the
Philippines will hold a rally December
2 in San Francisco's Union Square, at
which Sorenson will be present.
