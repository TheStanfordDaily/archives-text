## 12 More Years?

The reports from Saigon that as many as 10,000
American advisers and technicians are replacing U.S. military
men in Vietnam are disturbing — to put it mildly.
The civilian advisers, half of whom are already in
Vietnam and many of whom — while civilians — are
graduates of West Point, will carry out wide-ranging military
advisory functions under Defense Department contracts to
private firms.
Thus it is that under Richard Nixon, disciple of
"Vietnamization" and bringer of "a generation of peace,"
the U.S. is taking advantage of an apparent loophole in the
proposed peace agreement to reverse the process of the past
four years. The development can only add weight to the
radical argument that our Indochina policy was never merely
the product of mistakes and remains fundamentally
unchanged, and that any peace treaty will, at best, be but a
pause in a continuing struggle for a relatively insignificant
piece of Southeast Asia.
Yet the Nixon administration continues to assure the
American people that peace is just around the corner.
Perhaps so, if peace means simply a drop in American
casualties, but certainly not in any larger sense of the word,
and almost certainly not for the war-weary people of
Vietnam. They cry peace, peace, but there is no peace.
Equally disturbing is the apparently conscious attempt by
American officials on every level to keep the whole matter
of postwar planning under wraps. "It's just not in the
national interest to have these things known," one military
spokesman blithely assured reporters. But if there has been
any lasting lesson in the past decade of the American
national experience, it is precisely that popular knowledge
of; covert government operations is vital to the national
interest.
The turnover of the American presence in Vietnam from
the military to private companies may be a step forward for
private enterprise, but it threatens to leave America in the
same old quagmire, enmeshed in the very jungles the
energies of the last six years have been directed toward
extricating us from.
We have had twelve years of this war. Our bodies and
spirits, and those of the people of Vietnam, cannot stand
twelve more. Let us have peace.
