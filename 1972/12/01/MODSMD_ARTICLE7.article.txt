## Hopkins Issues Unresolved 
### 
Richard 1. roth

Three columns more or less
pertinent to the future of
Stanford's Hopkins Marine
Station have appeared in recent
issues of the Daily. In the first of
these (Nov. 15), Allen Shotwell
may have taken undue license
with several matters of fact or
conjecture, but he expressed
legitimate concern about the
impact of Dr. Welton Lee's failure
to be promoted to the tenured
rank of associate professor.
In his Nov. 20 rebuttal Ward
Watt quite properly pointed out
Mr. Shotwell's probable
misconceptions as to the role of
the Department of Biological
Sciences in the fiscal management
of Hopkins. He also, with some
justification, takes umbrage at Mr.
Shotwell's implication that the
quality of teaching at the Marine
Station is superior to that at the
main campus and that teaching
and research are mutually
incompatible pursuits.
However, Dr. Watt's article is
in several respects inadequate as a
rebuttal to Mr. Shotwell's article
or even as a sop to students and
others who share Mr. Shotwell's
concern. This is perhaps most
strikingly illustrated by Dr. Watt's
failure even to mention the
circumstance which clearly
precipitated Mr. Shotwell's article
— viz., Dr. Lee's virtually
irrevocable failure to attain a
secure appointment at Stanford.
Views Summarized
Three issues are raised by
Shotwell's and Watt's articles
which, in my estimation, have yet
to be resolved. These are: (1) the
substance and impact of what
appears to have been a
confidential report on Hopkins
submitted by a site visit team
drawn from outside the
University, (2) student access to
information pertinent to the
operation of the University and —
related to this — (3) the teaching
and research obligations of faculty
members. I wish now to
summarize my own views on each
of these topics.
There seems to be no
disagreement as to the favorable
nature of what I shall call 'The
Hopkins Report." Let us also
accept that the aim of the
Department of Biological Sciences
and the University is as Watt has
said . . to maintain its
[Hopkins'] present excellent

teaching performance ... [and]
. . . preservation and
strengthening of the Hopkins
Marine Station."
How, then, does one reconcile
a promise to preserve and
strengthen a teaching institution
with an accomplished reduction in
the teaching staff and research
facilities of that institution?
Superficially, at least, what has
been promised vis-a-vis what has
been accomplished reinforces an
already uncomfortable feeling
that Newspeak is more than an
idea in the mind of Orwell.
'Proven Effectiveness'
Plans may be "to hire at least
one more" faculty member for
Hopkins. (See Mr. Thompson's
Daily article of Nov. 27.) But such
plans must be unreassuring, if not
galling, to those who fail to
comprehend why a classroom
teacher of proven effectiveness
should be replaced by a
teacher/researcher who has not
received a stamp of approval from
Stanford students.
In fairness to the
administrative officers of the
University and of the Biology
Department, concerned students
have recently been given access to
the Hopkins Report and Dr.
Wessells has met with students to
discuss both the situation at
Hopkins and the teaching and
research obligations of faculty
members.
Student misconceptions of
many aspects of the operation of
Stanford University have
contributed greatly to what may
now legitimately be called "The
Hopkins Controversy." In very
broad terms, these misconceptions
relate to (1) the acquisition and
management of the financial
resources of the University and
(2) the manner in which
recommendations for academic
appointments and promotions
originate and the intricate
academic and administrative maze
through which such
recommendations must
successfully pass before the Board
of Trustees confers its approval or
disapproval.
Approved By Department
In the present context it is
necessary to point out that it was
not (as implied in Mr. Shotwell's
article) the Department of
Biological Sciences which denied
Dr. Lee tenure. The Department

twice recommended Dr. Lee's
promotion and this
recommendation was twice denied
by the Committee on
Appointments and Promotions of
the School of Humanities and
Sciences.
Watt's denial of "opposition
between teaching and research" is
singularly remarkable.
"Publish-or-perish" is no myth in
terms of acquisition of tenure at
Stanford. This is particularly
disadvantageous to those junior
faculty members who are
primarily interested in teaching,
and, financial considerations
aside, may ultimately be
detrimental to the University.
