# cultural genocide
## Back In The USSR 
###

Like their ancestors of two
millenia ago, Soviet Jews are
suffering from, but not yielding
to, an attempt at cultural
genocide. This cultural genocide is
a kind of slow strangulation, far
less dramatic than the sudden
harsh decree of the Greek ruler
Antiochus I. Rather, synagogues
are torn down and permission is
denied to replace them.
The Hebrew press is illegal
as is the production, sale, or
importation of religious books or
articles.
The once flourishing Yiddish
theatre is no more, the Yiddish

press reduced to one paper which
parrots the party line. Except for
a few scattered stores in Moscow,
Odessa, and Minsk, kosher meat is
unavailable. And while
anti-religious propaganda in
general abounds in the Soviet
Union, only the Jews are
prohibited separate schools,
separate papers, a separate radio
program, and contact with their
brethren abroad.
All this seems very distant
from Stanford and not very
noteworthy in a world where
Catholics and Protestants in
Northern Ireland terrorize each
other, Nigerians slaughter
Biafrans, Pakistanis nearly
annihilate Bengalese, and
Americans commit daily war
crimes in southeast Asia.
As well, the plight of Soviet
Jews is an old one, and is for
many Jews almost embarassingly
parochial, yet without the
emotional impact of the Mideast
question. And then it is not
exactly a popular subject for
radical protest; Angela Davis, for
example, saw fit to ignore it while
recently extolling the "noble
achievements" of the Soviet
Union during her visit there. (But
then Ms. Davis, that would-be
revolutionary, has remained
oblivious to the pleas for moral
and verbal support from Czech
and Russian dissidents as well.)
Finally, talk of "Russian Jewry"
smacks of Cold War rhetoric
during a time of increasing
detente.
But despite all these factors,
the plight of Soviet Jews
continues and the issue will not go
away. Those of us who are Jews
have particularly nightmarish

memories of how silence can
destroy a people; decent people
everywhere must by now be
sensitive to the morally corrosive
effects of silence for the
individual. And so if the issue of
cultural genocide isn't the most
dramatic or most pressing issue
around, it yet compels a response.
What can be done? The Soviet
Union has shown itself
surprisingly responsive to world
public opinion in the past (witness
the response to the pleas for
clemency for those accused of the
so-called "Leningrad hijacking
plot"). Letters should be written
to appropriate officials at the
United Nations, including
Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim,
to Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei
Gromyko, to President Nixon,
Secretary of State Rogers,
Presidential foreign policy advisor
Henry Kissinger, Senators
Cranston and Tunney,
Congressman McCloskey, and
other officials. And peaceful
demonstrations to dramatize the
plight of Soviet Jews must
continue when visiting Soviet
speakers or cultural groups visit
this area.
Above all, we are morally
obligated not to forget our
oppressed brothers and sisters in
Russia. The oft-quoted words of
Hillel bear repeating:
If I am not for myself,
who is for me?
If I am only for myself,
what I am?
If not now, when?
