What do you call two stereo jf
systems that have identically the
insides, but not the same outsides? «• r w
Well, you call one a Sylvania compact *
stereo system. It's stacked and compact with tuner /
amplifier, turntable, and tape player all in one unit.
And you call the other a Sylvania component stereo system. Each unit is sepa
rate so you can spread it around any way you want it.
Inside, though, they're the same. Both have an RMS rating of 12.5 watts per
channel (20 watts IHF)with each channel driven into 8 ohms. There are identical
FETs, ICs, and ceramic IF filters in the AM Stereo FM tuner/amplifiers. Both offer
the sameswitchable main and remote speaker jacks, headphone jacks, aux jacks, tape
monitor, and built-in matrix four-channel capability for the new quadrasonic sound.
The turntables are Garrard automatics with magnetic cartridges and diamond styluses.
The 4-track stereo record /playback cassette decks are the same. And both air-suspen
sion speaker systems contain two 8-inch woofers and two 3-inch tweeters.
So if they're the same, how come they're different?
Because different people want the same great stereo sound different ways. So
we give it to them.
Come on down to your Sylvania dealer's for a look and a listen.
Then you can pick the shape you want as well as the sound you like.
