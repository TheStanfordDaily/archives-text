# Judge Denies Two Defense Motions In Andrea Holman-Benton Burt Case
## 
### ROBERT BACON 
Two motions described as "crucial"
by the defense were denied last week
in the Andrea Holman-Benton Burt
prison escape-guard murder case in
Ontario, Calif., but on Tuesday a
defense discovery motion was largely
granted.
Holman, 18, the daughter of
Stanford Medical Prof. Halsted
Holman, and Burt are charged with
murdering a prison guard and lynching
(taking from custody) state prison
inmate Ronald Beaty on Oct. 6.
On Nov. 30, their attorneys moved
for dismissal of the charges on the
grounds of insufficient evidence, and
for bail. San Bernardino County
Superior Court Judge Ricnard C.
Garner denied both motions. The elder
Holman indicated that the denials
would be appealed to the State Court
of Appeals.
Insufficient Evidence
According to Dr. Holman, the
defense sought dismissal both because
the evidence presented to the grand
jury by the prosecutor was
insufficient, and because "exonerating
and contradictory evidence was
withheld, evidence that the police
investigation had uncovered."
The two defendants surrendered to

police Oct. 23, claiming innocence.
They have been incarcerated in San
Bernardino since that time.
Dr. Holman described the evidence
against them as "very meager" and
said it was "not clear" whether the
prosecution claims that the two
actually physically perpetrated the
crime or only that they planned or
aided it. California law makes no
distinction between principals and
accessories before the fact.
Venceremos
The elder Holman said that in
denying bail, the judge mentioned
Andrea Holman's membership in
Venceremos, the Bay Area
revolutionary organization. 'The
judge, not the prosecutor, introduced
the issue of Andrea's political beliefs,"
Dr. Holman noted. Beaty is also a
Venceremos member.
State law provides that bail is not
mandatory in murder cases, but may
be denied where "proof of guilt is
evident or the presumption thereof
great."
The motion for discovery of
prosecution evidence was granted,
with the exception of information
about the escape generally which does
not pertain to the two defendants, Dr.

Holman said. Beaty has not been seen
since the escape.
Charles Garry
The defendants are represented by
attorneys Thomas Nolan of Menlo
Park and Charles Garry of San
Francisco. The prosecutor is San
Bernardino County Deputy District
Attorney Kenneth Kloepfer.
Trial of the case is scheduled to
begin Jan. 8 in Ontario. According to
Dr. Holman, the next court
appearance in the case will be a
pre-trial hearing on Dec. 28. He said
that no further pre-trial motions were
planned by the defense, and hoped
and expected that their appeals would
not delay the trial.
The two were indicted by a grand
jury Nov. 10. This is an unusual
procedure; evidence against defendants
in custody is usually presented at an
adversary preliminary hearing rather
than a closed grand jury proceeding.
Ex-convict
Beaty and Burt, an ex-convict,
became acquainted when both were
inmates at the California Institution
for Men in Chino. Beaty was
incarcerated there when he escaped.
Burt and Andrea Holman worked in
a prison law project in Hayward prior
to their arrest. Beaty was among the
prisoners whom they assisted.
Beaty escaped on Oct. 6 when a car
carrying him and two unarmed guards
to a court appearance was ambushed
near the prison. Guard trainee Jesus
(Jesse) Sanchez was fatally shot; guard
George Fitzgerald was wounded.
On Oct. 13, an all-points bulletin
was issued for Holman, Burt, and
Albert and Yolanda deLuna. The
deLunas have not been found. Holman
and Burt surfaced and surrendered on
Oct. 23, after San Bernardino
authorities obtained arrest warrants.
Two additional persons, including
David Strain, son of Stanford draft
counselor Alan Strain, were arrested in

connection with the escape and then
released.
While investigating the case, San
Bernardino County Sheriff's deputies
searched a house in Mountain View.
Shortly thereafter, several Venceremos
members filed suit for return of
property seized there. Police
authorities did not oppose the request
and the property was returned.
