Course Review Funding
Editor:
At the most recent meeting of
the Publications Board the
principal topic of discussion was
the Course Review, which as we
all know, has yet to see print. For
the benefit of those who have
joined the Board since Tuesday
(myself included) the chairman of
the Board explained that at the
time of the Board's decision not
to fund the Course Review there
was little or no perceptible
student interest in having such a
review and that if such a review
were to be printed it could not
hope to be self sustaining.
I believe that with the
exception of the Daily, the
Course Review is in all likelihood
the most needed and relevant
publication that could and should
be made available to the student
body. At this point in time the
Course Review is very much alive
and it is hoped on the part of
those who are working so hard to
put it out that it will be available
early next quarter.
I personally would find such a
review most useful and intend to
lend my help to the Course
Review staff in any way that I
can. I would hope that everyone
who is interested in seeing the
publication of the Review actually
happen will contact Brent Appel
about working on the Review. In
addition, I believe that a review
such as this can be self supporting
at a relatively small cost to the
individual. The contention that
the funding of the Course Review
will be an open pit in which to
toss ASSU funds can be refuted
by student support of the Review.

Evaluation form 'Offensive'
Editor:
I find the ASSU Course
Evaluation form offensive and
inconsistent with the values that
should be inherent in a
community based upon trust, free
inquiry, and mutual respect
between professor and student.
Beginning with the salutation,
"Now is your chance to grade the
instructor," there is a disquieting
feeling of vengeance â€” an attitude
of "us" against "them."
As a first year graduate
student, I am investing
approximately $20,000 in
unrealized income and in expenses
incurred by me and my family.
This investment represents ten
years' savings with the primary
goal of my learning as much from
the University and particular
professors whom I have chosen as
I can. There is a presumption on
my part that both Stanford and
the family are acting in good faith
and intend to create a good
learning environment and use
their teaching skills in my behalf.
If I judge that the experience is
not worthwhile, I'll certainly leave
prematurely, having told faculty
and administration precisely why
I've chosen to do so. If a teacher
were to ask me for an evaluation
of his course, I'd gladly oblige. If
the administration were to ask for
a course evaluation, I'd oblige
only after receiving agreement
from the teacher involved.
In any case such an evaluation
ought to be signed by the
evaluator, signifying that he is
willing to bear the responsibility
for his attitudes. I simply can't
condone making "information
public and available to anyone
interested," when the information
has been gathered irresponsibly.

All or Nothing
Attitude
Editor:
Mr. Virga's blast (Daily, Nov.
29) at male chauvinists is
righteous indignation almost at its
best. One crucial thing is lacking:
experience (of life, the opposite

sex; some knowledge of the past
and a little reflection on it might
also help).
With his plea for more gentility
we can all agree, though I submit
there is such a thing as feminine
ruthlessness which can also stand
some taming.
What I strenuously object to is
this: "In this struggle for freedom,
there is no middle ground." Mr.
Virga is clearly in the throes of
adolescent agony, the kind that
inevitably breeds all-or-nothing
attitudes. It makes for good
poetry, like Lautreamont's or
Rimbaud's. It also makes for
terrible human relations.

Lousy Vocabulary
Editor:
Why does the Stanford Daily
continue to print articles that
have no quality of vocabulary or
composition and suffer from the
four-letter word syndrome ("Are
We Liberated Men?" Nov. 29)?
Such articles no doubt are
usually written by verbal cripples
for the slack-jawed type of
individual.
Severe editing should be
exercised by the editors of
publications of "leading
institutions" such as Stanford and
if I were now a student I would be
ashamed to send home a copy of
the Daily to my parents.

Roble Picture
Misleading
Editor:
The picture shown on the first
page of the Dec. 1 issue
representing racial segregation in
Roble dining halls was misleading.
The students shown eating at the
all-white, "nearly invariably
separate" table in the foreground
were celebrating the first night of
the Jewish holiday, Chanukah.
Although a picture is worth a
thousand words, looks can be
deceiving.

Racism And Statism
Editor:
The events at Southern
University symbolize the race
hatred and statism that have
corroded American society; race
hatred because of the outrageous
conduct of the predominantly
white police when dealing with
black students; statism because
the issue underlying the sit-in was
student control of their own lives
which the state authorities sought
to deny.
Such a happening can only
have a sobering affect on the
Stanford community, for in this
tragedy the intractibility of
obstacles to racial and personal
freedom in American society are
re-illustrated. We can only hope
that the deaths at Southern
University further our resolve to
remove the race hatred and
statism that are their ultimate
cause.

Hocker Appreciated
Editor:
I merely want to state my
satisfaction that an article such as
"Last Column of the Year" by
Chris Hocker (Daily, Nov. 28) was
printed.
Having been a staff member for
six years and having been
completely turned off by the
editorial policy of the Daily for a
good deal of the past couple of
years, 1 want you to know that I
do appreciate the articles by Mr.
Hocker.
