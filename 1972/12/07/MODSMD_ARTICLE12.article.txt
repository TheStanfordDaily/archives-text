## Roy Ash: Stalwart Of The Military-Industrial Complex News in Review 
### Bill Evers

In recent weeks, the
newspapers have been full of news
of the personnel shuffle being
carried out by Nixon in the
executive branch of the U.S.
government. While many old
names are now associated with
different posts, a new name is that
of Roy L. Ash. Ash was the
president of Litton Industries and
now is the newly-appointed head
of the White House Office of
Management and Budget.
Ash's appointment has a
special significance. The post he
has obtained and the reins of
power which he now has gathered
in his hands did not even exist
four years ago. The Office of
Management and Budget was
created during an executive
branch reorganization planned
and designed by Ash himself at
the time of Nixon's election to his
first term. Now Nixon talks about
an "expanded role" for the post.
To better understand just what
Ash's appointment means, it is
necessary to examine the
reorganization plans drawn up for
Nixon by Ash's task force and
also to examine Ash's own
background as the accounting and
financial expert in Litton, a
company whose lifeblood is
government contract money.
Realignment
A business leader like Ash has
concrete reasons for desiring
executive branch realignment. The
scope and responsibility of the
national government (especially
its executive branch) have vastly
expanded in the past half-century,
beginning during Herbert Hoover's
administration. But some feel the
structure of government has not
kept pace. The existing
governmental structure is deemed
unsuitable for the activities many
influential businessmen and other
political decision-makers wish the
government would undertake.
In the words of Charles M.
Hardin of the Rockefeller
Foundation, "Many of the
political institutions,
organizations, and practices as
well as much of the political
ideology in the United States
conspire to elevate local, special,
separate, and 'pluralistic' interests
— despite the fact that national
survival now depends upon the
ability to fix political attention
steadily upon national problems
and interests." Really, of course, in
the name of abolishing special
interests, a reorganization plan
will allow some special interests to
supplant others.
The task force headed by Ash
is aimed at diminishing the
influence wielded by small,
parochial groups and "their"
agencies within the governmental
structure. Much of the
"inefficient" patchwork quilt of
boards, agencies, bureaus, etc.
found in something like the
Department of Agriculture has
grown up in response to the
desires of localized or functionally

narrow interest groups. The
present organizational jumble
reflects the demands of these
petty interests.
Complicated Enterprise
Sen. John McClellan has aptly
described the complexity of the
government today: "The
executive branch is now the
largest and most complicated
enterprise in the world, with more
than 1400 domestic programs
distributed among 150 separate
departments, agencies, bureaus,
and boards."
Under the reorganization plan
proposed by Ash, all domestic
affairs would be run by a
Domestic Council, parallel to the
National Security Council in
foreign affairs.
Drastic surgery would be
performed on the seven domestic
departments that are in operation
now — Interior; Agriculture;
Labor; Commerce; Treasury;

Transportation; Housing and
Urban Development; and Health,
Education, and Welfare. They
would be cut up and sewn
together again to form a total of
four departments — Natural
Resources (to control the nation's
physical assets), Human Resources
(to retrain the labor force and run
the welfare system), Community
Development (to build up the
nation's infrastructure and rebuild
the cities), and Economic Affairs
(to handle the currency,
labor-management relations, and
other business and farm matters).
Key Member
The key member of the
Domestic Council would be the
Office of Management and
Budget, which would be the
central fiscal planner for the
economy. It would synchronize
and coordinate all government
domestic action.
Ash's proposed regrouping
enables the government in
partnership with industry to come
to grip with problems in a whole
new fashion. If a policy proposal
comes up, the budget can be
looked at and the program added
to it without danger of operating
at cross-purposes with another
part of the government.
In the Office of Management
and Budget will be centralized the
measurement of programs'
successes and the decisions on
which programs work best as a
package.
Program Budgeting
The Office of Management and
Budget, with the help of the
Brookings Institution, has
increasingly since its inception

been turning to a budgeting
procedure known as program
budgeting. When budgets are
constructed on a program basis,
decision making is centralized and
made by visible high-level officials
rather than by the invisible
subcommittees and lower echelon
bureaucrats who tend to
formulate budget requests under
the item-by-item way of
budgeting. Significantly, the lower
levels of departments are more
likely to reflect petty interests
rather than nationally powerful
ones like Ash's own Litton
Industries.
In fact, the whole idea of
program budgeting lends itself to
the contracting of government
programs to firms (like Litton)
outside the government. Program
budgeting presents budget
requests in terms of the final
products, in terms of program
packages, rather than in the

traditional line-item form which
emphasized categories like
personnel, overhead, supplies, etc.
Under program budgeting,
there is a special plausibility to
contracting with a company like
Litton to build a large integrated
"weapons system" like the
McNamara proposal for a
worldwide fleet of floating
military bases or to operate the
War on Poverty's Job Corps
Center in Pleasanton, California
In fact, these were actual Litton
contracts.
As Karl Hess wrote in the Jan.
15, 1969 issue of Politics
newsletter, at the time of the
initial publicity for Ash's
reorganization proposals, "Litton
is an industrial conglomerate, one
of the new breed of 'capitalist'
cats which is created, head to
foot, from government contacts

and contracts. Lately [Litton] has
branched out into what might be
called the subcontracting of the
business of government."
Litton's contract to run the
Job Corps center was hailed by
the late Lyle Spencer of IBM as a
primary example of the growth
and development of what Spencer
called the "social-industrial
complex," an arrangement parallel
to the military-industrial complex,
but paying companies tax funds
to work the welfare state side of
the American system.
Ash's former boss Charles B.
Thornton, chairman of the board
of Litton, has himself been an
advocate of the social-industrial
complex approach. Thornton
headed an advisory panel to the
Kerner Commission on Civil
Disorders. His panel, in its
recommendations, used the
analogy of the space program and
defense spending in suggesting
that the government's strategy for
urban areas be one of granting
credits against taxes to business
firms.
But Litton has by no means
neglected the warfare state side of
the American system. In fact, Ash
once said about Litton that
because "almost all new products
have their first application in
military uses, we always want at
least 25 percent of our business
in defense and space."
Ash's statement about the
military sector prompted an
incisive analysis from David
Horowitz and Reese Erlich in
Ramparts. They wrote, "In the
old days, private corporations
would develop technological
innovations at their own expense,
risking the outlay with a view to
being rewarded by future returns
from the competitive
marketplace. This was the very
essence of entrepreneurship
[But now the corporations] have
become accustomed to getting the
government to pick up the tab
before they move. These
corporations have grown
economically lazy, in part because
they really can live better on the
largess of the so-called welfare
state."

The Ramparts writers added
that "if the corporation is
spending the government's
money, the government is
spending the taxpayer's. If he had
a very clear idea of it, the
taxpayer might frown on this
happy arrangement and spoil all
the fun "
Now Litton threatens to
become a further burden to the
taxpayers. According to Sen.
William Proxmire, Litton
threatens "to become the Navy's
Lockheed." Litton has maintained
that the Navy should pay it $380
million for cancellation costs and
design changes encountered in its
building of five landing helicopter
assault ships.
Last June, Proxmire wrote: "I

now have reason to believe that
because of cash shortages, Litton
is confronted with a financial
crisis of major proportions. I am
informed that in order to
extricate itself from its financial
problems, the company is
attempting to persuade the Navy
to pay millions of dollars of
worthless and inflated claims. Or,
alternatively, to restructure the
LHA [landing helicopter assault
ship] contract or take other steps
to solve Litton's shipbuilding
problems, including a Navy
takeover of the Litton shipyards
at Pascagoula."
The appointment of Ash as
head of the Office of Management
and Budget indicates the
continued importance both of the

military-industrial complex and of
the rising social-industrial
complex and marks a heightened
concern of these interests in the
fiscal processes of taxation and
government expenditure.
Furthermore, those people
who do not like governmental
aggrandizement, whether by way
of subsidization or by way of
repression, can only view
negatively the rise of an efficiency
expert like Ash. In the name of
efficiency power is being
transferred from some hands to
others. And anyway, what's so
wonderful about bad things being
done more efficiently?
