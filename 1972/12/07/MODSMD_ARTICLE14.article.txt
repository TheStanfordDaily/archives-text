# Pentagon Papers Defendants Aren't Smiling
## 
### ED KOHN 
LOS ANGELES - Dr. Daniel
Ellsberg, once famous for his
intense, almost infectious grin,
isn't smiling too much these days
as he sits in a dark-paneled
courtroom waiting for the
resumption of his long-delayed
trial on charges of violating the
Espionage Act, conspiracy and
theft of government property.
Ellsberg's co-defendant,
Anthony J. Russo, less
well-known and less public with
his emotions, isn't doing that
much smiling, either.
And their battery of attorneys
looks positively downcast, even
when it wins a minor judicial
victory, as it did last Friday when
it succeeded in delaying the trial
for at least one more week until
Dec. 12.
In fact, no one srnles in the
courtroom where one of the most
complex trials in recent history is
about to resume. There simply is
no time, or occasion, to smile.
Copying The Papers
Ellsberg and Russo are charged
with making Xerox copies of the
Pentagon Papers (official title:
"History of U.S. Decision-Making
Process in Viet Nam") and
distributing them to various
newspapers, including the New
York Times, the Washington Post
and the Boston Globe.

Ellsberg has never denied that
he duplicated the papers and gave
them, at least indirectly, to the
newspapers and newspaper chains.
However, he contends that he has
done nothing illegal.
The Pentagon Papers study was
ordered by former President
Lyndon Johnson shortly before
he left office. Parts of the Papers
bore a "Top Secret" classification,
and even members of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee
were unable to obtain copies of
the report.
Ellsberg and Russo hope to use
the impending trial as a platform
from which to air their antiwar
views before the national press. At
the same time, they apparently
are seeking a determination of the
legality of the Indochinese War, a
subject that courts have so far
refused to rule upon.
Legal Spin-Offs
There have been a phenominal
number of legal spin-offs as a
result of the publication of the
Pentagon Papers and the
accompanying litigation, and the
trial itself has been most unusual.
First, as a result of their
publication of segments of the
Papers, the Times and the Post
became embroiled in an extremely
important Supreme Court case.
The government attempted to
prevent the two papers (and

several others, such as the Globe - )
from publishing information from
the Papers on the grounds of
"national security." It succeeded
in obtaining injunctions against
both papers to prevent further
publication of any Pentagon
Papers material pending a detailed
legal review.
Prior Censorship
The newspapers believed that
the government's actions
amounted to prior censorship — a
tactic declared unconstitutional in
virtually every circumstance in a
1931 Supreme Court decision,
Near v. Minnesota — and quickly
fought the government all the way
to the Supreme Court.
In the meantime, other papers
all across the country were
publishing materials obviously
taken from the Papers.
The High Court briefly
considered the matter, and in a
6-3 decision with numerous
accompanying opinions — the
exact meaning of which legal
scholars and newspaper publishers
are still debating — lifted the
injunctions and allowed the
newspapers to continue publishing
material from the Papers.
Wiretap Argument
The second major piece of
ancillary litigation took place in
August, when the defendants
obtained a stay from Supreme
Court William O. Douglas so that
they could appeal a wiretap
question to the Supreme Court.
Although the matter has not
been explained in open court, the
government admitted that
someone connected with the
defense effort was overheard by a

government wiretap operation in a
non-domestic intelligence
investigation.
However, the Supreme Court
voted not to hear an appeal on the
issue, and the stay was lifted on
Nov. 13.
Scholar Jailed
Third, while the pre-trial
hearings — and the trial itself —
dragged on, two grand juries, one
in Boston and one in Los Angeles,
continued to investigate the
"leak" of the Papers. The grand
jury sitting in Los Angeles
returned the indictments against
Ellsberg and Russo, while the
Boston grand jury returned no
indictments in the one year and
four months it operated.
However, Samuel Popkin, a 30
year-old Harvard University
professor and expert on village life
in Vietnam, was jailed for six days
when he refused to answer certain
questions about sources of some
of his information before the
Boston grand jury.
He is the first scholar in recent
history — if ever — to be jailed for
refusing to cooperate with a grand
jury.
Popkin was released after
Harvard intervened with the
government in his behalf and
succeeded in convincing the
Justice Department to dismiss the
jury some eight weeks ahead of
schedule.
Jury Dismissal Asked
However, Popkin could be
called before another grand jury,
and should he again refuse to
answer questions, could face
another jail term of up to 18
months, the life of the grand jury.

Aside from the trial itself, the
fourth major piece of litigation to
arise from the Papers is the
defense's recent efforts to
discharge the present jury and
select a new one.
The jury now selected to hear
the case was empaneled July 25.
Shortly thereafter, Justice
Douglas granted a stay to permit a
possible Supreme Court review of
the wiretap issue, and the trial was
recessed on Aug. 9. The jury did
not reassemble until last Friday,
Dec. 1.
At the time the jurors were
dismissed, Judge William Matthew
('Matt') Byrne told them that
they would be contacted and told
to appear during early October.
However, the Supreme Court did
not announce its decision until
mid-November.
'Unprecedented' Delay
Defense lawyers term the
four-month delay in the trial since
jury selection "unprecedented"
and have told the court that the

jurors probably have become
subconsciously prejudiced against
the defense because of the delay.
In addition, defense lawyers
believe that the jurors may have
become "sensitized" to issues
involving "national security"
because of the recent national
presidential election.
When he dismissed them on
Aug. 9, Judge Byrne instructed
the jurors to ignore any mention
of the case, the Papers, or the
defendants. Jurors' families were
to censor their newspapers for
them, and jurors were told to
leave the room if any of the
forbidden topics came up on radio
or television or in conversations.
However, 10 of the 18 jurors
and alternates told the court that
they had heard references to one
or more of the forbidden subjects
during the four-month lull. But
they told the court that they
could still sit as fair and impartial
jurors in the case.
Byme then dismissed a defense

motion for a new jury. That
decision is now being challenged
in the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals and may well go to the
Supreme Court.
Classic Confrontation
The personae in this
courtroom confrontation are at
least as outstanding as those
present during the Chicago Seven
conspiracy trial. Some of the
principals:
—Ellsberg, the quixotic former
Rand Corporation researcher, a
former member of the Marine
Corps, who has spent most of his
adult life studying the U.S.
involvement in Indochina.
—Russo, another former Rand
researcher, trained as an engineer
and a political scientist, a
longtime activist against the war.
—Leonard Boudin, Ellsberg's
chief counsel, an outstanding civil
liberties lawyer and an expert on
the grand jury process who
defended Dr. Benjamin Spock
against Selective Service
conspiracy charges.
—Leonard Weinglass, Russo's
chief counsel and one of the
defense attorneys for the 'Chicago
Seven.'
—Judge Byrne, a Democrat
who served as chief counsel to the
Scranton Commission
(Presidential Commission on
Campus Unrest) and the son of a
noted federal appeals court judge
who sits in the same Los Angeles
courthouse.
— David Nissen, the
government's chief prosecutor on
the case, sharp-tongued assistant
U.S. attorney and an expert on
perjury, who served as an assistant
to Byrne while Byrne headed the
prosecutor's office prior to his
appointment to the bench.
Ellsberg Still Humorous
Through the seemingly
never-ending months of playing
"cat and mouse" with the
prosecutors, the denials of the
defense motions, the jury
selection, and the constant threat
of a 100-plus year jail sentence,
though, Ellsberg himself has not
lost his sense of humor.
Last Friday, as his attorneys
paced back and forth across the
courtroom waiting for Byrne's
ruling on their motion for a new
jury, Ellsberg casually told
reporters that he had "held a
second job at night — and it
wasn't connected with Rand"
during the 1969 antiwar
moratoria.
Ellsberg was reluctant to
specify excactly what that job
was, but it's a safe bet that one of
the prerequisite skills was a
thoroughgoing knowledge of
copying machines.

returned the indictments against
Ellsberg and Russo, while the
Boston grand jury returned no
indictments in the one year and
four months it operated.
However, Samuel Popkin, a 30
year-old Harvard University
professor and expert on village life
in Vietnam, was jailed for six days
when he refused to answer certain
questions about sources of some
of his information before the
Boston grand jury.
He is the first scholar in recent
history — if ever — to be jailed for
refusing to cooperate with a grand
jury.
Popkin was released after
Harvard intervened with the
government in his behalf and
succeeded in convincing the
Justice Department to dismiss the
jury some eight weeks ahead of
schedule.
Jury Dismissal Asked
However, Popkin could be
called before another grand jury,
and should he again refuse to
answer questions, could face
another jail term of up to 18
months, the life of the grand jury.

Aside from the trial itself, the
fourth major piece of litigation to
arise from the Papers is the
defense's recent efforts to
discharge the present jury and
select a new one.
The jury now selected to hear
the case was empaneled July 25.
Shortly thereafter, Justice
Douglas granted a stay to permit a
possible Supreme Court review of
the wiretap issue, and the trial was
recessed on Aug. 9. The jury did
not reassemble until last Friday,
Dec. 1.
At the time the jurors were
dismissed, Judge William Matthew
('Matt') Byrne told them that
they would be contacted and told
to appear during early October.
However, the Supreme Court did
not announce its decision until
mid-November.
'Unprecedented' Delay
Defense lawyers term the
four-month delay in the trial since
jury selection "unprecedented"
and have told the court that the

jurors probably have become
subconsciously prejudiced against
the defense because of the delay.
In addition, defense lawyers
believe that the jurors may have
become "sensitized" to issues
involving "national security"
because of the recent national
presidential election.
When he dismissed them on
Aug. 9, Judge Byrne instructed
the jurors to ignore any mention
of the case, the Papers, or the
defendants. Jurors' families were
to censor their newspapers for
them, and jurors were told to
leave the room if any of the
forbidden topics came up on radio
or television or in conversations.
However, 10 of the 18 jurors
and alternates told the court that
they had heard references to one
or more of the forbidden subjects
during the four-month lull. But
they told the court that they
could still sit as fair and impartial
jurors in the case.
Byme then dismissed a defense

motion for a new jury. That
decision is now being challenged
in the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals and may well go to the
Supreme Court.
Classic Confrontation
The personae in this
courtroom confrontation are at
least as outstanding as those
present during the Chicago Seven
conspiracy trial. Some of the
principals:
—Ellsberg, the quixotic former
Rand Corporation researcher, a
former member of the Marine
Corps, who has spent most of his
adult life studying the U.S.
involvement in Indochina.
—Russo, another former Rand
researcher, trained as an engineer
and a political scientist, a
longtime activist against the war.
—Leonard Boudin, Ellsberg's
chief counsel, an outstanding civil
liberties lawyer and an expert on
the grand jury process who
defended Dr. Benjamin Spock
against Selective Service
conspiracy charges.
—Leonard Weinglass, Russo's
chief counsel and one of the
defense attorneys for the 'Chicago
Seven.'
—Judge Byrne, a Democrat
who served as chief counsel to the
Scranton Commission
(Presidential Commission on
Campus Unrest) and the son of a
noted federal appeals court judge
who sits in the same Los Angeles
courthouse.
— David Nissen, the
government's chief prosecutor on
the case, sharp-tongued assistant
U.S. attorney and an expert on
perjury, who served as an assistant
to Byrne while Byrne headed the
prosecutor's office prior to his
appointment to the bench.
Ellsberg Still Humorous
Through the seemingly
never-ending months of playing
"cat and mouse" with the
prosecutors, the denials of the
defense motions, the jury
selection, and the constant threat
of a 100-plus year jail sentence,
though, Ellsberg himself has not
lost his sense of humor.
Last Friday, as his attorneys
paced back and forth across the
courtroom waiting for Byrne's
ruling on their motion for a new
jury, Ellsberg casually told
reporters that he had "held a
second job at night — and it
wasn't connected with Rand"
during the 1969 antiwar
moratoria.
Ellsberg was reluctant to
specify excactly what that job
was, but it's a safe bet that one of
the prerequisite skills was a
thoroughgoing knowledge of
copying machines.
LOS ANGELES - Dr. Daniel
Ellsberg, once famous for his
intense, almost infectious grin,
isn't smiling too much these days
as he sits in a dark-paneled
courtroom waiting for the
resumption of his long-delayed
trial on charges of violating the
Espionage Act, conspiracy and
theft of government property.
Ellsberg's co-defendant,
Anthony J. Russo, less
well-known and less public with
his emotions, isn't doing that
much smiling, either.
And their battery of attorneys
looks positively downcast, even
when it wins a minor judicial
victory, as it did last Friday when
it succeeded in delaying the trial
for at least one more week until
Dec. 12.
In fact, no one srnles in the
courtroom where one of the most
complex trials in recent history is
about to resume. There simply is
no time, or occasion, to smile.
Copying The Papers
Ellsberg and Russo are charged
with making Xerox copies of the
Pentagon Papers (official title:
"History of U.S. Decision-Making
Process in Viet Nam") and
distributing them to various
newspapers, including the New
York Times, the Washington Post
and the Boston Globe.

Ellsberg has never denied that
he duplicated the papers and gave
them, at least indirectly, to the
newspapers and newspaper chains.
However, he contends that he has
done nothing illegal.
The Pentagon Papers study was
ordered by former President
Lyndon Johnson shortly before
he left office. Parts of the Papers
bore a "Top Secret" classification,
and even members of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee
were unable to obtain copies of
the report.
Ellsberg and Russo hope to use
the impending trial as a platform
from which to air their antiwar
views before the national press. At
the same time, they apparently
are seeking a determination of the
legality of the Indochinese War, a
subject that courts have so far
refused to rule upon.
Legal Spin-Offs
There have been a phenominal
number of legal spin-offs as a
result of the publication of the
Pentagon Papers and the
accompanying litigation, and the
trial itself has been most unusual.
First, as a result of their
publication of segments of the
Papers, the Times and the Post
became embroiled in an extremely
important Supreme Court case.
The government attempted to
prevent the two papers (and

several others, such as the Globe - )
from publishing information from
the Papers on the grounds of
"national security." It succeeded
in obtaining injunctions against
both papers to prevent further
publication of any Pentagon
Papers material pending a detailed
legal review.
Prior Censorship
The newspapers believed that
the government's actions
amounted to prior censorship — a
tactic declared unconstitutional in
virtually every circumstance in a
1931 Supreme Court decision,
Near v. Minnesota — and quickly
fought the government all the way
to the Supreme Court.
In the meantime, other papers
all across the country were
publishing materials obviously
taken from the Papers.
The High Court briefly
considered the matter, and in a
6-3 decision with numerous
accompanying opinions — the
exact meaning of which legal
scholars and newspaper publishers
are still debating — lifted the
injunctions and allowed the
newspapers to continue publishing
material from the Papers.
Wiretap Argument
The second major piece of
ancillary litigation took place in
August, when the defendants
obtained a stay from Supreme
Court William O. Douglas so that
they could appeal a wiretap
question to the Supreme Court.
Although the matter has not
been explained in open court, the
government admitted that
someone connected with the
defense effort was overheard by a

government wiretap operation in a
non-domestic intelligence
investigation.
However, the Supreme Court
voted not to hear an appeal on the
issue, and the stay was lifted on
Nov. 13.
Scholar Jailed
Third, while the pre-trial
hearings — and the trial itself —
dragged on, two grand juries, one
in Boston and one in Los Angeles,
continued to investigate the
"leak" of the Papers. The grand
jury sitting in Los Angeles
returned the indictments against
Ellsberg and Russo, while the
Boston grand jury returned no
indictments in the one year and
four months it operated.
However, Samuel Popkin, a 30
year-old Harvard University
professor and expert on village life
in Vietnam, was jailed for six days
when he refused to answer certain
questions about sources of some
of his information before the
Boston grand jury.
He is the first scholar in recent
history — if ever — to be jailed for
refusing to cooperate with a grand
jury.
Popkin was released after
Harvard intervened with the
government in his behalf and
succeeded in convincing the
Justice Department to dismiss the
jury some eight weeks ahead of
schedule.
Jury Dismissal Asked
However, Popkin could be
called before another grand jury,
and should he again refuse to
answer questions, could face
another jail term of up to 18
months, the life of the grand jury.

Aside from the trial itself, the
fourth major piece of litigation to
arise from the Papers is the
defense's recent efforts to
discharge the present jury and
select a new one.
The jury now selected to hear

appointment to the bench.
Ellsberg Still Humorous
Through the seemingly
never-ending months of playing
"cat and mouse" with the
prosecutors, the denials of the
defense motions, the jury
selection, and the constant threat
of a 100-plus year jail sentence,
though, Ellsberg himself has not
lost his sense of humor.
Last Friday, as his attorneys
paced back and forth across the
courtroom waiting for Byrne's
ruling on their motion for a new
jury, Ellsberg casually told
reporters that he had "held a
second job at night — and it
wasn't connected with Rand"
during the 1969 antiwar
moratoria.
Ellsberg was reluctant to
specify excactly what that job
was, but it's a safe bet that one of
the prerequisite skills was a
thoroughgoing knowledge of
copying machines.
LOS ANGELES - Dr. Daniel
Ellsberg, once famous for his
intense, almost infectious grin,
isn't smiling too much these days
as he sits in a dark-paneled
courtroom waiting for the
resumption of his long-delayed
trial on charges of violating the
Espionage Act, conspiracy and
theft of government property.
Ellsberg's co-defendant,
Anthony J. Russo, less
well-known and less public with
his emotions, isn't doing that
much smiling, either.
And their battery of attorneys
looks positively downcast, even
when it wins a minor judicial
victory, as it did last Friday when
it succeeded in delaying the trial
for at least one more week until
Dec. 12.
In fact, no one srnles in the
courtroom where one of the most
complex trials in recent history is
about to resume. There simply is
no time, or occasion, to smile.
Copying The Papers
Ellsberg and Russo are charged
with making Xerox copies of the
Pentagon Papers (official title:
"History of U.S. Decision-Making
Process in Viet Nam") and
distributing them to various
newspapers, including the New
York Times, the Washington Post
and the Boston Globe.

Ellsberg has never denied that
he duplicated the papers and gave
them, at least indirectly, to the
newspapers and newspaper chains.
However, he contends that he has
done nothing illegal.
The Pentagon Papers study was
ordered by former President
Lyndon Johnson shortly before
he left office. Parts of the Papers
bore a "Top Secret" classification,
and even members of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee
were unable to obtain copies of
the report.
Ellsberg and Russo hope to use
the impending trial as a platform
from which to air their antiwar
views before the national press. At
the same time, they apparently
are seeking a determination of the
legality of the Indochinese War, a
subject that courts have so far
refused to rule upon.
Legal Spin-Offs
There have been a phenominal
number of legal spin-offs as a
result of the publication of the
Pentagon Papers and the
accompanying litigation, and the
trial itself has been most unusual.
First, as a result of their
publication of segments of the
Papers, the Times and the Post
became embroiled in an extremely
important Supreme Court case.
The government attempted to
prevent the two papers (and

several others, such as the Globe - )
from publishing information from
the Papers on the grounds of
"national security." It succeeded
in obtaining injunctions against
both papers to prevent further
publication of any Pentagon
Papers material pending a detailed
legal review.
Prior Censorship
The newspapers believed that
the government's actions
amounted to prior censorship — a
tactic declared unconstitutional in
virtually every circumstance in a
1931 Supreme Court decision,
Near v. Minnesota — and quickly
fought the government all the way
to the Supreme Court.
In the meantime, other papers
all across the country were
publishing materials obviously
taken from the Papers.
The High Court briefly
considered the matter, and in a
6-3 decision with numerous
accompanying opinions — the
exact meaning of which legal
scholars and newspaper publishers
are still debating — lifted the
injunctions and allowed the
newspapers to continue publishing
material from the Papers.
Wiretap Argument
The second major piece of
ancillary litigation took place in
August, when the defendants
obtained a stay from Supreme
Court William O. Douglas so that
they could appeal a wiretap
question to the Supreme Court.
Although the matter has not
been explained in open court, the
government admitted that
someone connected with the
defense effort was overheard by a

government wiretap operation in a
non-domestic intelligence
investigation.
However, the Supreme Court
voted not to hear an appeal on the
issue, and the stay was lifted on
Nov. 13.
Scholar Jailed
Third, while the pre-trial
hearings — and the trial itself —
dragged on, two grand juries, one
in Boston and one in Los Angeles,
continued to investigate the
"leak" of the Papers. The grand
jury sitting in Los Angeles
returned the indictments against
Ellsberg and Russo, while the
Boston grand jury returned no
indictments in the one year and
four months it operated.
However, Samuel Popkin, a 30
year-old Harvard University
professor and expert on village life
in Vietnam, was jailed for six days
when he refused to answer certain
questions about sources of some
of his information before the
Boston grand jury.
He is the first scholar in recent
history — if ever — to be jailed for
refusing to cooperate with a grand
jury.
Popkin was released after
Harvard intervened with the
government in his behalf and
succeeded in convincing the
Justice Department to dismiss the
jury some eight weeks ahead of
schedule.
Jury Dismissal Asked
However, Popkin could be
called before another grand jury,
and should he again refuse to
answer questions, could face
another jail term of up to 18
months, the life of the grand jury.

Aside from the trial itself, the
fourth major piece of litigation to
arise from the Papers is the
defense's recent efforts to
discharge the present jury and
select a new one.
The jury now selected to hear
the case was empaneled July 25.
Shortly thereafter, Justice
Douglas granted a stay to permit a
possible Supreme Court review of
the wiretap issue, and the trial was
recessed on Aug. 9. The jury did
not reassemble until last Friday,
Dec. 1.
At the time the jurors were
dismissed, Judge William Matthew
('Matt') Byrne told them that
they would be contacted and told
to appear during early October.
However, the Supreme Court did
not announce its decision until
mid-November.
'Unprecedented' Delay
Defense lawyers term the
four-month delay in the trial since
jury selection "unprecedented"
and have told the court that the

jurors probably have become
subconsciously prejudiced against
the defense because of the delay.
In addition, defense lawyers
believe that the jurors may have
become "sensitized" to issues
involving "national security"
because of the recent national
presidential election.
When he dismissed them on
Aug. 9, Judge Byrne instructed
the jurors to ignore any mention
of the case, the Papers, or the
defendants. Jurors' families were
to censor their newspapers for
them, and jurors were told to
leave the room if any of the
forbidden topics came up on radio
or television or in conversations.
However, 10 of the 18 jurors
and alternates told the court that
they had heard references to one
or more of the forbidden subjects
during the four-month lull. But
they told the court that they
could still sit as fair and impartial
jurors in the case.
Byme then dismissed a defense

motion for a new jury. That
decision is now being challenged
in the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals and may well go to the
Supreme Court.
Classic Confrontation
The personae in this
courtroom confrontation are at
least as outstanding as those
present during the Chicago Seven
conspiracy trial. Some of the
principals:
—Ellsberg, the quixotic former
Rand Corporation researcher, a
former member of the Marine
Corps, who has spent most of his
adult life studying the U.S.
involvement in Indochina.
—Russo, another former Rand
researcher, trained as an engineer
and a political scientist, a
longtime activist against the war.
—Leonard Boudin, Ellsberg's
chief counsel, an outstanding civil
liberties lawyer and an expert on
the grand jury process who
defended Dr. Benjamin Spock
against Selective Service
conspiracy charges.
—Leonard Weinglass, Russo's
chief counsel and one of the
defense attorneys for the 'Chicago
Seven.'
—Judge Byrne, a Democrat
who served as chief counsel to the
Scranton Commission
(Presidential Commission on
Campus Unrest) and the son of a
noted federal appeals court judge
who sits in the same Los Angeles
courthouse.
— David Nissen, the
government's chief prosecutor on
the case, sharp-tongued assistant
U.S. attorney and an expert on
perjury, who served as an assistant
to Byrne while Byrne headed the
prosecutor's office prior to his
appointment to the bench.
Ellsberg Still Humorous
Through the seemingly
never-ending months of playing
"cat and mouse" with the

material from the Papers.
Wiretap Argument
The second major piece of
ancillary litigation took place in
August, when the defendants
obtained a stay from Supreme
Court William O. Douglas so that
they could appeal a wiretap
question to the Supreme Court.
Although the matter has not
been explained in open court, the
government admitted that
someone connected with the
defense effort was overheard by a

government wiretap operation in a
non-domestic intelligence
investigation.
However, the Supreme Court
voted not to hear an appeal on the
issue, and the stay was lifted on
Nov. 13.
Scholar Jailed
Third, while the pre-trial
hearings — and the trial itself —
dragged on, two grand juries, one
in Boston and one in Los Angeles,
continued to investigate the
"leak" of the Papers. The grand
jury sitting in Los Angeles
returned the indictments against
Ellsberg and Russo, while the
Boston grand jury returned no
indictments in the one year and
four months it operated.
However, Samuel Popkin, a 30
year-old Harvard University
professor and expert on village life
in Vietnam, was jailed for six days
when he refused to answer certain
questions about sources of some
of his information before the
Boston grand jury.
He is the first scholar in recent
history — if ever — to be jailed for
refusing to cooperate with a grand
jury.
Popkin was released after
Harvard intervened with the
government in his behalf and
succeeded in convincing the
Justice Department to dismiss the
jury some eight weeks ahead of
schedule.
Jury Dismissal Asked
However, Popkin could be
called before another grand jury,
and should he again refuse to
answer questions, could face
another jail term of up to 18
months, the life of the grand jury.

Aside from the trial itself, the
fourth major piece of litigation to
arise from the Papers is the
defense's recent efforts to
discharge the present jury and
select a new one.
The jury now selected to hear
the case was empaneled July 25.
Shortly thereafter, Justice
Douglas granted a stay to permit a
possible Supreme Court review of
the wiretap issue, and the trial was
recessed on Aug. 9. The jury did
not reassemble until last Friday,
Dec. 1.
At the time the jurors were
dismissed, Judge William Matthew
('Matt') Byrne told them that
they would be contacted and told
to appear during early October.
However, the Supreme Court did
not announce its decision until
mid-November.
'Unprecedented' Delay
Defense lawyers term the
four-month delay in the trial since
jury selection "unprecedented"
and have told the court that the

jurors probably have become
subconsciously prejudiced against
the defense because of the delay.
In addition, defense lawyers
believe that the jurors may have
become "sensitized" to issues
involving "national security"
because of the recent national
presidential election.
When he dismissed them on
Aug. 9, Judge Byrne instructed
the jurors to ignore any mention
of the case, the Papers, or the
defendants. Jurors' families were
to censor their newspapers for
them, and jurors were told to
leave the room if any of the
forbidden topics came up on radio
or television or in conversations.
However, 10 of the 18 jurors
and alternates told the court that
they had heard references to one
or more of the forbidden subjects
during the four-month lull. But
they told the court that they
could still sit as fair and impartial
jurors in the case.
Byme then dismissed a defense

motion for a new jury. That
decision is now being challenged
in the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals and may well go to the
Supreme Court.
Classic Confrontation
The personae in this
courtroom confrontation are at
least as outstanding as those
present during the Chicago Seven
conspiracy trial. Some of the
principals:
—Ellsberg, the quixotic former
Rand Corporation researcher, a
former member of the Marine
Corps, who has spent most of his
adult life studying the U.S.
involvement in Indochina.
—Russo, another former Rand
researcher, trained as an engineer
and a political scientist, a
longtime activist against the war.
—Leonard Boudin, Ellsberg's
chief counsel, an outstanding civil
liberties lawyer and an expert on
the grand jury process who
defended Dr. Benjamin Spock
against Selective Service
conspiracy charges.
—Leonard Weinglass, Russo's
chief counsel and one of the
defense attorneys for the 'Chicago
Seven.'
—Judge Byrne, a Democrat
who served as chief counsel to the
Scranton Commission
(Presidential Commission on
Campus Unrest) and the son of a
noted federal appeals court judge
who sits in the same Los Angeles
courthouse.
— David Nissen, the
government's chief prosecutor on
the case, sharp-tongued assistant
U.S. attorney and an expert on
perjury, who served as an assistant
to Byrne while Byrne headed the
prosecutor's office prior to his
appointment to the bench.
Ellsberg Still Humorous
Through the seemingly
never-ending months of playing
"cat and mouse" with the
prosecutors, the denials of the
defense motions, the jury
selection, and the constant threat
of a 100-plus year jail sentence,
though, Ellsberg himself has not
lost his sense of humor.
Last Friday, as his attorneys
paced back and forth across the
courtroom waiting for Byrne's
ruling on their motion for a new
jury, Ellsberg casually told
reporters that he had "held a
second job at night — and it
wasn't connected with Rand"
during the 1969 antiwar
moratoria.
Ellsberg was reluctant to
specify excactly what that job
was, but it's a safe bet that one of
the prerequisite skills was a
thoroughgoing knowledge of
copying machines.
LOS ANGELES - Dr. Daniel
Ellsberg, once famous for his
intense, almost infectious grin,
isn't smiling too much these days
as he sits in a dark-paneled
courtroom waiting for the
resumption of his long-delayed
trial on charges of violating the
Espionage Act, conspiracy and
theft of government property.
Ellsberg's co-defendant,
Anthony J. Russo, less
well-known and less public with
his emotions, isn't doing that
much smiling, either.
And their battery of attorneys
looks positively downcast, even
when it wins a minor judicial
victory, as it did last Friday when
it succeeded in delaying the trial
for at least one more week until
Dec. 12.
In fact, no one srnles in the
courtroom where one of the most
complex trials in recent history is
about to resume. There simply is
no time, or occasion, to smile.
Copying The Papers
Ellsberg and Russo are charged
with making Xerox copies of the
Pentagon Papers (official title:
"History of U.S. Decision-Making
Process in Viet Nam") and
distributing them to various
newspapers, including the New
York Times, the Washington Post
and the Boston Globe.

Ellsberg has never denied that
he duplicated the papers and gave
them, at least indirectly, to the
newspapers and newspaper chains.
However, he contends that he has
done nothing illegal.
The Pentagon Papers study was
ordered by former President
Lyndon Johnson shortly before
he left office. Parts of the Papers
bore a "Top Secret" classification,
and even members of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee
were unable to obtain copies of
the report.
Ellsberg and Russo hope to use
the impending trial as a platform
from which to air their antiwar
views before the national press. At
the same time, they apparently
are seeking a determination of the
legality of the Indochinese War, a
subject that courts have so far
refused to rule upon.
Legal Spin-Offs
There have been a phenominal
number of legal spin-offs as a
result of the publication of the
Pentagon Papers and the
accompanying litigation, and the
trial itself has been most unusual.
First, as a result of their
publication of segments of the
Papers, the Times and the Post
became embroiled in an extremely
important Supreme Court case.
The government attempted to
prevent the two papers (and

several others, such as the Globe - )
from publishing information from
the Papers on the grounds of
"national security." It succeeded
in obtaining injunctions against
both papers to prevent further
publication of any Pentagon
Papers material pending a detailed
legal review.
Prior Censorship
The newspapers believed that
the government's actions
amounted to prior censorship — a
tactic declared unconstitutional in
virtually every circumstance in a
1931 Supreme Court decision,
Near v. Minnesota — and quickly
fought the government all the way
to the Supreme Court.
In the meantime, other papers
all across the country were
publishing materials obviously
taken from the Papers.
The High Court briefly
considered the matter, and in a
6-3 decision with numerous
accompanying opinions — the
exact meaning of which legal
scholars and newspaper publishers
are still debating — lifted the
injunctions and allowed the
newspapers to continue publishing
material from the Papers.
Wiretap Argument
The second major piece of
ancillary litigation took place in
August, when the defendants
obtained a stay from Supreme
Court William O. Douglas so that
they could appeal a wiretap
question to the Supreme Court.
Although the matter has not
been explained in open court, the
government admitted that
someone connected with the
defense effort was overheard by a

government wiretap operation in a
non-domestic intelligence
investigation.
However, the Supreme Court
voted not to hear an appeal on the
issue, and the stay was lifted on
Nov. 13.

when he refused to answer certain
questions about sources of some

Boston grand jury.
He is the first scholar in recent
history — if ever — to be jailed for
refusing to cooperate with a grand
jury.
Popkin was released after
Harvard intervened with the
government in his behalf and
succeeded in convincing the
Justice Department to dismiss the
jury some eight weeks ahead of
schedule.
Jury Dismissal Asked
However, Popkin could be
called before another grand jury,
and should he again refuse to
answer questions, could face
another jail term of up to 18
months, the life of the grand jury.

Aside from the trial itself, the
fourth major piece of litigation to
arise from the Papers is the
defense's recent efforts to
discharge the present jury and
select a new one.

and a political scientist, a
longtime activist against the war.
—Leonard Boudin, Ellsberg's
chief counsel, an outstanding civil
liberties lawyer and an expert on
the grand jury process who
defended Dr. Benjamin Spock
against Selective Service
conspiracy charges.
—Leonard Weinglass, Russo's
chief counsel and one of the
defense attorneys for the 'Chicago
Seven.'
—Judge Byrne, a Democrat
who served as chief counsel to the
Scranton Commission
(Presidential Commission on
Campus Unrest) and the son of a
noted federal appeals court judge
who sits in the same Los Angeles
courthouse.
— David Nissen, the
government's chief prosecutor on
the case, sharp-tongued assistant
U.S. attorney and an expert on
perjury, who served as an assistant
to Byrne while Byrne headed the
prosecutor's office prior to his
appointment to the bench.
Ellsberg Still Humorous
Through the seemingly
never-ending months of playing
"cat and mouse" with the
prosecutors, the denials of the
defense motions, the jury
selection, and the constant threat
of a 100-plus year jail sentence,
though, Ellsberg himself has not
lost his sense of humor.
Last Friday, as his attorneys
paced back and forth across the
courtroom waiting for Byrne's
ruling on their motion for a new
jury, Ellsberg casually told
reporters that he had "held a
second job at night — and it
wasn't connected with Rand"
during the 1969 antiwar
moratoria.
Ellsberg was reluctant to
specify excactly what that job
was, but it's a safe bet that one of
the prerequisite skills was a
thoroughgoing knowledge of
copying machines.
