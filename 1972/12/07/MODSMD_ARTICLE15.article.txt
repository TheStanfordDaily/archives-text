# University, City Slate Discussions

### 
The University Committee on Land and Building Development
will discuss possible annexation to Palo Alto of the Stanford
Avenue-Bowdoin Street intersection at a public meeting Monday.
The Committee, chaired by Communication Prof. Lyle
Nelson, will meet from 3 to 5 p.m. in the Meyer Library Forum
Room.
The Palo Alto City Council has invited Stanford to offer a
triangular plot of land at that intersection to be annexed to the
city. Reconstruction of the intersection would discourage
through traffic from using Stanford Avenue or streets in the
adjacent College Terrace subdivision.
Interst in the project is several years old, but was revived
recently during discussion of the impact on traffic volume of the
proposed Frenchman's Terrace housing project.
The Palo Alto City Council will begin consideration of
annexation of the site of the Frenchman's Terrace development
on Dec. 18.
On Nov. 13, the Council gave final approval to a zoning
ordinance for the Stanford-owned site on which a 225-unit
low/moderate-income housing project is proposed.
The Council meets at 7:30 p.m. in the Civic Center, 250
Hamilton Ave. The meeting is open to the public.
