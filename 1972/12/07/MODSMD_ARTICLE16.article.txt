# Experts Optimistic On U.S.-Soviet Relations
## 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
The prognosis for
Soviet-American relations in the
1970's seems to be "guardedly
optimistic," according to the
scholars who addressed Stanford's
conference on "Soviet Foreign
Policy in the Seventies" last
Friday and Saturday.
Some 200 scholars from
throughout the nation heard five
experts on Soviet foreign policy
discuss the chances for improving
international relations during the
rest of the decade.
The five major speakers were
Prof. Vernon V. Aspaturian of

Pennsylvania State University;
Prof. Herbert S. Dinerstein of
Johns Hopkins University; Jack F.
Matlock, director of the Office of
Soviet Union Affairs of the U.S.
State Department; Dr. Wolfgang
K.H. Panofsky, directory of the
Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center (SLAC) and a former
negotiator for the U.S. Arms
Control and Disarmament
Agency; and Prof. William
Zimmerman of the University of
Michigan.
One scheduled speaker, Deputy
Asst. Sec. of State Richard T.
Davies, bowed out at the last

minute, and was replaced by
Matlock.
Stanford Political Science Prof.
Jan Triska chaired the conference,
which was sponsored by the
Stanford Center for Russian and
East European Studies.
Optimistic Predictions
Prof. Aspaturian offered
perhaps the most optimistic
perspective of the conference in
his opening address on "The
Soviet Union, The United States
and China in the Seventies."
Aspaturian called for "a new
world order .. . founded on a new
trans-ideological consensus in
which different social and
ideological systems could interact,
cooperate, and become mutually
supportive rather than function in
an adversarial and even
competitive manner.
"As long as differing social
systems remain anxious about
their ability to compete
successfully, the prospect of
failure contributes to insecurity."
World Policeman
According to Aspaturian, the
Soviet Union and the United
States will both substantially
modify their previous foreign
policies. The U.S., he said, is
retreating from its role of
international policeman, and the
Soviet Union is not likely to
attempt to move into the area
being vacated by the U.S.
"The U.S. has implicitly
recognized its failure to impose its
version of justice and order upon
the international system, and the

Soviet leaders are probably aware
that there is very little likelihood
of imposing a Soviet version of
international order upon the
world," he asserted.
Any such Russian attempt, he
said, would be "costly, risky, and
ultimately futile."
Five Other Nations
As both the U.S. and U.S.S.R.
abandon what Aspaturian termed
their "messianic impulses in
foreign policy," five other nations
— China, France, West Germany,
Japan, and Great Britain — will
develop more aggressive and
ambitious foreign policies, which
the Penn State scholar says will
provide a more balanced
international order.
To improve Soviet-American
relations, Aspaturian advocated a
policy for America of "not
challenging the [Soviet] system
but assisting in its efficient
operation ... subsidizing the
Soviet social order (and by
implication* the Chinese system as
well) by providing help in such a
way as to minimize the defects
and malfunctioning of
Communism."
This, he said, would eventually
"open up" the Soviet system to
more outside influences.
Not all of Aspaturian's
audience agreed with him. One
listener, noting that conference
chairman Triska had called
Aspaturian's address "broad and
imaginative," said that he could
only vouch for the latter
adjective. Aspaturian conceded
that his paper was "purely
speculative, and not meant to be
predictive."
Revolution
Prof. Dinerstein, an author and
Johns Hopkins faculty member,
told the group that the Soviet
Union has virtually abandoned the
hope that the Russian Revolution
would serve as the model for a
series of international socialist
revolutions.
In his talk, "The Soviet Union
and the Communist World," he
stated that Soviet leaders "are at
the point, or almost at the point,
of realizing that there is no
paradigm of revolution . . . there
will be no universal system of
states modeled on the Soviet
Union."
The major reason for this, he
said, is because "the proletariat is

only revolutionary on special
occasions.
Proletariat
"When the proletariat has a
stake in society, the difference
between what they have and what
they might get has to be very
considerable for them to risk their
lives and possessions .. . the
proletariat supports the system
that rewards him, be it socialist or
non-socialist," he said.
According to Dinerstein, the
working class — in both socialist
and non-socialist nations — is
generally "patriotic, conservative
in life style, and resentful of
intellectuals who challenge the
system."
As an example, he cited the
situation in Czechoslovakia during
the ill-fated liberalization of
deposed leader Alexander
Dubcek. "The Czech proletariat
was largely opposed to Dubcek
until the Soviet intervention made
being Czech more important than
being a worker."
Castro's Cuba
Another revolutionary model
that the Soviets at one time held
in high esteeem was the takeover
by Fidel Castro in Cuba. Noting
that Castro had seized power
before publicly proclaiming
himself a Communist, Dinerstein
said, "a country had become a
socialist state with the Communist
Party playing only a minor role.
The socialist revolution occurred
after power had been taken and
consolidated .... In a sense, Cuba
is a case of a communist
revolution without Communists."
But the Soviets have soured on
even this model, he asserted
"Just as the United States has
been saddled with the support of
any leader who proclaims himself
anti-Communist, so the Soviet
Union is constrained to accept
any one who proclaims himself or
his state Communist. But the
Soviet leaders will not
automatically and cheerfully
accept any new responsibility
foisted on them."
Keeping Socialists Socialist
Overall, said Dinerstein, the
Soviets will approach the issue of
international revolution "warily,"
and will be more interested in
"keeping existing socialist states
socialist — a hard enough task —
rather than in looking for new
socialist revolutions which are

more and more viewed as burdens
rather than opportunities."
According to Jack Matlock, a
veteran of several negotiations
with the Soviets, the current
detente between America and the
U.S.S.R. appears to go much
further than have previous periods
of improved relations.
While cautioning that "there is
no basis for euphoria," Matlock
said that the increased number of
agreements signed by the two
nations, and the recent economic
deals that are sending U.S. surplus
wheat to Russia and Russian
natural gas to the United States,
seem to indicate that the Soviet
Union is serious about carriving at
a lasting detente with the United
States.
Late Addition
Matlock's appearance was
added as an evening session when
Davies cancelled. As a result, only
about 100 persons came to
Tresidder Memorial Union's Large
Lounge for the speech.
During a question-and-answer
session, the negotiator said the
Soviets were seeking better
relations for a number of reasons,
including the emergence of China
as a major power and the need for
U.S. technology and economic
benefits.
He also denied that the United
States would become too
dependent on Russian natural gas,
saying that the deal would involve
only about one percent of the
total American consumption.
SALT Goals
Dr. Panofsky, a former
government arms control
negotiator who now heads the
federally-financed Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center (SLAC),
described the three major goals of
the second round of the Strategic
Arms Limitation Talks (SALT) as:
—limiting the number of all
strategic weapons, including
airplanes (omitted during the
first round of SALT);
— limiting technological
improvements on existing missiles;
—and reducing the current
"overkill" capacity of strategic
weapons.
Panofsky said that chances

were good that the first tvo goals
would be attained, but expressed
doubt that the third could be
accomplished.
As a result of SALT-I, he said,
both the United States and the
Soviet Union "acknowledge the
fact that a 'mutual hostage'
picture is the only one technically
available."
Soviet Reluctance
One reason the Soviets may be
reluctant to place too stringent
curbs on nuclear missies is that
they have not yet had the
opportunity to test and deploy
multiple independent re-entry
vehicles (MIRVs), while the
United States has.
"It is difficult to predict how
the Soviets will resolve the
conflict, which may have deep
ideological roots, between
achieving parity with the U.S. in
MIRV technology and enhancing
the security of their land-based
forces," Panofsky said.
"There's little doubt that
SALT-I has increased the security
of both the Soviet Union and the
U.S., even in a strictly military
sense. This is a welcome reversal
of the post-war trend of increasing
costs for strategic weapons,
accompanied by decreasing
security for all sides."
'Critical Test'
Yet, he declared, "the
burdensome military costs have
not as yet been reduced, and the
arms race has been deflected, not
arrested." SALT-II will be the
"critical test" to see if the two
countries can avoid "the race to
oblivion."
Prof. Zimmerman, who
concluded the conference,
predicted that the Soviet Union
may well draw closer to the
United States than to China
during the rest of the decade.
"One can imagine a major
Soviet rapprochement with the
U.S., looking toward a possible
coaltiion agianst China in the
'80's, or a major limited war
between the U.S.S.R. and China
in the '70's, perhaps more easily
than imagine a Soviet-Chinese
collaboration ... at the expense
of the U. 5.," he said.

and China in the Seventies."
Aspaturian called for "a new
world order .. . founded on a new
trans-ideological consensus in
which different social and
ideological systems could interact,
cooperate, and become mutually
supportive rather than function in
an adversarial and even
competitive manner.
"As long as differing social
systems remain anxious about
their ability to compete
successfully, the prospect of
failure contributes to insecurity."
World Policeman
According to Aspaturian, the
Soviet Union and the United
States will both substantially
modify their previous foreign
policies. The U.S., he said, is
retreating from its role of
international policeman, and the
Soviet Union is not likely to
attempt to move into the area
being vacated by the U.S.
"The U.S. has implicitly
recognized its failure to impose its
version of justice and order upon
the international system, and the

Soviet leaders are probably aware
that there is very little likelihood
of imposing a Soviet version of
international order upon the
world," he asserted.
Any such Russian attempt, he
said, would be "costly, risky, and
ultimately futile."
Five Other Nations
As both the U.S. and U.S.S.R.
abandon what Aspaturian termed
their "messianic impulses in
foreign policy," five other nations
— China, France, West Germany,
Japan, and Great Britain — will
develop more aggressive and
ambitious foreign policies, which
the Penn State scholar says will
provide a more balanced
international order.
To improve Soviet-American
relations, Aspaturian advocated a
policy for America of "not
challenging the [Soviet] system
but assisting in its efficient
operation ... subsidizing the
Soviet social order (and by
implication* the Chinese system as
well) by providing help in such a
way as to minimize the defects
and malfunctioning of
Communism."
This, he said, would eventually
"open up" the Soviet system to
more outside influences.
Not all of Aspaturian's
audience agreed with him. One
listener, noting that conference
chairman Triska had called
Aspaturian's address "broad and
imaginative," said that he could
only vouch for the latter
adjective. Aspaturian conceded
that his paper was "purely
speculative, and not meant to be
predictive."
Revolution
Prof. Dinerstein, an author and
Johns Hopkins faculty member,
told the group that the Soviet
Union has virtually abandoned the
hope that the Russian Revolution
would serve as the model for a
series of international socialist
revolutions.
In his talk, "The Soviet Union
and the Communist World," he
stated that Soviet leaders "are at
the point, or almost at the point,
of realizing that there is no
paradigm of revolution . . . there
will be no universal system of
states modeled on the Soviet
Union."
The major reason for this, he
said, is because "the proletariat is

only revolutionary on special
occasions.
Proletariat
"When the proletariat has a
stake in society, the difference
between what they have and what
they might get has to be very
considerable for them to risk their
lives and possessions .. . the
proletariat supports the system
that rewards him, be it socialist or
non-socialist," he said.
According to Dinerstein, the
working class — in both socialist
and non-socialist nations — is
generally "patriotic, conservative
in life style, and resentful of
intellectuals who challenge the
system."
As an example, he cited the
situation in Czechoslovakia during
the ill-fated liberalization of
deposed leader Alexander
Dubcek. "The Czech proletariat
was largely opposed to Dubcek
until the Soviet intervention made
being Czech more important than
being a worker."
Castro's Cuba
Another revolutionary model
that the Soviets at one time held
in high esteeem was the takeover
by Fidel Castro in Cuba. Noting
that Castro had seized power
before publicly proclaiming
himself a Communist, Dinerstein
said, "a country had become a
socialist state with the Communist
Party playing only a minor role.
The socialist revolution occurred
after power had been taken and
consolidated .... In a sense, Cuba
is a case of a communist
revolution without Communists."
But the Soviets have soured on
even this model, he asserted
"Just as the United States has
been saddled with the support of
any leader who proclaims himself
anti-Communist, so the Soviet
Union is constrained to accept
any one who proclaims himself or
his state Communist. But the
Soviet leaders will not
automatically and cheerfully
accept any new responsibility
foisted on them."
Keeping Socialists Socialist
Overall, said Dinerstein, the
Soviets will approach the issue of
international revolution "warily,"
and will be more interested in
"keeping existing socialist states
socialist — a hard enough task —
rather than in looking for new
socialist revolutions which are

more and more viewed as burdens
rather than opportunities."
According to Jack Matlock, a
veteran of several negotiations
with the Soviets, the current
detente between America and the
U.S.S.R. appears to go much
further than have previous periods
of improved relations.
While cautioning that "there is
no basis for euphoria," Matlock
said that the increased number of
agreements signed by the two
nations, and the recent economic
deals that are sending U.S. surplus
wheat to Russia and Russian
natural gas to the United States,
seem to indicate that the Soviet
Union is serious about carriving at
a lasting detente with the United
States.
Late Addition
Matlock's appearance was
added as an evening session when
Davies cancelled. As a result, only
about 100 persons came to
Tresidder Memorial Union's Large
Lounge for the speech.
During a question-and-answer
session, the negotiator said the
Soviets were seeking better
relations for a number of reasons,
including the emergence of China
as a major power and the need for
U.S. technology and economic
benefits.
He also denied that the United
States would become too
dependent on Russian natural gas,
saying that the deal would involve
only about one percent of the
total American consumption.
SALT Goals
Dr. Panofsky, a former
government arms control
negotiator who now heads the
federally-financed Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center (SLAC),
described the three major goals of
the second round of the Strategic
Arms Limitation Talks (SALT) as:
—limiting the number of all
strategic weapons, including
airplanes (omitted during the
first round of SALT);
— limiting technological
improvements on existing missiles;
—and reducing the current
"overkill" capacity of strategic
weapons.
Panofsky said that chances

were good that the first tvo goals
would be attained, but expressed
doubt that the third could be
accomplished.
As a result of SALT-I, he said,
both the United States and the
Soviet Union "acknowledge the
fact that a 'mutual hostage'
picture is the only one technically
available."
Soviet Reluctance
One reason the Soviets may be
reluctant to place too stringent
curbs on nuclear missies is that
they have not yet had the
opportunity to test and deploy
multiple independent re-entry
vehicles (MIRVs), while the
United States has.
"It is difficult to predict how
the Soviets will resolve the
conflict, which may have deep
ideological roots, between
achieving parity with the U.S. in
MIRV technology and enhancing
the security of their land-based
forces," Panofsky said.
"There's little doubt that
SALT-I has increased the security
of both the Soviet Union and the
U.S., even in a strictly military
sense. This is a welcome reversal
of the post-war trend of increasing
costs for strategic weapons,
accompanied by decreasing
security for all sides."
'Critical Test'
Yet, he declared, "the
burdensome military costs have
not as yet been reduced, and the
arms race has been deflected, not
arrested." SALT-II will be the
"critical test" to see if the two
countries can avoid "the race to
oblivion."
Prof. Zimmerman, who
concluded the conference,
predicted that the Soviet Union
may well draw closer to the
United States than to China
during the rest of the decade.
"One can imagine a major
Soviet rapprochement with the
U.S., looking toward a possible
coaltiion agianst China in the
'80's, or a major limited war
between the U.S.S.R. and China
in the '70's, perhaps more easily
than imagine a Soviet-Chinese
collaboration ... at the expense
of the U. 5.," he said.

The prognosis for
Soviet-American relations in the
1970's seems to be "guardedly
optimistic," according to the
scholars who addressed Stanford's
conference on "Soviet Foreign
Policy in the Seventies" last
Friday and Saturday.
Some 200 scholars from
throughout the nation heard five
experts on Soviet foreign policy
discuss the chances for improving
international relations during the
rest of the decade.
The five major speakers were
Prof. Vernon V. Aspaturian of

Pennsylvania State University;
Prof. Herbert S. Dinerstein of
Johns Hopkins University; Jack F.
Matlock, director of the Office of
Soviet Union Affairs of the U.S.
State Department; Dr. Wolfgang
K.H. Panofsky, directory of the
Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center (SLAC) and a former
negotiator for the U.S. Arms
Control and Disarmament
Agency; and Prof. William
Zimmerman of the University of
Michigan.
One scheduled speaker, Deputy
Asst. Sec. of State Richard T.
Davies, bowed out at the last

minute, and was replaced by
Matlock.
Stanford Political Science Prof.
Jan Triska chaired the conference,
which was sponsored by the
Stanford Center for Russian and

the Penn State scholar says will
provide a more balanced
international order.
To improve Soviet-American
relations, Aspaturian advocated a
policy for America of "not
challenging the [Soviet] system
but assisting in its efficient
operation ... subsidizing the
Soviet social order (and by
implication* the Chinese system as
well) by providing help in such a
way as to minimize the defects
and malfunctioning of
Communism."
This, he said, would eventually
"open up" the Soviet system to
more outside influences.
Not all of Aspaturian's
audience agreed with him. One
listener, noting that conference
chairman Triska had called
Aspaturian's address "broad and
imaginative," said that he could
only vouch for the latter
adjective. Aspaturian conceded
that his paper was "purely
speculative, and not meant to be
predictive."
Revolution
Prof. Dinerstein, an author and
Johns Hopkins faculty member,
told the group that the Soviet
Union has virtually abandoned the
hope that the Russian Revolution
would serve as the model for a
series of international socialist
revolutions.
In his talk, "The Soviet Union
and the Communist World," he
stated that Soviet leaders "are at
the point, or almost at the point,
of realizing that there is no
paradigm of revolution . . . there
will be no universal system of
states modeled on the Soviet
Union."
The major reason for this, he
said, is because "the proletariat is

only revolutionary on special
occasions.
Proletariat
"When the proletariat has a
stake in society, the difference
between what they have and what
they might get has to be very
considerable for them to risk their
lives and possessions .. . the
proletariat supports the system
that rewards him, be it socialist or
non-socialist," he said.
According to Dinerstein, the
working class — in both socialist
and non-socialist nations — is
generally "patriotic, conservative
in life style, and resentful of
intellectuals who challenge the
system."
As an example, he cited the
situation in Czechoslovakia during
the ill-fated liberalization of
deposed leader Alexander
Dubcek. "The Czech proletariat
was largely opposed to Dubcek
until the Soviet intervention made
being Czech more important than
being a worker."
Castro's Cuba
Another revolutionary model
that the Soviets at one time held
in high esteeem was the takeover
by Fidel Castro in Cuba. Noting
that Castro had seized power
before publicly proclaiming
himself a Communist, Dinerstein
said, "a country had become a
socialist state with the Communist
Party playing only a minor role.
The socialist revolution occurred
after power had been taken and
consolidated .... In a sense, Cuba
is a case of a communist
revolution without Communists."
But the Soviets have soured on
even this model, he asserted
"Just as the United States has
been saddled with the support of
any leader who proclaims himself
anti-Communist, so the Soviet
Union is constrained to accept
any one who proclaims himself or
his state Communist. But the
Soviet leaders will not
automatically and cheerfully
accept any new responsibility
foisted on them."
Keeping Socialists Socialist
Overall, said Dinerstein, the
Soviets will approach the issue of
international revolution "warily,"
and will be more interested in
"keeping existing socialist states
socialist — a hard enough task —
rather than in looking for new
socialist revolutions which are

more and more viewed as burdens
rather than opportunities."
According to Jack Matlock, a
veteran of several negotiations
with the Soviets, the current
detente between America and the
U.S.S.R. appears to go much
further than have previous periods
of improved relations.
While cautioning that "there is
no basis for euphoria," Matlock
said that the increased number of
agreements signed by the two
nations, and the recent economic
deals that are sending U.S. surplus
wheat to Russia and Russian
natural gas to the United States,
seem to indicate that the Soviet
Union is serious about carriving at
a lasting detente with the United
States.
Late Addition
Matlock's appearance was
added as an evening session when
Davies cancelled. As a result, only
about 100 persons came to
Tresidder Memorial Union's Large
Lounge for the speech.
During a question-and-answer
session, the negotiator said the
Soviets were seeking better
relations for a number of reasons,
including the emergence of China
as a major power and the need for
U.S. technology and economic
benefits.
He also denied that the United
States would become too
dependent on Russian natural gas,
saying that the deal would involve
only about one percent of the
total American consumption.
SALT Goals
Dr. Panofsky, a former
government arms control
negotiator who now heads the
federally-financed Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center (SLAC),
described the three major goals of
the second round of the Strategic
Arms Limitation Talks (SALT) as:
—limiting the number of all
strategic weapons, including
airplanes (omitted during the
first round of SALT);
— limiting technological
improvements on existing missiles;
—and reducing the current
"overkill" capacity of strategic
weapons.
Panofsky said that chances

were good that the first tvo goals
would be attained, but expressed
doubt that the third could be
accomplished.
As a result of SALT-I, he said,
both the United States and the
Soviet Union "acknowledge the
fact that a 'mutual hostage'
picture is the only one technically
available."
Soviet Reluctance
One reason the Soviets may be
reluctant to place too stringent
curbs on nuclear missies is that
they have not yet had the
opportunity to test and deploy
multiple independent re-entry
vehicles (MIRVs), while the
United States has.
"It is difficult to predict how
the Soviets will resolve the
conflict, which may have deep
ideological roots, between
achieving parity with the U.S. in
MIRV technology and enhancing
the security of their land-based
forces," Panofsky said.
"There's little doubt that
SALT-I has increased the security
of both the Soviet Union and the
U.S., even in a strictly military
sense. This is a welcome reversal
of the post-war trend of increasing
costs for strategic weapons,
accompanied by decreasing
security for all sides."
'Critical Test'
Yet, he declared, "the
burdensome military costs have
not as yet been reduced, and the
arms race has been deflected, not
arrested." SALT-II will be the
"critical test" to see if the two
countries can avoid "the race to
oblivion."
Prof. Zimmerman, who
concluded the conference,
predicted that the Soviet Union
may well draw closer to the
United States than to China
during the rest of the decade.
"One can imagine a major
Soviet rapprochement with the
U.S., looking toward a possible
coaltiion agianst China in the
'80's, or a major limited war
between the U.S.S.R. and China
in the '70's, perhaps more easily
than imagine a Soviet-Chinese
collaboration ... at the expense
of the U. 5.," he said.

DR. WOLFGANG K.H. PANOFSKY
The prognosis for
Soviet-American relations in the
1970's seems to be "guardedly
optimistic," according to the
scholars who addressed Stanford's
conference on "Soviet Foreign
Policy in the Seventies" last
Friday and Saturday.
Some 200 scholars from
throughout the nation heard five
experts on Soviet foreign policy
discuss the chances for improving
international relations during the
rest of the decade.
The five major speakers were
Prof. Vernon V. Aspaturian of

Pennsylvania State University;
Prof. Herbert S. Dinerstein of
Johns Hopkins University; Jack F.
Matlock, director of the Office of
Soviet Union Affairs of the U.S.
State Department; Dr. Wolfgang
K.H. Panofsky, directory of the
Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center (SLAC) and a former
negotiator for the U.S. Arms
Control and Disarmament
Agency; and Prof. William
Zimmerman of the University of
Michigan.
One scheduled speaker, Deputy
Asst. Sec. of State Richard T.
Davies, bowed out at the last

minute, and was replaced by
Matlock.
Stanford Political Science Prof.
Jan Triska chaired the conference,
which was sponsored by the
Stanford Center for Russian and
East European Studies.
Optimistic Predictions
Prof. Aspaturian offered
perhaps the most optimistic
perspective of the conference in
his opening address on "The
Soviet Union, The United States
and China in the Seventies."
Aspaturian called for "a new
world order .. . founded on a new
trans-ideological consensus in
which different social and
ideological systems could interact,
cooperate, and become mutually
supportive rather than function in
an adversarial and even
competitive manner.
"As long as differing social
systems remain anxious about
their ability to compete
successfully, the prospect of
failure contributes to insecurity."
World Policeman
According to Aspaturian, the
Soviet Union and the United
States will both substantially
modify their previous foreign
policies. The U.S., he said, is
retreating from its role of
international policeman, and the
Soviet Union is not likely to
attempt to move into the area
being vacated by the U.S.
"The U.S. has implicitly
recognized its failure to impose its
version of justice and order upon
the international system, and the

Soviet leaders are probably aware
that there is very little likelihood
of imposing a Soviet version of
international order upon the
world," he asserted.
Any such Russian attempt, he
said, would be "costly, risky, and
ultimately futile."
Five Other Nations
As both the U.S. and U.S.S.R.
abandon what Aspaturian termed
their "messianic impulses in
foreign policy," five other nations
— China, France, West Germany,
Japan, and Great Britain — will
develop more aggressive and
ambitious foreign policies, which
the Penn State scholar says will
provide a more balanced
international order.
To improve Soviet-American
relations, Aspaturian advocated a
policy for America of "not
challenging the [Soviet] system
but assisting in its efficient
operation ... subsidizing the
Soviet social order (and by
implication* the Chinese system as
well) by providing help in such a

said, is because "the proletariat is

only revolutionary on special
occasions.
Proletariat
"When the proletariat has a
stake in society, the difference
between what they have and what
they might get has to be very
considerable for them to risk their
lives and possessions .. . the
proletariat supports the system
that rewards him, be it socialist or
non-socialist," he said.
According to Dinerstein, the
working class — in both socialist
and non-socialist nations — is
generally "patriotic, conservative
in life style, and resentful of
intellectuals who challenge the
system."
As an example, he cited the
situation in Czechoslovakia during
the ill-fated liberalization of
deposed leader Alexander
Dubcek. "The Czech proletariat
was largely opposed to Dubcek
until the Soviet intervention made
being Czech more important than
being a worker."
Castro's Cuba
Another revolutionary model
that the Soviets at one time held
in high esteeem was the takeover
by Fidel Castro in Cuba. Noting
that Castro had seized power
before publicly proclaiming
himself a Communist, Dinerstein
said, "a country had become a
socialist state with the Communist
Party playing only a minor role.
The socialist revolution occurred
after power had been taken and
consolidated .... In a sense, Cuba
is a case of a communist
revolution without Communists."
But the Soviets have soured on
even this model, he asserted
"Just as the United States has
been saddled with the support of
any leader who proclaims himself
anti-Communist, so the Soviet
Union is constrained to accept
any one who proclaims himself or
his state Communist. But the
Soviet leaders will not
automatically and cheerfully
accept any new responsibility
foisted on them."
Keeping Socialists Socialist
Overall, said Dinerstein, the
Soviets will approach the issue of
international revolution "warily,"
and will be more interested in
"keeping existing socialist states
socialist — a hard enough task —
rather than in looking for new
socialist revolutions which are

more and more viewed as burdens
rather than opportunities."
According to Jack Matlock, a
veteran of several negotiations
with the Soviets, the current
detente between America and the
U.S.S.R. appears to go much
further than have previous periods
of improved relations.
While cautioning that "there is
no basis for euphoria," Matlock
said that the increased number of
agreements signed by the two
nations, and the recent economic
deals that are sending U.S. surplus
wheat to Russia and Russian
natural gas to the United States,
seem to indicate that the Soviet
Union is serious about carriving at
a lasting detente with the United
States.
Late Addition
Matlock's appearance was
added as an evening session when
Davies cancelled. As a result, only
about 100 persons came to
Tresidder Memorial Union's Large
Lounge for the speech.
During a question-and-answer
session, the negotiator said the
Soviets were seeking better
relations for a number of reasons,
including the emergence of China
as a major power and the need for
U.S. technology and economic
benefits.
He also denied that the United
States would become too
dependent on Russian natural gas,
saying that the deal would involve
only about one percent of the
total American consumption.
SALT Goals
Dr. Panofsky, a former
government arms control
negotiator who now heads the
federally-financed Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center (SLAC),
described the three major goals of
the second round of the Strategic
Arms Limitation Talks (SALT) as:
—limiting the number of all
strategic weapons, including
airplanes (omitted during the
first round of SALT);
— limiting technological
improvements on existing missiles;
—and reducing the current
"overkill" capacity of strategic
weapons.
Panofsky said that chances

were good that the first tvo goals
would be attained, but expressed
doubt that the third could be
accomplished.
As a result of SALT-I, he said,
both the United States and the
Soviet Union "acknowledge the
fact that a 'mutual hostage'
picture is the only one technically
available."
Soviet Reluctance
One reason the Soviets may be
reluctant to place too stringent
curbs on nuclear missies is that
they have not yet had the
opportunity to test and deploy
multiple independent re-entry
vehicles (MIRVs), while the
United States has.
"It is difficult to predict how
the Soviets will resolve the
conflict, which may have deep
ideological roots, between
achieving parity with the U.S. in
MIRV technology and enhancing
the security of their land-based
forces," Panofsky said.
"There's little doubt that
SALT-I has increased the security
of both the Soviet Union and the
U.S., even in a strictly military
sense. This is a welcome reversal
of the post-war trend of increasing
costs for strategic weapons,
accompanied by decreasing
security for all sides."
'Critical Test'
Yet, he declared, "the
burdensome military costs have
not as yet been reduced, and the
arms race has been deflected, not
arrested." SALT-II will be the
"critical test" to see if the two
countries can avoid "the race to
oblivion."
Prof. Zimmerman, who
concluded the conference,
predicted that the Soviet Union
may well draw closer to the
United States than to China
during the rest of the decade.
"One can imagine a major
Soviet rapprochement with the
U.S., looking toward a possible
coaltiion agianst China in the
'80's, or a major limited war
between the U.S.S.R. and China
in the '70's, perhaps more easily
than imagine a Soviet-Chinese
collaboration ... at the expense
of the U. 5.," he said.

DR. WOLFGANG K.H. PANOFSKY
The prognosis for
Soviet-American relations in the
1970's seems to be "guardedly
optimistic," according to the
scholars who addressed Stanford's
conference on "Soviet Foreign
Policy in the Seventies" last
Friday and Saturday.
Some 200 scholars from
throughout the nation heard five
experts on Soviet foreign policy
discuss the chances for improving
international relations during the
rest of the decade.
The five major speakers were
Prof. Vernon V. Aspaturian of

Pennsylvania State University;
Prof. Herbert S. Dinerstein of
Johns Hopkins University; Jack F.
Matlock, director of the Office of
Soviet Union Affairs of the U.S.
State Department; Dr. Wolfgang
K.H. Panofsky, directory of the
Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center (SLAC) and a former
negotiator for the U.S. Arms
Control and Disarmament
Agency; and Prof. William
Zimmerman of the University of
Michigan.
One scheduled speaker, Deputy
Asst. Sec. of State Richard T.
Davies, bowed out at the last

minute, and was replaced by
Matlock.
Stanford Political Science Prof.
Jan Triska chaired the conference,
which was sponsored by the
Stanford Center for Russian and
East European Studies.
Optimistic Predictions
Prof. Aspaturian offered
perhaps the most optimistic
perspective of the conference in
his opening address on "The
Soviet Union, The United States
and China in the Seventies."
Aspaturian called for "a new
world order .. . founded on a new
trans-ideological consensus in
which different social and
ideological systems could interact,
cooperate, and become mutually
supportive rather than function in
an adversarial and even
competitive manner.
"As long as differing social
systems remain anxious about
their ability to compete
successfully, the prospect of
failure contributes to insecurity."
World Policeman
According to Aspaturian, the
Soviet Union and the United
States will both substantially
modify their previous foreign
policies. The U.S., he said, is
retreating from its role of
international policeman, and the
Soviet Union is not likely to
attempt to move into the area
being vacated by the U.S.
"The U.S. has implicitly
recognized its failure to impose its
version of justice and order upon
the international system, and the

Soviet leaders are probably aware
that there is very little likelihood
of imposing a Soviet version of
international order upon the
world," he asserted.
Any such Russian attempt, he
said, would be "costly, risky, and
ultimately futile."
Five Other Nations
As both the U.S. and U.S.S.R.
abandon what Aspaturian termed
their "messianic impulses in
foreign policy," five other nations
— China, France, West Germany,
Japan, and Great Britain — will
develop more aggressive and
ambitious foreign policies, which
the Penn State scholar says will
provide a more balanced
international order.
To improve Soviet-American
relations, Aspaturian advocated a
policy for America of "not
challenging the [Soviet] system
but assisting in its efficient
operation ... subsidizing the
Soviet social order (and by
implication* the Chinese system as
well) by providing help in such a
way as to minimize the defects
and malfunctioning of
Communism."
This, he said, would eventually
"open up" the Soviet system to
more outside influences.
Not all of Aspaturian's
audience agreed with him. One
listener, noting that conference
chairman Triska had called
Aspaturian's address "broad and
imaginative," said that he could
only vouch for the latter
adjective. Aspaturian conceded
that his paper was "purely
speculative, and not meant to be
predictive."
Revolution
Prof. Dinerstein, an author and
Johns Hopkins faculty member,
told the group that the Soviet
Union has virtually abandoned the
hope that the Russian Revolution
would serve as the model for a
series of international socialist
revolutions.
In his talk, "The Soviet Union
and the Communist World," he
stated that Soviet leaders "are at
the point, or almost at the point,
of realizing that there is no
paradigm of revolution . . . there
will be no universal system of
states modeled on the Soviet
Union."
The major reason for this, he
said, is because "the proletariat is

only revolutionary on special
occasions.
Proletariat
"When the proletariat has a
stake in society, the difference
between what they have and what
they might get has to be very
considerable for them to risk their

been saddled with the support of
any leader who proclaims himself
anti-Communist, so the Soviet
Union is constrained to accept
any one who proclaims himself or
his state Communist. But the
Soviet leaders will not
automatically and cheerfully
accept any new responsibility
foisted on them."
Keeping Socialists Socialist
Overall, said Dinerstein, the
Soviets will approach the issue of
international revolution "warily,"
and will be more interested in
"keeping existing socialist states
socialist — a hard enough task —
rather than in looking for new
socialist revolutions which are

more and more viewed as burdens
rather than opportunities."
According to Jack Matlock, a
veteran of several negotiations
with the Soviets, the current
detente between America and the
U.S.S.R. appears to go much
further than have previous periods
of improved relations.
While cautioning that "there is
no basis for euphoria," Matlock
said that the increased number of
agreements signed by the two
nations, and the recent economic
deals that are sending U.S. surplus
wheat to Russia and Russian
natural gas to the United States,
seem to indicate that the Soviet
Union is serious about carriving at
a lasting detente with the United
States.
Late Addition
Matlock's appearance was
added as an evening session when
Davies cancelled. As a result, only
about 100 persons came to
Tresidder Memorial Union's Large
Lounge for the speech.
During a question-and-answer
session, the negotiator said the
Soviets were seeking better
relations for a number of reasons,
including the emergence of China
as a major power and the need for
U.S. technology and economic
benefits.
He also denied that the United
States would become too
dependent on Russian natural gas,
saying that the deal would involve
only about one percent of the
total American consumption.
SALT Goals
Dr. Panofsky, a former
government arms control
negotiator who now heads the
federally-financed Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center (SLAC),
described the three major goals of
the second round of the Strategic
Arms Limitation Talks (SALT) as:
—limiting the number of all
strategic weapons, including
airplanes (omitted during the
first round of SALT);
— limiting technological
improvements on existing missiles;
—and reducing the current
"overkill" capacity of strategic
weapons.
Panofsky said that chances

were good that the first tvo goals
would be attained, but expressed
doubt that the third could be
accomplished.
As a result of SALT-I, he said,
both the United States and the
Soviet Union "acknowledge the
fact that a 'mutual hostage'
picture is the only one technically
available."
Soviet Reluctance
One reason the Soviets may be
reluctant to place too stringent
curbs on nuclear missies is that
they have not yet had the
opportunity to test and deploy
multiple independent re-entry
vehicles (MIRVs), while the
United States has.
"It is difficult to predict how
the Soviets will resolve the
conflict, which may have deep
ideological roots, between
achieving parity with the U.S. in
MIRV technology and enhancing
the security of their land-based
forces," Panofsky said.
"There's little doubt that
SALT-I has increased the security
of both the Soviet Union and the
U.S., even in a strictly military
sense. This is a welcome reversal
of the post-war trend of increasing
costs for strategic weapons,
accompanied by decreasing
security for all sides."
'Critical Test'
Yet, he declared, "the
burdensome military costs have
not as yet been reduced, and the
arms race has been deflected, not
arrested." SALT-II will be the
"critical test" to see if the two
countries can avoid "the race to
oblivion."
Prof. Zimmerman, who
concluded the conference,
predicted that the Soviet Union
may well draw closer to the
United States than to China
during the rest of the decade.
"One can imagine a major
Soviet rapprochement with the
U.S., looking toward a possible
coaltiion agianst China in the
'80's, or a major limited war
between the U.S.S.R. and China
in the '70's, perhaps more easily
than imagine a Soviet-Chinese
collaboration ... at the expense
of the U. 5.," he said.

DR. WOLFGANG K.H. PANOFSKY
The prognosis for
Soviet-American relations in the
1970's seems to be "guardedly
optimistic," according to the
scholars who addressed Stanford's
conference on "Soviet Foreign
Policy in the Seventies" last
Friday and Saturday.
Some 200 scholars from
throughout the nation heard five
experts on Soviet foreign policy
discuss the chances for improving
international relations during the
rest of the decade.
The five major speakers were
Prof. Vernon V. Aspaturian of

Pennsylvania State University;
Prof. Herbert S. Dinerstein of
Johns Hopkins University; Jack F.
Matlock, director of the Office of
Soviet Union Affairs of the U.S.
State Department; Dr. Wolfgang
K.H. Panofsky, directory of the
Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center (SLAC) and a former
negotiator for the U.S. Arms
Control and Disarmament
Agency; and Prof. William
Zimmerman of the University of
Michigan.
One scheduled speaker, Deputy
Asst. Sec. of State Richard T.
Davies, bowed out at the last

minute, and was replaced by
Matlock.
Stanford Political Science Prof.
Jan Triska chaired the conference,
which was sponsored by the
Stanford Center for Russian and
East European Studies.
Optimistic Predictions
Prof. Aspaturian offered
perhaps the most optimistic
perspective of the conference in
his opening address on "The
Soviet Union, The United States
and China in the Seventies."
Aspaturian called for "a new
world order .. . founded on a new
trans-ideological consensus in
which different social and
ideological systems could interact,
cooperate, and become mutually
supportive rather than function in
an adversarial and even
competitive manner.
"As long as differing social
systems remain anxious about
their ability to compete
successfully, the prospect of
failure contributes to insecurity."
World Policeman
According to Aspaturian, the
Soviet Union and the United
States will both substantially
modify their previous foreign
policies. The U.S., he said, is
retreating from its role of
international policeman, and the
Soviet Union is not likely to
attempt to move into the area
being vacated by the U.S.
"The U.S. has implicitly
recognized its failure to impose its
version of justice and order upon
the international system, and the

Soviet leaders are probably aware
that there is very little likelihood
of imposing a Soviet version of
international order upon the
world," he asserted.
Any such Russian attempt, he
said, would be "costly, risky, and
ultimately futile."
Five Other Nations
As both the U.S. and U.S.S.R.
abandon what Aspaturian termed
their "messianic impulses in
foreign policy," five other nations
— China, France, West Germany,
Japan, and Great Britain — will
develop more aggressive and
ambitious foreign policies, which
the Penn State scholar says will
provide a more balanced
international order.
To improve Soviet-American
relations, Aspaturian advocated a
policy for America of "not
challenging the [Soviet] system
but assisting in its efficient
operation ... subsidizing the
Soviet social order (and by
implication* the Chinese system as
well) by providing help in such a
way as to minimize the defects
and malfunctioning of
Communism."
This, he said, would eventually
"open up" the Soviet system to
more outside influences.
Not all of Aspaturian's
audience agreed with him. One
listener, noting that conference
chairman Triska had called
Aspaturian's address "broad and
imaginative," said that he could
only vouch for the latter
adjective. Aspaturian conceded
that his paper was "purely
speculative, and not meant to be
predictive."
Revolution
Prof. Dinerstein, an author and
Johns Hopkins faculty member,
told the group that the Soviet
Union has virtually abandoned the
hope that the Russian Revolution
would serve as the model for a
series of international socialist
revolutions.
In his talk, "The Soviet Union
and the Communist World," he
stated that Soviet leaders "are at
the point, or almost at the point,
of realizing that there is no
paradigm of revolution . . . there
will be no universal system of
states modeled on the Soviet
Union."
The major reason for this, he
said, is because "the proletariat is

only revolutionary on special
occasions.
Proletariat
"When the proletariat has a
stake in society, the difference
between what they have and what
they might get has to be very
considerable for them to risk their
lives and possessions .. . the
proletariat supports the system
that rewards him, be it socialist or
non-socialist," he said.
According to Dinerstein, the
working class — in both socialist
and non-socialist nations — is
generally "patriotic, conservative
in life style, and resentful of
intellectuals who challenge the
system."
As an example, he cited the
situation in Czechoslovakia during
the ill-fated liberalization of
deposed leader Alexander
Dubcek. "The Czech proletariat
was largely opposed to Dubcek
until the Soviet intervention made
being Czech more important than
being a worker."
Castro's Cuba
Another revolutionary model
that the Soviets at one time held
in high esteeem was the takeover
by Fidel Castro in Cuba. Noting
that Castro had seized power
before publicly proclaiming
himself a Communist, Dinerstein
said, "a country had become a
socialist state with the Communist
Party playing only a minor role.
The socialist revolution occurred
after power had been taken and
consolidated .... In a sense, Cuba
is a case of a communist
revolution without Communists."
But the Soviets have soured on
even this model, he asserted
"Just as the United States has
been saddled with the support of
any leader who proclaims himself
anti-Communist, so the Soviet
Union is constrained to accept
any one who proclaims himself or
his state Communist. But the
Soviet leaders will not
automatically and cheerfully
accept any new responsibility
foisted on them."
Keeping Socialists Socialist
Overall, said Dinerstein, the
Soviets will approach the issue of
international revolution "warily,"
and will be more interested in
"keeping existing socialist states
socialist — a hard enough task —
rather than in looking for new
socialist revolutions which are

more and more viewed as burdens
rather than opportunities."

detente between America and the
