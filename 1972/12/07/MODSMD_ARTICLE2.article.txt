# Truman On Critical List; Ex-President Weakens
## 
### 
KANSAS CITY (AP) - Former
President Harry S Truman, fighting
against congested lungs with a
weakened heart, remained in critical
condition early this moming after
passing through what his doctor called
"an ultra-critical period."
An early-morning statement by
spokesmen at Research Hospital and
Medical Center said the 88-year-old
former chief executive was "responsive
to voice and touch stimuli."
The statement quoted Dr. Wallace
Graham, Truman's longtime personal
physician, as saying it was difficult to
differentiate between "medically
induced sedation and actual
unconsciousness or coma."
Two hours earlier, the former
President had been described as being
"in a deep stupor but responsive to
painful stimuli."
Truman's only child, Mrs. Clifton
Daniel, arrived at the hospital shortly
after midnight from Washington and
went immediately to the former
President's sixth-floor room, where
Truman's wife, Bess, was at his
bedside.
Breathing 'Adequate'
The hospital said special therapy to
aid his breathing was "no longer
indicated since his respiration is
adequate at present."
Truman was placed on the
critical list late yesterday, and a
hospital spokesman said then he had
suffered a "temporary relapse." The
spokesman said Truman's condition
later stabilized, however.
Truman's temperature was 102.8
degrees, the hospital said, indicating
"he is not responding to antibiotics
administered intramuscularly,
necessitating the administration of the
antibiotics intravenously.
"The administration is being

performed with extreme care to
prevent adverse reactions because of
his known allergies," a hospital
spokesman said.
An hour earlier, the hospital said
Truman's condition was in a "very
delicate and critical balance." The
hospital's definition of "critical"
includes the phrase "death may be
imminent."
Graham was also at his beside, the
statement said, and an internist, Dr.
Wilson Miller, had been in attendance
since early evening.
The former chief executive was

taken by ambulance to the hospital
late Tuesday. His condition at first was
termed fair, but deteriorated to serious
Tuesday night.
A hospital spokesman defined
"critical" as meaning "vital signs are
unstable and not within normal limits.
There are major complications, death
may be imminent."
A report earlier yesterday evening
from Graham had said the former
president's heart rate was speeding up
at times. The statement said, however,
that his blood pressure was "within
normal limits."

president's heart rate was speeding up
at times. The statement said, however,
that his blood pressure was "within
normal limits."
KANSAS CITY (AP) - Former
President Harry S Truman, fighting
against congested lungs with a
weakened heart, remained in critical
condition early this moming after
passing through what his doctor called
"an ultra-critical period."
An early-morning statement by
spokesmen at Research Hospital and
Medical Center said the 88-year-old
former chief executive was "responsive
to voice and touch stimuli."
The statement quoted Dr. Wallace
Graham, Truman's longtime personal
physician, as saying it was difficult to
differentiate between "medically
induced sedation and actual
unconsciousness or coma."
Two hours earlier, the former
President had been described as being
"in a deep stupor but responsive to
painful stimuli."
Truman's only child, Mrs. Clifton
Daniel, arrived at the hospital shortly
after midnight from Washington and
went immediately to the former
President's sixth-floor room, where
Truman's wife, Bess, was at his
bedside.
Breathing 'Adequate'
The hospital said special therapy to
aid his breathing was "no longer
indicated since his respiration is
adequate at present."
Truman was placed on the
critical list late yesterday, and a
hospital spokesman said then he had
suffered a "temporary relapse." The
spokesman said Truman's condition
later stabilized, however.
Truman's temperature was 102.8
degrees, the hospital said, indicating
"he is not responding to antibiotics
administered intramuscularly,
necessitating the administration of the
antibiotics intravenously.
"The administration is being

performed with extreme care to
prevent adverse reactions because of
his known allergies," a hospital
spokesman said.
An hour earlier, the hospital said
Truman's condition was in a "very
delicate and critical balance." The
hospital's definition of "critical"
includes the phrase "death may be
imminent."
Graham was also at his beside, the
statement said, and an internist, Dr.
Wilson Miller, had been in attendance
since early evening.
The former chief executive was

taken by ambulance to the hospital
late Tuesday. His condition at first was
termed fair, but deteriorated to serious
Tuesday night.
A hospital spokesman defined
"critical" as meaning "vital signs are
unstable and not within normal limits.
There are major complications, death
may be imminent."
A report earlier yesterday evening
from Graham had said the former
president's heart rate was speeding up
at times. The statement said, however,
that his blood pressure was "within
normal limits."
