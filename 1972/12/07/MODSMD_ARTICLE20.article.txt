# Reagan Veto Possible
## Educational Facilities Bill Passed 
### ROBERT BACON 
A Stan ford-pro posed bill which would
substantially reduce the University's interest
cost on building loans is awaiting action by
Governor Ronald Reagan.
In its final hours last Friday, the State
Legislature gave final approval to the bill to
establish a "California Educational Facilities
Authority."
The Authority would be empowered to
issue tax-exempt bonds, which require smaller
interest payments than do taxed bonds, and
loan the money so raised to private colleges
and universities for building construction.
University officials estimated last spring
that they would be able to save between
$250,000 and $500,000 per year in interest
costs should the measure become law.
Robert Freelen of the University Relations
Office this week expressed uncertainty as to
the final fate of the bill. "The State Director
of Finance opposed it in the Senate Finance

Committee hearing at the last minute,"
Freelen said, suggesting a possible veto by the
Governor.
If the bill is signed into law, Stanford
would definitely take advantage of it, Freelen
said. He indicated that the decision as to what
projects to finance in this manner would be
made by the University President and
Vice-Presidents.
In addition to new construction, buildings
completed within the past three years and
financed by borrowing could be refinanced
under the more advantageous terms provided
by the act.
The Authority could be used to finance
any type of building except athletic facilities,
Freelen indicated.
Stanford would pledge a sufficient portion
of its endowment as collateral for loans from
the Authority. The bill explicitly provides
that participating institutions must bear the
full operating costs of the Authority, and that
tax funds cannot be used either for this

purpose or to cover loans on which a college
defaults.
Freelen said another advantage, in addition
to the reduced interest rate, would be that the
University could begin construction of
buildings more quickly than if gift or standard
loan financing had to be arranged. He pointed
to the 10 percent per year escalation factor in
construction costs as incentive to do so.
The bill, Assembly Bill 2014, was
sponsored in the legislature by Assemblyman
Dixon Arnett (R-Redwood City), a former
Assistant Director of University Relations at
Stanford. It is based on a New Jersey statute,
and was drafted by Ken MacKenzie, a
Stanford law student.
The bill had the support of the Association
of Independent California Colleges and
Universities, of which Stanford is a member.
Reagan must sign or veto the bill before
Dec. 31. A gubernatorial veto is in practice
absolute; no legislative override has been
successful since 1946.
