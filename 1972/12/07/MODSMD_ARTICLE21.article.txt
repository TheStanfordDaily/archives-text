# legislature Passes Tax Reform Bill
## 
### ROBERT BACON 
The 1972 California Legislature on its final day last Friday sent to
Governor Ronald Reagan major bills on tax reform, marijuana,
environmental protection, and newsmen's immunity, among others.
A few days earlier, the Legislature completed action on two
measures to protect the wild rivers of the north coastal counties.
Major achievement of the eleven-month session was the
long-promised $1.1 billion compromise tax shift, which will increase
the state sales tax and limit property taxes.
Gov. Reagan is sure to sign the measure, which is a compromise
negotiated between him and Assembly Speaker Bob Moretti (D-Van
Nuys) last spring. The bill sailed through the Assembly, but Senate â– 
Democrats balked at the measure and defeated it twice before finally I
passing it in the waning hours of the session.
Sales Tax Increase
The state sales tax will rise to 6 percent on June 1, 1973.
Residential owner-occupants will have substantial property tax
reductions beginning in the fall of 1973. Corresponding reductions for
renters will be provided through income tax credits.
Additional revenue will come from an increase in bank and
corporation taxes and federal revenue-sharing funds. State aid to local
school districts will increase by $332 million per year under the plan.
The Legislature also completed action on a bill to reduce the
maximum penalty for first-offense possession of marijuana from 10
years in prison to six months in the county jail and a $500 fine.
Reagan is certain to veto this measure.
The State Supreme Court's September decision that environmental
impact reports are required for privately-financed construction
projects would be stayed for 120 days under another measure
awaiting the Governor's action. He is expected to approve this bill,
which was opposed by conservation groups.
A bill by Assemblyman William Bagley (R-San Rafael) would grant
reporters immunity from contempt citations for refusal to divulge
their sources to grand juries.
Dam Moratorium
Dam construction on north coastal rivers would be prohibited I
under two bills passed by the Legislature in its final week. Reagan will]

probably sign one of them. An exception would be made for the
flood-prone Eel River, on which a 12-year dam moratorium would be
imposed.
Reagan, currently in Arizona, will return to Sacramento over the
weekend. He has until Dec. 31 to sign or veto bills passed during the
final days of the Legislative session. Vetoes are in practice absolute;
none has been overriden since 1946.
Notable failures of the 1972 session were reapportionment of
legislative districts, which probably will fall to the State Supreme
Court, no-fault automobile insurance, and equalization of school
district financing, mandated by the State Supreme Court last year.
