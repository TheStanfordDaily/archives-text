Butz Reappointed; Peterson Out
CAMP DAVID, Md. — President Nixon is keeping Earl
Butz as Agriculture secretary but is replacing Commerce
Secretary Peter G. Peterson with South Carolina textile
manufacturer Frederick B. Dent, the White House said
yesterday.
As part of President Nixon's second-term Cabinet
shuffle, Peterson will take on a temporary special mission
to Europe and Asia, then return to private life.
There were signs that the former Bell and Howell Co.
president was eased out after losing a bid to become an
international economic policymaker and after falling from
favor among Nixon's closest advisers.
Sources said Peterson turned down an ambassador's job
in Europe before losing his bid to handle international
economic policy under Treasury Secretary George P.
Shultz who is being given wide economic powers in
Nixon's second term.
Press secretary Ronald L. Ziegler told newsmen at the
Camp David presidential retreat that Peterson's departure
results not from a rift with Shultz, but from a "joint
decision" between Nixon and the man who succeeded
Maurice H. Stans as commerce secretary in February.
While Butz is being retained in the second-term
Cabinet, White House officials said Nixon has ordered a
broad shakeup of the Agriculture Department to make it
"even more responsive to farmers' needs based upon
today's problems."
Kissinger, Tho Hold Cordial Session
PARIS — Henry A. Kissinger and North Vietnam's Le Due
Tho had an apparently cordial s'/2-hour meeting yesterday
on the third day of their current round of secret peace
talks, but they gave no hint of their progress.
President Nixon's security adviser and the Hanoi
Politburo member shook hands warmly at the start and
end of their meeting in the suburban Neuily villa. They
and their advisers lunched together and were later seen
walking in the garden in animated and seemingly friendly
conversation.
The White House announced Kissinger and Tho would
meet again this afternoon. Their scheduled meeting
yesterday was canceled without explanation.
The U.S. delegation spokesman David Lambertson said
the 169 th weekly session of the semipublic peace talks
would take place today as usual.
French press reports speculated that Kissinger and Tho
may be working on the final wording of a cease-fire
agreement. Saigon newspapers predicted a cease-fire
agreement by Christmas. But in Hanoi, the official
newspaper Nhan Dan said there can be no peace until the
Saigon government agrees to release its political prisoners.
Kissinger and Tho resumed their secret negotiations on
these issues Monday, following a nine-day recess. The
North Vietnamese claimed the Tuesday meeting was
canceled at Kissinger's request. The White House said
Nixon sent detailed new instructions to this security
adviser during the Tuesday pause.
The Viet Cong marked the pause with sharp rocket
attacks on military installations in South Vietnam,
particularly Saigon's Tan Son Nhut airport.
U.S. sources in Saigon speculated that the Viet Cong
may have wished to demonstrate its presence within
rocket range of the South Vietnamese capital in an
attempt to pressure the United States into signing the
draft agreement despite Saigon's objections.

Bagley Says Prop. 21 Void
SACRAMENTO — The author of California's schools
integration guidelines law said yesterday he is asking the
state Supreme Court to rule Prop. 21, the antibusing
initiative approved by state voters last month,
unconstitutional.
Assemblyman William Bagley, R-San Rafael, said the
proposition nullifies the law he wrote which was intended
to provide orderly integration without having to resort to
busing.
Prop. 21, he said in a friend of the court brief, strips
school boards of the tools they need to carry out their
"constitutional duty to eliminate segregation."
The result, he said, is that the courts will be "forced to
order busing."
Bagley said his recommendation was in a brief filed in
the case of the Santa Barbara School District against the
Santa Barbara Superior Court. He said the case to be
argued in two months, "affords an instant opportunity"
to test Prop. 21.
Three other suits on file also challenge the
constitutionality of Prop. 21, which the voters approved
No. 7. They include one in Sacramento by the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People,
which contends it violates the equal protection guarantees
of the 14th Amendment.
Bagley argues that Prop. 21 is very similar to a North
Carolina statute already declared unconstitutional by the
U.S. Supreme Court.
Irish Vote On Church Position
DUBLIN — The main issue is the Roman Catholic
Church's "special position" in Ireland, but voters in the
nation's referendum today have a chance to strengthen
the government's hand in working for a peaceful end to
Irish partition.
The 1%-million voters will be out to approve or reject
two changes in their 1937 constitution.
One would lower the voting age from 21 to 18 and
bring Ireland into line with suffrage requirements of most
of Europe.
The other, more controversial change would remove
two subsections of Article 44 giving the Catholic Church
its special position in Irish affairs.
Opinion polls do not operate here, but the most
predominant measureable guess is that the electorate will
give Prime Minister Jack Lynch a "yes" vote on both
issues, probably by a close margin.
Lynch, in his election eve appeal yesterday for a big
turnout, contended that the Church's special position had
been used as a propaganda weapon by those opposed to
unification of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
These opponents include the majority of British-ruled
Northern Ireland's million Protestants. Catholics in the
North number about 500,000.
Meanwhile in Belfast, William Whitelaw, Britain's chief
administrator in Northern Ireland, ordered a new task
force of police and soldiers yesterday to stamp out what
he called "murder madness, the assassination squads
responsible for more than 100 sectarian killings this year.
