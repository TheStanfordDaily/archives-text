# ASSU Approves Course Review
## 
### TERRY ANZUR 
The ASSU Senate Tuesday passed
a resolution establishing an ASSU
Course Review to review major
undergraduate courses beginning with
the autumn quarter of the 1973-74
academic year.
Preparations for the course review
have already begun, but ASSU
Co-President Brent Appel told the
Senate that there may be difficulties in
publishing a comprehensive review.
The Senate voted unanimously to
allieviate administrative and financial
difficulties by setting up a policy
board for the Course Review and
allocating $1500 from the ASSU
general reserve fund to finance its
publication.
According to Appel, the Course
Review had been operating without an
official staff or funds for publication.
Printed questionnaires have been
distributed to students in many classes
at the expense of the Council of
Presidents.
Appel also said it has been difficult
to enlist the cooperation of several
University departments, and to find
students who are willing to act as
departmental coordinators for the
Review. He asked the Senators to help
by distributing questionnaires in their
classes during finals week.
Pub Board Action
In other business, the Senate
rescinded the Publications Board
By-Law revisions which it passed last
week, and passed a revised set of
by-laws containing several
compromises.
Publications Board Chairman Alan
Wachtel said the revised by-laws
essentially affect the membership
policies of the Board. The rescinded
by-laws included The Real News and
the Course Review as voting members,
but the newly approved version leaves
all membership additions and removals
to the discretion of the Board, subject
to the approval of the Senate.
The present member publications
of the Board are the Chaparral, the
Daily, the Quad, and the Sequoia. The
full Board, which includes the manager
of the Blotter, the ASSU vice
president, the student financial
manager, two senators, one student
appointed by the Council of
Presidents, and the editors and
business managers of the member
publications, will meet today to vote
on admitting new members.
Board Membership
The Board will consider admitting
the Quarterly Review, Stonecloud, the
Real News, and any other publications

interested in membership, including
the Arena, and the Course Review.
The Board has the option of admitting
new members on a trial basis with one
representative vote.
The Senate reversed another of last
week's decisions by releasing control
of KZSU's $39,000 student fee
assessment to the station's University
account.
KZSU station manager Joe
Straubhaar explained that the Senate
has consistently released KZSU funds
in the past. Banking with both the
ASSU and the University doubles the
necessary paperwork for the station
and for the student financial manager.
The Senate was reluctant to release
the funds this year, because several
senators felt that the students are
entitled to know how their money is
being spent. KZSU's total $52,000
budget is now deposited with the
University, but the station has agreed
to make monthly financial reports to
the Financial Committee of the Senate
or the student financial manager.
President's Report
In the president's report to the
Senate, Scott Burke urged the creation

of a committee to study the
University's policy on the
confidentiality of the action of
University committees. Since the
Senate took no action on the matter
last night, Burke, who feels the present
policy is not justified, will appoint his
own committee.
Burke was persuaded to withdraw
his veto of the Senate's decision to
establish a committee to investigate
the salaries of student officers.
According to the ASSU Constitution,
the president can veto Senate bills, but
not its other actions. Burke says he
will consult other members of the
Council of Presidents before making
future vetoes.
Finally, the Senate voted to
establish a task force in connection
with its recent statement as "being
opposed to any and all action
involving the use of firearms on a
University campus." Senator Jim
Yedor, who introduced the resolution
remarked, "The Senate has no legal
jurisdiction or power in this matter, but
it has a responsibility to investigate
and report to the students on
University policies."
