# Appellate Court To Rule On Cross Suit Dismissal
## 
### 
A state appellate court is expected
to rule next week on a University
motion to dismiss Dr. Nancy Jewell
Cross' lawsuit charging the University
with "sex-race discrimination" in
admissions and hiring.
Cross told the Daily yesterday that
the state Court of Appeals of the first
district is expected to rule on the
matter this Tuesday, Dec. 12.
Cross and Linda Crouse, a
computation center employee, filed
the suit in April 1971 in Santa Clara
County Superior Court, but Judge
John S. Mclnerny dismissed the case.
Earlier this week, the state Supreme
Court rejected a motion by Cross and
Crouse to bypass the appellate court
and consider the case now.
The court said that its denial would
not preclude a later appeal by either
party.
At the same time, the high court
denied a request by the United
Stanford Employees (USE) to enter
the case as a friend of the court had
the matter gone immediately to the
Supreme Court. According to Cross,
USE has not yet decided whether to
enter the case at the appellate level.

Meanwhile, Cross' other suit against
the University — a $500 small claims
court suit stemming from a parking
ticket she received — has been
continued until Dec. 21.
Cross has entered a motion for a
default judgment in the case, on the
grounds that at least two of the four
defendants named in the suit failed to
appear at last week's scheduled
hearing.
The defendants are the University,
Acting President William Miller,
security guard Lowell Scadden, and
University counsel Cassius L. Kirk Jr.
Only Kirk appeared last week,
claiming that he represented both
himself and the University — as a
University official. He says he is an
assistant secretary to the Board of
Trustees — Cross says he is not.
Kirk said yesterday that he will
argue that Miller is "not an essential"
in the case, and thus should be
removed from the list of defendants.
Cross claimed that Kirk told her last
week that Miller was "too big" to be
named in the suit.
Kirk would say only that "we do
not intend to default" in the suit.
