## 'Tis The Season To Spend Money 
### GEORGE DOBBINS 
It's a bird, a plane, Superman,
Archie Bunker, Mickey Mouse and
Monopoly. It's a pastime, a sport, a
trinket, a bauble. It floats, flies, makes
noise and cries. And children, young
or grown, derive enjoyment from it.
A toy is all of these. Each
Christmas, manufacturers flood the
market with new toys in an effort to
capitalize on the holiday season.
Stores must order them as early as the
preceeding March to keep up with the
Christmas rush. And the rush is now
on.
The key word this year is games —
indoor sports and the traditional board
games; they are outselling playthings,
according to toy store owners in the
Stanford area.
The action games include pool,
football, hockey and even indoor
basketball. Most of these games are
labeled "fun for the entire family," in
an attempt to convince adults that
they too can enjoy them. On the box
of one pool game, Lucille Ball's
picture is undersigned by the
endorsement, "My favorite family
game."
Pool Games
Pool is certainly catching on as a
family game, with toy tables running
in all sizes, 17 to 40 inches long, ten to
30 dollars. A popular pool game is the
new Pivot Pool from Milton Bradley
(24 dollars). This is a table-top version
without cues, that has a catapult
device which shoots the cue ball
anywhere on the board. There is one
problem: sometimes, the catapult
shoots the cue ball off the board but
this can be remedied with proper
aiming.
If space is a problem, Skittle Pool
from Aurora is the answer. It involves
a cue ball suspended from a hanging
rope and takes up about half the area
of a regular toy table for under ten
dollars. And there is Skittle everything
— bowling, horseshoes and believe it or
not, poker, where the suspended ball
determines the cards that are drawn.
All the Skittle boxes even have Don
Adam's picture on the front, looking
bewildered like he just finished reading

the instructions. What else could
anyone want?
Football? Electric football games
are indeed strong sellers and, this year,
are equipped with new variations. A
game called ABC Monday Night
Football (9 dollars) involves the use of
computer cards to select plays. Talking
Football, like Talking Baseball and
Basketball, literally consists of a
miniature stadium and a voice box
that announces the plays after they
have been chosen. Does Howard Cosell
know about this? Perhaps he's
involved in the wrong game. This one
is recommended for ages six thru
adult.
The fanciest football game available
(under 30 dollars) is National
Conference Electric Football,
complete with "total team control,"
meaning that each player's four legs
can be individually adjusted to allow
him to run in any direction. There is
even a clock which allows a
sixty-minute game to be played. Each
man is individually painted and the
quarterbacks kick, pass and run.
Naturally, every team in the NFL can
be purchased separately.
Elaborate Hockey
For those who don't like football,
the toy manufacturers are again selling
elaborate hockey games. Bobby Orr
Table Hockey (under 20 dollars) is
unique in that it comes complete with
an overhead scoreboard and the flags
of thirty countries flying on top of the
scale model arena.
These games involve no more
exercise than a flip of the wrist but
Parker Brothers and Ideal have solved
that problem with indoor exercise.
Nerfoop is not a disease but Parker
Brothers' new version of indoor
basketball complete with a foam
rubber Nerf ball and hoop that can be
mounted on a door, window or wall.
The game is under 4 dollars but the
Nerf balls sell individually in two sizes
— super ($2.98) and small ($1.39).
Ideal is going on the assumption
that Tic-Tac-Toe is an ageless game
that needs to be beefed up. The Toss
Across game sells for under thirteen
dollars and involves throwing

bean-bags at revolving squares
mounted on a board marked with X's
and O's.
For those who simply like throwing
bean-bags for an interminable amount
of time, Milton Bradley has devised
Upset ($13.95), a game featuring a
container with six trays and the object
is to throw three bags in your tray
before the opponent throws three in
his. The game, recommended for ages
seven to adult, requires an adult to
understand the supplied instructions.
Simplicity Award
The simplicity award for designing
an expensive game goes to Matchbox
toys for Cascade, the game that plays
itself. All the owner has to do is watch
steel balls as they are elevated up to a
tower, shot to a target area and
brought back to the base of the tower
by a battery operated conveyer belt.
This game is a thirteen dollar version
of Ideal's six dollar Bing-Bang-Boing
game; perhaps this is what happens
inside a person's head when he
watches the goings on for a long time.
Although the indoor action games
are popular, those played with cards
and game boards are selling at a faster
rate. According to Neal Pierce,
manager of the Emporium's toy
department at Stanford, Monopoly,
Chutes and Ladders and Candyland are
still the most popular games because
"They're relatively inexpensive and
good." The three games sell for about
six dollars apiece. Pierce also claims
that new card games such as Archie
Bunker's "ding-bat" version of Bridge
and the All in the Family Game are
gaining notoriety.
At Norney's Toy Store in the
Stanford Shopping Center, the most
popular new game is Ninety-Seven, by
Kontrell. It consists solely of a board
with numbers on it and two dice.
Players roll the dice to determine
which numbers they will get and the
first to reach 97 wins.
Parker Brothers' older games, like
Monopoly and The Game of Life are
apparently still successful but the
company continues to turn out new
games of mental strategy. Mind Maze
($5.69) involves a struggle between
two opponents, each trying to move a
steel ball through an unseen image
with a magnet before his opponent
does so. Masterpiece (under six
dollars) is similar to Monopoly
although it deals with the buying and
selling of art objects.
'Landslide'
Parker Brothers has come out with
what might be called a flop. It is
appropriately named Landslide.
According to Pierce, "The game isn't
doing as well as it should." The game
concerns an election and opponents
must buy and sell states with vote
cards until someone receives enough
electoral votes to win. "The thrill of
the election is all over; maybe it came
out a little too late," Pierce
conjectures.
At Norney's, "the biggest
non-selling item" is a game ironically
called Perfection. The eight dollar
game, from Reed Toys, is a
combination of Beat the Clock and
Kindergarten. A contestant must place
geometric shapes in their proper places
on a plastic board before the attached
clock signals that time is up. Half the
fun is figuring out the instructions,

which are far more complicated than
the game.
A salesman at Norney's says that
television is the major influence on
children and they immediately know
what they want when they come into
the store. "We really don't have to
display the toys here. All the parents
do is come in and ask for a name they
were given by the kids. They just read
the boxes and buy the toy," he states.
And what kinds of toys are people
buying? According to the Norney's
sales manager, "creative playthings,
the old reliables like erector sets,
Leggo and Tonka Toys." She insists
that toy makers are leaning toward
science oriented toys.
This year, Edcom Systems, Inc. of
New Jersey, has been extremely
successful with a brand new series of
toys called Action Labs, intended for
children six to eight years old and
selling for about two dollars each. The
labs deal with the fundamentals of
physics; children can build flapping
airplanes, parachutes, sundials and
balance kits. Workbenches and
carpenter kits are also for sale,
intended for younger children.
Military Toys
Pierce claims that older boys like
models and military toys. He says that
guns and weapons are "no longer in
great demand." The only guns carried
by the Emporium are Daisy air rifles
and rubber dart guns. A brand new
series of miniature models of soldiers
and cannons called Britains LTD are
selling "very well," says Pierce.
Pierce says that there has been a
"new revival" in models of cars, boats,
planes and even electric trains. Model
kits have become larger and now
include metal parts. They range from a
fifteen inch long Rolls Royce Bugatti
selling for eighteen dollars to a five
dollar U.S.S. Constitution kit with 39
sails to a ten dollar B-25 Mitchell
bomber that assembles with screws
instead of cement.
Electric trains may run as high as
sixty dollars for the Lionel Allegheny
model which reverses, lights and
smokes and comes with about twenty
feet of track. Cheaper trains such as
the Mattel Putt-Putt Railroad are
available for under fifteen dollars.
Mattel Hot Wheels and Sizzler race
car sets have been out over three years
but they are still popular because
"kids like to race," Pierce says. This
year, Mattel came out with a "dud" in
its line of cars cailed Drivin' Gear. This
is a device which allows the owner of a
Hot Wheels car to steer the car from a
control panel, but it isn't selling.
Battery Planes
Mattel has, however, proven
successful with its Verdi Birds, battery
driven planes that fly on a cable above
the ground. Air Devils, another
company, has mimicked this with its
Night Flight kit, selling for thirteen
dollars.
There is another category of toys
called the old favorites, consisting of
Kenner projectors, G.I. Joes and even
Ken and Barbie dolls.
Kenner has updated their projectors
and even given them sound tapes. The
film too is in cartridges, but the
Give-a-Show projectors are familiar.
"They're great items," says Pierce.
GI Joe is now available in black and
white, with real hair in any color and

with a choice of beard styles, if desired
for about six dollars. Accessories for
him include: astronaut uniforms,
rocket packs, jeeps, windboats and
even a portable headquarters for about
nineteen dollars.
Joe is not the only doll that is still
popular. Malibu Barbie and Ken have
been joined by Stacey, P.S., Skipper
and Brad. For a few years, at least one
Bay Area storfe refused to carry Barbie
and Ken because they weren't married,
but the store now carries the dolls.
The store even carries gift boxes
containing Ken and Brad — interpret
that one! Two recent additions include
Big Jim and Big Jack, black and white
(respectively) boxers, selling for under
five dollars each.
Tiny Price
Mattel and Remco have recently
introduced other dolls for girls. Baby
Tender Love, who "looks and feels
like a real baby," comes in three
models — tearful, talking and tiny
baby. Fortunately, the tiny baby has a
relatively tiny price.
Remco's twenty dollar
extravaganza, Sweet April Playland, is

an amusement park complete with
doll, motorized turtle for her to ride
on, a merry-go-round and a two seater
ferris wheel. A saleslady at Norney's
described it as costing a "fortune."
Macy's is featuring a gigantic
stuffed animal collection including
giraffes, teddy bears, turtles and
Snoopy dogs the size of a normal dog,
which are priced at 45 dollars.
The two most unusual items for
sale in the Stanford area are a $200
stuffed mouse the size of a man (at
Macy's), and a $54 working scale
model of a steam tractor (at the
Emporium). "We don't really expect
to sell the Mouse," a Macy salesman
stated, "but he attracts customers."
With all these gifts to choose from,
what are the children asking Santa fort
Besides the usual amount of requests
for erector sets, G I Joes and Barbie
Dolls, the Macy Santa is being asked
for Snoopy toothbrushes. "Eight out
of every ten kids seem to want them.
They don't even ask for bicycles
anymore; now its Snoopy
Toothbrushes. You know, I'm not
even sure if we carry them in the
store."


TRUCKIN' - Traditional toys are still in vogue, but for the adventurous, this
year's crop provides new excitement. Games are currently outselling playthings
and there is even one game that plays itself. Model cars and planes are also big
sellers.

IN YOUR EAR — This woman must think that for $200 there's more to the mouse than meets the eye. But what you see is what you get at Macy's toy
department. For further information, ask for John Steinbeck in the "Mice and Men Department."


SANTA'S HELPER — At Macy's, Santa and his elf assistant greet children who
come to make requests for Christmas presents. In the past, children have usually
asked for erector sets, GI Joes and Barbie dolls; but this year, Santa says that
eight out of every ten are requesting Snoopy toothbrushes.
