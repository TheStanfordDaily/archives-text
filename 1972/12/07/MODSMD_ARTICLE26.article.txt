# Winterland Sells Out
## 
### JAY HARLOW 
Ten Years After put on the
first of two weekend shows
Friday night, along with Wild
Turkey and Z.Z. Top, to a sellout
crowd at Winterland.
Z.Z. Top, a band from Texas,
started the show. The group
consisted of only three people: a
guitarist, a bass player, and a
drummer. •It was a typical
third-hand-on-the-bill, with more
volume than substance.
The guitarist used his axe more
for percussion than for melody;
still, they were fairly well received
by the Winterland audience,
which will applaud anything and
bring almost anything out for an
encore.
Although they are not well
known around here, we will be
hearing more from them in the
future, according to the stage
announcer. I won't hold my
breath.
Worth Listening
Wild Turkey, on the other
hand, was worth some listening.
An English band, they had two
guitarists who worked together
very nicely, a good lead singer
who played acoustic guitar on one
song, and an equally good
drummer, bass, and organist.
Their set was mostly original
material from their two albums,
with one or two rock & roll
numbers. They also drew a good
response from the crowd, which
demanded and received an encore.
An awfully long intermission
followed, complete with cartoons,
who's-gonna-be-here-when
announcements, and the excellent
short film "Toys," shown here at
the Sunday Flicks last year.
Finally, after several rounds of
impatient clapping and stomping
by the audience, Ten Years After
came on. All the way through
their two-hour set, people in the
audience hollered for "I'm Going
Home," their spectacular finale in
"Woodstock."

What they got instead was a
good mixture of old and new
material, mostly spotlighting lead
guitarist and singer Alvin Lee. The
first half of the set seemed to
revolve mostly around Lee, with
the others merely providing
backup for the controlled hysteria
of his guitar playing.
Each song was long, with
extensive solos by Lee and some
excellent duets with each of the
other instruments. Especially
good was one of their older songs,
"Good Mornin' Little Schoolgirl,"
and a long instrumental
"Winterland Jam in E."
Later on, the organist and bass
player had some solo time; both
turned in impressive
performances. The drummer
performed a long solo in which,
according to Lee, he played four
drum solos at once; I never did
quite figure out how.
'Going Home'
As a last number they did
"Going Home"; the audience ate
it up. Lee went through his usual
repertoire of vocal and guitar licks
on this one, touching on several
rhythm & blues and rock & roll
oldies. This brought most of the
full-house crowd to its feet; it
relentlessly called for an encore.
Frankly, I don't know how
they had the energy to come back
on stage, but they did, to play one
new (although shorter) number.
After seeing the performance they
gave this time and the response
they received, it seems safe to say
that Alvin Lee and company will
have no trouble drawing a full
house the next time they are in
town.

performances. The drummer
performed a long solo in which,
according to Lee, he played four
drum solos at once; I never did
quite figure out how.
'Going Home'
As a last number they did
"Going Home"; the audience ate
it up. Lee went through his usual
repertoire of vocal and guitar licks
on this one, touching on several
rhythm & blues and rock & roll
oldies. This brought most of the
full-house crowd to its feet; it
relentlessly called for an encore.
Frankly, I don't know how
they had the energy to come back
on stage, but they did, to play one
new (although shorter) number.
After seeing the performance they
gave this time and the response
they received, it seems safe to say
that Alvin Lee and company will
have no trouble drawing a full
house the next time they are in
town.
Ten Years After put on the
first of two weekend shows
Friday night, along with Wild
Turkey and Z.Z. Top, to a sellout
crowd at Winterland.
Z.Z. Top, a band from Texas,
started the show. The group
consisted of only three people: a
guitarist, a bass player, and a
drummer. •It was a typical
third-hand-on-the-bill, with more
volume than substance.
The guitarist used his axe more
for percussion than for melody;
still, they were fairly well received
by the Winterland audience,
which will applaud anything and
bring almost anything out for an
encore.
Although they are not well
known around here, we will be
hearing more from them in the
future, according to the stage
announcer. I won't hold my
breath.
Worth Listening
Wild Turkey, on the other
hand, was worth some listening.
An English band, they had two
guitarists who worked together
very nicely, a good lead singer
who played acoustic guitar on one
song, and an equally good
drummer, bass, and organist.
Their set was mostly original
material from their two albums,
with one or two rock & roll
numbers. They also drew a good
response from the crowd, which
demanded and received an encore.
An awfully long intermission
followed, complete with cartoons,
who's-gonna-be-here-when
announcements, and the excellent
short film "Toys," shown here at
the Sunday Flicks last year.
Finally, after several rounds of
impatient clapping and stomping
by the audience, Ten Years After
came on. All the way through
their two-hour set, people in the
audience hollered for "I'm Going
Home," their spectacular finale in
"Woodstock."

What they got instead was a
good mixture of old and new
material, mostly spotlighting lead
guitarist and singer Alvin Lee. The
first half of the set seemed to
revolve mostly around Lee, with
the others merely providing
backup for the controlled hysteria
of his guitar playing.
Each song was long, with
extensive solos by Lee and some
excellent duets with each of the
other instruments. Especially
good was one of their older songs,
"Good Mornin' Little Schoolgirl,"
and a long instrumental
"Winterland Jam in E."
Later on, the organist and bass
player had some solo time; both
turned in impressive
performances. The drummer
performed a long solo in which,
according to Lee, he played four
drum solos at once; I never did
quite figure out how.
