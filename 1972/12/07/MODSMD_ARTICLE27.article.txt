# 'Yerma' Reaches Heights Of Fine Art
## 
### MARC D. KAYE 
Fascist Spain has sent the
U.S.A. some of the most radical
theatre of this century. Last week,
one of Federico Garcia Lorca's
finest works appeared here in
sunny California: on a trampoline
stage. The poet's drama 'Yerma'
was performed at UCLA for a
week by the Nuria Espert
Company. It will return to play
through vacation.
The Espert Company's staging
of 'Yerma' is the most imaginative
production I've recently seen. It
rivals the Company Theatre of
Los Angeles in innovation, for
those of you who know how
weirdly wonderful the LA group
can get.
The Espert Company does not
usually present experimental
theater. It usually sticks to the
Spanish classics and Shakespeare.
Yet in this production it
confronts us with an angled stage,
thrust out into the audience, and
resembling a trampoline.
The Espert Company owes this
imaginative barren stage to the
South American director Victor
Garcia, a portege of Peter Brooks.
The stretchable tarpaulin Garcia
employs rises and falls, becomes
taut or loose, and can assume
various shapes, according to the
whims of the viewer's
imagination.
Surrealistic Work
It's a very appropriate staging
for a surrealistic and non-rational
work. As Lorca desired, Yerma
takes place on a rolling river, a
situation not possible in the
traditional theater. The stage
ripples and flows like a river. The
only staging I can think of that

could be an appropriate
improvement would be giant
undulating water bed, stretchable
with ejaculatory valves regulating
the flow of fluid.
The canvas does just fine, in
spite of American technology. It
has catches where hooks lowered
from the ceiling can latch into and
lift the flat surface into the third
dimension. Three sides of the
canvas have pulleys which are
manually worked by stagehands
who later turn out to be actors.
This can be distracting if one sits
up front. One should sit far

enough back in the center yet
close enough to hear. 'Yerma' was
a bit difficult to hear at times.
Hearing is the essence of the
production, as it is in fast flowing
Spanish. This- really doesn't
present problems to the avid
English-speaking Lorca fan. The
play takes an hour to read in
English and, besides, the program
gives a synopsis in English which
effectively helps one to follow the
action.
Instant Karma
'Yerma' is worthwhile for its
staging alone. But the play itself
and the acting contributes to the
'instant karma.' Lorca was the
most talented and promising

young Spanish poet and dramatist
of this century until he was
gunned down at the age of
thirty-six by Franco's soldiers. He
was involved in surrealistic and
poetic drama. 'Yerma' is one of
these poetic dramas.
Poetic drama as conceived by
Lorca does not belong to the
genre of psychological realism.
Rather it is an evocative drama,
using the symbolism, imagery, and
ambiguity of poetry.
The effect is surrealistically
dreamlike rather than socially
realistic. At times Lorca slips into

The Stanford Daily
Entertainment

lyricism as in the song of the
washerwomen, but Lorca's poetry
is just as good as his drama.
'Yerma,' which literally
translates from the Spanish into
"barren," presents us with an
unusual problem for this age of
women's liberation and artificial
birth control. The theme centers
around 'Yerma's' struggle to pass
on life, the ultimate creative act.
Yerma Alone
The obstacle to her passion for
children is her husband's strong
desire not to have sex and

children. He wants Yerma, and
Yerma alone. Yerma's fate is out
of her hands until she takes it
under her control by murderously
making sure she won't have
children. She chooses this instead
of living with the possibility but
improbability of having them.
This production's presentation
of Juan's motives for not having
children is the most integrious
possible. His reluctance is usually
explained in terms of
homosexuality or impotence. But
in this production of 'Yerma,' he
simply does not want children.
Nuria Espert, Spain's leading
actress, plays a deep
soul-searching Yerma against this
conception of Juan. She really
delves deep for the appropriate
emotional nuance in portraying
Yerma's barren condition. Her
deep feminine inflection is pure
Spanish melancholy, a somber
forboding of death. Yet she
exudes Yerma's girlish desire and
love of life.
Picture a storming Toledo by
El Greco in a sunny Andalucia.
Her mood fascinates the audience.
It both attracts us with its
yearning for life and repels us
with its hateful venom. Pure
excellence.
Tough Juan
The other actors are also quite
fine. Juan, played by Jose Luis
Pellicina, is tough, credible, and
barrenly effective. Amparo Valle,
the Old Pagan Woman, is a
classical and delightfully
picaresque character. Her whimsy

lights the stage. Victor, the man
who could have satisfied Yerma's
yearning, is played by a dashing
Daniel Dicenta. Enrique Majo and
Alicia Day respectively play the
devil and his wife.
Lorca gives stage time even to
Lucifer and Liluth. They appear
in an erotic nude scene which was
manufactured especially for
export for American and Western
European audiences. No nudity is
allowed in Franco's Spain, where
nonetheless this production
caused a scandal.
The nude scene is staged with
the canvas in an almost
completely vertical position. The
various actors and actresses have
foot and hand holds on which to
hang. The lights are dimmed a bit
and the whole scene climaxes
surrealistically, much like a real
canvas painted by Goya.
This scene is just part of the
ritualized drama that is 'Yerma.'
The play encompasses the whole
world. Yerma appeals to the
universe and beyond for
fecundity. She tries magic and
evokes the devil. This Dionysion
scene is unforgettable. It
transports the viewer from the
stage world of sexual eroticism to
the reality of the university and
religious possibilities.

South American director Victor
Garcia, a portege of Peter Brooks.
The stretchable tarpaulin Garcia
employs rises and falls, becomes
taut or loose, and can assume
various shapes, according to the
whims of the viewer's
imagination.
Surrealistic Work
It's a very appropriate staging
for a surrealistic and non-rational
work. As Lorca desired, Yerma
takes place on a rolling river, a
situation not possible in the
traditional theater. The stage
ripples and flows like a river. The
only staging I can think of that

could be an appropriate
improvement would be giant
undulating water bed, stretchable
with ejaculatory valves regulating
the flow of fluid.
The canvas does just fine, in
spite of American technology. It
has catches where hooks lowered
from the ceiling can latch into and
lift the flat surface into the third
dimension. Three sides of the
canvas have pulleys which are
manually worked by stagehands
who later turn out to be actors.
This can be distracting if one sits
up front. One should sit far

enough back in the center yet
close enough to hear. 'Yerma' was
a bit difficult to hear at times.
Hearing is the essence of the
production, as it is in fast flowing
Spanish. This- really doesn't
present problems to the avid
English-speaking Lorca fan. The
play takes an hour to read in
English and, besides, the program
gives a synopsis in English which
effectively helps one to follow the
action.
Instant Karma
'Yerma' is worthwhile for its
staging alone. But the play itself
and the acting contributes to the
'instant karma.' Lorca was the
most talented and promising

young Spanish poet and dramatist
of this century until he was
gunned down at the age of
thirty-six by Franco's soldiers. He
was involved in surrealistic and
poetic drama. 'Yerma' is one of
these poetic dramas.
Poetic drama as conceived by
Lorca does not belong to the
genre of psychological realism.
Rather it is an evocative drama,
using the symbolism, imagery, and
ambiguity of poetry.
The effect is surrealistically
dreamlike rather than socially
realistic. At times Lorca slips into

The Stanford Daily
Entertainment

lyricism as in the song of the
washerwomen, but Lorca's poetry
is just as good as his drama.
'Yerma,' which literally
translates from the Spanish into
"barren," presents us with an
unusual problem for this age of
women's liberation and artificial
birth control. The theme centers
around 'Yerma's' struggle to pass
on life, the ultimate creative act.
Yerma Alone
The obstacle to her passion for
children is her husband's strong
desire not to have sex and

children. He wants Yerma, and
Yerma alone. Yerma's fate is out
of her hands until she takes it
under her control by murderously
making sure she won't have
children. She chooses this instead
of living with the possibility but
improbability of having them.
This production's presentation
of Juan's motives for not having
children is the most integrious
possible. His reluctance is usually
explained in terms of
homosexuality or impotence. But
in this production of 'Yerma,' he
simply does not want children.
Nuria Espert, Spain's leading
actress, plays a deep
soul-searching Yerma against this
conception of Juan. She really
delves deep for the appropriate
emotional nuance in portraying
Yerma's barren condition. Her
deep feminine inflection is pure
Spanish melancholy, a somber
forboding of death. Yet she
exudes Yerma's girlish desire and
love of life.
Picture a storming Toledo by
El Greco in a sunny Andalucia.
Her mood fascinates the audience.
It both attracts us with its
yearning for life and repels us
with its hateful venom. Pure
excellence.
Tough Juan
The other actors are also quite
fine. Juan, played by Jose Luis
Pellicina, is tough, credible, and
barrenly effective. Amparo Valle,
the Old Pagan Woman, is a
classical and delightfully
picaresque character. Her whimsy

lights the stage. Victor, the man
who could have satisfied Yerma's
yearning, is played by a dashing
Daniel Dicenta. Enrique Majo and
Alicia Day respectively play the
devil and his wife.
Lorca gives stage time even to
Lucifer and Liluth. They appear
in an erotic nude scene which was
manufactured especially for
export for American and Western
European audiences. No nudity is
allowed in Franco's Spain, where
nonetheless this production
caused a scandal.
The nude scene is staged with
the canvas in an almost
completely vertical position. The
various actors and actresses have
foot and hand holds on which to
hang. The lights are dimmed a bit
and the whole scene climaxes
surrealistically, much like a real
canvas painted by Goya.
This scene is just part of the
ritualized drama that is 'Yerma.'
The play encompasses the whole
world. Yerma appeals to the
universe and beyond for
fecundity. She tries magic and
evokes the devil. This Dionysion
scene is unforgettable. It
transports the viewer from the
stage world of sexual eroticism to
the reality of the university and
religious possibilities.
Fascist Spain has sent the
U.S.A. some of the most radical
theatre of this century. Last week,
one of Federico Garcia Lorca's
finest works appeared here in
sunny California: on a trampoline
stage. The poet's drama 'Yerma'
was performed at UCLA for a
week by the Nuria Espert
Company. It will return to play
through vacation.
The Espert Company's staging
of 'Yerma' is the most imaginative
production I've recently seen. It
rivals the Company Theatre of
Los Angeles in innovation, for
those of you who know how
weirdly wonderful the LA group
can get.
The Espert Company does not
usually present experimental
theater. It usually sticks to the
Spanish classics and Shakespeare.
Yet in this production it
confronts us with an angled stage,
thrust out into the audience, and
resembling a trampoline.

This can be distracting if one sits
up front. One should sit far

enough back in the center yet
close enough to hear. 'Yerma' was
a bit difficult to hear at times.
Hearing is the essence of the
production, as it is in fast flowing
Spanish. This- really doesn't
present problems to the avid
English-speaking Lorca fan. The
play takes an hour to read in
English and, besides, the program
gives a synopsis in English which
effectively helps one to follow the
action.
Instant Karma
'Yerma' is worthwhile for its
staging alone. But the play itself
and the acting contributes to the
'instant karma.' Lorca was the
most talented and promising

young Spanish poet and dramatist
of this century until he was
gunned down at the age of
thirty-six by Franco's soldiers. He
was involved in surrealistic and
poetic drama. 'Yerma' is one of
these poetic dramas.
Poetic drama as conceived by
Lorca does not belong to the
genre of psychological realism.
Rather it is an evocative drama,
using the symbolism, imagery, and
ambiguity of poetry.
The effect is surrealistically
dreamlike rather than socially
realistic. At times Lorca slips into

The Stanford Daily
Entertainment

lyricism as in the song of the
washerwomen, but Lorca's poetry
is just as good as his drama.
'Yerma,' which literally
translates from the Spanish into
"barren," presents us with an
unusual problem for this age of
women's liberation and artificial
birth control. The theme centers
around 'Yerma's' struggle to pass
on life, the ultimate creative act.
Yerma Alone
The obstacle to her passion for
children is her husband's strong
desire not to have sex and

children. He wants Yerma, and
Yerma alone. Yerma's fate is out
of her hands until she takes it
under her control by murderously
making sure she won't have
children. She chooses this instead
of living with the possibility but
improbability of having them.
This production's presentation
of Juan's motives for not having
children is the most integrious
possible. His reluctance is usually
explained in terms of
homosexuality or impotence. But
in this production of 'Yerma,' he
simply does not want children.
Nuria Espert, Spain's leading
actress, plays a deep
soul-searching Yerma against this
conception of Juan. She really
delves deep for the appropriate
emotional nuance in portraying
Yerma's barren condition. Her
deep feminine inflection is pure
Spanish melancholy, a somber
forboding of death. Yet she
exudes Yerma's girlish desire and
love of life.
Picture a storming Toledo by
El Greco in a sunny Andalucia.
Her mood fascinates the audience.
It both attracts us with its
yearning for life and repels us
with its hateful venom. Pure
excellence.
Tough Juan
The other actors are also quite
fine. Juan, played by Jose Luis
Pellicina, is tough, credible, and
barrenly effective. Amparo Valle,
the Old Pagan Woman, is a
classical and delightfully
picaresque character. Her whimsy

lights the stage. Victor, the man
who could have satisfied Yerma's
yearning, is played by a dashing
Daniel Dicenta. Enrique Majo and
Alicia Day respectively play the
devil and his wife.
Lorca gives stage time even to
Lucifer and Liluth. They appear
in an erotic nude scene which was
manufactured especially for
export for American and Western
European audiences. No nudity is
allowed in Franco's Spain, where
nonetheless this production
caused a scandal.
The nude scene is staged with
the canvas in an almost
completely vertical position. The
various actors and actresses have
foot and hand holds on which to
hang. The lights are dimmed a bit
and the whole scene climaxes
surrealistically, much like a real
canvas painted by Goya.
This scene is just part of the
ritualized drama that is 'Yerma.'
The play encompasses the whole
world. Yerma appeals to the
universe and beyond for
fecundity. She tries magic and
evokes the devil. This Dionysion
scene is unforgettable. It
transports the viewer from the
stage world of sexual eroticism to
the reality of the university and
religious possibilities.
Fascist Spain has sent the
U.S.A. some of the most radical
theatre of this century. Last week,
one of Federico Garcia Lorca's
finest works appeared here in
sunny California: on a trampoline
stage. The poet's drama 'Yerma'
was performed at UCLA for a
week by the Nuria Espert
Company. It will return to play
through vacation.
The Espert Company's staging
of 'Yerma' is the most imaginative
production I've recently seen. It
rivals the Company Theatre of
Los Angeles in innovation, for
those of you who know how
weirdly wonderful the LA group
can get.
The Espert Company does not
usually present experimental
theater. It usually sticks to the
Spanish classics and Shakespeare.
Yet in this production it
confronts us with an angled stage,
thrust out into the audience, and
resembling a trampoline.
The Espert Company owes this
imaginative barren stage to the
South American director Victor
Garcia, a portege of Peter Brooks.
The stretchable tarpaulin Garcia
employs rises and falls, becomes
taut or loose, and can assume
various shapes, according to the
whims of the viewer's
imagination.
Surrealistic Work
It's a very appropriate staging
for a surrealistic and non-rational
work. As Lorca desired, Yerma
takes place on a rolling river, a
situation not possible in the
traditional theater. The stage
ripples and flows like a river. The
only staging I can think of that

could be an appropriate
improvement would be giant
undulating water bed, stretchable
with ejaculatory valves regulating
the flow of fluid.
The canvas does just fine, in
spite of American technology. It
has catches where hooks lowered
from the ceiling can latch into and
lift the flat surface into the third
dimension. Three sides of the
canvas have pulleys which are
manually worked by stagehands
who later turn out to be actors.
This can be distracting if one sits
up front. One should sit far

enough back in the center yet
close enough to hear. 'Yerma' was
a bit difficult to hear at times.
