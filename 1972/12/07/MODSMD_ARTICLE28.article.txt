# Vacation 'Happenings' Throughout The Country
## 
### 
Since most Stanford students are too busy
"booking it" during finals week to be
interested in a detailed report on Bay Area
"Happenings," the entertainment editors
have decided to list some 'Happenings' in
other cities. All the listings except those in the
Bay Area are for shows that have hard-to-get
tickets and that accept mail orders.
We realize we have left out a lot of
'Happenings' in a lot of cities, but, hopefully,
enough members of the Stanford community
will be visiting the areas we've listed for this
to be of some help.
