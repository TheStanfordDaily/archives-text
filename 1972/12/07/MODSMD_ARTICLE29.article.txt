# King Outperforms Charles
## 
### DAN FORTE 
Any show featuring two great
talents like Ray Charles and 8.8.
King on the same bill is bound to
sell out any auditorium, right?
Wrong. Opening night of a
five-night engagement by these
two musical giants was fairly
empty at the Circle Star Theater.
8.8. King is far and away the
most famous artist in blues
history. He took the blues out of
the juke joints and put it on
national television, onto AM
radio, and into Caesar's Palace. He
even won a Grammy Award with
"The Thrill Is Gone."
After 8.8.'s nine-piece band,
Sonny Freeman and the Unusuals,
played a couple of "up-front"
numbers, The King walked on
stage wearing a blue tuxedo and
carrying his guitar, Lucille.
Success has perhaps changed 8.8.
a little, but not very much. 8.8.
has always shown class on stage,

and in fact used to bill himself as
Mr. 8.8. King, back in the late
50's.
As usual, 8.8.'s first song was
his super-fast "Everyday I Have
The Blues." The audience's
response left something to be
desired, but, if anyone knows how
to wake up an audience, it's 8.8.
King. 8.8. deftly uses dynamics to
his advantage; in the long, slow
introduction to "How Blue Can
You Get," he started off playing
very quietly, gradually built up to
an intense, loud climax, and then
cut off completely, as if he were
teasing the crowd. King played
those same licks blues fans have
been hearing for years; not only
from him, but from nearly every
contemporary bluesman.
Classic Stance
8.8. assumed his classic stance
in front of the mike, with Lucille
slung by his side, his arms
outstretched, and his fists

clenched. "How Blue Can You
Get" has some of the most
Mow-down' lyrics of any blues.
"/ gave you a brand new Ford,
But you said, 7 want a
Cadillac.'
I bought you a ten dolbr
dinner,
You said, 'Thanks for the
snack.'
/ let you live in my penthouse,
You said it was just a shack.
I gave you seven children,
And now you wanna give 'em
back!"
At that point, 8.8. had the
audience in his hip pocket for the
rest of the night.
Sonny Freeman's band played
excellently throughout, especially
pianist Ron Levy, the only white
member, and tenor saxophonist
Bobby Forte (no relation).
Some of 8.8.'s other
outstanding songs were "Please
Love Me," his new blues-ballad

"Guess Who," and a slow blues
medley of "Nobody Loves Me But
My Mother (And She Could Be
Jivin' Too)," "Don't Answer The
Door," and "1 Got Some Help I
Don't Need."
Standing Ovation
When 8.8. finished, he received
a standing ovation, and walked up
the aisle shaking hands with his
fans.
After the 20 minute
intermission that followed, the
audience had to sit through
another 40 or more minutes of
"getting ready for the main man."
This included a couple of
mediocre numbers of the Ray
Charles Orchestra, a set by the
Raelettes, and a -black
ventriloquist and black dummy
called Erin and Freddy. It was
pretty funny to watch a
ventriloquist work in the round.
When the audience was getting
good and bored, Ray Charles
finally took the stage.
Unamplified Piano
Ray's set included a terrible
version of a terrible song, "Look
What They've Done To My Song";
mediocre arrangements of two
Beatles songs, "Yesterday"and
"Long and Winding Road"; a
pretty good rendition of Little
Milton's "Feel So Bad," which has
also been recorded by Elvis
Presley; and, of course, "I Can't
Stop Loving You."
Unfortunately, Charles' piano
wasn't amplified enough, so the
only time one could really hear
his playing was when he played
electric piano.
Charles ended the show with
"What'd I Say," and received a
standing ovation. But, unlike the
spontaneous ovation which 8.8.
King had received, Charles' came
only after a lot of coaxing by the
announcer; "Ray Charles, ladies
and gentlemen. The Genius of
Ray Charles ..."
When I walked outside, I
expected to see the owner
reversing the names on the
marquee; 8.8. King obviously
stole the show. It's not easy to
have to follow "The King of The
Blues," even if you're a "Genius."
