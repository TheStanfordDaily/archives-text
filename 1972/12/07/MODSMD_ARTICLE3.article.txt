# Apollo 17 Blasts Off After Two-Hour Delay
## 
### 
CAPE KENNEDY, Fla. (AP) -
Delayed for more than two hours by a
computer problem coming within a
breath of a flawless liftoff, Apollo 17
vaulted toward the moon last night,
propelled by a fiery rocket on what
could be man's last voyage to another
world.
The last flight of the historic
Apollo series began at 9:33 p.m. PST
as a thundering Saturn 5 rocket thrust
Navy Capt. Eugene A. Cernan,
geologist Harrison H. "Jack" Schmitt
and Navy Cmdr. Ronald A. Evans
away from their home planet on a
scientific expedition to fill in missing
chapters of moon history.
Hundreds of thousands of persons
jammed viewing sites in the Cape
Kennedy area to bid farewell to
Apollo and to watch the blazing
departure in the first after-dark
launching of an American manned
space flight.
They all had to wait two hours 40
minutes beyond the planned liftoff
time while experts trouble-shot the
problem with a computer-driven
device called an automatic sequencer.
The countdown proceeded
smoothly to within 30 seconds of the
originally planned liftoff time of 6:53
p.m. PST when the device, for some
reason, failed to pressurize an oxygen
tank in the third stage of the Saturn 5.
This caused the computer device to
call an automatic halt to the
countdown.
The veteran Cernan, 38, is making
his third trip into space. Schmitt, 37,

and Evans, 39, are going for the first
time.
Cernan and Schmitt will be the
11th and 12th Americans to set foot
on this alien land in 3'/2 years.
The presence of Schmitt, a
professional geologist and the first
scientist to fly in space, will add a new
dimension to lunar exploration.
With his trained eye and Cernan's
nearly two years of geology training,
these two adventurers hope to find
rocks that will tell scientists about the
early and late history of the moon,
filling in missing gaps in lunar
evolution.
Cernan, the articulate commander
of Apollo 17, has dedicated the
mission to awakening the world to the
fact that this "is not the end of space
flight. It is just the conclusion of the
beginning. We're not putting our
rockets in the barn and closing the
door. We're just beginning to
understand and accept the challenge
that the universe has for us.
"We will be the last men to visit the
moon for perhaps a quarter-century,"
he said. "We want to say 'Hey world,
hey, America, look at what we've
accomplished, but look at where we
can go. Let's set our sights deeper into
space. The challenge and the quest for
knowledge is available for all mankind
and the world'."
After Apollo, the United States has
no more plans to visit the moon and
instead will concentrate on earth orbit
missions. The Soviet Union also says it
has no moon plans and it also will
emphasize orbital flights.

With his trained eye and Cernan's
nearly two years of geology training,
these two adventurers hope to find
rocks that will tell scientists about the
early and late history of the moon,
filling in missing gaps in lunar
evolution.
Cernan, the articulate commander
of Apollo 17, has dedicated the
mission to awakening the world to the
fact that this "is not the end of space
flight. It is just the conclusion of the
beginning. We're not putting our
rockets in the barn and closing the
door. We're just beginning to
understand and accept the challenge
that the universe has for us.
"We will be the last men to visit the
moon for perhaps a quarter-century,"
he said. "We want to say 'Hey world,
hey, America, look at what we've
accomplished, but look at where we
can go. Let's set our sights deeper into
space. The challenge and the quest for
knowledge is available for all mankind
and the world'."
After Apollo, the United States has
no more plans to visit the moon and
instead will concentrate on earth orbit
missions. The Soviet Union also says it
has no moon plans and it also will
emphasize orbital flights.
CAPE KENNEDY, Fla. (AP) -
Delayed for more than two hours by a
computer problem coming within a
breath of a flawless liftoff, Apollo 17
vaulted toward the moon last night,
propelled by a fiery rocket on what
could be man's last voyage to another
world.
The last flight of the historic
Apollo series began at 9:33 p.m. PST
as a thundering Saturn 5 rocket thrust
Navy Capt. Eugene A. Cernan,
geologist Harrison H. "Jack" Schmitt
and Navy Cmdr. Ronald A. Evans
away from their home planet on a
scientific expedition to fill in missing
chapters of moon history.
Hundreds of thousands of persons
jammed viewing sites in the Cape
Kennedy area to bid farewell to
Apollo and to watch the blazing
departure in the first after-dark
launching of an American manned
space flight.
They all had to wait two hours 40
minutes beyond the planned liftoff
time while experts trouble-shot the
problem with a computer-driven
device called an automatic sequencer.
The countdown proceeded
smoothly to within 30 seconds of the
originally planned liftoff time of 6:53
p.m. PST when the device, for some
reason, failed to pressurize an oxygen
tank in the third stage of the Saturn 5.
This caused the computer device to
call an automatic halt to the
countdown.
The veteran Cernan, 38, is making
his third trip into space. Schmitt, 37,

and Evans, 39, are going for the first
time.
Cernan and Schmitt will be the
11th and 12th Americans to set foot
on this alien land in 3'/2 years.
The presence of Schmitt, a
professional geologist and the first
scientist to fly in space, will add a new
dimension to lunar exploration.
