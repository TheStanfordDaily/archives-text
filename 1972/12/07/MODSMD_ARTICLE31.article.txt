# Ballet Performs Here

The Pacific Ballet of San Francisco will present its exciting new
production of Tchaikovsky's Nutcracker Suite in Memorial
Auditorium on Saturday, December 9 at 8 and Sunday, December 10
at noon and 3.
The ballet is being sponsored by S.C.O.R.E. Although this is the
ballet's ninth annual production of Nutcracker, this year's
performance will be totally new. Conceived and choreographed by
Marc Wilde, this version will follow more closely the fantasies of the
original E.T.A. Hoffman story on which all the other Nutcracker
ballets have been loosely based.
Several of Pacific Ballet's principal dancers will be featured in the
performance: Sally Streets, formerly of the New York City Ballet,
Alan Howard, premier danseur with the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo,
and Thatcher Clarke, also formerly of the New York City Ballet and
the Nureyev-Fonteyn touring company.
Pacific Ballet recently presented three of choreographer Wilde's
ballets: 'To Love Somebody' (staged to selections by Roberta Flack),
Debussy's 'Afternoon of a Faun,' and Royel's 'La Valse.' New sets for
the production have been designed by Martin Izquierdo.
Tickets are now on sale at Tresidder Box Office. Prices are $3 and
$4, with a $1 discount for students. The 3 o'clock show is SOLD
OUT.
The Ballet will be touring northern California and Southern
Oregon, including Stockton and Corvallis. Check local papers for
times and places.
