# New Museum Exhibit
## 
### 
A small exhibition of some
twenty cliches-verres, on view at
the Stanford University Museum
of Art from December 1 through
January 3, shows the work of
such major artists as
Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot and
Charles-Francois Daubigny, as
well as that of the lesser-known
Paul Huet and Constant Dutilleux.
The technique of chiche-verre
consists of covering a glass plate
with an opaque substance and

then drawing into this surface
with a sharp point or a stiff brush.
A print was made just as we
make photographic contact prints
today. The technique offers
interesting possibilities for today's
printmakers, either used straight
or in combination with negatives
made in a camera.
The print shown above is
Corot's Madeleine Meditating
(1858), lend by R.E. Lewis, Inc.

Stanford Museum.
The Museum is open Tuesday
through Friday from 10 to 5,
Saturday and Sunday from 1 to 5.
