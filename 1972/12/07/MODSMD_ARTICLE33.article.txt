# Cross Sets Mark; Cards Smash Bows

### JIM WASCHER 
HONOLULU â€” The Hawaiians had their eyes on an upset, but the
Stanford Cardinals wanted a winning season and a record for Eric
Cross. They got both as they won an unexciting 39-7 game to capture
their fifth consecutive winning season.
Cross had been trying all season to break Gene Washington's 1968
record for the most touchdown passes caught by a Stanford player in
a single season. Cross caught his seventh against Oregon on Oct. 21,
had a long dry spell and finally tied Washington's record with his
eighth TD reception of the season during the Cal game.
Quarterbacks Mike Boryla and Dave Ottmar threw 23 of their 41
passes Saturday to Cross and the senior flanker made his ninth scoring
grab of the year early in the fourth quarter.
Cross' 14 pass receptions for 188 yards also broke Washington's
Pac-8 record for the most catches in a single game. Cross caught 53
passes this season to edge out Cal's Steve Sweeney for the season's
conference receiving title.
Cross Shines
Besides cheering Cross, the few hundred Stanford fans in the crowd
of 18,397 saw John Winesberry register his best performance since an
ankle injury early in the season. The running back dashed 17 yards for
a touchdown late in the second quarter and carried the ball 14 times
for a net gain of 99 yards. Winesberry also caught three passes for
another 16 yards and returned the opening kick-off 30 yards.
The game had remained scoreless until early in the second quarter
when Reggie Sanderson capped a 64 yard drive with a one yard run
into the end zone. The score had been set up three plays earlier by a
26 yard pass from Boryla to Miles Moore. In the game, Boryla
completed 17 of 30 passes for 229 yards.
On the second play from scrimmage after Sanderson's touchdown,
strong safety Randy Poltl intercepted a Mike Biscotti pass to set up a
31 yard scoring run by Scott Laidlaw on the next play. From
placement position, holder Steve Murray ran for a two-point
conversion and Stanford led 15-0. Only 52 seconds had elapsed since
the Cardinals' first louchdown.
Garcia Kicks
After receiving Garcia's kick-off, the Rainbows marched 44 yards
before the Stanford defense held on fourth and two at their own 33.
The Cardinals' next drive was stopped when linebacker Bill Letz
picked off an Ottmar pass at Hawaii's 37. Ottmar completed eight of
eleven passes for 95 yards.
Stanford took over again two plays later when Murray intercepted
a Biscotti pass and ran it back 31 yards to Hawaii's 35. The
interception began the drive which ended in Winesberry's 17 yard TD
sprint. The half ended unspectacularly six plays later with Stanford
ahead 22 0.
Beginning the second half, the Rainbows drove 60 yards to the
Stanford 19 before the Cardinal defense halted running back Albert
Holmes on fourth and one. During the game, Holmes set Hawaii's
record for the most yards gained in a season (1146). Having taken
over possession, Stanford marched to the Hawaii 14 and a 21 yard
Garcia field goal capped the drive.
Rainbows Move
On their next possession, the Rainbows had moved 41 yards when
Holmes was tackled for an eight yard loss on a fourth down, fake field
goal attempt.
The opponents then traded errors. Forrie Martin recovered a
Holmes fumble, but Stanford kept the ball for only three plays before
Harold Stringert intercepted a Boryla pass. Three plays later, Doc
Blanchard picked off a Tim Feigh pass. Stanford made no progress on
four passes to Cross and the Rainbows took over on their own 30.
Hawaii marched 56 yards before Feigh passed 14 yards over Charlie
McCloud to Aran Ahu for a touchdown.
Hawaii Recovers
Hawaii recovered an onside kick which had hit Stanford's Max
Goldstein and bounced back into Rainbow territory. The Hawaiians
failed to capitalize on their advantage because Murray intercepted a
Feigh pass on the Rainbow's first play from scrimmage. Ottmar then
floated a 37 yard touchdown pass to Don Alvarado who stood all
alone as Cross was heavily covered. Murray kicked the conversion and
the game ended nine seconds later after one more Rainbow play.
