# Cards Post Winning Year
## 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
HONOLULU - The Stanford
football team proved last weekend
that the days of old-fashioned,
hang-loose football are not dead.
They showed that players can be
allowed freedom both on and off
the field without sacrificing
victory.
Heroes of the game, including
Eric Cross, Mike Boryla, Rod
Garcia, and Steve Murray, all
acted as people instead of
machines in leading the way to
the win.
On the sideline during the
fourth quarter Cross didn't seem
as concerned about his becoming
the Pac-B's leading receiver as did
his cheering teammates.
Eric summed it up after the
game by saying "it wouldn't have
meant that much to me except to
know that everyone was behind
me."
Top Receiver
When the chance for the top
receiving slot drew near, the
players on the Stanford bench
counted down the numbers.
Eventually, Boryla & Co. put
Cross' success ahead of scoring,
paying him the compliment of
throwing to him behind the line
on a fourth down play just so he
could beat out Steve Sweeney,
who caught the pass that meant
defeat in the Big Game for the
Cardinals.
Boryla, happily talking to fans
after the game, seemed confident

the Pac-8 would not make this
game be his last hurrah. If the
conference does give him another
year of eligibility he will be, in the
words of Cross, "a genuine
Hesiman trophy candidate."
Boryla's great day came after a
Thursday surfing experience
which left his throwing in Friday's
practice so shaky that he said
Cross was throwing the ball back
in practice better than he was
passing it. But he recovered in
time to ensure his spot as the
nation's fourth leading passer.
Surf Bum
Murray, looking like a surf
burn, also had an interesting final
game. In addition to two
interceptions, holding for
Garcia's monumental boots, and
running for a two-point
conversion, Murray had the rare
pleasure of kicking the final extra
point.
Garcia held for the conversion
in a reversal of the pair's usual
roles. "It was a spur-of-the
moment thing," said Murray. "We
decided to do it late in the third
quarter if we got the chance, so
we didn't have any time to
practice."
Murray kicked the ball straight
through even so, although the
boot was not exactly as long as
Garcia's conversions.
Garcia Thrilled
Garcia thrilled the Hawaiian
fans by booting two extra points
over the clock and out of the

stadium, the ball last seen heading
toward Mexico.
Garcia had a hard time
reaching the locker room after the
game because of all the autograph
seekers and Stanford fans (mostly
ladies) who congratulated him on
both the kicks and the generous
act of letting Murray kick the
final conversion, unbeknownst to
Coach Jack Christiansen.
Many other players stayed on
the field for up to one-half hour
following the game, rapping with
adult fans, Hawaiian children, and
members of the Hawaii football
team in an unusual display of
good will.
For the many juniors and
sophomores, the game was "the
first of 13 straight" as Randy
Poltl put it. The 13th straight win,
of course, will be in the 1974
Rose Bowl.
Heroes
Many of the heroes were
underclassmen. Gordon Riegel
was all over the field from his
linebacker position, making
tackles, blocking a pass, and
sacking the three Hawaii
quarterbacks.
John Winesberry had his best
game since his injury and
hopefully this game is just a
preview of how he will perform
next year.
Scott Laidlaw, a sophomore,
ran 31 yards for a touchdown.
Interestingly enough, Laidlaw was
highlighted by ABC's "College
Football '72" program as one of
the top freshmen football players
in the land, which must have
come as news to him.
While the juniors look towards
future Rose Bowls, the seniors
simply savored the victory and
their Hawaiian vacation, which
lasted well into this week for
many of the players, who were
given open-ended return tickets.

THE SHAFT — Eric Cross, shown here in an earlier contest with USC, has been overlooked in most
post-season all-star teams as well as the Shrine Game. Cross broke the Pac-Eight record for receptions in
the Cards' win over Hawaii last weekend. The sure-handed senior receiver had 14 catches, breaking the
record held by Jack Shraub (USC) and Gene Washington (Stanford) of 13. Cross also finished the season
with 53 receptions to lead the conference in that category.
