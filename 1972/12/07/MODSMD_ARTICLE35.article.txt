HONOLULU — When Stanford's football players trounced Hawaii
after enjoying the pleasures of the Waikiki beach earlier in the week, it
was a great victory for the coaching philosophy of Jack Christiansen,
who became the first Stanford coach since Chuck Taylor to sport a
winning record in his first year.
Chris allowed his players great freedom before the game, even
allowing them to spend Friday night "on the town." He also said that
he would allow his players to motivate themselves for a victory.
Many, including Hawaii's coach, didn't think the players would be
ready to play football Saturday.
But they were.
Chris Liked
Coach Christiansen is better-liked by his players than was John
Ralston, who had some troubles before the 1971 Rose Bowl when his
players felt he was not allowing them enough freedom. Now it appears
that Chris' style may be able to succeed just as Ralston's did.
Christiansen, Dean of Admissions Fred Hargadon, and Athletic
Director Joe Ruetz, were the featured guests at an alumni party at a
posh Waikiki hotel Saturday night.
The party, at which intoxicated alumni went around congratulating
everyone who looked like a football player, was just one of several
"scenes" for the jet-setting alumni.
Early Day
Earlier in the day they had been at the game, wearing T-shirts
reading "STANFORD" on the front and carrying an ad for a Hawaiian
beer on the back. They also sported their "INDIANS" buttons which
look like "VENCEREMOS" tags from a distance, cheered Prince
Lightfoot, and generally had their version of a good time.
Maybe the worst thing about being a Stanford student is knowing
that some day we'll all be alumni. After seeing the grads in action, we
have to wonder whether the Hawaiian natives are right when they
discriminate against mainlanders in hiring.
However, the University of Hawaii certainly does not discriminate
against mainlanders on the football team, as there were many,
including seven from the Chicago Catholic League. The University
takes football seriously, spending an estimated $400,000 per year on
the team.
Hawaiians of all races take their sports seriously, backing their
teams the same way San Francisco natives once backed their Giants.
The citizens of Oahu are going into debt to pay for a new
50,000-seat stadium to be completed about 1974. The goal of the new
palace will be to attract big-league baseball and football teams.
Baseball
Currently, the University of Hawaii, the Islanders' AAA baseball
team, and several Honolulu high schools all use rickety Honolulu
Stadium, site of the Cards' win Saturday, to play their games.
Honolulu Stadium is the epitome of a minor-league ballpark. It's a
wooden firetrap with 55 billboards. The acoustics are such that crowd
noise becomes a major roar.
The stadium, as well as the fervor with which Hawaiians support
their teams, is a throwback to the past, when the biggest thing in
many American towns was minor-league baseball.
The city of Honolulu is also somewhat ordinary. But the white
sands and clear blue waters of Waikiki, which really isn't as bad a
tourist trap as it is made out, are treasures no one should live without
seeing.

Lightfoot, and generally had their version of a good time.
Maybe the worst thing about being a Stanford student is knowing
that some day we'll all be alumni. After seeing the grads in action, we
have to wonder whether the Hawaiian natives are right when they
discriminate against mainlanders in hiring.
However, the University of Hawaii certainly does not discriminate
against mainlanders on the football team, as there were many,
including seven from the Chicago Catholic League. The University
takes football seriously, spending an estimated $400,000 per year on
the team.
Hawaiians of all races take their sports seriously, backing their
teams the same way San Francisco natives once backed their Giants.
The citizens of Oahu are going into debt to pay for a new
50,000-seat stadium to be completed about 1974. The goal of the new
palace will be to attract big-league baseball and football teams.
Baseball
Currently, the University of Hawaii, the Islanders' AAA baseball
team, and several Honolulu high schools all use rickety Honolulu
Stadium, site of the Cards' win Saturday, to play their games.
Honolulu Stadium is the epitome of a minor-league ballpark. It's a
wooden firetrap with 55 billboards. The acoustics are such that crowd
noise becomes a major roar.
The stadium, as well as the fervor with which Hawaiians support
their teams, is a throwback to the past, when the biggest thing in
many American towns was minor-league baseball.
The city of Honolulu is also somewhat ordinary. But the white
sands and clear blue waters of Waikiki, which really isn't as bad a
tourist trap as it is made out, are treasures no one should live without
seeing.
HONOLULU — When Stanford's football players trounced Hawaii
after enjoying the pleasures of the Waikiki beach earlier in the week, it
was a great victory for the coaching philosophy of Jack Christiansen,
who became the first Stanford coach since Chuck Taylor to sport a
winning record in his first year.
Chris allowed his players great freedom before the game, even
allowing them to spend Friday night "on the town." He also said that
he would allow his players to motivate themselves for a victory.
Many, including Hawaii's coach, didn't think the players would be
ready to play football Saturday.
But they were.
Chris Liked
Coach Christiansen is better-liked by his players than was John
Ralston, who had some troubles before the 1971 Rose Bowl when his
players felt he was not allowing them enough freedom. Now it appears
that Chris' style may be able to succeed just as Ralston's did.
Christiansen, Dean of Admissions Fred Hargadon, and Athletic
Director Joe Ruetz, were the featured guests at an alumni party at a
posh Waikiki hotel Saturday night.
The party, at which intoxicated alumni went around congratulating
everyone who looked like a football player, was just one of several
"scenes" for the jet-setting alumni.
Early Day
Earlier in the day they had been at the game, wearing T-shirts
reading "STANFORD" on the front and carrying an ad for a Hawaiian
beer on the back. They also sported their "INDIANS" buttons which
look like "VENCEREMOS" tags from a distance, cheered Prince
Lightfoot, and generally had their version of a good time.
