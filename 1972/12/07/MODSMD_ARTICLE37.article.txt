## Frosh Swim Talent 
### Mike Chasson 
The Stanford swimming team
will be facing one of the toughest
dual meet schedules ever
attempted by any collegiate team
next January and February.
In January they will face on
consecutive weekends
Washington, Indiana, and Santa
Clara Swim Club. The meet
against the Huskies, last year's
sixth place NCAA finisher, will be
in Seattle.
The Cards will face Indiana,
the defending NCAA Champion at
the Encina pools on January 20.
Indiana will be shooting for its
fifth straight NCAA title. Their
squad includes five Olympic
medal winners and a dual meet
win streak that stretches on and
on.
Santa Clara Powerful
The last meet of the month is
against Santa Clara, the most
powerful AAU swim club in the
country. Many of Stanford's stars
swim for Santa Clara in the
summer. Santa Clara will send a
powerful squad of high school
stars against the Cards, including
some who have placed in the
AAU National Championships and
Olympic trials.
In February the Cards host
their two Pacific-Eight arch-rivals
UCLA and USC on successive
Saturday's. The Trojans were
nosed out for the NCAA title last
year by Indiana, while the Bruins
finished fourth. Stanford will be
out to avenge last year's lopsided
defeats to the Southland pair.
Stanford is able to take on
such a tough schedule primarily
because they recruited one of the
finest freshmen crops in the
country, as only Indiana's group
may be better.
Top Recruit
The top recruit has to be John
Hencken from Cupertino High
School. Hencken won a gold and a
bronze at Munich and holds the
world record in the 200 meter
breastroke.
Together with Brian Job,
winner of seven NCAA gold
medals over the last three years

and one of the most outstanding
swimmers in Stanford history, the
Cards will be tough to beat in the
breastroke.
In the freestyle events the
Cardinals picked-up at least five
swimmers who recorded excellent
high school times and will give
Stanford the depth it needs.
Leading this group was Richard
Cook from Santa Clara High
School and Steve Strong from
Tuscon, Arizona.
Cook Fast
Cook recorded two of the
fastest high school times in the
country last year in both the 200
and 400 free. His 1.41.8 time in
the 200 will give Stanford a
blue-chipper where they need it
the most.
Strong has the fastest time on
the team in 1650 with a best of
16.04.0. This would have placed
him in the finals at last year's
NCAA's. Strong can also go a
tough 500 and 400 IM.
Paul Clark, Tom Crema, and
Ron Longinotti were all high
school Ail-Americans who went
great 200 and 400 free times last
year. Clark is the most versatile of
the three being able to go
backstroke and IM if called on.
They will give the Cardinals
needed depth in the middle
distance and distance events.
Clark, who was the slowest of
the three in high school, has
impressed both head coach Jim
Gaughran and assistant coach Jeff
Hammett with his hard work in
practice and the great
improvement he has made since
coming to Stanford. He is
expected by both to be a real
sleeper for the Cardinals in those
dual meets next year.
Helping Hand
These five freestylers will give a
helping hand to last years most
surprising swimmer junior Terry
Sutton. Sutton came out of
nowhere last year to defeat USC
and UCLA swimmers in those
dual meets last year. His time of
9.40.3 in the 1000 free was a 20
second drop from the year before.
He dropped his 1650 time 40
seconds to 16.16.57 to place in
the finals at NCAA's. He set
Stanford records in both the 1000
and 1650 and will be shooting for
the 500 record this season.
In the sprints Stanford boasts
three sprinters who placed in the
50 free at the NCAA's last year.
These are Martin Pedley, Dean

Anderson and Steve Carey. It is
hoped all three will repeat in the
50 and place in the 100 as well.
Pedley placed third in the 100
two years ago to set a Stanford
record of 45.71 and anchored the
Stanford medley relay which
holds the NCAA record in a 44.8.
In the backstroke, Randy
Whitchurch, the most outstanding
freshman swimmer of 1972, leads
the way. Whitchurch had a great
summer placing fifth in 100 back
at the Olympic Trials.
Whitchurch placed in the
NCAA's in the 200 last year and is
expected to be tough in both
backstroke events this season.
Jack Deppe, a Pac-8 finalist in
the 200, will lend depth and
should improve in both events.
If the Cards have a question
mark it is in the butterfly where
they have Rick Longinotti and
John Stalker returning.
Longonotti swam great at the
NCAA's, making the finals in the

100 fly and recorded a great 49.4
medley relay fly split.
Stalker also swam well at
NCAA's recording a 51.6 in the
100 and a 1.55.84 in the 200.
However, both swam poorly in
the meet last Saturday, thus they
remain a question mark.
Gaughran Believes
In looking at this year's squad
Gaughran believes that the
attitude of the team is excellent.
He attributes it, in great part, to
the numerous freshmen who are
swimming this year. He states,
"The freshmen have brought in a
great attitude that has spread to
the entire team."
He emphasized that the quality
of the freshmen also has increased
the competitiveness of the
workouts which will only help the
team get better.
Gaughran wouldn't make any
predictions about this season, all
he would say is "it will be an
interesting year."*
