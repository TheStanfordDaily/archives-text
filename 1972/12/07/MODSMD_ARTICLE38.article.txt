# Job Wins Twice
## Swimmers Open Season 
### MIKE CHASSON 
The Stanford swimming team kicked off what
should be one of its' most exciting seasons ever by
recording some excellent early season times in its
own Stanford Invitational Championships.
The two day meet composed of the events that
are swum in the NCAA Championships, included
swimmers from California, University of Pacific, and
the Foothill Aquatic Club.
The best times were in the distance events, which
is to be expected since good sprint times come later
in the season when the workload is decreased.
Sutton Stars
Leading the way for the Cardinals was junior
Terry Sutton with three wins. Sutton captured the
500 free, the 1650 free, and the 200 fly.
The 500 was an excellent race as Sutton battled
three of Stanford's excellent freshmen; Paul Clark,
Steve Strong and Richard Cook.
Letting Strong, Clark and Cook set che pace,
Sutton came on fast in the last 100 yards to win in
an excellent 4.49.3. Clark and Strong battled to the
wire with Clark getting second in 4.50.5 on a judges
decision to Strong's 4.50.1. Cook, the early leader
faded to fourth and finished in 4.55.5. Cook came
back, however, on Saturday to win the 200 in
1.48.6.
In the 1650 Sutton, Strong and Clark were close
for the first 1000 yards with Sutton then pulling
away to an easy 16.44.8 win. Strong and Clark
battled it out once again for second with Clark
pulling away in the last 100 to finish in 16.58.7, as
Strong recorded a 17.01.3.
Coach Jim Gaughran was very pleased with these
distance times noting that Sutton is continuing to
show the form that marked his amazing
improvements last year.
Breastroker Brian Job and Backstroke Randy

Whitchurch both were double winners with good
early season times.
Job, the NCAA record holder in both the 100 and
200 breast, had two close races with Olympic gold
medal winner John Hencken.
In the 100 Job, using his great start and turns,
nipped Hencken 59.4 to 59.6â€”both amazing early
season swims for a sprint.
Job Wins
In the 200 breast Job took the lead from the
start and was never headed in winning with a 2.09.2
to Hencken's 2.11.9. Hencken did not go away from
the meet without a win, however, as he defeated
Job in the 200 IM. Hencken won in 2.02.2, as Job
finished third in 2.03.8.
Whitchurch cruised to a pair of easy wins in the
100 and 200 backstrokes. In the 100 Whitchurch
won in 55.6 with Svendsen of Cal and Jack Deppe
his closest competitors in 58.2 and 58.5
respectively. Whitchurch notched a 2.00.5 in the
200 to defeat Deppe at 2.05.9.
Gaughran, in assessing Job's performance, stated,
"I was happy to see Brian do so well. Many people
were wondering how he would do following his
personally disappointing Olympic Games
performance." Job's great swims indicated that
Stanford once again will have the best two
breastrokers in the country with Hencken also
swimming so well.
The butterfly and sprint free times were not
impressive but Gaughran expressed confidence both
would improve as the sprinters get more rest later in
the season and butterfliers Rick Longinotti and
John Stalker round into shape.
The team will travel to Hawaii over the quarter
break for a two week training period. They will
open the 1973 season with an intrasquad meet on
January 6.
