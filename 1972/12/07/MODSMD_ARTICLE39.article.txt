# Frosh Defeat CCSF
## 
### MARK WHITE 
The Stanford freshman/j.v. basketball team
opened its 1972-73 season with an 81-59 loss to
powerful USF last Friday in San Francisco, but
came back to defeat City College of San Francisco
last Monday night, 63-45.
In both games the Cardinal ability to hang onto
the ball determined, to a large extent, their success
or lack of it. For the two games the team shot a
respectable 45 percent from the field, indicating an
ability to score once they got the ball into the
offensive zone.
But whereas they committed only 13 turnovers
in the victory of CCSF, the Cards threw away the
ball 31 times against the Dons of USF.
Full Court Press
A physical, harrassing full-court press by the USF
frosh kept the Cards off balance throughout the
contest. Stanford pointmen were met deep in the
backcourt by USF's fine defensive guard, John
Curran, who was personally responsible for many of
the Stanford turnovers.
Whenever the Cardinals were able to break the
press, USF's quickness shut off any chances for fast
breaks. This appeared to wear down the Cardinals,
who looked disheartened going into the last 10
minutes of the game.
USF jumped off to a five point lead early in the
game as Stanford was quickly baffled by the Don's
full-court press. Kevin Enright, who had one of the
steadier performances for the Cardinals, finally got
Stanford on the scoreboard with a 12-foot jumper
after nearly three minutes of play.
Stanford Trails
Stanford trailed by spreads of between five and
nine points until the midway point of the first half
when USF's 6'9" center Howard Smith and 6'6"
forward Richard Johnson combined to propell USF
to a 30-14 lead.
Smith's close range jump shots and Johnson's
quick drives put the Dons into a comfortable lead
and when two Ed Schweitzer 20-foot jump shots
brought Stanford back to within seven, Smith
closed thedoorwith a three-point play near the two

minute mark. USF went in at halftime holding a
40-31 lead.
Schweitzer opened the second half with a
three-point play and minutes laterEnright
scored on a rebound to close the gap to 44-39
and it appeared Stanford might catch the Dons.
The turning point came at the 13:53 mark when
Stanford post man Mike Kehrli fouled out of the
game (and, in addition, got a technical foul).
USF Converts
Soon after, USF converted two steals into two
baskets and later made nine straight points to break
the Cardinals' backs. USF coasted the last eight
minutes to the 22 point victory as Johnson and
Smith led the Dons with 24 points, 13 rebounds and
21 points, 13 rebounds, respectively. Schweitzer led
the Cards with 19 points and 13 rebounds, Tim
Patterson collecting 11 points and Enright scoring
10.
Against CCSF Stanford looked much more
adept. The visitors jumped off to a six point lead on
three layups in the first two minutes of the game.
But at the ten minute mark the Cards suddenly
quit moving and started to commit turnovers. City
College took charge utilizing good team play and
the shooting of forward Jan Gaston, leading at the
half, 33-28. Patterson lead all scorers with 17 points
at that point.
Big Flurry
Stanford started the second half with a flurry,
scoring four points on goaltending calls and two
more on a Kehrli steal and layup, taking the lead
34-33.
The Card defense allowed CCSF only 12 points
for the half and didnotgive up more than two points
consecutively throughout the second stanza. With
five minutes left in the game, City College trailed by
15 and never made a serious bid thereafter.
Patterson hit on 10 of 15 shots and led all scorers
with 23 points, while Schweitzer had 13 points and
11 rebounds. During his brief period of play
Moroski registered tem points, Wholesteder had nine
and Enright, Kristovich, Ficcadenti, Whiting and
Kehrli each had two.

quit moving and started to commit turnovers. City
College took charge utilizing good team play and
the shooting of forward Jan Gaston, leading at the
half, 33-28. Patterson lead all scorers with 17 points
at that point.
Big Flurry
Stanford started the second half with a flurry,
scoring four points on goaltending calls and two
more on a Kehrli steal and layup, taking the lead
34-33.
The Card defense allowed CCSF only 12 points
for the half and didnotgive up more than two points
consecutively throughout the second stanza. With
five minutes left in the game, City College trailed by
15 and never made a serious bid thereafter.
Patterson hit on 10 of 15 shots and led all scorers
with 23 points, while Schweitzer had 13 points and
11 rebounds. During his brief period of play
Moroski registered tem points, Wholesteder had nine
and Enright, Kristovich, Ficcadenti, Whiting and
Kehrli each had two.
The Stanford freshman/j.v. basketball team
opened its 1972-73 season with an 81-59 loss to
powerful USF last Friday in San Francisco, but
came back to defeat City College of San Francisco
last Monday night, 63-45.
In both games the Cardinal ability to hang onto
the ball determined, to a large extent, their success
or lack of it. For the two games the team shot a
respectable 45 percent from the field, indicating an
ability to score once they got the ball into the
offensive zone.
But whereas they committed only 13 turnovers
in the victory of CCSF, the Cards threw away the
ball 31 times against the Dons of USF.
Full Court Press
A physical, harrassing full-court press by the USF
frosh kept the Cards off balance throughout the
contest. Stanford pointmen were met deep in the
backcourt by USF's fine defensive guard, John
Curran, who was personally responsible for many of
the Stanford turnovers.
Whenever the Cardinals were able to break the
press, USF's quickness shut off any chances for fast
breaks. This appeared to wear down the Cardinals,
who looked disheartened going into the last 10
minutes of the game.
USF jumped off to a five point lead early in the
game as Stanford was quickly baffled by the Don's
full-court press. Kevin Enright, who had one of the
steadier performances for the Cardinals, finally got
Stanford on the scoreboard with a 12-foot jumper
after nearly three minutes of play.
Stanford Trails
Stanford trailed by spreads of between five and
nine points until the midway point of the first half
when USF's 6'9" center Howard Smith and 6'6"
forward Richard Johnson combined to propell USF
to a 30-14 lead.
Smith's close range jump shots and Johnson's
quick drives put the Dons into a comfortable lead
and when two Ed Schweitzer 20-foot jump shots
brought Stanford back to within seven, Smith
closed thedoorwith a three-point play near the two

minute mark. USF went in at halftime holding a
40-31 lead.
Schweitzer opened the second half with a
three-point play and minutes laterEnright
scored on a rebound to close the gap to 44-39
and it appeared Stanford might catch the Dons.
The turning point came at the 13:53 mark when
Stanford post man Mike Kehrli fouled out of the
game (and, in addition, got a technical foul).
USF Converts
Soon after, USF converted two steals into two
baskets and later made nine straight points to break
the Cardinals' backs. USF coasted the last eight
minutes to the 22 point victory as Johnson and
Smith led the Dons with 24 points, 13 rebounds and
21 points, 13 rebounds, respectively. Schweitzer led
the Cards with 19 points and 13 rebounds, Tim
Patterson collecting 11 points and Enright scoring
10.
Against CCSF Stanford looked much more
adept. The visitors jumped off to a six point lead on
three layups in the first two minutes of the game.
But at the ten minute mark the Cards suddenly
quit moving and started to commit turnovers. City
College took charge utilizing good team play and
the shooting of forward Jan Gaston, leading at the
half, 33-28. Patterson lead all scorers with 17 points
at that point.
