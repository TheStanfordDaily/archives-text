# Discussion Of Genetics Planned
## Shockley, Clark Share Platform 
### DAN BRENNER 
Stanford Electrical Engineering
Prof. William Shockley and
Psychology Prof. Cedric X (Clark) will
participate in a face-to-face discussion
of genetic determination of IQ at
Monterey Peninsula College (MPC) this
afternoon.
The lectures, sponsored by the
college's social science department,
represent the first time Clark and
Shockley will appear on the same
platform.
The exact topic of this afternoon's
"debate" has stirred some confusion
on the part of participants. Yesterday
Shockley stated that he intends to
discuss "80 percent at 2000-IQ
Geneticity," which asserts that genes
contribute 82 percent towards
predicting the IQ in a group of 244
identical caucasian twins used in his
study.
Shockley said this was the same
topic he was willing to discuss in
Psychology Prof. Philip Zimbardo's
class in October. At that time Clark
said he did not want to have such a
limited area for discussion.
Clark in return invited Shockley to
a debate on a wider range of issues.
The Black Students Union here has

called on Shockley to debate his
IQ-race theories with Clark.
Shockley Leads Off
Dr. Elaine Johnson, a sociology
instructor at MPC and co-ordinator of
the discussion, said that Shockley will
lead off the presentations with his
research findings, using a panel of
pre-selected students from the college
as subjects for a demonstration.
The subjects, consisting of one
black, one oriental and three whites,
will be used to demonstrate that genes
are four times as influential as
environmental factors in determining
IQ, Shockley said. He added that the
theory he will present today is the
same as the one he has petitioned the
National Academy of Sciences to
review for statistical accuracy.
The students in the panel, all
volunteers from Johnson's sociology
class, were given special training by
Shockley assistant Gary Hahn so that
they would be able to understand the
theoretical terminology used in the
presentation.
Training Concern
Johnson voiced concern over the
training of the students. "This might
be a way to get the student panelists
to support his point of view," she
noted in a telephone interview. She

said that her department insisted on a
bi-racial panel being used in Shockley's
talk.
Shockley has agreed to take
questions from the floor after he and
Clark have spoken. It is expected that
Shockley will limit questions to the
particular research topic on which he
has agreed to speak.
Ron Barker, MPC news service
officer, said that today's discussion
will be the first time Shockey will
appear with formal opposition.
"Shockley has agreed to stay through
Clark's presentation," he noted.
"That's a concession."
Possible Boycott
He said that the junior college's
Black Student Union may boycott the
talk.
Johnson added that the local
MEChA organization intends to wear
black armbands as a sign of protest at
the discussion.
She said that several of her students
have become angry with her for having
arranged the discussion of Shockley's
research. "It seems to have become a
rallying point" for several student
minority groups, she noted.
The presentations start at 1 p.m. in
College Lecture Forum 103 and are
expected to last two hours.

Shockley will limit questions to the
particular research topic on which he
has agreed to speak.
Ron Barker, MPC news service
officer, said that today's discussion
will be the first time Shockey will
appear with formal opposition.
"Shockley has agreed to stay through
Clark's presentation," he noted.
"That's a concession."
Possible Boycott
He said that the junior college's
Black Student Union may boycott the
talk.
Johnson added that the local
MEChA organization intends to wear
black armbands as a sign of protest at
the discussion.
She said that several of her students
have become angry with her for having
arranged the discussion of Shockley's
research. "It seems to have become a
rallying point" for several student
minority groups, she noted.
The presentations start at 1 p.m. in
College Lecture Forum 103 and are
expected to last two hours.
Stanford Electrical Engineering
Prof. William Shockley and
Psychology Prof. Cedric X (Clark) will
participate in a face-to-face discussion
of genetic determination of IQ at
Monterey Peninsula College (MPC) this
afternoon.
The lectures, sponsored by the
college's social science department,
represent the first time Clark and
Shockley will appear on the same
platform.
The exact topic of this afternoon's
"debate" has stirred some confusion
on the part of participants. Yesterday
Shockley stated that he intends to
discuss "80 percent at 2000-IQ
Geneticity," which asserts that genes
contribute 82 percent towards
predicting the IQ in a group of 244
identical caucasian twins used in his
study.
Shockley said this was the same
topic he was willing to discuss in
Psychology Prof. Philip Zimbardo's
class in October. At that time Clark
said he did not want to have such a
limited area for discussion.
Clark in return invited Shockley to
a debate on a wider range of issues.
The Black Students Union here has

called on Shockley to debate his
IQ-race theories with Clark.
Shockley Leads Off
Dr. Elaine Johnson, a sociology
instructor at MPC and co-ordinator of
the discussion, said that Shockley will
lead off the presentations with his
research findings, using a panel of
pre-selected students from the college
as subjects for a demonstration.
The subjects, consisting of one
black, one oriental and three whites,
will be used to demonstrate that genes
are four times as influential as
environmental factors in determining
IQ, Shockley said. He added that the
theory he will present today is the
same as the one he has petitioned the
National Academy of Sciences to
review for statistical accuracy.
The students in the panel, all
volunteers from Johnson's sociology
class, were given special training by
Shockley assistant Gary Hahn so that
they would be able to understand the
theoretical terminology used in the
presentation.
Training Concern
Johnson voiced concern over the
training of the students. "This might
be a way to get the student panelists
to support his point of view," she
noted in a telephone interview. She

said that her department insisted on a
bi-racial panel being used in Shockley's
talk.
Shockley has agreed to take
questions from the floor after he and
Clark have spoken. It is expected that
Shockley will limit questions to the
particular research topic on which he
has agreed to speak.
