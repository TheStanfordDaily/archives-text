# Hoopsters Split Two Games
## 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
Stanford's young basketball
team made a lot of mistakes in its
first two games, but the Cards
emerged from what could have
been a disaster with one win, one
loss, and considerable optimism
for the remainder of the season.
Stanford lost to an outstanding
USF team 83-68 Friday night in
San Francisco but rebounded to
defeat Arizona 75-68 in the Card's
home opener Monday night in
Maples Pavilion.
Mike Mann led the Stanford
scorers in both games. The 6-9
junior forward scored 16 points
against USF and poured in 24
against Arizona. Mann connected
on 18 of his 33 field goal attempts
in the two games and also grabbed
21 rebounds.
Mann's outstanding play
partially offset a rash of turnovers
and some of the worst free throw
shooting in recent Stanford
history. The Cards lost the ball 41
times in the two games and
converted only 21 of 41 free
throws, including 9 of 23 against
Arizona.
Sloppy Victory
But Stanford's coaches were
able to find some consolation in
those statistics. "In the past, if we
played that sloppy and missed so
many free throws we would never
had a chance to win," said
assistant coach Bub Bowling.
"The fact that we did win (against
Arizona) proves that we were
doing a lot of things well."
One of the good things was the

Cards' excellent play inside. Mann
and seven-foot sophomore Rich
Kelly scored well and did a good
job on the boards, even against
USF's towering front line of
Kevin Restani (6-10), Eric
Femsten (6-9), and Byron (Snake)
Jones (6-9).
"Kelly and Mann complement
each other," said assistant coach
Billy Jones. Mann, who tended to
be extremely inconsistent last
year, seems to be calmed by
Kelly's presence.
"Last year if Mike didn't block
a shot, nobody would," explains
Bowling. "This year Kelly helps
him out."
Kelly did more than "help
out" against USF. He blocked
eight of the Dons' shots and also
tied Jones for rebound honors
with 14. Against Arizona he
grabbed 10 rebounds and blocked

four shots. Kelly scored 12 points
in the USF game and 14 against
the Wildcats.
After Kelly won the opening
tip against the Dons and Dave
Frost sank two foul shots to give
the Cards a 2-0 lead, Stanford had
to fight an uphill battle. USF
scored 11 straight points to lead
11-2 and the Cards never came
closer than five points.
USF's Mike Quick led all
scorers with 25 points. Restani
and Jones each added 20 as the
Dons displayed a balanced attack
which could make them the top
team on the West Coast besides
UCLA.
Stanford controlled the
Arizona game most of the way.
Steve Shupe's eight foot hook
shot with 4:45 remaining in the
first half gave the Cards a 29-28
lead which they never

relinquished.
Mann led all scorers with 24
points. Arizona's two hot
shooting freshman guards, Eric
Money and Coniel Norman,
scored 20 and 14 respectively
while Kelly and Frost each tallied
14 for Stanford. Frost scored 12
of his 14 points in the first half,
when he made six of ten field goal
attempts
Gilberg Scores
Sophomore guard Mark Gilberg
got on the scoreboard for the first
time against Arizona. Gilberg
canned two 20-footers in the
second half, and Stanford coach
Howie Dallmar hopes that Gilberg
will continue to look toward the
basket. "Mark has been so
concerned with playmaking that
he hasn't even thought about
shooting," said Dallmar.
Gilberg's overall effectiveness
was markedly improved when he
loosened up in the second half.
Gilberg's backcourt partner,
sophomore Mel Arterberry,
showed some flashy moves in
both games and played excellent
defense. Senior Bob Buell also
played steady basketball,
contributing eight points against
USF and nine against Arizona.
Stanford won't play again until
Saturday night, Dec. 16 when
they host San Jose State. The
Cards' busy Christmas schedule
continues in Colorado on Dec. 18
and 19 when Stanford plays
Denver and Colorado State.
The Cards return home for
games against Fordham and St.
Mary's on Dec. 22 and 23

Denver and Colorado State.
The Cards return home for
games against Fordham and St.
Mary's on Dec. 22 and 23
Stanford's young basketball
team made a lot of mistakes in its
first two games, but the Cards
emerged from what could have
been a disaster with one win, one
loss, and considerable optimism
for the remainder of the season.
Stanford lost to an outstanding
USF team 83-68 Friday night in
San Francisco but rebounded to
defeat Arizona 75-68 in the Card's
home opener Monday night in
Maples Pavilion.
Mike Mann led the Stanford
scorers in both games. The 6-9
junior forward scored 16 points
against USF and poured in 24
against Arizona. Mann connected
on 18 of his 33 field goal attempts
in the two games and also grabbed
21 rebounds.
Mann's outstanding play
partially offset a rash of turnovers
and some of the worst free throw
shooting in recent Stanford
history. The Cards lost the ball 41
times in the two games and
converted only 21 of 41 free
throws, including 9 of 23 against
Arizona.
Sloppy Victory
But Stanford's coaches were
able to find some consolation in
those statistics. "In the past, if we
played that sloppy and missed so
many free throws we would never
had a chance to win," said
assistant coach Bub Bowling.
"The fact that we did win (against
Arizona) proves that we were
doing a lot of things well."
One of the good things was the

Cards' excellent play inside. Mann
and seven-foot sophomore Rich
Kelly scored well and did a good
job on the boards, even against
USF's towering front line of
Kevin Restani (6-10), Eric
Femsten (6-9), and Byron (Snake)
Jones (6-9).
"Kelly and Mann complement
each other," said assistant coach
Billy Jones. Mann, who tended to
be extremely inconsistent last
year, seems to be calmed by
Kelly's presence.
"Last year if Mike didn't block
a shot, nobody would," explains
Bowling. "This year Kelly helps
him out."
Kelly did more than "help
out" against USF. He blocked
eight of the Dons' shots and also
tied Jones for rebound honors
with 14. Against Arizona he
grabbed 10 rebounds and blocked

four shots. Kelly scored 12 points
in the USF game and 14 against
the Wildcats.
After Kelly won the opening
tip against the Dons and Dave
Frost sank two foul shots to give
the Cards a 2-0 lead, Stanford had
to fight an uphill battle. USF
scored 11 straight points to lead
11-2 and the Cards never came
closer than five points.
USF's Mike Quick led all
scorers with 25 points. Restani
and Jones each added 20 as the
Dons displayed a balanced attack
which could make them the top
team on the West Coast besides
UCLA.
Stanford controlled the
Arizona game most of the way.
Steve Shupe's eight foot hook
shot with 4:45 remaining in the
first half gave the Cards a 29-28
lead which they never

relinquished.
Mann led all scorers with 24
points. Arizona's two hot
shooting freshman guards, Eric
Money and Coniel Norman,
scored 20 and 14 respectively
while Kelly and Frost each tallied
14 for Stanford. Frost scored 12
of his 14 points in the first half,
when he made six of ten field goal
attempts
Gilberg Scores
Sophomore guard Mark Gilberg
got on the scoreboard for the first
time against Arizona. Gilberg
canned two 20-footers in the
second half, and Stanford coach
Howie Dallmar hopes that Gilberg
will continue to look toward the
basket. "Mark has been so
concerned with playmaking that
he hasn't even thought about
shooting," said Dallmar.
Gilberg's overall effectiveness
was markedly improved when he
loosened up in the second half.
Gilberg's backcourt partner,
sophomore Mel Arterberry,
showed some flashy moves in
both games and played excellent
defense. Senior Bob Buell also
played steady basketball,
contributing eight points against
USF and nine against Arizona.
Stanford won't play again until
Saturday night, Dec. 16 when
they host San Jose State. The
Cards' busy Christmas schedule
continues in Colorado on Dec. 18
and 19 when Stanford plays
Denver and Colorado State.
