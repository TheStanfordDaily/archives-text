In the intramural touch football championships held last Sunday
afternoon, the Zetes and the Theta Delts won the men's 'A' and 'B'
divisions, and the undefeated Zulus captured the women's flag
football crown.
In the afternoon's closest contest, Zete quarterback Randy Whittell
lofted a scoring strike to Dan McGanney with three minutes left in the
game to give the Zetes a comeback 18-13 win over the Smegma Delts.
Whittell connected with Don Bauhofer and Tim Howard for
touchdowns earlier in the game. Smegma quarterback Andy Bielanski
threw two touchdown passes in a losing effort.
The strong passing arm of quarterback Marc Allyn carried the
Theta Delts past the KA's in the 'B' championships, 31-13. Allyn
threw five TD's in the afternoon, three to Joel Plaisance, and two to
Bruce Robertson. Kirk Cummings hauled in three interceptions for
the Theta Delts.
The Zulus overwhelmed the Lathrop Hornets, 19-0, in the
women's flag championships. Zulu quarterback Diane Sheng picked
apart the Hornet secondary with accurate passing.
