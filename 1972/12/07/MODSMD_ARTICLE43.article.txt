# Eleanor Maccoby Balances Roles
## 
### GLENN KRAMON 
At a glance, Eleanor Maccoby
could pass for the stereotype of a
middle-aged American mother.
She wears conservative, dark-hued
pantsuits or long dresses. She cuts
her gray hair moderately short.
She wears ordinary black-rimmed
glasses. Her pleasant smile and
kindly expression almost make
you want to call her "Mom."
But this description is by no
means complete. Dr. Maccoby,
one of the country's foremost
developmental psychologists,
represents the model progressive
teacher and researcher. "She is a
ball of fire, and also very nice,"
said Dr. Robert Sears, her
long-time colleague and co-author
of Patterns of Child Rearing.
Maccoby is both researcher and
teacher. Her name pops up in
almost every social and child
psychology textbook as the
author of widely-acclaimed
experiments on the effects of
television on children,
child-rearing practices, and the
special development of attention.
"She is one of the few people
in developmental psychology who
does well-designed research. You
can trace that to the fact that she
was brought up a social
psychologist," said one of her
former students, now an assistant
professor of psychology.
'Constant Figure'
"She's the person you go to if
you want to know who did what
and where to find it." He
observed that Maccoby has "kept

the developmental psychology
department here going. She has
been the only constant figure
here" in the last decade.
Maccoby calls herself a
psychologist of "broad rather
than specialized interest. I
continue to be a generalist at a
time when everyone else is a
specialist â€” a jack-of-aJI-trades and
a master of none."
Her former student noted that
Maccoby is often "intimidating
when she doesn't mean to be
because she knows so much."
"Be patient and humble in
research," she advises. "No one
person is going to set the world on
fire with what he does."
Maccoby considers her present
research with Stanford colleague
Dr. Carol Jacklin, a study of six
differences and attitudes towards
them, as "promising in terms of
its potential. 1 am irritated by
widespread assumptions that
women are more passive than
men; at the same time I don't
believe that every sex difference
can be attributed to role," she
said.
Maccoby's activity does not
stop outside the laboratory in
which hundreds of area mothers
and children have undergone her
experiments. She serves on the
Stanford Women's Caucus for
improvement of faculty women's
rights. She is one of a minority of
women on the Child Development
National Advisory Committee, the
Board of Governors of the Society
for Research in Child
Development, the American
Psychological Association, Phi
Betta Kappa, and Sigma Xi.
Anti-War Activist
She has also been active in
opposing war. As early as age 16,
Maccoby worked for the National
Council for the Prevention of War

in her home town, Tacoma,
Wash., where she led a large group
of students to try to break up an
Army Day parade at a local
military base "to the discomfiture
of my father, a small businessman
in Tacoma, who had to try to
explain the newspaper accounts to
his Kiwanis Club friends."
What Maccoby learns in
research she rapidly conveys to
the 300 students in her Psych 111
class. "I try to read something
new before each class to give the
material a new slant," she said.
She aims towards establishing a
clear outline and sticking to it,
without getting "too discursive"
when pausing to answer a
question.
Maccoby recalls "being
over-prepared . . . sticking too
close to my notes due to
nervousness" when she began
lecturing in the Department of
Social Relations at Harvard in
1950. Snecame to Stanford eight
years later.
She exposes her fascination
with the "endlessly refreshing way
my children thing" particularly
when she arrives at one of her
own experiments during a lecture.
Her eyes twinkle as she tells of
the pregnant mother whose
suddenly frightened unborn child
kicked the tray off its mother's
lap at a garden party; or the
two-year-old who believed that by
not looking into the eyes of a
stranger, she could become
invisible to that person; or the
three-year-old who, in a tape
testing his speech ability, repeated
a profanity his father had
muttered earlier that morning.
Enjoys Teaching
Maccoby enjoys teaching,
especially when she can get
students to "throw themselves
into something." She makes a

special effort to meet with those
who show particular interest in
the research of her department.
She believes that the type of
students she teaches has changed
over the past 20 years. "In the
1950'5, students were more
docile," she said, noting that
often what she lectured about
would go "through the student's
ear and down into the pencil
without making much of an
impact in transition."
"Even three or four years ago,"
she continued, "it was uphill work
to get students to be interested.
People were turned off by normal
education. They were distracted
by terrible feelings about the
war."
Maccoby feared then that
"students would become
privatists," and she started to
question her own ability to
interest classes.
But she says that students
today have started to renew her
confidence. Lively debates occur
much more often at her lectures.
She takes in hypotheses on the
podium, and, like a computer
with an enormous memory bank,
she evaluates them and feeds them
back to the audience with a

textbook chapter's worth of
experimental findings to back up
her criticisms.
Maccoby is also the kindly,
graying mother that one would
have guessed her to be in the first
place.
She and her husband, Nathan
Maccoby, a professor in the
Communication department, have
raised three children. The eldest,
at 32, lives with her husband in
Washington, D.C. A daughter, 17,
and son, 14, live with their
parents on Mayfield Avenue.
Maccoby enjoys music, so she
has found the time to "play the
guitar badly over many years,"
and sing in a local madrigal group,
and also play pop music in which
she particularly likes singing blues.
"I am lost in admiration for
students who play the guitar
well," she says."I like the kind of
music they like."
"She has done a good job of
handling two conflicting roles,"
says her former student. Some
know her as "into the women's
movement" and as a progressive
researcher dealing with current,
controversial subjects, while
others see Maccoby more as a
middle-aged mother.
