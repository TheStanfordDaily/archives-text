# Shopping Center Meeting
## 
### 
Midpeninsula civic leaders will
meet on the campus next week to
discuss the future of the Stanford
Shopping Center.
Robert R. Augsburger,
University Vice President for
Business and Finance, has invited
55 municipal officials and others
to discuss a consulting firm's
preliminary proposals for
modernization of the center to
insure that it remains competitive.
The meeting will be held
I Saturday, Dec. 16.

University officials stress that
their plans are only in a very
preliminary stage, and describe
the conference as an attempt to
involve Community leaders in
Stanford's development planning
process, something the University
is often criticized for not doing.
The Rouse Company, of
Columbia, Md., creators of a "new
town" there and of several large
shopping centers in the East, has
studied the center in recent
months.
