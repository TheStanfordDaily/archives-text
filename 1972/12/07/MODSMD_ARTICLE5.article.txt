# Goodall Discusses Primate Behavior

Equipped with films and slides of the
chimpanzee family she has studied for over a
decade, noted zoologist Jane van Lawick-Goodall
spoke to an overflow crowd at Mem Aud Tuesday
night.
Goodall, a visiting professor in Human Biology,
discussed her work and the remarkable similarities
between humans and chimps.
In the 90-minute lecture, she retold the history
of the "Flo family," the tales of a mother chimp
and her offspring in their native Gombe Stream
Reserve in Tanzania, Africa.
"The father chimpanzee has no role in
child-rearing," Goodall explained. 'The burden is
entirely the female's."
Through a series of films taken and edited by her
husband, photographer Hugo van Lawick, Goodall
began by showing Flo, a 35-year old female chimp
feeding, grooming, and protecting her youngest
offspring, Flint, a month-old male. A few other
scenes from the early 1960's depicted Flo's older
sons at play, and Flo's daughter learning the care of
a baby.
Mother-Son Relationship
The close mother-son relationship between Flo
and Flint which developed over the years and ended
only with Flo's death was particularly touching.
Goodall also traced the development of both
female and male adolescent chimps in the family.

She described the young female as restless, searching
for male companionship even in other chimpanzee
communities during peak sexual periods.
She emphasized the struggles of the males to be
accepted by the established adult males and to
dominate adult females. 'The only stable
relationship an adolescent male has is that with
his mother," the chimpanzee specialist noted.
Closest Relative
In comparing chimps with humans, Goodall
commented that "the chimpanzee is man's closest
living relative.
"Each chimp has his own personality. We find
many of the same feelings of anger and submission
in their community," she said.
Goodall pointed out the importance of social
status to the chimpanzees. She cites "competitions
for rank or status" within the heirarchy as "the
main cause for aggressive behavior" among the
males.
She also noted the chimpanzees' preoccupation
with grooming. Several film scenes showed Flo
picking grass, ticks and other debris from the hair of
her children.
Primate Facility
Enthusiastic about completion of a primate
behavioral study facility on Stanford land, Goodall
lauded David Hamburg, Chairman of the Psychiatry
Department at the Medical Center, who introduced
her lecture.

The primate center which is scheduled to be
completed this academic year simulates the chimp's
natural environment permitting scientists to observe
normal peer-group development among the chimps
and use social manipulation to determine its effects.
"We are naming the center Gombe West and will
be able to study closely many behavioral changes in
the chimps. Experimentation in the wild is not
possible, and working in a laboratory makes it
possible," she says.
Louis S.B. Leakey
Goodall's work with chimpanzees began when
she pitched her tent in a clearing near Lake
Tanganyika in 1960. The research project was
initially arranged by world-renowned paleontologist
Dr. Louis S.B. Leakey, when Jane Goodall was a
"scientific non-entity," according to Time
magazine.
She had left school at 18 and was single when she
met Hugo van Lawick, the photographer sent to
record her work with chimps for National
Geographic. They were married in 1964, and the
next year Goodall earned her Ph.D., in the study of
animal behavior at Cambridge University.
Since her inauspicious beginnings, during which
funding was difficult to obtain and the chimps
elusive, Goodall has lectured extensively and written
two books, the most recent one entitled In the
Shadow of Man.
