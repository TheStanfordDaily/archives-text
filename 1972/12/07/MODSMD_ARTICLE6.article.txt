## Feedback

Putting together a daily newspaper is not a leisurely task. The
day-today pressures of a news-filled world make journalists'jobs very
hectic. We don't often enjoy the luxury of being able to reflect on
what we're doing for long periods of time.
At the Daily, we try to critique each other's work and the paper as
a whole, but frankly we also depend on feedback from our readers to
know what kind of job we're doing. We have one of the most easily
accessible opinions pages of any newspaper â€” everyone is urged to
submit articles and letters and most of them are printed. But we'd like
a little more general feedback so that we can serve you better. Now
that the quarter is coming to a close and we don't have to worry
about getting a paper out each night, we'd like to encourage you to let
us know what you think about the Dailys of the past quarter.
Our goal continues to be the production of a consistently
high-quality community newspaper which educates, entertains and
serves our readers. We feel we've done a fairly good job of fulfilling
this goal this quarter, but we're not satisfied. We can do better and we
intend to do better.
We hope you have enjoyed our new features such as "Bug Me,"
"Big Daddy" and the football issues. In a readership survey taken a
year ago, people indicated that they wanted more national news
coverage and bigger sports and entertainment sections and we think
we have met those requests well. We feel that our new full-page
opinions format and more frequent editorials have made the Daily
into a much more professional newspaper.
But although we are happy about our successes, we are still
disappointed about some of our failures. We have still had accuracy
and consistency problems in some of our stories. At times, we have
allowed stories to slip by us. We have overplayed or underplayed a
number of stories. And we haven't been able to establish as good a
beat system for reporters as we'd like to. These are all problems we
have recognized and are working to improve on. But I am sure there
are other problems that you, our readers, might be more aware of.
Accordingly, I'd like to request that before you take off for
vacation, you write done some comments about our performance over
the last quarter and some suggestions for the future and mail them to
us or bring them by the Daily office. Our mailing address is: The
Stanford Daily, Stanford, California 94305 and our offices are in the
Storke Student Publications Building, located at Lomita and Panama
St. near Tresidder Union. If you've got a minute, feel free to drop in
and talk with me as well. I'll be in the Daily office next Monday
through Friday from 1-4 p.m. each day. I hope to see you.
