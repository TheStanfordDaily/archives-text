# assu funds abused
## Investigation Of ASSU Responsibility 
### 
bob barker

At the Senate meeting of
Tuesday, 21 November, we were
presented with a proposed
$92,000 ASSU budget, and told it
would be voted upon at the next
meeting. Some of the
multi-thousand dollar items struck
me as being rather gross, so I
decided to investigate.
Financial Records
On Monday, 27 November, I
went to the ASSU offices and
asked to see the financial records.
I was led to the files for the
1971-72 academic year and told
that they should explain the
makeup of individual budget
items. They did.
After thumbing through a few
dozen folders filled with endless
bills and invoices for things
ranging from Black Mountain
Spring Water to storage space in a
San Jose warehouse, I had pretty
much decided that the ASSU was
just another example of a typical
bureaucratic money sponge —
certainly wasteful, but definitely
not maliciously so. Then, a
particularly thick folder caught my
eye. It was the file for the Council
of Presidents account.
What I saw there painted a very
sorry picture. First of all were the
numerous meal vouchers which
certain Council members used to
pay for their own meals out of a
fund intended to pay for the
meals of ASSU guests. Then there
were phone bills for calls ranging
from Denver, Colorado to
Atlanta, Georgia. The Council
even saw fit (perhaps with Senate
approval) to appropriate $77 of
student body funds to pay for a
bus trip to the Soledad trial.

I deemed as unduly
extravagant a payment of over
$300 to the free Press for
printing 50 copies of a 12-page
ASSU report. Two people, of
unknown affiliation, were treated
to 20 nights of lodging at Roble
Hall at student expense (a bit long
for a guest speaker). Finally, there
was the now-famous voucher for
$346 toward a "gambling debt,"
to use its own words (see Daily,
30 November).
It could not be determined
from that folder whether or not
some items were meant as "loans"
which would eventually be repaid.
Since procedures for assuring
reimbursement seem lax, this was
of secondary importance. It was
now established that at least some
former ASSU officers were loose
with funds, in my opinion.
At that point, I debated
whether or not to investigate the
matter in private, but decided that
private admissions of guilt would
not rectify the situation. Only
public disclosure (open
confrontation, if you prefer)
could provide sufficient pressure
to prevent repetition of the
wrongs.
'No Place for Kidding'
With this in mind, I informed
the Senate, on 28 November,
about what I had discovered. My
statement then, as now, was
strictly a presentation of facts. I
personally thought the "gambling
debt" to be an attempt at a joke,
but a financial record is not the
proper place for kidding. Students
have a right to know where their
$346 had been spent. I made no

charges, called for no legal action,
but rather asked for explanations
and protections against future
abuse.
How my statements were
reported in the press and radio is a
different matter. Students should
by now be aware that news
reports are meant to be taken
with a grain of salt. Limitations of

space and time prohibit the
printing of facts which could cast
a given issue in a totally different
light.
I let my actions stand. I serve
notice to students that I will
continue to speak out on
important matters. Special
interest groups should try to
accept the revelations in the spirit

in which they were made. We all
share the shame of prior wrongs
whether it be through active or
passive assent. We must now join
together to prevent them from
reoccuring. It's as simple as that.

At the Senate meeting of
Tuesday, 21 November, we were
presented with a proposed
$92,000 ASSU budget, and told it
would be voted upon at the next
meeting. Some of the
multi-thousand dollar items struck
me as being rather gross, so I
decided to investigate.
Financial Records
On Monday, 27 November, I
went to the ASSU offices and
asked to see the financial records.
I was led to the files for the
1971-72 academic year and told
that they should explain the
makeup of individual budget
items. They did.
After thumbing through a few
dozen folders filled with endless
bills and invoices for things
ranging from Black Mountain
Spring Water to storage space in a
San Jose warehouse, I had pretty
much decided that the ASSU was
just another example of a typical
bureaucratic money sponge —
certainly wasteful, but definitely
not maliciously so. Then, a
particularly thick folder caught my
eye. It was the file for the Council
of Presidents account.
What I saw there painted a very
sorry picture. First of all were the
numerous meal vouchers which
certain Council members used to
pay for their own meals out of a
fund intended to pay for the
meals of ASSU guests. Then there
were phone bills for calls ranging
from Denver, Colorado to
Atlanta, Georgia. The Council
even saw fit (perhaps with Senate
approval) to appropriate $77 of
student body funds to pay for a
bus trip to the Soledad trial.

I deemed as unduly
extravagant a payment of over
$300 to the free Press for
printing 50 copies of a 12-page
ASSU report. Two people, of
unknown affiliation, were treated
to 20 nights of lodging at Roble
Hall at student expense (a bit long
for a guest speaker). Finally, there
was the now-famous voucher for
$346 toward a "gambling debt,"
to use its own words (see Daily,
30 November).
It could not be determined
from that folder whether or not
some items were meant as "loans"
which would eventually be repaid.
Since procedures for assuring
reimbursement seem lax, this was
of secondary importance. It was
now established that at least some
former ASSU officers were loose
with funds, in my opinion.
At that point, I debated
whether or not to investigate the
matter in private, but decided that
private admissions of guilt would
not rectify the situation. Only
public disclosure (open
confrontation, if you prefer)
could provide sufficient pressure
to prevent repetition of the
wrongs.
'No Place for Kidding'
With this in mind, I informed
the Senate, on 28 November,
about what I had discovered. My
statement then, as now, was
strictly a presentation of facts. I
personally thought the "gambling
debt" to be an attempt at a joke,
but a financial record is not the
proper place for kidding. Students
have a right to know where their
$346 had been spent. I made no

charges, called for no legal action,
but rather asked for explanations
and protections against future
abuse.
How my statements were
reported in the press and radio is a
different matter. Students should
by now be aware that news
reports are meant to be taken
with a grain of salt. Limitations of

space and time prohibit the
printing of facts which could cast
a given issue in a totally different
light.
I let my actions stand. I serve
notice to students that I will
continue to speak out on
important matters. Special
interest groups should try to
accept the revelations in the spirit

in which they were made. We all
share the shame of prior wrongs
whether it be through active or
passive assent. We must now join
together to prevent them from
reoccuring. It's as simple as that.
