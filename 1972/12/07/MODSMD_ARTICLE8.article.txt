## Power Increase Coming 
### 
kzsu

Last spring KZSU received approval from
Stanford students for a fee assessment, which was
intended to pay for the operation of the station for
the coming year and for a proposed increase in
power, which would allow us to broadcast in stereo.
The students passed that assessment
overwhelmingly, and KZSU soon afterwards filed an
application with the Federal Communications
Commission for an increase to 3000 watts.
Midway through the summer the application was
rejected, one of the main reasons being that our
signal at 3000 watts would interfere with the signal
from KCMA, a San Francisco station affiliated with
Simpson Bible College. Consequently plans were
made for reapplication, this time asking for only
1000 watts, an increase that would still allow our
signal to better cover the area encompassed by the
Stanford community.
Overworked Engineers
All of these developments have been reported in
the Daily already. This fall, however, the question
has come up many times of when KZSU's
re-application will be submitted. The problem all
quarter has been the burden that the application
process ptaces on our Engineering Department. No
one at KZSU is paid a salary except our Business
Manager (and she isn't paid much) — our Chief
Engineer is a full time employee of the
Computation Center and his assistants are full time
EE students. All have many other demands on their
time. The engineers have, as their main
responsibility, keeping the station and its physical
plant operating.
Three weeks ago when KZSU was flooded, the
only unfinished part of the application was an
engineering field strength study concerning possible
interference with KCMA. A number of maps and

exhibits vital to the application were destroyed and
the clean-up and design work necessary to prevent
more flooding has been taking up the volunteered
time of our engineers, at the expense of the
field-strength study and the replacement of the
maps. When that is done, we can wrap up the
application and send it off. We now anticipate
completing the application before or over the
Christmas break, barring another Act of God or
other unforeseen problems.
Money Being Held
In the meantime, the money that we have
received in student fee assessments for the
stereo/higher power project is being held in reserve
by the University accountants who supervise our
finances. We cannot use the money for anything but
a power increase. We are not trying to "pull a fast
one," as was recently charged. Our records are open
to the public; we violate Federal law if they are not.
We would appreciate it if our critics would avail
themselves of the opportunity to come down to
KZSU and find out what the story really is.
All of our actions since the referendum last
spring have been in good faith, but getting the
application in is simply a matter of time for our
engineers. We are confident that the application will
be completed soon, and that it will be approved. If
all goes as expected, the higher power transmitter
should be in operation before the end of the school
year. Transfer to stereo broadcasting involves only
notification to the FCC after completion of the
necessary rewiring. Those are routine operations and
should follow the power increase very shortly. Then
we will be able to give Stanford the kind of service
for which the students have given their money.

Last spring KZSU received approval from
Stanford students for a fee assessment, which was
intended to pay for the operation of the station for
the coming year and for a proposed increase in
power, which would allow us to broadcast in stereo.
The students passed that assessment
overwhelmingly, and KZSU soon afterwards filed an
application with the Federal Communications
Commission for an increase to 3000 watts.
Midway through the summer the application was
rejected, one of the main reasons being that our
signal at 3000 watts would interfere with the signal
from KCMA, a San Francisco station affiliated with
Simpson Bible College. Consequently plans were
made for reapplication, this time asking for only
1000 watts, an increase that would still allow our
signal to better cover the area encompassed by the
Stanford community.
Overworked Engineers
All of these developments have been reported in
the Daily already. This fall, however, the question
has come up many times of when KZSU's
re-application will be submitted. The problem all
quarter has been the burden that the application
process ptaces on our Engineering Department. No
one at KZSU is paid a salary except our Business
Manager (and she isn't paid much) — our Chief
Engineer is a full time employee of the
Computation Center and his assistants are full time
EE students. All have many other demands on their
time. The engineers have, as their main
responsibility, keeping the station and its physical
plant operating.
Three weeks ago when KZSU was flooded, the
only unfinished part of the application was an
engineering field strength study concerning possible
interference with KCMA. A number of maps and

exhibits vital to the application were destroyed and
the clean-up and design work necessary to prevent
more flooding has been taking up the volunteered
time of our engineers, at the expense of the
field-strength study and the replacement of the
maps. When that is done, we can wrap up the
application and send it off. We now anticipate
completing the application before or over the
Christmas break, barring another Act of God or
other unforeseen problems.
Money Being Held
In the meantime, the money that we have
received in student fee assessments for the
stereo/higher power project is being held in reserve
by the University accountants who supervise our
finances. We cannot use the money for anything but
a power increase. We are not trying to "pull a fast
one," as was recently charged. Our records are open
to the public; we violate Federal law if they are not.
We would appreciate it if our critics would avail
themselves of the opportunity to come down to
KZSU and find out what the story really is.
All of our actions since the referendum last
spring have been in good faith, but getting the
application in is simply a matter of time for our
engineers. We are confident that the application will
be completed soon, and that it will be approved. If
all goes as expected, the higher power transmitter
should be in operation before the end of the school
year. Transfer to stereo broadcasting involves only
notification to the FCC after completion of the
necessary rewiring. Those are routine operations and
should follow the power increase very shortly. Then
we will be able to give Stanford the kind of service
for which the students have given their money.
