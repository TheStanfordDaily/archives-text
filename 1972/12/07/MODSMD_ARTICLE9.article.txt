## Who Will Be Drafted? 
###

A recent announcement on
draft calls for 1973 answers some
crucial questions, but fails to
clarify others: namely, who, if
anyone, will be drafted out of the
1973 lottery pool?
On Nov. 28, 1972, Secretary of
Defense Laird stated that a
maximum of 10,000 men will be
drafted during the first six months
of 1973. He said that no one will
be inducted during January, but
inductions will continue from
February through June.
Laird backed up President
Nixon's August, 1972,
commitment not to request
renewal of the induction
authority after its expiration on
June 30, 1973, However, he
emphasized the low enlistment
rate in the Reserves and National
Guard, and threatened
introduction of a law for drafting
men into these programs after the
expiration of the current
induction authority on June 30.
If at the most, only 10,000
men are to be drafted in the

forseeable future, then who will
they be?
EXTENDED PRIORITY
Probably most, if not all, of
these inductees will be men who
have entered the 1972 lottery
pool, whose lottery numbers are
under 96, and who have not
become "fully available"
(medically acceptable and not
under appeals) to be ordered for
induction until early 1973. This
group of carry-overs is called the
Extended Priority.
A date, that is often
misunderstood with regard to the
Extended Priority is Dec. 31. This
date only marks the end of a
man's prime year of liability if his
lottery number has not been
reached during the year. If his
number has been reached (i.e. it is
under 96 for 1972), then he can
be drafted ahead of the following
year's pool of men, as a member
of the Extended Priority.
Last year, the 125,000 men
who escaped induction in
January, February and March
were members of the Extended
Priority. But this legal loophole
does not appear likely to re-occur
in 1973. The law defining
Extended Priority has been
changed, and the pattern of draft
calls looks quite different for the
coming year.
Date Deleted
The Nov. 28th A.P. release on

Laird's announcement of draft
calls erroneously stated that, "the
law provides that [the Extended
Priority] may be drafted only up
to March 31." The date of March
31 as a cutoff for drafting the
Extended Priority has been
deleted from the law.
A man in Extended Priority in
1973 has no induction cutoff date
until the draft authority expires
on June 30. He escapes induction
only if he can remain "fully
available" for 90 consecutive days
without his number being reached
in the Extended Priority (ahead of
the entire 1973 pool). Normally,
this would only be possible during
a period of at least three
consecutive months of no draft
calls.

Ironically, men in the
Extended Priority during 1973 are
the most likely to be drafted,
whereas in 1972, men in the same
group were the least likely to be
drafted.
1973 FIRST PRIORITY
If not enough inductions are
obtained from the Extended
Priority to fill the quota of up to
10,000 men, the 1973 First
Priority group will be ordered.
This group is made up of men
who will become 20 years old
during 1973.
The A.P. release on Laird's
announcement quoted Selective
Service officials as saying that
1973 First Priority group men
with lottery numbers over 40 can
consider themselves safe from the
draft.
An even more optimistic
ceiling prediction of number 15
or 20 was attributed to Selective
Service officials by the New York
Times a week before Laird's
public announcement.
Enlistments Wanted
With a relatively small number
of men to be drafted in 1973, yet
such an indefinite lottery ceiling
prediction, it appears that the
Defense Department may be
trying to keep pressure on men in
both the Extended Priority and
the 1973 First Priority group in
order to induce enlistments â€”
especially into the Reserves and

ROUGH

National Guard.
Furthermore, a recent change
in the draft law now allows a man
who has received an induction
order to join any other program
or branch of the military up until
10 days before his induction date.
Use of this option was a primary
reason for the lottery ceiling
reaching as high as 95 for 1972. It
could also be a crucial factor as to
whether or not the 1973 First
Priority group is ordered in the
coming months.

a personal draft situation and
alternatives is welcome to come to
