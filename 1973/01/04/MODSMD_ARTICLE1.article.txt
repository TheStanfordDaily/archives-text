# Overseas Director Quits Post; Panel Urges Program Changes
## 
### DOYLE McMANUS 
Robert A. Walker, director of the
Overseas Campus Program since its
inception in 1958, has resigned to
return to teaching, it was announced
Tuesday.
Walker's resignation preceded by
only one day the release of the report
of a special Presidential Commission
on the program. The Commission,
chaired by Law Prof. John H.
Merryman, charged that "the foreign
studies programs that were designed
for and were successful in an earlier
period at Stanford now seem
unsatisfactory," and recommended
extensive renovation of all the
program's aspects.
Walker disavows any direct
connection between the Commission's
findings and his resignation. He said he
sent his resignation to Vice-President
and Provost William E. Miller on Dec.
28, before he had seen the report.
"That was not dishonest in any
way," Walker said yesterday. "Well, I
had some intimations of what the
report had in it. . . The report coming
out actually made it seem like an
appropriate time to resign — the
connection is really just that, it
seemed apropos. In the autumn
quarter, the provost was aware of my
intentions."
Walker said he received his copy of
the report "last week. I think it was
Thursday (Dec. 28), as a matter of
fact. I did not see any advance copies
or anything."

Walker's resignation will become
effective at the end of spring quarter.
He will return to his position of
professor of political science, and will
teach courses in public administration
and urban government.
'Limited Alternatives'
The Commission's report,
submitted to Miller Dec. 15, declared
that the basic objective of the foreign
studies programs remains valid, but
warned that the programs face
"declining student interest, mounting
student disaffection, and increasing,
and increasingly profound, criticism
by faculty on academic
grounds... We are faced with limited
alternatives: abolition or renovation.
Abolition," the report declared, "is
out of the question."
Among the "renovations"
proposed:
—The academic program, the report
recommended, should be "pluralistic,
flexible, and experimental" and "of
the highest academic quality possible";
courses should be focused on the
"host culture"; and Stanford credit
should be easily available for courses
taken in local institutions.
The programs should shift to a
nine-month calendar, with the
possibility of individual programs of
three or six months within the
three-quarter schedule. The three-day
weekend, long a favorite with more
peripatetic students, should be
abolished in favor of a five-day
academic week — possibly with

week-long holidays in mid-quarter for
travel purposes.
The various programs should
experiment in new approaches to
language instruction, both on the
home campus and abroad. One
possiblity, the report said, is a "total
immersion" in the foreign language
during an initial period abroad.
Urban Location
All the programs should be located
in large cities. Specifically, the
Commission recommended that the
French campus relocate in Paris, the
British campus in London, the German
campus in Munich or Berlin, and the
Italian campus in Rome or central
Florence.
The Commission also recommended
that the University's lease at the
Vienna campus not be renewed, but
made it clear that the decision was a
financial one and that if an Austrian
program is to be continued, it should
remain somewhere in Vienna.
The almost exclusive location of
programs in Western Europe "should
be corrected. This may or may not
mean reduction of the number of
programs located in Western Europe."
And the administrative structure of
the program should be overhauled,
giving overall responsibility to a
director with a limited term who
"should be a tenured faculty member,
highly respected and involved in the
academic community," and who
"should function primarily as an
academic leader." Administrative

concerns should be delegated to a staff
headed by a full-time Assistant
Director for Administration.
President Lyman called the report
"thoughtful and well-argued. .. . I'm
very concerned that people not panic
in the belief that this is the opening
salvo in some campaign to demolish
the Overseas Campus Program," he
said. "We're most certainly going to
keep the program. It's obviously going
to take quite some time to study and
implement the report.
Walker was reluctant to comment
on the Commission's findings. "It
might be a little premature," he said.
"Some of the things they're
recommending will have to undergo
serious study." He did, however, note
that the proposal to relocate the
programs in large cities "overrates the
degree to which Stanford students are
keen on the smell of carbon
monoxide."
