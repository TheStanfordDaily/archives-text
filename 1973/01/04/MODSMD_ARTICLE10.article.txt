Stanford Hurts Women
Editor:
The report on women
graduating in 1972 as published in
the Daily (Nov. 7) is quite
interesting because of one piece of
data which says a lot to contradict
the tone of the study. The report
is generally quite self
congratulatory in detailing how
the attitude of women at Stanford
has changed recently and implying
that in some way Stanford has
had a part in this change.
For all students and all
occupations the numbers are very
close except for women in the
college educator-scientist field. In
this case 13 percent of the women
consider this as their "ideal"
occupation while only seven
percent thought this a "real"
possibility. The message is clear.
For the one occupation for
which women students have close
association with members of that
field, only half see this as a real
possibility. The effect of Stanford
has been much more negative than
positive in the one place where it
has any real impact on the
expectations of women students.

A Better Way
To Fight Crime?
Editor:
Perhaps Roger Boesche,
graduate student in political
science, can think of and
implement a way to prevent petty
crime (Daily, Nov. 29).
As an article in the New York
Times several Sundays ago
pointed out, a corporation can be
swindled out of millions of dollars
with little effect on daily life, but
the muggings and petty robberies
of the streets have changed the
life-style of the average man.
Of course one way to begin is
to be logical about the problems
proposed, the development, and
resolution of the argument. Mr.
Boesche starts by complaining of
the length of time of the
questioning. If this is a problem,
perhaps something can be done
about it. I myself have been
stopped on the streets of Stanford
by the police off and on through
the years, and I am not black.
Perhaps what we need all
around is more respect for each
and every one.
