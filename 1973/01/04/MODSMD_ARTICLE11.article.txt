# barker's charges 'unwarranted'
## 'Last Year's Council Used Funds Properly' 
### 
lann kimball

Bob Barker's discussion of his
own "factual" findings of
misappropriation by our Council
were nothing if not dramatically
stated. Unfortunately, the
allegations which he made in the
course of his article (Daily, Dec.
7) are also substantially shaded
with his own hindsight bias.
Perhaps this article will serve to
clear the air a bit so that the
reform of the ASSU can continue
without being hungup by
non-issues.
Mr. Barker's statement that the
meal fund was to go for our
"guests" is untrue. That money
was earmarked to allow members

of the Council to maintain
contact with their campus
constituents even though they
themselves were not in the
residence system. The amount of
money allocated by the Dean's
office for this purpose was
substantially greater during the
previous two years than it was
during our term. Strangely, no
comments were heard from such
concerned souls as Mr. Barker
during that time.
Contrary to his statement, the
only way one could use the fund
was to identify her or himself as a
Council member; no guests were
included because none were

allowed. One member of our
council did use a disproportionate
amount of the meal fund.
However, this same member was
in the practice of holding
meetings frequently over lunch
and informally listening to
students ideas and comments
about the ASSU, a practice I can
only applaud. We were not in the
practice of checking up on one
another for petty expenditures
and Sarah Moore rarely, if ever,
attended any of the meals
attended by Council members to
ascertain their value in terms of
ASSU business.
Phone calls were made on our

budget to such exotic places as
Denver, Colorado and this also
offends the righteous soul of Mr.
Barker. Whether he could believe
it or not, we actually were in
occasional communication with
other schools and with the ASG
(Association of Student
Governments) and other national
student organizations.
If members of the Council
made personal calls on the budget
I could honestly not say. Again,
we were not in the habit of
checking up on petty
expenditures of this sort. Each
call made was attributed to an
individual Cou.icil member and,
again, all Mr. Barker has to do is
ask. He claims that he has not
done so because individual
admissions of guilt would not
serve to correct the situation.
Actually, he knows as well as I
that were he to ask us he might
find his collection of "facts" to be
just a bag of hot air. Certainly he
gets more satisfaction out of
seeing his half truths in print.
Another point covered by Mr.
Barker is the expenditure of funds
for guests to stay in Roble hall.
The individuals involved were
offering lectures and cultural
happenings on campus. Originally
they were to be funded by
another source and at the last
minute the money was
unavailable. We stepped in and
took it from our budget because
students were benefitting from
their presence on campus and we
felt it was correct for us to bear
the cost.
Soledad Trip
Money for the Soledad trip was
also made available because our
council felt this "busing" to be a
priority item educationally. Mr.
Barker is, again, free to disagree
but the money was not, in my
opinion, misspent. We were
elected on a platform of ideas and
programs and, to no one's surprise
but Mr. Barker's we used our
money to put our ideas into
effect. We spent money on the
Course Review and the bank
project as well as many other
items which Mr. Barker did not
object to. That he only has two
disagreements with our spending
policy indicates he has different
political ideas .. . not that we
misspent the money.

The funding for the ASSU
report was completely from our
budget because we felt that
communication with the student
body was a priority item. The
Free Press was used because they
were less expensive than other
shops. We had about 1500 copies
printed up for 300 dollars
although I believe we made the
payment on receipt of the last
fifty copies. I know because I
personally put them all over the
campus in every dorm and
fraternity during finals week at no
charge for gas.
Skipping over the "gambling
debt" scandal which is probably
the ultimate in absurdity (all he
had to do was ask!!!), I would
offer some observations on the
current money wrangles in the
Senate. If an investigation of
budgets is to be done, it should be
done in a systematic, responsible
fashion . . . not by taking a file of
old bills and attempting to draw
conclusions from them.
Damaging Statements
I am very offended by the
unwarranted, damaging
statements made against our
Council in the course of Mr.
Barker's article and hope that he
will curtail his activities until he
has thought out his methods (and
motives) more clearly. If nothing
else, I learned last year how a
good number of the
"enlightened" Stanford
community treated a Council
which was 50 percent black. O.t
composition should not m?) :» "•*
above criticism but our humanity
should have sufficed to make us
above the kind of treatment we
received. Never have so many
people with so little information
to detract from the
hours of thankless work put in by
a Council of Presidents.
An interesting point to reflect
on is how little criticism Mr.
Barker offered of expenditures
which did not involve black
people. Stick the name Roble on
the tab and he's instantly alert to
the possibility of SCANDAL, if
only he could manage to portray
it in the right light. Such senators
certainly do not serve the interests
of the students.

ask. He claims that he has not
done so because individual
admissions of guilt would not
serve to correct the situation.
Actually, he knows as well as I
that were he to ask us he might
find his collection of "facts" to be
just a bag of hot air. Certainly he
gets more satisfaction out of
seeing his half truths in print.
Another point covered by Mr.
Barker is the expenditure of funds
for guests to stay in Roble hall.
The individuals involved were
offering lectures and cultural
happenings on campus. Originally
they were to be funded by
another source and at the last
minute the money was
unavailable. We stepped in and
took it from our budget because
students were benefitting from
their presence on campus and we
felt it was correct for us to bear
the cost.
Soledad Trip
Money for the Soledad trip was
also made available because our
council felt this "busing" to be a
priority item educationally. Mr.
Barker is, again, free to disagree
but the money was not, in my
opinion, misspent. We were
elected on a platform of ideas and
programs and, to no one's surprise
but Mr. Barker's we used our
money to put our ideas into
effect. We spent money on the
Course Review and the bank
project as well as many other
items which Mr. Barker did not
object to. That he only has two
disagreements with our spending
policy indicates he has different
political ideas .. . not that we
misspent the money.

The funding for the ASSU
report was completely from our
budget because we felt that
communication with the student
body was a priority item. The
Free Press was used because they
were less expensive than other
shops. We had about 1500 copies
printed up for 300 dollars
although I believe we made the
payment on receipt of the last
fifty copies. I know because I
personally put them all over the
campus in every dorm and
fraternity during finals week at no
charge for gas.
Skipping over the "gambling
debt" scandal which is probably
the ultimate in absurdity (all he
had to do was ask!!!), I would
offer some observations on the
current money wrangles in the
Senate. If an investigation of
budgets is to be done, it should be
done in a systematic, responsible
fashion . . . not by taking a file of
old bills and attempting to draw
conclusions from them.
Damaging Statements
I am very offended by the
unwarranted, damaging
statements made against our
Council in the course of Mr.
Barker's article and hope that he
will curtail his activities until he
has thought out his methods (and
motives) more clearly. If nothing
else, I learned last year how a
good number of the
"enlightened" Stanford
community treated a Council
which was 50 percent black. O.t
composition should not m?) :» "•*
above criticism but our humanity
should have sufficed to make us
above the kind of treatment we
received. Never have so many
people with so little information
to detract from the
hours of thankless work put in by
a Council of Presidents.
An interesting point to reflect
on is how little criticism Mr.
Barker offered of expenditures
which did not involve black
people. Stick the name Roble on
the tab and he's instantly alert to
the possibility of SCANDAL, if
only he could manage to portray
it in the right light. Such senators
certainly do not serve the interests
of the students.

Bob Barker's discussion of his
own "factual" findings of
misappropriation by our Council
were nothing if not dramatically
stated. Unfortunately, the
allegations which he made in the
course of his article (Daily, Dec.
7) are also substantially shaded
with his own hindsight bias.
Perhaps this article will serve to
clear the air a bit so that the
reform of the ASSU can continue
without being hungup by
non-issues.
Mr. Barker's statement that the
meal fund was to go for our
"guests" is untrue. That money
was earmarked to allow members

of the Council to maintain
contact with their campus
constituents even though they
themselves were not in the
residence system. The amount of
money allocated by the Dean's
office for this purpose was
substantially greater during the
previous two years than it was
during our term. Strangely, no
comments were heard from such
concerned souls as Mr. Barker
during that time.
Contrary to his statement, the
only way one could use the fund
was to identify her or himself as a
Council member; no guests were
included because none were

allowed. One member of our
council did use a disproportionate
amount of the meal fund.
However, this same member was
in the practice of holding
meetings frequently over lunch
and informally listening to
students ideas and comments
about the ASSU, a practice I can
only applaud. We were not in the
practice of checking up on one
another for petty expenditures
and Sarah Moore rarely, if ever,
attended any of the meals
attended by Council members to
ascertain their value in terms of
ASSU business.
Phone calls were made on our

budget to such exotic places as
Denver, Colorado and this also
offends the righteous soul of Mr.
Barker. Whether he could believe
it or not, we actually were in
occasional communication with
other schools and with the ASG
(Association of Student
Governments) and other national
student organizations.
If members of the Council
made personal calls on the budget
I could honestly not say. Again,
we were not in the habit of
checking up on petty
expenditures of this sort. Each
call made was attributed to an
individual Cou.icil member and,
again, all Mr. Barker has to do is
ask. He claims that he has not

Damaging Statements
I am very offended by the
unwarranted, damaging
statements made against our
Council in the course of Mr.
Barker's article and hope that he
will curtail his activities until he
has thought out his methods (and
motives) more clearly. If nothing
else, I learned last year how a
good number of the
"enlightened" Stanford
community treated a Council
which was 50 percent black. O.t

above criticism but our humanity
should have sufficed to make us
above the kind of treatment we
received. Never have so many
people with so little information
to detract from the
hours of thankless work put in by
a Council of Presidents.
An interesting point to reflect
on is how little criticism Mr.
Barker offered of expenditures
which did not involve black
people. Stick the name Roble on
the tab and he's instantly alert to
the possibility of SCANDAL, if
only he could manage to portray
it in the right light. Such senators
certainly do not serve the interests
of the students.

Bob Barker's discussion of his
own "factual" findings of
misappropriation by our Council
were nothing if not dramatically
stated. Unfortunately, the
allegations which he made in the
course of his article (Daily, Dec.
7) are also substantially shaded
with his own hindsight bias.
Perhaps this article will serve to
clear the air a bit so that the
reform of the ASSU can continue
without being hungup by
non-issues.
Mr. Barker's statement that the
meal fund was to go for our
"guests" is untrue. That money
was earmarked to allow members

of the Council to maintain
contact with their campus
constituents even though they
themselves were not in the
residence system. The amount of
money allocated by the Dean's
office for this purpose was
substantially greater during the
previous two years than it was
during our term. Strangely, no
comments were heard from such
concerned souls as Mr. Barker
during that time.
Contrary to his statement, the
only way one could use the fund
was to identify her or himself as a
Council member; no guests were
included because none were

allowed. One member of our
council did use a disproportionate
amount of the meal fund.
However, this same member was
in the practice of holding
meetings frequently over lunch
and informally listening to
students ideas and comments
about the ASSU, a practice I can
only applaud. We were not in the
practice of checking up on one
another for petty expenditures
and Sarah Moore rarely, if ever,
attended any of the meals
attended by Council members to
ascertain their value in terms of
ASSU business.
Phone calls were made on our

budget to such exotic places as
Denver, Colorado and this also
offends the righteous soul of Mr.
Barker. Whether he could believe
it or not, we actually were in
occasional communication with
other schools and with the ASG
(Association of Student
Governments) and other national
student organizations.
If members of the Council
made personal calls on the budget
I could honestly not say. Again,
we were not in the habit of
checking up on petty
expenditures of this sort. Each
call made was attributed to an
individual Cou.icil member and,
again, all Mr. Barker has to do is
ask. He claims that he has not
done so because individual
admissions of guilt would not
serve to correct the situation.
Actually, he knows as well as I
that were he to ask us he might
find his collection of "facts" to be
just a bag of hot air. Certainly he
gets more satisfaction out of
seeing his half truths in print.
Another point covered by Mr.
Barker is the expenditure of funds
for guests to stay in Roble hall.
The individuals involved were
offering lectures and cultural
happenings on campus. Originally
they were to be funded by
another source and at the last
minute the money was
unavailable. We stepped in and
took it from our budget because
students were benefitting from
their presence on campus and we
felt it was correct for us to bear
the cost.
Soledad Trip
Money for the Soledad trip was
also made available because our
council felt this "busing" to be a
priority item educationally. Mr.
Barker is, again, free to disagree
but the money was not, in my
opinion, misspent. We were
elected on a platform of ideas and
programs and, to no one's surprise
but Mr. Barker's we used our
money to put our ideas into
effect. We spent money on the
Course Review and the bank
project as well as many other
items which Mr. Barker did not
object to. That he only has two
disagreements with our spending
policy indicates he has different
political ideas .. . not that we
misspent the money.

The funding for the ASSU
report was completely from our
budget because we felt that
communication with the student
body was a priority item. The
Free Press was used because they
were less expensive than other
shops. We had about 1500 copies
printed up for 300 dollars
although I believe we made the
payment on receipt of the last
fifty copies. I know because I
personally put them all over the
campus in every dorm and
fraternity during finals week at no
charge for gas.
Skipping over the "gambling
debt" scandal which is probably
the ultimate in absurdity (all he
had to do was ask!!!), I would
offer some observations on the
current money wrangles in the
Senate. If an investigation of
budgets is to be done, it should be
done in a systematic, responsible
fashion . . . not by taking a file of
old bills and attempting to draw
conclusions from them.
