Chase Operates
On Marcos' Wife
Dr. Robert Chase, chairman of the
Department of Surgery at the Medical Center,
went to the Philippines last month to help
with surgery on Inelda Marcos, the wife of
Philippine president Ferdinand Marcos. Mrs.
Marcos was the victim of a knife attack.
Chase assisted in connecting tendons
severed in Marcos's right hand. He is a
nationally known expert on surgery of the
hand.
Ex-Prof Named
Justice Deputy
President Nixon has nominated former
Stanford Law Prof.' Joseph T. Sneed as the
new U.S. Deputy Attorney General. Sneed,
52, is now Duke University's Law School
dean. He served on the faculty here from
1962 until 1971, and was a specialist in tax
law.
Law Prof. Marc Franklin said that Sneed's
appointment is "probably an effort to give the
department a clean look. Academics have a
way of doing that." Franklin added that
Sneed "is a very respected teacher and
scholar."
Sneed will succeed Ralph E. Erickson and
will serve under Attorney General Richard G.
Kleindienst.
Two Win Rhodes
Scholarship Here
Two students here have been awarded
Rhodes scholarships for two years of study at
Oxford University in England.
The two are Chris T. Hendrickson, a
co-terminal student in engineering from
Seattle and John L. Tillman, a senior in
history from Athena, Oregon. They were
among 32 selected throughout the country
from a list of 733 applicants.
McCloskey Plans
North Viet Visit
Congressman Paul N. McCloskey Jr.
(R—Portola Valley) has announced plans to
visit Hanoi to survey the results of recent
American bombing there.
McCloskey had originally planned to visit
the North Vietnamese capital during the last
week in December and report his findings to
Congress when it reconvened yesterday.
However, severe bomb damage to Hanoi
Airport has delayed the trip.
Anti-War March
Attracts 2000
An estimated 2000 people participated in a
candlelight march for peace in Palo Alto on
Christmas Eve.

The marchers, led by Palo Alto Mayor
Kirke Comstock, walked from Lytton Plaza to
Memorial Church here. Congressman Paul N.
McCloskey Jr. and a group of Vietnam
Veterans Against the War also participated in
the march.
At Memorial Church, Religion Prof. Robert
McAfee Brown criticized the "ugly insanity of
the most massive bombing in history." Brown
added "If you approve of what our country is
doing, you forfeit the right to call yourself a
Christian or a Jew or a human being."
Chinese Savants
Inspect SLAC
A delegation of seven scientists from the
People's Republic of China toured the campus
during finals week last quarter. The
delegation, led by Chang Wen-yu, the deputy
director of China's Atomic Energy Institute,
was guided through the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center (SLAC) by Dr. Wolfgang
Panofsky, the SLAC director.
After touring the Center, the scientists held
private talks with Physics Prof. Robert
Hofstadter, Chemistry Prof. Charles Djerassi
and Computer Science Prof. Edward A.
Feigenbaum. The delegation lunched with five
Stanford Nobel Prize winners at the Faculty
Club.
SLAC To Double
Computer Capacity
The Stanford Linear Accelerator Center
(SLAC) is expecting to receive two new
computers early next year, valued at more
than $12 million, which will more than
double SLAC's present computer capacity.
According to Eugene Richansrud, assistant
director of the center's business services
division, final negotiations of the computer
contract are now under way between the
Atomic Energy Commission and the IBM
Corp.
Miller Evaluates
Academics' Status
Vice President and Provost William F.
Miller, who served as acting president during
autumn quarter, told the Stanford Alumni
Club of Phoenix that the University is
"intellectually alive and healthy."
Miller reported that students are taking
increasingly heavy course loads, with
substantial increases in student enrollment in
both the physical and biological sciences.
Physics, math and chemistry also have
attracted more undergraduate interest in the
past two years, according to Miller.
Miller Deplores
Funding Decrease
Vice President and Provost Willi tun F.
Miller has said that the decline in Federal
financial support for basic research can have
"disastrous long-term effects on the nation."

Speaking to the American Association for
the Advancement of Science, Miller said that
the "lack of strong support of basic science
will lead to an intellectual recession which in
turn will retard technological and economic
growth."
Miller served as Vice President for Research
prior to becoming Provost.
Med Center Names
Finance Manager
Robert M. Butler, business manager of the
University's Department of Athletics and
former budget director of W.P. Fuller and
Company, has been appointed financial
manager of Stanford University School of
Medicine.
The appointment, effective immediately,
was announced today by Dr. Clayton Rich,
dean of the Medical School and vice-president
for medical affairs.
Butler, 52, will have responsibility for the
administration of Medical School funds, the
preparation of budgets and forecasts, and the
financial aspects of long-range planning.
A 1947 graduate of Stanford, he has had
25 years of experience in fiscal management.
After two years with Western Electric
Company and 14 with W.P. Fuller and
Company, he joined the controller's staff here
in 1963. A year later, he was appointed
business manager of the Department of
Athletics.
In a related administrative move at the
Medical School, Elwood C. Pierce, presently
assistant controller, has been promoted to
operations manager. He will direct staff salary
payments and personnel policies, administer
fellowships, grants and contracts, and
coordinate services needed to operate the
Medical School.
Pierce, 44, came hen' in 1964 after 12
years with W.P. Fuller and Company. He
served as assistant research administrator
before being appointed assistant controller of
the Medical School three years ago.
In the past, both the fiscal and operations
management of the school have been directed
by the controller and assistant controller.
Now, these functions have been more clearly
separated and are reflected in the titles of the
two positions, said controller William B.
Rowland.
Rowland, controller of the Medical School
for the past 15 years, will take an early
retirement this spring. He obtained his
Master's degree from the Graduate School of
Business in 1947 and worked on the staff of
the University controller for seven years
before coming to the Medical School in 1957.
Ex-UP President
Bequeaths Fund
The Communication Department here is
one of three journalism schools which have
been named beneficiaries in the will of Karl A.
Bickel, former president of United Press, who
died last month.
Bickel left 70 percent of his estate after
bequests to his heirs to set up a trust fund for
journalism schools here, at the University of
Florida and at a college or university to be
chosen by the trustees of the fund

Bube Enters Evolution Study

Material Science Prof. Richard
Bube has been appointed to a new
committee which will suggest
revisions in state textbooks
dealing with theories of evolution.
The appointment followed a
vote by the California State Board
of Education to downgrade
Darwin's theory of evolution in
new science textbooks for 3.3
million California children. Prior
to the Board's vote, 19 California

Nobel Laureate scientists,
including six professors here, had
urged that evolution remain as the
sole explanation for man's origin
in the textbooks.
The six Stanford professors
are: Felix Bloch (Physics), Robert
Hofstadter (Physics), Joshua
Lederberg (Genetics), Linus
Pauling (Chemistry), William
Shockley (Electrical Engineering)
and Arthur Kornberg
(Biochemistry).

INFERNO—Two severe fires caused at least $400,000 in damage to two buildings in downtown Palo Alto
last weekend. On Friday, a three alarm fire fed by paint, solvents and automobiles destroyed the New
Look Auto Paint Co. at 32 Wells Lane. Palo Alto Fire Battalion Chief Ted Pearson said that damage to the
building and its contents totalled "at least $300,000." On Sunday, a blaze which apparently was started
by a gas leak in a pizza oven caused an estimated $110,000 in damage to the "In Your Ear" restaurant at
135 University Avenue.
