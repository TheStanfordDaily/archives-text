# Senate Considers CUS Proposal
## 
### 
The Faculty Senate postponed
a decision Dec. 14 on the
Committee on Undergraduate
Studies' (CUS) recommendations
concerning student-initiated
academic programs.
Administrative control and
credit granting procedures for
SWOPSI, SCIRE, and the Program
on Urban Studies, have been
contested for the past three years.
The CUS recommendations seek
to clarify the power of
Undergraduate Dean James L.
Gibbs to select faculty to serve on
policy boards for the student
initiated academic programs. The
proposals also state that appeals
on academic credit decisions be
referred to a CUS subcommittee
after study by a dean.
Several faculty members voiced
concern that the CUS
recommendations rendered the
dean's authority unclear and the
Senate postponed action.
The student-initiated academic
programs have had a student
majority on the policy boards
since 1970, but the faculty has
retained basic control over
granting credit for new courses.
