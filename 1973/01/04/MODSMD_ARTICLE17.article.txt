## Hoopsters Win At Home 
### STAN WILSON 
Stanford led most of the way, but
lost the game in the closing
seconds. With 1:30 remaining the
Cards led 72-69, but CSU's Mark
Williams scored two quick
buckets, and center Como
Pontliana connected on a pair of
free throws to put CSU in front
75-72, with 15 seconds left in the
game.
Frost turned in his season high
against CSU, scoring 23 points.
Kelley added 20 more.
The Cards returned home, and
promptly ripped a respected
Fordham team 77-54, utilizing an
effective fast break. Stanford
again used 13 players, and 6-11
reserve center Patterson scored
ten points in his short stint. Soph
guard Mel Arterberry led a
balanced scoring attack, netting
22 points. Kelley added 13 points
and 13 rebounds, and guard Mark
Gilberg and forward Mann each
scored 10. Kenneth Charles led all
scorers, although he shot a
miserable 7-28 from the floor.

While most of the Stanford
community was relaxing over the
holidays, the Stanford basketball
team was busy winning four
games and losing three, turning in
several outstanding performances
and a few not-so-impressive
games.
The Cards opened the vacation
with a convincing win over San
Jose State, 75-54. Stanford's
young but tall front line of center
Rich Kelley (7-0), and forwards
Mike Mann (6-9) and Dave Frost
(6-6) dominated the shorter
Spartans, gaining a rebounding
edge of 30-14 in the first half.
Stanford led 40-23 at the
intermission, and coasted the rest
of the way using 13 players,
including freshmen Tim Patterson
and Ed Schweitzer.
Stanford has a perfect 4-0
record in Maples Pavilion, but the
team has not fared so well on the
road. Coach Howie Dallmar
blames much of the trouble on
some very poor free throw
shooting, pointing out the close
losses to Denver, Colorado State,
and Virginia Tech.
The trip to Colorado proved to
be a disaster for the Cards, as they
turned in their worst
performances of the year, bowing
to Denver 77-74, and to Colorado
State the following night, 77-72.
"We lost the Denver game on free
throws," Dallmar lamented.
Kelley turned in his best
performance of the year against
Denver, scoring 24 points and
grabbing 22 rebounds. George
Walls led the winners with 18
points.
Against Colorado State,

cool 39 percent from the floor,
but outrebounded St. Mary's
55-44.
Frost got hot from the outside
in that game, hitting on 10 of 18
shots, and leading all scorers with
21 points. Kelley added 16 points,
and, as usual, led all rebounders
with 14. Versatile senior Bob
Buell turned in a solid
performance, scoring 12 points
and grabbing seven rebounds.
Stanford closed out holiday
activity with a trip to Norfolk,
Virginia for the Kiwanis Old
Dominion Classic. The Cards split
a pair of games, and returned
home with an over-sized second
place trophy.
Down by seven points at the
half, Stanford came back to
defeat Navy in the opening game,
67-61. A tip-in by Mann gave the
Cards a 56-55 lead which they
never relinquished. Kelley fouled
out of the game with 5:50 to
play, but Patterson came in to
spark the Cards by scoring eight
points.
But vacation ended on a
losing r as Stanford dropped a
close r .sion to a good Virginia
Tech earn, 77-71, in the
tourr. ,ent finals. A Frost jumper
with fifteen seconds pulled
Stanford to within one, with 26
seconds left, but the Gobblers
scored five quick points to decide
the contest.

Stanford closed out holiday
activity with a trip to Norfolk,
Virginia for the Kiwanis Old
Dominion Classic. The Cards split
a pair of games, and returned
home with an over-sized second
place trophy.
Down by seven points at the
half, Stanford came back to
defeat Navy in the opening game,
67-61. A tip-in by Mann gave the
Cards a 56-55 lead which they
never relinquished. Kelley fouled
out of the game with 5:50 to
play, but Patterson came in to
spark the Cards by scoring eight
points.
But vacation ended on a
losing r as Stanford dropped a
close r .sion to a good Virginia
Tech earn, 77-71, in the
tourr. ,ent finals. A Frost jumper
with fifteen seconds pulled
Stanford to within one, with 26
seconds left, but the Gobblers
scored five quick points to decide
the contest.

While most of the Stanford
community was relaxing over the
holidays, the Stanford basketball
team was busy winning four
games and losing three, turning in
several outstanding performances
and a few not-so-impressive
games.
The Cards opened the vacation
with a convincing win over San
Jose State, 75-54. Stanford's
young but tall front line of center
Rich Kelley (7-0), and forwards
Mike Mann (6-9) and Dave Frost
(6-6) dominated the shorter
Spartans, gaining a rebounding
edge of 30-14 in the first half.
Stanford led 40-23 at the
intermission, and coasted the rest
of the way using 13 players,
including freshmen Tim Patterson
and Ed Schweitzer.
Stanford has a perfect 4-0
record in Maples Pavilion, but the
team has not fared so well on the
road. Coach Howie Dallmar
blames much of the trouble on
some very poor free throw
shooting, pointing out the close
losses to Denver, Colorado State,
and Virginia Tech.
The trip to Colorado proved to
be a disaster for the Cards, as they
turned in their worst
performances of the year, bowing
to Denver 77-74, and to Colorado
State the following night, 77-72.
"We lost the Denver game on free
throws," Dallmar lamented.
Kelley turned in his best
performance of the year against
Denver, scoring 24 points and

including freshmen Tim Patterson
and Ed Schweitzer.
Stanford has a perfect 4-0
record in Maples Pavilion, but the
team has not fared so well on the
road. Coach Howie Dallmar
blames much of the trouble on
some very poor free throw
shooting, pointing out the close
losses to Denver, Colorado State,
and Virginia Tech.
The trip to Colorado proved to
be a disaster for the Cards, as they
turned in their worst
performances of the year, bowing
to Denver 77-74, and to Colorado
State the following night, 77-72.
"We lost the Denver game on free
throws," Dallmar lamented.
Kelley turned in his best
performance of the year against
Denver, scoring 24 points and
grabbing 22 rebounds. George
Walls led the winners with 18
points.
Against Colorado State,

cool 39 percent from the floor,
but outrebounded St. Mary's
55-44.
Frost got hot from the outside
in that game, hitting on 10 of 18
shots, and leading all scorers with
21 points. Kelley added 16 points,
and, as usual, led all rebounders
with 14. Versatile senior Bob
Buell turned in a solid
performance, scoring 12 points
and grabbing seven rebounds.
Stanford closed out holiday
activity with a trip to Norfolk,
Virginia for the Kiwanis Old
Dominion Classic. The Cards split
a pair of games, and returned
home with an over-sized second
place trophy.
Down by seven points at the
half, Stanford came back to
defeat Navy in the opening game,
67-61. A tip-in by Mann gave the
Cards a 56-55 lead which they
never relinquished. Kelley fouled
out of the game with 5:50 to
play, but Patterson came in to
spark the Cards by scoring eight
points.
But vacation ended on a
losing r as Stanford dropped a
close r .sion to a good Virginia
Tech earn, 77-71, in the
tourr. ,ent finals. A Frost jumper
with fifteen seconds pulled
Stanford to within one, with 26
seconds left, but the Gobblers
scored five quick points to decide
the contest.

talented front line.

TIP-IN—Junior forward Mike Mann has turned in several excellent
performances this season. Mann, a slender 6-9, was moved to a
forward spot this season to make room for 7-0 center Rich Kelley.
The Cards are 5-4 this year.
