# IM Sign-ups Begin
## 
### 
The intramural basketball
program is being reorganized this
year to accommodate the
increased number of teams. The
IM office announced several
changes yesterday, the most
important of which is the creation
of a third league to allow players
of all abilities to compete.
The 'A' league will consist of
teams from the better dorm,
independent, department, and
fraternity teams. The office
stressed that in order to insure
that teams compete with others of
comparable ability, the 'A' league
should consist of players who
have played organized basketball
before.
The 'B' teams should consist of
players of average skill, and the
'C' league should consist of teams
with less skill, and smaller
numbers from which they can
draw their participants. The
present point structure will still be
used; however, 'C' teams will
receive no points.
There will be tournaments at

the end of the season for both the
'A' and 'B' leagues, while the 'C'
league will have a tournament
only if time and facilities allow.
Team sign-ups will be from
January 4-8, outside the IM office
in the men's gym. In the first two
days of sign ups each affiliation
may enter only two teams.
Starting January 7 affiliations
may enter additional teams.
Competition begins January 9.
The IM office announced
another major change this year.
Team classifications and the days
that each team will play will not
be assigned. Team managers will
indicate the classification of their
teams when signing up, and also
he will indicate the days of the
week on which they will play.
The schedule will be completed
and available at the time of
sign-ups, and the manager is
responsible to make sure that his
team can play on those dates.
A meeting for all intramural
managers is scheduled for January
4, at 4:00 p.m. in room 350 of
