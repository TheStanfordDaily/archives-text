Senate Demos: k Out By Jan. 2(T
WASHINGTON — Senate anti-war leaders yesterday
signaled an informal Jan. 20 deadline for ending the
Vietnam war as the White House cautioned that a
fund cutoff could stall peace negotiations.
Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield
(D-Mont.), urged that Senate committees hold
hearings before President Nixon's second
inauguration on a variety of war-end legislation,
then take action "if things don't go well" in peace
talks resuming Monday in Paris.
Senate Democrats in a private meeting approved
without formal vote a Mansfield statement that
"there is no greater national need than the
termination, forthwith, of our involvement in the
war in Vietnam" and that "it remains for the
Congress to seek to bring about complete
disinvolvement."
Senate Republicans, in a separate meeting, voted
16-10 for a resolution by Sen. Charles Percy of
Illinois supporting "the efforts of the President to
end the tragic conflict in Indochina now through a
negotiated settlement." Fifteen Republican senators
had left the meeting before the resolution was
presented.
At the White House, presidential press secretary
Ronald Ziegler said of a House Democratic Caucus
vote Tuesday supporting a Vietnam fund cutoff:
"Members of Congress should ask themselves if
they want to be responsible for raising doubts in the
enemy's mind about the United States' position and
therefore possibly prolonging the negotiations."
"There can be only one negotiator," Ziegler said.
.. the President must proceed with
negotiations. .. and policies in Vietnam that he
considers right."
Later in the day Nixon met for an hour with
presidential adviser Henry A. Kissinger to discuss
negotiations in Paris which begin Jan. 8.
Aerimonious Viet Talks Continue
PARIS — North Vietnam yesterday stressed twice

that recognition of North and South Vietnam as one
nation is the key to the peace agreement sought in
secret and semipublic talks set to resume here in a
climate of continuing conflict.
The point was expected to be hammered home
again today at the 172 nd session of the semipublic
four-power meetings, suspended for three weeks
during the bombing of North Vietnam.
North Vietnam and the Viet Cong only yesterday
gave a firm agreement to the resumption of the
semipublic talks. They walked out of the Dec. 21
session protesting the bombing and the allied side
rejected their proposal of a Dec. 28 session.
U.S. and Hanoi experts met again in secret
session yesterday, working on annexes to an
eventual cease-fire agreement. In a six-hour, 50
minute session, the longest since the secret talks
were first announced, the technical experts
reportedly considered cease-fire supervision
arrangements.
The supervision issue is one of the stumbling
blocks the United States said have emerged since the
October cease-fire draft was put together in secret
talks.
Chavez Sues Teamsters
SALINAS — Cesar Chavez' United Farm Workers
Union filed suit yesterday to wipe out Teamsters
Union contracts representing thousands of farm
workers in Monterey and San Luis Obispo counties
and the Imperial Valley.
The two lawsuits, filed in U.S. District Court in
San Francisco, seek more than $156.8 million
damages from the Teamsters and 185 California
growers and shippers.
At a news conference at the UFW hiring hall in
Salinas, Chavez said of the Teamsters: "They have
the growers, but we have the workers."
The suits are aimed at 170 contracts signed
between Teamsters and growers in July, 1970.
They claim the contracts were signed to
"artifically depress wages" and are in violation of an
1870 civil rights law giving minority farmworkers

the right to union representation.
Earlier in San Jose, an official of the California
Council of California Growers said Teamsters
representatives will meet with growers today in San
Diego to "solidify their position" as the
representative of farm workers.
Young Voter Turnout Light
WASHINGTON — Despite the effort of both
political parties to get them to the polls, less than
half of the 11 million newly enfranchised young
people from 18 to 20 voted in the 1972 presidential
election, the Census Bureau said yesterday.
In a special survey, the bureau reported that 5.3
million youths between 18 and 20 voted last
November, a figure representing only 48.3 percent
of all those in that age category who were eligible to
vote for the first time nationally.
It was, in the minds of officials at the bureau as
well as politicians, a dismal performance. But it was
not an unexpected result.
Previous census surveys had indicated that if past
patterns held true, candidates should not have
counted on young people to go to the polls in heavy
numbers.
The survey disclosed, however, that efforts to get
the young people registered failed. Only 6.4 million
of those from 18 to 20 said they were registered. Of
those, only 1.1 million failed to vote, meaning that
roughly five of every six young persons between 18
and 20 who were registered actually voted.
Today's Weather
Partly cloudy for a time today with a chance of
showers mainly over coastal hills. Fair otherwise
through tomorrow. Cooler today then warming
tomorrow. Lows tonight in upper 20s and 30s. High
today in mid 40s to low 50s and tomorrow in the
50s. Northwesterly wind 10 to 20 mph.
