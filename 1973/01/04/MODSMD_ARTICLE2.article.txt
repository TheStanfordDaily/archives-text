# Ideals, Philosophies Unchanged
## Lyman Returns To Campus 
### DAVID THIEMANN 
(President Richard Lyman returned
to Stanford in mid-December after a
quarter-long leave of absence. In a
Dec. 29 interview a Daily reporter
questioned Lyman about his leave and
his feelings upon returning to
Stanford.)
President Lyman's 10-week stay in
London did not transform or convert
him philosophically or ideologically, as
some had hoped and others feared, but
it did provide a "magnificent
opportunity to get off the treadmill,"
according to the 49-year-old historian.
After a vacation on an island off
the Maine coast and a brief visit to a
Miami Beach panel discussion for
college administrator's spouses, Lyman
and his wife rented a house in Chelsea.
The president said he deliberately
avoided almost all news from Stanford
while in London and received few
letters from University officials,
avoiding the constant decision-making
which normally occupies a University
administrator.
Provost William Miller and other
senior officials operated independently
in Lyman's absence, delaying only
decisions which seemed both
extremely important and irreversible.
The Lymans intentionally traveled
very little in England, and visited the
continent only for a brief trip to
Amsterdam art galleries.
Spend Time Reading
Lyman spent a large part of his
time reading — about British current

events, modem British history (his
academic specialty), higher education,
and some unrelated subjects.
In addition, they frequently
attended concerts and plays, and (at
Jing's instigation) visited many art
galleries.
"I found myself more interested in
art than I knew I was, and find myself
responding to paintings in a way more
analagous to the way I responded to
music than has ever been the case
before," Lyman noted. "I don't think
I've ever had the range of emotional
response that I had on occasion this
time."
Picture Can't Be Painted
The president returned
strengthened, if anything, in his
conviction that "no one person is
going to sit back and paint a picture
that will represent with any degree of
accuracy what a large and complex
institution like this is going to look
like in 10 years time.
"It's certainly true that the
president of a university ought to have
some principles and ideas about higher
education but that's not the same as
saying he ought to be in a position to
or try to paint a detailed blueprint.
"I think today especially it is very
natural that people will often have a
hunger to have somebody — anybody
— tell them how to get out of this
forest."
Fundamentally Academic
After the leave Lyman says he is
more persuaded than ever that he is

"fundamentally an academic person,"
without any temptation to gravitate
into any other profession.
"I vastly enjoyed the opportunity
to be an intellectual dilettante, in part
— to read about things I didn't have to
do anything about immediately, that
explored subjects in an academic and
analytical way."

'THE MAN' RETURNS — University Pres. Richard Lyman has returned after a
quarter-long leave of absence. Lyman and his wife vacationed on an island off
the Maine coast, attended a conference in Miami Beach, and travelled to
London, where the University President spent a large part of his time reading
about British history and current events.
