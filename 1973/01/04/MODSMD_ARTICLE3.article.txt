# Former Prof. Franklin, Seven Others Arrested
## 
### DAVID THIEMANN 
The dimensions of a Chino prison
escape and murder case widened again
just before Christmas, as law
enforcement officers arrested fired
Stanford English Prof. H. Bruce
Franklin, four other Venceremos
members, and three Arizona residents.
A week earlier, San Francisco
policemen and California Highway
Patrol officers had arrested the
escapee, Ronald Wayne Beaty, and
prominent Palo Alto radical and
unsuccessful city council candidate
Jean Hobson on the Bay Bridge.
There have been 14 arrests to date
in the case, and 12 people are now
charged either with murder or with
harboring Beaty, a federal fugitive.
Hobson and Beaty were arrested
together after police allegedly received
two anonymous tips identifying their

hideout and detailing plans to drive
across the bridge.
Weapons Found
They surrendered quietly, although
both carried loaded pistols. Officers
found a sawed-off shotgun, two
.45-caliber pistols, an M-l carbine, two
gas grenades, and a large quantity of
ammunition in their car.
Authorities immediately
transported both to San Bernadino,
where they joined Andrea Holman and
Douglas Benton Burt in jail. All are
charged with murder and lynching
(removing a prisoner from official
custody).
Franklin and the seven others were
seized in a coordinated series of
early-moming raids after Beaty
allegedly implicated them in an
eight-hour confession to San
Bemadino detective Rod Maniord.

Federal Bureau of Investigation
agents broke into Franklin's Menlo
Park home at about 7 a.m. Dec. 19
with shotguns at the ready, and
arrested him on a warrant for
harboring a federal fugitive.
At about the same time, FBI agents
and San Bernadino Sheriff's deputies
arrested Robert Allan Seabock, a
23-year-old Venceremos member, at
his Palo Alto home on a murder
warrant.
In affidavits supporting the
warrant, deputies alleged that Seabock
was the trigger-man in the escape.
After the arrest, police cordoned off
Channing Street in front of the house
while an Army bomb squad searched
for explosives.
Several Weapons Removed
Later, authorities removed several
weapons, including pistols, a sawed-off
shotgun, rifles and shotguns, large
quantities of ammunition, 12 canisters
of tear gas and smoke, a box of
unloaded military-type practice
grenades, the components of a
pipe-bomb, some explosive black
powder, various items of stolen
property, and literature on weapons
and explosives.
FBI agents also arrested three other

Venceremos members: Bruce Warren
Hobson, 23, a Mountain View
resident; Morton Newman of Menlo
Park; and Charles Woodbridge Noble,
25, of Palo Alto.
All were charged with harboring a
federal fugitive and released in San
Francisco on bail — $10,000 for
everyone but Noble, who received
$5,000 bail — despite government
pleas for a "very, very substantial
bail."

In Fort Defiance, Arizona, FBI
agents arrested Dr. Harry Bishara, 27,
a medical officer with the U.S. Public
Health Service, his wife Lorraine, an J
Michael Goldstein, a former Stanford
law student working in a federally
funded law project.
The Bisharas were released on
$15,000 bail, Goldstein on $5,000. All
were charged with harboring a federal
fugitive.
A preliminary examination for
Franklin and the three others on
harboring charges is scheduled for
Friday in San Francisco.
Trial Set For Monday
Jean Hobson and Seabock have had
their case severed from that of
Holman, daughter of Stanford
Medicine Prof. Halsted Holman, and
Burt. The latter two, represented by
attorney Charles Garry, are scheduled
to go to trial next Monday unless a
change of venue motion delays the
proceedings.
All defendants in the murder case
have pled not guilty.
Venceremos, the Peninsula-based
revolutionary organization which had
originally supported Beaty in his
escape, has proclaimed him an "enemy
of the people" and denounced his
confession as a frame-up.
According to Franklin, Beaty was
"recruited in prison into Venceremos.
He never operated under our discipline

but we considered him a brother." The
former professor labeled Beaty's
confession "an attempt to save his
own skin."
His attorney, Garry, suggested that
the entire escape confession could be
an FBI plot to "get" Venceremos:
"This is a story the FBI put together
to destroy Venceremos and now they
have Beaty working for them."
Venceremos spokesmen claim that
Jean Hobson had left their
organization a month before her arrest
on Dec. 11, and that Seabock had not
been a member for a year.
They also disclaim any knowledge
of Goldstein, who defended students
before the Campus Judicial Panel at
Stanford last year, or of the Bisharas.
In his confession, Beaty allegedly
accused Franklin of masterminding a
series of trips which took the convict
to Arizona and around the Bay Area.
The confession named Seabock as
the trigger-man, saying that he shot
the two unarmed guards at point-blank
range.
According to affidavits supporting
the warrants, Jean Hobson then
accompanied him to Mountain View,
where he met her son, Bruce Hobson.
The two then drove him to a remote
mountain cabin an hour away from
Mountain View, where he and the
elder Hobson remained for a month
with occasional visits from Bruce
Hobson, who brought supplies.

organization a month before her arrest
on Dec. 11, and that Seabock had not
been a member for a year.
They also disclaim any knowledge
of Goldstein, who defended students
before the Campus Judicial Panel at
Stanford last year, or of the Bisharas.
In his confession, Beaty allegedly
accused Franklin of masterminding a
series of trips which took the convict
to Arizona and around the Bay Area.
The confession named Seabock as
the trigger-man, saying that he shot
the two unarmed guards at point-blank
range.
According to affidavits supporting
the warrants, Jean Hobson then
accompanied him to Mountain View,
where he met her son, Bruce Hobson.
The two then drove him to a remote
mountain cabin an hour away from
Mountain View, where he and the
elder Hobson remained for a month
with occasional visits from Bruce
Hobson, who brought supplies.
The dimensions of a Chino prison
escape and murder case widened again
just before Christmas, as law
enforcement officers arrested fired
Stanford English Prof. H. Bruce
Franklin, four other Venceremos
members, and three Arizona residents.
A week earlier, San Francisco
policemen and California Highway
Patrol officers had arrested the
escapee, Ronald Wayne Beaty, and
prominent Palo Alto radical and
unsuccessful city council candidate
Jean Hobson on the Bay Bridge.
There have been 14 arrests to date
in the case, and 12 people are now
charged either with murder or with
harboring Beaty, a federal fugitive.
Hobson and Beaty were arrested
together after police allegedly received
two anonymous tips identifying their

hideout and detailing plans to drive
across the bridge.
Weapons Found
They surrendered quietly, although
both carried loaded pistols. Officers
found a sawed-off shotgun, two
.45-caliber pistols, an M-l carbine, two
gas grenades, and a large quantity of
ammunition in their car.
Authorities immediately
transported both to San Bernadino,
where they joined Andrea Holman and
Douglas Benton Burt in jail. All are
charged with murder and lynching
(removing a prisoner from official
custody).
Franklin and the seven others were
seized in a coordinated series of
early-moming raids after Beaty
allegedly implicated them in an
eight-hour confession to San
Bemadino detective Rod Maniord.

Federal Bureau of Investigation
agents broke into Franklin's Menlo
Park home at about 7 a.m. Dec. 19
with shotguns at the ready, and
arrested him on a warrant for
harboring a federal fugitive.
At about the same time, FBI agents
and San Bernadino Sheriff's deputies
arrested Robert Allan Seabock, a
23-year-old Venceremos member, at
his Palo Alto home on a murder
warrant.
In affidavits supporting the
warrant, deputies alleged that Seabock
was the trigger-man in the escape.
After the arrest, police cordoned off
Channing Street in front of the house
while an Army bomb squad searched
for explosives.
Several Weapons Removed
Later, authorities removed several
weapons, including pistols, a sawed-off
shotgun, rifles and shotguns, large
quantities of ammunition, 12 canisters
of tear gas and smoke, a box of
unloaded military-type practice
grenades, the components of a
pipe-bomb, some explosive black
powder, various items of stolen
property, and literature on weapons
and explosives.
FBI agents also arrested three other

Venceremos members: Bruce Warren
Hobson, 23, a Mountain View
resident; Morton Newman of Menlo
Park; and Charles Woodbridge Noble,
25, of Palo Alto.
All were charged with harboring a
federal fugitive and released in San
Francisco on bail — $10,000 for
everyone but Noble, who received
$5,000 bail — despite government
pleas for a "very, very substantial
bail."

In Fort Defiance, Arizona, FBI
agents arrested Dr. Harry Bishara, 27,
a medical officer with the U.S. Public
Health Service, his wife Lorraine, an J
Michael Goldstein, a former Stanford
law student working in a federally
funded law project.
The Bisharas were released on
$15,000 bail, Goldstein on $5,000. All
were charged with harboring a federal
fugitive.
A preliminary examination for
Franklin and the three others on
harboring charges is scheduled for
Friday in San Francisco.
Trial Set For Monday
Jean Hobson and Seabock have had
their case severed from that of
Holman, daughter of Stanford
Medicine Prof. Halsted Holman, and
Burt. The latter two, represented by
attorney Charles Garry, are scheduled
to go to trial next Monday unless a
change of venue motion delays the
proceedings.
All defendants in the murder case
have pled not guilty.
Venceremos, the Peninsula-based
revolutionary organization which had
originally supported Beaty in his
escape, has proclaimed him an "enemy
of the people" and denounced his
confession as a frame-up.
According to Franklin, Beaty was
"recruited in prison into Venceremos.
He never operated under our discipline

but we considered him a brother." The
former professor labeled Beaty's
confession "an attempt to save his
own skin."
His attorney, Garry, suggested that
the entire escape confession could be
an FBI plot to "get" Venceremos:
"This is a story the FBI put together
to destroy Venceremos and now they
have Beaty working for them."

change of venue motion delays the
proceedings.
All defendants in the murder case
have pled not guilty.
Venceremos, the Peninsula-based
revolutionary organization which had
originally supported Beaty in his
escape, has proclaimed him an "enemy
of the people" and denounced his
confession as a frame-up.
According to Franklin, Beaty was
"recruited in prison into Venceremos.
He never operated under our discipline

but we considered him a brother." The
former professor labeled Beaty's
confession "an attempt to save his
own skin."
His attorney, Garry, suggested that
the entire escape confession could be
an FBI plot to "get" Venceremos:
"This is a story the FBI put together
to destroy Venceremos and now they
have Beaty working for them."
Venceremos spokesmen claim that
Jean Hobson had left their
organization a month before her arrest
on Dec. 11, and that Seabock had not
been a member for a year.
They also disclaim any knowledge
of Goldstein, who defended students
before the Campus Judicial Panel at
Stanford last year, or of the Bisharas.
In his confession, Beaty allegedly
accused Franklin of masterminding a
series of trips which took the convict
to Arizona and around the Bay Area.
The confession named Seabock as
the trigger-man, saying that he shot
the two unarmed guards at point-blank
range.
According to affidavits supporting
the warrants, Jean Hobson then
accompanied him to Mountain View,
where he met her son, Bruce Hobson.
The two then drove him to a remote
mountain cabin an hour away from
Mountain View, where he and the
elder Hobson remained for a month
with occasional visits from Bruce
Hobson, who brought supplies.
The dimensions of a Chino prison
escape and murder case widened again
just before Christmas, as law
enforcement officers arrested fired
Stanford English Prof. H. Bruce
Franklin, four other Venceremos
members, and three Arizona residents.
A week earlier, San Francisco
policemen and California Highway
Patrol officers had arrested the
escapee, Ronald Wayne Beaty, and
prominent Palo Alto radical and
unsuccessful city council candidate
Jean Hobson on the Bay Bridge.
There have been 14 arrests to date
in the case, and 12 people are now
charged either with murder or with
harboring Beaty, a federal fugitive.
Hobson and Beaty were arrested
together after police allegedly received
two anonymous tips identifying their

hideout and detailing plans to drive
across the bridge.
Weapons Found
They surrendered quietly, although
both carried loaded pistols. Officers
found a sawed-off shotgun, two
.45-caliber pistols, an M-l carbine, two
gas grenades, and a large quantity of
ammunition in their car.
Authorities immediately
transported both to San Bernadino,
where they joined Andrea Holman and
Douglas Benton Burt in jail. All are
charged with murder and lynching
(removing a prisoner from official
custody).
Franklin and the seven others were
seized in a coordinated series of
early-moming raids after Beaty
allegedly implicated them in an
eight-hour confession to San
Bemadino detective Rod Maniord.

Federal Bureau of Investigation
agents broke into Franklin's Menlo
Park home at about 7 a.m. Dec. 19
with shotguns at the ready, and
arrested him on a warrant for
harboring a federal fugitive.
At about the same time, FBI agents
and San Bernadino Sheriff's deputies
arrested Robert Allan Seabock, a
23-year-old Venceremos member, at
his Palo Alto home on a murder
warrant.
In affidavits supporting the
warrant, deputies alleged that Seabock
was the trigger-man in the escape.
After the arrest, police cordoned off
Channing Street in front of the house
while an Army bomb squad searched
for explosives.
Several Weapons Removed
Later, authorities removed several
weapons, including pistols, a sawed-off
shotgun, rifles and shotguns, large
quantities of ammunition, 12 canisters
of tear gas and smoke, a box of
unloaded military-type practice
grenades, the components of a
pipe-bomb, some explosive black
powder, various items of stolen
property, and literature on weapons
and explosives.
FBI agents also arrested three other

Venceremos members: Bruce Warren
Hobson, 23, a Mountain View
resident; Morton Newman of Menlo
Park; and Charles Woodbridge Noble,
25, of Palo Alto.
All were charged with harboring a
federal fugitive and released in San
Francisco on bail — $10,000 for
everyone but Noble, who received
$5,000 bail — despite government
pleas for a "very, very substantial
bail."

In Fort Defiance, Arizona, FBI
agents arrested Dr. Harry Bishara, 27,
a medical officer with the U.S. Public
Health Service, his wife Lorraine, an J
Michael Goldstein, a former Stanford
law student working in a federally
funded law project.
The Bisharas were released on
$15,000 bail, Goldstein on $5,000. All
were charged with harboring a federal
fugitive.
A preliminary examination for
Franklin and the three others on
harboring charges is scheduled for
Friday in San Francisco.
Trial Set For Monday
Jean Hobson and Seabock have had
their case severed from that of
Holman, daughter of Stanford
Medicine Prof. Halsted Holman, and
Burt. The latter two, represented by
attorney Charles Garry, are scheduled
to go to trial next Monday unless a
change of venue motion delays the
proceedings.
