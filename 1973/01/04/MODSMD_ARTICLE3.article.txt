### DAVID THIEMANN 
The dimensions of a Chino prison
escape and murder case widened again
just before Christmas, as law
enforcement officers arrested fired
Stanford English Prof. H. Bruce
Franklin, four other Venceremos
members, and three Arizona residents.
A week earlier, San Francisco
policemen and California Highway
Patrol officers had arrested the
escapee, Ronald Wayne Beaty, and
prominent Palo Alto radical and
unsuccessful city council candidate
Jean Hobson on the Bay Bridge.
There have been 14 arrests to date
in the case, and 12 people are now
charged either with murder or with
harboring Beaty, a federal fugitive.
Hobson and Beaty were arrested
together after police allegedly received
two anonymous tips identifying their

hideout and detailing plans to drive
across the bridge.
Weapons Found
They surrendered quietly, although
both carried loaded pistols. Officers
found a sawed-off shotgun, two
.45-caliber pistols, an M-l carbine, two
gas grenades, and a large quantity of
ammunition in their car.
Authorities immediately
transported both to San Bernadino,
where they joined Andrea Holman and
Douglas Benton Burt in jail. All are
charged with murder and lynching
(removing a prisoner from official
custody).
Franklin and the seven others were
seized in a coordinated series of
early-moming raids after Beaty
allegedly implicated them in an
eight-hour confession to San
Bemadino detective Rod Maniord.

Federal Bureau of Investigation
agents broke into Franklin's Menlo
Park home at about 7 a.m. Dec. 19
with shotguns at the ready, and
arrested him on a warrant for
harboring a federal fugitive.
At about the same time, FBI agents
and San Bernadino Sheriff's deputies
arrested Robert Allan Seabock, a
23-year-old Venceremos member, at
his Palo Alto home on a murder
warrant.
In affidavits supporting the
warrant, deputies alleged that Seabock
was the trigger-man in the escape.
After the arrest, police cordoned off
Channing Street in front of the house
while an Army bomb squad searched
for explosives.
Several Weapons Removed
Later, authorities removed several
