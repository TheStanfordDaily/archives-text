# Coyote Hill Industrial Use Lawsuit Settled
## 
### ROBERT BACON 
The three-year-old lawsuit over
industrial development of
Stanford-owned Coyote Hill has been
finally settled.
The out-of-court settlement,
hastened by Xerox Corporation's plans
to build its corporate research
headquarters on the site, had been
negotiated for several months. Final
details were settled on Dec. 15.
About half the area will be left in
open space for at least twenty years,
and the other half will be made
available for industrial development in
accordance with strict aesthetic
standards.
On Dec. 11, Palo Alto's long-time
Urban Development-Open Space Plan
was referred to the City Planning
Commission by the City Council. The
University will ask the Commission to
amend it to bring it into conformity
with the Coyote Hill settlement.
Green Foothills
The Committee for Green Foothills
sued Stanford and Palo Alto in
November 1969 to halt industrial
development on the hill. They charged
that Stanford and the city had not
followed required procedures in
subdividing and zoning the land, and
that two city councilmen who voted in
favor of the development were in
conflict of interest.
The following year the procedural
aspect of the suit was decided in
Stanford's favor. The conflict of
interest portion was declared moot in
1971 when the City Council ratified
its earlier decision, without the two
challenged members taking part.
Both portions of the suit were
appealled by the plaintiffs, and were
pending before the state appeals court
when the settlement was negotiated.
90 Acres Open
Under terms of the settlement, the
top of the hill and its west flank,
facing Deer Creek, totaling 90 acres,
will be left open.
Xerox will occupy two lots
totalling 14 acres at the corner of
Hillview Avenue and Coyote Hill
Road, on the northeast side of the hill.
Seven other lots on the south and
east side of the hill, totalling 65 acres,
will be available for lease to other
tenants. A Fairchild Camera and
Instrument Corporation facility is
located on 25 additional acres in the
area.
Only Available Land
The Coyote Hill site is bounded by
Coyote Hill Road, Hillview Avenue,
Arastraaoro Road, and Deer Creek. It

is located south of (uphill from) the
present Stanford Industrial Park. It
constitutes the only Stanford land
presently available for industrial
development.
University Vice President for
Business and Finance Robert R.
Augsburger said last fall that the desire
to attract the Xerox facility to
Stanford was instrumental in bringing
about the settlement.
He called Xerox "a quality
company, one that will be able to
interrelate with Stanford in many
ways and a company with a social
consciousness. Both Xerox and
Stanford have attempted to be
sensitive to community desires for the
preservation of open space and natural
scenic beauty in this urban transition
area."
"We want that type of operation,"
Augsburger summed up. He praised
Xerox's plan for a low-lying building
appropriate to the hillside site.
Long-Term Plan
Bringing the city's long-term open
space plan into conformity with the
Stanford-Xerox agreement was the
final step in negotiating the
settlement.
Palo Alto's planners had described
the west flank of the hill as
"permanent open space" while
University officials had insisted that it
be classed as "long-term open space."
This issue has not been finally

settled; the city Planning Commission
will study it "in four or five months,"
according to Commission Chairman
Mary Gordon. But all parties to the
lawsuit agreed on the settlement
without insisting on a final decision on
the open space plan.
Reduced Property Taxation
Another key step in arranging the
settlement was approval by the Santa
Clara County assessor of reduced
property taxation for the land to be
left open. Under state law, the 20-year
prohibition on development of the
open area permits it to be assessed for

taxation purposes at a value much less
than its value as industrial land.
The top of Coyote Hill is zoned for
agriculture and is part of the
University's Academic Reserve. The
four westside lots being left open will
remain in an industrial zone for the
time being, despite the 20-year
development moratorium.
Pending Twelve Years
The Coyote Hill project has been
pending for 12 years. Annexation and
industrial zoning was granted by the
Palo Alto City Council in May 1960,
