# Anti-War Rally Slated For Noon
## 
### 
An anti-war rally, organized by a coalition of Stanford
community groups opposing United States' policy in
Southeast Asia, will begin at noon today in White Plaza.
Speakers at the rally will discuss the present state of
the war, urge adoption of the nine-point peace plan, and
present various proposals for bringing the bombing and
killing to an end, says coordinator Dave Josephson.
Scheduled speakers include Robert McAfee Brown,
dean of the chapel, Doris Youdelman of Venceremos, and
Kevin O'Grady, former coordinator of the McGovern
campaign at Stanford. Representatives of the Stanford
American Indian Association, MEChA, the Black Students
Union, and the Asian-American Students Association will
also appear at the rally.
The speakers represent the various community groups
interested in organizing action against the renewed
bombing of North Vietnam. Columbae, a non-violent
theme house, coordinated the efforts of the groups at a
meeting last Tuesday night. Approximately 75 people
were present at the meeting, including a number of
interested students not affiliated with any particular
organization.
An "open mike" session, chaired by ASSU
Co-President Brent Appel, will follow the speeches.

Anyone wishing to suggest anti-war action on campus or
to report on other action throughout the country will be
given access to the microphone.
Appel described the purpose of the rally as "organizing
into effective action the strong opposition in the Stanford
community to Nixon's war policy," but organizers of the
effort do not claim to advocate any one course of action
in particular.
Specific proposals for constructive action, such as
medical aid to North Vietnam, will be presented at the
rally. Some local groups suggest action against war-related
activities by businesses in the Stanford Industrial Park.
Venceremos plans to ask the University to donate
$50,000 to a North Vietnamese hospital fund, as a
payment for its involvement in developing "smart"
laser-guided bombs.
The fund effort was initiated on a national level by
former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark, for the
benefit of the Bach Mai Hospital which was extensively
damaged in recent American bombing of Hanoi.
.losephson foresees increased campus involvement in
constructive anti-war action as a result of the rally,
beginning with discussions of various action proposals in
the dorms.
