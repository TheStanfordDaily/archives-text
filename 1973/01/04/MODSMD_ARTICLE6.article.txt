## Vietnam 
### 
It is ironic that during the holiday season of supposed peace and
goodwill, Richard Nixon would order some of the most barbaric air
attacks in history.
Over two months ago, in what is now being correctly perceived as a
detestable political ploy, Henry Kissinger told the American people
that a settlement was only a few minor details away.
On Nov. 7 it was obvious that most Americans believed Nixon and
Kissinger. In the last few weeks that faith has been completely
betrayed and as thousands of tons of bombs have rained down upon
an already ravaged nation, it is clear that Nixon hasn't changed at all.
The same kind of deceit, cruelty and maniacal egotism that
characterized Nixon's first administration has been vividly reinforced
by the escalation of the bombing of North Vietnam.
Can any reasonable person now wonder why so many people
strongly opposed the President's reelection? Can anyone wonder why
so many have protested so hard for so long? Can anyone wonder why
there is such internal turmoil in this country today? We frankly don't
sec how.
The terror bombing of North Vietnam was without doubt one of
the most treacherous acts of aggression in history. World leaders of all
political persuasions condemned the bombing. At home, countless
Congressmen and other national leaders expressed justified outrage at
Nixon's latest example of inhumanity.
And yet the President continued the bombing which destroyed
huge areas of Hanoi and even damaged a civilian airport and a
hospital. Nixon has at least temporarily relented in the face of
overwhelming opposition, but below the 20th Parallel and in other
areas of Indochina, the needless bombing and killing still goes on.
Once again we are told that a settlement is near. Frankly, we're very
skeptical.
The events of recent weeks have shown that Richard Nixon feels
that the corrupt Thieu regime must be propped up at all costs. The
President continues to bow to Thieu's selfish wishes and nothing
indicates that Nixon has changed his demand for a so-called
"honorable peace." We fear that the tragedy of recent weeks could
easily be repeated
An encouraging note came out of Washington Tuesday when the
Democratic Caucus voted overwhelmingly in favor of immediately
cutting off funds for the war. But hopes of Congressional action have
existed before and have always turned into bitter disappointments.
Still our skepticism must not lead to apathy. We must urge all
Congressme to act quickly to prevent Nixon from causing more
tragedies. We've protested for a long time, but we must not quit now.
All decent people must actively protest what has happened in recent
weeks and work even harder to bring about that long elusive peace.

the most treacherous acts of aggression in history. World leaders of all
political persuasions condemned the bombing. At home, countless
Congressmen and other national leaders expressed justified outrage at
Nixon's latest example of inhumanity.
And yet the President continued the bombing which destroyed
huge areas of Hanoi and even damaged a civilian airport and a
hospital. Nixon has at least temporarily relented in the face of
overwhelming opposition, but below the 20th Parallel and in other
areas of Indochina, the needless bombing and killing still goes on.
Once again we are told that a settlement is near. Frankly, we're very
skeptical.
The events of recent weeks have shown that Richard Nixon feels
that the corrupt Thieu regime must be propped up at all costs. The
President continues to bow to Thieu's selfish wishes and nothing
indicates that Nixon has changed his demand for a so-called
"honorable peace." We fear that the tragedy of recent weeks could
easily be repeated
An encouraging note came out of Washington Tuesday when the
Democratic Caucus voted overwhelmingly in favor of immediately
cutting off funds for the war. But hopes of Congressional action have
existed before and have always turned into bitter disappointments.
Still our skepticism must not lead to apathy. We must urge all
Congressme to act quickly to prevent Nixon from causing more
tragedies. We've protested for a long time, but we must not quit now.
All decent people must actively protest what has happened in recent
weeks and work even harder to bring about that long elusive peace.
