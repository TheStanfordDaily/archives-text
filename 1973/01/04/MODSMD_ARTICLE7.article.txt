## Truman's Cold War Foreign Policy

Harry S. Truman, the
thirty-third President of the
United States is now dead, and
commentators have found this a
fitting time to assess the policies
and programs of his Presidency.
The Jan. 2 New York Times
had a story headlined "Conduct
of Cold War by Truman Stirs
Dispute Among Writers of Books
on His Presidency." This headline
sums up a very real situation:
Truman's foreign policy is a topic
for disputatious wrangling among
those who study American
history.
Specifically, there are two
camps of historians. The first
holds the orthodox position and
sees the Truman Presidency as a
time when a reluctant American
government finally faced up to an
aggressive Soviet Union.
The other camp of historians
seeks to revise the orthodox
viewpoint. These "revisionist"
scholars maintain that during the
Truman Presidency a hesitant,
conservative Soviet Union was
confronted by an America
desiring global hegemony. It is
this latter interpretation of the
Truman years that I intend to
describe at greater length here,
focusing on such matters as the
dropping of the atomic bomb and
American intervention in Korea.
New Style And Tone
When Truman became
President after FDR's death, he
brought a new style and tone to
American foreign policy. In the
words of Stanford historian
Barton J. Bernstein: "There is
evidence that Russian policies
were reasonably cautious and
conservative, and that there was at
least a basis for accommodation.
But this possibility slowly slipped
away as President Harry S.
Truman reversed Roosevelt's
tactics of accommodation."
Truman and his advisers had in
a sense aimed the atom bombs
dropped on Hiroshima and
Nagasaki at the Soviet Union,
according to some revisionist

historians. The bombs were
intended to fall physically in
Japan, but their political impact
was directed against the Kremlin.
The use of the bomb by the
U.S. in confronting the Soviet
Union diplomatically in Europe is
described by Gar Alperovitz in the
concluding lines of his book
Atomic Diplomacy (1965): "The
evidence strongly suggests that the
view which [Truman's] personal
representative offered to one of
the atomic scientists in May 1945
was an accurate statement of
policy: 'Mr. Byrnes did not argue
that it was necessary to use the
bomb against the cities of Japan
in order to win the war .. . Mr.
Byrnes's view [was] that our
possessing and demonstrating the
bomb would make Russia more
manageable in Europe.' "
Mass Murder
While another revisionist
historian Gabriel Kolko has a
quieter view of the importance of
the bomb in early Cold War
diplomacy, his discussion of mass
murder from the air pinpoints the
ethical question involved: "The
basic moral decision that the
Americans had to make during the
war was whether or not they
would violate international law by
indiscriminately attacking and
destroying civilians, and they
resolved that dilemma within the
context of conventional weapons
[with the incendiary bomb raids
on Hamburg, Dresden, Tokyo,
Nagoya, Osaka, and Kobe] ....
In fact the atomic bomb used
against Hiroshima was less lethal
than massive fire bombing. . . .
Only its technique was novel —
nothing more."
Kolko goes on to recount the
following gruesome conversation
between Secretary of War Henry
L. Stimson and President Truman:
"I was a little fearful," Stimson
told Truman, "that before we
could get ready the Air Force
might have Japan so thoroughly
bombed out that the new weapon
would not have a fair background

to show its strength." To this the
President "laughed and said he
understood."
As another illustration of
Truman's foreign policy,
consideration should also be given
to the Korean War. Here a highly
volatile civil war between the
governments in North and South
Korea had briefly escalated when,
as it appears according to Kolko,
"the North Koreans ... embarked
on a limited war to capture the
Seoul region and shake loose
[Syngman] Rhee's government,
possibly to open negotiations with
the new assembly on favorable
terms."
Fraudulent Collapse
But according to the evidence
as Kolko sifts it, the North
Koreans' limited-purpose venture
was seized upon and used by
others — Rhee, General
Mac Arthur in Japan, and Dean
Acheson in the U.S. State
Department. Rhee's South Korean

government apparently feigned
total collapse after being hit with
only half the North Korean Army;
this gave Mac Arthur justification
for promoting American air and
then land involvement.
In his turn, as Kolko describes
it, "Acheson and the State
Department appreciated the value
of a moderate crisis in getting
numerous global projects and
appropriations out of an
indifferent and hostile Congress."
Stephen E. Ambrose describes
the torrent of global involvement
immediately set off by the Korean
War as follows:
Truman Doctrine Extended
"In a statement released at
noon from the White House,
[Truman] formally extended the
Truman Doctrine to the Pacific by
pledging the United States to
military intervention against any
further expansion of communist
rule in Asia. He announced that
he was extending military aid to

the French, who were trying to
put down a nationalist uprising in
Indochina, and to the Philippines,
where the Huks continued to
challenge the government
Truman also ordered the Seventh
Fleet to 'prevent any attack on
Formosa.' "
Ambrose sums up these actions
taken within 24 hours of the
onset of the Korean War by saying,
"America had thus become
involved in the Chinese Civil War,
the Philippines insurrection, and
the conflict in Indochina."
The evidence presented in full
in the works of the revisionist
historians shows that America
during the Truman
Administration bears the primary
responsibility for the Cold War.
The fruit of the global
interventionism of that era has
been the Vietnam war.
