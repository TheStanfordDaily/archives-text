# 'we must act again'
## 'Peace Is Not At Hand' 
###

Astrology may not be in, but you can tell
Nixon's going to escalate the War whenever the U.S.
has a manned space-shot, if not more often.
In two weeks of bombing, Nixon destroyed
hospitals and homes in North Vietnam, at least
fifteen B-52 bombers, and his election majority.
Nixon and his friends decided that the world should
know what happens when a small country attempts
to resist the United States of America.
For a few days anti-war people were dejected.
Nothing, we felt, could stop Nixon. But he was
stopped.
Nixon says the bombing forced the Vietnamese
back to the negotiating table, but that is where they
were when the bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong
started. Opposition from abroad, from Congress,
and from the anti-war movement forced the Nixon
administration to de-escalate.
Bad News
But all the bombing has not halted. It is now
restricted to Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam below
the Twentieth Parallel. That's bad news.
But there is good news. More people, from
Senator Saxbe to the man on the street, now know
that peace is not at hand.
Our government's actions over Christmas
vacation brought out, once again, our duty to act.
Widespread opposition to Nixon's policies gives us
the mandate to act. The problem: what can we do?
Most people are tired of the same old tactics:
marches, sit-ins, writing congressmen, supporting

resisters in the military. But the old tactics have
been effective.
Had the anti-war movement not done these
things, then hundreds of thousands of gung-ho
American troops would now occupy Indochina. The
war is not over, but the Vietnamese and other
Indochinese have a fighting chance at independence.
Most people in the peace movement still find it
hard to shout slogans calling for an NLF victory.
But the NLF's revolution is strikingly similar to the
American revolution of 1776, though the NLF
program goes further. Anything we do against the
war helps the NLF. The stronger the NLF, the more
likely Vietnam will be an independent nation.
Debate Over Tactics
Over the next weeks we will again hear
arguments over which tactics are most effective. I
personally prefer activities aimed at local
participation in the War — be it electronics
produced in the Industrial Park or aircraft carriers
refitted in Alameda. But these debates don't worry
me.
I have only one worry. That Nixon will convince
us that we cannot affect his policies and we'll sit
back and do nothing, giving him a mandate for
terror.
Unless we act. White House publicists will soon
tout Richard M. Nixon as the man who de-escalated
a war more times (of course, each time he escalates)
than any Commander in Chief in history.

Most people are tired of the same old tactics:
marches, sit-ins, writing congressmen, supporting

resisters in the military. But the old tactics have
been effective.
Had the anti-war movement not done these
things, then hundreds of thousands of gung-ho
American troops would now occupy Indochina. The
war is not over, but the Vietnamese and other
Indochinese have a fighting chance at independence.
Most people in the peace movement still find it
hard to shout slogans calling for an NLF victory.
But the NLF's revolution is strikingly similar to the
American revolution of 1776, though the NLF
program goes further. Anything we do against the
war helps the NLF. The stronger the NLF, the more
likely Vietnam will be an independent nation.
Debate Over Tactics
Over the next weeks we will again hear
arguments over which tactics are most effective. I
personally prefer activities aimed at local
participation in the War — be it electronics
produced in the Industrial Park or aircraft carriers
refitted in Alameda. But these debates don't worry
me.
I have only one worry. That Nixon will convince
us that we cannot affect his policies and we'll sit
back and do nothing, giving him a mandate for
terror.
Unless we act. White House publicists will soon
tout Richard M. Nixon as the man who de-escalated
a war more times (of course, each time he escalates)
than any Commander in Chief in history.

Astrology may not be in, but you can tell
Nixon's going to escalate the War whenever the U.S.
has a manned space-shot, if not more often.
In two weeks of bombing, Nixon destroyed
hospitals and homes in North Vietnam, at least
fifteen B-52 bombers, and his election majority.
Nixon and his friends decided that the world should
know what happens when a small country attempts
to resist the United States of America.
For a few days anti-war people were dejected.
Nothing, we felt, could stop Nixon. But he was
stopped.
Nixon says the bombing forced the Vietnamese
back to the negotiating table, but that is where they
were when the bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong
started. Opposition from abroad, from Congress,
and from the anti-war movement forced the Nixon
administration to de-escalate.
Bad News
But all the bombing has not halted. It is now
restricted to Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam below
the Twentieth Parallel. That's bad news.
But there is good news. More people, from
Senator Saxbe to the man on the street, now know
that peace is not at hand.
Our government's actions over Christmas
vacation brought out, once again, our duty to act.
Widespread opposition to Nixon's policies gives us
the mandate to act. The problem: what can we do?
