# 500 Attend Quiet Rally To Protest Viet Bombing
## 
### 
Speakers appealed for aid to victims
of the renewed bombing of North
Vietnam and denounced United
States' policy in Southeast Asia before
some 500 people at a noon anti-war
rally in White Plaza yesterday.
As the quiet meeting ended, five
Sheriff's deputies arrested Mark Weiss,
a biochemistry graduate student, for
allegedly hitting a plainclothes deputy
in the mouth.
Robert McAfee Brown, interim
dean of the chapel, headlined the list
of speakers. He urged passion
moderated with clear-headedness in
response to what he called "the most
massive and insane bombing raids in
history" and to President Nixon's
"game plans" in Southeast Asia.
Brown criticized such slogans as
"Bomb Stanford, Not Hanoi," as he
warned his listeners against adopting
the very tactics under protest. "Our

objective is to see that nobody bombs
anybody," he said.
Congressional Mood
He cited the "new attitude" in
Congress as the best hope for ending
the bombing raids.
Brown is backing efforts to send
lobbyists to Washington, and to collect
funds for a saturation anti-war
publicity campaign in the capital. He
will leave on Sunday for Europe to
plead for help in ending the war.
Doris Youdelman of Venceremos
told of a plan to confront the
University with its responsibility for
developing types of weapons used in
Vietnam by requesting the Board of
Trustees to make a $25,000 minimum
contribution to the fund for the Bach
Mai Hospital in Hanoi, which was
destroyed in recent bombing.
Kevin O'Grady of the Stanford
Committee on Political Education
(SCOPE), one of the coordinators of
the rally, appealed for contributions to
National Aid for Indochina, an
organization which provides medical
supplies to North Vietnam. After that
speech, ASSU Co-President Brent
Appel opened the microphone to
members of the audience for reports
of action throughout the country, and
specific suggestions for action here.
Venceremos member Jeff
Youdelman was the only speaker able
to take advantage of the opportunity,
however. He told of a plan to ask the
Palo Alto City Council to donate
$50,000 to the Bach Mai fund at its
meeting next Monday night.
Abrupt Halt
The open mike ended suddenly at

1:05 p.m. when Weiss approached
plainclothes deputy Walter Konar,
assigned to the community relations
section of the Santa Clara County
Sheriff's Office.
While Konar was adjusting a camera
he carried at the rally, Weiss shoved a
man aside, ran up, and punched the
deputy in the jaw, staggering and
dazing the deputy.
Sheriff's Lieutenant Bob Lees
immediately grappled with Weiss, held
him in a chokehold, and with another
deputy forced the suspect to lie face
first on a lawn in front of the Old
Union while they handcuffed him.
Crowd Demands Explanation
An angry, milling crowd of about
fifty people quickly surrounded the
five deputies and an equal number of
Stanford Dept. of Public Safety
officers in the area, demanding an
explanation for the arrest, shoving the
officers and suspect, and preventing
them from leaving.
Lees and another deputy eventually
identified themselves, tersely
explained the incident before the
arrest, and, ignoring protests from
many Venceremos members,
professors Hal Kahn and Pierre Noyes,
and others in the crowd, forced their
way out to Santa Teresa St. where a
patrol car met them.
Deputies booked Weiss at North
County Jail in Palo Alto for assault,
battery, and resisting or obstructing a
public officer. At about 4 p.m. the
suspect was released on $565 bail.
Konar was examined at Stanford
Hospital, X-rayed, treated for a
bruised and swollen jaw, and released.

anybody," he said.
Congressional Mood
He cited the "new attitude" in
Congress as the best hope for ending
the bombing raids.
Brown is backing efforts to send
lobbyists to Washington, and to collect
funds for a saturation anti-war
publicity campaign in the capital. He
will leave on Sunday for Europe to
plead for help in ending the war.
Doris Youdelman of Venceremos
told of a plan to confront the
University with its responsibility for
developing types of weapons used in
Vietnam by requesting the Board of
Trustees to make a $25,000 minimum
contribution to the fund for the Bach
Mai Hospital in Hanoi, which was
destroyed in recent bombing.
Kevin O'Grady of the Stanford
Committee on Political Education
(SCOPE), one of the coordinators of
the rally, appealed for contributions to
National Aid for Indochina, an
organization which provides medical
supplies to North Vietnam. After that
speech, ASSU Co-President Brent
Appel opened the microphone to
members of the audience for reports
of action throughout the country, and
specific suggestions for action here.
Venceremos member Jeff
Youdelman was the only speaker able
to take advantage of the opportunity,
however. He told of a plan to ask the
Palo Alto City Council to donate
$50,000 to the Bach Mai fund at its
meeting next Monday night.
Abrupt Halt
The open mike ended suddenly at

1:05 p.m. when Weiss approached
plainclothes deputy Walter Konar,
assigned to the community relations
section of the Santa Clara County
Sheriff's Office.
While Konar was adjusting a camera
he carried at the rally, Weiss shoved a
man aside, ran up, and punched the
deputy in the jaw, staggering and
dazing the deputy.
Sheriff's Lieutenant Bob Lees
immediately grappled with Weiss, held
him in a chokehold, and with another
deputy forced the suspect to lie face
first on a lawn in front of the Old
Union while they handcuffed him.
Crowd Demands Explanation
An angry, milling crowd of about
fifty people quickly surrounded the
five deputies and an equal number of
Stanford Dept. of Public Safety
officers in the area, demanding an
explanation for the arrest, shoving the
officers and suspect, and preventing
them from leaving.
Lees and another deputy eventually
identified themselves, tersely
explained the incident before the
arrest, and, ignoring protests from
many Venceremos members,
professors Hal Kahn and Pierre Noyes,
and others in the crowd, forced their
way out to Santa Teresa St. where a
patrol car met them.
Deputies booked Weiss at North
County Jail in Palo Alto for assault,
battery, and resisting or obstructing a
public officer. At about 4 p.m. the
suspect was released on $565 bail.
Konar was examined at Stanford
Hospital, X-rayed, treated for a
bruised and swollen jaw, and released.

ARREST HALTS RALLY — Santa Clara County Sheriff's officers escort graduate student Steve Weiss to a patrol car
following his arrest for hitting a plainclothesman at yesterday's White Plaza rally.
Speakers appealed for aid to victims
of the renewed bombing of North
Vietnam and denounced United
States' policy in Southeast Asia before
some 500 people at a noon anti-war
rally in White Plaza yesterday.
As the quiet meeting ended, five
Sheriff's deputies arrested Mark Weiss,
a biochemistry graduate student, for
allegedly hitting a plainclothes deputy
in the mouth.
Robert McAfee Brown, interim
dean of the chapel, headlined the list
of speakers. He urged passion
moderated with clear-headedness in
response to what he called "the most
massive and insane bombing raids in
history" and to President Nixon's
"game plans" in Southeast Asia.
Brown criticized such slogans as
"Bomb Stanford, Not Hanoi," as he
warned his listeners against adopting
the very tactics under protest. "Our

objective is to see that nobody bombs
anybody," he said.
