## Attorney Responds To Pierre Noyes And William Miller 
### 
john e. thorne

Dear Pierre and Acting President
Miller:
I have in hand Pierre's letter of
Nov. 14 to myself and a couple of
others, that letter enclosing one
from Pierre from Nov. 3 to you,
President Miller, and yours back
to Pierre of Nov. 7 (Daily, Nov. 7
and Nov. 9). Mine will hardly be a
lengthy and detailed legal analysis,
for apparently the courts are not
interested in the law involved. I
will, however, make a few
comments, not because I could
ever hope to change anyone's
mind, but I suppose simply
because the ego within me is big
enough so that I think I might
have something to add — or at
least 1 will probably feel better
having given some kind of
response.
Let me start by a simple
quotation by way of a very short
story from Kahlil Gibran. It's
entitled "Peace and War" and goes
as follows:
"Three dogs were basking in
the sun and conversing.

"The first dog said
dreamily, 'It is indeed
wondrous to be living in this
day of dogdom. Consider the
ease with which we travel
under the sea, upon the earth
and even in the sky. And
meditate for a moment upon
the inventions brought forth
for the comfort of dogs, even
for our eyes and ears and
noses.'
"And the second dog spoke
and he said, 'We are more
heedful of the arts. We bark at
the moon more rhythmically
than did our fore fathers. And
when we gaze at ourselves in
the water we see that our
features are clearer than the
features of yesterday.'
"Then the third dog spoke
and said, 'But what interests
me most and beguiles my mind
is the tranquil understanding
existing between dogdoms.'
"At that very moment they
looked, and low, the dog
catcher was approaching.

"The three dogs sprang up
and scampered down the
street; and as they ran the third
dog said, 'For God's sake, run
for your lives. Civilization is
after us.' "
This little parable was first
published in 1932, but somehow
it seems to me to have relevance
today.
'Remoteness'
I suppose you are quite
correct, President Miller, that
there is a certain "remoteness" in
your activity when we think of
people dying in Vietnam, and
there is no question but that the
law considers many things "too
remote" to be involved with the
case at hand.
Interestingly enough, the
courts to date have considered the
entire question of the Vietnam
war to be far too remote from the
law to even give it any
consideration, even though we do
have our own Constitution and a
host of international treaties
which deal with the question of a
war's legality. But, say our own
courts, this is not a legal question
— rather it is a political one, and
we will therefore turn our back on
the United States Constitution
and these international treaties —
legal documents all.
This very idea seems to have
captured you, President Miller, as
I noticed in the last paragraph of
your letter you speak of
"... beclouding the real issue of
the political responsibility of our
elected officials for the policies
they have pursued." (emphasis

added) I gather that you too
believe the issue to be only
political, and that the legality of
that war should never be raised or
tested in our courts. I may be
misinterpreting you, and it may
be nothing more than my having
been too close to a number of
discussions of Freud.
Magic Of The Law
But the law is such a wondrous
thing — it can almost perform
magic at times. Consider for a
moment the conspiracy statutes,
especially the one in California
which could make both of you
guilty of a felony, and thus facing
possible state penitentiary
imprisonment, if you conspired to
commit the simple misdemeanor
of trespassing across another's
lawn. Certainly, if the law can do
that, it is magic and thus can find
a very sound legal reason why a
legal question is not a legal
question, but is a political
question. How well Professor
Noyes understands this.
You see, President Miller,
Professor Noyes started out quite
sometime ago to gather together a
group of citizens of this country
so as to legally challenge the war.
The law suit was filed, the
defendants were served, and then
the United States Attorney came
into Court to say, "Stop, Judge,
you have no authority in this case.
It is a political case — the question
of whether or not the war in
Vietnam is legal — and thus you
must dismiss the case and allow
the politicians to proceed with the
decisions."

And, of course, that is what
the courts did. Appeals on these
cases have been frustrating, with
only two members of the
Supreme Court daring to suggest
that perhaps the court should give
some consideration to the
question of whether or not the
issue of the legality of the war in
Vietnam is a legal question. Life is
so filled with Catch 22.
'The Real Tragedy'
I am afraid I view the real
tragedy being that such persons as
you, President Miller, are in
essence the leaders of this
country. It is you and people like
you who are the heads of our
universities, our elected officials,
our industrial leaders, our civic
leaders, our religious leaders, our
leaders, our leaders, our leaders.
To me this is the tragedy because
it is the kind of reasoning that
you go through which allows
others to be responsible for the
crime of war, but never ourselves.
It is your reasoning which will
declare a Nuremberg principle —
and never allow it to be applied to
ourselves.
I am sure that it is quite clear
that my two cents goes with
Pierre Noyes. I will vote on his
kind, and for his principles every
time. By God, they are principles
that respect the dignity and value
of every human being on the
surface of this earth — they are
principles that don't want human
beings to kill other human beings
— they are principles which have
been laid down by the great
humanitarian minds throughout

centuries. Principles like these are
quickly violated and paid no
attention to by those who seek
power and domination over
others. I suppose that is the
problem, principles such as "do
unto others . . ." are so simple to
the vast majority of us yet the
vast majority can't understand
them.

Vietnam is a legal question. Life is
so filled with Catch 22.
'The Real Tragedy'
I am afraid I view the real
tragedy being that such persons as
you, President Miller, are in
essence the leaders of this
country. It is you and people like
you who are the heads of our
universities, our elected officials,
our industrial leaders, our civic
leaders, our religious leaders, our
leaders, our leaders, our leaders.
To me this is the tragedy because
it is the kind of reasoning that
you go through which allows
others to be responsible for the
crime of war, but never ourselves.
It is your reasoning which will
declare a Nuremberg principle —
and never allow it to be applied to
ourselves.
I am sure that it is quite clear
that my two cents goes with
Pierre Noyes. I will vote on his
kind, and for his principles every
time. By God, they are principles
that respect the dignity and value
of every human being on the
surface of this earth — they are
principles that don't want human
beings to kill other human beings
— they are principles which have
been laid down by the great
humanitarian minds throughout

centuries. Principles like these are
quickly violated and paid no
attention to by those who seek
power and domination over
others. I suppose that is the
problem, principles such as "do
unto others . . ." are so simple to
the vast majority of us yet the
vast majority can't understand
them.

Dear Pierre and Acting President
Miller:
I have in hand Pierre's letter of
Nov. 14 to myself and a couple of
others, that letter enclosing one
from Pierre from Nov. 3 to you,
President Miller, and yours back
to Pierre of Nov. 7 (Daily, Nov. 7
and Nov. 9). Mine will hardly be a
lengthy and detailed legal analysis,
for apparently the courts are not
interested in the law involved. I
will, however, make a few
comments, not because I could
ever hope to change anyone's
mind, but I suppose simply
because the ego within me is big
enough so that I think I might
have something to add — or at
least 1 will probably feel better
having given some kind of
response.
Let me start by a simple
quotation by way of a very short
story from Kahlil Gibran. It's
entitled "Peace and War" and goes
as follows:
"Three dogs were basking in
the sun and conversing.

"The first dog said
dreamily, 'It is indeed
wondrous to be living in this
day of dogdom. Consider the
ease with which we travel
under the sea, upon the earth
and even in the sky. And
meditate for a moment upon
the inventions brought forth
for the comfort of dogs, even
for our eyes and ears and
noses.'
"And the second dog spoke
and he said, 'We are more
heedful of the arts. We bark at
the moon more rhythmically
than did our fore fathers. And
when we gaze at ourselves in
the water we see that our
features are clearer than the
features of yesterday.'
"Then the third dog spoke
and said, 'But what interests
me most and beguiles my mind
is the tranquil understanding
existing between dogdoms.'
"At that very moment they
looked, and low, the dog
catcher was approaching.

"The three dogs sprang up
and scampered down the
street; and as they ran the third
dog said, 'For God's sake, run
for your lives. Civilization is
after us.' "
This little parable was first
published in 1932, but somehow
it seems to me to have relevance
today.
'Remoteness'
I suppose you are quite
correct, President Miller, that
there is a certain "remoteness" in
your activity when we think of
people dying in Vietnam, and
there is no question but that the
law considers many things "too
remote" to be involved with the
case at hand.
Interestingly enough, the
courts to date have considered the
entire question of the Vietnam
war to be far too remote from the
law to even give it any
consideration, even though we do
have our own Constitution and a
host of international treaties
which deal with the question of a
war's legality. But, say our own
courts, this is not a legal question
— rather it is a political one, and
we will therefore turn our back on
the United States Constitution
and these international treaties —
legal documents all.
This very idea seems to have
captured you, President Miller, as
I noticed in the last paragraph of
your letter you speak of
"... beclouding the real issue of
the political responsibility of our
elected officials for the policies
they have pursued." (emphasis

added) I gather that you too
believe the issue to be only
political, and that the legality of
that war should never be raised or
tested in our courts. I may be
misinterpreting you, and it may
be nothing more than my having
been too close to a number of
discussions of Freud.
Magic Of The Law
But the law is such a wondrous
thing — it can almost perform
magic at times. Consider for a
moment the conspiracy statutes,
especially the one in California
which could make both of you
guilty of a felony, and thus facing
possible state penitentiary
imprisonment, if you conspired to
commit the simple misdemeanor
of trespassing across another's
lawn. Certainly, if the law can do
that, it is magic and thus can find
a very sound legal reason why a
legal question is not a legal
question, but is a political
question. How well Professor
Noyes understands this.
You see, President Miller,
Professor Noyes started out quite
sometime ago to gather together a
group of citizens of this country
so as to legally challenge the war.
The law suit was filed, the
defendants were served, and then
the United States Attorney came
into Court to say, "Stop, Judge,
you have no authority in this case.
It is a political case — the question
of whether or not the war in
Vietnam is legal — and thus you
must dismiss the case and allow
the politicians to proceed with the
decisions."

And, of course, that is what
the courts did. Appeals on these
cases have been frustrating, with
only two members of the
Supreme Court daring to suggest
that perhaps the court should give
some consideration to the
question of whether or not the
issue of the legality of the war in
Vietnam is a legal question. Life is
so filled with Catch 22.
'The Real Tragedy'
I am afraid I view the real

political, and that the legality of
that war should never be raised or
tested in our courts. I may be
misinterpreting you, and it may
be nothing more than my having
been too close to a number of
discussions of Freud.
Magic Of The Law
But the law is such a wondrous
thing — it can almost perform
magic at times. Consider for a
moment the conspiracy statutes,
especially the one in California
which could make both of you
guilty of a felony, and thus facing
possible state penitentiary
imprisonment, if you conspired to
commit the simple misdemeanor
of trespassing across another's
lawn. Certainly, if the law can do
that, it is magic and thus can find
a very sound legal reason why a
legal question is not a legal
question, but is a political
question. How well Professor
Noyes understands this.
You see, President Miller,
Professor Noyes started out quite
sometime ago to gather together a
group of citizens of this country
so as to legally challenge the war.
The law suit was filed, the
defendants were served, and then
the United States Attorney came
into Court to say, "Stop, Judge,
you have no authority in this case.
It is a political case — the question
of whether or not the war in
Vietnam is legal — and thus you
must dismiss the case and allow
the politicians to proceed with the
decisions."

And, of course, that is what
the courts did. Appeals on these
cases have been frustrating, with
only two members of the
Supreme Court daring to suggest
that perhaps the court should give
some consideration to the
question of whether or not the
issue of the legality of the war in
Vietnam is a legal question. Life is
so filled with Catch 22.
'The Real Tragedy'
I am afraid I view the real
tragedy being that such persons as
you, President Miller, are in
essence the leaders of this
country. It is you and people like
you who are the heads of our
universities, our elected officials,
our industrial leaders, our civic
leaders, our religious leaders, our
leaders, our leaders, our leaders.
To me this is the tragedy because
it is the kind of reasoning that
you go through which allows
others to be responsible for the
crime of war, but never ourselves.
It is your reasoning which will
declare a Nuremberg principle —
and never allow it to be applied to
ourselves.
I am sure that it is quite clear
that my two cents goes with
Pierre Noyes. I will vote on his
kind, and for his principles every
time. By God, they are principles
that respect the dignity and value
of every human being on the
surface of this earth — they are
principles that don't want human
beings to kill other human beings
— they are principles which have
been laid down by the great
humanitarian minds throughout

centuries. Principles like these are
quickly violated and paid no
attention to by those who seek
power and domination over
others. I suppose that is the
problem, principles such as "do
unto others . . ." are so simple to
the vast majority of us yet the
vast majority can't understand
them.

Dear Pierre and Acting President
Miller:
I have in hand Pierre's letter of
Nov. 14 to myself and a couple of
others, that letter enclosing one
from Pierre from Nov. 3 to you,
President Miller, and yours back
to Pierre of Nov. 7 (Daily, Nov. 7
and Nov. 9). Mine will hardly be a
lengthy and detailed legal analysis,
for apparently the courts are not
interested in the law involved. I
will, however, make a few
comments, not because I could
ever hope to change anyone's
mind, but I suppose simply
because the ego within me is big
enough so that I think I might
have something to add — or at
least 1 will probably feel better
having given some kind of
response.
Let me start by a simple
quotation by way of a very short
story from Kahlil Gibran. It's
entitled "Peace and War" and goes
as follows:
"Three dogs were basking in
the sun and conversing.

"The first dog said
dreamily, 'It is indeed
wondrous to be living in this
day of dogdom. Consider the
ease with which we travel
under the sea, upon the earth
and even in the sky. And
meditate for a moment upon
the inventions brought forth
for the comfort of dogs, even
for our eyes and ears and
noses.'
"And the second dog spoke
and he said, 'We are more
heedful of the arts. We bark at
the moon more rhythmically
than did our fore fathers. And
when we gaze at ourselves in
the water we see that our
features are clearer than the
features of yesterday.'
"Then the third dog spoke
and said, 'But what interests
me most and beguiles my mind
is the tranquil understanding
existing between dogdoms.'
"At that very moment they
looked, and low, the dog
catcher was approaching.

"The three dogs sprang up
and scampered down the
street; and as they ran the third
dog said, 'For God's sake, run
for your lives. Civilization is
after us.' "
This little parable was first
published in 1932, but somehow
it seems to me to have relevance
today.
'Remoteness'
I suppose you are quite
correct, President Miller, that
there is a certain "remoteness" in
your activity when we think of
people dying in Vietnam, and
there is no question but that the
law considers many things "too
remote" to be involved with the
case at hand.
Interestingly enough, the
courts to date have considered the
entire question of the Vietnam
war to be far too remote from the
law to even give it any
consideration, even though we do
have our own Constitution and a
host of international treaties
which deal with the question of a
war's legality. But, say our own
courts, this is not a legal question
— rather it is a political one, and
we will therefore turn our back on
the United States Constitution
and these international treaties —
legal documents all.
This very idea seems to have
captured you, President Miller, as
I noticed in the last paragraph of
your letter you speak of
"... beclouding the real issue of
the political responsibility of our
elected officials for the policies
they have pursued." (emphasis

added) I gather that you too
believe the issue to be only
political, and that the legality of
that war should never be raised or
tested in our courts. I may be
misinterpreting you, and it may
be nothing more than my having
