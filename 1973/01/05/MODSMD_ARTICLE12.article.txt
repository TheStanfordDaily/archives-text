## The
						Real Pigs

I am increasingly incensed by
the anti-human, anti-biological,
anti-feminine, anti-sexual,
hysterical women's liberation
people on campus, most
noticeably in the Daily (Nov. 29).
These people have turned their
emotional problems into weapons,
which they use to beat upon and
abuse everyone else. This modern
approach to problem solving,
which is epidemic at Stanford, is
to pretend on the one hand that
the problem doesn't exist, and on
the other, that, by some bizarre
twist, it isn't really a problem at
all, but instead a valued asset and
proof of achievement.
The situation that exists on
this campus is so incredible as to
almost defy description. The
women's lib people are
notoriously graceless and sexless,
and their language is filled with
anti-sexuality and hatred for men.
What has happened here is typical
of modern retroflected man.
Frigidity And Impotence
These people have managed to
throttle and deny their own
normal and healthy sexuality, no
doubt by the usual muscular
constrictions of the pelvis and

small of the back that produce
frigidity and impotence (and loss
of grace in moving). This ruthless
retroflection (turning against
oneself) is then projected onto
men, who now become the
"enemy."
All of a sudden, it is not that
these women are crushing an
important part of their own
personalities, but rather they are
being "oppressed" and
"exploited" by these hateful men.
The real problems — the chronic
dissatisfaction with one's life, the
inability to experience normal
human sexuality, the not knowing
how to be a woman — are either
denied or else become proof that
one is "liberated." This is
advertising language. The word
means exactly the opposite of
what it says. In this context,
"liberated" is synonymous with
"chronically inhibited."
The projector, of course, is
always right. There are many
situations in which women are
treated unfairly because they are
women. Hie problem is that the
projector cannot distinguish
between what he does himself and
what other people do.
Hate, Hysteria And Distortion
What stands out on this
campus is the overwhelming lack
of normal human warmth.
Satisfying human relationships are
difficult to find. Into this void
comes women's liberation, which
is hell-bent on making a very bad
situation that much worse. There
is no creative problem-solving in
this movement, no honesty, no
humanity. There is just a
nightmarish combination of hate,
hysteria and distortion.
This same situation is
duplicated in the twisted world of
radical politics. Here, every thing is
seen (projected) through a
distorted lens. Everyone else (of
course) is a fascist, a pig, a racist,
etc., etc., ad nauseum. The
arrogance here is mind-boggling.
Only the radicals are human
beings, only the radicals know the
truth.
Consider the projection
involved in calling the police
"pigs." If nothing else, police are
clean and neat. It is the radicals,
by and large, who are disheveled,
unkempt, etc. So who are the
pigs?
The language of the radicals is
filled with name calling and cries
for blood. They have large stocks
of guns and dynamite, which they
frequently use. Yet it is "society"
that is "brutal." Again, the
radicals spend their time
denouncing everyone else as a
racist and elitist. Only they (the
elite, of course) are for the
"people." Notice also the
distorted language here. "People"
means "the small group that
agrees with us" and does not
include, of course, the hated
"racists" and "elitists."
Intolerant Radicals
As usual, the projectors are
right. There is racism and police
brutality. The defects in western
culture are monumental, and good
proof of that is that we have
managed to raise a generation of
radicals and women's libbers. But
clearly, the pot calls the kettle
black. The radicals are even more
intolerant, brutal, and vicious —
"fascist" — than the police or
establishment people they are so
glad to dump on.
Where are there people who are
not locked in to hate, hate, and
more hate? Where is there any
honesty or treatment of each
other as human beings? How does
it happen that so many people are
content, even eager to spend their
lives throttling their own
(fe)male-ness in the name of
liberation? How is it that people
lie, distort, project, and
manipulate, and then claim that
they are on the royal road to
salvation?
