# So What Else Is New?

### ELLEN KENESHEA 
"Pete 'N' Tillie" and "Up The
Sandbox" are films that take up
in the middle. Women are the
subject of discussion in these
films, but the discussion has
commenced before the film and
the basic points have been agreed
upon. All that remains is to
elaborate on examples.
The point of departure for the
two films is women's liberation.
They are responses to women's
newly re-articulated malaise in
contemporary America. If women
were not voicing discontent, if
they were not questioning the
structure of American society,
these films would not have been
made.
Changing roles and values is a
social as much as a personal issue,
and any answers to questions
must include both these aspects.
As yet there are few satisfactory
solutions and fewer workable ones
— it's a wide open field.
Yet "Pete 'N' Tillie" and "Up
The Sandbox" deal only with
those ideas that have been so
bandied about of late as to be
already time-worn. They are
neither exploratory nor analytical,
but simply descriptive, and at that
cut-and-dried rather than tentative
or thoughtful.
The bored and boring
housewife is the axiom not the
theory in the films. Because of
this, the films make little effort to
discover why their housewives
might be stymied. The social
implications of the basic
assumption are ignored and
matters are reduced to personal
problems.

Possibly politics ought not to
hold sway in these two
light-headed, sad-hearted
diversions. Yet it seems more
likely that the film-makers,
although they accept the
situations as a device, deny them
as serious problems in reality.
Thus in both films the
woman's unhappiness is
ultimately resolved when she
realizes that it is her attitude and
not her social role that causes the
tension in her life. Smile, and
everything will be fine.
This is the sentimental stuff
with which Hollywood has been
supporting the status quo for
some time now, and though there
is nothing wrong with the
sentiments per se, it is depressing
to see them entrenched in films
that at least give hints of
considering that there might be a
problem whose solution is not a
good stimulant or a good man.

Of course, "Pete 'N' Tillie" is
the newest product from director
Martin Ritt, whose last offering,
"Sounder," might have passed for
animated Norman Rockwell. In
"Pete 'N' Tillie," Ritt tackles an
upper middle class white family
instead of a lower class black one,
but the resulting folk wisdom is
the same.
Pete and Tillie meet, become
lovers, get married and move to
the suburbs to raise their child.
Pete has continuous affairs on the
side, Tille goes shopping and
decides she doesn't like sex. She
finally has a nervous breakdown,
but he rescues her from the rest
home in the end because he loves

her.
Certainly Pete and Tillie have
something together, although they
communicate less as the film
wears on, but they also have some
clear problems that Ritt resolves
by simply brushing them aside.
Walter Matthau and Carol
Burnett play the title roles in the
film, but though they have some
engaging scenes together, they
never seem really close. Matthau is
an amusing sort who lets his rough
exterior hide his true feelings
because, as he tells his wife, "I've
made quite a study of true
feelings. Most of them deserve to
be hidden, let me tell you."
But underneath even those
feelings, we understand, beats a
heart of gold. It comes through
sometimes, but on the whole
Matthau is better at evoking the
first two levels of emotion.
Lack Of Sparkle
Carol Burnett plays Tillie with
such leadenness that one wonders
how she musters the spunk to
reply to Matthau's constant train of
witticisms. She is a talented
comedienne, and seems capable of
more nuance than she gives in
most of "Pete 'N' Tillie." Perhaps
someone forgot to tell her that it's
all right to sparkle in a serious
role.

On the other hand, Barbara
Streisand seems to be doing as well
as she can in "Up The Sandbox."
In this case well is dull. Streisand
can sell a part like nobody's
business, but she has difficulty
getting into a role and acting it.
As Margaret, a New York
housewife with two kids and one
on the way, she just doesn't have
anything to sell.
Margaret spends her days
taking care of the kids and
imagining herself the heroine of
exotic adventures. Sometimes
these are funny, but mostly they
are of meagre sustenance. They all
end badly for the heroine, helping
her realize that what she likes and
what she's best suited for is what
she's doing. Margaret's husband,
played with some vigour by David
Selby, assures her that all of their
children will be wonderful and
that he wants her to be fulfilled
because he loves her.
Thus both "Pete l N' Tillie" and
"Up The Sandbox" end pleasantly
in spite of any conflicts that have
gone before. It is unfortunate that
the endings are also so facile, since
some points in the films, if not
new, are at least well-presented.
Yet neither film is interesting
enough to justify sitting through
it in order to learn, once again,
that love conquers all.

she's doing. Margaret's husband,
played with some vigour by David
Selby, assures her that all of their
children will be wonderful and
that he wants her to be fulfilled
because he loves her.
Thus both "Pete l N' Tillie" and
"Up The Sandbox" end pleasantly
in spite of any conflicts that have
gone before. It is unfortunate that
the endings are also so facile, since
some points in the films, if not
new, are at least well-presented.
Yet neither film is interesting
enough to justify sitting through
it in order to learn, once again,
that love conquers all.
"Pete 'N' Tillie" and "Up The
Sandbox" are films that take up
in the middle. Women are the
subject of discussion in these
films, but the discussion has
commenced before the film and
the basic points have been agreed
upon. All that remains is to
elaborate on examples.
The point of departure for the
two films is women's liberation.
They are responses to women's
newly re-articulated malaise in
contemporary America. If women
were not voicing discontent, if
they were not questioning the
structure of American society,
these films would not have been
made.
Changing roles and values is a
social as much as a personal issue,
and any answers to questions
must include both these aspects.
As yet there are few satisfactory
solutions and fewer workable ones
— it's a wide open field.
Yet "Pete 'N' Tillie" and "Up
The Sandbox" deal only with
those ideas that have been so
bandied about of late as to be
already time-worn. They are
neither exploratory nor analytical,
but simply descriptive, and at that
cut-and-dried rather than tentative
or thoughtful.
The bored and boring
housewife is the axiom not the
theory in the films. Because of
this, the films make little effort to
discover why their housewives
might be stymied. The social
implications of the basic
assumption are ignored and
matters are reduced to personal
problems.

Possibly politics ought not to
hold sway in these two
light-headed, sad-hearted
diversions. Yet it seems more
likely that the film-makers,
although they accept the
situations as a device, deny them
as serious problems in reality.
Thus in both films the
woman's unhappiness is
ultimately resolved when she
realizes that it is her attitude and
not her social role that causes the
tension in her life. Smile, and
everything will be fine.
This is the sentimental stuff
with which Hollywood has been
supporting the status quo for
some time now, and though there
is nothing wrong with the
sentiments per se, it is depressing
to see them entrenched in films
that at least give hints of
considering that there might be a
problem whose solution is not a
good stimulant or a good man.
Same Wisdom
Of course, "Pete 'N' Tillie" is
the newest product from director
Martin Ritt, whose last offering,
"Sounder," might have passed for
animated Norman Rockwell. In
"Pete 'N' Tillie," Ritt tackles an
upper middle class white family
instead of a lower class black one,
but the resulting folk wisdom is
the same.
Pete and Tillie meet, become
lovers, get married and move to
the suburbs to raise their child.
Pete has continuous affairs on the
side, Tille goes shopping and
decides she doesn't like sex. She
finally has a nervous breakdown,
but he rescues her from the rest
home in the end because he loves

her.
Certainly Pete and Tillie have
something together, although they
communicate less as the film
wears on, but they also have some
clear problems that Ritt resolves
by simply brushing them aside.
Walter Matthau and Carol
Burnett play the title roles in the
film, but though they have some
engaging scenes together, they
never seem really close. Matthau is
an amusing sort who lets his rough
exterior hide his true feelings
because, as he tells his wife, "I've
made quite a study of true
feelings. Most of them deserve to
be hidden, let me tell you."
But underneath even those
feelings, we understand, beats a
heart of gold. It comes through
sometimes, but on the whole
Matthau is better at evoking the
first two levels of emotion.
Lack Of Sparkle
Carol Burnett plays Tillie with
such leadenness that one wonders
how she musters the spunk to
reply to Matthau's constant train of
witticisms. She is a talented
comedienne, and seems capable of
more nuance than she gives in
most of "Pete 'N' Tillie." Perhaps
someone forgot to tell her that it's
all right to sparkle in a serious
role.

On the other hand, Barbara
Streisand seems to be doing as well
as she can in "Up The Sandbox."
In this case well is dull. Streisand
can sell a part like nobody's
business, but she has difficulty
getting into a role and acting it.
As Margaret, a New York
housewife with two kids and one
on the way, she just doesn't have
anything to sell.
Margaret spends her days
taking care of the kids and
imagining herself the heroine of
exotic adventures. Sometimes
these are funny, but mostly they
are of meagre sustenance. They all
end badly for the heroine, helping
her realize that what she likes and
what she's best suited for is what
she's doing. Margaret's husband,
played with some vigour by David
Selby, assures her that all of their
children will be wonderful and
that he wants her to be fulfilled

as she can in "Up The Sandbox."
In this case well is dull. Streisand
can sell a part like nobody's
business, but she has difficulty
getting into a role and acting it.
As Margaret, a New York
housewife with two kids and one
on the way, she just doesn't have
anything to sell.
Margaret spends her days
taking care of the kids and
imagining herself the heroine of
exotic adventures. Sometimes
these are funny, but mostly they
are of meagre sustenance. They all
end badly for the heroine, helping
her realize that what she likes and
what she's best suited for is what
she's doing. Margaret's husband,
played with some vigour by David
Selby, assures her that all of their
children will be wonderful and
that he wants her to be fulfilled
because he loves her.
Thus both "Pete l N' Tillie" and
"Up The Sandbox" end pleasantly
in spite of any conflicts that have
gone before. It is unfortunate that
the endings are also so facile, since
some points in the films, if not
new, are at least well-presented.
Yet neither film is interesting
enough to justify sitting through
it in order to learn, once again,
that love conquers all.
"Pete 'N' Tillie" and "Up The
Sandbox" are films that take up
in the middle. Women are the
subject of discussion in these
films, but the discussion has
commenced before the film and
the basic points have been agreed
upon. All that remains is to
elaborate on examples.
The point of departure for the
two films is women's liberation.
They are responses to women's
newly re-articulated malaise in
contemporary America. If women
were not voicing discontent, if
they were not questioning the
structure of American society,
these films would not have been
made.
Changing roles and values is a
social as much as a personal issue,
and any answers to questions
must include both these aspects.
As yet there are few satisfactory
solutions and fewer workable ones
— it's a wide open field.
Yet "Pete 'N' Tillie" and "Up
The Sandbox" deal only with
those ideas that have been so
bandied about of late as to be
already time-worn. They are
neither exploratory nor analytical,
but simply descriptive, and at that
cut-and-dried rather than tentative
or thoughtful.
The bored and boring
housewife is the axiom not the
theory in the films. Because of
this, the films make little effort to
discover why their housewives
might be stymied. The social
implications of the basic
assumption are ignored and
matters are reduced to personal
problems.

Possibly politics ought not to
hold sway in these two
light-headed, sad-hearted
diversions. Yet it seems more
likely that the film-makers,
although they accept the
situations as a device, deny them
as serious problems in reality.
Thus in both films the
woman's unhappiness is
ultimately resolved when she
realizes that it is her attitude and
not her social role that causes the
tension in her life. Smile, and
everything will be fine.
This is the sentimental stuff
with which Hollywood has been
supporting the status quo for
some time now, and though there
is nothing wrong with the
sentiments per se, it is depressing
to see them entrenched in films
that at least give hints of
considering that there might be a
problem whose solution is not a
good stimulant or a good man.
Same Wisdom
Of course, "Pete 'N' Tillie" is
the newest product from director
Martin Ritt, whose last offering,
"Sounder," might have passed for
animated Norman Rockwell. In
"Pete 'N' Tillie," Ritt tackles an
upper middle class white family
instead of a lower class black one,
but the resulting folk wisdom is
the same.
Pete and Tillie meet, become
lovers, get married and move to
the suburbs to raise their child.
Pete has continuous affairs on the
side, Tille goes shopping and
decides she doesn't like sex. She
finally has a nervous breakdown,
but he rescues her from the rest
home in the end because he loves

her.
Certainly Pete and Tillie have
something together, although they
communicate less as the film
wears on, but they also have some
clear problems that Ritt resolves
by simply brushing them aside.
Walter Matthau and Carol
Burnett play the title roles in the
film, but though they have some
engaging scenes together, they
never seem really close. Matthau is
an amusing sort who lets his rough
exterior hide his true feelings
because, as he tells his wife, "I've
made quite a study of true
feelings. Most of them deserve to
be hidden, let me tell you."
But underneath even those
feelings, we understand, beats a
heart of gold. It comes through
sometimes, but on the whole
Matthau is better at evoking the
first two levels of emotion.
Lack Of Sparkle
Carol Burnett plays Tillie with
such leadenness that one wonders
how she musters the spunk to
reply to Matthau's constant train of
witticisms. She is a talented
comedienne, and seems capable of
more nuance than she gives in
most of "Pete 'N' Tillie." Perhaps
someone forgot to tell her that it's
all right to sparkle in a serious
role.
