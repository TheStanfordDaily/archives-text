# '1776':
## More Bathroom Humor Than Politics 
### 
"1776" is a process in trivialization. It attempts to demystify the
men and events surrounding the signing of the Declaration of
Independence by presenting a humanistic and by implication more
accurate version of the founding of a country. After all, as one of the
signers notes, "We're men, not demi-gods," which is undeniably true.
So, instead of stiff Founding Fathers, writer Peter H. Stone gives us
rambunctious school boys out on a lark, more interested in sex and
bathroom humor than politics. It is not an improvement on the story.
And Stone, busy adding the personal details generally missing from
text books in his efforts to get at the men behind the myths, forgets
to de-mythologize the facts themselves. The Declaration was not
signed on July 4 but over an extended period of time. Also, there
were about twenty more men who signed the Declaration than given
in the film, and so on.
Such mistakes could be overlooked if the film were meant to be

taken strictly as a light comedy, or as an absurdist view of the events,
but both Stone and director Peter Hunt are at pains to assure us of the
seriousness of their intent. Columbia Pictures has even put together an
educational guide to accompany the film.
"1776" boils down to a "we're jes' plain folks too" approach to
history, done up in full sentimental regalia.
Room-Bound
The film is based on the hit Broadway musical written by Stone
with music and lyrics by Sherman Edwards. Hunt also directed the
Broadway show, and most of the actors in the film re-create the roles
they played on the stage. All of this may help account for the fact
that the movie plays very much like a film of the play. It is
room-bound, and Hunt's only answer to this is to keep his camera in
continual motion whenever the characters are in Independence Hall,
which they are most of the time.
The actors move about as though they were still on a stage,
over-gesturing and stiffly posing, lacking the less pronounced, easier
movements better suited to the screen. They are not helped by
costumes that off-set each other only too well and are too spotless ever
to have been worn as actual clothes.
The music itself is entirely forgettable, with the possible exception
of "Molasses to Rum," an economic interpretation of slavery sung by
a southern delegate in high melodramatic style. Yet it is, like the other
songs, just out of range of the plot rather than an aid to it as songs in
the best musicals are.
Ridiculous Songs
At their worst, the songs run to the ridiculous, as in Mrs.
Jefferson's delineation of her husbands best attributes; "He plays the
violin, he tucks it under his chin." Her description matches in tone the
portrayal of Richard Henry Lee, southern gentleman and
representative from Virginia. In "1776," Lee acts like a refuge from a
third class vaudeville act.
There are actually hints of drama in the musical. In fact, the
elements of conflict between those for and those opposed to
independence are quite well, if laboriously, set up. Yet all the
interesting problems are resolved off-screen, so that even when
everyone finally signs the Declaration, it isn't clear why they decide
to.
One comes away from "1776" thinking that there really is a good
story there, if only someone could put it all together.
