## Vespers Service Tonight 
### 
A 15th century Vespers service, to be celebrated
at 8 p.m. tonight in St. Ann's Chapel, Palo Alto, will
be the first event of the Stanford Music
Department's winter season. The service will include
polyphonic vocal music and the plainchant ritual of
the Epiphany celebration, using a setting by
composer Guillaume Dufay (1400-1474).
Epiphany, also known as Twelfth Night,
celebrates the visit of the three Magi to the Christ
child. The date of Epiphany is Jan. 6, but first
Vespers customarily occurs on the eve of the
holiday.
Beverly Simmons will direct the 20-member St.
Ann's Chapel Renaissance Choir and an additional
group of six singers, the Stanford Early Music

Ensemble.
Essentially unchanged since Dufay's time, the
service is in Latin. All of the music — five psalms
and five settings for soloists — will be sung without
accompaniment. The psalms are in the style of
"faux bourdon," a 15th-century practice in which
the singers improvised counterpoint against a basic
chant.
The soloists will be Anne Tobey, Jane Sugarman,
Beverly Simmons, Douglas Wyatt,Professor William
Mahrt, and Hermann Evenhoech.
Fathers John Duryea and Robert Giguere of St.
Ann's Chapel and Father Philip Abinante of St.
Patrick's Seminary will officiate at the Vespers
Service.
