# Report Of The Presidential Commission On Overseas Campuses
## 
### 
Following is the text, with minor excisions,
ol the report of the Presidential Commission for
Review of Overseas Campuses.
INTRODUCTION
We arc all familiar with the phenomenon of desue
tude. A well-conceived statute no longer applies because
the social problem it envisioned has disappeared or has
changed into a different problem. A successful institu
tion loses its effectiveness because the social function it
was created to perform is no longer what society wants.
Under such circumstances two possible responses assume
prominence: the institution can be abolished, or it can
be modified to meet the changed need.
Stanford's foreign studies programs face declining stu
dent interest and mounting student disaffection among
those who are interested. They are the object of in
creasing, and increasingly profound, criticism by faculty
on academic grounds.
What has happened? The world has changed, Stanford
has changed, Stanford students have changed. T he for
eign studies programs that were designed for and were
successful in an earlier period at Stanford now seem
unsatisfactory. Since the world cannot be turned back,
we arc faced with limited alternatives: abolition or reno
vation.
Had we chosen to recommend abolition, our work
would have been easier and this report shorter. It soon
became apparent, however, that there was little aboli
tionist sentiment on the Commission. Instead, we
decided early that the basic objective of the foreign
studies programs continued to be valid; accordingly, we
have recommended that Stanford continue to offer
undergraduates (and graduate students) an opportunity
to study abroad as part of their Stanford education.
Our recommendation follows from considerations too
familiar and too cogent to require discussion or amplifi
cation here: the growth of international interdepend
ence; the transnational and transcultural consequences
ol individual, corporate, and governmental actions; the
uses of foreign experience to illuminate our own prob
lems and inform our own judgments; the need to prepare
our students for thoughtful participation in an inter
nationalized world; Stanford's extensive commitment
and investment in international studies; existing faculty
and student interest in foreign study programs; the list
could easily be extended. Abolition is out of the ques
tion.
This leaves us with the remaining alternative: renova
tion. In this connection we make a set of rather far
reaching recommendations. Before turning to them we
wish to point out certain of their characteristics.
The first point is that we have placed a good deal of
emphasis on the academic character and quality of for
eign study programs. We received ample testimony that
what goes on at the foreign campuses often bears little
relation to the site and lacks academic coherence. Stan
ford students and faculty go abroad, to study and to
teach, but to study and teach what? Does it bear any
relation to the site? What academic purposes does it
serve? The answers to these questions were, on the
whole, unsatisfactory (although there were important
exceptions). The consequences of this "academic
vacuum" are hardly surprising: student disinterest or
disaffection; faculty complaisance or distaste; a general
decline in quality; malaise.
Accordingly, our academic emphasis is an expression
ol the judgment that a Stanford foreign study program
requires academic character, coherence, and quality if it
is to be a successful program.
(This does not mean that we ignore the importance of
financial and administrative considerations. It does mean
that, in a University, they are secondary, both in a
procedural and in a substantive sense. Procedurally, one
looks at academic goals first, and then to the others.
Substantively, one favors academic considerations over
the others; in the process of compromise between them
academic considerations arc given greater weight.)
A second aspect of our recommendations is that they
are interrelated; each recommendation derives some of
its meaning and force from the others. For example, the
recommendation that Cliveden be discontinued and that
future British programs normally be located in London
or Oxford cannot be properly understood or evaluated
in isolation from our other proposals. In this connection
we urge that those who read our recommendations
lorcgo judgment on any of them until they read them
all. Equally important, we urge that care be taken to
resist any temptation to adopt the easy recommenda
tions and forget the hard ones. There is some room for
adjustment, some play in the joints, but basically they
are all ol a piece. If Stanford is to have a respectable and
successful foreign study program, it will probably be
necessary to adopt the body of our recommendations.
A third characteristic of our proposals is the emphasis
on flexibility and openness in future program develop
ment. It seems desirable, for a variety of reasons which
are spelled out in the report, to take this approach.
Having done so, we found it both undesirable and im
possible to provide a detailed blueprint for future pro
grams. Instead, we have provided a set of objectives and
standards to guide program development, and we have
indicated our view of the sort of person who should be
selected to take primary responsibility for it. We have
also described the kind of committee structure that
would, in our judgment, be most likely to provide the
new Director with the necessary support and guidance.
It will be clear to any reader that what we say about the
new Director and his or her advisory committee are
essential components of our recommendations, to which
we now turn.
THE ACADEMIC PROGRAM
The success of Stanford's overseas studies programs
requires that it adhere to the highest intellectual and
academic standards and that it be responsive to the
variety and changing nature of student and faculty inte
rests and to the specific advantages offered by each of its
overseas locations. The proposals we make for the de
velopment of the program's academic content and
structure are guided by the following principles:
First, the academic program should be of the highest
academic quality possible, and all decisions made with
regard to it should be guided by this principle.
Second, the academic program should be appropriate
to the host culture and should develop an intellectual
experience of some aspects of that culture. To this end,
it should seek, in any specific location, to develop coher
ent areas of knowledge on the basis of which the student
can view, and participate in, the rest of the host culture.
Ilus means that the academic program should be de
signed in such a way as to involve the student directly in

the host culture, both intellectually and as a living expe
rience.
Third, the academic program should be considered a
means of access to the institutions of its siles as well as a
coherent whole in and of itself. Therefore, local univer
sities, museums, laboratories, libraries, and other cultural
institutions should be considered essential resources in
the planning of any Stanford program.
Fourth, the academic program should be pluralistic,
flexible, and experimental. It should be pluralistic in
that the structure of any specific Stanford program
should take advantage of the particular characteristics of
the host culture, which means that the structure will
vary from country to country. It should be flexible in its
conceptualization, its responsiveness to student interests,
its development of teaching methods, and the loci of
teaching, and in its efforts to find the most effective
combination of courses as between Stanford's personnel
and the personnel of local institutions. It should be
experimental in the development of appropriate curric
ula and its search for solutions to long-standing prob
lems, such as language instruction.
Fifth, academic programs should provide the founda
tions on the basis of which the student will be enabled
to experience directly the rhythms and patterns of the
daily life of the host culture, to experience the institu
tions of the host culture, and to develop the ability to
communicate with the members of the host culture.
A program guided by these principles will, we believe,
contribute to the goals of a liberal education by
broadening the student's cultural horizons and by
providing him with a significant experience of another
culture so that (a) he will have serious knowledge of that
culture, (b) he will have a point from which to reflect
back on his own culture, and (c) he will develop a
transcultural perspective.
The Components of the Program. Students and fac
ulty resident abroad are in the midst of a contemporary
culture that is making, or has made, its special contribu
tions to international society and that has its own
particular past. Each specific program should encompass
both these dimensions, and we therefore recommend
that it be organized around two foci.
Focus I should consist of a series of courses designed
in such a way as to provide a coherent and integrated
approach either to a period of history (e.g., the Renais
sance) or to a subject (e.g., Paris: The City as a Culture)
which is particularly appropriate to the site and to the
availability there of cultural resources. The focus should
be sufficiently specific to provide the opportunity for
in-depth study and, at the same time, broad enough to
provide a perspective on the host culture.
Focus II should consist of a series of courses designed
around the contemporary host culture in its social, poli
tical, economic, intellectual, and artistic aspects. It
should provide the student with a coherent approach to
the contemporary host culture and with the tools neces
sary for interacting with it.
Where possible, students should be encouraged to
satisfy the requirements of either or both of these foci
by taking courses at local institutions, and the program
should take responsibility for making the necessary
arrangements for students who wish to attend such
courses and for evaluating their work in them.
Students may also be encouraged to develop their
own independent research project for credit, and the
program's staff should facilitate both the development
of the project and access to the necessary resources.
The development of this entire approach to the aca
demic program will require cooperative planning on the
pari of Stanford's home and overseas faculty, and the
Director's office should actively facilitate and coordinate
this process. It will also require long-range planning both
in terms of faculty selection and of curricular develop
ment. For instance, programs planned for the academic
year 1976-1977 may well have to enter the planning
stage during the academic year 1973-1974. However, we
believe that this kind of lead-time will contribute signifi
cantly to the maintenance of the high academic quality
of the program.
The academic program is the core of our concern.
The principles we have stated here are fundamental. The
remaining parts of this report, in dealing with a variety
of questions, build on and amplify these principles.
THE FACULTY
The success of Stanford's overseas programs will
depend on the faculty, both home and overseas, who
participate in it. The faculty is crucial to the advance
ment of the program's educational objectives.
A. The Home Faculty. The Stanford home faculty
should fulfill several major functions with respect to the
overseas studies programs. It is a primary agency for the
conceptualizing and planning of the specific programs. It
is one of the sources of advice and information about
personnel, both in the Stanford community and in the
host country, who may contribute to the development
of our programs, and be interested in participating in
them. It is one of the two major sources of instruction.
The following recommendations are intended to serve as
guidelines for the further development of coherent fac
ulty participation in all aspects of the programs.
First, a faculty member's participation in an overseas
program should depend upon the individual's ability to
contribute to the educational and intellectual objectives
of the specific program. The program should actively
recruit faculty participation, either in the form of
staffing a specific program already planned or in the
form of encouragement to individual faculty members or
groups of faculty members to plan to carry out specific
programs.

Space Paid for by University Relations
Second, we recommend that the Director undertake
and periodically renew a thorough survey of personnel
on the Stanford campus in order to determine the range
of academic interests and availability for participation in
the planning and teaching aspects of the programs, and
the forms this participation might take.
Third, In situations in which language is taught at an
overseas program, we recommend that an experiment be
made in which language instructors at the home campus
should he considered potential participants in the over
seas programs while they are replaced at the Stanford
campus by language instructors from the overseas pro
grams. The former will benefit from the opportunity to
teach in situ, while the latter will benefit from the
opportunity to study the problems of Stanford students
in the language programs on the home campus.
B. Overseas Faculty. The overseas faculty is the other
major source of instruction in the overseas studies pro
gram. By the term "overseas faculty" we mean faculty in
permanent residence at the site of specific overseas pro
grams, regardless of nationality or institution of perma
nent affiliation. In order to make optimal use of
personnel resources in the host culture in pursuit of the
academic objectives of the program, we make the fol
lowing recommendations:
First, overseas faculty employment should be defined
in two ways: the continuous employment of individuals
on a full-or part-time basis, and the "purchase" of indivi
dual courses. Both approaches should be used depending
upon the nature of the problem to be resolved. Recogni
tion that both these strategies are available and useful
greatly expands and enriches the overseas faculty re
source pool by including in it the faculty and staffs of
local universities and other cultural institutions. The
pool can be further enlarged and enriched by the
practice, already followed to some extent, of encour
aging overseas faculty to teach in the local language.
Second, insofar as possible the concept of the over
seas faculty should be kept as flexible as the concept of
the home faculty in terms of the latter's participation in
the overseas studies program. In all cases the program
should determine the form of faculty recruitment, rather
thati vice versa. This means that, while some faculty will
be "permanent," in many cases faculty will be recruited
to provide specific courses for specific programs and
periods of time.
Third, overseas faculty should, to the extent possible,
be selected on the same basis as the Stanford home
faculty, both with regard to procedures and with regard
to the criteria of employment. In this way we hope to
encourage-subject to the problems distance creates-the
development of collegiality between the home campus
and the overseas programs and greater integration of the
overseas faculty into the Stanford system. In turn, this
should lead to the greater involvement of the home
departments and faculty in the program. For instance,
home faculty and departments should be invited to aid
in the identification and recruitment of appropriate
overseas personnel, the judgment of qualifications, etc.
Conversely, in the planning of specific programs local
resources should be called upon for aid and advice.
Fourth, in the interests of collegiality, the develop
ment of departmental interest in the program, and the
integration of the overseas faculty into Stanford Univer
sity, overseas faculty, both full-time and part-time,
should be given courtesy appointments in the appropri
ate departments at the appropriate levels. A parallel title
system, each rank being prefixed by the word "Adjunct"
(e.g., Adjunct Professor, Adjunct Associate Professor,
Adjunct Assistant Professor, Adjunct Instructor,
Adjunct Lecturer), should be developed for this purpose,
it being understood that an "Adjunct" appointment
docs not carry with it membership in the Academic
Council or place the holder on the tenure ladder. All
such appointments should be term appointments. Such a
system, which is not uncommon in Europe, will provide
greater recognition both for our overseas faculty and for
Stanford University in the overseas intellectual com
munity; it will provide a means of honoring local aca
demic intellectuals whom we wish to involve in our
programs and will diminish the second class status of our
overseas faculty vis-a-vis the home faculty. Upon
approval of such appointments by the appropriate de
partment, the adjunct-faculty and the courses it gives
should be listed under the appropriate department
heading in the annual Courses and Degrees bulletin.
THE STUDENT
A. In general. We believe, in principle, that most
students can benefit from a period of study abroad.
Indeed, for many majors, study abroad would appear to
be an essential part of a student's progress toward a
degree in a specific major. Consequently, we believe that
an opportunity to study abroad should be made
genuinely available to all students. Furthermore, within
the structure of flexibility that we are recommending, it
should be possible to develop specific programs that will
be of special interest to students in the pre-professional
fields. It follows from all this that:
First, no numerical limitations should be placed on
participation, and the program should be flexible in its
ability to deal with fluctuating demand.
Second, the program should work closely with the
Dean of Undergraduate Studies and with the various
departments and schools toward the end of integrating
the overseas studies program into the various appropriate
majors.
Third, the program should work toward the ultimate
goal of making participating in an overseas studies pro
gram available to every student who wishes to particip-

B. Application ami Selection. Beginning with the
assumption dial the program should be potentially avail
able to any student, we believe the following criteria
should guide application and selection of participants.
First, each student should have a commitment to full
participation in the specific program to which he applies
and to living within the framework of the host culture.
Second, each student, graduate or undergraduate,
should be a Stanford student in good standing (it would
be foolish for a student on academic probation to
participate in an overseas studies program unless his
advisor and the Dean of Undergraduate Studies recom
mended it).
Third, where a specific program has pre-requisites for
participation, the student should be expected to have
fulfilled those pre-requisites. This means that such pre
requisites should be defined and publicized sufficiently
well in advance to allow students to satisfy them.
The specific program and the students' living situa
tion abroad should replicate student life at the program's
site as closely as possible. Intellectually, students should
be encouraged to explore the academic environment of
those in the host culture who are pursuing similar
studies; socially, students should be encouraged to
explore as broadly as possible the environment of the
host culture. This implies the development of a broad
range of social and intellectual contacts between indivi
dual Stanford students or groups of students and their
opposite numbers in the host culture, and the local
administration should actively facilitate these aspects of
student life.
Advising. The recommendations we have made up to
this point in our report all suggest the importance of
extending the general university advising system to
include the overseas studies programs on a more active
basis. Each student's advisor may serve as a bridge
between the student's home campus curriculum and his
program abroad. The Director should undertake to study
the advising problem in this regard and make specific
recommendations toward this end.
THE LANGUAGE PROBLEM
The question of the nature and amount of linguistic
preparation that is, or is to be, required for participation
in the program has been a difficult one for many years,
and no easy solution presents itself. Nevertheless, certain
guiding principles suggest themselves to us as a basis for
further thinking and plannning in this complex area:
First, some knowledge of the language of the host
culture is essential to participation in the host culture
and to the acquisition of anything more than the most
superficial knowledge of that culture.
Second, language pre-requisites for participation in
any given overseas program should be defined in terms
of the needs of that specific program.
Third, language achievement, both at home and over
seas, should be measured in terms of actual tested com
petency rather than merely in terms of units or courses
completed.
Fourth, the overseas studies program and the home
campus language departments should work closely
together in pursuit of their common objectives in this
area.
Several experimental approaches suggest themselves,
among which are:
1. Instruction on the home campus in courses
especially designed for the specific program, with
or without instruction provided at the overseas
site;
2. The initiation of language instruction at the over
seas site, using intensive total immersion methods
during an initial period of the program overseas;
3. A specially designed intensive language course on
the home campus, continued at the overseas site
during an initial period.
Indeed, simultaneous experimentation in all three
approaches, or in others that we have not mentioned,
should yield results that would be of considerable value
to the home language departments in the further devel
opment of their own instructional programs.
THE CALENDAR
The principles which govern our recommendations
concerning the academic program—pluralism, flexibility,
and experimentation-lead us to the conclusion that the
present two-quarter system is insufficiently responsive to
the intellectual and personal needs of students and fac
ulty alike. Accordingly, we recommend that the period
for each specific studies program should correspond to
the regular academic year (the Fall, Winter, and Spring
Quarters of the home campus). There are many reasons
for this, among which are:
First, given a beginning and an end date, the time
between them may be organized in terms of the aca
demic and intellectual purposes of the specific program
rather than the academic calendar of the home campus.
For example, periods of time may be organized in
tensively around specific aspects of a program with
travel breaks between those periods.
Second, the three-quarter period better fits the
rhythm of both student and faculty life at the home
campus, thus making it easier to coordinate both
teaching and studying as between the overseas programs
and the home campus.
Third, it will incorporate the local faculty into the
rhythm of the home campus, allowing them time to plan
their own academic participation in (he Stanford pro
gram and to accomplish their own scholarly work.
The nine-month period should be considered as the
time frame within which programs of varying length may
take place, ranging from one quarter or less to a full
three quarters. This concept of a time-frame implies
that:
First, the nine-month period will make possible
longer-range and more adequate planning and education
than the present two-quarter system. Given the com
prehensiveness of the program we have in view, the
longer period will make it possible for the faculty and
students to pursue their academic objectives in a more
measured and reasoned fashion. It also creates new
opportunities for experimentation with a variety of
programs in areas such as intensive summer programs,
continuing education for alumni, etc.
Second, some specific programs may require less than
three quarters of time for completion due to the limited
nature of their concerns, or some students may wish to
attend one or two-quarter programs, rather than a full
three quarter program, and there should be sufficient
flexibility to respond to such needs. We even envisage
the possibility that at one overseas location two pro
grains of different duration may be conducted simul
taneously.
THE TRAVEL PROBLEM
Planned group travel, if any, should be organized on
the basis of the same principles that inform the overseas
studies as a whole. This implies that field trips should
serve the immediate academic and intellectual objectives
of specific programs. Sites and institutions that are
pertinent to the program should be visited in such a way
that the student body derives maximum benefit from
them.
Ai the same time, we cannot fail to recognize that
one of the problems at the overseas campuses has been
the desire of students to travel broadly both within the
host country and to other parts of Europe. Often this
has conflicted with the academic activities of the cam
puses. Moreover, the three-day weekend is insufficient to
permit students to engage in significant travel and often
results in hasty visits to ill-considered places or in failure
to return on time for classes. The special conditions and
interests of programs located in an area such as Europe
(or, for that matter, elsewhere,) dictate that greater
attention be given to the development of an academic
schedule that diminishes the tension between the desire
to explore the larger environment and the requirements
of the academic program. Planning within the nine
month time frame should permit the setting aside ol
significant periods of time for free travel. For example,
in the course of a nine-month program the fourth or
fifth week might be so designated, and during it aca
demic activities at the program's site would be
suspended. The same might be done seven or ten weeks
later, etc. On this basis, a regular five day academic week
could be instituted and at the same time students could
be encouraged to plan longer journeys that would
contribute meaningfully to their total experience of
Europe. We recommend that experiments be tried along
these lines.
CONDUCT
Our recommendations imply, and experience with
Stanford's overseas campuses confirms, that it is neither
possible nor desirable to establish extra-territoriality in
our foreign study programs. All Stanford participants
students, faculty, staff, and their families—should realize
that they are going abroad to participate in a foreign
culture. This will require changes in their own patterns
of behavior, the careful observance of local law, respect
for local culture and institutions, and sensitive adherence
to local standards of behavior. In this connection we
think it appropriate that a certain amount of authority
to deal with violation of these standards be given to local
directors.
LOCATION
Stanford's foreign study programs have been located
entirely in Western Europe. Even among the special
programs, the only exception to this is Mexico. It is true
that Western Europe is, of all areas of the world, much
the most important to Americans. It is the source of our
culture and institutions; it is the part of the world with
which we have the closest political, social, economic,
and cultural relations. However, one effect of the tradi
tional importance to us of Western Europe is that it is
relatively accessible and familiar. Our libraries are full ot
information and thought of and about Western Europe.
Much of our education, from elementary school through
the university, is Western European in content and in
orientation. The need to go to a place to acquire
authentic familiarity with it is less, in the case of
Western Europe, than it is for other parts of the world
and for other cultures.
These considerations do not argue against a con
tinuing opportunity for Stanford students to study in
Europe. They do raise questions about an exclusive
emphasis 011 Western Europe in our foreign study pro
grams. Other parts of the world are ot major and
increasing importance to Americans. There are substan
tial institutional resources invested in African, Asian,
Latin-American, and Soviet-East European studies, and
International Relations at Stanford. There are distin
guished faculty with scholarly interests in these areas
and fields and interested students, undergraduate as well
as graduate. Accordingly, we recommend the establish
ment of foreign study opportunities that recognize and
support these programs and interests.

Aside from the recommendation in the preceding
paragraph we make no proposal for the establishment,
the continuation, or the abolition of any program in any
nation or culture area. We contemplate that decisions of
this kind will be made on the basis of concrete, specific
proposals developed by and through the new Director
and his advisory committee. Accordingly, the proposals
we do make should be clearly understood. When we
recommend that the Vienna lease not be renewed, we do
not express the judgment that there should be no
Austrian program. (Nor do we suggest that if there is one
it should be moved out of Vienna. On the contrary, if
there is to continue to he an Austrian program it should
almost certainly be located in Vienna.) Whether there
should be any Austrian program and, if so, what sort ol
physical facilities it will require are open questions. We
merely propose that, under present circumstances, it
would be unjustifiably expensive and undesirably restric
tive to renew the lease on the present building. In the
same vein, when we propose that a German program
should be located in Munich or Berlin, rather than at
Beutelsbach, we do not propose that there should
necessarily be a program in Germany. All we mean to
say is this: if there is a program in Germany, Beutelsbach
is not the place. Any such program belongs in a cultural
center, such as Munich or Berlin.
Accordingly, we propose that the choice of location
for a proposed program be made in such a way as to
achieve the academic goals of that program, and not the
reverse. In an earlier part of this report we put consider
able emphasis on the centrality of the academic program
and described the principal characteristics overseas pro
grains should have. Such characteristics can, in our view,
be satisfied only in major cultural centers. (We recognize
that there may be occasional highly specialized programs
such as Professor Spindler's anthropological study of
villagers in the Beutelsbach area, which are explicitly
non-urban. We expect that such programs, which by
their nature are special and limited in scope and
frequency, will continue.) It is in such centers that one
finds cultural resources of the quality and variety that
will make the kind of academic program we have
described possible: universities, libraries, archives,
museums, churches, theatre, music, architecture. It is in
major cultural centers that one also finds the govern
mental and private institutions and officials that play
important parts in the social, economic, and political life
of the people. It is in such centers that one encounters
the number, variety and concentration of people, in
cluding students, that make possible a broad and repre
sentative spectrum of culture contact.
Applying these principles to existing program loca
tions leads us to the following recommendations:
First. The almost exclusive location of programs in
Western Europe should be corrected. This may or may
not mean reduction of the number of programs located
in Western Europe. It docs indicate the development of
programs in other parts of the world, particularly in
those parts and in pursuance of those interests in which
Stanford has substantial faculty and other institutional
resources: Africa, Asia, Latin-America, Soviet Union-
East Europe, and International Relations.
Second. If it is decided to continue to have a British
program, it should be relocated in London, or possibly
Oxford. If there is to be a German program, it should be
located in Munich or Berlin. If there is to be a French
program, it should be located in Paris. If there is to be an
Italian program, it should be located in Florence or
Rome. In the case of Austria, Vienna is the appropriate
location.
FACILITIES
The typical Stanford foreign campus is a complex of
distinguishable, and logically separable, facilities: admin
istrative offices; classrooms and faculty quarters; library;
dormitory; dining hall; recreation facilities; laundry and
other facilities for personal services. A student literally
never has to venture away from such a campus.
A major complaint about the campuses is their
tendency to become enclaves. The more concentrated
the facilities the less the student is exposed to cultural
contact in the ordinary course of his academic and
extra-curricular life abroad. Our students may take
refuge in the enclave because of real or fancied difficul
ties in coping with a foreign world. Yet it is in coping
with these difficulties that genuine culture contact takes
place. The line that separates the enclave from the
foreign culture is psychologically very real; it becomes a

kind of wall that keeps our students in and foreign
people and culture out.
Where the program is in a relatively isolated, non
urban site, as is the case with Beutelsbach, the archetypi
cal overseas campus, or Cliveden, the most isolated of
all, a concentration of facilities seems logical (although it
may be neither necessary nor desirable). But the location
of programs in the urban context of major cultural
centers, as we have recommended, greatly limits the case
for concentration of facilities to this degree. Alternative
arrangements are easier to make: students can live in
local student dormitories or with families or be lodged in
hotels or apartments; they can eat in student restaurants,
commercial restaurants, or do their own cooking; classes
can be held in rooms rented from the local university or
other institution, or students can attend classes offered
by that university or other institution; arrangements can
be made to use local library facilities (given the
inadequacy of libraries at existing campuses this would
be a major step toward quality academic programs);
personal services and recreation are plentifully available
in the city.
We recommend retreating from the campus model in
favor of arrangements that strike a considered balance
between the advantages of concentration of facilities and
the interest in culture contact. That balance will be
made in different ways for different programs in diffe
rent locations, and accordingly 110 single model will
apply to all cases. For example, it may make sense for
Stanford students to live together in one program, to live
with families in another, or to live in student dormitories
in another. In one case they may take all their courses
together, and in another they may take some of their
courses in local institutions. And so on.
The advantages of a more flexible and dispersed
approach to facilities for overseas programs are obvious.
One, already mentioned, is the opportunity to place our
students in closer and more continuous contact with
foreign institutions and foreign people. Another is
greater flexibility and economy than is now the case,
freeing Stanford from the rigidity imposed by the
commitment to massive complexes of concentrated
facilities—i.e., to campuses. This flexibility is essential to
the kind of academic programs described in the first part
of our report.
Our recommendation necessarily implies phasing out
the existing campuses. It is in this context that we
recommend that the Vienna lease, on which a decision
must soon be made, not be renewed. In other words, if
there is to continue to be an Austrian program, it should
be dispersed, rather than concentrated into the present
or any other campus. The exact nature of the appropri
ate arrangement would depend on the nature of the
academic program and on the practical possibilities in
Vienna.
The timing and sequence of change from the existing
campuses to more appropriate dispersed facilities in
major cultural centers depends to some extent on such
practical considerations as the terms of existing leases
and supply contracts and, more importantly, on the
success of relocated programs in dispersed facilities. We
urge, however, that planning for the change begin as
soon as the new Director is appointed and that it
proceed briskly. It is our judgment that such a change is
an important step toward realization of an academically
and culturally successful program.
ADMINISTRATIVE GUIDES
Having proposed experimentation within the pro
gram, we have no desire here to tie it down with a too
closely defined administrative structure. Nevertheless,
some definition of the essential leadership roles is, we
believe, important.
The Director of the foreign study program should
function primarily as an academic leader. He should be a
tenured faculty member, highly respected and involved
in the academic community, and a scholar strongly
committed to international studies at Stanford.
As academic leader of the program, the Director will
report to the Provost and be a member of the Provost's
Senior Staff. In order to coordinate the program with
home campus academic programs, he will also need to
meet regularly with the Deans of Undergraduate and
Graduate Studies, and with the Deans of the Schools of
Engineering and Humanities and Sciences. Additionally,
he should be an ex officio member of the International
Studies Committee.
The task of developing a foreign study program along
the lines recommended in this report will be a

demanding one, requiring imagination, dedication, time,
and energy. In order to make the position of Director
attractive to persons with the necessary combination of
talents and characteristics, we suggest the following:
First, in keeping with other academic leadership
positions, that of Director should be limited in term.
The term should be long enough to permit implementa
tion of new programs and evaluation of experience in
them. It should be short enough to make the return to
full-time academic life a reasonably proximate prospect.
Second, after an initial period, il should be possible
for the Director to serve on a part-time basis, thereby
allowing him or her to continue some teaching or
research activities.
Third, a highly competent administrative staff will
allow the Director to delegate responsibility for adminis
trative concerns, both routine and non-routine, freeing
him or her for program formation and development and
for the exploration of ideas. Such administrative staff
should be headed by an Assistant Director for Adminis-
full-time, non-term position.
Just as we call for a greater concern on the part of the
Director for the academic portion of the program, so do
we for the Committee on Foreign Studies. In the past,
the deliberations of the Committee appear to have been
too much concerned with administrative matters. We
would urge the Committee to concentrate its efforts 011
programmatic and curricular concerns. The membership
should be chosen from among those faculty whose
teaching and research interests lie within the general area
of international studies, and should be small in number
(a total of no more than six or seven). The Director of
International Studies should be an ex officio member of
the Committee.
In his annual report to the Senate for 1971-72,
Professor Ralph M. Hester, Chairman of the Foreign
Studies Committee, recommends that the current sub
committee structure be abandoned. We agree. We suggest
instead that from time to time the Director and the
Committee create program committees whose member
ship will be defined so as to achieve specific academic
and programmatic goals. The tenure of these committees
should be determined by the time required to plan,
implement and evaluate their respective specific pro
grams, and should not be for any stated term (such as
the normal three-year period). One of the failures of the
existing subcommittee scheme, which we hope to
correct with this proposal, is that tenure has been
shorter than the time between decision making and
decision implementation. As a result, those involved in a
decision are not able to evaluate the results according to
the initial expectations that led to the decision.
It would be inappropriate for us to spell out detailed
arrangements for the local administration of foreign
study programs. A variety of models is currently
operating, the differences between them due both to
differences between individuals and between local aca
demic environments. There is no single best configura
tion of titles and duties, nor do we think there should
be. The local administrative support required by a
particular study program will depend upon the nature
and si/.e of the program. For example, a group of fifteen
students doing extensive field work for six months will
have needs quite different from a group of 100 students
following a more typical academic program.
We do recommend, however, that the local adminis
trations, whatever their form, be granted more respon
sibility and authority for the administration of their
programs. Additionally, the Director should seek out
methods of increasing the participation of local aca
demic staff in the planning of academic programs.
Program committees should feel free to maintain direct
correspondence with these individuals in planning and
evaluating the programs.
We discussed at some length in the section entitled
"The Faculty" the topic of academic appointments for
local instructors; we draw attention to that discussion,
and accordingly need not repeat it here.
