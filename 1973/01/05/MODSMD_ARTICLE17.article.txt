# Report Of The Presidential Commission On Overseas Campuses

### 
Following is the text, with minor excisions,
ol the report of the Presidential Commission for
Review of Overseas Campuses.
INTRODUCTION
We arc all familiar with the phenomenon of desue
tude. A well-conceived statute no longer applies because
the social problem it envisioned has disappeared or has
changed into a different problem. A successful institu
tion loses its effectiveness because the social function it
was created to perform is no longer what society wants.
Under such circumstances two possible responses assume
prominence: the institution can be abolished, or it can
be modified to meet the changed need.
Stanford's foreign studies programs face declining stu
dent interest and mounting student disaffection among
those who are interested. They are the object of in
creasing, and increasingly profound, criticism by faculty
on academic grounds.
What has happened? The world has changed, Stanford
has changed, Stanford students have changed. T he for
eign studies programs that were designed for and were
successful in an earlier period at Stanford now seem
unsatisfactory. Since the world cannot be turned back,
we arc faced with limited alternatives: abolition or reno
vation.
Had we chosen to recommend abolition, our work
would have been easier and this report shorter. It soon
became apparent, however, that there was little aboli
tionist sentiment on the Commission. Instead, we
decided early that the basic objective of the foreign
studies programs continued to be valid; accordingly, we
have recommended that Stanford continue to offer
undergraduates (and graduate students) an opportunity
to study abroad as part of their Stanford education.
Our recommendation follows from considerations too
familiar and too cogent to require discussion or amplifi
cation here: the growth of international interdepend
ence; the transnational and transcultural consequences
ol individual, corporate, and governmental actions; the
uses of foreign experience to illuminate our own prob
lems and inform our own judgments; the need to prepare
our students for thoughtful participation in an inter
nationalized world; Stanford's extensive commitment
and investment in international studies; existing faculty
and student interest in foreign study programs; the list
could easily be extended. Abolition is out of the ques
tion.
This leaves us with the remaining alternative: renova
tion. In this connection we make a set of rather far
reaching recommendations. Before turning to them we
wish to point out certain of their characteristics.
The first point is that we have placed a good deal of
emphasis on the academic character and quality of for
eign study programs. We received ample testimony that
what goes on at the foreign campuses often bears little
relation to the site and lacks academic coherence. Stan
ford students and faculty go abroad, to study and to
teach, but to study and teach what? Does it bear any
relation to the site? What academic purposes does it
serve? The answers to these questions were, on the
whole, unsatisfactory (although there were important
exceptions). The consequences of this "academic
vacuum" are hardly surprising: student disinterest or
disaffection; faculty complaisance or distaste; a general
decline in quality; malaise.
Accordingly, our academic emphasis is an expression
ol the judgment that a Stanford foreign study program
requires academic character, coherence, and quality if it
is to be a successful program.
(This does not mean that we ignore the importance of
financial and administrative considerations. It does mean
that, in a University, they are secondary, both in a
procedural and in a substantive sense. Procedurally, one
looks at academic goals first, and then to the others.
Substantively, one favors academic considerations over
the others; in the process of compromise between them
academic considerations arc given greater weight.)
A second aspect of our recommendations is that they
are interrelated; each recommendation derives some of
its meaning and force from the others. For example, the
recommendation that Cliveden be discontinued and that
future British programs normally be located in London
or Oxford cannot be properly understood or evaluated
in isolation from our other proposals. In this connection
we urge that those who read our recommendations
lorcgo judgment on any of them until they read them
all. Equally important, we urge that care be taken to
resist any temptation to adopt the easy recommenda
tions and forget the hard ones. There is some room for
adjustment, some play in the joints, but basically they
are all ol a piece. If Stanford is to have a respectable and
successful foreign study program, it will probably be
necessary to adopt the body of our recommendations.
A third characteristic of our proposals is the emphasis
on flexibility and openness in future program develop
ment. It seems desirable, for a variety of reasons which
are spelled out in the report, to take this approach.
Having done so, we found it both undesirable and im
possible to provide a detailed blueprint for future pro
grams. Instead, we have provided a set of objectives and
standards to guide program development, and we have
indicated our view of the sort of person who should be
selected to take primary responsibility for it. We have
also described the kind of committee structure that
would, in our judgment, be most likely to provide the
new Director with the necessary support and guidance.
It will be clear to any reader that what we say about the
new Director and his or her advisory committee are
essential components of our recommendations, to which
we now turn.
THE ACADEMIC PROGRAM
The success of Stanford's overseas studies programs
requires that it adhere to the highest intellectual and
academic standards and that it be responsive to the
variety and changing nature of student and faculty inte
rests and to the specific advantages offered by each of its
overseas locations. The proposals we make for the de
velopment of the program's academic content and
structure are guided by the following principles:
First, the academic program should be of the highest
academic quality possible, and all decisions made with
regard to it should be guided by this principle.
Second, the academic program should be appropriate
to the host culture and should develop an intellectual
experience of some aspects of that culture. To this end,
it should seek, in any specific location, to develop coher
ent areas of knowledge on the basis of which the student
can view, and participate in, the rest of the host culture.
Ilus means that the academic program should be de
signed in such a way as to involve the student directly in

the host culture, both intellectually and as a living expe
rience.
Third, the academic program should be considered a
means of access to the institutions of its siles as well as a
coherent whole in and of itself. Therefore, local univer
sities, museums, laboratories, libraries, and other cultural
institutions should be considered essential resources in
the planning of any Stanford program.
Fourth, the academic program should be pluralistic,
flexible, and experimental. It should be pluralistic in
that the structure of any specific Stanford program
should take advantage of the particular characteristics of
the host culture, which means that the structure will
vary from country to country. It should be flexible in its
conceptualization, its responsiveness to student interests,
its development of teaching methods, and the loci of
teaching, and in its efforts to find the most effective
combination of courses as between Stanford's personnel
and the personnel of local institutions. It should be
experimental in the development of appropriate curric
ula and its search for solutions to long-standing prob
lems, such as language instruction.
Fifth, academic programs should provide the founda
tions on the basis of which the student will be enabled
to experience directly the rhythms and patterns of the
daily life of the host culture, to experience the institu
tions of the host culture, and to develop the ability to
communicate with the members of the host culture.
A program guided by these principles will, we believe,
contribute to the goals of a liberal education by
broadening the student's cultural horizons and by
providing him with a significant experience of another
culture so that (a) he will have serious knowledge of that
culture, (b) he will have a point from which to reflect
back on his own culture, and (c) he will develop a
transcultural perspective.
The Components of the Program. Students and fac
ulty resident abroad are in the midst of a contemporary
culture that is making, or has made, its special contribu
tions to international society and that has its own
particular past. Each specific program should encompass
both these dimensions, and we therefore recommend
that it be organized around two foci.
Focus I should consist of a series of courses designed
in such a way as to provide a coherent and integrated
approach either to a period of history (e.g., the Renais
sance) or to a subject (e.g., Paris: The City as a Culture)
which is particularly appropriate to the site and to the
availability there of cultural resources. The focus should
be sufficiently specific to provide the opportunity for
in-depth study and, at the same time, broad enough to
provide a perspective on the host culture.
Focus II should consist of a series of courses designed
around the contemporary host culture in its social, poli
tical, economic, intellectual, and artistic aspects. It
should provide the student with a coherent approach to
the contemporary host culture and with the tools neces
sary for interacting with it.
Where possible, students should be encouraged to
satisfy the requirements of either or both of these foci
by taking courses at local institutions, and the program
should take responsibility for making the necessary
arrangements for students who wish to attend such
courses and for evaluating their work in them.
Students may also be encouraged to develop their
own independent research project for credit, and the
program's staff should facilitate both the development
of the project and access to the necessary resources.
The development of this entire approach to the aca
demic program will require cooperative planning on the
pari of Stanford's home and overseas faculty, and the
Director's office should actively facilitate and coordinate
this process. It will also require long-range planning both
in terms of faculty selection and of curricular develop
ment. For instance, programs planned for the academic
year 1976-1977 may well have to enter the planning
stage during the academic year 1973-1974. However, we
believe that this kind of lead-time will contribute signifi
cantly to the maintenance of the high academic quality
of the program.
The academic program is the core of our concern.
The principles we have stated here are fundamental. The
remaining parts of this report, in dealing with a variety
of questions, build on and amplify these principles.
THE FACULTY
The success of Stanford's overseas programs will
depend on the faculty, both home and overseas, who
participate in it. The faculty is crucial to the advance
ment of the program's educational objectives.
A. The Home Faculty. The Stanford home faculty
should fulfill several major functions with respect to the
overseas studies programs. It is a primary agency for the
conceptualizing and planning of the specific programs. It
is one of the sources of advice and information about
personnel, both in the Stanford community and in the
host country, who may contribute to the development
of our programs, and be interested in participating in
them. It is one of the two major sources of instruction.
The following recommendations are intended to serve as
guidelines for the further development of coherent fac
ulty participation in all aspects of the programs.
First, a faculty member's participation in an overseas
program should depend upon the individual's ability to
contribute to the educational and intellectual objectives
of the specific program. The program should actively
recruit faculty participation, either in the form of
staffing a specific program already planned or in the
form of encouragement to individual faculty members or
groups of faculty members to plan to carry out specific
programs.

Space Paid for by University Relations
Second, we recommend that the Director undertake
and periodically renew a thorough survey of personnel
on the Stanford campus in order to determine the range
of academic interests and availability for participation in
the planning and teaching aspects of the programs, and
the forms this participation might take.
Third, In situations in which language is taught at an
overseas program, we recommend that an experiment be
made in which language instructors at the home campus
should he considered potential participants in the over
seas programs while they are replaced at the Stanford
campus by language instructors from the overseas pro
grams. The former will benefit from the opportunity to
teach in situ, while the latter will benefit from the
opportunity to study the problems of Stanford students
in the language programs on the home campus.
B. Overseas Faculty. The overseas faculty is the other
major source of instruction in the overseas studies pro
gram. By the term "overseas faculty" we mean faculty in
permanent residence at the site of specific overseas pro
grams, regardless of nationality or institution of perma
nent affiliation. In order to make optimal use of
personnel resources in the host culture in pursuit of the
academic objectives of the program, we make the fol
lowing recommendations:
First, overseas faculty employment should be defined
in two ways: the continuous employment of individuals
on a full-or part-time basis, and the "purchase" of indivi
dual courses. Both approaches should be used depending
upon the nature of the problem to be resolved. Recogni
tion that both these strategies are available and useful
greatly expands and enriches the overseas faculty re
source pool by including in it the faculty and staffs of
local universities and other cultural institutions. The
pool can be further enlarged and enriched by the
practice, already followed to some extent, of encour
aging overseas faculty to teach in the local language.
Second, insofar as possible the concept of the over
seas faculty should be kept as flexible as the concept of
the home faculty in terms of the latter's participation in
the overseas studies program. In all cases the program
should determine the form of faculty recruitment, rather
thati vice versa. This means that, while some faculty will
be "permanent," in many cases faculty will be recruited
to provide specific courses for specific programs and
periods of time.
Third, overseas faculty should, to the extent possible,
be selected on the same basis as the Stanford home
faculty, both with regard to procedures and with regard
to the criteria of employment. In this way we hope to
encourage-subject to the problems distance creates-the
development of collegiality between the home campus
and the overseas programs and greater integration of the
overseas faculty into the Stanford system. In turn, this
should lead to the greater involvement of the home
departments and faculty in the program. For instance,
home faculty and departments should be invited to aid
in the identification and recruitment of appropriate
overseas personnel, the judgment of qualifications, etc.
Conversely, in the planning of specific programs local
resources should be called upon for aid and advice.
Fourth, in the interests of collegiality, the develop
ment of departmental interest in the program, and the
integration of the overseas faculty into Stanford Univer
sity, overseas faculty, both full-time and part-time,
should be given courtesy appointments in the appropri
ate departments at the appropriate levels. A parallel title
system, each rank being prefixed by the word "Adjunct"
(e.g., Adjunct Professor, Adjunct Associate Professor,
Adjunct Assistant Professor, Adjunct Instructor,
Adjunct Lecturer), should be developed for this purpose,
it being understood that an "Adjunct" appointment
docs not carry with it membership in the Academic
Council or place the holder on the tenure ladder. All
such appointments should be term appointments. Such a
system, which is not uncommon in Europe, will provide
greater recognition both for our overseas faculty and for
Stanford University in the overseas intellectual com
munity; it will provide a means of honoring local aca
demic intellectuals whom we wish to involve in our
programs and will diminish the second class status of our
overseas faculty vis-a-vis the home faculty. Upon
approval of such appointments by the appropriate de
partment, the adjunct-faculty and the courses it gives
should be listed under the appropriate department
heading in the annual Courses and Degrees bulletin.
THE STUDENT
A. In general. We believe, in principle, that most
students can benefit from a period of study abroad.
Indeed, for many majors, study abroad would appear to
be an essential part of a student's progress toward a
degree in a specific major. Consequently, we believe that
an opportunity to study abroad should be made
genuinely available to all students. Furthermore, within
the structure of flexibility that we are recommending, it
should be possible to develop specific programs that will
be of special interest to students in the pre-professional
fields. It follows from all this that:
First, no numerical limitations should be placed on
participation, and the program should be flexible in its
ability to deal with fluctuating demand.
Second, the program should work closely with the
Dean of Undergraduate Studies and with the various
departments and schools toward the end of integrating
the overseas studies program into the various appropriate
majors.
Third, the program should work toward the ultimate
goal of making participating in an overseas studies pro
gram available to every student who wishes to particip-

B. Application ami Selection. Beginning with the
assumption dial the program should be potentially avail
able to any student, we believe the following criteria
should guide application and selection of participants.
First, each student should have a commitment to full
participation in the specific program to which he applies
and to living within the framework of the host culture.
Second, each student, graduate or undergraduate,
should be a Stanford student in good standing (it would
be foolish for a student on academic probation to
participate in an overseas studies program unless his
advisor and the Dean of Undergraduate Studies recom
mended it).
Third, where a specific program has pre-requisites for
participation, the student should be expected to have
fulfilled those pre-requisites. This means that such pre
requisites should be defined and publicized sufficiently
well in advance to allow students to satisfy them.
The specific program and the students' living situa
tion abroad should replicate student life at the program's
site as closely as possible. Intellectually, students should
be encouraged to explore the academic environment of
those in the host culture who are pursuing similar
studies; socially, students should be encouraged to
explore as broadly as possible the environment of the
host culture. This implies the development of a broad
range of social and intellectual contacts between indivi
dual Stanford students or groups of students and their
opposite numbers in the host culture, and the local
administration should actively facilitate these aspects of
student life.
Advising. The recommendations we have made up to
this point in our report all suggest the importance of
extending the general university advising system to
include the overseas studies programs on a more active
basis. Each student's advisor may serve as a bridge
between the student's home campus curriculum and his
program abroad. The Director should undertake to study
the advising problem in this regard and make specific
recommendations toward this end.
THE LANGUAGE PROBLEM
The question of the nature and amount of linguistic
preparation that is, or is to be, required for participation
in the program has been a difficult one for many years,
and no easy solution presents itself. Nevertheless, certain
guiding principles suggest themselves to us as a basis for
further thinking and plannning in this complex area:
First, some knowledge of the language of the host
culture is essential to participation in the host culture
and to the acquisition of anything more than the most
superficial knowledge of that culture.
Second, language pre-requisites for participation in
any given overseas program should be defined in terms
of the needs of that specific program.
Third, language achievement, both at home and over
seas, should be measured in terms of actual tested com
petency rather than merely in terms of units or courses
completed.
Fourth, the overseas studies program and the home
campus language departments should work closely
together in pursuit of their common objectives in this
area.
Several experimental approaches suggest themselves,
among which are:
1. Instruction on the home campus in courses
especially designed for the specific program, with
or without instruction provided at the overseas
site;
2. The initiation of language instruction at the over
seas site, using intensive total immersion methods
during an initial period of the program overseas;
3. A specially designed intensive language course on
the home campus, continued at the overseas site
during an initial period.
Indeed, simultaneous experimentation in all three
approaches, or in others that we have not mentioned,
should yield results that would be of considerable value
to the home language departments in the further devel
opment of their own instructional programs.
THE CALENDAR
The principles which govern our recommendations
concerning the academic program—pluralism, flexibility,
and experimentation-lead us to the conclusion that the
present two-quarter system is insufficiently responsive to
the intellectual and personal needs of students and fac
ulty alike. Accordingly, we recommend that the period
for each specific studies program should correspond to
the regular academic year (the Fall, Winter, and Spring
Quarters of the home campus). There are many reasons
for this, among which are:
First, given a beginning and an end date, the time
between them may be organized in terms of the aca
demic and intellectual purposes of the specific program
rather than the academic calendar of the home campus.
For example, periods of time may be organized in
tensively around specific aspects of a program with
travel breaks between those periods.
Second, the three-quarter period better fits the
rhythm of both student and faculty life at the home
campus, thus making it easier to coordinate both
teaching and studying as between the overseas programs
and the home campus.
Third, it will incorporate the local faculty into the
rhythm of the home campus, allowing them time to plan
their own academic participation in (he Stanford pro
gram and to accomplish their own scholarly work.
The nine-month period should be considered as the
time frame within which programs of varying length may
take place, ranging from one quarter or less to a full
three quarters. This concept of a time-frame implies
that:
First, the nine-month period will make possible
longer-range and more adequate planning and education
than the present two-quarter system. Given the com
prehensiveness of the program we have in view, the
longer period will make it possible for the faculty and
students to pursue their academic objectives in a more
measured and reasoned fashion. It also creates new
opportunities for experimentation with a variety of
programs in areas such as intensive summer programs,
continuing education for alumni, etc.
Second, some specific programs may require less than
three quarters of time for completion due to the limited
nature of their concerns, or some students may wish to
attend one or two-quarter programs, rather than a full
three quarter program, and there should be sufficient
flexibility to respond to such needs. We even envisage
the possibility that at one overseas location two pro
