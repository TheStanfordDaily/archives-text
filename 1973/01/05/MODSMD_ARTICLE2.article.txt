# Frenchman's Terrace Endangered Due To Possible Funding Cutoff
## 
### ROBERT BACON 
The Frenchman's Terrace
low/moderate-income housing project,
delayed last month while traffic
engineering studies are made, may be
endangered by a federal funding
cutoff.
Palo Alto Planning Department
staff members have received reports
that President Nixon is contemplating
a moratorium on grants of federal
funds for subsidized housing
construction. The Department of
Housing and Urban Development has
not announced such a moratorium,
but Assistant Planning Director
Michael Grigoni said yesterday"the
smoke signals are very strong and
everybody's quite worried," although
he admitted that "nobody knows for
sure."
The Stanford-Midpeninsula Urban
Coalition proposes to build the
225-unit project on 20 acres of land
leased from Stanford at the corner of
Peter Coutts and Page Mill Roads,
between the faculty housing area and
the Stanford Industrial Park. Twenty
percent of the units would be for
low-income persons, and 40 percent
for those of moderate income.
Unconfirmed reports say that
Nixon plans to cut off categorical
urban assistance programs in order to
pressure Congress into passing a
block-grant community development
scheme which provides no money for
housing. The block grant plan was
defeated last year.
Take It Seriously
Alan Maremont, the Urban
Coalition's Housing Consultant, said
yesterday that the reports "come from
people at the national level; they take
it very seriously. We have to assume
it's in the mill, although we don't
know for certain."
"We're doing our best to put on all
possible pressure to present the fund
moratorium," Maremont added.
Palo Alto officials are also
preparing strong protests to the
administration, urging that it not
block the funding. A moratorium
would affect several other projects in
Palo Alto, in addition to Frenchman's
Terrace.
Six-Week Delay
On Dec. 18, the Citv Council

postponed the question of annexing
the Frenchman's Terrace site for the
third time. The delay was for six
weeks.
A week earlier, Stanford refused
the Council's request to offer for
annexation to Palo Alto about one
acre of greenbelt land at the
intersection of Stanford Avenue and
Bowdoin Streets, about a quarter mile
from Frenchman's Terrace. Palo Alto
sought the annexation so that that
intersection could be redesigned to
direct more traffic onto the campus.
Some residents of the College
Terrace subdivision, between the
Frenchman's Terrace site and the
campus, fear that the new project will
increase what they claim are already
excessive volumes of traffic in their
residential neighborhood.
Annexation Must Wait
They, and some members of the
Council, insist that annexation of
Frenchman's Terrace — a prerequisite
to construction of the housing project
— must wait until some method is
devised to relieve their traffic
congestion.
University officials claimed that

there is no serious problem, and urged
that annexation of Frenchman's
Terrace be considered without waiting
for a resolution of the traffic question.
The Council ordered a joint Palo
Alto-Stanford traffic engineering
survey during the six-week
postponement. Engineers from the
city and the University will present
alternative means of alleviating the
College Terrace situation, means that
will not require surrendering Stanford
greenbelt land for roadway.
Alan Maremont, Housing
Consultant to the Urban Coalition,
told the Council Dec. 18 that the
six-week delay in consideration of the
annexation would mean more than six
weeks delay in processing the
Coalition's application for federal
construction funds, assuming a fund
moratorium is not imposed.
Public Hearing
After a public hearing, the
University Committee on Land and
Building Development and its
Subcommittee on Faculty-Staff
Housing Dec. 11 recommended against
Stanford's offering for annexation the
greenbelt land at the

Stanford-Bowdoin intersection. Both
the City Council and Planning
Commission had urged that Stanford
make the land available for
annexation, and hence for the
redesigned intersection.
