# Frenchman's Terrace Endangered Due To Possible Funding Cutoff
## 
### ROBERT BACON 
The Frenchman's Terrace
low/moderate-income housing project,
delayed last month while traffic
engineering studies are made, may be
endangered by a federal funding
cutoff.
Palo Alto Planning Department
staff members have received reports
that President Nixon is contemplating
a moratorium on grants of federal
funds for subsidized housing
construction. The Department of
Housing and Urban Development has
not announced such a moratorium,
but Assistant Planning Director
Michael Grigoni said yesterday"the
smoke signals are very strong and
everybody's quite worried," although
he admitted that "nobody knows for
sure."
The Stanford-Midpeninsula Urban
Coalition proposes to build the
225-unit project on 20 acres of land
leased from Stanford at the corner of
Peter Coutts and Page Mill Roads,
between the faculty housing area and
the Stanford Industrial Park. Twenty
percent of the units would be for
low-income persons, and 40 percent
for those of moderate income.
Unconfirmed reports say that
Nixon plans to cut off categorical
urban assistance programs in order to
pressure Congress into passing a
block-grant community development
scheme which provides no money for
housing. The block grant plan was
defeated last year.
Take It Seriously
Alan Maremont, the Urban
Coalition's Housing Consultant, said
yesterday that the reports "come from
people at the national level; they take
it very seriously. We have to assume
it's in the mill, although we don't
know for certain."
"We're doing our best to put on all
possible pressure to present the fund
moratorium," Maremont added.
Palo Alto officials are also
preparing strong protests to the
administration, urging that it not
block the funding. A moratorium
would affect several other projects in
Palo Alto, in addition to Frenchman's
Terrace.
Six-Week Delay
On Dec. 18, the Citv Council

postponed the question of annexing
the Frenchman's Terrace site for the
third time. The delay was for six
weeks.
A week earlier, Stanford refused
the Council's request to offer for
annexation to Palo Alto about one
acre of greenbelt land at the
intersection of Stanford Avenue and
Bowdoin Streets, about a quarter mile
from Frenchman's Terrace. Palo Alto
sought the annexation so that that
intersection could be redesigned to
direct more traffic onto the campus.
Some residents of the College
Terrace subdivision, between the
Frenchman's Terrace site and the
campus, fear that the new project will
increase what they claim are already
excessive volumes of traffic in their
residential neighborhood.
Annexation Must Wait
They, and some members of the
Council, insist that annexation of
Frenchman's Terrace — a prerequisite
to construction of the housing project
— must wait until some method is
devised to relieve their traffic
congestion.
University officials claimed that

there is no serious problem, and urged
that annexation of Frenchman's
Terrace be considered without waiting
for a resolution of the traffic question.
The Council ordered a joint Palo
Alto-Stanford traffic engineering
survey during the six-week
postponement. Engineers from the
city and the University will present
alternative means of alleviating the
College Terrace situation, means that
will not require surrendering Stanford
greenbelt land for roadway.
Alan Maremont, Housing
Consultant to the Urban Coalition,
told the Council Dec. 18 that the
six-week delay in consideration of the
annexation would mean more than six
weeks delay in processing the
Coalition's application for federal
construction funds, assuming a fund
moratorium is not imposed.
Public Hearing
After a public hearing, the
University Committee on Land and
Building Development and its
Subcommittee on Faculty-Staff
Housing Dec. 11 recommended against
Stanford's offering for annexation the
greenbelt land at the

Stanford-Bowdoin intersection. Both
the City Council and Planning
Commission had urged that Stanford
make the land available for
annexation, and hence for the
redesigned intersection.
Nine persons testified at the
hearing, including most residents near
the corner. They ranged from strongly
opposed to lukewarm toward the
redesign proposal, developed by the
Palo Alto city staff. Even those who
admitted the existence of a problem,
and not all did, suggested that less
drastic means could solve it.
Oscar Nelson of the University
Planning Office presented the
committees with the results of traffic
counts undertaken jointly by his office
and the city, which indicated that
traffic in College Terrace and on
Stanford Avenue had been reduced
since the opening of Peter Coutts
Road and Bowdoin Street by the
University several years ago. "No
drastic action is called for at this
time," he said.
According to Lyle Nelson,
chairman of the Land and Building
Committee, these figures were
important in indicating to the
committees that there was no problem
requiring action by Stanford at this
time.
Far From Optimal
Electrical Engineering Prof. William
R. Rambo, a nearby resident and a
former member of the Land and

Building Committee, called the
intersection plan "far from
optimal ... It doesn't solve anything."
More than one witness noted that
the intersection would be difficult for
children to cross in walking from the
faculty housing area to Escondido
Elementary School.
John Philo of the Palo Alto Tenants
Union and the Central Palo Alto
Residents Association said there was
"strong feeling" among College
Terrace residents that Stanford was
indifferent to their needs. He urged
approval of the annexation, but
admitted he was not tied to the
proposed design.
City Staff
The plan was first developed by the
City staff in 1966. Interest was
renewed last fall when the City
Council began considering the
Frenchman's Terrace housing project.
Philo admitted that some College
Terrace residents were using the
Frenchman's Terrace proposal as a
"lever" to obtain changes in the traffic
pattern in their area.
Robert Langle, business manager of
the Computation Center, whose house
adjoins the intersection, said "We
chose our lot because of the
greenbelt" and urged that the open

space not be reduced to make way for
the larger intersection.
Not Viable
Committee member Jewelle Taylor
Gibbs, wife of Dean of Undergraduate
Studies James Gibbs, said the plan was
"not viable ... It solves no problem
and it creates new problems." She said
she felt no change in the intersection
was needed.
The land sought for annexation
abuts the rear of faculty houses on the
cul-de-sac of Esplanada Way. It is
across Stanford Avenue from the
University Lutheran Church.
The Palo Alto proposal, which now
appears dead, would have curved
Bowdoin Street from the campus into
the uphill portion of Stanford Avenue.
Traffic for the College Terrace —
residential — portion of Bowdoin
would have been required to stop,
while traffic going onto the campus
portion of Bowdoin would not stop.
Debate on Frenchman's Terrace in
the City Council began in October,
and has continued at a number of
often-stormy sessions since. In
November, the Council approved
prezoning of the Frenchman's Terrace
tract. Both prezoning and annexation
are required before construction can
begin.
