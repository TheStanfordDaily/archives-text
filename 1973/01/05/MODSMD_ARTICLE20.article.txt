# '110th Street' Lacks Subtlety
## 
### 
"We're not animals," one of the hoods
remarks in "Across 110 th Street." But his
actions belie his words. This is a brutal film
composed for the most part of characters who
are odd compendiums of sadism and
sentimentality. Either they're hugging a child
or gouging somebody's eyes out, but there's
no range of emotions between these poles.
The film is about a robbery and a lot of
murders in Harlem and includes organized and
free-lance criminals and some rather
disorganized police. Three blacks rob the
mafia and its black adjunct in Harlem, killing
three syndicate members and two policemen
in the process. This happens in the first five
minutes of the film. The rest is a long
denouement as mafia enforcer Nick D'Salvio
(Anthony Franciosa), the black syndicate and
the police led by aging Captain Matelli
(Anthony Quinn) and upcoming Lieutenant
Pope (Yaphet Kotto) all take off after the
three thieves.
"We're either gonna be rich — or dead,"
says one of the three. They don't end up rich,
to put it mildly. Indeed, although there are a
number of potentially interesting character
conflicts set up, it becomes apparent about
half-way through the film that none of these

will be resolved with any psychological nicety.
Immediately after this realization the first —
or rather sixth — of the mutilated bodies
starts rolling in.
Quinn helped produce the film, as did
Barry Shear, who also directed. Shear doesn't
manage to pull the episodic story together,
and a lot of the time it drags. He excels in
depicting violence, though. The scene in
which Franciosa beats the hell out of Antonio
Fargas, one of the three thieves, is a masterful
bit of sadistic brutality.
"Across 110 th Street" captures the
seediness of New York better than "The
French Connection," but without any of the
attendant humor or style of the latter.
Everything in "Across 110 th Street" is filthy,
and almost everyone is corrupt. Nor is there
any compensating feeling of brotherhood, as
in "The Godfather," to somehow redeem the
violence.
It is possible that Quinn and Shear really
wanted to make a gangster film in which
nobody gets glorified or romanticized — an
"honest" film that pulls no punches. But it
doesn't seem likely. Somehow their relentless
pursuit of violence seems more cynically
designed.

The scenes with Fargas, among others,
seem finally to be designed to exploit one's
taste for violence rather than to undermine it.
Franciosa seems to revel in his part as the
sadistic D'Salvio. He's interesting in his first
scenes, but he becomes tiresome early on.
Like the other actors in the film, he gradually
loses the nuances in his role through a process
of directional elimination. Shear pares away at
"110 th Street" until there is nothing left but
pursuers and pursued, and even these roles are
interchangeable,
Quinn overplays his part, but then, the
whole film suffers from the same malady. It
seems that everybody wants to be the heavy,
and except for Yaphet Kotto who plays the
honest cop, everyone is.
There isn't much hope for Kotto either,
since one of the basic tenets of "Across 110 th
Street" is that people are inevitably pushed
into violence by the society around them, at
least if they live in New York. And for every
one person that makes it to the tenuous top
and the pot of gold, there are dozens of
bodies scattered in the streets. Not a very
pleasant view, but then, "Across 110 th
Street" is not a very pleasant film. — K.K.
