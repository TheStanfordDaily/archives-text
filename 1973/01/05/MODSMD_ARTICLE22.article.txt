# Invade Unfriendly Washington
## Cagers Begin Conference Play 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
For the first time in six years,
Stanford will enter Pacific Eight
play with a winning record when
the Cards travel north this
weekend for games against
Washington and Washington State.
Stanford will match its 5-4
record against Washington State
Saturday night in Pullman and
face Washington Monday night in
Seattle. The Cougars are currently
3-7 while the Huskies sport an 8-3
mark.
Saturday's game will feature
two young teams trying to battle
back from a succession of losing
seasons. First year WSU coach

George Raveling, the first black
head coach in Pac-8 history, is
rebuilding his team around 6-9
center Mike Dolven.
Dolven got off to a relatively
slow start this year but he
rounded into form last week at
the Far West Classic, connecting
on 23 out of 31 field goal
attempts during the Cougars'
victories over Columbia and
Baylor.
Battle Of Big Men
Dolven will match his skills
against seven-foot Stanford center
Rich Kelley. Kelley, one of three
sophomores in Stanford's starting
lineup, is leading the Cards with

averages of 15.8 points and 13.8
rebounds a game. Junior forwards
Mike Mann and Dave Frost are
also scoring in double figures,
averaging 12.4 and 11.1
respectively.
Washington State has scored
less than 60 points a game as
Dolven and Morris Griffin are the
only Cougars in double figures.
Freshman guard Brad Greenberg
hasn't been starting, but his
outside shooting has sparked WSU
on several occasions.
Washington's Huskies have
raced to an impressive 8-3 start
despite the graduation of
all-league center Steve Hawes and

standout guard Charles Dudley.
The 1973 Huskies are led by 6-1
guard Louie Nelson, who is
averaging better than 24 points a
game.
Forwards Ray Price and Reggie
Ball are also solid performers.
Both are averaging 14 points a
game and have been Washington's
most effective rebounders.
Road Frustrations
Stanford is undefeated at
Maples Pavilion but the Cards will
be trying to improve on a dismal
1-4 road record this weekend. "In
three of our four losses to date,
the issue has been decided in the
last 30 seconds," said Card coach
Howie Dallmar. "It has been a
question of missed free throws,
poor shot selection or, in the case
of the Colorado State game, a 4
point play when we were three
points ahead."
Dallmar was referring to last
second losses to Denver, Colorado
State, and Virginia Tech. The
Cards' other defeat came in their
opener at USF. Stanford has
defeated Arizona, San Jose State,
Fordham, St. Mary's, and Navy.
The Cards have averaged 72.6
points a game while holding their
opponents to 68.4. Stanford has
outrebounded its opponents
469-388 but the Cards' poor 58.6
free throw percentage has been a
crucial factor in Stanford's close
losses.
Dallmar will start Kelley,
Mann, Frost, Mark Gilberg, and
Mel Arterberry Saturday night,
but Bob Buell, Steve Shupe, Scott
Trobbe and freshman Tim
Patterson should also see
considerable action. Buell is the
only senior among those nine
players and Dallmar is confident
that Stanford's fortunes will
improve as the team matures. "As
this team gets older we should be
able to turn some of those last
second decisions our way," he
said.

center Mike Dolven.
Dolven got off to a relatively
slow start this year but he
rounded into form last week at
the Far West Classic, connecting
on 23 out of 31 field goal
attempts during the Cougars'
victories over Columbia and
Baylor.
Battle Of Big Men
Dolven will match his skills
against seven-foot Stanford center
Rich Kelley. Kelley, one of three
sophomores in Stanford's starting
lineup, is leading the Cards with

averages of 15.8 points and 13.8
rebounds a game. Junior forwards
Mike Mann and Dave Frost are
also scoring in double figures,
averaging 12.4 and 11.1
respectively.
Washington State has scored
less than 60 points a game as
Dolven and Morris Griffin are the
only Cougars in double figures.
Freshman guard Brad Greenberg
hasn't been starting, but his
outside shooting has sparked WSU
on several occasions.
Washington's Huskies have
raced to an impressive 8-3 start
despite the graduation of
all-league center Steve Hawes and

standout guard Charles Dudley.
The 1973 Huskies are led by 6-1
guard Louie Nelson, who is
averaging better than 24 points a
game.
Forwards Ray Price and Reggie
Ball are also solid performers.
Both are averaging 14 points a
game and have been Washington's
most effective rebounders.
Road Frustrations
Stanford is undefeated at
Maples Pavilion but the Cards will
be trying to improve on a dismal
1-4 road record this weekend. "In
three of our four losses to date,
the issue has been decided in the
last 30 seconds," said Card coach
Howie Dallmar. "It has been a
question of missed free throws,
poor shot selection or, in the case
of the Colorado State game, a 4
point play when we were three
points ahead."
Dallmar was referring to last
second losses to Denver, Colorado
State, and Virginia Tech. The
Cards' other defeat came in their
opener at USF. Stanford has
defeated Arizona, San Jose State,
Fordham, St. Mary's, and Navy.
The Cards have averaged 72.6
points a game while holding their
opponents to 68.4. Stanford has
outrebounded its opponents
469-388 but the Cards' poor 58.6
free throw percentage has been a
crucial factor in Stanford's close
losses.
Dallmar will start Kelley,
Mann, Frost, Mark Gilberg, and
Mel Arterberry Saturday night,
but Bob Buell, Steve Shupe, Scott
Trobbe and freshman Tim
Patterson should also see
considerable action. Buell is the
only senior among those nine
players and Dallmar is confident
that Stanford's fortunes will
improve as the team matures. "As
this team gets older we should be
able to turn some of those last
second decisions our way," he
said.

IS THIS ANY WAY TO SPEND NEW YEAR'S EVE? - Pompom girl Irene Balcar and the Stanford Band
all seem to think so. The Band received a permit to march through downtown Reno on the festive
occasion, and several thousand glassy eyed gamblers stopped their gaming long enough to applaud the
Band's performance.
For the first time in six years,
Stanford will enter Pacific Eight
play with a winning record when
the Cards travel north this
weekend for games against
Washington and Washington State.
Stanford will match its 5-4
record against Washington State
Saturday night in Pullman and
face Washington Monday night in
Seattle. The Cougars are currently
3-7 while the Huskies sport an 8-3
mark.
Saturday's game will feature
two young teams trying to battle
back from a succession of losing
seasons. First year WSU coach

George Raveling, the first black
head coach in Pac-8 history, is
rebuilding his team around 6-9
center Mike Dolven.
Dolven got off to a relatively
slow start this year but he
rounded into form last week at
