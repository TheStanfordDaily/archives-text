# Twelve Returning Lettermen Improve Wrestling Outlook
## 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
With no less than 12 returning
lettermen and several talented
freshmen competing for
first-string positions in 10 weight
divisions, the outlook for
Stanford's wrestling team is
brighter this year than it has been
for the past several seasons.
In Joe Demeo's first two years
of handling the team, "we had all
freshmen and sophomores going
against seniors from other schools,
and so we didn't have much of a
chance."
However, in this, his third year
of coaching here, Demeo expects
the Cardinal grapplers to perform
well against good competition,
and to feature several contenders
for Pacific-8 conference
championships.
The following is a list of the
top wrestlers at each weight limit.
Although there is only one
entrant per meet per position,
others also get a chance during
weeks with two or more meets.
Olympic Trials Winner
118 lbs. — Freshman Jim
Tatarakis is wrestling well and is
vying with sophomore Allen
Axworthy, who won the district
Olympic trials last year, for this
spot.
126 — The Cardinals have two
good wrestlers here with former
co-captain David Kopolow, who
Demeo considers a Pac-8
championship contender this year
as a junior, and also Bobby
Swetman, a blind sophomore who

had a good record as a freshman.
134 — Danny Mueller, a junior,
and Mark Lotheridge, a freshman,
will compete at this position.
142 — Co-captain Ken Krebs,
who reached the semifinals of the
Pac-8 championships last year,
returns as a very promising junior.
'The Best'
150 — Chris Horpel, who
Demeo called "definitely our best
wrestler last year," returns as
co-captain and a nationally ranked
junior.
158 — Jerry Ross, a former
captain and a senior, and Emmett
Stanton, a sophomore letterman,
vie for this slot.
167 — Freshmen Don Penrose
and John Ehman are both
considered to have promise at this
weight.
177 — Senior Mark Davis, a
former runner-up in the New
England championships before
transferring here from the Coast
Guard Academy, is top man at
this level, while John Goves, a
freshman who was outstanding in
high school, will also see action.
190 — Two sophomores,
letterman Mark Feinstein and also
Mark Frelier, will hold this
weight.
Heavyweight — Stanford has
three "big guys" vying for this
position. They are two-time
letterman Mike Achenback, a
junior, sophomore Chris
Westersunt, and freshman Art
Estrada.

The dual meet season begins
today at 4 p.m. in Encina Gym
against U.S.I.U. in an unusual
meet which will allow the
Stanford wrestler his choice of
wrestling in the collegiate, free
style, or Greco-Roman style.
Tomorrow the team travels to the
Cal State Tournament at
Hay ward.
In all, 15 matches are set for
between now and February 23-24,
when the Pac-8 championships are
held at Oregon State.
Demeo expects Oregon and
Washington, which always field
strong teams, to be contenders for
the team championship. However,
he also believes that Horpel,
Krebs, Davis, and Kopolow, and
possibly several other Stanford
athletes will place well.
Although the team is made up
almost exclusively of non-athletic
scholarship students who wrestle
only for "fun," it appears that the
Cardinals may finally be able to
compete successfully this year.

today at 4 p.m. in Encina Gym
against U.S.I.U. in an unusual
meet which will allow the
Stanford wrestler his choice of
wrestling in the collegiate, free
style, or Greco-Roman style.
Tomorrow the team travels to the
Cal State Tournament at
Hay ward.
In all, 15 matches are set for
between now and February 23-24,
when the Pac-8 championships are
held at Oregon State.
Demeo expects Oregon and
Washington, which always field
strong teams, to be contenders for
the team championship. However,
he also believes that Horpel,
Krebs, Davis, and Kopolow, and
possibly several other Stanford
athletes will place well.
Although the team is made up
almost exclusively of non-athletic
scholarship students who wrestle
only for "fun," it appears that the
Cardinals may finally be able to
compete successfully this year.
With no less than 12 returning
lettermen and several talented
freshmen competing for
first-string positions in 10 weight
divisions, the outlook for
Stanford's wrestling team is
brighter this year than it has been
for the past several seasons.
In Joe Demeo's first two years
of handling the team, "we had all
freshmen and sophomores going
against seniors from other schools,
and so we didn't have much of a
chance."
However, in this, his third year
of coaching here, Demeo expects
the Cardinal grapplers to perform
well against good competition,
and to feature several contenders
for Pacific-8 conference
championships.
The following is a list of the
top wrestlers at each weight limit.
Although there is only one
entrant per meet per position,
others also get a chance during
weeks with two or more meets.
Olympic Trials Winner
118 lbs. — Freshman Jim
Tatarakis is wrestling well and is
vying with sophomore Allen
Axworthy, who won the district
Olympic trials last year, for this
spot.
126 — The Cardinals have two
good wrestlers here with former
co-captain David Kopolow, who
Demeo considers a Pac-8
championship contender this year
as a junior, and also Bobby
Swetman, a blind sophomore who

had a good record as a freshman.
134 — Danny Mueller, a junior,
and Mark Lotheridge, a freshman,
will compete at this position.
142 — Co-captain Ken Krebs,
who reached the semifinals of the
Pac-8 championships last year,
returns as a very promising junior.
'The Best'
150 — Chris Horpel, who
Demeo called "definitely our best
wrestler last year," returns as
co-captain and a nationally ranked
junior.
158 — Jerry Ross, a former
captain and a senior, and Emmett
Stanton, a sophomore letterman,
vie for this slot.
167 — Freshmen Don Penrose
and John Ehman are both
considered to have promise at this
weight.
177 — Senior Mark Davis, a
former runner-up in the New
England championships before
transferring here from the Coast
Guard Academy, is top man at
this level, while John Goves, a
freshman who was outstanding in
high school, will also see action.
190 — Two sophomores,
letterman Mark Feinstein and also
Mark Frelier, will hold this
weight.
Heavyweight — Stanford has
three "big guys" vying for this
position. They are two-time
letterman Mike Achenback, a
junior, sophomore Chris
Westersunt, and freshman Art
Estrada.

The dual meet season begins
