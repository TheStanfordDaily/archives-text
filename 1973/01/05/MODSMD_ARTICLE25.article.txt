# Scholarship Changes Urged

### JIM WASCHER 
Representatives of the student
governments of seven universities
in the Pacific-Eight Conference
have urged that the Conference
award grants-in-aid to athletes "on
a sliding scale based on ability to
pay (need) starting with the
1974-1975 academic year."
This proposal and four others
were drafted at a Dec. 2 meeting
here attended by student
government officers from
Washington, Washington State,
Oregon, Oregon State and
Stanford. According to ASSU
Co-president Brent Appel, "the
two schools not present, UCLA
and Berkeley, encountered
logistical problems in attending
the conference." Appel said that
USC does not have a student
government at this time.
The student government
representatives also suggested:
that the Pac-8 allow a student
from each member school to sit
on the Conference's Council; that
"greater financial resources of the
Pacific-8 schools be allocated for
women's athletic programs;"

"that the Pacific-8 recommend to
the NCAA that national ceilings
on grants-in-aid be set at current
Pacific-8 levels" (estimated at a
maximum of 110 grants for
football players at each school
during the 1974-75 academic
year); and "that the Pacific-8
continue its efforts to control and
decrease recruitment
expenditures."
Concern Over Professionalism
Appel said that the conference
was inspired by a letter he
received from Cliff Zukin, the
President of the student Senate at
Oregon. According to Appel,
Zukin expressed his concern over
increasing professionalization
among Pac-8 athletes.
Appel added that "the need
factor" was of primary concern to
those attending the meeting here.
He said that Stanford "came off
the best" in the Pac-8 because it

gave the lowest number of
grants-in-aid to football players
this year. Stanford gave 81 grants,
as compared to 137 at
Washington, 114 at Oregon State
and between 90 and 104 at the
other five universities.
Athletic Director Joe Ruetz:
said that he was "in favor of the
need factor (for grants) in college
athletics for the sake of equity."
He added that his proposal to the
most recent meeting of the Pac-8
Council for grants based on need
was rejected 7-1 by the Council's
athletic directors and 6-2 by the
Council's faculty representatives.
Ruetz said that the Conference's
university presidents were evenly
split on his proposal.
Ruetz Proposal
Ruetz said that he doubted
"very much that the (Pac-8)
Conference would take a
unilateral action (on the grart

question) without the rest of the
country going along." He plans to
propose a program of grants based
on need to the NCAA convention
being held Jan. 10-13 in Chicago.
Ruetz was not optimistic about
the chances for his proposal,
explaining that a poll of Big Ten
representatives showed that they
were unanimously opposed to
applying the need factor to grants.
Ruetz would "have no
objection to anyone sitting in on
the Council" meetings, but
questioned whether the student
representatives should be student
government officials or athletes.
