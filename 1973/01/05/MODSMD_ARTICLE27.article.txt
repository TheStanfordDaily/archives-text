# Frosh, Vets To Swim In Intrasquad Meet
## 
### MIKE CHASSON 
The Stanford swim team will
start off 1973 with a freshmen vs
upper classmen dual meet this
Saturday at the Men's Gym Pools.
The meet should produce a
number of excellent races with
the meet going down to the last
relay if everything goes according
to Coach Jim Gaughran's
calculations.
The best races should be the
distance freestyle events, the 200
IM, and the 200 breastroke. In the
1000 free, freshmen Steve Strong,
Tom Crena and either Paul Clark
or Ron Longinotti will face junior
Terry Sutton.
Sutton will be tough to beat as
he recorded what may be the best
1650 lime in the country so far this
year with a 16.18 at a meet in
Cincinnati over vacation.
In the 200 IM frosh Olympian
John Hencken will face fellow
Olympian Brian Job and Soph
Randy Whitchurch. Hencken
worked hard over the vacation,
while Job had an easier time
swimming in Hawaii with other
members of the Stanford team.
Job Holds Record
Job and Hencken will also
match up in the 200 breast, an

event in which Job holds the
American record. Hencken holds
the world record in the 200 meter
event, and won the gold medal at
Munich.
The 500 free will match Sutton
against Strong, Clark and Crena
in what should be one of the most
exciting races of the meet. Strong
worked out hard in Arizona over
the vacation and should give
Sutton a good race.
The upper classmen should
sweep the 50 and 100 free with
all-americans Martin Pedley and
Dean Anderson leading the way.
Whitchurch and Jack Deppe
should have an easy time in
winning the 200 back for the
upper classmen.
The frosh are favored in the
200 free with Richard Cook
leading the way. The 200 fly and
the 400 free relay are question
marks which could decide the
final outcome of the meet if
everything else goes according to
Gaughran's form sheet.
The meet will begin at 2 p.m.
and will consist only of swimming
events since there are no freshmen
divers.
Hawaiian Vacation
Coach Gaughran and eighteen
members of the team travelled to
Hawaii over the vacation. They
worked out at the University of
Hawaii two hours in the morning
while leaving the rest of the day
for surfing and skin diving.
While in the Islands the team
participated in one meet with the
numerous other colleges working
out n the area. Gaughran praised

Job, Whitchurch, and Cook for
excellent performances in the
meet. He was also pleased with
the improvement of frosh sprinter
Bruce Goodwin while in Hawaii.
This weekend's meet will be
the team's final tune-up before its
first tough dual meet against the
University of Washington on
January 13.
The Huskies, last year's sixth
place NCAA finisher, recorded
some excellent early season times
at a meet in Seattle before the
start of vacation.
On the basis of this weekend's
results the Cardinals should be
able to see how they measure up
against this tough conference
opponent.
