# Anti-War Journey Announced; McAfee Brown To Tour Europe
## 
### MARK SIMONIAN 
Robert McAfee Brown, interim Dean of the Chapel,
announced yesterday that he and five other religious
leaders from across the nation will journey to four
European nations next week to raise international support
for the anti-Vietnam War movement.
Brown, Prof. Harvey Cox of the Harvard Divinity
School, Sister Mary Luke Tobin of the Sisters of Loretto,
Bishop Robert DeWitt of the Episcopal Diocese of
Pennsylvania, Bishop James Armstrong, Methodist Bishop
of the Dakotas, and a rabbi whose name was unavailable
will leave Sunday for England, Holland, Germany, and
Italy in a four-day tour. During the trip, the group will
hold press conferences and meetings with religious leaders
of the various countries.
"We are appealing to the world community to help us
resolve a world problem," Brown explained. "We will
make our appeal through the religious community in the
hopes that they can make their pressures felt on the
peoples and governments of the world."

The dean said that he also hopes that the group can get
"more powerful, more articulate statements and actions"
from other nations to help "diminish the bombing and
increase the chances for peace."
"We will speak in our own names, but we will also
represent the people in this country who are opposed to
the war," he said.
"The Vietnam War is beyond our capacity to resolve as
Americans. We have failed miserably for years. We need
the concern and help of the rest of the world," he
remarked.
Brown also hopes that the group's trip will arouse "a
new level of concern" here in this country as well. He
urged support of congressmen who will attempt to cut off
all appropriations for the war effort.
Brown was scheduled to travel to Washington D.C. this
week to join a group of Midpeninsula residents lobbying
to cut off war appropriations, but cancelled those plans to
arrange his European trip.
