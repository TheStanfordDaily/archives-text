Senate Demos Desire War Funds Cut
WASHINGTON — Senate Democrats agreed
overwhelmingly yesterday to support legislation cutting
off funds for the Vietnam war.
The 36-12 vote in the Senate Democratic Conference
followed a 154-75 vote of House Democrats who adopted
the same position Tuesday and ignored a White House
warning that such action by Congress could prolong peace
negotiations.
Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield, D-Mont., said
he saw no chance that the fund cutoff policy could be
translated into legislation by Jan. 20, when President
Nixon begins his second term.
But Chairman J.W. Fulbright, D-Ark., of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee told the Senate, "I believe
that Congress can and should act decisively immediately
after the inauguration."
Legislation to cut off funding for military operations in
Indochina and to require total withdrawal of all U.S.
forces within 60 days was introduced in the Senate by
Sens. Edward W. Brooke, R-Mass., and Alan Cranston,
D-Calif., and a bipartisan group of 18 co-sponsors.
Like the Democratic policy statement sponsored by
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., the bill would allow
use of funds only for defense of withdrawing forces
conditioned upon release of American prisoners of war
and an accounting of Americans missing in action.
Adoption of the fund cutoff resolution in the Senate
Democratic Conference followed rejection by one vote,
24-23, of a proposal by Sen. Henry M. Jackson, D-Wash.,
that the majority leader invite President Nixon to explain
to Congress the breakdown of peace negotiations in Paris
in December and the massive bombing of North Vietnam
that followed.
Jet Lands Safely After Bomb Threat
ELLSWORTH AIR FORCE BASE, S.D. - A transatlantic
jumbo jet carrying 233 persons landed safely at the
Strategic Air Command Base here yesterday after being
diverted from New York following a telephoned bomb
threat.
The Trans World Airline Boeing 747, en route from
Madrid, Spain, touched down about 4'/2 hours after
Ellsworth officials received word it was being diverted
because of the extortion threat.
An Air Force bomb squad immediately began a search
of the plane, and the FBI took charge of the investigation.
An FBI spokesman in Minneapolis said there had been no
report of a bomb found aboard the aircraft. "If a bomb
had been found, we'd know about it," the FBI agent said.
Originally, TWA said the flight was being sent to
milehigh Denver airport because the caller said a bomb
aboard was set to explode below 3000 feet.
A spokesman at Ellsworth, located near Rapid City,
said the 13,500-foot runway used by the jetliner was at an
elevation of 3200 feet above sea level.
Bombing Damage Assessed
SAIGON — More than 100 American casualties have been
reported in Indochina since the resumption of stepped-up
bombing last month, and aircraft losses now number 30 in
the costliest air campaign of the war.
On the other side, Radio Hanoi claimed Thursday that
1318 persons were killed during the B52 raids and added
that there is no indication the United States "is ready to
renounce further aggression."
The U.S. Command reversed its decision of the
previous day and said it would not make public its own
assessment of the bomb damage in Hanoi and Haiphong

from Dec. 26 to 30. A spokesman gave no reason for the
decision.
Other sources indicated that a directive from
Washington ordered the assessment withheld because of
the peace talks and international controversy over Hanoi's
allegations that civilian targets were hit.
But in Washington the Defense Department
spokesman, Jerry W. Friedheim, said the Pentagon hoped
to be able to provide shortly a summary of the bombing.
In Paris, the 172 nd session of the peace talks took
place, with U.S. Ambassador William J. Porter asserting
that the new year should mark "the concluding phase of
this protracted conflict." He added, however, that he did
not "underestimate the problems which exist and which
will face us for some time."
Pentagon Papers Jury Seleetion
LOS ANGELES — Potential jurors in the Pentagon Papers
trial, quizzed yesterday about the case's key issue, the
Vietnam war, voiced frustration, confusion and a common
wish "that it was all over with."
The war issue was raised for the first time in the second
day of the search for a new jury to judge Daniel Ellsberg
and Anthony Russo.
Five potential jurors, questioned in depth individually
by U.S. District Court Judge Matt Byrne, said they
wanted the war ended, but most hoped it would end
"admirably" for the United States.
For the first time since the case started more than a
year ago, Byrne asked potential jurors whether they felt
the government had withheld from the American people
information about why the United States was involved in
the Vietnam war. Four said they believed the government
had withheld information, and one said she did not know.
Earlier in the day, the 12 potential jurors and six
potential alternates seated tentatively in the jury box for
questioning swore they had no bias against persons who
demonstrated against the war or were active in the antiwar
movement.
To initial queries by U.S. District Court Judge Matt
Byrne, the 11 women and seven men said they had never
demonstrated for or against the war or belonged to any
organization with views on the war.
Ellsberg, 41, and Russo, 35, are charged with
espionage, conspiracy and theft in connection with their
release to news media in 1971 of top-secret documents
detailing origins of the Vietnam war.
The first jury chosen for their trial last summer was
dismissed last month after a long delay while the defense
appealed legal matters to higher courts.
Passage Of Tax-Reform Bill Forseen
WASHINGTON — Rep. Wilbur D. Mills, the House tax
chief, foresees passage by the House this summer of a tax
reform bill — but one not likely to include some of the
changes for which reformers have been pressing.
The Arkansas Democrat said in an interview that the
legislation, though intended to correct some inequities,
probably will not substantially increase government
revenues nor result in a big overall tax cut.
The Ways and Means Committee, of which Mills is
chairman, will begin about six weeks of hearings late this
month or early in February, reviewing all tax preferences,
Mills said.
Today's Weather

The 36-12 vote in the Senate Democratic Conference
followed a 154-75 vote of House Democrats who adopted
the same position Tuesday and ignored a White House
warning that such action by Congress could prolong peace
negotiations.
Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield, D-Mont., said
he saw no chance that the fund cutoff policy could be
translated into legislation by Jan. 20, when President
Nixon begins his second term.
But Chairman J.W. Fulbright, D-Ark., of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee told the Senate, "I believe
that Congress can and should act decisively immediately
after the inauguration."
Legislation to cut off funding for military operations in
Indochina and to require total withdrawal of all U.S.
forces within 60 days was introduced in the Senate by
Sens. Edward W. Brooke, R-Mass., and Alan Cranston,
D-Calif., and a bipartisan group of 18 co-sponsors.
Like the Democratic policy statement sponsored by
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., the bill would allow
use of funds only for defense of withdrawing forces
conditioned upon release of American prisoners of war
and an accounting of Americans missing in action.
Adoption of the fund cutoff resolution in the Senate
Democratic Conference followed rejection by one vote,
24-23, of a proposal by Sen. Henry M. Jackson, D-Wash.,
that the majority leader invite President Nixon to explain
to Congress the breakdown of peace negotiations in Paris
in December and the massive bombing of North Vietnam
that followed.
Jet Lands Safely After Bomb Threat
ELLSWORTH AIR FORCE BASE, S.D. - A transatlantic
jumbo jet carrying 233 persons landed safely at the
Strategic Air Command Base here yesterday after being
diverted from New York following a telephoned bomb
threat.
The Trans World Airline Boeing 747, en route from
Madrid, Spain, touched down about 4'/2 hours after
Ellsworth officials received word it was being diverted
because of the extortion threat.
An Air Force bomb squad immediately began a search
of the plane, and the FBI took charge of the investigation.
An FBI spokesman in Minneapolis said there had been no
report of a bomb found aboard the aircraft. "If a bomb
had been found, we'd know about it," the FBI agent said.
Originally, TWA said the flight was being sent to
milehigh Denver airport because the caller said a bomb
aboard was set to explode below 3000 feet.
A spokesman at Ellsworth, located near Rapid City,
said the 13,500-foot runway used by the jetliner was at an
elevation of 3200 feet above sea level.
Bombing Damage Assessed
SAIGON — More than 100 American casualties have been
reported in Indochina since the resumption of stepped-up
bombing last month, and aircraft losses now number 30 in
the costliest air campaign of the war.
On the other side, Radio Hanoi claimed Thursday that
1318 persons were killed during the B52 raids and added
that there is no indication the United States "is ready to
renounce further aggression."
The U.S. Command reversed its decision of the
previous day and said it would not make public its own
assessment of the bomb damage in Hanoi and Haiphong

from Dec. 26 to 30. A spokesman gave no reason for the
decision.
Other sources indicated that a directive from
Washington ordered the assessment withheld because of
the peace talks and international controversy over Hanoi's
allegations that civilian targets were hit.
But in Washington the Defense Department
spokesman, Jerry W. Friedheim, said the Pentagon hoped
to be able to provide shortly a summary of the bombing.
In Paris, the 172 nd session of the peace talks took
place, with U.S. Ambassador William J. Porter asserting
that the new year should mark "the concluding phase of
this protracted conflict." He added, however, that he did
not "underestimate the problems which exist and which
will face us for some time."
Pentagon Papers Jury Seleetion
LOS ANGELES — Potential jurors in the Pentagon Papers
trial, quizzed yesterday about the case's key issue, the
Vietnam war, voiced frustration, confusion and a common
wish "that it was all over with."
The war issue was raised for the first time in the second
day of the search for a new jury to judge Daniel Ellsberg
and Anthony Russo.
Five potential jurors, questioned in depth individually
by U.S. District Court Judge Matt Byrne, said they
wanted the war ended, but most hoped it would end
"admirably" for the United States.
For the first time since the case started more than a
year ago, Byrne asked potential jurors whether they felt
the government had withheld from the American people
information about why the United States was involved in
the Vietnam war. Four said they believed the government
had withheld information, and one said she did not know.
Earlier in the day, the 12 potential jurors and six
potential alternates seated tentatively in the jury box for
questioning swore they had no bias against persons who
demonstrated against the war or were active in the antiwar
movement.
To initial queries by U.S. District Court Judge Matt
Byrne, the 11 women and seven men said they had never
demonstrated for or against the war or belonged to any
organization with views on the war.
Ellsberg, 41, and Russo, 35, are charged with
espionage, conspiracy and theft in connection with their
release to news media in 1971 of top-secret documents
detailing origins of the Vietnam war.
The first jury chosen for their trial last summer was
dismissed last month after a long delay while the defense
appealed legal matters to higher courts.
Passage Of Tax-Reform Bill Forseen
WASHINGTON — Rep. Wilbur D. Mills, the House tax
chief, foresees passage by the House this summer of a tax
reform bill — but one not likely to include some of the
changes for which reformers have been pressing.
The Arkansas Democrat said in an interview that the
legislation, though intended to correct some inequities,
probably will not substantially increase government
revenues nor result in a big overall tax cut.
The Ways and Means Committee, of which Mills is
chairman, will begin about six weeks of hearings late this
month or early in February, reviewing all tax preferences,
Mills said.

warning that such action by Congress could prolong peace
negotiations.
Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield, D-Mont., said
he saw no chance that the fund cutoff policy could be
translated into legislation by Jan. 20, when President
Nixon begins his second term.
But Chairman J.W. Fulbright, D-Ark., of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee told the Senate, "I believe
that Congress can and should act decisively immediately
after the inauguration."
Legislation to cut off funding for military operations in
Indochina and to require total withdrawal of all U.S.
forces within 60 days was introduced in the Senate by
Sens. Edward W. Brooke, R-Mass., and Alan Cranston,
D-Calif., and a bipartisan group of 18 co-sponsors.
Like the Democratic policy statement sponsored by
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., the bill would allow
use of funds only for defense of withdrawing forces
conditioned upon release of American prisoners of war
and an accounting of Americans missing in action.
Adoption of the fund cutoff resolution in the Senate
Democratic Conference followed rejection by one vote,
24-23, of a proposal by Sen. Henry M. Jackson, D-Wash.,
that the majority leader invite President Nixon to explain
to Congress the breakdown of peace negotiations in Paris
in December and the massive bombing of North Vietnam
that followed.
Jet Lands Safely After Bomb Threat
ELLSWORTH AIR FORCE BASE, S.D. - A transatlantic
jumbo jet carrying 233 persons landed safely at the
Strategic Air Command Base here yesterday after being
diverted from New York following a telephoned bomb
threat.
The Trans World Airline Boeing 747, en route from
Madrid, Spain, touched down about 4'/2 hours after
Ellsworth officials received word it was being diverted
because of the extortion threat.
An Air Force bomb squad immediately began a search
of the plane, and the FBI took charge of the investigation.
An FBI spokesman in Minneapolis said there had been no
report of a bomb found aboard the aircraft. "If a bomb
had been found, we'd know about it," the FBI agent said.
Originally, TWA said the flight was being sent to
milehigh Denver airport because the caller said a bomb
aboard was set to explode below 3000 feet.
A spokesman at Ellsworth, located near Rapid City,
said the 13,500-foot runway used by the jetliner was at an
elevation of 3200 feet above sea level.
Bombing Damage Assessed
SAIGON — More than 100 American casualties have been
reported in Indochina since the resumption of stepped-up
bombing last month, and aircraft losses now number 30 in
the costliest air campaign of the war.
On the other side, Radio Hanoi claimed Thursday that
1318 persons were killed during the B52 raids and added
that there is no indication the United States "is ready to
renounce further aggression."
The U.S. Command reversed its decision of the
previous day and said it would not make public its own
assessment of the bomb damage in Hanoi and Haiphong

from Dec. 26 to 30. A spokesman gave no reason for the
decision.
Other sources indicated that a directive from
Washington ordered the assessment withheld because of
the peace talks and international controversy over Hanoi's
allegations that civilian targets were hit.
But in Washington the Defense Department
spokesman, Jerry W. Friedheim, said the Pentagon hoped
to be able to provide shortly a summary of the bombing.
In Paris, the 172 nd session of the peace talks took
place, with U.S. Ambassador William J. Porter asserting
that the new year should mark "the concluding phase of
this protracted conflict." He added, however, that he did
not "underestimate the problems which exist and which
will face us for some time."
Pentagon Papers Jury Seleetion
LOS ANGELES — Potential jurors in the Pentagon Papers
trial, quizzed yesterday about the case's key issue, the
Vietnam war, voiced frustration, confusion and a common
wish "that it was all over with."
The war issue was raised for the first time in the second
day of the search for a new jury to judge Daniel Ellsberg
and Anthony Russo.
Five potential jurors, questioned in depth individually
by U.S. District Court Judge Matt Byrne, said they
wanted the war ended, but most hoped it would end
"admirably" for the United States.
For the first time since the case started more than a
year ago, Byrne asked potential jurors whether they felt
the government had withheld from the American people
information about why the United States was involved in
the Vietnam war. Four said they believed the government
had withheld information, and one said she did not know.
Earlier in the day, the 12 potential jurors and six
potential alternates seated tentatively in the jury box for
questioning swore they had no bias against persons who
demonstrated against the war or were active in the antiwar
movement.
To initial queries by U.S. District Court Judge Matt
Byrne, the 11 women and seven men said they had never
demonstrated for or against the war or belonged to any
organization with views on the war.
Ellsberg, 41, and Russo, 35, are charged with
espionage, conspiracy and theft in connection with their
release to news media in 1971 of top-secret documents
detailing origins of the Vietnam war.
The first jury chosen for their trial last summer was
dismissed last month after a long delay while the defense
appealed legal matters to higher courts.
Passage Of Tax-Reform Bill Forseen
WASHINGTON — Rep. Wilbur D. Mills, the House tax
chief, foresees passage by the House this summer of a tax
reform bill — but one not likely to include some of the
changes for which reformers have been pressing.
The Arkansas Democrat said in an interview that the
legislation, though intended to correct some inequities,
probably will not substantially increase government
revenues nor result in a big overall tax cut.
The Ways and Means Committee, of which Mills is
chairman, will begin about six weeks of hearings late this
month or early in February, reviewing all tax preferences,
Mills said.
