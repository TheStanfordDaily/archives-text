# Pedestrian Mall Plans Unveiled
## 
### ROBERT BACON 
Plans for a pedestrian shopping mall
connecting Macy's with Saks Fifth
Avenue and Bullock's in the Stanford
Shopping Center were unveiled Dec.
16 by architects and development
consultants.
Stanford officials repeatedly
stressed during a session at which the
plans were presented to about 75
community leaders, that the
presentation represented "a general
direction" and possible "alternatives"
and not final development decisions.
Peter Kamnitzer, UCLA
architecture and planning professor
affiliated with the firm of Kamnitzer,
Marks and Partners of Los Angeles,
presented the results of his firm's
investigations of the 20-year-old
Shopping Center located northwest of
the campus.
Kamnitzer urged creation of
"linkages" — roads, public
transportation, parks, and pedestrian
and bicycle paths as well as more
abstract "social and institutional
linkages" between the Center, Palo

Alto, Menlo Park, Stanford Medical
Center and the campus.
Commuters
During the question period which
followed his presentation, he was
urged to expand his vision to include
more distant communities from which
many workers commute to Stanford
and Palo Alto.
Representatives of
anti-development groups — liberal
"residentiaiists" as well as radicals —
suggested that the question of "why
develop?" had not been posed by
Stanford officials or their consultants.
Several insisted that housing should be
Stanford's highest development
priority.
Some opponents of development
were invited to the session after they
complained that the original invitation
list showed a heavy pro-development
bias. A few others attended uninvited;
no one voiced objection though they
took part in the discussion.
Housing Units
Kamnitzer suggested the possibility
of placing housing units atop some of

the commercial buildings along the
new mall.
He concluded by saying "You have
a unique opportunity for a true
activity mix" — residential,
commercial, medical, academic —
"since you have a very large parcel of
land in one ownership" — Stanford's.
Kamnitzer's preliminary "doodles,"
as he described them, would tunnel
Arboretum Road beneath the new
mall, and double-deck much of the
Shopping Center parking area by
depressing one deck below ground and
placing the second deck at ground
level.
To facilitate the new mall, Quarry
Road would be rerouted to pass
between the Arboretum and the open
fields at the present intersection of
Arboretum and Quarry Roads. It
would also pass on the other side of
Hoover Pavilion Hospital.
Unrealized Potential
Kamnitzer pointed to "accessibility
problems that create unrealized
potential" for the shopping center.
Better bus service between downtown

Palo Alto and the center he called "a
glaring need."
He said that while viewing the
traffic pattern around the center, he
was "overwhelmed by the
hodge-podge of incomplete
circulation." There is no through
street from Palo Alto to the center and
more than one street in the area
dead-ends in a parking lot.
University Vice President for
Business and Finance, Robert R.
Augsburger, who presided at the
meeting, said that after the session the
planners would prepare more specific
plans, taking into account feedback
received from the community.
Afterward, he indicated, would come
study sessions with the Palo Alto
Planning Commission to refine the
plans and seek additional reaction.
Rouse Corporation
Kamnitzer was retained by the
Rouse Corporation of Columbia,
Maryland, creators of shopping centers
and "model" towns in the East.
Rouse, in turn, had been engaged by
Stanford last spring to prepare plans to
"strengthen the Shopping Center to
keep it vital."
Rouse Vice-President Scott Ditch
opened the meeting with an illustrated
presentation showing other projects of
his firm, which include the "new city"
of Columbia, which is being built to
house over 100,000 people.
Augsburger intimated during his
remarks that Stanford is considering
devoting the 45-acre site on Willow
Road between the Oak Creek
Apartments and the Children's
Hospital for housing.
The vacant parcel across the road,
between Saks and Pasteur Drive, he

said was being held for future
academic expansion.
Those attending the meeting
included members of the Palo Alto
and Menlo Park City Councils and
Planning Commissions, members of
the University planning staff, and
representatives of chambers of
commerce, environmental groups, and
retail firms already located in the
Center.
University officials indicated that
Stanford is often accused of presenting
development plans to the surrounding
communities as a fait accompli; the
Dec. 16 session, which Augsburger said
he hoped was the first of a series, was
intended to gain community feedback
earlier in the planning process.
