# Washington Summer Program
## D.C. Jobs Attract Students 
### D. CAROL BAIN 
What is possibly Stanford's most
exotic "foreign" campus isn't even
outside the nation's boundaries. Every
year since its inception in 1963,
Stanford-in-Washington (SIW) has
placed students in positions within the
bureaucratic jungle that governs the
United States.
Last summer SIW found
government jobs for 100 students,
twice as many as in 1970. SIW Student
Board members travel to Washington
during winter quarter to lobby for the
student applicants. John Sabl, the

current chairman, credited the
program's success to active lobbying.
In recent years the program,
founded in 1963, has expanded to
include internships in Sacramento,
local government, and private
organizations. Future plans include
foreign embassy jobs.
Funding has always been one of the
program's chief problems. Since most
of the jobs pay very little or nothing at
all, students have to finance their stay
in Washington. Financial stipends are
available on a limited basis. Since
funding depends on the belevolence of
Stanford alumni, a concerted effort
has been made in the past two years to
hit their pocketbooks.
Lobbying For Money
Barton Thompson, past chairman
of the program, explained the effort.
"When we went back to Washington to
lobby for jobs in 1971, we also
lobbied for money. We contacted the
rich Stanford alumni in the
Washington area. We were amazed at
the results. Our goal was to double the
budget; instead, the budget has
multiplied in the last two years by a
factor of five," he said.
The Stanford program offers a
multi-faceted involvement in the gears
of bureaucratic machinery. According
to Sabl, "the optimum job allows the
intern to see how a government office
works. This necessarily involves some
clerical work. But hopefully the intern
will devote a good part of his time to
more substantial tasks — for example,
in a congressional office that would

involve researching legislation," he
added.
Much 'Dull' Work
However, the legislative duties of an
intern are sometimes overshadowed by
clerical tasks. Michael Fletcher, a
senior in political science, spent the
better part of his summer reorganizing
Sen. Alan Cranston's (D-Calif.) files.
Fletcher "ducked out of the drudgery
as often as possible."
Fletcher managed to do some
legislative work. "It was a strange
situation straddling the line between
the administrative and legislative
departments. There was a certain
amount of tension between the two
branches," he said.
"The two departments differ in
their attitudes toward interns," he
continued. "The administrative
assistant considered paper work the
intern's primary task, whereas the
legislative assistant emphasized
research."
Divided Office
Barbara Thompson, who worked on
women's rights legislation for Rep.
Bella Abzug (D.-N.Y.), had a similar
experience. "The office was divided
down the middle — the male legislators
and female interns on one side and the
administrators, middle-aged secretary
types, on the other side. I learned a lot
about underground office life," she
said.
According to Sabl, the goal is to
obtain as many "optimum jobs" as
possible for the applicants, regardless

GETTING OLDER — The Stanford Shopping Center, located amid the asphalt
at the northwest corner of the campus, is as old as some Stanford students and,
according to University land development officials, is beginning to show its age.
They have begun studies of ways to expand and modernize it to keep the
customers satisfied. Not everybody thinks that sprucing up the Center is wcrf i
several million dollars, however, and proponents and critics debated the issue at
a meeting last month.
of their qualifications. "The Board
does not evaluate student applications.
All applicants are given equal
treatment. However, during the
interview we try to find out what their
interests and strengths are," he added.
Board Deemed Impartial
Thompson insisted that the Board
does not play favorites. "A White
House official notified the Board of
three staff positions available to
Stanford applicants. If UCLA Board
members had been told of the
positions, they undoubtedly would
have chosen among themselves.
"In our case, two of the three
positions did go to SIW Board
members, but that was because the
White House people deemed them
more qualified than non-Board
members," he stated.
Thompson added that top jobs
often go to Board members because
employers consider them better
qualified. Thompson himself spent
two of his summers "initiating
legislation for Congressman Alphonzo
Bell of Los Angeles. One or two
solutions in my report concerning the
aerospace unemployment problem
were introduced as bills," he said.
Reginald Turner, coordinator of
SlW's Black program, spent his
summer researching challenges for the

Minority Caucus of the Democratic
Convention. "In Washington I filed a
minority report in reference to the
Oklahoma Challenge with the
Credentials Committee. After it lost
by four votes, 1 took it to the
Convention floor in Miami," Turner
said.

Marilyn Garcia, coordinator of the
Chicano program, "evaluated bilingual
education funds and prepared a report
for future allocations for a branch of
Health, Education and Welfare. 1
gained insights into the sophisticated
techniques used by the people in
power," she stated.
