## Press Rights 
### 
Last June the Supreme Court struck down capital punishment in
what will be a landmark decision for decades to come. That
commendable decision, however, greatly overshadowed the other
major ruling the Court made that day, in a case involving newsmen's
rights.
In the Earl Caldwell case, the Court ruled 5-4 that newsmen are not
entitled to special protection from grand jury subpoenas. Newsmen
around the country were greatly alarmed by that decision and in
recent months our worst fears have begun to be realized.
It is now clear that the Nixon administration has added that
decision to its arsenal of anti-press weapons for a second term
continuation of its war on the media.
The press has long been considered a natural adversary of the
government. No one needs to again quote Thomas Jefferson to
illustrate that one of the press's most important jobs is its function as
a watchdog of the government.
But ever since his bitter defeat in the California gubernatorial
election of 1962, Richard Nixon has evidently felt that the press is
out to get him and him alone. And once he became President, it was
obvious that he was going to try to thwart the press as much as
possible.
Vice-President Agnew's famous Des Moines speech epitomized this
Administration's hatred for the press and although Agnew has toned
down a bit over the past year, it is very probable that the next four
years will include an escalation of the President's war on the press.
Los Angeles Times reporter William Farr, who has now spent over
five weeks in a Los Angeles jail cell for refusing to divulge the source
of a story, is the most famous in a long line of reporters who have fek
the severity of a governmental attack.
The examples of governmental disregard for the First Amendment
are far too many to list, but two recent incidents are as serious as any.
In mid-December, John Lawrence, Washington bureau chief of the
Los Angeles Times, was jailed briefly for refusing to turn over tapes of
an interview with a prosecution witness in the Watergate case to a
federal judge. In this case, the infringement on First Amendment
rights went far beyond compromising a source to the much more
serious act of demanding a reporter's notes.
The legal point in this case was never resolved because the witness
agreed to full disclosure of the tapes, but the few hours Lawrence
spent in jail were an extremely bad omen for the American press.
Perhaps an even more appalling incident occurred about the same
time when Clay Whitehead, the director of the White House Office of
Telecommunications Policy announced that the Administration plans
to push for legislation that would make local television stations
responsible for the content of network news programs they carry.
The Administration has long been critical of what they term the
"liberal bias" of the networks, but they have been unable to exert
much pressure since only individual stations and not the networks are
licensed by the Federal Communications Commission.
By not too subtly hinting that the FCC will consider the content of
network newscasts when reviewing a station's license renewal,
Whitehead has proposed one of the most ominous pieces of legislation
to come up in recent years.
The Nixon Administration has already begun a major attack on the
federally-Financed Public Broadcasting System and Whitehead's
proposal is not at all surprising. It is imperative that Congress
vigorously oppose the Administration's attack on the press and
quickly stop the kind of legislation Whitehead proposes. Last week,
Governor Ronald Reagan signed a California "shield law" which
thoroughly protects a newsman's sources and Congress should quickly
follow suit.
The American people must realize that it is their rights that are
being threatened. An attack on the press is in essence an attack on the
public, which the press is designed to serve. Unless the public and
Congress soon realize this, many reporters may be filing stories from
behind bars during the next four years.

around the country were greatly alarmed by that decision and in
recent months our worst fears have begun to be realized.
It is now clear that the Nixon administration has added that
decision to its arsenal of anti-press weapons for a second term
continuation of its war on the media.
The press has long been considered a natural adversary of the
government. No one needs to again quote Thomas Jefferson to
illustrate that one of the press's most important jobs is its function as
a watchdog of the government.
But ever since his bitter defeat in the California gubernatorial
election of 1962, Richard Nixon has evidently felt that the press is
out to get him and him alone. And once he became President, it was
obvious that he was going to try to thwart the press as much as
possible.
Vice-President Agnew's famous Des Moines speech epitomized this
Administration's hatred for the press and although Agnew has toned
down a bit over the past year, it is very probable that the next four
years will include an escalation of the President's war on the press.
Los Angeles Times reporter William Farr, who has now spent over
five weeks in a Los Angeles jail cell for refusing to divulge the source
of a story, is the most famous in a long line of reporters who have fek
the severity of a governmental attack.
The examples of governmental disregard for the First Amendment
are far too many to list, but two recent incidents are as serious as any.
In mid-December, John Lawrence, Washington bureau chief of the
Los Angeles Times, was jailed briefly for refusing to turn over tapes of
an interview with a prosecution witness in the Watergate case to a
federal judge. In this case, the infringement on First Amendment
rights went far beyond compromising a source to the much more
serious act of demanding a reporter's notes.
The legal point in this case was never resolved because the witness
agreed to full disclosure of the tapes, but the few hours Lawrence
spent in jail were an extremely bad omen for the American press.
Perhaps an even more appalling incident occurred about the same
time when Clay Whitehead, the director of the White House Office of
Telecommunications Policy announced that the Administration plans
to push for legislation that would make local television stations
responsible for the content of network news programs they carry.
The Administration has long been critical of what they term the
"liberal bias" of the networks, but they have been unable to exert
much pressure since only individual stations and not the networks are
licensed by the Federal Communications Commission.
By not too subtly hinting that the FCC will consider the content of
network newscasts when reviewing a station's license renewal,
Whitehead has proposed one of the most ominous pieces of legislation
to come up in recent years.
The Nixon Administration has already begun a major attack on the
federally-Financed Public Broadcasting System and Whitehead's
proposal is not at all surprising. It is imperative that Congress
vigorously oppose the Administration's attack on the press and
quickly stop the kind of legislation Whitehead proposes. Last week,
Governor Ronald Reagan signed a California "shield law" which
thoroughly protects a newsman's sources and Congress should quickly
follow suit.
The American people must realize that it is their rights that are
being threatened. An attack on the press is in essence an attack on the
public, which the press is designed to serve. Unless the public and
Congress soon realize this, many reporters may be filing stories from
behind bars during the next four years.
Last June the Supreme Court struck down capital punishment in
what will be a landmark decision for decades to come. That
commendable decision, however, greatly overshadowed the other
major ruling the Court made that day, in a case involving newsmen's
rights.
In the Earl Caldwell case, the Court ruled 5-4 that newsmen are not
entitled to special protection from grand jury subpoenas. Newsmen
around the country were greatly alarmed by that decision and in
recent months our worst fears have begun to be realized.
