## 'Daily' Christmas Grovel 
###

Just as Monday starts the
week, so January begins the year.
That's not profound; but it's
downright depressing.
You wake up Monday morning
and curse the whole unborn week;
but you wake up after Christmas
break and there are weeks and
weeks of Mondays ahead.
But why mope about? Why not
come with me as we return briefly
to those hectic days of Yuletide
cheer around the corner back
there.
Pick up that overturned
champagne glass and let me refill
it with tales of a not-so
improbable Christmas party: a
party held for the staff of this
very newspaper.
Out Of Their Holes
Yes Virginia, there is a Daily
staff. Behind those typewriters
and desks and teletypes are real
people — most of them
undergraduates. And when the
last word reaches print, they all
come out of their little holes to
celebrate just like the rest of us,
or maybe more so.
Picture the office of the
Stanford Daily. (If you've never
been there, I'll provide some
alternate settings for you: an
enormous subterranean grotto lit
by an eerie aquamarine light; a
rickety wooden hut on the
outskirts of the Mojave desert; or
a tree fort hidden in the midst of
a steaming, tropical jungle.)
Now put in this setting a table
full of alcoholic beverages, some
colored tinsel, a worn recording of

Frank Zappa, and plates of hors
d'oeuvres.
Caviar And Quail Eggs
Not just any hors d'oeuvres,
mind you, but caviar, fish spread,
and quail eggs. How bourgeois.
Quail eggs? CAVIAR?? Who
pays for all this extravagance?
Every staff member does,
indirectly, by graciously accepting
a smaller paycheck. Oh, but they
love it.
I arrived at the party at half
past six, wearing a British
double-breasted woolen greatcoat,
pigskin gloves, and slacks from
Macy's.
Numerous staffers and their
guests — or rather I should say
staffers and their numerous guests
— were already in various stages of
intoxication.
Rapt Discussion
The liquor, conversation, and
charm of the company all flowed
freely about the room. In no time,
I found myself in rapt discussion
with my immediate superior, the
opinions editor.
We maneuvered over toward
the more plebian delights of
Foremost Garlic Dip but managed
to get shouldered against a door
marked "Daily Composing
Room."
Commenting that I'd never
seen that door before, my
superior replied, "For years it
hasn't been used. The sign is as
much a mystery as the room's
contents."
By a skillful insertion of some
garlic dip into the padlock, I got

the door open and observed the
room to be no bigger than a
closet. Inside sat a terribly old
man, playing a cello. I apologized
for the interruption and closed
the door just as the editor-in-chief
swayed over.
Glad Tidings
"Glad you could come. Fine
party ishn't it? Jisht fine!" he
exhaled, then staggered on to
plant glad tidings elsewhere, a
drink grasped tightly in his red
hand.
"He's been under a lot of
pressure lately," added a
proofreader quickly.
Slowly the people began to
leave the office for the dinner,
which was held in a small Palo
Alto restaurant. No sooner than
we had all been seated, the
editor-in-chief and his top-level
cronies began a series of toasts.
"To our great friend and hard
worker, so and so."
"To our friends, the printers."
"To ourselves!"
"To our Daily football team!"
someone at a back table shouted.
Ten full minutes later, the
executive-assistant-editor in
charge of management, stood up
and offered a toast, "to our Daily
football team!"
Another columnist turned to
me and remarked, while sipping
his wine, "Every responsible
metropolitan newspaper needs
redundancy ... in order to be a
responsible, metropolitan
newspaper . . . and they all do."

"Let's toast our news editor
and reporter still in Hawaii after
the game," came a shout front the
head table.
"Ish the band there too?"
queried the editor-in-chief.
"No, Coleman's here so I guess
they didn't go," answered
another.
"Ish too bad; they should have
gone."
And on it went, past the veal
cordon bleu, the onion soup, the
salad, and the chocolate mousse.
I ate my meal, engaged in
occasional chit-chat, then slowly
crept toward the door. Standing
in my way was a chief editor of
staff relations and training.
Gesticulating wildly, he was
inviting the gathered multitude to
his house after the dinner for
various unearthly and
unmentionable delights.
I slipped past him, into my
woolen greatcoat, and out into
the freezing night air. As the door
swung closed, my entire career
with the Daily flashed before my
eyes.
Not too bad on the whole, but
strange parties.
The cold numbness around my
nose and ears woke me from my
reveries just in time to hear the
editor-in-chief call from inside,
"God I need some coffee;
anybody have coffee?"
Maybe we could all use some
coffee now that it's January.
