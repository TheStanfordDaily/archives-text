TOLKIEN. He assisted on the
production of the "Oxford
English Dictionary" and the
translation from the French of
the Jerusalem Bible. He was a
Reader in the English Language
at the University of Leeds before
becoming a professor at
Pembroke College and Holywell.
His first published book uxm
"A Middle English Vocabulary."
His academic honors denoted
isolated experience within his
subject matter.
Yet, from J. R. R. Tolkien sprang
furry-footed fantasy creatures,
graceful elves, savage goblins.
Tolkien created gentle green
lands and dark forests bordering
on the malevolent forces that
would enslave the unreal world.
Although he disliked fairy tales
in his own youth, he wrote "The
Hobbit" for his children.
Although each farttasy adventure
ivas devised for the child's mind,
Tolkien is now adulated by the
world's young adults. He has
become one of the most signif
icant Writers For The 70's.
WRITERS FOR THE 70'S s
J. R. R. TOLKIEN illuminates

seriousness and his power of
imagination, his deep idealism
and his elegiac sense of history.
