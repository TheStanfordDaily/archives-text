# Aging Medical Center Worker Protests Lack Of Job Security
## 
### SUE KING 
An aging Stanford Hospital worker,
whose job is being eliminated as part
of a financial cutback, says she will be
laid off March 31 unless she accepts a
33 percent pay cut.
Julia Harvey, 60, a research
assistant to Dr. William V. Robertson,
claims that if forced to retire now, her
pension would be insufficient to
support her husband and herself. But
she claims that the University reneged
on a deal to allow her to switch to
another job without a cut in pay.
Richard L. Balch, assoc. dean for
administration of the School of
Medicine and United Stanford
Employees spokesman Jack B. Truher
both agree that she is espousing the
cause of all older workers by
protesting her pending layoff.
"The question is how they
[Stanford] treat their older workers,"
claims Harvey, "and that is
abominable. We have to make this a
real issue — responsibility to the older
employee. That is really one of the
major issues we have to bring out. We

talk about the youth, about
responsibility for the youth and for
the student — how about
responsibility for the older workers?"
Truher agrees, saying, "The
University has no policy on this sort of
thing. There are affirmative action
groups for minorities but no
protection for senior workers. That
just has to change. It's just a shocking
disgrace."
Balch, however, claims that
Stanford employees are comparatively
well provided for. "Stanford provides
a better retirement plan than the
University of California, for example.
They have no Social Security, which
was the case for Stanford and is for a
great number of universities. Stanford
actually has two retirement plans for
older workers — Prudential Life and
Teachers' Insurance Annuity of
America."
According to Harvey, after
receiving notice of her layoff she met
with Balch and was told to go out and
look for a job, but not to talk about
her salary. "At which point I said,

'What?! What do you mean, not talk
about my salary?' And finally he said
to me, 'Tune in, will you? Tune in —
listen to what we say.' He gave me the
very definite impression that they
would arrange the salary — that there
was no need to worry about it," she
related.
After accepting a job in animal
experimentation which entailed a 33
percent pay cut, she went back to
Balch. She claims that he denied ever
saying that her salary would be
arranged.
"I said to Mrs. Harvey last
September that she mustn't go around
talking about her salary and asking for
that much money," commented Balch.
"She interpreted that to mean that we
would make up the difference in her
salary. That's just the way she
interpreted it.
"There is a job that fits her salary
scale," Balch continued. "She would
have to be trained for it, but I've asked
that it be frozen until I have a chance
to review it... We have already done
so much in Julia's case that it may

have set a precedent."
Harvey received official notice of
her Sept. 1, 1972 layoff in July, 1972.
On July 25 she was told that Dr. Irving
Schulman, now head of the Pediatrics
Department, would find temporary
funding so that her salary could be
extended until Dec. 31,1972.
Additional funding was obtained to
pay Harvey's salary for three more
months after December, so the final
deadline is now March 31.
