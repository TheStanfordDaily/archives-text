Walker's Successor
Editor:
How appropriate it is that from
the Overseas Campus office comes
the announcement of the turning
over of a new leaf for the coming
year; or is it the overturning of
something considerably older and
less fresh? I can't decide.
Dr. Walker's resignation brings
up the very important question of
a successor. In my view the
Overseas Directorship is one of
the most important positions in
the administration. Decisions
made by the Director greatly
shape an important part of many
students' educational experience.
Thus, a successor to Dr. Walker
should be chosen with care.
In the past much criticism of
Dr. Walker has centered on his de
facto disregard for student-faculty
input into the decision-making
channels for important overseas
campus questions. However, it is
rarely ever too late to take
constructive criticism to heart.
Accordingly, I cannot recommend
too strongly that Dr. Walker's
successor be chosen by a
combination of students, faculty,
and administration. A search
committee should now be formed,
and it should be given ample time
in which to arrive at a short-list of
quality candidates for Dr.
Walker's present position.

When Hanoi was bombed

during the Christmas season, 1
suddenly understood the feelings
of many Germans during the
19305. Our government is doing
something that many of us feel is
horribly wrong, yet we feel
helpless to stop it. So I decided to
do something. I sent a wire to my
senators.
Please don't laugh at the
feebleness of my gesture. It wasn't
much to do, but it was something.
I also asked my friends and family
to write, and to contact four or so
more friends in chain letter
fashion. Being optimistic about
the American political system at
this time might prove more
effective than the mass
demonstrations of the past. Who
knows? Congress might finally be
ready (with a little encouragement
from us voters) to assert its
responsibility to declare peace.
A political telegram (15 words)
costs only $1.25 and can be sent
from your home phone. The only
address you need is "Senator Alan
Cranston (or Senator John
Tunney), Senate Office Building,
Washington, D.C." And of course
an airmail letter costs only 11
cents. If you feel involved enough
to take a few minutes for this,
you might also want to contact a
few friends and relatives and ask
them to do the same.
Remember, in politics as in
battle, the victory doesn't always
go to the most powerful. It
sometimes goes to the side that
hangs on the longest.

When Hanoi was bombed

during the Christmas season, 1
suddenly understood the feelings
of many Germans during the
19305. Our government is doing
something that many of us feel is
horribly wrong, yet we feel
helpless to stop it. So I decided to
do something. I sent a wire to my
senators.
Please don't laugh at the
feebleness of my gesture. It wasn't
much to do, but it was something.
I also asked my friends and family
to write, and to contact four or so
more friends in chain letter
fashion. Being optimistic about
the American political system at
this time might prove more
effective than the mass
demonstrations of the past. Who
knows? Congress might finally be
ready (with a little encouragement
from us voters) to assert its
responsibility to declare peace.
A political telegram (15 words)
costs only $1.25 and can be sent
from your home phone. The only
address you need is "Senator Alan
Cranston (or Senator John
Tunney), Senate Office Building,
Washington, D.C." And of course
an airmail letter costs only 11
cents. If you feel involved enough
to take a few minutes for this,
you might also want to contact a
few friends and relatives and ask
them to do the same.
Remember, in politics as in
battle, the victory doesn't always
go to the most powerful. It
sometimes goes to the side that
hangs on the longest.

Walker's Successor
Editor:
How appropriate it is that from
the Overseas Campus office comes
the announcement of the turning
over of a new leaf for the coming
year; or is it the overturning of
something considerably older and
less fresh? I can't decide.
Dr. Walker's resignation brings
up the very important question of
a successor. In my view the
Overseas Directorship is one of
the most important positions in
the administration. Decisions
made by the Director greatly
shape an important part of many
students' educational experience.
Thus, a successor to Dr. Walker
should be chosen with care.
In the past much criticism of
Dr. Walker has centered on his de
facto disregard for student-faculty
input into the decision-making
channels for important overseas
campus questions. However, it is
rarely ever too late to take
constructive criticism to heart.
Accordingly, I cannot recommend
too strongly that Dr. Walker's
successor be chosen by a
combination of students, faculty,
and administration. A search
committee should now be formed,
and it should be given ample time
in which to arrive at a short-list of
quality candidates for Dr.
Walker's present position.
