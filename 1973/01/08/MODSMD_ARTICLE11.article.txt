## Role Of The FBI In Today's Society 
### 
1. Patrick gray iii

The role of the FBI in our
nation today is one of great
significance to the American
people. Our actions are topics of
news stories almost daily. Citizen
interest and concern about our
work and its impact on society are
quite evident.
And this is rightly so.
As a service agency, the FBI is
accountable to the American
people. We do not operate in a
vacuum, cut off from the
mainstream of society. The nature
of our responsibilities—as a part of
the law enforcement
profession—vitally affects the
lives, rights, and property of our

citizens. It is important that the
American people be informed
about our role in helping to
uphold a free society.
In my contacts with citizens
since assuming the position of
acting director of the FBI, I have
been asked some questions
indicating a lack of understanding
as to what our role actually is.
Briefly, let me attempt to clarify
some points which have been
raised.
Investigative Agency
First of all, the FBI is strictly
an investigative agency of the
United States Department of
Justice. We are not a national
police agency. Our assumption of
police functions would conflict
with the responsibilities rightfully
resting with state and local
authorities. The FBl's jurisdiction
is set forth in legislative
enactments and Presidential
directives. The criterion under
which we operate is whether or
not we have the jurisdictional
authority to investigate a matter.
Secondly, we do not make the
laws—we enforce them. Our job is
not to legislate. But we are

obligated to follow the law of the
land and to investigate alleged
violations of the laws under our
jurisdiction. And we adhere
faithfully to the guidelines and
restrictions set down in court
decisions.
Another point of
relevance—the FBI is strictly a
fact-gathering agency. We do not
prosecute alleged violators. We
issue no clearances or guilty
verdicts. The facts we gather are
turned over to the attorneys of
the Department of Justice
without recommendation as to
the disposition of the particular
case involved in the investigation.
Not 'Big Brother'
Perhaps of greatest concern to
those on college campuses across
the land is the allegation that the
FBI is a "big brother," hovering
about, looking over the shoulders
of citizens, checking on their
every move. This is simply not
true.
Let me make one thing clear,
however. We do have
responsibilities in protecting the
internal security of < our nation.
It is vital that we be alert to the

various "isms" which would like to
eradicate the freedoms of the
American people. If groups or
individuals are promoting efforts
designed to undermine
Constitutional guarantees, it is our
task to investigate them—whether
they be on the campus or in the
marketplace. We make no
apologies for carrying out our
responsibilities. We in no way
abridge academic freedom, nor do
we stifle the right to dissent.
My experience in the FBI these
past months has convinced me of
several things. The performance of
the men and women of the FBI is
based on genuine respect for civil
liberties; it observes strict
conformity with due process; and
it rests on standards of integrity
and service that are impervious to
scandal and corruption. These
dedicated public servants display a
selflessness and devotion to duty
that are truly inspiring.
'FBI Deserves Respect'
For these reasons I believe that
the FBI deserves the respect and
confidence of American citizens.
We particularly count on the
support of thoughtful and

responsible young people—young
people who do not equate the
right to dissent with condoning
terror and violence; who do not
mistake freedom for
permissiveness; who do not
believe that confrontation and
intimidation are more effective
than reason in solving our
problems.
We in the FBI welcome
challenge. We know that our
actions will sometimes engender
criticism. We do not pretend to be
infallible. We continually evaluate
and re-evaluate our performance
to insure that it is relevant to the
needs of a constantly changing
society. We want to forge deeper
bonds of understanding with the
citizens we serve.
And we expect to be judged on
our merits—not on misinformed
viewpoints. For it is only in an
atmosphere of fairness and
enlightened concern that we can
effectively uphold and protect
freedom under law. And that is
what the FBI is all about.

Investigation.)
