# students could get 'shortchanged'
## SWOPSI And SCIRE Threatened'

The Stanford Workshop on
Political and Social Issues
(SWOPSI) and the Student Center
for Innovation and Research in
Education (SCIRE) are
experimental programs that were
created largely by students in
order to better meet their
educational goals. The programs
were designed to provide a
mechanism for giving credit for
courses that students wanted but
were not available in the
departments.
But the SWOPSI and SCIRE
programs, perhaps the most
significant curriculum innovations
to come out of the 1960's at
Stanford, may be in the process of
being organizationally imprisoned
and philosophically destroyed.
Already substantially
compromised by the Committee
on Undergraduate Studies, further
changes have been suggested in
the faculty Senate that would
alter the programs beyond
recognition.
The central issue is whether
SWOPSI and SCIRE should be
characterized by broadly based
participatory decision-making on
the part of students and faculty or
by an administrative structure
more stultifying than traditional
academia. If the faculty Senate
opts for the latter this Thursday,
students, who initiated and have
helped maintain the programs,
will be denied an effective role in
the decision-making process.
Students will be getting
shortchanged.
An issue which illustrates the
conflict is the vital question of
who should have the authority to
grant academic credit for SWOPSI

and SCIRE courses. Those who
favor student and faculty control
over the experimental programs
believe that such authority should
rest in the hands of a
student-faculty committee.
Opponents seek to remove such
power from the students and
faculty and place it in the hands
of the Dean of Undergraduate
Studies.
Such controversy may at first
glance appear merely legalistic,
but in education, the maxim that
form influences content is as valid
as it is trite. SWOPSI and SCIRE,
as innovative programs, ought not
be burdened with central
administrative authority that
exceeds that of most departments.
The programs were designed to
be havens from standardized
academia, not adjuncts to it.
Control of these programs by
interested students and faculty
enhances their experimental
nature. This is particularly
important in a prestige University
where academic departments are
allergic to unorthodox views that
may impair their professional
standing.
The record of student
participation on the SWOPSI and
SCIRE policy boards has been
impressive. Professor Arthur
Schawlow, physicist on the
SCIRE policy board, has said that
he is "very impressed by the
seriousness and conscientious
ness" of student members. And
Dean of Undergraduate Studies
James Gibbs told the faculty
Senate last year that the track
record of the programs, with
student participation, was
"excellent."

Not only does student and
faculty control of the program
enhance innovation, but it also
gives the program protection from
pressures on the Dean of
Undergraduate Studies. Realism
demands that we recognize that
the Dean of Undergraduate
Studies is a top-level
administrative officer of the
University. As such, the Dean is
subject to demands of interest
groups, disgruntled alumni, and
external sponsors of University
projects. We know that several
SWOPSI projects have been

controversial, and because of this
it is important to protect them
from the influences to which the
Dean is exposed.
If the proposal to shift credit
authority to the Dean of
Undergraduate Studies passes the
faculty Senate, the experimental
nature of SWOPSI and SCIRE will
be impaired, and the principle of
effective student participation in
the program which they created
will be significantly violated.

The Stanford Workshop on
Political and Social Issues
(SWOPSI) and the Student Center
for Innovation and Research in
Education (SCIRE) are
experimental programs that were
created largely by students in
order to better meet their
educational goals. The programs
were designed to provide a
mechanism for giving credit for
courses that students wanted but
were not available in the
departments.
But the SWOPSI and SCIRE
programs, perhaps the most
significant curriculum innovations
to come out of the 1960's at
Stanford, may be in the process of
being organizationally imprisoned
and philosophically destroyed.
Already substantially
compromised by the Committee
on Undergraduate Studies, further
changes have been suggested in
the faculty Senate that would
alter the programs beyond
recognition.
The central issue is whether
SWOPSI and SCIRE should be
characterized by broadly based
participatory decision-making on
the part of students and faculty or
by an administrative structure
more stultifying than traditional
academia. If the faculty Senate
opts for the latter this Thursday,
students, who initiated and have
helped maintain the programs,
will be denied an effective role in
the decision-making process.
Students will be getting
shortchanged.
An issue which illustrates the
conflict is the vital question of
who should have the authority to
grant academic credit for SWOPSI

and SCIRE courses. Those who
favor student and faculty control
over the experimental programs
believe that such authority should
rest in the hands of a
student-faculty committee.
Opponents seek to remove such
power from the students and
faculty and place it in the hands
of the Dean of Undergraduate
Studies.
Such controversy may at first
glance appear merely legalistic,
but in education, the maxim that
form influences content is as valid
as it is trite. SWOPSI and SCIRE,
as innovative programs, ought not
be burdened with central
administrative authority that
exceeds that of most departments.
The programs were designed to
be havens from standardized
academia, not adjuncts to it.
Control of these programs by
interested students and faculty
enhances their experimental
nature. This is particularly
important in a prestige University
where academic departments are
allergic to unorthodox views that
may impair their professional
standing.
The record of student
participation on the SWOPSI and
SCIRE policy boards has been
impressive. Professor Arthur
Schawlow, physicist on the
SCIRE policy board, has said that
he is "very impressed by the
seriousness and conscientious
ness" of student members. And
Dean of Undergraduate Studies
James Gibbs told the faculty
Senate last year that the track
record of the programs, with
student participation, was
"excellent."

Not only does student and
faculty control of the program
enhance innovation, but it also
gives the program protection from
pressures on the Dean of
Undergraduate Studies. Realism
demands that we recognize that
the Dean of Undergraduate
Studies is a top-level
administrative officer of the
University. As such, the Dean is
subject to demands of interest
groups, disgruntled alumni, and
external sponsors of University
projects. We know that several
SWOPSI projects have been

controversial, and because of this
it is important to protect them
