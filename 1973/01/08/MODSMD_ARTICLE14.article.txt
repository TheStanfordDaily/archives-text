# Weekly Food Fare From Big Daddy
## 
### DAVE McCULLUM 
Before getting into this week's
recipes, I would like to mention
that we at the faculty club have a
new manager. Mr. Mario Scherrer,
a graduate of the Hotel
Management School of Lausanne
and for many years the Vice
President for Operations for
Lyons Restaurants, has taken over
the management responsibilities
of the club.
There are at least preliminary
indications that the financial
picture of the club is becoming
less bleak, and our new manager
feels that we can establish and
maintain a more secure financial
base.
