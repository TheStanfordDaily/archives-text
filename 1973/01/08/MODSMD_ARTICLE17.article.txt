# Gov. Reagan Vetoes Property Tax Bill
## 
### 
A bill which would have reduced property taxes on the proposed
Frenchman's Terrace low/moderate-income housing project has been
vetoed by Gov. Ronald Reagan.
The bill would have permitted federally-subsidized
low/moderate-income developments such as Frenchman's Terrace to
pay property taxes based on the project's income, excluding federal
grants.
The veto means that such projects, like other property, will
continue to be taxed on the basis of their full cash value.
The exact amoung of the reduction of taxes that the bill would
have provided the Stanford-sponsored Frenchman's Terrace is
unknown. One estimate placed the reduction in taxes to the City of
Palo Alto at between $4,000 and $5,000 per year, which would
indicate that the total reduction would have been several times that.
Reagan vetoed the bill, AB 1744 by Assemblywoman Yvonne
Brathwaite Burke (D—Los Angeles), because it would reduce local
property tax revenues throughout the state by $5 million per year he
said.
The governor also objected to the fact that the bill made a special
exception to the property tax laws for only one class of property,
according to his veto statement issued Dec. 28.
Frenchman's Terrace would be located at the corner of Peter
Coutts and Page Mill Roads, and would contain 225 housing units.
Planning officials fear that their plans for the project might be
jeopardized by a moratorium on federal housing funds. Although no
such moratorium has been officially announced, unconfirmed reports
which are being taken very seriously by planners say that such a fund
cutoff is imminent.
Annexation of the 20-acre site to Palo Alto is currently pending.
