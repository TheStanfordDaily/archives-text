# Workers Pilfer Siberian Candy Plant
## 
### 
MOSCOW (AP) — Workers at
Candy Factory No. 1 in the
central Siberian city of Kemerovo
were routinely frisked at the end
of their shifts to combat petty
pilferage. But they stole the
factory blind anyway.
Great quantities of
confections, as well as eggs, sugar,
butter, condensed milk, brandy
and other liquors used in making
the candy, were regularly
disappearing, Pravda reports.
"You see yourself that our
produce is tasty," factory director
I.V. Cherepanov told Pravda
correspondent V. Prokhorov who
wrote an expose called "The
Sweet Life."
"But how do we keep people
from stealing it? We'll just have to
keep up the struggle."
Cherepanov ordered posters
put up saying "Do not steal." The
factory's trade union and
Communist party committees
held group discussions on the
moral issue of stealing from the
state. Watchmen increased their
vigilance at the factory gate.
The posters and discussions
apparently had little effect. But

the watchmen had some luck.
They caught one young female
worker when about 10 ounces of
chocolates fell out of her bouffant
hairdo. They found she had
regularly smuggled candy out of
the factory in her hair and
brassiere.
A factory driver, Pravda said,
fitted into the radiator of his
truck a spacious compartment
which he used to steal condensed
milk, Madeira wine, molasses and
Jamaica rum. Another man was
caught when he tried to steal a
stick of butter and some
chocolates concealed in a thick
book.
The Communist party
newspaper also told of L.
Khomlyanskaya, a woman shop
chief who kept a safe in her
office, presumably for funds and
records.
One day a watchman asked her
to open the safe and they found
32 boxes of assorted chocolates,
64 chocolate medallions, a
selection of chocolate figurines,
22 pounds of a chocolate candy
called "Tuzik," 15Vfe pounds of
chocolate wafers, 50 eggs and a

big flask of brandy.
Chocolates and brandy are still
very expensive in the Soviet
Union and Khemlyanskaya's
hoard represented a tidy sum.
Locksmith Leonid
Onischchenke kept a refrigerator
in his workshop "for some
unexplained reason," Pravda said.
When watchmen searched the
refrigerator they found 6V2 bottles
of brandy, a great variety of
candies and a big bucket of butter
— all filched from the production

line.
Pravda said Onischchenke's
explanation "was short and
simple": "I took the butter to eat
it, and the brandy to drink."
"Do you think he was tried,
fined or fired?" wrote the Pravda
correspondent. "No, a movement
to defend Onischchenke got under
way at the factory."
The amazed Pravda man said
the chairman of Onischchenke's
union shop "warmly" asked him
at a meeting of workers where he

got the butter and brandy
"allegedly" found in his
workshop.
"I got them illegally,"
Onischchenke replied.
"You're a good fellow,
Loyna," the shop Stewart said.
"You've given an honest answer.
Always be such a noble man."
Onischchenke got off with
probation.
Khomlyanskaya, the lady with
a candy store in her safe, was
transferred to a supply section.
