# Law Prof Criticizes Brennan

### 
Stanford Law Professor William Gould has scored
President Nixon's nomination for Secretary of
Labor, Peter Brennan, calling the union chief "a
veritable Archie Bunker."
Gould claims that, "The essence of the man is
hostility toward equal opportunity employment.
The Secretary of Labor-designate is an antediluvian
when it comes to any question of institutional
reform for apprenticeship programs."
Brennan developed the "New York City Plan"
but Gould points out that it "had no minimum
wage, ran only for one year, and obligated the
unions to admit no black employees into the unions
at any time." All contractors who followed the
White House approved plan were regarded as
automatically in compliance with affirmative action
guidelines set down by the government. But
minority employment in New York City

construction unions is estimated at two percent.
Gould fears that if Brennan's appointment is
confirmed by the Senate after hearings slated for
mid-January, "One can properly assume that a
policy of voluntarism (on equal employment
opportunity) will once again be the signal to avoid
legal obligations."
For the past two years, the Labor Department
has been favoring "hometown plans" which rely on
contractors to make sure that their hiring practices
are fair. Gould fears that the "hometown plan" will
be used exclusively under Brennan, and scores this
approach, claiming that it, ".. .is predicated on the
dubious proposition that the construction unions
and contractors can voluntarily monitor their own
commitments to abide by the law â€” even though
they have been the principle offenders in the past."
