# Judge Drops Franklin Charges
## 
### 
A Federal district judge in San
Francisco Friday dropped charges
against fired English Prof. H. Bruce
Franklin and three others accused of
harboring a Venceremos member who
escaped from the California Institute
for Men at Chino.
Asst. U.S. Attorney General
Richard Bancroft requested the move
during a preliminary examination for
Franklin and the others. Bancroft told
Chief U.S. Magistrate Richard
Goldsmith that the prosecution was
not prepared to proceed with the
hearing and that it would await
indictments by the Federal grand jury
now investigating the escape case.
Franklin and the three others —
Venceremos members Bruce W.
Hobson, Morton Newman and Charles

W. Noble — were arrested by the FBI
on Dec. 19 after escapee Ronald W.
Beaty was captured and confessed,
implicating these four and four others.
Beaty has since pleaded guilty to
murder and lynching charges and has
been sentenced to life imprisonment.
On Oct. 7, a car carrying Beaty and
two unarmed guards was forced off
the road by two other cars bearing two
men and a woman. The ambushers cut
Beaty's shackles and shot both guards,
killing one and seriously wounding the
other.
The four could be rearrested on the
same charges if the grand jury indicts
them. Goldsmith requested that
Franklin and the others be notified
through their attorneys if such
indictments are handed down so that

they may surrender voluntarily rather
than being arrested. Bail for Franklin,
Newman and Hobson ($10,000) and
Noble ($5000) was returned.
Goldsmith rejected a motion by
attorney Charles Garry, who is
representing Franklin, demanding that
the magistrate either proceed with the
preliminary hearing or "forever
foreclose" prosecuting Franklin.
Goldsmith said he could not legally
guarantee further prosecution against
the four on the charges they faced.
Affidavits filed by the FBI based on
interrogation of Beaty after his
recapture allege that he was concealed
on the Midpeninsula and in Arizona
after his escape by the eight people he
implicated.
By avoiding a preliminary
examination for Franklin and the
others, the government has prevented
the disclosure of evidence in the case.
Disclosure would probably reveal the
identity of government informants or
undercover agents.
By concealing evidence and
informants, if any, the FBI may
continue to investigate the case in
behalf of the grand jury without
hindrance.
The FBI may have arrested the four
on warrants, without an indictment, so
it could legally conduct searches
incident to the arrest.

By concealing evidence and
informants, if any, the FBI may
continue to investigate the case in
behalf of the grand jury without
hindrance.
The FBI may have arrested the four
on warrants, without an indictment, so
it could legally conduct searches
incident to the arrest.
A Federal district judge in San
Francisco Friday dropped charges
against fired English Prof. H. Bruce
Franklin and three others accused of
harboring a Venceremos member who
escaped from the California Institute
for Men at Chino.
Asst. U.S. Attorney General
Richard Bancroft requested the move
during a preliminary examination for
Franklin and the others. Bancroft told
Chief U.S. Magistrate Richard
Goldsmith that the prosecution was
not prepared to proceed with the
hearing and that it would await
indictments by the Federal grand jury
now investigating the escape case.
Franklin and the three others —
Venceremos members Bruce W.
Hobson, Morton Newman and Charles

W. Noble — were arrested by the FBI
on Dec. 19 after escapee Ronald W.
Beaty was captured and confessed,
implicating these four and four others.
Beaty has since pleaded guilty to
murder and lynching charges and has
been sentenced to life imprisonment.
On Oct. 7, a car carrying Beaty and
two unarmed guards was forced off
the road by two other cars bearing two
men and a woman. The ambushers cut
Beaty's shackles and shot both guards,
killing one and seriously wounding the
other.
The four could be rearrested on the
same charges if the grand jury indicts
them. Goldsmith requested that
Franklin and the others be notified
through their attorneys if such
indictments are handed down so that

they may surrender voluntarily rather
than being arrested. Bail for Franklin,
Newman and Hobson ($10,000) and
Noble ($5000) was returned.
Goldsmith rejected a motion by
attorney Charles Garry, who is
representing Franklin, demanding that
the magistrate either proceed with the
preliminary hearing or "forever
foreclose" prosecuting Franklin.
Goldsmith said he could not legally
guarantee further prosecution against
the four on the charges they faced.
Affidavits filed by the FBI based on
interrogation of Beaty after his
recapture allege that he was concealed
on the Midpeninsula and in Arizona
after his escape by the eight people he
implicated.
By avoiding a preliminary
examination for Franklin and the
others, the government has prevented
the disclosure of evidence in the case.
Disclosure would probably reveal the
identity of government informants or
undercover agents.
