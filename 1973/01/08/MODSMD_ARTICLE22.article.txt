(Following is the Fall 1972 report of Harvey Hall,
University Ombudsman.)
This quarterly report is submitted to give the Univer
sity community some idea of the kinds of situations,
problems, complaints, inquiries, and suggestions that are
brought to the Office of University Ombudsman by
members of the Stanford community. Even more im
portant perhaps, this is a reminder that the office exists.
If you think we can help you, or steer you to someone
in the University who can, feel free to come to the office
or telephone us.
The Office of the Ombudsman is located at 125
Memorial Court, which is right next to the University
Relations Office, and just in back of the newly reno
vated quarters of the Sociology Department which are'
on the outer Quad looking down Palm Drive. The tele
phone extension in 3682. The office is staffed by a
full-time secretary-assistant and an Ombudsman who is
presumably 60 percent but who in actual fact devotes
close to 100 percent of his time to this assignment.
Jackie Hurd, secretary-assistant, is in the office from
8 a.m. to 12 noon and from 1 to 5 p.m. Monday through
Friday. I am there Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday
from 8 a.m. to 12 noon and from 1 to 5 p.m. and on
Wednesdays and Fridays by appointment.
Incidentally, Jackie Hurd has been a member of the
University community for a long time and is very effec
tive in matters of referral and inquiry.
Background of the Office
For those of you, students and staff, who are new at
Stanford, a little background might be helpful. The
Office of Ombudsman was recommended to the Presi
dent of the University by the Committee of Fifteen, a
Committee composed of faculty, representatives of the
administration, and students. The report was accepted
by the Senate and the President of the University, and
the first Ombudsman was appointed in 1969. He served
for about a year and a half, and his successor served for
one year. I am the third Ombudsman.
The proposal of the Committee of Fifteen was so well
conceived that with certain minor changes it has served
as a charter for Stanford's three Ombudsmen. To quote
from that charter is probably the best way to explain
what the office is.
"Purpose. The Ombudsman's task is to protect the
interests and rights of members of the Stanford
community from injustices or abuses of discretion,
from gross inefficiency, from unnecessary delay
and complication in the administration of univer
sity rules and regulations, and from inconsistency,
unfairness, unresponsiveness, and prejudice in the
individual's experience with university activities.
The Ombudsman exists to receive, examine, and
channel the complaints and grievances of members
of the Stanford community, and to secure expedi
tious and impartial redress.
"Power. The Ombudsman's power rests on his
reputation for fairness, objectivity, tact, and re
spectful concern for the welfare of all members of
the university community and for the well-being
of the university.
"The Ombudsman receives complaints, pursues
inquiries into the issues involved, and makes re
commendations for suitable action. His investi
■' gative powers include access, on a confidential
basis, to all official university records. He may
request an audience with any member of the Stan
ford community, and that person is obliged to
meet with him promptly. His remedial weapons
are persuasion and private or public criticism."
Implicit in all this is the fact that although the
Ombudsman can and should make recommendations in
matters that are brought before him, he does not make
decisions and he has no punitive power. It is also clear
that, with the single exception of being financed by the
President's Office, the Office of the Ombudsman must
be independent of any administrative office of the Uni
versity. Even this early in my tenure, I can testify that
this has been the case at Stanford.
Some preliminary observations
1. Although it is much too early to reach any conclu
sions about the proper way to conduct an Ombudsman's
office, I do have some preliminary observations which 1
should like to report here. To some extent these are
based on my very limited experience but these observa
tions are also influenced by things I have read: particu
larly Herman Doi, the State of Hawaii's first Ombuds
man, has been influential here.
The quick and easy conclusion that an Ombudsman is
a "citizen's advocate" needs to be modified a bit. Doi
has said, "You will find initially that complainants who
come to you believe that your office is there as an
advocate for them. It takes a lot of education to teach
them that you are not there as an advocate, but rather as
an objective person looking at the facts and making an
independent determination as to whether their com
plaint is, or is not, justified." If the complaint is found
to be justified, only then does the Ombudsman become
an advocate for the complainant.
2. One of the most important things an Ombudsman
must do is to address himself expeditiously to whatever
matter is brought to him. Speed is important because
quite often people arrive in the Ombudsman's Office
only after they have bumped around fruitlessly in several
other offices.
Often while a student is here, 1 will make a couple of
phone calls, find someone who will address himself to
the problem and make an appointment then and there.
Relevant information should be obtained firsthand but
not by issuing a series of summonses.
Some matters can be taken care of efficiently over
the telephone, but normally the Ombudsman should go
to the offices of administrative officers and others who
are concerned. They may have records which they need
to consult. A kind of generalized basis for making re
commendations must be found. In academic adversarial
matters 1 find the following questions helpful:
A) Is the policy or practice in question on the whole
reasonable?
B) Was it fairly applied in this case?
C) Is there any basis for an exception to policy in
this case while still maintaining equity with others
affected by the policy?
D) Should this practice be changed?
3. The question of what an Ombudsman should ex
clude from consideration inevitably arises. The only
clearly definable category that we have refused to con
sider is that of complaints brought by anonymous
parties.
We do respect the privacy of individuals who bring
matters to us and will not reveal their names to any

other person unless they authorize us to do so, but we
do now insist that complainants identify themselves to
us. On a couple of occasions we have accepted third
party complaints although this is questionable and not
done by most Ombudsmen.
In general we have not accepted what is clearly a legal
matter, although Cassius Kirk, staff counsel in the Office
of the Vice-President for Business and Finance; George
Gregory, a lawyer in the General Secretary's Office; and
Jim Siena and Jerry Halligan of the President's Office
have been helpful in offering advice. We do have infor
mation at hand as to where to refer students and others
who come to us with problems which require legal
assistance.
A few statistics.
In his annual report for 1970-71, the Ombudsman
noted that a total of 125 persons contacted the Office of
Ombudsman between October and May. In her report
for 1971-72, my immediate predecessor reported 201
cases from September '71 through the middle of May
1972.
This report, covering the period from September
1972 through Dec. 15 (the end of fall quarter) notes
that 126 matters have been brought to the Office of
Ombudsman. Of course classification is always tricky
business; if several people come in regarding the same
matter, this is regarded as one case in the statistics; if
one or more persons bring in several matters at the same
time, this is counted as one case; on the other hand, if an
individual brings in one matter and that is settled and
then he subsequently brings in another matter, that is
counted as a separate case in these statistics. This latter
condition happened only twice.
I am classifying things here as they were classified in
the '71-72 report so that at the end of the year some
kind of crude quantitative comparison of the kinds of
concerns can be obtained. (Here again the tricky busi
ness of classification is a factor; the classifications have
to be arbitrary and some perhaps could go one way or
another; e.g, a student thinks his leave of absence should
be changed to an annulment. There are some esoteric
academic considerations here, but if it is a leave of
absence he gets only a partial refund whereas if it is an
annulment he gets all his money back. Should this be
classified academic or financial? The student wants his
$50 housing deposit refunded, but the Housing Office
finds this inconsistent with their published regulations.
Should this be classified housing or financial?) Our arbi
trary classifications may be different from our prede
cessors'.
The increase in case load is a tribute to my predeces
sors. People do not seek the assistance of an Ombuds
man if they do not know that he exists, or if the feeling
is widespread in the community that not much satisfac
tion is achieved by those who do go there. Too often,
internal review procedures have the effect of silencing
the complainant without satisfying him.
The office has received visibility, and people by and
large have received satisfaction. I think too the Stanford
Daily and Campus Report helped make the office known
by excellent coverage at the beginning of the year. Here
follows a statistical table of the kinds of people served
and the subjects brought to the attention of the office.

Some vignettes.
The Ombudsman is often asked in social situations
and by curious colleagues and friends and students,
"What kinds of things are brought to you?" "What do
you do about them?"
This section of the report is designed to give some
thing of the flavor of what goes on in the Ombudsman's
Office by reporting in vignette form some of the cases in
which we have been involved. They are disguised enough
to protect the anonymity of the individuals involved.
The importance of privacy is deeply embedded in me as
a longtime custodian of students' records. Usually 1
extract and paraphrase my own brief summary of the
matter.
In a few occasions I may quote from letters or
written statements that 1 have received, although most
of the complaints have been lodged verbally. My notes
are largely notes on conversations. In an effort to make
things as easy as possible for people who come here, I
have not made it a practice to require written state
ments.
N0.25. Mr. X came to the office because he was
dissatisfied with the way his financial aid is being
handled. Mr. X came to Stanford in 1971 as a
graduate student in Norwegian. He subsequently
transferred to another department. He had a Cal
State Scholarship but because he is over 30 he is
no longer eligible for that. He has applied for a
federally insured loan at a bank in San Jose. He
says this is approved and will be processed in four
or five weeks. He says Mr. Y has promised him a
$2500 loan but this quarter it is to be applied
totally to tuition-no cash. This is the crux of the
matter. Mr. X needs some cash and thinks that Mr.
Y should advance him some from this loan. He is
registered, having deferred his tuition. He would
prefer to pay his tuition from the bank loan when
that comes.

Follow-up:
There is a misunderstanding involved. Mr. Y
does understand Mr. X's need. He feels that Mr. X
has committed himself to enough University loans
already; a budget for the year for Mr. X was
worked out and a cash grant, half from the depart
ment and half from the Financial Aids Office was
made to Mr. X.
No. 39. Mr. R. was awarded his advanced
degree on Sept. 28. He has just graduated and
thinks that he is entitled to a refund of $50
deposit which he paid on a room in a University
residence. He was supposed to notify by Aug. 1 to
receive a refund. At that time he thought he
simply could not finish his dissertation in time for
the degree to be awarded on Sept. 28. However,
on about Aug. 11, he received an extension until
Aug. 21 during which to complete his thesis. He
then went to the Housing Office on August 11 and
offered to discontinue living there.
There was a man in the Housing Office to
whom he talked at that time. He went back on
Sept. 11 and talked to a regular member of the
staff; I believe he filed a petition at this time but
his original request and offer to move out was
made on Aug. 11. He has petitioned for a refund
of his $50 deposit. He feels that although he gave
the notification as early as he could, his situation
is this: by graduating he was forced to leave the
residence, so in a way the University was keeping
his $50, but he could not live there anyhow. He
wanted my help because he was leaving the area.
Follow-up: Called Mr. Y. Refund had been
authorized.
No. J2O. Mr. X is a graduate student. He thinks
the $50 housing deposit should be refunded unless
there was some damage done, in which case it
would be proper to deduct it from the $50 fee. He
had a room in a University residence; he wanted to
switch; he was told the circumstances under which
his contract could be altered—that he would have
to find a replacement who is not on the waiting
list.
He did find a replacement who is not on the
waiting list and an equitable adjustment was made
on the fall quarter rent. He paid X dollars and his
successor in the room paid Y dollars equalling the
quarter's rent. He does not think that it is proper
for the Housing Office to retain his $50.
Follow-up: After discussion with appropriate
administrative officer, wrote Mr. X and told him
that I could not recommend that he be made an
exception to the established policy.
No. 82. Dr. B called while Ombudsman was out
of town; so she sent copies of letters about her
problem for his return: Her question was "Can the
Ombudsman help me get paid my correct salary?"
The amount for '72-73 on an appointment is more
than the amount given as salary rate on her state
ment of earnings. She wants the difference.
Follow-up: Discussed matter with member of
Provost's staff who in turn talked to associate dean
of the school in question. Adjustment made, as it
would have been anyway in time. Received excel
lent letter from associate dean in question setting
forth all the circumstances.
No. 10. Mr. R was admitted to the Graduate
Division as a major in Swedish in the fall of 1967
under the four years guaranteed assistance pro
gram. In the second year he changed to another
department. His adviser was Professor Y.
Then on Professor Y's advice he went to
Turkey for two years on a Fulbright. Stanford
contributed nothing during these two years. When
he applied for the third of his four years
guaranteed assistance he found that it had to be
used in four consecutive years. After some negotia
tion he was given a third year last year. Now there
is some dispute.
He is told that he was given a third-year's
assistance on his guarantee that he would not
request a fourth-year's assistance. He says that he
never heard of this, never entered into such an
agreement, and does not think he would have at
the time. For further information see exchange of
correspondence and memoranda between Mr. R
and dean in file. Incidentally, dean's office con
tends that two years in Turkey on grant were the
third and fourth years which he was guaranteed.
Follow-up: After considerable negotiation, Mr.
R was given a research assistantship by his depart
ment.
No. 111. Mr. H called to make an appointment
and then came to the office with Mrs. H. Mrs. H
has made repeated efforts with the Personnel
Office to get employment. She made an initial
application on July 28, 1972; she has been back
there Nov. I 5, 22, and 29.
She has made additional applications for a
specific job; nothing happens; she says she has not
been able to have an interview with an employ
ment counselor. She seems well qualified indeed,
and has high aspirations. She is quiet and soft
spoken and really her question is not so much why
hasn't she been hired, but why hasn't she been
told about any jobs?
Follow-up: Made an appointment for her to see
the Director of Personnel the next day. The Direc
tor of Personnel, after talking to her, took her to
the appropriate person on his staff. He reported
that she later expressed herself as being apprecia
tive.
No. 121. Miss B called and objected because a
notary public in the University wanted to charge a
fee for notarizing an absentee ballot. The student
maintained that this was illegal and that it said so
in the instructions accompanying her ballot. I
asked her which state she wished to vote in, and
she said Kansas; I pointed out that the statutes in
California might be different.
Follow-up: I called the Office of the Registrar
of Voters in Santa Clara County to ascertain the
legality of charging a fee. At first a clerk in that
office said it was illegal. When I pressed for details,
I was transferred to talk to the Registrar of Voters.
He quoted from a statute and pointed out that
California itself does not require notarization of its
own absentee ballots; he concluded by saying.
"It's a gray area."

I talked to Mr. X, a legal counsel on the Univer
sity staff. He had an associate, also a lawyer, look
into the matter. She called me back later and said
that the statutes were not clear and that she was
addressing an inquiry to the Secretary of State
concerning the mater.
No. 104. Mr. W asks what the policy is con
cerning employment of men/women equal oppor
tunity so that he can save time in looking for
hourly employment. He called a prospective em
ployer about an ad in the Stanford Daily and was
told that they plan to hire a woman, not a man.
The person on the telephone could give no reason
for the decision.
Mr. W is not sure he can meet the job qualifica
tions but thinks he should be interviewed. It is
possible the job could be handled by either a man
or woman. Is this a case of discrimination? By
knowing the general policy, Mr. W can save time in
his searching.
Follow-up: Checked with the person in the
Office of the Dean of Students Affairs who is in
charge of student employee grievances. She said if
Mr. W wants to pursue the question (and she, too,
is interested) he should get in touch with Miss X
who coordinates student employment on campus
jobs. Miss X checked the matter out. Mr. W was
advised to call Miss X. The agency which listed the
job changed to interviewing candidates of both
sexes.
No. 55. A Ms. W started Stanford unmarried.
She was married before she graduated and at the
time of her marriage her name was changed to Mrs.
C. She wants her name of record to be changed
back to Ms. W because that is now her professional
name. I shall refer the matter to the appropriate
committee.
Follow-up: 1 talked to Mr. X concerning Ms.
Ws name change. He is placing it on the agenda of
the committee. Registrar's Office wrote Ms. W in
part "I am enclosing a grade sheet (unsigned
transcript) showing that we have lined through the
name C and through Mrs. 6-64, replacing the latter
with Ms. 10-72. We shall file your permanent
record (from which transcripts are printed) under
Wand cross index Wand C to this effect."
No. 47. Miss A is a transfer from an Eastern
college. I received a call from Mr. D who said that
Miss A, a cousin of a friend of his, is having a
"miserable housing experience." He has com
plained variously because she has been assigned to
a room with two other girls. One of the other girls
"has a male companion to whom she gives sleep-in
privileges."
I told Mr. D that 1 wasn't sure whether it would
be better for him to get in touch with the person
in charge of housing or whether he would like me
to do so on his behalf. I told him 1 thought in
either event that the person in charge of housing
would be quite responsive to his complaint. He
decided it would be better if he made the call
himself and he expressed his intention to do so.
Follow-up: None.
No. 108. Mr. C took out a leave of absence in
winter quarter '69-70. A year later he got a bill for
$161 for a 4-week leave. Since he had a research
assistantship at the time, he now feels that amount
should be paid for from the research assistantship
and should not be a personal charge to him. He has
talked to the departmental secretary about various
aspects of this matter and also to someone in the
Registrar's Office. That conversation apparently
was to determine the proper amount of the charge
and did not deal with the matter of who should
pay that amount.
Follow-up: (1) Checked in Registrar's Office,
ascertained that Mr. C went into military service or
alternate service at time of leave. This justified
reducing the amount of Mr. C's obligation.
Discussed matter with associate head of Mr. C's
department. Research assistantship had of course
been canceled when Mr. C took his leave.
However, he had been paid his stipend up to the
time of the leave. Associate chairman of the de
partment agreed that it was proper for the depart
ment to pay the amount that was withheld when
Mr. C took his leave.
Two Editorials.
I. First, several members of the University have
brought to the attention of the Ombudsman the prob
lem of dogs running loose in and around Tresidder,
White Memorial Plaza, actually in classes in Dinkelspiel
and in the psychology building, in the lobby of other
buildings, and elsewhere.
A portion of the County ordinance reads, "The
owner, harborer, or keeper of every dog shall keep such
dog confined to his own premises or premises under his
control or shall keep such dog under physical restraint
by means of a leash not to exceed six feet in length."
I believe there is a growing discontent on the part of
members of the University community with the non
enforcement of this ordinance. For example:
No. 72. A research assistant objects to having
dogs brought into classrooms. He finds it a serious
distraction, aside from the other petty nuisances
which may arise from having dogs actually in class
rooms. Large classes, especially, seem to have a
pretty good dog population. The instructors
mention it and for a couple of days they will be
kept out, but then they will be back in class.
No. 85. Mr. K, a member of the staff, is con
cerned about the dog problem on campus. He
came in particularly about dogs in and around
Tresidder, but as we talked, he is also very con
cerned about the problem of dogs in class. They
apparently wander into Dinkelspiel. He says he
knows people who drop dogs off at Tresidder
because they think they will have a pleasanter time
there during the day than they would have at
home.
We discussed the whole matter and while he is
concerned that something be done, as I am, he also
agrees that it would be a good idea to be pretty
sure that the University community at large is
willing to go along with a concerted effort to use
legal means to rid the campus of this nuisance.
