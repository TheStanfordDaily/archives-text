Playing with only three days of practice this season, Stanford's l A'
rugby team rolled over San Jose State 20-7, Saturday afternoon in the
season opener. The 'B' team followed the win with a convincing
shutout of the Spartan's number-two squad, 10-0.
In the first game, the Spartans scored first on a blocked kick, but a
few minutes later Stanford's Joe Martin scored, and the Cards never
trailed after that point. A score by Bill Conway and Chris Spieller's
conversion gave the Cards a 10-4 lead at halftime.
Early in the second half Forrie Martin scored a try for Stanford,
and the Cards shut out the Spartans until late in the game, when SJS
scored on a penalty kick.
Coach Pete Kmetovic singled out back Craig Zaltosky, who turned
in an excellent performance while playing in his first rugby game.
Kmetovic indicated he was "satisfied" with the team's performance
for this early in the season, but added that "our kicking game was way
below par."
Stanford's next game is Saturday, January 13, against the San
Francisco Rugby Club on the Stanford field.
