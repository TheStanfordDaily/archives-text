## SPORTS Cards Outshot In Pullman 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
Washington State took
advantage of Mike Dolven's 28
points and Stanford's frigid
shooting Saturday night as the
Cougars rolled to a 61-49 Pac-8

victory over the Cards in Pullman.
Stanford, bothered by WSU's
collapsing zone defense, resorted
to outside shooting and connected
on only 19 of 72 field goal
attempts for a 26.4 percentage.

Meanwhile, the Cougars shot 49.1
percent from the floor.
The loss put Stanford's record
at 0-1 in Pac-8 play and 5-5
overall, while WSU improved to
1-0 in the league and 4-7 overall.
The Cougars' victory was their
ninth straight win over the Cards
in Pullman.
Hot First Half
Dolven, WSU's 6-9 center,
sparked the Cougars to a 34-29
halftime lead with 20 first half
points. WSU scored the first four
points of the second half to
increase their margin 38-29 and
Stanford never seriously
threatened again.
Dolven finished the game with
28 points and 14 rebounds. Morris
Griffin added 17 points and 11
rebounds for the Cougars and Ben
Krause contributed 10 points.
Dave Frost led the Stanford
scorers with 13 points. Mike Mann
scored 11 and Bob Buell and Rich
Kelley each added 10.
