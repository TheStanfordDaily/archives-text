breastroke, defeated fellow Olympian, senior Brian Job, in the 100
yard breastroke going a 57.9 to the loser's 58.2. Hencken's time tied
the existing pool record which was set by Job last year.
Hencken also scored a victory in the 200 individual medley

the meet to win the 200 breastroke in 2.07.0 to Hencken's 2.09.1.
Job, the American record holder in this event, was only one tenth off
his own pool record.

the old record held by Mark Shelly of 10.01.1 set in 1969. Strong
became a double winner when he came back later to win the 500
