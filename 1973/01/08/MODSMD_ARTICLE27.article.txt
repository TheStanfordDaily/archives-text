# Horpel Wins Trophy
## 
### 
With junior Chris Horpel
leading the way, Stanford's
wrestling team finished fourth
among 14 teams at the Cal
State-Hayward Tournament held
last Saturday.
Horpel not only won the
150-pound weight division, but he
also won a trophy for pinning two
of his three opponents in the
fastest times. He won the
championship match by an 11-0
score, and just missed being
named the outstanding wrestler in
the tourney.
Coach Joe DeMeo was
impressed with the performances
of several of his other athletes,
most notably heavyweight Chris
Westersunt, who finished third.
Westersunt scored falls over two
of his opponents, and lost only to
the eventual champion,
performing better than expected.
177-pounder Mark Davis also
finished third, with Ken Krebs
(142), Mark Feinstein (193), and
Jim Tatarakis (118) all ending up
fourth. Tatarakis might have
placed higher, except that he
dislocated an elbow and will
probably be sidelined for two
weeks.
Cal-Berkeley won the toumey,

with Cal-Poly second, and San
Luis Obispo third, just two and a
half points ahead of the Cardinals.
"We did a good job," said
DeMeo. "We still have a young
team which is improving all the
time."
Stanford had also been
scheduled to take on U.S.I.U.
Friday but won that match by
forfeit when the visitors' car
broke down.
This weekend, however, the
team has two interesting matches
scheduled at home. Friday,
Nebraska (Omaha), the NAIA's
best team, and Cal
State-Bakersfield visit Encina
Gym at 7:30 p.m. in what should
be an interesting double-dual
meet.
Saturday the Cards host Cal
State-Hayward beginning at 7
p.m.
