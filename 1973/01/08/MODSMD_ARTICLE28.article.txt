# Freshman Rally Falls Short
## 
### MARK WHITE 
Despite a furious second half
rally in which they scored 16
i straight points, the Stanford fresh
man basketball team fell to the
San Jose State Spartans last
Friday evening, 80-76.
It wasn't until the 17-minute
mark in the second half that the
Cardinals came close to making
the game a contest. Throughout
the first half, poor ball handling
and a porous defense had kept
Stanford behind by margins of
between five and 14 points.
Steve Kristovich's shot in the
opening minutes of the game put
Stanford in the lead for the first
of two times, 2-1. After that, the
Cards set the tone for the first
half by throwing away the ball
three times in a row, and with
each turnover leading to a Spartan
basket, they trailed 7-2.
State's top guard, Ken Mickey,
ran the Spartan's offense well,
keeping the Cards down by
spreads of between five and seven
points. Two fast break baskets by
Rich Wohlstadter and Kristovich
brought Stanford back to within
three at the 8:30 mark, but two
quick bombs by San Jose's other
guard, Ken Hartsough, put San
Jose out in front 25-18.

Four minutes later, crisp
passing and good offensive
movement propelled the Spartans
to eight straight points and a lead
of 41-29. A combination of a
good Spartan defense and a Card
tendency to bunch up in the same
area of the court forced Stanford
to take poor shots and be out of
position for rebounds. Ed
Schweitzer was the only Card
hitting the boards with regularity
and as the first half ended, San
Jose had outhustled Stanford for
a 47-33 lead.
Interim frosh coach Bob
Nicholson, who is subbing for Bill
Jones while he scouts USC and
UCLA for the varsity, must have
sparked the players with a
halftime pep talk. The Cards
opened the second half with a
flurry and outscored State 20-6 in
the first eight minutes of the
period.
Schweitzer led the offensive
charge with 14 points during the
rally. For the first time in the
game, Stanford moved the ball
well, getting it in to t-chweitzer
for close shots.

As soon as Schweitzer had tied
the game at 53-53 with his 22nd
point of the evening, SJS forward

Ronnie Fair came in to snap the
Spartans out of their lethargy.
Scoring a quick basket, Fair
brought SJS to life and the two
teams exchanged baskets until
Kevin Enright capped a five point
Stanford spurt that gave the Cards
their second lead of the game at
the 5:19 mark, 68-67.
Tliis proved to be the Card's
high water mark for the game.
Following Enright's basket, the
Spartans called a time out and
returned to the floor to score two
quick points, putting them back
into the lead. The Cards then
reverted to their first half form,

throwing away the ball and failing
to penetrate State's switching
defense.
When the Spartan's Mickey
completed a three-point play at
the 4:15 mark, SJS led by five
and forced Stanford to play catch
up. The Cards tried desperately to
make up the difference, but an
inability to get the ball inside to
Schweitzer and State's late game
ball control tactics gave the
contest to SJS. Marty Moroski's
basket at the buzzer made the
final score 80-76.
Schweitzer led all scorers with
26 points and 13 rebounds.
Moroski scored 12, for the Cards,
Wholstadter scored 11 and
Kristovich, Peters, Enright,
Rompel and Whiting all
contributed to the cause.

quick bombs by San Jose's other
guard, Ken Hartsough, put San
Jose out in front 25-18.

Four minutes later, crisp
passing and good offensive
movement propelled the Spartans
to eight straight points and a lead
of 41-29. A combination of a
good Spartan defense and a Card
tendency to bunch up in the same
area of the court forced Stanford
to take poor shots and be out of
position for rebounds. Ed
Schweitzer was the only Card
hitting the boards with regularity
and as the first half ended, San
Jose had outhustled Stanford for
a 47-33 lead.
Interim frosh coach Bob
Nicholson, who is subbing for Bill
Jones while he scouts USC and
UCLA for the varsity, must have
sparked the players with a
halftime pep talk. The Cards
opened the second half with a
flurry and outscored State 20-6 in
the first eight minutes of the
period.
Schweitzer led the offensive
charge with 14 points during the
rally. For the first time in the
game, Stanford moved the ball
well, getting it in to t-chweitzer
for close shots.
Schweitzer Scores
As soon as Schweitzer had tied
the game at 53-53 with his 22nd
point of the evening, SJS forward

Ronnie Fair came in to snap the
Spartans out of their lethargy.
Scoring a quick basket, Fair
brought SJS to life and the two
teams exchanged baskets until
Kevin Enright capped a five point
Stanford spurt that gave the Cards
their second lead of the game at
the 5:19 mark, 68-67.
Tliis proved to be the Card's
high water mark for the game.
Following Enright's basket, the
Spartans called a time out and
returned to the floor to score two
quick points, putting them back
into the lead. The Cards then
reverted to their first half form,

throwing away the ball and failing
to penetrate State's switching
defense.
When the Spartan's Mickey
completed a three-point play at
the 4:15 mark, SJS led by five
and forced Stanford to play catch
up. The Cards tried desperately to
make up the difference, but an
inability to get the ball inside to
Schweitzer and State's late game
ball control tactics gave the
contest to SJS. Marty Moroski's
basket at the buzzer made the
final score 80-76.
Schweitzer led all scorers with
26 points and 13 rebounds.
Moroski scored 12, for the Cards,
Wholstadter scored 11 and
Kristovich, Peters, Enright,
Rompel and Whiting all
contributed to the cause.
Despite a furious second half
rally in which they scored 16
i straight points, the Stanford fresh
man basketball team fell to the
San Jose State Spartans last
Friday evening, 80-76.
It wasn't until the 17-minute
mark in the second half that the
Cardinals came close to making
the game a contest. Throughout
the first half, poor ball handling
and a porous defense had kept
Stanford behind by margins of
between five and 14 points.
Steve Kristovich's shot in the
opening minutes of the game put
Stanford in the lead for the first
of two times, 2-1. After that, the
Cards set the tone for the first
half by throwing away the ball
three times in a row, and with
each turnover leading to a Spartan
basket, they trailed 7-2.
State's top guard, Ken Mickey,
ran the Spartan's offense well,
keeping the Cards down by
spreads of between five and seven
points. Two fast break baskets by
Rich Wohlstadter and Kristovich
brought Stanford back to within
three at the 8:30 mark, but two
quick bombs by San Jose's other
guard, Ken Hartsough, put San
Jose out in front 25-18.
