# Lyman Speaks Before Faculty; Praises SWOPSI And SCIRE
## 
### MARK SIMONIAN 
University President Richard W.
Lyman praised the embattled SWOPSI
and SCIRE programs as "valuable
opportunities for intellectual inquiry"
in his President's report last Friday
before the winter quarter meeting of
the Academic Council.
Lyman also called for additional
guidance for students, particularly
during their early undergraduate years,
and examined the evaluation of
teaching, including student insistence
on teaching quality.
During the question-and-answer
period following his address, Lyman
denied accusations from French and
Italian Department Chairman
Raymond Giraud that the University
has attempted to make alterations in
faculty contract agreements through

its latest motion in the trial of fired
English Prof. H. Bruce Franklin.
In his first speech since returning to
Stanford from a "mini-sabbatical" in
London, Lyman acknowledged the
difficulties in undergraduate education
by pointing to the problem of balance
between relevance and academic value
in the baccalaureate curriculum.
New Course Requirements Advocated
Discussing the "ground-clearing" of
University-wide course requirements
three years ago, Lyman noted, "What I
hear a growing number of people
suggesting now is that perhaps we've
done too good a job. Perhaps some
reforestation is in order, lest the bare
topsoil of infinite, unguided choice
invite erosion and duststorms in
which . . . too many students may be
rejecting intellectual inquiry

inadvertently."
The President commended SWOPSI
and SCIRE as desirable challenges to
the academic departments and
reaffirmed his commitment to
flexible study programs for
undergrads.
"Nothing in what I'm saying should
be misinterpreted as calling for a
simple return to a prescription in the
curriculum, still less for any retreat
from individual and independent study
and research by undergraduates. Of
the latter, it seems to me we have still
too little," Lyman stated.
"What I am saying is that even
though the curricular cafeteria may be
here to stay, we can and should pay
more heed to the legibility,
conspicuousness, and authenticity of
the menu."
'Intellectual Nutrition'
"And we should perhaps ask
ourselves whether it's good enough
just to make sure that each student has
his or her individual dietary
consultant, the adviser, without some
coherent effort at constructing sets of
alternative examples of good
intellectual nutrition," he remarked.
Lyman also raised the issue of the
quality of education the students
receive at Stanford by asking, "What
are we doing, what are we going to do,
to make it seem sensible for a bright
potential student to elect to come to
Stanford instead of the University of
California or California State
University at San Jose, when the
differences in this year's tuition are
$2,250 and $2,682, respectively?"
He added, "the so-called clients'
revolution is not going to go away, and
student insistence on teaching quality

is and should be seen as a healthy sign
and responded to."
Yet the president cautioned against
"student popularity contests"
governing faculty appointments and
having only students evaluate their
teachers.
Scholars' Judgments Wanted
"In discussing this with nontenured
faculty members last spring, I found
that some were very wary of having
only student judgments taken. They
wanted knowledgeable scholars to
evaluate such things as the overall
organization of the course, the depth
and appropriateness of the reading
lists, and so forth," he said.
Following his report, Lyman was
questioned by Giraud as to the
President's position on the University's
latest motion in the H. Bruce Franklin
case.
"We understand that the University
has responded to Prof. Franklin's and
the ACLU's suit with a motion for
summary judgment by the court to
dismiss the case without its being
tried. That argument seems to be that,
because Prof. Franklin received a
hearing before the Advisory Board, the
terms of his contract — a contract we
all have — were fulfilled and he
therefore has no right to take his case
to court. How do you justify this
position?" Giraud asked.
Lyman answered saying that all
faculty members have the right to a
redress of grievances after they have
exhausted appeals from the University.
He also suggested that the motion
served merely as a procedural
maneuver to have the court ban the
admission of further testimony or
additional legal briefs.

are we doing, what are we going to do,
to make it seem sensible for a bright
potential student to elect to come to
Stanford instead of the University of
California or California State
University at San Jose, when the
differences in this year's tuition are
$2,250 and $2,682, respectively?"
He added, "the so-called clients'
revolution is not going to go away, and
student insistence on teaching quality

is and should be seen as a healthy sign
and responded to."
Yet the president cautioned against
"student popularity contests"
governing faculty appointments and
having only students evaluate their
teachers.
Scholars' Judgments Wanted
"In discussing this with nontenured
faculty members last spring, I found
that some were very wary of having
only student judgments taken. They
wanted knowledgeable scholars to
evaluate such things as the overall
organization of the course, the depth
and appropriateness of the reading
lists, and so forth," he said.
Following his report, Lyman was
questioned by Giraud as to the
President's position on the University's
latest motion in the H. Bruce Franklin
case.
"We understand that the University
has responded to Prof. Franklin's and
the ACLU's suit with a motion for
summary judgment by the court to
dismiss the case without its being
tried. That argument seems to be that,
because Prof. Franklin received a
hearing before the Advisory Board, the
terms of his contract — a contract we
all have — were fulfilled and he
therefore has no right to take his case
to court. How do you justify this
position?" Giraud asked.
Lyman answered saying that all
faculty members have the right to a
redress of grievances after they have
exhausted appeals from the University.
He also suggested that the motion
served merely as a procedural
maneuver to have the court ban the
admission of further testimony or
additional legal briefs.
University President Richard W.
Lyman praised the embattled SWOPSI
and SCIRE programs as "valuable
opportunities for intellectual inquiry"
in his President's report last Friday
before the winter quarter meeting of
the Academic Council.
Lyman also called for additional
guidance for students, particularly
during their early undergraduate years,
and examined the evaluation of
teaching, including student insistence
on teaching quality.
During the question-and-answer
period following his address, Lyman
denied accusations from French and
Italian Department Chairman
Raymond Giraud that the University
has attempted to make alterations in
faculty contract agreements through

its latest motion in the trial of fired
English Prof. H. Bruce Franklin.
In his first speech since returning to
Stanford from a "mini-sabbatical" in
London, Lyman acknowledged the
difficulties in undergraduate education
by pointing to the problem of balance
between relevance and academic value
in the baccalaureate curriculum.
New Course Requirements Advocated
Discussing the "ground-clearing" of
University-wide course requirements
three years ago, Lyman noted, "What I
hear a growing number of people
suggesting now is that perhaps we've
done too good a job. Perhaps some
reforestation is in order, lest the bare
topsoil of infinite, unguided choice
invite erosion and duststorms in
which . . . too many students may be
rejecting intellectual inquiry

inadvertently."
The President commended SWOPSI
and SCIRE as desirable challenges to
the academic departments and
reaffirmed his commitment to
flexible study programs for
undergrads.
"Nothing in what I'm saying should
be misinterpreted as calling for a
simple return to a prescription in the
curriculum, still less for any retreat
from individual and independent study
and research by undergraduates. Of
the latter, it seems to me we have still
too little," Lyman stated.
"What I am saying is that even
though the curricular cafeteria may be
here to stay, we can and should pay
more heed to the legibility,
conspicuousness, and authenticity of
the menu."
'Intellectual Nutrition'
"And we should perhaps ask
ourselves whether it's good enough
just to make sure that each student has
his or her individual dietary
consultant, the adviser, without some
coherent effort at constructing sets of
alternative examples of good
intellectual nutrition," he remarked.
Lyman also raised the issue of the
quality of education the students
receive at Stanford by asking, "What
are we doing, what are we going to do,
to make it seem sensible for a bright
potential student to elect to come to
Stanford instead of the University of
