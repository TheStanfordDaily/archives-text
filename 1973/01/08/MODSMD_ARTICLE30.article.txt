Kissinger Returns To Paris
PARIS — Henry A. Kissinger arrived last night for a new
round of secret Vietnam peace talks, saying President
Nixon "has sent me back to Paris to make one more major
effort to conclude the negotiations."
"We expect that the talks this time will be serious and
worthy of the yearning of people all over the world for an
early end of the war," the U.S. presidential adviser told
newsmen.
"As far as the United States is concerned, we shall
dedicate ourselves to this effort with patience, good will
and hope," he said.
His first meeting with Le Due Tho, Hanoi's chief
negotiator, was scheduled for this morning in a villa
owned by the French Communist party in suburban Gif
Sur Yvette.
Tho said on arrival in Paris Saturday: "Now the
decisive moment has come: either to rapidly settle
peacefully the Vietnam problem and sign the agreed
accord or to continue the war."
Privately, administration sources portray Nixon as
determined to stiffen the nine-point draft to a point
where he thinks it will serve as a basis for a long-term
peace and not just a temporary truce likely to break down
soon after a U.S. pullout from Vietnam.
This would include some commitment by Hanoi that it
will not try to impose its will on South Vietnam by force
and provision for an international cease-fire supervisory
force far stronger than the toothless 250-man contingent
proposed by North Vietnam.
Nixon told the congressional leaders he wants three
elements in a pact — "the return of American prisoners of
war, a cease-fire in Vietnam, and an agreement to allow all
parties in South Vietnam to determine their future."
North Viets Shell Da Nang
SAIGON — Communist-led forces shelled the big allied air
base at Da Nang in a rare daylight attack today, setting
gasoline tanks afire and wounding five Americans and one
Vietnamese, military spokesmen said.
In the air war, U.S. 852 bombers blasted supply routes
in the southern part of North Vietnam, but Hanoi said
huge volumes of war materials were still getting through.
A spokesman for the U.S. Command said an unknown
number of shells — either rockets or mortars — hit the Da
Nang base about 8:20 a.m. Saigon time. He said five U.S.
servicemen were wounded in the shelling and a sixth
American serviceman and one civilian were injured while
running for cover. One U.S. helicopter was damaged.
852s saturated highways, rivers and canals in southern
North Vietnam with more than 1000 tons of explosives
Saturday and Sunday in a campaign to stop war supplies
from reaching South Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia.
The U.S. Command announced the loss of the 32nd
American plane in three weeks, raising to 99 the toll of
airmen killed, captured and missing in that period.
The Command said a Navy A 7 Corsair attack bomber
developed mechanical trouble and crashed into the sea
Saturday morning shortly after taking off for a mission
from the carrier Midway. The pilot, its only occupant, was
killed, the command reported.

Marcos Postpones Plebiscite
MANILA — President Ferdinand E. Marcos postponed
yesterday next week's plebescite on a new Philippines
constitution and suspended free press and radio debate
over the charter.
He said the nation is slipping back to old bad habits he
sought to erase by proclaiming martial law in September.
Marcos acted as police announced they had crushed a
Maoist plot to assassinate the president, his wife and other
leaders and had killed two and arrested 30 Communist
officials, seizing firearms and subversive literature.
Brig. Gen. Fidel Ramos, chief of the Philippine
Constabulary, said the alleged plot to liquidate
government leaders with sniper fire and explosives was
discovered after police Dec. 26 raided a Communist
Central Committee meeting in nearby Quezon City, killing
two members of the Maoist New Peoples Army.
This was followed, he said, by the arrest of 30
Communist functionaries including a central committee
and politbureau member. Ramos did not identify them.
Marcos revoked a December directive allowing free
debate in the Philippine media on the proposed new
constitution. He said the plebiscite itself set for Jan. 15,
would be "suspended" to await completion this month of
"national consultations" in some 32,000 citizens'
assemblies.
Some 20 million out of 38 million Filipinos are being
asked in these public assemblies led by local leaders to
signal their approval of Marcos' martial law policies.
Arkansas Oil Slick Spreads
HELENA, Ark. — A massive oil slick threatened wildlife
and posed some danger to water supplies in downstream
Mississippi River communities yesterday as three barges —
one pinned to a bridge pier — continued to dump fuel oil
into the river.
Meanwhile, worsening weather conditions forced a halt
to clean-up attempts and to an active search for two
crewmen missing since four barges broke loose Friday
from a towboat.
Authorities said a swift current sped the barges, each
loaded with 800,000 gallons of diesel fuel, down the river
toward the Helena bridge. One slammed into a bridge
support, forcing it into a U-shape around the pier. They
said that barge probably had emptied itself of the oil.
Two of the three other barges that crunched into the
bridge were towed to docking facilities about four miles
upstream yesterday to empty their oil into shore tanks.
The third barge had become partially submerged
against the river bank after much of its oil leaked into the
river. Authorities said an attempt would be made to pump
it out and refloat it so it, too, could be towed upstream
and secured to the dock.
Today's Weather
Rain likely beginning today and continuing on and off
through tomorrow. Warming trend. Low temperatures
tonight in the upper 40s or low 50s. High today and
tomorrow in the 50s. Light winds becoming south-east 15
to 30 mph today.

This was followed, he said, by the arrest of 30
Communist functionaries including a central committee
and politbureau member. Ramos did not identify them.
Marcos revoked a December directive allowing free
debate in the Philippine media on the proposed new
constitution. He said the plebiscite itself set for Jan. 15,
would be "suspended" to await completion this month of
"national consultations" in some 32,000 citizens'
assemblies.
Some 20 million out of 38 million Filipinos are being
asked in these public assemblies led by local leaders to
signal their approval of Marcos' martial law policies.
Arkansas Oil Slick Spreads
HELENA, Ark. — A massive oil slick threatened wildlife
and posed some danger to water supplies in downstream
Mississippi River communities yesterday as three barges —
one pinned to a bridge pier — continued to dump fuel oil
into the river.
Meanwhile, worsening weather conditions forced a halt
to clean-up attempts and to an active search for two
crewmen missing since four barges broke loose Friday
from a towboat.
Authorities said a swift current sped the barges, each
loaded with 800,000 gallons of diesel fuel, down the river
toward the Helena bridge. One slammed into a bridge
support, forcing it into a U-shape around the pier. They
said that barge probably had emptied itself of the oil.
Two of the three other barges that crunched into the
bridge were towed to docking facilities about four miles
upstream yesterday to empty their oil into shore tanks.
The third barge had become partially submerged
against the river bank after much of its oil leaked into the
river. Authorities said an attempt would be made to pump
it out and refloat it so it, too, could be towed upstream
and secured to the dock.
Today's Weather
Rain likely beginning today and continuing on and off
through tomorrow. Warming trend. Low temperatures
tonight in the upper 40s or low 50s. High today and
tomorrow in the 50s. Light winds becoming south-east 15
to 30 mph today.
Kissinger Returns To Paris
PARIS — Henry A. Kissinger arrived last night for a new
round of secret Vietnam peace talks, saying President
Nixon "has sent me back to Paris to make one more major
effort to conclude the negotiations."
"We expect that the talks this time will be serious and
worthy of the yearning of people all over the world for an
early end of the war," the U.S. presidential adviser told
newsmen.
"As far as the United States is concerned, we shall
dedicate ourselves to this effort with patience, good will
and hope," he said.
His first meeting with Le Due Tho, Hanoi's chief
negotiator, was scheduled for this morning in a villa
owned by the French Communist party in suburban Gif
Sur Yvette.
Tho said on arrival in Paris Saturday: "Now the
decisive moment has come: either to rapidly settle
peacefully the Vietnam problem and sign the agreed
accord or to continue the war."
Privately, administration sources portray Nixon as
determined to stiffen the nine-point draft to a point
where he thinks it will serve as a basis for a long-term
peace and not just a temporary truce likely to break down
soon after a U.S. pullout from Vietnam.
This would include some commitment by Hanoi that it
will not try to impose its will on South Vietnam by force
and provision for an international cease-fire supervisory
force far stronger than the toothless 250-man contingent
proposed by North Vietnam.
Nixon told the congressional leaders he wants three
elements in a pact — "the return of American prisoners of
war, a cease-fire in Vietnam, and an agreement to allow all
parties in South Vietnam to determine their future."
North Viets Shell Da Nang
SAIGON — Communist-led forces shelled the big allied air
base at Da Nang in a rare daylight attack today, setting
gasoline tanks afire and wounding five Americans and one
Vietnamese, military spokesmen said.
In the air war, U.S. 852 bombers blasted supply routes
in the southern part of North Vietnam, but Hanoi said
huge volumes of war materials were still getting through.
A spokesman for the U.S. Command said an unknown
number of shells — either rockets or mortars — hit the Da
Nang base about 8:20 a.m. Saigon time. He said five U.S.
servicemen were wounded in the shelling and a sixth
American serviceman and one civilian were injured while
running for cover. One U.S. helicopter was damaged.
852s saturated highways, rivers and canals in southern
North Vietnam with more than 1000 tons of explosives
Saturday and Sunday in a campaign to stop war supplies
from reaching South Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia.
The U.S. Command announced the loss of the 32nd
American plane in three weeks, raising to 99 the toll of
airmen killed, captured and missing in that period.
The Command said a Navy A 7 Corsair attack bomber
developed mechanical trouble and crashed into the sea
Saturday morning shortly after taking off for a mission
from the carrier Midway. The pilot, its only occupant, was
killed, the command reported.

Marcos Postpones Plebiscite
MANILA — President Ferdinand E. Marcos postponed
yesterday next week's plebescite on a new Philippines
constitution and suspended free press and radio debate
over the charter.
He said the nation is slipping back to old bad habits he
sought to erase by proclaiming martial law in September.
Marcos acted as police announced they had crushed a
Maoist plot to assassinate the president, his wife and other
leaders and had killed two and arrested 30 Communist
officials, seizing firearms and subversive literature.
Brig. Gen. Fidel Ramos, chief of the Philippine
Constabulary, said the alleged plot to liquidate
government leaders with sniper fire and explosives was
discovered after police Dec. 26 raided a Communist
Central Committee meeting in nearby Quezon City, killing
two members of the Maoist New Peoples Army.

gasoline tanks afire and wounding five Americans and one
Vietnamese, military spokesmen said.
In the air war, U.S. 852 bombers blasted supply routes
in the southern part of North Vietnam, but Hanoi said
huge volumes of war materials were still getting through.
A spokesman for the U.S. Command said an unknown
number of shells — either rockets or mortars — hit the Da
Nang base about 8:20 a.m. Saigon time. He said five U.S.
servicemen were wounded in the shelling and a sixth
American serviceman and one civilian were injured while
running for cover. One U.S. helicopter was damaged.
852s saturated highways, rivers and canals in southern
North Vietnam with more than 1000 tons of explosives
Saturday and Sunday in a campaign to stop war supplies
from reaching South Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia.
The U.S. Command announced the loss of the 32nd
American plane in three weeks, raising to 99 the toll of
airmen killed, captured and missing in that period.
The Command said a Navy A 7 Corsair attack bomber
developed mechanical trouble and crashed into the sea
Saturday morning shortly after taking off for a mission
from the carrier Midway. The pilot, its only occupant, was
killed, the command reported.

Marcos Postpones Plebiscite
MANILA — President Ferdinand E. Marcos postponed
yesterday next week's plebescite on a new Philippines
constitution and suspended free press and radio debate
over the charter.
He said the nation is slipping back to old bad habits he
sought to erase by proclaiming martial law in September.
Marcos acted as police announced they had crushed a
Maoist plot to assassinate the president, his wife and other
leaders and had killed two and arrested 30 Communist
officials, seizing firearms and subversive literature.
Brig. Gen. Fidel Ramos, chief of the Philippine
Constabulary, said the alleged plot to liquidate
government leaders with sniper fire and explosives was
discovered after police Dec. 26 raided a Communist
Central Committee meeting in nearby Quezon City, killing
two members of the Maoist New Peoples Army.
This was followed, he said, by the arrest of 30
Communist functionaries including a central committee
and politbureau member. Ramos did not identify them.
Marcos revoked a December directive allowing free
debate in the Philippine media on the proposed new
constitution. He said the plebiscite itself set for Jan. 15,
would be "suspended" to await completion this month of
"national consultations" in some 32,000 citizens'
assemblies.
Some 20 million out of 38 million Filipinos are being
asked in these public assemblies led by local leaders to
signal their approval of Marcos' martial law policies.
Arkansas Oil Slick Spreads
HELENA, Ark. — A massive oil slick threatened wildlife
and posed some danger to water supplies in downstream
Mississippi River communities yesterday as three barges —
one pinned to a bridge pier — continued to dump fuel oil
into the river.
Meanwhile, worsening weather conditions forced a halt
to clean-up attempts and to an active search for two
crewmen missing since four barges broke loose Friday
from a towboat.
Authorities said a swift current sped the barges, each
loaded with 800,000 gallons of diesel fuel, down the river
toward the Helena bridge. One slammed into a bridge
support, forcing it into a U-shape around the pier. They
said that barge probably had emptied itself of the oil.
Two of the three other barges that crunched into the
bridge were towed to docking facilities about four miles
upstream yesterday to empty their oil into shore tanks.
The third barge had become partially submerged
against the river bank after much of its oil leaked into the
river. Authorities said an attempt would be made to pump
it out and refloat it so it, too, could be towed upstream
and secured to the dock.
Today's Weather
Rain likely beginning today and continuing on and off
through tomorrow. Warming trend. Low temperatures
tonight in the upper 40s or low 50s. High today and
tomorrow in the 50s. Light winds becoming south-east 15
to 30 mph today.
Kissinger Returns To Paris
PARIS — Henry A. Kissinger arrived last night for a new
round of secret Vietnam peace talks, saying President
Nixon "has sent me back to Paris to make one more major
effort to conclude the negotiations."
"We expect that the talks this time will be serious and
worthy of the yearning of people all over the world for an
early end of the war," the U.S. presidential adviser told
newsmen.
"As far as the United States is concerned, we shall
dedicate ourselves to this effort with patience, good will
and hope," he said.
His first meeting with Le Due Tho, Hanoi's chief
negotiator, was scheduled for this morning in a villa
owned by the French Communist party in suburban Gif
Sur Yvette.
Tho said on arrival in Paris Saturday: "Now the
decisive moment has come: either to rapidly settle
peacefully the Vietnam problem and sign the agreed
accord or to continue the war."
Privately, administration sources portray Nixon as
determined to stiffen the nine-point draft to a point
where he thinks it will serve as a basis for a long-term
peace and not just a temporary truce likely to break down
soon after a U.S. pullout from Vietnam.
This would include some commitment by Hanoi that it
will not try to impose its will on South Vietnam by force
and provision for an international cease-fire supervisory
force far stronger than the toothless 250-man contingent
proposed by North Vietnam.
Nixon told the congressional leaders he wants three
elements in a pact — "the return of American prisoners of
war, a cease-fire in Vietnam, and an agreement to allow all
parties in South Vietnam to determine their future."
