# Franklin Hearing Date Reset; University Asks For Dismissal
## 
### JAMES LOBSENZ 
A tentative hearing date for the
University's motion for summary
dismissal of fired Prof. H. Bruce
Franklin's suit asking his reinstatement
has been set for Jan. 19.
However, several previous hearing
dates have been set and postponed by
mutual consent and it is not certain
that the hearing will take place on that
date.
Franklin, represented by attorneys
of the American Civil Liberties Union
(ACLU), filed suit against the
University last Aug. 15, charging that
his dismissal was the result of
"political action and political activity"
which are "affirmatively protected by
the guarantees of freedom of speech
and assembly" of the U.S. and
California constitutions.
The University filed a motion for
summary dismissal of the suit on Oct.
26 on the grounds that Franklin's case
has "no merit" and involves "no
triable issue of fact."

Franklin's attorneys then filed a
response to the motion for dismissal.
The University is presently preparing a
reply to their response.
Franklin, who terms the summary
dismissal motion "amazing," says the
contention that the case has no triable
issue of fact is "frivolous," and that
the University's motion for summary
dismissal argues, in effect, "that the
First Ammendment doesn't apply to
Stanford."
Franklin's attorneys argue that the
official reasons given for Franklin's
dismissal (substantial and manifest
neglect of duty, or personal conduct
substantially impairing the individual's
performance within the University
community) do not apply to his
actions.
Advisory Board Ruling
University lawyers maintain that
the Advisory Board, which voted 5-2
on Jan. 22 of last year to dismiss
Franklin, agreed that "it would
measure Mr. Franklin's action and
activity by the same constitutional

standards as he would obtain were he a
member of the faculty of a state
university, and it applied those rules to
his case." Mr. Franklin was not
dismissed for actions safeguarded by
constitutional provisions, they argue.
Franklin also contends that the
Advisory Board was not a body
entitled to make a binding arbitration.
"The Advisory Board's decision was,
as its name implies, purely advisory,"
maintains Franklin. "The University
cannot say that the Board's decision
constituted legal arbitration or that I
am not entitled to legal arbitration."
University attorneys hold that
Franklin agreed to abide by the
decision of the Board, but Franklin
claims that he never agreed to do so.
Objects To Testimony
Franklin says he objected to the
hearing before the Advisory Board
because the testimony given before the
Board was not given under oath
although he requested that it should
be. "We caught their witnesses lying,"
claims Franklin, "but there was
nothing that we could do about it."
Franklin also says that he objected
to the Advisory Board hearing because
he did not have the power of
subpoenaing witnesses.
Neither University attorney Gary
H. Moore nor Legal Adviser to the
University President James V. Siena
wished to comment on the substance
of the University's reply to the
ACLU's response to their motion for
summary dismissal at the present.
