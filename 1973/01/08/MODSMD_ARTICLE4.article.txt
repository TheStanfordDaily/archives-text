# New Orleans Hotel Battle
## Snipers Slay 10 From Roof 
### 
NEW ORLEANS (AP) — Three heavily armed unidentified
snipers killed 10 persons and wounded at least 11 others
during a daylong battle with about 500 officers at a
downtown hotel yesterday, police said.
Police in an armored helicopter finally killed one sniper
last night, but two others remained holed up in a
bunker-like concrete enclosure on the hotel roof, officials
said.
There had been confusion most of the day about how
many riflemen — all of them apparently deadly accurate
shooters — police were battling.
At times police indicated there were as many as five, at
other times only one. The motive for the tragedy was not
known.
As darkness fell over the 18-story Howard Johnson
Hotel — across the street from the city's civic center — a
Marine helicopter was used to hover a team of police
marksmen over the building.
The chopper, its floodlights bathing the roof in light,
drew fire from the snipers on its first two trips and
responded each time by pouring hundreds of rounds from
automatic weapons into the enclosure.
On the third pass, one of the snipers burst out of the
only door of the enclosure and was cut down by police as
he ran a zig-zag pattern across the roof.
"He is laying there spread out dead, but there is
another one still in that little block house," said one of
the marksmen, who declined to identify himself.
Other officers watching from nearby buildings reported
two gunmen would run from the block house and fire at
the helicopter each time it pulled away. But, those police
said they could not fire at the snipers for fear of hitting
innocent people in other buildings beyond the hotel. ,

Fires, apparently set by the snipers, first drew firemen
and police to the hotel before noon. Firemen were able to
control the fires by midafternoon, despite harassment
from the gunmen.
However, it was still undetermined 12 hours after the
ordeal began how many of the victims were killed by
gunfire and whether any died as a result of the fires.
At least three died of gunshot wounds. Six of the other
seven unidentified victims were found on the top floor of
the hotel where the fire was most serious. Most of the
sniper fire also had come from the upper floors.
At least nine of the 11 known injured were suffering
from gunshot wounds, some of them critically.
Yesterday's sniping incident was the latest in a series of
fire and shooting tragedies that have claimed lives here.
Officials at the scene of the slayings were too occupied
to discuss similarities, but said there were "indications" of
a possible connection.
—The snipers at the Downtown Howard Johnson Hotel
struck one week after another shooting in which a young
police cadet was felled by an unseen gunman as he waited
to go on duty.
—Five persons died as a result of a fire in the Rault
Center, a high-rise office and apartment building across
the street from the Howard Johnson, a little more than
one month ago. Investigators suspect arson.
—The fires set by the snipers at the Howard Johnson
Sunday came six days after two fires, in which arson also
is suspected, destroyed downtown warehouses.
—Going back farther, six persons died in a fire at the
same Howard Johnson hotel in July 1971. Authorities
said that blaze resulted from arson, but never charged
anyone with the crime.

deputy C.L. Colia searches for fingerprints that might have been left by aw*
intruder who broke into the Daily office Saturday night and stole a turntable,
speakers and stereo tuner. Deputies found the man inside the building, but he
escaped through an open window as an officer entered the building through a
nearby door.
