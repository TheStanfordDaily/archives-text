# Watergate Jury Selection Begins
## 
### ED KOHN 
Special to the Daily
WASHINGTON — Jury selection in
the Watergate case, a trial almost
certain to prove politically damaging
to the Nixon Administration, is
scheduled to begin in Federal District
Court here this morning.
Meanwhile, Senate Majority Leader
Mike Mansfield (D.-Mont.) has
requested a hearing on the Watergate
bugging allegations and what he
termed "other insidious campaign
practices."
Mansfield wrote to two powerful
senators, Sam J. Ervin (D.-N.C.) and
James O. Eastland (D.-Miss.), asking
them to decide whether the Senate
Government Operations Committee or
the Senate Judiciary Committee
should conduct the probe.
In either case. Ervin, a former state
supreme court justice and a strong
defender of privacy rights, would head
the investigation.
"Enough is already known of the
facts to make clear that the matter is
not to be dismissed as a 'political
caper' or some sort of playful
episode," Mansfield wrote the two
senators. "Watergate was not politics
as usual."
Public Inquiry Certain
According to some Democrats who
have pressed for such action,
Mansfield's request makes it virtually

certain that there will be a public
inquiry into the Watergate episode,
and the accompanying charges of
political spying and sabotage.
In another development, a large
Long Island, N.Y. newspaper,
Newsday, quoting sources close to the
seven Watergate defendants, reported
over the weekend that the Watergate
break-in "was part of a widespread
project in which documents were
photographed in the embassy of Chile,
and several liberal Democratic senators
were kept under electronic
surveillance."
Newsday reported the three men
photographed political files in the
Chilean embassy here. The embassy
confirmed that several of their files
were searched in May.
Monitoring Activities
The paper reported that three
senators — Mansfield, J. William
Fulbright (D.-Ark.), and Frank Church
(D.-Idaho), as well as a former
ambassador to the Organization of
American States, allegedly were
monitored.
The Long Island daily also reported
that two other men, who have been
located and questioned by federal
officials, were involved with the
Watergate group but were not caught
with the other defendants. Neither has
been charged.
The defendants in the case, two

former White House aides and five
other men, have been charged with
conspiracy, wiretapping and bugging
(electronic surveillance), possession of
listening devices, and second-degree
burglary.
Conspiring To Spy
The seven are accused of conspiring
to spy on the Democratic offices
during May and June of 1972, shortly
before the Democratic National
Convention.
A motel room across the street
from the Watergate complex
reportedly was used to monitor the
electronic devices and telephone taps.
Five of the men, none with direct
links to the White House, were
arrested early on the morning of June
17, 1972 inside the Democratic
National Committee headquarters in
the Watergate office complex, located
less than two miles from the White
House. The men wore surgical gloves
and carried radio and photographic
equipment.
Other Defendants
The two other defendants, G.
Gordon Liddy and E. Howard Hunt
Jr., both former White House aides,
were indicted following a grand jury
investigation of the incident.
Chief U.S. District Court Judge
John J. Sirica, who appointed himself
to hear the case, consistently has told
the principal government prosecutor.

Earl J. Silbert, that the jury will want
to know, "What did these men go into
the headquarters for? What was their
purpose? Who hired them to go in
there?"
However, Silbert and the other
prosecutors legally are not required to
respond to those questions to
effectively present their case. Silbert,
while promising to answer some of the
judge's questions, told Sirica at one
point in the lengthy pretrial
proceedings:
Search For Motivation
"I am sure your honor is also aware
that the government cannot read a
person's mind. There is no device yet
known to man by which the
government or anyone else can search
into motivation, reasoning, or the
functioning that makes a person
engage in any particular line of
conduct."
Because of widespread public
interest in the case, Sirica has moved
the trial to a large ceremonial
courtroom which seats about 250
people. About 100 reporters are
expected to cover the trial, and a
special press room has been established
in the court house.
Over defense objections, Sirica
ruled to sequester the 12 jurors and six
alternates throughout the trial, which
is expected to last several months.
The government's principal witness
is expected to be former FBI agent
Alfred C. Baldwin 111, who told the
Los Angeles Times that information
from the wiretapping operation, of
which he was a part, was delivered to
the Committee to Re-Elect the
President.
Democratic presidential candidate
George S. McGovern repeatedly
charged that the Watergate incident
was only one part of a widespread
Republican sabotage espionage effort
directed against Democratic office
seekers.
Defendants in the trial are:
—Liddy, a former assistant attorney
general of New York who later worked
for the Treasury Department and the
White House;
—Hunt, a White House consultant,
who resigned from the Central
Intelligence Agency (CIA) after 20
years to become a writer and public

relations man;
—James W. McCord Jr., another
former CIA employee, who, at the
time of his arrest, was working as a
security director for both the
Republican National Committee and
the Committee to Re-Elect the
President;
—Bernard L. Barker, a strong
opponent of Cuban Premier Fidel
Castro. He is believed to have
exercised operational control of the
1961 Bay of Pigs invasion and later
worked as a Miami real estate agent
and handled large amounts of GOP
campaign funds;
—Frank A. Sturgis, a former Marine
who also fought against Castro and
who later became an apparent "soldier
of fortune";
—Eugenio R. Martinez, a salesman
in Barker's real estate office and
another anti-Castroite; and
—Virgilio R. Gonzalez, another
Cuban exile who works as a locksmith.

senators. "Watergate was not politics
as usual."
Public Inquiry Certain
According to some Democrats who
have pressed for such action,
Mansfield's request makes it virtually

certain that there will be a public
inquiry into the Watergate episode,
and the accompanying charges of
political spying and sabotage.
In another development, a large
Long Island, N.Y. newspaper,
Newsday, quoting sources close to the
seven Watergate defendants, reported
over the weekend that the Watergate
break-in "was part of a widespread
project in which documents were
photographed in the embassy of Chile,
and several liberal Democratic senators
were kept under electronic
surveillance."
Newsday reported the three men
photographed political files in the
Chilean embassy here. The embassy
confirmed that several of their files
were searched in May.
Monitoring Activities
The paper reported that three
senators — Mansfield, J. William
Fulbright (D.-Ark.), and Frank Church
(D.-Idaho), as well as a former
ambassador to the Organization of
American States, allegedly were
monitored.
The Long Island daily also reported
that two other men, who have been
located and questioned by federal
officials, were involved with the
Watergate group but were not caught
with the other defendants. Neither has
been charged.
The defendants in the case, two

former White House aides and five
other men, have been charged with
conspiracy, wiretapping and bugging
(electronic surveillance), possession of
listening devices, and second-degree
burglary.
Conspiring To Spy
The seven are accused of conspiring
to spy on the Democratic offices
during May and June of 1972, shortly
before the Democratic National
Convention.
A motel room across the street
from the Watergate complex
reportedly was used to monitor the
electronic devices and telephone taps.
Five of the men, none with direct
links to the White House, were
arrested early on the morning of June
17, 1972 inside the Democratic
National Committee headquarters in
the Watergate office complex, located
less than two miles from the White
House. The men wore surgical gloves
and carried radio and photographic
equipment.
Other Defendants
The two other defendants, G.
Gordon Liddy and E. Howard Hunt
Jr., both former White House aides,
were indicted following a grand jury
investigation of the incident.
Chief U.S. District Court Judge
John J. Sirica, who appointed himself
to hear the case, consistently has told
the principal government prosecutor.

Earl J. Silbert, that the jury will want
to know, "What did these men go into
the headquarters for? What was their
purpose? Who hired them to go in
there?"
However, Silbert and the other
prosecutors legally are not required to
respond to those questions to
effectively present their case. Silbert,
while promising to answer some of the
judge's questions, told Sirica at one
point in the lengthy pretrial
proceedings:
Search For Motivation
"I am sure your honor is also aware
that the government cannot read a
person's mind. There is no device yet
known to man by which the
government or anyone else can search
into motivation, reasoning, or the
functioning that makes a person
engage in any particular line of
conduct."
Because of widespread public
interest in the case, Sirica has moved
the trial to a large ceremonial
courtroom which seats about 250
people. About 100 reporters are
expected to cover the trial, and a
special press room has been established
in the court house.
Over defense objections, Sirica
ruled to sequester the 12 jurors and six
alternates throughout the trial, which
is expected to last several months.
The government's principal witness
is expected to be former FBI agent
Alfred C. Baldwin 111, who told the
Los Angeles Times that information
from the wiretapping operation, of
which he was a part, was delivered to
the Committee to Re-Elect the
President.
Democratic presidential candidate
George S. McGovern repeatedly
charged that the Watergate incident
was only one part of a widespread
Republican sabotage espionage effort
directed against Democratic office
seekers.
Defendants in the trial are:
—Liddy, a former assistant attorney
general of New York who later worked
for the Treasury Department and the
White House;
—Hunt, a White House consultant,
who resigned from the Central
Intelligence Agency (CIA) after 20
years to become a writer and public

relations man;
—James W. McCord Jr., another
former CIA employee, who, at the
time of his arrest, was working as a
security director for both the
Republican National Committee and
the Committee to Re-Elect the
President;
—Bernard L. Barker, a strong
opponent of Cuban Premier Fidel
Castro. He is believed to have
exercised operational control of the
1961 Bay of Pigs invasion and later
worked as a Miami real estate agent
and handled large amounts of GOP
campaign funds;
—Frank A. Sturgis, a former Marine
who also fought against Castro and
who later became an apparent "soldier
of fortune";
—Eugenio R. Martinez, a salesman
in Barker's real estate office and
another anti-Castroite; and
—Virgilio R. Gonzalez, another
Cuban exile who works as a locksmith.

ambassador to the Organization of
American States, allegedly were
monitored.
The Long Island daily also reported
that two other men, who have been
located and questioned by federal
officials, were involved with the
Watergate group but were not caught
with the other defendants. Neither has
been charged.
The defendants in the case, two

former White House aides and five
other men, have been charged with
conspiracy, wiretapping and bugging
(electronic surveillance), possession of
listening devices, and second-degree
burglary.
Conspiring To Spy
The seven are accused of conspiring
to spy on the Democratic offices
during May and June of 1972, shortly
before the Democratic National
Convention.
A motel room across the street
from the Watergate complex
reportedly was used to monitor the
electronic devices and telephone taps.
Five of the men, none with direct
links to the White House, were
arrested early on the morning of June
17, 1972 inside the Democratic
National Committee headquarters in
the Watergate office complex, located
less than two miles from the White
House. The men wore surgical gloves
and carried radio and photographic
equipment.
Other Defendants
The two other defendants, G.
Gordon Liddy and E. Howard Hunt
Jr., both former White House aides,
were indicted following a grand jury
investigation of the incident.
Chief U.S. District Court Judge
John J. Sirica, who appointed himself
to hear the case, consistently has told
the principal government prosecutor.

Earl J. Silbert, that the jury will want
to know, "What did these men go into
the headquarters for? What was their
purpose? Who hired them to go in
there?"
However, Silbert and the other
prosecutors legally are not required to
respond to those questions to
effectively present their case. Silbert,
while promising to answer some of the
judge's questions, told Sirica at one
point in the lengthy pretrial
proceedings:
Search For Motivation
"I am sure your honor is also aware
that the government cannot read a
person's mind. There is no device yet
known to man by which the
government or anyone else can search
into motivation, reasoning, or the
functioning that makes a person
engage in any particular line of
conduct."
Because of widespread public
interest in the case, Sirica has moved
the trial to a large ceremonial
courtroom which seats about 250
people. About 100 reporters are
expected to cover the trial, and a
special press room has been established
in the court house.
Over defense objections, Sirica
ruled to sequester the 12 jurors and six
alternates throughout the trial, which
is expected to last several months.
The government's principal witness
is expected to be former FBI agent
Alfred C. Baldwin 111, who told the
Los Angeles Times that information
from the wiretapping operation, of
which he was a part, was delivered to
the Committee to Re-Elect the
President.
Democratic presidential candidate
George S. McGovern repeatedly
charged that the Watergate incident
was only one part of a widespread
Republican sabotage espionage effort
directed against Democratic office
seekers.
Defendants in the trial are:
—Liddy, a former assistant attorney
general of New York who later worked
for the Treasury Department and the
White House;
—Hunt, a White House consultant,
who resigned from the Central
Intelligence Agency (CIA) after 20
years to become a writer and public

relations man;
—James W. McCord Jr., another
former CIA employee, who, at the
time of his arrest, was working as a
security director for both the
Republican National Committee and
the Committee to Re-Elect the
President;
—Bernard L. Barker, a strong
opponent of Cuban Premier Fidel
Castro. He is believed to have
exercised operational control of the
1961 Bay of Pigs invasion and later
worked as a Miami real estate agent
and handled large amounts of GOP
campaign funds;
—Frank A. Sturgis, a former Marine
who also fought against Castro and
who later became an apparent "soldier
of fortune";
—Eugenio R. Martinez, a salesman
in Barker's real estate office and
another anti-Castroite; and
—Virgilio R. Gonzalez, another
Cuban exile who works as a locksmith.
Special to the Daily
WASHINGTON — Jury selection in
the Watergate case, a trial almost
certain to prove politically damaging
to the Nixon Administration, is
scheduled to begin in Federal District
Court here this morning.
Meanwhile, Senate Majority Leader
Mike Mansfield (D.-Mont.) has
requested a hearing on the Watergate
bugging allegations and what he
termed "other insidious campaign
practices."
Mansfield wrote to two powerful
senators, Sam J. Ervin (D.-N.C.) and
James O. Eastland (D.-Miss.), asking
them to decide whether the Senate
Government Operations Committee or
the Senate Judiciary Committee
should conduct the probe.
In either case. Ervin, a former state
supreme court justice and a strong
defender of privacy rights, would head
the investigation.
"Enough is already known of the
facts to make clear that the matter is
not to be dismissed as a 'political
caper' or some sort of playful
episode," Mansfield wrote the two
senators. "Watergate was not politics
as usual."
Public Inquiry Certain
According to some Democrats who
have pressed for such action,
Mansfield's request makes it virtually

certain that there will be a public
inquiry into the Watergate episode,
and the accompanying charges of
political spying and sabotage.
In another development, a large
Long Island, N.Y. newspaper,
Newsday, quoting sources close to the
seven Watergate defendants, reported
over the weekend that the Watergate
break-in "was part of a widespread
project in which documents were
photographed in the embassy of Chile,
and several liberal Democratic senators
were kept under electronic
surveillance."
Newsday reported the three men
photographed political files in the
Chilean embassy here. The embassy
confirmed that several of their files
were searched in May.
Monitoring Activities
The paper reported that three
senators — Mansfield, J. William
Fulbright (D.-Ark.), and Frank Church
(D.-Idaho), as well as a former
ambassador to the Organization of
American States, allegedly were
monitored.
