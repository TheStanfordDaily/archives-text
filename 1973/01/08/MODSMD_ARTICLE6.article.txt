## Rebuild Bach Mai 
### 
One of the worst atrocities in a war filled with such acts occurred
recently when the Bach Mai Hospital in Hanoi was heavily damaged
by American bombs.
Until a few weeks ago, this facility was a major 950 bed civilian
teaching hospital used extensively for treating war victims. But in late
December, the hospital itself became a casualty of the war.
At first Pentagon spokesmen denied hitting the hospital at all, but
in light of their past lack of credibility, we were very skeptical. Finally
after a group of Americans visiting Hanoi reported that the hospital
was almost totally destroyed, the Pentagon reversed itself and
euphemistically said that there had been "limited accidental damage"
to Bach Mai.
Retired Brigadier General Telford Taylor was among the group that
visited Hanoi and he described the "limited accidental damage"for
newsmen. "Early this morning the large Bach Mai Hospital was
destroyed. The hospital grounds were torn by huge fresh craters and
the buildings that escaped direct hits were shattered by the blast.
"Viewed a few hours later, the hospital remains were a terrible
scene, with rescue workers carrying patients piggyback, cranes and
bulldozers and people using only their hands desperately clearing
debris to reach victims said to be still buried in the rubble and the
frantic hospital director running from one building to another."
Try to picture for a moment a major Bay Area hospital being
similarly damaged and the horror is vividly apparent. TTiere is no
excuse for such cruelty.
For years we have marched and protested and done everything
imaginable to end this tragedy, but now we must act directly in
response to this most recent atrocity.
Last week in Boston, former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark
announced the formation of a fund raising campaign to raise
$3,000,000 for the reconstruction of Bach Mai Hospital. Over the
weekend, full page advertisements for that drive appeared in local
newspapers and the bi-partisan list of co-sponsors included
Congressman Philip Burton, Congressman Pete McCloskey, Reverend
Cecil Williams of Glide Memorial Church in San Francisco, Reverend
C. Kilmer Myers, bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of California, and
many others.
Each and every one of us has a responsibility to help undo the
damage caused by our government. All of us should send what we can
to Medical Aid for Indochina, Bach Mai Hospital Fund, 857
Montgomery St., San Francisco, Calif. 94133. The Stanford
Committee on Political Education (SCOPE) is manning a table daily in
White Plaza to coordinate campus fund raising and we urge all people
to stop by and volunteer to help them.
Tonight a number of community groups are going to appear at the
Palo Alto City Council meeting to demand that the Council donate
$50,000 to the Hospital Fund. City Attorney Peter Stone has already
said that the California Constitution prohibits a city from making an
outright gift of public funds to a charity and his legal interpretation is
apparently correct.
But people should still attend that meeting to demand that at the
very least, the Council pass a resolution supporting the drive and
urging Palo Alto citizens to make contributions. The Council should
also help establish an effective fund raising mechanism in Palo Alto.
Prohibition of an outright contribution should not prevent the city
from helping in this crucial drive.
