## 'Press Digs Up Truth' 
### 
Ever since Spiro Agnew
identified the cozy collection of
"eastern liberals" of the press in
his 1969 Des Moines, lowa,
speech, a testy, slogan-filled effort
has been underway to let the
liberal press know that it isn't nice
to fool with President Nixon.
Fourteen months ago Special
Assistant to the President Clay T.
Whitehead proposed before the
National Association of Broad
casters convention a suggestion to
drop the fairness doctrine. The
fairness doctrine, established by
Federal Communications Commis
sion fiat in 1949, requires a
broadcaster to provide response
opportunity to spokesmen of an
opposing point of view, whenever
a controversial viewpoint is aired.
At that time, I wrote a Daily
commentary opposing the idea;
the White House responded in a
letter to the Daily by contending
that the fairness doctrine was
unworkable and accused me of
wanting to be a "public censor."
The reply was written by Bruce
Owen, an economic analyst in
OTP.
Whitehead has discarded
sacking the fairness doctrine
(youth triumphs again!) and in his
latest salvo at TV has leveled a
broadside at what he called
"ideological plugola" by the
networks. To remedy this
"plugola," station owners would
be responsible for what comes
over the network news broadcasts.
If it was the handiwork of the
"eastern liberals," and the
coverage was therefore biased, the
licensee would have to answer to

the Federal Communications
Commission when it came time
for license renewal.
As the chorus of network and
newspaper editorialists have
noted, the new Whitehead
proposal smacks of the federal
government, particularly the
executive branch, trying to drive a
wedge in between the networks
and the affiliates. For it has been
network newsmen—perhaps
because of the experience,
education, and expense accounts
they enjoy—who have been most
guilty of this "ideological
plugola."
Local reporters leave world and
national coverage to the networks
and seldom go after the
administration. And local station
owners, oftentimes more
concerned with private profit than
public service, do not have the
overriding social concern that is
felt by network news bosses.
Besides, licensees are already
responsible for what comes over
their signal, network news
included.
Whitehead may very well be
right, however, from his point of
view, in charging a bias by
newsmen. But he is hardly in an
objective position to go after the
networks with a statuatory scalpel
There is no such thing as a story
that will appear unbiased to
everyone's liking. What should be
the aim of newsmen—and what I
believe has been the achievement
Df network news in the last two
/ears—is an attempt to get at the
iruth.
Of course all this talk about

"ideological plugola" (one has to
admit, it's a catchy phrase)
devolves on the one issue that has
prompted a closer look for the
truth by the networks and a
tighter effort to conceal it by the
administration—Vietnam. For in
one sense, it was television, which
during the sixties replaced print as
the primary source of news for
most Americans, that bought the
Vietnam story and sold it to the
American people.
If there is a bias in the news,
then that bias is now with the
American people. For when the
White House conducts a carpet
bombing assault which prompts a
loyalist Republican senator,
William Saxbe, to say that the
president has taken leave of his
senses, then the people have a
right to an explanation.
But we're not getting it, not at
the Pentagon with the verbal
acrobatics performed by Jerry
Freidheim; not in Saigon, where
the daily briefings are labeled the
"Four O'Clock Follies" because
there are no answers to
reasonable, urgent questions; and
not with the Congress, where the
President refuses questions about
Vietnam tactics which he admits
are opposed by many of its
members.
True enough, the press should
not go sticking its nose into
delicate matters in Paris just to
catch a scoop. But that is not the
issue in Whitehead's complaint.
The issue is finding the
truth, however shameful, about
what we are doing in Vietnam and
why. While "No Comment" may
have been the official word on the
recent bombings, the photos of
the world press, the testimony of
retired Brig. Gen. Telford Taylor,
and the condemnation by so
many governments tec ! fy to a
story the administration won't
tell.
And so we need a national
press to try to go in and retrieve
it; now more than ever, to quote a
familiar jingle.
