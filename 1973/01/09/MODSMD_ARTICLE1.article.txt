# Palo Alto City Council Endorses Bach Mai Hospital Funding Drive
## 
### ROBERT BACON 
The Palo Alto City Council early
this morning endorsed efforts to
collect funds to help rebuild the
bombed Bach Mai Hospital in Hanoi,
and directed its staff to prepare
another anti-war resolution. It
declined the plea of a large number of
citizens to donate $50,000 in city
funds to the hospital reconstruction
campaign.
In earlier action last night, the
council voted to send strong protests
to federal authorities over the
moratorium on federal housing grant
funds for Frenchman's Terrace and
other projects. The rumored
moratorium became reality yesterday.
The Council approved
Councilwoman Enid Pearson's motion
supporting fund drives for the Bach
Mai Hospital by a vote of 5-3.
Immediately thereafter, by an
identical vote it adopted another
Pearson motion directing city officials
to prepare a resolution for
consideration at the next Council
meeting, requesting Congress to cut
off funds for the Vietnam war and
expressing support for Inauguration
Day anti-war demonstrations.
Pearson had originally intended to
ask that the city donate $10,000 to
the hospital fund drive. She
reluctantly dropped this request when
City Attorney Peter Stone told her

that such a gift of public funds would
be illegal.
Most of the 31 citizens who
addressed the Council on the issue
urged that a way be found for the City
to donate $50,000 to the fund drive.
Legal Issues
Stone was directed to prepare a
written opinion for the next meeting
on the legal issues involved in a gift of
funds, and also to study the possibility
of submitting the question of a gift to
popular vote.
All but one of those addressing the
Council on the war issue urged
anti-war action. Many cited the
presence in Palo Alto of many firms
holding military contracts. "Palo Alto
is getting rich off this war" with tax
receipts from military contractors,
noted Brad Dowden of the Palo Alto
Tenants Union.
Cozette Dudley of the Palo Alto
Peace Union, and several other
speakers, said that the illegality of the
Vietnam War far overshadowed
questions of the legality of a gift of
tax funds to the hospital.
Pearson Donates $50
Pearson presented a personal check
for $50 to A.F. d'Heurle of Menlo
Park, National Secretary of the
Medical Aid to Indochina
organization, for use in the rebuilding
effort, and members of the audience
contributed $22 more.

One citizen, Walter Harrington,
suggested that the city refund part of
its electric utility income to
customers, with the suggestion that if
they wish, they donate the refund to
the hospital reconstruction. The
suggestion was taken under study.
Pearson's two motions were
adopted with the affirmative votes of
Pearson, Sylvia Seman, Richard
Rosenbaum, Alan Henderson, and
Mayor Kirke Comstock. Dissenting
were Vice Mayor Stanley Norton,
John Beahrs, and William Clark.
The Council also approved
submission to Congress of an anti-war
statement by the City's Youth
Advisory Committee.
More than 100 citizens attended

the five-hour meeting. The chamber
was packed from the beginning of the
session until adjournment after 12:45
a.m. Every anti-war speaker was
vigorously applauded.
Housing Fund Cutoff
The Council also unanimously
endorsed letters of protest against the
decision to cut off federal grants for
construction of low/moderate-income
housing. Comstock and Janet Owens
of the Midpeninsula Citizens for Fair
Housing had drafted letters to
President Nixon urging him to
reconsider the decision. The signers of
Owens' letter included Stanford
President Richard Lyman and his wife,
and University Vice-President for

STANDING ROOM ONLY — The Palo Alto City Council chamber was packed
last night and into this morning, as the Council debated resolutions expressing
opposition to American bombing of North Vietnam. Most of the audience
appeared to favor the contribution of city funds to the rebuilding of Bach Mai
Hospital in Hanoi. The Council did not consider such a contribution; legal
counsel informed them it was unlawful. The woman shown addressing the
Council is Clare Smith.

Augsburger.
The moratorium on funds, rumored
for several days, was officially
announced yesterday by George
Romney, retiring Secretary of Housing
and Urban Development. He described
the moratorium as "temporary" and
intimated that it would probably last
about 18 months.
In addition to the protest letters,
the Council approved a motion by
Henderson authorizing the City
Attorney to investigate and report on
possibilities of the city joining pending
legal actions challenging the
constitutionality of Presidential
impoundment of appropriated funds.
The vote was 6-2 with Beahrs and
Norton opposed.
William Cane of the Palo Alto
Tenants Union suggested to the
Council that the City and Stanford
ought to use their own resources,
which he said were "very ample," to
replace the lost federal funds.
He asked Palo Alto "to use its
zoning power to force Stanford to do
its part" in solving the Midpeninsula
low/moderate-income housing
shortage.
In addition to the
Stanford-sponsored Frenchman's
Terrace, several other
low/moderate-income housing projects
planned in Palo Alto will be suspended
by the moratorium.
Earlier yesterday evening, the
Council declined to appropriate $5000
for origin-destination studies of traffic
in the College Terrace subdivision
adjoining the campus. The request for
the studies was inspired by
controversy over Frenchman's Terrace.
In another action, the Council
imposed a 9-month moratorium on
demolition of frame residential
structures in the downtown area. This
will preserve existing low-rent housing
while a study of the downtown's
future is made. The vote was 5-3 with
Clark, Norton, and Beahrs opposed.

STANDING ROOM ONLY — The Palo Alto City Council chamber was packed
last night and into this morning, as the Council debated resolutions expressing
opposition to American bombing of North Vietnam. Most of the audience
appeared to favor the contribution of city funds to the rebuilding of Bach Mai
Hospital in Hanoi. The Council did not consider such a contribution; legal
counsel informed them it was unlawful. The woman shown addressing the
Council is Clare Smith.
Business and Finance Robert R.
Augsburger.
The moratorium on funds, rumored
for several days, was officially
announced yesterday by George
Romney, retiring Secretary of Housing
and Urban Development. He described
the moratorium as "temporary" and
intimated that it would probably last
about 18 months.
In addition to the protest letters,
the Council approved a motion by
Henderson authorizing the City
Attorney to investigate and report on
possibilities of the city joining pending
legal actions challenging the
constitutionality of Presidential
impoundment of appropriated funds.
The vote was 6-2 with Beahrs and
Norton opposed.
William Cane of the Palo Alto
Tenants Union suggested to the
Council that the City and Stanford
ought to use their own resources,
which he said were "very ample," to
replace the lost federal funds.
He asked Palo Alto "to use its
zoning power to force Stanford to do
its part" in solving the Midpeninsula
low/moderate-income housing
shortage.
In addition to the
Stanford-sponsored Frenchman's
Terrace, several other
low/moderate-income housing projects
planned in Palo Alto will be suspended
by the moratorium.
Earlier yesterday evening, the
Council declined to appropriate $5000
for origin-destination studies of traffic
in the College Terrace subdivision
adjoining the campus. The request for
the studies was inspired by
controversy over Frenchman's Terrace.
In another action, the Council
imposed a 9-month moratorium on
demolition of frame residential
structures in the downtown area. This
will preserve existing low-rent housing
while a study of the downtown's
future is made. The vote was 5-3 with
Clark, Norton, and Beahrs opposed.
The Palo Alto City Council early
this morning endorsed efforts to
collect funds to help rebuild the
bombed Bach Mai Hospital in Hanoi,
and directed its staff to prepare
another anti-war resolution. It
declined the plea of a large number of
citizens to donate $50,000 in city
funds to the hospital reconstruction
campaign.
In earlier action last night, the
council voted to send strong protests
to federal authorities over the
moratorium on federal housing grant
funds for Frenchman's Terrace and
other projects. The rumored
moratorium became reality yesterday.
The Council approved
Councilwoman Enid Pearson's motion
supporting fund drives for the Bach
Mai Hospital by a vote of 5-3.
Immediately thereafter, by an
identical vote it adopted another
Pearson motion directing city officials
to prepare a resolution for
consideration at the next Council
meeting, requesting Congress to cut
off funds for the Vietnam war and
expressing support for Inauguration
Day anti-war demonstrations.
Pearson had originally intended to
ask that the city donate $10,000 to
the hospital fund drive. She
reluctantly dropped this request when
City Attorney Peter Stone told her

that such a gift of public funds would
be illegal.
Most of the 31 citizens who
addressed the Council on the issue
urged that a way be found for the City
to donate $50,000 to the fund drive.
Legal Issues
Stone was directed to prepare a
written opinion for the next meeting
on the legal issues involved in a gift of
funds, and also to study the possibility
of submitting the question of a gift to
popular vote.
All but one of those addressing the
Council on the war issue urged
anti-war action. Many cited the
presence in Palo Alto of many firms
holding military contracts. "Palo Alto
is getting rich off this war" with tax
receipts from military contractors,
noted Brad Dowden of the Palo Alto
Tenants Union.
Cozette Dudley of the Palo Alto
Peace Union, and several other
speakers, said that the illegality of the
Vietnam War far overshadowed
questions of the legality of a gift of
tax funds to the hospital.
Pearson Donates $50
Pearson presented a personal check
for $50 to A.F. d'Heurle of Menlo
Park, National Secretary of the
Medical Aid to Indochina
organization, for use in the rebuilding
effort, and members of the audience
contributed $22 more.

One citizen, Walter Harrington,
suggested that the city refund part of
its electric utility income to
customers, with the suggestion that if
they wish, they donate the refund to
the hospital reconstruction. The
suggestion was taken under study.
Pearson's two motions were
adopted with the affirmative votes of
Pearson, Sylvia Seman, Richard
Rosenbaum, Alan Henderson, and
Mayor Kirke Comstock. Dissenting
were Vice Mayor Stanley Norton,
John Beahrs, and William Clark.
The Council also approved
submission to Congress of an anti-war
statement by the City's Youth
Advisory Committee.
More than 100 citizens attended

the five-hour meeting. The chamber
was packed from the beginning of the
session until adjournment after 12:45
a.m. Every anti-war speaker was
vigorously applauded.
Housing Fund Cutoff
The Council also unanimously
endorsed letters of protest against the
decision to cut off federal grants for
construction of low/moderate-income
housing. Comstock and Janet Owens
of the Midpeninsula Citizens for Fair
Housing had drafted letters to
President Nixon urging him to
reconsider the decision. The signers of
Owens' letter included Stanford
President Richard Lyman and his wife,

of submitting the question of a gift to
popular vote.
All but one of those addressing the
Council on the war issue urged
anti-war action. Many cited the
presence in Palo Alto of many firms
holding military contracts. "Palo Alto
is getting rich off this war" with tax
receipts from military contractors,
noted Brad Dowden of the Palo Alto
Tenants Union.
Cozette Dudley of the Palo Alto
Peace Union, and several other
speakers, said that the illegality of the
Vietnam War far overshadowed
questions of the legality of a gift of
tax funds to the hospital.
Pearson Donates $50
Pearson presented a personal check
for $50 to A.F. d'Heurle of Menlo
Park, National Secretary of the
Medical Aid to Indochina
organization, for use in the rebuilding
effort, and members of the audience
contributed $22 more.

One citizen, Walter Harrington,
suggested that the city refund part of
its electric utility income to
customers, with the suggestion that if
they wish, they donate the refund to
the hospital reconstruction. The
suggestion was taken under study.
Pearson's two motions were
adopted with the affirmative votes of
Pearson, Sylvia Seman, Richard
Rosenbaum, Alan Henderson, and
Mayor Kirke Comstock. Dissenting
were Vice Mayor Stanley Norton,
John Beahrs, and William Clark.
The Council also approved
submission to Congress of an anti-war
statement by the City's Youth
Advisory Committee.
More than 100 citizens attended

the five-hour meeting. The chamber
was packed from the beginning of the
session until adjournment after 12:45
a.m. Every anti-war speaker was
vigorously applauded.
Housing Fund Cutoff
The Council also unanimously
endorsed letters of protest against the
decision to cut off federal grants for
construction of low/moderate-income
housing. Comstock and Janet Owens
of the Midpeninsula Citizens for Fair
Housing had drafted letters to
President Nixon urging him to
reconsider the decision. The signers of
Owens' letter included Stanford
President Richard Lyman and his wife,
and University Vice-President for

STANDING ROOM ONLY — The Palo Alto City Council chamber was packed
last night and into this morning, as the Council debated resolutions expressing
opposition to American bombing of North Vietnam. Most of the audience
appeared to favor the contribution of city funds to the rebuilding of Bach Mai
Hospital in Hanoi. The Council did not consider such a contribution; legal
counsel informed them it was unlawful. The woman shown addressing the
Council is Clare Smith.
Business and Finance Robert R.
Augsburger.
The moratorium on funds, rumored
for several days, was officially
announced yesterday by George
Romney, retiring Secretary of Housing
and Urban Development. He described
the moratorium as "temporary" and
intimated that it would probably last
about 18 months.
In addition to the protest letters,
the Council approved a motion by
Henderson authorizing the City
Attorney to investigate and report on
possibilities of the city joining pending
legal actions challenging the
constitutionality of Presidential
impoundment of appropriated funds.
The vote was 6-2 with Beahrs and
Norton opposed.
William Cane of the Palo Alto
Tenants Union suggested to the
Council that the City and Stanford
ought to use their own resources,
which he said were "very ample," to
replace the lost federal funds.
He asked Palo Alto "to use its
zoning power to force Stanford to do
its part" in solving the Midpeninsula
low/moderate-income housing
shortage.
In addition to the
Stanford-sponsored Frenchman's
Terrace, several other
low/moderate-income housing projects
planned in Palo Alto will be suspended
by the moratorium.
Earlier yesterday evening, the
Council declined to appropriate $5000
for origin-destination studies of traffic
in the College Terrace subdivision
adjoining the campus. The request for
the studies was inspired by
controversy over Frenchman's Terrace.
In another action, the Council
imposed a 9-month moratorium on
demolition of frame residential
structures in the downtown area. This
will preserve existing low-rent housing
while a study of the downtown's
future is made. The vote was 5-3 with
Clark, Norton, and Beahrs opposed.
The Palo Alto City Council early
this morning endorsed efforts to
collect funds to help rebuild the
bombed Bach Mai Hospital in Hanoi,
and directed its staff to prepare
another anti-war resolution. It
declined the plea of a large number of
citizens to donate $50,000 in city
funds to the hospital reconstruction
campaign.
In earlier action last night, the
council voted to send strong protests
to federal authorities over the
moratorium on federal housing grant
funds for Frenchman's Terrace and
other projects. The rumored
moratorium became reality yesterday.
The Council approved
Councilwoman Enid Pearson's motion
supporting fund drives for the Bach
Mai Hospital by a vote of 5-3.
Immediately thereafter, by an
identical vote it adopted another
Pearson motion directing city officials
to prepare a resolution for
consideration at the next Council
meeting, requesting Congress to cut
off funds for the Vietnam war and
expressing support for Inauguration
Day anti-war demonstrations.
Pearson had originally intended to
ask that the city donate $10,000 to
the hospital fund drive. She
reluctantly dropped this request when
City Attorney Peter Stone told her

that such a gift of public funds would
be illegal.
Most of the 31 citizens who
addressed the Council on the issue
urged that a way be found for the City
to donate $50,000 to the fund drive.

Stone was directed to prepare a
written opinion for the next meeting
on the legal issues involved in a gift of
funds, and also to study the possibility
