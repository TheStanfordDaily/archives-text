## Ignoring The Past 
### 
Kevin smith

Among all the voices of horror raised against the latest atrocities
committed by American bombers in Vietnam, the ones that really irk
me are those of "liberal" Republicans who, ignoring President Nixon's
past war policy, supported his re-election.
These Republicans, typified by Senators Jacob Javits of New York
and William Saxbe of Ohio, were instrumental in uniting liberal
Republican support behind Nixon in November, thus ensuring his
victory. Now they appear on the scene, looking so innocent, to
express grave concern over the mass murders being committed by
their beloved leader. This hypocrisy deserves little else but scorn from
those who like to see moral judgment in their public officials.
It is not as if Nixon has suddenly undergone a drastic change since
his re-election: he has been bombing the hell out of the North
Vietnamese for years. These men knew what to expect if he were
re-elected. They knew how often his "delicate peace negotiations"
had fallen through in the past. They knew what Nixon's insistence on
"peace with honor" really meant. They knew the history of Nixon's
political career: his infamous smear campaigns and his alliance with
Joe McCarthy.
Best For The Country?
Yet these great "liberals" chose to ignore all this, and endorse
Nixon with comments like, "We have our differences on some issues,
but I support President Nixon on many things and his re-election
would be best for the country."
The sad, forlorn face of Senator Javits, when he speaks against
the bombing, makes me sick. He supported the man who's dropping
the bombs; he deserves a big chunk of the blame.
And to Senator Saxbe's comment that the President "seems to
have taken leave of his senses," I can only respond, "Where were your
senses, Senator Saxbe, when you warmly supported a man for
President whose whole history suggested the very tragedy that
continues to take place in Vietnam?"
Sure, the bombing has been temporarily halted again, as it has been
halted so many times before, but there is no reason to believe it will
not start again, just as the hope raised before the election proved to be
unrealistic.
Those of us who have sought peace in Vietnam for as long as we
can remember must, however grudgingly, welcome the support of the
Javitses and Saxbes. The old cliche, "It's better late than never,"
applies here if the war can be ended sooner with their support than
without it.
Imperialist Mess
But the slogan "It's never too late" most certainly does not apply
here, for it is far too late to salvage any sort of humanitarian and
principled reputation for the United States no matter when we
extricate ourselves from this evil, imperialist mess.
By preaching peace while supporting those who perpetrate war,
men like Javits and Saxbe epitomize the reason why it has been so
easy for our cold-blooded leaders to continue their policy of
extermination.
So, I'm glad Senator Saxbe and others have finally seen the light.
But I hope that Senator Saxbe's conscience plagues him unmercifully
for enthusiastically supporting the re-election bid of the man whose
policy of continual slaughter any decent human being must abhor.

political career: his infamous smear campaigns and his alliance with
Joe McCarthy.
Best For The Country?
Yet these great "liberals" chose to ignore all this, and endorse
Nixon with comments like, "We have our differences on some issues,
but I support President Nixon on many things and his re-election
would be best for the country."
The sad, forlorn face of Senator Javits, when he speaks against
the bombing, makes me sick. He supported the man who's dropping
the bombs; he deserves a big chunk of the blame.
And to Senator Saxbe's comment that the President "seems to
have taken leave of his senses," I can only respond, "Where were your
senses, Senator Saxbe, when you warmly supported a man for
President whose whole history suggested the very tragedy that
continues to take place in Vietnam?"
Sure, the bombing has been temporarily halted again, as it has been
halted so many times before, but there is no reason to believe it will
not start again, just as the hope raised before the election proved to be
unrealistic.
Those of us who have sought peace in Vietnam for as long as we
can remember must, however grudgingly, welcome the support of the
Javitses and Saxbes. The old cliche, "It's better late than never,"
applies here if the war can be ended sooner with their support than
without it.
Imperialist Mess
But the slogan "It's never too late" most certainly does not apply
here, for it is far too late to salvage any sort of humanitarian and
principled reputation for the United States no matter when we
extricate ourselves from this evil, imperialist mess.
By preaching peace while supporting those who perpetrate war,
men like Javits and Saxbe epitomize the reason why it has been so
easy for our cold-blooded leaders to continue their policy of
extermination.
So, I'm glad Senator Saxbe and others have finally seen the light.
But I hope that Senator Saxbe's conscience plagues him unmercifully
for enthusiastically supporting the re-election bid of the man whose
policy of continual slaughter any decent human being must abhor.

Among all the voices of horror raised against the latest atrocities
committed by American bombers in Vietnam, the ones that really irk
me are those of "liberal" Republicans who, ignoring President Nixon's
past war policy, supported his re-election.
These Republicans, typified by Senators Jacob Javits of New York
and William Saxbe of Ohio, were instrumental in uniting liberal
Republican support behind Nixon in November, thus ensuring his
victory. Now they appear on the scene, looking so innocent, to
express grave concern over the mass murders being committed by
their beloved leader. This hypocrisy deserves little else but scorn from
those who like to see moral judgment in their public officials.
It is not as if Nixon has suddenly undergone a drastic change since
his re-election: he has been bombing the hell out of the North
Vietnamese for years. These men knew what to expect if he were
re-elected. They knew how often his "delicate peace negotiations"
had fallen through in the past. They knew what Nixon's insistence on
"peace with honor" really meant. They knew the history of Nixon's
political career: his infamous smear campaigns and his alliance with
Joe McCarthy.
