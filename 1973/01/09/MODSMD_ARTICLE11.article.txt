## 'Go Into Community Service' 
### 
Elliot 1. Richardson

A noted economist has
observed that in America, "Our
homes close down during the
day." Not only fathers but many
mothers work outside the home,
and grandparents—who in an
earlier society provided the
concern and continuity of the
"extended family"—now live
apart from their children.
Consequently, our schools, in
addition to academic training and
vocational skills, increasingly are
expected to provide that subtle
body of knowledge that
traditionally passed from
generation to generation in the
home: teaching young people how
to cope with life.
Meanwhile, the lengthening
educational process holds our
young people captive until, degree
in hand and fully credentialed,
they are deemed qualified to enter
the world of work.
Yet the learning situation
through which they have passed is
largely passive. Its mental
landscape is flat and bland.
Nowhere are there the challenges
of mountains to climb, dragons to
slay—little or nothing to meet the
instinct of young people to test
and extend themselves, an instinct
as old as man himself.
'Take Risks'
To develop our full
capabilities, we need more than
abstract challenges. We need to
confront real problems, make
decisions, take risks, and learn by
experiencing the consequences of
our actions. That is how mpst of
us acquire skills and develop the
confidence and resourcefulness to
move on to successively greater
challenges.
One group of young
Americans—those whose
education was interrupted by
military service—has escaped the
educational lockstep. And the
results have often been gratifying.
Educators report that ex-Gls
generally have a clearer idea of
what they want from their college
experience. As a result, they are
more highly motivated. It is as if,
having seen life's demands from
another perspective, they are
more determined to make their
education count.
Well Conceived Program
Many of these veterans have
completed their education under
the "GI Bill," which I consider
one of the best-conceived of all
Federal programs, in terms both
of payoff to the individual and to
society.
It is a precedent worth building
upon, I believe, and that is why I
have asked my Department to
study the feasibility of a proposed
program that we call the "GI Bill
for Community Service."

Surely service in the
community is as valuable to our
country as military service, and
more rewarding to the individuals
concerned. The Peace Corps,
Vista, and the Teacher Corps have
demonstrated what young
volunteers can achieve.
'Stop-Outs'
Yet new programs need not be
Federally run. Every community
in America has tasks to be done
by young people who choose to
leave school for a period of
service, and for broader education
in problem-solving and
citizenship. Young people engaged
in such activities would not be
"drop-outs" but "stop-outs," who
are planning to return somewhat
later better prepared to make a
more intense commitment to their
formal education.
Regional or local boards could
certify projects meeting urgent
social needs which include
meaningful tasks for young
people. During their period of
service, lasting perhaps from six
months to two years, students
could accrue benefits on a
monthly basis, just as Gls do for
their military service. When
students return to school, these
benefits could then be applied
against the mounting costs of
going to college.
Our proposal could achieve the
goal envisioned by the American
philosopher William James, who
said that to solve our great social
problems, we must create "the
moral equivalent of war." But to
stimulate such social commitment
and self-sacrifice, we must
structure opportunities for the
young to test themselves on such

adversaries as pollution, crime,
drugs and poverty.
Educational Vacuum
We believe such a program
would encourage young people to
assume active roles outside the
educational vacuum, increasing
the likelihood that later academic
pursuits, and career choices, are
based on practical, meaningful
experience.
At the same time, we would
significantly expand manpower
available to tackle some of the
nation's toughest social problems
in communities and
neighborhoods across the land.
For some students, enrollment
in the program might mean
delaying entrance into college; for
others, it could be a break in their
undergraduate careers; and for
still others, the hiatus might come
between undergraduate and
'graduate education.
Break With System
Such a program could help
intensify, by the very break with a
rigid academic system, the
learning experience itself—and
open public service to highly
motivated young people who
often feel, justifiably, that they
are frozen out of such service.
Such a program could offer a
real opportunity for moral and
personal commitment to those
young people who yearn to
"make a difference" with their
lives and who believe that helping
one's fellow man is truly life's
most rewarding pursuit.
