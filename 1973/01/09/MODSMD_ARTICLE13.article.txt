I remember reading in your column last quarter that the University
does not want to put in a new traffic light at the corner of Arboretum
and Palm Drive because it would be too expensive. During finals week
I noticed a four car accident at this corner. Does anyone know how
many accidents have occured there during the past year? J.B.
The Stanford Department of Public Safety does keep such statistics
and officer Jack Donals helpfully looked the figure up. During 1972
there were 23 accidents at that intersection. According to Donals,
"that's definitely our bad spot on campus."
Of the 23 accidents, 9 resulted in injuries. One of the injury
accidents involved a motorcycle. Most of the accidents occured during
the rush hours of 8 to 10 in the morning and 4 to 6 in the evening.
The intersection is overcrowded and the traffic light obsolete.
Drivers should be especially careful, especially when making left turns
from Arboretum north onto Palm Drive.

Why is the human sexuality text by Herant Katchadourian and
Donald Lunde so damn expensive in both paperback and clothboud?
T.T.
The answer from Katchadourian is that the price of the book is
determined by the publisher, and that the reason his book is so
expensive is because of all the illustrations. Size, quality, and
distribution costs are also involved.
The stiff price ($lO for the paperback) hasn't stopped people from
buying the book, however. The bookstore has already sold over 650
copies. The book is also apparently already being used by college sex
classes all over the country.
Katchadourian does not wish to make public the amount of money
he is making from the sale of the book, but the Stanford Press reports
that the standard royalties are usually about 10 percent of gross sales.

What is the status of ROTC at Stanford? P.D.
Officially ROTC is being phased out here. The decision to abandon
the program was made in the Spring of 1970 following a year of
protests, student referendums, Faculty Senate actions, and committee
recommendations.
The Army ROTC program presently has 10 students enrolled, all of
whom will be commissioned by June 30. At that time the program
will leave campus completely.
The Navy program presently has 30 students enrolled. They too
will finish by this June. Ten of the Navy students are juniors who
were allowed to enroll in a special three year program.
There has been considerable speculation, especially among alumni,
about whether ROTC will be reinstated at Stanford. Such prominent
donors as David Packard have vigorously supported such a move. The
officers in the program, however, say there are no definite plans.
According to Henry Stackpole, chairman of the Navy program,
"budgetary considerations make it improbable once we are off
campus that we would come back for a long time."
According to M. Asensio, chairman of Army ROTC here, any
reinstatement of the program would depend on student desires. He
said the Army program turned down 12 requests from freshman while
the Navy reportedly turned down 37 requests. Asensio noted that it
appeared to him that some of the students whose requests had to be
turned down then decided to go elsewhere where they could combine
their educational and military ambitions.
