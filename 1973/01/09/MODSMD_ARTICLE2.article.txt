# Supplies Bound For Appalachian Towns
## Columbae Collects Clothing 
### BRUCE KADDEN 
Columbae House members have
collected more than 2500 pounds of
clothing over the last three months,
and are currently raising money to
fund its transportation to Mud Creek,
a large area made up of small towns in
the Appalachian Mountains of
southeastern Kentucky.

David Josephson, ASSU guest
professor, and Jenny Jennison, a
former Stanford student and
Columbae resident, are coordinating
the drive. Jennison has recently
returned from the Mud Creek area,
where she spent three months working
with the Eastern Kentucky Welfare
Rights Organization.

"There are about a dozen small
isolated towns in the area," she said.
"The residents have to go quite a
distance to get food or clothing.
"The only employment is in coal
mining or government jobs, and a lot
of people are unemployed.
"Most of the people in the area are
on welfare and receive food stamps
and many are living off of mining
pensions."
Josephson, who recently visited
Mud Creek, said that the name was
very fitting. "All the roads are dirt,
and with the snow, it's difficult for the
people to get the things they need."
Residents of Columbae have been
collecting the clothing from Bay area
residents, principally in San Jose, Palo
Alto, Santa Cruz and Berkeley.
Josephson contacted churches and
peace groups in the area, and those
organizations did the collecting.
The members of Columbae got the
clothing, washed it, folded it, and put
it in boxes. It is currently being stored
at Columbae House.
The final step is to get the clothing
from Stanford to Mud Creek.
Josepnson says the clothes will be on
their way this weekend.
"Most people want to help end the
war and solve the poverty problem,
but they can't figure out what to do,"
he said. "Here's something in which
everyone can help."
Donations to help transportation
costs can be sent to: CLOTHES,
Columbae, 517 Cowell Lane, Stanford,
or can be brought to the house,
located adjacent to the Student Health
Center.

residents, principally in San Jose, Palo
Alto, Santa Cruz and Berkeley.
Josephson contacted churches and
peace groups in the area, and those
organizations did the collecting.
The members of Columbae got the
clothing, washed it, folded it, and put
it in boxes. It is currently being stored
at Columbae House.
The final step is to get the clothing
from Stanford to Mud Creek.
Josepnson says the clothes will be on
their way this weekend.
"Most people want to help end the
war and solve the poverty problem,
but they can't figure out what to do,"
he said. "Here's something in which
everyone can help."
Donations to help transportation
costs can be sent to: CLOTHES,
Columbae, 517 Cowell Lane, Stanford,
or can be brought to the house,
located adjacent to the Student Health
Center.
