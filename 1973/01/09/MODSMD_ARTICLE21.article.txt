# Weak 'Sassafras' Needs Rewriting
## 
### DANA GIOIA SOUNDS OF SASSAFRAS by Scott M. Lubbock— 
Poets like composers must spend a great
amount of time in their early careers
mastering the technique of their medium.
A poet can easily spend years trying out
different forms and styles before he
understands the possibilities of his
language. Ezra Pound claimed that he
wrote a sonnet a day for ten years and
threw every one away. Pound is an extreme
case, but he came close to the truth of the
matter: a good poet must write
continuously to keep in practice, but he
must also realize that not everything he
writes will be good.
Many of the poems in Scott Lubbock's
Sounds of Sassafras are frankly bad. They
should never have been printed. But to
judge a poet by his worst work makes no
sense. Every poet writes many bad poems.
However, most good poets have sufficient
insight into their own work to refrain from
publishing obviously bad poems.
The very dimensions of Sounds of
Sassafras—l7l pages of fairly small
print—makes one wonder if Mr. Lubbock
did not publish absolutely every poem that

he has written in the last few years.
Poetic Definitions
Definitions of poetry may differ. But
whatever definition one employs it is
usually agreed that in every poem something
happens. This "something" is not
necessarily a plot. It can be many things. If
words sound beautiful when they are put
together, "something" is happening.
Very little happens in Scott Lubbock's
poems. They plod their way through one
or two pages and then end in a clever (or
not so clever) turn. Mr. Lubbock seems to
think that the single turn justifies the two
pages of writing he has put before us.
Good poems are compelling line by line.
Good prose is compelling paragraph by
paragraph. Writing with one point of
interest in two pages is simply mediocre
writing. More things happen in one
paragraph of Lewis Carroll than on twenty
pages of Scott Lubbock.
Excellent Moments
Yet Sounds of Sassafras has a few
excellent moments. "Captain Crimson's
Celebration" could easily have been a
first-rate poem. Lubbock employs a
fascinating symbolic counterpoint which is
effectively matched by the language of the

poem. Unfortunately, the poem runs ten
pages, and the first five pages are very
weak. The fact that the poem works so
well after such a poor beginning attests to
the strength of its good parts.
Lubbock has a good sense of setting.
Many of his poems such as "Malt Vinegar"
create an interesting dramatic scene only to
let it fizzle out or wander around aimlessly
as the poem continues. Lubbock's
imagination occasionally entices one so
much that one feels frustrated that he has
ruined a potentially good poem.
Sounds of Sassafras contains many
"confessional" poems. Most of them read
like third-rate Allan Ginsberg. "Gary,"
"Remember," "My Young Friend,
Steven," "Newspaper Boy," "Polished
Stones" and other of Lubbock's personal
poems are very dull affairs. Perhaps they
have some special meaning to the parties
involved, but their interest to the reader is
nil.
Simple But Beautiful
An outstanding exception is "For You,"
the last poem in the book. "For You" is a
simple but beautiful poem. If every poem
in the book had been this well-written,
Sounds of Sassafras might have been a very

good book.
Writing a negative review is an awful
task. No one who loves poetry wants to
spend time airing its dirtiest linens. And
anyone who believes that writing poetry is
an inestimably valuable experience wants
neitherto discourage a person from writing
nor to ridicule him for doing so.
But, when an author publishes a book,
he opens his private world for public
approbation. As much as he would like, a
critic can no longer be polite. He must be
honest. I would have liked to give this
book a good review, but I cannot bring
myself to think that it deserves one. Scott
Lubbock may be a very nice man, but his
poetry is dull, self-indulgent, prolix and
plain.
Needs Rewriting
Sounds of Sassafras shows a writer with
a good imagination but insufficient critical
ability to tell which products of his
imagination are worth keeping and which
are not. Almost every poem in the book
needs a rewrite. But good poems are hard
to write. Maybe in Sounds of Sassafras
Scott Lubbock has made all the necessary
mistakes that a poet must make before he
can get down to serious business.
