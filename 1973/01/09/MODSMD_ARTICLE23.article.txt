## Menuhin Conducts Well, Plays Poorly 
### KITTY PATTERSON 
It is depressing to watch a
once-brilliant artist degenerate; it
is encouraging to see him
simultaneously rise in another field.
In the past few years, Yehudi
Menuhin has turned more and
more away from playing the violin
and toward conducting. Partly
because of a physical ailment,
Menuhin's technique on the violin
has faltered. His adroitness at
handling an orchestra has
concurrently grown.
Last Wednesday, Menuhin
made his San Francisco podium

debut. He conducted Britten's
"Variations on a Theme of Frank
Bridge," Schubert's "Third
Symphony," and Bartok's "Dance
Suite." He doubled as soloist and
conductor in Bach's "Violin
Concerto in D Minor." He should
have kept to conducting alone.
The Bach concerto began the
program with a melange of bad
synchronization, shaky solo
passages, and occasionally brilliant
cadenzas that suggested how fine
a violinist Menuhin had been and
implied how much he had
declined.
The orchestra sounded
under-rehearsed. The violas played
especially poorly. When playing
below the violins, they managed
to keep abreast of the tempo. But
when they held the top line, they
dropped a good quarter beat
behind Menuhin. They eventually
dragged down the cellos and
basses until Menuhin seemd to be
running away with a tempo that
he was actually trying to keep.
Off-Pitch
Menuhin did little better. His
i

tone and pitch were "way off" in
the first movement Although his
playing improved in the later
movements, it rarely achieved the
clarity of tone needed for such an
open piece. In the second
movement, his performance
veered from clear, beautiful lines
to over-vi bra toed phrases.
Menuhin's faded brilliance did
not show itself until the third
movement, a showcase for
virtuoso talents which Menuhin
ably displayed. What still lodges in
my mind are the several passages
where he played an alto line under

double stops. Unlike those in the
first movement, the double stops
hit pitch squarely. The lower
melody contained just the right
amount of vibrato at just the right
dynamics.
The Britten followed. This
composition is a Menuhin
conducting staple. Over the years,
Menuhin has perfected his
interpretations. The orchestra
performed like a beautiful,
well-oiled machine. The variations
demand a great deal from every
player, and Menuhin brought out
the best the San Francisco
symphony has to offer.
Perfect Planning
He guided his strings through
diverse technical and
interpretative passages with skill.
The dynamics were timed
perfectly and planned expertly.
All the preparations apparently

lacking in the Bach must have
been poured into this one.
Concertmaster Stuart Canin
played an impressive passage in
the Bourree. He exhibited both
skill and interpretative
perspicacity. Yet the star of the
piece had to be Menuhin. I
couldn't help feeling he was the
guiding force behind the strings,
that he had carefully programmed
every move exactly as he wanted
it and exactly as it should be.
The Schubert followed after
the intermission. Considering the
original material, the orchestra

played very well. The symphony
is pleasant to hear. It hints at
ideas and greatness that don't
show themselves until the ninth
symphony, but it delivers no
comparable impact. Its form and
progress are predictable, but the
music, though hardly memorable,
does contain some impressive and
lovely passages.
Sonorously
The piece highlights the wind
instruments. The bassoon and
oboe soloists excelled.
Occasionally the flutes sounded
hollow or the clarinets too
wooden. But the bassoon came
through sonorously and
impressively. The oboe played a
particularly beautiful line over
lackluster accompaniment in the
first movement. Later on the
bassoon joined it for a remarkable
duet.

The strings were not left
behind. After a skillful but plain
first movement, they showed
some life in the next two
movements. They reached their
peak in the final movement in a
brilliant grandiose passage. The
violins worked as one instrument
in a classic run. Under the entire
movement ran a current of
tension, the near-passion that
cropped up in the symphony to
make it more than just a clever
classical construction.
The Bartok finished off the
program. Menuhin, or whoever
else coached the brass section,
deserves kudos. The San
Francisco symphony has always
been notorious for its poor brass
section, yet that evening they
played well, without the off-key
note stabs they too often have
exhibited.
Solo tuba and trombone
passages dot the dances. The tuba
performed especially accurately
and intuitively in the fifth dance

to complement brilliant
dissonances in the other parts of
the orchestra.
The strings shone throughout.
They exuded vitality and color in
their crisp lines in the third dance.
In the fourth dance, they
remained tranquil and
we 11-controlled, without
degenerating into the monotony
that too often replaces
tranquility.
The suite and concert finished
in an exciting flourish of blaring
trumpets above the rest of the
orchestra, Maestro Menuhin
returned for several well-deserved
bows.
Menuhin should continue
conducting. He possesses a rare
talent for bringing out virtuoso
talents from every orchestral
member, while still keeping the
body of the orchestra intact. As a
performer, however, he should, at
least publicly, hang up his bow. It
is far better ,c uinember him as
great than to see him as mediocre.
