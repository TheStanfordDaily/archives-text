New Orleans Sniper Mystery
NEW ORLEANS — Heavily armed police rushed a rooftop
hotel bunker yesterday in search of snipers who killed six
persons, but they found no trace of gunmen, and then
conducted a room-by-room search that also proved futile.
Police admitted there was a chance one or two snipers
had escaped or there was only one gunman responsible for
the deaths and the injuries of 17.
Officers gave up the hunt shortly before midnight after
a six-hour hotel search, that even included air ducts,
turned up no one.
One sniper was killed Sunday night by police gunfire
from a helicopter swooping in over the roof of the hotel.
At that time, police thought there was a total of three
snipers.
Police Supt. Clarence Giarrusso had said before the
search he still believed there were at least two snipers
originally, but "if they don't turn up anyone and there
was another sniper, then he got away."
"If we don't find anyone, then we're going to admit
something went wrong, possibly with us, and return to
normalcy," Giarrusso said at a news conference.
"There's a gamut of possibilities ranging from police
negligence to a superbrain sniper," he said. There was a
possibility of only one sniper to begin with, Giarrusso
said, "but 1 doii l nw.
When the search ended, only a small group of officers
remained at the battle-scarred hotel building. They were
to guard against looting, a spokesman said.
Hanoi Forms Anti-aircraft Units
SAIGON — North Vietnam announced yesterday that
hundreds of antiaircraft units have been formed by the
home guard and militia in the Hanoi and Haiphong
regions, the main targets of last month's massive U.S. air
raids.
The announcement, broadcast by Hanoi radio,
suggested the North Vietnamese are expecting new air
attacks north of the 20th Parallel if the peace talks just
resumed in Paris break down again. President Nixon
stopped the bombing north of the parallel on Dec. 30, in a
step obviously tied to resumption of the peace
negotiations.
Radio Hanoi said the new antiaircraft units were being
formed to "deal more stunning blows to the U.S. air
marauders." The official government radio added that
"more artillery units have been set up in Hai Hung and Ha
Bac provinces" — west and northeast of Haiphong — by
militia forces.
In Saigon, the U.S. Command announced that five
American tactical figher-bombers accidentally bombed Da
Nang air base yesterday, resulting in injuries to 10
Americans and a South Vietnamese base guard.
The American casualties included eight servicemen and
two civilians, the Command said. The accidental attack
damaged about half a dozen U.S. ACII9 twin-engine
gunships and a helicopter. Four 40-foot fuel tanks also
were destroyed in the bombing.
Potential Bugging Witnesses Named
WASHINGTON — Seven members of President Nixon's
White House or campaign staff were listed as potential
witnesses as the Watergate affair trial began yesterday for

seven men charged with breaking into Democratic party
headquarters.
The Nixon aides were among 60 witnesses which
federal prosecutors planned to call in what is expected to
be a lengthy trial stemming from the break-in and
electronic bugging of Democratic National Committee
headquarters in Washington's Watergate complex.
The defendants include a former White House
consultant, a former official of Nixon's re-election
campaign committee and another man who worked at
both places.
Stanford Upsets Washington
SEATTLE — With center Rich Kelley scoring 15 points
and pulling down 12 rebounds in the first half, Stanford
blitzed to an early 24-2 lead, and coasted to an easy 76-55
victory ove* the Washington Huskies in Seattle last night.
Kelley finished the contest with 24 points to lead all
scorers. Washington's Louie Nelson led the losers with 23
points.
The Cards, coming off a poor showing against
Washington State last Saturday in which they
connected on only 26 percent of their field goal attempts,
reversed the roles against Washington. Stanford connected
on 16 of 38 shots for 42 percent, as compared to the
cold-shooting Huskies' first half total of 11 of 44 for 25
percent.
Sophomore guard Mel Arterberry enjoyed one of his
finest nights of the season as he scored ten points,
including three important buckets in the Cards'
early-game blitz. Senior Bob Buell chipped in ten more
points for the Cards, as all twelve Stanford players saw
action, and ten scored.
Stanford is now 6-5 for the season, and 1-1 in the
conference. Washington, who defeated Cal Saturday night,
is 10-4 on the season and also 1-1 in the conference.
Today's Weather
Showers likely through today. Clearing tonight. Partly
cloudy tomorrow with chance of rain in the afternoon.
Little temperature change. Low tonight in the 40s. High
