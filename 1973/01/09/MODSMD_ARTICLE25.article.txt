# KZSU Refiles Power Boost Bid
## 
### BILL WEINSTEIN 
KZSU has resubmitted its request
for an increase in the watt power of
the station with the Federal
Communications Commission. The
application, rejected earlier this year
by the FCC, was returned after
substantial changes, according to
Lloyd Snook, station manager.
The reason for the failure of the
earlier proposal was that KZSU failed
to demonstrate a significant need for
more power, and that the station's
signals would have interfered with
three other stations in the Bay Area.
Snook explained the July defeat by
saying, "We had the reason for more
power but we forgot to tell them [the
FCC] about it."
Snook feels that a power increase is
imperative to "serve the Stanford
community, whatever that may be.
Fifty percent of the students live more
than four miles away from campus. We
need more power to reach them."
The original application requested
an increase from 10 to 3000 watts.
The new appeal asks only for 500
watts and a change from horizontal
polarization to vertical polarization.
Snook said that in layman's terms it
meant, "More signal for less money."
Changing to vertical polarization will
increase the area covered by KZSU

four times. Snook noted, "By cutting
back to 500 watts, our signal doesn't
go as far, so we don't interfere with
those guys (the other radio stations).
Stanford students have trouble picking
us up. With vertical polarization,
people with cheap radios will be able
to pick us up better."
Although the FCC has not yet
granted the power increase, funds
raised through the mandatory $1 per
quarter fee assessment have been
earmarked to cover expenses created
by the power increase and the addition
of stereo broadcasting. $15,000 of the
$37,000 fee assessment has already
been spent by KZSU for operating
expenses and for improvements. "The
remaining money," said station
manager Snook," was allotted three
weeks ago and is now in university
bookkeeping limbo." If successful
KZSU plans to spend the remaining
sum for the proposed change including
$8,000 for a new transmitter and
$2,000 for a new antenna.
The station expects the Board of
Trustees, the legal filers of the
station's petition, to approve the
application today or tomorrow and
that the request will be mailed by the
end of the week. Snook felt that the
appeal's chances were "pretty good.
The only conceivable problem we have

is a small area, l A of a mile, in
Burlingame that interferes with
KCMA." KCMA is a station run by
Simpson Bible College in San
Francisco.
The station manager continued,
"We don't feel that a quarter of a mile
is significant. We expect approval by
the end of February if everything goes
well. It may take longer."
