# Lewis Travels In China
## 
### 
John W. Lewis, professor of
political science and occupant of the
William Haas Chair of professor of
Chinese politics, will return Friday
from the People's Republic of China
where he has been since early
December at the invitation of officials
there.
Lewis was one of approximately 10
delegates from the National
Committee on U.S.-Chinese Relations
of which he is a member of the
Executive Board.
This committee was part of the
group sponsoring the recent ping pong
team exchanges between the two
nations, and is now involved with an
exchange of acrobatic teams according
to Lewis' secretary Gerry Bowman.
Bowman was unsure of any
purposes to the trip other than
promoting better relations between
the two countries and possibly
arranging further exchanges. She noted
that Lewis has already met with
several Chinese scholars.
In addition, he visited Tang Shan,
the city he has been specifically
studying.

Lewis speaks fluent Chinese and has
been at Stanford since the fall of
1968. He was also the director of the
Center for East Asian Studies for two
years.
Victor Li of the Law School was in
mainland China this fall.
