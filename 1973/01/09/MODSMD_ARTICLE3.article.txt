# Paris Viet Negotiations Resume As Frigid Atmosphere Prevails
## 
### 
PARIS (AP) â€” The talks between
Henry A. Kissinger and Le Due Tho
resumed yesterday in an apparently
icy atmosphere. An aura of grim
confrontation hung over the new
efforts to negotiate a Vietnam peace

settlement.
President Nixon's security adviser
and the North Vietnamese Politburo
member conferred for 4V2 hours in a
Communist-owned villa in suburban
Gif-sur-Yvette. It was their first
meeting since the talks were suspended
Dec. 13 and President Nixon ordered
resumption of bombing attacks on the
North Vietnamese heartland.
For the first time, there were no
smiles or handshakes between the two
sides, and Tho left Kissinger standing
on the doorstep for almost a minute
without sending an aide to escort him
inside.
Kissinger finally pushed open the
door and walked in, followed by
deputy assistant Secretary of State,
William Sullivan, and other aides. At
the end of the meeting, the North
Vietnamese again broke with
long-established custom and
conspicuously failed to escort the
Americans to the door. Kissinger left
grim-faced, without his familiar smile.
As usual, there was no official word
on what was discussed, but the Hanoi
delegation said the two sides would
meet again this morning.
Communist sources said privately

that Tho's snub to Kissinger was a
reflection of the strong feelings
aroused in North Vietnam by the
bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong in
which thousands of civilians were
claimed killed or injured.
Kissinger told a Washington news
conference Dec. 16 that he and Tho
had worked out 99 percent of a
cease-fire agreement. He declined to
give details of the one percent still to
be settled, but it seemed clear that
major issues of principle were
involved.
Nixon told congressional leaders
last week that the new session of talks
should demonstrate fairly quickly
whether Hanoi was prepared to
negotiate seriously on what the United
States regards as the three basic issues;
the return of American prisoners, the
right of South Vietnam to determine
its own future and effective
supervision of a cease-fire agreement.
There has been little dispute here
over the ultimate return of the
prisoners, but Hanoi has always
stressed that their return was
conditioned on a general settlement
regarded as satisfactory by the
Communist side. American officials

consequently accused Hanoi of
holding the prisoners as hostages.
South Vietnam's independent
future and an effective ceasefire
machinery were apparently at the core
of the continuing discussions.
Both points were mentioned in the
agreement drafted by Kissinger and
Tho in October. President Nguyen Van
Thieu denounced that draft as a
"prescription for suicide" for South
Vietnam because of ambiguities in the
text and the absence of any
requirement for withdrawal of North
Vietnamese troops from the South.
There was no official word from
Saigon that Thieu has changed his
mind. But Tho asserted on arrival here
Saturday that unless the United States
accepted the October draft essentially
in its original form it would have to
face a continuation of the war.
In his only public statement since
returning to Paris, Kissinger implied
that the current series of talks might
be a final effort to reach agreement on
the basis of the October draft.
Arriving from Washington on
Sunday, he said President Nixon had
sent him back for "one more major
effort to conclude the negotiations."
