# Judge Denies Change Of Venue In Holman-Burt Murder Trial
## 
### 
From the Associated Press
A Superior Court judge in San
Bernardino denied a motion for a
change of venue yesterday in the
murder-lynching trial of Andrea Lynn
Holman, daughter of Medicine Prof.
Halsted Holman, and Benton Douglas
Burt.
Judge Henry M. Busch heard
defense attorney Charles Garry argue
that adverse publicity in the case
prevented a fair trial. Then the jurist
denied the motion, saying the
publicity presented to him didn't meet
the legal test for change of location.
Holman, 18, and Burt, 30, are

charged in the death of Jesus Sanchez
last Oct. 6.
Authorities said that the two were
among at least four persons who
plotted to free Venceremos member
Ronald Wayne Beaty, 35, as he was
being driven from the California
Institute for Men at Chino to a court
appearance in San Bernardino. A
prison car was stopped, Beaty was cut
loose from his shackles, and Sanchez
and his partner, both unarmed, were
shot.
Beaty, who was recaptured Dec. 11,
pleaded guilty to a charge of murder
and was sentenced to life in prison.

Two other defendants in the case,
Jean Hobson, 44, and Robert Allan
Seabock, 22, both of Palo Alto, are
also charged with murder. Their
arraignments were reset yesterday for
Jan. 30, when they are to enter pleas.
Hobson's attorney, Hugh Manes, said
he needed time to make up his mind
on the plea.
Garry is best known for his defense
of several Black Panthers in the Bay
Area. He had presented numerous
newspaper clippings, radio and
television news broadcast transcripts in
the attempt to gain a change of venue
for Holman and Burt.
