# Reporters' Rights At Issue In Lawrence Jailing
## 
### ED KOHN News Analysis 
WASHINGTON — The brief but abrupt Dec. 19 jailing of
newsman John F. Lawrence marks another unhappy
episode in the ongoing struggle between the news media
and the courts over reporters' disputed right to protect
their confidential sources.
This confrontation, in effect an effort to strike a
balance between the First and Sixth Amendments,
probably will not be resolved until the Congress passes
special-interest legislation to protect newsmen from
judicial proceedings.
Lawrence, Washington bureau chief for the Los
Angeles Times, was judged to be in contempt of court and
promptly jailed for two and one-half hours for refusing to
produce a tape recording and reporters' notes made during
an interview with a key prosecution witness in the
Watergate bugging trial. Lawrence was later released by an
appelate court.
The tape recording in question was made by Times
reporters Jack Nelson and Ronald J. Ostrow, who
interviewed former FBI agent Alfred C. Baldwin 111 and
his attorneys with the understanding that some of
Baldwin's statements, as well as those of the attorneys,
would remain confidential.
Attorneys for Watergate defendant E. Howard Hunt,
Jr. successfully asked District Court Judge John J. Sirica
(who will hear the case should it go to trial) to subpoena
the tape recording so they could use it to prepare their
cross-examination of Baldwin. (Normally such material is
not subpoenaed until after the witness has testified, but
the parties involved agreed to argue the matter before the
start of the trial so that the proceedings would not be
subject to a lengthy delay.)

As expected, Lawrence refused to give Sirica the tapes,
and Sirica promptly jailed Lawrence (much to the
amazement of the 20 other reporters present). The case
seemed sure to go to the Supreme Court — until,
following the suggestion of an Appeals Court judge, the
Times obtained Baldwin's approval to turn the tapes over
to Sirica, thus purging Lawrence of his contempt citation.
Sirica will edit the tapes before he gives them to the
defense attorneys.
From the five-hour-long tape, Nelson and Ostrow
wrote a lengthy story in which Baldwin described
allegedly monitoring telephone conversations in the
Democratic National Committee's headquarters.
Baldwin also described what he said were some of the
activities of Hunt, G. Gordon Liddy and James W.
McCord Jr., all defendants in the Watergate case. Hunt
and Liddy are former White House aides, while McCord
was security director for the Committee to Re-Elect the
President at the time of the incident.
Latest In Series
Lawrence's jailing is the latest in a long series of
incidents that followed a Supreme Court ruling in the Earl
Caldwell and two accompanying cases. In that June, 1972
ruling, the Court held that reporters cannot refuse to tell
grand juries investigating alleged criminal activities the
identities of their confidential sources.
Few people, judges included, will dispute the
importance of newsmen having — and being able to
protect — their confidential sources.
The staunchly conservative Chicago Tribune, for
example, recently editorialized that "The type of crime
most often involved in the confidence we're talking about
is corruption in government. Who would ever stop it if it
were not exposed in the press? How would the press be

able to expose it without the help of confidential
informants who were willing to tell what they knew to
reporters whom they trusted? . . . The [Supreme] Court
has turned itself into the protector of corruption and
incompetence in government."
Recent Developments
Following the Caldwell decision, there have been these
recent developments, along with many others which
haven't been as widely publicized:
—In October, Peter Bridge, formerly a reporter for the
now-defunct Newark Evening News, was jailed for 20 days
for refusing to tell a grand jury the source of information
he used when writing a local housing scandal story.
—In November, William Farr, an investigative reporter
now with the Los Angeles Times, was jailed for refusing to
tell a judge the name of an attorney who violated a
court-imposed "gag rule" and disclosed some information
during the Charles Manson trial. Farr faces an "indefinite"
sentence for contempt of court.
—Also in November, Prof. Samuel Popkin of Harvard
University was jailed when he refused to answer certain
questions asked him by a Boston, Mass. grand jury
investigating the "Pentagon Papers" case. He was released
after spending six days in jail when the grand jury was
prematurely dismissed.
—In December, in addition to the Lawrence incident, a
Los Angeles radio reporter was ordered to produce notes
and tapes of his interviews (including material not aired)
in connection with a bail-bond story he recently aired. He
has given the grand jury the materials he used on the air,
but the release of the unaired material is still being
litigated.
Congress To Debate
During its upcoming session, Congress is certain to

conduct a serious debate on newsmens' privileges. One
series of hearings took place during the fall before a House
Judiciary Subcommittee, and Sen. Sam Ervin's (D.-N.C.)
Constitutional Rights Subcommittee is also slated to hold
hearings into the matter.
Congress is expected to give careful consideration to
two types of bills. One, known as "unqualified
protection," is being offered most prominently by Sen.
Alan Cranston (D.-Calif.). The bill is one sentence long,
and says that no one working for the press or the
publishing industry can be required by any legislative or
administrative body or court to disclose "the source of
any information procured for publication or broadcast."
The other major type of bill, offering "qualified
(limited) protection," is being offered by Rep. Charles
Whalen (R.-Ohio). It provides newsmen immunity from
forced disclosure with two exceptions: in civil actions,
such as libel suits, where the defendant asserts his
confidential source as the basis of his information; and
instances where it can be shown in a court hearing that
the source probably has information about a specific
crime, the information is unavailable elsewhere, and a
"compelling national interest" exists for the source of the
information.
However, many civil liberties lawyers argue th"* it is
impossible to legislate what most reporters — until the
Caldwell decision — understood to be the'r ri ght. Nor can
anyone easily define "compelling nation, .nterest," a
phrase that crops up constantly in connection with the
prosecution of the "Pentagon Papers" case. Confusion
also exists over who shall be covered by such
special-interest legislation: academicians writing
politically-sensitive books. members of the
"underground" or "alternative" media, or simply
day-to-day reporters for the "established" press.
However, it is possible that reporters will have the last
laugh, hollow though it may be: their sources, fearing
forced disclosure or long jail sentences for their
confidants, will become more and more hesitant to
confide in reporters. In turn, reporters will become less
valuable to prosecutors, who, in the long run, will stop
subpoenaing newsmen because they don't have any
valuable information that cannot be obtained elsewhere
far more easily.
As always, the public will be the victim of this as
reporting becomes more and more stereotyped and less
and less informative until news reports read and sound
just like corporate press releases.

During its upcoming session, Congress is certain to

conduct a serious debate on newsmens' privileges. One
series of hearings took place during the fall before a House
Judiciary Subcommittee, and Sen. Sam Ervin's (D.-N.C.)
Constitutional Rights Subcommittee is also slated to hold
hearings into the matter.
Congress is expected to give careful consideration to
two types of bills. One, known as "unqualified
protection," is being offered most prominently by Sen.
Alan Cranston (D.-Calif.). The bill is one sentence long,
and says that no one working for the press or the
publishing industry can be required by any legislative or
administrative body or court to disclose "the source of
any information procured for publication or broadcast."
The other major type of bill, offering "qualified
(limited) protection," is being offered by Rep. Charles
Whalen (R.-Ohio). It provides newsmen immunity from
forced disclosure with two exceptions: in civil actions,
such as libel suits, where the defendant asserts his
confidential source as the basis of his information; and
instances where it can be shown in a court hearing that
the source probably has information about a specific
crime, the information is unavailable elsewhere, and a
"compelling national interest" exists for the source of the
information.
However, many civil liberties lawyers argue th"* it is
impossible to legislate what most reporters — until the
Caldwell decision — understood to be the'r ri ght. Nor can
anyone easily define "compelling nation, .nterest," a
phrase that crops up constantly in connection with the
prosecution of the "Pentagon Papers" case. Confusion
also exists over who shall be covered by such
special-interest legislation: academicians writing
politically-sensitive books. members of the
"underground" or "alternative" media, or simply
day-to-day reporters for the "established" press.
However, it is possible that reporters will have the last
laugh, hollow though it may be: their sources, fearing
forced disclosure or long jail sentences for their
confidants, will become more and more hesitant to
confide in reporters. In turn, reporters will become less
valuable to prosecutors, who, in the long run, will stop
subpoenaing newsmen because they don't have any
valuable information that cannot be obtained elsewhere
far more easily.
As always, the public will be the victim of this as
reporting becomes more and more stereotyped and less
and less informative until news reports read and sound
just like corporate press releases.
WASHINGTON — The brief but abrupt Dec. 19 jailing of
newsman John F. Lawrence marks another unhappy
episode in the ongoing struggle between the news media
and the courts over reporters' disputed right to protect
their confidential sources.
This confrontation, in effect an effort to strike a
balance between the First and Sixth Amendments,
probably will not be resolved until the Congress passes
special-interest legislation to protect newsmen from
judicial proceedings.
Lawrence, Washington bureau chief for the Los
Angeles Times, was judged to be in contempt of court and
promptly jailed for two and one-half hours for refusing to
produce a tape recording and reporters' notes made during
an interview with a key prosecution witness in the
Watergate bugging trial. Lawrence was later released by an
appelate court.
The tape recording in question was made by Times
reporters Jack Nelson and Ronald J. Ostrow, who
interviewed former FBI agent Alfred C. Baldwin 111 and
his attorneys with the understanding that some of
Baldwin's statements, as well as those of the attorneys,
would remain confidential.
Attorneys for Watergate defendant E. Howard Hunt,
Jr. successfully asked District Court Judge John J. Sirica
(who will hear the case should it go to trial) to subpoena
the tape recording so they could use it to prepare their
cross-examination of Baldwin. (Normally such material is
not subpoenaed until after the witness has testified, but
the parties involved agreed to argue the matter before the
start of the trial so that the proceedings would not be
subject to a lengthy delay.)

As expected, Lawrence refused to give Sirica the tapes,
and Sirica promptly jailed Lawrence (much to the
amazement of the 20 other reporters present). The case
seemed sure to go to the Supreme Court — until,
following the suggestion of an Appeals Court judge, the
Times obtained Baldwin's approval to turn the tapes over
to Sirica, thus purging Lawrence of his contempt citation.
Sirica will edit the tapes before he gives them to the
defense attorneys.
From the five-hour-long tape, Nelson and Ostrow
wrote a lengthy story in which Baldwin described
allegedly monitoring telephone conversations in the
Democratic National Committee's headquarters.
Baldwin also described what he said were some of the
activities of Hunt, G. Gordon Liddy and James W.
McCord Jr., all defendants in the Watergate case. Hunt
and Liddy are former White House aides, while McCord
was security director for the Committee to Re-Elect the
President at the time of the incident.
Latest In Series
Lawrence's jailing is the latest in a long series of
incidents that followed a Supreme Court ruling in the Earl
Caldwell and two accompanying cases. In that June, 1972
ruling, the Court held that reporters cannot refuse to tell
grand juries investigating alleged criminal activities the
identities of their confidential sources.
Few people, judges included, will dispute the
importance of newsmen having — and being able to
protect — their confidential sources.
The staunchly conservative Chicago Tribune, for
example, recently editorialized that "The type of crime
most often involved in the confidence we're talking about
is corruption in government. Who would ever stop it if it
were not exposed in the press? How would the press be

able to expose it without the help of confidential
informants who were willing to tell what they knew to
reporters whom they trusted? . . . The [Supreme] Court
has turned itself into the protector of corruption and
incompetence in government."
Recent Developments
Following the Caldwell decision, there have been these
recent developments, along with many others which
haven't been as widely publicized:
—In October, Peter Bridge, formerly a reporter for the
now-defunct Newark Evening News, was jailed for 20 days
for refusing to tell a grand jury the source of information
he used when writing a local housing scandal story.
—In November, William Farr, an investigative reporter
now with the Los Angeles Times, was jailed for refusing to
tell a judge the name of an attorney who violated a
court-imposed "gag rule" and disclosed some information
during the Charles Manson trial. Farr faces an "indefinite"
sentence for contempt of court.
—Also in November, Prof. Samuel Popkin of Harvard
University was jailed when he refused to answer certain
questions asked him by a Boston, Mass. grand jury
investigating the "Pentagon Papers" case. He was released
after spending six days in jail when the grand jury was
prematurely dismissed.
—In December, in addition to the Lawrence incident, a
Los Angeles radio reporter was ordered to produce notes
and tapes of his interviews (including material not aired)
in connection with a bail-bond story he recently aired. He
has given the grand jury the materials he used on the air,
but the release of the unaired material is still being
litigated.

Latest In Series
Lawrence's jailing is the latest in a long series of
incidents that followed a Supreme Court ruling in the Earl
Caldwell and two accompanying cases. In that June, 1972
ruling, the Court held that reporters cannot refuse to tell
grand juries investigating alleged criminal activities the
identities of their confidential sources.
Few people, judges included, will dispute the
importance of newsmen having — and being able to
protect — their confidential sources.
The staunchly conservative Chicago Tribune, for
example, recently editorialized that "The type of crime
most often involved in the confidence we're talking about
is corruption in government. Who would ever stop it if it
were not exposed in the press? How would the press be

able to expose it without the help of confidential
informants who were willing to tell what they knew to
reporters whom they trusted? . . . The [Supreme] Court
has turned itself into the protector of corruption and
incompetence in government."
Recent Developments
Following the Caldwell decision, there have been these
recent developments, along with many others which
haven't been as widely publicized:
—In October, Peter Bridge, formerly a reporter for the
now-defunct Newark Evening News, was jailed for 20 days
for refusing to tell a grand jury the source of information
he used when writing a local housing scandal story.
—In November, William Farr, an investigative reporter
now with the Los Angeles Times, was jailed for refusing to
tell a judge the name of an attorney who violated a
court-imposed "gag rule" and disclosed some information
during the Charles Manson trial. Farr faces an "indefinite"
sentence for contempt of court.
—Also in November, Prof. Samuel Popkin of Harvard
University was jailed when he refused to answer certain
questions asked him by a Boston, Mass. grand jury
investigating the "Pentagon Papers" case. He was released
after spending six days in jail when the grand jury was
prematurely dismissed.
—In December, in addition to the Lawrence incident, a
Los Angeles radio reporter was ordered to produce notes
and tapes of his interviews (including material not aired)
in connection with a bail-bond story he recently aired. He
has given the grand jury the materials he used on the air,
but the release of the unaired material is still being
litigated.
Congress To Debate
During its upcoming session, Congress is certain to

conduct a serious debate on newsmens' privileges. One
series of hearings took place during the fall before a House
Judiciary Subcommittee, and Sen. Sam Ervin's (D.-N.C.)
Constitutional Rights Subcommittee is also slated to hold
hearings into the matter.
Congress is expected to give careful consideration to
two types of bills. One, known as "unqualified
protection," is being offered most prominently by Sen.
Alan Cranston (D.-Calif.). The bill is one sentence long,
and says that no one working for the press or the
publishing industry can be required by any legislative or
administrative body or court to disclose "the source of
any information procured for publication or broadcast."
The other major type of bill, offering "qualified
(limited) protection," is being offered by Rep. Charles
Whalen (R.-Ohio). It provides newsmen immunity from
forced disclosure with two exceptions: in civil actions,
such as libel suits, where the defendant asserts his
confidential source as the basis of his information; and
instances where it can be shown in a court hearing that
the source probably has information about a specific
crime, the information is unavailable elsewhere, and a
"compelling national interest" exists for the source of the
information.
However, many civil liberties lawyers argue th"* it is
impossible to legislate what most reporters — until the
Caldwell decision — understood to be the'r ri ght. Nor can
anyone easily define "compelling nation, .nterest," a
phrase that crops up constantly in connection with the
prosecution of the "Pentagon Papers" case. Confusion
also exists over who shall be covered by such
special-interest legislation: academicians writing
politically-sensitive books. members of the
"underground" or "alternative" media, or simply
day-to-day reporters for the "established" press.
However, it is possible that reporters will have the last
laugh, hollow though it may be: their sources, fearing
forced disclosure or long jail sentences for their
confidants, will become more and more hesitant to
confide in reporters. In turn, reporters will become less
valuable to prosecutors, who, in the long run, will stop
subpoenaing newsmen because they don't have any
valuable information that cannot be obtained elsewhere
far more easily.
As always, the public will be the victim of this as
reporting becomes more and more stereotyped and less
and less informative until news reports read and sound
just like corporate press releases.
WASHINGTON — The brief but abrupt Dec. 19 jailing of
newsman John F. Lawrence marks another unhappy
episode in the ongoing struggle between the news media
and the courts over reporters' disputed right to protect
their confidential sources.
This confrontation, in effect an effort to strike a
balance between the First and Sixth Amendments,
probably will not be resolved until the Congress passes
special-interest legislation to protect newsmen from
judicial proceedings.
Lawrence, Washington bureau chief for the Los
Angeles Times, was judged to be in contempt of court and
promptly jailed for two and one-half hours for refusing to
produce a tape recording and reporters' notes made during
an interview with a key prosecution witness in the
Watergate bugging trial. Lawrence was later released by an
appelate court.
The tape recording in question was made by Times
reporters Jack Nelson and Ronald J. Ostrow, who
interviewed former FBI agent Alfred C. Baldwin 111 and
his attorneys with the understanding that some of
Baldwin's statements, as well as those of the attorneys,
would remain confidential.
Attorneys for Watergate defendant E. Howard Hunt,
Jr. successfully asked District Court Judge John J. Sirica
(who will hear the case should it go to trial) to subpoena
the tape recording so they could use it to prepare their
cross-examination of Baldwin. (Normally such material is
not subpoenaed until after the witness has testified, but
the parties involved agreed to argue the matter before the
start of the trial so that the proceedings would not be
subject to a lengthy delay.)

As expected, Lawrence refused to give Sirica the tapes,
and Sirica promptly jailed Lawrence (much to the
amazement of the 20 other reporters present). The case
seemed sure to go to the Supreme Court — until,
following the suggestion of an Appeals Court judge, the
Times obtained Baldwin's approval to turn the tapes over
to Sirica, thus purging Lawrence of his contempt citation.
Sirica will edit the tapes before he gives them to the
defense attorneys.
From the five-hour-long tape, Nelson and Ostrow
wrote a lengthy story in which Baldwin described
allegedly monitoring telephone conversations in the
Democratic National Committee's headquarters.
Baldwin also described what he said were some of the
activities of Hunt, G. Gordon Liddy and James W.
McCord Jr., all defendants in the Watergate case. Hunt
and Liddy are former White House aides, while McCord
was security director for the Committee to Re-Elect the
President at the time of the incident.
