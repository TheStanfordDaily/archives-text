## Overseas Campuses 
### 
The recommendations of the Presidential Commission on Overseas
Campuses which were made public last week are a mixed bag. Some
appear to be just what the faltering Overseas Campus Program needs
to regain student interest and academic respectability; some may not
be as salutary. Whether most of the proposals will ever_ be
implemented is quite another question: many of them are financially
and administratively unrealistic.
The Overseas Campus Program was wildly popular in the first years
after its inception in 1958; but today, after little more than a decade,
it is the object of student and faculty disinterest and disaffection.
Independent student travel to Europe has become commonplace, and
the program has acquired an often well-deserved reputation as
administratively inflexible and academically inadequate. Enrollment
at several campuses has dropped significantly below capacity;
elimination of the Vienna campus has been under consideration for
years.
In such a context, many of the commission's recommendations,
while radical, are apt.
Academic renovation is imperative. "We received ample
testimony," the commission declared, "that what goes on at the
foreign campuses often bears little relation to the site and lacks
academic coherence . . . The success of Stanford's overseas studies
program requires that it adhere to the highest intellectual and
academic standards." Virtually all observers would agree. The
commission's goals of academic "pluralism, flexibility, and
experimentation" deserve immediate implementation.
Equally desirable are most of the commission's nonacademic
proposals. Some, however, clearly miss the mark: the commission
came out strongly in favor of relocating the programs in large cities
even though all the experience of the program has been that students
(and faculty) prefer a nonurban environment. The recommendation
that the campuses' academic week be lengthened to five days might
either lessen the opportunity for cultural contact through travel - or
simply force peripatetic students to cut one more day of classes.
Some of the other recommendations, given the University's historic
concern with making the program at least pro forma solvent, appear
eminently unfeasible. The commission proposes that no numerical
limitations be placed on enrollment, and that the program "should be
flexible in its ability to deal with fluctuating demand" - a difficult
proposition at best. The recommendation that the overseas facilities
be decentralized to avoid an "enclave" situation is — despite the basic
idea's merit - an administrative and financial nightmare.
Finally, the commission proposes handing the directorship of the
program over to an eventually part-time "academic" leader. Aside
from the improbability of neatly dividing academic and administrative
concerns and the impossibility of directing a program of the Overseas
Campuses' size on a part-time basis, many of the criticisms of the
program have been against its poor administration. A purely
'academic' director could hardly provide the answer to administrative
ills.
The commission clearly considered financial and administrative
issues secondary to academic goals. As a result, while most of its
recommendations do look good on paper, it is doubtful how many
will ever see the light of day.
Don't hold your breath.

experimentation" deserve immediate implementation.
Equally desirable are most of the commission's nonacademic
proposals. Some, however, clearly miss the mark: the commission
came out strongly in favor of relocating the programs in large cities
even though all the experience of the program has been that students
(and faculty) prefer a nonurban environment. The recommendation
that the campuses' academic week be lengthened to five days might
either lessen the opportunity for cultural contact through travel - or
simply force peripatetic students to cut one more day of classes.
Some of the other recommendations, given the University's historic
concern with making the program at least pro forma solvent, appear
eminently unfeasible. The commission proposes that no numerical
limitations be placed on enrollment, and that the program "should be
flexible in its ability to deal with fluctuating demand" - a difficult
proposition at best. The recommendation that the overseas facilities
be decentralized to avoid an "enclave" situation is — despite the basic
idea's merit - an administrative and financial nightmare.
Finally, the commission proposes handing the directorship of the
program over to an eventually part-time "academic" leader. Aside
from the improbability of neatly dividing academic and administrative
concerns and the impossibility of directing a program of the Overseas
Campuses' size on a part-time basis, many of the criticisms of the
program have been against its poor administration. A purely
'academic' director could hardly provide the answer to administrative
ills.
The commission clearly considered financial and administrative
issues secondary to academic goals. As a result, while most of its
recommendations do look good on paper, it is doubtful how many
will ever see the light of day.
Don't hold your breath.
The recommendations of the Presidential Commission on Overseas
Campuses which were made public last week are a mixed bag. Some
appear to be just what the faltering Overseas Campus Program needs
to regain student interest and academic respectability; some may not
be as salutary. Whether most of the proposals will ever_ be
implemented is quite another question: many of them are financially
and administratively unrealistic.
The Overseas Campus Program was wildly popular in the first years
after its inception in 1958; but today, after little more than a decade,
it is the object of student and faculty disinterest and disaffection.
Independent student travel to Europe has become commonplace, and
the program has acquired an often well-deserved reputation as
administratively inflexible and academically inadequate. Enrollment
at several campuses has dropped significantly below capacity;
elimination of the Vienna campus has been under consideration for
years.
In such a context, many of the commission's recommendations,
while radical, are apt.
Academic renovation is imperative. "We received ample
testimony," the commission declared, "that what goes on at the
foreign campuses often bears little relation to the site and lacks
academic coherence . . . The success of Stanford's overseas studies
program requires that it adhere to the highest intellectual and
academic standards." Virtually all observers would agree. The
commission's goals of academic "pluralism, flexibility, and
experimentation" deserve immediate implementation.
