## 'Liberal Media Hate Criticism'

Before I say anything else, I
should state that, in my opinion,
Los Angeles Times reporter
William Farr should be released
immediately; that the First
Amendment does guarantee the
right of newsmen to keep their
sources confidential; and that, as a
general rule, no reporter should be
jailed for contempt of court
because he refuses to disclose his
sources. I know I'm generalizing
and oversimplifying, but, on the
whole, this is what I believe, and I
want to make that clear in case
anyone thinks I'm a fascist or
something.
However... I also believe that
to identify the jailing of William
Farr and others as part of a
sinister plan by the Nixon-Agnew
complex to curtail our freedoms
of speech and press is utter
hogwash. Never has so much been
attributed to so few by so many
on the basis of so little than
during the ongoing attempt to
paint Richard Nixon as the Carry
Nation of the copy desk.
Perhaps the one instance cited
most often as evidence of this
administration's desire to force
newsmen to parrot the party line
is the legendary Des Moines
speech by Vice President Agnew.
To summarize briefly, Agnew's
speech, so we are reminded, took
to task several television newsmen
for being too liberal, and called
for increased government controls
on TV news so as to prevent bias,
didn't it?
False Attribution
No, it didn't. What Agnew did

was to point out that many TV
newsmen are indeed biased in
favor of the political viewpoint
generally associated with the
liberal side. He said absolutely
nothing about government
controlling the media in any way,
shape or form. It was the media
themselves that attributed to
Agnew the desire to control them,
the better to discredit what he
said.
And what he said, of course, is
scarcely more controversial than
the statement that the Pope is
indeed a Catholic. One doesn't
need an axe to grind in order to
determine that many television
newsmen are liberal. One need
only watch the network news
programs to figure that out. Edith
Efron, in her book The News
Twisters, made an exhaustive
study of the 1968 presidential
election coverage in which she
determined that Humphrey
received overwhelmingly better
treatment than did Nixon, on the
basis of actual word count. And,
if you don't care to believe her,
read Stewart Alsop's latest
column in Newsweek, in which he
makes the same general
observation about liberal news
bias.
Monopoly On Truth
No, the thing that horrifies the
liberal media is not that their bias
is perceived; what really irks them
is that some people, such as
Agnew, have the audacity to
disagree with their self-proclaimed
monopoly on truth. And, in their
attempts to neutralize the effects

of this disagreement, they strive
to pin any number of loathsome
motives and designs on their
adversaries.
The television networks are, of
course, controlled ultimately by
the government in the form of the
Federal Communications
Commission. The ostensible
purpose of the FCC is to ensure
that broadcast licensees serve "the
public interest, convenience, and
necessity." I'm not at all sure
what that phrase means, but I
don't think it means that the
government has an obligation to
perpetuate the viewpoints of
liberal news commentators to the
exclusion of all others, as the
newsmen themselves seem to
think.
Legal Opinions
The newspapers, fortunately,
are not under central authority,
but are privately-controlled. Thus,
the only conflict between them
and the State comes in such cases
as the Farr imprisonment, which
represent the considered opinions
of reasonably well-qualified legal
minds, with whom we can and do
disagree. But the opinions of the
local judges, and even the
Supreme Court Justices, are not
necessarily the opinions of Nixon
and Agnew, and even if they were,
they would hardly be sufficient to
prove the "Nixon Anti-Press
Conspiracy" theory.
In short, the ravings of the
liberal press that we are all soon
to be swallowed up in some sort
of neo-Luddite anti-journalism
putsch are foundationless. Their
hint of truth lies only in the fact
that the government does indeed
control the airwaves—and it is
usually the liberals, not the
conservatives, who call for stricter
control. After all, it was Ronald
Reagan who signed California's
new law guaranteeing to newsmen
the right to keep their sources
confidential. And here all the time
I'll bet you thought he was a
conservative.

minds, with whom we can and do
disagree. But the opinions of the
local judges, and even the
Supreme Court Justices, are not
necessarily the opinions of Nixon
and Agnew, and even if they were,
they would hardly be sufficient to
prove the "Nixon Anti-Press
Conspiracy" theory.
In short, the ravings of the
liberal press that we are all soon
to be swallowed up in some sort
of neo-Luddite anti-journalism
putsch are foundationless. Their
hint of truth lies only in the fact
that the government does indeed
control the airwaves—and it is
usually the liberals, not the
conservatives, who call for stricter
control. After all, it was Ronald
Reagan who signed California's
new law guaranteeing to newsmen
the right to keep their sources
confidential. And here all the time
I'll bet you thought he was a
conservative.

Before I say anything else, I
should state that, in my opinion,
Los Angeles Times reporter
William Farr should be released
immediately; that the First
Amendment does guarantee the
right of newsmen to keep their
sources confidential; and that, as a
general rule, no reporter should be
jailed for contempt of court
because he refuses to disclose his
sources. I know I'm generalizing
and oversimplifying, but, on the
whole, this is what I believe, and I
want to make that clear in case
anyone thinks I'm a fascist or
something.
However... I also believe that
to identify the jailing of William
Farr and others as part of a
sinister plan by the Nixon-Agnew
complex to curtail our freedoms
of speech and press is utter
hogwash. Never has so much been
attributed to so few by so many
on the basis of so little than
during the ongoing attempt to
paint Richard Nixon as the Carry
Nation of the copy desk.
Perhaps the one instance cited
most often as evidence of this
administration's desire to force
newsmen to parrot the party line
is the legendary Des Moines
speech by Vice President Agnew.
To summarize briefly, Agnew's
speech, so we are reminded, took
to task several television newsmen
for being too liberal, and called
for increased government controls
on TV news so as to prevent bias,
didn't it?
False Attribution
No, it didn't. What Agnew did

was to point out that many TV
newsmen are indeed biased in
favor of the political viewpoint
generally associated with the
liberal side. He said absolutely
nothing about government
controlling the media in any way,
shape or form. It was the media
themselves that attributed to
Agnew the desire to control them,
the better to discredit what he
said.
And what he said, of course, is
scarcely more controversial than
the statement that the Pope is
indeed a Catholic. One doesn't
need an axe to grind in order to
determine that many television
newsmen are liberal. One need
only watch the network news
programs to figure that out. Edith
Efron, in her book The News
Twisters, made an exhaustive
study of the 1968 presidential
election coverage in which she
determined that Humphrey
received overwhelmingly better
treatment than did Nixon, on the
basis of actual word count. And,
if you don't care to believe her,
read Stewart Alsop's latest
column in Newsweek, in which he
makes the same general
observation about liberal news
bias.
Monopoly On Truth
No, the thing that horrifies the
liberal media is not that their bias
is perceived; what really irks them
is that some people, such as
Agnew, have the audacity to
disagree with their self-proclaimed
monopoly on truth. And, in their
attempts to neutralize the effects

of this disagreement, they strive
to pin any number of loathsome
motives and designs on their
adversaries.
The television networks are, of
course, controlled ultimately by
the government in the form of the
Federal Communications
Commission. The ostensible
purpose of the FCC is to ensure
that broadcast licensees serve "the
public interest, convenience, and
necessity." I'm not at all sure
what that phrase means, but I
don't think it means that the
government has an obligation to
perpetuate the viewpoints of
liberal news commentators to the
exclusion of all others, as the
newsmen themselves seem to
think.
Legal Opinions
The newspapers, fortunately,
are not under central authority,
but are privately-controlled. Thus,
the only conflict between them
and the State comes in such cases
as the Farr imprisonment, which
represent the considered opinions
of reasonably well-qualified legal
minds, with whom we can and do
disagree. But the opinions of the
local judges, and even the
Supreme Court Justices, are not
necessarily the opinions of Nixon

attempts to neutralize the effects

of this disagreement, they strive
to pin any number of loathsome
motives and designs on their
adversaries.
The television networks are, of
course, controlled ultimately by
the government in the form of the
Federal Communications
Commission. The ostensible
purpose of the FCC is to ensure
that broadcast licensees serve "the
public interest, convenience, and
necessity." I'm not at all sure
what that phrase means, but I
don't think it means that the
government has an obligation to
perpetuate the viewpoints of
liberal news commentators to the
exclusion of all others, as the
newsmen themselves seem to
think.
Legal Opinions
The newspapers, fortunately,
are not under central authority,
but are privately-controlled. Thus,
the only conflict between them
and the State comes in such cases
as the Farr imprisonment, which
represent the considered opinions
of reasonably well-qualified legal
minds, with whom we can and do
disagree. But the opinions of the
local judges, and even the
Supreme Court Justices, are not
necessarily the opinions of Nixon
and Agnew, and even if they were,
they would hardly be sufficient to
prove the "Nixon Anti-Press
Conspiracy" theory.
In short, the ravings of the
liberal press that we are all soon
to be swallowed up in some sort
of neo-Luddite anti-journalism
putsch are foundationless. Their
hint of truth lies only in the fact
that the government does indeed
control the airwaves—and it is
usually the liberals, not the
conservatives, who call for stricter
control. After all, it was Ronald
Reagan who signed California's
new law guaranteeing to newsmen
the right to keep their sources
confidential. And here all the time
I'll bet you thought he was a
conservative.
