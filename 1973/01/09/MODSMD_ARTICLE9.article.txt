## 'Ambulance Changes Needed' 
### 
e. n. kaplan

I would like to provide a few
additional thoughts regarding
your recent article "Local
Ambulance Care Analyzed"
(Daily Nov. 15). The Daily
advocated the purchase of an
ambulance for the Stanford
Campus to be run by the Stanford
Fire Department. I disagree.
The problem of developing an
effective, on-site emergency care
and transportation program are
complex and each community has
unique needs and capabilities. The
most appropriate and effective
program for Stanford and the
adjacent mid-peninsula has not
yet been determined. However, I
believe that a coordinated effort is
essential.
A separate ambulance service
from Stanford University,
Stanford Hospital, the City of
Palo Alto, and the private
ambulance companies would not
necessarily provide better patient
care. In fact, multiple ambulances

could cause many additional
problems and certainly would
increase the financial burden to
the taxpayers or the ill patients.
Changes Needed
The failure of the ambulance
companies to provide emergency
patient care is a result of the
system that we, the medical
community and citizenry, have
created. The ambulance
companies in our community have
made an honest effort to provide
better service, but further efforts
toward improvement are needed.
Rather than condemn the
ambulance companies, we should
provide the urgently needed
changes.
1 ask you tq consider these
questions regarding an
independent Stanford University
ambulance operated by the
Stanford Fire Department:
1. How many true emergencies
are there on the Stanford campus
that require immediate medical
care or cardio-pulmonary
resuscitation? During the
four-month period from July
through November 1972, there
were four.
Price Tag
2. Does that incident justify
the cost of the standard
ambulance ($15,000)? Perhaps
this question is not answerable
because we should not place a
price tag on human life. However,
the cost should be evaluated in
comparison to an equally or
probably more effective
alternative method which could
be provided at a lesser cost.
3. Would a Stanford Fire
Department ambulance improve
the prognosis for most critically ill
patients? Medical evidence
indicates that the single most
important factor in saving lives is
the time interval between the
incident of heart arrest and the
re-establishment of effective
blood circulation. The maximum
time the human brain can go
without oxygenated blood is
about four minutes. Therefore,
the immediate employment of
heart-lung resuscitation is the
most important factor. An
educated public and a near-by,
well-trained fire department
rescue team can best provide this
treatment.
The highly-trained nurse or
physician's assistant in the rescue
vehicle cannot replace this vital
function of the fire department,
but they can provide a
sophisticated hospital treatment
with electrocardiograms, electrical
defibrilation of the heart,
intra-venous fluids and blood and
special drugs in transport from the
scene of the emergency to the
hospital.
4. Are fire department
paramedics medically capable and
legally authorized to handle all
emergencies? In the context
outlined in the prior question, fire
department paramedics can
provide cardio-pulmonary
resuscitation. However, they
could not legally, and should not
medically, carry out the more
sophisticated medical treatment.
Unquestionably, the Stanford
Fire Department (and other local
community fire departments)
should play an increased role in
emergency care. They need not
become involved with transport of
the patient to the hospital. The
fire department should have easily
transportable special resuscitation
equipment to provide on-site care

and maintain the life of the
patient until the rescue ambulance
arrives.
I must agree, however, that if a
coordinated emergency care
rescue unit is not established, a
fire department ambulance is a
reasonable alternative.

toward improvement are needed.
Rather than condemn the
ambulance companies, we should
provide the urgently needed
changes.
1 ask you tq consider these
questions regarding an
independent Stanford University
ambulance operated by the
Stanford Fire Department:
1. How many true emergencies
are there on the Stanford campus
that require immediate medical
care or cardio-pulmonary
resuscitation? During the
four-month period from July
through November 1972, there
were four.
Price Tag
2. Does that incident justify
the cost of the standard
ambulance ($15,000)? Perhaps
this question is not answerable
because we should not place a
price tag on human life. However,
the cost should be evaluated in
comparison to an equally or
probably more effective
alternative method which could
be provided at a lesser cost.
3. Would a Stanford Fire
Department ambulance improve
the prognosis for most critically ill
patients? Medical evidence
indicates that the single most
important factor in saving lives is
the time interval between the
incident of heart arrest and the
re-establishment of effective
blood circulation. The maximum
time the human brain can go
without oxygenated blood is
about four minutes. Therefore,
the immediate employment of
heart-lung resuscitation is the
most important factor. An
educated public and a near-by,
well-trained fire department
rescue team can best provide this
treatment.
The highly-trained nurse or
physician's assistant in the rescue
vehicle cannot replace this vital
function of the fire department,
but they can provide a
sophisticated hospital treatment
with electrocardiograms, electrical
defibrilation of the heart,
intra-venous fluids and blood and
special drugs in transport from the
scene of the emergency to the
hospital.
4. Are fire department
paramedics medically capable and
legally authorized to handle all
emergencies? In the context
outlined in the prior question, fire
department paramedics can
provide cardio-pulmonary
resuscitation. However, they
could not legally, and should not
medically, carry out the more
sophisticated medical treatment.
Unquestionably, the Stanford
Fire Department (and other local
community fire departments)
should play an increased role in
emergency care. They need not
become involved with transport of
the patient to the hospital. The
fire department should have easily
transportable special resuscitation
equipment to provide on-site care

and maintain the life of the
patient until the rescue ambulance
arrives.
I must agree, however, that if a
coordinated emergency care
rescue unit is not established, a
fire department ambulance is a
reasonable alternative.

I would like to provide a few
additional thoughts regarding
your recent article "Local
Ambulance Care Analyzed"
(Daily Nov. 15). The Daily
advocated the purchase of an
ambulance for the Stanford
Campus to be run by the Stanford
Fire Department. I disagree.
The problem of developing an
effective, on-site emergency care
and transportation program are
complex and each community has
unique needs and capabilities. The
most appropriate and effective
program for Stanford and the
adjacent mid-peninsula has not
yet been determined. However, I
believe that a coordinated effort is
essential.
A separate ambulance service
from Stanford University,
Stanford Hospital, the City of
Palo Alto, and the private
ambulance companies would not
necessarily provide better patient
care. In fact, multiple ambulances

could cause many additional
problems and certainly would
increase the financial burden to
the taxpayers or the ill patients.
Changes Needed
The failure of the ambulance
companies to provide emergency
patient care is a result of the
system that we, the medical
community and citizenry, have
created. The ambulance
companies in our community have
made an honest effort to provide
better service, but further efforts
toward improvement are needed.
Rather than condemn the
ambulance companies, we should
provide the urgently needed
