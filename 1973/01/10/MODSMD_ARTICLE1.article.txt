# Chronic Deficit Spurs Committee To Urge Vienna Campus Closing
## 
### JOANNE JACOBS 
Stanford-in-Austria, plagued in
recent years by financial problems
caused by under-enrollment, will be
closed in September if the
recommendation of the Academic
Council's Committee on Foreign
Studies is approved. The decision not
to renew the lease on the present
campus must be acted on by Provost
William Miller and the Faculty Senate.
Closing the Vienna campus will save
the University $80-150,000 a year,
according to committee chairman
Clark W. Reynolds, professor of food
research. "We were advised by Provost

Miller and Prof. Bienenstock (vice
provost for faculty affairs), that it
would not be possible to experiment
with the overseas program with that
large a drain on the program."
The Presidential Commission on
Overseas Campuses recommended
terminating the lease in its report,
which was released last week.
Political Science Prof. Robert A.
Walker, who announced his resignation
as director of the Overseas Program a
day before the report was made
public, regrets the lack of student
interest in Vienna. "It was a wonderful
location for music, art, drama — great

possibilities for studying Eastern
Europe."
Walker feels the administration will
"probably" approve the
recommendation. "The administration
felt, in looking at the cost figures, that
it was necessary to take action."
Students who wanted to go to
Austria for the fall-winter term are
being urged to apply to fill extra
places in the spring-summer group or
to enroll at the German campus. A
subcommittee charged with studying
alternative programs for Vienna will
probably not be able to formulate a
definite program by September.

Though the present campus is
almost certainly doomed, "Austria as a
location for a Stanford overseas
program isn't a dead issue," Reynolds
emphasized. But, he said, "Things are
cloudy."
Interviewed on KZSU's "Campus
Conference" last night, law Prof. John
H. Merry man, chairman of the
Presidential Commission, welcomed
the closing of the Vienna campus as
part of a "retreat from the campus
concept."
He argued that campuses become
"enclaves which keep the local culture
out." If the report is accepted, "No
new campuses will be created," but
more programs of varying kinds will be
offered, hopefully in Africa, Asia,
Latin America and the Soviet Union as
well as in Western Europe.
Merryman felt that "something
substantial" must be done to improve
the quality of the overseas program.
"There is no sense in sending students
abroad to study something they could
learn just as well at Stanford."
Merryman stressed that the
commission, which included two
student members, was unanimous in
its suggestions. Adaption ooly part
of the report In said,
since its prtjplM&£lm WKMRHated.
"We're pretty #M»| the
whole bag," he cUMM.-
He noted that the direction the
overseas program takes will depend
heavily on the new director, but
Merryman had no specific
recommendations for a replacement
for Dr. Walker.
