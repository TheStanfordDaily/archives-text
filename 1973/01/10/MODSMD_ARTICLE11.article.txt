### 
Courses On
University Affairs
Editor:
This quarter, there are two
courses being offered which are
designed to provide a mechanism
for student involvement in
University affairs.
SWOPSI 147, entitled the
Student Task Force on Education,
is currently preparing a major
report on undergraduate
education at Stanford. Class work
involves interviews, collecting
data, brainstorming, and lobbying
for changes once the report is
released. Of particular interest to
the task force has been the nature
of student-faculty relations and
the amoung of emphasis given
undergraduate teaching. New class
members will be welcomed with
open arms and considerable (but
we think enjoyable) work. The
Task Force will meet this
Thursday at 7:30 in room 62N.
For those interested in
University governance and
decision-making, Peace Studies
101 A should be appealing. This
course takes the view that the
University provides a microcosm
of the kind of conflict that faces
our society and the world. By
seeking peaceful ways for the
resolution of University problems,
we believe insight is gained into
the problems of violence on a
national and international scale.
Among other things this quarter,
members will be involved
organizing a campus-wide
conference on governance issues
that face the University. Peace
Studies 101 A will meet this
Thursday at 4:15 inrooml4s of
the undergraduate library!
Both of these courses provide
an opportunity for disciplined
study of the University in tandem
with action-oriented efforts to
improve it.

South Vietnamese Victims
This letter is in response to
your editorial on the Bach Mai
Hospital (Jan. 8). Before everyone
is stampeded into contributing by
the current outpouring of
propaganda, I should like to point
out a few items which seem to
have been forgotten.
I would suggest that a large
part of the money raised be
diverted to provide medical
supplies to the thousands of
innocent Vietnamese civilians
wounded and maimed by VC and
NVA terrorist attacks, rockets,
and booby traps. Thousands are
injured each year, especially by
booby traps of various designs.
This has been going on for over
a decade. We can do nothing for
the thousands of dead, but the
wounded deserve better. The main
difference is that the VC and
NVA are doing it deliberately. In
the case of Bach Mai, it was
mentioned in a national
newsmagazine (Newsweek, Jan. 8,
1973) that the hospital is only a
few hundred yards away from a
military airfield and that the
whole area is full of military
activity.
One final point, for those who
may be concered as to where the
supplies will go after the fund
buys them. Apparently a great
many of the supplies will be
medical, which can easily treat
soldiers as well as civilians. The
answer, of course, is that there is

no such assurance. A contribution
might just as well treat a wounded
soldier so that he can fight again
and kill someone. If one is to
talk of civilian casualties, the VC
and NVA had been doing it for
years and their victims are equally
deserving of aid.

Resolutions For 1973
After sitting down to a New
Year's Day dinner of chitterlings,
yams, and collard greens, it
occurred to me that I had yet not
made any New Year's resolutions.
Pondering back through 1972,
several events crossed my
memory. The year 1972 was quite
a memorable one for Black people
in America.
Angela Davis, Black professor
of philosophy at U.C.L.A., was
confined to jail for 22 months of
life under intolerable
circumstances. Finally, when the
state-manipulated prosecution was
unable to convict her of fallacious
accusations and outright lies, she
was freed. Who can repay Angela
for the 22 months of torment and
mental stress which she
underwent?
In 1972, Comrade Gregory
White, 15 year old Black youth
from East Palo Alto was
maliciously murdered, and the
debt remains unpaid.
In 1972, two Black youths
were murdered at Southern
University in Baton Rouge,
Louisiana. Why? They were
seeking those "certain inalienable
rights" as outlined in the
Constitution of the United States.
Their demands were answered
with bloodshed.
In 1972, the great Jackie
Robinson met with an untimely
death. Jackie will be long
remembered for crossing the color
line in professional baseball. The
courage and determination
exhibited by Jackie must serve as
encouragement to all Black
people.
In 1972, a bus transporting
Black children to white schools
was overturned and burned. The
mandatory busing laws lead to
such actions as those of buses
being overturned, blown up,
parents boycotting and picketing,
etc.
1972 was a year to remember.
One cannot overlook the tragic
incidents which occurred in 1972.
The extensive losses in Black
communities throughout the
United States seem to linger in
one's mind. One must look back
on 1972 with disdain. For each
step taken forward, three were
taken backward. The
disillusionment of Black people in
America is approaching an
unprecedented level.
Thinking of new resolutions
for 1973 seems perilous. We
cannot afford the accumulative
losses of 1972 in 1973. The time
for constructive developmental
thinking is now, while the time is
ripe. We must take it upon
ourselves to remove the mental
chains which control our thoughts
and which reflect our actions. In
1973, we must take advantage of
the opportunity. I tremble
thinking that 1973 may not be
any better....
