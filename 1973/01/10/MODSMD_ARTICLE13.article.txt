## 'Travels' And 'Emigrants': Craftsmanship Par Excellence 
### ELLEN KENESHEA 
"Travels With My Aunt" has
nothing in common with "The
Emigrants" except that each is an
example of a choice blending of
story, mood and pacing.
"Travels With My Aunt" is the
newest film from George Cukor, a
man who has been directing
Hollywood's greatest stars in
engaging, often fine films for over
three decades. Cukor is a
craftsman par excellence as he
demonstrates with apparent ease
in "Travels."
The film stars Maggie Smith as
the high-style, eccentric Aunt
Augusta of Alec McCowen,
playing bachelor bank clerk Henry
Pulling. She involves him in a
series of intrigues and has him
chasing across Europe in a manner
calculated to have a calamitous
effect on his heretofore meek
existence. The purpose of all the
flurry is to rescue the aunt's old
true love, an elegant continental
sort whom we see in Aunt
Augusta's star-struck flashbacks.
The tale never lags; each
episode falls nicely into the next
with a sort of relaxed hurry.
Spritely dialogue by Jay Presson
Allen and Hugh Wheeler doubles
nicely with Cukor's bright
direction.
Engaging Characters
Though "Travels" is more
whimsical than deep, its

characters are not simply
entertaining, but engaging and
moving on a number of emotional
levels.
Alec McCowen, last seen as the
detective in Alfred Hitchcock's
"Frenzy," is most winning as
Henry. He manages the shifts
between perplexity and
understanding, exasperation and
enjoyment with humor and deft
timing, all in a fittingly low-keyed
way.
He is in direct contrast to Aunt
Augusta's confidant, Wordsworth,
a huge happy fortune-teller
bouyantly played by Lou Gossett.
Wordsworth dresses like a
butterfly and looks as though he
has the strength of a bull. In
Gossett's capable hands
Wordsworth is slightly batty, but
still someone to be depended
upon, a man who takes care of
those he loves.
He loves Augusta, an Auntie
Mame type—zany, romantic,
free-wheeling. Augusta is also
serious and quite idealistic
beneath her scatter-brained
veneer. Maggie Smith puts all of
this into Augusta, and more. Her
mannerisms are distractingly
frenetic as the old Aunt, though,
but this may be to differentiate
her from the young Augusta of
the flashbacks.
"Travels With My Aunt" has a
gaiety and wit not often enough

seen in films and Cukor's clean,
fast pacing provide just the right
touch to a charming film.
Heavier "Emigrants"
"The Emigrants" is heavier
than "Travels With My Aunt,"
and more epic than episodic, but
it is by no means heavy-handed.
Swedish director Jan Troell also
helped write the screenplay and
photograph his film.
"The Emigrants" is a slow,
luxuriant film, that glides like a
sailing ship down a calm river
where "Travels" bounced along in
a fast European train.
It is the first of a series of films
concerned with a family of
Swedish emigrants to the United
States in the early 1800's. "The
Emigrants" takes the family from
its troubles in Sweden through the
arduous ocean crossing to
America and ends as they lay
claim to their new land.
Max von Sydow and Liv
Ullmann play the parents and
leading couple in the group which
includes both neighbors and
relatives. Their relationship is
nicely sketched and one comes to
have a feel for their differences
and similarities, for the way they
work together, for the way they
deal with their children.
Unguarded Moments
Troell's camera very well
catches the small, unguarded
moments of his characters, such as

Ullmann and her daughter running
for a last swing on a favorite swing
or von Sydow's foot tapping in
time to a tune he hums. Troell has
an eye for both the beauties and
rigours of the farmer's life. His
film is a pastoral poem, graceful,
slow and romantic.
Troell's characters are muted
heroes. They are figures from a

romance made more realistic by
the realism of the sets and
surroundings in the film. Any
cynicism in the film is aimed away
from the leading characters, for it
is clear that Troell loves his
emigrants.
Still, "The Emigrants" never
lapses into sentimentality. It is a
strong movie with a rich feel to it.

States in the early 1800's. "The
Emigrants" takes the family from
its troubles in Sweden through the
arduous ocean crossing to
America and ends as they lay
claim to their new land.
Max von Sydow and Liv
Ullmann play the parents and
leading couple in the group which
includes both neighbors and
relatives. Their relationship is
nicely sketched and one comes to
have a feel for their differences
and similarities, for the way they
work together, for the way they
deal with their children.
Unguarded Moments
Troell's camera very well
catches the small, unguarded
moments of his characters, such as

Ullmann and her daughter running
for a last swing on a favorite swing
or von Sydow's foot tapping in
time to a tune he hums. Troell has
an eye for both the beauties and
rigours of the farmer's life. His
film is a pastoral poem, graceful,
slow and romantic.
Troell's characters are muted
heroes. They are figures from a

romance made more realistic by
the realism of the sets and
surroundings in the film. Any
cynicism in the film is aimed away
from the leading characters, for it
is clear that Troell loves his
emigrants.
Still, "The Emigrants" never
lapses into sentimentality. It is a
strong movie with a rich feel to it.

UNDYING ENTHUSIASM—Director George Cukor, shown with
Maggie Smith during filming of MGM's "Travels With My Aunt,"
admits to feeling the same excitement over each project now that he
did when he first started, forty-nine movies ago.
"Travels With My Aunt" has
nothing in common with "The
Emigrants" except that each is an
example of a choice blending of
story, mood and pacing.
"Travels With My Aunt" is the
newest film from George Cukor, a
man who has been directing
Hollywood's greatest stars in
engaging, often fine films for over
three decades. Cukor is a
craftsman par excellence as he
demonstrates with apparent ease
in "Travels."
The film stars Maggie Smith as
the high-style, eccentric Aunt
Augusta of Alec McCowen,
playing bachelor bank clerk Henry
Pulling. She involves him in a
series of intrigues and has him
chasing across Europe in a manner
calculated to have a calamitous
effect on his heretofore meek
existence. The purpose of all the
flurry is to rescue the aunt's old
true love, an elegant continental
sort whom we see in Aunt
Augusta's star-struck flashbacks.
The tale never lags; each
episode falls nicely into the next
with a sort of relaxed hurry.
Spritely dialogue by Jay Presson
Allen and Hugh Wheeler doubles
nicely with Cukor's bright
direction.
Engaging Characters
Though "Travels" is more
whimsical than deep, its

characters are not simply
entertaining, but engaging and
moving on a number of emotional
levels.
Alec McCowen, last seen as the
detective in Alfred Hitchcock's
"Frenzy," is most winning as
Henry. He manages the shifts
between perplexity and
understanding, exasperation and
enjoyment with humor and deft
timing, all in a fittingly low-keyed
way.
He is in direct contrast to Aunt
Augusta's confidant, Wordsworth,
a huge happy fortune-teller
bouyantly played by Lou Gossett.
Wordsworth dresses like a
butterfly and looks as though he
has the strength of a bull. In
Gossett's capable hands
Wordsworth is slightly batty, but
still someone to be depended
upon, a man who takes care of
those he loves.
He loves Augusta, an Auntie
Mame type—zany, romantic,
free-wheeling. Augusta is also
serious and quite idealistic
beneath her scatter-brained
veneer. Maggie Smith puts all of
this into Augusta, and more. Her
mannerisms are distractingly
frenetic as the old Aunt, though,
but this may be to differentiate
her from the young Augusta of
the flashbacks.
"Travels With My Aunt" has a
gaiety and wit not often enough

seen in films and Cukor's clean,
fast pacing provide just the right
touch to a charming film.
Heavier "Emigrants"
"The Emigrants" is heavier
than "Travels With My Aunt,"
and more epic than episodic, but
it is by no means heavy-handed.
Swedish director Jan Troell also
helped write the screenplay and
photograph his film.
"The Emigrants" is a slow,
luxuriant film, that glides like a
sailing ship down a calm river
where "Travels" bounced along in
a fast European train.
It is the first of a series of films

Swedish emigrants to the United
States in the early 1800's. "The

timing, all in a fittingly low-keyed
way.
He is in direct contrast to Aunt
Augusta's confidant, Wordsworth,
a huge happy fortune-teller
bouyantly played by Lou Gossett.
Wordsworth dresses like a
butterfly and looks as though he
has the strength of a bull. In
Gossett's capable hands
Wordsworth is slightly batty, but
still someone to be depended
upon, a man who takes care of
those he loves.
He loves Augusta, an Auntie
Mame type—zany, romantic,
free-wheeling. Augusta is also
serious and quite idealistic
beneath her scatter-brained
veneer. Maggie Smith puts all of
this into Augusta, and more. Her
mannerisms are distractingly
frenetic as the old Aunt, though,
but this may be to differentiate
her from the young Augusta of
the flashbacks.
"Travels With My Aunt" has a
gaiety and wit not often enough

seen in films and Cukor's clean,
fast pacing provide just the right
touch to a charming film.
Heavier "Emigrants"
"The Emigrants" is heavier
than "Travels With My Aunt,"
and more epic than episodic, but
it is by no means heavy-handed.
Swedish director Jan Troell also
helped write the screenplay and
photograph his film.
"The Emigrants" is a slow,
luxuriant film, that glides like a
sailing ship down a calm river
where "Travels" bounced along in
a fast European train.
It is the first of a series of films
concerned with a family of
Swedish emigrants to the United
States in the early 1800's. "The
Emigrants" takes the family from
its troubles in Sweden through the
arduous ocean crossing to
America and ends as they lay
claim to their new land.
Max von Sydow and Liv
Ullmann play the parents and
leading couple in the group which
includes both neighbors and
relatives. Their relationship is
nicely sketched and one comes to
have a feel for their differences
and similarities, for the way they
work together, for the way they
deal with their children.
Unguarded Moments
Troell's camera very well
catches the small, unguarded
moments of his characters, such as

Ullmann and her daughter running
for a last swing on a favorite swing
or von Sydow's foot tapping in
time to a tune he hums. Troell has
an eye for both the beauties and
rigours of the farmer's life. His
film is a pastoral poem, graceful,
slow and romantic.
Troell's characters are muted
heroes. They are figures from a

romance made more realistic by
the realism of the sets and
surroundings in the film. Any
cynicism in the film is aimed away
from the leading characters, for it
is clear that Troell loves his
emigrants.
Still, "The Emigrants" never
lapses into sentimentality. It is a
strong movie with a rich feel to it.
