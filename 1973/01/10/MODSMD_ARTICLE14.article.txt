# For How Many Does She Speak?

### 
"Black Girl" is a disappointment. There are so
many good things in it or almost in it that it's a
shame that the film is not a deep or memorable
experience.
J.E. Franklin has written the screenplay from her
off-Broadway play, but although it's a nicely
written work, nothing stands out as great in it. The
script is never boring, but it is rather consistently
bland.
Visually, "Black Girl" is dull indeed. For all the
cinematic creativity director Ossie Davis brings to
the film, it might as well still be on the stage.
"Black Girl" is interesting because it differs from
the rest of the black film fare currently up for grabs.
No super-cool super-studs decorate the film, nor are
iron back-boned earth mothers a la "Sounder" in
evidence. Franklin gives us instead a middle-class
black mother, Mama Rosie (Louise Stubbs), her
three natural daughters, one "adopted" girl, Netta
(Leslie Uggams), and her wandering husband (Brock
Peters).
Unsatisfiable Desires
Mama Rosie is domineering, sharp-tempered and
frustrated. She works hard at a menial job,
supporting her live-in mother and daughters, but she
wants more than she can ever get. She focuses her
unsatisfiable desires on her daughters, but the two
eldest are married and solely interested in physical
comforts.
The youngest, very well played by Peggy Pettitt,
is a dreamer and a worker. She wants to be a dancer,
but Mama Rosie equates her dancing with whoring.
Mama wants someone who makes money with
her mind, not her body, and she finds that in Netta,
softly but strongly played by Uggams. A
conscientious college student, Netta plans on law
school. She should set the shining example, as Mama
keeps reminding her three failures and herself. The

crux of "Black Girl" is the confrontation at
opposing sides, brought on by Netta's visit from
school.
Talky Confrontation
It's a talky confrontation, but well-handled by
director Davis and the ensemble. Stubbs retains
complete control of her role and turns in an
especially fine performance. As her husband, Peters
is just the right mixture of brass and bashfulness.
The problem with Peters' role is that it doesn't
do away with the stereotype; it twists it. Peters is
not "Shaft," but he bears a great resemblance to all
those other movie inhabitants who flash money,
cars and charm when all the time what they really
want is that one good woman.
More troubling is "Black Girl's" anti-sex bias.
Very simply, those in the film who have goals, jobs,
money, potential, either reject sex (Pettitt),
specifically avoid it (Uggams), or just plain don't
want it (Stubbs). Peters does well and likes it, and
though he has his sexual playmates (while the three
women have none), he in no way cares about them.
Too Vicious
The two eldest daughters, both married, one
pregnant, have no interests beyond those of the
moment, which includes making passes at the local
mailman. They are excessively jealous and more
vicious toward Netta than the situation warrants—or
so one is given to feel.
One of the messages of the black movement has
been all along that blacks will show "dead-loined"
whites (as Amiri Imamu Baraka, alias Leßoi Jones,
so deftly put it) how to re-integrate sexual passion
into their too mental lives. Thus it is interesting that
in "Black Girl" Franklin should choose to return, or
anyway reiterate, those same sexual attitudes that
have been marching side by side with the Puritan
ethic for so many years in America. For how many,
one wonders, does she speak? —E.K.
