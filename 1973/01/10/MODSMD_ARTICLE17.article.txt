# Hicks And Licks Get Top Billing
## 
### DAN FORTE 
During the early days of the
San Francisco rock scene, one of
the regulars at the Fillmore and
the Avalon Ballroom was a group
called The Charlatans. The group
never reached top-billing status,
and dissolved after a couple of
years.
Since then the Charlatans'
leader, Dan Hicks, has formed his
own group, Dan Hicks and his Hot
Licks. After about four years of
playing second bill to nearly
everyone, the group has finally
earned the following it deserves.
They have appeared on the Dick
Cavett Show, The Tonight Show,
and the Flip Wilson Show.
On Thursday, December 28,
the Hot Licks sold out The
Boarding House in San Francisco.
The style and sound of Dan Hicks
and his Hot Licks is very original
and hard to describe. It's sort of a
1930's jazz sound with a touch of
country.
The group started off the set
with "Evenin' Breeze." "Johnny
Guitar" Girton and violinist Sid
Page, by no coincidence, sound
remarkably like the late jazz
guitarist Django Reinhardt and his
violinist Stephane Grappelly. The
background harmonies of the
"Lickettes," Naomi Eisenberg and
Maryann Price, sound a lot like
The Andrews Sisters. The
remainder of the group consists of
Jaime Leopold on string bass,
Hicks on lead vocal and rhythm
guitar, and a new addition, a
drummer who Dan neglected to
introduce.

On the next song, "When- s
The Money?", Sid Page pla> ed
mandolin and Naomi Eisenberg
played fiddle. The best song of
the evening was the slow "News
From Up The Street." Other
notables were "Shorty Falls In
Love," "My Old Timey Baby."
and a country one called "How
Can I Miss You When You Won't
Go Away?" which featured »
great fiddle solo by Page. All ot
the songs were written by Hicks
with the exception of "Success'
by Naomi, and one written b\
John Girton.
At one point during the show
Hicks announced that the set was
being broadcast over KPFA by
saying "Hi, all you shitheads oin
in radioland!"
The set ended with the Hot
Licks' show-stopper "Milk Shakin
Mama," with choreography b\ the
Lickettes and Dan. For an encore
they did "The Buzzard Was Their
Friend" with pizzicato violin solo
by both Naomi and Sid.

Since then the Charlatans'
leader, Dan Hicks, has formed his
own group, Dan Hicks and his Hot
Licks. After about four years of
playing second bill to nearly
everyone, the group has finally
earned the following it deserves.
They have appeared on the Dick
Cavett Show, The Tonight Show,
and the Flip Wilson Show.
On Thursday, December 28,
the Hot Licks sold out The
Boarding House in San Francisco.
The style and sound of Dan Hicks
and his Hot Licks is very original
and hard to describe. It's sort of a
1930's jazz sound with a touch of
country.
The group started off the set
with "Evenin' Breeze." "Johnny
Guitar" Girton and violinist Sid
Page, by no coincidence, sound
remarkably like the late jazz
guitarist Django Reinhardt and his
violinist Stephane Grappelly. The
background harmonies of the
"Lickettes," Naomi Eisenberg and
Maryann Price, sound a lot like
The Andrews Sisters. The
remainder of the group consists of
Jaime Leopold on string bass,
Hicks on lead vocal and rhythm
guitar, and a new addition, a
drummer who Dan neglected to
introduce.

On the next song, "When- s
The Money?", Sid Page pla> ed
mandolin and Naomi Eisenberg
played fiddle. The best song of
the evening was the slow "News
From Up The Street." Other
notables were "Shorty Falls In
Love," "My Old Timey Baby."
and a country one called "How
Can I Miss You When You Won't
Go Away?" which featured »
great fiddle solo by Page. All ot
the songs were written by Hicks
with the exception of "Success'
by Naomi, and one written b\
John Girton.
At one point during the show
Hicks announced that the set was
being broadcast over KPFA by
saying "Hi, all you shitheads oin
in radioland!"
The set ended with the Hot
Licks' show-stopper "Milk Shakin
Mama," with choreography b\ the
Lickettes and Dan. For an encore
they did "The Buzzard Was Their
Friend" with pizzicato violin solo
by both Naomi and Sid.
