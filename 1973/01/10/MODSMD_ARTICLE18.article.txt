# Seniors Show Increased Interest In Grad School
## 
### BILL WEINSTEIN 
Half of last year's senior class
intended to enter graduate study
this fall according to a recent
survey just completed by the
Academic Information Center.
The report, second in a continuing
series, noted that nine out of 10
seniors plan to do graduate study
at some time.
Compiled as an information
guide primarily for future seniors,
the analysis revealed that
increasing numbers of Stanford
women are entering formerly
male-dominated fields. Compared
to the 1971 report, more women

opted for immediate graduate
study and have fast closed the gap
between their professional
ambitions and those of their male
counterparts. The number of
women continuing studies for an
art or science degree has dropped
by almost half from last year's
figure and instead women are now
seeking more medicine or business
degrees.
While half the 1972 Stanford
grads are now in graduate school
the other half decided to either
work, go into the military service,
do volunteer work, or travel. The
10 percent of the senior class not

involved in graduate work at some
time remained the same as the
1971 figure.
The survey showed that
graduates increasingly find
medicine the most popular field.
The proportion of Stanford
seniors heading for law school
dropped to 17.5 percent from 19
percent the previous year. Those
choosing medicine increased 50
percent from last year's figures.
In the survey, 99 diversified
areas of perspective degree majors
were listed. They ranged from
clinical psychology and
criminology to medical

microbiology and wildlife
research. Not surprisingly,
however, only four fields had
more than 12 students listed.
Again, medicine dominated the
graduate's interests with 111
students, 93 men and 28 women.
Law, formerly the most popular
graduate interest, followed with
prospective lawyers, 2/3 of them
men. Apparently the environment
at Stanford had a lasting effect on
61 students as they listed their
future profession as a university
professor.
Most graduating seniors
agonized over obtaining

scholarships, jobs, raising their
grade average, and taking a
battery of tests. 328 seniors took
the Graduate Record
Examination; 120 grappled with
the Law School Admission Test;
128 took the Medical School
Admission Test; and 67
contended with the Admissions
Test for Graduate Study in
Business.
Half the seniors applied to less
than five graduate schools but 54
applied to over 12 schools and
four sought admission to over 15
schools.
According to the survey 118

seniors applied for scholarships.
So far, 31 have accepted grants,
including seven National Science
Foundation winners and three
Rhodes scholars.
Money played a substantial
role in many graduate school
decisions as 22 percent of the men
decided not to accept grad school
offers because of inadequate
financial aid. Apparently financial
considerations mattered less to
many women as only 5 percent of
the women declined schools
because of a lack of financial aid.
Pass-No-Credit was not as
popular as in times past as seniors

took only an average of three to
four pass grades during their
entire academic matriculation at
Stanford. Over half said that they
took no passes in their major.
A trend toward a greater
equality in all professions for
women surfaced, and medicine
replaced law as the chief future
profession of Stanford graduates.
Perhaps most important, the
survey demonstrated that students
viewed Stanford not as a finishing
school for their career needs but
rather as another step in
furthering their education towards
graduate school and beyond.

Money played a substantial
role in many graduate school
decisions as 22 percent of the men
decided not to accept grad school
offers because of inadequate
financial aid. Apparently financial
considerations mattered less to
many women as only 5 percent of
the women declined schools
because of a lack of financial aid.
Pass-No-Credit was not as
popular as in times past as seniors

took only an average of three to
four pass grades during their
entire academic matriculation at
Stanford. Over half said that they
took no passes in their major.
A trend toward a greater
equality in all professions for
women surfaced, and medicine
replaced law as the chief future
profession of Stanford graduates.
Perhaps most important, the
survey demonstrated that students
viewed Stanford not as a finishing
school for their career needs but
rather as another step in
furthering their education towards
graduate school and beyond.
Half of last year's senior class
intended to enter graduate study
this fall according to a recent
survey just completed by the
Academic Information Center.
The report, second in a continuing
series, noted that nine out of 10
seniors plan to do graduate study
at some time.
Compiled as an information
guide primarily for future seniors,
the analysis revealed that
increasing numbers of Stanford
women are entering formerly
male-dominated fields. Compared
to the 1971 report, more women

opted for immediate graduate
study and have fast closed the gap
between their professional
ambitions and those of their male
counterparts. The number of
women continuing studies for an
art or science degree has dropped
by almost half from last year's
figure and instead women are now
seeking more medicine or business
degrees.
While half the 1972 Stanford
grads are now in graduate school
the other half decided to either
work, go into the military service,
do volunteer work, or travel. The
10 percent of the senior class not

involved in graduate work at some
time remained the same as the
1971 figure.
The survey showed that
graduates increasingly find
medicine the most popular field.
The proportion of Stanford
seniors heading for law school
dropped to 17.5 percent from 19
percent the previous year. Those
choosing medicine increased 50
percent from last year's figures.
In the survey, 99 diversified
areas of perspective degree majors
were listed. They ranged from
clinical psychology and
criminology to medical

microbiology and wildlife
research. Not surprisingly,
however, only four fields had
more than 12 students listed.
Again, medicine dominated the
graduate's interests with 111
students, 93 men and 28 women.
Law, formerly the most popular
graduate interest, followed with
prospective lawyers, 2/3 of them
men. Apparently the environment
at Stanford had a lasting effect on
61 students as they listed their
future profession as a university
professor.
Most graduating seniors
agonized over obtaining

scholarships, jobs, raising their
grade average, and taking a
battery of tests. 328 seniors took
the Graduate Record
Examination; 120 grappled with
the Law School Admission Test;
128 took the Medical School
Admission Test; and 67
contended with the Admissions
Test for Graduate Study in
Business.
Half the seniors applied to less
than five graduate schools but 54
applied to over 12 schools and
four sought admission to over 15
schools.
According to the survey 118

seniors applied for scholarships.
So far, 31 have accepted grants,
including seven National Science
Foundation winners and three
Rhodes scholars.
