# Under The Grandstand
## UCLA On Top Again 
### Stan Wilson 
Upon analyzing the Pac-Eight teams this season
from top to bottom, it is apparent that only one
position is secure—the league's top spot. That spot,
of course, belongs to seemingly invincible UCLA,
and after watching the Bruins demolish Oregon and
Oregon State last weekend it appears that no one in
the league is going to thwart Coach Wooden and his
Bruins in their quest for a seventh straight
conference championship.
Apparently the rest of the conference has come
to this realization also; on Dec. 12 of last year the
faculty representatives and athletic directors of the
eight conference schools voted to allow teams other
than the conference champion to compete in the
prestigious National Invitational Tournament held
at the end of each league season.
The chance to play in this tournament adds new
meaning to what was becoming a meaningless
conference race; Stanford coach Howie Dallmar and
his peers in the conference now have a realistic goal
to shoot for.
Southern Cal is conceded second-place in the
conference by many sportswriters, but the Trojans
have lost star forward Monroe Nash, and though
they slipped by Oregon and Oregon State last
weekend in Los Angeles, the Trojans will lose their
share of conference games this season.
While Washington coach Marv Harshman was in
bed with the flu Monday night, Stanford
demolished his Huskies 76-55 in Seattle. Stanford is
young and unpredictable—if they jell they could
capture second place; if they don't they could very
easily end up near the conference cellar.

Oregon State is probably the league's biggest
disappointment, while Beaver rival Oregon is the
league's biggest surprise.
Four Starters Return
OSU is 7-5 this season, with two of the losses
coming at the hands of ranked teams—UCLA and
Minnesota. The Beavers lost all-league guard Freddie
Boyd to graduation last season, but four starters
returned to a squad which tied for third place in the
conference last season.
Oregon occupied the conference cellar with a
dismal 0-14 record last season, but second-year
coach Dick Harter seems to have turned things
around a bit this year. The Ducks (7-5) are led by
freshman sensation Ron Lee and senior forward
"Cowboy" Doug Little, both averaging about 16
points a game. The Ducks dropped a one-point
decision to USC this weekend, but are capable of
beating anyone.
Stanford's strength this season is its height, as the
Cards display the tallest starting front line of any
team in the conference. The Cards have been
hampered by turnovers and some poor freethrow
shooting, which will have to improve if the Cards
are to win the close ones (and there will
undoubtedly be several close decisions). If Stanford
can beat USC this weekend, a NIT bid looms as a
possibility.

anchored the Card's defense this past season, was
named the outstanding defensive performer in the
Hula Bowl last Saturday afternoon.

BATTLE OF THE GIANTS—Seven-foot sophomore center Rich Kelley will lead the Cards in their quest to dethrone Ail-American Bill Walton
(6-11) and the UCLA Bruins, at Maples Pavilion on Friday night. The Bruins are gunning for their seventh straight Pac-Eight Championship, and
their seventh-straight NCAA crown, as well as the NCAA record for consecutive wins (60) owned by USF. Stanford will attempt to avoid being
victim number 56 for the Bruins.

beating anyone.
Stanford's strength this season is its height, as the
Cards display the tallest starting front line of any
team in the conference. The Cards have been
hampered by turnovers and some poor freethrow
shooting, which will have to improve if the Cards
are to win the close ones (and there will
undoubtedly be several close decisions). If Stanford
can beat USC this weekend, a NIT bid looms as a
possibility.

anchored the Card's defense this past season, was
named the outstanding defensive performer in the
Hula Bowl last Saturday afternoon.

BATTLE OF THE GIANTS—Seven-foot sophomore center Rich Kelley will lead the Cards in their quest to dethrone Ail-American Bill Walton
(6-11) and the UCLA Bruins, at Maples Pavilion on Friday night. The Bruins are gunning for their seventh straight Pac-Eight Championship, and
their seventh-straight NCAA crown, as well as the NCAA record for consecutive wins (60) owned by USF. Stanford will attempt to avoid being
victim number 56 for the Bruins.
Upon analyzing the Pac-Eight teams this season
from top to bottom, it is apparent that only one
position is secure—the league's top spot. That spot,
of course, belongs to seemingly invincible UCLA,
and after watching the Bruins demolish Oregon and
Oregon State last weekend it appears that no one in
the league is going to thwart Coach Wooden and his
Bruins in their quest for a seventh straight
conference championship.
Apparently the rest of the conference has come
to this realization also; on Dec. 12 of last year the
faculty representatives and athletic directors of the
eight conference schools voted to allow teams other
than the conference champion to compete in the
prestigious National Invitational Tournament held
at the end of each league season.
The chance to play in this tournament adds new
meaning to what was becoming a meaningless
conference race; Stanford coach Howie Dallmar and
his peers in the conference now have a realistic goal
to shoot for.
Southern Cal is conceded second-place in the
conference by many sportswriters, but the Trojans
have lost star forward Monroe Nash, and though
they slipped by Oregon and Oregon State last
weekend in Los Angeles, the Trojans will lose their
share of conference games this season.
While Washington coach Marv Harshman was in
bed with the flu Monday night, Stanford
demolished his Huskies 76-55 in Seattle. Stanford is
young and unpredictable—if they jell they could
capture second place; if they don't they could very
easily end up near the conference cellar.

Oregon State is probably the league's biggest
disappointment, while Beaver rival Oregon is the
league's biggest surprise.
Four Starters Return
OSU is 7-5 this season, with two of the losses
coming at the hands of ranked teams—UCLA and
Minnesota. The Beavers lost all-league guard Freddie
Boyd to graduation last season, but four starters
returned to a squad which tied for third place in the
conference last season.
Oregon occupied the conference cellar with a
dismal 0-14 record last season, but second-year
coach Dick Harter seems to have turned things
around a bit this year. The Ducks (7-5) are led by
freshman sensation Ron Lee and senior forward
"Cowboy" Doug Little, both averaging about 16
points a game. The Ducks dropped a one-point
decision to USC this weekend, but are capable of
beating anyone.
