# Frenchman's Terrace Sponsors Continue Federal Funding Fight
## 
### ROBERT BACON 
Sponsors of the Frenchman's
Terrace low/moderate-income housing
project are not giving up hope of
obtaining funding for the
development, but they admit that
prospects are bleak in the wake of a
moratorium on federal housing
subsidies.
The 18-month moratorium,
effective immediately, was announced
Monday by retiring Secretary of
Housing and Urban Development
(HUD), George Romney.
The Frenchman's Terrace plans,
developed by the Stanford-Midpenin
sula Urban Coalition, call for a
225-unit housing development on 20
acres of Stanford land at the corner of
Peter Coutts and Page Mill Roads.
Construction would have been funded,
and rents subsidized, by federal
subventions.
Alan Maremont, the Coalition's
Housing Consultant, said yesterday
that "We'll continue our efforts to get
funds .... We're asking people and
organizations to write to the White
House asking for special consideration
for Frenchman's Terrace."
Community Support
Asked the likelihood of an
exception to federal policy, he said,
"It depends entirely on the
community support we get."
Michael Grigoni, Assistant Planning
Director for the city of Palo Alto, said
city officials "will continue to protest

to the administration in any way we
can think of."
In answer to the question, "Is
Frenchman's Terrace dead?" Grigoni
said, "It looks to me that it's dead
unless there's a change in the
President's policy."
On Monday night, the Palo Alto
City Council endorsed letters
protesting the moratorium sent to
President Nixon by Mayor Kirke
Comstock and by a large group of civic
leaders led by Janet Owens of the
Midpeninsula Citizens for Fair
Housing.
Review Of Alternatives
Grigoni said yesterday that the City
staff would have additional comment
in one or two weeks after reviewing
the exact status of the fund
moratorium and alternatives open to
the city.
The Council Monday night
unanimously directed City staff to
"take whatever steps are deemed
desirable to maintain HUD funding."
Stanford's petition to annex the
Frenchman's Terrace site to Palo Alto
is pending before the City Council.
Future action on the petition is
uncertain in light of the moratorium.
Maremont noted that "final
disposition of the annexation will
probably be tied in with funding of
the development."
Stanford's Vice President for
Business and Finance, Robert R.
Augsburger, was attending a meeting

of University Trustees yesterday and
was unavailable for comment on the
future of Frenchman's Terrace.
Maremont said, "The land is
Stanford's. They have a two-year
commitment to hold the land for our
development. One of those two years
has expired. Beyond the two-year
commitment, it's their decision how
long they wish to hold the land for our
development."
Both Grigoni and Maremont
stressed that there is no alternative
source of funding for a project as large
as Frenchman's Terrace. If built, it
would be the largest subsidized
development in Santa Clara County.
