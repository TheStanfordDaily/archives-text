# USC—The New Enemy
## 
### JERRY COLEMAN Commentary 
Now that the football season is
over, it seems appropriate to make
an observation about a major
change—or realignment of
animosities—that has been taking
place in the Pac-8.
I could have made such a
commentary last fall, but in the
heat of the football season it
would have lost its objectivity.
Making it now, I have the added
advantage of being able to include
the past season to the
already-swollen pile of evidence.
There is change in the wind:
what was once a lively and often
bitter rivalry between Stanford
and Berkeley has been subdued
these last few seasons. And in its
place, I contend, now stands a
Stanford—USC feud.
In the realm of football alone,
this change appears obvious. Both
Stanford's increased capacity to
challenge and even beat the SC
machine, and the NCAA ruling
barring Cal from the Rose Bowl
help account for the realignment.
But in the whole elusive area of
football "spirit"—the traditions,
the pranks, the Bands, the entire
atmosphere of the
sport—Stanford's energy has been
directed South, not North.
I believe the Band aspect to be
a crucial one, for much of a
school's athletic philosophy is
reflected in its band. And living in
what could be called the Band
Frat has provided me with a ready
and fruitful source of
commentary on this question.
ITierefore, one night last week,
I went from room to room asking
any Bandsmen I met to answer
the questions, "Do you think SC
is the 'new enemy'?" and "If so,

why?" What follows is their
answers—some serious, some
tongue-in-cheek, but all of them
entertaining.
(My sources have asked to
remain anonymous, for fear of
violent reprisals directed upon
their bodies by any Cal or SC fans
in the readership of this
responsive metropolitan
newspaper.)
From an anonymous recent
former band manager: "Definitely
SC's the new enemy. But more
than the NCAA ban on Cal, it's
the pitting of two different
ideologies (Stanford and SC)
about what college football
should be. There has been a
redirection of priorities here and
at Cal toward athletics that has
de-emphasized the old rivalry."
Objective?
Continuing, "But SC, being the
animal factory that it is, has
tended to promote the high
school attitude toward football
and athletics in general. It's seen
even in their band with its
militaristic, Midwestern
approach." (Did I say "objective"
before?)
His saxophonist roommate
added, "When we travel to
Berkeley we watch out for Cal
guys stealing our dollies or
throwing buteric acid balloons. SC
doesn't even know what buteric
acid is. But they like to steal our
hats."
"My first game to Berkeley I
carried a knifp with me!" claimed
one Band old timer. Then all
agreed "It's hard to get keyed at
the Berkeley game; but we sure
get keyed for the trip south."
The 'Real Rival'
Next I talked to an anonymous
previous former band manager.

His answer: "In the last few years,
Cal has become a more benign
force. SC is the real rival. From
the band standpoint, it gets us up
for games to see them trying to
play the same music as we do but
in the old, hokey, traditional
method. So SC is a bigger target
for poking fun at than Cal."
Said an anonymous band drum
major, "Sure the Trojans are
rotten, especially when they're
ripped. But the Daily won't print
that."
A band freak then summed up
this phenomenon with an unusual
comparison: "As far as pranks go,
Cal's weenies haven't done much
for a longtime. And they never
touch the Band Shak. But this
fall, some SC guys managed to
break down the door of the Shak.
There's your new rival."
No Bonfire
So you've heard it all. Well
almost all; considering that there
was no bonfire last year, not
much of a Band march through
the City, and few Cal-Stanford big
game week pranks, some of us
here at Theta Xi suggest a change
in tradition.
Drop the big game week in
November with Cal and start one
in October with SC. For the SC
game, why not have a
homecoming, complete with
queen, escorts, a parade and floats
designed by the fraternities, and a
gala dance that night?
And to top it all off, the SC
homecoming queen and
Stanford's would fight it out on
the football field at halftime.
"No holds barred!" said one
Bandsman.
"And with spurs!" added
another.
How about it Stanford?

force. SC is the real rival. From
the band standpoint, it gets us up
for games to see them trying to
play the same music as we do but
in the old, hokey, traditional
method. So SC is a bigger target
for poking fun at than Cal."
Said an anonymous band drum
major, "Sure the Trojans are
rotten, especially when they're
ripped. But the Daily won't print
that."
A band freak then summed up
this phenomenon with an unusual
comparison: "As far as pranks go,
Cal's weenies haven't done much
for a longtime. And they never
touch the Band Shak. But this
fall, some SC guys managed to
break down the door of the Shak.
There's your new rival."
No Bonfire
So you've heard it all. Well
almost all; considering that there
was no bonfire last year, not
much of a Band march through
the City, and few Cal-Stanford big
game week pranks, some of us
here at Theta Xi suggest a change
in tradition.
Drop the big game week in
November with Cal and start one
in October with SC. For the SC
game, why not have a
homecoming, complete with
queen, escorts, a parade and floats
designed by the fraternities, and a
gala dance that night?
And to top it all off, the SC
homecoming queen and
Stanford's would fight it out on
the football field at halftime.
"No holds barred!" said one
Bandsman.
"And with spurs!" added
another.
How about it Stanford?
Now that the football season is
over, it seems appropriate to make
an observation about a major
change—or realignment of
animosities—that has been taking
place in the Pac-8.
I could have made such a
commentary last fall, but in the
heat of the football season it
would have lost its objectivity.
Making it now, I have the added
advantage of being able to include
the past season to the
already-swollen pile of evidence.
There is change in the wind:
what was once a lively and often
bitter rivalry between Stanford
and Berkeley has been subdued
these last few seasons. And in its
place, I contend, now stands a
Stanford—USC feud.
In the realm of football alone,
this change appears obvious. Both
Stanford's increased capacity to
challenge and even beat the SC
machine, and the NCAA ruling
barring Cal from the Rose Bowl
help account for the realignment.
But in the whole elusive area of
football "spirit"—the traditions,
the pranks, the Bands, the entire
atmosphere of the
sport—Stanford's energy has been
directed South, not North.
I believe the Band aspect to be
a crucial one, for much of a
school's athletic philosophy is
reflected in its band. And living in
what could be called the Band
Frat has provided me with a ready
and fruitful source of
commentary on this question.
ITierefore, one night last week,
I went from room to room asking
any Bandsmen I met to answer
the questions, "Do you think SC
is the 'new enemy'?" and "If so,

why?" What follows is their
answers—some serious, some
tongue-in-cheek, but all of them
entertaining.
(My sources have asked to
remain anonymous, for fear of
violent reprisals directed upon
their bodies by any Cal or SC fans
in the readership of this
responsive metropolitan
newspaper.)
From an anonymous recent
former band manager: "Definitely
SC's the new enemy. But more
than the NCAA ban on Cal, it's
the pitting of two different
ideologies (Stanford and SC)
about what college football
should be. There has been a
redirection of priorities here and
at Cal toward athletics that has
de-emphasized the old rivalry."
Objective?
Continuing, "But SC, being the
animal factory that it is, has
tended to promote the high
school attitude toward football
and athletics in general. It's seen
even in their band with its
militaristic, Midwestern
approach." (Did I say "objective"
before?)
His saxophonist roommate
added, "When we travel to
Berkeley we watch out for Cal
guys stealing our dollies or
throwing buteric acid balloons. SC
doesn't even know what buteric
acid is. But they like to steal our
hats."
"My first game to Berkeley I
carried a knifp with me!" claimed
one Band old timer. Then all
agreed "It's hard to get keyed at
the Berkeley game; but we sure
get keyed for the trip south."
The 'Real Rival'
Next I talked to an anonymous
previous former band manager.

tongue-in-cheek, but all of them
entertaining.
(My sources have asked to
remain anonymous, for fear of
violent reprisals directed upon
their bodies by any Cal or SC fans
in the readership of this
responsive metropolitan
newspaper.)
From an anonymous recent
former band manager: "Definitely
SC's the new enemy. But more
than the NCAA ban on Cal, it's
the pitting of two different
ideologies (Stanford and SC)
about what college football
should be. There has been a
redirection of priorities here and
at Cal toward athletics that has
de-emphasized the old rivalry."
Objective?
Continuing, "But SC, being the
animal factory that it is, has
tended to promote the high
school attitude toward football
and athletics in general. It's seen
even in their band with its
militaristic, Midwestern
approach." (Did I say "objective"
before?)
His saxophonist roommate
added, "When we travel to
Berkeley we watch out for Cal
guys stealing our dollies or
throwing buteric acid balloons. SC
doesn't even know what buteric
acid is. But they like to steal our
hats."
"My first game to Berkeley I
carried a knifp with me!" claimed
one Band old timer. Then all
agreed "It's hard to get keyed at
the Berkeley game; but we sure
get keyed for the trip south."
The 'Real Rival'
Next I talked to an anonymous
previous former band manager.

His answer: "In the last few years,
Cal has become a more benign
force. SC is the real rival. From
the band standpoint, it gets us up
for games to see them trying to
play the same music as we do but
in the old, hokey, traditional
method. So SC is a bigger target
for poking fun at than Cal."
Said an anonymous band drum
major, "Sure the Trojans are
rotten, especially when they're
ripped. But the Daily won't print
that."
A band freak then summed up
this phenomenon with an unusual
comparison: "As far as pranks go,
Cal's weenies haven't done much
for a longtime. And they never
touch the Band Shak. But this
fall, some SC guys managed to
break down the door of the Shak.
There's your new rival."
No Bonfire
So you've heard it all. Well
almost all; considering that there
was no bonfire last year, not
much of a Band march through
the City, and few Cal-Stanford big
game week pranks, some of us
here at Theta Xi suggest a change
in tradition.
Drop the big game week in
November with Cal and start one
in October with SC. For the SC
game, why not have a
homecoming, complete with
queen, escorts, a parade and floats
designed by the fraternities, and a
gala dance that night?
And to top it all off, the SC
homecoming queen and
Stanford's would fight it out on
the football field at halftime.
"No holds barred!" said one
Bandsman.
"And with spurs!" added
another.
How about it Stanford?
