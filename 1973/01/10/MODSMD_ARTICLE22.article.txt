# Hoopsters Earn Split In Washington
## 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
Stanford's first weekend of
Pacific Eight basketball didn't
really prove anything new. It is
still obvious that Coach Howie
Dallmar's cagers are tall, talented,
and unpredictable.
The Cards lost to lowly
Washington State Saturday night
in Pullman, shooting only 26
percent from the field in a 61-49
setback. But Monday night in
Seattle a rejuvenated Stanford
team surged to an early 24-2 lead
and coasted to an easy 76-55
victory over Washington's highly
rated Huskies.
Dallmar had a hard time
explaining his team's reversal. "We
really didn't play that poorly
against Washington State," he
explained. "It was just a cold
shooting night.
"Before the WSU game our
main problems had been turnovers
and free throw shooting. But
against WSU we only had six

turnovers and shot 11 for 12 from
the foul line."
Despite Stanford's
improvement in those two
categories, the Cards were
doomed by their miserable
shooting. Stanford connected on
only 19 of 72 field goal attempts,
including a pathetic 6 for 36 in
the second half.
Eight Minute Slump
Mark Gilberg's 20 foot jump
shot with 7:55 remaining was the
Cards' last score. "We got plenty
of good shots towards the end of
the game," said center Rich
Kelley, baffled by Stanford's
unbelievable eight minute scoring
drought.
Washington suffered from a
similar dry spell in the opening
minutes of Monday night's game
in Seattle. The Huskies didn't
score a field goal until almost 10
minutes into the game as Stanford
built a comfortable 22 point
advantage.
Kelley scored 24 points and
grabbed 17 rebounds in the game
and guards Mel Arterberry and
Bob Buell each added 10. "Kelley,
Arterberry, and JJuell played
exceptionally well," sr:d Dallmar.
Dallmar indicated that Buell,
who replaced Mark Gilberg in the
starting lineup Monday night,
would start again this weekend
against UCLA and USC. The
addition of the 6-6 '>tiell gives
Stanford a starting lineup
averaging 6-7.
Positive Attitude
Dallmar was cautiously
optimistic as he looked ahead to

this weekend's games. "We have a
much more positive attitude going
into the games against UCLA and
USC now that we don't have to
combat a height deficiency," he
said.
UCLA will be looking for its
56th straight victory Friday night
at Maples Pavilion but Dallmar
said that he plans to play a normal
game against the Bruins — no stall
or intricate defense.
"Against UCLA you just have
to play all phases of the game
well," he said. "You need a lot of
poise because the big guy
(Ail-American center Bill Walton)
rejects so many shots."
Dallmar also praised USC's
team, pointing out their size,
quickness, and surprising depth.
The Trojans are the only Pac-8
team besides UCLA that survived
the first weekend of conference
play without a loss.
Stanford is now 1-1 in Pac-8

action and 6-5 overall. "I'm
pleased with the way we've played
so far," Dallmar said, "although
I'm disappointed in our record
because of three losses in the last
30 seconds (Denver, Colorado
State, and Virginia Tech) and our
poor shooting night in Pullman.
"We've had 11 games so far —
seven on the road," Dallmar
continued. "You learn a lot
through experience and players
like Scott Trobbe, Pat Rusco,
Steve Shupe, and Tim Patterson
have come off the bench and
they're almost like starters."
Stanford's players, rejuvenated
by Monday night's victory, share
Dallmar's optimism. "We'll be
ready for UCLA now," said
Arterberrv. "I don't know if we'll
beat 'em, but we're going to go at
em.

Dallmar was cautiously
optimistic as he looked ahead to

this weekend's games. "We have a
much more positive attitude going
into the games against UCLA and
USC now that we don't have to
combat a height deficiency," he
said.
UCLA will be looking for its
56th straight victory Friday night
at Maples Pavilion but Dallmar
said that he plans to play a normal
game against the Bruins — no stall
or intricate defense.
"Against UCLA you just have
to play all phases of the game
well," he said. "You need a lot of
poise because the big guy
(Ail-American center Bill Walton)
rejects so many shots."
Dallmar also praised USC's
team, pointing out their size,
quickness, and surprising depth.
The Trojans are the only Pac-8
team besides UCLA that survived
the first weekend of conference
play without a loss.
Stanford is now 1-1 in Pac-8

action and 6-5 overall. "I'm
pleased with the way we've played
so far," Dallmar said, "although
I'm disappointed in our record
because of three losses in the last
30 seconds (Denver, Colorado
State, and Virginia Tech) and our
poor shooting night in Pullman.
"We've had 11 games so far —
seven on the road," Dallmar
continued. "You learn a lot
through experience and players
like Scott Trobbe, Pat Rusco,
Steve Shupe, and Tim Patterson
have come off the bench and
they're almost like starters."
Stanford's players, rejuvenated
by Monday night's victory, share
Dallmar's optimism. "We'll be
ready for UCLA now," said
Arterberrv. "I don't know if we'll
beat 'em, but we're going to go at
em.

Friday night will be anxious to see
the results.
Stanford's first weekend of
Pacific Eight basketball didn't
really prove anything new. It is
still obvious that Coach Howie
Dallmar's cagers are tall, talented,
and unpredictable.
The Cards lost to lowly
Washington State Saturday night
in Pullman, shooting only 26
percent from the field in a 61-49
setback. But Monday night in
Seattle a rejuvenated Stanford
team surged to an early 24-2 lead
and coasted to an easy 76-55
victory over Washington's highly
rated Huskies.
Dallmar had a hard time
explaining his team's reversal. "We
really didn't play that poorly
against Washington State," he
explained. "It was just a cold
shooting night.
"Before the WSU game our
main problems had been turnovers
and free throw shooting. But
against WSU we only had six

turnovers and shot 11 for 12 from
the foul line."
Despite Stanford's
improvement in those two
categories, the Cards were
doomed by their miserable
shooting. Stanford connected on
only 19 of 72 field goal attempts,
including a pathetic 6 for 36 in
the second half.
Eight Minute Slump
Mark Gilberg's 20 foot jump
shot with 7:55 remaining was the
Cards' last score. "We got plenty
of good shots towards the end of
the game," said center Rich
Kelley, baffled by Stanford's
unbelievable eight minute scoring
drought.
Washington suffered from a
similar dry spell in the opening
minutes of Monday night's game
in Seattle. The Huskies didn't
score a field goal until almost 10
minutes into the game as Stanford
built a comfortable 22 point
advantage.
Kelley scored 24 points and
grabbed 17 rebounds in the game
and guards Mel Arterberry and
Bob Buell each added 10. "Kelley,
Arterberry, and JJuell played
exceptionally well," sr:d Dallmar.
Dallmar indicated that Buell,
who replaced Mark Gilberg in the
starting lineup Monday night,
would start again this weekend
against UCLA and USC. The
addition of the 6-6 '>tiell gives
Stanford a starting lineup
averaging 6-7.
