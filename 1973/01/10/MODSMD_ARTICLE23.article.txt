Sniper Linked To Other Shootings
NEW ORLEANS — Police Supt. Clarence Giarrusso said
ballistics tests proved the weapon found beside a dead
sniper atop a hotel was the same .44 Magnum used to kill
a young police cadet and wound another policeman on
New Year's Eve.
Giarrusso also identified the sniper, killed by riflemen
aboard a helicopter Sunday night, as Mark Essex, 24, of
Emporia, Kan., said to have been living in the New
Orleans area about six months.
In a news conference shortly before a funeral for one
of the six victims of the sniper fire, Giarrusso said there
was evidence that Essex might have been acting alone, but
there also was evidence he may have been one of a group.
Citing ballistics tests, Giarrusso said the Magnum was
the weapon which cut down Police Cadet Alfred Harrell,
19, as he stepped in front of police headquarters 10 days
ago, and wounded Patrolman Edwin C. Hosli Sr. 18
minutes later a few blocks away.
That same weapon also was used Sunday in the
DownTown Howard Johnson Hotel by a gunman who
killed Dr. Robert Steagall, a guest at the hotel, and Asst.
Police Supt. Louis Sirgo.
Police stormed the hotel rooftop Monday, then
searched the entire building, but could find no trace of
any gunman other than Essex.
Giarrusso said police had reason to believe that there
would be trouble at Charity Hospital when Hosli and
Harrell were taken there.
"Firecrackers were popped in the basement of the
hospital," he said. "Some of our men responded to this
and almost simultaneously, as though planned, two men
went to the hospital with shotguns or rifles. They were
stopped by the police. One man got away and one was
arrested."
Paris Talks 'More Relaxed'
PARIS — Henry A. Kissinger and Hanoi's Le Due Tho
held the second meeting in their new round of secret
peace talks yesterday in an apparently more relaxed
atmosphere.
The two top negotiators met for six hours in an
American-owned villa in suburban St. Nom la Breteche.
They agreed to meet again on Communist ground this
afternoon, continuing the rotation of sites.
The two envoys resumed their talks Monday in an
atmosphere of icy confrontation following 12 days of
American bombing of the North Vietnamese heartland
and a suspension of the talks that lasted nearly four
weeks.
Kissinger, President Nixon's top national security aide,
and Tho, Hanoi's Politburo member, seemed more relaxed
at the end of yesterday's meeting. They smiled as they
walked separately past newsmen and photographers. They
again avoided meeting face to face in public view,
however, and there were no visible handshakes.

Both delegations maintained their news blackout and
divulged nothing of what was discussed.
The main obstacles to agreement are believed to be
South Vietnam's claim to sovereignty over all the South, a
cease-fire police force and the continued presence of
North Vietnamese troops in the South.
Court Upholds Tax Data Seizure
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court gave the
government power Tuesday to seize the private records of
taxpayers if they have been turned over to an accountant.
"There exists no legitimate expectation of privacy,"
said Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr. in the 7-2 decision, unless
the transfer was temporary.
The ruling went against a Roanoke, Va., restaurant
owner under investigation by the Internal Revenue
Service. She had challenged a subpoena of business
records that were in the hands of a local accountant who
prepared her returns.
"It is important in applying constitutional principles,"
said Powell, "to interpret them in light of the
fundamental interests of personal liberty they were meant
to serve.
"Respect for these principles is eroded when they leap
their proper bounds to interfere with the legitimate
interest of society in enforcement of its laws and
collection of the revenues."
Justice William O. Douglas, dissenting, said the ruling
"sanctions yet another tool of the ever-widening
governmental invasion and oversight of our private lives."
Since a taxpayer may invoke the Fifth Amendment if
he holds onto his records, the decision could discourage
people from seeking the help of professionals to prepare
complicated tax returns, Douglas added. The other
dissenter was Justice Thurgood Marshall.
Wholesale Prices Take Record Jump
WASHINGTON — Wholesale farm prices, which are
largely exempt from federal price controls, skyrocketed
6.8 percent in December for the biggest monthly jump in
more than a quarter of a century, the government said
yesterday.
At the White House, a spokesman said of the higher
farm prices: "We're going to take steps to deal with it."
Press Secretary Ronald Ziegler said the subject "will be
addressed in more detail" when the next phase of
economic controls is discussed, perhaps as early as this
week.
Today's Weather
Increasing cloudiness today with rain likely through
tomorrow. Little temperature change. Low tonight in the
upper 30s to 40s. Highs days in the 50s.

fundamental interests of personal liberty they were meant
to serve.
"Respect for these principles is eroded when they leap
their proper bounds to interfere with the legitimate
interest of society in enforcement of its laws and
collection of the revenues."
Justice William O. Douglas, dissenting, said the ruling
"sanctions yet another tool of the ever-widening
governmental invasion and oversight of our private lives."
Since a taxpayer may invoke the Fifth Amendment if
he holds onto his records, the decision could discourage
people from seeking the help of professionals to prepare
complicated tax returns, Douglas added. The other
dissenter was Justice Thurgood Marshall.
Wholesale Prices Take Record Jump
WASHINGTON — Wholesale farm prices, which are
largely exempt from federal price controls, skyrocketed
6.8 percent in December for the biggest monthly jump in
more than a quarter of a century, the government said
yesterday.
At the White House, a spokesman said of the higher
farm prices: "We're going to take steps to deal with it."
Press Secretary Ronald Ziegler said the subject "will be
addressed in more detail" when the next phase of
economic controls is discussed, perhaps as early as this
week.
Today's Weather
Increasing cloudiness today with rain likely through
tomorrow. Little temperature change. Low tonight in the
upper 30s to 40s. Highs days in the 50s.
Sniper Linked To Other Shootings
NEW ORLEANS — Police Supt. Clarence Giarrusso said
ballistics tests proved the weapon found beside a dead
sniper atop a hotel was the same .44 Magnum used to kill
a young police cadet and wound another policeman on
New Year's Eve.
Giarrusso also identified the sniper, killed by riflemen
aboard a helicopter Sunday night, as Mark Essex, 24, of
Emporia, Kan., said to have been living in the New
Orleans area about six months.
In a news conference shortly before a funeral for one
of the six victims of the sniper fire, Giarrusso said there
was evidence that Essex might have been acting alone, but
there also was evidence he may have been one of a group.
Citing ballistics tests, Giarrusso said the Magnum was
the weapon which cut down Police Cadet Alfred Harrell,
19, as he stepped in front of police headquarters 10 days
ago, and wounded Patrolman Edwin C. Hosli Sr. 18
minutes later a few blocks away.
That same weapon also was used Sunday in the
DownTown Howard Johnson Hotel by a gunman who
killed Dr. Robert Steagall, a guest at the hotel, and Asst.
Police Supt. Louis Sirgo.
Police stormed the hotel rooftop Monday, then
searched the entire building, but could find no trace of
any gunman other than Essex.
Giarrusso said police had reason to believe that there
would be trouble at Charity Hospital when Hosli and
Harrell were taken there.
"Firecrackers were popped in the basement of the
hospital," he said. "Some of our men responded to this
and almost simultaneously, as though planned, two men
went to the hospital with shotguns or rifles. They were
stopped by the police. One man got away and one was
arrested."
Paris Talks 'More Relaxed'
PARIS — Henry A. Kissinger and Hanoi's Le Due Tho
held the second meeting in their new round of secret
peace talks yesterday in an apparently more relaxed
atmosphere.
The two top negotiators met for six hours in an
American-owned villa in suburban St. Nom la Breteche.
They agreed to meet again on Communist ground this
afternoon, continuing the rotation of sites.
The two envoys resumed their talks Monday in an
atmosphere of icy confrontation following 12 days of
American bombing of the North Vietnamese heartland
and a suspension of the talks that lasted nearly four
weeks.
Kissinger, President Nixon's top national security aide,
and Tho, Hanoi's Politburo member, seemed more relaxed
at the end of yesterday's meeting. They smiled as they
walked separately past newsmen and photographers. They
again avoided meeting face to face in public view,
however, and there were no visible handshakes.

Both delegations maintained their news blackout and
divulged nothing of what was discussed.
The main obstacles to agreement are believed to be
South Vietnam's claim to sovereignty over all the South, a
cease-fire police force and the continued presence of
North Vietnamese troops in the South.
Court Upholds Tax Data Seizure
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court gave the
government power Tuesday to seize the private records of
taxpayers if they have been turned over to an accountant.
"There exists no legitimate expectation of privacy,"
said Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr. in the 7-2 decision, unless
the transfer was temporary.
The ruling went against a Roanoke, Va., restaurant
owner under investigation by the Internal Revenue
Service. She had challenged a subpoena of business
records that were in the hands of a local accountant who
prepared her returns.
"It is important in applying constitutional principles,"
said Powell, "to interpret them in light of the
fundamental interests of personal liberty they were meant
to serve.

their proper bounds to interfere with the legitimate

American bombing of the North Vietnamese heartland
and a suspension of the talks that lasted nearly four
weeks.
Kissinger, President Nixon's top national security aide,
and Tho, Hanoi's Politburo member, seemed more relaxed
at the end of yesterday's meeting. They smiled as they
walked separately past newsmen and photographers. They
again avoided meeting face to face in public view,
however, and there were no visible handshakes.

Both delegations maintained their news blackout and
divulged nothing of what was discussed.
The main obstacles to agreement are believed to be
South Vietnam's claim to sovereignty over all the South, a
cease-fire police force and the continued presence of
North Vietnamese troops in the South.
Court Upholds Tax Data Seizure
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court gave the
government power Tuesday to seize the private records of
taxpayers if they have been turned over to an accountant.
"There exists no legitimate expectation of privacy,"
said Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr. in the 7-2 decision, unless
the transfer was temporary.
The ruling went against a Roanoke, Va., restaurant
owner under investigation by the Internal Revenue
Service. She had challenged a subpoena of business
records that were in the hands of a local accountant who
prepared her returns.
"It is important in applying constitutional principles,"
said Powell, "to interpret them in light of the
fundamental interests of personal liberty they were meant
to serve.
"Respect for these principles is eroded when they leap
their proper bounds to interfere with the legitimate
interest of society in enforcement of its laws and
collection of the revenues."
Justice William O. Douglas, dissenting, said the ruling
"sanctions yet another tool of the ever-widening
governmental invasion and oversight of our private lives."
Since a taxpayer may invoke the Fifth Amendment if
he holds onto his records, the decision could discourage
people from seeking the help of professionals to prepare
complicated tax returns, Douglas added. The other
dissenter was Justice Thurgood Marshall.
Wholesale Prices Take Record Jump
WASHINGTON — Wholesale farm prices, which are
largely exempt from federal price controls, skyrocketed
6.8 percent in December for the biggest monthly jump in
more than a quarter of a century, the government said
yesterday.
At the White House, a spokesman said of the higher
farm prices: "We're going to take steps to deal with it."
Press Secretary Ronald Ziegler said the subject "will be
addressed in more detail" when the next phase of
economic controls is discussed, perhaps as early as this
week.
