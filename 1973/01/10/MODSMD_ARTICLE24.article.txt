# '72 Draft Inductions Cancelled

Special to The Daily
WASHINGTON — The Selective
Service System has told local draft
boards to cancel induction orders for
men who are members of the 1972
draft pool and who have received
induction postponements scheduled to
expire within the next two months.
The cancellations were ordered
following outgoing Secretary of
Defense Melvin Ft. Laird's decision not
to issue January or February draft
calls.
However, these men are being
placed in the extended priority group
and will be the first to be called should
there be a draft call in March.
"It takes the men off the hook
instead of leaving them with the
uncertainty of a draft order," said
Daniel J. Cronin, deputy draft director
in charge of operations.
If there is no draft call in March, all
68,000 of those in the extended
priority draft group will be free, and
any draftees in April, May or June will
come from a younger group of men
who received draft lottery numbers in
February, 1972.
Expires In June
Authority for the draft is scheduled
to expire June 30. Thereafter, the
Army will depend on volunteers and a
higher rate of reenlistment to maintain
its strength.
Cronin's decision to cancel draft
orders applies to men who would be
willing to serve in the Army as well as
conscientious objectors scheduled to
be assigned to alternative service.
In a related development, the
Department of Justice reports it has

more than 5000 Selective Service Act
indictments outstanding.The 5370
indictments cover both men who have
refused induction into the armed
services as well as others accused of
violating the Selective Service law.
About 4500 of those indicted
reportedly are fugitives.
Other Violations
The Justice Department also has
"several thousand" more alleged
Selective Service violations that must
be processed, according to officials in
the Justice Department's Internal
Security Division (ISD).
Several hundred people reportedly
have been indicted within the past
several months, according to the
Justice Department. However, officials
admit that there is little chance that
most of those indicted will ever be
brought to trial.
Recently, the Justice Department
has dropped numerous prosecutions if
a draft resister has agreed to report for
a late induction or to cooperate with
the Selective Service System by
performing alternative service as a
conscientious objector.
A. William Olson, the assistant
attorney general in charge of the ISD,
said, "It is department policy to
obtain manpower for the armed forces
whenever possible rather than to put
people in jail."
Policy Shift
This represents a considerable shift
in Justice Department policy, one that

appears to have accompanied the shift
of Selective Service prosecutions from
the department's Criminal Division to
the ISD early in President Nixon's first
term.
Of the 4500 indicted men listed as
draft refugees on Nov. 30, the
government believes that 2500 are in
Canada and 500 others are outside
United States jurisdiction, according
to the Washington Post. The remainder
cannot be located, and some are
presumed to be "underground" in the
U.S.
Of the nearly 5000 men prosecuted
for Selective Service violations in fiscal
1972 (which ended last June 30),
i642 were convicted and 327 were
acquitted after trial. Charges against
the remainder were dismissed, usually
following a "change of heart" on the
defendant's part, the Justice
Department said.
Recent government figures indicate
that the largest backlog of unprocessed
Selective Service cases are in
Minnesota, Northern California
(particularly the Bay Area), the
Detroit, Mich, area, New York City
and Buffalo, N.Y.
Government officials speculate that
draft resisters gather in Detroit and
Buffalo because of their closeness to
Canada — which recently tightened its
immigration laws — and San Francisco
because several federal judges there
have spoken out against the draft and
sentence resistors accordingly.
