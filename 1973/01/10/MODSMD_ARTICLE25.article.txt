Gov. Ronald Reagan has signed into law a bill which will permit
Stanford and other private colleges and universities to obtain construction
loans at substantially reduced interest rates.
The California Educational Facilities Authority, set up by the bill, will
issue tax-exempt bonds, and loan at cost the money so raised to colleges
and universities for building construction. Tax-exempt bonds, which only
agencies of state and local government are permitted to issoe, require
interest payments substantially smaller than those on normal, taxed bonds.
In addition to savings in interest payments, University officials note
that use of the Authority will permit construction of buildings without
waiting for a lengthy fund drive during which construction costs increase.
The bill, AB 2014, was sponsored in the Legislature by Assemblyman
Dixon Arnett (R.-Redwood City), a former Stanford administrator.
University officials had feared that Reagan might veto the measure.
President Richard Lyman in a Los Angeles address last night described
the measure as a way "to help us to help ourselves."
