# Trustees Approve Hospital Wing; Ratify Faculty Discipline Plan
## 
### ROBERT BACON 
University Trustees yesterday
authorized a $9.1 million expansion of
Stanford University Hospital, and
approved the controversial statement
on faculty discipline.
The hospital expansion, due for
completion in July 1975, will provide
enlarged and remodeled core support
facilities, including emergency room,
pharmacy, laboratories, X-ray, and
recovery rooms. It will also include a
25-bed intensive care unit.
Dr. Thomas A. Gonda, hospital
director, described the project as "a
catch-up phase." He said that the

present core facilities, opened in 1959,
are inadequate since the number of
beds, outpatient visits, and laboratory
tests has increased substantially since
the Hospital opened.
The new building will be built on
the site of the present ambulance
entrance and emergency room parking
lot, at the north end of the Medical
Center. The emergency room will be
relocated on the first floor of the new
addition; the present basement
emergency room facilities will be
remodeled to house the hospital
pharmacy.
The addition will contain 150,000

gross square feet of floor space. By
comparison, the existing core building
has 178,199 gross square feet. The
new building will have two
above-ground stories and an unfinished
basement. Until the subterrainean area
is completed, it will be used for
parking. Provision will be made for
adding a third story later.
In conjunction with the
construction, 32,000 square feet of
the present core building, including
the emergency facilities, will be
remodeled. Hospital officials stated
that construction will not disrupt
operation of the hospital emergency
room. The remodeling will be
completed by January 1976.
The new building will blend in
architecturally with the existing
Medical Center, according to sketches
by the architectural firm of Caudill,
Rowlett, Scott of Houston, Texas.
Groundbreaking is set for late May.
Soils tests on the site have already
begun.
Federal Loans
The structure will be financed by
federally guaranteed low-interest loans
and Medical Center building funds.
Caudill, Rowlett, and Scott are
presently preparing the Medical Center
master plan which will be unveiled in
about one year.
No specially-designed intensive care
facilities exist at the hospital at
present. An intensive care unit has

been formed from patient wards, but
hospital personnel see the need for an
intensive care unit with special
facilities to care for patients
undergoing complex medical and
surgical treatments.
Disciplinary System
In another action at their meeting
in Los Angeles, the Trustees approved
the controversial faculty disciplinary
system endorsed by the faculty in
November. The system will go into
effect immediately.
Principal changes from the existing
system are the specification of
categories of misconduct for which
sanctions may be imposed, and the use
of outside hearing officers, rather than
the seven-member Advisory Board of
senior professors, to take testimony on
questions of fact.
Critics, among them members of
the left-wing Faculty Political Action
Group (FPAG), claimed during
consideration of the new system that
it does not adequately protect the
rights of faculty accused of
misconduct.
Mail Ballot
The statement was approved in a
mail ballot of faculty last fall. The
statement was adopted 442-349.
As under the present system, the
Advisory Board will determine in each
case whether the facts constitute a
violation of regulations.


MEDICAL CENTER â€” Architects have developed this sketch of the $9.1 million
expansion of Stanford University Hospital, construction of which will begin in
late May. The Board of Trustees approved the facility yesterday. The building,
to be located on the north side of the Medical Center on the site of the present
emergency room parking lot, will contain a 25-bed intensive care unit, an

enlarged emergency room, and core support facilities for the 618-bed hospital. It
will nearly double the area devoted to core facilities at the hospital. Completion
is anticipated in mid-1975. In this photo, the existing hospital cafeteria is at far
right.
The University president's power to
overrule the Advisory Board's finding
of violation or recommendation of
sanction is continued in the new
statement without majoi change.
Development of a revised discipline
plan began in 1970 with study of the
subject by the Stanford chapter of the
American Association of University
Professors (AAUP).
