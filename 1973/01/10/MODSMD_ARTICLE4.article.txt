# Appel Proposes ASSU Course Review Board
## 
### 
ASSU Co-President Brent Appel
presented terms of a proposal
establishing an ASSU Course Review
Policy Board to the Student Senate
last night.
The Board, consisting of three
Senators, one vice-president chosen by
the Executive Officers Association,
and the Editor of the ASSU Course
Review, would be set-up to compile
the data collected on the 75 courses
examined last quarter. The Senate did
not have a quorum, however, and was
unable to take any action on the
proposal.
The Senators also discussed
proposals for handling refundable fee
laseasments for students. Some
Senators stated that the refunds
should be made available as soon as
possible in the quarter, preferably
during registration. They saw the
means of distribution as inefficient,
since fewer than 500 students

requested refunds last quarter.
Other Senators objected, however,
asserting that new students would not
understand the fee assessments and
claim their refund. This would cause
organizations benefiting from the
assessments to suffer.
The Senate also discussed an
election to fill the 11 vacant graduate
student seats. Elections Commissioner
Mike Nilsson submitted an estimated
cost of $190 to hold the election but
the Senate was unable to take any
action.
The new election system which will
take effect next fail provides for the
at-large election of 10 students each
from the undergraduate and graduate
divisions. This year's system
proportioned the Senate seats among
the academic departments, resulting in
the graduate vacancies in Humanities
and Sciences, Engineering and Earth
Science, Medicine, and Education.
