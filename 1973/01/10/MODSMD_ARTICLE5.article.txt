# Pauling Reaffirms Use Of Vitamin C
## 
### DAN BRENNER 
Advising an overflow crowd of 550
at Dinkelspiel auditorium last night to
"find out what molecules should be in
your body," Nobel laureate Linus
Pauling urged greater attention to
intake of chemicals for prevention of
disease.
"Life expectancy could rise to five
score years," predicted Pauling, if
people practiced "orthomolecular
medicine," the right medicines in the
right amount.
Pauling defended his controversial
thesis, developed in his book, Vitamin
C and The Common Cold that large
amounts of vitamin C can help to
prevent diseases. While conceding that
the book had not been taken seriously
in some circles at first, he reported
research conducted in the U.S. and
Sweden in 1972 indicating large doses
of the vitamin had reduced the
incidence of colds by 58 percent.
"You shouldn't listen to doctors or
medical columnists in the newspapers.
You should listen to me," he said, "I
know what the facts are because I'm a
chemist."
He said that he takes six grams of
Vitamin C a day.and suggested taking
extra tablets at the onset of a cold. As
if to prove his point, he popped an
ascorbic acid pill into his mouth in the
middle of the address.
Pauling discussed research which
showed a correlation between vitamin
C and polio and other viral diseases,
the amount of cholesterol in the body,
heart disease, back trouble, and cancer

of the bladder. Unlike other animals,
man is not equipped to produce his
own vitamin C.
In addition to underscoring the
importance of practicing preventive
medicine with vitamin C, he suggested
other ways to avoid poor health. He
advised agairtat smoking, observing

that a one-pack-a-day smoker takes in
a cupful of tar every year. Noting that
a three-pack-a-day smoker loses three
extra minutes of his life for every one
minute of smoking, he concluded,
"Unless you're four times as happy
daring five minutes of smoking, you
shoaMn' t smoke."

Routine X-rays, he also said,
"should not be permitted. It is better
to have a cavity develop in a child than
to have him X-rayed every six
months." He cautioned pregnant
women against being X-rayed; only 10
percent need X-rays, Pauling claimed.
He also urged that carriers of
sickle-cell anemia, a genetic disease
which primarily affects blacks, should
not bear children. "I'm not advocating
black genocide," he remarked. "I'm
advocating that the black people
improve themselves by eliminating the
sickle-cell gene."
He noted that people need to
change their attitudes towards what
chemicals they consume. "Don't take
marijuana, don't take drugs, don't
smoke cigarettes, and be careful of
alcohol," adding that "a small amount
of alcohol has been shown to increase
life expectancy."
He also suggested limiting the
amount of sucrose consumed. "There
is clearly a relation between intake of
sugar and heart disease."
And he discouraged purchasing
advertised medicines. He nojted that a
wholesale drug company in La Canada,
California, sells vitamin C at $7.50 per
kilogram, while some advertised
brands can cost 20 or 30 times as
much.
Pauling's address, part of the
University's Tuesday Evening Lecture
Series, was carried on loudspeakers
outside the auditorium to
accommodate about 200 persons who
could not get into the auditorium.

"should not be permitted. It is better
to have a cavity develop in a child than
to have him X-rayed every six
months." He cautioned pregnant
women against being X-rayed; only 10
percent need X-rays, Pauling claimed.
He also urged that carriers of
sickle-cell anemia, a genetic disease
which primarily affects blacks, should
not bear children. "I'm not advocating
black genocide," he remarked. "I'm
advocating that the black people
improve themselves by eliminating the
sickle-cell gene."
He noted that people need to
change their attitudes towards what
chemicals they consume. "Don't take
marijuana, don't take drugs, don't
smoke cigarettes, and be careful of
alcohol," adding that "a small amount
of alcohol has been shown to increase
life expectancy."
He also suggested limiting the
amount of sucrose consumed. "There
is clearly a relation between intake of
sugar and heart disease."
And he discouraged purchasing
advertised medicines. He nojted that a
wholesale drug company in La Canada,
California, sells vitamin C at $7.50 per
kilogram, while some advertised
brands can cost 20 or 30 times as
much.
Pauling's address, part of the
University's Tuesday Evening Lecture
Series, was carried on loudspeakers
outside the auditorium to
accommodate about 200 persons who
could not get into the auditorium.

VITAMIN C, ANYONE? — Speaking before an overflow crowd at Dinkelspiel
auditorium last night, Nobel laureate Linus Pauling advised his audience to pay
greater attention to the intake of chemicals for disease prevention. Pauling also
defended his controversial vitamin C thesis.
Advising an overflow crowd of 550
at Dinkelspiel auditorium last night to
"find out what molecules should be in
your body," Nobel laureate Linus
Pauling urged greater attention to
intake of chemicals for prevention of
disease.
"Life expectancy could rise to five
score years," predicted Pauling, if
people practiced "orthomolecular
medicine," the right medicines in the
right amount.
Pauling defended his controversial
thesis, developed in his book, Vitamin
C and The Common Cold that large
amounts of vitamin C can help to
prevent diseases. While conceding that
the book had not been taken seriously
in some circles at first, he reported
research conducted in the U.S. and
Sweden in 1972 indicating large doses
of the vitamin had reduced the
incidence of colds by 58 percent.
"You shouldn't listen to doctors or
medical columnists in the newspapers.
You should listen to me," he said, "I
know what the facts are because I'm a
chemist."
He said that he takes six grams of
Vitamin C a day.and suggested taking
extra tablets at the onset of a cold. As
if to prove his point, he popped an
ascorbic acid pill into his mouth in the
middle of the address.
Pauling discussed research which
showed a correlation between vitamin
C and polio and other viral diseases,
the amount of cholesterol in the body,
heart disease, back trouble, and cancer

of the bladder. Unlike other animals,
man is not equipped to produce his
own vitamin C.
In addition to underscoring the
importance of practicing preventive
medicine with vitamin C, he suggested
other ways to avoid poor health. He
advised agairtat smoking, observing

that a one-pack-a-day smoker takes in
a cupful of tar every year. Noting that
a three-pack-a-day smoker loses three
extra minutes of his life for every one
minute of smoking, he concluded,
"Unless you're four times as happy
daring five minutes of smoking, you
shoaMn' t smoke."

Routine X-rays, he also said,
"should not be permitted. It is better
to have a cavity develop in a child than
to have him X-rayed every six
months." He cautioned pregnant
women against being X-rayed; only 10
percent need X-rays, Pauling claimed.
