## Dog Problems 
### 
Between July 1970 and August 1972, 42 persons reported being
bitten by dogs on campus. Many more bites probably went unreported
and this is only the worst facet of an ever-growing problem.
In his fall quarter report released earlier this week, Ombudsman
Harvey Hall said that he had received a large number of complaints
about the campus dog situation.
One complainant focused on Tresidder Union which seems to have
become a day care center for campus dogs. He said, "I've often found
them (the dogs) a hassle at lunch, not just while fighting them off
(once unsuccessfully) to the detriment of peace and conversation, but
also while looking at big black-gummed jowls oozing with saliva
hanging patiently near me as I eat. Eating a Tresidder lunch is hard
enough already."
Fellow Tresidder eaters would surely echo this complaint. But
unfortunately, the problem is not limited to Tresidder alone. If the
Campus Judicial Panel prosecuted dogs for classroom disruptions, its
docket would be filled 24 hours a day. And rare is the bicyclist who
hasn't been involved in or barely avoided an accident with a dog.
Dog defecation is the most obvious nuisance of all. Besides the
health risks, piles of dogshit certainly aren't the most aesthetic
addition to the campus. And feces on sidewalks and stairs are an
obvious safety hazard. Dog owners should have enough concern for
others to clean up after their dogs in areas people frequent.
The problem is obvious, but the solution is not an easy one. Santa
Clara County has a leash law that requires dog owners to keep their
dogs on leashes which are not more than six feet long when they are
off their own private property. Hall recommends that this law be
well-publicized and then seriously enforced. Assistant to the President
John Schwartz has indicated that the University will fully cooperate
with the County Health Department's enforcement efforts.
Hopefully a massive dog roundup will not be necessary. But unless
owners begin to assume more responsibility with their dogs, such a
roundup will probably occur in the near future.
We feel that if dog owners keep closer watch on their dogs, there
won't be a need for strict enforcement of the leash law. If you know
where your dog is and don't let it aimlessly roam the campus all day,
the problems will be greatly reduced. We appreciate the need dogs
have for exercise and unrestricted play, but there are plenty of open
spaces on this campus where an owner can take his dog and let him
run free for as long as he wants. Dogs certainly get more enjoyment
out of romps in a field than in hanging around TMU.
There is obviously a problem with stray dogs as well. But we can
safely say that a large number of dogs who perpetuate these problems
belong to owners who should be responsible for their actions.
We don't want to see a dragnet of the campus by health officers
who will impound all unleashed dogs. But if all dog owners don't start
acting responsibly, that will soon become an unfortunate reality.
