# 'familiarity with horror'
## Shame Or Arlington's Bell 
### 
t david m. szonyi

I have been trying for several
days to write something on the
War, but nothing coheres; most
everything seems trite and deja
vu— the intellectual's tendency to
moralize and analyze when he
should perhaps simply be silent.
Still, one word keeps recurring in
my mind: shame. And with the
abstraction "shame" comes a vivid
sound—that of a bell ringing
relentlessly at 15 second intervals.
The bell belongs to a bitterly
cold night in Arlington, Virginia
during the November, 1969,
Moratorium. (Does anyone
remember the Fall, 1969
Moratoriums? They were only 38
months ago, but it sometimes
seems a psychic eon.) Each time it
rang, someone with a candle in
one hand, a placard with the name
of a dead GI around his neck,
began the long walk across the
Potomac, past Lincoln's dour
stare to shout a dead man's name
at the strobe-lit White House and
finally to drop the placard in one
of several gigantic caskets on the
Hill.
Here was the "death march"
and it took a full 24 hours for the
40,000 people "embodying" the
dead to wind their silent way
through the streets. (Behind
barricades of buses, the President
of the United States reportedly
watched football games on TV.) I
remember asking myself whether
there'd still be a need to march by
the time 1 graduated a year and a
half later. Today, were a similar
march held for all the dead, it

would take about five months.

The next afternoon, I
remember freezing near the
Washington Monument, chanting
with Pete Seeger and a half a
million other people, "All we are
saying/is give peace a chance."
From the cynical perspective of
the glum 70s, it all seems
curiously maudlin. Did we really
think we could end the war with
John Lennon's one-sentence
litany? More likely, we were
trying to ease the guilt and the
shame. It was futile then, as it
would probably be futile now, but
at least we were willing to
undergo the cold and boredom to
achieve solidarity or re-enforce
our anger, to go beyond guilt and
shame.
Now we are above such
sentimental ism and symbolism.
We write occasional letters and
columns and curse and shake our
heads at the TV nightmare/news,
but we also shrug our shoulders ad
nauseum as if to say, with Kurt
Vonnegut, "So it goes."
Familarity with horror, especially
modern technology's "antiseptic"
remote control type of horror,
breeds indifference and
acquiescence given time. And
we've had so much time to
become "used" to this war that
some of us can become nostalgic
about Arlington and its bell, can
yearn for the time when rage and
resolve competed with guilt and
shame in our psyches.

Someone in the Talmud's
extraordinary collection of
proverbs, parables, and other
compressed wisdom entitled
"Sayings of the Fathers" implores
us: "In a place where there are no
men, be a man." I keep wondering
whether/how it is really possible
to be a man given the soulless
nature of the times, the power
and aloofness of the destroyers,
and the often narcissistic nature of
academia.
But then we have to do
something, even if it's boring and
seems futile and absurd. For six
million have died or been
wounded in this war since
America entered it; the number
might be an abstraction were it
not so grotesquely familiar.
We must continually prod
ourselves and each other not to
forget our shame, and also not to
resign ourselves to it. We must
keep trying in every way not to be
"good Germans."
