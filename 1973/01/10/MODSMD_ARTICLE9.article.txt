## Value Of Auto Junkyards 
### 
larry hummer

I like auto junkyards. Ah ha,
you say, the Daily has finally got
a total incompetent writing a
column That's only because you
have never studied the pure
beauty of junk.
Drivers of older cars tend to be
more familiar with junkyards than
those who own the last word from
Motor City (be it Detroit or
Osaka). You can't just go to your
local Nash dealer and order a new
exhaust manifold to replace your
cracked one. Junkyards are
virtually your only source. And in
the Midpeninsula, we are blessed
with several.
When you don't have much,

you are careful to conserve what
you have—in the old days, you
bought your milk and soft drinks
in bottles that were "recycled,"
that is, re-washed, and re-filled.
Dealers abounded in scrap metal.
Many cities collected newspapers
separately from other trash so
that it could be re-processed
new paper.
Mass Abundance
But that was before the era of
mass abundance and production.
Simple economics killed off much
junk dealing and re-cycling.
Production became so cheap that
it was actually more costly to
salvage old articles than to
produce new ones. A new psyche
pervaded the land to the point
that even bottles with deposits
were not returned. Who needed
the crummy nickel?
But auto junkyards have not
died, and they won't until the last
old clunker gets off the road, and
since there are more clunkers
every year, the auto junkyard
seems to have immortality
assured.
Old junkyard hands will tell
you to bring a set of tools along
with you. Buying a part in a
junkyard is not often like buying
a new part in a store. Some of
them fancy up the business a little
by taking out a lot of the parts
and putting them, cleaned of dirt,
in a showroom. Most don't. You
want a part; you've got to take it
out of the junked car yourself.
Make sure to get the price before
you go to the trouble!
Local Paradise
Bay Road in East Palo Alto is
the local Paradise for old cars. It
has about a dozen separate yards.
Just the other day, I was out there
(again) at Ernie's, looking for an
obscure front seat frame for my
'62 Rambler Classic.
I walked up to the man on
duty, a grimy, good-natured
fellow who directed me to
"Rambler Row" at the back.
After that, I was on my own.
Walking through the piles of
smashed cars, broken glass, and
dead cats is literally to return to
an older America. I passed a
workman urinating in the open on
an old tire. He gave me a friendly

nod.
Rambler Row is a thing of
gentle beauty. One '61 had its rear
window smashed out completely,
but fragments on the edges
reflected the sun a crystalline
green. Russet brown springs
languished in the dark bay mud.
It is always startling to see how
much remains in good condition
on most of these cars. Many never
have been dented. If you stop and
think of all the man-hours of
work that went into creating each
car, it would be atrocious for that
effort to go to waste in a muddy
field.
Transplant Banks
But it is not going to waste.
Auto graveyards are perhaps
misnamed. More correctly, they
are organ transplant banks. My
sleek vehicle is on the road today
because of the sacrifices of, at last
count, five other Ramblers.
Lady Bird Johnson
notwithstanding, I enjoy looking
at the old model cars in
junkyards. Some are finned, some
have weird taillights. All are
testimony to the endless
extravagance of automobiles.
Many say that styling differences
are created by the Big Four
automakers for purposes of
monopoly product differentiation
and "planned obsolescence."
Surely that is important, but it is
not a sufficient explanation.
In a kind of paradoxical way
Americans have searched for
individual identity and status in
their mass-produced automobiles.
Styling makes cars different, more
"personal." The less
individualistic Japanese car
makers tend to copy each other's
designs, as any astute reader of
auto magazines knows.
Individualism shows up in the
organization of the auto
junkyards as well. Surely it would
be more efficient to have one
giant junkyard than several right
next to each other. But would the
grimy junk men like it?
The leftovers of a civilization
are a reflection of that
civilization. A junkyard is truly a
place for philosophers.

I like auto junkyards. Ah ha,
you say, the Daily has finally got
a total incompetent writing a
column That's only because you
have never studied the pure
beauty of junk.
Drivers of older cars tend to be
more familiar with junkyards than
those who own the last word from
Motor City (be it Detroit or
Osaka). You can't just go to your
local Nash dealer and order a new
exhaust manifold to replace your
cracked one. Junkyards are
virtually your only source. And in
the Midpeninsula, we are blessed
with several.
When you don't have much,

you are careful to conserve what
you have—in the old days, you
bought your milk and soft drinks
in bottles that were "recycled,"
that is, re-washed, and re-filled.
Dealers abounded in scrap metal.
Many cities collected newspapers
separately from other trash so
that it could be re-processed
new paper.
Mass Abundance
But that was before the era of
mass abundance and production.
Simple economics killed off much
junk dealing and re-cycling.
Production became so cheap that
it was actually more costly to
salvage old articles than to
produce new ones. A new psyche
pervaded the land to the point
that even bottles with deposits
were not returned. Who needed
the crummy nickel?
But auto junkyards have not
died, and they won't until the last
old clunker gets off the road, and
since there are more clunkers
every year, the auto junkyard
seems to have immortality
assured.
Old junkyard hands will tell
you to bring a set of tools along
with you. Buying a part in a
junkyard is not often like buying
a new part in a store. Some of
them fancy up the business a little
by taking out a lot of the parts
and putting them, cleaned of dirt,
in a showroom. Most don't. You
want a part; you've got to take it
out of the junked car yourself.
Make sure to get the price before
you go to the trouble!
Local Paradise
Bay Road in East Palo Alto is
the local Paradise for old cars. It
has about a dozen separate yards.
Just the other day, I was out there
(again) at Ernie's, looking for an
obscure front seat frame for my
'62 Rambler Classic.
I walked up to the man on
duty, a grimy, good-natured
fellow who directed me to
"Rambler Row" at the back.
After that, I was on my own.
Walking through the piles of
smashed cars, broken glass, and
dead cats is literally to return to
an older America. I passed a
workman urinating in the open on
an old tire. He gave me a friendly

nod.
Rambler Row is a thing of
gentle beauty. One '61 had its rear
window smashed out completely,
but fragments on the edges
reflected the sun a crystalline
green. Russet brown springs
languished in the dark bay mud.
It is always startling to see how
much remains in good condition
on most of these cars. Many never
have been dented. If you stop and
think of all the man-hours of
work that went into creating each
car, it would be atrocious for that
effort to go to waste in a muddy
field.
Transplant Banks
But it is not going to waste.
Auto graveyards are perhaps
misnamed. More correctly, they
are organ transplant banks. My
sleek vehicle is on the road today

count, five other Ramblers.

(again) at Ernie's, looking for an
obscure front seat frame for my
'62 Rambler Classic.
I walked up to the man on
duty, a grimy, good-natured
fellow who directed me to
"Rambler Row" at the back.
After that, I was on my own.
Walking through the piles of
smashed cars, broken glass, and
dead cats is literally to return to
an older America. I passed a
workman urinating in the open on
an old tire. He gave me a friendly

nod.
Rambler Row is a thing of
gentle beauty. One '61 had its rear
window smashed out completely,
but fragments on the edges
reflected the sun a crystalline
green. Russet brown springs
languished in the dark bay mud.
It is always startling to see how
much remains in good condition
on most of these cars. Many never
have been dented. If you stop and
think of all the man-hours of
work that went into creating each
car, it would be atrocious for that
effort to go to waste in a muddy
field.
Transplant Banks
But it is not going to waste.
Auto graveyards are perhaps
misnamed. More correctly, they
are organ transplant banks. My
sleek vehicle is on the road today
because of the sacrifices of, at last
count, five other Ramblers.
Lady Bird Johnson
notwithstanding, I enjoy looking
at the old model cars in
junkyards. Some are finned, some
have weird taillights. All are
testimony to the endless
extravagance of automobiles.
Many say that styling differences
are created by the Big Four
automakers for purposes of
monopoly product differentiation
and "planned obsolescence."
Surely that is important, but it is
not a sufficient explanation.
In a kind of paradoxical way
Americans have searched for
individual identity and status in
their mass-produced automobiles.
Styling makes cars different, more
"personal." The less
individualistic Japanese car
makers tend to copy each other's
designs, as any astute reader of
auto magazines knows.
Individualism shows up in the
organization of the auto
junkyards as well. Surely it would
be more efficient to have one
giant junkyard than several right
next to each other. But would the
grimy junk men like it?
The leftovers of a civilization
are a reflection of that
civilization. A junkyard is truly a
place for philosophers.
