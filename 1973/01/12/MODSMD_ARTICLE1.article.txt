# President Lifts Controls, Urges Voluntary Action

### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - President
Nixon yesterday lifted his
controversial wage-price controls,
except in the health and food
industries.
He told Congress he will rely
principally on voluntary efforts in
continuing his fight against inflation.
But he said firm regulations will be
continued "with special vigor for firms
involved in food processing and food
retailing."
In addition, mandatory aspects of
the now-abandoned Phase 2 control
program will continue to apply to
health services — doctor, dentist and
hospital bills.
In announcing that he was
abolishing the Phase 2 Price
Commission and Pay Board, Nixon
asked Congress to extend for one year
beyond a scheduled April 30
expiration the Economic Stabilization
Act that permits firm wage-price
ceilings.
Clobbered
Under the requested standby
authority, Secretary of the Treasury
George Shultz said, any companies or
unions that flout new voluntary
guidelines "are going to be clobbered."
In a special message to Congress,
Nixon set a goal of reducing the
nation's inflation rate to 2V6 percent or
less by the end of this year, while
boasting his past policies have already
produced "the lowest rate of inflation
of any industrial country in the free

world."
Nixon's dismantling of most of the
control machinery will lead, Shultz
said, to dramatic cutbacks in the
number of federal workers assigned to
policing wage-price restraints.
Rising Food Prices
While taking most of the teeth out
of the program, Nixon promised
Congress that "special efforts will be
made to combat inflation in areas
where rising prices have been
particularly troublesome, especially in
fighting rising food prices."
He said his anti-inflation program
would not be a total success "until its
impact is felt at the local supermarket
or corner grocery store."
Nixon was somewhat vague about
the wage-price guidelines he will
expect management and labor to
observe during the weeks and months
ahead.
"As a general guide, increases of
prices above presently authorized
levels should not exceed increases in
costs," his statement said.
Profit Margin
The document added that even if
costs go up, a firm would be expected
not to increase its profit margin over a
recent historical base.
"The existing general standards of
the Pay Board can be taken for the
present as a guide to appropriate
maximum wage increases unless and
until they are modified," the White
House said.

Under the old rules, pay hikes
generally were to be limited to a
maximum of s'/2 percent a year.
Nixon announced he was
establishing a management-labor
advisory committee, with AFL-CIO
President George Meany as a member,
to advise the Cost of Living Council on
possible modifications in pay
standards.
Meany and other representatives of
organized labor had long complained
that the Phase 2 program permitted
disproportionate price increases at the
expense of wage earners.
