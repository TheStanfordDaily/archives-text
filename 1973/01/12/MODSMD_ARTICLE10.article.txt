## Universities In Conflict 
###

Life at Columbia is not as
gentlemanly or as benign as the
reports of old grads suggest it
once may have been. But the same
is true of all universities and of
the quality of life in the United
States generally.
When the explosion occurred
in 1968, many Columbia people
were inclined to think of it as a
parochial tragedy rather than a
signal foreshadowing a vast
transformation of American life as
students everywhere registered
powerful objections to the

patterns and directions previously
set down by America's
educational leaders. Students
began to bring withering
moralistic criticism against
universities.
In this instance it had
happened earlier at Berkeley, but
Berkeley and Columbia were the
bellwethers. Eventually it
happened nearly everywhere else
in the western world, and in Japan
and China as well. Most of us now
understand that we are living
through an era that future
historians will describe in terms
similar to those we reserve for the
Renaissance or the Industrial
Revolution.
Disputes With Blacks
The scale and character of the
events in this era have changed
recently, however. They tend now
to be small-scale contentions with
so-called "liberation movements."
It began several years ago in
disputes with black students over
the intellectual and fiscal
resources that universities were
able to devote to black studies
and to community programs.
Other groups harboring similar
although perhaps less intense
feelings of alienation, have
watched the effort conducted by
organized black students very
carefully.
During the last several years a
number of such groups have
broken away from campus radical
coalitions, setting off liberation
movements based on highly
particularized social objectives.
They have been moving to define
their own status, using the same
techniques of self-awareness,
confrontation, and moral pressure
employed earlier by black
students in achieving their
objectives. Their ostensible goal is
social change x but in a deeper
sense self-acceptance seems also to
be at issue.
We have found ourselves drawn
unwillingly into disputes on a
variety of different issues
generated by the special sense of
oppression felt by each group, and
by their need to confront the
Administration in order to achieve

both unity and identity through
struggle.
These developments seem to be
latter day ramifications of the
powerful social changes first
wrought by the civil rights
movement more than a decade
ago. The effects continue to
unfold across the whole range of
American society and are
particularly noticeable in the
avant-garde egalitarian atmosphere
provided by modern campus life.
Universities seem to be movihg
into a new role as society's special
laboratory.

Life at Columbia is not as
gentlemanly or as benign as the
reports of old grads suggest it
once may have been. But the same
is true of all universities and of
the quality of life in the United
States generally.
When the explosion occurred
in 1968, many Columbia people
were inclined to think of it as a
parochial tragedy rather than a
signal foreshadowing a vast
transformation of American life as
students everywhere registered
powerful objections to the

patterns and directions previously
set down by America's
educational leaders. Students
began to bring withering
moralistic criticism against
universities.
In this instance it had
happened earlier at Berkeley, but
Berkeley and Columbia were the
bellwethers. Eventually it
happened nearly everywhere else
in the western world, and in Japan
and China as well. Most of us now
understand that we are living
through an era that future
historians will describe in terms
similar to those we reserve for the
Renaissance or the Industrial
Revolution.
Disputes With Blacks
The scale and character of the
events in this era have changed
recently, however. They tend now
to be small-scale contentions with
so-called "liberation movements."
It began several years ago in
disputes with black students over
the intellectual and fiscal
resources that universities were
able to devote to black studies
and to community programs.
Other groups harboring similar
although perhaps less intense
feelings of alienation, have
watched the effort conducted by
organized black students very
carefully.
During the last several years a
number of such groups have
broken away from campus radical
coalitions, setting off liberation
movements based on highly
particularized social objectives.
They have been moving to define
their own status, using the same
techniques of self-awareness,
confrontation, and moral pressure
employed earlier by black
students in achieving their
objectives. Their ostensible goal is
social change x but in a deeper
sense self-acceptance seems also to
be at issue.
We have found ourselves drawn
unwillingly into disputes on a
variety of different issues
generated by the special sense of
oppression felt by each group, and
by their need to confront the
Administration in order to achieve

both unity and identity through
struggle.
These developments seem to be
latter day ramifications of the
powerful social changes first
wrought by the civil rights
movement more than a decade
ago. The effects continue to
unfold across the whole range of
American society and are
particularly noticeable in the
avant-garde egalitarian atmosphere
provided by modern campus life.
Universities seem to be movihg
into a new role as society's special
