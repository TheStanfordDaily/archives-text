Sickle-Cell Anemia
Editor:
In the Stanford Daily for
Wednesday, Jan. 10, there is an
article about my lecture in
Dinkelspiel auditorium, in which
there are statements about
sickle-cell anemia that, unless
clarified, may be misleading to the
readers.
In the article there is the
paragraph "He also urged that
carriers of sickle-cell anemia, a
genetic disease which primarily
affects blacks, should not bear
children. 'I'm not advocating
black genocide,' he remarked. 'I'm
advocating that the black people
improve themselves by eliminating
the sickle-cell gene.' "
I did not advocate that carriers
of sickle-cell anemia should
always refrain from bearing
children. I said that I urged
carriers of this gene not to marry
one another, or, if they married
one another, not to have children:
but, if a carrier married another
person without the gene, I
recommended that this couple
have a smaller than average
number of children, perhaps only
one child, in order that in the
course of time the gene would be
removed from the pool of human
germ plasm.
Moreover, I mentioned that I
advocated exactly the same
procedure for white people who
carry deleterious genes of this
sort. There are a good number of
white people who carry the gene
for sickle-cell aneamia, and I make
the same recommendation to
them. Also, I mentioned
explicitly the gene for
phenylketonuria, which seems to
have higher incidence among
whites than among blacks. I
recommend that carriers of this
gene, if two of them marry one
another, not have children, and
that if a carrier marries a person
who does not have the gene, the

number of children be less than
the average.
These recommendations are
designed to diminish the amount
of human suffering caused by
these serious genes.
Linus Pauling,
Professor of Chemistry
Penalty For Dog Owners
Editor:
The gist of your editorial, as it
should be, was that the dog owner
is responsible for his dog. The
only solution to the nuisance of
the dog on campus is to have old
fashioned dog-catchers enforce
the law, which is that dogs must
be on leash and under their
owner's surveillance at all times.
The students who bring their dogs
on campus in defiance of the law
should be made to accept their
responsibility toward the rest of
the community, which is, that no
one has the right to perpetrate a
nuisance on others.
Why not a real penalty, such as
refusal of the university to register
a student who persists in bringing
an unleashed dog on campus?
There are stiff penalties in the
"real world" and the students
might as well begin to learn that
now if they didn't know it when
they first came to Stanford.
Furthermore, anyone who
really loves his pet wouldn't let it
run unsupervised all day long (or
as some have done, tie it up on a
short leash on a wet patch of
ground for hours). I have to work
all day, I love dogs and would
dearly enjoy having one as a pet,
but I won't get one simply
because I cannot give it the proper
care; so you see, I am not just a
crank who is mad at the
thoughtless owners of the campus
dog pack.

whites than among blacks. I
recommend that carriers of this
gene, if two of them marry one
another, not have children, and
that if a carrier marries a person
who does not have the gene, the

number of children be less than
the average.
These recommendations are
designed to diminish the amount
of human suffering caused by
these serious genes.

Penalty For Dog Owners
Editor:
The gist of your editorial, as it
should be, was that the dog owner
is responsible for his dog. The
only solution to the nuisance of
the dog on campus is to have old
fashioned dog-catchers enforce
the law, which is that dogs must
be on leash and under their
owner's surveillance at all times.
The students who bring their dogs
on campus in defiance of the law
should be made to accept their
responsibility toward the rest of
the community, which is, that no
one has the right to perpetrate a
nuisance on others.
Why not a real penalty, such as
refusal of the university to register
a student who persists in bringing
an unleashed dog on campus?
There are stiff penalties in the
"real world" and the students
might as well begin to learn that
now if they didn't know it when
they first came to Stanford.
Furthermore, anyone who
really loves his pet wouldn't let it
run unsupervised all day long (or
as some have done, tie it up on a
short leash on a wet patch of
ground for hours). I have to work
all day, I love dogs and would
dearly enjoy having one as a pet,
but I won't get one simply
because I cannot give it the proper
care; so you see, I am not just a
crank who is mad at the
thoughtless owners of the campus
dog pack.

Sickle-Cell Anemia
Editor:
In the Stanford Daily for
Wednesday, Jan. 10, there is an
article about my lecture in
Dinkelspiel auditorium, in which
there are statements about
sickle-cell anemia that, unless
clarified, may be misleading to the
readers.
In the article there is the
paragraph "He also urged that
carriers of sickle-cell anemia, a
genetic disease which primarily
affects blacks, should not bear
children. 'I'm not advocating
black genocide,' he remarked. 'I'm
advocating that the black people
improve themselves by eliminating
the sickle-cell gene.' "
I did not advocate that carriers
of sickle-cell anemia should
always refrain from bearing
children. I said that I urged
carriers of this gene not to marry
one another, or, if they married
one another, not to have children:
but, if a carrier married another
person without the gene, I
recommended that this couple
have a smaller than average
number of children, perhaps only
one child, in order that in the
course of time the gene would be
removed from the pool of human
germ plasm.
Moreover, I mentioned that I
advocated exactly the same
procedure for white people who
carry deleterious genes of this
sort. There are a good number of
white people who carry the gene
for sickle-cell aneamia, and I make
the same recommendation to
them. Also, I mentioned
explicitly the gene for
phenylketonuria, which seems to
have higher incidence among
whites than among blacks. I
recommend that carriers of this
gene, if two of them marry one
another, not have children, and
that if a carrier marries a person
who does not have the gene, the

number of children be less than
the average.
These recommendations are
