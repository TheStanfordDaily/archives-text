# no february draft call
## Inductions Likely In March ROUGH DRAFT 
### 
»peter hanawalt

Two recent announcements on
the draft clarify the immediate
induction situation and give a
more definite projection of draft
calls for the next six months.
First, Defense Secretary Laird
stated that there will be no
February draft call. This
announcement extends the
current period of no draft calls to
two months, and complicates the
issue of whether 1973 draftees
will come from the Extended
Priority Group or the First
Priority Group.
Second. Laird told the House
Armed Services Committee on
Jan. 8, "I now estimate that in
March, fewer than 2,500 men will
be drafted, and for the next
quarter, which ends on July 1, no
more than an average of 1,000
men per month will be needed."
From this statement, it appears
almost definite that there will be a
March draft call; however,
Selective Service has not
confirmed this, nor has it
announced a lottery number
cutoff for such a call.
The immediate effect of the
decision for no February call is
the cancellation of many
induction orders that were issued
sometime in 1972, and postponed
until January or February. On
Jan. 2, Selective Service
announced that local boards have
been instructed to notify men
with such outstanding orders that
they have been cancelled.
Extended Priority
Men whose induction orders
are cancelled under these
instructions will be considered
members of the Extended Priority
Group. They will be eligible to
again be issued induction orders if
a March draft call is announced.
Selective Service has stated
that the Extended Priority Group
(of men carried over from 1972)
now contains about 68,000 men.
A March draft call of less than
2,500 men, as Laird estimated,
would almost certainly be filled
from the Extended Priority' alone,
without calling from the 1973
First Priority Group. Selective
Service might even have to set a
cutoff number within the
Extended Priority (between
numbers 1 and 9b) in order to
limit inductions to 2,500.
March 31
Selective Service has recently
referred to March 31 as a deadline
for drafting the Extended
Priority. However, the reasons for
this statement are not clear. The
specific regulation (which has
been changed from last
year—when March 31 ivas the
deadline) now defines a period of
90 consecutive days of full
availability during which a man
can bo ordered to report for

induction or alternate service. For
instance, if a man in Extended
Priority doesn't complete his
appeal or physical processing until
Feb. 2, and is thus not "fully
available" to be drafted until
then, he is vulnerable to induction
until May 3.
A March draft call would
probably prevent most Extended
Priority men from escaping
induction or alternate service by
this means. These men would
either be issued orders to report
during March, or if not "fully
available" to be ordered, they
would be rendered liable for
induction in subsequent months.

On the other hand, if there is
no March draft call Selective
Service might administratively let
the Extended Priority off the
hook by establishing March 31 as
an arbitrary deadline.
In early 1972 over 125,000
men in the Extended Priority
escaped induction and alternate
service because of the absence of
draft calls for the first three
months. With the strong

likelihood of a March draft call
this year, however, it does not
appear that this loophole will
exist in 1973.
First Priority
While induction now appears
more likely for men in the
Extended Priority Group, men in
the 1973 First Priority Group are
not much closer to knowing
whether or not they will be
drafted this year.
The total of fewer than 5,500
men to be drafted by June
replaces the 10,000 man estimate
made by Laird last November. It
seems reasonable to believe that

5,500 men could be drafted from
a total of 68,000 in the Extended
Priority, but Selective Service has
not ruled out drafting men from
the 1973 pool. Spokesmen for the
system previously stated that
anyone with a lottery number
over 40 in the 1973 pool could
consider himself safe from the
draft.

Priority Group.
Second. Laird told the House
Armed Services Committee on
Jan. 8, "I now estimate that in
March, fewer than 2,500 men will
be drafted, and for the next
quarter, which ends on July 1, no
more than an average of 1,000
men per month will be needed."
From this statement, it appears
almost definite that there will be a
March draft call; however,
Selective Service has not
confirmed this, nor has it
announced a lottery number
cutoff for such a call.
The immediate effect of the
decision for no February call is
the cancellation of many
induction orders that were issued
sometime in 1972, and postponed
until January or February. On
Jan. 2, Selective Service
announced that local boards have
been instructed to notify men
with such outstanding orders that
they have been cancelled.
Extended Priority
Men whose induction orders
are cancelled under these
instructions will be considered
members of the Extended Priority
Group. They will be eligible to
again be issued induction orders if
a March draft call is announced.
Selective Service has stated
that the Extended Priority Group
(of men carried over from 1972)
now contains about 68,000 men.
A March draft call of less than
2,500 men, as Laird estimated,
would almost certainly be filled
from the Extended Priority' alone,
without calling from the 1973
First Priority Group. Selective
Service might even have to set a
cutoff number within the
Extended Priority (between
numbers 1 and 9b) in order to
limit inductions to 2,500.
March 31
Selective Service has recently
referred to March 31 as a deadline
for drafting the Extended
Priority. However, the reasons for
this statement are not clear. The
specific regulation (which has
been changed from last
year—when March 31 ivas the
deadline) now defines a period of
90 consecutive days of full
availability during which a man
can bo ordered to report for

induction or alternate service. For
instance, if a man in Extended
Priority doesn't complete his
appeal or physical processing until
Feb. 2, and is thus not "fully
available" to be drafted until
then, he is vulnerable to induction
until May 3.
A March draft call would
probably prevent most Extended
Priority men from escaping
induction or alternate service by
this means. These men would
either be issued orders to report
during March, or if not "fully
available" to be ordered, they
would be rendered liable for
induction in subsequent months.

On the other hand, if there is
no March draft call Selective
Service might administratively let
the Extended Priority off the
hook by establishing March 31 as
an arbitrary deadline.
In early 1972 over 125,000
men in the Extended Priority
escaped induction and alternate
service because of the absence of
draft calls for the first three
months. With the strong

likelihood of a March draft call
this year, however, it does not
appear that this loophole will
exist in 1973.
First Priority
While induction now appears
more likely for men in the
Extended Priority Group, men in
the 1973 First Priority Group are
not much closer to knowing
whether or not they will be
drafted this year.
The total of fewer than 5,500
men to be drafted by June
replaces the 10,000 man estimate
made by Laird last November. It
seems reasonable to believe that

5,500 men could be drafted from
a total of 68,000 in the Extended
Priority, but Selective Service has
not ruled out drafting men from
the 1973 pool. Spokesmen for the
system previously stated that
anyone with a lottery number
over 40 in the 1973 pool could
consider himself safe from the
draft.
