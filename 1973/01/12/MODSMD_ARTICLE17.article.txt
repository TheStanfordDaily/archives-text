# Stickney Presents Millay
## 
### 
Tonight, one of the first ladies
of the theater, Dorothy Stickney,
will make her Northern California
debut in her one-woman show on
Kdna St. Vincent Millay, "A
Lovely Light." Only once before,
in Los Angeles' Huntington
Theater, has Miss Stickney given
her award-winning show on the
West Coast.
The show opened in 1960 in
New York to unanimously rave
reviews. Since then, Miss Stickney
has performed it in London, in a
one-hour television version for the
Festival of Performing Arts, and,
now, in theaters from coast to
coast.
Miss Stickney first developed
the idea of doing a show on Millay
after reading her book of letters.
Millay's poetry had always
fascinated her. "She was," Miss
Stickney explained, "the first
poet ever to belong to 'me' rather
than to a class of literature. She
spoke for us."
The show took seven years to
work out. Miss Stickney
considered everything from extra
characters to mood music. Deems
Taylor wrote background music

for the show, but somehow the
lavish production didn't seem
appropriate.
'Keep It Simple'
It was Fmlyn Williams, a
master of the one-man show, who
convinced Miss Stickney to "keep
it simple." She does just that. She
uses Millay's letters to tell the
story of her life and her poetry to
give it depth. She adds her own
connecting words only when
necessary.
The production set consists of
a desk, a wing chair, and a garden
bench. Miss Stickney does not try
to imitate Millay. She rather acts
as the medium to transmit
Millay's thought to the audience's
imagination. What emerges is a
delicately dramatized biography.
Miss Stickney belongs to that
group of performers known as
"seasoned veterans." She has been
acting ever since she graduated
from North Western Dramatic
Sch 001.
Every Facet
Starting with a barnstorming
tour of her native North Dakota
as one of the "Southern Belles" in
a revue, she became involved in
1 every facet of acting, from a
member of a short-lived vaudeville
show, to the lead in the
longest-running play on
Broadway, "Life with Father," to
, the star of "The Homecoming,"
the CBS special-pilot show for
"The Waltons."
Her first famous role came as

Mollie Malloy in "The Front
Page." From then on, New York
audiences saw much of her.
Undoubtedly, her most famous
part was that of Vinnie in "Life
with Father"; her husband,
Howard Lindsay, co-starred with
her and co-authored the play with
Russell Crouse.
The play ran for eight
years—during the Second World
War. Miss Stickney and Mr.
Lindsay received the 1939-40
Drama League Award for "the
most enjoyable performances of
the season."
Few Forays
Miss Stickney has, by choice,
centered her career around the
New York stage. Except for a few
forays into movies in the 1930s
and her 1958 portrayal of maiden
"Aunt Jane Pennypacker"
opposite Clifton Webb in the
"Remarkable Mr. Pennypacker,"
she has steered clear of
Hollywood. She explains, "New
York is my home. I didn't want to
move to the West Coast," as any
standard seven-year contract
would have necessitated.
Miss Stickney has no such
qualms about her present show. "I
would adore to do it on the West
Coast," she insists, both at
colleges and community theaters.
Although Miss Stickney has no
definite plans for a tour, perhaps
tonight's show will be the first of
several future West Coast
engagements.


ONE-WOMAN SHOW—Dorothy Stickney presents a performance of
works by Edna St. Vincent Millay tonight in Dinkelspiel. Tickets are
$4 general admission, $3.25 for students.

several future West Coast
engagements.


ONE-WOMAN SHOW—Dorothy Stickney presents a performance of
works by Edna St. Vincent Millay tonight in Dinkelspiel. Tickets are
$4 general admission, $3.25 for students.
Tonight, one of the first ladies
of the theater, Dorothy Stickney,
will make her Northern California
debut in her one-woman show on
Kdna St. Vincent Millay, "A
Lovely Light." Only once before,
in Los Angeles' Huntington
Theater, has Miss Stickney given
her award-winning show on the
West Coast.
The show opened in 1960 in
New York to unanimously rave
reviews. Since then, Miss Stickney
has performed it in London, in a
one-hour television version for the
Festival of Performing Arts, and,
now, in theaters from coast to
coast.
Miss Stickney first developed
the idea of doing a show on Millay
after reading her book of letters.
Millay's poetry had always
fascinated her. "She was," Miss
Stickney explained, "the first
poet ever to belong to 'me' rather
than to a class of literature. She
spoke for us."
The show took seven years to
work out. Miss Stickney
considered everything from extra
characters to mood music. Deems
Taylor wrote background music

for the show, but somehow the
lavish production didn't seem
appropriate.
'Keep It Simple'
It was Fmlyn Williams, a
master of the one-man show, who
convinced Miss Stickney to "keep
it simple." She does just that. She
uses Millay's letters to tell the
story of her life and her poetry to
give it depth. She adds her own
connecting words only when
necessary.
The production set consists of
a desk, a wing chair, and a garden
bench. Miss Stickney does not try
to imitate Millay. She rather acts
as the medium to transmit
Millay's thought to the audience's
imagination. What emerges is a
delicately dramatized biography.
Miss Stickney belongs to that
group of performers known as
"seasoned veterans." She has been
acting ever since she graduated
from North Western Dramatic
Sch 001.
Every Facet
Starting with a barnstorming
tour of her native North Dakota
as one of the "Southern Belles" in
a revue, she became involved in
1 every facet of acting, from a
member of a short-lived vaudeville
show, to the lead in the
longest-running play on
Broadway, "Life with Father," to
, the star of "The Homecoming,"
the CBS special-pilot show for
"The Waltons."
Her first famous role came as

Mollie Malloy in "The Front
Page." From then on, New York
audiences saw much of her.
Undoubtedly, her most famous
part was that of Vinnie in "Life
with Father"; her husband,
Howard Lindsay, co-starred with
her and co-authored the play with
Russell Crouse.
The play ran for eight
years—during the Second World
War. Miss Stickney and Mr.
Lindsay received the 1939-40
Drama League Award for "the
most enjoyable performances of
the season."
Few Forays
Miss Stickney has, by choice,
centered her career around the
New York stage. Except for a few
forays into movies in the 1930s
and her 1958 portrayal of maiden
"Aunt Jane Pennypacker"
opposite Clifton Webb in the
"Remarkable Mr. Pennypacker,"
she has steered clear of
Hollywood. She explains, "New
York is my home. I didn't want to
move to the West Coast," as any
standard seven-year contract
would have necessitated.
Miss Stickney has no such
qualms about her present show. "I
would adore to do it on the West
Coast," she insists, both at
colleges and community theaters.
Although Miss Stickney has no
definite plans for a tour, perhaps
tonight's show will be the first of
several future West Coast
engagements.
