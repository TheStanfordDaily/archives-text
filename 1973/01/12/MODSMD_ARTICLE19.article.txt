Obscenities by Michael Casey,
N. Y., Warnerpb., 93pp., 95 cents
"If you have a farm in
Vietnam
And a house in hell
Sell the farm
And go home."
—Obscenities
Don't expect to like this little
volume of poetry too quickly.
I'he poetry is abrasively short,
almost barked out like military
orders (Vietnam vet Casey was an
MP). At times, it's almost
simpleminded. I stress "almost"
because the poetry succeeds, as
Stanley Kunitz notes in an
appropriately brief introduction,
through understatement, by
stripping language to mere
skeleton-cold words.
If anything, Obscenities
reminds me of Hemingway's
vignettes between the stories of In
Our Time: there is a progression of
vignettes, not a plot, and the
vividness comes through the
juxtaposition of words. Vividness
results from sensitive sparseness.
There isn't much to say—there
are only a handful of words which
have three syllables. Casey's
poetry comes to the border of
prose and is unselfconscious
enough sometimes to cross it. The
effect comes not from meter or
imagery, but sometimes, from a
slight black humor grin (Is there a
"Monkey Mountain" somewhere

in Vietnam? Could dozens of men
have died for the capture of
"Hamburger Hill?" It is too
tempting sometimes to think of
this endless, decrepit war as a
comic book feud; Casey's book
exploits that fact.).
More effective is Casey's use of
words in isolation, as in
"concrete" poetry—words which
effect us simply by their sound,
location, length. Against the
relentless, decorated "Yellow flags
with three red stripes," in The
Death Truck, the"I," which
begins the second part of the
poem is both vulnerable and
steadfast.
I agree with Kunitz that the
book should be read in one
sitting, for Obscenities, like Quite
Early One Morning or even Spoon
River Anthology, is cumulatively
impressionistic. It has a whole
case of ironically exotic place
names and futility-crazed men like
Sargeant Rock who
was in the army
Since the day he was born
He was in the war of the babies.
Obscenities won't make you
rage, won't even bring your blood
to a slow boil. For it describes a
world without order, progress, or
"catharsis," it is a world of dust,
boredom, spit, and death—of
people, land, and language. Like
the war, the book sometimes cuts
into you, always pricks you, and
above all, won't leave you alone.
