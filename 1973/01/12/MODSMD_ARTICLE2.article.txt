# Poor Organization Plagues COST

### SCOTT DAILEY 
Organizational problems have
plagued the efforts of the Coalition on
Student Tuition (COST) to oppose the
10 percent tuition increase scheduled
for next year.
Eric Hemel, one of the co-founders
of COST, said yesterday, "It's
practically impossible to effectively
organize a large body of people. If we
had Saul Alinsky here, then maybe we
could do it, but we haven't been able
to so far."
Hemel said that members of the
coalition have not been able to devote
much time to organizing students
opposed to the tuition increase.
Surprisingly, though, COST has not
received overwhelming student
response.
"The only people who came to us
were people who already knew us and

said they'd do anything they could to
help us," Hemel noted.
COST was formed in
mid-November, immediately following
the proposed 10 percent tuition
increase on Nov. 15. The increase has
since become final, raising tuition fees
from $2,850 for 1972-73 to $3,135
for 1973-74.
The coalition was planned to be an
"action-oriented student lobby,"
according to Hemel, quoted in the
Nov. 17 Daily. Hemel pointed out
yesterday that the coalition has not
been able to organize enough students
to form an effective lobby.
"What we would like to do," Hemel
explained, "is to have people writing
opinions against these tuition
increases. Tuition has gone up from
$2400 when I was a freshman (three
years ago) to over $3000 next year. If

tuition keeps going up in this manner,
the middle class which comprises the
majority of the Stanford students
won't be able to afford to come here."
