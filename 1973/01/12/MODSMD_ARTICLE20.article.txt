When will the administrative-type offices move out of the Old
Pavilion and back into Kncina? N.N.
No one really knows, but probably not for at least a year. The
University is still negotiating with its insurance company about
damages, and does not know what it will do with the damaged areas
ofEncina. Thatdetermination should be made within 30 days.
Ironically, according to the director of the personnel department,
Emil Sarpa, "the accomodations here (in the old pavilion) are much
better than the east wing (of Encina) ever was. Actually we'd rather
not go back unless it is remodeled."
The seven other departments along with personnel in the Old
Pavilion are: research administration, interal audit, plant accounting,
affirmative action officer, metering services, auxiliary accounting, and
I.D. mail.
According to Judy Moss, Sarpa's assistant, the new surroundings
are rather interesting. "Almost any time you look up you can see
squirrels in the rafters. It adds a great deal."

Does anyone live in the Angell Field House? Who? T. W. W.
Yes, Joe Martin and Scott Laidlaw.

Does the Post Office guarantee the confidentiality of someone
renting a Post Office Box? lI.D.
The law guarantees such confidentiality except to law enforcement
officers or inspectors of the postal service.

How come they don't have English muffins at Lagunita brunches
anymore ? The rest of the meal is inedible. 8.8.8.
The national baker's strike is still in effect in the Bay Area and the
bread company which supplies Lagunita can no longer get the muffins
at their former price. According to Barbara Adamson, director of the
Lagunita Food Service, they presently cost twice as much as they used
to. Whether or not they will ever come back depends on the price of
muffins after the baker's strike is settled.

/ suggest that UGLY 1) open an hour later, at 9 a.m. on
Saturdays—dorms don't serve brunch until 9 a.m. on weekends, and 2)
open an hour earlier on Sundays—people ivant to study. This will
assure greater utilization of the facilities. B.D.
Robert Goiter, who directs UGLY, was quite responsive to this
suggestion. He says the library can't arbitrarily change hours, but that
it will first take a survey to see if students would indeed like to see
this change. Then, if the need is validated, he will study the staffing
requirements of such a need.
If it is possible, the library will then make the hour changes on a
trial basis; and finally, if the changes make sense they will become
permanent.
Goiter noted that UGLY used to open at 1 p.m. on Sundays, so
your suggestion is in line with past changes in the library's hours.

Perennial question: why isn't there some effort made to provide
enough parking in the women's gym/Durand/Storke area. Clearly,
there are only a finite number of cars wanting to park in this area.
Why doesn't Stanford make some attempt to accomodate these?
W.J.B.
Actually, according to Oscar Nelson in the University planning
office, that end of campus is fairly well supplied with parking
compared to some other areas—which is not to say that there isn't a
problem all over.
Specifically, there is a parking lot (known as lot B) across from
the women's athletic department tennis courts which has empty space
available nearly all the time. Of course, it is a bit of a walk from there
to the Storke building; but again, other areas of campus face a much
more accute problem.
In what is known as the Southeast quadrant, for example, near the
Post Office; the new education, research and development building;
and the new law school construction site, some people are forced to
walk from as far away as Wilbur parking lot.

Perennial question: why isn't there some effort made to provide
enough parking in the women's gym/Durand/Storke area. Clearly,
there are only a finite number of cars wanting to park in this area.
Why doesn't Stanford make some attempt to accomodate these?
W.J.B.
Actually, according to Oscar Nelson in the University planning
office, that end of campus is fairly well supplied with parking
compared to some other areas—which is not to say that there isn't a
problem all over.
Specifically, there is a parking lot (known as lot B) across from
the women's athletic department tennis courts which has empty space
available nearly all the time. Of course, it is a bit of a walk from there
to the Storke building; but again, other areas of campus face a much
more accute problem.
In what is known as the Southeast quadrant, for example, near the
Post Office; the new education, research and development building;
and the new law school construction site, some people are forced to
walk from as far away as Wilbur parking lot.
When will the administrative-type offices move out of the Old
Pavilion and back into Kncina? N.N.
No one really knows, but probably not for at least a year. The
University is still negotiating with its insurance company about
damages, and does not know what it will do with the damaged areas
ofEncina. Thatdetermination should be made within 30 days.
Ironically, according to the director of the personnel department,
Emil Sarpa, "the accomodations here (in the old pavilion) are much
better than the east wing (of Encina) ever was. Actually we'd rather
not go back unless it is remodeled."
The seven other departments along with personnel in the Old
Pavilion are: research administration, interal audit, plant accounting,
affirmative action officer, metering services, auxiliary accounting, and
I.D. mail.
According to Judy Moss, Sarpa's assistant, the new surroundings
are rather interesting. "Almost any time you look up you can see
squirrels in the rafters. It adds a great deal."

Does anyone live in the Angell Field House? Who? T. W. W.
Yes, Joe Martin and Scott Laidlaw.

Does the Post Office guarantee the confidentiality of someone
renting a Post Office Box? lI.D.
The law guarantees such confidentiality except to law enforcement
officers or inspectors of the postal service.

How come they don't have English muffins at Lagunita brunches
anymore ? The rest of the meal is inedible. 8.8.8.
The national baker's strike is still in effect in the Bay Area and the
bread company which supplies Lagunita can no longer get the muffins
at their former price. According to Barbara Adamson, director of the
Lagunita Food Service, they presently cost twice as much as they used
to. Whether or not they will ever come back depends on the price of
muffins after the baker's strike is settled.

/ suggest that UGLY 1) open an hour later, at 9 a.m. on
Saturdays—dorms don't serve brunch until 9 a.m. on weekends, and 2)
open an hour earlier on Sundays—people ivant to study. This will
assure greater utilization of the facilities. B.D.
Robert Goiter, who directs UGLY, was quite responsive to this
suggestion. He says the library can't arbitrarily change hours, but that
it will first take a survey to see if students would indeed like to see
this change. Then, if the need is validated, he will study the staffing
requirements of such a need.
If it is possible, the library will then make the hour changes on a
trial basis; and finally, if the changes make sense they will become
permanent.
