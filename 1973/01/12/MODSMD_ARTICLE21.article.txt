# ACT Stages Effective But Flawed Ibsen
## 
### STU ALLEN 
Having waited through two
hours of preparatory
development, the Geary Theater
audience stirred with anticipation
as the new A.C.T. production of
"A Doll's House" neared its
climactic final scene. No
production of Ibsen's historic play
could, after all, be even adequate
without a convincing portrayal of
Nora's sudden decision to leave
her husband and her children in
order to create her own life,
unburdened by an involvement
with a family of strangers.
Largely through the acting of
Marsha Mason as Nora, and Peter
Donat as Torvald, and through the
directing of Allen Fletcher, this
production is admirable in that
litmus-test of a conclusion.
Whereas the proceeding two
and one-half acts suffer by
comparison, they are mostly
necessary to the play, well acted,
and interesting. Most people's
interest in the play, however,
focuses on the revolutionary act
of Nora's.
Nora thinks she has ruined her
husband's reputation by an
innocent but totally damaging
forgery. He is being blackmailed
by a letter from an employee he
has dismissed who wants
reinstatement. Then,
unexpectedly, a second letter
arrives: the would-be blackmailer
has relented, and Nora and her
husband are safe.
New Clarity
With a new clarity of vision

Nora sees her husband's lack of
concern for her beyond the limits
of his carefully circumscribed
consciousness. Her world,
dependent on Torvald's concern
for meaning, falls away. She is left
confused, but filled with certainty
about the emptiness of her family
life.
The implications of Nora's
self-understanding for all human
intercourse keep the play
pertinent. Relevance, however,
cannot suffice; the play must take
on a life of its own to succeed.
The only way one can justify
Nora's massive transformation
from a light-minded lark to a
conscious person is through
creative acting. There must be
some inkling of wistfulness and a
buried hurt, even as she hops and
twitters as a carefree "bird."
When she begins to speak the
quietly forceful lines in
explanation of her decision to
leave, the audience must be led to

see that she is groping in subdued
anguish toward a realization
which is just dawning on her.
Marsha Mason effectively
foreshadows her change, even
though she is working within the
tightly drawn parameters Ibsen
chose for the early Nora.
In the first act, disdainful
friend, Kristine Linde, expresses
doubts about Nora's strength.
Nora responds with a hidden and
hurt pride, based on her secret
knowledge of having saved her
husband's health in a difficult
time. In other scenes she serves
notice upon the audience that she
is not truly as saccharine as she
superficially appears.
Fully Human Potential
Peter Donat also explores the
potential of the play to be fully
human in his lucid portrayal of
Torvald as a tragic figure, locked
into his insensitivity by a business
and intellectual success that has
developed some quite admirable

qualities in him.
He remains, however, a prig to
the end, chiefly because of his
elevation of that success to the
supreme position in his morality.
As Krogstad, Donald Ewer
plays well with a shrewdly
effective staginejs which lessens
the real despair of the frayed little
man unable to cope with unkind
circumstances and moral issues.
Barbara Colby, as Mrs. Linde, is
attractive, dignified, and effective.
The play unquestionably gets
off to a slow start. The
degradation of Nora's life needs

less demonstration now, of
course, but the first two acts ride
the wheels right off this theme.
While cutting would be
difticult because of the rather
intricate plot, perhaps the play
would be more even, if the
settings and costumes were less
opulent. The show doesn't need
to draw attention to its historical
setting, which is almost boringly
obvious for the first two acts.
