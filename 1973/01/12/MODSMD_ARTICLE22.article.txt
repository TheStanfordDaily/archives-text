## Cards' Frost Blends Strength, Finesse The
						Stanford Daily SPORTS 
### BILL CLASTER 
Although he checks in a 6-6
and 228 pounds, Dave Frost
hardly plays basketball in a
manner typical of a forward of
those bruising dimensions. While
Frost does enjoy the physical
contact that is inevitable when
fighting for rebounds, he certainly
does not play the role of the
"hatchet man."
Rather, Frost is a blend of
strength and finesse. He is capable
of out-muscling almost anyone,
yet at the same time is able to
float in soft jump shots from all
over the court.
It has only been recently,
however, that the junior from
Long Beach has been able to put
together both his inside muscle
game and his excellent outside
play. Frost was hampered last
year by recurring back muscle
spasms which forced him out of
the line-up at various times. When
he was able to play, it was usually
not at full-strength.
Dave recovered from his back
ailments, but developed a new
problem at the beginning of this
season. He had gone up to 240

during the previous summer and
was not in the best of shape. This
cut down on both his playing time
and his quickness. He has now
shed that extra weight and seems
ready to put it all together.
Frost came to Stanford last
year as a transfer from Long
Beach City College. In his only
year there he played with the

state junior college champions and
was named to the all-state Junior
College tournament team. Frost
also pitched on the L.B.C.C.
baseball team, fashioning an
impressive 8-2 win/loss record.
Wanted Balanced School
Sought after by every school in
the Pac-8 except UCLA, Dave

chose Stanford for a variety of
reasons. He notes, "I wanted to
stay in the state, but wanted to
get out of Southern California. In
terms of achieving the best
balance between athletics and
academics, Stanford was easily my
first choice."
Frost, an English major, is
especially impressed with the

diversity of people at Stanford.
"It's really enjoyable to talk to
anyone here. Everyone is really on
top of things. It seems like
everybody has an opinion on
almost any topic."
While Dave is best known for
his basketball ability, he probably
has a greater future in baseball. He
has an overpowering fastball, and
is continually improving on his
former lack of control. While
Frost was not recruited as a
baseball player, he insisted on
being able to play it after
basketball season. Although he
pitched less than he had hoped
last year, he was quite effective at
times. An impressive 8-2 record in
a semi-pro league this summer
lends credence to his professional
potential.
Yet Frost is hardly able to

think about baseball now, as his
main concern is the fast-improving
Cardinal basketball squad. He
notes, "It's really a lot more fun
this year. With (Rich) Kelley and
(Mike) Mann in the line-up we
know we have a real chance in
every game. Last year we knew, at
least subconsciously, that we just
weren't going to win certain

games."
While Frost played equally
underneath and outside in last
year's screening offense, he plays
almost exclusively on the outside
in this season's set-up. He is a
wing in the double low post
offense, and avoids trying to go
inside. He adds, "With Mann and
Kelley playing low, it's almost
impossible to drive as the middle
is really jammed up."
Dave is averaging 11 points a
game and should improve on this
figure now that he is in top shape.
His one weakness seems to be
rebounding. According to
Assistant Coach Bob Bowling, he,
like many others on the team, has
a tendency to watch 7'o" Rich
Kelley clear the boards. Frost
acknowledges this problem and
notes, "After having to fight for

every rebound last year, it reaJly
helps having Rich in there.
Unfortunately sometimes we are
caught watching him."
A resident of Sigma Chi
fraternity, Frost is unsure of his
future plans. "I really haven't
thought that much about the
future. In terms of sports if I do
ever play professionally, it will
probably be baseball. That's not
to say that I like it better than
basketball, but only that there's a
greater opportunity to get a
chance to make it in baseball due
to the extensive minor league
system."
Best Against UCLA
As a senior at Milliken High
School in Long Beach, Dave
helped lead his team to the CIF
4A basketball title (championship
of Southern California). In the
championship game of that season
Milliken upset a favored Santa
Barbara squad led by UCLA
forward Keith Wilkes. While
Stanford didn't do so well against
Wilkes and UCLA last year, Frost
played his finest game of the
season, getting 25 points against
the national champion Bruins.
Moreover, his attitude on the
eve of his latest renewal of his
rivalry with Wilkes and his mates
is typical of the new outlook on
this year's team. He notes, "I
really think that we can beat
UCLA. We really have been
coming along. The win over
Washington on Monday night
couldn't have come at a better
time. If we're hot and they take
us too lightly, we can beat them."

FROST FOR TWO — Stanford's Dave Frost, a bruising 6-6 forward, is
shown scoring over UCLA's All-American center Bill Walton in a loss
to the Bruins last year at Maples. Frost had perhaps his greatest game
in a Stanford uniform, scoring 25 points against the national
champion Bruins.
