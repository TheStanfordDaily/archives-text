# Busy Weekend Ahead For Stanford Wrestlers
## 
### 
Stanford's wrestling team will
host two meets, both of which
promise to be interesting, tonight
and tomorrow at 7:30 p.m. in
Encina Gymnasium.
This evening, the U. of
Nebraska-Omaha, the nation's

number one-ranked NAIA team,
and also Cal State-Bakersfield
come to town to face the
Cardinals in a double-dual meet.
Both teams have outstanding
individuals. Bakersfield is strong
at both 190 pounds, with Danny

Alvarez, and at 142 with Bill
Amadon.
The Nebraska lineup is
extremely strong, with Phil
Gonzales (126), an NAIA
champion, and Paul Martinez,
second in the nation last year
(118), leading the way. Omaha
also has conference champions
among their big men, with Tony
Ross at 190 and Tony Eller at the
unlimited weight slot.
Saturday, Cal-State Hayward,
the team that hosted last
Saturday's tournament in which
Stanford finished fourth, comes
to town. The Cardinals are given a
good chance to win both this
meet and that against Bakersfield.
Stanford will be wrestling
without the services of either
two-time letter-winner Malcolm
Moos (167) who is out for the
season, and Jim Tatarakis (118).
There will be no admission
charge for either meet, and all
spectators, including the many
who won't be able to get into the
Stanford-UCLA basketball game,
are welcome.
