# Card JVs Face SJS
## 
### MARK WHITE 
Coming off a narrow loss at
San Jose State last Friday, the
Stanford junior varsity basketball
team replays the Spartans this
Friday evening in Maples Pavilion
at 6 p.m., two hours prior to the
varsity game with UCLA.
In assessing the JV's 1-2
record, coach Bill Jones said he
was pleased with the team's
performance at this stage in the
season.
"Considering Mike Kehrli was
sick and couldn't play for us last
week, I think we did well to come
within 4 points of San Jose State.
Some of the ball handling
problems we've had can be
attributed to the lack of practice
between our regular frosh players
and Ed Schweitzer, who has been
with the varsity team a lot lately.
When these kids get some more
playing time together, we will not
make the same mistakes we have
in the past," said Jones.
Schweitzer, a 6-9" post man
from Newbury Park, California,
leads the team in scoring and
rebounding after three
gamesâ€”averaging 19 points and 12
rebounds. Schweitzer's strength in
high school was his rebounding,
but when the 6-11" Tim Patterson
left after Christmas to play
full-time on the varsity,
Schweitzer went to the basket
with regularity and hit on 12 of
26 shots against SJS.
The team as a whole has shot a

respectable 44 percent from the
field, but errant passes and
turnovers in key situations have
hurt the Cards. Ballhandling will
be especially important against
San Jose State Friday, for the
Spartans have a tenacious defense
and were adept at scoring fast
break baskets following Stanford
turnovers last week. The Cards
have the guns to beat SJS and
fewer turnovers could propel
them past the Spartans.
On Saturday night the Cards
host the University of Pacific
frosh, at 6 p.m., followed by the
varsity contest with USC at 8 p.m.
