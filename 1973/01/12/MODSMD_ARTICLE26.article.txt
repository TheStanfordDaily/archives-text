# Swimmers Face Washington
## 
### MIKE CHASSON 
The Stanford swim team
travels to the Pacific Northwest
this weekend to face the
University of Oregon on Friday
afternoon and the University of
Washington on Saturday night in
the first two dual meets of the
season.
The toughest meet will be
against the Huskies, last year's
sixth place NCAA finisher. In the
Pacific Eight Championships last
year the Cardinals finished third
just ahead of Washington, but in
the NCAA Championships,
Stanford finished a disappointing
eighth.
The Huskies are led by two
outstanding seniors, Rick Coella
and Steve Power. Coella, who
represented the United States in
Munich has made nine NCAA
finals in three years. He swims the
breastroke and the individual
medley.
Power Stars
Power, though failing to make
the Olympic team, has been a
world class swimmer for a number
of years, including at one time
holding the world record in the
400 meter IM. In three years he
has made eight NCAA finals. He is
very versatile, being able to swim
distance freestyle and backstroke,
as well as the IM.
Providing depth for the
Huskies are individuals such as
Scott Lautman in the fly, Steve
Johnson in the distance free, Mike
Mclntyre in the backstroke, and
John Deßoest in the IM. All of
these swimmers have recorded
excellent early season times.
Coach Jim Gaughran figures
the meet will go down to the last
relay if the meet goes as he hopes.
The key to Gaughran's plan is the
400 medley relay, the opening
event of the meet.
Normally the Cardinals would
be figured to win this event
without much problem, however,

senior flyer Rick Longinotti, a
NCAA finalist last year, has been
sick and is not ready for a top
performance.
Longinotti Not Ready
With Longinotti not ready to
go, the butterfly leg becomes a
question mark, as Stanford has no
second flyer of Longinotti's
quality.
The next best flyer is Terry
Sutton, but he is needed in the
1000 free—the event following the
relay. Gaughran has indicated he
will wait until after the Oregon
meet to decide between Sutton,
sprinter Martin Pedley, and
possibly backstroker Jack Deppe.
If the Cardinals are able to win
the medley relay they will have a
good chance to win the meet.
Gaughran hopes that the team can
get first and second in the 50 free,
100 free, and 200 breast.
Weak In Sprints
Washington's weakness is in the
sprints and Stanford should meet
Gaughran's expectations in the 50
and 100. The 200 breast will be
tough, however, as Coella was the
Munich representative in this

event along with Cardinals Brian
Job and John Hencken.
Gaughran hopes sophomore
Randy Whitchurch can win the
200 back against the Huskies fine
backstroker, Mclntyre.
Whitchurch will probably have to
go his best time to win the event.
He is also counting on at least
second place finishes from Sutton
in the 1000 and 500 and possibly
the 200 fly if he doesn't swim the
medley relay, Rich Rector in both
the 1-meter and 3-meter diving
events, and Richard Cook in the
200 free.
If the Cardinals lose the
medley relay then winning the
meet will depend on the ability of
such people as Steve Strong and
Paul Clark to pick up valuable
second and third place points with
best time performances.
This dual meet against
Washington is the first of four
meets against four of the top six
teams in the country. On January
20 Stanford hosts defending
NCAA champion Indiana with
tickets going on sale next Monday
in what will be a sure sell out.

CLOSE RACE — The backstroke will be one of the key races in Saturday's meet against the University of
Washington. Last year's most valuable freshman, Randy Whitchurch, will have a tough race against the
Huskies Mike Mclntyre. If Whitchurch can win, the Cardinals will gain valuable points necessary to defeat
Washington in what should be a close meet.
