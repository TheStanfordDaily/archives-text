# Win Streaks On The Line
## Cards Clash With Nation's Best 
### DAVE ROBINSON STAN WILSON 
Stanford and UCLA will both
try to extend winning streaks
tonight when the two teams clash
in an 8 a.m. contest at Maples
Pavilion.
Stanford's modest win streak is
four consecutive victories at
Maples, while the Bruins' streak
stands at 55 wins and spans three
seasons.
Oregon and Oregon State were
victims number 54 and 55 last
weekend as the number
one-ranked Bruins moved within
five games of the all-time
collegiate record of 60
consecutive wins, set by USF in
the mid 19505.
The Bruins, 10-0 this season,
are led by All-American center
Bill Walton, who as a sophomore
last season guided UCLA to its
sixth-s tr ai gh t national
championship. With four starters
from that team returning, the
Bruins seem destined to win it all
again this year.
Bruins Loaded
Keith "Smooth as Silk" Wilkes
and Larry Farmer will start
alongside Walton in the front
court tonight, with first-year
starters Larry Hollyfield and
Tommy Curtis at the guard spots.

As always, the Bruins are loaded
with talent. UCLA could also field
an excellent second team, with
such outstanding players as 6-11
center Sven Nater, guard Greg
Lee, a starter on last season's
championship team, and
sophomores Pete Trgovich and
Dave Meyers, who both averaged
better than 20 points a game on
last year's frosh.
UCLA coach John Wooden is
the winningest active coach in
collegiate basketball, with 583
wins in 26 years, for a winning
percentage of .791. Stanford
coach Howie Dallmar ranks eighth
on the prestigious list, with 326
victories.
In his 24 years at UCLA
Wooden's teams have won eight
national championships and 16
conference titles. Since 1963 his
teams have lost only 16 games.
Best Team Ever
Dallmar believes that the 1973
Bruins are "as good, if not better,
than any team that John
(Wooden) has ever had." But the
eighteen-year Stanford coach
refuses to concede defeat. "We
never take the floor expecting to
lose, and it won't be any different
in this game either," he said. "We
have more size than ever before,
and, if we can use it properly and

shoot well, you never know what
might happen."
The Cards are coming off an
impressive 76-55 win over
highly-regarded Washington
Monday night in Seattle. But the
young Cards have been
inconsistent this season, winning
six games while losing five. Three
of those losses have come in the
last 30 seconds.
Seven-foot sophomore center
Rich Kelley leads Stanford with
averages of 16 points and 13.7
rebounds per game. Kelley will
face the sternest test of his young
career tonight against Walton,
easily the most intimidating
center in the nation.
Tall Starters
Forwards Mike Mann (6-9) and
Dave Frost (6-6) are also averaging
in double figures for the Cards,
scoring 11.7 and 11.0
respectively. Kelley, Mann, and
Frost will be joined by guards Bob
Buell (6-5) and Mel Arterberry
(6-3) in tonight's starting lineup.

Stanford's quintet averages an
impressive 6-7, compared to 6-5
for the UCLA starters.
On Saturday night the Cards
host fast-improving USC, 9-4 on
the season. Coach Bob Boyd's
Trojans defeated Oregon State
(90-72) and Oregon (66-65) last
weekend. USC and UCLA are the
only two undefeated teams in the
conference after the first weekend
of league play.
Clint Chapman, a 6-8 forward,
and junior guard Dan Anderson
are both averaging just under 14
points per game to lead the
Trojans.

conference after the first weekend
of league play.
Clint Chapman, a 6-8 forward,
and junior guard Dan Anderson
are both averaging just under 14
points per game to lead the
Trojans.
Stanford and UCLA will both
try to extend winning streaks
tonight when the two teams clash
in an 8 a.m. contest at Maples
Pavilion.
Stanford's modest win streak is
four consecutive victories at
Maples, while the Bruins' streak
stands at 55 wins and spans three
seasons.
Oregon and Oregon State were
victims number 54 and 55 last
weekend as the number
one-ranked Bruins moved within
five games of the all-time
collegiate record of 60
consecutive wins, set by USF in
the mid 19505.
The Bruins, 10-0 this season,
are led by All-American center
Bill Walton, who as a sophomore
last season guided UCLA to its
sixth-s tr ai gh t national
championship. With four starters
from that team returning, the
Bruins seem destined to win it all
again this year.
Bruins Loaded
Keith "Smooth as Silk" Wilkes
and Larry Farmer will start
alongside Walton in the front
court tonight, with first-year
starters Larry Hollyfield and
Tommy Curtis at the guard spots.

As always, the Bruins are loaded
with talent. UCLA could also field
an excellent second team, with
such outstanding players as 6-11
center Sven Nater, guard Greg
Lee, a starter on last season's
championship team, and
sophomores Pete Trgovich and
Dave Meyers, who both averaged
better than 20 points a game on
last year's frosh.
UCLA coach John Wooden is
the winningest active coach in
collegiate basketball, with 583
wins in 26 years, for a winning
percentage of .791. Stanford
coach Howie Dallmar ranks eighth
on the prestigious list, with 326
victories.
In his 24 years at UCLA
Wooden's teams have won eight
national championships and 16
conference titles. Since 1963 his
teams have lost only 16 games.
Best Team Ever
Dallmar believes that the 1973
Bruins are "as good, if not better,
than any team that John
(Wooden) has ever had." But the
eighteen-year Stanford coach
refuses to concede defeat. "We
never take the floor expecting to
lose, and it won't be any different
in this game either," he said. "We
have more size than ever before,
and, if we can use it properly and

shoot well, you never know what
might happen."
The Cards are coming off an
impressive 76-55 win over
highly-regarded Washington
Monday night in Seattle. But the
young Cards have been
inconsistent this season, winning
six games while losing five. Three
of those losses have come in the
last 30 seconds.
Seven-foot sophomore center
Rich Kelley leads Stanford with
averages of 16 points and 13.7
rebounds per game. Kelley will
face the sternest test of his young
career tonight against Walton,
easily the most intimidating
center in the nation.
Tall Starters
Forwards Mike Mann (6-9) and
Dave Frost (6-6) are also averaging
in double figures for the Cards,
scoring 11.7 and 11.0
respectively. Kelley, Mann, and

Buell (6-5) and Mel Arterberry
(6-3) in tonight's starting lineup.

Stanford's quintet averages an
impressive 6-7, compared to 6-5
for the UCLA starters.
On Saturday night the Cards
host fast-improving USC, 9-4 on
the season. Coach Bob Boyd's
Trojans defeated Oregon State
(90-72) and Oregon (66-65) last
weekend. USC and UCLA are the
only two undefeated teams in the
conference after the first weekend
