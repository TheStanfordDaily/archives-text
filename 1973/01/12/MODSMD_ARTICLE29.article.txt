Peace Talks Doomed?
PARIS — North Vietnam and the Viet Cong said
yesterday that efforts to negotiate a Vietnam peace
settlement are doomed to failure if the United
States tries to impose "unreasonable terms" by
bombing raids or other acts of force.
The warning was sounded at the 173 rd session of
the semi-public peace conference and seemed to
refer to the continuing secret talks between Henry
A. Kissinger and Hanoi's Le Due Tho.
The talks went on at two levels. Kissinger and
Tho met for more than six hours in an
American-owned villa in suburban St. Nom la
Breteche, while the semi-public conference went
through its weekly ritual of speech-making in the
former Hotel Majestic near the Arc de Triomphe.
Kissinger and Tho agreed to meet again this
morning.
U.S. spokesman David Lambertson told newsmen
the tone of the semi-public session was "somewhat
improved" compared with last week's vituperation.
Although there's no direct link between the two
levels of talks, the semi-public conference often has
reflected the atmosphere of the secret Kissinger-Tho
negotiations.
Communist and South Vietnamese speakers laid
special stress on the dispute over Saigon's claim to
unrestricted national sovereignty, which is known to
be one of the main obstacles in the Kissinger-Tho
talks.
Four Election Violations Found
WASHINGTON — The Justice Department
yesterday accused the Finance Committee to
Re-elect the President and three defeated
congressional candidates of violations of federal
election laws.
The four criminal actions were filed in U.S.
District Court here.
The eight-count criminal information filed
against President Nixon's finance committee
charged the committee, through its treasurer, Hugh
P. Sloan, gave G. Gordon Liddy, a legal adviser to
the panel, cash sums in the amount of $12,000,
$12,000 and $5,300, without receiving a receipt.
The committee was charged in three counts with
failing to report these expenditures to the General
Accounting Office (GAO) and with failing to obtain
a receipt for and make a GAO report on an
additional $2,000 Liddy spent.
Maximum penalty upon conviction on each
count is a $1,000 fine.
Reagan Backs Death Penalty
SACRAMENTO — Gov. Ronald Reagan yesterday
urged imposition of a mandatory death penalty for
murder of policemen, and called for an $850 million

rebate to taxpayers of the state's budget surplus.
He outlined his program to the Legislature in his
seventh annual "State of the State" message.
He said that "Public opinion is far ahead of some
of our courts" on capital punishment, referring to
the voters' endorsement of the death penalty last
November.
Chances for passage of a death penalty measure
are uncertain in the Democratic-controlled
legislature.
He offered an olive branch to the lawmakers,
backing down from his insistence that the $850
million be distributed by reducing state income
taxes. That proposal had drawn sharp criticism from
legislative leaders. Reagan yesterday said the form
of the tax rebate would be open to negotiation
between his staff and Democratic legislators.
Newsman Released From Jail
LOS ANGELES — Newsman William Farr left jdil
yesterday free for the first time in 46 days, and said
he hoped his incarceration had focused public
attention on the "problem of repressiveness toward
the press."
The 38-year-old newsman said he was happily
surprised that U.S. Supreme Court Justice William
O. Douglas had ordered him released, at least
temporarily.
Douglas said he was freeing Farr "in the interest
of justice" since he had raised an issue not covered
by past decisions of the Supreme Court.
"My joy is tempered by the fact that there's
always a possibility I could lose future appeals and
be brought back in here," Farr told reporters as he
stepped into the sunshine outside the Los Angeles
County jail.
It was the first time he had seen daylight since he
was jailed by Superior Court Judge Charles H. Older
and placed — because he was the only civil prisoner
in the jail — in isolation.
"This has proven that they can hold you in jail
for a very long time," Farr told reporters. "But it
has also proven they can't force you to tell things
unless you want to."
"I feel any other good reporter would do the
same thing I did," he said.
Older had cited Farr in contempt of court and
ordered him held in jail until the newsman
identified the secret sources of a story he wrote
during the Charles Manson trial. Farr, who had said
earlier the sources were lawyers in the case, refused
to tell, saying it would be a violation of professional
ethics and personal conscience.
He said upon leaving jail that he held "no
bitterness" against Older but thought that the
imposition of an indeterminant sentence in his case
was "psychologically barbaric."

Watergate Judge Accepts Plea
WASHINGTON — Former White House aide E.
Howard Hunt, Jr. yesterday pleaded guilty to six
charges in the Watergate bugging case, and was
released on bond pending sentencing.
Meanwhile, testimony began in the trial of six
others accused in the burglary and eavesdropping of
Democratic National headquarters last June.
Leaving the courthouse after posting $100,000
bond, Hunt told newsmen that he knew of no
higher administration officials involved in the
Watergate affair.
He said that if he appears before a grand jury
later "I would testify to the best of my knowledge
there was none," he said of involvement by higher
officials.
He said that he pleaded guilty because he had
undergone "the unexpected tragic death of my
wife" in a plane crash last month. "I felt I could not
undergo the experience of a long trial. I felt I should
be with my children."
Hunt said, as he did in court earlier in the day,
that the case as outlined by the prosecutor, was
substantially correct.
Death Penalty Limit Urged
WASHINGTON — The Nixon administration has
retreated from a position endorsing a mandatory
death sentence for crimes such as airplane
hijackings, saying the death sentence should be
limited to "certain well-defined situations."
"Punishment that is too severe or too flexible
may interfere with, rather than enhance, law
enforcement," Asst. Atty. Gen. Roger C. Cramton
told the Senate aviation subcommittee yesterday.
Atty. Gen. Richard Kleindienst said a week ago
that the administration endorses the mandatory
death penalty for skyjacking and other
"cold-blooded, premeditated" federal crimes.
But Cramton warned that a hijacker could be led
to believe that if he faced a mandatory death
sentence "he had nothing to lose by continuing a
suicidal flight." He testified at a hearing on an
antihijacking bill.
He said the administration actually prefers
"legislation limiting capital punishment to certain
well-defined situations" of air piracy, such as loss
of life or when the crime has been committed "in an
especially heinous, cruel or depraved manner."
