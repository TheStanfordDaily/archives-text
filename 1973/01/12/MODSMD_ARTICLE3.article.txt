# Faculty Senate Renews Charters Of SWOPSI, SCIRE Programs
## 
### MARK SIMONIAN 
The Faculty Senate yesterday
unanimously passed a bill to renew the
charters of the Stanford Workshop on
Political and Social Issues (SWOPSI),
the Student Center for Innovation and
Research in Education (SCIRE), and

the Program on Urban Studies for a
period of three years.
In its first meeting of the quarter,
the Senate also voted to approve the
Committee on Undergraduate Studies
(C-US) compromise proposal in which
the controversial programs would be
placed under the direct authority of
the Dean of Undergraduate Studies.
However, an amendment to give the
Dean ultimate authority over the issues
of academic credit in the programs
failed.
The new charters provide Dean of
Undergraduate Studies James Gibbs
with the power to appoint members of
the Policy Boards and Committees
overseeing ths programs as well as
powers to select the Directors of the
programs.
Gibbs alone will have the primary
task of accrediting courses from the
programs. Formerly the Chairman of
C-US aided in that process.
Amendment Failed
Assoc. Law Prof. and
Vice-Chairman of the Senate Paul
Brest introduced an amendment which
would have given the final
responsibility for accreditation to
Gibbs. After some debate, Gibbs threw
his "unqualified support" behind the

C-US resolution in its original form.
Immediately after this, the
amendment failed to pass.
After the meeting, Gibbs stated
that he supported the C-US plan
because of strong recommendations
for a faculty-student voice from both
C-US and the programs themselves. He
also felt that very few instances of
dispute will ever be submitted to the
Subcommittee on Credit Review of
C-US, the final arbiter.
"Basically what the Academic
Senate did was to set up an
administrative arrangement which
involved some sharing of customary
administrative decision-making
authority with faculty and students.
And I think that I, along with the rest
of the faculty, will now be looking to
see what effect that has on the quality
of the courses and workshops that will
be offered."
Time For Examination
The Dean also stressed the
temporary nature of the arrangement,
but he explained that "by having the
programs established for a longer
period of time, I think it will enable us
to examine the substantive education
issue."
Asked what he would do as chief

administrator of SWOPSI, SCIRE, and
Urban Studies, Gibbs replied, "I think
the quality of the programs is quite
uneven. I will use the authority I have
as Dean to try and move the programs
to a point where their offering are
more consistently of strong academic
caliber."
Dan Lewis, director of SWOPSI,
remains optimistic about the future of
his program under the new system.
"We've worked on this for four or five
months now. It's not an ideal
situation, but as long as the final
authority on credit remains with a
faculty-student board we're pleased
with the compromise."
Director of SCIRE Ron Jones also
was pleased with the outcome of the
vote, but voiced his feeling for greater
faculty-student control. 'There's been
a lot of accommodation on both sides.
"I'm definitely in favor of students
and faculty operating to make the
decisions. From the SCIRE
standpoint, for the last two years
they've had 200 projects, and I think
those projects speak for themselves.
Faculty and students can work
together. There's no reason to change
it except that you want to build a
bureaucracy."

After the meeting, Gibbs stated
that he supported the C-US plan
because of strong recommendations
for a faculty-student voice from both
C-US and the programs themselves. He
also felt that very few instances of
dispute will ever be submitted to the
Subcommittee on Credit Review of
C-US, the final arbiter.
"Basically what the Academic
Senate did was to set up an
administrative arrangement which
involved some sharing of customary
administrative decision-making
authority with faculty and students.
And I think that I, along with the rest
of the faculty, will now be looking to
see what effect that has on the quality
of the courses and workshops that will
be offered."
Time For Examination
The Dean also stressed the
temporary nature of the arrangement,
but he explained that "by having the
programs established for a longer
period of time, I think it will enable us
to examine the substantive education
issue."
Asked what he would do as chief

administrator of SWOPSI, SCIRE, and
Urban Studies, Gibbs replied, "I think
the quality of the programs is quite
uneven. I will use the authority I have
as Dean to try and move the programs
to a point where their offering are
more consistently of strong academic
caliber."
Dan Lewis, director of SWOPSI,
remains optimistic about the future of
his program under the new system.
"We've worked on this for four or five
months now. It's not an ideal
situation, but as long as the final
authority on credit remains with a
faculty-student board we're pleased
with the compromise."
Director of SCIRE Ron Jones also
was pleased with the outcome of the
vote, but voiced his feeling for greater
faculty-student control. 'There's been
a lot of accommodation on both sides.
"I'm definitely in favor of students
and faculty operating to make the
decisions. From the SCIRE
standpoint, for the last two years
they've had 200 projects, and I think
those projects speak for themselves.
Faculty and students can work
together. There's no reason to change
it except that you want to build a
bureaucracy."
The Faculty Senate yesterday
unanimously passed a bill to renew the
charters of the Stanford Workshop on
Political and Social Issues (SWOPSI),
the Student Center for Innovation and
Research in Education (SCIRE), and

the Program on Urban Studies for a
period of three years.
In its first meeting of the quarter,
the Senate also voted to approve the
Committee on Undergraduate Studies
(C-US) compromise proposal in which
the controversial programs would be
placed under the direct authority of
the Dean of Undergraduate Studies.
However, an amendment to give the
Dean ultimate authority over the issues
of academic credit in the programs
failed.
The new charters provide Dean of
Undergraduate Studies James Gibbs
with the power to appoint members of
the Policy Boards and Committees
overseeing ths programs as well as
powers to select the Directors of the
programs.
Gibbs alone will have the primary
task of accrediting courses from the
programs. Formerly the Chairman of
C-US aided in that process.
Amendment Failed
Assoc. Law Prof. and
Vice-Chairman of the Senate Paul
Brest introduced an amendment which
would have given the final
responsibility for accreditation to
Gibbs. After some debate, Gibbs threw
his "unqualified support" behind the

C-US resolution in its original form.
Immediately after this, the
amendment failed to pass.
