# Students Awarded $30,000 In Grants
## Study Probes Health Effects Of Smog 
### CHRISTY WISE 
Have you ever been allocated
$30,000 to pursue a research project
of your choosing? A number of
Stanford students, mostly
undergraduates, had this opportunity
during the past two and a half years.
The project explored the possibility
of an increase in health problems at
eight university health centers when
pollution in the area increases. It
began during the summer of 1970
when Skip Harris received $5,000
from Stanford to do a feasibility study
on the "Short-term Health Effects of
Air Pollution."

As a result of his investigation,
Harris suggested an epidemiological
study which would attempt to
correlate the health of college students
with atmospheric pollutants. He
suggested that the study correlate
daily health complaints at student
health centers with daily pollution
readings at nearby pollution
monitoring stations.
In the fall of 1970, Bill Durham
became principal investigator of the
project and visited health centers at
Cal-Irvine, (JSC, UCLA, San Fernando
Valley State, Cal Poly at Pomona, Cat
State Long Beach, Santa Clara and
Stanford.
Trial Run
Upon discovering that most health
directors were amenable if not
enthusiastic, Durham applied to the
National Science Foundation for one
year of funding to conduct the
research project. N.S.F. took the

opportunity to fund the project as a
trial run for future funding of
undergraduate research projects.
The $10,000 awa"rd carried the
project through September, 1971 at
which time a few students decided to
continue the project for another year
in order to work with a greater
amount of significant data.
At this time, Dave Blake became
the third project director. He and
Christopher Dunn submitted a request
for additional funding to what is now
the N.S.F. "Student-Originated-
Studies" division. A $12,000 award
helped pay the health centers and
provided student stipends which
enabled a core of students to work for
an additional summer analyzing
results.
During the course of the two and a
half years, $3,000 worth of computer
time was donated by the Computer
Science Department, bringing the total
expenditure to about $30,000.
During the first year, about forty
students took the course. Seven of
those interested and acquainted with
the project were selected to work
during the following summer to
analyze the results of the first year's
data. For the next nine months the
new principal investigators again
offered the course, involving about ten
to twenty students.
Summary Report
A core of students assembled to
complete the final analysis during the
summer of 1972. A summary report
was written the fall of that year. In
December, 1972, Dave Blake visited
the American Association for the

Advancement of Science in
Washington, D.C., where he presented
the results of the study to the
"Student-Originated-Studies" group.
According to Blake, the project was
an "alternative to problem sets and a
chance for students to learn how to
research."
Education benefits of the project,
as outlined by the summary report,
include an opportunity for students
taking the SWOPSI course to pursue
research; interdisciplinary exchange by
students with a variety of educational
backgrounds; a teaching experience for
the principal investigators; exposure to
faculty members in a research context;
exposure to experts in many fields.
Also, for the students who pursued
the project during the summer, the
project presented an opportunity to
work on a single problem for three
months without the concern of classes
or commitments was provided.
Undergrads Could Benefit
Christopher Dunn said, "Other
undergraduates interested in doing
research could really benefit by
reading about our project, how it was
conducted, what we accomplished,
and the actual potential of
undergraduate originated and directed
research effort."
One difficulty was keeping enough
students interested to sustain the
project. Because of the fluctuation of
interest and participation the project
never moved according to a reasonable
timetable, and principal investigators
were always acquainting new students
with the project from scratch.
