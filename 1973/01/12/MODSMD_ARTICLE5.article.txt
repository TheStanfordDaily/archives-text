# Soothsayers Peer At Palms To Foresee Future
## 
### CLAIRE SPIEGEL GEORGE DOBBINS 
The Menlo Park police chief calls it
a fraud. Gypsies insist the art of
fortune telling is a respectable 4000
year-old tradition.
In 1970 the Menlo Park City
Council passed an ordinance banning
the "occult arts" because "fortune
tellers were becoming a nuisance,"
according to police chief Vic
Cizanckas Since then local fortune
tellers have filed a one million dollar
law suit charging the city with
violation of their constitutional rights.
While their case awaits court action,
the fortune tellers continue to reveal
the mystic word to an average of two
or three customers a day.
Tucked between gas stations and
hamburger stands along the El Camino
Real, shacks with tacky signs out front
function as business and home
residences for those who probe
eternity. While their children play, and
dinner cooks in the kitchen these
soothsayers charge their visitors a
dollar a minute.
Clad in a black paisley dress, her
hair covered by a purple scarf,
Madame Maria ushered her visitors
into a singularly posh parlor. Wall to
wall mirrors exaggerated the size of
artificial roses resting in gold-plated
pots. In an adjacent room, a man
sprawled out on a leather couch
watching a western shoot-out on
television.

Marka snapped into her routine; her
eyes fixated on a statue of ttie Virgin
Mary across the room. Rattling off a
feature length version of a fortune
cookie saying, not once did Maria look
at the palm she was supposed to have
been reading.
"Do something good between
Thursday and Friday, always a lucky
day for you," she advised, as the
phone rang once without disturbing
her. "87 years you gonna live, good
natured person honey, good nature.
Too soft hearted ... But you said a lot
a times you not going to help nobody,
not going to do anything for nobody
but you gonna start doin' things just
for yourself. But you never do it. You
never change and still doin' it."
Suspicious Gypsy
Madame Maria is suspicious of all
who visit her establishment, especially
reporters. "You was here before,
wasn't you?" she asks her customers.
When approached for an interview, she
hesitates and then comments, "No, I
don't like dat idea."
Menlo Park fortune tellers generally
shun publicity. Madame Leona says,
"What I do is very private. I'm not
interested in giving out information
about myself."
Although the women hesitate to
discuss their business, the man behind
the scenes, George Adams, brother of
the late gypsy king of California,
openly admits that he founded fortune

telling in Menlo Park over 35 years
ago.
Fortune Telling Founded
Arriving from the "old country,"
he and his wife, Lola (Madame Maria),
set up fortune telling parlors modeled
after "our tradition, our way of
living."
Adams claims that this is his
family's only income outside of "a few
pieces of property." He says that all
types of people come to have their
fortunes told and the prices are
standard — five dollars for a palm
reading, $10 for the cards and $25 for
the crystal ball.
"We don't really have any regular
customers," he states, "but some
people come back two or three times
for a more expensive reading."
The Adams family owns three
fortune telling parlors. But the family
that tells fortunes together doesn't
necessarily make the same predictions.
Before making any prognostications,
Madame Katherine, one of Adam's
daughters-in-law, commented,
"Whatever I gonna tell you, good or
bad, don't you get mad."
Different Lucky Days
Katherine chopped four years off
Maria's predicted lifespan for the Daily
reporter and called her visitor's lucky
days Monday, Wednesday and Friday
instead of Thursday and Friday. Like
the other fortune tellers, Katherine
used the key phrase, "You gonna get
