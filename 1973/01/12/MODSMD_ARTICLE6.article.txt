## Frenchman's Freeze 
### 
As Inauguration Day 1973 rapidly approaches, the general
prospects for the next four years appear to be getting worse almost
every day. Foremost among the bad omens is the recent terror
bombing of North Vietnam and the diminished prospects for the
settlement of a war that could have been ended years ago.
The domestic outlook isn't much brighter, and earlier tliis week
area officials received some very unfortunate news which may be an
indication of things to come. On Monday, outgoing Secretary of
Housing and Urban Development George Romney announced an
18-month moratorium on federal housing subsidies which places die
Frenchman's Terrace housing project in grave jeopardy.
It has long been rumored that President Nixon would like to
eliminate HUD and many of its programs and the announcement of
tliis funding moratorium certainly reinforces those rumors. On a more
general level, the moratorium is yet another example of Nixon
freezing already appropriated funds and infringing upon the power of
the Congress.
The Frenchman's Terrace low/moderate-income project was the
result of much hard work by Stanford and Palo Alto officials and
citizens and we had hoped that it would mark the beginning of a
long-overdue major housing program for this area. Now it appears that
even this first step may be scrapped or at least delayed for many
months.
Stanford and Palo Alto officials have already registered protests at
the federal level and we urge them to continue to protest as much as
possible. We also urge our readers to protest to Secretary-designate of
Housing and Urban Development James Lynn, Nixon and their
congressmen. If heavy pressure is not applied and the moratorium
remains in effect, the future for badly-needed subsidized housing will
not be bright.
Urge your congressmen to stand up to Nixon on Uiis and other
crucial issues. The President seems intent upon strengthening the
executive branch to such an extent that the balanced tripartite system
of government may be greatly threatened. One of the most important
questions facing us today is whether the Democratic Congress will
stand up to Nixon and fight his usurpation of their power.
An attempt to cut off funds for the war will almost certainly be
made in the near future and that will be a crucial test of the direction
Congress will take this session. A strong, aggressive Congress can act to
counter the President and hopefully formulate more reasonable
priorities for this country. But if Congress continues to fill a weak,
secondary position, Nixon may have free reign for much of his second
administration. That possibility is not very encouraging.
An all-out effort must be made to save the Frenchman's Terrace
project. But at the same time we urge congressmen to fight this
funding moratorium, we must urge them to take immediate action to
restore Congress to its rightful position in our system of government.
President Nixon must not be allowed to keep Congress under his
thumb.
