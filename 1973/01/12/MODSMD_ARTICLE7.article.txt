## Speaker's Bureau For Women

A Speaker's Bureau for Women now exists at
Stanford through the cooperation of the ASSU, the
Women's Center and the CEEW (Committee on the
Education and Employment of Women). The need
is blatant.
There are many problems that we, as women
students, face in our daily lives, academic schedules
and career plans. Who can we go to? Are we always
aware that these are problems because we are
women?
We can go to our girlfriends if we have any or our
sponsors if we live in a dorm, but they probably
don't know any better than we.
If we go to our academic advisors to discuss
academic problems and career plans, we usually face
a man who inevitably gives us the feeling that he
doesn't have time for any nonsense we could bring
up. This conference comes, of course, after the
struggle of making an appointment at least a week
in advance.
Salesgirls
When we start planning for careers, we find that
our "prestigious" Stanford education has prepared
us for nothing and so become secretaries or
waitresses or salesgirls.
Many more women enter Stanford with plans to
be doctors, lawyers, professors and scientists than
graduate with these same goals. Why?
There are certain subjects in which the majority
of women major. Why? What scares women away
from the hard sciences and engineering? Ask
yourself these questions.
Lack of Awareness
We lack women models, we lack sympathetic
advising, we lack women's studies and if we go even

further, we lack extended education and university
supported childcare to name only a few. But, most
importantly, we lack the awareness that these are
essential to our development as women.
Dean Lyons of the Office of Student Services
remarked at a CEEW meeting that more services
could be provided specifically for women. The
problem isn't the university; the problem is the
women students themselves who seen unaware of
any problems or the opportunity for change.
A channel has now been opened for these
problems to be discussedâ€”the Speaker's Bureau for
Women. This bureau will make available lists of
women speakers from Stanford and the surrounding
community who will be happy to speak with any
group of women in the university.
Women's Representative
Hopefully, each residence house will choose a
women's representative to arrange for these speakers
on an irregular basis, a weekly basis with varying
topics or even a class on one specific topic for which
credit might be available.
The bureau has lists of possible topics which
includes a "quickie" course on self-defense,
contraception, legal aid, and combining motherhood
with a career to name only a few. These lists have
been sent to each house with women residents via
the Sponsor or R.A. who will arrange for the
women's representative to be chosen.
The Speaker's Bureau for Women is a first and
very important step in the development of the
consciousness of Stanford women. Take advantage
of it!
