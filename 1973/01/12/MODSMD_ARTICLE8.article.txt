## In Support Of The Sunday Flicks 
### 
jerry coleman

The lights dim, the screen is
illuminated, stage curtains
mistakenly close, then open. You
settle more comfortably in your
seat, perhaps gathering toward
you a neighboring loved one. An
evening's entertainment awaits.
Then, without warning, a
celluloid projectile, two pieces of
popcorn, and a wad of wet gum
hit your head. The air behind and
above you erupts with the
cacophony of the jungle:
mother wants
you."
"Aw, shut up!"
"Ha ha—listen to the punks."
"YOU shut up punk!"
Assorted obscenities bring a
redness to your face; turning back
to the screen you observe the
shadows of a fleet of crocodiles
chasing a giant rabbit.
Rancid Taste
Odd pounding and shuffling
noises continue throughout the
evening, along with shouted
attempts at wit. After two hours
you storm out, a rancid taste in
your mouth, and nearly run down
three adolescents with your
Mustang.
Where, the reader might
wonder, are such abuses of the
theater-going privilege so
tolerated? The Sunday Flicks of

course; that once-a-week attack of
Mem Aud Madness.
At the end of last quarter, the
Flicks Manager distributed a
questionnaire asking if an age
limit should be placed on ticket
buyers, with a resultant rise in
price from 50 cents to 75 cents
per show. Since this quarter's

Flicks still cost 50 cents, it would
seem we're in for the same
audience as before.
But is that so bad? There are
few places in the area where
recent films can be seen so
cheaply, and even fewer theaters
with the ambiance and
enthusiastic spirit of the Sunday
Flicks.
Entertainment
When as many community
residents as want to, young or old,
can come to the Flicks and share

in the evening's entertainment,
both onstage and off, then what
real harm is there in paper
airplanes or four letter words?
In off campus theaters, unless
the film presented is so powerful
that it personally affects the lives
and experiences of the majority of
viewers collectively, group

feeling—a community—is rarely
created.
Individuals or small groups
enter such theaters, sit passively,
and reach out in no way to
anyone else, even those strangers
sitting next to them.
Airplane Flight
But in the Sunday Flicks I've
seen whole sections of the
auditorium, most of them
unknown to each other, share in
the suspense of the flight of a
single airplane, then cheer its

landing on the stage.
Whole balconies are unified as
they watch people try to sneak in,
down scaffoldings or from ropes
lowered through the skylights.
And entire audiences have laughed
to a student-shouted joke, funnier
than anything presented on
screen.
I, for one, support this Mem
Aud Madness. It is unique,
surprising, often laughable, and
only occasionally mildly
annoying.
Juvenile Haven
In a world expecting
responsibility and maturity, we
need a place where those who
want to can act juvenile, or share
in such actions vicariously,
without social condemnation.
In the words of one Stanford
psychologist, "As soon as a side
involvement gets more important
than the main involvement, it
attracts attention. But in certain
places, we allow the dominant
involvement to be
subordinate. ..."
"The Sunday Flicks is the
classic example here, for it is
those who complain who have
now become the deviants."

human biology and regular Daily

The lights dim, the screen is
illuminated, stage curtains
mistakenly close, then open. You
settle more comfortably in your
seat, perhaps gathering toward
you a neighboring loved one. An
evening's entertainment awaits.
Then, without warning, a
celluloid projectile, two pieces of
popcorn, and a wad of wet gum
hit your head. The air behind and
above you erupts with the
cacophony of the jungle:
mother wants
you."
"Aw, shut up!"
"Ha ha—listen to the punks."
"YOU shut up punk!"
Assorted obscenities bring a
redness to your face; turning back
to the screen you observe the
shadows of a fleet of crocodiles
chasing a giant rabbit.
Rancid Taste
Odd pounding and shuffling
noises continue throughout the
evening, along with shouted
attempts at wit. After two hours
you storm out, a rancid taste in
your mouth, and nearly run down
three adolescents with your
Mustang.
Where, the reader might
wonder, are such abuses of the
theater-going privilege so
tolerated? The Sunday Flicks of

course; that once-a-week attack of
Mem Aud Madness.
At the end of last quarter, the
Flicks Manager distributed a
questionnaire asking if an age
limit should be placed on ticket
buyers, with a resultant rise in
price from 50 cents to 75 cents
per show. Since this quarter's

Flicks still cost 50 cents, it would
seem we're in for the same
audience as before.
But is that so bad? There are
few places in the area where
recent films can be seen so
cheaply, and even fewer theaters
with the ambiance and
enthusiastic spirit of the Sunday
Flicks.
Entertainment
When as many community
residents as want to, young or old,
can come to the Flicks and share

in the evening's entertainment,
both onstage and off, then what
real harm is there in paper
airplanes or four letter words?
In off campus theaters, unless
the film presented is so powerful
that it personally affects the lives
and experiences of the majority of
viewers collectively, group

feeling—a community—is rarely
created.
Individuals or small groups
enter such theaters, sit passively,
and reach out in no way to
anyone else, even those strangers
sitting next to them.
Airplane Flight
But in the Sunday Flicks I've
seen whole sections of the
auditorium, most of them
unknown to each other, share in
the suspense of the flight of a
single airplane, then cheer its

landing on the stage.
Whole balconies are unified as
they watch people try to sneak in,
down scaffoldings or from ropes
lowered through the skylights.
And entire audiences have laughed
to a student-shouted joke, funnier
than anything presented on
screen.
I, for one, support this Mem
Aud Madness. It is unique,
surprising, often laughable, and
only occasionally mildly
annoying.
Juvenile Haven

responsibility and maturity, we
need a place where those who

without social condemnation.
