# Special Events Schedules Few Winter Concerts
## 
### DOYLE McMANUS 
Despite the fortifying effort of a $1
fee assessment, the ASSU Special
Events' winter schedule looks meager.
"We've got some problems," said
Special Events Chairman Ron
Shannon, a sophomore. "We'll have a
substantial schedule of concerts of the
Maples Pavilion variety this spring, but
we may have to do with just one major
show in the winter."
All that's definite now is a Taj
Mahal/Joy of Cooking concert in
Memorial Auditorium Jan. 22 — plus a
number of minor events: a free
concert by Great Toads in the Sunset
(sic) at Tresidder Union today at noon
("a good local band," according to
Shannon), and a performance of As
You Like It by San Francisco's New
Shakespeare Company in the Tresidder
Large Lounge Jan. 29.

"I'm working on Leon Russell and
the Moody Blues, maybe we can get
them to come back. I don't know
whether you should print that,"
Shannon said, "neither is really
definite yet. Well, go ahead anyway."
Monday Night Events
The New Shakespeare Company's
appearance will be the first in a series
of what Shannon calls "Monday night
cheapy things" in the Tresidder Large
Lounge. Run on a "small-loss"
promotional basis, they will serve
apparently to draw attention to
Special Events' larger productions —
"50c would be the most we'd ever
charge."
One of the problems in producing
winter concerts, said Shannon, is that
"very few headline quality talent are
touring .. . The Athletic Department
has problems in giving us a hall, with

basketball going on. Trying to match
the available talent with a hall that can
support it is next to impossible.
"We're really constrained as far as
halls go; we have continual hassles
with the Drama Department. January
22 was the only date between now and
March that I could get Mem Aud."
Financial Standing
Shannon was unable to furnish any
figures on the Special Events Board's
current financial standing — or on the
effect of the two-quarter fee
assessment, which should eventually
furnish the board with "about
$20,000."
"Our financial condition is very
good," he said. "Our net
concert-related balance shows a loss,
but less of a loss than last year at this
time."
How much of a loss? "Well, I can't

tell, exactly. But we're really
appreciative for the fee assessment. I'd
like to extend a thank you to the
whole community for that."
No Big Successes
None of Special Events' Fall
Quarter productions qualified as
resounding successes, but Shannon
attributes this to uncontrollable
factors.
"Stills made money," Shannon
said. "The Miles Davis concert lost
money, but I felt it was justified — we
wanted to experiment with Frost
again. It was a bad day, and the street
crazies are too wierd .. . Stephen Stills
was a sellout; we didn't make a hell of
a lot of money on it, but it was the
first time we (the current Special
Events administration) had done a
show in Maples.
"When our money goes out, people

ask are we losing that much on
concerts? No: that's a lot of office
expenses and other duties we're
charged with — the p.a. system,
helping people who want to hire bands
for dorm parties... A lot of things go
on that are unseen."
Special Problems
"We have special problems here in
terms of expenses. When people try to
compare us to Bill Graham, that's
ridiculous. We spend money, we make
mistakes — but the real thing is
learning from them.
"Management in rock production is
a bizarre thing, unless you're doing it
on a big scale. Some talent, for
example, is just point-blank not
available to us; they'll only do shows
for Graham. When you consider all the
constraints that we have, Christ, I
think we're doing pretty damn well."

Shannon also happens to be
Columbia Records' campus
representative, but he denies any
conflict of interest.
No Conflict Of Interest
"1 think I've avoided any conflict
of interest," he said. "Of course
Columbia tries to get me to book their
artists, and it's really hard to avoid
doing that some of the time, since
about half of the real headliners record
for them. But I certainly don't favor
them; I don't think it's an improper
relationship."
Taj Mahal, incidentally, is under
contract to Columbia, but Shannon
called this "coincidental — he was
available." Miles Davis is also a
Columbia artist.
Shannon called the
recommendations of the University's
Ad Hoc Committee on Rock Concerts,
which banned rock in Frost without
substantial design modification, "all
well taken," but said he feels the
current architectural study of Frost

"could be speeded up."
"Frost is a beautiful place; we
could have some dynamite concerts
there. The Grateful Dead, Cat
Stevens .. . but it's not likely to
happen before next summer."
