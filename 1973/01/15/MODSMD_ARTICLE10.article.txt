the Truman Administrations
foreign policy after World War II.)
"Do your duty and history will do
you justice."
—Harry S Truman
Nearly three decades have
passed since that eventful day in
April, 1945 when Franklin D.
Roosevelt died and his
little-known vice-president, Harry
S Truman, became the thirty-third
president of the United States.
Awed by the responsibility and
still cast in the shadow of
Roosevelt, Truman told reporters,
"Boys, if you ever pray, pray for
me now. I don't know whether
you . . . ever had a load of hay fall
on you, but when they told

me . .. what had happened, I felt
like the moon, the stars, and all
the planets had fallen on me. I've
got the most terribly responsible
job a man ever had." Those
folksy, cliche-riddled sentiments
seemed to reveal much about the
man — his lack of confidence, his
plain origins, his unsophisticated
nature.
His life, despite some early
reversals and minor adversities,
had been a quiet success story. His
advancement was marked by
pluck, tenacity, enthusiasm, and
luck. Raised in small-town
America, he had been a bookish
and respectful youngster whose
weak eyes barred him from sports
and West Point. After graduation
from high school, he labored as a
time-keeper, clerked in banks, and
then returned to the family farm
where he worked a mule and
plow. (In later years he boasted of
his straight furrows.) He also lost
a few thousand dollars investing in
lead mines and oil wells.
Lifted out of Independence,
Missouri by World War I, Truman
found wide experience and great
excitement in the army — combat,
death, and travel. Returning to
Kansas City, he opened a
haberdashery, lost it in the
recession of 1921-22, and moved
ambitiously into politics. Like
many Democratic politicians of
the period, he rose with the aid of
a corrupt machine (the
Pendergasts). He toiled
industriously, avoided public
condemnations, cultivated
alliances, and climbed to the
Senate in 1934. He operated
quietly and cautiously in his first
term, failed to gain Roosevelt's
support in the 1940 primary, but
won national attention in his
second term for his chairmanship
of a special committee to
investigate the war effort at home.
In 1944, he was a compromise
candidate for the nomination of
vice-president, for he had
offended no one and had built a
record of integrity and of loyalty
to party.
Plunged unexpectedly into the

presidency, Truman was
ill-prepared to confront the
massive challenges in domestic
and foreign affairs. During his
twelve weeks as vice-president, he
seldom met with Roosevelt, never
gained his confidence, and was
even kept ignorant of the
Manhattan Project. Truman's
major political problems first
developed on domestic issues.
After the short-lived honeymoon
with Congress, he reached a
stalemate and found many of his
programs blocked. He was unable
to chart a popular or successful
course during the uneasy period
of reconversion and postwar
readjustment.
Casting him aside briefly in
1946 when Democratic candidates
played phonograph records of
Roosevelt, his party still could not
avoid defeat as the GOP exploited
the frustrations and irritations of
disgruntled citizens. "Had
enough? Vote Republican" was
the popular slogan. Meat
shortages, strikes, and high prices
helped elect the Eightieth
Congress. Ironically, it assisted
Truman's re-election in 1948.
Campaigning against the
(allegedly) "Do Nothing"
Congress, Truman reconstructed
the fragmented Democratic
coalition and in the now-famous
"Give 'em hell" campaign won a
surprising victory. His second
administration was marred by
scandal and fell victim to new
challenges and defeats — the
"loss" of China, the rise of
McCarthy, and the prolonged
stalemate in Korea. Eisenhower's
great triumph in 1952 also
symbolized the voters'
repudiation of Truman.
During the Eisenhower years,
the nation's esteem for Truman
slowly rose as the rancor of the
earlier period faded. Evaluating
Chief Executives about a decade
ago, scholars placed Truman in
the ranks of the "near great."
Many admired his pluck, viewed
him as decisive ("the buck stops
here"), forgave him for his
favoritism to cronies, and deemed

him right on the major issues of
his time. Regarding him as a
victim of conservative opposition
and of McCarthy ism, they
heralded his criticism of
McCarthyism and his efforts on
behalf of civil rights for blacks.
His foreign policy received great
praise: He recognized the Soviet
threat, launched the policy of
containment, sponsored the
Truman Doctrine and the Marshall
Plan, extended collective security
to Europe with NATO, and acted
courageously to stop Communist
aggression in Korea.
In recent years, Truman's
presidency has been subject to a
new, less flattering reappraisal.
Some of his failures in domestic
policy can be explained by his
indecision, his poor tactics, his
cabinet system of government —
in short, by his flawed leadership.
During reconversion in 1945-46,
for example, splits within his
administration, his choice of poor
advisers, and their sabotage of his
programs contributed to his
failures. His commitment to the
liberal vision and that vision,
itself, have also been found
wanting.
Even Truman's activities on
behalf of civil rights seem
faltering, ambiguous, and limited.
His conception of equality was
narrow. While he did champion
the boldest civil rights program of
any president until that time, he
also followed a strategy that
raised serious issues about his
commitment. He made legislative
demands that he knew Congress
would not grant but acted more
cautiously and sometimes
reluctantly in areas where he had
administrative authority.
In civil liberties, his
administration's record was
disappointing. His own
loyalty-and-security program,
failing to distinguish between
loyalty and security, applied the
same standards ("reasonable
grounds for belief of disloyalty")
to diplomats and gardeners Its
operation relied upon dubious
procedures: secret investigations,
loose standards of evidence, and
nameless, faceless accusers. The
program ruined some reputations,
intimidated more people, and
thwarted dissent. Despite its
injustices, Truman in his later
years stiffened the program by
creating even more troubling
standards — "reasonable doubt as
to the loyalty of the individual."
In establishing the
loyalty-security program, the
administration acted partly to

defuse the attacks of Republicans
who charged the New Deal-Fair
Deal with "softness on
Communism." The administration
ultimately became a victim of the
pressures it unleashed and of the
attitudes it encouraged. Its
exaggeration of the Communist
menace at home and abroad, its
use of scare tactics to pass Cold
War programs, its attacks on
dissent, its promise to create
absolute security, its
misunderstanding of revolution,
and its pledges to halt the spread
of Communism abroad — all these
contributed to the national
"illusion of omnipotence." How
could the administration explain
spies at home or the "loss" of
China? Was not stopping
espionage or keeping China simply
a matter of will? Were these
failures bungling or betrayal?,
citizens could ask.
An assessment of Truman's
presidency rests largely on his
foreign policy. Perhaps the most
dramatic, troubling event was the
bombing of Hiroshima and
Nagasaki. In sanctioning these
attacks, Truman acted upon the
assumption he inherited from
Roosevelt: the bomb was a
legitimate weapon to be used in
combat. What new president,
poorly informed and fearful of
error, would have had the
boldness, independence, and
initiative to challenge Roosevelt's
assumption? Truman used the
bomb because there was no
thought of not using it, because it
did not seem to raise profound
moral questions, and perhaps also
because there were other
advantages to using it: it might
stop the Russians in Asia and
make them more manageable in
Eastern Europe.
Shortly after Hiroshima, he
cited the attack on Pearl Harbor
in justifying his use of the bomb:
"When you have to deal with a
beast you have to treat him as a
beast." America accepted the use
of the bomb and rejoiced in the
victory that it helped produce.
Truman and his advisers had acted
in accord with the wishes and will
of most Americans in 1945: they
sought retribution and peace and
were willing to sacrifice many
enemy civilian lives in order to
save some American soldiers.
