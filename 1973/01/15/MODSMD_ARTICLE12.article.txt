# Vietnam's lesson
## Limits Of 'Manifest Destiny' 
### 
s george wadleigh

In the 19th Century, American pioneers pushed
their way west of the Mississippi, broke treaties with
the Indians, forcibly relocated the native
inhabitants, and brutalized them when they resisted.
The politicians coined the slogan "Manifest
Destiny" to both excuse and express this implacable
frontier passion, that pushed America's boundaries
as far as the land would go.
Between that time and today, the United States
has reached the humiliating but challenging time
when a child's parents tell him, "Grow up!" — but
they don't mean physical growth anymore.
America's physical growth, of course, hasn't
stopped at land's end, or even Hawaii, but has
branched off into the more subtle but significant
realms of political and financial influence in other
nations' affairs. And yet with all this expansiveness
and meddling, we haven't yet learned how to keep
our own house in order.
Vietnam, the classic albatross of a nation's
history, has begun to teach us. In spite of our
dogged reluctance to learn lessons from this war or
even discuss the question of its legality and
morality, history will stare us in the face till we face
the facts: Americans in Vietnam have reached the
limits of their physical might, at the hands of a
nation's resistance which should remind us of the

"Minuteman," revolutionary ideals in our history
books. These ideals have spurred generations of
Americans to battle and as late as 1937 encouraged
many to die in the struggle against a military regime
in Spain.
In our attempted annihilation of North Vietnam,
we are helping to recreate for our "enemies" a
nationalistic mythology of courageous resistance to
physical power and imperial aggression. A similar
struggle marked our own nation's origins. We are
standing in the way of the North Vietnamese whose
own sense of "manifest destiny" is far more
justified than was our own. As white men made
promises to Indians, the Geneva Accords of 1954
virtually promised the North Vietnamese rule over
their entire country.
After our Revolutionary War, a minority of the
actual combatants (followed and led by sympathetic
statesmen) survived to form a government. After
our own Civil War, one large segment of our country
was humbled and exploited for the political
purposes of the victors. In both these wars, foreign
powers were involved, but they did not determine
the government established. Today who deserves
Vietnam? And who deserves to make that decision?

our own house in order.
Vietnam, the classic albatross of a nation's
history, has begun to teach us. In spite of our
dogged reluctance to learn lessons from this war or
even discuss the question of its legality and
morality, history will stare us in the face till we face
the facts: Americans in Vietnam have reached the
limits of their physical might, at the hands of a
nation's resistance which should remind us of the

"Minuteman," revolutionary ideals in our history
books. These ideals have spurred generations of
Americans to battle and as late as 1937 encouraged
many to die in the struggle against a military regime
in Spain.
In our attempted annihilation of North Vietnam,
we are helping to recreate for our "enemies" a
nationalistic mythology of courageous resistance to
physical power and imperial aggression. A similar
struggle marked our own nation's origins. We are
standing in the way of the North Vietnamese whose
own sense of "manifest destiny" is far more
justified than was our own. As white men made
promises to Indians, the Geneva Accords of 1954
virtually promised the North Vietnamese rule over
their entire country.
After our Revolutionary War, a minority of the
actual combatants (followed and led by sympathetic
statesmen) survived to form a government. After
our own Civil War, one large segment of our country
was humbled and exploited for the political
purposes of the victors. In both these wars, foreign
powers were involved, but they did not determine
the government established. Today who deserves
Vietnam? And who deserves to make that decision?
