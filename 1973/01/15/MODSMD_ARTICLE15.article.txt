# Abominable Snowman Tracks Found

KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) - A U.S.
expedition has made three plaster casts of
ape-like footprints found in the area of the
Himalayas where natives have reported seeing
the Abominable Snowman.
The casts have been placed under lock and
key at the U.S. Embassy here.
A young American zoologist who cast the
strange footprints said they were different
from tracks of known animals his expedition
discovered thousands of feet high in the snow
of a Himalayan valley.
"Our Sherpa guides identified them as
those of Yeti," said the scientist, Jeffrey A.
McNeely, 28, of Los Angeles.
"Yeti" is what the Sherpas, strong
Napalese mountain people who guide foreign
mountaineering expeditions in the Himalayas,
call the legendary being introduced to the
world in 1951 by British journalist Eric
Shipton as the Abominable Snowman. Many
Sherpas claim they have seen it.
Outsiders have never seen the creature,
although a handful starting with Shipton have
photographed unexplained footprints.

McNeely's casts are the first reported taken of
such tracks.
McNeely's team of American zoologists,
ornithologists and botanists is on a 15-month
expedition in the Himalayas' Arul Valley,
about 50 miles east of Mt. Everest, the world's
highest mountain. The expedition is to study
animals and plants of eastern Nepal, including
the Yeti if it can be found.
McNeely, a Peace Corps volunteer based in
Thailand, said in an interview the footprints
resembled those of a mountain gorilla found
14,000 feet high among the peaks of central
Africa.
He said the prints were almost nine inches
long and nearly five inches wide with a
rounded heel.
Two members of the expedition — Dr.
Howard Emery, 34, a Los Angeles physician
and zoologist, and Ted Cronin, 27, an
ornithologist from Wilmington, Del. — found
the footprints on Dec. 20, McNeely said.
They had camped at 12,500 feet the night
before and discovered the tracks the next
morning, passing as close as a foot from their
1

tent. He said the two scientists had heard
nothing during the night.
Notified of the discovery, McNeely rushed
to the area from his lower campsite and made
the casts. He deposited them in embassy
safety lockers when he returned to Katmandu
last week for safekeeping until the expedition
ends next December.
McNeely said he and the others followed
the tracks in six inches of fresh snow for a
distance of a little more than half a mile
before they disappeared in a thicket. He said
they did not count the prints, but "there were
certainly many."
The zoologist estimated that whatever
made the tracks was shorter and stockier than
a man.
He said the team will make no special
efforts to find the snowman.
"The team has several more tasks to carry
on," he said.
"There are areas where Yeti might be
living. We might run across him during our
other scientific observations here."
