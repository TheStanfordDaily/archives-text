# Shuffling The Cards
## Consistency Is Bruin Key 
### Dave Robinson 
UCLA had a few brief scares during its games this
weekend against Stanford and Cal, but the Bruins
ended the weekend in their usual fashion — winning
two games and inspiring long lists of superlatives
from awed fans.
Coach John Wooden's Bruins increased their
three year winning streak to an incredible 57 games,
only three short of the all-time collegiate record set
by Bill Russell's USF teams in the mid 1950'5.
"We're a good team," Wooden said in a classic
understatement at UCLA's practice Thursday
evening at Maples Pavilion. "It's hard to compare
this group to my other teams but I'll say this —
none of my teams have ever been better off after 10
games."
Now, of course, after an 82-67 victory over
Stanford and a 69-50 win over Cal, none of
Wooden's teams have ever been better off after 12
games.
Smart And Consistent
Wooden's 1973 squad, like all of his past UCLA
teams, is a well-molded blend of strength, speed,
and precision. Except for some of Bill Walton's
awesome defensive plays, nobody does anything
really spectacular. Instead the Bruins just play
smart, consistent basketball and capitalize
unmercifully on their opponents' mistakes.
Wooden offered some interesting views of his
teams' success in a December Sports Illustrated
article which honored he and tennis star Billie Jean
King as Sportsman and Sportswoman of the year.
"There is no easy explanation," he said. "What we
do is simple: get in condition, learn fundamentals,
and play together. I don't buy the proposition that
UCLA has risen above the general level of college
basketball. We've been more consistent, come closer
to our natural ability more often than others.
"We've had a great run," Wooden continued,
"and each season I can see this certain carryover to
the new players. Subconsciously, they are almost
afraid to fail. This encourages them to give more in
practice and accept some things in the way of
discipline that they wouldn't otherwise. I get away
with methods other coaches have trouble defining
to their players, but I have no delusions. It's not me;
it is because UCLA wins that the players don't give
me more guff."
Commands Respect
Obviously, Wooden isn't getting much guff from
his players this year. All of the Bruins have short
hair and must express their individuality on the
basketball court alone. But despite objections to
Wooden's conservatism, no one can deny that he
commands respect — it is doubtful that UCLA will
ever be plagued by the type of dissension that

caused Monroe Nash and Vic Kelly to quit (JSC's
team a few weeks ago.
Most of Wooden's players have disdained
controversial subjects during their playing careers
and have concentrated on improving their basketball
skills. UCLA forwards Keith "Smooth as Silk"
Wilkes and Larry Farmer are two excellent examples
of individual progress. Wilkes has developed into
one of the nation's most consistent forwards and
Farmer has vastly improved his offensive skills since
last season. Wilkes, Farmer, and Walton give the
Bruins an exceptionally strong front line.
Still, Wooden isn't totally satisfied with his 1973
Bruins. "One thing about this team is that we're
playing better defense than we were at a comparable
point last year but we're not playing offense as well.
I can't really explain this except that the loss of
Henry Bibby has certainly hurt our offense since we
don't have a real outside scoring threat."
Scoring Balance
Stanford fans would find that statement hard to
believe after watching Larry Hollyfield drop six long
jumpers from the baseline in the second half against
the Cards. Hollyfield, Farmer, and Walton all
finished the game with 18 points as the Bruins
displayed their characteristically balanced scoring
attack.
"We may build our team around one player
(Walton)," says Wooden, "but I would never build
our scoring around one player."
Wooden seemed almost insulted when asked if
seven-foot freshman Kevin Drollinger (now
averaging 27 points for the Bruin frosh) had the
potential to be another Walton. "Drollinger is a fine
prospect," he said, "but not great like Walton.
Walton has already established himself as one of the
greatest college players in history."
Stanford sophomore center Rich Kelley would
certainly agree with Wooden's appraisal of Walton.
"You can do some things against him ... but you're
always aware," Kelley said.
Despite Walton's intimidation, Kelley and his
teammates played a respectable game against the
Bruins. Gutty performances by Dave Frost, Scott
Trobbe, and 6-11 freshman Tim Patterson (whose
brother Steve started on two of UCLA's national
championship teams) kept the Cards in the game for
a little more than a half.
And since Stanford was outscored 10-0 at the
start of the game and 12-2 at the start of the second
half, it is possible to manipulate the statistics to
show that Stanford outscored UCLA 65-60 for 33
of the games' 40 minutes.
But statistics don't really matter against John
Wooden's amazing Bruins.
Except, of course, the final score.

But statistics don't really matter against John
Wooden's amazing Bruins.

loss to UCLA. The Bruins' Bill Walton (32) looks on in the
background.
UCLA had a few brief scares during its games this
weekend against Stanford and Cal, but the Bruins
ended the weekend in their usual fashion — winning
two games and inspiring long lists of superlatives
from awed fans.
Coach John Wooden's Bruins increased their
three year winning streak to an incredible 57 games,
only three short of the all-time collegiate record set
by Bill Russell's USF teams in the mid 1950'5.
"We're a good team," Wooden said in a classic
understatement at UCLA's practice Thursday
evening at Maples Pavilion. "It's hard to compare
this group to my other teams but I'll say this —
none of my teams have ever been better off after 10
games."
Now, of course, after an 82-67 victory over
Stanford and a 69-50 win over Cal, none of
Wooden's teams have ever been better off after 12
games.
Smart And Consistent
Wooden's 1973 squad, like all of his past UCLA
teams, is a well-molded blend of strength, speed,
and precision. Except for some of Bill Walton's
awesome defensive plays, nobody does anything
really spectacular. Instead the Bruins just play
smart, consistent basketball and capitalize
unmercifully on their opponents' mistakes.
Wooden offered some interesting views of his
teams' success in a December Sports Illustrated
article which honored he and tennis star Billie Jean
King as Sportsman and Sportswoman of the year.
"There is no easy explanation," he said. "What we
do is simple: get in condition, learn fundamentals,
and play together. I don't buy the proposition that
UCLA has risen above the general level of college
basketball. We've been more consistent, come closer
to our natural ability more often than others.
"We've had a great run," Wooden continued,
"and each season I can see this certain carryover to
the new players. Subconsciously, they are almost
afraid to fail. This encourages them to give more in
practice and accept some things in the way of
discipline that they wouldn't otherwise. I get away
with methods other coaches have trouble defining
to their players, but I have no delusions. It's not me;
it is because UCLA wins that the players don't give
me more guff."
Commands Respect
Obviously, Wooden isn't getting much guff from
his players this year. All of the Bruins have short
hair and must express their individuality on the
basketball court alone. But despite objections to
Wooden's conservatism, no one can deny that he
commands respect — it is doubtful that UCLA will
ever be plagued by the type of dissension that

caused Monroe Nash and Vic Kelly to quit (JSC's
team a few weeks ago.
Most of Wooden's players have disdained
controversial subjects during their playing careers
and have concentrated on improving their basketball
skills. UCLA forwards Keith "Smooth as Silk"
Wilkes and Larry Farmer are two excellent examples
of individual progress. Wilkes has developed into
one of the nation's most consistent forwards and
Farmer has vastly improved his offensive skills since
last season. Wilkes, Farmer, and Walton give the
Bruins an exceptionally strong front line.
Still, Wooden isn't totally satisfied with his 1973
Bruins. "One thing about this team is that we're
playing better defense than we were at a comparable
point last year but we're not playing offense as well.
I can't really explain this except that the loss of
Henry Bibby has certainly hurt our offense since we
don't have a real outside scoring threat."
Scoring Balance
Stanford fans would find that statement hard to
believe after watching Larry Hollyfield drop six long
jumpers from the baseline in the second half against
the Cards. Hollyfield, Farmer, and Walton all
finished the game with 18 points as the Bruins
displayed their characteristically balanced scoring
attack.
"We may build our team around one player
(Walton)," says Wooden, "but I would never build
our scoring around one player."
Wooden seemed almost insulted when asked if
seven-foot freshman Kevin Drollinger (now
averaging 27 points for the Bruin frosh) had the
potential to be another Walton. "Drollinger is a fine
prospect," he said, "but not great like Walton.
Walton has already established himself as one of the
greatest college players in history."
Stanford sophomore center Rich Kelley would
certainly agree with Wooden's appraisal of Walton.
"You can do some things against him ... but you're
always aware," Kelley said.
Despite Walton's intimidation, Kelley and his
teammates played a respectable game against the
Bruins. Gutty performances by Dave Frost, Scott
Trobbe, and 6-11 freshman Tim Patterson (whose
brother Steve started on two of UCLA's national
championship teams) kept the Cards in the game for
a little more than a half.
And since Stanford was outscored 10-0 at the
start of the game and 12-2 at the start of the second
half, it is possible to manipulate the statistics to
show that Stanford outscored UCLA 65-60 for 33
of the games' 40 minutes.

Bruins. Gutty performances by Dave Frost, Scott
Trobbe, and 6-11 freshman Tim Patterson (whose
brother Steve started on two of UCLA's national
championship teams) kept the Cards in the game for
a little more than a half.
And since Stanford was outscored 10-0 at the
start of the game and 12-2 at the start of the second
half, it is possible to manipulate the statistics to
show that Stanford outscored UCLA 65-60 for 33
of the games' 40 minutes.
But statistics don't really matter against John
Wooden's amazing Bruins.
Except, of course, the final score.

loss to UCLA. The Bruins' Bill Walton (32) looks on in the
background.
UCLA had a few brief scares during its games this
weekend against Stanford and Cal, but the Bruins
ended the weekend in their usual fashion — winning
two games and inspiring long lists of superlatives
from awed fans.
Coach John Wooden's Bruins increased their
three year winning streak to an incredible 57 games,
only three short of the all-time collegiate record set
by Bill Russell's USF teams in the mid 1950'5.
"We're a good team," Wooden said in a classic
understatement at UCLA's practice Thursday
evening at Maples Pavilion. "It's hard to compare
this group to my other teams but I'll say this —
none of my teams have ever been better off after 10
games."
Now, of course, after an 82-67 victory over
Stanford and a 69-50 win over Cal, none of
Wooden's teams have ever been better off after 12
games.
Smart And Consistent
Wooden's 1973 squad, like all of his past UCLA
teams, is a well-molded blend of strength, speed,
and precision. Except for some of Bill Walton's
awesome defensive plays, nobody does anything
really spectacular. Instead the Bruins just play
smart, consistent basketball and capitalize
unmercifully on their opponents' mistakes.
Wooden offered some interesting views of his
teams' success in a December Sports Illustrated
article which honored he and tennis star Billie Jean
King as Sportsman and Sportswoman of the year.
"There is no easy explanation," he said. "What we
do is simple: get in condition, learn fundamentals,
and play together. I don't buy the proposition that
UCLA has risen above the general level of college
basketball. We've been more consistent, come closer
to our natural ability more often than others.
"We've had a great run," Wooden continued,
"and each season I can see this certain carryover to
the new players. Subconsciously, they are almost
afraid to fail. This encourages them to give more in
practice and accept some things in the way of
discipline that they wouldn't otherwise. I get away
with methods other coaches have trouble defining
to their players, but I have no delusions. It's not me;
it is because UCLA wins that the players don't give
me more guff."
Commands Respect
Obviously, Wooden isn't getting much guff from
his players this year. All of the Bruins have short
hair and must express their individuality on the
basketball court alone. But despite objections to
Wooden's conservatism, no one can deny that he
commands respect — it is doubtful that UCLA will
ever be plagued by the type of dissension that

caused Monroe Nash and Vic Kelly to quit (JSC's
team a few weeks ago.
Most of Wooden's players have disdained
controversial subjects during their playing careers
and have concentrated on improving their basketball
skills. UCLA forwards Keith "Smooth as Silk"
Wilkes and Larry Farmer are two excellent examples
of individual progress. Wilkes has developed into
one of the nation's most consistent forwards and
Farmer has vastly improved his offensive skills since
last season. Wilkes, Farmer, and Walton give the
Bruins an exceptionally strong front line.
Still, Wooden isn't totally satisfied with his 1973
Bruins. "One thing about this team is that we're
playing better defense than we were at a comparable
point last year but we're not playing offense as well.
I can't really explain this except that the loss of
Henry Bibby has certainly hurt our offense since we
don't have a real outside scoring threat."
Scoring Balance
Stanford fans would find that statement hard to
believe after watching Larry Hollyfield drop six long
jumpers from the baseline in the second half against
the Cards. Hollyfield, Farmer, and Walton all
finished the game with 18 points as the Bruins
displayed their characteristically balanced scoring
attack.
"We may build our team around one player
(Walton)," says Wooden, "but I would never build
our scoring around one player."
Wooden seemed almost insulted when asked if
seven-foot freshman Kevin Drollinger (now
averaging 27 points for the Bruin frosh) had the
potential to be another Walton. "Drollinger is a fine
prospect," he said, "but not great like Walton.
Walton has already established himself as one of the
greatest college players in history."
Stanford sophomore center Rich Kelley would
certainly agree with Wooden's appraisal of Walton.
"You can do some things against him ... but you're
always aware," Kelley said.
