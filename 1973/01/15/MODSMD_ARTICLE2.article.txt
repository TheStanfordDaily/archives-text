# Police Labor Dispute Continues; Union Asks For Probe Of Firing
## 
### TERRY ANZUR 
The Stanford security officers'
union has asked the National Labor
Relations Board (NLRB) to investigate
the dismissal of former union
president Wayne Warwick, following
the University's decision to uphold the
firing last Thursday.
Albert King, president of the
Stanford Department of Public Safety
Officers Association (SDPSOA) says
that Warwick was fired because of his
union activities. Emil Sarpa, director
of University personnel-employee
relations denied that charge, but
declined to comment further on the
reason for the firing.
Warwick was dismissed last
November after being suspended one
week earlier for working at a part-time
security guard job while he was under
a physician's care for walking
pneumonia and ordered not to work.
No reasons for the dismissal were
made public at that time, but King
maintains that the incident was used as
an excuse to "nail Warwick" for
speaking on behalf of the union
against departmental policies.
Decision Upheld
Warwick then requested a grievance
hearing on the matter, which was held
Jan. 4. The University announced its
decision to uphold the dismissal one
week later.
Doug Barton, the University's staff
counsel for employee relations also
refused to comment on the firing, but
said the University is aware of the
NLRB's investigation of the matter.
The NLRB is also looking into

has refused to negotiate with the
union while implementing
reorganization procedures in the
department. The reforms would
require all Stanford security officers to
have a B.S. or B.A. or equivalent, and
demote some current mobile patrol
officers to a foot patrol or community
service rank.
Negotiation Criticized
The SDPSOA is accusing the
University of "tunnel vision" and
"seeing only what it wants to see" in
its refusal to negotiate the changes and
discuss firing practices with the union.
Barton commented, "The
reorganization has been in the works
for some time and we have discussed it
with the union." King, however, says
the SDPSOA objects to "the whole
attitude presented by the University"
which he feels "has negotiated in bad
faith from the beginning."
No Response
King has written letters to Robert
Minge Brown, President of the Board
of Trustees, Acting President William
F. Miller and Director of Public Safety
Marvin Herrington regarding instances
of prejudicial disciplinary practices
which he has witnessed. King has
received no replies to those letters.
He says the University has refused
to negotiate with the union regarding
wages, health and welfare benefits,
retirement benefits, and job security.
Barton and Scarpa maintain that the
University has received no official
request for such negotiations.

The SPDSOA has affiliated with the
United Peace Officers Association
(UPOA) after the University cited
Section 9 of the NLRB rulings which
prevents the security officers' union
from affiliating with the AFL-CIO or
any organization that does not
specifically represent security guards.
King expects the UPOA to take part in
any negotiations which may take
place.

the people and war in Vietnam, and shared the emotions she returned with.
The Stanford security officers'
union has asked the National Labor
Relations Board (NLRB) to investigate
the dismissal of former union
president Wayne Warwick, following
the University's decision to uphold the
firing last Thursday.
Albert King, president of the
Stanford Department of Public Safety
Officers Association (SDPSOA) says
that Warwick was fired because of his
union activities. Emil Sarpa, director
of University personnel-employee
relations denied that charge, but
declined to comment further on the
reason for the firing.
Warwick was dismissed last
November after being suspended one
week earlier for working at a part-time
security guard job while he was under
a physician's care for walking
pneumonia and ordered not to work.
No reasons for the dismissal were
made public at that time, but King
maintains that the incident was used as
an excuse to "nail Warwick" for
speaking on behalf of the union
against departmental policies.
Decision Upheld
Warwick then requested a grievance
hearing on the matter, which was held
Jan. 4. The University announced its
decision to uphold the dismissal one
week later.
Doug Barton, the University's staff
counsel for employee relations also
refused to comment on the firing, but
said the University is aware of the
NLRB's investigation of the matter.
The NLRB is also looking into

has refused to negotiate with the
union while implementing
reorganization procedures in the
department. The reforms would
require all Stanford security officers to
have a B.S. or B.A. or equivalent, and
demote some current mobile patrol
officers to a foot patrol or community
service rank.
Negotiation Criticized
The SDPSOA is accusing the
University of "tunnel vision" and
"seeing only what it wants to see" in
its refusal to negotiate the changes and
discuss firing practices with the union.
Barton commented, "The
reorganization has been in the works
for some time and we have discussed it
with the union." King, however, says
the SDPSOA objects to "the whole
attitude presented by the University"
which he feels "has negotiated in bad
faith from the beginning."
No Response
King has written letters to Robert
Minge Brown, President of the Board
of Trustees, Acting President William
F. Miller and Director of Public Safety
Marvin Herrington regarding instances
of prejudicial disciplinary practices
which he has witnessed. King has
received no replies to those letters.
He says the University has refused
to negotiate with the union regarding
wages, health and welfare benefits,
retirement benefits, and job security.
Barton and Scarpa maintain that the
University has received no official
request for such negotiations.

The SPDSOA has affiliated with the
United Peace Officers Association
(UPOA) after the University cited
Section 9 of the NLRB rulings which
prevents the security officers' union
from affiliating with the AFL-CIO or
any organization that does not
specifically represent security guards.
King expects the UPOA to take part in
any negotiations which may take
place.
