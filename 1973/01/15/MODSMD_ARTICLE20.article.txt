Francisco Rugby Club on
Saturday, finally winning 19-13.
After Stanford had missed a
penalty kick, SF scored first and
went ahead 3-0. Craig Zaltosky
scored the first try on a
sixty yard run, highlighting an
excellent game for Zaltosky. Chris

Spieller kicked the extra point
and the Cards took the lead 6-3.
The older, experienced City
team dominated the first half
iction. However, the Cardinals'
defense held off several scoring
attempts, and trailed at half-time
by only 10-6.
Shortly after the second half
got under way, the Cards rallied
and scored on a ten yard run by
Tom Klein. The point after

attempt was wide and the score
was tied at 10 all.
Eleven minutes later, center
Eric Cross scored on a five yard
run. With the extra two points
Stanford led 16-10.
Midway through the second
half (halves are forty minutes),
San Francisco scored their third
penalty goal with a twenty yard
kick. This was to be their last tally
as the Cards' tough defense held
for the remainder of the game.
Stanford added a penalty goal
for their final points late in the
game. Speiller kicked one out of
four penalty goals and four extra
points to account for seven
points.
Coach Pete Kmetovic remarked
after the game, "We were not
playing aggressively during the
first half, but we got it moving in
the second. Tom Klein was
outstanding and I was very
pleased with [Eric] Cross. Frank
Charlton and Joe Martin also
played excellent games."
