# Frosh Cagers Win A Pair
## 
### MARK WHITE 
Using first half leads to coast
to victory, the Stanford freshman
basketball team raised its season
record to 3-2 with wins over San
Jose State and the University of
Pacific last Friday and Saturday
evenings at Maples Pavilion.
The Cards edged the Spartans
71-65 on Friday, and defeated the
tigers 58-49 on Saturday night.
It was a different Cardinal
team that took the court against
San Jose State a week after their
loss to the Spartans in San Jose.
Although they missed their first
five shots from the field, the
Cards were more composed
Friday, and when Mike Kehrli
scored the game's first points with
a tip in at the 17:00 mark,
Stanford was ahead to stay.
Kehrli turned in his best
performance of the season as he
connected on six of seven shots in
leading the Cards with 14 points.
Rich Wohlstadter teamed up with
Kehrli during the first half and
scored eight of his 12 points as
the Cards sprinted to a 40-25
halftime lead.
Spartans Stifled
During the first half, San Jose
State failed to move the ball as
well as they had a week before. As
a result, the Spartan's best
players, Ken Mickey and Greg
Chisholm, were held to a
combined total of seven points.
SJS's outside threat, Ken
Hartsough, went 0 for six from
the field and had it not been for
Ron Fair's game-leading 16
points, San Jose State would have
been blown off the court.
The second half found the
Cardinals slipping into
complacency and the Spartans
playing with renewed vigor, but
th? 15 point halftime lead and
Card reserve Dale Peters' nine
points proved to be enough to
allow the Cards to coast to
victory. SJS never came closer
than 10 points until the last 36
seconds as Stanford won, 71-65.
Schweitzer Leads Cards
Stanford's second half ball

handling problems of Friday
carried over into the game with
the University of Pacific Saturday.
However, Ed Schweitzer's 12
straight points early in the game
kept the Cards close to the
well-coached Tigers. When
Wohlstadter became only the
second player other than
Schweitzer to score for the
Cardinals after 11 minutes had
expired in the game, Stanford
established a lead it never
relinquished, 16-14.
Marty Moroski's six straight
points from 3:36 to 2:36 capped
a four minute period in which the
Cards outscored the Spartans,
12-4. Gene Mathis' free throw
with four seconds left gave the
Cardinals a 33-24 halftime lead.
Considering their lack of
depth, UOP played valiantly.

Forward Greg Eccles and guard
Alan Westover led a contingent of
only five players against Stanford.
Only a tight defense and good
outside offensive play kept the
small but quick Tigers in the
game.
Eccles brought UOP to within
three points early in the second
half with three quick baskets, but
Schweitzer again led the Cards out
of danger with three baskets of his
own. Both teams played evenly
the rest of the game and when the
buzzer sounded, Stanford had
claimed a 58-49 victory.
The Cardinal frosh's next game
is against Menlo College in Menlo
Park Friday, followed by a 6 p.m.
contest Saturday against a team
from Cal State Hay ward in Maples
Pavilion.

to victory, the Stanford freshman
basketball team raised its season
record to 3-2 with wins over San
Jose State and the University of
Pacific last Friday and Saturday
evenings at Maples Pavilion.
The Cards edged the Spartans
71-65 on Friday, and defeated the
tigers 58-49 on Saturday night.
It was a different Cardinal
team that took the court against
San Jose State a week after their
loss to the Spartans in San Jose.
Although they missed their first
five shots from the field, the
Cards were more composed
Friday, and when Mike Kehrli
scored the game's first points with
a tip in at the 17:00 mark,
Stanford was ahead to stay.
Kehrli turned in his best
performance of the season as he
connected on six of seven shots in
leading the Cards with 14 points.
Rich Wohlstadter teamed up with
Kehrli during the first half and
scored eight of his 12 points as
the Cards sprinted to a 40-25
halftime lead.
Spartans Stifled
During the first half, San Jose
State failed to move the ball as
well as they had a week before. As
a result, the Spartan's best
players, Ken Mickey and Greg
Chisholm, were held to a
combined total of seven points.
SJS's outside threat, Ken
Hartsough, went 0 for six from
the field and had it not been for
Ron Fair's game-leading 16
points, San Jose State would have
been blown off the court.
The second half found the
Cardinals slipping into
complacency and the Spartans
playing with renewed vigor, but
th? 15 point halftime lead and
Card reserve Dale Peters' nine
points proved to be enough to
allow the Cards to coast to
victory. SJS never came closer
than 10 points until the last 36
seconds as Stanford won, 71-65.
Schweitzer Leads Cards
Stanford's second half ball

handling problems of Friday
carried over into the game with
the University of Pacific Saturday.
However, Ed Schweitzer's 12
straight points early in the game
kept the Cards close to the
well-coached Tigers. When
Wohlstadter became only the
second player other than
Schweitzer to score for the
Cardinals after 11 minutes had
expired in the game, Stanford
established a lead it never
relinquished, 16-14.
Marty Moroski's six straight
points from 3:36 to 2:36 capped
a four minute period in which the
Cards outscored the Spartans,
12-4. Gene Mathis' free throw
with four seconds left gave the
Cardinals a 33-24 halftime lead.
Considering their lack of
depth, UOP played valiantly.

Forward Greg Eccles and guard
Alan Westover led a contingent of
only five players against Stanford.
Only a tight defense and good
outside offensive play kept the
small but quick Tigers in the
game.
Eccles brought UOP to within
three points early in the second
half with three quick baskets, but
Schweitzer again led the Cards out
of danger with three baskets of his
own. Both teams played evenly
the rest of the game and when the
buzzer sounded, Stanford had
claimed a 58-49 victory.
The Cardinal frosh's next game
is against Menlo College in Menlo
Park Friday, followed by a 6 p.m.
contest Saturday against a team
from Cal State Hay ward in Maples
Pavilion.
