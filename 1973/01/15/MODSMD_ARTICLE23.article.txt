# Cards Lose To Bruins, Trojans
## 
### STAN WILSON 
The Stanford Cardinals played
one of their best and one of their
worst games of the season this
weekend, but their efforts were to
no avail, as the Cards dropped an
82-67 decision to UCLA on
Friday night, and were
overwhelmed 83-67 on Saturday
by USC.
Stanford played thirty minutes
of good basketball against the
number-one ranked Bruins, but
streaks at the beginning of each
half doomed the Cards. Almost
before you could say Bill Walton,
the Bruins had scored five quick
buckets on fast break goals by
Larry Hollyfield and Larry
Farmer, and the dazed Cards
trailed 10-0.
But the always-steady Dave
Frost, who seems to play best
when needed the most, scored the
Cards' first ten points to keep
them in the contest.
Frost connected on four
medium-ranged jump shots and
two free throws, one of those a
technical-foul by the
hyperemotional Hollyfield, who
planted a pass in the back of Mel
Arterberry's head for no apparent
reason.
Bruins Consistent
The consistent Bruins went to

work, building up a 34-19 lead
with 5:58 to go in the half. It
appeared as if the Bruins would
breeze the rest of the way, but
soph forward Scott Trobbe
sparked a Cardinal surge at the
end of the ha'f. A packed house
of over 7000 fans roared their
approval as Stanford pulled within
eight on Trobbe's rafter-reaching
jump shots and buckets by Bob
Buell and center Rich Kelley.
But the beginning of the
second half was as bad as the
beginning of the first. Hollyfield
got hot, hitting four bombs from
the corner. The Bruins outscored
the Cards 12-2 in the first five
minutes, and the issue was all but
decided.
Although coach Howie Dallmar
explained that he was "never
satisfied with a loss," there were
some bright spots for the Cards.
Frost led all scorers with 22
points, and 6-11 freshman Tim
Patterson displayed some fine
shooting in the second half. The
remarkably confident Patterson,
although going 0-6 in the first
half, came out shooting after the
intermission, and canned five
badly-needed field goals.
Balanced Attack
The Bruins featured their usual
balanced attack, with Walton,
Hollyfield, and Farmer all scoring
18 points. Keith Wilkes added 12
more. Walton led the Bruins on
the boards as he pulled down 17
rebounds. Kelley grabbed seven
bounds to pace the cards in that
category.
A crowd of 5300 fans gathered
at Maples Pavilion on Saturday
night to witness Stanford's
sloppiest performance to date.
The Cards turned the ball over 27
times to Southern Cal, and though
they outshot the Trojans 54
percent to 46 percent, they
attempted only 46 shots to USC's
80.
Stanford trailed by only two at
halftime, 32-30, but in ten
minutes SC outscored Stanford
28-8 to turn the game into a rout.
There were no bright spots for the
Cards, with the exception of Mel
Arterberry's smooth performance.
Arterberry netted 14 points and
had three assists.

some bright spots for the Cards.
Frost led all scorers with 22
points, and 6-11 freshman Tim
Patterson displayed some fine
shooting in the second half. The
remarkably confident Patterson,
although going 0-6 in the first
half, came out shooting after the
intermission, and canned five
badly-needed field goals.
Balanced Attack
The Bruins featured their usual
balanced attack, with Walton,
Hollyfield, and Farmer all scoring
18 points. Keith Wilkes added 12
more. Walton led the Bruins on
the boards as he pulled down 17
rebounds. Kelley grabbed seven
bounds to pace the cards in that
category.
A crowd of 5300 fans gathered
at Maples Pavilion on Saturday
night to witness Stanford's
sloppiest performance to date.
The Cards turned the ball over 27
times to Southern Cal, and though
they outshot the Trojans 54
percent to 46 percent, they
attempted only 46 shots to USC's
80.
Stanford trailed by only two at
halftime, 32-30, but in ten
minutes SC outscored Stanford
28-8 to turn the game into a rout.
There were no bright spots for the
Cards, with the exception of Mel
Arterberry's smooth performance.
Arterberry netted 14 points and
had three assists.
The Stanford Cardinals played
one of their best and one of their
worst games of the season this
weekend, but their efforts were to
no avail, as the Cards dropped an
82-67 decision to UCLA on
Friday night, and were
overwhelmed 83-67 on Saturday
by USC.
Stanford played thirty minutes
of good basketball against the
number-one ranked Bruins, but
streaks at the beginning of each
half doomed the Cards. Almost
before you could say Bill Walton,
the Bruins had scored five quick
buckets on fast break goals by
Larry Hollyfield and Larry
Farmer, and the dazed Cards
trailed 10-0.
But the always-steady Dave
Frost, who seems to play best
when needed the most, scored the
Cards' first ten points to keep
them in the contest.
Frost connected on four
medium-ranged jump shots and
two free throws, one of those a
technical-foul by the
hyperemotional Hollyfield, who
planted a pass in the back of Mel
Arterberry's head for no apparent
reason.
Bruins Consistent
The consistent Bruins went to

work, building up a 34-19 lead
with 5:58 to go in the half. It
appeared as if the Bruins would
breeze the rest of the way, but
soph forward Scott Trobbe
sparked a Cardinal surge at the
end of the ha'f. A packed house
of over 7000 fans roared their
approval as Stanford pulled within
eight on Trobbe's rafter-reaching
jump shots and buckets by Bob
Buell and center Rich Kelley.
But the beginning of the
second half was as bad as the
beginning of the first. Hollyfield
got hot, hitting four bombs from
the corner. The Bruins outscored
the Cards 12-2 in the first five
minutes, and the issue was all but
decided.
Although coach Howie Dallmar
explained that he was "never
satisfied with a loss," there were
some bright spots for the Cards.
