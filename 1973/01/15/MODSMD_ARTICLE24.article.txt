# Wrestlers Defeat Hayward
## 
### 
Stanford's wrestling team
dropped two of three matches
over the weekend, losing to
Cal-Bakersfield 18-21 and
Nebraska-Omaha 3-36 on Friday,
but coming back to overwhelm
Cal State-Hayward 38-6 Saturday.
Against Nebraska-Omaha, the
NAIA's top-ranked team, the
Cardinals could take only one
decision, that a victory by
Emmett Stanton at 158 pounds.
Several other wrestlers came close
to scoring upsets, including blind
Bob Sweetman at 126, who nearly
upset the NAIA's No. 2 wrestler
in that division, but lost in the
final minutes.
The loss to Bakersfield, the
other opponent in Encina Gym
Friday, was unfortunate, as Chris
Horpel, who is generally the
team's surest bet for a victory,
was ill and the team had to forfeit
at 150 lbs., thus giving the
Cardinals minus six points instead
of a plus six, which would have
won the meet easily.
Saturday, a crowd of about
150 in Encina watched an

impressive performance by several
Stanford wrestlers.
Heavyweight Art Estrada tore
into his opponent, a league
champion. Estrada took a quick
10-1 lead before pinning his
opponent early in the second
period, thrilling the audience.
Earlier Ken Krebs (142 lbs.),
won an easy 12-1 decision in
impressive fashion, with his
opponent simply hanging on to
avoid being pinned.
Other Stanford wins came
from Sweetman, a 7-4 victor at

126, Dan Mueller, who won 13-2
at 134, and John Govea, who won
by a 7-3 tally at 190. Stanford
also won three forfeit victories in
the match.
"It was a real team effort,"
said Coach Joe DeMeo. "Just
about everyone did what he had
to do to win."
Next Saturday, the Cardinals
host California, winners of the
recent Hayward tournament in
which Stanford finished fourth, in
what should be a tough meet. The
match is set to begin at 7:30 p.m.
