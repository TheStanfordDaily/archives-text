Nixon, Kissinger Confer
KEY BISCAYNE — President Nixon received Henry
Kissinger's report on his Paris negotiations
yesterday, and then ordered a trusted aide to fly to
Saigon to tell President Nguyen Van Thieu of secret
steps toward peace in Vietnam.
The quick trip to South Vietnam by Gen.
Alexander M. Haig Jr., Nixon's chief liason with
Thieu, was seen as another sign that a peace
agreement might be near.
But as Nixon met at his bayside villa with
Kissinger and Haig, the White House refused to
amplify on Kissinger's statement Saturday before
leaving Paris that his six days of talks with the
North Vietnamese had been "very extensive and
very useful."
The White House said Nixon, Kissinger and Haig
met for four hours, from midmorning to early
afternoon, and added that the President planned
another session with Kissinger in the evening.
Haig departed at 6:59 p.m. for what Presidential
press secretary Ronald L. Ziegler described as a
mission to "discuss the current status of
negotiations with President Thieu."
Ziegler said Haig would confer with leaders of
three other nations touched by the Indochina
conflict — Laos, Cambodia and Thailand.
The presidential spokesman would not say if or
when Kissinger would return to Paris, but the
phrasing of his reply — "I have no information on
Dr. Kissinger's further travels," — spurred
speculation that Nixon's top foreign policy aide
would soon resume negotiations with Hanoi's Le
Due Tho, perhaps as early as midweek.
Viet Cong Echo N. Viet Hopes
PARIS — The Viet Cong joined North Vietnam
yesterday in asserting that progress was made in the
secret peace talks between Henry A. Kissinger and
Hanoi's Le Due Tho, but gave no details.
The talks were interrupted Saturday, and
Kissinger flew to report to President Nixon in Key
Biscayne, Fla., on the six days of secret bargaining.
In a statement issued as Kissinger left, the North
Vietnamese delegation said the six days of intensive
negotiations "have made progress." It added that
discussions at the expert level would continue
today.
A Viet Cong communique said Tho and the
second-ranking North Vietnamese negotiator, Xuan
Thuy, met the acting Viet Cong delegate, Dinh Ba
Thi, yesterday morning to report details of the
talks. The Viet Cong, like the South Vietnamese
government, were excluded from the secret
negotiations.
More Watergate Guilty Pleas?
WASHINGTON — The Watergate trial, dogged from
the start by rumors and developments out of the
jury's hearing, goes into the second week today with
the expectation that four more defendants want to
plea guilty.
If they do so, it will be against the advice of their
lawyer, Henry B. Rothblatt of New York, who says
he will resign first.

"What have they got to gain by pleading guilty?"
Rothblatt said yesterday. 'They'll go to jail, they'll
waive their constitutional right to appeal and they
will serve as many years in prison as the judge
orders.
"How can any intelligent lawyer be a party to
bluntly destroying all legal and constitutional rights
of his clients?"
Rothblatt represents Bernard L. Barker, Eugenio
R. Martinez, Fran A. Sturgis and Virgilio R.
Gonzalez, all from Miami and all charged in seven
counts with, conspiracy, burglary and attempting to
bug the offices of the Democratic National
Committee in the Watergate complex.
It was understood that the other two defendants,
G. Gordon Liddy, 42, and James W. McCord Jr., 53,
were standing firm in their determination to go
through with the trial. Both men face the additional
charge of actually intercepting oral and wire
communications, but Liddy alone is not charged
with two counts of possessing intercepting devices.
Meir And Pope To Parley
ROME — Premier Golda Meir arrived here yesterday
for an unprecedented meeting with Pope Paul VI.
They are expected to discuss Israel's control of
Jerusalem and its holy places.
The Israeli leader will meet the 75-year-old
pontiff today at his invitation, an announcement in
Jerusalem said.
Italian police laid on the tightest security seen in
Rome in years for Meir's arrival from Paris
because of Palestinian activity here.
More than 300 policemen armed with automatic
weapons blocked all roads around the airport.
Armed guards were posted at Rome's synagogue
near the Tiber River, Israeli government offices and
the villa where Meir is staying.
The Vatican has been suggesting that Jerusalem
should be internationalized, but the Israelis reject
this, saying they have properly cared for its holy
places and have permitted worshippers of all faiths
to visit.
The Israelis also express fear of losing access to
Jewish holy places, including the Wailing Wall. The
most sacred of the Christian shrines in East
Jerusalem is the Church of the Holy Supulchre,
marking Calvary where Christ was crucified and was
buried.
Jury Deliberates Corona Case
FAIRFIELD, Calif. — Juan Corona remained in
satisfactory condition yesterday after suffering a
possible heart attack on the third day of jury
deliberations in his mass murder trial.
The 10 man-two woman jury is scheduled to
begin its fourth day of deliberations today.
A hospital spokesman said Corona, accused in
the hacking deaths of 25 migrant farm workers in
the spring of 1971, was "very comfortable, without
pain and feeling quite well."
"We just plan to continue observation and
evaluation," said Dr. Gordon Mannerstedt of the
state medical facility at nearby Vacaville.
Dr. Mannerstedt said a final diagnosis expected
"within the next day or so" would determine

Corona's ability to appear in court.
Mannerstedt said the severity of Corona's attack
was still undetermined but did not rule out the
possibility that the 38-year-old former farm labor
contractor, accused of the largest number of murder
charges in U.S. history, could be confined for
"several weeks."
W. Germans Protest Viet War
BONN — Police clashed with demonstrators in front
of Bonn's city hall yesterday during a mass leftist
protest against the Vietnam war by about 20,000
persons from all over West Germany.
Fighting off scores of demonstrators, some of
whom wielded wooden flag staffs, about 50 police
cleared the steps in front of the city hall to shouts
of "Bulls! Pigs! Murderers!"
Police spokesmen said three demonstrators were
detained and soon afterwards released, but no
serious injuries were reported.
Nader To Aid Newsmen
WASHINGTON — Ralph Nader's Center for Study
of Responsive Law and the National Press Club
yesterday announced formation of a group to help
reporters gain access to information withheld by the
government.
The organization, named the Press Information
Center, will be headed by Ronald Plesser, a lawyer
associated with the Nader group who specializes in
matters involving the Freedom of Information Act.
A reporter, the group said in a statement, often
needs "more information than the government
chooses to release, and he must challenge the
government's withholding of information.
"The center is attempting, on behalf of the press
community, to make available the tools necessary to
challenge the withholding of information."
Dolphins Whip Redskins
LOS ANGELES — The Dolphin "Unbeatables"
choked Washington's offense Sunday and climaxed
the National Football League's first perfect season
with a 14-7 victory in the world championship
game.
Bob Griese rifled a 28-yard scoring pass to little
Howard Twilley and Jim Kiick crunched one yard
for a second touchdown, but it was a day for the
defense before a record Super Bowl crowd of
90,182 at the Los Angeles Coliseum.
Miami's defense strongarmed the Redskins and it
took a freak play in the waning moments to put
Washington on the scoreboard and erase the
embarassment of being the first Super Bowl team to
be shut out.
