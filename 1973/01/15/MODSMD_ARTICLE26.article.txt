# World Clergy Unites Against Vietnam War
## 
### JAMES LOBSENZ 
Religion Prof. Robert McAfee
Brown, interim dean of the chapel,
returned Friday night from a six-day
tour of Europe designed to raise
foreign opposition to President
Nixon's bombing policy in Vietnam.
Brown led a group of six American
religious leaders.
"We felt," said Brown, "that we are
not able, as Americans, to end the war
by ourselves. We need the help of the
world community."
Brown termed the tour "a mission
of desperation" aimed at causing "the
pressure of world opinion to mount"
so that further bombing such as the
recent attacks on Hanoi will be
impossible.
The intense bombing of Hanoi that
occurred over the Christmas holiday
was "the most immediate catalyst" for
the trip, said Brown. Although the
bombing north of the 20th parallel
had stopped by the time Brown and
his associates left on their tour, Brown
maintained "we were and are still
fearful that it could start again at any
time. Any snags in the present peace
talks could lead to even bigger
bombings."
Report To Pope
The touring group addressed the
Pontifical Commission on Justice and
Peace in the Vatican, and delivered to
the Pope a letter in which they
requested that he "unequivocally and
unhesitatingly condemn" the recent
bombing of North Vietnam. They also
requested that the Pope or an emissary
of the Vatican visit Hanoi personally
in order to give a direct report to the
world on the extent of the damage
caused by American bombing.
They also presented the Pope with
the symbolic gift of a candle made out
of the mold of an anti-personnel
Guava bomb. By lighting the candle
the bomb is to become a beacon of
light and hope instead of an
instrument of destruction.
In London the group conferred
with leaders of the British Council of
Churches including the Archbishop of

Canterbury and the Bishop of London.
Church Leaders Consulted
In Holland they met with the
Executive Committee of the Dutch
Council of Churches and with the
heads of the Dutch Reform Church.
They met with Cardinal Alfrink, a
president of the Second Vatican
Council of 1962-65.
They addressed the Synod of the
Evangelical Church in the Rhineland,
and talked with the President of West
Germany, Gustav Heinemann.
The reaction to their tour in West
Germany was complicated by two
factors, said Brown. First there was
the feeling that stems from the entire
World War II guilt complex of the
German people: "How can we speak
any word that the American people
are likely to take seriously?"
And second, there exists the
feeling, said Brown, "that American
might withdraw its support for us.
Berlin could fall if America decided it
wasn't important anymore."
Positive Reaction
The most positive reaction was
found in Holland, according to Brown,
where all eight political parties have
condemned President Nixon's
bombing policy.
Brown said that he was struck by
the significant juxtaposition that
occurred during a press conference
they held in Hague, where they
displayed a Guava anti-personnel
bomb just 200 yards from the site of
the 1907 Hague Convention where it
was stipulated that the employment of
"arms, projectiles or material
calculated to cause unnecessary
suffering" was prohibited by
international law.
Brown was accompanied on the trip
by Methodist Bishop James
Armstrong, Rabbi Leonard Beerman
of the Leo Baeck Temple of Los
Angeles, Harvey Cox, professor of
theology at Harvard; Episcopal Bishop
of the Diocese of Pennsylvania Robert
DeWitt.; and Sister Mary Luke Tobin, a
representative of the Sisters of
Loretta.

Brown, interim dean of the chapel,
returned Friday night from a six-day
tour of Europe designed to raise
foreign opposition to President
Nixon's bombing policy in Vietnam.
Brown led a group of six American
religious leaders.
"We felt," said Brown, "that we are
not able, as Americans, to end the war
by ourselves. We need the help of the
world community."
Brown termed the tour "a mission
of desperation" aimed at causing "the
pressure of world opinion to mount"
so that further bombing such as the
recent attacks on Hanoi will be
impossible.
The intense bombing of Hanoi that
occurred over the Christmas holiday
was "the most immediate catalyst" for
the trip, said Brown. Although the
bombing north of the 20th parallel
had stopped by the time Brown and
his associates left on their tour, Brown
maintained "we were and are still
fearful that it could start again at any
time. Any snags in the present peace
talks could lead to even bigger
bombings."
Report To Pope
The touring group addressed the
Pontifical Commission on Justice and
Peace in the Vatican, and delivered to
the Pope a letter in which they
requested that he "unequivocally and
unhesitatingly condemn" the recent
bombing of North Vietnam. They also
requested that the Pope or an emissary
of the Vatican visit Hanoi personally
in order to give a direct report to the
world on the extent of the damage
caused by American bombing.
They also presented the Pope with
the symbolic gift of a candle made out
of the mold of an anti-personnel
Guava bomb. By lighting the candle
the bomb is to become a beacon of
light and hope instead of an
instrument of destruction.
In London the group conferred
with leaders of the British Council of
Churches including the Archbishop of

Canterbury and the Bishop of London.
Church Leaders Consulted
In Holland they met with the
Executive Committee of the Dutch
Council of Churches and with the
heads of the Dutch Reform Church.
They met with Cardinal Alfrink, a
president of the Second Vatican
Council of 1962-65.
They addressed the Synod of the
Evangelical Church in the Rhineland,
and talked with the President of West
Germany, Gustav Heinemann.
The reaction to their tour in West
Germany was complicated by two
factors, said Brown. First there was
the feeling that stems from the entire
World War II guilt complex of the
German people: "How can we speak
any word that the American people
are likely to take seriously?"
And second, there exists the
feeling, said Brown, "that American
might withdraw its support for us.
Berlin could fall if America decided it
wasn't important anymore."
Positive Reaction
The most positive reaction was
found in Holland, according to Brown,
where all eight political parties have
condemned President Nixon's
bombing policy.
Brown said that he was struck by
the significant juxtaposition that
occurred during a press conference
they held in Hague, where they
displayed a Guava anti-personnel
bomb just 200 yards from the site of
the 1907 Hague Convention where it
was stipulated that the employment of
"arms, projectiles or material
calculated to cause unnecessary
suffering" was prohibited by
international law.
Brown was accompanied on the trip
by Methodist Bishop James
Armstrong, Rabbi Leonard Beerman
of the Leo Baeck Temple of Los
Angeles, Harvey Cox, professor of
theology at Harvard; Episcopal Bishop
of the Diocese of Pennsylvania Robert
DeWitt.; and Sister Mary Luke Tobin, a
representative of the Sisters of
Loretta.
