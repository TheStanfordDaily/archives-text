# Seale Challenges Reading
## 'People's Machine' Seeks Victory 
### MARK SIMONIAN 
Black Panther candidate for Mayor of Oakland
Bobby Seale announced the beginning of a
"people's political machine" to unify Oakland's
minority voters and to help defeat incumbent
Mayor John Reading in a "landslide victory."
Addressing a crowd of over 100 people Saturday
at St. Anne's Church in Palo Alto, Seale disclosed
that his campaign workers had already registered
over 29,000 new minority voters in a six-month
drive ending last October. The candidate stated that
"by election time, we will probably have 200,000
registered." Reading was originally elected by a
166,000 vote "landslide."
Seale stressed that only through unification and
organization of all minority communities — blacks,
Chicanos, poor whites — could a government
representative of the people be elected.
"We want to stop apathy. We want to stop the
situation where the people are not in control of the
institutions that affect their lives, because that's
really what 'power to the people' means," he stated.
Programs Needed
He criticized the incumbent for a lack of
communication with the people noting that a
private survey of Oakland's black community
indicated that "90 percent don't know who the

mayor is." Seale also pointed to the lack of
city-originated programs dealing with real
community programs.
"The police department's budget is $17.7 million
already. They have helicopters in the sky while
senior citizens are getting mugged on the ground,"
he said.
Seale cited the Black Panther's "Senior Citizens
Safe" program as one example of a project that the
city could have begun, but didn't because of a lack
of funds. The plan provides personal escorts for the
elderly to see that they travel safely to and from the
bank to collect social security and pension checks.
The candidate indicated that this program might
be extended to supply senior citizens with escorts
throughout the year to help with shopping and
other daily business.
Free Clinics
He also described the free community medical
and dental clinics, free transportation system, and
youth and job training programs that he would
support as mayor.
Seale questioned the use of city funds for
Oakland's port. He cited the lack of income from
the port that could be recycled into the community
to fund community projects.
"The second largest containerized port in the

world is in Oakland, California, second only to New
York's. The port of Oakland has a $90 million
budget every year. That's a larger budget than the
city of Oakland," the Black Panther stated.
Mere $11 Million
"The city of Oakland lets those businessmen
slide on those franchises, those leases on the land
that the city controls. They're getting a mere $11
million a year, and you know, we've got research
teams trying to find out where that $11 million
goes."
Seale also spoke out against welfare, saying that
he and tne minority community would rather see an
increase in employment. The candidate suggested
that Oakland's federal revenue-sharing money,
ranging from $4.3 • $6 million annually over the
next five years, could be used to induce businesses
to hire more minority workers and provide better
job training programs.
Optimistic about the upcoming election, Seale
envisioned the "people's political machine" growing
in strength and eventually controlling all of
Oakland's city politics. The Black Panthers, he said,
are planning to slate three city council candidates in
the election this April 17, and run five more in
1975.

Chicanos, poor whites — could a government
representative of the people be elected.
"We want to stop apathy. We want to stop the
situation where the people are not in control of the
institutions that affect their lives, because that's
really what 'power to the people' means," he stated.
Programs Needed
He criticized the incumbent for a lack of
communication with the people noting that a
private survey of Oakland's black community
indicated that "90 percent don't know who the

mayor is." Seale also pointed to the lack of
city-originated programs dealing with real
community programs.
"The police department's budget is $17.7 million
already. They have helicopters in the sky while
senior citizens are getting mugged on the ground,"
he said.
Seale cited the Black Panther's "Senior Citizens
Safe" program as one example of a project that the
city could have begun, but didn't because of a lack
of funds. The plan provides personal escorts for the
elderly to see that they travel safely to and from the
bank to collect social security and pension checks.
The candidate indicated that this program might
be extended to supply senior citizens with escorts
throughout the year to help with shopping and
other daily business.
Free Clinics
He also described the free community medical
and dental clinics, free transportation system, and
youth and job training programs that he would
support as mayor.
Seale questioned the use of city funds for
Oakland's port. He cited the lack of income from
the port that could be recycled into the community
to fund community projects.
"The second largest containerized port in the

world is in Oakland, California, second only to New
York's. The port of Oakland has a $90 million
budget every year. That's a larger budget than the
city of Oakland," the Black Panther stated.
Mere $11 Million
"The city of Oakland lets those businessmen
slide on those franchises, those leases on the land
that the city controls. They're getting a mere $11
million a year, and you know, we've got research
teams trying to find out where that $11 million
goes."
Seale also spoke out against welfare, saying that
he and tne minority community would rather see an
increase in employment. The candidate suggested
that Oakland's federal revenue-sharing money,
ranging from $4.3 • $6 million annually over the
next five years, could be used to induce businesses
to hire more minority workers and provide better
job training programs.
Optimistic about the upcoming election, Seale
envisioned the "people's political machine" growing
in strength and eventually controlling all of
Oakland's city politics. The Black Panthers, he said,
are planning to slate three city council candidates in
the election this April 17, and run five more in
1975.
Black Panther candidate for Mayor of Oakland
Bobby Seale announced the beginning of a
"people's political machine" to unify Oakland's
minority voters and to help defeat incumbent
Mayor John Reading in a "landslide victory."
Addressing a crowd of over 100 people Saturday
at St. Anne's Church in Palo Alto, Seale disclosed
that his campaign workers had already registered
over 29,000 new minority voters in a six-month
drive ending last October. The candidate stated that
"by election time, we will probably have 200,000
registered." Reading was originally elected by a
166,000 vote "landslide."
Seale stressed that only through unification and
organization of all minority communities — blacks,
Chicanos, poor whites — could a government
representative of the people be elected.
