# Baez Relates Vietnam Experiences; Lambastes 'Outrageous Bombing'

### BILL WEINSTEIN 
Pacifist-singer Joan Baez, recently
returned from a trip to Hanoi, told an
overflow crowd of 2000 at Stanford
Memorial Church Friday night that
"we can't sit around and say Nixon is
a Hitler because a Hitler cannot exist
without a people supporting him."
Earlier Friday, the anti-war activist
led 300 people in a march down

University Avenue to Lytton Plaza.
There she criticized the bombing as
"outrageous, heart rending, and
terrifying."
Baez and three others, including
Nuremburg war crimes prosecutor
Telford Taylor, went to Hanoi with
the intention of staying only a week
but were delayed by U.S. bombing
raids. Baez spent her nights there in
bomb shelters and while in them
described herself as "full of anxieties
on hearing of the next raids." She said
her own emotions were a "mercury of
fear and anxieties that were hard to
gauge. I couldn't keep my legs from
shaking."
The singer expressed "mild shock"
at first seeing the ruins of Bach Mai
hospital. She said she saw dead and
wounded patients strewn everywhere
and that her guide on the trip lost his
entire family in the bombing.
Baez stated that destruction was
extensive in Hanoi "with craters 15
feet deep," and that by the third day
80 percent of the North Vietnamese
capitol's population was evacuated
from the city.
The pacifist returned to the United

States with 600 letters from
prisoners-of-war and visited 13 POWs
during her stay. She said the captured
Americans were in a state of shock,
their morale was "poor," and that
"bombs were falling 100 meters from
the prison camp." Baez said she
viewed the pilots as "future Vietnam
Veterans Against the War and as human
beings. I cannot celebrate their
deaths."
Baez called the Vietnamese "the
gentlest people in the world. They are
depending on us to uphold our part to
end the bombing." She continued,
"We have a duty to be sensitive to
people's needs and desires. If you're
about to go out and do murder, don't
do it. All human life is sacred."
The activist attributed the periodic
halts in bombing of President Nixon's
not to peace overtures but rather to
Russian supplied SAM 111 missies
which shot down many B-52's. She
also said that she saw wounded and
dead Polish sailors hit by bombers in
Haiphong harbor.
Distrusts McGovem
The crowd applauded Baez when

she said about George McGovern, "I
voted which is a big step for me, being
a non-voter. I encouraged people to
vote for McGovem. I did not feel like
putting my energies into voting for a
man I did not trust."
Baez explained that the Vietnam
War could be ended by not paying
taxes. She explained that the
Vietnamese people were at the
"receiving end of 60 percent of our
taxes" and that by continuing to pay
taxes we would be supporting an
immoral war.
The singer stated that, "You and I
must be absolutely willing to lose our
lives, jobs, and work in stopping this
support of the war. It means you and I
are absolutely serious about not
paying income taxes."
Baez said she plans to tour the
country to encourage Americans to
stop paying taxes and to more openly
resist the Vietnam War. She also will
be working for the Bach Mai Hospital
Fund which is trying to raise money to
rebuild the medical facility in North
Vietnam. Baez said that the fund had
already collected $400,000.
