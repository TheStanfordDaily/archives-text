# Power Blackouts Plague University
## 
### SHARYL SWOPE 
The latest in a series of power
failures that have been plaguing the
University left large portions of the
campus without electricity for nearly
two hours Friday evening.
Roble, Lagunita, and Florence
Moore Halls were blacked out, as well
as Tresidder Union, the Storke
Publications Building, and a
substantial portion of the Quad.

The failure was at least the eighth
since the start of the academic year.
According to utilities
superintendent Homer Davis, the
blackouts were due to the breakdown
of four underground high-voltage
cables. However, the reason for the
cable failures remains unclear.
Davis ruled out the possibility of
sabotage saying that the underground
cables were difficult to reach for

repairmen, much less for a potential
saboteur. He also said that the
installation of the cables and periodic
testing had not revealed any faults.
Also considered as a possible
explanation was the age of the cables.
A reasonable life expectancy for such
high-voltage lines is estimated at 25 to
30 years. However, the cables involved
in the recent failures were only eight
to 18 years old.
The various cable breakdowns have
struck widely dispersed sections of
campus. The most serious failure was
an eight-hour blackout of the
Computation Center and the
Communication Department on Oct.
26. Large portions of Quad and the

buildings southward were without
power from the night of Oct. 22 to the
morning of Oct. 23. Other failures
affected Florence Moore, Roble,
Lagunita, The Knoll, and parts of the
Row. In most cases, power was
restored within one or two hours.
Temporary replacement cables have
been installed at the different
breakdown sites: Lane W near the
Hansen Labs, the Steam Plant,
between Stern and Cowell, and at the
Geology corner of Quad. The delay in
permanent repairs stems from the need
to order more high-voltage cable.
According to Davis, arrival of the new
cable and the completion of repairs is
expected in the next several months.
