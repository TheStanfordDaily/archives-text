## Burglary Prevention 
### 
In recent years the burglary rate on the Stanford campus has risen
considerably. The Stanford Department of Public Safety and the
Santa Clara County Sheriff's Dept. have taken considerable steps to
curb the increase. But unfortunately many campus residents have not
demonstrated sufficient understanding of the problem.
It is naive to believe that burglary can be reduced to a point where
it is no longer a major law enforcement problem. But what frustrates
law enforcement officers and us is that too many people seemingly
ignore a number of simple precautions which can significantly reduce
burglary rates.
Many of the precautions are absurdly simple, but they are all too
often overlooked. We would like to reiterate some of these basic
precautions and urge our readers to follow these suggestions.
KEEP DOORS AND WINDOWS LOCKED - An open door or
window in an unattended house is an invitation for burglary. Someone
who wasn't planning to commit a burglary might be overcome by the
temptation of an obviously unlocked or open door or window. Don't
forget to follow this rule in your car as well. If you are going to leave
your car unattended for a considerable amount of time, lock all
valuables in your trunk - a locked car door is not that difficult to
open. Remember that it only takes a few seconds to steal a wallet or
purse out of an open room — so beware of leaving rooms wide open —
even for a quick trip to the bathroom.
KEEP A RECORD OF SERIAL NUMBERS - Most items of value
have a serial number or some other identifying number and you
should keep an up-to-date record of all such items and numbers. This
is especially important with televisions, stereos, tape
recorders... Stolen property is always difficult to recover but if you
do not have accurate information about a stolen item's make and
serial number, it is almost certain you will never see it again if it is
stolen.
REPORT OBVIOUSLY SUSPICIOUS ACTIONS - If someone
you've never seen before is walking down your hall at midnight
carrying a stereo and a tape recorder, there's a good possibility that
those items might belong to one of your hallmates. Don't be overly
zealous, but when you see something which is obviously suspicious,
don't hesitate to call the police. The Stanford Department of Public
Safety's phone number is 321-3232. But don't try to be a foolhardy
hero. Many burglars are desperate and may be armed — a stolen stereo
is not worth a serious injury. When you see a suspicious action, try to
remain calm and get a good description of a suspect and his direction
of travel.
LEAVE A LIGHT ON IN AN UNATTENDED HOUSE - When
you leave a house or apartment at night, it is not a bad idea to leave
one or more lights on. Vary which lights you leave on, because many
burglars case residences more than once before committing a crime. If
you are leaving on a long trip and have a little extra cash, you might
invest it in an automatic device which turns lights on and off at a
specific time every day.
DON'T TEMPT BURGLARS - In addition to locking valuables in
the trunk of your car, you should keep stereos and other valuable
items out of areas which are totally visible from the outside of a
residence. A television or stereo sitting in front of a curtainless
window probably won't stay there very long.
There are many more tips to help you avoid burglaries, but the
above are some of the most important and surprisingly some of the
most overlooked. Beyond these suggestions, just use a little common
sense. Burglaries cannot be eliminated, but with citizen cooperation,
they can be reduced considerably.
