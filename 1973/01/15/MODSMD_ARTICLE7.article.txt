## Football Provides Escape 
### 
» daniel brenner

Every nation needs institutions
around which it can form a
consensus. At various times in
western civilization, these
unifying institutions have been
religion, sense of national
purpose, or leadership. In the
United States during the last
twenty years, big money TV quiz
programs, moon landings, and
Howard Hughes have provided a
common frame of interest. Nearly
everybody's interested; and
attention diverts itself from
almost anything else.
One of the most important
consensus institutions is
professional sports. Ten years ago,
come World Series week, there
was hardly a TV home in America
that didn't have one or two
Gillette "Look Sharp" tunes
chiming in at the quarter hour.
But baseball has lost its berth as
the most popular sport. In its
place, professional football, whose
six-month season came to an end
at yesterday's Super Bowl, now
commands the national attention
and provides an easy common turf
for cocktail party talk.
There are many Americans — a
large number of Stanford
community people, no doubt —
who dislike pro football. Unlike
college ball (the four NCAA
suspensions last week for
recruiting practices at four
southern schools notwith
standing), pro ball is played for
profit, involving major business
deals for players, networks,
concessionaires, and municipal
governments. There is the
similarity with pro boxing too,
conjuring up the image of putting
hard cash on the line to watch
knee-padded gladatorial combat.
And there Ls a sense of possible
tragedy: the loss of livelihood at
the result of injury.
Back To Marriage
But despite some of the less
pleasant associations with the
sport, it thrives in 1973. Monday
night has become canonized in TV
Guide as the pro football night. A
pocket book is out describing how
wives of TV football watchers can
attract their husbands back to the
scrimmages, huddles, and

touchdowns of marriage.
It would be presumptuous (and
futile) to criticize how people
choose to spend their idle hours.
After all, four hours in front of a
television watching some Tulane
graduates roughing it up on
Astroturf isn't the most awful
thing America can be doing with
its time.
Nevertheless, at a time when
political and social consciousness
is on the upswing — if only in
itsy-bitsy amounts — the
enthusiasm with which pro
football is pursued by so many
indicates America is in a big hurry
to escape from what she's learning
about herself.
Undoubtedly the war
encourages this escape to
escapism; but it is not singularly
responsible. When a man spends
much of his time tuning in
football, he perforce is tuning out
his wife, his society, and his
personal problems for that time.
New Consensus Issue
What's more, his football habit
is supported by "the biggest fan
of them all," the President. It was
curious to note that, during the
week of cabinet shake-ups, and
renewed bombing in North
Vietnam, it was the victory of
George Allen's Redskins for the
conference crown which brought
the President to the steps of the
White House and waiting
newsmen. Pro football has
become the President's consensus
issue: like beer, McDonald Big
Macs, and the bi-centennial, it is
something which we can all agree
on and take part in.
There is nothing wrong with
this, up to a point. For Kennedy,
it was the rocking chair and
discussions of John Maynard
Keynes. For LBJ, it was
barbeques and beagles. For Nixon,
it's pro football.
What worries me is that as pro
football enters more into the lives
of people it promotes family
disunity and long-term escapism.
The unresolved items of the
national agenda — ending the war,
providing social and economic
justice for the have-nots, restoring
faith in aging democracy — seem
less important to most Americans.

At a time when the individual
seems less and less able to affect
his political institutions, pro ball
provides a popular vehicle by
which to grin and"beer" it. It is
less an act of defiance towards
change and concern and more an
effort to close the mind and wish
it away. "The President does it;
he's a hard worker, and don't we
all need a break?" so the
theorizing goes.
So now that the living rooms
of America will no longer be the
imaginary 50-yard line, press box,
and locker room for the football
zealot, maybe American husbands
will be reunited with their
American wives. And the
American conscience will be
reunited with its unfinished
business.

discussions of John Maynard
Keynes. For LBJ, it was
barbeques and beagles. For Nixon,
it's pro football.
What worries me is that as pro
football enters more into the lives
of people it promotes family
disunity and long-term escapism.
The unresolved items of the
national agenda — ending the war,
providing social and economic
justice for the have-nots, restoring
faith in aging democracy — seem
less important to most Americans.

At a time when the individual
seems less and less able to affect
his political institutions, pro ball
provides a popular vehicle by
which to grin and"beer" it. It is
less an act of defiance towards
change and concern and more an
effort to close the mind and wish
it away. "The President does it;
he's a hard worker, and don't we
all need a break?" so the
theorizing goes.
So now that the living rooms
of America will no longer be the
imaginary 50-yard line, press box,
and locker room for the football
zealot, maybe American husbands
will be reunited with their
American wives. And the
American conscience will be
reunited with its unfinished
business.

Every nation needs institutions
around which it can form a
consensus. At various times in
western civilization, these
unifying institutions have been
religion, sense of national
purpose, or leadership. In the
United States during the last
twenty years, big money TV quiz
programs, moon landings, and
Howard Hughes have provided a
common frame of interest. Nearly
everybody's interested; and
attention diverts itself from
almost anything else.
One of the most important
consensus institutions is
professional sports. Ten years ago,
come World Series week, there
was hardly a TV home in America
that didn't have one or two
Gillette "Look Sharp" tunes
chiming in at the quarter hour.
But baseball has lost its berth as
the most popular sport. In its
place, professional football, whose
six-month season came to an end
at yesterday's Super Bowl, now
commands the national attention
and provides an easy common turf
for cocktail party talk.
There are many Americans — a
large number of Stanford
community people, no doubt —
who dislike pro football. Unlike
college ball (the four NCAA
suspensions last week for
recruiting practices at four
southern schools notwith
standing), pro ball is played for
profit, involving major business
deals for players, networks,
concessionaires, and municipal
governments. There is the
similarity with pro boxing too,
conjuring up the image of putting
hard cash on the line to watch
knee-padded gladatorial combat.
And there Ls a sense of possible
tragedy: the loss of livelihood at
the result of injury.
Back To Marriage
But despite some of the less
pleasant associations with the
sport, it thrives in 1973. Monday
night has become canonized in TV
Guide as the pro football night. A
pocket book is out describing how
wives of TV football watchers can
attract their husbands back to the
scrimmages, huddles, and

touchdowns of marriage.
It would be presumptuous (and
futile) to criticize how people
choose to spend their idle hours.
After all, four hours in front of a
television watching some Tulane
graduates roughing it up on
Astroturf isn't the most awful
thing America can be doing with
its time.
Nevertheless, at a time when
political and social consciousness
is on the upswing — if only in
itsy-bitsy amounts — the
enthusiasm with which pro
football is pursued by so many
indicates America is in a big hurry
to escape from what she's learning
about herself.
Undoubtedly the war
encourages this escape to
escapism; but it is not singularly
responsible. When a man spends
much of his time tuning in
football, he perforce is tuning out
his wife, his society, and his
personal problems for that time.
New Consensus Issue
What's more, his football habit
is supported by "the biggest fan
of them all," the President. It was
curious to note that, during the
week of cabinet shake-ups, and
renewed bombing in North
Vietnam, it was the victory of
George Allen's Redskins for the
conference crown which brought
the President to the steps of the
White House and waiting
newsmen. Pro football has
become the President's consensus
issue: like beer, McDonald Big
Macs, and the bi-centennial, it is
something which we can all agree
on and take part in.
There is nothing wrong with
this, up to a point. For Kennedy,
it was the rocking chair and

thing America can be doing with
its time.
Nevertheless, at a time when
political and social consciousness
is on the upswing — if only in
itsy-bitsy amounts — the
enthusiasm with which pro
football is pursued by so many
indicates America is in a big hurry
to escape from what she's learning
about herself.
Undoubtedly the war
encourages this escape to
escapism; but it is not singularly
responsible. When a man spends
much of his time tuning in
football, he perforce is tuning out
his wife, his society, and his
personal problems for that time.
New Consensus Issue
What's more, his football habit
is supported by "the biggest fan
of them all," the President. It was
curious to note that, during the
week of cabinet shake-ups, and
renewed bombing in North
Vietnam, it was the victory of
George Allen's Redskins for the
conference crown which brought
the President to the steps of the
White House and waiting
newsmen. Pro football has
become the President's consensus
issue: like beer, McDonald Big
Macs, and the bi-centennial, it is
something which we can all agree
on and take part in.
There is nothing wrong with
this, up to a point. For Kennedy,
it was the rocking chair and
discussions of John Maynard
Keynes. For LBJ, it was
barbeques and beagles. For Nixon,
it's pro football.
What worries me is that as pro
football enters more into the lives
of people it promotes family
disunity and long-term escapism.
The unresolved items of the
national agenda — ending the war,
providing social and economic
justice for the have-nots, restoring
faith in aging democracy — seem
less important to most Americans.

At a time when the individual
seems less and less able to affect
his political institutions, pro ball
provides a popular vehicle by
which to grin and"beer" it. It is
less an act of defiance towards
change and concern and more an
effort to close the mind and wish
it away. "The President does it;
he's a hard worker, and don't we
all need a break?" so the
theorizing goes.
So now that the living rooms
of America will no longer be the
imaginary 50-yard line, press box,
and locker room for the football
zealot, maybe American husbands
will be reunited with their
American wives. And the
American conscience will be
reunited with its unfinished
business.
