Inmates Seek Communication
Dear Sir:
I am an inmate of the United
States penitentiary, Atlanta,
Georgia.
I am but one of many inmates
involved in a project in this
institution entitled, "Inside Out."
The objective behind this project
is to establish meaningful
communication between
incarcerated individuals and those
individuals in society interested in
prisoners, prisons and prison
reform. Our intent is only to
exchange meaningful information
and not to solicit funds in any
way. We are non-political and we
do not represent any organization
other than the inmates of this
institution.
Being that this is our initial
effort to communicate with
society, we are directing our
attention towards the students of
several major universities. We feel
that students are inclined to be
more interested in the complex
problems of crime, criminals and
related sociological areas. There is,
of course, a great store of criminal
case history here, with individual

levels of education ranging from
the illiterate to college graduate.
The possibilities of beneficial
learning experiences are endless,
both for the student and prison
inmate.
If you feel that your students
would be interested, or could gain
meaningful learning experience
from a project such as this, then
we hope that you will circulate
this letter and information to the
appropriate departments of your
university, or perhaps even
forward it to the editor of your
institution's paper for publication.
Interested individuals may reply
directly to either of the two
addresses below.
Our design is for a better
tomorrow; will you help us?
