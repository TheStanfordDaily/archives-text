# President Halts Bombing, Mining; Vietnam Cease-Fire Treaty Seen
## 
### 
From the Associated Press
President Nixon suspended all
bombing, shelling, and mining of
North Vietnam yesterday amid reports
indicating that a cease-fire agreement
will be signed soon.
The Florida White House was
reluctant to show any overt signs of
optimism, stressing that ''negotiations
are in progress" and that Presidential
Adviser Henry Kissinger would return
to Paris to meet with North Vietnam's
Le Due Tho "in the relatively near
future."
White House Press Secretary
Ronald Ziegler announced the
President's decision, citing the progress
of Kissinger's peace negotiations as the
reason for the halt to all offensive
actions against North Vietnam.
The Presidential directive took
effect at 7 a.m. yesterday morning,
Pacific Standard Time, following
extensive conversations between
Nixon and Kissinger Sunday and
yesterday.
The suspension means that all
bombing north of the Demilitarized
Zone has been halted, including the
elimination of "protective reaction"
strikes. All naval shelling of the North
has also ceased.
Mines To Stay
However, those mines already
dotting Haiphong Harbor and other

North Vietnamese ports will remain
active indefinitely, according to
Ziegler.
The announcement came as Gen.
Alexander M. Haig, Jr., the President's
Special Emissary to Saigon flew to
Indochina to confer with the leaders
of Laos, Cambodia, and Thailand, as
well as South Vietnamese President
Nguyen Van Thieu. Haig is believed to
be carrying a draft of the cease-fire
agreement reached between Kissinger
and Tho in Paris last week.
Thieu met with top government
officials for eight hours yesterday to
review his government's position prior
to his meeting with Haig.
Haig arrived in Saigon today, and
met with Thieu as scheduled. CBS
correspondent Don Webster reported
that although the South Vietnamese
President may demand several minor
changes, the U.S. is determined to sign
the agreement with or without Thieu's
consent.
Tet New Year Date
A newspaper with close ties to
Saigon's Independence Palace, Tin
Song, quoted an unnamed government
source as saying that the signing of the
cease-fire agreement could come
before the Tet new year on Feb. 3.
CBS State Department
Correspondent Marvin Kalb reported
yesterday that there apparently were

two reasons for the halt; to signal good
will toward the Hanoi government and
to indicate to Saigon that the U.S.
believed that the time for signing had
come.
CBS said that Kissinger and Saigon
may have won two negotiating
victories not clarified in the October
agreement. First, Hanoi will tacitly
admit the legitimacy of the Saigon
government, although insisting
formally that there is only one
Vietnamese people and that the
division of Vietnam is only temporary.
2000 Soldiers
Secondly, North Vietnam is
believed to have agreed to a large
supervisory cease-fire force, as
requested by the United States. This
force is to eventually include over
2000 soldiers from Canada, Hungary,
Indonesia, and Poland.
In a dispatch from Geneva, the
Manchester Guardian reported that
North Vietnamese sources in Paris
have said that Hanoi has agreed to
release prisoners in both North and
South Vietnam in return for the
release of North Vietnamese prisoners.
This represents a change from its
previous position which made no
mention of prisoners held in South
Vietnam.
NBC Radio said yesterday that the
President must be sure of a peace

agreement in order to take so dramatic
a step as the total cessation of
hostilities against North Vietnam.
Previous bombing halts since May 8,
1972, when the decision to mine the
harbors was announced, have not
included all of North Vietnam. This is
also the first time since then that the
U.S. has stopped the mining of
harbors.
The NBC analysis said that high
government sources said that North
Vietnam has agreed not only to return
all prisoners but also to eventually
withdraw all troops from North
Vietnam.
In return, Thieu is reported to be
set to agree to allow North Vietnamese
troops to remain in his country for an
unspecified period of time after the
signing of the cease-fire agreement.
During this period of time,

CHINA OBSERVER — Political Science Prof. John Lewis returned from the
People's Republic of China after a month long visit and commented on various
aspects of Chinese life. Lewis remarked that he saw a 'vigorous' China, one full
of a variety of human experience.
Hanoi-Saigon negotiations are to
continue.
Other terms of the October
cease-fire accord will remain
unchanged, including the withdrawal
of all American troops and the
simultaneous release of U.S.
prisoners-of-war within 60 days after
the signing.
The order to suspend military
action against North Vietnam was
described by Ziegler as a "unilateral
action," requiring no corresponding
reduction in North Vietnamese action
in the South.
Although all "offensive" actions
against the North have ceased,
reconnaissance flights have continued,
as have bombing raids on suspected
Viet Cong strongholds near Saigon.
In Paris yesterday, negotiations on
technical details of a Vietnamese peace
agreement continued for seven and
one-half hours yesterday at a
Communist-owned villa in suburban
Gif Sur Yvette.

Today, discussions are taking place
in an American-owned villa.
Hanoi Radio told the North
Vietnamese today that the U.S. had
halted its bombing raids. But it
warned: "This has been done before,
and afterwards the U.S. imperialists
have resumed even more fierce and
barbarous bombing and shelling."
Brandt Appeal
In Bonn, West German Chancellor
Willy Brandt appealed for a swift end
to the war in Vietnam and welcomed
the bombing halt.
In Washington, Senate Democratic
leader Mike Mansfield told newsmen
"my hopes have been raised that peace
is at hand."
In the House, Speaker Carl Albert
said that the effect of the bombing
halt would depend on "what happens
after the bombing stops."
House Republican leader Gerald
Ford said that the suspension "is an
indication of solid progress toward a
cease-fire and a formula of peace in
Vietnam."
