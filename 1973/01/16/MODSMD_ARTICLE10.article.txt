## Truman's Attempts To Thwart Communism 
###

(Editor's Note: This is the
second of two parts. The first
part, which appeared yesterday,
dealt with the early years of the
Truman Administration, and
evaluations of his Administration
as a whole.)
When Harry S Truman
ascended to the presidency,
Soviet-American relations were
already strained—by the delayed
second front, disputes over the
Baltic states and Poland, and
mutual suspicions. Within fifteen
months, the Grand Alliance was
smashed and the Cold War was a
painful reality. Truman's reversal
of Roosevelt's acceptance of a
Soviet sphere in Eastern Europe,
the new president's efforts to roll
back ("liberate") the Soviets from
this area, his denial of a large loan
to Russia, the practice of "atomic

diplomacy," his maintenance of
the. nuclear monopoly, and the
reversal of our policy in
Germany—all helped to produce
the Cold War.
In this judgment, the Cold War
could have been avoided if the
administration had followed other
practices, for Stalin's policies were
basically conservative and devoted
to establishing a Soviet security
zone in Eastern Europe and to
reconstructing the war-ravaged
economy. Nor did American
public opinion demand the
policies that the administration
adopted toward Russia. In fact,
Truman's government often had
to "enlighten" the electorate on
Soviet malevolence and the need
for militant American policies.
Seeking to establish a world of
peace and prosperity defined in
American terms, Truman's
administration aimed to impose
its own design on the postwar
world. Would Roosevelt have
acted differently? Perhaps not.
The evidence is unclear. We can
only speculate—but we must
remember that the atomic bomb
and economic power were the
potential weapons or bargaining
counters that Roosevelt had
purposely kept in reserve and
thereby bestowed these options
on Truman.
Marshall Plan
The administration, losing
hope of immediate liberation in
Eastern Europe, formally launched
its containment doctrine in 1947:
the Truman Doctrine and the
Marshall Plan. Exploiting the
British withdrawal from Greece,
Truman seized the opportunity to
declare a global crusade: "It must
be the policy of the United States
to support free peoples who are
resisting subjugation by armed
minorities or by outside
pressures." The situation in
Greece was actually more
complex than the administration

understood. It was a
broadly-based revolution and not
Soviet-directed.
The economic arm of
containment was the Marshall
Plan: an effort to reconstruct the
faltering European economy, end
the conditions that would breed
communism, and integrate Europe
into an American-dominated
capitalist order.
Despite denials at the time, the
plan was conceived to be
unacceptable to the Soviet Union.
The plan considered the Soviet
Union a prospective donor nation,
required access to secret Soviet
economic data, expected
participating nations to move
toward economic multilateralism,
and also aimed to pry the Eastern
European nations out of the
Soviet orbit and back into the
western system. Rather than
simply an act of American
humanitarian benevolence, the
Marshall Plan was also part of the
strategy for reconstructing the
world on America's terms—the
advancement of democratic
capitalism. The program did assist
Western Europe, thwart
communism in that area, and also
contribute to the East-West
division of Europe.
Korean War
During the administration's
later years probably its most
questionable major decisions in
foreign policy involved the
Korean War—intervention,
escalation, and stalemate. Acting
without adequate evidence,
Truman wrongly interpreted
North Korea's attack as part of a
Soviet plot to extend communism
in Asia and to test the
administration's will in Europe.
To Truman, the conflict was not
primarily a civil war between two
sections of a divided nation but
part of the plan of monolithic
communism for world
domination.

Having badly misjudged the
situation, the President and his
advisers also moved promptly to
remilitarize Europe and to request
huge military budgets from
Congress. In Korea the
administration's policies were
unsuccessful. It sought to conquer
North Korea and unify the nation,
ignored warnings from
Communist China, and thereby
unwisely extended the conflict
and squandered American lives
and resources. Rejecting both
withdrawal and victory
(Mac Arthur's strategy), Truman
continued the costly stalemate
during his last eighteen months in
the White House. To the President
and his associates the political
price was also high: they lost the
confidence of many Americans
and became the targets of bitter
charges.
To Dean Acheson, scion of the
Eastern establishment of Harvard,
Yale, and Covington and Burling,
Truman was "The captain with
the mighty heart." To so many in
the policy-making establishment,
the President had acted repeatedly
with courage and vision to create
the world they sought: an
American century. Theirs was not
a new aim and others who did not
serve might also have been
[willing] architects of the Cold
War. Truman was not the
indispensable man. He may have
given the Cold War his own
distinctive flavor but
Soviet-American relations would
probably not have been greatly
different if another man had
occupied the White House. In the
years 1945-53, few men with or
near power were prepared to
follow significantly different
policies or desired a different
world order. A judgment of
Truman, then, ultimately may
depend upon a judgment of
America—its ideology and its
structure of power

Even in his pofit-presidential
years, Truman had commanded
attention because he was our
president. Yet, at this time when
we reflect upon his life, we should
not concentrate exclusively upon
his policies and thereby ignore
other aspects of the man. He was
feisty and enjoyed the combat of
politics. With his associates, he
was fiercely loyal and able to
inspire affection and respect even
in men of greater education and
sophistication. As a father and
husband, he was a model drawn
from an earlier age: He was loving,
protective, solicitous,
understanding. As a private man,
he was unpretentious, even
earthy. Those who loved him may
want to remember Truman not as
an architect of the Cold War but
as a man of quick personal
judgment, firm conviction, and
salty language.
Consider, for example, an
event almost a decade ago, when
he was walking along the corridor
near his office with a crony.
Pointing to his rear-end, Truman
complained about a pain there.
Was it his hip?, the associate
deftly asked. No, said Truman.
Maybe the back?, asked the
crony. No, said Truman again.
The upper thigh? No, said Truman
impatiently, "It' s a pain in my
ass." In that blunt comment, he
also revealed qualities of mind and
temperament that partly explain
why Truman, after meeting J.
Robert Oppenheimer, who had
expressed his personal agony
about Hiroshima, ordered that he
never wanted to see "that damned
fool" again.

world on America's terms—the
advancement of democratic
capitalism. The program did assist
Western Europe, thwart
communism in that area, and also
contribute to the East-West
division of Europe.
Korean War
During the administration's
later years probably its most
questionable major decisions in
foreign policy involved the
Korean War—intervention,
escalation, and stalemate. Acting
without adequate evidence,
Truman wrongly interpreted
North Korea's attack as part of a
Soviet plot to extend communism
in Asia and to test the
administration's will in Europe.
To Truman, the conflict was not
primarily a civil war between two
sections of a divided nation but
part of the plan of monolithic
communism for world
domination.

Having badly misjudged the
situation, the President and his
advisers also moved promptly to
remilitarize Europe and to request
huge military budgets from
Congress. In Korea the
administration's policies were
unsuccessful. It sought to conquer
North Korea and unify the nation,
ignored warnings from
Communist China, and thereby
unwisely extended the conflict
and squandered American lives
and resources. Rejecting both
withdrawal and victory
(Mac Arthur's strategy), Truman
continued the costly stalemate
during his last eighteen months in
the White House. To the President
and his associates the political
price was also high: they lost the
confidence of many Americans
and became the targets of bitter
charges.
To Dean Acheson, scion of the
Eastern establishment of Harvard,
Yale, and Covington and Burling,
Truman was "The captain with
the mighty heart." To so many in
the policy-making establishment,
the President had acted repeatedly
with courage and vision to create
the world they sought: an
American century. Theirs was not
a new aim and others who did not
serve might also have been
[willing] architects of the Cold
War. Truman was not the
indispensable man. He may have
given the Cold War his own
distinctive flavor but
Soviet-American relations would
probably not have been greatly
different if another man had
occupied the White House. In the
years 1945-53, few men with or
near power were prepared to
follow significantly different
policies or desired a different
world order. A judgment of
Truman, then, ultimately may
depend upon a judgment of
America—its ideology and its
structure of power

Even in his pofit-presidential
years, Truman had commanded
attention because he was our
president. Yet, at this time when
we reflect upon his life, we should
not concentrate exclusively upon
his policies and thereby ignore
other aspects of the man. He was
feisty and enjoyed the combat of
politics. With his associates, he
was fiercely loyal and able to
inspire affection and respect even
in men of greater education and
sophistication. As a father and
husband, he was a model drawn
from an earlier age: He was loving,
protective, solicitous,
understanding. As a private man,
he was unpretentious, even
earthy. Those who loved him may
want to remember Truman not as
an architect of the Cold War but
as a man of quick personal
judgment, firm conviction, and
salty language.
Consider, for example, an
event almost a decade ago, when
he was walking along the corridor
near his office with a crony.
Pointing to his rear-end, Truman
complained about a pain there.
Was it his hip?, the associate
deftly asked. No, said Truman.
Maybe the back?, asked the
crony. No, said Truman again.
The upper thigh? No, said Truman
impatiently, "It' s a pain in my
ass." In that blunt comment, he
also revealed qualities of mind and
temperament that partly explain
why Truman, after meeting J.
Robert Oppenheimer, who had
expressed his personal agony
about Hiroshima, ordered that he
never wanted to see "that damned
fool" again.

second of two parts. The first
part, which appeared yesterday,
dealt with the early years of the
Truman Administration, and
evaluations of his Administration
as a whole.)
When Harry S Truman
ascended to the presidency,
Soviet-American relations were
already strained—by the delayed
second front, disputes over the
Baltic states and Poland, and
mutual suspicions. Within fifteen
months, the Grand Alliance was
smashed and the Cold War was a
painful reality. Truman's reversal
of Roosevelt's acceptance of a
Soviet sphere in Eastern Europe,
the new president's efforts to roll
back ("liberate") the Soviets from
this area, his denial of a large loan
to Russia, the practice of "atomic

diplomacy," his maintenance of
the. nuclear monopoly, and the
reversal of our policy in
Germany—all helped to produce
the Cold War.
In this judgment, the Cold War
could have been avoided if the
administration had followed other
practices, for Stalin's policies were
basically conservative and devoted
to establishing a Soviet security
zone in Eastern Europe and to
reconstructing the war-ravaged
economy. Nor did American
public opinion demand the
policies that the administration
adopted toward Russia. In fact,
Truman's government often had
to "enlighten" the electorate on
Soviet malevolence and the need
for militant American policies.
Seeking to establish a world of
peace and prosperity defined in
American terms, Truman's
administration aimed to impose
its own design on the postwar
world. Would Roosevelt have
acted differently? Perhaps not.
The evidence is unclear. We can
only speculate—but we must
remember that the atomic bomb
and economic power were the
potential weapons or bargaining
counters that Roosevelt had
purposely kept in reserve and
thereby bestowed these options
on Truman.
Marshall Plan
The administration, losing
hope of immediate liberation in
Eastern Europe, formally launched
its containment doctrine in 1947:
the Truman Doctrine and the
Marshall Plan. Exploiting the
British withdrawal from Greece,
Truman seized the opportunity to
declare a global crusade: "It must
be the policy of the United States
to support free peoples who are
resisting subjugation by armed
minorities or by outside
pressures." The situation in
Greece was actually more
complex than the administration

understood. It was a
broadly-based revolution and not
Soviet-directed.
The economic arm of
containment was the Marshall
Plan: an effort to reconstruct the
faltering European economy, end
the conditions that would breed
communism, and integrate Europe
into an American-dominated
capitalist order.
Despite denials at the time, the
plan was conceived to be
unacceptable to the Soviet Union.
The plan considered the Soviet
Union a prospective donor nation,
required access to secret Soviet
economic data, expected
participating nations to move
toward economic multilateralism,
and also aimed to pry the Eastern
European nations out of the
Soviet orbit and back into the
western system. Rather than
simply an act of American
humanitarian benevolence, the
Marshall Plan was also part of the
strategy for reconstructing the
world on America's terms—the
advancement of democratic
capitalism. The program did assist
Western Europe, thwart
communism in that area, and also
contribute to the East-West
division of Europe.

salty language.
Consider, for example, an
event almost a decade ago, when
he was walking along the corridor
near his office with a crony.
Pointing to his rear-end, Truman
complained about a pain there.
Was it his hip?, the associate
deftly asked. No, said Truman.
Maybe the back?, asked the
crony. No, said Truman again.
The upper thigh? No, said Truman
impatiently, "It' s a pain in my
ass." In that blunt comment, he
also revealed qualities of mind and
temperament that partly explain
why Truman, after meeting J.
Robert Oppenheimer, who had
expressed his personal agony
about Hiroshima, ordered that he
never wanted to see "that damned
fool" again.

(Editor's Note: This is the
second of two parts. The first
part, which appeared yesterday,
dealt with the early years of the
Truman Administration, and
evaluations of his Administration
as a whole.)
When Harry S Truman
ascended to the presidency,
Soviet-American relations were
already strained—by the delayed
second front, disputes over the
Baltic states and Poland, and
mutual suspicions. Within fifteen
months, the Grand Alliance was
smashed and the Cold War was a
painful reality. Truman's reversal
of Roosevelt's acceptance of a
Soviet sphere in Eastern Europe,
the new president's efforts to roll
back ("liberate") the Soviets from
this area, his denial of a large loan
to Russia, the practice of "atomic

diplomacy," his maintenance of
the. nuclear monopoly, and the
reversal of our policy in
Germany—all helped to produce
the Cold War.
In this judgment, the Cold War
could have been avoided if the
administration had followed other
practices, for Stalin's policies were
basically conservative and devoted
to establishing a Soviet security
zone in Eastern Europe and to
reconstructing the war-ravaged
economy. Nor did American
public opinion demand the
policies that the administration
adopted toward Russia. In fact,
Truman's government often had
to "enlighten" the electorate on
Soviet malevolence and the need
for militant American policies.
Seeking to establish a world of
peace and prosperity defined in
American terms, Truman's
administration aimed to impose
its own design on the postwar
world. Would Roosevelt have
acted differently? Perhaps not.
The evidence is unclear. We can
only speculate—but we must
remember that the atomic bomb
and economic power were the
potential weapons or bargaining
counters that Roosevelt had
purposely kept in reserve and
thereby bestowed these options
on Truman.
Marshall Plan
The administration, losing
hope of immediate liberation in
Eastern Europe, formally launched
its containment doctrine in 1947:
the Truman Doctrine and the
Marshall Plan. Exploiting the
British withdrawal from Greece,
Truman seized the opportunity to
declare a global crusade: "It must
be the policy of the United States
to support free peoples who are
resisting subjugation by armed
minorities or by outside
pressures." The situation in
Greece was actually more
complex than the administration

understood. It was a
broadly-based revolution and not
Soviet-directed.
The economic arm of
containment was the Marshall
Plan: an effort to reconstruct the
faltering European economy, end
the conditions that would breed
communism, and integrate Europe
into an American-dominated
capitalist order.
Despite denials at the time, the
plan was conceived to be
unacceptable to the Soviet Union.
The plan considered the Soviet
Union a prospective donor nation,
required access to secret Soviet
economic data, expected
participating nations to move
toward economic multilateralism,
and also aimed to pry the Eastern
European nations out of the
Soviet orbit and back into the
western system. Rather than
simply an act of American
humanitarian benevolence, the
Marshall Plan was also part of the
strategy for reconstructing the
world on America's terms—the
advancement of democratic
capitalism. The program did assist
Western Europe, thwart
communism in that area, and also
contribute to the East-West
division of Europe.
Korean War
During the administration's
later years probably its most
questionable major decisions in
foreign policy involved the
Korean War—intervention,
escalation, and stalemate. Acting
without adequate evidence,
Truman wrongly interpreted
North Korea's attack as part of a
Soviet plot to extend communism
in Asia and to test the
administration's will in Europe.
To Truman, the conflict was not
primarily a civil war between two
sections of a divided nation but
part of the plan of monolithic
communism for world
domination.

Having badly misjudged the
situation, the President and his
advisers also moved promptly to
remilitarize Europe and to request
huge military budgets from
Congress. In Korea the
administration's policies were
unsuccessful. It sought to conquer
North Korea and unify the nation,
ignored warnings from
Communist China, and thereby
unwisely extended the conflict
and squandered American lives
and resources. Rejecting both
withdrawal and victory
(Mac Arthur's strategy), Truman
continued the costly stalemate
during his last eighteen months in
the White House. To the President
and his associates the political
price was also high: they lost the
confidence of many Americans
and became the targets of bitter
charges.
To Dean Acheson, scion of the
Eastern establishment of Harvard,
Yale, and Covington and Burling,
Truman was "The captain with
the mighty heart." To so many in
the policy-making establishment,
the President had acted repeatedly
with courage and vision to create
the world they sought: an
American century. Theirs was not
a new aim and others who did not
serve might also have been
[willing] architects of the Cold
War. Truman was not the
indispensable man. He may have
given the Cold War his own
distinctive flavor but
Soviet-American relations would
probably not have been greatly
different if another man had
occupied the White House. In the
years 1945-53, few men with or
near power were prepared to
follow significantly different
policies or desired a different
world order. A judgment of
Truman, then, ultimately may
depend upon a judgment of
America—its ideology and its
structure of power

Even in his pofit-presidential
years, Truman had commanded
attention because he was our
president. Yet, at this time when
we reflect upon his life, we should
not concentrate exclusively upon
his policies and thereby ignore
other aspects of the man. He was
feisty and enjoyed the combat of
politics. With his associates, he
was fiercely loyal and able to
inspire affection and respect even
in men of greater education and
sophistication. As a father and
husband, he was a model drawn
from an earlier age: He was loving,
protective, solicitous,
understanding. As a private man,
he was unpretentious, even
earthy. Those who loved him may
want to remember Truman not as
an architect of the Cold War but
as a man of quick personal
judgment, firm conviction, and
salty language.
Consider, for example, an

minorities or by outside
pressures." The situation in
Greece was actually more
complex than the administration

understood. It was a
broadly-based revolution and not
Soviet-directed.
The economic arm of
containment was the Marshall
Plan: an effort to reconstruct the
faltering European economy, end
the conditions that would breed
communism, and integrate Europe
into an American-dominated
capitalist order.
Despite denials at the time, the
plan was conceived to be
unacceptable to the Soviet Union.
The plan considered the Soviet
Union a prospective donor nation,
required access to secret Soviet
economic data, expected
participating nations to move
toward economic multilateralism,
and also aimed to pry the Eastern
European nations out of the
Soviet orbit and back into the
western system. Rather than
simply an act of American
humanitarian benevolence, the
Marshall Plan was also part of the
strategy for reconstructing the
world on America's terms—the
advancement of democratic
capitalism. The program did assist
Western Europe, thwart
communism in that area, and also
contribute to the East-West
division of Europe.
Korean War
During the administration's
later years probably its most
questionable major decisions in
foreign policy involved the
Korean War—intervention,
escalation, and stalemate. Acting
without adequate evidence,
Truman wrongly interpreted
North Korea's attack as part of a
Soviet plot to extend communism
in Asia and to test the
administration's will in Europe.
To Truman, the conflict was not
primarily a civil war between two
sections of a divided nation but
part of the plan of monolithic
communism for world
domination.

Having badly misjudged the
situation, the President and his
advisers also moved promptly to
remilitarize Europe and to request
huge military budgets from
Congress. In Korea the
administration's policies were
unsuccessful. It sought to conquer
North Korea and unify the nation,
ignored warnings from
Communist China, and thereby
unwisely extended the conflict
and squandered American lives
and resources. Rejecting both
withdrawal and victory
(Mac Arthur's strategy), Truman
continued the costly stalemate
during his last eighteen months in
the White House. To the President
and his associates the political
price was also high: they lost the
confidence of many Americans
and became the targets of bitter
charges.
To Dean Acheson, scion of the
Eastern establishment of Harvard,
Yale, and Covington and Burling,
Truman was "The captain with
the mighty heart." To so many in
the policy-making establishment,
the President had acted repeatedly
with courage and vision to create
the world they sought: an
American century. Theirs was not
a new aim and others who did not
serve might also have been
[willing] architects of the Cold
War. Truman was not the
indispensable man. He may have
given the Cold War his own
distinctive flavor but
Soviet-American relations would
probably not have been greatly
different if another man had
occupied the White House. In the
years 1945-53, few men with or
near power were prepared to
follow significantly different
policies or desired a different
world order. A judgment of
Truman, then, ultimately may
depend upon a judgment of
America—its ideology and its
structure of power

Even in his pofit-presidential
years, Truman had commanded
attention because he was our
president. Yet, at this time when
we reflect upon his life, we should
not concentrate exclusively upon
his policies and thereby ignore
other aspects of the man. He was
feisty and enjoyed the combat of
politics. With his associates, he
was fiercely loyal and able to
inspire affection and respect even
in men of greater education and
sophistication. As a father and
husband, he was a model drawn
from an earlier age: He was loving,
protective, solicitous,
understanding. As a private man,
he was unpretentious, even
earthy. Those who loved him may
want to remember Truman not as
an architect of the Cold War but
as a man of quick personal
judgment, firm conviction, and
salty language.
Consider, for example, an
event almost a decade ago, when
he was walking along the corridor
near his office with a crony.
Pointing to his rear-end, Truman
complained about a pain there.
Was it his hip?, the associate
deftly asked. No, said Truman.
Maybe the back?, asked the
crony. No, said Truman again.
The upper thigh? No, said Truman
impatiently, "It' s a pain in my
ass." In that blunt comment, he
also revealed qualities of mind and
temperament that partly explain
why Truman, after meeting J.
Robert Oppenheimer, who had
expressed his personal agony
about Hiroshima, ordered that he
never wanted to see "that damned
fool" again.
