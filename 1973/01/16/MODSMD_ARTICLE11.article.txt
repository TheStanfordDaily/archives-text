## 'Anti-War Projects Need Help' 
### 
bob bone

During the past few weeks
several individual groups on
campus have begun to direct their
efforts toward, in part, three
common goals: 1. collection of
money for medical funds to North
Vietnam specifically for
restoration of the Bach Mai
Hospital; 2. implementation of
the nine-point peace plan
forwarded in October and
November of last year and
subsequently thwarted by the
efforts of Nixon and Thieu; and,
3. organizing for and participating
in the important demonstration in
San Francisco scheduled for
Inauguration Day, Jan. 20.
At this time, before
Inauguration Day, it is important
that the efforts of these groups be
made known to the Stanford
community. All of these groups
wish to discuss their individual
projects with you, and many need
your help to see their projects
realized. Consequently, contacts
with each group follow a
description of the group's
activities:
S.C . O.P.E. ( Stanford
Committee on Political
Education) is becoming involved
with the collection of medical aid
for North Vietnam. They will be
organizing on-carnpus resistance
of the 10% telephone tax, the
federal tax earmarked for the
Vietnam War, and will be calling

on telephone tax resisters to
contribute the tax money toward
medical aid for North Vietnam,
especially toward reconstruction
of the Bach Mai Hospital. SCOPE
also encourages living groups to
raise money together to
contribute. SCOPE especially
needs people to help leaflet and
speak with living groups about
war tax resistance and related
matters. If you wish to help or
have any questions contact Joan
Hoarwieh, John Marx, or Dave
Watkiss at Columbae House,
328-9555.
C.C.A.S. (Committee of
Concerned Asian Scholars) will be
holding a series of dorm meetings
and small discussions with
interested folks who would like to
learn more about the nine points,
the effects of the recent
bombings, and the importance of
the Jan. 20 demonstration. If you
would like CCAS people to speak
with your living group or would
like more information about
CCAS activities, phone 321-2300
ext. 3606 (CCAS office).
WOMENS UNION—The
Womens Union endorses the
efforts to collect money for the
Bach Mai Hospital both at
Stanford and from the Palo Alto
City Council. They also demand,
along with most of the other
groups, that Stanford University
donate $50,000 to the Bach Mai

Hospital fund. The Womens
Union is also organizing a carpool
mainly for women who would like
to participate in the San Francisco
demonstration together (however,
men are also welcome). Cars will
leave Tresidder at 9:00 Saturday
morning. For more about the
Womens Union, contact the
Womens Union through the
Women's Center, 328-4856.
VENCEREMOS-Stanford
Venceremos members support the
demand that Stanford University
contribute $50,000 toward the
Bach Mai Hospital. Furthermore,
efforts are being directed toward
the Jan. 20 demonstration in the
City. For more information see
the Venceremos table in White
F.P.A.G. (Faculty Political
Action Group)—FPAG is
beginning to come together this
quarter. They support the three
goals outlined at the beginning of
this article, and continue to be
concerned about the definition of
the University, the University's
complicity with the war especially
through recruiting and defense
department contracting, and the
corrupt Stanford judicial process.
Interested in any of these areas?
Contact Prof. Raymond Giraud at

Some of these groups,
especially the Women's Union,

will be directing energy toward
responding to Marine recruiting
on our campus next week. Those
interested in helping organize a
response to that should contact
any of the above groups.

I would also be willing to talk
to folks about any of these
projects. Phone me, Bob Bone, at
493-4183.

anthropology.)
