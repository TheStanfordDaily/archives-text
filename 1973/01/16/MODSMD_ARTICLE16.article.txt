# Psychiatric Clinics Director Selected
## 
### 
Dr. Floyd Estess has been
appointed director of the adult
and child psychiatric dinicsat the
Stanford University School of
Medicine. He will also be a senior
attending physician and clinical
professor of psychiatry.
Dr. Estess, former director of
psychiatric services at Dominican
Santa Cruz Hospital in Santa
Cruz, was named by Dr. Bert S.
Kopell, acting chairman of the
Department of Psychiatry.
The 51-year-old psychiatrist
and psychoanalyst plans a major
reorganization to increase the
clinic's involvement with the
community by offering, among
other things, help for people
suffering from depression. He also
hopes to expand consultation
services to public agencies which
might find the department's
expertise helpful.
Dr. Estess feels there is a need
for a clinic on depression because
"I think depression is a
widespread problem and people

ought to know it is a common
thing and that there are
professionals trained to help
them."
Presently the Stanford
psychiatric clinics offer the full
range of psychiatric services,
including such highly specialized
areas as sleep disorders. But Dr.
Estess also plans to develop a
night clinic so that psychiatric
services are more accessible and
convenient to area patients. Also
contemplated is the development
of a new clinic specializing in
sexual and marital problems.
Dr. Estess has appointed two
other Stanford professors to clinic
associated directorships and to
head specialized units. They are
Dr. Warren B. Miller who will
direct the consultation program,
and Dr. Irvin D. Yolom, who will
direct the Group Therapy unit. A
third appointee, Dr. Alan J.
Rosenthal, will head the child
psychiatry unit.
