### BOB LITTERMAN 
To the dismay of thousands, "plus' 1 and
"minus" grades—which I thought had
disappeared forever— suddenly showed up
again on Fall Quarter grade reports. How
come? Who makes these mysterious
decisions? Why don't they ever tell
anybody? And is there any way of going
back to plain A's, B's, and C's? D.D.M.
The decision to reinstitute plus and
minus grading was made last spring by the
faculty senate in accord with a
recommendation from the Academic
Council's Committee on Academic
Appraisal and Achievement (CAAA).
This committee is headed by Prof. Phil
Dawson, who explained that the rationale
behind the decision was that by breaking
the three grade categories into essentially
nine categories it takes pressure off those
people who are close to a boundary. Thus,
for example, the student who is at the top
of a B category can more easily accept a
B+, which differentiates him from those
with B's and B-'s, than simply being
lumped with all B's.
In any case, the decision was not made
in secret, in that there are two student
members of the CAAA and several ASSU
representatives in the faculty senate.
According to Dawson, the two students on
the committee argued in favor of the
change and there were no objections either
in the committee or before the senate.
An opinion survey taken earlier showed
students divided about 60-40 against the

pluses and minuses, and the faculty divided
about the same in favor of them.
There's not too much you can do about
it. If you are concerned with your own
grades, you can ask your professors not to
give you pluses or minuses. Of course, the
decision is up to them, but it can't hurt to
try. If, on the other hand, your complaint
is with the whole system working that way,
the only thing to do is try to bring the
matter back up before the CAAA by
contacting one of its members. However,
Dawson noted that "practically speaking
this is not a time when the committee is
likely to do much about it."

Why did Stanford decide, to put their
"Lunar Rover Test Area" between the Post
Office and the new Law School? The
"road" to the parking lot behind the
Bookstore is so messed up with "'craters,"
etc. that it would even give jeeps a hard
time. J.B.
The first reaction from campus
administrators to this complaint is
sympathy—both to you who have to use
this road, and to the law school contractor,
Olsen Construction Company, who is
responsible for the road and who is being
financially ruined by all the rain this year.
The problem is recognized, however,

(Oscar Nelson in the planning office noted
that "If you went down there today, you
would make a stronger statement than
that.") and remedy is on the way.
Weather permitting, this coming
weekend the road will be blocked off and
reworked so that it will last at least another
six or seven months until the summer when
it will be permanently rebuilt in line with
the original construction plans.
The problem became as bad as it did
because the responsibility for maintaining
the road has belonged to the contractor,
but they have been far behind on the law
school already, and unwilling to resurface
that road. According to Dwight Adams,
director of University facilities, "they are
loosing their shirt on that contract right
now. The bad weather couldn't have hit at
a worse time." In any case, a compromise
was worked out last week in which the
University will help pay for part of the
work on the road.
Only one problem left, however. Adams
informed me yesterday that he had just
received a report predicting that a storm
lasting a month would hit the Bay Area
next Monday. Ouch.

Last week someone asked about the
installation of a new traffic signal at
Arboretum and Palm Drive. What 1 would

like to know is why the roads around
Stanford are in such pathetically bad
condition in general? The intersection of
Galvez and Serra Streets is like driving
through a mine field. Campus Drive from
Stern Hall to Lasuen Street is hardly any
better. Is the University deliberately trying
to impede traffic flow around the campus?
W.B.M.
Basically, the answer to this question is
that there isn't enough money to keep all
the roads in the best condition. There is a
policy of trying to keep traffic away from
the center of campus, but I don't know of
any policy to impede the flow around the
outside.
As to the two specific places you
mentioned, the situations are as follows:
Campus drive from Alvarado to Lasuen
is scheduled to be moved at some
indefinite time in the future, so it doesn't
make sense to rebuild the road where it is.
When it is moved, it will run from the
present intersection at Alvarado straight to
the intersection of Mayfield with Lasuen.
Stillman house will have to be jacked up
and moved down the street out of the
way—assuming the funding is approved.
On the Galvez street problem expect
"no substantial improvement for quite
some time." According to University
Planning Director Oscar Nelson, "That
street is hopeless." He said any rebuilding
would cost in six figures, which just isn't
available. Meanwhile, plant services will
just have to patch it up as best as they can.

recommendation from the Academic
Council's Committee on Academic
Appraisal and Achievement (CAAA).
This committee is headed by Prof. Phil
Dawson, who explained that the rationale
behind the decision was that by breaking
the three grade categories into essentially
nine categories it takes pressure off those
people who are close to a boundary. Thus,
for example, the student who is at the top
of a B category can more easily accept a
B+, which differentiates him from those
with B's and B-'s, than simply being
lumped with all B's.
In any case, the decision was not made
in secret, in that there are two student
members of the CAAA and several ASSU
representatives in the faculty senate.
According to Dawson, the two students on
the committee argued in favor of the
change and there were no objections either
in the committee or before the senate.
An opinion survey taken earlier showed
students divided about 60-40 against the

pluses and minuses, and the faculty divided
about the same in favor of them.
There's not too much you can do about
it. If you are concerned with your own
grades, you can ask your professors not to
give you pluses or minuses. Of course, the
decision is up to them, but it can't hurt to
try. If, on the other hand, your complaint
is with the whole system working that way,
the only thing to do is try to bring the
matter back up before the CAAA by
contacting one of its members. However,
Dawson noted that "practically speaking
this is not a time when the committee is
likely to do much about it."

Why did Stanford decide, to put their
"Lunar Rover Test Area" between the Post
Office and the new Law School? The
"road" to the parking lot behind the
Bookstore is so messed up with "'craters,"
etc. that it would even give jeeps a hard
time. J.B.
The first reaction from campus
administrators to this complaint is
sympathy—both to you who have to use
this road, and to the law school contractor,
Olsen Construction Company, who is
responsible for the road and who is being
financially ruined by all the rain this year.
The problem is recognized, however,

(Oscar Nelson in the planning office noted
that "If you went down there today, you
would make a stronger statement than
that.") and remedy is on the way.
Weather permitting, this coming
weekend the road will be blocked off and
reworked so that it will last at least another
six or seven months until the summer when
it will be permanently rebuilt in line with
the original construction plans.
The problem became as bad as it did
because the responsibility for maintaining
the road has belonged to the contractor,
but they have been far behind on the law
school already, and unwilling to resurface
that road. According to Dwight Adams,
director of University facilities, "they are
loosing their shirt on that contract right
now. The bad weather couldn't have hit at
a worse time." In any case, a compromise
was worked out last week in which the
University will help pay for part of the
work on the road.
Only one problem left, however. Adams
informed me yesterday that he had just
received a report predicting that a storm
lasting a month would hit the Bay Area
next Monday. Ouch.

Last week someone asked about the
installation of a new traffic signal at
Arboretum and Palm Drive. What 1 would

like to know is why the roads around
Stanford are in such pathetically bad
condition in general? The intersection of
Galvez and Serra Streets is like driving
through a mine field. Campus Drive from
Stern Hall to Lasuen Street is hardly any
better. Is the University deliberately trying
to impede traffic flow around the campus?
W.B.M.
Basically, the answer to this question is
that there isn't enough money to keep all
the roads in the best condition. There is a
policy of trying to keep traffic away from
the center of campus, but I don't know of
any policy to impede the flow around the
outside.
As to the two specific places you
mentioned, the situations are as follows:
Campus drive from Alvarado to Lasuen
is scheduled to be moved at some
indefinite time in the future, so it doesn't
make sense to rebuild the road where it is.
When it is moved, it will run from the
present intersection at Alvarado straight to
the intersection of Mayfield with Lasuen.
Stillman house will have to be jacked up
and moved down the street out of the
way—assuming the funding is approved.
On the Galvez street problem expect
"no substantial improvement for quite
some time." According to University
Planning Director Oscar Nelson, "That
street is hopeless." He said any rebuilding
would cost in six figures, which just isn't
available. Meanwhile, plant services will
just have to patch it up as best as they can.
To the dismay of thousands, "plus' 1 and
"minus" grades—which I thought had
disappeared forever— suddenly showed up
again on Fall Quarter grade reports. How
come? Who makes these mysterious
decisions? Why don't they ever tell
anybody? And is there any way of going
back to plain A's, B's, and C's? D.D.M.

lumped with all B's.
In any case, the decision was not made
in secret, in that there are two student
members of the CAAA and several ASSU
representatives in the faculty senate.
According to Dawson, the two students on
the committee argued in favor of the
change and there were no objections either
in the committee or before the senate.
An opinion survey taken earlier showed
students divided about 60-40 against the

pluses and minuses, and the faculty divided
about the same in favor of them.
There's not too much you can do about
it. If you are concerned with your own
grades, you can ask your professors not to
give you pluses or minuses. Of course, the
decision is up to them, but it can't hurt to
try. If, on the other hand, your complaint
is with the whole system working that way,
the only thing to do is try to bring the
matter back up before the CAAA by
contacting one of its members. However,
Dawson noted that "practically speaking
this is not a time when the committee is
likely to do much about it."

Why did Stanford decide, to put their
"Lunar Rover Test Area" between the Post
Office and the new Law School? The
"road" to the parking lot behind the
Bookstore is so messed up with "'craters,"
etc. that it would even give jeeps a hard
time. J.B.
The first reaction from campus
administrators to this complaint is
sympathy—both to you who have to use
this road, and to the law school contractor,
Olsen Construction Company, who is
responsible for the road and who is being
financially ruined by all the rain this year.
The problem is recognized, however,

(Oscar Nelson in the planning office noted
that "If you went down there today, you
would make a stronger statement than
that.") and remedy is on the way.
Weather permitting, this coming
weekend the road will be blocked off and
reworked so that it will last at least another
six or seven months until the summer when
it will be permanently rebuilt in line with
the original construction plans.
The problem became as bad as it did
because the responsibility for maintaining
the road has belonged to the contractor,
but they have been far behind on the law
school already, and unwilling to resurface
that road. According to Dwight Adams,
director of University facilities, "they are
loosing their shirt on that contract right
now. The bad weather couldn't have hit at
a worse time." In any case, a compromise
was worked out last week in which the
University will help pay for part of the
work on the road.
Only one problem left, however. Adams
informed me yesterday that he had just
received a report predicting that a storm
lasting a month would hit the Bay Area
next Monday. Ouch.

Last week someone asked about the
installation of a new traffic signal at
Arboretum and Palm Drive. What 1 would

like to know is why the roads around
Stanford are in such pathetically bad
condition in general? The intersection of
Galvez and Serra Streets is like driving
through a mine field. Campus Drive from
Stern Hall to Lasuen Street is hardly any
better. Is the University deliberately trying
to impede traffic flow around the campus?
W.B.M.
Basically, the answer to this question is
that there isn't enough money to keep all
the roads in the best condition. There is a
policy of trying to keep traffic away from
the center of campus, but I don't know of
any policy to impede the flow around the
outside.
As to the two specific places you
mentioned, the situations are as follows:
Campus drive from Alvarado to Lasuen
is scheduled to be moved at some
indefinite time in the future, so it doesn't
make sense to rebuild the road where it is.
When it is moved, it will run from the
present intersection at Alvarado straight to
the intersection of Mayfield with Lasuen.
Stillman house will have to be jacked up
and moved down the street out of the
way—assuming the funding is approved.
On the Galvez street problem expect
"no substantial improvement for quite
some time." According to University
Planning Director Oscar Nelson, "That
street is hopeless." He said any rebuilding
would cost in six figures, which just isn't
available. Meanwhile, plant services will
just have to patch it up as best as they can.
To the dismay of thousands, "plus' 1 and
"minus" grades—which I thought had
disappeared forever— suddenly showed up
again on Fall Quarter grade reports. How
come? Who makes these mysterious
decisions? Why don't they ever tell
anybody? And is there any way of going
back to plain A's, B's, and C's? D.D.M.
The decision to reinstitute plus and
minus grading was made last spring by the
faculty senate in accord with a
recommendation from the Academic
Council's Committee on Academic
Appraisal and Achievement (CAAA).
This committee is headed by Prof. Phil
Dawson, who explained that the rationale
behind the decision was that by breaking
the three grade categories into essentially
nine categories it takes pressure off those
people who are close to a boundary. Thus,
for example, the student who is at the top
of a B category can more easily accept a
B+, which differentiates him from those
with B's and B-'s, than simply being
lumped with all B's.
In any case, the decision was not made
in secret, in that there are two student
