# Dorothy Stickney Gives Bad Vincent Millay Performance
## 
### STU ALLEN 
Somebody ought to investigate the
Committee on Public Events: In particular
students should ask why more events that
entertain students are not scheduled, and how
much tuition money is currently used to
support the present list of "attractions."
Dorothy Stickney drew three-fourths of a full
house to Dinkelspiel Auditorium Friday night
for her interpretation of the life of Edna St.
Vincent Millay, an interpretation that was
generally tedious.
Stickney portrayed Vincent Millay reading
and writing her letters, and less often, read
Millay's poetry. The acting was consistently
overdone, and sometimes ludicrous, as when
Stickney would alternately pretend to scrawl
on a blank page with nothing in her hand, and
stare off at different parts of the ceiling.
The transitions between pieces were
sometimes abrupt and sometimes coy, but
nearly always obvious and distracting.

Stickney's decision to carry around a sheaf of
paper representing the poetry and letters that
she was reading seems unfortunate; it typified
the way in which her performance tended to
obtrude upon the life of Vincent Millay.
Edna St. Vincent Millay was raised in
Camden, Maine, still a picturesque harbor
town. Her family, which included her mother
and two sisters, was very close, and it was
painful for Vincent to leave for New York
City and Vassar College.
Famous Poem
Perhaps her most famous poem was written
soon after. It was called "Renascence," and
includes the titles of Acts One and Three of
Stickney's portrait. 'The world stands out on
either side,/ No wider than the heart is
wide... . The soul can split the sky in two/
And let the face of God shine through."
Vincent Millay underwent severe trials of
love and faith twice in her life. First when she
lost her first love, and then again, late in life,

when she was forced to cope with the death
of her husband and the imminence of her
own.
At these times her talent for expressing her
innermost feelings in writing adds a resonance
to her poetry. This quality allowed Stickney's
show to affect all the viewers, because Millay's
poetry spoke of feelings all know and only
infrequently share with others.
These two crises were portrayed in Acts
One and Three; devoid of this appeal, Act
Two was less interesting. One would have to
be a Millay-phile to sustain an interest through
letters telling of the parties she and her
husband threw at their Massachusetts hilltop
home.
It should be noted that the audience called
Stickney back for three curtain calls. To this
reviewer, however, it appeard that (to
paraphrase another's famous line) Stickney
played Edna St. Vincent Millay and lost.
