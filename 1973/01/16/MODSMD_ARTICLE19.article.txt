# Seiji Ozawa, S.F. Symphony Display Exciting Versatility
## 
### DOUG SMITH 
Seiji Ozawa conducted the San
Francisco Symphony in an
extraordinary performance of
three very different works last
Wednesday evening in the War
Memorial Opera House. He and
the orchestra were perfectly at
home in the classic, romantic and
modem periods as they performed
works by Haydn, Berlioz and
Prokofiev.
Haydn's "Symphony No. 73"
("The Hunt") dates from. 1781.
Its finale, the highlight of the
piece, was adapted from the
prelude to the third act of a comic
opera ("La Fedelta premiata")
which the composer had produced
a year earlier. It is a rollicking
hunting scene, from which the
symphony's name is derived.
Ozawa began the slow
introduction in an elegantly
expressive manner, then launched
into a spirited, almost passionate
Allegro. The Andante and Minuet
were marked by beautiful, lightly
flowing phrases. The high point
was the finale, an intense, driving
performance by cgnductor and
orchestra. The violins were
particularly outstanding, matching
their prominence in the
symphony with precision in both
phrasing and intonation.

Hector Berlioz' "Les Nuits
d'Ete" (song cycle) is less known
than his "Symphonie fant|»stique"
or "Harold in Italy," ; but it
certainly deserves the attention of
the romanticism fan or of the
vocal music enthusiast. The six
songs, set to texts by tne poet
Theophile Gautier, are gorgeous
expressions of melancholy.
Perfect Voice
Janet Baker, the celebrated
English contralto, has the perfect
voice for such music. Her tone is
ravishing and makes Berlioz'
melodies exquisitely painful, as
with the octave leaps followed by
falling phrases in the second song.
Particularly in this song, "La
Spectre de la Rose," Miss Baker
held the audience absolutely
spellbound. There was
spontaneous applause from many
in the audience at its close, even
though the patrons were aware
that they are normally expected
to reward the singer after the
whole cycle is done.
In all six songs she exhibited
beautiful French intonation and
color, and seemingly effortless
control of her voice. She sang very
convincingly, without any
affectation, and at times her
whole body appeared to be racked
with the pain of lost love and

loneliness. Miss Baker has
recorded "Les Nuits d'ete" on
Angel, and I intend to buy the
record.
If the soloist dominated the
song cycle, much credit is
nonetheless due to Maestro
Ozawa, who is a masterful
accompanist. The orchestra has
very interesting music of its own
in these pieces, but was never
allowed to intrude unduly or to
overpower the contralto.
Following the intermission,
Ozawa stepped to the podium,
raised his baton and started
Prokofiev's "Scythian Suite" in
one quick movement. This taut
beginning was characteristic of the
entire performance. Ozawa's
control of rhythm was superb,
and he handled color and
dynamics expertly.
The San Francisco musicians
followed him extremely well,
slipping im perceptively into
inaudibility when they were
hushed. The brasses were precise,
especially in one noisy fanfare in
the second movement.
The "Scythian Suite" (1914) is
a brash piece, composed on the
encouragement of Diaghilev, the
same impresario who had
commissioned Stravinsky's
"Firebird," "Petrushka" and

"Rite of Spring." Prokofiev was
familiar with these pieces, and his
suite, originally composed as a
ballet, is strongly under their
influence.
The subject, the life of an
ancient Russian tribe, is
reminiscent of the "Rite," and
Prokofiev's rhythms, orchestral
colors and cacophony also remind
me of early Stravinsky. However,
in contrast to Stravinsky's
sophisticated syncopations, the
younger composer's rhythms are a
bit square and predictable. This
suite will probably continue to
remain in the shadow of the "Rite
of Spring."
Apparently the composer
realized that primitivism and
cacophony were not his strength,
for in his later works Prokofiev
turned to a more lyrical and
classical style. There was a hint of
this in the final movement, which
has snatches of those sprightly,
disjunct melodies we associate
with Prokofiev.
Despite the weaknesses of the
work, Ozawa and the San
Francisco Symphony turned in an
exciting performance which built
to a terrific climax at the very end
and brought to a close one of the
finest concerts I have ever
attended anywhere.
