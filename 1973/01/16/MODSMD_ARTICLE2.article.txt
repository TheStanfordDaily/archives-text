# Group Seeks Responsible Investments

### LARRY FLEECE 
Over the past several years
Stanford, like other colleges and
universities nationwide, has fought a
continuing battle to place the
University's income on a par with the
increasingly burdensome costs of
education. One major weapon of
Stanford's arsenal in this battle is its
investment fund.
This fund, which is fed by gifts to
the University from private and public
donors, seeks to bring maximum
growth and return to the University's
finances through investments in
private corporations, primarily in
stocks and bonds.
The investment fund is divided into
two separate pools: 1) the Merged
Endowment Fund; and 2) the Yield
and Gain Fund. Simply, the Merged
Endowment Fund is primarily
concerned with present returns, and so
its investments seek to provide a high
yield from dividends and interest. In
four years, this fund has increased its
market value $3.1 million, from
$151.6 million at its inception in 1968
to $154.7 million as of last year.
Longer Term Gains
The Yield and Gain Fund focuses
on longer term gains, and its
investments are almost entirely in
common stocks. As such, this fund is
capable of greater long-range profit. In
1968, the market value of assets in the
Yield and Gain Fund was $59.3
million; in 1972 its market value had
almost doubled, to $100.7 million.
The sum assets of these two pools
— approximately $255 million — is the
total market value of current
University investments.
The investment funds are
administered by professional
investment managers, exterior to the
University. Three major firms manage

the University funds, the largest of
these being the American Express
Asset Management Company. These
firms report their actions on a weekly
basis to Robert Augsberger, University
Vice President of Business and
Finance.
Augsberger, in turn, reviews and
submits these investment actions to
the Board of Trustees for its approval.
Federal trust law dictates that it is the
trustees who have the ultimate
responsibility for all investment
decisions.
Break Up Investment
Rodney Adams, Investment
Manager for Augsberger, explained
that the general practice is to break up
the investment fund into "small,"
$500,000 - $1 million "chunks," and
to invest in a wide variety of corporate
stock. Adams explained that the
University investment policy is one of
caution and general stability, and in
order to assure the security of
investment, Adams said "We don't put
all our eggs in one basket."
University investments range over
some 70-80 diverse corporations, with
major holdings in such industrial
categories as banking and finance,
public utilities, oil and oil service,
insurance, and electrical equipment
and electronics. On emphasizing the
cautious nature of University
investments, Adams cited the slow
turnover rate of holdings, which he
estimated at 15-20% annually.
The Trustees Committee on
Investments, composed of six
Trustees, two ex-officio members, one
faculty member and one student,
oversees the investment actions of the
external investment managers. It is the
duty of this body to originate broad
investment policy guidelines, such as
the ratio of common stocks to bonds,

risk allowances, and income goals. This
committee meets regularly nine times
a year, and recommends financial
guidelines to the Trustees.
But in the spring of 1971, an ad
hoc committee headed by Prof. G.L.
Bach of the Graduate School of
Business suggested to the trustees that
financial criteria alone were not
sufficient as guidelines for investment
policy. The report of Bach's
committee stated, in part: "The
trustees will expect to give
independent consideration and weight
to the possible social, economic, and
political implications of University

investment policy."
Bach's committee asserted that
these factors, beyond mere financial
gain, should be applied in assessing the
desirability of an investment. It
further emphasized that investment
should be carefully evaluated in cases
where: the undesirable social,
economic, and political acts of the
company involved are "direct and
substantial"; "substantial consensus"
exists in the University community on
the undesirability of the acts or effects
in question; and the costs to the
University of taking action are

SOLITARY PROTEST — This lone marker was erected in White Plaza yesterday
afternoon to protest the bombing of North Vietnam. University workmen were
called to remove the marker, and voiced fears that the surrounding rocks would
be thrown at them. They completed their job without an incident, however.
