Four Watergate Guilty Pleas
WASHINGTON — Four more defendants in the
Democratic headquarters bugging case pleaded guilty
yesterday saying they had done their job not for pay but
because it was "the right thing to do."
Their removal from the trial leaves only George
Gordon Liddy, former counsel for the Finance Gommittee
to Re-elect the President and James W. McCord Jr., the
re-election committee's security chief, as defendants in
the case that started with seven men charged. E. Howard
Hunt Jr., a former White House consultant, pleaded guilty
last Wednesday.
U.S. District Judge John J. Sirica questioned the four
defendants closely before accepting their guilty plea on all
seven counts and ordering each held under $100,000
sureity bond.
An attorney for the four Miamians said his clients were
not able to raise the bond and would remain in jail until
sentencing.
The four men are Bernard L. Barker, 55; Eugenio R.
Martinez, 50; Frank A. Sturgis, 37 and Virgilio R.
Gonzalez, all of Miami.
There were published reports over the weekend that
the men had been promised that their families would be
taken care of if they pleaded guilty and accepted prison
sentences. Judge Sirica questioned each man about this.
All denied there was pressure or promises behind their
pleas.
Corona Jury Deadlocks
FAIRFIELD — After deliberating four days, the Juan
Corona mass murder trial jury reported an 8-4 deadlock
yesterday. But the judge ordered the jury to persist in
trying to reach a verdict.
"We have reached what appears to be an impasse," jury
foreman Ernest Phillips stated as an expressionless Corona
looked on. "We cannot decide one way or another about
guilt or innocence."
The judge said he does not want to hear from the jury
again on the deadlock issue before noon today.
"You should not surrender your honest
convictions ... to return a verdict," he cautioned, adding
that panelists should change their vote only if convinced
their previous ballot was incorrect.
Corona, a Mexican citizen, is accused of hacking 25
migrant farm workers to death and secretly burying them
in peach orchards in the spring of 1971 near Yuba City,
Calif.
Since his predawn arrest May 26, 1971, he has suffered
two heart attacks while being held without bail.
Corona's attorney said the main reason he did not put
the defendant on the stand during the four-month trial
was advice from a doctor who said Corona might have a
fatal seizure under the strain of being questioned.
Corona was stricken Friday night just after his return
to Vacaville from a jail cell next to the Fairfield
courtroom where the sequestered jury was deliberating.
The jury panel was instructed to return verdicts for 25
separate murder charges, the largest number in a single
trial in U.S. history.
Ceremony Honors Dr. King
ATLANTA — The widow of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.,
hometown friends and associates marked the 44th
anniversary of the slain civil rights leader's birth with a
wreath-laying ceremony yesterday at his grave in a black
neighborhood shadowed by Atlanta's skyline.
But at the Georgia Capitol a mile away, Lt. Gov. Lester
Maddox blocked a resolution offered by a black state
senator calling for the state Senate to set aside Jan. 15 as a
special day honoring the Nobel laureate.
"We might as well set aside a day in honor of Benedict
Arnold," said Maddox, who gained headlines in 1964
when he chased blacks from his Atlanta restaurant with a
pick handle.
State Rep. Ben Brown, who is black, said he would
introduce a resolution in the House designating the day a
state holiday. Gov. Jimmy Carter earlier had signed a
proclamation honoring the date and referring to King,
who was assassinated in Memphis, Tenn., in April 1968 as
a leader of men.
In Atlanta, Mrs. King was solemn-faced as she stood
with her children and other family members in front of
her husband's white marble crypt. The wreath was
covered with daisies and red and white carnations.

Dr. Benjamin Mays, a long-time family friend and
King's spiritual mentor, delivered a brief prayer before the
group of about 50 persons who stood inside the white
picket fence surrounding the crypt and an eternal flame.
Senate Plans Press Study
WASHINGTON — A Senate subcommittee plans to begin
hearings Feb. 20 on various measures to protect newsmen
from being compelled to disclose confidential news
sources and information.
Sen. Sam J. Ervin Jr. (D-N.C.), in announcing the plans
yesterday, referred to the legislation as "a means of
protecting the people's right to be informed."
Ervin is chairman of the Senate Judiciary
subcommittee on constitutional rights. In the House, Rep.
Robert W. Kastenmeier (D-Wis.), chairman of a Judiciary
subcommittee, has announced that his group also plans
hearings early this year on bills on newsmen's privilege.
Last June the Supreme Court held that the First
Amendment guarantee of a free press did not give a
reporter the right to refuse to testify before a grand jury
about information given to him in confidence.
Sponsors of various Senate measures on the matter say
that if newsmen are forced to reveal their sources under
threat of being jailed, news sources will tend to dry up.
"Whatever short-term benefits may flow from
government's reliance upon newsmen for evidence in
governmental proceedings, the long-term threat to the
public's right to be informed about the controversial as
well as the routine is too great a risk to take in a free
society," Ervin said in a statement.
Magee Murder Trial Opens
SAN FRANCISCO - Baliffs hustled Ruchell Magee,
defiant and shouting, from the courtroom yesterday as
the prosecutor started his opening statement to the jury
trying the black convict on a charge of killing a judge in a
bloody courthouse escape attempt.
Magee, 33, has pleaded innocent to charges of
kidnapping and murder in the Aug. 7, 1970, Marin
County Civic Center violence in which Superior Court
Judge Harold J. Haley and three abductors died.
Black militant Angela Davis was acquitted last June
after a 13-week trial in San Jose on charges of supplying
guns and conspiring in the courtroom kidnap raid.
Superior Court Judge Morton R. Colvin three times
warned Magee not to make audible remarks before the
jury. When Magee persisted in talking loudly to his
counsel, Colvin ordered his removal to a holding cell.
Magee then stood up and shouted to the jury of six
men and six women that he had filed an appeal
challenging the whole proceedings.
He could hear the court proceedings through a
loudspeaker in his cell. It was expected that he would be
summoned back to court today.
The jury, at Colvin's instructions, has been sequestered
nightly in a hotel room since Jan. 5, and will be isolated
throughout the whole trial.
Court Clears S.F. Students
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court yesterday curbed a
move by officials at San Francisco State College to punish
two students who participated in a forbidden rally during
a campus strike four years ago.
Federal courts in San Francisco had barred the
university from disciplining the students, Mason Wong and
Patricia Woolman. The courts found there was no
substantial evidence the students did not have when they
were told to disperse.
Meanwhile, the university's disciplinary committee
decided to suspend Wong for six months and to give Miss
Woolman a written reprimand on the basis of the police
report. However, U.S. Dist. Judge Alfonso J. Zirpoli and
later the U.S. Circuit Court held the report contained no
evidence that Wong or Miss Woolman did anything wrong.
The university's appeal disagreed. It said there was
substantial evidence to support the disciplinary action.
Moreover, the university said it should have broad powers
to maintain order and to discipline students.

not able to raise the bond and would remain in jail until
sentencing.
The four men are Bernard L. Barker, 55; Eugenio R.
Martinez, 50; Frank A. Sturgis, 37 and Virgilio R.
Gonzalez, all of Miami.
There were published reports over the weekend that
the men had been promised that their families would be
taken care of if they pleaded guilty and accepted prison
sentences. Judge Sirica questioned each man about this.
All denied there was pressure or promises behind their
pleas.
Corona Jury Deadlocks
FAIRFIELD — After deliberating four days, the Juan
Corona mass murder trial jury reported an 8-4 deadlock
yesterday. But the judge ordered the jury to persist in
trying to reach a verdict.
"We have reached what appears to be an impasse," jury
foreman Ernest Phillips stated as an expressionless Corona
looked on. "We cannot decide one way or another about
guilt or innocence."
The judge said he does not want to hear from the jury
again on the deadlock issue before noon today.
"You should not surrender your honest
convictions ... to return a verdict," he cautioned, adding
that panelists should change their vote only if convinced
their previous ballot was incorrect.
Corona, a Mexican citizen, is accused of hacking 25
migrant farm workers to death and secretly burying them
in peach orchards in the spring of 1971 near Yuba City,
Calif.
Since his predawn arrest May 26, 1971, he has suffered
two heart attacks while being held without bail.
Corona's attorney said the main reason he did not put
the defendant on the stand during the four-month trial
was advice from a doctor who said Corona might have a
fatal seizure under the strain of being questioned.
Corona was stricken Friday night just after his return
to Vacaville from a jail cell next to the Fairfield
courtroom where the sequestered jury was deliberating.
The jury panel was instructed to return verdicts for 25
separate murder charges, the largest number in a single
trial in U.S. history.
Ceremony Honors Dr. King
ATLANTA — The widow of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.,
hometown friends and associates marked the 44th
anniversary of the slain civil rights leader's birth with a
wreath-laying ceremony yesterday at his grave in a black
neighborhood shadowed by Atlanta's skyline.
But at the Georgia Capitol a mile away, Lt. Gov. Lester
Maddox blocked a resolution offered by a black state
senator calling for the state Senate to set aside Jan. 15 as a
special day honoring the Nobel laureate.
"We might as well set aside a day in honor of Benedict
Arnold," said Maddox, who gained headlines in 1964
when he chased blacks from his Atlanta restaurant with a
pick handle.
State Rep. Ben Brown, who is black, said he would
introduce a resolution in the House designating the day a
state holiday. Gov. Jimmy Carter earlier had signed a
proclamation honoring the date and referring to King,
who was assassinated in Memphis, Tenn., in April 1968 as
a leader of men.
In Atlanta, Mrs. King was solemn-faced as she stood
with her children and other family members in front of
her husband's white marble crypt. The wreath was
covered with daisies and red and white carnations.

Dr. Benjamin Mays, a long-time family friend and
King's spiritual mentor, delivered a brief prayer before the
group of about 50 persons who stood inside the white
picket fence surrounding the crypt and an eternal flame.
Senate Plans Press Study
WASHINGTON — A Senate subcommittee plans to begin
hearings Feb. 20 on various measures to protect newsmen
from being compelled to disclose confidential news
sources and information.
Sen. Sam J. Ervin Jr. (D-N.C.), in announcing the plans
yesterday, referred to the legislation as "a means of
protecting the people's right to be informed."
Ervin is chairman of the Senate Judiciary
subcommittee on constitutional rights. In the House, Rep.
Robert W. Kastenmeier (D-Wis.), chairman of a Judiciary
subcommittee, has announced that his group also plans
hearings early this year on bills on newsmen's privilege.
Last June the Supreme Court held that the First
Amendment guarantee of a free press did not give a
reporter the right to refuse to testify before a grand jury
about information given to him in confidence.
Sponsors of various Senate measures on the matter say
that if newsmen are forced to reveal their sources under
threat of being jailed, news sources will tend to dry up.
"Whatever short-term benefits may flow from
government's reliance upon newsmen for evidence in
governmental proceedings, the long-term threat to the
public's right to be informed about the controversial as
well as the routine is too great a risk to take in a free
society," Ervin said in a statement.
Magee Murder Trial Opens
SAN FRANCISCO - Baliffs hustled Ruchell Magee,
defiant and shouting, from the courtroom yesterday as
the prosecutor started his opening statement to the jury
trying the black convict on a charge of killing a judge in a
bloody courthouse escape attempt.
Magee, 33, has pleaded innocent to charges of
kidnapping and murder in the Aug. 7, 1970, Marin
County Civic Center violence in which Superior Court
Judge Harold J. Haley and three abductors died.
Black militant Angela Davis was acquitted last June
after a 13-week trial in San Jose on charges of supplying
guns and conspiring in the courtroom kidnap raid.
Superior Court Judge Morton R. Colvin three times
warned Magee not to make audible remarks before the
jury. When Magee persisted in talking loudly to his
counsel, Colvin ordered his removal to a holding cell.
Magee then stood up and shouted to the jury of six
men and six women that he had filed an appeal
challenging the whole proceedings.
He could hear the court proceedings through a
loudspeaker in his cell. It was expected that he would be
summoned back to court today.
The jury, at Colvin's instructions, has been sequestered
nightly in a hotel room since Jan. 5, and will be isolated
throughout the whole trial.
Court Clears S.F. Students
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court yesterday curbed a
move by officials at San Francisco State College to punish
two students who participated in a forbidden rally during
a campus strike four years ago.
Federal courts in San Francisco had barred the
university from disciplining the students, Mason Wong and
Patricia Woolman. The courts found there was no
substantial evidence the students did not have when they
were told to disperse.
Meanwhile, the university's disciplinary committee
decided to suspend Wong for six months and to give Miss
Woolman a written reprimand on the basis of the police
report. However, U.S. Dist. Judge Alfonso J. Zirpoli and
later the U.S. Circuit Court held the report contained no
evidence that Wong or Miss Woolman did anything wrong.
The university's appeal disagreed. It said there was
substantial evidence to support the disciplinary action.
Moreover, the university said it should have broad powers
to maintain order and to discipline students.

Four Watergate Guilty Pleas
WASHINGTON — Four more defendants in the
Democratic headquarters bugging case pleaded guilty
yesterday saying they had done their job not for pay but
because it was "the right thing to do."
Their removal from the trial leaves only George
Gordon Liddy, former counsel for the Finance Gommittee
to Re-elect the President and James W. McCord Jr., the
re-election committee's security chief, as defendants in
the case that started with seven men charged. E. Howard
Hunt Jr., a former White House consultant, pleaded guilty
last Wednesday.
U.S. District Judge John J. Sirica questioned the four
defendants closely before accepting their guilty plea on all
seven counts and ordering each held under $100,000
sureity bond.
An attorney for the four Miamians said his clients were
not able to raise the bond and would remain in jail until
sentencing.

looked on. "We cannot decide one way or another about
guilt or innocence."
The judge said he does not want to hear from the jury
again on the deadlock issue before noon today.
"You should not surrender your honest
convictions ... to return a verdict," he cautioned, adding
that panelists should change their vote only if convinced
their previous ballot was incorrect.
Corona, a Mexican citizen, is accused of hacking 25
migrant farm workers to death and secretly burying them
in peach orchards in the spring of 1971 near Yuba City,
Calif.
Since his predawn arrest May 26, 1971, he has suffered
two heart attacks while being held without bail.
Corona's attorney said the main reason he did not put
the defendant on the stand during the four-month trial
was advice from a doctor who said Corona might have a
fatal seizure under the strain of being questioned.
Corona was stricken Friday night just after his return
to Vacaville from a jail cell next to the Fairfield
courtroom where the sequestered jury was deliberating.
The jury panel was instructed to return verdicts for 25
separate murder charges, the largest number in a single
trial in U.S. history.
Ceremony Honors Dr. King
ATLANTA — The widow of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.,
hometown friends and associates marked the 44th
anniversary of the slain civil rights leader's birth with a
wreath-laying ceremony yesterday at his grave in a black
neighborhood shadowed by Atlanta's skyline.
But at the Georgia Capitol a mile away, Lt. Gov. Lester
Maddox blocked a resolution offered by a black state
senator calling for the state Senate to set aside Jan. 15 as a
special day honoring the Nobel laureate.
"We might as well set aside a day in honor of Benedict
Arnold," said Maddox, who gained headlines in 1964
when he chased blacks from his Atlanta restaurant with a
pick handle.
State Rep. Ben Brown, who is black, said he would
introduce a resolution in the House designating the day a
state holiday. Gov. Jimmy Carter earlier had signed a
proclamation honoring the date and referring to King,
who was assassinated in Memphis, Tenn., in April 1968 as
a leader of men.
In Atlanta, Mrs. King was solemn-faced as she stood
with her children and other family members in front of
her husband's white marble crypt. The wreath was
covered with daisies and red and white carnations.

Dr. Benjamin Mays, a long-time family friend and
King's spiritual mentor, delivered a brief prayer before the
group of about 50 persons who stood inside the white
picket fence surrounding the crypt and an eternal flame.
Senate Plans Press Study
WASHINGTON — A Senate subcommittee plans to begin
hearings Feb. 20 on various measures to protect newsmen
from being compelled to disclose confidential news
sources and information.
Sen. Sam J. Ervin Jr. (D-N.C.), in announcing the plans
yesterday, referred to the legislation as "a means of
protecting the people's right to be informed."
Ervin is chairman of the Senate Judiciary
subcommittee on constitutional rights. In the House, Rep.
Robert W. Kastenmeier (D-Wis.), chairman of a Judiciary
subcommittee, has announced that his group also plans
hearings early this year on bills on newsmen's privilege.
Last June the Supreme Court held that the First
Amendment guarantee of a free press did not give a
reporter the right to refuse to testify before a grand jury
about information given to him in confidence.
Sponsors of various Senate measures on the matter say
that if newsmen are forced to reveal their sources under
threat of being jailed, news sources will tend to dry up.
"Whatever short-term benefits may flow from
government's reliance upon newsmen for evidence in
governmental proceedings, the long-term threat to the
public's right to be informed about the controversial as
well as the routine is too great a risk to take in a free
society," Ervin said in a statement.
Magee Murder Trial Opens
SAN FRANCISCO - Baliffs hustled Ruchell Magee,
defiant and shouting, from the courtroom yesterday as
the prosecutor started his opening statement to the jury
trying the black convict on a charge of killing a judge in a
bloody courthouse escape attempt.
Magee, 33, has pleaded innocent to charges of
kidnapping and murder in the Aug. 7, 1970, Marin
County Civic Center violence in which Superior Court
Judge Harold J. Haley and three abductors died.
Black militant Angela Davis was acquitted last June
after a 13-week trial in San Jose on charges of supplying
guns and conspiring in the courtroom kidnap raid.
Superior Court Judge Morton R. Colvin three times
warned Magee not to make audible remarks before the
jury. When Magee persisted in talking loudly to his
counsel, Colvin ordered his removal to a holding cell.
Magee then stood up and shouted to the jury of six
men and six women that he had filed an appeal
challenging the whole proceedings.
He could hear the court proceedings through a
loudspeaker in his cell. It was expected that he would be
summoned back to court today.
The jury, at Colvin's instructions, has been sequestered
nightly in a hotel room since Jan. 5, and will be isolated
throughout the whole trial.
Court Clears S.F. Students
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court yesterday curbed a
move by officials at San Francisco State College to punish
two students who participated in a forbidden rally during
a campus strike four years ago.
Federal courts in San Francisco had barred the
university from disciplining the students, Mason Wong and
Patricia Woolman. The courts found there was no
substantial evidence the students did not have when they
were told to disperse.
Meanwhile, the university's disciplinary committee
decided to suspend Wong for six months and to give Miss
Woolman a written reprimand on the basis of the police
report. However, U.S. Dist. Judge Alfonso J. Zirpoli and
later the U.S. Circuit Court held the report contained no
evidence that Wong or Miss Woolman did anything wrong.
The university's appeal disagreed. It said there was
substantial evidence to support the disciplinary action.
Moreover, the university said it should have broad powers
to maintain order and to discipline students.
Today's Weather
Rain today with a chance of showers tonight and
Wednesday. Little temperature change. Tonight in the 40s

Four Watergate Guilty Pleas
WASHINGTON — Four more defendants in the
Democratic headquarters bugging case pleaded guilty
yesterday saying they had done their job not for pay but
because it was "the right thing to do."
Their removal from the trial leaves only George
Gordon Liddy, former counsel for the Finance Gommittee
to Re-elect the President and James W. McCord Jr., the
re-election committee's security chief, as defendants in
the case that started with seven men charged. E. Howard
Hunt Jr., a former White House consultant, pleaded guilty
last Wednesday.
U.S. District Judge John J. Sirica questioned the four
defendants closely before accepting their guilty plea on all
seven counts and ordering each held under $100,000
sureity bond.
An attorney for the four Miamians said his clients were
not able to raise the bond and would remain in jail until
sentencing.
The four men are Bernard L. Barker, 55; Eugenio R.
Martinez, 50; Frank A. Sturgis, 37 and Virgilio R.
Gonzalez, all of Miami.
There were published reports over the weekend that
the men had been promised that their families would be
taken care of if they pleaded guilty and accepted prison
sentences. Judge Sirica questioned each man about this.
All denied there was pressure or promises behind their
pleas.

was advice from a doctor who said Corona might have a
fatal seizure under the strain of being questioned.
Corona was stricken Friday night just after his return
to Vacaville from a jail cell next to the Fairfield
courtroom where the sequestered jury was deliberating.
The jury panel was instructed to return verdicts for 25
separate murder charges, the largest number in a single
trial in U.S. history.
Ceremony Honors Dr. King
ATLANTA — The widow of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.,
hometown friends and associates marked the 44th
anniversary of the slain civil rights leader's birth with a
wreath-laying ceremony yesterday at his grave in a black
neighborhood shadowed by Atlanta's skyline.
But at the Georgia Capitol a mile away, Lt. Gov. Lester
Maddox blocked a resolution offered by a black state
senator calling for the state Senate to set aside Jan. 15 as a
special day honoring the Nobel laureate.
"We might as well set aside a day in honor of Benedict
Arnold," said Maddox, who gained headlines in 1964
when he chased blacks from his Atlanta restaurant with a
pick handle.
State Rep. Ben Brown, who is black, said he would
introduce a resolution in the House designating the day a
state holiday. Gov. Jimmy Carter earlier had signed a
proclamation honoring the date and referring to King,
who was assassinated in Memphis, Tenn., in April 1968 as
a leader of men.
In Atlanta, Mrs. King was solemn-faced as she stood
with her children and other family members in front of
her husband's white marble crypt. The wreath was
covered with daisies and red and white carnations.

Dr. Benjamin Mays, a long-time family friend and
King's spiritual mentor, delivered a brief prayer before the
group of about 50 persons who stood inside the white
picket fence surrounding the crypt and an eternal flame.
Senate Plans Press Study
WASHINGTON — A Senate subcommittee plans to begin
hearings Feb. 20 on various measures to protect newsmen
from being compelled to disclose confidential news
sources and information.
Sen. Sam J. Ervin Jr. (D-N.C.), in announcing the plans
yesterday, referred to the legislation as "a means of
protecting the people's right to be informed."
Ervin is chairman of the Senate Judiciary
subcommittee on constitutional rights. In the House, Rep.
Robert W. Kastenmeier (D-Wis.), chairman of a Judiciary
subcommittee, has announced that his group also plans
hearings early this year on bills on newsmen's privilege.
Last June the Supreme Court held that the First
Amendment guarantee of a free press did not give a
reporter the right to refuse to testify before a grand jury
about information given to him in confidence.
Sponsors of various Senate measures on the matter say
that if newsmen are forced to reveal their sources under
threat of being jailed, news sources will tend to dry up.
"Whatever short-term benefits may flow from
government's reliance upon newsmen for evidence in
governmental proceedings, the long-term threat to the
public's right to be informed about the controversial as
well as the routine is too great a risk to take in a free
society," Ervin said in a statement.
Magee Murder Trial Opens
SAN FRANCISCO - Baliffs hustled Ruchell Magee,
defiant and shouting, from the courtroom yesterday as
the prosecutor started his opening statement to the jury
trying the black convict on a charge of killing a judge in a
bloody courthouse escape attempt.
Magee, 33, has pleaded innocent to charges of
kidnapping and murder in the Aug. 7, 1970, Marin
County Civic Center violence in which Superior Court
Judge Harold J. Haley and three abductors died.
Black militant Angela Davis was acquitted last June
after a 13-week trial in San Jose on charges of supplying
guns and conspiring in the courtroom kidnap raid.
Superior Court Judge Morton R. Colvin three times
warned Magee not to make audible remarks before the
jury. When Magee persisted in talking loudly to his
counsel, Colvin ordered his removal to a holding cell.
Magee then stood up and shouted to the jury of six
men and six women that he had filed an appeal
challenging the whole proceedings.
He could hear the court proceedings through a
loudspeaker in his cell. It was expected that he would be
summoned back to court today.
The jury, at Colvin's instructions, has been sequestered
nightly in a hotel room since Jan. 5, and will be isolated
throughout the whole trial.
Court Clears S.F. Students
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court yesterday curbed a
move by officials at San Francisco State College to punish
two students who participated in a forbidden rally during
a campus strike four years ago.
Federal courts in San Francisco had barred the
university from disciplining the students, Mason Wong and
Patricia Woolman. The courts found there was no
substantial evidence the students did not have when they
were told to disperse.
Meanwhile, the university's disciplinary committee
decided to suspend Wong for six months and to give Miss
Woolman a written reprimand on the basis of the police
report. However, U.S. Dist. Judge Alfonso J. Zirpoli and
later the U.S. Circuit Court held the report contained no
evidence that Wong or Miss Woolman did anything wrong.
The university's appeal disagreed. It said there was
substantial evidence to support the disciplinary action.
Moreover, the university said it should have broad powers
to maintain order and to discipline students.
Today's Weather
Rain today with a chance of showers tonight and
Wednesday. Little temperature change. Tonight in the 40s
and low 50s. Highs both days in the mid 50s and low 60s.
Chance of rain 80 percent today and 40 percent tonight.
Four Watergate Guilty Pleas
WASHINGTON — Four more defendants in the
Democratic headquarters bugging case pleaded guilty
yesterday saying they had done their job not for pay but
because it was "the right thing to do."
Their removal from the trial leaves only George
Gordon Liddy, former counsel for the Finance Gommittee
to Re-elect the President and James W. McCord Jr., the
re-election committee's security chief, as defendants in
the case that started with seven men charged. E. Howard
Hunt Jr., a former White House consultant, pleaded guilty
last Wednesday.
U.S. District Judge John J. Sirica questioned the four
defendants closely before accepting their guilty plea on all
seven counts and ordering each held under $100,000
sureity bond.
An attorney for the four Miamians said his clients were
not able to raise the bond and would remain in jail until
sentencing.
The four men are Bernard L. Barker, 55; Eugenio R.
Martinez, 50; Frank A. Sturgis, 37 and Virgilio R.
Gonzalez, all of Miami.
There were published reports over the weekend that
the men had been promised that their families would be
taken care of if they pleaded guilty and accepted prison
sentences. Judge Sirica questioned each man about this.
All denied there was pressure or promises behind their
pleas.
Corona Jury Deadlocks
FAIRFIELD — After deliberating four days, the Juan
Corona mass murder trial jury reported an 8-4 deadlock
yesterday. But the judge ordered the jury to persist in
trying to reach a verdict.
"We have reached what appears to be an impasse," jury
foreman Ernest Phillips stated as an expressionless Corona
looked on. "We cannot decide one way or another about
guilt or innocence."
The judge said he does not want to hear from the jury
again on the deadlock issue before noon today.
"You should not surrender your honest
convictions ... to return a verdict," he cautioned, adding
that panelists should change their vote only if convinced
their previous ballot was incorrect.
Corona, a Mexican citizen, is accused of hacking 25
migrant farm workers to death and secretly burying them
in peach orchards in the spring of 1971 near Yuba City,
Calif.
Since his predawn arrest May 26, 1971, he has suffered
two heart attacks while being held without bail.
Corona's attorney said the main reason he did not put
the defendant on the stand during the four-month trial
was advice from a doctor who said Corona might have a
fatal seizure under the strain of being questioned.
Corona was stricken Friday night just after his return
to Vacaville from a jail cell next to the Fairfield
courtroom where the sequestered jury was deliberating.
The jury panel was instructed to return verdicts for 25
separate murder charges, the largest number in a single
