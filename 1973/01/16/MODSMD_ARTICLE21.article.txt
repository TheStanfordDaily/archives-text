# Burglars Hit Old Union
## 
### 
Stanford's caretaker's apartment
and the Volunteers in Asia (VIA)
office in the Old Union Women's
Clubhouse were burglarized over the
weekend, Stanford security officers
and Santa Clara County sheriff's
deputies reported. Losses were
estimated at $240.
Caretaker Grey son Bryan said he
left his apartment to attend a one-day
conference Friday night, after four
persons reportedly tried to push their
way into his room earlier that evening.
When he returned Sunday,
according to KZSU radio, he found his
typewriter and electric shaver missing.
The room had been ransacked, and
broken glass and clothes littered the
apartment.
Dwight Clark, VIA director, said
that a manual typewriter had been
stolen from the office and that the
office has now been burglarized four
times in the last year.
Bryan, the victim of an armed
robbery last month, immediately

moved out of his basement-level
apartment. "1 can only push it so far,"
he said.
According to KZSU, Bryan was
upset that the Dean of Student Affairs
office had scheduled Black Students
Union parties for Friday and Saturday
night, and a Gay People's Union party
for Saturday without informing him.
He said he would have advised against
the parties.

Stanford security chief Marvin
Herrington also reported that
strong-arm robberies of credit cards
and a coat took place in the building
Saturday night during the parties.
He said that BSU officials had been
"extremely co-operative" during the
investigation.
No suspects have been named in
either the burglary or strong-arm
robberies.
