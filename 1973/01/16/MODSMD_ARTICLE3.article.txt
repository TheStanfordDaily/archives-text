# Long Lines Major Complaint
## Wells Fargo Solves Problems 
### BRUCE KADDEN 
Starting its second quarter of
service on campus, the Wells Fargo
Bank, located in Tresidder Union, has
begun to remedy the problems that
plagued its facility early in the
academic year.
Stanford is the first university to
have a Wells Fargo office on its
campus. The bank has branches
bordering the University of Santa
Clara and UC-Berkeley campuses, but
bank officials say the facilities are not
as fully committed to serving students
and faculty as is the Stanford branch,
which opened Sept. 18.
Roger Brown, branch manager, said
that the experimental program had
brought a few surprises concerning the
activity level at certain times of the
day and of the quarter. He added that
the experience gained in the first three
months of operation would be applied
to improvement of services this
quarter.
Brown described the learning
process of the first quarter as "getting
a road map of the activity level at
different times."
Long Lines
Initially the lines were very long,
and they are still quite long at certain
times. "Mondays, Fridays, and
Stanford University pay days are the
busiest," Brown commented.
He said that class breaks and the
lunch hour were very popular times,
and admitted there was a problem
with so many people coming in at
once. The bank is currently training
additional staff in order to attempt to
alleviate the problem.
Brown said that it was difficult to
predict the "flow of people coming
in." He said he was especially surprised
about the activity level during dead
week and finals week, but said he later
realized that students needed money
for Christmas shopping and traveling
expenses.
Brown said that students could help
speed up the lines if they had their ID
cards ready, and if they would write
their address and phone number on
the check before getting to the
window.
The long lines have not been the
only problems the bank has
encountered. One student said that he

was billed incorrectly, being charged
for a service charge plus the three
dollar quarterly amount that he should
pay under the special student checking
plan.
Brown admitted that the "normal
computer errors" had been made, but
said he didn't bebeve many accounts
were affected. He added that the bank
was checking its records to see who
was affected by computer errors, and
would correct them.
"If there are any problems, we
want to know about them," said
Brown. "We'd like to improve our
service to keep everyone satisfied."

Brown estimated that the branch
has 2000 student checking and savings
accounts and 700 faculty accounts.
Convenience Appreciated
Students seem to appreciate the
convenience of the on-campus bank
and the predominent complaint
remains the long lines.
Freshman Judy Gonzalez said, "I
really like their service. At first I had
to wait quite a while to cash a check,
but the service has been improving."
Dave Thalheim, who has an account
there, agreed. "At first I was
displeased with the long lines, but
lately I have been satisfied."
