# Lewis Sees Vital China
## 
### NANCI COLVERT 
"I was deeply impressed with the
variety in Chinese society which runs
the full gamut of human experience.
Far from the grey sameness with
which Americans often characterize it,
it is a very vital society."
This sense of vigor and balance

between, and including, extremes is
the primary impression Political
Science Prof. John Lewis formed of
the People's Republic of China. He has
recently returned from the country
after a month long visit at the
invitation of the People's Institute of
Foreign Affairs.
Lewis, Vice Chairman of the
National Committee on U.S.-Chinese
Relations, was one of 14 members of
that group to tour eight cities of
China, and to meet with Chinese
peasants, scholars, students, and
government officials.
The group, comprised of prominent
political scientists, economists, and
China specialists, talked with most of
China's leading intellectuals — the
great philosophers, economists, and
sociologists who have recently
disappeared from the world scene, and
who are now experiencing less
freedom in contrast to the peasantry.
No VIP Meetings
"We did not meet with the top
leadership, I believe because of the
current U.S. resumption of the

bombing of North Vietnam.
"The bombing was never discussed
with us as a group, but as the only
anti-war activist, I was approached and
encouraged to continue to do this, but
not from the standpoint of, 'This is a
message from the Chinese people to
carry back to your country.' "
"The conflict in Vietnam is not
viewed as threatening to U.S.-China
relations," he said.
Bombing Not An Issue
"It was never made an issue of, and
in fact, we were quite surprised to
return to Hong Kong and discover how
great the damage had been and the
amount of worldwide opinion the
bombing had generated.
"This was just not the case in
China," he stated.
Lewis called the recent discussions,
"the most refreshing period of my
academic career," because of the
openness with which penetrating
questions were asked and answered on
all levels.
He observed a surprising difference
in the distribution of liberal thinking,
activism and creativity as compared to
U.S. society.
College Campuses 'Subdued'
"Whereas in the U.S., the college
campuses are the usual places for
liberalism, in China they are the most
subdued area of the society; the most
controlled, and the most cautious.
"The working classes, which are
traditionally conservative in America,
are the opposite in China, and they are
the people most in control of their
own fate.
"They are very enthusiastic and
feel, 'We are working hard and it is
paying off' as compared to students
who are subdued and uncertain of
what their degrees will mean," he said.
He called the people very well-fed,
with a "wonderful variety of truly
delightful food. We ate under all
circumstances imaginable.
"The important thing is not that
the people are well-fed, but its effect
on their society. There is much less of
the tension and aggression that was
present," he stated.
"Many of the concerns which used
to divide the Chinese and make them
do battle with each other have been
eliminated," he added.
"The people have made choice'
regarding the prominence of industrial
development, and they are very
self-conscious about them.

"There is a lot of pollution; most of
us got sick. But housing is adequate,"
he said.
"There are about as many different
feelings among the people towards
their government as you would expect
in any country," he said.
Lewis characterized two of the
eight cities as more tightly controlled
and security-conscious than the others
which were very open, but he would
not state which ones, and did not
know the reason for such control.
Although the Chinese are quite
proud of past cultural achievements,
Lewis found the supression of current
expression in the arts, depressing.
The group concentrated its study in
four specific areas — education,
government, finance and budgeting,
and rural economy. Although the two
governments conferred prior to the
visit regarding what the talks would
cover, the U.S. government had no
contact of any kind with the group
before it left.
The purpose of the trip was to
promote further exchanges of scholars,
students, sports and performing art
groups. Although no definite plans
were made, Lewis stated that he is
certain they will occur, and that the
trip served to initiate 4 the process to
normalize these relations.
Lewis observed the Chinese people
he met to be enthusiastic about the
renewal of the friendship between the
peoples of the two countries. He felt
that they consider cultural exchanges a
first stage in the building of relations
between the two governments.

expression in the arts, depressing.
The group concentrated its study in
four specific areas — education,
government, finance and budgeting,
and rural economy. Although the two
governments conferred prior to the
visit regarding what the talks would
cover, the U.S. government had no
contact of any kind with the group
before it left.
The purpose of the trip was to
promote further exchanges of scholars,
students, sports and performing art
groups. Although no definite plans
were made, Lewis stated that he is
certain they will occur, and that the
trip served to initiate 4 the process to
normalize these relations.
Lewis observed the Chinese people
he met to be enthusiastic about the
renewal of the friendship between the
peoples of the two countries. He felt
that they consider cultural exchanges a
first stage in the building of relations
between the two governments.
"I was deeply impressed with the
variety in Chinese society which runs
the full gamut of human experience.
Far from the grey sameness with
which Americans often characterize it,
it is a very vital society."
This sense of vigor and balance

between, and including, extremes is
the primary impression Political
Science Prof. John Lewis formed of
the People's Republic of China. He has
recently returned from the country
after a month long visit at the
invitation of the People's Institute of
Foreign Affairs.
Lewis, Vice Chairman of the
National Committee on U.S.-Chinese
Relations, was one of 14 members of
that group to tour eight cities of
China, and to meet with Chinese
peasants, scholars, students, and
government officials.
The group, comprised of prominent
political scientists, economists, and
China specialists, talked with most of
China's leading intellectuals — the
great philosophers, economists, and
sociologists who have recently
disappeared from the world scene, and
who are now experiencing less
freedom in contrast to the peasantry.
No VIP Meetings
"We did not meet with the top
leadership, I believe because of the
current U.S. resumption of the

bombing of North Vietnam.
"The bombing was never discussed
with us as a group, but as the only
anti-war activist, I was approached and
encouraged to continue to do this, but
not from the standpoint of, 'This is a
message from the Chinese people to
carry back to your country.' "
"The conflict in Vietnam is not
viewed as threatening to U.S.-China
relations," he said.
Bombing Not An Issue
"It was never made an issue of, and
in fact, we were quite surprised to
return to Hong Kong and discover how
great the damage had been and the
amount of worldwide opinion the
bombing had generated.
"This was just not the case in
China," he stated.
Lewis called the recent discussions,
"the most refreshing period of my
academic career," because of the
openness with which penetrating
questions were asked and answered on
all levels.
He observed a surprising difference
in the distribution of liberal thinking,
activism and creativity as compared to
U.S. society.
College Campuses 'Subdued'
"Whereas in the U.S., the college
campuses are the usual places for
liberalism, in China they are the most
subdued area of the society; the most
controlled, and the most cautious.
"The working classes, which are
traditionally conservative in America,
are the opposite in China, and they are
the people most in control of their
own fate.
"They are very enthusiastic and
feel, 'We are working hard and it is
paying off' as compared to students
who are subdued and uncertain of
what their degrees will mean," he said.
He called the people very well-fed,
with a "wonderful variety of truly
delightful food. We ate under all
circumstances imaginable.
"The important thing is not that
the people are well-fed, but its effect
on their society. There is much less of
the tension and aggression that was
present," he stated.
"Many of the concerns which used
to divide the Chinese and make them
do battle with each other have been
eliminated," he added.
"The people have made choice'
regarding the prominence of industrial
development, and they are very
self-conscious about them.

"There is a lot of pollution; most of
us got sick. But housing is adequate,"
he said.
"There are about as many different
feelings among the people towards
their government as you would expect
in any country," he said.
Lewis characterized two of the
eight cities as more tightly controlled
and security-conscious than the others
which were very open, but he would
not state which ones, and did not
know the reason for such control.

present," he stated.
"Many of the concerns which used
to divide the Chinese and make them
do battle with each other have been
eliminated," he added.
"The people have made choice'
regarding the prominence of industrial
development, and they are very
self-conscious about them.

"There is a lot of pollution; most of
us got sick. But housing is adequate,"
he said.
"There are about as many different
feelings among the people towards
their government as you would expect
in any country," he said.
Lewis characterized two of the
eight cities as more tightly controlled
and security-conscious than the others
which were very open, but he would
not state which ones, and did not
know the reason for such control.
Although the Chinese are quite
proud of past cultural achievements,
Lewis found the supression of current
expression in the arts, depressing.
The group concentrated its study in
four specific areas — education,
government, finance and budgeting,
and rural economy. Although the two
governments conferred prior to the
visit regarding what the talks would
cover, the U.S. government had no
contact of any kind with the group
before it left.
The purpose of the trip was to
promote further exchanges of scholars,
students, sports and performing art
groups. Although no definite plans
were made, Lewis stated that he is
certain they will occur, and that the
trip served to initiate 4 the process to
normalize these relations.
Lewis observed the Chinese people
he met to be enthusiastic about the
renewal of the friendship between the
peoples of the two countries. He felt
that they consider cultural exchanges a
first stage in the building of relations
between the two governments.
