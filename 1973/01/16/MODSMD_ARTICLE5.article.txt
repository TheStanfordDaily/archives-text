# Attempts At Unionization Decline Despite New Worker Interest
## 
### CHRISTY WISE 
Efforts to unionize Stanford
employees have declined since the
bargaining election of spring, 1972,
when workers voted against union
representation.
The vote, according to Emil Sarpa,
University Director of Personnel and
Employee Relations, was more a
protest against representation by the
Teamsters Union than a vote against
the principle of representation.
United Stanford Employees (USE)
have recently expressed interest in
unionization. Roland Finston, USE
Secertary, feels "USE may move for

an election." According to Finston,
contenders involved in last year's
election appear to have dropped out,
leaving it "up to USE to carry the
unionization responsibility."
A provision in the Taft-Hartley Act
requires a year between bargaining
elections, making April 19, 1973 the
earliest date Stanford workers can vote
for union representation.
The same provision requires an
11-month lapse between an election
and the filing of a petition for the
following election.
USE is presently increasing
membership and finances, both of

which are necessary "to run a
successful election campaign," stated
Finston.
Efforts to increase membership
include department-by-department
communication with workers,
distribution of a USE newspaper
publicizing working conditions, airing
issues of interest to workers,
recruitment of organizers to research
grievances, working conditions,
benefits and other related issues; and
continued concentration on individual
cases involving lay-offs, terminations
and classifications.
USE relies on membership dues for
financial support. According to
Finston, the group is "totally on
campus. We receive no outside
financial support."
Keith Stothers, steam fitter for
Plant Services, who was active in
Teamster unionization efforts last
spring stated, "Nobody from the
Teamsters has contacted me." He said
that he has not been aware of any
outcry from workers for the Teamsters
to become involved in unionization
again.
"I won't do anything until I see
that others (unions) arc," explained
Stothers. He added, "The Teamsters
spent a lot of money last year."
