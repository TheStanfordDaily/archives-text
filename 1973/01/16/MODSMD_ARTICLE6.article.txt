## Power To The People 
### 
Power failures are frequently creating crisis situations on this
campus. Last year, there were only a few failures, but in a little more
than one quarter this year, there have been at least eight major
blackouts.
Everyone realizes that these failures are always an inconvenience.
But power failures create many serious dangers as well. Consider
some of the following problems caused by blackouts.
Although a number of on-campus buildings including the Fire
Compound and the Hospital have emergency generators, Cowell
Health Center does not. Plant Services Director Dan DeYoung says he
will soon recommend that an auxiliary power system be provided for
Cowell in response to a request of Cowell Director James McClenahan.
Although people admit that the Cowell situation should be
rectified, action has noi been taken despite three months of frequent
and lengthy failures. Such inaction is inexcusable. McClenahan says
that patients are never placed in danger by the failures, but no facility
which treats ill persons should ever have to be without power for
several hours. The Fire Department has been providing emergency
portable power supply for Cowell, but this interim solution should
not be necessary. An auxiliary power supply should be installed as
soon as possible.
Every time there is a failure, the Fire Department has to respond to
approximately a dozen campus locations to reset "trouble bells."
Chief Frank Jurian says that the failures pose no threat to firefighting
abilities, but he admits that the more firemen and equipment are
exposed to traffic situations, the greater the risk of an accident. At
the very least, this is an incredible nuisance for the department and a
waste of time and safety.
Personal safety becomes an area of major concern with every
failure. A police spokesman admits that he "keeps his fingers crossed"
during each failure. Department of Public Safety Director Marvin
Herrington says that thefts in darkened buildings and dorms are his
biggest concern, but he adds that whenever a failure affects street
lights, the probability of traffic accidents and street crimes rises
sharply. People in the large campus buildings also face the danger of
falling down stairs and other accidents during a blackout.
A list of the problems created by failures could continue
indefinitely, but the biggest question is why have there been so many
failures? The Plant Services Department claims that all the failures are
related to cables, but still they can't stop the problem.
Reasons including prematurely worn-out cables and extremely
moist ground conditions have been frequently advanced, but still no
solution seems to have been found. DeYoung says that replacement of
all cables would not be the wisest course of action since many cables
can still handle many years of service.
DeYoung says that the problem is not one of finances or
manpower, but is one of judgment. He claims that the big problem is
deciding which cables to replace. DeYoung says that there is no real
pattern to the failures and this greatly complicates the solution.
We sympathize with DeYoung. But the situation has reached the
crisis stage and it cannot be tolerated any longer. The Plant Services
Department has been aware of the problem for three months and if
they cannot solve it in the very near future, outside consultants
should be hired immediately.
No one has to be reminded of the technological advances of recent
years. It is incredible that this problem should continue so long. The
University must act immediately to find an effective solution and
implement it without delay. No disasters have yet been caused by the
failures, but such luck can't continue indefinitely.
