# 'remove government control'
## Regulation Of Airwaves 
###

All of a sudden, liberals,
radicals, and other Right Thinkers
are asking, "Should the Nixon
administration try to control the
airwaves of the broadcast media?"
What they should be
asking—and what libertarians and
many conservatives have been
asking for years—is, "Should the
government, any government,
exercise any controls at all over
the broadcast media?"
At present, government control
of the airwaves manifests itself in
the form of the Federal
Communications Commission, a
.group of seven individuals of
varying degrees of experience in
the field who are appointed by
the President and who serve for
terms of seven years. In the past,
the FCC has not been noted as a
strong, innovative arm of the
State, but instead has been looked
upon by some as a wishy-washy
crew who largely serve the
purposes of the "vested interests"
and other betes noires of the
industry.
Inevitable Clash
This description is, at least in
one sense, true. For, when a
regulatory agency of the
government is established, it is the
tendency of the industry that is to
be regulated to attempt to co-opt
the regulator, in an effort to
forestall the inevitable clash
between private and so-called
"public" interests. This is only
natural: if you were a slave,
wouldn't you want to gain some
sort of leverage over your master
so that you could at least live
comfortably?
Such has been the case with
the FCC and the result has
worked against the interests of
consumers, in this case the
viewing or listening public. For,
bv gaining the ear and right hand
of the FCC, the large broadcasting
companies have been able to forge
a structure of immense superiority
over their competitors.
Liberals are becoming aware of
this, and are making elaborate
pleas that broadcasters become
more responsive to their listeners.
But their solution to this problem
of regulation is, as it always is,
more regulation. "Break up the
corrupt money-grubbing
networks!" "Subsidize the
television industry!" "Make the
industry serve the people!" All of

this, of course, would involve
direct or indirect coercion on the
part of the State apparatus.
Liberal Coercion
Advocacy of coercion is
nothing new in the liberal
repertoire, but the shocked
surprise at the potential for State
abuse of its control certainly is.
Whether the Nixon administration
really is out to quash its
opponents in the broadcast media
is highly questionable, but the
possibility of this and other
authoritarian practices has been
and always will be a grave threat
so long as any form of
government control in this field is
allowed to exist at all.
And the solution is not and can
not be more regulation. The
original Communications Act,
which granted Congress the right
to regulate the airwaves, was
conceived to be an example of
"good" regulation. But the
current alleged attempt to stifle
opposition, whether it has basis in
reality or not, is a prime example
of "good" regulation brought to
its logical conclusion. In short,
there is no "good" regulation.
If broadcast channels were
taken from the public, i.e.,
government domain, and sold to
the highest bidders, several things
would happen, all of which would
be beneficial.
First, the money received by
the State could be used for some
purpose more useful than
maintaining the present
communications bureaucracy.
Second, the control exercised by
the industry giants over their
ultimate authority would
disappear, because that authority
would disappear. Third, much
greater program diversity would
be offered because of the absence
of actual or threatened
government guidelines.
Fourth, those stations that do
not "serve the public," that is, do
not supply programming that is
desired by their audience, will
find themselves without listeners
or sponsors, and eager to change
or to sell out to those who do.
They will not be sustained
artificially by licenses which last
for a defined period of time, or by
pressure brought to bear on the
government by interest groups.
Fifth, the danger of totalitarian
control of the airwaves by the

State will be greatly reduced.
Oh yes, those stations which
are successful, which appeal to
their audiences and present
programming that meets the
wants and needs of their
communities, they will make a
profit. And if the word "profit"
does not make you cringe, then
perhaps you can understand that
economic and political freedom is
not only desirable but eminently
workable within the broadcast
industry as well as other activities
of man's life.
