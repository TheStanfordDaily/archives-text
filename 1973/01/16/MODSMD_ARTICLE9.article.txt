ASSU Article Flawed
Editor:
The article on last Tuesday's
meeting of the ASSU Senate
which appeared on the front page
of the next day's Daily under the
headline "Appel Proposes ASSU
Course Review Board" contains
several significant errors of fact
and interpretation.
For one thing, the proposed
amendment to the ASSU by-laws
referred to was drafted and
introduced by myself rather than
by Co-President Appel, although
he does support them strongly.
Secondly, the description of the
purpose of the Course Review
Policy Board to be established by
my proposal was both inaccurate
and misleading. A more accurate
statement would have been that it
"shall exercise general policy and
editorial control over the content
and publication of the ASSU
Course Review," including its
finances (I quote here from the

proposed by-law).
Specifically, it will not draw
from among its own membership
those who will do the actual work
of compiling and publishing the
Course Review, as was implied by
the Daily article. Nor will the
Course Review Board be
concerned only with the courses
offered last quarter; rather, jt is
envisioned as a permanent
organization which will continue
to publish a high-quality course
review in future years. The major
purpose of the proposed by-law,
in fact, was to establish the
institutional structure which will
enable the Course Review to carry
on from year to year with
maximum continuity and
continued ASSU funding.
The errors in the Daily article
were not confined to the subject
of the Course Review by-laws. I
found the report of the Senate
discussion concerning the
upcoming election incomplete,
primarily because it failed to

indicate the nature of the problem
of deciding under which system of
voting the election will be held.
The article also omitted all
mention of the appointments
which were made to the Senate's
Special Legislative Committee on
Tuition and the University
Budget. For the record, those
appointed were: David Levine
(chairman), Charles Ogletree
(deputy chairman), James
Anderson, Eric Hemel, John
Milstein, Walter Morris, John
Reed, Reginald Turner, and Elaine
Wong.
It is indeed unfortunate that the
Daily cannot maintain a
reasonable level of accuracy in its
reporting of ASSU affairs. The
ASSU has enough problems of its
own making in maintaining its
credibility with the students and
the University without having the
situation compounded by the
press.

ASSU Article Flawed
Editor:
The article on last Tuesday's
meeting of the ASSU Senate
which appeared on the front page
of the next day's Daily under the
headline "Appel Proposes ASSU
Course Review Board" contains
several significant errors of fact
and interpretation.
For one thing, the proposed
amendment to the ASSU by-laws
referred to was drafted and
introduced by myself rather than
by Co-President Appel, although
he does support them strongly.
Secondly, the description of the
purpose of the Course Review
Policy Board to be established by
my proposal was both inaccurate
and misleading. A more accurate
statement would have been that it
"shall exercise general policy and
editorial control over the content
and publication of the ASSU
Course Review," including its
finances (I quote here from the

proposed by-law).
Specifically, it will not draw
from among its own membership
those who will do the actual work
of compiling and publishing the
Course Review, as was implied by
the Daily article. Nor will the
Course Review Board be
concerned only with the courses
offered last quarter; rather, jt is
envisioned as a permanent
organization which will continue
to publish a high-quality course
review in future years. The major
purpose of the proposed by-law,
in fact, was to establish the
institutional structure which will
enable the Course Review to carry
on from year to year with
maximum continuity and
continued ASSU funding.
The errors in the Daily article
were not confined to the subject
of the Course Review by-laws. I
found the report of the Senate
discussion concerning the
upcoming election incomplete,
primarily because it failed to

indicate the nature of the problem
of deciding under which system of
voting the election will be held.
The article also omitted all
mention of the appointments
which were made to the Senate's
Special Legislative Committee on
Tuition and the University
Budget. For the record, those
appointed were: David Levine
(chairman), Charles Ogletree
(deputy chairman), James
Anderson, Eric Hemel, John
Milstein, Walter Morris, John
Reed, Reginald Turner, and Elaine
Wong.
It is indeed unfortunate that the
Daily cannot maintain a
reasonable level of accuracy in its
reporting of ASSU affairs. The
ASSU has enough problems of its
own making in maintaining its
credibility with the students and
the University without having the
situation compounded by the
press.
