# Escondido Residents' Committee Compiles Village Finance Report
## 
### CHRISTY WISE 
As a direct result of the November,
1972 seven percent room and board
increase, an ad hoc committee of
Escondido Village residents has
compiled a report assessing the current
financial position of the village and
outlining recommendations to assist
the Escondido Village Administration
in keeping costs, and rents, to a
minimum.
Escondido Village was hardest hit
by the Board of Trustees' decision, the
fifth in a consecutive round of rent
increases.
The committee, headed by William
S. Faught, J.A. Mac Donald and
Charles Williams, wrote the Escondido
Village Residents' Report on Rents
within the past week, upon
completion of their three month
investigation.
Financial Committee
The first and major
recommendation of the report is the
"formation of an official university
committee to participate in the
financial decision-making process of
Escondido Village."
According to Faught, once this
committee is formed, "It can push for
implementation of the
recommendations rather than our ad
hoc committee working from the
outside."
The second recommendation is for
application of the Budget Adjustment
Program to the Escondido Village
budget on "a continuing basis in a

similar manner as for academic
departments, with mandatory
reduction in expenditures as
required."
The committee's third
recommendation is for a "moratorium
on high-rise apartment construction."
The report outlines the high
construction cost and high interest
rate involved in recent expansion of
the Village. "Increment Four's
high-rise buildings, Quillen and
Blackwelder, account for a
disproportionate amount of the
expansion costs. The construction of
Quillen and Blackwelder was a
financial mistake," states the report.
Related to the cost impact of
Increment Four are the
recommendations that "since the
village is being used to alleviate the
dormitory shortage, the Office of
Residences and Fraternities should
assume the financial burden of a
high-rise," and "endowment support
in Increment Four's debt service
should be encouraged to relieve
financial pressure on the Village."
No More Construction
The sixth recommendation is for
"no further construction until such
time as the following criteria have
been satisfied: a) There must be a
legitimate need for the construction,
b) The expansion will not cause a
financial burden on the residents of
the Village."
The final recommendation is for a
"continuous program of

communication from the Escondido
Village Administration to the residents
on financial matters via 1) A detailed
annual report on operations affecting
current, past, and projected
expenditures, in a form readily
understandable by persons without
formal financial training; and 2) Other
periodic reports announcing and
explaining proposed capital outlays,
renovation programs, significant

unexpected expenses, and drastic
changes in financial policy. The
purpose of these reports is to stimulate
resident input at the planning stage
before decisions have been made."
The report suggested that planning
costs be reduced and observed that,
"the advantages of more rapid entry
into the village due to these additional
apartments are rapidly being offset by

SOLICITING INFORMATION — President Richard Lyman last night asked
interested students to send letters articulating their reaction to the report of the
Commission for Review of Overseas Campuses to the President's Office or to
Provost William Miller. Lyman said speculation that the report signalled the end
of the overseas program was "vastly premature" at the least. He also noted that
he "wouldn't be surprised if something resembling the present system persisted."
