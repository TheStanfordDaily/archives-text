KZSU Article Corrected

Editor:
In the article about KZSU that
appeared in the Daily on Jan. 11,
there were two factual errors that
I would like to correct.
The first of the errors was
mainly due to my own
misinformation. The article stated
that in the spring of 1970, KZSU
was cited for over 400 violations
of the rules and regulations of the
Federal Communications
Commission, and it was implied in
the article that these were major
violations as a result of obscene
lyrics to songs that were played.
Actually, KZSU was cited for
about 25 violations (that was my
error), stemming from our
coverage of the spring riots.
The second error concerned a
letter that Stanford received from
the FCCâ€”the article stated that a
letter was sent in 1959 asking that
KZSU be shut down, and that the
administration ignored the
request. Actually, at that time
KZSU existed only as an AM
carrier current system. All that
the FCC says about carrier current
systems is that they shouldn't
radiate the radio waves into the
air very far.
In 1958 KZSU-AM was guilty
of gross violations of that
regulation, and the FCC sent a
letter requesting that the Stanford
administration take KZSU off the

air until the station could satisfy
that regulation. The University
complied, and KZSU was shut
down during the year 1958-59. In
1959 the station returned to
carrier current operation, having
made the necessary changes. It
was not. until 1964 that KZSU
was granted a license to broadcast
on FM.
Thank you for your help in
bringing these corrections to the
attention of your readers.

Editor:
Thank you for the column of
Jan. 9, 1973 entitled "Ignoring
the Past." We hope you will
follow this up with a detailed
biographical sketch of both Army
Col. Javits, N.Y.U. Law School,
Class of 1926, and Army National
Guard Col. Saxbe, Ohio State Law
School, Class of 1948. Maybe
their Commander-in-Chief, Mr.
Nixon, knows details of their
histories that you could make
available for the understanding of
your readers.
