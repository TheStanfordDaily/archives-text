## 'Behavior Change Project Hurts Chicanos' 
### 
chicano graduate students

The School of Medicine and
the Department of
Communication at Stanford are
engaged in a joint research project
(Project SCOR) that is harmful to
the Chicano community. A
seven-year, $4.3 million heart
research-behavior change project
is designed to formulate a more
precise model for changing
behavior by means of carefully
designed and controlled mass
media campaigns. Though the
present research focus is on health
issues, the behavior modification
design of this research poses
serious ethical and political
questions that range beyond the
present study. In this context, the
potential benefit derived by the
Chicano community is minimized
by the serious threat posed by this
behavior change research.
BEHAVIOR CHANGE: All
three target communities selected

for this research have substantial
Chicano populations. A specially
designed component has been
introduced to the overall design to
investigate the Chicano
community as a distinct
sub-sample. This addition to the
research design allows a careful
examination of the variables
which yield more effective
behavior change among Chicanos.
This research component is thus
an ethical and political issue to
Chicanos.
Both the practice and research
of behavior modification on
unknowing human subjects has
been broadly criticized by
advocates of individual freedom.
B.F. Skinner's recent book,
Beyond Freedom and Dignity has
triggered a new round in this
controversy. There is however an
additional dimension to this
research project that must be

taken into account. The
consequences of producing
knowledge that renders more
effective means of producing
behavior changes on a vulnerable
and struggling minority
community are far more serious
than for a community that has
certain legal, political and
economic resources with which to
fend for itself. In the context of a
community struggling for access
to these legal, political and
economic rights, the potential for
misuse and abuse of behavior
change knowledge poses a serious
threat.
Manipulation and Deceit
Behavior change knowledge,
unlike other forms of knowledge
that may serve beneficial or
harmful ends, has a greater
potential for misuse and abuse.
The threat of manipulation and
deceit is not a false issue. It is an
everyday reality. Attempts to
manipulate and deceive the
Chicano barrios are ever present.
Further, Chicanos, like other
minority communities, are
constantly subjected to social
control by outside institutions
such as police, schools, legislators,
mass media, social workers, etc.
These practitioners of social
control stand as willing recipients
of new techniques for extending
their control over Chicanos.
SCOPE OF THE RESEARCH
PROJECT: This project is
designed as an experimental
data-gathering and analysis
activity. Further, it defines its
concern as four domains related
to heart disease; 1. smoking,
2. diet, 3. body weight and
4. physical activity (i.e. exercise).
A ten-month media campaign in
the three small, rural target
communities (Tracy, Gilroy and
Watsonville) will be aimed at
inducing change in these four
domains.
The researchers content
themselves with the belief that
their research will be of great
benefit to the Chicano
community because their research
findings may help reduce heart
disease among Chicanos. SCOR
will diagnose its subjects for signs
of heart illness. The treatment
afforded these subjects will be a
media campaign. Changes in
behavior patterns in the four
domains related to heart disease
(listed prior) are expected to
occur . . . hence the treatment will
be completed.
It is unfortunate that at a time
in which the health problems of
the Chicano community are
coming to greater public
attention, programs to meet the
special needs of this community
are not forthcoming. However,
research projects like SCOR with
very narrow and egocentric
definitions of the community's
health problems fail to provide
vitally needed medical services.
The primary concern oC SCOR is
the success of the project.
Research Objectives
Success is thus defined as
significant behavior change among
its experimental subjects. The
health problems of the
community are important only if
they fall within the research
objectives of the project.
Often the health of rural

Chicanos suffers from neither diet
or exercise related causes alone.
Lack of income for adequate diets
and medical care are major
factors. Rural Chicanos nationally
have a median family income of
under $3,000 per year. The
gruelling physical labor that men,
women and children must engage
in to earn a subsistence income
leaves no doubt that they get
plenty of exercise. Further, the
anxiety and stress associated with
these living conditions is a major
mental health problem. Thus
behavior modification in this
instance is merely a tactic to
accommodate rural Chicanos to
the poverty, misery and
exploitation and ignore the major
cause of their health problems.
ACADEMIC MERCENARIES:
This research project defines its
scope in such a way as to ignore
the economic and political
realities of Chicanos in the target
communities. This is common
practice among researchers. They
are mute to the political,
economic and ethical implications
of their research. They cloak their
amoral and apolitical stance
behind the rhetoric of value-free
research and pure
research—themselves value-laden
positions. This form of self-deceit
allows researchers to ignore all
conditions that do not fall within
the narrow scope of their research
objectives. The rationale for their
research is thus laid.
Minimal Gains
This form of self-interest is not
unknown in Chicano
communities. Countless research
projects have been done in
Chicano barrios. Enormous
expenditures of money, time and
energy have been made. The
researchers have gained superb
salaries, met degree requirements,
gained research experience and
often produced numerous articles.
The gains to the Chicano barrio
are meager, almost always
unintended residual benefits.

Once again, the Chicano
community is being studied; once
again the researchers will take
much more from the community
than they put back into it. SCOR
is no exception!
During spring quarter (1972),
the Chicano graduate students in
communication decided not to
cooperate with SCOR after
serious and careful consideration.
The SCOR researchers
administrators sought to
circumvent the issues posed by
their research and tried to enlist
the support of Chicanos from
outside the area by distorting and
misrepresenting the nature of the
project. These researchers
administrators are thus guilty of
deceit and manipulation—a ploy
common to bureaucrats and
politicians who seek to perpetuate
their own ends at any expense.
For this reason, we can no longer
simply maintain a position of
non-cooperation. We must now
actively struggle against SCOR.
—We demand that the Chicano
component of SCOR be dissolved
and that its Chicano personnel be
absorbed by the overall project.
—We demand a public
disclosure of the budget, research
design and data gathered for this
component.
—We solicit the support of all
faculty and students of conscience
to not participate in any way with
project SCOR Chicano
component and to assist us in
dissuading any support for the
project from the academic
community.
—We solicit the support and
cooperation of all present SCOR
personnel working on the Chicano
component and ask that you
demand a transfer out of this
component.
—We welcome the opportunity
to address any faculty or student
group and professional association
to further discuss our position.

constantly subjected to social
control by outside institutions
such as police, schools, legislators,
mass media, social workers, etc.
These practitioners of social
control stand as willing recipients
of new techniques for extending
their control over Chicanos.
SCOPE OF THE RESEARCH
PROJECT: This project is
designed as an experimental
data-gathering and analysis
activity. Further, it defines its
concern as four domains related
to heart disease; 1. smoking,
2. diet, 3. body weight and
4. physical activity (i.e. exercise).
A ten-month media campaign in
the three small, rural target
communities (Tracy, Gilroy and
Watsonville) will be aimed at
inducing change in these four
domains.
The researchers content
themselves with the belief that
their research will be of great
benefit to the Chicano
community because their research
findings may help reduce heart
disease among Chicanos. SCOR
will diagnose its subjects for signs
of heart illness. The treatment
afforded these subjects will be a
media campaign. Changes in
behavior patterns in the four
domains related to heart disease
(listed prior) are expected to
occur . . . hence the treatment will
be completed.
It is unfortunate that at a time
in which the health problems of
the Chicano community are
coming to greater public
attention, programs to meet the
special needs of this community
are not forthcoming. However,
research projects like SCOR with
very narrow and egocentric
definitions of the community's
health problems fail to provide
vitally needed medical services.
The primary concern oC SCOR is
the success of the project.
Research Objectives
Success is thus defined as
significant behavior change among
its experimental subjects. The
health problems of the
community are important only if
they fall within the research
objectives of the project.
Often the health of rural

Chicanos suffers from neither diet
or exercise related causes alone.
Lack of income for adequate diets
and medical care are major
factors. Rural Chicanos nationally
have a median family income of
under $3,000 per year. The
gruelling physical labor that men,
women and children must engage
in to earn a subsistence income
leaves no doubt that they get
plenty of exercise. Further, the
anxiety and stress associated with
these living conditions is a major
mental health problem. Thus
behavior modification in this
instance is merely a tactic to
accommodate rural Chicanos to
the poverty, misery and
exploitation and ignore the major
cause of their health problems.
ACADEMIC MERCENARIES:
This research project defines its
scope in such a way as to ignore
the economic and political
realities of Chicanos in the target
communities. This is common
practice among researchers. They
are mute to the political,
economic and ethical implications
of their research. They cloak their
amoral and apolitical stance
behind the rhetoric of value-free
research and pure
research—themselves value-laden
positions. This form of self-deceit
allows researchers to ignore all
conditions that do not fall within
the narrow scope of their research
objectives. The rationale for their
research is thus laid.
Minimal Gains
This form of self-interest is not
unknown in Chicano
communities. Countless research
projects have been done in
Chicano barrios. Enormous
expenditures of money, time and
energy have been made. The
researchers have gained superb
salaries, met degree requirements,
gained research experience and
often produced numerous articles.
The gains to the Chicano barrio
are meager, almost always
unintended residual benefits.

Once again, the Chicano
community is being studied; once
again the researchers will take
much more from the community
than they put back into it. SCOR
is no exception!
During spring quarter (1972),
the Chicano graduate students in
communication decided not to
cooperate with SCOR after
serious and careful consideration.
The SCOR researchers
administrators sought to
circumvent the issues posed by
their research and tried to enlist
the support of Chicanos from
outside the area by distorting and
misrepresenting the nature of the
project. These researchers
administrators are thus guilty of
deceit and manipulation—a ploy
common to bureaucrats and
politicians who seek to perpetuate
their own ends at any expense.
For this reason, we can no longer
simply maintain a position of
non-cooperation. We must now
actively struggle against SCOR.
—We demand that the Chicano
component of SCOR be dissolved
and that its Chicano personnel be
absorbed by the overall project.
—We demand a public
disclosure of the budget, research
design and data gathered for this
component.
—We solicit the support of all
faculty and students of conscience
to not participate in any way with
project SCOR Chicano
component and to assist us in
dissuading any support for the
project from the academic
community.
—We solicit the support and
cooperation of all present SCOR
personnel working on the Chicano
component and ask that you
demand a transfer out of this
component.
—We welcome the opportunity
to address any faculty or student
group and professional association
to further discuss our position.

The School of Medicine and
the Department of
Communication at Stanford are
engaged in a joint research project
(Project SCOR) that is harmful to
the Chicano community. A
seven-year, $4.3 million heart
research-behavior change project
is designed to formulate a more
precise model for changing
behavior by means of carefully
designed and controlled mass
media campaigns. Though the
present research focus is on health
issues, the behavior modification
design of this research poses
serious ethical and political
questions that range beyond the
present study. In this context, the
potential benefit derived by the
Chicano community is minimized
by the serious threat posed by this
behavior change research.
BEHAVIOR CHANGE: All
three target communities selected

for this research have substantial
Chicano populations. A specially
designed component has been
introduced to the overall design to
investigate the Chicano
community as a distinct
sub-sample. This addition to the
research design allows a careful
examination of the variables
which yield more effective
behavior change among Chicanos.
This research component is thus
an ethical and political issue to
Chicanos.
Both the practice and research
of behavior modification on
unknowing human subjects has
been broadly criticized by
advocates of individual freedom.
B.F. Skinner's recent book,
Beyond Freedom and Dignity has
triggered a new round in this
controversy. There is however an
additional dimension to this
research project that must be

taken into account. The
consequences of producing
knowledge that renders more
effective means of producing
behavior changes on a vulnerable
and struggling minority
community are far more serious
than for a community that has
certain legal, political and
economic resources with which to
fend for itself. In the context of a
community struggling for access
to these legal, political and
economic rights, the potential for
misuse and abuse of behavior
change knowledge poses a serious
threat.
Manipulation and Deceit
Behavior change knowledge,
unlike other forms of knowledge
that may serve beneficial or
harmful ends, has a greater
potential for misuse and abuse.
The threat of manipulation and
deceit is not a false issue. It is an
everyday reality. Attempts to
manipulate and deceive the
Chicano barrios are ever present.
Further, Chicanos, like other
minority communities, are
constantly subjected to social
control by outside institutions

behavior modification in this
instance is merely a tactic to
accommodate rural Chicanos to
the poverty, misery and
exploitation and ignore the major
cause of their health problems.
ACADEMIC MERCENARIES:
This research project defines its
scope in such a way as to ignore
the economic and political
realities of Chicanos in the target
communities. This is common
practice among researchers. They
are mute to the political,
economic and ethical implications
of their research. They cloak their
amoral and apolitical stance
behind the rhetoric of value-free
research and pure
research—themselves value-laden
positions. This form of self-deceit
allows researchers to ignore all
conditions that do not fall within
the narrow scope of their research
objectives. The rationale for their
research is thus laid.
Minimal Gains
This form of self-interest is not
unknown in Chicano
communities. Countless research
projects have been done in
Chicano barrios. Enormous
expenditures of money, time and
energy have been made. The
researchers have gained superb
salaries, met degree requirements,
gained research experience and
often produced numerous articles.
The gains to the Chicano barrio
are meager, almost always
unintended residual benefits.

Once again, the Chicano
community is being studied; once
again the researchers will take
much more from the community
than they put back into it. SCOR
is no exception!
During spring quarter (1972),
the Chicano graduate students in
communication decided not to
cooperate with SCOR after
serious and careful consideration.
The SCOR researchers
administrators sought to
circumvent the issues posed by
their research and tried to enlist
the support of Chicanos from
outside the area by distorting and
misrepresenting the nature of the
project. These researchers
administrators are thus guilty of
deceit and manipulation—a ploy
common to bureaucrats and
politicians who seek to perpetuate
their own ends at any expense.
For this reason, we can no longer
simply maintain a position of
non-cooperation. We must now
actively struggle against SCOR.
—We demand that the Chicano
component of SCOR be dissolved
and that its Chicano personnel be
absorbed by the overall project.
—We demand a public
disclosure of the budget, research
design and data gathered for this
component.
—We solicit the support of all
faculty and students of conscience
to not participate in any way with
project SCOR Chicano
component and to assist us in
dissuading any support for the
project from the academic
community.
—We solicit the support and
cooperation of all present SCOR
personnel working on the Chicano
component and ask that you
demand a transfer out of this
component.
—We welcome the opportunity
to address any faculty or student
group and professional association
to further discuss our position.

The School of Medicine and
the Department of
Communication at Stanford are
engaged in a joint research project
(Project SCOR) that is harmful to
the Chicano community. A
seven-year, $4.3 million heart
research-behavior change project
is designed to formulate a more
precise model for changing
behavior by means of carefully
designed and controlled mass
media campaigns. Though the
present research focus is on health
issues, the behavior modification
design of this research poses
serious ethical and political
questions that range beyond the
present study. In this context, the
potential benefit derived by the
Chicano community is minimized
by the serious threat posed by this
behavior change research.
BEHAVIOR CHANGE: All
three target communities selected

for this research have substantial
Chicano populations. A specially
designed component has been
introduced to the overall design to
investigate the Chicano
community as a distinct
sub-sample. This addition to the
research design allows a careful
examination of the variables
which yield more effective
behavior change among Chicanos.
This research component is thus
an ethical and political issue to
Chicanos.
Both the practice and research
of behavior modification on
unknowing human subjects has
been broadly criticized by
advocates of individual freedom.
B.F. Skinner's recent book,
Beyond Freedom and Dignity has
triggered a new round in this
controversy. There is however an
additional dimension to this
research project that must be

taken into account. The
consequences of producing
knowledge that renders more
effective means of producing
behavior changes on a vulnerable
and struggling minority
community are far more serious
than for a community that has
certain legal, political and
economic resources with which to
fend for itself. In the context of a
community struggling for access
to these legal, political and
economic rights, the potential for
misuse and abuse of behavior
change knowledge poses a serious
threat.
Manipulation and Deceit
Behavior change knowledge,
unlike other forms of knowledge
that may serve beneficial or
harmful ends, has a greater
potential for misuse and abuse.
The threat of manipulation and
deceit is not a false issue. It is an
everyday reality. Attempts to
manipulate and deceive the
Chicano barrios are ever present.
Further, Chicanos, like other
minority communities, are
constantly subjected to social
control by outside institutions
such as police, schools, legislators,
mass media, social workers, etc.
These practitioners of social
control stand as willing recipients
of new techniques for extending
their control over Chicanos.
SCOPE OF THE RESEARCH
PROJECT: This project is
designed as an experimental
data-gathering and analysis
activity. Further, it defines its
concern as four domains related
to heart disease; 1. smoking,
2. diet, 3. body weight and
4. physical activity (i.e. exercise).
A ten-month media campaign in
the three small, rural target
communities (Tracy, Gilroy and
Watsonville) will be aimed at
inducing change in these four
domains.
The researchers content
themselves with the belief that
their research will be of great
benefit to the Chicano
community because their research
findings may help reduce heart
disease among Chicanos. SCOR
will diagnose its subjects for signs
of heart illness. The treatment
afforded these subjects will be a
media campaign. Changes in
behavior patterns in the four
domains related to heart disease
(listed prior) are expected to
occur . . . hence the treatment will
be completed.
It is unfortunate that at a time
in which the health problems of
the Chicano community are
coming to greater public
attention, programs to meet the
special needs of this community
are not forthcoming. However,
research projects like SCOR with
very narrow and egocentric
definitions of the community's
health problems fail to provide
vitally needed medical services.
The primary concern oC SCOR is
the success of the project.
Research Objectives
Success is thus defined as
significant behavior change among
its experimental subjects. The
health problems of the
community are important only if
they fall within the research
objectives of the project.
Often the health of rural

Chicanos suffers from neither diet
or exercise related causes alone.
Lack of income for adequate diets
and medical care are major
factors. Rural Chicanos nationally
have a median family income of
under $3,000 per year. The
gruelling physical labor that men,
women and children must engage
in to earn a subsistence income
leaves no doubt that they get
plenty of exercise. Further, the
anxiety and stress associated with
these living conditions is a major
mental health problem. Thus
behavior modification in this
instance is merely a tactic to
accommodate rural Chicanos to
the poverty, misery and
exploitation and ignore the major
cause of their health problems.

The School of Medicine and
the Department of
Communication at Stanford are
engaged in a joint research project
(Project SCOR) that is harmful to
the Chicano community. A
seven-year, $4.3 million heart
research-behavior change project
is designed to formulate a more
precise model for changing
behavior by means of carefully
designed and controlled mass
media campaigns. Though the
present research focus is on health
issues, the behavior modification
design of this research poses
serious ethical and political
questions that range beyond the
present study. In this context, the
potential benefit derived by the
Chicano community is minimized
by the serious threat posed by this
behavior change research.
BEHAVIOR CHANGE: All
three target communities selected

for this research have substantial
Chicano populations. A specially
designed component has been
introduced to the overall design to
investigate the Chicano
community as a distinct
sub-sample. This addition to the
research design allows a careful
examination of the variables
which yield more effective
behavior change among Chicanos.
This research component is thus
an ethical and political issue to
Chicanos.
Both the practice and research
of behavior modification on
unknowing human subjects has
been broadly criticized by
advocates of individual freedom.
B.F. Skinner's recent book,
Beyond Freedom and Dignity has
triggered a new round in this
controversy. There is however an
additional dimension to this
research project that must be

taken into account. The
consequences of producing
knowledge that renders more
effective means of producing
behavior changes on a vulnerable
and struggling minority
community are far more serious
than for a community that has
certain legal, political and
economic resources with which to
fend for itself. In the context of a
community struggling for access
to these legal, political and
economic rights, the potential for
misuse and abuse of behavior
change knowledge poses a serious
threat.
Manipulation and Deceit
Behavior change knowledge,
unlike other forms of knowledge
that may serve beneficial or
harmful ends, has a greater
potential for misuse and abuse.
The threat of manipulation and
deceit is not a false issue. It is an
everyday reality. Attempts to
manipulate and deceive the
Chicano barrios are ever present.
Further, Chicanos, like other
minority communities, are
constantly subjected to social
control by outside institutions
such as police, schools, legislators,
mass media, social workers, etc.
These practitioners of social
control stand as willing recipients
of new techniques for extending
their control over Chicanos.
SCOPE OF THE RESEARCH
PROJECT: This project is
designed as an experimental
data-gathering and analysis
activity. Further, it defines its
concern as four domains related
to heart disease; 1. smoking,
2. diet, 3. body weight and
4. physical activity (i.e. exercise).
A ten-month media campaign in
the three small, rural target
communities (Tracy, Gilroy and
Watsonville) will be aimed at
inducing change in these four
domains.
The researchers content
themselves with the belief that
their research will be of great
benefit to the Chicano
community because their research
findings may help reduce heart
disease among Chicanos. SCOR
will diagnose its subjects for signs
of heart illness. The treatment
afforded these subjects will be a
media campaign. Changes in
behavior patterns in the four
domains related to heart disease
(listed prior) are expected to
occur . . . hence the treatment will
be completed.
It is unfortunate that at a time
in which the health problems of
the Chicano community are
coming to greater public
attention, programs to meet the
special needs of this community
are not forthcoming. However,
research projects like SCOR with
very narrow and egocentric
definitions of the community's
health problems fail to provide
vitally needed medical services.
The primary concern oC SCOR is
the success of the project.
Research Objectives
Success is thus defined as
significant behavior change among
its experimental subjects. The
health problems of the
community are important only if
they fall within the research
objectives of the project.
Often the health of rural

Chicanos suffers from neither diet
or exercise related causes alone.
Lack of income for adequate diets
and medical care are major
factors. Rural Chicanos nationally
have a median family income of
under $3,000 per year. The
gruelling physical labor that men,
women and children must engage
in to earn a subsistence income
leaves no doubt that they get
plenty of exercise. Further, the
anxiety and stress associated with
these living conditions is a major
mental health problem. Thus
behavior modification in this
instance is merely a tactic to
accommodate rural Chicanos to
the poverty, misery and
exploitation and ignore the major
cause of their health problems.
ACADEMIC MERCENARIES:
This research project defines its
scope in such a way as to ignore
the economic and political
realities of Chicanos in the target
communities. This is common
practice among researchers. They
are mute to the political,
economic and ethical implications
of their research. They cloak their
amoral and apolitical stance
behind the rhetoric of value-free
research and pure
research—themselves value-laden
positions. This form of self-deceit
allows researchers to ignore all
conditions that do not fall within
the narrow scope of their research
objectives. The rationale for their
research is thus laid.
Minimal Gains
This form of self-interest is not
unknown in Chicano
communities. Countless research
projects have been done in
Chicano barrios. Enormous
expenditures of money, time and
energy have been made. The
researchers have gained superb
salaries, met degree requirements,
gained research experience and
often produced numerous articles.
The gains to the Chicano barrio
are meager, almost always
unintended residual benefits.

Once again, the Chicano
community is being studied; once
again the researchers will take
much more from the community
than they put back into it. SCOR
is no exception!
During spring quarter (1972),
the Chicano graduate students in
communication decided not to
cooperate with SCOR after
serious and careful consideration.
The SCOR researchers
administrators sought to
circumvent the issues posed by
their research and tried to enlist
the support of Chicanos from
outside the area by distorting and
misrepresenting the nature of the
project. These researchers
administrators are thus guilty of
deceit and manipulation—a ploy
common to bureaucrats and
politicians who seek to perpetuate
their own ends at any expense.
For this reason, we can no longer
simply maintain a position of
non-cooperation. We must now
actively struggle against SCOR.
—We demand that the Chicano
component of SCOR be dissolved
and that its Chicano personnel be
absorbed by the overall project.
—We demand a public
disclosure of the budget, research
design and data gathered for this
component.
—We solicit the support of all
faculty and students of conscience
to not participate in any way with
project SCOR Chicano
component and to assist us in
dissuading any support for the
project from the academic
community.
—We solicit the support and
cooperation of all present SCOR
personnel working on the Chicano
component and ask that you
demand a transfer out of this
component.
—We welcome the opportunity
to address any faculty or student
group and professional association
to further discuss our position.
