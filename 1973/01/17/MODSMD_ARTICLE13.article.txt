## Desiccated Peckinpah 
### ELLEN KENESHEA 
Given the chance, it's a better idea to see or
re-see Sam Peckinpah's old film "The Wild Bunch"
than his new one, 'The Getaway." "The Wild
Bunch" is at the least a masterpiece of a western,
and the case could be made that it's more than that.
A fine, gripping film, "The Wild Bunch" cuts to the
quick. It is a worthy successor to "Ride the High
Country," an earlier Peckinpah film and a smaller,
more gently compelling one.
"The Getaway" is not a bad film—it has its
moments—but it isn't a very clear or noteworthy
one, and it doesn't look as though Peckinpah took
much care with it.
If Peckinpah never had novel ideas—how many
directors do?—he did have creative ways of putting
revamped ideas on the screen to make them seem
fresh and provocative. But "The Getaway" is not
only a re-make of some old Peckinpah thoughts, but
of his methods, and the re-make just doesn't
compare to the original.
"The Getaway" has a simple plot, although it
sometimes becomes muddled in the viewing. Bank
robber Doc McCoy (Steve McQueen), and his wife
Carol (Ali MacGraw), rob a bank with two other
men and head for the Mexican border with the
money. In between, the money is lost and found,
people are double-crossed and killed, picked up and
dropped, and Doc and Carol fight and make up.
Married Murderers
McQueen and Macgraw basically play a happily
married pair-good kids in spite of the fact that
they're both murderers. McQueen is more believable
as a killer than as a shy husband. MacGraw is not
believable as anything except possibly the heroine
of "Love Story," which amounts to not being
believable.
Sally Struthers seems much more at home in the
film as a frustrated wife who decides to play tramp
to A 1 Lettieri's cold-blooded professional killer.
Struthers plays an empty-headed version of the wife

in Peckinpah's "Straw Dogs." Both represent
women for whom sex and violence are inextricably
mixed, a feminine trait running through the line of
Peckinpali's films.
Sex seldom appears in Peckinpah's films without
attendant violence and degradation. So that
McQueen and MacGraw can remain likeable, their
embraces are so tentative as to be quite virginal.
They are a modest pair (she won't let him in the
bathroom while she's showering), and have a
passionless relationship, leading one to suspect that
Peckinpah has a real fear of passionate loving, at
least in his films.
Dry to Distressing
As Doc, McQueen acts more drily than usual,
although he breathes out a small laugh now and
then in just the right places. By contrast, Struthers
and Lettieri seem almost too ripe and full of too
many movements. MacGraw is just distressing.
Lucien Ballard photographs in sharp and clear
tones as usual. But the violence in slow motion, so
integral to "The Wild Bunch," and part of what that
film was all about, seems redundant in 'The
Getaway." Here, rather than being at one with the
film and its themes, Peckinpah uses the violence as
just something to fall back on.
The slow motion lyricism that pops up in the
film is even less agreeable than the violence.
Peckinpah has always been a romantic, liking
granite-jawed men who die for their beliefs, like
whatever monumental men that have fit a mythic
west.
"The Getaway" unfortunately combines trite
cynicism ("This is what I believe in," says McQueen,
fondling a pile of money) and sloshy sentimentality.
To be fair, the film is also competent and slick,
and better than run-of-the-mill fare; but it's
desiccated Peckinpah. He has made films of love,
strength and vigour and far better than this one.
One can only hope that some day he finds his way
back to such films.
