# 'Dance Of Death'
## Oliver Creates Faulty Strindberg 
### JEFFREY SEGAL 
When a contemporary director
chooses to do a play from another
period, he must decide whether
his interpretation is going to
present the play as the author and
audience of that period saw it,
with the hopes that the audience
will react to it today as they did
before, or to interpret it in the
light of the current culture, and
make a statement for today at the
risk of losing the original meaning.
William Oliver, a professor at
U.C.-Berkeley and the director of
the Berkeley Repertory Theater
production of Strindberg's play,
"The Dance of Death," has
chosen to interpret the play as if
it were written in a contemporary
context. His approach results in
an interesting but flawed
production.
In a recent article in the San
Francisco Chronicle, Oliver
condemns the "traditional
interpretation" of the play as a
tragedy or tragicomedy, and
asserts that it is a "grimly
affirmative play, and it is a funny
play .. . amusing and grotesque."
He also asserts that the play is a
metaphysical before a
psychological study.
May Miss Theme
A contemporary audience
might well indeed miss the main
theme of this play—the
irreconcilable conflicts between
the animal natures of man and
woman, and the living hell they
create in marriage—if the director
chooses to stress those elements
akin to absurdish drama like
repetition, cyclic time,
contrapuntal dialogue, mime, and
pause, and to direct the comedy
in the play with the abrupt
contrast of farce.
The director is then no longer
saying what the author had to say
the way he wanted to say it. Just
because Pastor Manders in Ibsen's
"Ghosts" could be a comic
character if an actor wrongly
played up his dated moral
convictions, does not mean that
he has to play it that way, that
Ibsen ever wanted it to be so, or
that the play has equal
significance divorced from its
background and viewed strictly in

a modern light.
"Dance of Death" occurs on a
remote military outpost, an island
called Little Hell, where a couple
married for twenty-five miserable
years continue to torment each
other perpetually as an alternative
to interminable ennui.
Marriage Shackles
Love, expressed perversely as
unavoidable duty, holds them
each other's prisoner, shackled by
marriage. The Captain, a loud,
blustering, petty bully views his
personal and professional realities
through the illusuory grandeur of
his dreams; he experiences
recurrent fits of apoplexy that
each time come close to killing
him.
His wife, Alice, sits waiting
anxiously for an attack to do him
in; she plays the piano in
accompaniment to his favorite
sword dance in the hopes that
those steps will put an end to the
continual dance of death that is
their lives.
They repeat the same steps
every day. They pray that the end
of the music will mean their
release. Strindberg, however, is
not optimistic. He himself had
three unsuccessful marriages
which prompted him to assert
that marriage is only an overture
to the hell beyond, if there even is
an end to earthly torment in sight.
New Arrival
Onto this emotional battlefield
charged with hate and frustration
arrives a man who has come to the
base to be quarantine master,
Kurt, an old friend of the
Captain and cousin to Alice. His
innocence is corrupted and moral
fibre destroyed when he is sucked
into the vortex of their evil. The
Captain and Alice each tries to use
him as a weapon against the other.
Ron Vernan plays the
aggressive, calculating Captain.
Although Vernan shows fine
control on quiet moments, most
of his first act performance, in
which the Captain has supposedly
been drinking, is marred by
excessive jutting about of his head
and flailing of his arms to
punctuate every word he says.
These spasmodic movements,
and the delivery of most of his

lines, punch so hard that they
shatter the beauty of Strindberg's
powerful words. Coupled with his
Jewish tailor accent, they render
the Captain too silly a man to
hold his wife in fear of his
bullying.
Later Improvement
He improves markedly in the
second act when the Captain is no
longer drinking and the script,
cast, and directing in general are
all much tighter.
Alice, played by Holly Barron,
professes her hatred for the
Captain at having taken her from
a promising career as an actress
into a life supposedly offering
something better and yielding this
"love-hatred, born in an abyss."
Barron chillingly exhibits
Alice's intellectual death-wishing
and steel-cold hate, but she is too
reserved in expressing the animal
in her; the fearful, desiderative
side that motivates her, and the
sexual side with which she
overwhelms Kurt.
Because the female vs. male
animal conflict is what the show is
about, Barron seems to fall
short of the mark and present an
Alice lacking in vital substance.
Fine Portrayal
Michael Liebert handsomely
portrays Kurt, the poor
representative of gentility and
reason, who gets abused and
subjugated during the course of
the evening. From his very first
moment on stage Liebert's

character is a major strength of
the production: alive and precise,
constituting a perfect foil for
Veman and Barron.
There are two other minor roles
in the play, a maid and a visitor,
who each have less than a minute
on stage, get some of the best
lines in the show, and should be
an actor's delight to play. Sadly,
Oliver cast a girl too young for the
old beggar, Maja, and the maid,
Jenny, chose to ignore the
comedy of her role as a servant
who talks back. Little roles like
that can either add measureably
to a production, or just seem to
delay action—these did the later.
Within the framework of his
interpretation Oliver has directed
"Dance of Death" well, and has
created the grotesque comedy he
wanted. Although this production
is not quite what Strindberg had
in mind, the play comes out in
bold, brisk strokes that make for a
faulty but intriguing show, and
represent a laudable attempt at a
difficult play.

William Oliver, a professor at
U.C.-Berkeley and the director of
the Berkeley Repertory Theater
production of Strindberg's play,
"The Dance of Death," has
chosen to interpret the play as if
it were written in a contemporary
context. His approach results in
an interesting but flawed
production.
In a recent article in the San
Francisco Chronicle, Oliver
condemns the "traditional
interpretation" of the play as a
tragedy or tragicomedy, and
asserts that it is a "grimly
affirmative play, and it is a funny
play .. . amusing and grotesque."
He also asserts that the play is a
metaphysical before a
psychological study.
May Miss Theme
A contemporary audience
might well indeed miss the main
theme of this play—the
irreconcilable conflicts between
the animal natures of man and
woman, and the living hell they
create in marriage—if the director
chooses to stress those elements
akin to absurdish drama like
repetition, cyclic time,
contrapuntal dialogue, mime, and
pause, and to direct the comedy
in the play with the abrupt
contrast of farce.
The director is then no longer
saying what the author had to say
the way he wanted to say it. Just
because Pastor Manders in Ibsen's
"Ghosts" could be a comic
character if an actor wrongly
played up his dated moral
convictions, does not mean that
he has to play it that way, that
Ibsen ever wanted it to be so, or
that the play has equal
significance divorced from its
background and viewed strictly in

a modern light.
"Dance of Death" occurs on a
remote military outpost, an island
called Little Hell, where a couple
married for twenty-five miserable
years continue to torment each
other perpetually as an alternative
to interminable ennui.
Marriage Shackles
Love, expressed perversely as
unavoidable duty, holds them
each other's prisoner, shackled by
marriage. The Captain, a loud,
blustering, petty bully views his
personal and professional realities
through the illusuory grandeur of
his dreams; he experiences
recurrent fits of apoplexy that
each time come close to killing
him.
His wife, Alice, sits waiting
anxiously for an attack to do him
in; she plays the piano in
accompaniment to his favorite
sword dance in the hopes that
those steps will put an end to the
continual dance of death that is
their lives.
They repeat the same steps
every day. They pray that the end
of the music will mean their
release. Strindberg, however, is
not optimistic. He himself had
three unsuccessful marriages
which prompted him to assert
that marriage is only an overture
to the hell beyond, if there even is
an end to earthly torment in sight.
New Arrival
Onto this emotional battlefield
charged with hate and frustration
arrives a man who has come to the
base to be quarantine master,
Kurt, an old friend of the
Captain and cousin to Alice. His
innocence is corrupted and moral
fibre destroyed when he is sucked
into the vortex of their evil. The
Captain and Alice each tries to use
him as a weapon against the other.
Ron Vernan plays the
aggressive, calculating Captain.
Although Vernan shows fine
control on quiet moments, most
of his first act performance, in
which the Captain has supposedly
been drinking, is marred by
excessive jutting about of his head
and flailing of his arms to
punctuate every word he says.
These spasmodic movements,
and the delivery of most of his

lines, punch so hard that they
shatter the beauty of Strindberg's
powerful words. Coupled with his
Jewish tailor accent, they render
the Captain too silly a man to
hold his wife in fear of his
bullying.
Later Improvement
He improves markedly in the
second act when the Captain is no
longer drinking and the script,
cast, and directing in general are
all much tighter.
Alice, played by Holly Barron,
professes her hatred for the
Captain at having taken her from
a promising career as an actress
into a life supposedly offering
something better and yielding this
"love-hatred, born in an abyss."
Barron chillingly exhibits
Alice's intellectual death-wishing
and steel-cold hate, but she is too
reserved in expressing the animal
in her; the fearful, desiderative
side that motivates her, and the
sexual side with which she
overwhelms Kurt.
Because the female vs. male
animal conflict is what the show is
about, Barron seems to fall
short of the mark and present an
Alice lacking in vital substance.
Fine Portrayal
Michael Liebert handsomely
portrays Kurt, the poor
representative of gentility and
reason, who gets abused and
subjugated during the course of
the evening. From his very first
moment on stage Liebert's

character is a major strength of
the production: alive and precise,
constituting a perfect foil for
Veman and Barron.
There are two other minor roles
in the play, a maid and a visitor,
who each have less than a minute
on stage, get some of the best
lines in the show, and should be
an actor's delight to play. Sadly,
Oliver cast a girl too young for the
old beggar, Maja, and the maid,
Jenny, chose to ignore the
comedy of her role as a servant
who talks back. Little roles like
that can either add measureably
to a production, or just seem to
delay action—these did the later.
Within the framework of his
interpretation Oliver has directed
"Dance of Death" well, and has
created the grotesque comedy he
wanted. Although this production
is not quite what Strindberg had
in mind, the play comes out in
bold, brisk strokes that make for a
faulty but intriguing show, and
represent a laudable attempt at a
difficult play.

"The Dance of Death," has
chosen to interpret the play as if
it were written in a contemporary
context. His approach results in
an interesting but flawed
production.
In a recent article in the San
Francisco Chronicle, Oliver
condemns the "traditional
interpretation" of the play as a
tragedy or tragicomedy, and
asserts that it is a "grimly
affirmative play, and it is a funny
play .. . amusing and grotesque."
He also asserts that the play is a
metaphysical before a
psychological study.
May Miss Theme
A contemporary audience
might well indeed miss the main
theme of this play—the
irreconcilable conflicts between
the animal natures of man and
woman, and the living hell they
create in marriage—if the director
chooses to stress those elements
akin to absurdish drama like
repetition, cyclic time,
contrapuntal dialogue, mime, and
pause, and to direct the comedy
in the play with the abrupt
contrast of farce.
The director is then no longer
saying what the author had to say
the way he wanted to say it. Just
because Pastor Manders in Ibsen's
"Ghosts" could be a comic
character if an actor wrongly
played up his dated moral
convictions, does not mean that
he has to play it that way, that
Ibsen ever wanted it to be so, or
that the play has equal
significance divorced from its
background and viewed strictly in

a modern light.
"Dance of Death" occurs on a
remote military outpost, an island
called Little Hell, where a couple
married for twenty-five miserable
years continue to torment each
other perpetually as an alternative
to interminable ennui.
Marriage Shackles
Love, expressed perversely as
unavoidable duty, holds them
each other's prisoner, shackled by
marriage. The Captain, a loud,
blustering, petty bully views his
personal and professional realities
through the illusuory grandeur of
his dreams; he experiences
recurrent fits of apoplexy that
each time come close to killing
him.
His wife, Alice, sits waiting
anxiously for an attack to do him
in; she plays the piano in
accompaniment to his favorite
sword dance in the hopes that
those steps will put an end to the
continual dance of death that is
their lives.
They repeat the same steps
every day. They pray that the end
of the music will mean their
release. Strindberg, however, is
not optimistic. He himself had
three unsuccessful marriages
which prompted him to assert
that marriage is only an overture
to the hell beyond, if there even is
an end to earthly torment in sight.
New Arrival
Onto this emotional battlefield
charged with hate and frustration
arrives a man who has come to the
base to be quarantine master,
Kurt, an old friend of the
Captain and cousin to Alice. His
innocence is corrupted and moral
fibre destroyed when he is sucked
into the vortex of their evil. The
Captain and Alice each tries to use
him as a weapon against the other.
Ron Vernan plays the
aggressive, calculating Captain.
Although Vernan shows fine
control on quiet moments, most
of his first act performance, in
which the Captain has supposedly
been drinking, is marred by
excessive jutting about of his head
and flailing of his arms to
punctuate every word he says.
These spasmodic movements,
and the delivery of most of his

lines, punch so hard that they
shatter the beauty of Strindberg's
powerful words. Coupled with his
Jewish tailor accent, they render
the Captain too silly a man to
hold his wife in fear of his
bullying.
Later Improvement
He improves markedly in the
second act when the Captain is no
longer drinking and the script,
cast, and directing in general are
all much tighter.
Alice, played by Holly Barron,
professes her hatred for the
Captain at having taken her from
a promising career as an actress
into a life supposedly offering
something better and yielding this
"love-hatred, born in an abyss."
Barron chillingly exhibits
Alice's intellectual death-wishing
and steel-cold hate, but she is too
reserved in expressing the animal
in her; the fearful, desiderative
side that motivates her, and the
sexual side with which she
overwhelms Kurt.
Because the female vs. male
animal conflict is what the show is
about, Barron seems to fall
short of the mark and present an
Alice lacking in vital substance.
Fine Portrayal
Michael Liebert handsomely
portrays Kurt, the poor
representative of gentility and
reason, who gets abused and
subjugated during the course of
the evening. From his very first
moment on stage Liebert's

character is a major strength of
the production: alive and precise,
constituting a perfect foil for
Veman and Barron.
There are two other minor roles
in the play, a maid and a visitor,
who each have less than a minute
on stage, get some of the best
lines in the show, and should be
an actor's delight to play. Sadly,
Oliver cast a girl too young for the
old beggar, Maja, and the maid,
Jenny, chose to ignore the
comedy of her role as a servant
who talks back. Little roles like
that can either add measureably
to a production, or just seem to
delay action—these did the later.
Within the framework of his
interpretation Oliver has directed
"Dance of Death" well, and has
created the grotesque comedy he
wanted. Although this production
is not quite what Strindberg had
in mind, the play comes out in
bold, brisk strokes that make for a
faulty but intriguing show, and
represent a laudable attempt at a
difficult play.

When a contemporary director
chooses to do a play from another
period, he must decide whether
his interpretation is going to
present the play as the author and
audience of that period saw it,
with the hopes that the audience
will react to it today as they did
before, or to interpret it in the
light of the current culture, and
make a statement for today at the
risk of losing the original meaning.
