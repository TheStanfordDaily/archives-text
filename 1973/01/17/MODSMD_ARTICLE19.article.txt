# Washington Defeats Swimmers
## 
### MIKE CHASSON 
The Stanford swimming team
split two dual meets in the Pacific
Northwest last weekend. The
Cardinals defeated Oregon Friday
afternoon 66-47, and lost to
Washington, 68-45, Saturday
night.
The Ducks proved to be
tougher than expected, but with
Dean Anderson, Steve Strong,
Brian Job, and Randy Whitchurch
scoring double wins Stanford won
going away.
Anderson won the 50 free in
21.7 and the 100 free in 48.2;
both have season bests. Strong
won the 1000 free in 10.05.5 and
the 500 in 4.53.2 to also win two
individual events.
Job swam breastroke on the
winning medley relay and won the
200 breastroke in 2.06.9 over
John Hencken in 2.07.0.

Whitchurch was also on the
medley relay swimming the
backstroke and later won the 200
backstroke in a season best
1.57.1.
On Saturday night Stanford
faced a Washington team that
proved it is one of the strongest in
the country. The Huskies,
swimming without two of their
stars, Olympian Rick Coella and
Scott Lautman won numerous
close races and came through in
the sprints to win the meet.
Stanford started well by
winning the 400 medley relay in
3.29.0, which is currently the best
time in the country. Job sparked
the relay by swimming the fly leg
rather than the breastroke,
splitting a 51.9. Whitchurch went
53.5 in the backstroke, Hencken
56.8 in the breast, and Anderson
46.7 in the free.

The 1000 and 200 went as
planned with Terry Sutton
finishing second to Steve Power in
the 1000, 9.38.0 to 9.48.0, and
Richard Cook placing second in
the 200 in 1.46.2.
Coach Jim Gaughran's meet
plan started to crumble with the
50 free. Stanford was counting on
eight points, but only got five as
Martin Pedley tied for first in 22.0
and Steve Carey got third.
The 200 1M went as hoped
with Hencken going a season best
1.57.5 to John Deßoest's winning
time of 1.57.0. Terry Sutton kept
the Cardinal's hopes alive with a
lifetime best 1.57.0 in the 200 fly
to finish second to Deßoest's
1.56.5.
With the 100 free, came the
beginning of the end for
Stanford's hopes of winning the
meet. Gaughran was counting on
eight points and only got three as
Washington received first and
third with Anderson getting
second in 48.7.
Washington clinched the meet
with a first and second in the 500
free with Power winning in 4.43.8
and Steve Johnson second in
4.44.6. Cook finished third in
4.49.1, with Sutton swimming his
third individual event fourth in
4.52.2.
The meet finished up with the
Cardinals going one-two in the
200 breast. Job set a pool record
of 2.05.6 to Hencken's 2.07.8.
Washington's sprinters came
through once again to win the 400
free relay in 3.09.9 to Stanford's
3.14.4.
Diver Rich Rector finished
second in both the one-meter and
three-meter events. Gaughran was
extremely happy with Rector's
diving, labeling it much improved
over last season.
In reviewing the defeat
Gaughran stated, "It was
disappointing to lose, but the
team did a great job. The times
were very encouraging."
Stanford faces defending
NCAA champion Indiana at the
Encina pools this Saturday at 2
p.m. Tickets are now on sale in
the Athletic Department Ticket
Office.
