# Arguments In Pentagon Papers Trial Set To Begin In Los Angeles Today
## 
### ED KOHN 
Following the completion of jury
selection, opening arguments will
begin this morning in Los Angeles in
the second trial of Dr. Daniel Ellsberg
and Anthony J. Russo, co-defendants
in the "Pentagon Papers" case.
Ellsberg and Russo are charged with
counts of espionage, theft of
government property and conspiracy
in connection with the 1971 "leak" to
numerous newspapers of a government
study entitled "History of U.S.
Decision-Making Process in Vietnam."
Prior to its publication in the New
York Times, the study was classified
"Top Secret" by the Department of
Defense.
The "Pentagon Papers" are a
lengthy, detailed high-level review of
American involvement in Indochina
during the past four presidential
administrations. Publication of the
"Papers" by the New York Times on
June 13, 1971 sparked a far-ranging
debate on the government's obligation
to inform the Congress and the public
of its activities and led to several
reviews of this country's security
classification systems.
Four Month Delay
Ellsberg and Russo's first trial
ended last Dec. 12, after U.S. District
Court Judge William Matthew Byrne
Jr. dismissed the jury, which had not
met for four months while the defense

pursued an unsuccessful appeal to the
U.S. Supreme Court on a wiretap
question.
Byrne dismissed the jurors after the
Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
denied a defense request to order him
to do so but commented that he
would be "foolish" to continue the
trial with the same jury after the
unprecedented four-month delay in
the proceedings.
The jurors were instructed to ignore
any mention of the case but were not
sequestered or otherwise supervised
during the interruption, and several
reported some knowledge of the
Watergate bugging incident and other
presidential campaign issues that may
enter the case. Their knowledge
became known during a brief voir dire
examination by Byrne shortly before
their dismissal.
The new ten woman, two man jury
panel appears to differ markedly from
the old panel. Six members of the new
jury told the court that the United
States should leave Vietnam or that
the war should be ended quickly.
Three others said they were opposed
to wars in general, while the remaining
three said they did not have enough
information about the Vietnam war to
form an opinion.
Viet Vet Juror
One of the new jurors is a
25-year-old, partially-disabled Vietnam

war veteran who told the court: "Asa
soldier I was obedient. I thought I was
doing the right thing, a good job. But
now (that) I've returned, I've changed
my way of thinking. I don't believe we
should be there. At this moment I
pray for peace."

Both defendants originally were
strong supporters of American policies
in Indochina but became antiwar
activists after spending time in
Vietnam.
Ellsberg, 41, is a former Marine and
Rand Corp. (a large government
sponsored "think-tank") researcher
who has spent most of his life working
on issues involving Vietnam. Trained
in political science and economics, he
was last employed by the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Like Ellsberg, Russo, 36, worked as
a Rand researcher developing policies
to be used in Vietnam. Trained in
plasma physics and international
relations, he holds two masters'
degrees from Princeton University. He
was last employed by the Los Angeles
Probation Department.
Wrongdoing Denied
While freely admitting that he
released the "Pentagon Papers" to the
news media, Ellsberg denies any
wrongdoing and frequently laments
that his release of the documents did
not shorten the war. He believes that
the outcome of the trial will be
determined by national political issues,
such as the continued American
presence in Vietnam.
The trial is expected to focus on
how Ellsberg and Russo obtained,
transported and copied the documents
while working at Rand Corp. The
indictment does not point to a
courtroom airing of how the materials
were given to the Times and the other
papers.
Ellsberg is charged with 12 counts
of espionage, one count of theft of
government property, and one count
of conspiracy. He faces a maximum of
115 years imprisonment. Russo faces a
possible 35-year sentence on three
similar charges.
The first charge against Ellsberg
states that he "obtained and caused to
be obtained classified Government
documents relating to the national
defense ... The documents would be
communicated, delivered and
transmitted to defendants and others,
none of whom would be authorized to
receive them." In plain language, that
is the conspiracy charge.
Further Charges
The next six charges against
Ellsberg allege that he stole, received
and concealed nine volumes of the

"Papers," a 1969 memorandum from
the Joint Chiefs of Staff on Vietnam,
and a study published after the 1954
Geneva Conference on Vietnam.
The other eight charges against him
involve his allegedly unauthorized
possession of the "Papers."
The trial promises to raise
numerous constitutional questions,
according to defense lawyers and
others familiar with the case.
The government alleges that
Ellsberg illegally possessed documents
"relating to the national defense." To
sustain this charge, the government
must prove that the "Papers" and the
other documents are related to the
"national defense," and are not merely
classified "Top Secret."
The term "national defense," which
cropped up repeatedly in the
government's June, 1971 efforts to
prevent the Times and other
newspapers from printing segments of
the study, has never been defined by
the Supreme Court.(The Court
sidestepped the question in its opinion
in that case.)
'Best Interests' Argued
Another issue certain to be raised is
that the espionage charges require that
the defendants must have knowingly

acted "against the best interests of the
United States." Ellsberg is prepared to
argue that releasing the "Papers" is the
best thing he could have done for this
country.
Still another question is whether or
not the government can claim to
"own" any information — rather than
the paper upon which it is printed.
One of the defense team's main
arguments is that the information
contained in the "Papers" was already
in the public domain, placed there at
various times by government officials
in the form of speeches, magazine
articles, "leaked" information, etc.
The trial is expected to last at least
four months, barring any more appeals
during the course of the proceedings.
There are three government
prosecutors, assisted by the Federal
Bureau of Investigation and other
agencies, and five full-time defense
attorneys, aided by some 20 other
lawyers and specialists and a corps of
young volunteers, many of them law
students.
The defense reports that it has
already spent some $400,000 and that
current expenses are running in excess
of $60,000 a month.

115 years imprisonment. Russo faces a
possible 35-year sentence on three
similar charges.
The first charge against Ellsberg
states that he "obtained and caused to
be obtained classified Government
documents relating to the national
defense ... The documents would be
communicated, delivered and
transmitted to defendants and others,
none of whom would be authorized to
receive them." In plain language, that
is the conspiracy charge.
Further Charges
The next six charges against
Ellsberg allege that he stole, received
and concealed nine volumes of the

"Papers," a 1969 memorandum from
the Joint Chiefs of Staff on Vietnam,
and a study published after the 1954
Geneva Conference on Vietnam.
The other eight charges against him
involve his allegedly unauthorized
possession of the "Papers."
The trial promises to raise
numerous constitutional questions,
according to defense lawyers and
others familiar with the case.
The government alleges that
Ellsberg illegally possessed documents
"relating to the national defense." To
sustain this charge, the government
must prove that the "Papers" and the
other documents are related to the
"national defense," and are not merely
classified "Top Secret."
The term "national defense," which
cropped up repeatedly in the
government's June, 1971 efforts to
prevent the Times and other
newspapers from printing segments of
the study, has never been defined by
the Supreme Court.(The Court
sidestepped the question in its opinion
in that case.)
'Best Interests' Argued
Another issue certain to be raised is
that the espionage charges require that
the defendants must have knowingly

acted "against the best interests of the
United States." Ellsberg is prepared to
argue that releasing the "Papers" is the
best thing he could have done for this
country.
Still another question is whether or
not the government can claim to
"own" any information — rather than
the paper upon which it is printed.
One of the defense team's main
arguments is that the information
contained in the "Papers" was already
in the public domain, placed there at
various times by government officials
in the form of speeches, magazine
articles, "leaked" information, etc.
The trial is expected to last at least
four months, barring any more appeals
during the course of the proceedings.
There are three government
prosecutors, assisted by the Federal
Bureau of Investigation and other
agencies, and five full-time defense
attorneys, aided by some 20 other
lawyers and specialists and a corps of
young volunteers, many of them law
students.
The defense reports that it has
already spent some $400,000 and that
current expenses are running in excess
of $60,000 a month.
Following the completion of jury
selection, opening arguments will
begin this morning in Los Angeles in
the second trial of Dr. Daniel Ellsberg
and Anthony J. Russo, co-defendants
in the "Pentagon Papers" case.
Ellsberg and Russo are charged with
counts of espionage, theft of
government property and conspiracy
in connection with the 1971 "leak" to
numerous newspapers of a government
study entitled "History of U.S.
Decision-Making Process in Vietnam."
Prior to its publication in the New
York Times, the study was classified
"Top Secret" by the Department of
Defense.
The "Pentagon Papers" are a
lengthy, detailed high-level review of
American involvement in Indochina
during the past four presidential
administrations. Publication of the
"Papers" by the New York Times on
June 13, 1971 sparked a far-ranging
debate on the government's obligation
to inform the Congress and the public
of its activities and led to several
reviews of this country's security
classification systems.
Four Month Delay
Ellsberg and Russo's first trial
ended last Dec. 12, after U.S. District
Court Judge William Matthew Byrne
Jr. dismissed the jury, which had not
met for four months while the defense

pursued an unsuccessful appeal to the
U.S. Supreme Court on a wiretap
question.
Byrne dismissed the jurors after the
Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
denied a defense request to order him
to do so but commented that he
would be "foolish" to continue the
trial with the same jury after the
unprecedented four-month delay in
the proceedings.
The jurors were instructed to ignore
any mention of the case but were not
sequestered or otherwise supervised
during the interruption, and several
reported some knowledge of the
Watergate bugging incident and other
presidential campaign issues that may
enter the case. Their knowledge
became known during a brief voir dire
examination by Byrne shortly before
their dismissal.
The new ten woman, two man jury
panel appears to differ markedly from
the old panel. Six members of the new
jury told the court that the United
States should leave Vietnam or that
the war should be ended quickly.
Three others said they were opposed
to wars in general, while the remaining
three said they did not have enough
information about the Vietnam war to
form an opinion.
Viet Vet Juror
One of the new jurors is a
25-year-old, partially-disabled Vietnam

war veteran who told the court: "Asa
soldier I was obedient. I thought I was
doing the right thing, a good job. But
now (that) I've returned, I've changed
my way of thinking. I don't believe we
should be there. At this moment I
pray for peace."

Both defendants originally were
strong supporters of American policies
in Indochina but became antiwar
activists after spending time in
Vietnam.
Ellsberg, 41, is a former Marine and
Rand Corp. (a large government
sponsored "think-tank") researcher
who has spent most of his life working
on issues involving Vietnam. Trained
in political science and economics, he
was last employed by the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Like Ellsberg, Russo, 36, worked as
a Rand researcher developing policies
to be used in Vietnam. Trained in
plasma physics and international
relations, he holds two masters'
degrees from Princeton University. He
was last employed by the Los Angeles
Probation Department.
Wrongdoing Denied
While freely admitting that he
released the "Pentagon Papers" to the
news media, Ellsberg denies any
wrongdoing and frequently laments
that his release of the documents did
not shorten the war. He believes that
the outcome of the trial will be
determined by national political issues,
such as the continued American
presence in Vietnam.
The trial is expected to focus on
how Ellsberg and Russo obtained,
transported and copied the documents
while working at Rand Corp. The
indictment does not point to a
courtroom airing of how the materials
were given to the Times and the other
papers.
Ellsberg is charged with 12 counts
of espionage, one count of theft of
government property, and one count
of conspiracy. He faces a maximum of
115 years imprisonment. Russo faces a
possible 35-year sentence on three
similar charges.
The first charge against Ellsberg
states that he "obtained and caused to
be obtained classified Government
documents relating to the national
defense ... The documents would be
communicated, delivered and
transmitted to defendants and others,
none of whom would be authorized to
receive them." In plain language, that
is the conspiracy charge.

Ellsberg allege that he stole, received
and concealed nine volumes of the

"Papers," a 1969 memorandum from

trial with the same jury after the
unprecedented four-month delay in
the proceedings.
The jurors were instructed to ignore
any mention of the case but were not
sequestered or otherwise supervised
during the interruption, and several
reported some knowledge of the
Watergate bugging incident and other
presidential campaign issues that may
enter the case. Their knowledge
became known during a brief voir dire
examination by Byrne shortly before
their dismissal.
The new ten woman, two man jury
panel appears to differ markedly from
the old panel. Six members of the new
jury told the court that the United
States should leave Vietnam or that
the war should be ended quickly.
Three others said they were opposed
to wars in general, while the remaining
three said they did not have enough
information about the Vietnam war to
form an opinion.
Viet Vet Juror
One of the new jurors is a
25-year-old, partially-disabled Vietnam

war veteran who told the court: "Asa
soldier I was obedient. I thought I was
doing the right thing, a good job. But
now (that) I've returned, I've changed
my way of thinking. I don't believe we
should be there. At this moment I
pray for peace."

Both defendants originally were
strong supporters of American policies
in Indochina but became antiwar
activists after spending time in
Vietnam.
Ellsberg, 41, is a former Marine and
Rand Corp. (a large government
sponsored "think-tank") researcher
who has spent most of his life working
on issues involving Vietnam. Trained
in political science and economics, he
was last employed by the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Like Ellsberg, Russo, 36, worked as
a Rand researcher developing policies
to be used in Vietnam. Trained in
plasma physics and international
relations, he holds two masters'
degrees from Princeton University. He
was last employed by the Los Angeles
Probation Department.
Wrongdoing Denied
While freely admitting that he
released the "Pentagon Papers" to the
news media, Ellsberg denies any
wrongdoing and frequently laments
that his release of the documents did
not shorten the war. He believes that
the outcome of the trial will be
determined by national political issues,
such as the continued American
presence in Vietnam.
The trial is expected to focus on
how Ellsberg and Russo obtained,
transported and copied the documents
while working at Rand Corp. The
indictment does not point to a
courtroom airing of how the materials
were given to the Times and the other
papers.
Ellsberg is charged with 12 counts
of espionage, one count of theft of
government property, and one count
of conspiracy. He faces a maximum of
115 years imprisonment. Russo faces a
possible 35-year sentence on three
similar charges.
The first charge against Ellsberg
states that he "obtained and caused to
be obtained classified Government
documents relating to the national
defense ... The documents would be
communicated, delivered and
transmitted to defendants and others,
none of whom would be authorized to
receive them." In plain language, that
is the conspiracy charge.
Further Charges
The next six charges against
Ellsberg allege that he stole, received
and concealed nine volumes of the

"Papers," a 1969 memorandum from
the Joint Chiefs of Staff on Vietnam,
and a study published after the 1954
Geneva Conference on Vietnam.
The other eight charges against him
involve his allegedly unauthorized
possession of the "Papers."
The trial promises to raise
numerous constitutional questions,
according to defense lawyers and
others familiar with the case.
The government alleges that
Ellsberg illegally possessed documents
"relating to the national defense." To
sustain this charge, the government
must prove that the "Papers" and the
other documents are related to the
"national defense," and are not merely
classified "Top Secret."
The term "national defense," which
cropped up repeatedly in the
government's June, 1971 efforts to
prevent the Times and other
newspapers from printing segments of
the study, has never been defined by
the Supreme Court.(The Court
sidestepped the question in its opinion
in that case.)
'Best Interests' Argued
Another issue certain to be raised is
that the espionage charges require that
the defendants must have knowingly

acted "against the best interests of the
United States." Ellsberg is prepared to
argue that releasing the "Papers" is the
best thing he could have done for this
country.
Still another question is whether or
not the government can claim to
"own" any information — rather than
the paper upon which it is printed.
One of the defense team's main
arguments is that the information
contained in the "Papers" was already
in the public domain, placed there at
various times by government officials
in the form of speeches, magazine
articles, "leaked" information, etc.
The trial is expected to last at least
four months, barring any more appeals
during the course of the proceedings.
There are three government
prosecutors, assisted by the Federal
Bureau of Investigation and other
agencies, and five full-time defense
attorneys, aided by some 20 other
lawyers and specialists and a corps of
young volunteers, many of them law
students.
The defense reports that it has
already spent some $400,000 and that
current expenses are running in excess
of $60,000 a month.
Following the completion of jury
selection, opening arguments will
begin this morning in Los Angeles in
the second trial of Dr. Daniel Ellsberg
and Anthony J. Russo, co-defendants
in the "Pentagon Papers" case.
Ellsberg and Russo are charged with
counts of espionage, theft of
government property and conspiracy
in connection with the 1971 "leak" to
numerous newspapers of a government
study entitled "History of U.S.
Decision-Making Process in Vietnam."
Prior to its publication in the New
York Times, the study was classified
"Top Secret" by the Department of
Defense.
The "Pentagon Papers" are a
lengthy, detailed high-level review of
American involvement in Indochina
during the past four presidential
administrations. Publication of the
"Papers" by the New York Times on
June 13, 1971 sparked a far-ranging
debate on the government's obligation
to inform the Congress and the public
of its activities and led to several
reviews of this country's security
classification systems.
Four Month Delay
Ellsberg and Russo's first trial
ended last Dec. 12, after U.S. District
Court Judge William Matthew Byrne
Jr. dismissed the jury, which had not
met for four months while the defense

pursued an unsuccessful appeal to the
U.S. Supreme Court on a wiretap
question.
Byrne dismissed the jurors after the
Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
denied a defense request to order him
to do so but commented that he
would be "foolish" to continue the
trial with the same jury after the
unprecedented four-month delay in
the proceedings.

acted "against the best interests of the
United States." Ellsberg is prepared to
argue that releasing the "Papers" is the
best thing he could have done for this
country.
Still another question is whether or
not the government can claim to
"own" any information — rather than
the paper upon which it is printed.
One of the defense team's main
arguments is that the information
contained in the "Papers" was already
in the public domain, placed there at
various times by government officials
in the form of speeches, magazine
articles, "leaked" information, etc.
The trial is expected to last at least
four months, barring any more appeals
during the course of the proceedings.
There are three government
prosecutors, assisted by the Federal
Bureau of Investigation and other
agencies, and five full-time defense
attorneys, aided by some 20 other
lawyers and specialists and a corps of
young volunteers, many of them law
students.
The defense reports that it has
already spent some $400,000 and that
current expenses are running in excess
of $60,000 a month.
