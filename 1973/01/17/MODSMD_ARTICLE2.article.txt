# Arguments In Pentagon Papers Trial Set To Begin In Los Angeles Today
## 
### ED KOHN 
Following the completion of jury
selection, opening arguments will
begin this morning in Los Angeles in
the second trial of Dr. Daniel Ellsberg
and Anthony J. Russo, co-defendants
in the "Pentagon Papers" case.
Ellsberg and Russo are charged with
counts of espionage, theft of
government property and conspiracy
in connection with the 1971 "leak" to
numerous newspapers of a government
study entitled "History of U.S.
Decision-Making Process in Vietnam."
Prior to its publication in the New
York Times, the study was classified
"Top Secret" by the Department of
Defense.
The "Pentagon Papers" are a
lengthy, detailed high-level review of
American involvement in Indochina
during the past four presidential
administrations. Publication of the
"Papers" by the New York Times on
June 13, 1971 sparked a far-ranging
debate on the government's obligation
to inform the Congress and the public
of its activities and led to several
reviews of this country's security
classification systems.
Four Month Delay
Ellsberg and Russo's first trial
ended last Dec. 12, after U.S. District
Court Judge William Matthew Byrne
Jr. dismissed the jury, which had not
met for four months while the defense

pursued an unsuccessful appeal to the
U.S. Supreme Court on a wiretap
question.
Byrne dismissed the jurors after the
Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
denied a defense request to order him
to do so but commented that he
would be "foolish" to continue the
trial with the same jury after the
unprecedented four-month delay in
the proceedings.
The jurors were instructed to ignore
any mention of the case but were not
sequestered or otherwise supervised
during the interruption, and several
reported some knowledge of the
Watergate bugging incident and other
presidential campaign issues that may
enter the case. Their knowledge
became known during a brief voir dire
examination by Byrne shortly before
their dismissal.
The new ten woman, two man jury
panel appears to differ markedly from
the old panel. Six members of the new
jury told the court that the United
States should leave Vietnam or that
the war should be ended quickly.
Three others said they were opposed
to wars in general, while the remaining
three said they did not have enough
information about the Vietnam war to
form an opinion.
Viet Vet Juror
One of the new jurors is a
25-year-old, partially-disabled Vietnam

war veteran who told the court: "Asa
soldier I was obedient. I thought I was
doing the right thing, a good job. But
now (that) I've returned, I've changed
my way of thinking. I don't believe we
should be there. At this moment I
pray for peace."

Both defendants originally were
strong supporters of American policies
in Indochina but became antiwar
activists after spending time in
Vietnam.
