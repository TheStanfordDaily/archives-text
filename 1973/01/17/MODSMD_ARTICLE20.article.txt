# Pac-8, NCAA Title Hopes High
## Gymnasts Open Season Tomorrow 
### PHIL HUBBARD 
The 1973 gymnastics season
begins at Stanford this Thursday
as the Cards take on Cal State
Fullerton at Maples Pavilion at 8
p.m. Led by two-time Olympian
Steve Hug, this year's team should
be a contender for top honors at
both the Pac-8 and national level.
Overseeing the team this year is
Coach Sadao Hamada, who came
from Kent State with an M.A. last
summer to teach physical
education in Marin County. When
Dan Millman decided to accept a
position at Oberlin, he
recommended Sadao as his
successor. After some
deliberation, the athletic
department agreed to hire
Hamada.
Although filling the shoes of a
coach of Millman's calibre is no
easy task, the newcomer seems
well qualified for the job. What
Hamada lacks in experience he
makes up for in enthusiasm and
the fact that he is a world class
performer himself.
He is a graduate of Nippon
College, internationally famous
for its gymnastics teams. After
coming to the U.S. in 1969 he
placed second in the Ail-Around
competition in the 1970 and 1971
AAU gymnastics championships,
and in 1972 he placed first in the
sidehorse in U.S. Gymnastics
Federation championships.
"The team was a little
apprehensive about who they'd
get to replace Dan," said Howard
Bessen, a junior ring specialist,
"but Sadao's doing a great job."
Like Millman, Hamada tries to
work closely with the team and
develop personal friendships as
well as the coach-athlete
relationship.

Besides Millman, the squad lost
only one member from last year's
excellent team, which finished
second in the Pac-8. But this year
could be Stanford's best ever.
Leading the team again will be
junior Steve Hug, who will be
looking for more honors to add to
his already impressive collection.
Steve was an Olympian in '68, and
the consensus top Ail-Around
gymnast for the U.S. team at
Munich. He also won the NCAA
Ail-Around title in '72.
The Card's other standout in
the Ail-Around will be Bob
Anderson, who was generally
acclaimed as the top high school
gymnast in that event in '71.
Although he competed in Hug's
shadow last year, he placed third
in the Pac-8 in the floor exercise
and competed in the NCAA
championships. He injured his
shoulder in practice last week, and
is a doubtful performer for this
week. He should not be seriously
hampered for the rest of the
season, however.
Veterans
Other veterans in the
All-Around include Leo Hollberg,
Ted Miyamoto, Hector Neff, Tom
Simon and John White. They will
be joined by freshman Denny
Melendez.
With so many outstanding
All-Around men, Stanford has
fewer specialists than many
schools. Junior Howard Bessen
should be a top contender for
conference and national honors
on the rings this year. He placed
third in the Pac-8 and sixth in the
NCAA in that event last year.
Howard will be backed up in his
event by freshman George
Negrete.
Junior Shawn Skerrett will be

looking for points in the vault this
year, as well as competing in the
All-Around. In the floor exercise
event freshman Bill Madsen has
the potential to be a top
performer.
Freshman Sensation
Perhaps the strongest addition
to the squad this year is freshman
Ted Marcy. An absolute sensation
on the side horse, probably the
most difficult event in gymnastics,
he will be in top contention for
the Pac-8 and NCAA side horse
championship. He was the 1971
and 1972 AAU champ in this
event and is looking forward to
his third win in a row there.
Backing up Hamada is
Assistant Coach Seth Anderson.
Associate coaches include
Leonard Bunes and Jack Haderle.
In charge of statistics and various
odd jobs will be Manager Bob

Sellers.
Stanford has a tough schedule
this year which should push the
team to better and better
performances. The squad has been
working out since early last
quarter as much as four hours a
day, seven days a week. With the
exception of Anderson the group
is free of injuries.
According to Hamada, the
opener against Fullerton will be
an exciting contest. "They should
be very good. They were the
NCAA College Division
champions last year." Other tough
opponents this year include San
Fernando Valley, Southern
Illinois (the NCAA University
Division champions), and of
course Berkeley. If they get past
those teams in good shape, the
squad is hungrily eyeing the Pac-8
and NCAA championships.
