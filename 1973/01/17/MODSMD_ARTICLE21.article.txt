# NCAA Changes '1.6' Rule
## 
### 
The National Collegiate
Athletic Association's
controversial 1.6 Rule, focal point
of the Isaac Curtis controversy at
Cal two years ago, was revised
earlier this week to provide that a
student must achieve a 2.0 grade
point average in high school to be
eligible for NCAA athletic
competition.
Violations of the rule resulted
in the suspension of Cal by the
NCAA, and caused football
players Curtis and Larry Brumsey
to leave the University.
At their Jan. 13 convention in
Chicago the NCAA also decided
to limit the number of
scholarships that each school
could give in a particular sport.

Football scholarships are limited
to 105, and basketball grants are
limited to 18 under the new
ruling.
In addition, the Association
voted that all athletic scholarships
be awarded for only one year at a
time. The members of the
Association also defeated a
proposal to require that athletic
scholarships be awarded on a
financial need basis.
The 1.6 rule had required that
students take a test to predict a
1.6 (C minus) average in college
work, but the rule was unpopular
with many schools.
The members of the NCAA
voted 204-187 to eliminate this
rule.
