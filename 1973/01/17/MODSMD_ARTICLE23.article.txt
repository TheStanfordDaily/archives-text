Corona Jury Deadlocked, 11-1
FAIRFIELD — Jurors in the Juan Corona mass murder
trial announced in the fifth day of deliberations yesterday
they have progressed from an 8-4 to an 11-1 deadlock.
The direction of the jury's leanings was not revealed.
The panel also sought clarification of the legal
requirement that Corona cannot be convicted unless guilt
was proven "beyond a reasonable doubt."
Judge Richard E. Patton had the lengthy definition
reread and then sent the jury back to continue its
deliberations in efforts to break the 11-1 deadlock.
The jury recessed its deliberations yesterday evening
without reaching a verdict in the case. Deliberations were
set to resume this morning.
On Monday, the jury had reported itself in an 8-4
deadlock, and Patton ordered the jurors not to reveal if
the majority favored acquittal or conviction.
Corona, a 38-year-old Mexican citizen who was a farm
labor contractor in Sutter County, is accused of hacking
to death 25 farm workers and drifters and secretly
burying their bodies in a peach orchard north of Yuba
City in the spring of 1971. He has been held without bail
since his arrest May 26, 1971.
Prosecutor G. Dave Teja said a second trial would be
automatic if there were a hung jury. Defense attorney
Richard Hawk told reporters he believed the majority
favored acquittal and said Corona could withstand a
second trial if he were freed on bail.
Bitter Viet Fighting Reported
SAIGON — Bitter fighting was reported yesterday in
contested territory throughout South Vietnam, with U.S.
bombers attacking to support Saigon's troops and to hit
southern targets of their own.
The Viet Cong charged the United States with
persisting in "savage bombardments" in the South despite
the bombing halt over the North. A Viet Cong broadcast
monitored in Saigon said antigovernment forces are
determined to continue their ground offensive to "step up
the struggle against the United States for national
salvation."
The Saigon command reported a slight increase in the
number of ground engagements between South
Vietnamese and Viet Cong or North Vietnamese troops in
the 24-hour period ending at 6 a.m. Military sources said
the increase also reflected more aggressive action by South
Vietnamese forces.
The sources explained this was the result of spoiling
operations by the South Vietnamese to pre-empt enemy
forces from gaining or holding land in anticipation of a
ceasefire.
The heaviest fighting was reported in the Que Son
Valley southwest of Da Nang and on the eastern edge of

the U Minh Forest in the Mekong Delta. Thirty-five
enemy troops were claimed killed in the Que Son Valley
fight, while 52 were killed in the delta fighting according
to Saigon's count.
Watergate Defense Cites Threat
WASHINGTON — A defense attorney said yesterday he
will attempt to show the Watergate break-in and bugging
was motivated by concern that potentially dangerous
groups planned violence to Republican officials including
President Nixon.
Gerald Alch, attorney for James W. McCord Jr.,
questioned a witness closely about whether he had seen
any members of various antiwar groups in the campaign
headquarters of Democrat George S. McGovern.
McCord and G. Gordon Liddy are the two remaining
defendants in the trial involving a break-in June 17 at the
Democratic National Committee headquarters.
"If one is under a reasonable apprehension — regardless
of whether that apprehension is in fact correct," Alch said
outside the courtroom, "he is justified in breaking a law
to avoid great harm, which in this case would include
violence against Republican officials, including the
President."
Alch said outside the courtroom that the attempt to
ferret out incipient demonstrations was a key to his
defense of McCord.
McCord was security coordinator for the Committee
for the re-election of the President on June 17 when he
was arrested in the Watergate building. Liddy — not
apprehended inside but charged with the burglary — was
counsel for Nixon's campaign finance committee.
Alch said he will attempt to show that potentially
violent groups were supporting the Democrats who were
being spied upon and were in contact with the groups.
Frank A. Sturgis, Euginio R. Martinez, Virgilio R.
Gonzalez, and Bernard L. Barker, all from Miami, pleaded
guilty Monday to breaking into the headquarters and
planting devices to intercept oral and wire
communications.
The seventh defendant, E. Howard Hunt Jr., pleaded
guilty last week. All are awaiting sentencing.
Hunt posted $100,000 surety bonds; the other four,
unable to raise similar bonds, were held in jail.
