# Nixon Cease-Fire Declaration Reported For Inauguration Eve
## 
### 
SAIGON (AP) — President Nixon
plans to declare a unilateral Vietnam
cease-fire to start on the eve of his
inauguration and Saigon has no choice
but to go along, South Vietnamese
sources reported yesterday.
"Trust me," Nixon was reported to
have said in a personal message to
President Nguyen Van Thieu of South
Vietnam.
The sources said that barring a
last-minute hitch Nixon intends to

order the indefinite cease-fire effective
at 11 p.m. Friday Saigon time. That is
7 a.m. Friday PST.
The President will be inaugurated
for a second term Saturday.
The cease-fire would be designed to
convince the North Vietnamese to
release American prisoners of war and
take the final steps toward sealing the
peace agreement under negotiation by
Henry A. Kissinger and Hanoi's
representatives, the sources said.

The sources did not indicate how
the unilateral cease-fire could be
enforced or what the chances were for
a positive response from North
Vietnamese and Viet Cong troops. But
South Vietnamese and American
forces presumably could continue
defensive operations and would be
authorized to open fire if threatened.
For the longer term Nixon was
reported to have advised the South
Vietnamese president that an
international agreement had been
reached to guarantee against further
hostilities by North Vietnam once the
peace accord is signed.
The Florida White House in Key
Biscayne said it would have no
comment on what the South
Vietnamese sources said.
In Saigon, there was no official
comment from the Presidential Palace,
the U.S. Embassy or the U.S. Military
Command.
The reports emanated from sources
with access to discussions by Thieu
and other high South Vietnamese
officials on the latest draft agreement.
Saigon Objections
One senior U.S. official said it was
possible they were deliberately leaked
by Saigon because of its objections to

some conditions it feels Nixon is
imposing on Thieu.
Nixon's emissary, Gen. Alexander
•M. Haig Jr., conferred for 2 I A hours
with Thieu on the latest draft
agreement before the Paris peace
negotiators.
The U.S. Embassy indicated further
meetings between Haig and Thieu and
said Haig's schedule was
"open-ended." This was taken to mean
Haig hoped to get final agreement
from Thieu before returning to
Washington, thus laying the
groundwork for Kissinger to return to
Paris to okay the agreement with Tho.
Other sources said the South
Vietnamese president has ordered key
military aides to Paris to join technical
negotiators working on details of the
prospective agreement.
New Momentum
The latest developments gave new
momentum to peace hopes and
produced reports that an agreement to
end the war already has been reached.
These reports interpreted Nixon's
actions as an indication that Kissinger
and Hanoi negotiator Le Due Tho
reached a basic agreement during their
six days of intensive talks in Paris last
week.

release American prisoners of war and
take the final steps toward sealing the
peace agreement under negotiation by
Henry A. Kissinger and Hanoi's
representatives, the sources said.

The sources did not indicate how
the unilateral cease-fire could be
enforced or what the chances were for
a positive response from North
Vietnamese and Viet Cong troops. But
South Vietnamese and American
forces presumably could continue
defensive operations and would be
authorized to open fire if threatened.
For the longer term Nixon was
reported to have advised the South
Vietnamese president that an
international agreement had been
reached to guarantee against further
hostilities by North Vietnam once the
peace accord is signed.
The Florida White House in Key
Biscayne said it would have no
comment on what the South
Vietnamese sources said.
In Saigon, there was no official
comment from the Presidential Palace,
the U.S. Embassy or the U.S. Military
Command.
The reports emanated from sources
with access to discussions by Thieu
and other high South Vietnamese
officials on the latest draft agreement.
Saigon Objections
One senior U.S. official said it was
possible they were deliberately leaked
by Saigon because of its objections to

some conditions it feels Nixon is
imposing on Thieu.
Nixon's emissary, Gen. Alexander
•M. Haig Jr., conferred for 2 I A hours
with Thieu on the latest draft
agreement before the Paris peace
negotiators.
The U.S. Embassy indicated further
meetings between Haig and Thieu and
said Haig's schedule was
"open-ended." This was taken to mean
Haig hoped to get final agreement
from Thieu before returning to
Washington, thus laying the
groundwork for Kissinger to return to
Paris to okay the agreement with Tho.
Other sources said the South
Vietnamese president has ordered key
military aides to Paris to join technical
negotiators working on details of the
prospective agreement.
New Momentum
The latest developments gave new
momentum to peace hopes and
produced reports that an agreement to
end the war already has been reached.
These reports interpreted Nixon's
actions as an indication that Kissinger
and Hanoi negotiator Le Due Tho
reached a basic agreement during their
six days of intensive talks in Paris last
week.
SAIGON (AP) — President Nixon
plans to declare a unilateral Vietnam
cease-fire to start on the eve of his
inauguration and Saigon has no choice
but to go along, South Vietnamese
sources reported yesterday.
"Trust me," Nixon was reported to
have said in a personal message to
President Nguyen Van Thieu of South
Vietnam.
The sources said that barring a
last-minute hitch Nixon intends to

order the indefinite cease-fire effective
at 11 p.m. Friday Saigon time. That is
7 a.m. Friday PST.
The President will be inaugurated
for a second term Saturday.
The cease-fire would be designed to
convince the North Vietnamese to
release American prisoners of war and
take the final steps toward sealing the
peace agreement under negotiation by
Henry A. Kissinger and Hanoi's
representatives, the sources said.
