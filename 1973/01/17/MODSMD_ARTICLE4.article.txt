# New Dean Provides Impetus
## Tresidder Expands Student Services 
### JON BRAUN 
Tresidder Memorial Union, for
several years faltering under
controversial management and growing
deficits, is developing a new program
of student services in coordination
with the new Dean of Student Affairs,
James Lyons.
According to Dan Williams, Dean of
Student Affairs and Associate Dean of
Students, Tresidder will expand its
present retail services — food service,
ticket sales, store, and games — to
include the coordination of
institutionalized programs like Project
Synergy and the Black Student
Volunteer Center, and independent
student activities, organizations, and
programs.

This new policy was initiated with
the arrival of Lyons last summer.
Williams explained that at that time,
"the management's response to rising
costs was one of withdrawal of
services, which really left only retail
services. Now, we've placed an
emphasis on expansion, promotion,
and the development of better
management systems."
Tregea's Resignation
These changes come in the wake of
Tresidder Director Forrest Tregea's
resignation. Last year, an audit
disclosed a $322,000 imbalance of
Tresidder funds; the University offered
to clear the deficit on agreement to a
two-year program aimed at financial
solvency. With the thorough

organizational reconstruction
introduced by Student Affairs,
financial manager Gordon Starr will
assume many of the responsibilities
previously held by Tregea. Tregea will
leave the University, but was
unavailable for comment on his future
plans.
According to Williams, the problem
with Tresidder before the "change in
philosophy" was that "Tresidder was
thought of as a building. Now, this
should be only one of its resources."
Citing the example of Oregon State, he
explained that many student unions
combine retail services with
coordination of special events, film
societies, and community activities.
Similarly, Williams is determining
"how we can better use Tresidder
facilities for all those programs
students are attempting to develop.
"For example, the Black Students'
Volunteer Committee will use
Tresidder recreational facilities for its
program. Project Synergy will hold a
regional conference on alternate
vocations in early spring."
Progress has already been made in
other areas. "Take the coffeehouse,
for example: it's more than a food
service — it's a program. Management
and program people brought it
together, and the result is a microcosm
of what we're trying to do at

Tresidder."
Starr is responsible for
organizational matters in expanded
Tresidder facilities which also include
the Old Firehouse and Women's
Clubhouse. With the newly organized
staff at Student Services, Williams
forsees an administrative team capable
of supporting ad hoc student
enterprises, funding of student
organizations and activities, and
"initiating new programs responsive to
the needs of various non-organized
student groups."
Student Outlet
Williams hopes to develop an
outdoor recreational program which
would bring students to the ski slopes,
beaches, and parks. Also, he favors
using Tresidder "as an outlet for the
student into the community. With
Tresidder's resources and
organizational power, we could bring
the reality closer to campus.
"We need Tresidder to provide the
coordination of management,
organization, ideas, and facilities for
such programs," he emphasized.
Although many problems must still be
overcome, Williams is optimistic: "I
expect to develop TMU into a
community center that will indeed be
a facility that serves as the focal point
for campus programs and activities."

programs.

This new policy was initiated with
the arrival of Lyons last summer.
Williams explained that at that time,
"the management's response to rising
costs was one of withdrawal of
services, which really left only retail
services. Now, we've placed an
emphasis on expansion, promotion,
and the development of better
management systems."
Tregea's Resignation
These changes come in the wake of
Tresidder Director Forrest Tregea's
resignation. Last year, an audit
disclosed a $322,000 imbalance of
Tresidder funds; the University offered
to clear the deficit on agreement to a
two-year program aimed at financial
solvency. With the thorough

organizational reconstruction
introduced by Student Affairs,
financial manager Gordon Starr will
assume many of the responsibilities
previously held by Tregea. Tregea will
leave the University, but was
unavailable for comment on his future
plans.
According to Williams, the problem
with Tresidder before the "change in
philosophy" was that "Tresidder was
thought of as a building. Now, this
should be only one of its resources."
Citing the example of Oregon State, he
explained that many student unions
combine retail services with
coordination of special events, film
societies, and community activities.
Similarly, Williams is determining
"how we can better use Tresidder
facilities for all those programs
students are attempting to develop.
"For example, the Black Students'
Volunteer Committee will use
Tresidder recreational facilities for its
program. Project Synergy will hold a
regional conference on alternate
vocations in early spring."
Progress has already been made in
other areas. "Take the coffeehouse,
for example: it's more than a food
service — it's a program. Management
and program people brought it
together, and the result is a microcosm
of what we're trying to do at

Tresidder."
Starr is responsible for
organizational matters in expanded
Tresidder facilities which also include
the Old Firehouse and Women's
Clubhouse. With the newly organized
staff at Student Services, Williams
forsees an administrative team capable
of supporting ad hoc student
enterprises, funding of student
organizations and activities, and
"initiating new programs responsive to
the needs of various non-organized
student groups."
Student Outlet
Williams hopes to develop an
outdoor recreational program which
would bring students to the ski slopes,
beaches, and parks. Also, he favors
using Tresidder "as an outlet for the
student into the community. With
Tresidder's resources and
organizational power, we could bring
the reality closer to campus.
"We need Tresidder to provide the
coordination of management,
organization, ideas, and facilities for
such programs," he emphasized.
Although many problems must still be
overcome, Williams is optimistic: "I
expect to develop TMU into a
community center that will indeed be
a facility that serves as the focal point
for campus programs and activities."
Tresidder Memorial Union, for
several years faltering under
controversial management and growing
deficits, is developing a new program
of student services in coordination
with the new Dean of Student Affairs,
James Lyons.
According to Dan Williams, Dean of
Student Affairs and Associate Dean of
Students, Tresidder will expand its
present retail services — food service,
ticket sales, store, and games — to
include the coordination of
institutionalized programs like Project
Synergy and the Black Student
Volunteer Center, and independent
student activities, organizations, and
programs.
