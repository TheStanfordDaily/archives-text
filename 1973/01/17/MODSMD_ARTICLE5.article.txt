# Senate Election Scheduled For Jan. 29-30
## 
### SUE KING 
An election to fill empty seats in
the ASSU senate will be held Jan. 29
and 30, senate chairman Rocky Barber
announced last night, following senate
approval of the election dates.
Also last night, ASSU Co-president
Scott Burke announced that he has
scheduled a press conference for 1
p.m. today. Burke said that he would
make three separate announcements
relating to ASSU and University
politics.
The senate voted unanimously to
approve the dates suggested by the
Rules Committee for the election,
which will fill graduate seats in
Education, Medicine, Humanities and
Sciences, and Engineering and Earth
Sciences.
As these are the seats open for
election, the election will be for
graduate students only. Some groups
have begun circulating petitions to
have fee assessments placed on the
ballot but these will be taken care of
in a later election, according to Barber.
He cited the additional expense of
opening the election to
undergraduates as a major factor in the
senate's decision to keep the election
open to graduates only, explaining
that additional personnel would have
to be hired to staff the voting tables
and tabulate the ballots. He also
mentioned that ballots would have to
be sent to the overseas campuses,
which would delay the results of the
election.
In other business, the senate voted
to approve a resolution supporting
actions to enforce the Santa Clara
County leash law for dogs. Barber
pointed out that senate approval
would signify student approval for
enforcement of the law. He added that
according to Dean of Student Affairs

James W. Lyons, officials have been
reluctant to take action because of
possible student resistance.
The senate voted to schedule
refunds of voluntary fee assessments
for two weeks, beginning Jan. 22.
Refunds will be available from 12 until
4 p.m. every day. Fees that will be
refunded are the voluntary assessments

for the Speakers Bureau, the Special
Events Committee, and the Daily.
ASSU Co-president Brent Appel
presented plans for several projects
and urged that members of the senate
and other interested students offer
their services in areas that interest
them.
Projects mentioned include a report

on undergraduate education, a task
force on consumerism with possible
SCIRE credit, the Course Review
Board, a survey put out by the Dean
of Students office to gather general
data about Stanford students, and a
peace studies-affiliated conference on
University affairs to be held the
second or third week of spring quarter.

have begun circulating petitions to
have fee assessments placed on the
ballot but these will be taken care of
in a later election, according to Barber.
He cited the additional expense of
opening the election to
undergraduates as a major factor in the
senate's decision to keep the election
open to graduates only, explaining
that additional personnel would have
to be hired to staff the voting tables
and tabulate the ballots. He also
mentioned that ballots would have to
be sent to the overseas campuses,
which would delay the results of the
election.
In other business, the senate voted
to approve a resolution supporting
actions to enforce the Santa Clara
County leash law for dogs. Barber
pointed out that senate approval
would signify student approval for
enforcement of the law. He added that
according to Dean of Student Affairs

James W. Lyons, officials have been
reluctant to take action because of
possible student resistance.
The senate voted to schedule
refunds of voluntary fee assessments
for two weeks, beginning Jan. 22.
Refunds will be available from 12 until
4 p.m. every day. Fees that will be
refunded are the voluntary assessments

for the Speakers Bureau, the Special
Events Committee, and the Daily.
ASSU Co-president Brent Appel
presented plans for several projects
and urged that members of the senate
and other interested students offer
their services in areas that interest
them.
Projects mentioned include a report

on undergraduate education, a task
force on consumerism with possible
SCIRE credit, the Course Review
Board, a survey put out by the Dean
of Students office to gather general
data about Stanford students, and a
peace studies-affiliated conference on
University affairs to be held the
second or third week of spring quarter.

SENATE SCENE — ASSU senate chairman Rocky Barber announced plans last night to hold an election Jan. 19 and 20
to fill vacant senate seats.
An election to fill empty seats in
the ASSU senate will be held Jan. 29
and 30, senate chairman Rocky Barber
announced last night, following senate
approval of the election dates.
Also last night, ASSU Co-president
Scott Burke announced that he has
scheduled a press conference for 1
p.m. today. Burke said that he would
make three separate announcements
relating to ASSU and University
politics.
The senate voted unanimously to
approve the dates suggested by the
Rules Committee for the election,
which will fill graduate seats in
Education, Medicine, Humanities and
Sciences, and Engineering and Earth
Sciences.
As these are the seats open for
election, the election will be for
graduate students only. Some groups
have begun circulating petitions to
have fee assessments placed on the
ballot but these will be taken care of
in a later election, according to Barber.
