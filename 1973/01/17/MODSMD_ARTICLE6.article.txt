## Shopping Center 
### 
University officials unveiled preliminary plans for a rather
ambitious expansion of the Stanford Shopping Center at a meeting
last month attended by 75 civic and local governmental leaders.
Architects sub-contracted by a Maryland development firm engaged
by Stanford proposed connection of the Macy's and Saks-Bullock's
sites with a pedestrian mall lined with shops, and suggested that much
of the present shopping center parking area be double-decked.
Architect Peter Kamnitzer proposed that housing units be placed
within the new shopping area and he urged Stanford to consider a mix
of land uses often thought incompatible.
First, we commend University land development officials for
holding a meeting of local leaders to unveil their preliminary sketches,
rather than presenting completed plans to the community as a fait
accompli. Of course, this is valuable only if the suggestions made at
the meeting - both favorable and unfavorable — are taken into
account in the more detailed planning now underway.
Second, we congratulate Kamnitzer and his associates for a
preliminary plan that is unusually imaginative and innovative.
Kamnitzer appears willing to flout some of the conventions of
architecture and planning which have governed much of the nation's
development in the last few decades. We hope that this element does
not disappear as the plans become formalized.
We also hope that the plans contain, as Kamnitzer suggested,
housing units, a sizeable number of which would be earmarked for
persons of low and moderate income. This is particularly important
now that the Frenchman's Terrace project is in financial limbo. The
moratorium on federal assistance for low/moderate income housing
will not make that pressing problem go away. The freeze makes
necessary serious effort on the part of University and municipal
officials to explore all possible ways of providing subsidized housing.
On a more fundamental level, however, we have our doubts about
expansion. We have not to date been overwhelmed by the evidence
that the Stanford Shopping Center is in relative decline in comparison
to other, newer centers. And evidence that the new development
would reverse this trend, if indeed it is a trend, is also lacking. We
would like to see the need demonstrated in as impressive a way as the
proposed solution has been.
The financial condition of private higher education is certainly an
argument in favor of income-producing development of University
lands. It is not, however, an argument in favor of this or any other
specific scheme of development. Someday, the negative externalities
- physical and social - that accompany land development may negate
all the advantages it has provided for Stanford and its neighbors.
For by no means the first time, Stanford has defined the affected
surrounding community to consist of Palo Alto and Menlo Park. For
by no means the first time, it needs to broaden its vision. Stanford
economically affects a much wider area in a significant way.
We have grave doubts about the proposal to relocate Quarry Road
to the edge of the Arboretum, and to commit to development the
open field behind Hoover Pavilion hospital. This goes directly against
the recommendations of the 1971 Livingston-Blayney survey of
Stanford lands, and we agree with Livingston-Blayney that "once
further intrusions into the Arboretum commenced, there would be no
logical cut-off line."
It is far too early to pass judgment on what are only preliminary
sketches. But we feel this is the proper time to raise questions about
the proposals. We hope that University officials and the consultants
they have retained will consider long and hard the advantages and
disadvantages, financial and otherwise, to all concerned — not just to
the University and Palo Alto — of these proposals. We hope that they
continue to seek — and make use of — the opinions of those affected.
The burden of proof is Stanford's.

proposed solution has been.
The financial condition of private higher education is certainly an
argument in favor of income-producing development of University
lands. It is not, however, an argument in favor of this or any other
specific scheme of development. Someday, the negative externalities
- physical and social - that accompany land development may negate
all the advantages it has provided for Stanford and its neighbors.
For by no means the first time, Stanford has defined the affected
surrounding community to consist of Palo Alto and Menlo Park. For
by no means the first time, it needs to broaden its vision. Stanford
economically affects a much wider area in a significant way.
We have grave doubts about the proposal to relocate Quarry Road
to the edge of the Arboretum, and to commit to development the
open field behind Hoover Pavilion hospital. This goes directly against
the recommendations of the 1971 Livingston-Blayney survey of
Stanford lands, and we agree with Livingston-Blayney that "once
further intrusions into the Arboretum commenced, there would be no
logical cut-off line."
It is far too early to pass judgment on what are only preliminary
sketches. But we feel this is the proper time to raise questions about
the proposals. We hope that University officials and the consultants
they have retained will consider long and hard the advantages and
disadvantages, financial and otherwise, to all concerned — not just to
the University and Palo Alto — of these proposals. We hope that they
continue to seek — and make use of — the opinions of those affected.
The burden of proof is Stanford's.
University officials unveiled preliminary plans for a rather
ambitious expansion of the Stanford Shopping Center at a meeting
last month attended by 75 civic and local governmental leaders.
Architects sub-contracted by a Maryland development firm engaged
by Stanford proposed connection of the Macy's and Saks-Bullock's
sites with a pedestrian mall lined with shops, and suggested that much
of the present shopping center parking area be double-decked.
Architect Peter Kamnitzer proposed that housing units be placed
within the new shopping area and he urged Stanford to consider a mix
of land uses often thought incompatible.
First, we commend University land development officials for
holding a meeting of local leaders to unveil their preliminary sketches,
rather than presenting completed plans to the community as a fait
accompli. Of course, this is valuable only if the suggestions made at
the meeting - both favorable and unfavorable — are taken into
account in the more detailed planning now underway.
Second, we congratulate Kamnitzer and his associates for a
preliminary plan that is unusually imaginative and innovative.
Kamnitzer appears willing to flout some of the conventions of
architecture and planning which have governed much of the nation's
development in the last few decades. We hope that this element does
not disappear as the plans become formalized.
We also hope that the plans contain, as Kamnitzer suggested,
housing units, a sizeable number of which would be earmarked for
persons of low and moderate income. This is particularly important
now that the Frenchman's Terrace project is in financial limbo. The
moratorium on federal assistance for low/moderate income housing
will not make that pressing problem go away. The freeze makes
necessary serious effort on the part of University and municipal
officials to explore all possible ways of providing subsidized housing.
On a more fundamental level, however, we have our doubts about
expansion. We have not to date been overwhelmed by the evidence
that the Stanford Shopping Center is in relative decline in comparison
to other, newer centers. And evidence that the new development
would reverse this trend, if indeed it is a trend, is also lacking. We
would like to see the need demonstrated in as impressive a way as the
proposed solution has been.
