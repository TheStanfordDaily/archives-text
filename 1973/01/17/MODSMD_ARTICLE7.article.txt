## Did Nixon Have Right To Bomb? 
### 
_ pan 1 n. mccloskey jr.

This is the first of a series of
newsletters I hope to write for the
Stanford Daily, to report to the
Stanford University community
on matters currently before the
Congress.
I had every hope that the 93rd
Congress would open with the
disabling issue of Vietnam behind
us. .. that we could move on to
constructive solutions of domestic
problems such as tax reform,
housing, health care and the
energy crisis.
Unfortunately, this is not the
case. Since we convened on Jan.
3, the energies, discussions and
efforts of most Members have
been devoted primarily to
Vietnam and the issues raised by
the President's decision to bomb
civilian targets in North Vietnam
during the Christmas holidays.
These issues are three in number.
Two of them touch on the basic

constitutional relationship
between Congress and the
Executive.
First, when Congress has
expressly withdrawn the authority
to fight in Vietnam (by repeal of
the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution
two years ago) did the President
have the power to bomb civilian
targets, admittedly not for
military purposes but for political
purposes? Should not
Congressional approval have been
obtained under the Constitution's
provision that only Congress can
declare war?
Second, why isn't the Congress
able to get full and complete
briefings from the Executive on
the extent and nature of the
bombing and the reasons
therefore? The Defense
Department first denied and then
finally admitted that the Bach Mai
Hospital and other civilian targets

had been hit. Woodside resident
Joan Baez reports that the
950-bed hospital (Palo
Alto-Stanford Hospital has 618
beds) was totally destroyed.
Clearly, neither the Pentagon nor
the White House is willing to tell
Congress the truth or, in some
cases, even testify before the
Congress.
The third issue is, of course,
the moral one: Should-the world's
most powerful nation for any
reason be using the heaviest
bombing in history against civilian
areas of a small nation?
On all three of these issues,
significant numbers of
congressmen who were former
hawks have been coming forward
to say that it is time to draw the
line, and to re-establish
congressional authority. The
bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong
was the catalyst for this new
congressional initiative.
Political Bombing
The purpose of the bombing
was admittedly political—to
punish the North Vietnamese for
their refusal to agree to several
"matters of clarification" of the
nine point draft agreement
reached between Henry Kissinger
and Le Due Tho in October.
The crucial point of that
agreement was point five—the
reunification of Vietnam as a
single country. This has been the
major goal of the North
Vietnamese since reunification
was promised them in the 1954
Geneva Accords. It was South
Vietnamese Premier Thieu's
intransigence on this point that
apparently persuaded President
Nixon to back away from the
Kissinger-approved draft
agreement. As Kissinger said, "We
have not reached an agreement
which the President feels to be
fair and just."
This, of course, raises the
fundamental question of whether
the President alone should
determine what is fair and just
when Congress last fall enacted

into law (Public Law 92-156) a
national policy which makes
return of the POW's the sole
condition of American withdrawal
from Vietnam. At the time, the
President responded that he felt
there should be two conditions of
any peace agreement, the second
being the preservation of an
independent South Vietnam.
Senate Opposition
Will Congress finally override
the President on this point? The
Senate obviously will; there was a
net gain of four anti-war votes in
the Senate in the last election, and
several Senators such as Bill Saxbe
(R—Ohio) and Howard Cannon
D—Nev.) are changing positions.
The real question is in the
House. At least a third of the
House Republicans disapproved of
the bombing; when I introduced a
resolution to deny further
bombing without prior
congressional authority, there was
considerably more support than
last year. We anticipate that a
coalition of 175 Democrats and
45 Republicans would be
necessary to cut off funds, and
there is increasing indication that
we will have such a coalition if the
President is unable to achieve a
negotiated settlement in the next
30 to 60 days.
Ordinarily it would require 60
to 90 days before Committees can
be organized and an appropriate
resolution debated and passed,
but the threat of such action may
conceivably affect the President's
negotiating posture in Paris.
Certainly he can obtain peace at
any time if he will agree to the
original nine-point agreement. If
he has not done so in 90 days, it
begins to look as if at long last
there may be a majority in both
houses of Congress to cut off
funds for the war. I will hope to
report further progress on this
issue in a week or two.
