Today In The 'Daily'
Good morning. Today is Thursday, January 18, 1973.
On this date in 1733, the world caught its first glimpse of a
polar bear, on exhibit in Boston.
Also in 1778, the English explorer, Captain James Cook,
discovered the Hawaiian Islands, also known as the Sandwich
Islands.
If you catch sight of a good news lead, call our News office
at 321-2300, ext. 4632. They'll print the bear facts.
If you want to explore new sales markets, discover our

Staff members are reminded to come to staff lunch today to
see our candidates on exhibit for next volume's editor-in-chief.
Election will be held Friday.
