# Federal Suit Claims GSB Dean 'Conspirator' In Price-Fix Case
## 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
Dean Arjay Miller of the Graduate
School of Business was ' named
yesterday in a government bill of
particulars charging the "Big Three"
automakers with price-fixing and
attempting to establish a mutual
assistance agreement for dealing with
labor difficulties.
Detroit U.S. District Court Judge
John Feikens ordered the 240-page
document, part of a civil suit filed
against two of the companies by the
Justice Department, made public over
industry objections.
Contacted in New York City last
night, Miller told the Daily he had not
heard of the legal action, but flatly
denied any price fixing charges.
"At no time in the auto industry
were prices ever discussed among the
three competitors," he said.
'Co-Conspirator'
Miller, former president of Ford
Motors, was named as a
"co-conspirator" — but not a
defendant — in the suit. The Justice
Department claimed that he
participated in some or all of seven
"summit meetings" involving officials
of Ford Motors, General Motors, and
Chrysler Corp. between Oct. 1, 1969
and Sept. 9, 1970 — after he had
become Dean of the Business School.
Chrysler was named as a

"co-conspirator" in the case, as were
several prominent industry officials —
including Henry Ford 11, former GM
Chairman James Roche, and Chrysler
Chairman Lynn Townsend.
Only Ford Motors and General
Motors are actually named as
defendants.
Alleged Price-Fixing
The government's suit charges that
the three corporations attempted to
fix prices-for their fleet customers —
entities such as governments and
police forces that buy large numbers
of autos.
The bill of particulars also says the
three companies tried to arrange a
mutual aid pact in case any of them
were hit by strikes, despite the fact
that they were not "parties to the
same [labor] agreement." However,
the bill of particulars is not part of the
legal charges filed against the two
firms.
Miller said last night that it was
"standard practice" in
government-filed civil suits to name all
major officials of defendant
corporations.
Still A Director
At the time the alleged meetings
took place, Miller had already
relinquished the Ford presidency.
However, he was — and still is — a
member of the firm's board of

directors. He is also on the board of
the Washington Post Co.
Miller said last night that he was
not sure exactly what the litigation
pertained to, but does not believe that
it is "a big thing."
He said that allegations of industry
impropriety had "no basis at all."
Unable To Join
According to the bill of particulars,
Chrysler Chairman Townsend told
Ford and Roche at a May 12, 1970

meeting that his company would
probably be unable to join the other
two in a mutual assistance pact
because of Chrysler's weakened
financial condition.
"Less than 10 days later," the
government alleged, "both General
Motors and Ford announced the lifting
of cost pressures on Chrysler when
they both announced the elimination
of substantial reduction in price
concessions to invite Chrysler to join
them in the unlawful agreement."
Responding to the mutual
assistance pact disclosure, the
executive board of the United Auto
Workers called the government's
allegations "not surprising."
Miller, 56, replaced Ernest C.
Arbuckle as Dean of the GSB on July
1, 1969. Miller was Ford president
from 1964 until 1968, when he
became the corporation's vice
chairman. He was an employee of
Ford for 23 years before coming here.
Attorneys for Ford and GM tried
unsuccessfully yesterday to keep the
government's bill of particulars from
being made public.

mutual aid pact in case any of them
were hit by strikes, despite the fact
that they were not "parties to the
same [labor] agreement." However,
the bill of particulars is not part of the
legal charges filed against the two
firms.
Miller said last night that it was
"standard practice" in
government-filed civil suits to name all
major officials of defendant
corporations.
Still A Director
At the time the alleged meetings
took place, Miller had already
relinquished the Ford presidency.
However, he was — and still is — a
member of the firm's board of

directors. He is also on the board of
the Washington Post Co.
Miller said last night that he was
not sure exactly what the litigation
pertained to, but does not believe that
it is "a big thing."
He said that allegations of industry
impropriety had "no basis at all."
Unable To Join
According to the bill of particulars,
Chrysler Chairman Townsend told
Ford and Roche at a May 12, 1970

meeting that his company would
probably be unable to join the other
two in a mutual assistance pact
because of Chrysler's weakened
financial condition.
"Less than 10 days later," the
government alleged, "both General
Motors and Ford announced the lifting
of cost pressures on Chrysler when
they both announced the elimination
of substantial reduction in price
concessions to invite Chrysler to join
them in the unlawful agreement."
Responding to the mutual
assistance pact disclosure, the
executive board of the United Auto
Workers called the government's
allegations "not surprising."
Miller, 56, replaced Ernest C.
Arbuckle as Dean of the GSB on July
1, 1969. Miller was Ford president
from 1964 until 1968, when he
became the corporation's vice
chairman. He was an employee of
Ford for 23 years before coming here.
Attorneys for Ford and GM tried
unsuccessfully yesterday to keep the
government's bill of particulars from
being made public.
Dean Arjay Miller of the Graduate
School of Business was ' named
yesterday in a government bill of
particulars charging the "Big Three"
automakers with price-fixing and
attempting to establish a mutual
assistance agreement for dealing with
labor difficulties.
Detroit U.S. District Court Judge
John Feikens ordered the 240-page
document, part of a civil suit filed
against two of the companies by the
Justice Department, made public over
industry objections.
Contacted in New York City last
night, Miller told the Daily he had not
heard of the legal action, but flatly
denied any price fixing charges.
"At no time in the auto industry
were prices ever discussed among the
three competitors," he said.
'Co-Conspirator'
Miller, former president of Ford
Motors, was named as a
"co-conspirator" — but not a
defendant — in the suit. The Justice
Department claimed that he
participated in some or all of seven
"summit meetings" involving officials
of Ford Motors, General Motors, and
Chrysler Corp. between Oct. 1, 1969
and Sept. 9, 1970 — after he had
become Dean of the Business School.
Chrysler was named as a

"co-conspirator" in the case, as were
several prominent industry officials —
including Henry Ford 11, former GM
Chairman James Roche, and Chrysler
Chairman Lynn Townsend.
Only Ford Motors and General
Motors are actually named as
defendants.
Alleged Price-Fixing
The government's suit charges that
the three corporations attempted to
fix prices-for their fleet customers —
entities such as governments and
police forces that buy large numbers
of autos.
The bill of particulars also says the
three companies tried to arrange a
mutual aid pact in case any of them
were hit by strikes, despite the fact
that they were not "parties to the
same [labor] agreement." However,
the bill of particulars is not part of the
legal charges filed against the two
firms.
