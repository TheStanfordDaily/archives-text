# German self-destruction
## The 						White Rose Resistance 
### 
Charles drekmeier

The let-up in the massive and
merciless bombing may, or may
not, be a prelude to a cease fire in
Vietnam. It is more certain that
an election or inauguration is
more apt to inspire the
humanitarian sentiments of the
Nixon Administration than the
destruction of civilian
populations.
We find ourselves increasingly
isolated in the world, fighting for
political principles which the war
itself denies. Looking at ourselves
we begin to wonder if our
emotional and intellectual
faculties are any longer a match
for the incredible productive and
destructive powers of which we
are capable. Even if moral outrage
had a place in our kind of society,
most of us would find ourselves
unable to comprehend the
enormity of the industrial mass
production of corpses or our own
responsibility in the assembly line
(research labs, placement centers,
and all the rest).
Thirty years ago the struggle
against infamy took more courage

than imagination. We are not
where the students and professors
of the University of Munich were
in January 1943, although that
day may come. Modem industrial
societies need not be mobilized in
such ways and protections are still
available to us. But in moral
matters history may be helpful to
the imagination. It is worth
recalling the spirit of the White
Rose.
Lack Of Courage
The White Rose was a small
resistance group—a mere handful
of Munich students, resentful of
the acquiescence of German
educators, and one professor of
philosophy. The group distributed
thousands of leaflets condemning
the regime and calling on the
German people to rise against
Hitler. Before her execution,
Sophie Scholl told the People's
Court that "what we have written
and said is in the minds of all of
you, but you lack the courage to
say it aloud."
Dietrich Bracher, in his study
of the German dictatorship,
remarks that this declaration
"sums up the situation of the
German universities; they
remained silent to the very end,
despite growing criticism, despite
the arrest and murder of students,
despite the injustices and lies that
engulfed them." The students and
faculty of Munich did not even
petition for the pardon of the
White Rose.
Although there is considerable
evidence that discontent was
widespread in the universities,

almost all retreated; the Nazis
were able to depend on the
continued cooperation of the
specialists they so much needed.
Here are some excerpts from
the leaflets:
"Why tell you all these things,
since you are fully aware of
them—or if not of these, then of
other equally grave crimes
committed by this frightful
sub-humanity? Because here we
touch on a problem which
involves us deeply and forces us
all to take thought. Why do the
German people behave so
apathetically in the face of all
these abominable crimes—crimes
so unworthy of the human race?
Hardly anyone thinks about that.
It is accepted as fact and put out
of mind.
.. Is this a sign that the
Germans are brutalized in their
simplest human feelings, that no
chord within them cries out at the
sight of such deeds, that they have
sunk into a fatal conscienceless
ness from which they will never,
never awake? ... [The German]
must evidence not only sympathy;
no, much more: a sense of
complicity in guilt. For through
his apathetic behavior he gives
these evil men the opportunity to
act as they do; he 'tolerates' this
government which has taken upon
itself such an infinitely great
burden of guilt; indeed, he himself
is to blame for the fact that it
came about at all!"

German people behave so
apathetically in the face of all
these abominable crimes—crimes
so unworthy of the human race?
Hardly anyone thinks about that.
It is accepted as fact and put out
of mind.
.. Is this a sign that the
Germans are brutalized in their
simplest human feelings, that no
chord within them cries out at the
sight of such deeds, that they have
sunk into a fatal conscienceless
ness from which they will never,
never awake? ... [The German]
must evidence not only sympathy;
no, much more: a sense of
complicity in guilt. For through
his apathetic behavior he gives
these evil men the opportunity to
act as they do; he 'tolerates' this
government which has taken upon
itself such an infinitely great
burden of guilt; indeed, he himself
is to blame for the fact that it
came about at all!"

The let-up in the massive and
merciless bombing may, or may
not, be a prelude to a cease fire in
Vietnam. It is more certain that
an election or inauguration is
more apt to inspire the
humanitarian sentiments of the
Nixon Administration than the
destruction of civilian
populations.
We find ourselves increasingly
isolated in the world, fighting for
political principles which the war
itself denies. Looking at ourselves
we begin to wonder if our
emotional and intellectual
faculties are any longer a match
for the incredible productive and
destructive powers of which we
are capable. Even if moral outrage
had a place in our kind of society,
most of us would find ourselves
unable to comprehend the
enormity of the industrial mass
production of corpses or our own
responsibility in the assembly line
(research labs, placement centers,
and all the rest).
Thirty years ago the struggle
against infamy took more courage

than imagination. We are not
where the students and professors
of the University of Munich were
in January 1943, although that
day may come. Modem industrial
societies need not be mobilized in
such ways and protections are still
available to us. But in moral
matters history may be helpful to
the imagination. It is worth
recalling the spirit of the White
Rose.
Lack Of Courage
The White Rose was a small
resistance group—a mere handful
of Munich students, resentful of
the acquiescence of German
educators, and one professor of
philosophy. The group distributed
thousands of leaflets condemning
the regime and calling on the
German people to rise against
Hitler. Before her execution,
Sophie Scholl told the People's
Court that "what we have written
and said is in the minds of all of
you, but you lack the courage to
say it aloud."
Dietrich Bracher, in his study
of the German dictatorship,
remarks that this declaration
"sums up the situation of the
German universities; they
remained silent to the very end,
despite growing criticism, despite
the arrest and murder of students,
despite the injustices and lies that
engulfed them." The students and
faculty of Munich did not even
petition for the pardon of the
White Rose.
Although there is considerable
evidence that discontent was
widespread in the universities,

almost all retreated; the Nazis
were able to depend on the
continued cooperation of the
specialists they so much needed.
Here are some excerpts from
the leaflets:
"Why tell you all these things,
since you are fully aware of
them—or if not of these, then of
other equally grave crimes
committed by this frightful
sub-humanity? Because here we
touch on a problem which
involves us deeply and forces us
all to take thought. Why do the
German people behave so
apathetically in the face of all
these abominable crimes—crimes
so unworthy of the human race?
