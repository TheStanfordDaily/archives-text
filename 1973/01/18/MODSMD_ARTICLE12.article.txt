No 'Corruption' Charged
Editor:
In his otherwise excellent
summary of some current FPAG
concerns (Daily, Jan. 16), Bob
Bone implied that we have
characterized the Stanford judicial
process as "corrupt." Perhaps
others have said so, but not
FPAG. We have felt various
grievance, disciplinary and judicial
procedures at Stanford for
faculty, staff and students have
been unfair, authoritarian and
insufficiently protective of civil
liberties and constitutional rights,
but have never called either the
procedures or individuals
administering them "corrupt."

'Stercoraceous Abuse'
Editor:
A few days ago I had my first
opportunity to read the Stanford
Daily in many years. While it was
enjoyable to renew an old
acquaintance, I trust that the issue
of January fourth was not
representative of what the Daily
has become. I refer to the
editorial concerning Vietnam, and
to a column titled "Peace Is Not
At Hand." Both were little more
than intemperate personal attacks
on President Nixon for his policies
in Vietnam.
The editorial contained such
language as "The same kind of
deceit, cruelty and maniacal
egotism that characterized
Nixon's first administration ..
and .. one of the most
treacherous acts of aggression in
history." In "Peace Is Not At
Hand" we are told that the NLF's
revolution is "strikingly similar to
the American revolution of
1776."
Perhaps it is churlish to fault
the author for his ignorance of the
American revolution when he is
also so demonstrably ignorant of
the meaning of independence. I
quote: "The stronger the NLF,
the more likely Vietnam will be
an independent nation."
Neither piece was even slightly
tempered by any suggestion that
our President was courageous, or
even well-meaning, or that he may
have indeed believed that peace
was "at hand," and been
disappointed. Or that the rulers of
North Vietnam were in any
measure responsible for failure of
the negotiations.
Unfortunately, such
incandescent and unpatriotic
drivel reflects not just about its
authors, but upon the University
as well. It is in no sense necessary
for one to agree with Mr. Nixon's
policies in order to be repelled by
such crazed attacks upon him.
The intellectual disarray which
brings about the substitution of
stercoraceous abuse for civilized
discourse is always apparent, and
must not be associated with any
institution of learning. Even
Stanford.

Housing Program
'Inefficient'
Editor:
Your recent editorial on
"Frenchman's Freeze" raises two
distinct issues. 1 can only applaud
your alarm over strengthening the
federal executive branch at the
expense of the legislature. It is
indeed refreshing that, since the
advent of the undeclared war in
Vietnam, not only crusty old
conservatives are concerned over
this matter.
Regarding the desirability of
continuing current housing
programs, however, you seriously
misjudge the costs of suspending
them. I have recently estimated
that because of inefficiency in the
form of the public housing
program, five units could have
been built for the same cost to the
economy for every four actually
built!
Federal housing programs have
provided housing for 10 percent
or less of the lower income
population. Those fortunate
enough to gain admittance to
housing projects have been housed
very well relative to other lower
income families. Had the federal
funds been more properly
appropriated, twice as many
members of the lower income
population could have been
served. The average benefit to
members of the lower income
population is thus only about half
of what it might have been had
federal programs been more
efficiently designed. For this
reason, the ground lost by a two
year suspension of current
programs could be made up
within roughly an additional two
years by replacing current
programs by better ones.
These considerations apply
equally to Frenchman's Terrace.
If Stanford were to lease the site
for this project to the highest
private bidder and use the
proceeds to provide scholarships
to young men and women from
poor families, it is almost
certainly the case that the benefits
produced would exceed those of
Frenchman's Terrace.

'Dog' Edit Welcome
Editor:
BRAVO! The editorial in the
Jan. 10 Daily about the campus
dog problem was long overdue,
but very welcome. Not only is the
presence of animals in and around
a food service facility against
county and state health
regulations and lease laws, but it is
also potentially dangerous to
patrons and costly due to broken
dishes and labor for clean-up.
As a food service manager, I
have been directly involved in this
problem. As a dog owner, I am
aware of a dog's need for exercise
and desire for food. But a public
eating facility is no place for
animals, especially when they are
allowed to run loose.
Isn't it time we all got together
to correct this problem?
