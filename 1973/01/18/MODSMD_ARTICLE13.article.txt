# 'we shall overcome'
## The 						Late Martin Luther King Jr.

Jan. 15, 1929 was the
beginning of a new Era in the
history of Black America. On this
day began the life of the greatest
Black man ever involved in the
struggle for civil rights. What
manner of man was the late Rev.
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr?
Maybe these next few lines will
allow a clearer perception of this
extraordinary Black man.
"Certainly a great revolution is
going on in our world today. It is
taking out an old order, and
bringing in a new order.
"The patience of an oppressed
people cannot forever endure. We
know through painful experience
that freedom is never voluntarily
given by the oppressor; it must be
demanded by the oppressed."
Precious memories are
attributed to the philosophy of
the late Dr. King. His relentless
struggles exemplify his
commitment to persistent struggle
for peace.
Familiarity
"For years now I have heard
the word 'wait.' It rings in the ear
of every Negro with a piercing
familiarity. This 'Wait' has always
meant 'Never.' It has been a
tranquilizing thalidomide relieving
the emotional stress for a moment
only to give birth to an ill-formed
infant of frustration."
We must come to see with the
distinguished jurist of yesterday
that "justice too long delayed is
justice denied."
Dr. King's life mirrored the
beliefs that one must adamantly

protestâ€”one must struggle, resist,
struggle.
"If he puts you in jail you go
in that jail and transform it from a
dungeon of shame to a haven of
dignity. Even if he tries to kill
you, you develop the inner
conviction that there are some
things so dear, some things so
precious, some things so eternally
true that are worth dying for. And
I SUBMIT to you that if a man
hasn't discovered something
worth dying for he isn't fit to
live."
No Halt To Progress
Dr. King's lifelong
commitment to the struggle led to
many integrated lunch counters
and schools. Many died in the line
of achieving these goals.
Incarceration did not prevent the
progress of the movement of Dr.
King.
"Now there is a magnificent
new militancy within the Negro
community all across this nation.
And I welcome this as a marvelous
development. The Negro of
America is saying he's determined
to be free and he is militant
enough to stand up."
This "new militancy" of the
'60s was unprecedented in terms
of racial advancements. The
determination and consistency of
Dr. King led to the persistent
struggles in the South.
Freedom Fighter
Racial injustice was exposed
and eradicated. Dr. Martin Luther
King Jr. stood as America's
beloved freedom fighter. Many

vaguely remember the great works
of Dr. King. Very few are able to
capture the intensity of his impact
on Black America.
As one reporter stated, "The
world will never be the same
without Dr. King." The late Dr.
King stated that "We shall
overcome."
"We all have a date with
destiny." Dr. King had been to
The Mountain top and had seen
the glory. His dream was
internalized by the fate of an

assassin's bullet But his memory
remains firmly implanted in the
minds and hearts of many. Three
words remind me of Dr. King's
philosophical approach to life.
These words are, ALL HERE,
AND NOW! To paraphrase:
WE WANT ALL OUR
RIGHTS,
WE WANT THEM HERE,
WE WANT THEM NOW.
Dare to struggle, dare to win.
