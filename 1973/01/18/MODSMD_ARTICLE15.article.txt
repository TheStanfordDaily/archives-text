# Mothershead Thrives On Involvement
## 
### JEANNE KELLER 
Professor of Philosophy,
member of innumerable
University committees (even his
secretary doesn't have a complete
listing), and intensely devoted to
his students, John Leland
Mothershead purposely takes on a
problem most professors just as
purposefully avoid: how to
prepare satisfactorily for at least
one five-unit lecture course each
quarter; take on demanding
Faculty Senate and Departmental
committee assignments (most
recently he was chairman of the
Search Committee for a new Dean
of the Chapel); help formulate the
senate policy on Academic
Freedom; complete a book he
started writing a few years ago;
spend a weekend or two at his
cabin in Mendocino County
"He really takes on more than
his share," said Philosophy
Department colleague Philip H.
Rhinelander. "He's always busy."
"Maybe he feels a dedication
to Stanford. He's been connected
with the institution for a good
many years," Philosophy
Emeritus Prof. John D. Goheen
pointed out.
Philosophy Major
Mothershead, born in
Indianapolis and raised in
Pasadena, came to Stanford in
1926 to begin his undergraduate
studies. "I loafed through the first
three years," he remembers. "I
was a perfunctory philosophy
major." It was under the influence
of Prof. Henry Waldgrave Stuart,
said Mothershead, that he actively
developed his interest in the
subject.
Thus, Mothershead is acutely
aware of the importance of the
student-teacher relationship. A

charter member of the
Student-Faculty Relations
Committee in 1954, he has always
worked diligently to strengthen
ties between professors and their
students. Given the prestigious
Lloyd W. Dinkelspiel Award in
1964, Mothershead was lauded for
his "contribution to intellectual
enthusiasm and breadth of
outlook through years of brilliant
and effective lectures on
philosophy to thousands of
undergraduates."
The student occupies the most
important position in academe,
according to Mothershead. The
1966 Stanford Quad quoted him
as saying, "Much has been written
lately about the improvement of
the Stanford faculty. The
improvement of the student body
deserves equal emphasis.
Student-faculty relations are
improving because the students
now are more interesting to be
with than those of a
quarter-century ago."
Mothershead noted that
although he has given the same
introductory course in philosophy
during that quarter-century, if he
were to deliver the same lectures
today that he used 20 years ago,
they would be unbearably
elementary and boring to the
undergraduates.
He judges the difficulty of his
lectures "by looking at the faces
in the auditorium. If too many
have puzzled looks, I slow down
and go over the main points
again." When the students
understand, "I can watch the
lights go on in their faces."
Mothershead delights in watching
the lights go on. "I like the
challenge of teaching," he said.
He also enjoys challenging his

students. After winning the
Dinkelspiel Award he was quoted
by the Stanford Review (Jan.-Feb.
1965) as saying, "I find it exciting
to bully young people into
thinking for themselves." He still
feels this way, and his lectures in
Introduction to Philosophy often
force his students to draw their
own conclusions from
philosophical arguments. He will
lecture carefully on a problem,
sometimes presenting both sides
of a question in a dialogue form
("changing hats," he calls it), but
he leaves the resolution in the air.
Mothershead follows his
lecture notes closely, but walks
around the auditorium stage while
elaborating on topics. His props
are simple: a lectern, which
fluctuates between being a
haphazard melting of atoms, a
collection of ideas, and a part of
The Absolute; a blackboard which
he in his conciseness insists upon
calling a greenboard; an eyeglass
case, the object of physics
experiments; and a set of keys,
used in Captain Queeg-like
moments.
He grasps the top edges of the
lectern, resting one foot on the
lower shelf, and peers down at his
notes through his rimless glasses.
Notes, lectern, and Mothershead
become one unit, a conveyer of
information. He reads a few
sentences from the notes, then
quickly moves around to the side
of the lectern, closer to the
students, and explains the
concept.
Fist Waving
Clear ideas and strong
arguments are emphasized with a
fist waving in the air; vague
concepts, weak arguments, and
asides (he calls them footnotes)
are noted by simply stirring the
air with a light hand. When
defining a word, answering a
question, or, of course, explaining
a key point, his hands toy with a
set of keys that appears from his
vest pocket. The eyeglass case is
dropped to demonstrate assumed
"laws" of causality. "Why won't
it float in the air?" he asks. "And
what would we think if it did?"
Comic relief is also employed
in the lecture histrionics. After
explaining a complex proposition
he will often give examples which
the students quickly discover are
not necessarily to be included in
their notes. "There are, of course,
other arguments against the
existence of God," he innocently
begins. "For example: There was
once a very wise old woman who
was believed to know the answers
to all important questions. A man
went to her and asked 'Upon what
does the earth rest?' And the
woman replied 'Upon a rock.' So
the man went back to his hut and
meditated upon this answer."
Mothershead walks to the edge of
the stage, places his foot on the
railing, leans out toward the
students, and continues.
"After a while the man
returned to the wise old woman
and asked 'Upon what does the
rock rest?' And the woman

answered promptly 'Another
rock.' So he went back to
meditate again. He wasn't very
smart, you see. Finally he went
back to the old woman and asked
'Upon what does that rock
rest?' " Mothershead produces the
set of keys from his pocket and
fires out the point of the story:
"The old woman became very
impatient and shouted 'Oh, it's
rocks all the way down!' " The
auditorium erupts with laughter,
and Mothershead elfishly takes
refuge behind the lectern, which
almost conceals him.
Grandfather
Short (about 5'9"),
gray-haired, balding, and
bespectacled, Mothershead looks
like the warm-hearted Midwestern
grandfather visited j by city
children at Thanksgiving in
juvenile storybooks. The
humorous additions to his lectures
have an almost homey quality at
times. In his discussion of theories
of intuitive knowledge he includes
the Anti-Feminist Theory
(women's intuition), the Cardiac
Theory ("In your heart you know
he's right"), and the Osseus
Theory ("I just feel it in my
bones").
Every possible viewpoint, naive
or sophisticated, is presented by
John Mothershead, but in his
"changing hats" he will never
declare any opinion to be more
valid than another. One lecture
was interrupted by a dog who
stopped at the lectern on his way
across the stage and began to tug
on Mothershead's pant leg. "Oh,"
Mothershead sighed with great
disappointment. "I was trying so
hard not to be dogmatic today."
He eagerly entertains
arguments or questions during his
lectures. He is noted by students
and colleagues alike for his
generosity with conference time.
He has office hours daily.
At a university where so much
emphasis is placed on the
publishing professor,
Mothershead's perspective is
unusual: he feels that writing
interferes with his teaching by
taking away time he should
devote instead to his students.
"One good thing abut the
academic ladder," he told the
Stanford News Service in 1965,
"is that once you are a full
professor there's nowhere to go
from there. You don't need to
write just to get promoted. You
can write only what you really
want to say or think needs
saying."
Full Professor
Mothershead's promotion to
full professor in 1955 was closely
followed by the publication of his
Ethics: Modern Conceptions of
the Principles of Right. The
textbook, according to Goheen, is
widely used in Ethics courses.
With Goheen, Mothershead edited
and published a study of the
works of Clarence Irving Lewis, an
instructor of Goheen and
Mothershead at Harvard in the
late thirties.
Another book on ethics is

Mothershead's current project,
but he has time to work on it only
during the summer. "It may turn
out to be another textbook," he
said, "but the point of it is that
the history of ethics is not a waste
of time, and that ethics can be
applied to practical, everyday
decision-making." Mothershead
admits this to his students in his
first lecture: "I do have a bias: I
think that philosophy is a practical
subject."
John Mothershead's decades of
active dedication to Stanford will
end next year when he must
retire, at age 65, in accordance
with university policy. What will
he do then? "Hopefully, I will be
able to finish my book." He will
also have more time for his
hobby, reading. "I started reading
Proust 10 years ago and I haven't
had the time to finish yet."

shown an extraordinary dedication to his students over his more than
25 years of teaching at Stanford. He has ignored the publish or perish
ethic of a university professor, choosing to devote his attention to his
students.
