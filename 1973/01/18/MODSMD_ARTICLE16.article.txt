# Engineering Job Prospects Good
## 
### 
Employment prospects for graduating engineers are bright and
getting brighter, and inside of four years there may be a real shortage,
says William M. Kays, dean of the School of Engineering.
Unemployment in the engineering profession peaked at three
percent (about half the national level of unemployment) in the first
quarter of 1971, and has now declined to less than two percent.
But the publicity flap over engineering unemployment continues to
affect enrollments all over the country, observes Kays. Even at its
peak, unemployment was concentrated in the aerospace and defense
industry he notes.
Engineering enrollments at Stanford, as elsewhere in the country,
were at their highest in the mid-60s, and have been declining ever
since. Freshman engineering enrollment nationally dropped 35
percent since 1967.
Kays suggests that enrollments may now have bottomed out,
leaving the prospect of severe shortages of engineers as soon as 1976,
when demand may be double the supply.
To counter the effects of the bad press engineering has received in
the past five years, Stanford Engineering School has embarked, under
Kays' direction, on a campaign to attract students to the profession.
"We are looking into some alternate routes into engineering," Kays
says."The standard freshman year prescription of five units of math
and five of physics has been a barrier to students not prepared for
those courses, or unwilling to commit that much time to a tentative
professional possibility.
"We may want to develop a way for students to get into
engineering at the freshman level without such a heavy commitment."
At the same time, Kays stresses the importance of work in math
and physics for students who may be interested in technology.
"If students start taking math or physics, they are not necessarily
making a career choice. But the decision not to take these subjects
does mean that a decision is being made to exclude any kind of work
in technology."
The one counter-pressure during the period of declining
enrollments has been a burgeoning interest among students in
environmental issues. Civil engineering enrollments have held up
better than most other areas, since this field is involved with many
environmental problems.
"It's been difficult to be an engineering student in the dorms,"
Kays remarks, "but students who say they're interested in
environmental engineering don't get booed so loudly."
One piece of evidence that technology may be now less of a
boogey than it was five years ago is the burgeoning enrollment in
Stanford's newly instituted interdepartmental program "Values,
Technology and Society."
Another factor which may begin to bring more students to the
Engineering School is the national employment picture. "I do sense an
increased interest among undergraduates in professional careers," says
Kays. "It is simply reality that a student can get a job — a good job —
with a bachelor's degree in engineering."
Starting salaries for such graduates this year were about $925 a
month, and job prospects were good. After graduation last June, only
two out of 113 Stanford B.S.'s in engineering were still looking for a
job.

In addition to developing changes in the engineering undergraduate
program, the Engineering School is attempting to alter its traditional
image as an all-male bastion. A just-published brochure, called
Consider the Possibility features some of Stanford's 90 women
engineering students. It is being distributed to women high school
students and Stanford applicants, to persuade them that engineering is
a viable career alternative for women, as well as men."
"Technology is a very satisfying thing," says Kays, who hopes that
more and more students will begin to agree with him.

"It's been difficult to be an engineering student in the dorms,"
Kays remarks, "but students who say they're interested in
environmental engineering don't get booed so loudly."
One piece of evidence that technology may be now less of a
boogey than it was five years ago is the burgeoning enrollment in
Stanford's newly instituted interdepartmental program "Values,
Technology and Society."
Another factor which may begin to bring more students to the
Engineering School is the national employment picture. "I do sense an
increased interest among undergraduates in professional careers," says
Kays. "It is simply reality that a student can get a job — a good job —
with a bachelor's degree in engineering."
Starting salaries for such graduates this year were about $925 a
month, and job prospects were good. After graduation last June, only
two out of 113 Stanford B.S.'s in engineering were still looking for a
job.

In addition to developing changes in the engineering undergraduate
program, the Engineering School is attempting to alter its traditional
image as an all-male bastion. A just-published brochure, called
Consider the Possibility features some of Stanford's 90 women
engineering students. It is being distributed to women high school
students and Stanford applicants, to persuade them that engineering is
a viable career alternative for women, as well as men."
"Technology is a very satisfying thing," says Kays, who hopes that
more and more students will begin to agree with him.
Employment prospects for graduating engineers are bright and
getting brighter, and inside of four years there may be a real shortage,
says William M. Kays, dean of the School of Engineering.
Unemployment in the engineering profession peaked at three
percent (about half the national level of unemployment) in the first
quarter of 1971, and has now declined to less than two percent.
But the publicity flap over engineering unemployment continues to
affect enrollments all over the country, observes Kays. Even at its
peak, unemployment was concentrated in the aerospace and defense
industry he notes.
Engineering enrollments at Stanford, as elsewhere in the country,
were at their highest in the mid-60s, and have been declining ever
since. Freshman engineering enrollment nationally dropped 35
percent since 1967.
Kays suggests that enrollments may now have bottomed out,
leaving the prospect of severe shortages of engineers as soon as 1976,
when demand may be double the supply.
To counter the effects of the bad press engineering has received in
the past five years, Stanford Engineering School has embarked, under
Kays' direction, on a campaign to attract students to the profession.
"We are looking into some alternate routes into engineering," Kays
says."The standard freshman year prescription of five units of math
and five of physics has been a barrier to students not prepared for
those courses, or unwilling to commit that much time to a tentative
professional possibility.
"We may want to develop a way for students to get into
engineering at the freshman level without such a heavy commitment."
At the same time, Kays stresses the importance of work in math
and physics for students who may be interested in technology.
"If students start taking math or physics, they are not necessarily
making a career choice. But the decision not to take these subjects
does mean that a decision is being made to exclude any kind of work
in technology."
The one counter-pressure during the period of declining
enrollments has been a burgeoning interest among students in
environmental issues. Civil engineering enrollments have held up
better than most other areas, since this field is involved with many
environmental problems.
