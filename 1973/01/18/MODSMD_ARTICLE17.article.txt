# Women's Bias Against Women Challenged
## 
### 
The findings of psychologist
P.A. Goldberg, who suggested that
women are prejudiced against
other women in areas of
intellectual and professional
competence, have been challenged
by the work of Harriet N. Mischel,
lecturer in psychology at
Stanford.
Goldberg's 1967 experiment
involved giving a group of college
women a series of short articles to
evaluate.
The fields which are articles
concerned were chosen on the
basis of male and female
associations â€” law and city
planning are regarded as "male,"
dietetics and primary education as
"female."
The sex of the ascribed author
was arbitrarily varied: John R.
Simpson or Joan R. Simpson.
Goldberg concluded from the
responses that women prefer the
professional articles written by
men, even in traditionally female
fields.
Experiments
Mischel argues, from a series of
experiments in the U.S. and Israel
which duplicated Goldberg's
procedure, that such bias where it
exists is not as simple a
phenomenon as Goldberg
suggests, and can work against
men as well as women.
Stanford men and women
students given this task of
evaluation tended to prefer the
author whose sex is usually
associated with the professional
field in which the article was
written. They preferred male
writers on law and city planning
and, unlike Goldberg's subjects,
female authors on dietetics and
primary education.
In a cross-cultural follow-up,
Mischel discovered that men and
women subjects in Israel, both in
a city and on a kibbutz, showed
no sex bias in evaluating writers in
any of the four fields.
Both in their general
philosophy and in the specific

mechanisms of their social
structure, especially in the
kibbutz, Israelis have consciously
sought to eliminate sex prejudice
for many decades. The results of
Mischel's study suggest that this
effort has been successful and that
in a culture in which women do
have more professional
opportunities and are seen as
more nearly equal to men in their
abilities, there may be no
evaluative sex bias.
Greater Variety
Mischel points out that the
availability of, and experience
with, competent women in a
greater variety of fields, in the
army and as head of government,
may break down biases even
though sex role stereotypes
remarkably similar to those in the
U.S. continue to exist.
She relates her findings to
those of another study of
Stanford students which indicates
that the choice of majors is
closely related to male-dominance
in related professional fields.
The study showed that men
students tend to major in
male-dominated and women in
nonmale-donimated fields, thus,
according to Mischel, suggesting
the persistent influence of sex-role
stereotypes among Stanford
students.
"The findings of 'The Stanford
Woman in 1972' and the results of
my research probably reflect in
large part the impact of the

availability of role models of
either sex in a particular
professional field and the
different expectations of success
for men and women in a given
field," Mischel observes.
"In 1972 Stanford women
have broken away from
traditional stereotypes to the
extent that they have more plans
for further education and careers
and do not see themselves in the
future as fully engrossed in the
roles of wife and mother.
"However, even in 1972
women are choosing majors and
making occupational plans which
perpetuate the existence of
predominantly male-dominated
fields and support sex-role
stereotypes. Men still generally
choose male-dominant fields and
women choose female-dominant
fields.
"Stanford students currently
do not seem to be perceiving
equal competence on the part of
males and females in various
fields, and this is reflected in the
unbalanced selection by men and
women of the areas in which they
hope and expect to become
competent.
"The differences in
professional sex bias between
Stanford undergraduates and
Israeli youth suggest that
experience with women who are
successful in fields normatively or
traditionally male-dominated can
change sex bias."
