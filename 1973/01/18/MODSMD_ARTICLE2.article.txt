# University Explains New Policy Regarding Childcare Facilities
## 
### JAMES LOBSENZ 
University Provost William F. Miller
and Vice President Robert R.
Augsburger, in a recently released
policy statement on childcare facilities
at Stanford, have declared that
"Stanford can and should facilitate
workable childcare arrangements for
faculty, staff, and students, but
current data and arguments do not
justify a commitment at this time" to
University participation in the "design,
construction, or management of day
care centers."
The policy statement was issued in
response to a research study
conducted by Dr. Aimee Dorr Leifer.
Leifer, presently an assistant professor
of psychology at Harvard, was hired
by the Faculty Women's Club, and her
study was funded by an anonymous
donor.
Augsburger is quick to point out
that the University's position is not
inflexible or permanent. "We do not
regard childcare as an 'all or none'
question," maintains Augsburger. The
policy of "facilitation" is "appropriate
at this time" and need not affect
"future options of the University."
Facilitation vs Commitment
"Facilitation" differs from a policy
of "commitment" in that a
commitment means "the University
itself is going to provide the services,"
according to Augsburger.
"Facilitation," on the other hand, is a
policy directed towards "exploring
ways of delivering childcare service to
the community."
The difference between a policy of
"facilitation" and a policy of

"commitment" seems to be largely a
difference in degree.
Augsburger and Miller have
outlined a series of actions to be taken
by the University in accordance with a
"facilitation" policy. Their
memorandum directs James Lyons,
Dean of Student Affairs, to coordinate
the University's actions concerning
childcare.
Lyons' office is to serve primarily
as a center for providing information
on the availability of childcare
services.
Financial Problems
The Miller-Augsburger statement
also directs the University to review
any plans for additional housing on
University land that is likely to
increase the demand for childcare
services, and to consider the possibility
of including childcare facilities in
them, as is presently being done in the
Escondido Village apartment complex.
Augsburger maintains that although
"there is clearly a social need" for
childcare facilities, the University is
not convinced that the problem is the
sole responsibility of the University.
He raises the possibility of local, state,
or federal assistance in the matter.
In addition there is the serious
problem of funding the construction
of childcare centers. The
memorandum states that a scarcity of
funds forces them to assign a "low
priority" to "major long-range
financial commitments to community
services."
The Leifer report estimated the
cost of constructing two on-campus
childcare centers at $225,000 initially,

with the additional operational
expense of $45,000 per year.
Severe Need Not Indicated
The University's strongest objection
to a policy of "commitment,"
however, is that the Leifer report has
not indicated a severe need for
childcare facilities. ✓ Augsburger
maintains that at present the
University feels there is inadequate

PLANS ANNOUNCED — ASSU President Scott Burke yesterday announced two
major personal plans for his final three months in office. His plans are to "bring
into being a new judicial system" and "to sensitize the University to the
problems which are faced by the middle class student" by investigating "the
University's financial aid and admission policies so far as they relate to this
group." Burke also announced that he will not run for re-election in the spring,
but will urge present ASSU Co-president Peter Van Petten to lead a Council of
Presidents slate. Said Van Petten, "I'm seriously considering it. I'm not sure
though."
