## Below Paar 
### GEORGE DOBBINS 
ABC recently launched a new barrage of television artillery in its
constant battle to defeat Johnny Carson and secure the late night
scene. The network that gave us "Wide World of Sports" now presents
the "Wide World of Entertainment," featuring movies, rock concerts,
Dick Cavett, and an overpublicized, over rated program called "Jack
Paar Tonite." Sadly, the only way this show has to go is up.
I really looked forward to seeing Jack Paar on television again.
Paar, who originally hosted the 'Tonight Show" back in 1957, spoke
wittily, urbanely and far more intelligently than someone with a mere
10th grade education.
Best of all, he was controversial—not afraid to laugh at a sponsor or
insult a guest. Paar could act charming as well, telling unique stories
and showing rare film footage. His personal qualities made the
pre-Carson "Tonight Show," the first network talk show, a historic
television document.
In 1962, Paar left the "Tonight Show" because of network
censorship. Then, a young comic named Carson took over and has
been number one since. Last week, Paar returned to television in the
hope of reclaiming the "Tonight" audience; unfortunately, he just
wasn't up to Paar.
Old and Rusty
Like the student, who graduates with a BA and, ten years later,
comes back to get a Masters degree, Paar was older, slower and rusty.
The rust seemed permanent. With his hands nervously trembling, Paar
sat on the familiar stool and delivered a terribly unfunny monologue.
Finally, to get a laugh, he told the audience, "I can change to any
subject; what would you like me to change to?"
As the first night progressed, Paar was not only plagued by second
rate material but by circumstances beyond his control. His set was
virtually non-existent. Whereas Carson has a great band and decorative
surroundings, Paar had a barren desk and inaudible musicians.
He tried to show video-tapes and the machine broke. Luckily, it
was repaired to present the best entertainment on the show: movies of
the Paars raising pet tigers and exclusive home movies of the
Kennedys, taken thirty years ago.
Stuck Thermos
Other technical difficulties ran the gamut from poor time
allotment for guests to a thermos that wouldn't open. But Paar
absolved himself of all blame by asking, "Now that we've hired the
handicapped, when are we going to bring the real crew in?"
Speaking of the handicapped, I feel obliged to mention Peggy Cass,
Jack's sidekick, who deserves a kick in the side (among other places).
Described by Paar as an "Old, dear friend," she fluctuates between the
obnoxious and the repulsive, laughs uncontrollably and opens her
mouth when she shouldn't. At least Ed McMahon doesn't muff Alpo
commercials.
If Cass has one redeemable trait, it is that she is trying to get a BA
at NYU, where she is a freshman—excuse us—fresh worn an.
At one point, Paar told her to shut up, but then he was rude to
other guests; his lines didn't come out as funny as he thought they
were. Paar completely cut off Jonathan Winters, by telling him, "1
know you've got to go." "But I don't," Winters retorted. Paar
re-advised that time was up and Winters kindly complied.
'Little Girl'
In another interview, Paar spent half the time criticizing Goldie
Hawn's figure ("You're a little girl everywhere, aren't you?"). Then he
introduced the famous Miss Miller, an elderly woman, whose only
pastime is attending television shows in New York. In very poor taste,
Paar said of the defenseless woman, "This is really Martin Bormann."
Then he advised her rather abruptly, "Some night when no one shows
up, you and I will talk and make money; but in the meantime, go sit
down."
Don't get me wrong. Paar was not rude to each of his first week's
guests. But he didn't succeed as a gracious interviewer either. Paar is
neither mean nor dull by nature, but his program is boring, primarily
because he isn't an entertainer. As he told the audience, "I not only
do nothing but later on I bring out people to do it with me." Ten
years ago, he had no competition; but, now, a talk show host must do
more than exist—he must hold the audience's interest.
Paar's producer describes the program as "completely off the
cuff." Those cuffs need pressing. The show must be smoother and so
well planned that it doesn't look planned. So much for the secret of
Carson.

sat on the familiar stool and delivered a terribly unfunny monologue.
Finally, to get a laugh, he told the audience, "I can change to any
subject; what would you like me to change to?"
As the first night progressed, Paar was not only plagued by second
rate material but by circumstances beyond his control. His set was
virtually non-existent. Whereas Carson has a great band and decorative
surroundings, Paar had a barren desk and inaudible musicians.
He tried to show video-tapes and the machine broke. Luckily, it
was repaired to present the best entertainment on the show: movies of
the Paars raising pet tigers and exclusive home movies of the
Kennedys, taken thirty years ago.
Stuck Thermos
Other technical difficulties ran the gamut from poor time
allotment for guests to a thermos that wouldn't open. But Paar
absolved himself of all blame by asking, "Now that we've hired the
handicapped, when are we going to bring the real crew in?"
Speaking of the handicapped, I feel obliged to mention Peggy Cass,
Jack's sidekick, who deserves a kick in the side (among other places).
Described by Paar as an "Old, dear friend," she fluctuates between the
obnoxious and the repulsive, laughs uncontrollably and opens her
mouth when she shouldn't. At least Ed McMahon doesn't muff Alpo
commercials.
If Cass has one redeemable trait, it is that she is trying to get a BA
at NYU, where she is a freshman—excuse us—fresh worn an.
At one point, Paar told her to shut up, but then he was rude to
other guests; his lines didn't come out as funny as he thought they
were. Paar completely cut off Jonathan Winters, by telling him, "1
know you've got to go." "But I don't," Winters retorted. Paar
re-advised that time was up and Winters kindly complied.
'Little Girl'
In another interview, Paar spent half the time criticizing Goldie
Hawn's figure ("You're a little girl everywhere, aren't you?"). Then he
introduced the famous Miss Miller, an elderly woman, whose only
pastime is attending television shows in New York. In very poor taste,
Paar said of the defenseless woman, "This is really Martin Bormann."
Then he advised her rather abruptly, "Some night when no one shows
up, you and I will talk and make money; but in the meantime, go sit
down."
Don't get me wrong. Paar was not rude to each of his first week's
guests. But he didn't succeed as a gracious interviewer either. Paar is
neither mean nor dull by nature, but his program is boring, primarily
because he isn't an entertainer. As he told the audience, "I not only
do nothing but later on I bring out people to do it with me." Ten
years ago, he had no competition; but, now, a talk show host must do
more than exist—he must hold the audience's interest.
Paar's producer describes the program as "completely off the
cuff." Those cuffs need pressing. The show must be smoother and so
well planned that it doesn't look planned. So much for the secret of
Carson.
ABC recently launched a new barrage of television artillery in its
constant battle to defeat Johnny Carson and secure the late night
scene. The network that gave us "Wide World of Sports" now presents
the "Wide World of Entertainment," featuring movies, rock concerts,
Dick Cavett, and an overpublicized, over rated program called "Jack
Paar Tonite." Sadly, the only way this show has to go is up.
I really looked forward to seeing Jack Paar on television again.
Paar, who originally hosted the 'Tonight Show" back in 1957, spoke
wittily, urbanely and far more intelligently than someone with a mere
10th grade education.
Best of all, he was controversial—not afraid to laugh at a sponsor or
insult a guest. Paar could act charming as well, telling unique stories
and showing rare film footage. His personal qualities made the
pre-Carson "Tonight Show," the first network talk show, a historic
television document.
In 1962, Paar left the "Tonight Show" because of network
censorship. Then, a young comic named Carson took over and has
been number one since. Last week, Paar returned to television in the
hope of reclaiming the "Tonight" audience; unfortunately, he just
wasn't up to Paar.
Old and Rusty
Like the student, who graduates with a BA and, ten years later,
comes back to get a Masters degree, Paar was older, slower and rusty.
The rust seemed permanent. With his hands nervously trembling, Paar
sat on the familiar stool and delivered a terribly unfunny monologue.
Finally, to get a laugh, he told the audience, "I can change to any
subject; what would you like me to change to?"
