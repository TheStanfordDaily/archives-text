Agent Admits Watergate Tie-in
WASHINGTON — A former FBI agent testified yesterday
that he was hired by the security chief for the Republican
National Committee to monitor conversations from the
Democratic National Headquarters.
Alfred C. Baldwin 111 said he was promised by the man,
James W. McCord Jr., that "if the President is re-elected
this November, this is the way to join the team and go up
the ladder."
McCord is one of the two defendants remaining in the
Watergate trial. He and G. Gordon Liddy, once a lawyer
for the President's re-election committee, are charged with
conspiracy, burglary and illegal eavesdropping.
Before Baldwin took the stand, Detective Robert G.
Denell testified that the personal address books of two
men arrested in last June's break-in at Democratic
headquarters at the Watergate carried listings of White
House telephone numbers.
The theory that McCord engaged in spying activities to
protect Republicans against possible demonstrations was
advanced in court Wednesday by McCord's lawyer, Gerald
Alch.
Alch had told newsmen Tuesday that he intended to
put on a defense of "duress and necessity and lack of
criminal intent." The lawyer made it formal yesterday in
submitting a memorandum to that effect to Chief U.S.
District Judge John J. Sirica, who is presiding over the
trial.
Cease-Fire Preparations Continue
SAIGON — Both sides wen; reported preparing for a
Vietnam cease-fire as Gen. Alexander M. Haig Jr.
conferred yesterday with President Nguyen Van Thieu in
an unusual night meeting apparently called because of
still-unresolved political matters.
Foreign Minister Tran Van Lam of South Vietnam said
in a radio interview that although "peace is very near" the
Saigon government refuses to sign any Vietnam peace
agreement that mentions the Viet Cong's provisional
revolutionary government..
South Vietnamese sources had said Tuesday that
President Nixon and Thieu planned to declare a unilateral

cease-fire starting tomorrow, the eve of Nixon's
inauguration for a second term. These sources said
yesterday the plan still exists but may be postponed.
Lam said U.S. and North Vietnamese experts
continuing negotiations in Paris have virtually completed
work on military matters, including the proposed
exchange of prisoners, an in-place cease-fire and
international control machinery.
The experts held their third meeting of the week
yesterday on details of the proposed settlement.
Lam said that although draft of the agreement was
substantially modified from the text agreed on by
Kissinger and Tho, Hanoi refused to make any concessions
on re-establishment of the demilitarized zone or
withdrawal of North Vietnamese forces from South
Vietnam.
According to other private sources in Saigon, the
United States will not demand a provision for the
withdrawal of all North Vietnamese troops from the
South in the main treaty. These sources indicate Thieu has
accepted a compromise on this issue.
Corona Jury Still Deliberating
FAIRFIELD — A dozen weary jurors in the Juan Corona
mass murder trial failed to reach a verdict yesterday and
were ordered to resume deliberations for a seventh day
today.
Jury deliberations, which started last Thursday, now
have consumed 44 hours.
There had been no public comment from the jurors
since Tuesday afternoon. They told the court they were
divided 11-1 and were ordered to continue their
deliberations.
The jury of 10 men and two women, who average 51
years old, had spent 38 hours and 30 minutes in formal
deliberations by mid-day yesterday, a bajliff said. The case
was sent to jury after 14 weeks of testimony shortly
before noon last Thursday.
