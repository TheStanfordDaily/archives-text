# Phone Removal Creates Hazard
## 
### CHARLES BENNETT 
The removal last week of courtesy
University extensions from buildings
in the Cowell fraternity cluster and
along the Row has left anyone who
doesn't have a dime for a pay
telephone with no way to call the Fire
Department directly.
Assistant to the Dean of Student
Affairs, Dale Snape, revealed yesterday
that he has received several complaints
from residents in the Cowell and Row
areas, some citing fire danger as an
argument that the University replace
the free extensions in the hallways.
A check with Stanford Fire Chief
Frank Jurian, however, turned up an
added hazard: the Cowell fraternity
buildings are not equipped with any
kind of internal alarm to alert
residents in case of a fire.
An informal preliminary survey by
the Daily indicates that none of the
fraternity clusters has any kind of
audible fire warning system, or free
telephone.
Row Houses Equipped
The Row houses are equipped with
a local buzzer tripped by automatic
smoke detectors or by hand, that will
rouse unknowing residents in case of
emergency but will not summon the
Fire Department automatically.
Chief Jurian stated that "I would
certainly think that there should be a
telephone of some sort that you can
contact us with." Jurian noted that
there are pay phones on each floor of
each house, which conceivably could
be converted by the telephone
company to provide for dialing
emergency numbers without inserting
a dime.
Alan Cummings, University
Director of Residences and
Fraternities, asked about the lack of
alarms in the three fraternity clusters,
first expressed surprise, indicating that
he had thought they were equipped
with smoke detectors and a so-called
"internal" alarm.
"I think that the consideration of
putting internal fire alarm systems in
the cluster houses is one that I want to
pursue immediately," Cummings later
stated.
Primary Concern
The Residence Manager was less
certain about the question of free
telephone service, however. Cummings
noted that "fire alarm systems are first
intended to get people out of the
buildings.
"The idea of the alarm system
being connected to the Fire
Department such as it is in the regular
dormitories [like Wilbur] is
really ... to alert the fire equipment
to come and put out the fire [without
having to be called up J."
Cummings implied that such an
alarm system saves damage to the
building, but that the local "internal"

alarm (buzzer) serves the really vital
function of getting the residents out.
Thus Cummings was unsure that
free phone service, designed to save
damage to the building, was necessary
if a local alarm existed.
The telephone problem persists
because, according to Bruce Wiggins,
Operations Manager of Plant Services,
the courtesy extensions cannot be put
back under any circumstances.
Wiggins explained that the
University switchboard has had to take
a heavier and heavier load over the
years, and now has no positions left.
"Not even a shoehorn" would help, he
said.
Stanford is scheduled to convert to
a new Centrex system in February,
1974, one that can be infinitely
expanded. But the present
switchboard is frozen.
Wiggins was not without a solution.
"I'm concerned about anybody's
safety at all times ... we are actively
exploring for these houses now the
feasibility of them purchasing their
own restriction equipment, not
through Pacific Telephone but from a
separate commercial operator."
Such a system, Wiggins said, could
be installed immediately and attached

to a regular phone. It would restrict
calls to a local area.
It would only be economical if
purchased for a large number of
dorms, Wiggins added. The cost for the
central "black box" would be about
$2000; each house would then have to
pay an added $184 installation fee for
the system, but from then on theiv
would be only a small monthly charge.

intended to get people out of the
buildings.
"The idea of the alarm system
being connected to the Fire
Department such as it is in the regular
dormitories [like Wilbur] is
really ... to alert the fire equipment
to come and put out the fire [without
having to be called up J."
Cummings implied that such an
alarm system saves damage to the
building, but that the local "internal"

alarm (buzzer) serves the really vital
function of getting the residents out.
Thus Cummings was unsure that
free phone service, designed to save
damage to the building, was necessary
if a local alarm existed.
The telephone problem persists
because, according to Bruce Wiggins,
Operations Manager of Plant Services,
the courtesy extensions cannot be put
back under any circumstances.
Wiggins explained that the
University switchboard has had to take
a heavier and heavier load over the
years, and now has no positions left.
"Not even a shoehorn" would help, he
said.
Stanford is scheduled to convert to
a new Centrex system in February,
1974, one that can be infinitely
expanded. But the present
switchboard is frozen.
Wiggins was not without a solution.
"I'm concerned about anybody's
safety at all times ... we are actively
exploring for these houses now the
feasibility of them purchasing their
own restriction equipment, not
through Pacific Telephone but from a
separate commercial operator."
Such a system, Wiggins said, could
be installed immediately and attached

to a regular phone. It would restrict
calls to a local area.
It would only be economical if
purchased for a large number of
dorms, Wiggins added. The cost for the
central "black box" would be about
$2000; each house would then have to
pay an added $184 installation fee for
the system, but from then on theiv
would be only a small monthly charge.
The removal last week of courtesy
University extensions from buildings
in the Cowell fraternity cluster and
along the Row has left anyone who
doesn't have a dime for a pay
telephone with no way to call the Fire
Department directly.
Assistant to the Dean of Student
Affairs, Dale Snape, revealed yesterday
that he has received several complaints
from residents in the Cowell and Row
areas, some citing fire danger as an
argument that the University replace
the free extensions in the hallways.
A check with Stanford Fire Chief
Frank Jurian, however, turned up an
added hazard: the Cowell fraternity
buildings are not equipped with any
kind of internal alarm to alert
residents in case of a fire.
An informal preliminary survey by
the Daily indicates that none of the
fraternity clusters has any kind of
audible fire warning system, or free
telephone.
Row Houses Equipped
The Row houses are equipped with
a local buzzer tripped by automatic
smoke detectors or by hand, that will
rouse unknowing residents in case of
emergency but will not summon the
Fire Department automatically.
Chief Jurian stated that "I would
certainly think that there should be a
telephone of some sort that you can
contact us with." Jurian noted that
there are pay phones on each floor of
each house, which conceivably could
be converted by the telephone
company to provide for dialing
emergency numbers without inserting
a dime.
Alan Cummings, University
Director of Residences and
Fraternities, asked about the lack of
alarms in the three fraternity clusters,
first expressed surprise, indicating that
he had thought they were equipped
with smoke detectors and a so-called
"internal" alarm.
"I think that the consideration of
putting internal fire alarm systems in
the cluster houses is one that I want to
pursue immediately," Cummings later
stated.

certain about the question of free
telephone service, however. Cummings
