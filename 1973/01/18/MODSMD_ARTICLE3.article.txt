# Fairchild Foundation Contributes $7.5 Millon To Medical Center
## 
### TERRY ANZUR 
A $7.5 million contribution from
the Fairchild Foundation, Inc., the
largest foundation gift to date in the
University's $300 million fund-raising
campaign, will be used to construct
the Sherman Fairchild Center for the
Neurosciences at the Medical Center.
The proposed center will provide
space for the Departments of
Anatomy and Physiology, classrooms,
laboratories, an auditorium, a student
commons, and administration
facilities. Design of the complex will

begin immediately, and construction
should be complete within three years.
The Foundatior stipulated that the
money be used specifically to establish
a center for the neurosciences. The
complex will bear the name of
Sherman Fairchild, founder of the
Fairchild Camera and Instrument
Corporation, pioneer in photography
and aviation, and advocate of
technological advancement, who died
in March 1971.
Brain Research
The field of neuroscience includes
such related sciences as anatomy,
physiology, biology, genetics, cell
biology, pharmacology, psychology,
psychiatry, neurology, and
neuroscience. The center will house
the University's new program in the
neurosciences, which focuses on the
study of the brain.
Dr. Clayton Rich, dean of the
Medical School and vice-president for
medical affairs predicts, "One of the
most significant thrusts of medical
research within the next two decades
will take place in the neurosciences.
We feel that Stanford University and
its School of Medicine are now in a
unique position to advance that
research."
In recent years, says Rich, there has
been a rush of research scientists from

molecular biology and other fields into
brain research. As a result of this
massive increase in study, the brain
and associated nervous system have
been discovered to be more
differentiated than scientists
previously thought, and understanding
of the brain's structure and functions
has significantly increased.
Disease Treatment
A treatment for Parkinson's disease
has been found, and researchers
foresee breakthroughs in treatment for
the blind and the deaf, and for victims
of such crippling diseases as spinal
cord injury and stroke.
"The magnificent Fairchild Grant
presents an unprecedented
opportunity for outstanding
achievement in the neurosciences,"
added Rich.
President Richard W. Lyman
announced the gift earlier this week.
"Stanford University and its school of
medicine welcome the challenge of
establishing a solid base for further
understanding of the human brain and
nervous system," he said.
"Not only does the medical faculty
include outstanding members in
psychiatry and the neurosciences, but
also the University is strong in
disciplines necessary to further such
research: engineering, computer

science, biology, and psychology,"
Lyman continued. "We are
immeasurably grateful to the Fairchild
Foundation for providing the key
building from which this work can
proceed."
Fund-Raising Campaign
An anonymous pledge of $15
million launched the campaign for
Stanford last April 11, the largest
contribution received to date. The
University has set a five-year goal of
$300 million in the fund-raising effort.
Funds for the campaign are
solicited by volunteers who seek
contributions from individuals,
foundations, and corporations. The
drive is the largest fund-raising effort
ever initiated by a private educational
institution.
According to Dave Fulton,
communications director for the
campaign, the fund drive had netted
$79 million in gifts and pledges, 26
percent of its goal, by the end of
1972. He described the progress of the
campaign as "right on target."
Fulton explained that donations
like the Fairchild grant are solicited
with an effort to match the objectives
of the donor with those of the
University. That is why the money was
allocated to the construction of a
neuroscience center, he said.

President Richard W. Lyman
announced the gift earlier this week.
"Stanford University and its school of
medicine welcome the challenge of
establishing a solid base for further
understanding of the human brain and
nervous system," he said.
"Not only does the medical faculty
include outstanding members in
psychiatry and the neurosciences, but
also the University is strong in
disciplines necessary to further such
research: engineering, computer

science, biology, and psychology,"
Lyman continued. "We are
immeasurably grateful to the Fairchild
Foundation for providing the key
building from which this work can
proceed."
Fund-Raising Campaign
An anonymous pledge of $15
million launched the campaign for
Stanford last April 11, the largest
contribution received to date. The
University has set a five-year goal of
$300 million in the fund-raising effort.
Funds for the campaign are
solicited by volunteers who seek
contributions from individuals,
foundations, and corporations. The
drive is the largest fund-raising effort
ever initiated by a private educational
institution.
According to Dave Fulton,
communications director for the
campaign, the fund drive had netted
$79 million in gifts and pledges, 26
percent of its goal, by the end of
1972. He described the progress of the
campaign as "right on target."
Fulton explained that donations
like the Fairchild grant are solicited
with an effort to match the objectives
of the donor with those of the
University. That is why the money was
allocated to the construction of a
neuroscience center, he said.

A $7.5 million contribution from
the Fairchild Foundation, Inc., the
largest foundation gift to date in the
University's $300 million fund-raising
campaign, will be used to construct
the Sherman Fairchild Center for the
Neurosciences at the Medical Center.
The proposed center will provide
space for the Departments of
Anatomy and Physiology, classrooms,
laboratories, an auditorium, a student
commons, and administration
facilities. Design of the complex will

begin immediately, and construction
should be complete within three years.
The Foundatior stipulated that the
money be used specifically to establish
a center for the neurosciences. The
complex will bear the name of
Sherman Fairchild, founder of the
Fairchild Camera and Instrument
Corporation, pioneer in photography
and aviation, and advocate of
technological advancement, who died
in March 1971.
Brain Research
The field of neuroscience includes
such related sciences as anatomy,
physiology, biology, genetics, cell
biology, pharmacology, psychology,
psychiatry, neurology, and
neuroscience. The center will house
the University's new program in the
neurosciences, which focuses on the
study of the brain.
Dr. Clayton Rich, dean of the
Medical School and vice-president for
medical affairs predicts, "One of the
most significant thrusts of medical
research within the next two decades
will take place in the neurosciences.
We feel that Stanford University and
its School of Medicine are now in a
unique position to advance that
research."
In recent years, says Rich, there has
been a rush of research scientists from

molecular biology and other fields into
brain research. As a result of this
massive increase in study, the brain
and associated nervous system have
been discovered to be more
differentiated than scientists
previously thought, and understanding
of the brain's structure and functions
has significantly increased.
Disease Treatment
A treatment for Parkinson's disease
has been found, and researchers
foresee breakthroughs in treatment for
the blind and the deaf, and for victims
of such crippling diseases as spinal
cord injury and stroke.
"The magnificent Fairchild Grant
presents an unprecedented
opportunity for outstanding
achievement in the neurosciences,"
added Rich.
