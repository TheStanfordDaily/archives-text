# Jury Hears Opening Arguments
## Pentagon Papers Trial Underway 
### ED KOHN 
Special to the Daily
LOS ANGELES — Arguments in the
long-delayed "Pentagon Papers" trial
began yesterday as prosecutor David
Nissen portrayed the case as essentially
a non-political one, while the defense
attorney voiced an opposite view.
Speaking in a slow, plaintive
Midwestern drawl, and extensively
utilizing a wall projector to illustrate
his remarks to the jurors, Nissen
outlined the charges and evidence
against Dr. Daniel Ellsberg and
Anthony J. Russo, co-defendants in
the case.
Russo and Ellsberg are charged with
a total of 15 counts of conspiracy
espionage, and theft of government
property for allegedly duplicating
portions of three top-secret
Department of Defense studies on the
Vietnam War. If convicted on all
counts, Ellsberg could face a 115-year
jail term, while Russo could serve a
35-year term.
Opening Statement
During his two-hour-long opening
statement, Nissen told the jurors:
—that there will be no government
witnesses who will testify about the
legality or wisdom of the Vietnam
War;
—that no government witnesses will
testify about the government's
security classification policies;
—that the publication of the
"Pentagon Papers," one of the studies
the defendants are accused of
duplicating, by the New York Times,
and other newspapers will not be
discussed by government witnesses;
and

-that the government would not
offer a motive for the alleged activities
of the defendants.
"Motives do not excuse behavior
which is wrong," Nissen told the
10-woman, two-man jury which
listened intently to the proceedings
throughout the day.
He told the jurors that the
duplication and subsequent
publication of the documents
interfered with United States
diplomacy, delayed the settlement of
the Vietnam War, and threatened the
national defense.
Broad Term
"National defense is a broad term.

It covers things like the interstate
highway system," Nissen told the
jurors. Later he told them, "You will
be able to see how these documents
relate to the national defense by
examining them yourself."
He said that the government will
not try to prove that the documents
are vital to the defense of the United
States, or that their release injured
American interests — "The charges do
not require us to," Nissen remarked.
He said he plans to prosecute the case
like any other normal criminal
proceeding, ignoring all political
overtones.
Speaking for Ellsberg, Leonard

Boudin told the court that "We are
going to prove to you that these things
[the information contained in the
three studies] were in the public
domain" at the time the alleged
copying occurred.
Denies Conspiracy
He denied that any conspiracy
existed between Ellsberg and Russo
and the two unindicted
"co-conspirators" and maintained
Ellsberg's possession of the papers was
lawful. Boudin told the jurors that he
would conduct a detailed examination
of the concept of national security, a
term the Supreme Court repeatedly
has refused to define, and the
military's classification system, during
the course of the trial.
He maintained that the defendants
were doing a necessary, patriotic job
by photographing the documents with
the intention of giving them to Sen. J.
William Fulbright (D.-Ark.), Chairman
of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee. Boudin said that witnesses
would demonstrate that the release of
the documents did not pose any
military or diplomatic problem for the
American government.
Boudin told the jurors to expect
substantial agreement between the
defense and the prosecution on the
"mechanical facts" of the case, but
said that e?ich would present opposite
views on their interpretation. Counsel
for Russo did not offer an opening
statement.
The courtroom was packed for
both of yesterday's sessions. About 20
members of the Vietnam Veterans
Against the War (VVAW), including
one paraplegic in a wheelchair, briefly
irritated presiding Judge Matt Byrne
Jr., by sitting down as a group after
the other spectators were already
seated. However, there were no other
incidents.

During a noontime press
conference, a VVAW spokesman read
a statement in support of Ellsberg and
Russo and called on the United States
to quickly sign the peace agreement
with the North Vietnamese.
Also during the noontime
conference, Russo told reporters, "The
Pentagon Papers marks a
Constitutional crisis. The government
is on trial and history will find it guilty
of trying to abridge freedom of speech
and freedom of the press."
Second Trial
This is the second trial for Ellsberg
and Russo. Their first ended in a
mistrial Dec. 12 after an appeals court
informed Byrne that he would be
"foolish" to continue the trial with a
jury that was selected, but that had
been out of court for four months
while the defense pursued an
unsuccessful appeal to the U.S.
Supreme Court.
The first prosecution witness —
whom Nissen refused to identify —
will testify this morning. The trial is
expected to last at least three months,
and the defense alone expects to call
more than 30 witnesses, many of them
experts in such fields as the military's
classification system, national defense,
and international relations.

counts, Ellsberg could face a 115-year
jail term, while Russo could serve a
35-year term.
Opening Statement
During his two-hour-long opening
statement, Nissen told the jurors:
—that there will be no government
witnesses who will testify about the
legality or wisdom of the Vietnam
War;
—that no government witnesses will
testify about the government's
security classification policies;
—that the publication of the
"Pentagon Papers," one of the studies
the defendants are accused of
duplicating, by the New York Times,
and other newspapers will not be
discussed by government witnesses;
and

-that the government would not
offer a motive for the alleged activities
of the defendants.
"Motives do not excuse behavior
which is wrong," Nissen told the
10-woman, two-man jury which
listened intently to the proceedings
throughout the day.
He told the jurors that the
duplication and subsequent
publication of the documents
interfered with United States
diplomacy, delayed the settlement of
the Vietnam War, and threatened the
national defense.
Broad Term
"National defense is a broad term.

It covers things like the interstate
highway system," Nissen told the
jurors. Later he told them, "You will
be able to see how these documents
relate to the national defense by
examining them yourself."
He said that the government will
not try to prove that the documents
are vital to the defense of the United
States, or that their release injured
American interests — "The charges do
not require us to," Nissen remarked.
He said he plans to prosecute the case
like any other normal criminal
proceeding, ignoring all political
overtones.
Speaking for Ellsberg, Leonard

Boudin told the court that "We are
going to prove to you that these things
[the information contained in the
three studies] were in the public
domain" at the time the alleged
copying occurred.
Denies Conspiracy
He denied that any conspiracy
existed between Ellsberg and Russo
and the two unindicted
"co-conspirators" and maintained
Ellsberg's possession of the papers was
lawful. Boudin told the jurors that he
would conduct a detailed examination
of the concept of national security, a
term the Supreme Court repeatedly
has refused to define, and the
military's classification system, during
the course of the trial.
He maintained that the defendants
were doing a necessary, patriotic job
by photographing the documents with
the intention of giving them to Sen. J.
William Fulbright (D.-Ark.), Chairman
of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee. Boudin said that witnesses
would demonstrate that the release of
the documents did not pose any
military or diplomatic problem for the
American government.
Boudin told the jurors to expect
substantial agreement between the
defense and the prosecution on the
"mechanical facts" of the case, but
said that e?ich would present opposite
views on their interpretation. Counsel
for Russo did not offer an opening
statement.
The courtroom was packed for
both of yesterday's sessions. About 20
members of the Vietnam Veterans
Against the War (VVAW), including
one paraplegic in a wheelchair, briefly
irritated presiding Judge Matt Byrne
Jr., by sitting down as a group after
the other spectators were already
seated. However, there were no other
incidents.

During a noontime press
conference, a VVAW spokesman read
a statement in support of Ellsberg and
Russo and called on the United States
to quickly sign the peace agreement
with the North Vietnamese.
Also during the noontime
conference, Russo told reporters, "The
Pentagon Papers marks a
Constitutional crisis. The government
is on trial and history will find it guilty
of trying to abridge freedom of speech
and freedom of the press."
Second Trial
This is the second trial for Ellsberg
and Russo. Their first ended in a
mistrial Dec. 12 after an appeals court
informed Byrne that he would be
"foolish" to continue the trial with a
jury that was selected, but that had
been out of court for four months
while the defense pursued an
unsuccessful appeal to the U.S.
Supreme Court.
The first prosecution witness —
whom Nissen refused to identify —
will testify this morning. The trial is
expected to last at least three months,
and the defense alone expects to call
more than 30 witnesses, many of them
experts in such fields as the military's
classification system, national defense,
and international relations.
Special to the Daily
LOS ANGELES — Arguments in the
long-delayed "Pentagon Papers" trial
began yesterday as prosecutor David
Nissen portrayed the case as essentially
a non-political one, while the defense
attorney voiced an opposite view.
Speaking in a slow, plaintive
Midwestern drawl, and extensively
utilizing a wall projector to illustrate
his remarks to the jurors, Nissen
outlined the charges and evidence
against Dr. Daniel Ellsberg and
Anthony J. Russo, co-defendants in
the case.
Russo and Ellsberg are charged with
a total of 15 counts of conspiracy
espionage, and theft of government
property for allegedly duplicating
portions of three top-secret
Department of Defense studies on the
Vietnam War. If convicted on all
counts, Ellsberg could face a 115-year
jail term, while Russo could serve a
35-year term.

which is wrong," Nissen told the
10-woman, two-man jury which
listened intently to the proceedings
throughout the day.
He told the jurors that the
duplication and subsequent
publication of the documents
interfered with United States
diplomacy, delayed the settlement of
the Vietnam War, and threatened the
national defense.
Broad Term
"National defense is a broad term.

It covers things like the interstate
highway system," Nissen told the
jurors. Later he told them, "You will
be able to see how these documents
relate to the national defense by
examining them yourself."
He said that the government will
not try to prove that the documents
are vital to the defense of the United
States, or that their release injured
American interests — "The charges do
not require us to," Nissen remarked.
He said he plans to prosecute the case
like any other normal criminal
proceeding, ignoring all political
overtones.
Speaking for Ellsberg, Leonard

Boudin told the court that "We are
going to prove to you that these things
[the information contained in the
three studies] were in the public
domain" at the time the alleged
copying occurred.
Denies Conspiracy
He denied that any conspiracy
existed between Ellsberg and Russo
and the two unindicted
"co-conspirators" and maintained
Ellsberg's possession of the papers was
lawful. Boudin told the jurors that he
would conduct a detailed examination
of the concept of national security, a
term the Supreme Court repeatedly
has refused to define, and the
military's classification system, during
the course of the trial.
He maintained that the defendants
were doing a necessary, patriotic job
by photographing the documents with
the intention of giving them to Sen. J.
William Fulbright (D.-Ark.), Chairman
of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee. Boudin said that witnesses
would demonstrate that the release of
the documents did not pose any
military or diplomatic problem for the
American government.
Boudin told the jurors to expect
substantial agreement between the
defense and the prosecution on the
"mechanical facts" of the case, but
said that e?ich would present opposite
views on their interpretation. Counsel
for Russo did not offer an opening
statement.
The courtroom was packed for
both of yesterday's sessions. About 20
members of the Vietnam Veterans
Against the War (VVAW), including
one paraplegic in a wheelchair, briefly
irritated presiding Judge Matt Byrne
Jr., by sitting down as a group after
the other spectators were already
seated. However, there were no other
incidents.

During a noontime press
conference, a VVAW spokesman read
a statement in support of Ellsberg and
Russo and called on the United States
to quickly sign the peace agreement
with the North Vietnamese.
Also during the noontime
conference, Russo told reporters, "The
Pentagon Papers marks a
Constitutional crisis. The government
is on trial and history will find it guilty
of trying to abridge freedom of speech
and freedom of the press."
Second Trial
This is the second trial for Ellsberg
and Russo. Their first ended in a
mistrial Dec. 12 after an appeals court
informed Byrne that he would be
"foolish" to continue the trial with a
jury that was selected, but that had
been out of court for four months
while the defense pursued an
unsuccessful appeal to the U.S.
Supreme Court.
The first prosecution witness —
whom Nissen refused to identify —
will testify this morning. The trial is
expected to last at least three months,
and the defense alone expects to call
more than 30 witnesses, many of them
experts in such fields as the military's
classification system, national defense,
and international relations.
Special to the Daily
LOS ANGELES — Arguments in the
long-delayed "Pentagon Papers" trial
began yesterday as prosecutor David
Nissen portrayed the case as essentially
a non-political one, while the defense
attorney voiced an opposite view.
Speaking in a slow, plaintive
Midwestern drawl, and extensively
utilizing a wall projector to illustrate
his remarks to the jurors, Nissen
outlined the charges and evidence
against Dr. Daniel Ellsberg and
Anthony J. Russo, co-defendants in
the case.
Russo and Ellsberg are charged with
a total of 15 counts of conspiracy
espionage, and theft of government
property for allegedly duplicating
portions of three top-secret
Department of Defense studies on the
Vietnam War. If convicted on all
counts, Ellsberg could face a 115-year
jail term, while Russo could serve a
35-year term.
Opening Statement
During his two-hour-long opening
statement, Nissen told the jurors:
—that there will be no government
witnesses who will testify about the
legality or wisdom of the Vietnam
War;
—that no government witnesses will
testify about the government's
security classification policies;
—that the publication of the
"Pentagon Papers," one of the studies
the defendants are accused of
duplicating, by the New York Times,
and other newspapers will not be
discussed by government witnesses;
and

-that the government would not
offer a motive for the alleged activities
of the defendants.
"Motives do not excuse behavior

10-woman, two-man jury which
