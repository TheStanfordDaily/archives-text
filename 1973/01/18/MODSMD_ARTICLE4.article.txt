# Jury Hears Opening Arguments
## Pentagon Papers Trial Underway 
### ED KOHN 
Special to the Daily
LOS ANGELES — Arguments in the
long-delayed "Pentagon Papers" trial
began yesterday as prosecutor David
Nissen portrayed the case as essentially
a non-political one, while the defense
attorney voiced an opposite view.
Speaking in a slow, plaintive
Midwestern drawl, and extensively
utilizing a wall projector to illustrate
his remarks to the jurors, Nissen
outlined the charges and evidence
against Dr. Daniel Ellsberg and
Anthony J. Russo, co-defendants in
the case.
Russo and Ellsberg are charged with
a total of 15 counts of conspiracy
espionage, and theft of government
property for allegedly duplicating
portions of three top-secret
Department of Defense studies on the
Vietnam War. If convicted on all
counts, Ellsberg could face a 115-year
jail term, while Russo could serve a
35-year term.
Opening Statement
During his two-hour-long opening
statement, Nissen told the jurors:
—that there will be no government
witnesses who will testify about the
legality or wisdom of the Vietnam
War;
—that no government witnesses will
testify about the government's
security classification policies;
—that the publication of the
"Pentagon Papers," one of the studies
the defendants are accused of
duplicating, by the New York Times,
and other newspapers will not be
discussed by government witnesses;
and

-that the government would not
offer a motive for the alleged activities
of the defendants.
"Motives do not excuse behavior
which is wrong," Nissen told the
10-woman, two-man jury which
listened intently to the proceedings
throughout the day.
He told the jurors that the
duplication and subsequent
publication of the documents
interfered with United States
diplomacy, delayed the settlement of
the Vietnam War, and threatened the
national defense.
Broad Term
"National defense is a broad term.

It covers things like the interstate
highway system," Nissen told the
jurors. Later he told them, "You will
be able to see how these documents
relate to the national defense by
examining them yourself."
He said that the government will
not try to prove that the documents
are vital to the defense of the United
States, or that their release injured
American interests — "The charges do
not require us to," Nissen remarked.
He said he plans to prosecute the case
like any other normal criminal
proceeding, ignoring all political
overtones.
Speaking for Ellsberg, Leonard

Boudin told the court that "We are
going to prove to you that these things
[the information contained in the
three studies] were in the public
domain" at the time the alleged
copying occurred.
Denies Conspiracy
He denied that any conspiracy
existed between Ellsberg and Russo
and the two unindicted
"co-conspirators" and maintained
Ellsberg's possession of the papers was
lawful. Boudin told the jurors that he
would conduct a detailed examination
of the concept of national security, a
term the Supreme Court repeatedly
