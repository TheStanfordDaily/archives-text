# Sane Patients Fool Psychiatrists; Prof. Asks: Who's Really Crazy?
## 
### MARK SIMONIAN 
Psychiatrists can't tell the sane
from the insane in mental hospitals,
says Dr. David L. Rosenhan, professor
of psychology and law.
In a carefully-planned psychological
experiment, Rosenhan and seven other
sane persons secretly entered
psychiatric hospitals across the
country and masqueraded as
schizophrenic patients. None were
judged sane by staff psychiatrists at
any of the twelve hospitals they
visited. Only real mental patients
perceived the truth.
Rosenhan disclosed these surprising
results in the Jan. 19 issue of Science
magazine.

In that article the psychologist
criticized not only present methods of
diagnosis of mental illness, but also the
"counter-therapeutic" environment of
psychiatric hospitals.
Sane Or Insane?
"We know that we cannot
distinguish insanity from sanity,"
Rosenhan said. "We continue to label
patients 'schizophrenic,'
'manic-depressive,' and 'insane' as if in
those words we had captured the
essence of understanding.
"The facts of the matter are that
we have known for a long time that
our diagnoses are often not usefully
reliable, but we have nevertheless
continued to use them. It is depressing
to consider how that information will
be used. Not merely depressing, but
frightening."
The psychiatrists' failure to
recognize sanity, Rosenhan believes,
may be attributed largely to the
physician's inclination to look for
illness rather than good health.
Medically, "it is clearly more
dangerous to misdiagnose illness than
health," he stated.
'Pseudopatients'
In the experiment, a pediatrician, a
psychiatrist, a psychology graduate
student here, a painter, a housewife,
three psychologists and Rosenhan
committed themselves to hospitals in
California, Oregon, Pennsylvania, New
York, and Delaware. Three of the
so-called "pseudopatients" were
women; five were men.

All eight entered under
pseudonyms, and the doctors altered
their occupations to remove any
professional courtesy they might
receive from the hospital staffs.
The average length of
hospitalization of the pseudopatients
was 19 days; the longest being 52
days, the shortest seven.
According to Rosenhan's article,
"Immediately upon admission to thy
psychiatric ward, the pseudopatient
ceased simulating any psychiatric
symtomatology." Apart from a


DAVID ROSENHAN
"short-lived nervousness," the
pseudopatient behaved in the
mental ward as he would
normally.
Took Notes
The undercover observer
"spent his time writing down his
observations. . . Initially, these
notes were written secretly, but as
it soon became clear that no one
much cared, they were
subsequently written ... in such
public places as the dayroom,"
Rosenhan reported in his article.
"Despite their public 'show' of
sanity," the article continues,
"the pseudopatients were never
detected" by the professional
staff.
Yet, it was "quite common"
for the actual psychiatric patients
to pick out the impostors among
them.
'You're Not Crazy'
"You're not crazy. You're a
journalist or a professor," many
patients would say referring to the

note-taking. "You're checking up
on the hospital."
Rosenhan did not blame the
doctors, nurses, psychologists,
social workers, or many
attendants for the various failures
of the mental hospital. "Their
intentions are noble," he said.
"By and large, they mean well."
Instead, the psychologist
focuses his attacks on the
"environment" of the psychiatric
ward.
Pessimistic View
The hospital fosters a
"pessimistic view of mental
illness," Rosenhan remarked.
"Often once a patient is judged
mentally sick, he is always
considered sick. Tom Eagleton is a
good example."
The routing of the wards often
succeeds in "depersonalizing" the
patient.
"The patient is deprived of
many of his legal rights. He is
shorn of credibility by virtue of
his psychiatric label. His freedom

of movement is restricted. His
personal history and anguish are
available to any staff
member . . . including the
'candy-striper' volunteer who
chooses to read his folder,"
Rosenhan reported.
Violence In Wards
Pseudopatients also observed
incidents of violence in the
psychiatric hospitals.
"I have records of patients who
were beaten by staff for the sin of
having initiated verbal contact,"
the psychology professor stated.
"During my own experience, one
patient was beaten for having
approached an attendant and told
him, 'I like you.' "
But when other staff members
approached, the abuse stopped.
Staff members are credible
witnesses in court, but patients
are not.
Pseudopatients faced taking
massive amounts of medication,
even though they were not ill.
"All told, we were

administered nearly 2100 pills.
Only two were swallowed. The
rest were either pocketed or
thrown in the toilet," Rosenhan
related. The real patients often
did the same.
Rosenhan could see no real
solutions to the problems. "We
know so little about the
psychiatric hospital," he
commented. However he
expressed hope that community
mental health clinics, crisis
intervention centers, and new
behavior theories could help
mitigate some of the psychiatric
patients' problems.
The psychologist also suggested
home treatment as a possible
solution, treating the patient
living in his everyday
environment. He strongly urged
greater hospital staff-patient
communication.
As for his own future,
Rosenhan plans to continue
visiting hospitals — anonymously,
of course.

available to any staff
member . . . including the
'candy-striper' volunteer who
chooses to read his folder,"
Rosenhan reported.
Violence In Wards
Pseudopatients also observed
incidents of violence in the
psychiatric hospitals.
"I have records of patients who
were beaten by staff for the sin of
having initiated verbal contact,"
the psychology professor stated.
"During my own experience, one
patient was beaten for having
approached an attendant and told
him, 'I like you.' "
But when other staff members
approached, the abuse stopped.
Staff members are credible
witnesses in court, but patients
are not.
Pseudopatients faced taking
massive amounts of medication,
even though they were not ill.
"All told, we were

administered nearly 2100 pills.
Only two were swallowed. The
rest were either pocketed or
thrown in the toilet," Rosenhan
related. The real patients often
did the same.
Rosenhan could see no real
solutions to the problems. "We
know so little about the
psychiatric hospital," he
commented. However he
expressed hope that community
mental health clinics, crisis
intervention centers, and new
behavior theories could help
mitigate some of the psychiatric
patients' problems.
The psychologist also suggested
home treatment as a possible
solution, treating the patient
living in his everyday
environment. He strongly urged
greater hospital staff-patient
communication.
As for his own future,
Rosenhan plans to continue
visiting hospitals — anonymously,
of course.
Psychiatrists can't tell the sane
from the insane in mental hospitals,
says Dr. David L. Rosenhan, professor
of psychology and law.
In a carefully-planned psychological
experiment, Rosenhan and seven other
sane persons secretly entered
psychiatric hospitals across the
country and masqueraded as
schizophrenic patients. None were
judged sane by staff psychiatrists at
any of the twelve hospitals they
visited. Only real mental patients
perceived the truth.
Rosenhan disclosed these surprising
results in the Jan. 19 issue of Science
magazine.

In that article the psychologist
criticized not only present methods of
diagnosis of mental illness, but also the
"counter-therapeutic" environment of
psychiatric hospitals.
Sane Or Insane?
"We know that we cannot
distinguish insanity from sanity,"
Rosenhan said. "We continue to label
patients 'schizophrenic,'
'manic-depressive,' and 'insane' as if in
those words we had captured the
essence of understanding.
"The facts of the matter are that
we have known for a long time that
our diagnoses are often not usefully
reliable, but we have nevertheless
continued to use them. It is depressing
to consider how that information will
be used. Not merely depressing, but
frightening."
The psychiatrists' failure to
recognize sanity, Rosenhan believes,
may be attributed largely to the
physician's inclination to look for
illness rather than good health.
Medically, "it is clearly more
dangerous to misdiagnose illness than
health," he stated.
'Pseudopatients'
In the experiment, a pediatrician, a
psychiatrist, a psychology graduate
student here, a painter, a housewife,
three psychologists and Rosenhan
committed themselves to hospitals in
California, Oregon, Pennsylvania, New
York, and Delaware. Three of the
so-called "pseudopatients" were
women; five were men.

All eight entered under
pseudonyms, and the doctors altered
their occupations to remove any
professional courtesy they might
receive from the hospital staffs.
The average length of
hospitalization of the pseudopatients
was 19 days; the longest being 52
days, the shortest seven.
According to Rosenhan's article,
"Immediately upon admission to thy
psychiatric ward, the pseudopatient
ceased simulating any psychiatric
symtomatology." Apart from a


DAVID ROSENHAN
"short-lived nervousness," the
pseudopatient behaved in the
mental ward as he would
normally.
Took Notes
The undercover observer
"spent his time writing down his
observations. . . Initially, these
notes were written secretly, but as
it soon became clear that no one
much cared, they were
subsequently written ... in such
public places as the dayroom,"
Rosenhan reported in his article.
"Despite their public 'show' of
sanity," the article continues,
"the pseudopatients were never
detected" by the professional
staff.
Yet, it was "quite common"
for the actual psychiatric patients
to pick out the impostors among
them.
'You're Not Crazy'
"You're not crazy. You're a
journalist or a professor," many
patients would say referring to the

note-taking. "You're checking up
on the hospital."
Rosenhan did not blame the
doctors, nurses, psychologists,
social workers, or many
attendants for the various failures
of the mental hospital. "Their
intentions are noble," he said.
"By and large, they mean well."
Instead, the psychologist
focuses his attacks on the
"environment" of the psychiatric
ward.
Pessimistic View
The hospital fosters a
"pessimistic view of mental
illness," Rosenhan remarked.
"Often once a patient is judged
mentally sick, he is always
considered sick. Tom Eagleton is a
good example."
The routing of the wards often
succeeds in "depersonalizing" the
patient.
"The patient is deprived of
many of his legal rights. He is
shorn of credibility by virtue of
his psychiatric label. His freedom

of movement is restricted. His
personal history and anguish are
available to any staff
member . . . including the
'candy-striper' volunteer who
chooses to read his folder,"
Rosenhan reported.

much cared, they were
subsequently written ... in such
public places as the dayroom,"
Rosenhan reported in his article.
"Despite their public 'show' of
sanity," the article continues,
"the pseudopatients were never
detected" by the professional
staff.
Yet, it was "quite common"
for the actual psychiatric patients
to pick out the impostors among
them.
'You're Not Crazy'
"You're not crazy. You're a
journalist or a professor," many
patients would say referring to the

note-taking. "You're checking up
on the hospital."
Rosenhan did not blame the
doctors, nurses, psychologists,
social workers, or many
attendants for the various failures
of the mental hospital. "Their
intentions are noble," he said.
"By and large, they mean well."
Instead, the psychologist
focuses his attacks on the
"environment" of the psychiatric
ward.
Pessimistic View
The hospital fosters a
"pessimistic view of mental
illness," Rosenhan remarked.
"Often once a patient is judged
mentally sick, he is always
considered sick. Tom Eagleton is a
good example."
The routing of the wards often
succeeds in "depersonalizing" the
patient.
"The patient is deprived of
many of his legal rights. He is
shorn of credibility by virtue of
his psychiatric label. His freedom

of movement is restricted. His
personal history and anguish are
available to any staff
member . . . including the
'candy-striper' volunteer who
chooses to read his folder,"
Rosenhan reported.
Violence In Wards
Pseudopatients also observed
incidents of violence in the
psychiatric hospitals.
"I have records of patients who
were beaten by staff for the sin of
having initiated verbal contact,"
the psychology professor stated.
"During my own experience, one
patient was beaten for having
approached an attendant and told
him, 'I like you.' "
But when other staff members
approached, the abuse stopped.
Staff members are credible
witnesses in court, but patients
are not.
Pseudopatients faced taking
massive amounts of medication,
even though they were not ill.
"All told, we were

administered nearly 2100 pills.
Only two were swallowed. The
rest were either pocketed or
thrown in the toilet," Rosenhan
related. The real patients often
did the same.
Rosenhan could see no real
solutions to the problems. "We
know so little about the
psychiatric hospital," he
commented. However he
expressed hope that community
mental health clinics, crisis
intervention centers, and new
behavior theories could help
mitigate some of the psychiatric
patients' problems.
The psychologist also suggested
home treatment as a possible
solution, treating the patient
living in his everyday
environment. He strongly urged
greater hospital staff-patient
communication.
As for his own future,
Rosenhan plans to continue
visiting hospitals — anonymously,
of course.
Psychiatrists can't tell the sane
from the insane in mental hospitals,
says Dr. David L. Rosenhan, professor
of psychology and law.
In a carefully-planned psychological
experiment, Rosenhan and seven other
sane persons secretly entered
psychiatric hospitals across the
country and masqueraded as
schizophrenic patients. None were
judged sane by staff psychiatrists at
any of the twelve hospitals they
visited. Only real mental patients
perceived the truth.
Rosenhan disclosed these surprising
results in the Jan. 19 issue of Science
magazine.

In that article the psychologist
criticized not only present methods of
diagnosis of mental illness, but also the
"counter-therapeutic" environment of
psychiatric hospitals.
Sane Or Insane?
"We know that we cannot
distinguish insanity from sanity,"
Rosenhan said. "We continue to label
patients 'schizophrenic,'
'manic-depressive,' and 'insane' as if in
those words we had captured the
essence of understanding.
"The facts of the matter are that
we have known for a long time that
our diagnoses are often not usefully
reliable, but we have nevertheless
continued to use them. It is depressing
to consider how that information will
be used. Not merely depressing, but
frightening."
The psychiatrists' failure to
recognize sanity, Rosenhan believes,
may be attributed largely to the
physician's inclination to look for
illness rather than good health.
Medically, "it is clearly more
dangerous to misdiagnose illness than
health," he stated.
'Pseudopatients'
In the experiment, a pediatrician, a
psychiatrist, a psychology graduate
student here, a painter, a housewife,
three psychologists and Rosenhan
committed themselves to hospitals in
California, Oregon, Pennsylvania, New
York, and Delaware. Three of the
so-called "pseudopatients" were
women; five were men.

All eight entered under
pseudonyms, and the doctors altered
their occupations to remove any
professional courtesy they might
receive from the hospital staffs.
The average length of
hospitalization of the pseudopatients
was 19 days; the longest being 52
days, the shortest seven.
According to Rosenhan's article,
"Immediately upon admission to thy
psychiatric ward, the pseudopatient
ceased simulating any psychiatric
symtomatology." Apart from a


DAVID ROSENHAN
"short-lived nervousness," the
pseudopatient behaved in the
mental ward as he would
normally.
Took Notes
The undercover observer
"spent his time writing down his
observations. . . Initially, these
notes were written secretly, but as
it soon became clear that no one
much cared, they were
subsequently written ... in such
public places as the dayroom,"
Rosenhan reported in his article.
