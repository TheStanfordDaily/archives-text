# Sane Patients Fool Psychiatrists; Prof. Asks: Who's Really Crazy?
## 
### MARK SIMONIAN 
Psychiatrists can't tell the sane
from the insane in mental hospitals,
says Dr. David L. Rosenhan, professor
of psychology and law.
In a carefully-planned psychological
experiment, Rosenhan and seven other
sane persons secretly entered
psychiatric hospitals across the
country and masqueraded as
schizophrenic patients. None were
judged sane by staff psychiatrists at
any of the twelve hospitals they
visited. Only real mental patients
perceived the truth.
Rosenhan disclosed these surprising
results in the Jan. 19 issue of Science
magazine.

In that article the psychologist
criticized not only present methods of
diagnosis of mental illness, but also the
"counter-therapeutic" environment of
psychiatric hospitals.
Sane Or Insane?
"We know that we cannot
distinguish insanity from sanity,"
Rosenhan said. "We continue to label
patients 'schizophrenic,'
'manic-depressive,' and 'insane' as if in
those words we had captured the
essence of understanding.
"The facts of the matter are that
we have known for a long time that
our diagnoses are often not usefully
reliable, but we have nevertheless
continued to use them. It is depressing
to consider how that information will
be used. Not merely depressing, but
frightening."
The psychiatrists' failure to
recognize sanity, Rosenhan believes,
may be attributed largely to the
physician's inclination to look for
illness rather than good health.
Medically, "it is clearly more
dangerous to misdiagnose illness than
health," he stated.
'Pseudopatients'
In the experiment, a pediatrician, a
psychiatrist, a psychology graduate
student here, a painter, a housewife,
three psychologists and Rosenhan
committed themselves to hospitals in
California, Oregon, Pennsylvania, New
York, and Delaware. Three of the
so-called "pseudopatients" were
women; five were men.

All eight entered under
pseudonyms, and the doctors altered
their occupations to remove any
professional courtesy they might
receive from the hospital staffs.
The average length of
hospitalization of the pseudopatients
was 19 days; the longest being 52
days, the shortest seven.
According to Rosenhan's article,
"Immediately upon admission to thy
psychiatric ward, the pseudopatient
ceased simulating any psychiatric
symtomatology." Apart from a
