The departure of Tresidder Memorial Union Director Forrest
Tregea is long overdue and very welcome. Ever since Tregea came here
in 1968 after resigning under pressure from a similar position at
Cal-Berkeley, Tresidder has been beset by problems.
By August 1972, the Union's operating deficit had risen to
$288,000 and according to Tresidder's financial manager, Gordon
Starr, the University at that time decided to "wipe the slate clean and
give the Union another chance." But a chronic financial deficit has
been only the worst of a long list of problems.
Tresidder food has long been the subject of much displeasure and
while quality hasn't noticeably improved in recent years, prices have
gone up considerably.
The Tresidder store has never been noted for an overly large
selection of goods and its prices make buying at local discount stores a
wise investment.
In addition to the overall poor quality and high prices which
characterize the cafeteria and drug store, each facility has been beset
by numerous specific problems in recent years.
In 1970 the University administration announced that only United
Farm Workers (UFW) lettuce would be used in campus food facilities.
More than once since that policy was announced, non-UFW lettuce
has been used at Tresidder.
Every time the management lias been caught violating the policy,
they claim it was due to an oversight and assure people that it won't
happen again. But somehow it docs. As recently as last quarter,
Trcgea's successor, Gordon Starr, again advanced the oversight theory
and said the practice "would stop immediately." We hope that Starr is
more dependable than his predecessor.
Last summer, the store's inventory was invaded by moths and a fair
amount of its candy and nut supply had to be destroyed. Store
employees admitted that in addition to the damage caused by moths,
some of the candy supply rotted in storage because of heat in the
non-air conditioned storeroom.
Shortly after the moths were eliminated, cockroaches became a
periodic problem throughout much of the Union. Union employees
said that the problem was caused by an upstairs banquet room that
was not cleaned very well following receptions. The improper
maintenance which caused such problems can be traced directly to
bad management.
Tregea's departure was necessary, but it is not a panacea for the
Union's problems. It is up to the new management to improve on the
dismal record of recent years.
Under new organizational plans, Stair will assume many of Tregea's
former responsibilities, but he will work closely with the Dean of
Student Affairs Office.
Associate Dean of Student Affairs Dan Williams has released
ambitious new plans for expansion of Tresidder's operation and
frankly we fear that this may be the wrong course of action. Tresidder
definitely needs new management and a new philosophy, but we feel
that expansion of its operations should not be undertaken until the
basic services already offered are improved considerably.
We commend Starr and Williams for bringing a fresh outlook to
Tresidder. But we hope they will realize that their immediate goal
should be improvement of existing services. Expansion of services is a
good idea for the future, but it shouldn't be attempted until those
services already offered are improved dramatically.

more dependable than his predecessor.
Last summer, the store's inventory was invaded by moths and a fair
amount of its candy and nut supply had to be destroyed. Store
employees admitted that in addition to the damage caused by moths,
some of the candy supply rotted in storage because of heat in the
non-air conditioned storeroom.
Shortly after the moths were eliminated, cockroaches became a
periodic problem throughout much of the Union. Union employees
said that the problem was caused by an upstairs banquet room that
was not cleaned very well following receptions. The improper
maintenance which caused such problems can be traced directly to
bad management.
Tregea's departure was necessary, but it is not a panacea for the
Union's problems. It is up to the new management to improve on the
dismal record of recent years.
Under new organizational plans, Stair will assume many of Tregea's
former responsibilities, but he will work closely with the Dean of
Student Affairs Office.
Associate Dean of Student Affairs Dan Williams has released
ambitious new plans for expansion of Tresidder's operation and
frankly we fear that this may be the wrong course of action. Tresidder
definitely needs new management and a new philosophy, but we feel
that expansion of its operations should not be undertaken until the
basic services already offered are improved considerably.
We commend Starr and Williams for bringing a fresh outlook to
Tresidder. But we hope they will realize that their immediate goal
should be improvement of existing services. Expansion of services is a
good idea for the future, but it shouldn't be attempted until those
services already offered are improved dramatically.
The departure of Tresidder Memorial Union Director Forrest
Tregea is long overdue and very welcome. Ever since Tregea came here
in 1968 after resigning under pressure from a similar position at
Cal-Berkeley, Tresidder has been beset by problems.
By August 1972, the Union's operating deficit had risen to
$288,000 and according to Tresidder's financial manager, Gordon
Starr, the University at that time decided to "wipe the slate clean and
give the Union another chance." But a chronic financial deficit has
been only the worst of a long list of problems.
Tresidder food has long been the subject of much displeasure and
while quality hasn't noticeably improved in recent years, prices have
gone up considerably.
The Tresidder store has never been noted for an overly large
selection of goods and its prices make buying at local discount stores a
wise investment.
In addition to the overall poor quality and high prices which
characterize the cafeteria and drug store, each facility has been beset
by numerous specific problems in recent years.
In 1970 the University administration announced that only United
Farm Workers (UFW) lettuce would be used in campus food facilities.
More than once since that policy was announced, non-UFW lettuce
has been used at Tresidder.
Every time the management lias been caught violating the policy,
they claim it was due to an oversight and assure people that it won't
happen again. But somehow it docs. As recently as last quarter,
Trcgea's successor, Gordon Starr, again advanced the oversight theory
and said the practice "would stop immediately." We hope that Starr is
more dependable than his predecessor.
