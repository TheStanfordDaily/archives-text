# 'undeserved good reputation'
## Benjamin Franklin's Tyranny

Some friends of mine who
regularly attend theatrical
pioductions were telling me the
other day about "1776." Among
other things it seems that in this
play the historical figure of
Benjamin Franklin is presented in
a very favorable light. It occurred
to me while listening to my
friends discuss "1776" that
Franklin had an extraordinarily
good image in most popular
treatments of the American

and the Founding Fathers (1961)
speaks of the "empirical temper"
of Franklin's approach.
Richard D. Miles, in his 1948
University of Michigan Ph.D.
dissertation on "The Political
Philosophy of Benjamin
Franklin," writes that the
pragmatic approach has been
"strikingly present on the
American scene. It had its real
beginnings with Benjamin
Franklin, is of less historical

were the harm to the government
caused by smuggling, the black
market, evading the postal
monopoly, and refusing to pay
taxes. Franklin was always writing
about the duty of obedience.
While visiting England in 1768,
Franklin complained that "all
respect to law and government
seems to be lost among the
common people, who are
moreover continually inflamed by
seditious scribblers, to trample on
authority and everything that
used to keep them in order."
As Paul W. Conner points out
in Poor .Richard's Politicks
(1965), "Franklin .. . had spent
most of his life strengthening the
hand of political authority, not
weakening it. Two of his early
crusades were to place trade fairs
and tippling houses under the
watchful eye of government."
Yet in spite of the record of
Franklin's life, he retains an
undeserved image as a champion
of liberty, especially liberty of the
press.
Sedition Debate
Leonard Levy in Legacy of
Suppression (1960) notes that
"Franklin's 1789 essay on the
press . . . was of such a character
that it was quoted at length by
supporters of the Sedition Act
during the House [of
Representatives! debate in 1798."
Franklin clearly believed that a
government could be criminally
assailed by mere words, and in his
Autobiography, he argued that
journals printing scurrilous
reflections on government were an
infamous disgrace.
Benjamin Franklin, without a
doubt, has an undeserved good
reputation. In reality, he was the
source of the pragmatic political
approach to politics in America.
In his hands and in the hands of
others since, this approach has
served to increase the tyranny of
governmental power.
