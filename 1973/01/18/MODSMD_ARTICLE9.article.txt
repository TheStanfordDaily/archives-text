Revolution. But this image is not
the one he deserves, for Franklin's
ideas and his approach to politics
lent themselves directly to the
undermining of the gains of the
American Revolution.
The American Revolution,
along with the French Revolution
and the Industrial Revolution, was
part of the dazzling libertarian
onslaught during the late
eighteenth and early nineteenth
centuries. This onslaught upon the
established feudal order was one
of humanity's brightest hours; yet
even as these revolutions were
taking place, new intellectual
justifications for despotism were
being fashioned to combat the
natural rights doctrine which had
inspired the revolutions.
The natural rights doctrine has
its most famous formulation for
Americans in Thomas Jefferson's
words in the Declaration of
Independence about men's natural
rights to "life, liberty, and the
pursuit of happiness."
Utilitarian Approach
It is precisely this doctrine to
whkh Benjamin Franklin was
opposed. Franklin Was, in many
ways, the founder in America of
the pragmatic, problem-solving,
utilitarian approach to politics.

natural rights doctrine] during the
Revolution, then becomes
dominant in the period of the
formation of the national
government." Much of the credit
then for the new guiding ideas
found in the U.S.
Constitution—ideas that
supplanted the libertarian
principles of the Declaration of
Independence—can be given to
Franklin.
What were the assumptions of
Franklin's pragmatic approach?
According to Miles, "For the
adherents to the pragmatic
tradition, a strong government
with broad powers could achieve
the general good, often taking
measures beyond merely
restraining men from injuring one
another."
Duty of Obedience
Franklin's approach included
equating the government with the
society, an error carefully avoided
by many of Franklin's
contemporaries, like Thomas
Paine. Franklin in 1767 was able
to identify the king and the public
as "different names for the same
thing." Hence among Franklin's
favorite topics for his own
