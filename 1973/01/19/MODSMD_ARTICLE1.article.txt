# Faculty Protesters Urge Severing Military Ties
## 
### CLAIRE SPIEGEL ROBERT BACON 
About 10 members of the Faculty
Political Action Group (FPAG)
yesterday marched from a Cubberley
Auditorium noon rally to a meeting
with President Richard Lyman. They
urged him to sever the University's ties
with the Department of Defense
(DoD).
Earlier, about 25 protesters
confronted two Marine Corps
recruiters in the Placement Center but
disrupted no interviews.
At Lyman's office, Lise Giraud,
wife of French professor and FPAG
member Ray Giraud, presented Lyman
with a letter protesting military
recruiting on campus and the

University's ties with the Defense
Department.
Speaking for the FPAG members
and about 20 supporters who joined
them, she told Lyman, "Stanford
extends a hospitable hand to those
people whose business it is to be the
'iron fist' of American imperialism
abroad. What they are doing at
Stanford is seeking to increase their
ranks."
White Rose
She also gave Lyman a white rose,
which she said was the symbol of a
small group of anti-Hitler professors in
Nazi Germany.
President Lyman questioned the
accuracy of the protesters'
"treacherous" historical analogy
comparing Hitler's Germany with
America today. He said, "There are
many avenues open which were not
open in Germany to take political
action against the government's
policy."
Medicine Professor Hal Holman
argued that although not everyone
agrees that DoD ties should be severed
or that military recruitment be
banned, President Lyman as the
"symbolic leader of the University"
should stand up for "certain
humanitarian values which don't
reflect war, murder, or torture."
Voicing his general disapproval of
the war in Indochina, Lyman
concluded his 20 minute encounter
with the protestors: "We have pursued
the wrong objectives which were not
sensible in the first place and have
become more so over time. I have no
defense of the bombing that has taken
place over Christmas."
Anti-Imperialist
At the noon rally, FPAG speakers
denounced the war in stronger terms.
Assoc. History Prof. Harold Kahn

opened the "anti-imperialist, anti-war"
rally with a "State of the War"
Address which he said was intended
for those committed opponents of
imperialism and war as "our
inauguration of our next four years."
"We can look back to 1964 all over
again." He asked, "Remember when
Kennedy was 'sending advisors' to
Vietnam?"
SLAC Professor Pierre Noyes said,
"In spite of our protest, our
engineering departments continue
their training of personnel for military
electronics. Their research on lasers,
artificial intelligence, parametric
amplifiers, real time signal
discrimination, and rapid data analysis
goes on. These are some of the
techniques which many of us hoped
were only a science fiction writer's
nightmare."
Rachelle Marshall, wife of political
science professor Hubert Marshall,
pleaded on behalf of the Stanford
Women for Peace, "Let's take this
bloody business off the campus."
Marine Recruiters
Earlier yesterday, about 25 anti-war
protesters discussed the Vietnam War
and military policy with two Marine
Corps recruiting officers in the
Placement Center.
The group had announced plans to
"greet" the Marine recruiters at 9:30
a.m. at the building entrance. But the
recruiters arrived shortly after 9 a.m.,
before demonstrators had assembled.
The rain-soaked band of
demonstrators entered the building at
9:50 a.m., and began talking with
Capts. Steve L. Austin and T.C.
McDonald. Austin and McDonald had
no interviews scheduled except with
protesters David Szonyi and Mike
Enos, both of whom invited their
companions to participate.
