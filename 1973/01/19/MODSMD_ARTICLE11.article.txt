## Discrimination Against Older People 
###

Discrimination and rejection of
the older person is rampant
throughout our society and no
less rampant at Stanford. It exists
at all levels. It may be
intellectually denied, denounced
in words, even declared illegal by
law. Yet no one can doubt it;
certainly not the one who looks
for a job nor the employer.
Let me give you one homely
example as it happened here. The
Clinic Business Office in the
Medical Center was reorganized,
the work decentralized and
shifted to the various clinical
departments. There was great
apprehension about possible
layoffs especially among the older
workers, even those with long
years of service. A pall descended
upon the place. Everyone was
quiet, each one hoping to escape
the layoff. No one wanted or
dared to talk.
Nevertheless, I learned of a
woman close to retirement who
was dismissed after almost 10
years here. For her, at this time,
every additional cent earned was
important. The amount of Social
Security and Stanford pension she
would receive were based on these
earnings. Even the maximum
would be insufficient to meet her
needs. She was attempting to set
aside some money each month
toward her mandatory retirement.
I knew of two jobs open for

which she was well qualified. I
phoned the supervisor who was
screening applicants for the
faculty administrator. Yes, she
knew Mrs. M. but felt that the
work was too difficult for an
older person. When reminded that
Mrs. M. had efficiently performed
almost identical work for many
years, she admitted that this was
not the main consideration. She
thought it might be difficult for
an older person "TO TAKE
ORDERS" from a younger
supervisor — herself. To top this
she stated that the other workers
in the group were all young and
Mrs. M. just would not fit in!
Repressing my anger, I quoted the
Federal law prohibiting
discrimination because of age.
I phoned Mrs. M. and offered

the help of United Stanford
Employees. Her answer was, "No,
Julia, I will not fight now. I
cannot let myself go through all
that bitterness and frustration
again. Yes, I am defeated but I
have neither the desire nor
strength to buck the
discrimination all of us older
workers experienced when the
reorganization took place."
Certainly Personnel would not
condone such openly voiced
blatant discrimination. Yet, why
did they never find her a job?
Personnel policies gave Mrs. M.
job priorities on paper but
Personnel has neither the
know-how, nor the will, nor the
power to enforce its own rules.
They were content to let her fade
away.

1 knew how she felt then — the
anger, the bitterness, the final
resignation! How well I know it
now for I too, after a quarter of a
century of serving Stanford, face a
layoff. Am I being discriminated
because of age? No? Certainly no
one would allow such feeling to
surface much less express it and
proof would be difficult. Yet I
feel it in my bones as I look into
the faces I meet when
interviewing for a job. But I won't
fade away!
Will you help? You, too, will
get older, be used and be
discarded at the will or arbitrary
conditions set solely by the
employer.
