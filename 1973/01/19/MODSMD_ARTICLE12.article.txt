"Show me a man without
fantasies and I'll show you a
vegetable."
—Old Mountain Saying
Fantasy is as much a part of
existence as the real world our
senses perceive. It may manifest
itself to different people in
different ways, but few can escape
its grasp.
Everyone has a different
purpose in his use of fantasy:
some just sit back and daydream;
I try to use the fantastic in these
columns as a means to ridicule the
normal and hopefully provoke
some emotion in my reader.
Most fantasy seems to rely on
some past associations the mind
has managed to dredge up. I've
recently been plagued by a vision
of myself dressed in an avocado
costume, being whipped into
guacamole. But that's not
abnormal, considering some
elements of my past.
This whole vegetable fetishism
of mine (leaf through last year's
Dailies and you'll find that nearly
every feature story I wrote
contained some reference to
zucchini) stems from my summer
job two years ago.
Giant Zucchinis
At that time I was nature
counselor in a children's summer
camp north of S.F., in charge of
the camp's garden. This
weedpatch managed to regularly
produce three foot long zucchinis,
each weighing in at over 15
pounds (gross).
So it's not hard to trace the
origins of some of my wildest
fantasies, and by doing the
guesswork myself I saved a
fortune in psychoanalysis fees.
Why don't you examine your
fantasies — look for trends,
patterns, objects that stand out —
and see if you can't find some
past experience or pieces of an
early environment that started
your imagination on its crazy
present turn?
Little Leland
I've already told you one
fantasy (to get my column's
quota) and we've looked into my
past to discover the cause. Now
we're going to do the reverse:
look at some bits of a child's
environment and proceed to his
fantasies.
But I'm not the child in
question. I thought my past was
rich with fantasy-laden
associations until I discovered
someone who has got everybody
beat: Leland Stanford Junior.
Yes, the founding reason for

this school, our very own
namesake, has a collection of
childhood items so incredibly
diverse and unusual that the only
reason he's not fantasizing about
them is that he's dead.

So you think up the fantasies
for little Leland. I know he would
have wanted it that way.
Mail Your Fantasies
What follows, therefore, is a
list of items from Leland Jr.'s
collection (all of them on exhibit
at the Stanford Museum). All you
have to do is put some or all these
items together into a fantasy and
mail your fantasies (max. V2 typed
page, please) to Jerry Coleman,
717 Dolores St., Stanford, Ca.
94305.
Then, when I get enough of
your fantasy-entries, I'll put them
into a column, complete with
your name and campus residence.
I might even give a prize for the
best fantasy. This contest is real!
Here is your big chance to get
your name in the paper — to show
the 20,000 members of the
Stanford community that you've
got a blossoming imagination.
And it's my chance to see just
how many people read my
columns.
Leland's Collection
So if you're tired of all the
politics and dull news in this
paper, now you can do something
about it. Help this "On The Light
Side" section shine! Read the list

think up a fantasy, and send it in

have wanted it that way.
Mail Your Fantasies
What follows, therefore, is a
list of items from Leland Jr.'s
collection (all of them on exhibit
at the Stanford Museum). All you
have to do is put some or all these
items together into a fantasy and
mail your fantasies (max. V2 typed
page, please) to Jerry Coleman,
717 Dolores St., Stanford, Ca.
94305.
Then, when I get enough of
your fantasy-entries, I'll put them
into a column, complete with
your name and campus residence.
I might even give a prize for the
best fantasy. This contest is real!
Here is your big chance to get
your name in the paper — to show
the 20,000 members of the
Stanford community that you've
got a blossoming imagination.
And it's my chance to see just
how many people read my
columns.
Leland's Collection
So if you're tired of all the
politics and dull news in this
paper, now you can do something
about it. Help this "On The Light
Side" section shine! Read the list
of Leland Jr.'s collection below,
think up a fantasy, and send it in
today!

"Show me a man without
fantasies and I'll show you a
vegetable."
—Old Mountain Saying
Fantasy is as much a part of
existence as the real world our
senses perceive. It may manifest
itself to different people in
different ways, but few can escape
its grasp.
Everyone has a different
purpose in his use of fantasy:
some just sit back and daydream;
I try to use the fantastic in these
columns as a means to ridicule the
normal and hopefully provoke
some emotion in my reader.
Most fantasy seems to rely on
some past associations the mind
has managed to dredge up. I've
recently been plagued by a vision
of myself dressed in an avocado
costume, being whipped into
guacamole. But that's not
abnormal, considering some
elements of my past.
This whole vegetable fetishism
of mine (leaf through last year's
Dailies and you'll find that nearly
every feature story I wrote
contained some reference to
zucchini) stems from my summer
job two years ago.
Giant Zucchinis
At that time I was nature
counselor in a children's summer
camp north of S.F., in charge of
the camp's garden. This
weedpatch managed to regularly
produce three foot long zucchinis,
each weighing in at over 15
pounds (gross).
So it's not hard to trace the
origins of some of my wildest
fantasies, and by doing the
guesswork myself I saved a
fortune in psychoanalysis fees.
Why don't you examine your
fantasies — look for trends,
patterns, objects that stand out —
and see if you can't find some
past experience or pieces of an
early environment that started
your imagination on its crazy
present turn?
Little Leland
I've already told you one
fantasy (to get my column's
quota) and we've looked into my
past to discover the cause. Now
we're going to do the reverse:
look at some bits of a child's
environment and proceed to his
fantasies.
But I'm not the child in
question. I thought my past was
rich with fantasy-laden
associations until I discovered
someone who has got everybody
beat: Leland Stanford Junior.
Yes, the founding reason for

this school, our very own
namesake, has a collection of
childhood items so incredibly
diverse and unusual that the only
reason he's not fantasizing about
them is that he's dead.

existence as the real world our
senses perceive. It may manifest
itself to different people in
different ways, but few can escape
its grasp.
Everyone has a different
purpose in his use of fantasy:
some just sit back and daydream;
I try to use the fantastic in these
columns as a means to ridicule the
normal and hopefully provoke
some emotion in my reader.
Most fantasy seems to rely on
some past associations the mind
has managed to dredge up. I've
recently been plagued by a vision
of myself dressed in an avocado
costume, being whipped into
guacamole. But that's not
abnormal, considering some
elements of my past.
This whole vegetable fetishism
of mine (leaf through last year's
Dailies and you'll find that nearly
every feature story I wrote
contained some reference to
zucchini) stems from my summer
job two years ago.
Giant Zucchinis
At that time I was nature
counselor in a children's summer
camp north of S.F., in charge of
the camp's garden. This
weedpatch managed to regularly
produce three foot long zucchinis,
each weighing in at over 15
pounds (gross).
So it's not hard to trace the
origins of some of my wildest
fantasies, and by doing the
guesswork myself I saved a
fortune in psychoanalysis fees.
Why don't you examine your
fantasies — look for trends,
patterns, objects that stand out —
and see if you can't find some
past experience or pieces of an
early environment that started
your imagination on its crazy
present turn?
Little Leland
I've already told you one
fantasy (to get my column's
quota) and we've looked into my
past to discover the cause. Now
we're going to do the reverse:
look at some bits of a child's
environment and proceed to his
fantasies.
But I'm not the child in
question. I thought my past was
rich with fantasy-laden
associations until I discovered
someone who has got everybody
beat: Leland Stanford Junior.
Yes, the founding reason for

this school, our very own
namesake, has a collection of
childhood items so incredibly
diverse and unusual that the only
reason he's not fantasizing about
them is that he's dead.

So you think up the fantasies
for little Leland. I know he would
have wanted it that way.
Mail Your Fantasies
What follows, therefore, is a
list of items from Leland Jr.'s
collection (all of them on exhibit
at the Stanford Museum). All you
have to do is put some or all these
items together into a fantasy and
mail your fantasies (max. V2 typed
page, please) to Jerry Coleman,
717 Dolores St., Stanford, Ca.
94305.
Then, when I get enough of
your fantasy-entries, I'll put them
into a column, complete with
your name and campus residence.
I might even give a prize for the
best fantasy. This contest is real!
Here is your big chance to get
your name in the paper — to show
the 20,000 members of the
Stanford community that you've
got a blossoming imagination.
And it's my chance to see just
how many people read my
columns.
Leland's Collection
So if you're tired of all the
politics and dull news in this
paper, now you can do something
about it. Help this "On The Light
Side" section shine! Read the list
of Leland Jr.'s collection below,
think up a fantasy, and send it in
today!
