Inauguration March
Editor:
When Kissinger announced that
peace was at hand in October, I
believed it. So I don't believe it
now, and I won't believe it until
the Vietnamese announce that a
settlement has been signed. Until
then, I will assume that Nixon will
not end the war without massive
public pressure. So I will be going
to the Inauguration Day
demonstration in San Francisco
on Saturday.
The demonstration will begin
at 10 a.m. at Garfield Square
(25th and Harrison, near Army
Street) and march to Dolores Park
(18th and Dolores) for a rally at
noon. The major demand of the
demonstration is that the U.S.
sign the peace agreement. After so
many years, this might appear to
be a futile gesture, but I don't
think so.
It is clear that the only reasons
that Nixon stopped the recent
bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong
were the heavy U.S. losses of men
and B-52's and the massive
international outcry against the
bombing. The peace movement
has been gearing up for

Inauguration Day demonstrations
ever since we realized the extent
of the bombings.
Nixon may well be using this
latest round of peace rumors to
cool out the peace movement
until after his inauguration, when
he can again claim to have a free
hand in Vietnam. If the
Inauguration Day demonstrations
are small, he will have
accomplished this purpose.
Even if an agreement is signed,
we will have to be vigilant to
insure that Nixon doesn't renege.
Even if there is a settlement, the
U.S. will not cease to exploit most
of the people of the world if we
don't stop it. Even if the war is
over, U.S. workers will continue
to fight for decent lives, and the
Black and Chicano nations will
continue to fight for
self-determination. We should
support these struggles.
But for now, it is foolish to
assume that the war will be over
soon. Massive demonstrations will
help to assure that Nixon doesn't
back out this time.
If you have ever thought that
you opposed the war in
Indochina, for whatever reason,
you should be on the streets of
San Francisco Saturday morning.
Not to be there is to betray
yourselves and the Indochinese
people. See you there.

Marine Corps Ads
Editor:
We were rather chagrined to
read in Wednesday's paper that
the Daily has taken to advertising
for the Marine Corps. If it is
wrong to permit the military to
recruit at the Placement Center —
as a majority of the student body
has voted, despite the
administration's choosing to
ignore us — then it is also wrong
to run ads for the Marines.
The damage of the ad has been
done. Let it serve to bring people
to the Placement Center to tell
the Marines what we feel about
their organization.
Nevertheless, it is also not right
that the Daily should profit from
this ad. So we ask that the Daily
take the revenue from the Marine
Corps ad, and give it to the Bach
Mai Hospital fund.

Five years ago General Curtis
LeMay promised to "bomb
Vietnam back into the stone age."
Nixon has tried to carry out that
promise.
Whether or not a ceasefire is
declared, we must respond to the
callousness of our rulers toward
human life. Certainly we must
join the Port Chicago vigil or one
of the city demonstrations on
Saturday. But anger is not
enough. We must also give aid to
those we have terrorized.
We at Columbae House will
fast on Saturday, inauguration
day; and send the money we save
on food to Medical Aid for
Indochina, which will use it to
buy medical supplies for the
victims of the bombing. We
encourage others to do the same,
or to help in any way they can.
Donations may be sent c/o
SCOPE, ASSU office, 208
Tresidder, Stanford; or dropped
off at the Medical Aid table by
the Post Office.
We paid for the bombs. Let's
pay for the medicine.

we will have to be vigilant to

Even if there is a settlement, the
U.S. will not cease to exploit most
of the people of the world if we
don't stop it. Even if the war is
over, U.S. workers will continue
to fight for decent lives, and the
Black and Chicano nations will

self-determination. We should

But for now, it is foolish to

Marine Corps Ads
Editor:
We were rather chagrined to
read in Wednesday's paper that
the Daily has taken to advertising
for the Marine Corps. If it is
wrong to permit the military to
recruit at the Placement Center —
as a majority of the student body
has voted, despite the
administration's choosing to
ignore us — then it is also wrong
to run ads for the Marines.
The damage of the ad has been
done. Let it serve to bring people
to the Placement Center to tell
the Marines what we feel about
their organization.
Nevertheless, it is also not right
that the Daily should profit from
this ad. So we ask that the Daily
take the revenue from the Marine
Corps ad, and give it to the Bach
Mai Hospital fund.

Back To The
Stone Age?
Editor:
Five years ago General Curtis
LeMay promised to "bomb
Vietnam back into the stone age."
Nixon has tried to carry out that
promise.
Whether or not a ceasefire is
declared, we must respond to the
callousness of our rulers toward
human life. Certainly we must
join the Port Chicago vigil or one
of the city demonstrations on
Saturday. But anger is not
enough. We must also give aid to
those we have terrorized.
We at Columbae House will
fast on Saturday, inauguration
day; and send the money we save
on food to Medical Aid for
Indochina, which will use it to
buy medical supplies for the
victims of the bombing. We
encourage others to do the same,
or to help in any way they can.
Donations may be sent c/o
SCOPE, ASSU office, 208
Tresidder, Stanford; or dropped
off at the Medical Aid table by
the Post Office.
We paid for the bombs. Let's
pay for the medicine.

Inauguration March
Editor:
When Kissinger announced that
peace was at hand in October, I
believed it. So I don't believe it
now, and I won't believe it until
the Vietnamese announce that a
settlement has been signed. Until
then, I will assume that Nixon will
not end the war without massive
public pressure. So I will be going
to the Inauguration Day
demonstration in San Francisco
on Saturday.
The demonstration will begin
at 10 a.m. at Garfield Square
(25th and Harrison, near Army
Street) and march to Dolores Park
(18th and Dolores) for a rally at
noon. The major demand of the
demonstration is that the U.S.
sign the peace agreement. After so
many years, this might appear to
be a futile gesture, but I don't
think so.
It is clear that the only reasons
that Nixon stopped the recent
bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong
were the heavy U.S. losses of men
and B-52's and the massive
international outcry against the
bombing. The peace movement
has been gearing up for

Inauguration Day demonstrations
ever since we realized the extent
of the bombings.
Nixon may well be using this
latest round of peace rumors to
cool out the peace movement
until after his inauguration, when
he can again claim to have a free
hand in Vietnam. If the
Inauguration Day demonstrations
are small, he will have
accomplished this purpose.
Even if an agreement is signed,
we will have to be vigilant to
insure that Nixon doesn't renege.
Even if there is a settlement, the
U.S. will not cease to exploit most
of the people of the world if we
