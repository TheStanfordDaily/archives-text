Why can't the registrar's office hire somebody to give information
over the telephone other than those who handle in person requests for
information? The present setup causes delays both to people waiting
in the Old Union lobby and to people calling on the phone, who find
the line invariably busy, and when they finally get connected, have to
wait several minutes for service.
Isn't there enough money, or hasn't anybody ever thought of this
(highly unlikely), or what? .4 sit stands now, there is simply more
work than they are able to handle, or so it seems to those who call
them for information. R. 0.8.
The situation should be improving, according to Armista Cook,
information supervisor in the registrars office. The office just two
weeks ago hired a new person who is now training to help answer the
information telephone and take over some of the other duties in the
office. In the past there has only been one person answering the
phone, and everyone agrees that there are too many calls for just one
person.
If the situation does not clear up with the added personnel then
additional measures such as perhaps adding another phone line may be
considered. Meanwhile, the people in that office are trying their best
to help everyone who calls, so try to be patient if they are busy.
I have found that it is very hazardous to exit from the parking lots
north of Tresidder at night because the hedge on the divider
completely hides sports cars. Can the gardeners take out some of the
hedge in a few places so that the lights of the cars can be seen? G.R.
Yes, in fact that problem was just recently discussed in the plant
services department and the hedge trimming is scheduled for next
week.
Why can't we have the Super Bowl in Stanford stadium?
This question has come up before in staff meetings and the major
objections were: 1) the non-profit tax status of the University
precludes its allowing facilities to be used for profit making activities.
2) the parking and traffic problems would be a mess 3) having the
game at Stanford could cause a blackout of the television broadcast in
the San Francisco bay area which could bring down the wrath of
thousands. In short it might not be good public relations.
What was the name of Dudley Do-right's horse?
To the best of the Daily's admittedly meager resources, the answer
is it did not have a name. We all remembered Nell, Major Fenwick and
Snidely Whiplash — but the horse???
Most employers keep track of how much vacation time and sick
leave each of their employees have taken by printing that information
on their paychecks. Stanford does not. Our paychecks have boxes for
that purpose, but they never show anything. Why? S.U.
According to the payroll department there is no way of inputting
this information into the computer which handles paychecks. They
don't expect to develop this capability in the near future, either.
However, they are trying to develop a new payroll system called
"Oasis," which may or may not have this capability. The problem
apparently arises because of all the extra paperwork which would be
involved — at least that's what they told me.
