# CAB Threatens Youth Air Fares

Stanford students may have to
pay more than they have in the
past for a flight home this spring.
The student standby fares offered
by major airlines are likely to be
cancelled soon, according to
industry spokesmen.

On Dec. 7, the Civil
Aeronautics Board ruled these
fares unjustly discriminatory. The
special fares allow students to fly
for 25 to 33 percent less than
normal cost. However the Board
did defer cancellation of these
fares pending further hearing on

the question of an adjustment to
normal fares.
Marty Lever of United Airlines
in San Francisco says that he
believes the increase in fare will
more than compensate for the loss
of student passengers due to the
fare increase. Less than 10 percent
of United's revenues come from
standby flyers.
However, a spokesman for the
ASSU Charter Service, and Ken
Erickson, manager of Western
Airlines in San Francisco, both
said they believe student standby
will be discontinued by spring.
They expect the use of charters
will largely take the place of
standby flying.
Air carriers such as Western
have "four Group Charters"
which universities and any other
large groups can use with much
less expense, by reserving a whole
airplane at least three months
ahead of the flight. Stanford is
currently using TWA and United
Airline Charters to shuttle
students to New York,
Washington and Chicago at
vacation time.
Lever says that his firm and
most other major air carriers

support the CAB ruling. United
has said it cannot see where to
draw the line on special fares.
Therefore, it is supporting the
CAB for cancellation of not only
special student fares but also
family fares. ,
In January, 1968, a CAB
examiner ruled that discount fares
limited to persons 12 to 21 years
old discriminated unjustly because
age alone isn't a valid distinction
between passengers. Soon after,
the Board reportedly received
sackloads of mail from college
students and the Board reversed
its decision, postponing any final
decision until a study was
completed.
