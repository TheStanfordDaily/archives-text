# McCloskey's Aid Sought In Frenchman's Funding
## 
### 
University officials have asked
Rep. Paul "Pete" McCloskey
(R-Portola Valley) to do all within
his power to obtain federal funds
for the Frenchman's Terrace
housing project, despite a
moratorium on federal funding
for housing developments.
The 225-unit low/moderate
income project is planned for 20
acres of Stanford land at the
corner of Peter Coutts and Page
Mill Roads.
On Jan. 8, federal officials
announced an 18-month freeze on
grants to localities for housing
construction, effective at once.
Letters from President Richard
Lyman and Vice President for
Business and Finance Robert R.
Augsburger asking McCloskey's
assistance were delivered to
McCloskey's Washington staff this
week by Vice Provost Robert
Rosenzweig.
McCloskey's staff has asked
University officials for
clarification of the exact status of
the Frenchman's Terrace
proposal. A spokesman for the
Congressman said yesterday that
when this is received, "We will be
actively looking into alternative
means of obtaining funds for the
project."
Lyman and Augsburger
stressed to McCloskey that
Frenchman's Terrace would help
meet "an obvious social need."
Lyman told McCloskey, "It
would be a tragedy to have the
project flounder now that it has
been approved in principle by

Palo Alto and is so near fruition."
He also noted that
Frenchman's Terrace is unique in
that it marshals University and
community resources to begin to
solve a common problem.
Augsburger stressed that
Frenchman's Terrace would
provide "better housing closer to
jobs for many families, and a
corresponding. reduction of
automobile traffic."
His letter was also signed by Ira
Hall, Stanford Trustee and
Executive Director of the
Stanford-Midpeninsula Urban
Coalition, sponsors of the
Frenchman's Terrace project.
