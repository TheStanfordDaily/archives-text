## 
### 
Stanford Sierra Camp is
accepting applications for student
employment for the coming
summer season. Approximately
30 staff positions are available to
students here. This year the camp
will be open from June 16 to
September 8.
Stanford Sierra Camp is owned
and operated as a non-profit
recreation facility for alumni,
staff, faculty, and friends of the
University. The purpose of the
camp is to promote alumni
relations and establish a
communications link between the
alumni and students for their
mutual education. The camp has

been serving the Stanford
community since the mid 1950's
and has proven to be one of the
most popular programs sponsored
by the Alumni Association.
The camp is located at Fallen
Leaf Lake, adjacent to Lake
Tahoe. It lies at the end of a
winding, "one car" road in the
Sierra Nevada mountains and
within an hour's hike of the
Desolation Wilderness area.
According to spokesman Tim
Carpenter, the success of the
camp lies with students who work
there; their enthusiasm and
creativity make camp what it is.
The available jobs vary greatly;

they include hashing in the dining
room, operating the camp's
fountain and general store,
working with children between
the ages of three and eight,
organizing youth programs,
instructing arts and crafts for all
ages, leading hikes and nature
walks, and directing a number of
water sports such as skiing, sailing,
playacting, and swimming.
Normally, staff are assigned to
work in more than one area,
totaling about 45 hours per week.
In addition staff are given the
opportunity to utilize their special
talents in the weekly cabin
cleaning on Saturday morning.
Staff members also participate in
various unstructured weekly
programs such as the talent show,
waterski show, student panel, and
campfire, which require an
additional two to three hours
work every week on the part of
each staff. Staff members are
assigned work six days a week
with one day off.
"Compensation for services
rendered" comes in the form of a
weekly salary, room and board,
and the use of all camp facilities
whenever they are not being used
by camp guests.
Students who are interested in
applying for summer work should
see Jan Ready at Bowman Alumni
House for an application and
interview. The application
deadline is Feb. 1.

Normally, staff are assigned to
work in more than one area,
totaling about 45 hours per week.
In addition staff are given the
opportunity to utilize their special
talents in the weekly cabin
cleaning on Saturday morning.
Staff members also participate in
various unstructured weekly
programs such as the talent show,
waterski show, student panel, and
campfire, which require an
additional two to three hours
work every week on the part of
each staff. Staff members are
assigned work six days a week
with one day off.
"Compensation for services
rendered" comes in the form of a
weekly salary, room and board,
and the use of all camp facilities
whenever they are not being used
by camp guests.
Students who are interested in
applying for summer work should
see Jan Ready at Bowman Alumni
House for an application and
interview. The application
deadline is Feb. 1.
