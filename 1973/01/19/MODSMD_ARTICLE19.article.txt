# Harvard Prof Named Medical Chairman
## 
### 
Dr. Daniel D. Federman,
associate professor of medicine
and associate dean for continuing
education at Harvard Medical
School, has been appointed
professor and chairman of the
Department of Medicine.
The appointment, which
culminates a one-year search,
becomes effective Feb. 1. It was
announced Jan. 17 by Dr. Clayton
Rich, dean of the school of
Medicine and vice-president for
medical affairs.
The new chairman will head
the school's largest department,
including 11 divisions from
cardiology to respiratory
medicine. The department has
responsibility for the clinical
medical training of medical
students, house staff and
postdoctoral fellows at Stanford.
Dr. Federman, 44, is a
nationally-known expert in
clinical endocrinology and
hormonal influences on human
sexual development.
Teaching Interest
His primary interest, however,
is in teaching. Twice he won

awards for outstanding teaching
from Harvard medical students.
Director of the school's program
in continuing education since
1966, he developed numerous
pioneering educational programs
for practicing physicians.
As assistant chief of medical
services and chairman of the
committee on teaching and
education at the Massachusetts
General Hospital, the largest of
Harvard's teaching hospitals, he
was responsible for the training of
the hospital's medical house staff.
At Stanford, Dr. Federman
succeeds Dr. Eugene D. Robin,
who has served as acting
department chairman since Dr.
Halsted R. Holman resigned in
October of 1971.
Dr. Federman said that in
addition to continuing the focus
on scientific excellence and
research at Stanford, he hopes to
place increased emphasis on
"superlative clinical care and
teaching."
Clinical Conduct
"Departments of Medicine
should critically re-examine every
aspect of clinical conduct," he
said, "from the rudiments of
history-taking and physical
examinations to the refinements
of using therapeutic drugs."
One of the challenges facing
medical educators today, he said,
is to prepare students for the new
demands being placed on
physicians.
"The cost-plus basis of medical
care will no longer be tolerated,"
he said, "and we must learn how
to rationalize the interaction
among science, humanism, and
economics. There are many new
roles for physicians, and the old
ones — such as general practioner
— are being reformulated.
Departments of Medicine should
be able to prepare students, house
staff and fellows for any role in
medicine."
Noted Researcher
Dr. Federman's research and
clinical interests have focused on
the relationship between
endocrinology and genetics. With
his associates at Massachusetts
General, he defined a new
hereditary disorder of connective

tissue characterized by dwarfism,
joint stiffness, and eye defects. He
was among the first to describe
translocation of a portion of the
human Y chromosome.
His textbook, Abnormal
Sexual Development: A Genetic
and Endocrine Approach to
Differential Diagnosis, published
in 1967, has been widely
acclaimed.
A native of New York City, Dr.
Federman obtained his A.B. in
1949 and his M.D. in 1953 from
Harvard. He completed his
internship and residency in
medicine at Massachusetts
General.
After two years as clinical
associate at the National Institute
of Arthritis and Metabolic
Diseases in Bethesda, Maryland,
he served a year as a clinical
research fellow at the University
College Hospital Medical School
in London, England.
Dr. Federman was appointed
assistant professor of medicine at
Harvard in 1966 and rose to
associate professor four years
later. In 1968 he also was
appointed faculty counsellor to
Harvard's chapter of Alpha Omega
Alpha, the medical honorary
society.
He is a diplomate of the
American Board of Internal
Medicine, a fellow of the
American College of Physicians,
and a member of the Endocrine
Society and the American Society
for Human Genetics among
others.
Past president of the Boylston
Medical Society, he is a member
of the editorial board of the
Journal of Clinical Endocrinology.
Dr. and Mrs. Federman have
two children. They plan to live in
Palo Alto.

ends a year long search to replace Dr. Halsted R. Holman who retired
in October of 1971. Federman will leave his position as associate dean
for continuing education at Harvard Medical School.
Dr. Daniel D. Federman,
associate professor of medicine
and associate dean for continuing
education at Harvard Medical
School, has been appointed
professor and chairman of the
Department of Medicine.
The appointment, which
culminates a one-year search,
becomes effective Feb. 1. It was
announced Jan. 17 by Dr. Clayton
Rich, dean of the school of
Medicine and vice-president for
medical affairs.
The new chairman will head
the school's largest department,
including 11 divisions from
cardiology to respiratory
medicine. The department has
responsibility for the clinical
medical training of medical
students, house staff and
postdoctoral fellows at Stanford.
Dr. Federman, 44, is a
nationally-known expert in
clinical endocrinology and
hormonal influences on human
sexual development.
Teaching Interest
His primary interest, however,
is in teaching. Twice he won

awards for outstanding teaching
from Harvard medical students.
Director of the school's program
in continuing education since
1966, he developed numerous
pioneering educational programs
for practicing physicians.
As assistant chief of medical
services and chairman of the
committee on teaching and
education at the Massachusetts
General Hospital, the largest of
Harvard's teaching hospitals, he
was responsible for the training of
the hospital's medical house staff.
At Stanford, Dr. Federman
succeeds Dr. Eugene D. Robin,
who has served as acting
department chairman since Dr.
Halsted R. Holman resigned in
October of 1971.
Dr. Federman said that in
addition to continuing the focus
on scientific excellence and
research at Stanford, he hopes to
place increased emphasis on
"superlative clinical care and
teaching."
Clinical Conduct
"Departments of Medicine
should critically re-examine every
aspect of clinical conduct," he
said, "from the rudiments of
history-taking and physical
examinations to the refinements
of using therapeutic drugs."
One of the challenges facing
medical educators today, he said,
is to prepare students for the new
demands being placed on
physicians.
"The cost-plus basis of medical
care will no longer be tolerated,"
he said, "and we must learn how
to rationalize the interaction
among science, humanism, and
economics. There are many new
roles for physicians, and the old
ones — such as general practioner
— are being reformulated.
Departments of Medicine should
be able to prepare students, house
staff and fellows for any role in
medicine."
Noted Researcher
Dr. Federman's research and
clinical interests have focused on
the relationship between
endocrinology and genetics. With
his associates at Massachusetts
General, he defined a new
hereditary disorder of connective

tissue characterized by dwarfism,
joint stiffness, and eye defects. He
was among the first to describe
translocation of a portion of the
human Y chromosome.
His textbook, Abnormal
Sexual Development: A Genetic
and Endocrine Approach to
Differential Diagnosis, published
in 1967, has been widely
acclaimed.
A native of New York City, Dr.
Federman obtained his A.B. in
1949 and his M.D. in 1953 from
Harvard. He completed his
internship and residency in
medicine at Massachusetts
General.
After two years as clinical
associate at the National Institute
of Arthritis and Metabolic
Diseases in Bethesda, Maryland,
he served a year as a clinical
research fellow at the University
College Hospital Medical School
in London, England.
Dr. Federman was appointed
assistant professor of medicine at
Harvard in 1966 and rose to
associate professor four years
later. In 1968 he also was
appointed faculty counsellor to
Harvard's chapter of Alpha Omega
Alpha, the medical honorary
society.
He is a diplomate of the
American Board of Internal
Medicine, a fellow of the
American College of Physicians,
and a member of the Endocrine
Society and the American Society
for Human Genetics among
others.
Past president of the Boylston
Medical Society, he is a member
of the editorial board of the
Journal of Clinical Endocrinology.
Dr. and Mrs. Federman have
two children. They plan to live in
Palo Alto.
