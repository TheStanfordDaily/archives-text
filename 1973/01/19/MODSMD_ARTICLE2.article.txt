# Corona Found Guilty Of Murder But One Juror Still Has Doubts
## 
### 
FAIRFIELD (AP) — Juan Corona was
convicted on 25 counts of murder
yesterday in the 1971 slayingsof farm
workers and drifters near Yuba City.
But last night the last holdout juror
said "I doubt I made the right
decision .... Juan Corona deserves
another trial."
The verdict came in the Yuba City
slayings of 25 transient farm workers
and drifters whose hacked and stabbed
bodies were secretly buried in peach
orchards on the banks of the winding
Feather River 100 miles northeast of
San Francisco in the spring of 1971.
Corona, who did not testify in his
defense, was led away with his
manacled hands gripping a book on
U.S. citizenship. His sentence, which
could be a maximum of life in prison,
is to be handed down by presiding
Judge Richard E. Patton sometime
after an appeal hearing, set for Jan. 29.
Under California law, life term
prisoners are eligible for a parole
hearing after seven years. Dist. Atty.
G. Dave Teja told a news conference
that if Patton chose to impose 25
consecutive life terms, Corona might
not be eligible for parole for up to 175
years.
Deserves Another Trial
Naomi Underwood, 61, who
changed her vote yesterday morning to
make the panel unanimous for
conviction, said she feels Corona
"deserves another trial."
Underwood, interviewed after the
verdict, showed newsmen three pages
in a notebook in which she said she
listed her "reasonable doubts" of
Corona's guilt.

"I have doubts yet," she said. "I
don't think they [the prosecution]
had enough evidence. I still doubt I
made the right decision."
Underwood added, "I do feel Juan
Corona deserves another trial. It would
give him another chance to clear
himself."
She refused to say other jurors
coerced her decision but commented,
"the pressure was pretty great."
The jury of 10 men and two
women had deliberated seven days
after the 14-week trial. The panel
announced Tuesday it had reached a
deadlock of 11-1, but it was not until
yesterday that it became known which
way the jury was leaning.
15 Ballots
Jury foreman Ernest Phillips told a
reporter the first jury vote was 7-5 for
acquittal and that it took 15 secret
ballots to reach a verdict.
Phillips said he changed his mind
several times and the "only thing" that
bothered him was the lack of an
eyewitness, the circumstantial nature
of the evidence.
"How on earth can someone
brutally murder 25 people, haul them
all over the town, bury all those bodies
and nobody see him?" he asked.
Phillips said that jurors were "very
surprised" when Corona's attorney did
not call any witnesses. "The defense
did not make the case they expected. I
don't know if they had any case," he
said.
After the verdicts were read, the
judge thanked the panel for "a
substantial contribution to the
administration of justice" and

dismissed it.
Defense counsel Richard E. Hawk
told a crowd of reporters that on
hearing the verdict, Corona "asked me
to do something I could not bring
myself to do. He asked me to thank
the jury for its attention to the case."
Just after the verdicts, Patton
handed down contempt of court
sentences for attorneys on both sides,
to be served after Hawk's motion for a
new trial. Hawk was sentenced to 74
days and fined $4200 and prosecutor
Teja and his assistant received seven
days each.
Gag Order
Several times during the trial,
Patton had warned attorneys about

their remarks in court and comments
to reporters. A gag order was in effect.
It was an hour and 15 minutes after
the jury of 10 men and two women
announced it had reached the verdict
before court was convened because
Corona had to be brought from the
California Medical Facility in Vacaville
eight miles away, where he had been
recuperating from chest pains suffered
a week ago.
Corona had been confined without
bail for 603 days, since his arrest May
26, 1971.
Teja, who left the courtroom
smoking a cigar and shaking hands
with bailiffs, told reporters: "I'm a
most happy fella."

listed her "reasonable doubts" of
Corona's guilt.

"I have doubts yet," she said. "I
don't think they [the prosecution]
had enough evidence. I still doubt I
made the right decision."
Underwood added, "I do feel Juan
Corona deserves another trial. It would
give him another chance to clear
himself."
She refused to say other jurors
coerced her decision but commented,
"the pressure was pretty great."
The jury of 10 men and two
women had deliberated seven days
after the 14-week trial. The panel
announced Tuesday it had reached a
deadlock of 11-1, but it was not until
yesterday that it became known which
way the jury was leaning.
15 Ballots
Jury foreman Ernest Phillips told a
reporter the first jury vote was 7-5 for
acquittal and that it took 15 secret
ballots to reach a verdict.
Phillips said he changed his mind
several times and the "only thing" that
bothered him was the lack of an
eyewitness, the circumstantial nature
of the evidence.
"How on earth can someone
brutally murder 25 people, haul them
all over the town, bury all those bodies
and nobody see him?" he asked.
Phillips said that jurors were "very
surprised" when Corona's attorney did
not call any witnesses. "The defense
did not make the case they expected. I
don't know if they had any case," he
said.
After the verdicts were read, the
judge thanked the panel for "a
substantial contribution to the
administration of justice" and

dismissed it.
Defense counsel Richard E. Hawk
told a crowd of reporters that on
hearing the verdict, Corona "asked me
to do something I could not bring
myself to do. He asked me to thank
the jury for its attention to the case."
Just after the verdicts, Patton
handed down contempt of court
sentences for attorneys on both sides,
to be served after Hawk's motion for a
new trial. Hawk was sentenced to 74
days and fined $4200 and prosecutor
Teja and his assistant received seven
days each.
Gag Order
Several times during the trial,
Patton had warned attorneys about

their remarks in court and comments
to reporters. A gag order was in effect.
It was an hour and 15 minutes after
the jury of 10 men and two women
announced it had reached the verdict
before court was convened because
Corona had to be brought from the
California Medical Facility in Vacaville
eight miles away, where he had been
recuperating from chest pains suffered
a week ago.
Corona had been confined without
bail for 603 days, since his arrest May
26, 1971.
Teja, who left the courtroom
smoking a cigar and shaking hands
with bailiffs, told reporters: "I'm a
most happy fella."
FAIRFIELD (AP) — Juan Corona was
convicted on 25 counts of murder
yesterday in the 1971 slayingsof farm
workers and drifters near Yuba City.
But last night the last holdout juror
said "I doubt I made the right
decision .... Juan Corona deserves
another trial."
The verdict came in the Yuba City
slayings of 25 transient farm workers
and drifters whose hacked and stabbed
bodies were secretly buried in peach
orchards on the banks of the winding
Feather River 100 miles northeast of
San Francisco in the spring of 1971.
Corona, who did not testify in his
defense, was led away with his
manacled hands gripping a book on
U.S. citizenship. His sentence, which
could be a maximum of life in prison,
is to be handed down by presiding
Judge Richard E. Patton sometime
after an appeal hearing, set for Jan. 29.
Under California law, life term
prisoners are eligible for a parole
hearing after seven years. Dist. Atty.
G. Dave Teja told a news conference
that if Patton chose to impose 25
consecutive life terms, Corona might
not be eligible for parole for up to 175
years.
Deserves Another Trial
Naomi Underwood, 61, who
changed her vote yesterday morning to
make the panel unanimous for
conviction, said she feels Corona
"deserves another trial."
Underwood, interviewed after the
verdict, showed newsmen three pages
in a notebook in which she said she
listed her "reasonable doubts" of
Corona's guilt.

"I have doubts yet," she said. "I
don't think they [the prosecution]
had enough evidence. I still doubt I
made the right decision."
