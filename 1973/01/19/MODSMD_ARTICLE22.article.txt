# Pollution Costs Estimated
## 
### 
Scientists at Stanford Research Institute (SRI)
have concluded that airpollution costs U.S. growers
$132 million annually in direct injury to plants and
crops.
The loss estimate results from a three-year study
in which researchers calculated the damage to
ornamental plants and six major classes of
commercial crops: field crops, seed crops, table
vegetables, trees, citrus fruits and fruits and nuts.
Commercial crops account for $85.5 million of
the annual loss, according to SRI, and ornamental
plants $46.5 million.
"The new estimate is substantially lower than
previous ones," says Alan E. Zengel, project
manager for the Coordinating Research Council,
which sponsored the SRI study on behalf of the
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the
American Petroleum Institute and the Motor
Vehicle Manufacturers Association (formerly the
Automobile Manufacturers Assoc.). "But," he adds,
"it's still high enough to cause concern and
encourage continued research into ways to reduce
airpollution in the nation's agricultural regions."
SRl's calculations are considered significant
because they are the first to result from a systematic
analysis of crop yield, emission sources and weather
conditions in 551 of the nation's 3,134 counties.
"No other estimate has been based on such
extensive data collection and analysis," says Dr.

Harris M. Benedict, a plant physiologist and chief
researcher on the SKI project.
Among the major findings of the SHI study:
—Citrus fruits are harder hit by air pollution than
any other commercial crop. Losses to citrus fruit
growers amount to $28 million a year, or about 33
percent of the nation's total crop loss. This is so
mainly because a large percentage of the country's
citrus fruits are grown in areas where weather
conditions concentrate pollutants.
—Field crops like hay, barley, wheat and corn
rank second to citrus fruits; they account for 28
percent of commercial crop losses. This is ascribed
mainly to the importance of alfalfa as a Held crop
and its sensitivity to pollutants.
—Table vegetables and seed crops are the two
least damaged in terms of dollar loss, the study
showed. The damage to table vegetables amounts to
$3.3 million annually, and the damage toseedcrops
only $228,000.
The $85.5 million in air pollution damage to
commercial crops equals one-half of one percent
of the total value of agricultural
production in the United States. Data supplied by
the U.S. Department of Agriculture indicates that
the average annual loss to agriculture through plant
diseases is about $3 billion and the loss through
insect pests is also about $3 billion — or about 12
percent each of the total value of all crops,
