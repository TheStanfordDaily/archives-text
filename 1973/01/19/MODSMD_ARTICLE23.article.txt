# 'Crucible' Revival Ushers In L.A.'s 1973 Theater Season
## 
### MARC D. KAYE 
A star-studded revival of
Arthur Miller's brilliant drama,
"The Crucible," returned to Los
Angeles Theater during winter
vacation. Appearing through
January 14 at the Ahmanson
Theater of the Los Angeles Music-
Center, the intensely thought
provoking play once again
achieved a stunning impact on our
psyches.
It probes the depths of
superstition, hypocrisy, and
repression and reaches the heights
of tragedy, nobility, and morality.
It is at one time a love story, a
political allegory, an historical
projection, a psychological
masterpiece, and much more.
"The Crucible," aside from
"The Death of a Salesman," is
perhaps Miller's finest play, both
technically and artistically. It is
generally fast moving and well
constructed, with a paucity of
characters and scenes. Miller
concentrates on the development
of characters and plot.
The characters are fully three
dimensional and the plot* very
involving. Understanding and

following the intricate sequences
of lies and fabrications can be
quite interesting, and in the end,
very rewarding. It is this brilliant
and believable progression of
fantasy, so subtle yet so deadly,
that helps make tl The Crucible"
worthwhile.
Noteworthy Acting
In this Center Theater Group
production, the acting
performances are also very
noteworthy. Charlton Heston
stars as John Proctor. At the same
time in Los Angeles, Heston
appeared in "The Ten
Commandments" and"The
Greatest Story Ever Told." Apart
from his larger-than-life heroics
and his painful facial expressions,
Heston can really act.
He gives us a performance with
a good deal of depth. His style is
one of sustained, mastered self
control. Heston was slow in
getting into his part, but he
finished strong. Heston keeps the
lid on John Proctor's passions.
The furies than appropriately
appear full-blossomed in the
crucial crucible scene of the last
act.

Eurthermore, Heston presents
us with a slightly altered version
of John Proctor, one who is not
just purely outraged and
righteously indignant. Rather,
Heston seems to portray Proctor
as somewhat of an existential
sufferer. We know there is a good
deal of anguish in this
characterization. It is expressed
very slowly, leaving Proctor with a
half-aware, shadowy nature.
I sensed Proctor's hesitancy
to rebel completely. One doesn't
know exactly what's happening
inside Proctor, but one does sense
that there's a good deal brewing.
Yet when Proctor, as played by
Heston, learns more of his fate
and can see the absurd vision of it
unravel at least within him, the
anguish surfaces a bit. This
characterization at least in my
knowledge, is unique.
It is also quite satisfying,
because of the inherent ambiguity
in Heston's portrayal. Perhaps the
shady texture of Heston's Proctor
resembles the experience of an
unconscious anxiety, a gnawing at
the soul, which finally comes to
light along with its cause, both to
the character and the audience.
This certainly isn't an
impossibility since Miller wrote
"The Crucible" partially as a
response to the McCarthy witch
hunt era, an era Heston also
experienced. The late forties and
the early fifties were certainly an
era of anxiety, especially for
suspect writers and actors.
Needless to say, the similarity
between the witch hunts of old
Salem and those of Joseph
McCarthy are remarkable,
especially the social and psychic
parallels.
A drama concerning repression
certainly makes for tense and
heavy theater, yet 'The Crucible"
does have its light moments. The
audience is the only participant in
the play who has omniscience.
Therefore, what the characters
took seriously, the audience,
having the full picture, could

laugh at as being ironic.
And than there is Beah
Richards, who plays Tituba, the
woman who delves into black
magic, starting the ruckus in the
first place. Richards steals the
show with her feigned innocence,
a stereotype the racist Puritans
came to expect.
Tituba outfoxes them
completely, assuming their
hysterical behavior. Richards has a
very enjoyable time on stage:
faking, pandering, and outright
lying. She casts a refreshing breeze
into the heaviness of it all.
The entire company is
excellent. Sandra Morgan plays
the mischievous, trouble making
Abigail Williams. She gives a sexy
youthful performance. And
veteran film star Gale Sondergaard
gives us a relentlessly strong,
unflinching Rebecca Nurse.
Donald Moffat is very
believable as Reverend Parris, who
undergoes an extreme personality
change with guilt feelings
abounding Mo 112 fat's
transformation is subtle enough to
be effective. Other notables in the
play who all did a fine job,
include Robert Cornthwaite as
Giles Corey, James Olson as
Reverend John Hale, Inga
Swenson as Elizabeth Proctor, and
Ford Rainey as Deputy Governor
Danforth
The entire production is very
professional The set is quite
mobile and very powerful in its
starkness. The direction by Joseph
Hardy is quite fine. To keep such
an array of talent together and
motivated is a magic trick in itself.
And furthermore, the mark of
the director's excellence occurs
when the actor's draw the
audience's mind into the drama.
Seldom have I seen a more
engrossed large group of people.
John Proctor's crucible became
the audience's pressure cooker.
The result is a theater hit which
dramatically closed the 1972
season and brilliantly ushered in
the 1973 season in Los Angeles.
