# Indiana Boasts Olympic Talent
## 
### MIKE CHASSON 
The Stanford swimming team faces a stiff challenge when it hosts
Indiana University, winner of five straight NCAA Championships and
76 straight dual meet victories, this Saturday at the Encina Pools.
Though the Hoosiers graduated Olympic Games hero Mark Spitz,
they recruited a group of freshmen that includes two 1972
Olympians. This, coupled with a group of returning lettermen that
includes five Olympians, makes Indiana the odds-on favorite for an
unprecedented sixth-straight NCAA title.
Hall Leads
Leading the Hoosiers is senior captain Gary Hall, a two time
Olympian who holds the world record in the 400 meter IM and the
American record in both the 200 and 400 yard IM. Hall hopes to
improve on his disappointing 1972 Olympics, where he won only a
silver medal in the 200 meter fly in his three swims.
Other returning Olympians include: John Kinsells, the 1970
Sullivan Award winner who holds the American record in both the
500 and 1650 yard freestyles. Kinsella won a gold medal at Munich as
a member of United States' 800 meter free relay.
Mike Stamm, who won two silver medals in the backstroke events
at Munich and won a gold medal on the 400 medley relay. Stamm
holds the American record in the 100 meter and 200 meter
backstroke events.
Gary Connelly, who swam on the Olympic team as an alternate on
the 800 meter free relay at Munich and recorded the fourth fastest
200 meter free in history.
John Murphy, who coach James Councilman rates as a potential
super star. Murphy won a bronze medal in the 100 meter backstroke
and a gold on the winning 400 meter freestyle relay at Munich. He
also placed fourth in the 100 meter freestyle.
Freshmen Stars
The freshmen include:
Mel Nash, who won the gold medal in the 100 meter backstroke at
the 1971 Pan American games. Nash set a national high school record
in the 100 yard backstroke last year, and was also a high school
All-American in the 50 free, 100 butterfly, and 200 IM.
Fred Tyler, who placed fifth in the 200 meter free at Munich and
won a gold medal as member of the 800 meter free relay. Tyler holds
national prep school records in the 200 and 400 free, 200 IM, and
shares the record in the 50 free.
John Halladay, the number-one-ranked high schooler in the 400
yard free last year, has also been ranked in the top 25 in the world in
the 200 and 400 meter IM events.
Bruce Dickson, who placed tenth in the AAU Indoor
Championships in the 500 yard free. He was nationally ranked in the
200 and 1650 freestyles and 400 IM last year. He made the finals at
the Olympic Trials in both the 1500 meter free and the 400 meter IM.
He currently has one of the fastest 1000 yard free times recorded this
season.
Besides all this talent Indiana has numerous individuals who were
collegiate All-Americans last year. These include Bob Alsfelder,
second in the NCAA 200 yard fly and sixth in the Olympic Trials;
Larry Barbiere, 1971 NCAA 100 yard back champion and a 1968
Olympian; Jack Horsley, an Olympic bronze medalist in 1968 in the
200 meter back; and NCAA point scorers Brock Ladewig in the
breastroke, Pat O'Conner in the fly and IM, and Duncan Scott in the
fly.
Indiana is the obvious favorite in this meet, but there will be many
excellent races between the Hoosiers and the Cardinals.
If Indiana has a weakness it is in the breastroke where Olympians
Brian Job and John Hencken should go one-two without much
problem.
The Cardinals should also win the 400 medley relay where last
week the team of Randy Whitchurch, John Hencken, Brian Job, and
Dean Anderson recorded the fastest time in the country this season.
Sprints Close
The sprints will be a toss-up with Anderson, Martin Pedley, and
Steve Carey given a good shot to beat the Indiana sprinters. The
distance freestyle races will also be a question mark as Stanford
swimmers have a chance for an upset with Terry Sutton, Steve Strong,
and Richard Cook.
Stanford will find the most trouble in the 200 backstroke, 200 IM,
200 Fly, and 200 Free which are Indiana's strongest events. The
diving will also be tough to win as the Hoosiers have Canadian
Olympian Scot Cronham and NCAA finalist Don Muir.
