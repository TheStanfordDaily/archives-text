# Golfers Face Talented Alums
## 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
Stanford's young golf team will
face a group of tested veterans
tomorrow when the Cards open
their 1973 season against the
alumni in a 10 a.m. match on the
Stanford course.
Coach Bud Finger will send his
top 12 golfers against a talented
alumni team which includes 49er
quarterback John Brodie, Chuck
Van Linge, Kent Winton, Charles
Seaver (Met pitcher Tom Seaver's
father), and Sandy Tatum, the
only Stanford golfer ever to win
the NCAA individual
championship.
Finger's lineup is still uncertain
since the Cards won't complete
their qualifying for positions on
the team until this afternoon. But
the 25 year coach is confident
that Stanford will be well
represented.
"We have a young team,"
Finger said, "but we're still
experienced since four of our
sophomores played with the
varsity as freshmen last season."
Sixth in Nation
Foremost among those
talented sophomores is Bruce
Robertson, who finished sixth in
the U.S. Amateur this summer.
Robertson's performance in that
event earned him an invitation to
the Masters this April, where he
will match his skills against most
of the world's greatest golfers.
Robertson is one of nine Card
golfers who have previously
started on the varsity.
Sophomores Conrad Nilmeier,
Dave Baskins, and Aly Trompas
all earned varsity letters last year,
as did juniors Denny Colvin and
Steve Collins, and senior Tom
Keelin.
Senior John Beers spent last
year at Stanford in England but
he had the second lowest
competitive average on the 1971
Stanford squad. Junior Dennis
Conrad was also an important
contributor to the 1971 team.
And when you add to that list
the names of some talented
challengers like George Pettinger,
Bob Harrington, Bob Chapman,
Steve Oliverio, and freshmen Bob
Steele and Bob Conway, Finger
has a huge group of golfers from
which to choose his lineup.
"Our depth will definitely be
an advantage," Finger said about a
team which may face tougher
competition in team qualifying
than in many of its matches.
Disappointing in' 72
Stanford's 1973 squad will try
to improve on a 1972 season

which was disappointing despite
an 11-1-2 record. The Cards were
picked fifth in the nation in a
preseason coaches' poll last year
but only managed a 19th place
finish in the NCAA tournament
and third place in the Pac-8
tourney. The Cards won only one
major tournament, Stanford's
own U.S. Collegiate Invitational.
This year's team figures to
improve on the 1972
performance, not only because of
its added experience but also
because of Stanford's expanded
1973 schedule. "We will be
following the pattern of most of
the leading golf schools this year
by playing more medal play
tournaments and fewer dual
matches," Finger said. The Cards
will compete in nine major
tournaments of 36 holes or more,
compared to only five last year.
The six golfers who represent
Stanford in those nine
tournaments will all be threats to
win the individual title. At least
15 of Stanford's players have shot
par or better on the difficult
Stanford course (rated as one of
the 100 toughest in the country
by Golf Digest magazine) and the
Card roster include several players
who have gained national
reputations.
Impressive Accomplishments
Robertson's accomplishments
include winning the qualifying
medal in the prestigious
Trans-Mississippi Amateur in
1971, finishing second in the
1972 San Francisco City tourney,
winning the 1970 Northern
California Junior championship,
and a host of lesser titles besides
his sixth place finish in the U.S.
Amateur.
Trompas won the 1969 U.S.

Junior championship and was also
low amateur in last year's Los
Angeles Open, Keelin finished a
shot behind the winner of the
1970 Pac-8 tourney, Nilmeier
finished second in last year's
Fresno State Classic, and Steele
was runnerup in the 1970 U.S.
Junior.
Judging from these impressive
credentials (plus dozens of lesser
honors), Stanford certainly has
the potential to field one of the
nation's finest golf teams. If the
Cards can overcome the
inconsistency that plagued them
last year, they may contend for
the Pac-8 and national titles that
eluded them in 1972.

the potential to field one of the
nation's finest golf teams. If the
Cards can overcome the
inconsistency that plagued them
last year, they may contend for
the Pac-8 and national titles that
eluded them in 1972.
Stanford's young golf team will
face a group of tested veterans
tomorrow when the Cards open
their 1973 season against the
alumni in a 10 a.m. match on the
Stanford course.
Coach Bud Finger will send his
top 12 golfers against a talented
alumni team which includes 49er
quarterback John Brodie, Chuck
Van Linge, Kent Winton, Charles
Seaver (Met pitcher Tom Seaver's
father), and Sandy Tatum, the
only Stanford golfer ever to win
the NCAA individual
championship.
Finger's lineup is still uncertain
since the Cards won't complete
their qualifying for positions on
the team until this afternoon. But
the 25 year coach is confident
that Stanford will be well
represented.
"We have a young team,"
Finger said, "but we're still
experienced since four of our
sophomores played with the
varsity as freshmen last season."
Sixth in Nation
Foremost among those
talented sophomores is Bruce
Robertson, who finished sixth in
the U.S. Amateur this summer.
Robertson's performance in that
event earned him an invitation to
the Masters this April, where he
will match his skills against most
of the world's greatest golfers.
Robertson is one of nine Card
golfers who have previously
started on the varsity.
Sophomores Conrad Nilmeier,
Dave Baskins, and Aly Trompas
all earned varsity letters last year,
as did juniors Denny Colvin and
Steve Collins, and senior Tom
Keelin.
Senior John Beers spent last
year at Stanford in England but
he had the second lowest
competitive average on the 1971
Stanford squad. Junior Dennis
Conrad was also an important
contributor to the 1971 team.
And when you add to that list
the names of some talented
challengers like George Pettinger,
Bob Harrington, Bob Chapman,
Steve Oliverio, and freshmen Bob
Steele and Bob Conway, Finger
has a huge group of golfers from
which to choose his lineup.
"Our depth will definitely be
an advantage," Finger said about a
team which may face tougher
competition in team qualifying
than in many of its matches.
Disappointing in' 72
Stanford's 1973 squad will try
to improve on a 1972 season

which was disappointing despite
an 11-1-2 record. The Cards were
picked fifth in the nation in a
preseason coaches' poll last year
but only managed a 19th place
finish in the NCAA tournament
and third place in the Pac-8
tourney. The Cards won only one
major tournament, Stanford's
own U.S. Collegiate Invitational.
This year's team figures to
improve on the 1972
performance, not only because of
its added experience but also
because of Stanford's expanded
1973 schedule. "We will be
following the pattern of most of
the leading golf schools this year
by playing more medal play
tournaments and fewer dual
matches," Finger said. The Cards
will compete in nine major
tournaments of 36 holes or more,
compared to only five last year.
The six golfers who represent
Stanford in those nine
tournaments will all be threats to
win the individual title. At least
15 of Stanford's players have shot
par or better on the difficult
Stanford course (rated as one of
the 100 toughest in the country
by Golf Digest magazine) and the
Card roster include several players
who have gained national
reputations.
Impressive Accomplishments
Robertson's accomplishments
include winning the qualifying
medal in the prestigious
Trans-Mississippi Amateur in
1971, finishing second in the
1972 San Francisco City tourney,
winning the 1970 Northern
California Junior championship,
and a host of lesser titles besides
his sixth place finish in the U.S.
Amateur.
Trompas won the 1969 U.S.

Junior championship and was also
low amateur in last year's Los
Angeles Open, Keelin finished a
shot behind the winner of the
1970 Pac-8 tourney, Nilmeier
finished second in last year's
Fresno State Classic, and Steele
was runnerup in the 1970 U.S.
Junior.
Judging from these impressive
credentials (plus dozens of lesser
honors), Stanford certainly has
the potential to field one of the
nation's finest golf teams. If the
Cards can overcome the
inconsistency that plagued them
last year, they may contend for
the Pac-8 and national titles that
