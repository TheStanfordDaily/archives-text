# Profs Discuss Presidents' Power
## 
### ROBERT BACON 
As Richard M. Nixon begins his
second term in the White House,
national attention is directed as never
before to the relative roles and powers
of the Presidency and Congress,
particularly in foreign affairs. Much
has been said about the rise of the
Presidency and the decline of
Congress.
The Daily took this topic to three
Stanford political science professors
this week, and discovered, not
surprisingly, that to these experts on
the national government, the issue
isn't that simple.
John Manley, author of a recent
article on "The Rise of Congress in
Foreign Policy-Making," theorizes that
such a rise is occurring. "When
Vietnam went sour and began to have
domestic political repercussions,
Congress became interested in its role
in foreign policy," he said.
"The problem isn't a formal lack of
Congressional power but a lack of
political will. Congress can assert itself
if it has the will and if it has sufficient

support from outside Congress," he
noted.
At the outset, Manley drew a
distinction between domestic and
foreign policy. "Most observers would
say that Congress has not in fact
slipped anywhere near as much in
domestic policy as in foreign policy,"
he claimed.
The Water's Edge
He traced the genesis of the
increase of Presidential initiative in
foreign affairs to World War II and the
early years of the Cold War, when it
was said that "Politics ends at the
water's edge," and it was felt that the
nation ought to speak with one voice
— the President's — to foreign
countries.
He applauded the trend away from
this view. "I don't think it's the
salvation of the republic for Congress
to get more involved in foreign policy.
But I know for sure after Vietnam that
leaving it up to the President is not the
way," Manley said. He saw a particular
effort by Congress in the future to
prevent Vietnam-like situations.

On a more immediate level,
however, he predicted that no end-war
legislation would be coming from the
93rd Congress "barring some drastic
change that doesn't seem to be on the
horizon," since supporters of such
legislation are still in a minority in the
House of Representatives.
"Politically it's a stalemate in which
the President still calls the shots.
Congress at best can put the heat on
the President to end the war speedily,"
Manley summed up.
Constitutional Crisis
Prof. Hubert Marshall saw the
situation as much more dangerous,
although citing many of the same facts
as Manley. "It may not be too much
to say," according to Marshall, "that
we face a Constitutional crisis."
He laid the blame partly on
historical circumstances and partly on
individuals. He traced the roots of the
shift of power to Franklin Roosevelt's
responses to the Depression and to the
rise of the Axis powers.
Marshall called the idea that
"politics stops at the water's edge,"
"one of the most subversive notions in
American history .... Ever since, the
President has set the foreign policy
direction."
Dangerous Man
At the present time, he said, we
have "a possibly very dangerous man
in the White House, and particularly
spineless Congressional leadership that
is not inclined to challenge him."
Marshall said that "there's a lot of
evidence that, temperamentally, Nixon
isn't a democrat with a small'd'." He
cited the President's impoundment of
appropriated funds, his refusal to
disclose information to Congress, and
his unprecedented centralization of
executive branch functions in the
White House, among other things.
"If Nixon isn't challenged,"
Marshall said, "we've had a
fundamental shift in the balance of
power between Congress and the
President....
"I would guess that given the
relative stability and resiliency of our
democracy, with a little luck we'll
survive the Nixon presidency and in
due time see some restoration of
Congressional power. The odds point
in that direction.
"But it remains possible that we
could move toward an attenuated
democracy in which every four years
we would have a relatively free
election for a man with more power
than Presidents have historically had,
while Congress and the Supreme Court
have relatively little power. A move in
that direction would be very
dangerous," Marshall concluded.
Richard A. Brody saw Congress
beginning to slowly reassert itself in
foreign policy, but he stressed that the

nature of most foreign relations
questions makes them better suited to
the executive branch.
"Is it reasonable to expect Congress
— all 535 members — to negotiate a
Vietnam cease-fire agreement? For the
detailed negotiation, they had to cut
down from four-power talks to
two-power talks," he pointed out.
"Congress and the public can
express themselves in broad issue
areas. Congress can set the tone of
policy. Congress has been effective on
the margin. But many foreign policy
problems arise in circumstances in
which it's difficult to consult Congress
or the public," Brody added.
Like the others, he found the most
important roots of this phenomenon
in the nature of foreign affairs during
and after World War 11. "Decisions are
more cataclysmic and less reversible
now than they were before 1940."
But he also said that "There are
fewer checks and balances in foreign
policy than in other areas. Most of the

Constitutional authority goes to the
Executive Branch." Congress' power
derives from its fiscal power, and the
requirement that the Senate consent
to treaties and appointments.
Brody applauded what he perceived
as beginning steps in the Congress to
reassert itself. "I by no means invest
all wisdom in Congress," he noted,
"but clearly in the case of Vietnam,
Congress has been moving imperfectly,
but faster than the administration.
"If there is peace at all, it will be
made by the administration. But
Congress may propel the President to
sign a 'less-than-perfect' agreement.
"But in some issue areas, the
administration is moving faster.
Congress is more Cold War oriented on
certain items. Congress approved the
SALT (Strategic Arms Limitation
Talks) agreement with the Soviet
Union, but they — particularly the
Armed Services Committees — would
have had a tough time creating it."
