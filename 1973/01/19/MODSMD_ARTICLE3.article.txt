# Profs Discuss Presidents' Power
## 
### ROBERT BACON 
As Richard M. Nixon begins his
second term in the White House,
national attention is directed as never
before to the relative roles and powers
of the Presidency and Congress,
particularly in foreign affairs. Much
has been said about the rise of the
Presidency and the decline of
Congress.
The Daily took this topic to three
Stanford political science professors
this week, and discovered, not
surprisingly, that to these experts on
the national government, the issue
isn't that simple.
John Manley, author of a recent
article on "The Rise of Congress in
Foreign Policy-Making," theorizes that
such a rise is occurring. "When
Vietnam went sour and began to have
domestic political repercussions,
Congress became interested in its role
in foreign policy," he said.
"The problem isn't a formal lack of
Congressional power but a lack of
political will. Congress can assert itself
if it has the will and if it has sufficient

support from outside Congress," he
noted.
At the outset, Manley drew a
distinction between domestic and
foreign policy. "Most observers would
say that Congress has not in fact
slipped anywhere near as much in
domestic policy as in foreign policy,"
he claimed.
The Water's Edge
He traced the genesis of the
increase of Presidential initiative in
foreign affairs to World War II and the
early years of the Cold War, when it
was said that "Politics ends at the
water's edge," and it was felt that the
nation ought to speak with one voice
— the President's — to foreign
countries.
He applauded the trend away from
this view. "I don't think it's the
salvation of the republic for Congress
to get more involved in foreign policy.
But I know for sure after Vietnam that
leaving it up to the President is not the
way," Manley said. He saw a particular
effort by Congress in the future to
prevent Vietnam-like situations.

On a more immediate level,
however, he predicted that no end-war
legislation would be coming from the
93rd Congress "barring some drastic
change that doesn't seem to be on the
horizon," since supporters of such
legislation are still in a minority in the
House of Representatives.
"Politically it's a stalemate in which
the President still calls the shots.
Congress at best can put the heat on
the President to end the war speedily,"
Manley summed up.
Constitutional Crisis
Prof. Hubert Marshall saw the
situation as much more dangerous,
although citing many of the same facts
as Manley. "It may not be too much
to say," according to Marshall, "that
we face a Constitutional crisis."
He laid the blame partly on
historical circumstances and partly on
individuals. He traced the roots of the
shift of power to Franklin Roosevelt's
responses to the Depression and to the
rise of the Axis powers.
Marshall called the idea that
"politics stops at the water's edge,"
"one of the most subversive notions in
American history .... Ever since, the
President has set the foreign policy
direction."
Dangerous Man
At the present time, he said, we
have "a possibly very dangerous man
in the White House, and particularly
spineless Congressional leadership that
is not inclined to challenge him."
Marshall said that "there's a lot of
evidence that, temperamentally, Nixon
isn't a democrat with a small'd'." He
cited the President's impoundment of
appropriated funds, his refusal to
disclose information to Congress, and
his unprecedented centralization of
executive branch functions in the
White House, among other things.
