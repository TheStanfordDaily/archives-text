# Stanford Hosts Utah
## 
### STAN WILSON DAVE ROBINSON 
After enduring a disastrous
weekend at the hands of USC and
UCLA, the Stanford Cardinals will
try to bring their record back to
.500 when they host Utah in an 8
p.m. game Saturday night at
Maples Pavilion.
Both the Bruins and the
Trojans recorded convincing wins
over the Cards last weekend, and
Stanford coach Howie Dallmar
decided his charges needed a
three-day break. "Everyone was
just a little tired and disappointed
after the losses," Dallmar said, "so
I thought a couple days of rest
would do us some good." The
team resumed practice on
Wednesday.
Dallmar was not sure who
would start for the Cards
tomorrow night, but he indicated
that Tim Patterson, Scott Trobbe,
and Mark Gilberg will see
considerably more action against
Utah then they did last week.
Patterson was outstanding
against UCLA & USC, scoring 22
points and grabbing nine rebounds
in the two games while Trobbe
sparked a late first half rally
against the Bruins with some
clutch shooting and aggressive
board play.
Height Advantage
No matter who starts, the
Cards will have a definite height
advantage over the Redskins.
Utah's starters, two of whom are
freshmen, average 6-4'/2 while any

combination of Stanford starters
averages over 6-6.
Utah is 4-11 on the season, but
according to Dallmar, "they've
played some good games —
nobody blows them out."
Freshman guard "Ticky"
Burden leads the Redskins in
scoring with an average of 14.4
points per game. Guard Eddie
Trail, forward Scott Jones, and
the other freshman starter, 6-8
center Mike Soujoumer, are all
averaging in double figures for
Utah.
If the 1969 meeting between
the two teams is any indication,
tomorrow night's game could be a
wild one. When Stanford and
Utah met in the season opener
that year, the Redskins won
96-94. The visiting Cards scored
15 more field goals than Utah, but
went to the free throw line only
nineteen times, while the
Redskins shot 54 free throws and
converted 44.
Terry's Debut
Utah's Mike Newlin, now with
the NBA's Houston Rockets, hit
23 of 25 free throws in a 33 point
effort. In the same game a young
sophomore named Claude Terry
scored an impressive 32 points in
his first game for the Indians.

While the Cards scored 94
points in the losing effort against
Utah three years ago, they are
averaging only 70.2 points per
game this season. Stanford is 6-7
on the year, and 1-3 in league
play.
The Cards are last in the Pac-8
in field goal shooting with a
dismal 39 percent and third in
free throw shooting hitting at a
.729 clip. UCLA leads the
conference in field goal
percentage (.48) and rebounding.
The Cards' Mike Mann is tied
for the league lead in free throws
percentage, with a perfect 8 for 8,
while soph center Rich Kelley
trails only UCLA's Bill Walton in
rebounding. Guard Mel Arterberry
ranks third in the conference in
shooting, hitting 12-20 for 60
percent.

Trail, forward Scott Jones, and
the other freshman starter, 6-8
center Mike Soujoumer, are all
averaging in double figures for
Utah.
If the 1969 meeting between
the two teams is any indication,
tomorrow night's game could be a
wild one. When Stanford and
Utah met in the season opener
that year, the Redskins won
96-94. The visiting Cards scored
15 more field goals than Utah, but
went to the free throw line only
nineteen times, while the
Redskins shot 54 free throws and
converted 44.
Terry's Debut
Utah's Mike Newlin, now with
the NBA's Houston Rockets, hit
23 of 25 free throws in a 33 point
effort. In the same game a young
sophomore named Claude Terry
scored an impressive 32 points in
his first game for the Indians.

While the Cards scored 94
points in the losing effort against
Utah three years ago, they are
averaging only 70.2 points per
game this season. Stanford is 6-7
on the year, and 1-3 in league
play.
The Cards are last in the Pac-8
in field goal shooting with a
dismal 39 percent and third in
free throw shooting hitting at a
.729 clip. UCLA leads the
conference in field goal
percentage (.48) and rebounding.
The Cards' Mike Mann is tied
for the league lead in free throws
percentage, with a perfect 8 for 8,
while soph center Rich Kelley
trails only UCLA's Bill Walton in
rebounding. Guard Mel Arterberry
ranks third in the conference in
shooting, hitting 12-20 for 60
percent.

After enduring a disastrous
weekend at the hands of USC and
UCLA, the Stanford Cardinals will
try to bring their record back to
.500 when they host Utah in an 8
p.m. game Saturday night at
Maples Pavilion.
Both the Bruins and the
Trojans recorded convincing wins
over the Cards last weekend, and
Stanford coach Howie Dallmar
decided his charges needed a
three-day break. "Everyone was
just a little tired and disappointed
after the losses," Dallmar said, "so
I thought a couple days of rest
would do us some good." The
team resumed practice on
Wednesday.
Dallmar was not sure who
would start for the Cards
tomorrow night, but he indicated
that Tim Patterson, Scott Trobbe,
and Mark Gilberg will see
considerably more action against
Utah then they did last week.
Patterson was outstanding
against UCLA & USC, scoring 22
points and grabbing nine rebounds
in the two games while Trobbe
sparked a late first half rally
against the Bruins with some
clutch shooting and aggressive
board play.
Height Advantage
No matter who starts, the
Cards will have a definite height
advantage over the Redskins.
Utah's starters, two of whom are
freshmen, average 6-4'/2 while any

combination of Stanford starters
averages over 6-6.
Utah is 4-11 on the season, but
according to Dallmar, "they've
played some good games —
nobody blows them out."
Freshman guard "Ticky"
Burden leads the Redskins in
scoring with an average of 14.4
points per game. Guard Eddie
Trail, forward Scott Jones, and
