Nixon Inauguration Proceedings Begin
WASHINGTON — Three days of festivity, ceremony and
protest marking President Nixon's second inauguration
were to begin last night with a gala reception for Vice
President and Mrs. Spiro T. Agnew.
Scene of the vice president's reception was a
Smithsonian Museum hall, beneath the huge, tattered Old
Glory that inspired "The Star Spangled Banner."
Scheduled to follow the reception was a "Salute to the
States" — the first of a series of shows, concerts and balls
both to celebrate the 55th inauguration of a president
and to raise money to pay the estimated $4-million cost
of this one.
The theme throughout the three days of festivities and
a worship service Sunday is "Spirit of '76," recalling the
formative years of the nation and looking forward to the
celebration of its 200 th anniversary in 1976.
Reagan Unveils Budget
SACRAMENTO — Gov. Ronald Reagan unveiled
yesterday a $9.3 billion dollar budget bulging with a
potential bonanza for taxpayers and a fat pay raise for
state workers.
The spending plan for the Fiscal year starting July 1 ran
into immediate, but unusual, criticism from key
Democrats.
Where they used to accuse Reagan, the "squeeze, cut
and trim" economizer, of being too stingy with the state's
money, they criticized him yesterday for proposing to
spend too much.
Chairman Randolph Collier of the Senate Finance
Committee said he thought the budget could be cut by as
much as $900 million. Collier (D-Yreka), did not say
where he would trim.
As presented by Reagan, the new budget contains a
record $226 million for state employee pay raises and
about $1 billion in new money for schools and property
tax relief.
Even after that, the state would wind up the coming

|
fiscal year with a $1.1 billion budget surplus, largely
because the economic upswing has brought in more tax
money than expected — a happy circumstance expected
to continue.
Seven Killed In Muslim Home
WASHINGTON — Seven persons, including five children,
were killed yesterday in what police described as
"definitely an execution" in a fashionable home used as
headquarters by a Muslim religious sect.
The home was formerly owned by Milwaukee Bucks
basketball star Kareem Abdul-Jabbar who recently
donated it to the Hanafi Muslim sect of which he is a
member.
Police said they are looking for four black men seen
running from the back of the house about 4:30 p.m. The
home is located in an area of expensive homes where
many of Washington's wealthiest black families live.
The identity of the victims was not immediately
known, but police said they ranged in age from infancy to
about 30. Earlier reports said three children were found
drowned in a bathtub, but police declined to say how any
of the victims died.
Two other occupants of the house, both women about
20 years old, were taken to Howard University Medical
Center with bullet wounds in the head. One, Bibi Khaalis,
was reported in critical condition, and the other, Almina
Khaalis, was reported serious but not critical.
All the victims were black.
Timothy Leary Arrested
WASHINGTON — Dr. Timothy Leary, the ex-Harvard
professor and drug cultist who escaped from prison three
years ago, was arrested in Los Angeles yesterday after a
flight that took him half way around the world, the U.S.
Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs reported.
The bureau said Leary was arrested aboard a Pan
American 747 jet when it arrived in Los Angeles after a
flight from London. Narcotics agents had accompanied
Leary at least since he was refused admission to
Afghanistan and flew on to London, a spokesman said.
Leary was ordered held in Los Angeles County Jail on
$5 million bond.
Since his escape from a state prison near San Luis
Obispo, Calif., in September 1970, Leary had been living
in several foreign countries. Attempts by California
authorities to have him extradited were unsuccessful.
He was expelled from Afghanistan on Wednesday
where he had gone after living in Switzerland and Algeria.

Timothy Leary Arrested
WASHINGTON — Dr. Timothy Leary, the ex-Harvard
professor and drug cultist who escaped from prison three
years ago, was arrested in Los Angeles yesterday after a
flight that took him half way around the world, the U.S.
Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs reported.
The bureau said Leary was arrested aboard a Pan
American 747 jet when it arrived in Los Angeles after a
flight from London. Narcotics agents had accompanied
Leary at least since he was refused admission to
Afghanistan and flew on to London, a spokesman said.
Leary was ordered held in Los Angeles County Jail on
$5 million bond.
Since his escape from a state prison near San Luis
Obispo, Calif., in September 1970, Leary had been living
in several foreign countries. Attempts by California
authorities to have him extradited were unsuccessful.
He was expelled from Afghanistan on Wednesday
where he had gone after living in Switzerland and Algeria.

Nixon Inauguration Proceedings Begin
WASHINGTON — Three days of festivity, ceremony and
protest marking President Nixon's second inauguration
were to begin last night with a gala reception for Vice
President and Mrs. Spiro T. Agnew.
Scene of the vice president's reception was a
Smithsonian Museum hall, beneath the huge, tattered Old
Glory that inspired "The Star Spangled Banner."
Scheduled to follow the reception was a "Salute to the
States" — the first of a series of shows, concerts and balls
both to celebrate the 55th inauguration of a president
and to raise money to pay the estimated $4-million cost
of this one.
The theme throughout the three days of festivities and
a worship service Sunday is "Spirit of '76," recalling the
formative years of the nation and looking forward to the
celebration of its 200 th anniversary in 1976.
Reagan Unveils Budget
SACRAMENTO — Gov. Ronald Reagan unveiled
yesterday a $9.3 billion dollar budget bulging with a
potential bonanza for taxpayers and a fat pay raise for
state workers.
The spending plan for the Fiscal year starting July 1 ran
into immediate, but unusual, criticism from key
Democrats.
Where they used to accuse Reagan, the "squeeze, cut
and trim" economizer, of being too stingy with the state's
money, they criticized him yesterday for proposing to
spend too much.
Chairman Randolph Collier of the Senate Finance
Committee said he thought the budget could be cut by as
much as $900 million. Collier (D-Yreka), did not say
where he would trim.
As presented by Reagan, the new budget contains a
record $226 million for state employee pay raises and
about $1 billion in new money for schools and property
tax relief.
Even after that, the state would wind up the coming

|
fiscal year with a $1.1 billion budget surplus, largely
because the economic upswing has brought in more tax
money than expected — a happy circumstance expected
to continue.
Seven Killed In Muslim Home
WASHINGTON — Seven persons, including five children,
were killed yesterday in what police described as
"definitely an execution" in a fashionable home used as
headquarters by a Muslim religious sect.
The home was formerly owned by Milwaukee Bucks
basketball star Kareem Abdul-Jabbar who recently
donated it to the Hanafi Muslim sect of which he is a
member.
Police said they are looking for four black men seen
running from the back of the house about 4:30 p.m. The
home is located in an area of expensive homes where
many of Washington's wealthiest black families live.
The identity of the victims was not immediately
known, but police said they ranged in age from infancy to
about 30. Earlier reports said three children were found
drowned in a bathtub, but police declined to say how any
of the victims died.
Two other occupants of the house, both women about
20 years old, were taken to Howard University Medical
Center with bullet wounds in the head. One, Bibi Khaalis,
was reported in critical condition, and the other, Almina
