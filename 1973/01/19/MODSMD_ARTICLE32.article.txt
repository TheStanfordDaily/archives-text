# Pair Of Nicaraguan Students Relate Earthquake Memories

"/ was at a party outside of town, when suddenly the room trembled;
everybody ran for the patio."
"We lived downtown in an old adobe house. At the time of the quake my
family and I were upstairs sleeping, suddenly the floor caved in."

Carlos Pellas, a junior in engineering
and Carlos Sevilla, a graduate student
at the Food Research Institute, are
two of six Nicaraguan students at
Stanford. Both were in the capital city
of Managua on December 23, 1972
during the devastating earthquake
which claimed the lives of thousands
and kept the city in flames for six
days.
"Several hundred people began
rushing out of their homes, fearful
that the dwellings would crumble at
any moment," recalled Sevilla. His
home in the center of the city was
destroyed. "Cars were crashing into
each other as people tried to leave the
city," said Sevilla.
Pellas said that once the after

shocks had subsided the injured were
taken to the main hospital. "But the
hospital had been completely
destroyed."
Fire Spread Quickly
Fire became the immediate
problem in the quake's aftermath. The
flames started in the central
marketplace. "All the shops were
wooden so the fire spread rapidly,"
said Sevilla.
The water pipelines broke and only
one fire truck was operable. More were
later rushed to Managua from a
near-by town. They arrived too late to
save the city. "What could one fire
engine do against a burning city
block?" Sevilla asked.

Pellas said, "The government
wanted survivors to leave Managua."
Relief supplies arriving from the U.S.
and other countries were held at the
airport and not distributed to victims
in order to discourage people from
remaining. Many people, whose homes
had not been destroyed, stayed to
fight off looters. Three days later,
General Anastasio Somoza,
Nicaragua's ruler, decided to distribute
food within the city.
Many Fled City
But many people did leave, going to
relatives' homes in neighboring cities.
Pellas and his brothers spent five days
in San Marcos distributing food within
the city. One home he visited housed
54 persons in six rooms.
Pellas has organized a Nicaraguan
Relief Drive for next week and plans
to direct the funds through an
international organization to those
who are still without food or housing.

Many Fled City
But many people did leave, going to
relatives' homes in neighboring cities.
Pellas and his brothers spent five days
in San Marcos distributing food within
the city. One home he visited housed
54 persons in six rooms.
Pellas has organized a Nicaraguan
Relief Drive for next week and plans
to direct the funds through an
international organization to those
who are still without food or housing.
