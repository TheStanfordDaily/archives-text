# Tentative Viet Peace Accord Reached
## 
### 
KEY BISCAYNE (AP) - The United
States and North Vietnam announced
yesterday their representatives will
resume secret Paris meetings next
Tuesday "for the purpose of
completing the text of an agreement"
to end the long and bitter Vietnam
war.
The wording of a terse joint
announcement by the Florida White
House and Hanoi indicated that
tentative agreement had been reached
on such major points as a cease-fire,
the return of prisoners and machinery
to reshape Saigon's government.
But the statement appeared to rule
out a unilateral cease-fire by the
United States and South Vietnam.
Such a cease-fire had been rumored to
take place today.

U.S. officials refused to predict
when the text would be completed.
But they did nothing to erase the
impression that only lesser details,
such as the makeup of a peacekeeping
force, stand in the way of signing of a
final accord.
Approved By Both
Emphasizing that he was reading
language approved by both the United
States and North Vietnam, presidential
press secretary Ronald L. Ziegler said:
"Dr. Henry Kissinger will resume
private meetings with special adviser
Le Due Tho and Minister Xuan Thuy
on Jan. 23, 1973 for the purpose of
completing the text of an agreement."
The North Vietnamese delegation
in Paris said the top negotiators for
each side would resume their talks "to
complete the agreement on ending the
war and re-establishing peace in
Vietnam."
Semantics
Hanoi's announcement differed
from the U.S. statement in referring to
"the agreement" rather than "an
agreement." The North Vietnamese
have demanded that the United States
sign without major revisions the
agreement drafted in October.
Major parts of the October draft

were unacceptable to the Saigon
government, and Ziegler's reference to
"an agreement" appeared to indicate a
break with the October text could be
expected.
Asked later about the difference in
language, Ziegler said: "The intention
of both is the same. There is no
substantive difference."
Comments by President Nixon's
spokesman appeared to rule out a
cease-fire until negotiations are
complete. Earlier reports from Saigon
forecast a unilateral cease-fire by the
United States and South Vietnam
Friday, the eve of Nixon's
inauguration.

As the joint announcement sent
peace hopes soaring even higher, Gen.
Alexander M. Haig Jr., Kissinger's
chief aide, hurried through a series of
meetings with Southeast Asian leaders
at Nixon's behest, apparently to brief
them on details of the tentative
accord.
South Vietnamese President
Nguyen Van Thieu was reported to
still have some reservations about the
protocols, or technical instruments to
implement the peace agreement. But a
statement by his foreign minister, Tran
Van Lam, that "peace is near" seemed
to indicate the remaining issues could
be resolved quickly.

completing the text of an agreement."
The North Vietnamese delegation
in Paris said the top negotiators for
each side would resume their talks "to
complete the agreement on ending the
war and re-establishing peace in
Vietnam."
Semantics
Hanoi's announcement differed
from the U.S. statement in referring to
"the agreement" rather than "an
agreement." The North Vietnamese
have demanded that the United States
sign without major revisions the
agreement drafted in October.
Major parts of the October draft

were unacceptable to the Saigon
government, and Ziegler's reference to
"an agreement" appeared to indicate a
break with the October text could be
expected.
Asked later about the difference in
language, Ziegler said: "The intention
of both is the same. There is no
substantive difference."
Comments by President Nixon's
spokesman appeared to rule out a
cease-fire until negotiations are
complete. Earlier reports from Saigon
forecast a unilateral cease-fire by the
United States and South Vietnam
Friday, the eve of Nixon's
inauguration.

As the joint announcement sent
peace hopes soaring even higher, Gen.
Alexander M. Haig Jr., Kissinger's
chief aide, hurried through a series of
meetings with Southeast Asian leaders
at Nixon's behest, apparently to brief
them on details of the tentative
accord.
South Vietnamese President
Nguyen Van Thieu was reported to
still have some reservations about the
protocols, or technical instruments to
implement the peace agreement. But a
statement by his foreign minister, Tran
Van Lam, that "peace is near" seemed
to indicate the remaining issues could
be resolved quickly.
KEY BISCAYNE (AP) - The United
States and North Vietnam announced
yesterday their representatives will
resume secret Paris meetings next
Tuesday "for the purpose of
completing the text of an agreement"
to end the long and bitter Vietnam
war.
The wording of a terse joint
announcement by the Florida White
House and Hanoi indicated that
tentative agreement had been reached
on such major points as a cease-fire,
the return of prisoners and machinery
to reshape Saigon's government.
But the statement appeared to rule
out a unilateral cease-fire by the
United States and South Vietnam.
Such a cease-fire had been rumored to
take place today.

U.S. officials refused to predict
when the text would be completed.
But they did nothing to erase the
impression that only lesser details,
such as the makeup of a peacekeeping
force, stand in the way of signing of a
final accord.
Approved By Both
Emphasizing that he was reading
language approved by both the United
States and North Vietnam, presidential
press secretary Ronald L. Ziegler said:
"Dr. Henry Kissinger will resume
private meetings with special adviser
Le Due Tho and Minister Xuan Thuy
on Jan. 23, 1973 for the purpose of
completing the text of an agreement."
