### 
A 51-year-old San Jose man received the heart of a 20-year-old auto
accident victim Wednesday in the 52nd heart transplant operation
performed at Stanford Hospital. Eighteen of the recipients are still living.
The donor was Richard M. Moore, son of Mountain View School
District Trustee Gail Urban Moore. He died of injuries suffered in an
accident early Wednesday morning on Junipero Serra Blvd. about 200
yards north of the May field-Serra intersection.
The other occupant of the car, Daniel Malone, 20, of Mountain View
was killed instantly in the crash. Moore died late Wednesday afternoon.
