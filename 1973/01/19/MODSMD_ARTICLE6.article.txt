# Pentagon Papers Witness Claims Report Aided North Vietnamese
## 
### ED KOHN 
LOS ANGELES — A prosecution witness at the Pentagon
Papers trial testified yesterday that the release of part of a
top secret Defense Department report could have helped
the North Vietnamese plan their April, 1972 offensive. He
also said the release of the report provided an accurate
measure of American intelligence to the North
Vietnamese.
Lieutenant General William DePuy, a top Army
planning officer in Vietnam prior to the large scale ground
forces in Indochina in 1965, said that the intelligence
contained in the report — written just after the end of the
first phase of North Vietnam's Tet offensive — "proved
useful in planning" the highly successful April, 1972
attack.
"This might be the best piece of intelligence they [the
North Vietnamese) ever had," DePuy testified.
The intelligence was contained in an eight-page
segment of the "Wheeler Report," described as an
assessment of the military situation in Vietnam during the
last week of February, 1968. The Wheeler Reporf was
prepared by then-Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
Earle G. Wheeler and a team of eight aides, including
DePuy.
Dr. Daniel Ellsberg and Anthony J. Russo are charged
with stealing, duplicating, and distributing portions of
that report and two other top secret Defense Department
studies. Segments of the three reports appeared in the
New York Times and many other newspapers beginning
on June 13, 1971.
Publication Damaging
DePuy said publication of the segment of the Wheeler

Report was equivalent to "telling the North Vietnamese
high command what action they could take that would be
the most damaging to the United States" military and the
South Vietnamese government.
The eight-page segment, part of the Report's summary,
comprises a tiny segment of the total report, which is
approximately two inches thick.
DePuy testified that release of the segment "gives the
North Vietnamese high command a picture of how good
and how bad American intelligence is and was." And he
said that despite a changed military situation in Southeast
Asia, publication of the documents in 1971 or even today
could harm the national interest of the United States.
Helped Plan Policy
Now based in Washington, DePuy admitted that he
helped plan a policy that later became known as "search
and destroy," and that as infantry officer he commanded
men who utilized that tactic. Presiding Judge Matt Byrne
Jr. rejected repeated prosecution objections to questions
about DePuy's role in the war.
Earlier in the day, a Defense Department attorney
testified that he had provided administrative support for a
four to six man task force which spent seven months
preparing an analysis of the alleged damage caused by
publication of the Pentagon Papers for the State and
Justice Departments.
Frank Bartimo, general counsel to the office of
manpower and reserve affairs, testified that he received
the Rand Corporation's copy of the Pentagon Papers on
June 20, 1971, one week after portions of the study were
\ *•" — I —©-/
first published and five days after the government first
went to court to enjoin their publication.
Bartimo was handed a study that prosecutor David
Nissen had identified as that produced by the task force,
but Bartimo told Byrne that the papers he was handed did
not comprise the study in question. The defense is
attempting, so far unsuccessfully, to obtain a copy of the
report and the names of those who prepared it.
Byrne ordered Bartimo to produce the report for him
this morning, or by Monday morning at the latest.
The trial will resume this morning with defense
attorney Leonard Weinglass cross-examining DePuy. Also
expected to testify is Brigadier General Paul Gorman, one
of the authors of the Pentagon Papers.
