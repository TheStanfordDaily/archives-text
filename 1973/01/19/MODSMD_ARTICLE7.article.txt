We have found most University administrators very accessible and
willing to answer our questions. This is why we are upset and
disillusioned about the treatment we have received from Dean of
Admissions Fred Hargadon.
The subject of college admissions has received considerable
emphasis in educational circles in recent months. The National
Student Association and some public interest research groups have
begun to investigate the Educational Testing Service and a number of
schools have been deemphasizing or eliminating scholastic aptitude
tests in their consideration of candidates.
A number of schools, including Stanford, have been accused of
attempting to weed out potential radicals among candidates for
admission. And Stanford's admissions office came under fire last
quarter from the Black Students Union for "footdragging" in
minority admissions.
Admissions policies have definitely been in the news and in late
September the Daily set out to do an in-depth story about Stanford's
admissions office which would include the aforementioned subjects.
Hargadon initially claimed that a heavy workload prevented him
from talking immediately to our reporter. We felt we could give him a
little time, but we became skeptical of his motives when we
discovered that he had imposed a gag rule on members of his staff.
After waiting for a few days, our reporter submitted a number of
written questions at Hargadon's request. More than three months have
passed and we're still awaiting his reply.
Frankly, we're very upset. We find it distressing when a University
administrator refuses to answer questions either in person or in
writing for such a long period of time. And we find it even more
disturbing that he would impose a gag rule on his staff members. We
can't imagine what he's trying to hide, but we're going to do
everything within our power to find out what it is.
Hargadon's actions are all the more upsetting because of the
general cooperation of administrators on this campus. Most
administrators have been willing to answer our inquiries quickly and
completely. Only rarely have they tried to hide behind the
bureaucracy.
President Richard Lyman has been especially commendable in this
area. Although he has certainly disagreed with our editorial stands on
many occasions, he has always been willing to talk with us frankly and
promptly. His press conferences on KZSU are very unique for a
college president and he deserves praise for consenting to them.
As the major link between students and administrators on this
campus, we feel that such cooperation is very important and we praise
the administration for their generally fine record in this regard.
Although administrators are under heavy time pressures, we would
urge them to try to spend more time informally with students
whenever possible.
Administrators should try to drop in more often for lunch and
dinner at dorms. They should also try to speak with individual
students who want to see them as much as time allows. They have a
responsibility to serve students and we would like to see more efforts
at direct contact on their part. Such increased contact would be in
keeping with the fine cooperation most administrators have given us.
We urge Hargadon to follow the lead of his associates and to stop
hiding.

Frankly, we're very upset. We find it distressing when a University
administrator refuses to answer questions either in person or in
writing for such a long period of time. And we find it even more
disturbing that he would impose a gag rule on his staff members. We
can't imagine what he's trying to hide, but we're going to do
everything within our power to find out what it is.
Hargadon's actions are all the more upsetting because of the
general cooperation of administrators on this campus. Most
administrators have been willing to answer our inquiries quickly and
completely. Only rarely have they tried to hide behind the
bureaucracy.
President Richard Lyman has been especially commendable in this
area. Although he has certainly disagreed with our editorial stands on
many occasions, he has always been willing to talk with us frankly and
promptly. His press conferences on KZSU are very unique for a
college president and he deserves praise for consenting to them.
As the major link between students and administrators on this
campus, we feel that such cooperation is very important and we praise
the administration for their generally fine record in this regard.
Although administrators are under heavy time pressures, we would
urge them to try to spend more time informally with students
whenever possible.
Administrators should try to drop in more often for lunch and
dinner at dorms. They should also try to speak with individual
students who want to see them as much as time allows. They have a
responsibility to serve students and we would like to see more efforts
at direct contact on their part. Such increased contact would be in
keeping with the fine cooperation most administrators have given us.
We urge Hargadon to follow the lead of his associates and to stop
hiding.
We have found most University administrators very accessible and
willing to answer our questions. This is why we are upset and
disillusioned about the treatment we have received from Dean of
Admissions Fred Hargadon.
The subject of college admissions has received considerable
emphasis in educational circles in recent months. The National
Student Association and some public interest research groups have
begun to investigate the Educational Testing Service and a number of
schools have been deemphasizing or eliminating scholastic aptitude
tests in their consideration of candidates.
A number of schools, including Stanford, have been accused of
attempting to weed out potential radicals among candidates for
admission. And Stanford's admissions office came under fire last
quarter from the Black Students Union for "footdragging" in
minority admissions.
Admissions policies have definitely been in the news and in late
September the Daily set out to do an in-depth story about Stanford's
admissions office which would include the aforementioned subjects.
Hargadon initially claimed that a heavy workload prevented him
from talking immediately to our reporter. We felt we could give him a
little time, but we became skeptical of his motives when we
discovered that he had imposed a gag rule on members of his staff.
After waiting for a few days, our reporter submitted a number of
written questions at Hargadon's request. More than three months have
passed and we're still awaiting his reply.
