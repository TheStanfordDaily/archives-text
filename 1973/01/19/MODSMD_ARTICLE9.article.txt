## Housing Freeze Applauded

Stanford libertarian society

The Stanford Daily editorial of Jan. 12 entitled
"Frenchman's Freeze" presented an inaccurate
picture of the housing situation in America. The
Daily's proposed solution (continued subsidies)
would only aggravate whatever problems now exist.
In a speech delivered in late 1972, M. Stanton
Evans, the editor of the Indianapolis News, gave a
brief and up-to-date account of the housing
situation:
"Consider the matter of housing, which is
especially interesting when viewed against the
backdrop of alarm about the suburban flow of
population. By and large, this outward flow is the
best single answer to the housing problemâ€”since
construction of high and middle income housing in
the suburbs is an excellent method of providing
improvement of housing for those in lower income
brackets.
"As high and middle income families purchase
houses in the outer suburban ring, they vacate
livable housing for others, who in turn are
succeeded by people in the next interior ring, and so
on.
Housing Demolition
"It is by this procedure that the private housing
industry achieves a continual upgrading of housing
for everyone in our society, permitting gradual
demolition of substandard housing at the end of the
line. (Standard housing in the United States was
upgraded from 51 percent in the census of 1940 to
over 90 percent in the census of 1970.)"
Evans goes on to pinpoint the cause of housing
trouble: "Housing crises exist in America for a
variety of interrelated and largely governmental
causes: urban renewal programs which bulldoze
livable dwellings in the central cities before the
market process has opened up superior substitutes,
zoning regulations which prevent improvements,
public housing units that tum into instant slums,
rent controls, etc.
"Professor Richard Cloward of Columbia
University has estimated that the result of
government involvement in the field of housing
since the 1930s has been a net loss of 250,000
low-income housing units. Professor Yale Brozen
informs us that property sufficient to supply
another 250,000 units has been left standing idle in
New York City as a result of various government
restrictions there.
Stalled Construction
"Professor George Sternlieb of Rutgers notes
that, thanks to these restrictions, private housing
construction in Manhattan has ground to a virtual
halt. . . ."
Mr. Evans' indictment is a long one, but he only

cites some of the evidence and scholarly literature in
the field. In the brand-new issue of Society
magazine, Frances Fox Piven, associate professor at
the Columbia University School of Social Work,
notes that "government activities in the housing
field have destroyed the shelter of the poor and
preempted their neighborhoods, more than they
have refurbished them."
Economist James O'Connor has analyzed urban
reconstruction and federal housing programs and
has found that the subsidies are aimed in the end at
improving business conditions for "builders, banks,
utilities, retailers, brokers, and land speculators."
Urban Renewal Coalition
O'Connor recommends Martin Anderson's
Federal Bulldozer for its treatment of "the coalition
of banks, newspapers, department stores, downtown
real estate owners, academic intellectuals, city
planners, and city politicians who have made urban
renewal what it is."
We could go on and on, citing Bernard Siegan's
new book Land Use Without Zoning which
demonstrates the deleterious effects of zoning
restrictions or the recent RAND Corporation study
on the deleterious effect of rent control in New
York City. The point is this: Governmental
intervention in the housing field, inspired by special
interests, has had overwhelmingly harmful effects.
Tax Money Sought
It is understandable that Stanford officials would
go hat in hand protesting about the housing subsidy
freeze to Washington. Stanford has a real and direct
interest in continued subsidies to the
social-industrial complex. The Frenchman's Terrace
project is an important component of Stanford's
effort to capture "social responsibility" tax money
now, just as Frederick Terman captured
military-industrial complex money for Stanford
after World War 11. Frenchman's Terrace fits right in
with the Business School's urban management
program and Stanford's interdisciplinary project of
revamping San Francisco's Mission District.
Instead of calling for "more reasonable priorities
for this country" (which are code words among
corporate liberals for continued and increased
subsidies to the social-industrial complex), the Daily
should have applauded the freeze of the housing
subsidy. The Daily should have called for making
the freeze Antarctically permanent, and for a return
of the unspent dollars to the American taxpayers in
the way that Governor Ronald Reagan has called for
a tax dividend to California taxpayers.
