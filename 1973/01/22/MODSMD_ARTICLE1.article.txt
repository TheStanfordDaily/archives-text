# Vietnam Specialist Advocates 'Imperialist' Policies
## 
### DOYLE McMANUS 
A Communist victory in Vietnam would
surely result in an extensive purge —
"bloodbath" would be a better word — in the
democratic South. The war crimes of the
National Liberation Front and North
Vietnamese forces make that clear. And the
struggle for control of Vietnam will continue
long after the signing of any cease-fire.
Or so says Robert F. Turner, 28, Vietnamese
affairs specialist and Public Affairs Fellow at
the Hoover Institution. Turner, a self-confessed
economic libertarian and "right-wing
crackpot," backs his claims with eight years of
research, much of it firsthand. His conclusions
are undeniably disturbing.
"I believe in what I call a realistic foreign
policy, or what many of the people on this
campus" — he smiles — "might call an
imperialist foreign policy."
Turner, who holds an A.B. in Government
from Indiana University, is at Hoover finishing
a book on Vietnamese communism. Until 1971
he was attached (as a Captain in the Army) to
the U.S. Embassy in Saigon, monitoring North

Vietnamese and NLF broadcasts, newspapers,
and captured documents, and working on
"strategic psychological warfare."
Debates 'Bloodbath'
Most recently, Turner has been engaged in a
public debate with Cornell research associate D.
Gareth Porter over whether or not there was a
"bloodbath" in North Vietnam after Ho Chi
Minh's victory in 1954. Porter contends that no
bloodbath took place; Turner disagrees. Indeed,
in an article in the conservative weekly Human
Events, Turner called Porter's paper "an
incredibly sloppy piece of propaganda."
According to Turner, the Communist
takeover of North Vietnam resulted in the
deaths of "probably 300,000" enemies of the
Ho regime, and he says another bloody purge is
inevitable should the Communists gain control
of South Vietnam.
"We are not in Vietnam to avoid a
bloodbath," he says. "But to those who say we
should end the killing by pulling out, I can only
warn that a Communist victory would result in
a considerable amount of bloodletting.
"I think there's a real double standard in this

country," he says. "When Bach Mai Hospital
was bombed, one patient was injured; but the
shelling of An Loc Hospital (by the North
Vietnamese) injured far more. In An Loc
province, they rammed a Soviet tank right
through a church full of people.
"These things are being exploited and used
for propaganda. When you're talking about war
crimes, it seems to me this is where you ought
to start talking, not the bombing. It's true that
we've dropped more bombs in Vietnam than we
did in World War 11, but we're dropping them
on jungle areas."
Anti-War Movement
He is detached when he discusses the
American peace movement; "they've reached
very logical conclusions from the information
they have to work with," he says. But he sees
the antiwar movement as one of the
Communists' prime weapons: "they are," he
wrote in a recent monograph, "placing far more
reliance on a victory through the American
'peace' movement than on military victory in
Indochina."
"Basically, the Communists are very clear on

the point that diplomatic struggle is one part of
their overall struggle, and that their objective is
still total victory. Their agreement to a
cease-fire is just a backward step to weaken and
divide their enemy."
Yet he believes that South Vietnam "has a
reasonable chance of survival": "The longer we
can delay, the harder it will be for the North
Vietnamese to take over. Thieu's programs, the
land reform program in particular, are working;
the Republic is stronger than it was a year ago."
"It's important, not to roll back
Communism, but to discourage Communists
anywhere from using force to achieve their
objectives.
Turner smiles broadly. "This makes me
sound like a real hawk, doesn't it? Well, I've
always been very fond of peace and remain so
today. In some ways I find myself aligned with
the traditional hawks, but not for the same
reasons. I don't think they appreciate the
political aspects of the struggle.
"You know, I don't really care if people
agree with me or not, but I don't like to be
stereotyped or dismissed."
