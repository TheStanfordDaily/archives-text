## 'Boycott Farah Products' 
### 
ijessee calvillo

On May 9, 1972, in El Paso, Texas, Chicano
employees of Farah went on strike, citing unfair
labor practices by Farah. The strike by 2000
employees sought to meet basic demands put forth
by Chicano workers, such as union recognition,
negotiated production standards, rehiring of fellow
workers fired for union activities, maternity
benefits, better wages, etc.
The strike has reached national attention and
publicity. The strike is now going into its ninth
month of existence.
Farah Manufacturing Company is the world's
largest maker of women's, men's, and boys' slacks.
Farah employs 9500 employees of which 94 percent
are Chicano. It has a sales volume of $164.6 million,
a net profit of $6 million and a payroll of $40
million. The company has four plants in El Paso,
two in San Antonio, one in Victoria, Texas, one in
Las Cruces, New Mexico, one in Belgium and one in
Hong Kong.
The company operates on a quota system which
works according to the output of the individual
worker. If the worker increases his output he is
given a raise, if not he is pressured into increasing it
or be fired or replaced.
Farah has gone to the extent of using police dogs
to stop workers from picketing his plants, to
violating every law in favor of the strikers. Farah has
constantly refused to bargain with the strikers'
bargaining agent and union representation the
Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America
(A.C.W.A.).
The strike has been characterized by unjust mass
arrests of pickets on warrants issued by Peace
Justice Lewis with bonds posted at $400 per person.

An investigation proved strikers named on warrants
were in some cases out of town promoting
nationwide boycotts of Farah products; one woman
charged was not even on strike but at work at the
plant.
Meany's Support
On July 19,1972, a nationwide boycott of Farah
products was called by George Meany, president of
the AFL-CIO, and called on all unions making up
the organizations 18 million members to support
Farah strikers and to publicize the boycott.
On Oct. 19, 1972, a world wide boycott of the
Farah Co., was urged by the World Congress of the
International Textile, Garment and Leather Workers
Federation.
The strike is supported by the Teamsters,
Meatcutters, Steelworkers, Building Trades, United
Auto Workers and others.
Political Figures
Among the political figures supporting the strike
are George McGovern, Sargeant Shriver, Sen. Joseph
Montoya, Sen. Ted Kennedy, Rep. Edward Roybal,
New York Mayor John Lindsay and others.
A victory by the strikers and the union will
perhaps lead other working people, especially
Chicanos, to seek organization and unionization to
preserve their dignity as working people.
People can aid the strike effort by supporting its
activities and possibly gain a victory for Chicanos
struggling to make a better living in a racist and
oppressive society by refusing to buy Farah
products wherever they are sold. BOYCOTT
FARAH PRODUCTS!

largest maker of women's, men's, and boys' slacks.
Farah employs 9500 employees of which 94 percent
are Chicano. It has a sales volume of $164.6 million,
a net profit of $6 million and a payroll of $40
million. The company has four plants in El Paso,
two in San Antonio, one in Victoria, Texas, one in
Las Cruces, New Mexico, one in Belgium and one in
Hong Kong.
The company operates on a quota system which
works according to the output of the individual
worker. If the worker increases his output he is
given a raise, if not he is pressured into increasing it
or be fired or replaced.
Farah has gone to the extent of using police dogs
to stop workers from picketing his plants, to
violating every law in favor of the strikers. Farah has
constantly refused to bargain with the strikers'
bargaining agent and union representation the
Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America
(A.C.W.A.).
The strike has been characterized by unjust mass
arrests of pickets on warrants issued by Peace
Justice Lewis with bonds posted at $400 per person.

An investigation proved strikers named on warrants
were in some cases out of town promoting
nationwide boycotts of Farah products; one woman
charged was not even on strike but at work at the
plant.
Meany's Support
On July 19,1972, a nationwide boycott of Farah
products was called by George Meany, president of
the AFL-CIO, and called on all unions making up
the organizations 18 million members to support
Farah strikers and to publicize the boycott.
On Oct. 19, 1972, a world wide boycott of the
Farah Co., was urged by the World Congress of the
International Textile, Garment and Leather Workers
Federation.
The strike is supported by the Teamsters,
Meatcutters, Steelworkers, Building Trades, United
Auto Workers and others.
Political Figures
Among the political figures supporting the strike
are George McGovern, Sargeant Shriver, Sen. Joseph
Montoya, Sen. Ted Kennedy, Rep. Edward Roybal,
New York Mayor John Lindsay and others.
A victory by the strikers and the union will
perhaps lead other working people, especially
Chicanos, to seek organization and unionization to
preserve their dignity as working people.
People can aid the strike effort by supporting its
activities and possibly gain a victory for Chicanos
struggling to make a better living in a racist and
oppressive society by refusing to buy Farah
products wherever they are sold. BOYCOTT
FARAH PRODUCTS!

benefits, better wages, etc.
The strike has reached national attention and
publicity. The strike is now going into its ninth
