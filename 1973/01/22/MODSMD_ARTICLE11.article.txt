Shockley's Position
Editor:
The informative article of
Thursday, 11 Jan. 72, on the
Psychology Department
Colloquium, "The Nature of
Heritability of IQ and Its Social,
Economic and Political
Implications" calls for some
corrections:
(1) I state that "genetic factors
are four times as significant as
environmental factors in
determining intelligence [really,
IQ variance] as measured by IQ
tests" to be clearly proven only
for individuals like those from
families that raise one of a pair of
white identical twins. I am falsely
criticized when blamed for stating
that this proves Negro mental
inferiority.
(2) "He claims that the black
race is becoming less intelligent as
a group because the welfare
system encourages high birth rates
for the genetically inferior." I do
not claim this as proven. It is a
warranted conjecture that it is
irresponsible to leave
undiagnosed. It probably also
applies to whites.
(3) "Shockley favors
government payments to men
below average intelligence who
agree to be sterilized." This
unfortunate misquotation
perpetuates bad earlier reporting
by a wire service. I have proposed
no such action but a "THINKING
EXERCISE" applicable
"regardless of race, sex or welfare
status."
(4) "Shockley has accused the
intellectual community of
'cowardice.' " Cowardice is not
my word. I have no doubts about
the courage nor good intentions
of my critics. I believe they suffer
from what I call The
Apple-of-God's-Eye Obsession.
(5) "Recently, the National
Academy of Sciences agreed to
Shockley's request for a
behavioral genetics seminar..."
This proposed behavioral genetics
seminar was a surprise to me. I did
not propose it nor have I been
invited to participate in any way.
(6) "Shockley .. . has rarely
appeared on the same platform
with an opponent." In 1968 I
appeared with two black
opponents during "Black Is
Becoming," a San Jose State
College meeting. On 11 January,
the date of The Stanford Daily
article, I was appearing on a
platform with Professor Charles
Thomas, "the Father of Black
Psychology" and UCLA
anthropology Professor B. J.
Williams. Botii opposed my views
and questioned my motivations.
The occasion was the meeting of
the Unitarian Universalist
Ministers Association of the West
Coast, a relevant news story not
reported in The Stanford Daily
although I had previously
informed one of its staff
members. The debate was
repeated at the Unitarian Church
in Canoga Park, California last
Sunday. I have twice appeared on
TV debates with anthropologist
Ashley Montagu and also with
Herbert Williams, head of the
anthropology department at San
Francisco State College. Etc. I
have printed debate challenges to
Professors Cavalli-S forza,
Cronbach, and Ehrlich in the
columns of The Stanford Daily.
I am not reluctant to debate on
Human-Quality Problems and
Research Taboos when they are
under such auspices as a
Psychology Department
Colloquium.

New ASSU Elections
Editor:
There are currently 11 vacant
seats in the ASSU Senate, one in
Humanities and Sciences, two in
Education, two in Medicine, and
six in Engineering and Earth
Sciences. Chairman Rocky Barber
has requested that I hold a special
election to fill those seats. Thus
far, the election is scheduled for
Monday and Tuesday, Jan. 29 and
30. All petitions must be returned
by Wednesday, Jan. 24 (no later
than 5 p.m.).

It is absolutely imperative for
these seats to be filled, if the
Senate is to be truly
representative of all fields of
study on campus. This year's
Senate has functioned at 10 times
the efficiency of last year's
Senate, so one should not be
misguided by the Senate's former
reputation if you were thinking of
running.
In order to make the ASSU a
meaningful organization, the
students themselves must show
interest. These Senate seats, if
they remain vacant, only indicate
a manifest lack of concern for
ASSU business (i.e., what is done
with your money) on the part of
those students not represented.
This is not a big issue but it is one
that needs the attentions of those
schools who are not part of this
year's Student Government.

ASSU Elections Commissioner
(Editor's note: Senate candidates'
statements will be published in
the"Letters" section of the
Daily in the order received and
as space permits until the
election.)
Rosenhan Study Disputed
Editor:
Over the past summer I was a
student in a seminar in Law and
Psychiatry taught by Mr. David
Wexler (Univ. of Arizona School
of Law) and Dr. David Rosenhan
(Department of Psychology,
Stanford). Along with others in
the class, I had the privilege of
reading Dr. Rosenhan's study
referred to in the Jan. 18 issue of
The Daily. I have two objections
to the laudatory manner in which
the study was presented.
First, despite the sensational
appeal of the study, it is anything
but a "carefully planned
psychological experiment," as
most first year psychology
students could attest. The
personal prejudgments of the
individuals pervade the study.
For example, the study
bemoaned the fact that
psychiatrists generally spend little
time with their patients. To make
their point, the experimenters
selected a girl who was not a
student to ask questions of busy
faculty members who were going
to and from class on a large
university campus. Strangely
enough the faculty members, as
opposed to the psychiatrists, were
quite willing to answer the
questions. (One can only ponder
how pretty the girl was.)
Needless to say, a university
campus is not a psychiatric ward
in the eyes of most people, and
any comparative analysis suffers
greatly as a result. To say that
faculty members are willing to
spend more time with a young girl
than psychiatrists spend with
patients in a ward is no basis for
belittling contemporary mental
health care.
Secondly, the idea of labelling
or mislabelling mental patients
and its resultant effects is not by
any means a new one (cf. Asylums
by Erving Goffman, Anchor
Books, 1961). Perhaps, if Dr.
Rosenhan had attended the
seminar which he was allegedly
teaching more than the two or
three times that he did, he might
have learned just how old the idea
is.

Lonely Prisoners
Editor:
We certainly would appreciate
receiving mail from anyone on the
outside. It is very lonely here as
an inmate at the London
Correctional Institution. All
letters will be answered promptly.
