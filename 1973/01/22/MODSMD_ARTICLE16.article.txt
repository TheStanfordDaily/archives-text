# Cross Suit Dismissed
## 
### GEORGE DOBBINS 
Acting on a motion made by a
Stanford defense attorney, the
State Court of Appeals has
dismissed a case in which Stanford
alumna Dr. Nancy Jewell Cross
charged the University with
"sex-race discrimination in
education and employment."
Cross claims that the judge
gave no reason for dismissal, told
her she could not re-petition for
another hearing and would not let
her present her side of the
argument. She is currently
petitioning the Supreme Court of
California to hear the case.
The case dates back to March,
1971, when Cross and Linda
Crouse, a hospital worker and
representative of the United Front
Against Racist and Political
Firings, filed a suit charging
President Richard W. Lyman,
Dean of Admissions Fred
Hargadon, and Dean of Graduate
Studies Lincoln Moses, with
"sex-race privileged admissions
and financial aid distribution."
The plaintiffs asked for "equal
facilities and advantages in the
University to both sexes," citing
the University's founding charter.
After a series of
112

postponements and deliberations,
the case was brought before Santa
Clara County Superior Court
Judge John Mclnerny for the
second time, in November, 1971.
By that time, the plaintiffs had
named two new defendants â€” the
Department of Health, Education
and Welfare and the state of
California.
Mclnerny dismissed the case,
ruling that under California law,
only the state attorney general,
and not individuals representing a
class, can sue to enforce the
charter of a charitable trust such
as Stanford.
In January, 1972, Cross
reopened the case, accusing
Mclnerney of "perceptual
disability." Crouse emphasized
the nature of the suit, "We aren't
looking for a 50-50 ratio. We're
looking for no ratio limitations at
all."
Cross claims that the judges
hearing her case "want to deprive
women of equal citizenship."
