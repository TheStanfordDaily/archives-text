# Hastorf Plans Return To Teaching, Research
## 
### 
Albert H. Hastorf, dean of the Stanford School of Humanities and
Sciences since 1970, has asked to leave his administrative post and
return to teaching and research and psychology at the end of the
current academic year.
His decision has been accepted with regret by University Provost
William F. Miller and President Richard W. Lyman.
Lyman praised Hastorf for "taking on one of the most challenging
assignments in the University" and said Hastorf "brought to the job
an extraordinary combination of sound judgment, shrewd insight, and
warm, human sympathy."
Provost Miller called Hastorf "a truly outstanding dean as well as a
very fine person.
"It is with deep regret that I accept his resignation. But, at the
same time, I respect his desire to return to teaching and research."
Hastorf viewed the deanship with reluctance when first approached
on the job by Lyman and looked forward to returning to his
professorship full-time more than a year ago.
He expressed strong support for the School's practice of drawing
its top academic officers from within the faculty ranks for relatively
brief terms.
"This is a concept of tithing that faculty members owe
themselves," he commented. "You go in, try to do the job as
responsibly as possible, then get out and go back to full-time faculty
activity before it's too late to be retooled."
Besides providing greater faculty impact on academic policy, he
said, this practice creates "some sophistication among the faculty
concerning administrative problems."
One of the principal challenges facing his successor will be to plan
"exciting educational programs" within this relatively stable fiscal
environment.
