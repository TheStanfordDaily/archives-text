# Indiana Crushes Swimmers
## The 						Stanford Daily SPORTS 
### MIKE CHASSON 
The Indiana University
swimming team displayed its
awesome power before a packed
house at the Encina Pools last
Saturday to crush Stanford 81-32.
The Hoosiers who had what
coach Dr. James Councilman
termed "some emotionally keyed
up performances," set four new
pool records in coasting to
victory. Councilman emphasized
that this was the first time in five
years that Indiana has been
"psyched up" for a dual meet.
Indiana started strong with a
new pool record in the 400
medley relay with the team of
Mike Stamm, Brock Laedwig,
Gary Hall, and Gary Connely
swimming a 3.27.8, breaking the
old record of 3.29.2 set by Santa
Clara Swim Club in 1967.
Stanford Second
Stanford finished second in
3.29.4 with the team of Randy
Whitchurch, John Hencken, Brian
Job, and Martin Pedley. The

Cardinals led after Hencken's
breastroke leg, but Hall pulled
away from Job on the fly to put it
away. Both times currently rank
one-two in the country for this
season.
In the 1000 free, Hoosiers
senior John Kinsella and freshman
Bruce Dickson took the lead at
the gun and dualed each other
until 800 yards when Dickson
pulled away to win in an amazing
9.26.3.
Kinsella finished second in
9.30.0, while Terry Sutton of
Stanford finished third in a
lifetime best of 9.39.3. All three
swimmers were under the old pool
record of 9.44.9 set by Olympian
Mike Burton last year.
Councilman Predicts
Councilman noted later that he
had told Dickson he could swim a
9.30 if he wanted, and he was
extremely happy when the
freshman went even faster.
Councilman was also happy with
Kinsella, who holds the American

record of 9.17.6, since he has only
been working out since December
when he returned from a vacation
in Europe.
Hoosiers Tom Hickox and Bill
Heiss cruised to a convincing
one-two finish in the 200 free.
Hickox finished in 1.43.2 to
Heiss' 1.43.7, with Richard Cook
finishing third in 1.46.2 for the
Cardinals.
Stanford gained back some
respect in the 50 free when Dean
Anderson and Steve Carey went
one-two, both recording identical
21.6 clockings. Freshman Bruce
Goodwin finished third for
Stanford in 21.9, but Indiana got
the points because of the no
sweep rule in swimming.
The Hoosiers came right back,
however, in the 200 IM with Hall
winning in 1.56.6 followed by Pat
O'Conner in 1.57.8. Hencken
finished third in 1.59.5.
Hall's Record
Hall, who holds the American
record of 1.51.5 in this event,

held the lead on the fly and back
with Hencken closing in on the
breastroke. Hall and O'Conner
then both pulled away on the
free.
Following a one-two finish for
Hoosiers Scott Cranham and Dave
Byers in the one-meter diving,
Bob Alsfelder and Duncan Scott
swam to an easy one-two finish in
the 200 fly with Alsfelder winning
in 1.54.1 and Scott second in
1.55.7. Sutton finished third for
Stanford in 2.00.
The Cardinals next big race
came in the 100 free as the
sprinters proved that their 50 free
victory was no fluke by taking
first and second in the 100 free.
Pedley took it out hard and held
on to finish in a first place tie
with Anderson both at 47.4.
Connely finished third in 47.6,
with Goodwin fourth in 48.4.
200 Backstroke
The Indiana onslaught
continued in the 200 backstroke,
however, with Stamm winning in

a new pool record of 1.54.4. This
broke the old record of 1.56.4 set
by Fred Haywood of Stanford in
1971. Larry Barbiere finished
second in 1.57.2 with Whitchurch
third in 1.58.0.
The 500 free provided a
rematch for Kinsella against
Dickson. Kinsella, the American
record holder in this event at
4.24.5 took it out hard to win it
in a new pool record of 4.37.0.
This broke the old record of
4.40.7 set by Tom Mcßreen of
USC in 1971.
Dickson, also under the record,
finished second in 4.39.0 with
Cardinal Steve Strong third in
4.49.1. Freshman Paul Clark
finished fourth in a lifetime best
of 4.49.4 for Stanford.
Stanford finished first and

second in the 200 breast with Job
breaking his own pool record of
2.06.9 in recording a 2.05.5.
Hencken finished second -in
2.10.8, with Dan Green of Indiana
third in 2.14.4.
Indiana finished off the meet
with a one-two finish in the
three-meter diving with Don Muir
and Steve Byers, and a win in the
400 free relay with the team of
Murphy, Hickox, Heiss, and
Connely going 3.09.4 to
Stanford's 3.11.4.
Coach Jim Gaughran, though
obviously not happy with losing
so badly, was pleased with many
of the swims against the tough
Hoosiers. "The sprinters did an
excellent job," stated Gaughran.
"We have never had so many
sprinters qualify for the NCAA

Championships this early in the
season."
Gaughran Talks
Gaughran expressed the belief
that swimming against tough
opposition, like Indiana, is very
beneficial in showing the team
what it must do by the end of the
season. "I think on the basis of
this meet we will do very well
against USC and UCLA,"
explained Gaughran.
Councilman was very pleased
with his squad's performance,
with the exception of the sprints.
"We were hoping to break up
Stanford's one-two finishes in the
50 and 100," stated a happy
Councilman.
"We did not prepare in any
special way for this meet. The
team did get extra rest, however,
as we flew out here Thursday and
had an easy meet Friday."
He was especially pleased with
Dickson, who is rapidly
developing into one of Indiana's
finest swimmers while only a
freshman.
Next Saturday the Cardinals
take on Santa Clara Swim Club at
the Encina Pools.

came in the 100 free as the
sprinters proved that their 50 free
victory was no fluke by taking
first and second in the 100 free.
Pedley took it out hard and held
on to finish in a first place tie
with Anderson both at 47.4.
Connely finished third in 47.6,
with Goodwin fourth in 48.4.
200 Backstroke
The Indiana onslaught
continued in the 200 backstroke,
however, with Stamm winning in

a new pool record of 1.54.4. This
broke the old record of 1.56.4 set
by Fred Haywood of Stanford in
1971. Larry Barbiere finished
second in 1.57.2 with Whitchurch
third in 1.58.0.
The 500 free provided a
rematch for Kinsella against
Dickson. Kinsella, the American
record holder in this event at
4.24.5 took it out hard to win it
in a new pool record of 4.37.0.
This broke the old record of
4.40.7 set by Tom Mcßreen of
USC in 1971.
Dickson, also under the record,
finished second in 4.39.0 with
Cardinal Steve Strong third in
4.49.1. Freshman Paul Clark
finished fourth in a lifetime best
of 4.49.4 for Stanford.
Stanford finished first and

second in the 200 breast with Job
breaking his own pool record of
2.06.9 in recording a 2.05.5.
Hencken finished second -in
2.10.8, with Dan Green of Indiana
third in 2.14.4.
Indiana finished off the meet
with a one-two finish in the
three-meter diving with Don Muir
and Steve Byers, and a win in the
400 free relay with the team of
Murphy, Hickox, Heiss, and
Connely going 3.09.4 to
Stanford's 3.11.4.
Coach Jim Gaughran, though
obviously not happy with losing
so badly, was pleased with many
of the swims against the tough
Hoosiers. "The sprinters did an
excellent job," stated Gaughran.
"We have never had so many
sprinters qualify for the NCAA

Championships this early in the
season."
Gaughran Talks
Gaughran expressed the belief
that swimming against tough
opposition, like Indiana, is very
beneficial in showing the team
what it must do by the end of the
season. "I think on the basis of
this meet we will do very well
against USC and UCLA,"
explained Gaughran.
Councilman was very pleased
with his squad's performance,
with the exception of the sprints.
"We were hoping to break up
Stanford's one-two finishes in the
50 and 100," stated a happy
Councilman.
"We did not prepare in any
special way for this meet. The
team did get extra rest, however,
as we flew out here Thursday and
had an easy meet Friday."
He was especially pleased with
Dickson, who is rapidly
developing into one of Indiana's
finest swimmers while only a
freshman.
Next Saturday the Cardinals
take on Santa Clara Swim Club at
the Encina Pools.
The Indiana University
swimming team displayed its
awesome power before a packed
house at the Encina Pools last
Saturday to crush Stanford 81-32.
The Hoosiers who had what
coach Dr. James Councilman
termed "some emotionally keyed
up performances," set four new
pool records in coasting to
victory. Councilman emphasized
that this was the first time in five
years that Indiana has been
"psyched up" for a dual meet.
Indiana started strong with a
new pool record in the 400
medley relay with the team of
Mike Stamm, Brock Laedwig,
Gary Hall, and Gary Connely
swimming a 3.27.8, breaking the
old record of 3.29.2 set by Santa
Clara Swim Club in 1967.
Stanford Second
Stanford finished second in
3.29.4 with the team of Randy
Whitchurch, John Hencken, Brian
Job, and Martin Pedley. The

Cardinals led after Hencken's
breastroke leg, but Hall pulled
away from Job on the fly to put it
away. Both times currently rank
one-two in the country for this
season.
In the 1000 free, Hoosiers
senior John Kinsella and freshman
Bruce Dickson took the lead at
the gun and dualed each other
until 800 yards when Dickson
pulled away to win in an amazing
9.26.3.
Kinsella finished second in
9.30.0, while Terry Sutton of
Stanford finished third in a
lifetime best of 9.39.3. All three
swimmers were under the old pool
record of 9.44.9 set by Olympian
Mike Burton last year.
Councilman Predicts
Councilman noted later that he
had told Dickson he could swim a
9.30 if he wanted, and he was
extremely happy when the
freshman went even faster.
Councilman was also happy with
Kinsella, who holds the American

record of 9.17.6, since he has only
been working out since December
when he returned from a vacation
in Europe.
Hoosiers Tom Hickox and Bill
Heiss cruised to a convincing
one-two finish in the 200 free.
Hickox finished in 1.43.2 to
Heiss' 1.43.7, with Richard Cook
finishing third in 1.46.2 for the
Cardinals.
Stanford gained back some
respect in the 50 free when Dean
Anderson and Steve Carey went
one-two, both recording identical
21.6 clockings. Freshman Bruce
Goodwin finished third for
Stanford in 21.9, but Indiana got
the points because of the no
sweep rule in swimming.
The Hoosiers came right back,
however, in the 200 IM with Hall
winning in 1.56.6 followed by Pat
O'Conner in 1.57.8. Hencken
finished third in 1.59.5.
Hall's Record
Hall, who holds the American
record of 1.51.5 in this event,

held the lead on the fly and back
with Hencken closing in on the
breastroke. Hall and O'Conner
then both pulled away on the
free.
Following a one-two finish for
Hoosiers Scott Cranham and Dave
Byers in the one-meter diving,
Bob Alsfelder and Duncan Scott
swam to an easy one-two finish in
the 200 fly with Alsfelder winning
in 1.54.1 and Scott second in
1.55.7. Sutton finished third for
Stanford in 2.00.
The Cardinals next big race

pool records in coasting to
victory. Councilman emphasized
that this was the first time in five
years that Indiana has been
"psyched up" for a dual meet.
Indiana started strong with a
new pool record in the 400
medley relay with the team of
Mike Stamm, Brock Laedwig,
Gary Hall, and Gary Connely
swimming a 3.27.8, breaking the
old record of 3.29.2 set by Santa
Clara Swim Club in 1967.
Stanford Second
Stanford finished second in
3.29.4 with the team of Randy
Whitchurch, John Hencken, Brian
Job, and Martin Pedley. The

Cardinals led after Hencken's
breastroke leg, but Hall pulled
away from Job on the fly to put it
away. Both times currently rank
one-two in the country for this
season.
In the 1000 free, Hoosiers
senior John Kinsella and freshman
Bruce Dickson took the lead at
the gun and dualed each other
until 800 yards when Dickson
pulled away to win in an amazing
9.26.3.
Kinsella finished second in
9.30.0, while Terry Sutton of
Stanford finished third in a
lifetime best of 9.39.3. All three
swimmers were under the old pool
record of 9.44.9 set by Olympian
Mike Burton last year.
Councilman Predicts
Councilman noted later that he
had told Dickson he could swim a
9.30 if he wanted, and he was
extremely happy when the
freshman went even faster.
Councilman was also happy with
Kinsella, who holds the American

record of 9.17.6, since he has only
been working out since December
when he returned from a vacation
in Europe.
Hoosiers Tom Hickox and Bill
Heiss cruised to a convincing
one-two finish in the 200 free.
Hickox finished in 1.43.2 to
Heiss' 1.43.7, with Richard Cook
finishing third in 1.46.2 for the
Cardinals.
Stanford gained back some
respect in the 50 free when Dean
Anderson and Steve Carey went
one-two, both recording identical
21.6 clockings. Freshman Bruce
Goodwin finished third for
Stanford in 21.9, but Indiana got
the points because of the no
sweep rule in swimming.
The Hoosiers came right back,
however, in the 200 IM with Hall
winning in 1.56.6 followed by Pat
O'Conner in 1.57.8. Hencken
finished third in 1.59.5.
Hall's Record
Hall, who holds the American
record of 1.51.5 in this event,

held the lead on the fly and back
with Hencken closing in on the
breastroke. Hall and O'Conner
then both pulled away on the
free.
Following a one-two finish for
Hoosiers Scott Cranham and Dave
Byers in the one-meter diving,
Bob Alsfelder and Duncan Scott
swam to an easy one-two finish in
the 200 fly with Alsfelder winning
in 1.54.1 and Scott second in
1.55.7. Sutton finished third for
Stanford in 2.00.
The Cardinals next big race
came in the 100 free as the
sprinters proved that their 50 free
victory was no fluke by taking
first and second in the 100 free.
Pedley took it out hard and held
on to finish in a first place tie
with Anderson both at 47.4.
Connely finished third in 47.6,
with Goodwin fourth in 48.4.
200 Backstroke
The Indiana onslaught
continued in the 200 backstroke,
however, with Stamm winning in

a new pool record of 1.54.4. This
broke the old record of 1.56.4 set
by Fred Haywood of Stanford in
1971. Larry Barbiere finished
second in 1.57.2 with Whitchurch
third in 1.58.0.
The 500 free provided a
rematch for Kinsella against
Dickson. Kinsella, the American
record holder in this event at
4.24.5 took it out hard to win it
in a new pool record of 4.37.0.
This broke the old record of
4.40.7 set by Tom Mcßreen of
USC in 1971.
Dickson, also under the record,
finished second in 4.39.0 with
Cardinal Steve Strong third in
4.49.1. Freshman Paul Clark
finished fourth in a lifetime best
of 4.49.4 for Stanford.
Stanford finished first and

second in the 200 breast with Job
breaking his own pool record of
2.06.9 in recording a 2.05.5.
Hencken finished second -in
2.10.8, with Dan Green of Indiana
third in 2.14.4.
Indiana finished off the meet
with a one-two finish in the
three-meter diving with Don Muir
and Steve Byers, and a win in the
400 free relay with the team of
Murphy, Hickox, Heiss, and
Connely going 3.09.4 to
Stanford's 3.11.4.
Coach Jim Gaughran, though
obviously not happy with losing
so badly, was pleased with many
of the swims against the tough
Hoosiers. "The sprinters did an
excellent job," stated Gaughran.
"We have never had so many
sprinters qualify for the NCAA

Championships this early in the
season."
Gaughran Talks
Gaughran expressed the belief
that swimming against tough
opposition, like Indiana, is very
beneficial in showing the team
what it must do by the end of the
season. "I think on the basis of
this meet we will do very well
against USC and UCLA,"
explained Gaughran.
Councilman was very pleased
with his squad's performance,
with the exception of the sprints.
"We were hoping to break up
Stanford's one-two finishes in the
50 and 100," stated a happy
Councilman.
"We did not prepare in any
special way for this meet. The
team did get extra rest, however,
as we flew out here Thursday and
had an easy meet Friday."
He was especially pleased with
Dickson, who is rapidly
developing into one of Indiana's
finest swimmers while only a
freshman.
Next Saturday the Cardinals
take on Santa Clara Swim Club at
the Encina Pools.
The Indiana University
swimming team displayed its
awesome power before a packed
house at the Encina Pools last
Saturday to crush Stanford 81-32.

Connely finished third in 47.6,
with Goodwin fourth in 48.4.
200 Backstroke
The Indiana onslaught
continued in the 200 backstroke,
however, with Stamm winning in

a new pool record of 1.54.4. This
broke the old record of 1.56.4 set
by Fred Haywood of Stanford in
1971. Larry Barbiere finished
second in 1.57.2 with Whitchurch
third in 1.58.0.
The 500 free provided a
rematch for Kinsella against
Dickson. Kinsella, the American
record holder in this event at
4.24.5 took it out hard to win it
in a new pool record of 4.37.0.
This broke the old record of
4.40.7 set by Tom Mcßreen of
USC in 1971.
Dickson, also under the record,
finished second in 4.39.0 with
Cardinal Steve Strong third in
4.49.1. Freshman Paul Clark
finished fourth in a lifetime best
of 4.49.4 for Stanford.
Stanford finished first and

second in the 200 breast with Job
breaking his own pool record of
2.06.9 in recording a 2.05.5.
Hencken finished second -in
2.10.8, with Dan Green of Indiana
third in 2.14.4.
Indiana finished off the meet
with a one-two finish in the
three-meter diving with Don Muir
and Steve Byers, and a win in the
400 free relay with the team of
Murphy, Hickox, Heiss, and
Connely going 3.09.4 to
Stanford's 3.11.4.
Coach Jim Gaughran, though
obviously not happy with losing
so badly, was pleased with many
of the swims against the tough
Hoosiers. "The sprinters did an
excellent job," stated Gaughran.
"We have never had so many
sprinters qualify for the NCAA

Championships this early in the
season."
Gaughran Talks
Gaughran expressed the belief
that swimming against tough
opposition, like Indiana, is very
beneficial in showing the team
what it must do by the end of the
season. "I think on the basis of
this meet we will do very well
against USC and UCLA,"
explained Gaughran.
Councilman was very pleased
with his squad's performance,
with the exception of the sprints.
"We were hoping to break up
Stanford's one-two finishes in the
50 and 100," stated a happy
Councilman.
"We did not prepare in any
special way for this meet. The
team did get extra rest, however,
as we flew out here Thursday and
had an easy meet Friday."
He was especially pleased with
Dickson, who is rapidly
developing into one of Indiana's
finest swimmers while only a
freshman.
Next Saturday the Cardinals
take on Santa Clara Swim Club at
the Encina Pools.
