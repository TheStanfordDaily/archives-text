# Kelley Scores 30
## Cards Edge Utah, 80-71 
### STAN WILSON 
Stanford's big men Rich Kelley
(7-0) and Tim Patterson (611)
combined for 46 points and 19
rebounds as the Cards swept by
Utah, 80-71, before 3829 fans at
Maples Pavilion on Saturday
night.
Kelley dominated the first half,
hitting 9-11 from the field, and
grabbing nine rebounds. In
addition, the talented sophomore
didn't have a turnover the entire
contest, a problem which plagued
him the weekend before against
USC and UCLA.
The Cards shot a torrid 61
percent from the field in the first
half, but couldn't pull away from
the short but quick Utes. Utah
connected on 49 percent of its
field goal attempts, as the Cards
held a 41-36 advantage at the half.
Ute guard Bernard Tomlin, a
reserve, kept the game close, as he
hit five long jumpers before the
intermission to account for ten
points. But the Utes couldn't
handle the taller Cards,

particularly Kelley. Stanford
seemed to jell; the Cards cut down
their turnovers and scored
unselfishly with some fine assists.
Stanford guard Mark Gilberg
showed some fine-shooting in the
first half, connecting on four long
field goals over the Utah zone,
and adding another two free
throws to give him ten points.
Stanford never trailed in the
second half, but two buckets by
Utah's 6-8 center Mike Sojouner
cut the Cards' lead to 57-55 with
10:04 to go in the contest.The
Cards called time out, and with
buckets by Patterson, Kelley and
Mel Arterberry, Stanford built its
lead to seven, and finally ten
points.
Kelley got into foul trouble
early in the second half, but
freshman Patterson, who started
the second half along with Kelley,
picked up the scoring slack.
Patterson had some pretty
impressive second half statistics —
16 points, seven rebounds, and
five assists. Kelley had easily his
finest night of the season, as he
scored 30 points, a season high for
the Cards, pulled down 12

rebounds, and shot 80 percent
(12-15) from the field.
Junior forward Steve Shupe
sparked the Cards late in the first
half, and ended the game with ten
points, converting five of seven
field goal attempts. In addition to
Kelley, Patterson, and Shupe,
Gilberg was the only other Card in
double figures with his ten first
half points, but the 6-0
sophomore had five assists to tie
teammate Patterson in that
category.
As a team Stanford cut down
its turnovers from 28 the week
before against USC to 13 against
the Utes. The Cards held a
rebounding edge of 42-37, and
shot an excellent 52 percent from
the floor. In addition, it was
encouraging to see the cards
handle Utah's agressive
man-to-man pressure.
Stanford is now 7-7 on the
season; Utah is 5-13. Stanford's
next game is Jan. 26 against UCSB
at Santa Barbara. The Cards
resume Pac-Eight play on
Saturday, Feb. 3 against the
University of California, in a
televised game at Berkeley.

The Cards shot a torrid 61
percent from the field in the first
half, but couldn't pull away from
the short but quick Utes. Utah
connected on 49 percent of its
field goal attempts, as the Cards
held a 41-36 advantage at the half.
Ute guard Bernard Tomlin, a
reserve, kept the game close, as he
hit five long jumpers before the
intermission to account for ten
points. But the Utes couldn't
handle the taller Cards,

particularly Kelley. Stanford
seemed to jell; the Cards cut down
their turnovers and scored
unselfishly with some fine assists.
Stanford guard Mark Gilberg
showed some fine-shooting in the
first half, connecting on four long
field goals over the Utah zone,
and adding another two free
throws to give him ten points.
Stanford never trailed in the
second half, but two buckets by
Utah's 6-8 center Mike Sojouner
cut the Cards' lead to 57-55 with
10:04 to go in the contest.The
Cards called time out, and with
buckets by Patterson, Kelley and
Mel Arterberry, Stanford built its
lead to seven, and finally ten
points.
Kelley got into foul trouble
early in the second half, but
freshman Patterson, who started
the second half along with Kelley,
picked up the scoring slack.
Patterson had some pretty
impressive second half statistics —
16 points, seven rebounds, and
five assists. Kelley had easily his
finest night of the season, as he
scored 30 points, a season high for
the Cards, pulled down 12

rebounds, and shot 80 percent
(12-15) from the field.
Junior forward Steve Shupe
sparked the Cards late in the first
half, and ended the game with ten
points, converting five of seven
field goal attempts. In addition to
Kelley, Patterson, and Shupe,
Gilberg was the only other Card in
double figures with his ten first
half points, but the 6-0
sophomore had five assists to tie
teammate Patterson in that
category.
As a team Stanford cut down
its turnovers from 28 the week
before against USC to 13 against
the Utes. The Cards held a
rebounding edge of 42-37, and
shot an excellent 52 percent from
the floor. In addition, it was
encouraging to see the cards
handle Utah's agressive
man-to-man pressure.
Stanford is now 7-7 on the
season; Utah is 5-13. Stanford's
next game is Jan. 26 against UCSB
at Santa Barbara. The Cards
resume Pac-Eight play on
Saturday, Feb. 3 against the
University of California, in a
televised game at Berkeley.

first half, connecting on four long
field goals over the Utah zone,
and adding another two free
throws to give him ten points.
Stanford never trailed in the
second half, but two buckets by
Utah's 6-8 center Mike Sojouner
cut the Cards' lead to 57-55 with
10:04 to go in the contest.The
Cards called time out, and with
buckets by Patterson, Kelley and
Mel Arterberry, Stanford built its
lead to seven, and finally ten
points.
Kelley got into foul trouble
early in the second half, but
freshman Patterson, who started
the second half along with Kelley,
picked up the scoring slack.
Patterson had some pretty
impressive second half statistics —
16 points, seven rebounds, and
five assists. Kelley had easily his
finest night of the season, as he
scored 30 points, a season high for
the Cards, pulled down 12

rebounds, and shot 80 percent
(12-15) from the field.
Junior forward Steve Shupe
sparked the Cards late in the first
half, and ended the game with ten
points, converting five of seven
field goal attempts. In addition to
Kelley, Patterson, and Shupe,
Gilberg was the only other Card in
double figures with his ten first
half points, but the 6-0
sophomore had five assists to tie
teammate Patterson in that
category.
As a team Stanford cut down
its turnovers from 28 the week
before against USC to 13 against
the Utes. The Cards held a
rebounding edge of 42-37, and
shot an excellent 52 percent from
the floor. In addition, it was
encouraging to see the cards
handle Utah's agressive
man-to-man pressure.
Stanford is now 7-7 on the
season; Utah is 5-13. Stanford's
next game is Jan. 26 against UCSB
at Santa Barbara. The Cards
resume Pac-Eight play on
Saturday, Feb. 3 against the
University of California, in a
televised game at Berkeley.

REBOUND BY ARTERBERRY - Stanford's Mel Arterberry (34)
grabs a rebound in a crowd of Utah players. Center Rich Kelley scored
30 points as the Cards defeated the Utes 80-71.
Stanford's big men Rich Kelley
(7-0) and Tim Patterson (611)
combined for 46 points and 19
rebounds as the Cards swept by
Utah, 80-71, before 3829 fans at
Maples Pavilion on Saturday
night.
Kelley dominated the first half,
hitting 9-11 from the field, and
grabbing nine rebounds. In
addition, the talented sophomore
didn't have a turnover the entire
contest, a problem which plagued
him the weekend before against
USC and UCLA.
The Cards shot a torrid 61
percent from the field in the first
half, but couldn't pull away from
the short but quick Utes. Utah
connected on 49 percent of its
field goal attempts, as the Cards
held a 41-36 advantage at the half.
Ute guard Bernard Tomlin, a
reserve, kept the game close, as he
hit five long jumpers before the
intermission to account for ten
points. But the Utes couldn't
handle the taller Cards,

particularly Kelley. Stanford
seemed to jell; the Cards cut down
their turnovers and scored
unselfishly with some fine assists.
Stanford guard Mark Gilberg
showed some fine-shooting in the
first half, connecting on four long
field goals over the Utah zone,
and adding another two free
throws to give him ten points.
