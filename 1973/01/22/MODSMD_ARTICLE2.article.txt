# Parking Causes Lots Of Trouble, Part-Time Staffers Hardest Hit
## 
### JANET SANDERS 
With the continued development
and expansion of the University, the
Stanford administration has
encountered a problem which has
plagued the modern metropolis for
years: parking.
When the new Law School covered
up two large parking lots, the problem
jumped from serious to critical,
especially for the White Plaza area.
The staff of the University has been
hardest hit by the scarcity of available
parking spaces. The faculty has
specifically designated parking spaces,
and most students are either within
bicycling range of the campus or live
on the campus. Construction workers,
maintenance men and important
guests of the University may park
anywhere except next to a fire
hydrant.
"Particularly inconvenienced are
staff members who do not work
full-time," said Harvey Hall, University
Ombudsman who recently issued a
report outlining the parking problem.
"It is no longer possible to leave the
University grounds at noontime and
hope to find a parking place on one's
return," he commented.
When the location of the Law
School was decided, "we anticipated
the parking problem," said Oscar
Nelson of the Planning Office. Lot J,
an area bordered by Alvarado Row,
Lane A and the new Law School, was
proposed, and if implemented, "it
would ultimately provide up to 650
parking spaces," stated Nelson.

But last year, the administration
rejected the Lot J proposal. "They
were not convinced of the need.
Maybe the problem needed to become
an actuality first," theorized Nelson.
He pointed out that funding of the
proposal was also a problem.
Hall also blamed the
administration's inaction on the
"feeling that there should not be
parking lots in the middle of the
campus. We still would like to see the
University as a place where people get
around on bicycles," he said. Such a
possibility gets more remote as new
and bigger buildings are constructed,
adding to the need for hundreds of
staff workers who must drive to work.
The Lot J proposal is coming up
again this spring, and Nelson expressed
his hope that a decision would be
made on it. In the meantime, the
Planning Office is working on some
short-term remedies to the parking
problem.
One suggestion is to designate
special spaces to staff. Another idea is
to switch Stern Hall residents' parking
over to the Wilbur Parking lot, which
is never full. According to Nelson, this
action would provide 205 extra
parking spaces. "Of course, no one is
going to like it, but when the ship is
sinking, you use your fur coat to stop
up the holes," Nelson said.
Such suggestions will merely
postpone the problem for a short time.
Either the administration will have to
stop constructing and planning large
buildings in the middle of the campus,
or it must bow to the need for some

ugly additions of new parking lots.
Public Safety Department Director
Marvin Herrington announced Friday
officers from his Department would
begin ticketing cars with expired
faculty or staff stickers beginning on
Feb. 1. He also warned that, in the
future, all citations would come under
the jurisdiction of the Santa Clara
County Municipal Court. Stickers
should be placed on the left end of the
rear bumper.
