# Frosh Suffer Two Losses
## 
### MARK WHITE 
Unable to score when they had
to, the Stanford freshman
basketball team dropped two
games last weekend, a 62-41 loss
to Menlo College Friday night and
a 70-65 loss to Cal State at
Hay ward Saturday.
In both games the Cardinals
stayed close in the first half, but
fell far behind at the outset of the
second half. In the game against
Menlo Friday, Stanford trailed by
two at halftime, 31-29, but was
outscored 12-2 in the first nine
minutes of the second stanza.
Similarly, they trailed Cal State
32-28 at halftime Saturday and
were outscored 10-4 in the first
five minutes of the second period.
In both games this second half
spurt by the opposition proved to
be the turning point. Once they
were behind by ten or more, the
Cards scrambled to catch up, but
they committed just enough
errors to allow the opponents to
control the game.
The 'Oak Pit'
The game in Menlo Park Friday
proved to be bizarre from the
outset. Played in an ancient gym
called the "Oak Pit," the ricketey
setting established the tone for
the contest between the Oaks and
the Cards. Somehow, three dozen
people in the decaying but
intimate arena generated more
noise than 10,000 screaming fans
in Maples Pavilion. The rising,
echoing crescendo of the 36 Oak
fans seemed to frazzle the Cards'
concentration, and during the
second half there was hardly a
moment when the Cards could

draw back to compose themselves.
Ed Schweitzer's 12 first half
points kept Stanford even
throughout most of the first half,
but Stanford's late period ball
handling problems allowed the
Oaks to score the last six points of
the period and take a two point
lead. The same ball handling
problems, errant passes and an
inability to muster a fast break,
continued and worsened in the
second half.
Wynn Wilson, Menlo's guard
who held scoring honors with 15
points, led a quick, pesty defense
that stifled the Cards in the
second half. Unable to hit from
the outside, the Cards tried to go
to their scoring strength,
Schweitzer, but the Oak
collapsing zone clogged up the
lane and Schweitzer couldn't get
the ball. Scoring only 12 second
half points, the Cards fell to the
Oaks, 62-41.
Back Home
Saturday the Cards came home
to play Hayward's Pioneers who
had only a 5-8 overall record,
including a loss to San Jose State
with whom Stanford had split two
games earlier this year. Once again
the Cards seemed to have better
personnel, but the Pioneers were
quicker and passed the ball better
in the clutches of the game.
Stanford controlled the game
for the first 15 minutes and held a
five point lead at the 4:19 mark.
Kevin Enright and Schweitzer
accounted for half of the team's
28 points during this period.
However, just as they appeared
to control the game, Stanford

EEB^ESS*!

turned cold on their outside shots
and the Pioneers scored nine
points in the last two minutes of
the half to take a 32-28 lead.
After being outscored 10-4 at
the start of the second half, the
Cards came back on Rich
Whohlstadter's passes and
Schweitzer's shooting to trail by
four, 43-47 at the 11:47 mark.
Rompel contributed two crucial
steals during the rally, but when
he had to leave the game with an
apparent eye injury minutes later,
Stanford gave up six straight
points and lost their momentum.
Hayward's guard, Tom Dayak,
handled the ball superbly in
breaking Stanford's desperation
press and led his team with 22
points and seven rebounds.
Schweitzer led the Cards with 27
points and 16 rebounds as
Stanford was plowed under by the
Pioneers 70-65.

points and lost their momentum.
Hayward's guard, Tom Dayak,
handled the ball superbly in
breaking Stanford's desperation
press and led his team with 22
points and seven rebounds.
Schweitzer led the Cards with 27
points and 16 rebounds as
Stanford was plowed under by the
Pioneers 70-65.
Unable to score when they had
to, the Stanford freshman
basketball team dropped two
games last weekend, a 62-41 loss
to Menlo College Friday night and
a 70-65 loss to Cal State at
Hay ward Saturday.
In both games the Cardinals
stayed close in the first half, but
fell far behind at the outset of the
second half. In the game against
Menlo Friday, Stanford trailed by
two at halftime, 31-29, but was
outscored 12-2 in the first nine
minutes of the second stanza.
Similarly, they trailed Cal State
32-28 at halftime Saturday and
were outscored 10-4 in the first
five minutes of the second period.
In both games this second half
spurt by the opposition proved to
be the turning point. Once they
were behind by ten or more, the
Cards scrambled to catch up, but
they committed just enough
errors to allow the opponents to
control the game.
The 'Oak Pit'
The game in Menlo Park Friday
proved to be bizarre from the
outset. Played in an ancient gym
called the "Oak Pit," the ricketey
setting established the tone for
the contest between the Oaks and
the Cards. Somehow, three dozen
people in the decaying but
intimate arena generated more
noise than 10,000 screaming fans
in Maples Pavilion. The rising,
echoing crescendo of the 36 Oak
fans seemed to frazzle the Cards'
concentration, and during the
second half there was hardly a
moment when the Cards could

draw back to compose themselves.
Ed Schweitzer's 12 first half
points kept Stanford even
throughout most of the first half,
but Stanford's late period ball
handling problems allowed the
Oaks to score the last six points of
the period and take a two point
lead. The same ball handling
problems, errant passes and an
inability to muster a fast break,
continued and worsened in the
second half.
Wynn Wilson, Menlo's guard
who held scoring honors with 15
points, led a quick, pesty defense
that stifled the Cards in the
second half. Unable to hit from
the outside, the Cards tried to go
to their scoring strength,
Schweitzer, but the Oak
collapsing zone clogged up the
lane and Schweitzer couldn't get
the ball. Scoring only 12 second
half points, the Cards fell to the
Oaks, 62-41.
Back Home
Saturday the Cards came home
to play Hayward's Pioneers who
had only a 5-8 overall record,
including a loss to San Jose State
with whom Stanford had split two
games earlier this year. Once again
the Cards seemed to have better
personnel, but the Pioneers were
quicker and passed the ball better
in the clutches of the game.
Stanford controlled the game
for the first 15 minutes and held a
five point lead at the 4:19 mark.
Kevin Enright and Schweitzer
accounted for half of the team's
28 points during this period.
However, just as they appeared
to control the game, Stanford

EEB^ESS*!

turned cold on their outside shots
and the Pioneers scored nine
points in the last two minutes of
the half to take a 32-28 lead.
After being outscored 10-4 at
the start of the second half, the
Cards came back on Rich
Whohlstadter's passes and
Schweitzer's shooting to trail by
four, 43-47 at the 11:47 mark.
Rompel contributed two crucial
steals during the rally, but when
he had to leave the game with an
apparent eye injury minutes later,
Stanford gave up six straight
points and lost their momentum.
