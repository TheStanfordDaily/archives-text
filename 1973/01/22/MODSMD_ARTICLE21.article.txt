# Golfers Stunned By Alumni
## 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
Experience triumphed over
youth Saturday as Stanford's
alumni golfers scored a surprising
58-50 victory over the varsity on
the Stanford course.
Before the match Chuck Van
Linge, who organized the alumni
team, said that he hoped "to give
the varsity some good
competition before the regular
season started."
It turned out that the grads
provided more than just "good
competition." Nine of the 12
alumni players broke 80, led by
Kent Winton with a two over par
73. Alumni players prevailed in
seven of the 12 individual matches
and three of the six best ball
contests for their narrow eight
point victory.
Sophomore Aly Trompas
edged Winton for medalist honors,
firing a 72 in his match against
1941 NCAA champion Sandy
Tatum, who shot 79. Trompas,
the 1969 U.S. Junior champion,
seems to have his game in top
shape after a disappointing
freshman season. His 72 Saturday
followed two consecutive 71's in
qualifying rounds for the team.

Eight of the 12 individual
matches were decided by three
strokes or less and several went
down to the final green. Some of
the best matches included
sophomore Dave Baskins' 73-74
victory over Bob Cardinal,
Winton's 73-75 win over
sophomore Conrad Nilmeier, Bob
Ireland's 77-78 victory over
sophomore Bob Chapman, and
Van Linge's 79-81 triumph over
freshman Bob Conway.
In what was probably the best
match of the afternoon, 49er
quarterback John Brodie lost by a
shot to sophomore Bruce
Robertson. A relaxed Brodie, who
didn't have to worry about 260
pound defensive linemen for the
first time in six months, shot an
impressive four over par 75 but
Robertson managed 74.
In another interesting battle,
senior Denny Colvin fired a 73 in
his nine stroke victory over
Stanford coach Bud Finger.
Finger had the most confused
reaction to the match, playing on
the winning alumni team and
coaching the losing varsity.
Stanford won't play again until

Feb. 2 when the Cards host San
Francisco State and Santa Clara in
an 18 hole tournament. Stanford's
freshman team will open its
season on Feb. 1 against Foothill
College at Palo Alto Hills Country
Club.
