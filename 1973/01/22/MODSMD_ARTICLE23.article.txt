N.Y. Gunmen Surrender; Hostages Escape
NEW YORK — Four heavily armed black Muslims who had vowed a fight to the
death surrendered to police yesterday four hours after their nine hostages had
made a dramatic escape.
The surrender ended a 47-hour siege of a Brooklyn sporting goods store that
had provided the gunmen with a virtual arsenal of firepower.
One patrolman was shot dead in a bloody confrontation with the four young
holdupmen at the outset of the prolonged police vigil Friday night. Two others
were wounded, one critically.
One of the gunmen, critically wounded with a bullet in his abdomen, was
carried out of John and Al's Sports Inc. by two confederates. The third walked
alongside the stretcher.
The hostages had escaped to freedom shortly before 1 p.m., police said. The
seven men and two women scrambled up a hidden stairwell after their captors
were diverted to the roof by what they thought were police officers preparing to
launch an assault. The hostages fled to an adjoining roof while the gunmen and
police exchanged shots.
Saigon Captures Enemy Report
SAIGON — Senior South Vietnamese officials said today a captured Communist
high command document puts the time for initialing a Vietnam cease-fire
agreement at 9 p.m. Wednesday Saigon time — 8 a.m. EST.
They quoted the document as saying the agreement would be initialed in
Paris, signed there Saturday and the cease-fire would take effect on Sunday.
Henry A. Kissinger and North Vietnam's Le Due Tho resume their secret
negotiations in Paris tomorrow.
The document was issued in the name of the Central Office for South
Vietnam — COSVN — for the purpose of informing North Vietnamese and Viet
Cong troops of the impending accord, the officials said. COSVN is the
Communist command's military and political headquarters for the southern half
of South Vietnam.
Time' Reports Watergate Bribe
NEW YORK — Time magazine yesterday reported it has learned that former
White House consultant E. Howard Hunt Jr. talked four other Watergate
defendants into pleading guilty and offered them $1,000 a month apiece for
each month they spend in jail.
The magazine said the four were recruited last year by Hunt to bug the
Democratic party headquarters in Washington with the urging: "It's got to be
done. My friend [Charles Colson] wants it. John Mitchell wants it."
Hunt could not be reached for comment. But his lawyer, William 0. Bittman,
said Hunt "categorically and emphatically denies ever making that statement or
any similar statement. lie is outraged that Time magazine would attribute such a
statement to him which is absolutely false — not only false factually but false in
that he absolutely did not mention it or anything similar to that to David
Beckwith of Time."
Kissinger To Finalize Accord
WASHINGTON — President Nixon is sending Vietnam negotiator Henry A.
Kissinger back to Paris today with a goal of wrapping up a peace settlement
before the end of the week, sources indicated Sunday.
But administration officials discounted as speculation reports that the
President has told Kissinger to initial the agreement on Thursday.
Nixon conferred twice yesterday with Kissinger and Gen. Alexander M. Haig,
who returned at midday from conferences with South Vietnamese President
Nguyen Van Thieu and leaders of four other Asian countries.
It was reported earlier from Saigon that Thieu had told Haig he accepts the
basic provisions of a tentative peace accord negotiated by Kissinger and Hanoi
Politburo member Le Due Tho.

Time' Reports Watergate Bribe
NEW YORK — Time magazine yesterday reported it has learned that former
White House consultant E. Howard Hunt Jr. talked four other Watergate
defendants into pleading guilty and offered them $1,000 a month apiece for
each month they spend in jail.
The magazine said the four were recruited last year by Hunt to bug the
Democratic party headquarters in Washington with the urging: "It's got to be
done. My friend [Charles Colson] wants it. John Mitchell wants it."
Hunt could not be reached for comment. But his lawyer, William 0. Bittman,
said Hunt "categorically and emphatically denies ever making that statement or
any similar statement. lie is outraged that Time magazine would attribute such a
statement to him which is absolutely false — not only false factually but false in
that he absolutely did not mention it or anything similar to that to David
Beckwith of Time."
Kissinger To Finalize Accord
WASHINGTON — President Nixon is sending Vietnam negotiator Henry A.
Kissinger back to Paris today with a goal of wrapping up a peace settlement
before the end of the week, sources indicated Sunday.
But administration officials discounted as speculation reports that the
President has told Kissinger to initial the agreement on Thursday.
Nixon conferred twice yesterday with Kissinger and Gen. Alexander M. Haig,
who returned at midday from conferences with South Vietnamese President
Nguyen Van Thieu and leaders of four other Asian countries.
It was reported earlier from Saigon that Thieu had told Haig he accepts the
basic provisions of a tentative peace accord negotiated by Kissinger and Hanoi
Politburo member Le Due Tho.

N.Y. Gunmen Surrender; Hostages Escape
NEW YORK — Four heavily armed black Muslims who had vowed a fight to the
death surrendered to police yesterday four hours after their nine hostages had
made a dramatic escape.
The surrender ended a 47-hour siege of a Brooklyn sporting goods store that
had provided the gunmen with a virtual arsenal of firepower.
One patrolman was shot dead in a bloody confrontation with the four young
holdupmen at the outset of the prolonged police vigil Friday night. Two others
were wounded, one critically.
One of the gunmen, critically wounded with a bullet in his abdomen, was
carried out of John and Al's Sports Inc. by two confederates. The third walked
alongside the stretcher.
The hostages had escaped to freedom shortly before 1 p.m., police said. The
seven men and two women scrambled up a hidden stairwell after their captors
were diverted to the roof by what they thought were police officers preparing to
launch an assault. The hostages fled to an adjoining roof while the gunmen and
police exchanged shots.
