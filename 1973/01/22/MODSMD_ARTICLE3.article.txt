# Competitive Atmosphere Encourages 'Psychological War' Among Premeds
## 
### TERRY ANZUR 
A marked increase in applications
to medical schools is exerting pressure
and promoting competition among
premedical students in the fight to
gain admission to the highly selective
schools.
Nationally, some 35,000 students
competed for an estimated 13,000
openings in medical schools
throughout the country in 1972. The
Stanford Medical School alone
rejected 43 applicants for each one it
accepted and expects to receive 5000
applications for about 85 places for
the fall of 1974.

Dr. Henry Jones, faculty
coordinator for premed advising says,
"Competition is such that a 4.0
student may not get in at the top
schools." And, due to a decline of job
opportunities and graduate fellowships
in chemistry and engineering, and
increased interest of entering freshmen
in the biological sciences, the number
of premeds is on the increase.
Last week, officials in the
premedical program at the University
of California at Berkeley complained
that the highly competitive
atmosphere has encouraged student
cheating and sabotage in premed
courses.
Premed Pressure
Premeds at Stanford feel the same
kind of pressure. Some 1089 students
are officially classified as "premed"
but many others have indicated
interest by asking for the premed
handbook in the Academic
Information Center. Over half of this
year's freshmen are enrolled in General
Chemistry, a recommended course for
prospective premeds.
Part of the problem for the med
school applicant is that most schools
don't spell out the content of
undergraduate courses. Stanford
recommends a core program of five
quarters of general and organic
chemistry, three quarters of physics,
four quarters of biology or human
biology, and optional courses in

calculus, embryology, and vertebrate
biology.
Both students and faculty complain
about the lengthy core requirements,
says Jones, "but it is pared down as
low as possible to provide an adequate
background for medical school."
Premeds must not only complete
requirements but must earn a near-4.0
grade average in the basic courses.
"Every premed student complains
about the pressure," commented
Jones. The only way to stand out in
such a large crowd is to get good
grades in core courses, he noted.
According to students, the fierce
competition in large classes creates
"psychological warfare" among them.
"It's not just cheating," remarked one
senior premed. "Students have an
inhumane attitude towards each other
which is unfortunate because they're
going into such a humane profession."
Sabotage Noted
One student recalls several incidents
of "sabotage" in premed classes. Class
notes are stolen from labs, and
students get through labs by
"borrowing" the notes of others, or
"drylabbing" â€” faking the results of
an experiment on paper. Some
students obtain better lab products by
"making friends with the TA's and
using the labs on off hours," or
increase their graded lab output by
secretly increasing their input of
chemicals.

Students report that last quarter's
bomb scares afforded an opportunity
for "massive cheating" on exams.
When bomb threats were phoned in
against buildings where biology and
chemistry exams were being held last
Oct. 23, Oct. 24, and Nov. 16,
students collected in small groups
outside to help each other with the
exams.
No bombs were found in any of the
threatened buildings. Organic
Chemistry Prof. Harry Mosher says the
threats may have come from
"Students who overslept and couldn't
make the exam."
Honor Code Violations
In another incident last winter
quarter, a professor assigned a
make-up midterm for members of a
chemistry class who had scored poorly
on the original exam. He stipulated
that the students use no books and
spend no more than two hours on the
problems. Almost all students returned
near-perfect papers, some spending up
to ten hours on the test and obtaining
help from friends and textbooks. The
prof decided not to count the test
results for grading.
Jones said he has heard complaints
of cheating and sabotage, but added
that such incidents are difficult to
document. "The honor system
requires that it be reported through
the proper channels," he stated.
According to the president of the
UC Berkeley Medical Society, students
there are unhappy with the chicanery
because they envision the behavior of
prospective physicians as totally
different. "I can almost document
evidence that the work of students in
some science labs has been sabotaged
by other students," he said.
Stanford students are also
dissatisfied with the situation. "What
goes on is not so much physical
sabotaging as psychological," one
student noted. "When people get
together, the talk is generally about
the pressures."
Premeds tend to form cliques of
five or six people. Within the group
students report "a tremendous amount
of pressure to help your friends get
through." However, people try to
discourage non-group members by
refusing to answer questions or
deliberately giving misleading answers
to their competitors.
Elimination Process
Many students feel there is a
conscious attempt by professors in
core courses to "weed out" students
by severe grading curves. According to
Mosher, grading depends on the
individual professors' standards; there
are no quotas or standard curves.
Associate Anatomy Prof. Donald
Stillwell says students eliminate
themselves from the premed program.
"Lots of people start chemistry and
find out it's not for them," he
explained.
Increasing numbers of med school
aspirants also place pressure on
universities to expand facilities,

particularly laboratories. Chemistry
lab space here has tripled in three
years. "If the students want a course,
we'll find some way to give it,"
asserted Mosher. "No one will be cut
out because they can't get into
classes."
