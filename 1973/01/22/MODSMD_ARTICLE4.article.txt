# Is Nixon Reducing Inflation?
## Profs Evaluate Nixon's Economic Policies 
### BILL WEINSTEIN 
How effective have President
Richard M. Nixon's economic policies
been? The Daily asked seven
economics professors for their views
on this question and received a variety
of responses.
The President recently announced
Phase 111 of his economic game plan
by lifting his controversial wage and
price controls for all items except food
and health care.
Abolishing the Price Commission
and Pay Board, Nixon placed his faith
in voluntary efforts on the part of
labor and business to hold down wage
and price increases and stop inflation.
One of his main goals is the reduction
of the nation's inflation rate to two
and one-half percent.
"The inflation spiral has been
stopped," said Asst. Prof. Hayne

Leland, but he added that the controls
were "worrisome in that they led to a
misallocation of resources."
Leland added that he felt the
policies "have been more effective
than I would have thought."
Expansionary Expenditures
Prof. John Gurley and Asst. Prof.
Lawrence Lau also considered the
wage and price controls "reasonably
effective." Lau called Nixon's
expenditure policy expansionary and
pointed out that "Nixon is willing to
live with more unemployment and less
inflation."
While agreeing Nixonomics was
successful, Gurley claimed that the
goal of the President's economic
programs was to raise corporate profits
— not to stabilize prices or reduce
unemployment.
"The ultimate and overriding

objective of all capitalist government is
the preservation and strengthening of
capitalism. In our own economy this
means that successive administrations,
above all else, have looked out for the
welfare of business corporations,"
Gurley said.
Little Effect
In contrast, Prof. Richard Muth
claimed that Nixonomics "has had
relatively little effect." Citing the four
percent inflation rate before the
controls were instituted, Muth noted
that the rate after Phases I and II was
still three and one-half percent; not a
noticeable change.
Muth considered the controls
psychologically beneficial to the
country. "The actions people take
depend on what they think about the
future," he said.
The urban economist added that

Phases I and 11, intended to combat
inflation, were brash and unnecessary.
Questions Motives
Asst. Prof. John Pencavel said
"There has been no appreciable
difference" in inflation rates before or
after the controls. Criticizing the
voluntary controls as easy to evade, he
questioned Americans' motives for
obeying the voluntary guidelines set
by the President.
"I don't think people do submerge
individual interests for some ill-defined
common good. Thank God, they don't
take these sorts of exaltations very
seriously during peacetime," Pencavel
said.
Prof. Edward S. Shaw insisted that
"the faster Nixon takes off the
controls, the better." Claiming that
the price controls were of "little
value," Shaw said the "dreadful"
monetary policies of the government
were at the root of inflation.
Too Much Money Issued
Shaw zeroed in on the Federal
Reserve System (FRS) as a major
cause of inflation. He pointed out that
by buying up government bonds issued
to rectify a budget deficit, the FRS
was then forced to issue too much
money too fast.
This extra money then became less
valuable because of an excess supply
which in turn forced inflation higher.
As Shaw put it, "too much money is

chasing too few goods." The
economist advocated doing away with
all controls immediately and cutting
back on the FRS's issuance of money.
Acting Asst. Prof. John Scadding
agreed with Shaw and considered
Nixon's game plan "poor, because I
think there has been a confusion
between the causes and symptoms of
inflation." He described Nixonomics
as "cosmetic," and recommended that
the FRS decrease its issuance of
money from 14 percent to five percent
per annum.
All Favor Devaluation
All the professors favored the 1971

devaluation of the dollar. Lau called
the devaluation "quite effective — it
should have been devalued more."
Muth expanded on this idea, saying
"I would like to see the dollar float
free," while Leland carried it a step
further by advocating "floating
exchange rates."
Gurley attributed the devaluation
to the protection of corporate
interests. He said that "a shift is being
implemented by a new international
policy that is intended to change
relative trade and investment barriers,
and relative defense burdens in favor
of the U.S. capitalist class."
Unwilling To Predict
Many of the professors were
unwilling to predict future economic
trends. Muth stated "I wouldn't want
to try to read Nixon's mind."
Lau was optimistic about the future
whereas Shaw predicted a recession by
1974 if the FRS refused to cut back
on the rate of increase in the money
supply.
Leland concluded by saying,
"President Nixon is against controls
but he has seen the success of them in
relieving the situation. I predict a
return to controls."

voluntary controls as easy to evade, he
questioned Americans' motives for
obeying the voluntary guidelines set
by the President.
"I don't think people do submerge
individual interests for some ill-defined
common good. Thank God, they don't
take these sorts of exaltations very
seriously during peacetime," Pencavel
said.
Prof. Edward S. Shaw insisted that
"the faster Nixon takes off the
controls, the better." Claiming that
the price controls were of "little
value," Shaw said the "dreadful"
monetary policies of the government
were at the root of inflation.
Too Much Money Issued
Shaw zeroed in on the Federal
Reserve System (FRS) as a major
cause of inflation. He pointed out that
by buying up government bonds issued
to rectify a budget deficit, the FRS
was then forced to issue too much
money too fast.
This extra money then became less
valuable because of an excess supply
which in turn forced inflation higher.
As Shaw put it, "too much money is

chasing too few goods." The
economist advocated doing away with
all controls immediately and cutting
back on the FRS's issuance of money.
Acting Asst. Prof. John Scadding
agreed with Shaw and considered
Nixon's game plan "poor, because I
think there has been a confusion
between the causes and symptoms of
inflation." He described Nixonomics
as "cosmetic," and recommended that
the FRS decrease its issuance of
money from 14 percent to five percent
per annum.
All Favor Devaluation
All the professors favored the 1971

devaluation of the dollar. Lau called
the devaluation "quite effective — it
should have been devalued more."
Muth expanded on this idea, saying
"I would like to see the dollar float
free," while Leland carried it a step
further by advocating "floating
exchange rates."
Gurley attributed the devaluation
to the protection of corporate
interests. He said that "a shift is being
implemented by a new international
policy that is intended to change
relative trade and investment barriers,
and relative defense burdens in favor
of the U.S. capitalist class."
Unwilling To Predict
Many of the professors were
unwilling to predict future economic
trends. Muth stated "I wouldn't want
to try to read Nixon's mind."
Lau was optimistic about the future
whereas Shaw predicted a recession by
1974 if the FRS refused to cut back
on the rate of increase in the money
supply.
Leland concluded by saying,
"President Nixon is against controls
but he has seen the success of them in
relieving the situation. I predict a
return to controls."
How effective have President
Richard M. Nixon's economic policies
been? The Daily asked seven
economics professors for their views
on this question and received a variety
of responses.
The President recently announced
Phase 111 of his economic game plan
by lifting his controversial wage and
price controls for all items except food
and health care.
Abolishing the Price Commission
and Pay Board, Nixon placed his faith
in voluntary efforts on the part of
labor and business to hold down wage
and price increases and stop inflation.
One of his main goals is the reduction
of the nation's inflation rate to two
and one-half percent.
"The inflation spiral has been
stopped," said Asst. Prof. Hayne

Leland, but he added that the controls
were "worrisome in that they led to a
misallocation of resources."
Leland added that he felt the
policies "have been more effective
than I would have thought."
Expansionary Expenditures
Prof. John Gurley and Asst. Prof.
Lawrence Lau also considered the
wage and price controls "reasonably
effective." Lau called Nixon's
expenditure policy expansionary and
pointed out that "Nixon is willing to
live with more unemployment and less
inflation."
While agreeing Nixonomics was
successful, Gurley claimed that the
goal of the President's economic
programs was to raise corporate profits
— not to stabilize prices or reduce
unemployment.
"The ultimate and overriding

objective of all capitalist government is
the preservation and strengthening of
capitalism. In our own economy this
means that successive administrations,
above all else, have looked out for the
welfare of business corporations,"
Gurley said.
Little Effect
In contrast, Prof. Richard Muth
claimed that Nixonomics "has had
relatively little effect." Citing the four
percent inflation rate before the
controls were instituted, Muth noted
that the rate after Phases I and II was
still three and one-half percent; not a
noticeable change.
Muth considered the controls
psychologically beneficial to the
country. "The actions people take
depend on what they think about the
future," he said.
The urban economist added that

Phases I and 11, intended to combat
inflation, were brash and unnecessary.

on the rate of increase in the money
supply.
Leland concluded by saying,
"President Nixon is against controls
but he has seen the success of them in
relieving the situation. I predict a
return to controls."
How effective have President
Richard M. Nixon's economic policies
been? The Daily asked seven
economics professors for their views
on this question and received a variety
of responses.
The President recently announced
Phase 111 of his economic game plan
by lifting his controversial wage and
price controls for all items except food
and health care.
Abolishing the Price Commission
and Pay Board, Nixon placed his faith
in voluntary efforts on the part of
labor and business to hold down wage
and price increases and stop inflation.
One of his main goals is the reduction
of the nation's inflation rate to two
and one-half percent.
"The inflation spiral has been
stopped," said Asst. Prof. Hayne

Leland, but he added that the controls
were "worrisome in that they led to a
misallocation of resources."
Leland added that he felt the
policies "have been more effective
than I would have thought."
Expansionary Expenditures
Prof. John Gurley and Asst. Prof.
Lawrence Lau also considered the
wage and price controls "reasonably
effective." Lau called Nixon's
expenditure policy expansionary and
pointed out that "Nixon is willing to
live with more unemployment and less
inflation."
While agreeing Nixonomics was
successful, Gurley claimed that the
goal of the President's economic
programs was to raise corporate profits
— not to stabilize prices or reduce
unemployment.
"The ultimate and overriding

objective of all capitalist government is
the preservation and strengthening of
capitalism. In our own economy this
means that successive administrations,
above all else, have looked out for the
welfare of business corporations,"
Gurley said.
Little Effect
In contrast, Prof. Richard Muth
claimed that Nixonomics "has had
relatively little effect." Citing the four
percent inflation rate before the
controls were instituted, Muth noted
that the rate after Phases I and II was
still three and one-half percent; not a
noticeable change.
Muth considered the controls
psychologically beneficial to the
country. "The actions people take
depend on what they think about the
future," he said.
The urban economist added that

Phases I and 11, intended to combat
inflation, were brash and unnecessary.
Questions Motives
Asst. Prof. John Pencavel said
"There has been no appreciable
difference" in inflation rates before or
after the controls. Criticizing the
voluntary controls as easy to evade, he
questioned Americans' motives for
obeying the voluntary guidelines set
by the President.
"I don't think people do submerge
individual interests for some ill-defined
common good. Thank God, they don't
take these sorts of exaltations very
seriously during peacetime," Pencavel
said.
Prof. Edward S. Shaw insisted that
"the faster Nixon takes off the
controls, the better." Claiming that
the price controls were of "little
value," Shaw said the "dreadful"
monetary policies of the government
were at the root of inflation.
Too Much Money Issued
Shaw zeroed in on the Federal
Reserve System (FRS) as a major
cause of inflation. He pointed out that
by buying up government bonds issued
to rectify a budget deficit, the FRS
was then forced to issue too much
money too fast.
This extra money then became less
valuable because of an excess supply
which in turn forced inflation higher.
As Shaw put it, "too much money is

chasing too few goods." The
economist advocated doing away with
all controls immediately and cutting
back on the FRS's issuance of money.
Acting Asst. Prof. John Scadding
agreed with Shaw and considered
Nixon's game plan "poor, because I
think there has been a confusion
between the causes and symptoms of
inflation." He described Nixonomics
as "cosmetic," and recommended that
the FRS decrease its issuance of
money from 14 percent to five percent
per annum.
All Favor Devaluation
All the professors favored the 1971

devaluation of the dollar. Lau called
the devaluation "quite effective — it
should have been devalued more."
Muth expanded on this idea, saying
"I would like to see the dollar float
free," while Leland carried it a step
further by advocating "floating
exchange rates."
Gurley attributed the devaluation
to the protection of corporate
interests. He said that "a shift is being
implemented by a new international
policy that is intended to change
relative trade and investment barriers,
and relative defense burdens in favor
of the U.S. capitalist class."
Unwilling To Predict
Many of the professors were
unwilling to predict future economic
trends. Muth stated "I wouldn't want
to try to read Nixon's mind."
Lau was optimistic about the future
whereas Shaw predicted a recession by
1974 if the FRS refused to cut back
on the rate of increase in the money
supply.
Leland concluded by saying,
"President Nixon is against controls
but he has seen the success of them in
relieving the situation. I predict a
return to controls."
