# Dean Discusses Campus Attitudes
## 
### CHRIS KENRICK 
"People always used to tell me that Stanford was
a super liberal kind of institution, but I think there's
an interesting range here over the entire political
spectrum, and this I regard as a good thing,"
explains James Lyons, Dean of Student Affairs since
last July.
"But I wonder whether there isn't a lot of
stereotyping at Stanford which isn't very helpful in
trying to understand people and how they should
get along."
Lyons, who served as dean of students at
Haverford College in Pennsylvania for ten years
before coming to Stanford, reflected on some
problems facing the University. Lyons generally
discussed minority affairs on campus, student
political activity, and his own role as dean. He then
elaborated on specific programs in residence
planning, counseling, and campus affairs.
"I don't think there is a very high sensitivity at
Stanford to some of the individual differences that
add up to a non-useful generalization — minority
groups," Lyons said. "Here, in contrast to smaller
institutions, there's a greater diversity among
students; and this is as true for several minority
groups as it is for the student body as a whole.
Avoids Stereotyping
"So it doesn't make much sense to say 'women
feel such and such.' On these matters I just try to
listen very carefully, to hear, to understand, to
avoid stereotyping."
Lyons hesitated to compare political awareness
at Stanford with that on campuses elsewhere
because "political activity is way down
everywhere." His "hunch" is that students in the
past four or five years may not have had much more
political concern than students before. "For many
students, political activity served more of a social or

even a spiritual need than any real commitment," he
said.
Political Involvement
Lyons noted a conflict in his own ideas on the
appropriateness of campus political involvement.
"One part of me says its good and right for students
to be concerned, so I'd hope for a fair amount of
political action," he remarked.
"Another part of me says that maybe its good
for students to experience four years relatively free
of those kinds of concerns, to limit their concern to
a microcosm, and to experiment with Utopian
situations on the campus."
The forty year-old dean sees his major role as
that of a "teacher without a classroom."
According to Lyons, the student affairs office
intends to bridge the gap between the academic and
non-academic aspects of student life.
Major Transition
"Coming to Stanford is a major transition in
anyone's life, and it's important for every student to
establish himself in some friendship group as
quickly as possible," he said.
Lyons discussed current top-priority issues in the
student affairs office and reviewed his
accomplishments in the last six months.
The office is now investigating the institution of
legal counseling for students. Lyons noted that
many students living off-campus have encountered
landlord-tenant contractual problems, and that
newly married students frequently need advice on
consumer law.
Also in the counseling area is a current
consideration of possible couples counseling for
married students.
New Trend
Lyons predicted a substantial revamping of the
Career Planning and Placement Office. "We're quite

concerned about the possible trend of a greater
number of students not going on to graduate or
professional schools. This will place a greater
demand on the placement office."
"We're also very concerned about the increasing
cost of Stanford and how that will affect the
placement office as far as demands for off-campus
employment, summer jobs, and quarter-off
opportunities," Lyons said. "We're considering
getting some part time staff who would mostly be
located in San Francisco and Los Angeles to find
jobs for students."
Learns To Be Honest
"I think universities have learned a lot with
regard to student affairs in the past few years,"
Lyons concluded. "In particular, I think we've
learned to be more honest.
"Take the rules intended to separate men and
women — they seemed to protect women from men.
They were probably originally designed to minimize
sexual activity among students. But they were rarely
couched on those terms.
"Universities claimed that that's what parents
wanted — which worked until we asked the parents.
It turned out the colleges were far more protective
than parents ever were.
"So the universities tried to keep student sexual
activity to a minimum, while claiming that the
purpose of parietal rules was to simplify student
study schedules, or to hold down the attrition rate.
"We weren't being honest. We saw that sexual
activity was going on, but we couldn't recognize it
because by definition it wasn't supposed to be
happening. And so we couldn't deal with any of its
consequences — unwanted pregnancies or abortions.
"We were a little more responsive when the drug
phenomenon came along. We can now talk about it,
above the table, so to speak."

quickly as possible," he said.
Lyons discussed current top-priority issues in the
student affairs office and reviewed his
accomplishments in the last six months.
The office is now investigating the institution of
legal counseling for students. Lyons noted that
many students living off-campus have encountered
landlord-tenant contractual problems, and that
newly married students frequently need advice on
consumer law.
Also in the counseling area is a current
consideration of possible couples counseling for
married students.
New Trend
Lyons predicted a substantial revamping of the
Career Planning and Placement Office. "We're quite

concerned about the possible trend of a greater
number of students not going on to graduate or
professional schools. This will place a greater
demand on the placement office."
"We're also very concerned about the increasing
cost of Stanford and how that will affect the
placement office as far as demands for off-campus
employment, summer jobs, and quarter-off
opportunities," Lyons said. "We're considering
getting some part time staff who would mostly be
located in San Francisco and Los Angeles to find
jobs for students."
Learns To Be Honest
"I think universities have learned a lot with
regard to student affairs in the past few years,"
Lyons concluded. "In particular, I think we've
learned to be more honest.
"Take the rules intended to separate men and
women — they seemed to protect women from men.
They were probably originally designed to minimize
sexual activity among students. But they were rarely
couched on those terms.
"Universities claimed that that's what parents
wanted — which worked until we asked the parents.
It turned out the colleges were far more protective
than parents ever were.
"So the universities tried to keep student sexual
activity to a minimum, while claiming that the
purpose of parietal rules was to simplify student
study schedules, or to hold down the attrition rate.
"We weren't being honest. We saw that sexual
activity was going on, but we couldn't recognize it
because by definition it wasn't supposed to be
happening. And so we couldn't deal with any of its
consequences — unwanted pregnancies or abortions.
"We were a little more responsive when the drug
phenomenon came along. We can now talk about it,
above the table, so to speak."

LIKES DIVERSITY — James Lyons, Dean of Student Affairs since July, has
been particularly impressed by the wide range of views on campus. However, he
warns against stereotyping, saying that it is not useful in helping people
understand one another.
"People always used to tell me that Stanford was
a super liberal kind of institution, but I think there's
an interesting range here over the entire political
spectrum, and this I regard as a good thing,"
explains James Lyons, Dean of Student Affairs since
last July.
"But I wonder whether there isn't a lot of
stereotyping at Stanford which isn't very helpful in
trying to understand people and how they should
get along."
Lyons, who served as dean of students at
Haverford College in Pennsylvania for ten years
before coming to Stanford, reflected on some
problems facing the University. Lyons generally
discussed minority affairs on campus, student
political activity, and his own role as dean. He then
elaborated on specific programs in residence
planning, counseling, and campus affairs.
"I don't think there is a very high sensitivity at
Stanford to some of the individual differences that
add up to a non-useful generalization — minority
groups," Lyons said. "Here, in contrast to smaller
institutions, there's a greater diversity among
students; and this is as true for several minority
groups as it is for the student body as a whole.
Avoids Stereotyping
"So it doesn't make much sense to say 'women
feel such and such.' On these matters I just try to
listen very carefully, to hear, to understand, to
avoid stereotyping."
Lyons hesitated to compare political awareness
at Stanford with that on campuses elsewhere
because "political activity is way down
everywhere." His "hunch" is that students in the
past four or five years may not have had much more
political concern than students before. "For many
students, political activity served more of a social or

even a spiritual need than any real commitment," he
said.
Political Involvement
Lyons noted a conflict in his own ideas on the
appropriateness of campus political involvement.
"One part of me says its good and right for students
to be concerned, so I'd hope for a fair amount of
political action," he remarked.
"Another part of me says that maybe its good
for students to experience four years relatively free
of those kinds of concerns, to limit their concern to
a microcosm, and to experiment with Utopian
situations on the campus."
The forty year-old dean sees his major role as
that of a "teacher without a classroom."
According to Lyons, the student affairs office
intends to bridge the gap between the academic and
non-academic aspects of student life.
Major Transition
"Coming to Stanford is a major transition in
anyone's life, and it's important for every student to
establish himself in some friendship group as
quickly as possible," he said.

a super liberal kind of institution, but I think there's
an interesting range here over the entire political
spectrum, and this I regard as a good thing,"
explains James Lyons, Dean of Student Affairs since
last July.
"But I wonder whether there isn't a lot of
stereotyping at Stanford which isn't very helpful in
trying to understand people and how they should
get along."
Lyons, who served as dean of students at
Haverford College in Pennsylvania for ten years
before coming to Stanford, reflected on some
problems facing the University. Lyons generally
discussed minority affairs on campus, student
political activity, and his own role as dean. He then
elaborated on specific programs in residence
planning, counseling, and campus affairs.
"I don't think there is a very high sensitivity at
Stanford to some of the individual differences that
add up to a non-useful generalization — minority
groups," Lyons said. "Here, in contrast to smaller
institutions, there's a greater diversity among
students; and this is as true for several minority
groups as it is for the student body as a whole.
Avoids Stereotyping
"So it doesn't make much sense to say 'women
feel such and such.' On these matters I just try to
listen very carefully, to hear, to understand, to
avoid stereotyping."
Lyons hesitated to compare political awareness
at Stanford with that on campuses elsewhere
because "political activity is way down
everywhere." His "hunch" is that students in the
past four or five years may not have had much more
political concern than students before. "For many
students, political activity served more of a social or

even a spiritual need than any real commitment," he
said.
Political Involvement
Lyons noted a conflict in his own ideas on the
appropriateness of campus political involvement.
"One part of me says its good and right for students
to be concerned, so I'd hope for a fair amount of
political action," he remarked.
"Another part of me says that maybe its good
for students to experience four years relatively free
of those kinds of concerns, to limit their concern to
a microcosm, and to experiment with Utopian
situations on the campus."
The forty year-old dean sees his major role as
that of a "teacher without a classroom."
According to Lyons, the student affairs office
intends to bridge the gap between the academic and
non-academic aspects of student life.
Major Transition
"Coming to Stanford is a major transition in
anyone's life, and it's important for every student to
establish himself in some friendship group as
quickly as possible," he said.
Lyons discussed current top-priority issues in the
student affairs office and reviewed his
accomplishments in the last six months.
The office is now investigating the institution of
legal counseling for students. Lyons noted that
many students living off-campus have encountered
landlord-tenant contractual problems, and that
newly married students frequently need advice on
consumer law.
Also in the counseling area is a current
consideration of possible couples counseling for
married students.
New Trend
Lyons predicted a substantial revamping of the
Career Planning and Placement Office. "We're quite

concerned about the possible trend of a greater
number of students not going on to graduate or
professional schools. This will place a greater
demand on the placement office."
"We're also very concerned about the increasing
cost of Stanford and how that will affect the
placement office as far as demands for off-campus
employment, summer jobs, and quarter-off
opportunities," Lyons said. "We're considering
getting some part time staff who would mostly be
located in San Francisco and Los Angeles to find
jobs for students."
Learns To Be Honest
"I think universities have learned a lot with
regard to student affairs in the past few years,"
Lyons concluded. "In particular, I think we've
learned to be more honest.
"Take the rules intended to separate men and
women — they seemed to protect women from men.
They were probably originally designed to minimize
sexual activity among students. But they were rarely
couched on those terms.
"Universities claimed that that's what parents
wanted — which worked until we asked the parents.
It turned out the colleges were far more protective
than parents ever were.
"So the universities tried to keep student sexual
activity to a minimum, while claiming that the
purpose of parietal rules was to simplify student
study schedules, or to hold down the attrition rate.
"We weren't being honest. We saw that sexual
activity was going on, but we couldn't recognize it
because by definition it wasn't supposed to be
happening. And so we couldn't deal with any of its
consequences — unwanted pregnancies or abortions.
"We were a little more responsive when the drug
phenomenon came along. We can now talk about it,
above the table, so to speak."

LIKES DIVERSITY — James Lyons, Dean of Student Affairs since July, has
been particularly impressed by the wide range of views on campus. However, he
warns against stereotyping, saying that it is not useful in helping people
understand one another.
