## Traffic Problems 
### 
As new construction continues at a steady rate, the parking and
traffic problems on this campus are becoming more and more serious.
Most people have finally recognized these problems which have
existed for a long time primarily because of insufficient planning and
improper maintenance.
Typical of the poor planning is the situation created by the
construction of the new Law School. This construction eliminated
200 parking spaces and the Planning Office recommended that a new
lot be constructed in an area bordered by Alvarado Row, Lane A and
the new Law School. Unfortunately that recommendation was turned
down by administrators and what was already a bad parking situation
has now become critical.
The University is trying to implement an interim situation
involving better utilization of the Stern and Wilbur lots, but proper
planning would have made such a stopgap measure unnecessary.
As is usually the case, the Law School problem affects staff
members the most. Most students walk or use bicycles in the central
campus area arid there is not a critical shortage of spaces for
administrators and faculty members.
One immediate step should be taken to reduce this problem.
Parking regulations must be strictly enforced. Construction workers,
building maintenance men and VIP guests are currently allowed to
park almost anywhere. Special spaces should be designated on a
temporary basis for these people and no other exceptions to posted
regulations should be allowed.
The area around the new Law School also epitomizes another
major problem — poorly maintained roads. A Daily reader recently
described the roads in that vicinity as a "lunar rover test area"
complete with "craters" and we cannot quarrel with his description
which could apply to other campus locations as well.
The abnormal amount of rain this season has increased the
maintenance problem, but there have been enough dry days during
which the major potholes could have been filled. A lack of funds is
cited as the primary reason for many of these problems, but we feel
that the University must make solution of them a higher funding
priority.
In addition to stopgap measures including stricter enforcement of
parking regulations and more complete spot road maintenance, the
University must make some long-range plans to solve the problems.
All of the following suggestions have been raised previously, but we
feel they deserve to be repeated.
The University Parking and Traffic Committee recommended in
June 1972 that the University charge an annual registration fee for all
cars and that parking meters be installed at selected visitor parking
locations. The revenues gained from such a policy could help lessen
the funding shortages which have supposedly prevented effective
solution of these problems. We fully agree with the dieory that
automobile users should be taxed for parking on campus.
The University should strongly encourage car pools and use of
public transit facilities. The University should also continue to lobby
for more public transit and encourage greater use of bicycles to help
ease the automobile squeeze.
Whenever the University plans new construction, it should not
proceed with building until planners have determined what effect the
construction will have on parking and traffic and have taken steps to
avoid any problems in these areas.
We urge University officials to immediately enforce parking
regulations strictly and to earmark funds for proper road
maintenance. But the University must concurrently make long-range
plans to ease a situation which is growing worse every year.

We urge University officials to immediately enforce parking
regulations strictly and to earmark funds for proper road
maintenance. But the University must concurrently make long-range
plans to ease a situation which is growing worse every year.
As new construction continues at a steady rate, the parking and
traffic problems on this campus are becoming more and more serious.
Most people have finally recognized these problems which have
existed for a long time primarily because of insufficient planning and
improper maintenance.
Typical of the poor planning is the situation created by the
construction of the new Law School. This construction eliminated
200 parking spaces and the Planning Office recommended that a new
lot be constructed in an area bordered by Alvarado Row, Lane A and
the new Law School. Unfortunately that recommendation was turned
down by administrators and what was already a bad parking situation
has now become critical.
The University is trying to implement an interim situation
involving better utilization of the Stern and Wilbur lots, but proper
planning would have made such a stopgap measure unnecessary.
As is usually the case, the Law School problem affects staff
members the most. Most students walk or use bicycles in the central
campus area arid there is not a critical shortage of spaces for
administrators and faculty members.
One immediate step should be taken to reduce this problem.
Parking regulations must be strictly enforced. Construction workers,
building maintenance men and VIP guests are currently allowed to
park almost anywhere. Special spaces should be designated on a
temporary basis for these people and no other exceptions to posted
regulations should be allowed.
The area around the new Law School also epitomizes another
major problem — poorly maintained roads. A Daily reader recently
described the roads in that vicinity as a "lunar rover test area"
complete with "craters" and we cannot quarrel with his description
which could apply to other campus locations as well.
The abnormal amount of rain this season has increased the
maintenance problem, but there have been enough dry days during
which the major potholes could have been filled. A lack of funds is
cited as the primary reason for many of these problems, but we feel
that the University must make solution of them a higher funding
priority.
In addition to stopgap measures including stricter enforcement of
parking regulations and more complete spot road maintenance, the
University must make some long-range plans to solve the problems.
All of the following suggestions have been raised previously, but we
feel they deserve to be repeated.
The University Parking and Traffic Committee recommended in
June 1972 that the University charge an annual registration fee for all
cars and that parking meters be installed at selected visitor parking
locations. The revenues gained from such a policy could help lessen
the funding shortages which have supposedly prevented effective
solution of these problems. We fully agree with the dieory that
automobile users should be taxed for parking on campus.
The University should strongly encourage car pools and use of
public transit facilities. The University should also continue to lobby
for more public transit and encourage greater use of bicycles to help
ease the automobile squeeze.
Whenever the University plans new construction, it should not
proceed with building until planners have determined what effect the
construction will have on parking and traffic and have taken steps to
avoid any problems in these areas.
