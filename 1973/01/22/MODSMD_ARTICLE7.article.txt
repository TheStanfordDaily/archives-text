## Effect Of Tuition Squeeze' 
###

In 1953, Stanford's tuition was
$660 a year. Over the next ten
years, tuition rose 90 percent to
$1260. In Autumn, 1973, tuition
will be $3135, having risen 150
percent in the last decade. If the
present trend continues, and there
is every indication that it will,
next year's freshmen will pay
$4200 tuition for their senior
year.
As tuition passes the $3000
mark and starts soaring into the
wild blue yonder, the question
emerges: how will tuition rates
affect the composition of
Stanford's student body? Will
Stanford recapture its
country-club reputation from the
not too distant past? Will middle
class students, too poor to afford
tuition but too affluent to qualify
for financial aid, be squeezed out
of the University?
Stanford administrators claim
that any tuition increases are
having no serious effect on the
composition of each year's
freshman class. Budget director
Ray Bachetti says that of last
year's freshmen applicants who
were accepted by Stanford but
then went elsewhere, only 26
percent did so for financial
reasons. Bachetti believes that this
figure is not serious, and that it
shows the middle class is not
being forced out of Stanford.
Figures Misleading
Mr. Bachetti's 26 percent
figure is actually misleading for it
fails to include those people who
decided against Stanford before
they applied to colleges — people
who gave up on Stanford and
decided not to apply at all. In this
writer's high school class there
were a number of people who
wanted to attend Stanford, who
quite possibly could have gotten
in, but who never applied because
they thought thry couldn't afford
Stanford prices. That was when
tuition was $1000 less than it will
be next year!
Thousands of prospective
freshmen may be rejecting
Stanford for financial reasons

before they apply rather than
after. Unable to afford
exorbitant prices, they may give
up on Stanford rather than going
through the application process,
paying their application fee, and
then experiencing the
disappointment of having to say
no.
Though 26 percent of the
applicants who reject Stanford
after applying do so for financial
reasons, perhaps a much higher
percentage of those who reject
Stanford before applying do so
because of the tuition squeeze.
If the number of such students
is growing with tuition increases,
this is not accounted for in
university statistics. So long as
administrators remain unable to
measure this factor, they have no
reason for concluding that the
middle class is not being forced
out. Until they can show that
tuition raises have no effect on
the composition of the applicant
pool for the freshman class, their
claim regarding middle class
students remains unproved.
Transfers Ignored
The administration has also
ignored the effects of rising
tuition on transfer students.
"Financial aid for transfer
students is virtually non-existent,"
an admissions officer
acknowledges. Transfer students
are warned in their application
package that assistance will
probably not be granted even if
one can prove financial need.
While financial need cushions
some freshmen from rising
tuition, transfer students are
forced to rely on their parents. As
tuition rates leap towards infinity,
the only student who can afford
transferring to Stanford have
wealthy and upper income
families. Rising tuition rates
squeeze out transfer students
from middle and lower income
homes.
Clearly the administration's
contention that tuition increases
have no effect on the composition
of Stanford's student body is

doubtful. Until transfer students
receive financial assistance, and
until the University proves that
rising costs have no effect on the
freshman applicant pool, one can
only fear that spiraling tuition is
returning Stanford to the day
when the only important
admissions credential was one's
bank account.
