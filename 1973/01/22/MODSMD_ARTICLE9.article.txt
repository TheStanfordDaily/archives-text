# 'everyone's responsibility'
## 'Environmental Conscience'

About three years ago, when
ecology was in vogue, Stanford
began to step in line with the
times and developed an
"environmental conscience.An
"environmental conscience"
means you can still be wasteful
with scarce resources but you
should feel guilty about it.
To signal the new
consciousness, paint-box blue
banners and bumper stickers with
"Recycle and Re-use" branded in
snowflake white were plastered in
dorms and offices. Even Old
Union offices used them. An
Ecology House was formed,
presumably of those un
dergraduates with a clean-up
committee fetish, who would
serve as campus do-bees, buzzing
around and cleaning up after us.
In 1971, the "environmental
conscience" reached zenith. In a
rare moment of cross-cultural
actualization, the Athletic
Department said, "All right. We
will do out part. Freebees for

anyone who will recycle
aluminum Pepsi cans at football
games. And we'll throw in some
half-time announcements."
Ecology House
While the Athletic Department
didn't think up the plan, they did
help. But the organizing work
was done mostly by people at
Ecology House.
Taken with "environmental
consciousness" right before Big
Game, I volunteered to carry a
Hefty trash bag down the aisles
yelling, "Cans ... cans .. . any
cans"; by game's end I had
perfected the appeal so that it
sounded like Sir Olivier's
"Desdimona" speech in the movie
"Othello."
But not everyone in my aisles
had developed "environmental
conscience." Oh, they would
tolerate my pilgrimages during
quarter breaks. But if I hadn't
cleared out when the game
resumed,they would bellow forth
comments speculating about my
immediate ancestry. By game's
end, I looked like someone had
thrown a baloon filled with Pepsi
syrup at me.
Impressive Haul
. Nearly every student in my
section was very helpful. The
older people, however, left their
cans under their benches, maybe
to spite the effort. I finally left
the stadium at 5:30 p.m., after
rounding up hundreds of cans.
The final haul was impressive.
Who do these ecology freakos
think they are, anyway, running
out on us like that? Why,
everyone thought they liked doing
that sort of thing, you know,
recycling all those cans.
To let you in on a big secret,
recycling is not fun. It is not
pleasant, not easy, not
stimulating, not challenging. It is
drudgery, and like any benefit of

society, one has to work to
achieve it.
And it isn't the responsibility
of the members of Ecology House
to do the cleaning up, either. It's
everybody's.
Athletic Dept. Guilty
That everybody especially
includes the Athletic Department.
If they are going to allow soda
cans to be sold at games (and take
a cut of the profits) they should
provide for recycling of the
empties.
There are relatively simple
ways to achieve this. For example,
sell only bottled drinks. Or charge
a 25 cent deposit on cans, and see
the "environmental conscience"
bloom by game's end. They could
use the unredeemed deposits to
pay people to gather up the cans.
It comes down to this: If we
can 'Â£ afford to recycle soft drink
cans at games, then we can't
afford to sell them.
Self-Starters
The Athletic Department (or
any department with soft drink
machines, for that matter) should
not wait to be harassed into
recycling. They should want to be
self-starters: get the box, call the
supplier.
The Daily has been recycling
cans for several quarters. If this
bunch of professional buckpassers
can manage the difficult task of
stacking cans in a box and
arranging with the supplier to cart
away the box, anybody can.
Maybe the "environmental
conscience" of three years ago
will be revitalized. While we can
do without banner arid bumper
stickers, let's try to keep the
aluminum cans out of the trash
heap, and back into recycling
plants. (Daniel Brenner is a
