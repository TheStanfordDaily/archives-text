# Lyndon B. Johnson Dies At 64; Victim Of Sudden Heart Attack
## 
### MARK SIMONIAN 
Lyndon Baines Johnson, 36th
president of the United States, died
yesterday of a heart attack.
The 64-year-old former president,
who had a history of heart trouble
dating back to 1955, was stricken at
his ranch in Johnson City, Texas, and
pronounced dead at 1:43 p.m. PST at
San Antonio International Airport, a
spokesman said.
The spokesman, long-time LBJ aide
and press secretary Tom Johnson (no
relation), said that two Secret Service
agents assigned to the former president
found him lying on his back on his
bedroom floor.
President Johnson was flown by
private plane to San Antonio Airport,
about 65 miles from the LBJ ranch,
and then taken to Brooke Army
Medical Center, 10 miles from the
airport, by military helicopter
ambulance.
Lady Bird Johnson, working in her
office above the Johnson's television
station in Austin at the time her
husband was stricken, flew by
helicopter directly to the hospital. She
arrived shortly before her husband.
In Good Spirits
The press secretary quoted Mrs.
Johnson after her husband's death as
saying, "His health seemed no
different than it had been recently. He
seemed a bit quieter, but was in good
spirits."
She left the hospital around 3 p.m.
where she went into conference with
long-time friend of the family Jesse
Kellum, and Luci and Pat Nugent, her
daughter and son-in-law.
The Johnson's other daughter,
Lynda, and her husband, Charles
Robb, flew to Texas from their home
in Charlottesville, Va.
President Johnson's cardiologist,
Dr. George McGranahan, said the
cause of the death appeared to be
coronary thrombosis.
Autopsy Performed
An autopsy was performed at
Brooke General Hospital by Col. L.R.
Hieger, chief of pathology at Brooke.
The autopsy showed that Johnson had
severe coronary artery disease with
complete occlusion of two of three
major arterial supplies to the heart.
The third major artery was about
60 percent occluded. Complete results
of the autopsy will await further
evaluation.
Press aide Johnson also announced
that the former president will lie in
state at the LBJ Library from 10 a.m.
PST today to 6 a.m. tomorrow.
"A full honor guard of the U.S.
armed forces will be present. Various
members of Johnson's former staff
will be at his side at the library, as
they were during his years in public
life," said the press secretary. No other
funeral arrangements were announced.
Last Surviving President
Johnson was the nation's only
living former president. His death
came less than a month after that of
Harry S Truman.
President Richard M. Nixon called
Johnson "a dynamic leader, a unique
personality, and a man of great ability
and unshakeable courage."

He added, "It is particularly
heartbreaking that even as our flags fly
at half staff in President Truman's
memory, another of our leaders has
fallen.
"No man had greater dreams for
America than Lyndon Johnson. Even
as we mourn his death, we are grateful
for his life, which did so much to
make those dreams into realities."
Nixon ordered all flags on federal
buildings to fly at half staff in honor
of Johnson for 30 days.
Vice President Spiro T. Agnew led
the initial mourning from the nation's
capital following the stunning news of
Johnson's death.
Passing Unbelievable
''President Johnson's
death . .. comes as a severe shock. His
strength and vitality, his liveliness and

warmth, make the idea of his passing
somehow unbelievable," Agnew stated
yesterday afternoon.
In extending his "deepest sympathy
to Mrs. Johnson," the vice president
also said, "No president in our history
has tried harder to serve his country
well. His many accomplishments speak
fully for themselves. In time his
countrymen will come to fully
appreciate them."
Hubert H. Humphrey, whose public
life was intertwined with Johnson in
the Senate and as his vice president,
thought back on the former president
as "a strong man who cared for the
weak.
Dedicated To Education
"He was a schoolteacher who
dedicated his public life to the cause
of education. He was a man of

compassion for the elderly, and of
concern for the young.
"No man," Humphrey said, "gave
more to the struggle for human rights
nor asked more of us in the battle
against racism and discrimination."
Sen. Barry Goldwater, the man
Johnson swamped in 1964 in one of
the greatest political triumphs of
American history, said of his 1964
White House opponent:
"The country has lost a great
political leader, a dedicated American
and I have lost a friend, the memory
of whose friendship I will forever hold
close."

"In his private • and official acts,
President Johnson will go down in
history as the one president who did
all in his power to promote true
humanitarianism — the equalitarian
principle of the equality of man."
Senate Democratic leader Mike
Mansfield, a longtime associate who
succeeded Johnson as his party leader
in the Senate, said "I'm deeply sorry.
Of all the Presidents, he has done the
most domestically. I am saddened by
his loss."
House Speaker Carl Albert, another
longtime congressional associate of the
former president, was described by
aides as "very, very upset" at the

news.
Albert's statement said, "I have
never been closer to anyone in high
political office in my entire life. I have
lost a very dear friend."
Efforts For Blacks
Johnson, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy
said, earned himself a place in history
"alongside Abraham Lincoln" because
of his efforts for blacks.
"And his efforts to help the poor,
the sick and the oppressed," he said,
"stand out as landmarks of America's
concern for those too weak to help
themselves."
Gov. Ronald Reagan said Johnson
"always placed the interests of the
nation, as he saw them, first. As

president and leader of his party,
President Johnson believed that
America must honor its commitments
as the leading nation of the free
world."
News Received Here
Two of the 36th president's special
assistants, close personal advisers,
received news of his death while here
at Stanford.
Jack Valenti, President of the
Motion Picture Association of
America, cancelled a scheduled visit to
a communication class. He told an
early evening news conference in San
Francisco that Johnson "cared about
people nobody else cared about.
"If Johnson has a monument, it
won't be a slab of stone," Valenti said.
"It will be in the hearts of people."
Johnson "began the movement
toward peace," he added, and
"removed all personal ambition" for
the second term presidency "as his gift
to the peace table."
Doug Cater, visiting communication
professor and former Washington
correspondent praised Johnson for
about people.
"I hope he will be remembered
most for the things he most cared
about — the health and education and
opportunity of all Americans," Cater
said. "Those of us who served him in
these causes know how passionately he
cared and how keenly he suffered the
tragedy of Vietnam."

found him lying on his back on his
bedroom floor.
President Johnson was flown by
private plane to San Antonio Airport,
about 65 miles from the LBJ ranch,
and then taken to Brooke Army
Medical Center, 10 miles from the
airport, by military helicopter
ambulance.
Lady Bird Johnson, working in her
office above the Johnson's television
station in Austin at the time her
husband was stricken, flew by
helicopter directly to the hospital. She
arrived shortly before her husband.
In Good Spirits
The press secretary quoted Mrs.
Johnson after her husband's death as
saying, "His health seemed no
different than it had been recently. He
seemed a bit quieter, but was in good
spirits."
She left the hospital around 3 p.m.
where she went into conference with
long-time friend of the family Jesse
Kellum, and Luci and Pat Nugent, her
daughter and son-in-law.
The Johnson's other daughter,
Lynda, and her husband, Charles
Robb, flew to Texas from their home
in Charlottesville, Va.
President Johnson's cardiologist,
Dr. George McGranahan, said the
cause of the death appeared to be
coronary thrombosis.
Autopsy Performed
An autopsy was performed at
Brooke General Hospital by Col. L.R.
Hieger, chief of pathology at Brooke.
The autopsy showed that Johnson had
severe coronary artery disease with
complete occlusion of two of three
major arterial supplies to the heart.
The third major artery was about
60 percent occluded. Complete results
of the autopsy will await further
evaluation.
Press aide Johnson also announced
that the former president will lie in
state at the LBJ Library from 10 a.m.
PST today to 6 a.m. tomorrow.
"A full honor guard of the U.S.
armed forces will be present. Various
members of Johnson's former staff
will be at his side at the library, as
they were during his years in public
life," said the press secretary. No other
funeral arrangements were announced.
Last Surviving President
Johnson was the nation's only
living former president. His death
came less than a month after that of
Harry S Truman.
President Richard M. Nixon called
Johnson "a dynamic leader, a unique
personality, and a man of great ability
and unshakeable courage."

He added, "It is particularly
heartbreaking that even as our flags fly
at half staff in President Truman's
memory, another of our leaders has
fallen.
"No man had greater dreams for
America than Lyndon Johnson. Even
as we mourn his death, we are grateful
for his life, which did so much to
make those dreams into realities."
Nixon ordered all flags on federal
buildings to fly at half staff in honor
of Johnson for 30 days.
Vice President Spiro T. Agnew led
the initial mourning from the nation's
capital following the stunning news of
Johnson's death.
Passing Unbelievable
''President Johnson's
death . .. comes as a severe shock. His
strength and vitality, his liveliness and

warmth, make the idea of his passing
somehow unbelievable," Agnew stated
yesterday afternoon.
In extending his "deepest sympathy
to Mrs. Johnson," the vice president
also said, "No president in our history
has tried harder to serve his country
well. His many accomplishments speak
fully for themselves. In time his
countrymen will come to fully
appreciate them."
Hubert H. Humphrey, whose public
life was intertwined with Johnson in
the Senate and as his vice president,
thought back on the former president
as "a strong man who cared for the
weak.
Dedicated To Education
"He was a schoolteacher who
dedicated his public life to the cause
of education. He was a man of

compassion for the elderly, and of
concern for the young.
"No man," Humphrey said, "gave
more to the struggle for human rights
nor asked more of us in the battle
against racism and discrimination."
Sen. Barry Goldwater, the man
Johnson swamped in 1964 in one of
the greatest political triumphs of
American history, said of his 1964
White House opponent:
"The country has lost a great
political leader, a dedicated American
and I have lost a friend, the memory
of whose friendship I will forever hold
close."

LBJ — Lyndon Baines Johnson, 36th President of the United States, died
yesterday of a sudden heart attack. The 64-year-old former president was
stricken at his ranch in Johnson City, Texas. Johnson was the nation's only
living former president. His death came less than a month after that of Harry S
Truman. All flags on federal buildings will fly at half staff in honor of Johnson
for 30 days.
"In his private • and official acts,
President Johnson will go down in
history as the one president who did
all in his power to promote true
humanitarianism — the equalitarian
principle of the equality of man."
Senate Democratic leader Mike
Mansfield, a longtime associate who
succeeded Johnson as his party leader
in the Senate, said "I'm deeply sorry.
Of all the Presidents, he has done the
most domestically. I am saddened by
his loss."
House Speaker Carl Albert, another
longtime congressional associate of the
former president, was described by
aides as "very, very upset" at the

news.
Albert's statement said, "I have
never been closer to anyone in high
political office in my entire life. I have
lost a very dear friend."
Efforts For Blacks
Johnson, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy
said, earned himself a place in history
"alongside Abraham Lincoln" because
of his efforts for blacks.
"And his efforts to help the poor,
the sick and the oppressed," he said,
"stand out as landmarks of America's
concern for those too weak to help
themselves."
Gov. Ronald Reagan said Johnson
"always placed the interests of the
nation, as he saw them, first. As

president and leader of his party,
President Johnson believed that
America must honor its commitments
as the leading nation of the free
world."

Jack Valenti, President of the

early evening news conference in San

people nobody else cared about.
"If Johnson has a monument, it

"It will be in the hearts of people."
Johnson "began the movement
toward peace," he added, and
"removed all personal ambition" for
the second term presidency "as his gift
to the peace table."
Doug Cater, visiting communication
professor and former Washington
correspondent praised Johnson for
about people.
"I hope he will be remembered

about — the health and education and
opportunity of all Americans," Cater
said. "Those of us who served him in

cared and how keenly he suffered the
tragedy of Vietnam."

saying, "His health seemed no
different than it had been recently. He
seemed a bit quieter, but was in good
spirits."
She left the hospital around 3 p.m.
where she went into conference with
long-time friend of the family Jesse
Kellum, and Luci and Pat Nugent, her
daughter and son-in-law.
The Johnson's other daughter,
Lynda, and her husband, Charles
Robb, flew to Texas from their home
in Charlottesville, Va.
President Johnson's cardiologist,
Dr. George McGranahan, said the
cause of the death appeared to be
coronary thrombosis.
Autopsy Performed
An autopsy was performed at
Brooke General Hospital by Col. L.R.
Hieger, chief of pathology at Brooke.
The autopsy showed that Johnson had
severe coronary artery disease with
complete occlusion of two of three
major arterial supplies to the heart.
The third major artery was about
60 percent occluded. Complete results
of the autopsy will await further
evaluation.
Press aide Johnson also announced
that the former president will lie in
state at the LBJ Library from 10 a.m.
PST today to 6 a.m. tomorrow.
"A full honor guard of the U.S.
armed forces will be present. Various
members of Johnson's former staff
will be at his side at the library, as
they were during his years in public
life," said the press secretary. No other
funeral arrangements were announced.
Last Surviving President
Johnson was the nation's only
living former president. His death
came less than a month after that of
Harry S Truman.
President Richard M. Nixon called
Johnson "a dynamic leader, a unique
personality, and a man of great ability
and unshakeable courage."

He added, "It is particularly
heartbreaking that even as our flags fly
at half staff in President Truman's
memory, another of our leaders has
fallen.
"No man had greater dreams for
America than Lyndon Johnson. Even
as we mourn his death, we are grateful
for his life, which did so much to
make those dreams into realities."
Nixon ordered all flags on federal
buildings to fly at half staff in honor
of Johnson for 30 days.
Vice President Spiro T. Agnew led
the initial mourning from the nation's
capital following the stunning news of
Johnson's death.
Passing Unbelievable
''President Johnson's
death . .. comes as a severe shock. His
strength and vitality, his liveliness and

warmth, make the idea of his passing
somehow unbelievable," Agnew stated
yesterday afternoon.
In extending his "deepest sympathy
to Mrs. Johnson," the vice president
also said, "No president in our history
has tried harder to serve his country
well. His many accomplishments speak
fully for themselves. In time his
countrymen will come to fully
appreciate them."
Hubert H. Humphrey, whose public
life was intertwined with Johnson in
the Senate and as his vice president,
thought back on the former president
as "a strong man who cared for the
weak.
Dedicated To Education
"He was a schoolteacher who
dedicated his public life to the cause
of education. He was a man of

compassion for the elderly, and of
concern for the young.
"No man," Humphrey said, "gave
more to the struggle for human rights
nor asked more of us in the battle
against racism and discrimination."
Sen. Barry Goldwater, the man
Johnson swamped in 1964 in one of
the greatest political triumphs of
American history, said of his 1964
White House opponent:
"The country has lost a great
political leader, a dedicated American
and I have lost a friend, the memory
of whose friendship I will forever hold
close."

LBJ — Lyndon Baines Johnson, 36th President of the United States, died
yesterday of a sudden heart attack. The 64-year-old former president was
stricken at his ranch in Johnson City, Texas. Johnson was the nation's only
living former president. His death came less than a month after that of Harry S
Truman. All flags on federal buildings will fly at half staff in honor of Johnson
for 30 days.
"In his private • and official acts,
President Johnson will go down in
history as the one president who did
all in his power to promote true
humanitarianism — the equalitarian
principle of the equality of man."
Senate Democratic leader Mike
Mansfield, a longtime associate who
succeeded Johnson as his party leader
in the Senate, said "I'm deeply sorry.
Of all the Presidents, he has done the
most domestically. I am saddened by
his loss."
House Speaker Carl Albert, another
longtime congressional associate of the
former president, was described by
aides as "very, very upset" at the

news.
Albert's statement said, "I have
never been closer to anyone in high
political office in my entire life. I have
lost a very dear friend."
Efforts For Blacks
Johnson, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy
said, earned himself a place in history
"alongside Abraham Lincoln" because
of his efforts for blacks.
"And his efforts to help the poor,
the sick and the oppressed," he said,
"stand out as landmarks of America's
concern for those too weak to help
themselves."
Gov. Ronald Reagan said Johnson
"always placed the interests of the
nation, as he saw them, first. As

president and leader of his party,
President Johnson believed that
America must honor its commitments
as the leading nation of the free
world."

Two of the 36th president's special

received news of his death while here
at Stanford.
Jack Valenti, President of the
Motion Picture Association of

a communication class. He told an
early evening news conference in San
Francisco that Johnson "cared about
people nobody else cared about.
"If Johnson has a monument, it
won't be a slab of stone," Valenti said.
"It will be in the hearts of people."
Johnson "began the movement
toward peace," he added, and
"removed all personal ambition" for
the second term presidency "as his gift
to the peace table."
Doug Cater, visiting communication
professor and former Washington
correspondent praised Johnson for
about people.
"I hope he will be remembered
most for the things he most cared
about — the health and education and
opportunity of all Americans," Cater
said. "Those of us who served him in
these causes know how passionately he
cared and how keenly he suffered the
tragedy of Vietnam."
Lyndon Baines Johnson, 36th

Autopsy Performed
An autopsy was performed at
Brooke General Hospital by Col. L.R.
Hieger, chief of pathology at Brooke.
The autopsy showed that Johnson had
severe coronary artery disease with
complete occlusion of two of three
major arterial supplies to the heart.
The third major artery was about
60 percent occluded. Complete results
of the autopsy will await further
evaluation.
Press aide Johnson also announced
that the former president will lie in
state at the LBJ Library from 10 a.m.
PST today to 6 a.m. tomorrow.
"A full honor guard of the U.S.
armed forces will be present. Various
members of Johnson's former staff
will be at his side at the library, as
they were during his years in public
life," said the press secretary. No other
funeral arrangements were announced.
Last Surviving President
Johnson was the nation's only
living former president. His death
came less than a month after that of
Harry S Truman.
President Richard M. Nixon called
Johnson "a dynamic leader, a unique
personality, and a man of great ability
and unshakeable courage."

He added, "It is particularly
heartbreaking that even as our flags fly
at half staff in President Truman's
memory, another of our leaders has
fallen.
"No man had greater dreams for
America than Lyndon Johnson. Even
as we mourn his death, we are grateful
for his life, which did so much to
make those dreams into realities."
Nixon ordered all flags on federal
buildings to fly at half staff in honor
of Johnson for 30 days.
Vice President Spiro T. Agnew led
the initial mourning from the nation's
capital following the stunning news of
Johnson's death.
Passing Unbelievable
''President Johnson's
death . .. comes as a severe shock. His
strength and vitality, his liveliness and

warmth, make the idea of his passing
somehow unbelievable," Agnew stated
yesterday afternoon.
In extending his "deepest sympathy
to Mrs. Johnson," the vice president
also said, "No president in our history
has tried harder to serve his country
well. His many accomplishments speak
fully for themselves. In time his
countrymen will come to fully
appreciate them."
Hubert H. Humphrey, whose public
life was intertwined with Johnson in
the Senate and as his vice president,
thought back on the former president
as "a strong man who cared for the
weak.
Dedicated To Education
"He was a schoolteacher who
dedicated his public life to the cause
of education. He was a man of

compassion for the elderly, and of
concern for the young.
"No man," Humphrey said, "gave
more to the struggle for human rights
nor asked more of us in the battle
against racism and discrimination."
Sen. Barry Goldwater, the man
Johnson swamped in 1964 in one of
the greatest political triumphs of
American history, said of his 1964
White House opponent:
"The country has lost a great
political leader, a dedicated American
and I have lost a friend, the memory
of whose friendship I will forever hold
close."

LBJ — Lyndon Baines Johnson, 36th President of the United States, died
yesterday of a sudden heart attack. The 64-year-old former president was
stricken at his ranch in Johnson City, Texas. Johnson was the nation's only
living former president. His death came less than a month after that of Harry S
Truman. All flags on federal buildings will fly at half staff in honor of Johnson
for 30 days.
"In his private • and official acts,
President Johnson will go down in
history as the one president who did
all in his power to promote true
humanitarianism — the equalitarian
principle of the equality of man."
Senate Democratic leader Mike
Mansfield, a longtime associate who
succeeded Johnson as his party leader
in the Senate, said "I'm deeply sorry.
Of all the Presidents, he has done the
most domestically. I am saddened by
his loss."
House Speaker Carl Albert, another
longtime congressional associate of the
former president, was described by
aides as "very, very upset" at the

news.
Albert's statement said, "I have
never been closer to anyone in high
political office in my entire life. I have
lost a very dear friend."
Efforts For Blacks
Johnson, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy
said, earned himself a place in history
"alongside Abraham Lincoln" because
of his efforts for blacks.
"And his efforts to help the poor,
the sick and the oppressed," he said,
"stand out as landmarks of America's
concern for those too weak to help
themselves."
Gov. Ronald Reagan said Johnson
"always placed the interests of the
nation, as he saw them, first. As

president and leader of his party,
President Johnson believed that
America must honor its commitments
as the leading nation of the free
world."
News Received Here
Two of the 36th president's special
assistants, close personal advisers,
received news of his death while here
at Stanford.
Jack Valenti, President of the
Motion Picture Association of
America, cancelled a scheduled visit to
a communication class. He told an
early evening news conference in San
Francisco that Johnson "cared about
people nobody else cared about.
"If Johnson has a monument, it
won't be a slab of stone," Valenti said.
"It will be in the hearts of people."
Johnson "began the movement
toward peace," he added, and
"removed all personal ambition" for
the second term presidency "as his gift
to the peace table."
Doug Cater, visiting communication
professor and former Washington
correspondent praised Johnson for
about people.
"I hope he will be remembered
most for the things he most cared
about — the health and education and
opportunity of all Americans," Cater
said. "Those of us who served him in
these causes know how passionately he
cared and how keenly he suffered the
tragedy of Vietnam."
Lyndon Baines Johnson, 36th
president of the United States, died
yesterday of a heart attack.
The 64-year-old former president,
who had a history of heart trouble
dating back to 1955, was stricken at
his ranch in Johnson City, Texas, and
pronounced dead at 1:43 p.m. PST at
San Antonio International Airport, a
spokesman said.
The spokesman, long-time LBJ aide
and press secretary Tom Johnson (no
relation), said that two Secret Service
agents assigned to the former president
found him lying on his back on his
bedroom floor.
President Johnson was flown by
private plane to San Antonio Airport,
about 65 miles from the LBJ ranch,
and then taken to Brooke Army
Medical Center, 10 miles from the
airport, by military helicopter
ambulance.
Lady Bird Johnson, working in her
office above the Johnson's television
station in Austin at the time her
husband was stricken, flew by
helicopter directly to the hospital. She
arrived shortly before her husband.
In Good Spirits
The press secretary quoted Mrs.
Johnson after her husband's death as
saying, "His health seemed no
different than it had been recently. He
seemed a bit quieter, but was in good
spirits."
She left the hospital around 3 p.m.
where she went into conference with
long-time friend of the family Jesse
Kellum, and Luci and Pat Nugent, her
daughter and son-in-law.
The Johnson's other daughter,
Lynda, and her husband, Charles
Robb, flew to Texas from their home
in Charlottesville, Va.
President Johnson's cardiologist,
Dr. George McGranahan, said the
cause of the death appeared to be
coronary thrombosis.
