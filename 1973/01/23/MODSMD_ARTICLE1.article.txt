## 
### MARK SIMONIAN 
Lyndon Baines Johnson, 36th
president of the United States, died
yesterday of a heart attack.
The 64-year-old former president,
who had a history of heart trouble
dating back to 1955, was stricken at
his ranch in Johnson City, Texas, and
pronounced dead at 1:43 p.m. PST at
San Antonio International Airport, a
spokesman said.
The spokesman, long-time LBJ aide
and press secretary Tom Johnson (no
relation), said that two Secret Service
agents assigned to the former president
found him lying on his back on his
bedroom floor.
President Johnson was flown by
private plane to San Antonio Airport,
about 65 miles from the LBJ ranch,
and then taken to Brooke Army
Medical Center, 10 miles from the
airport, by military helicopter
ambulance.
Lady Bird Johnson, working in her
office above the Johnson's television
station in Austin at the time her
husband was stricken, flew by
helicopter directly to the hospital. She
arrived shortly before her husband.
In Good Spirits
The press secretary quoted Mrs.
Johnson after her husband's death as
saying, "His health seemed no
different than it had been recently. He
seemed a bit quieter, but was in good
spirits."
She left the hospital around 3 p.m.
where she went into conference with
long-time friend of the family Jesse
Kellum, and Luci and Pat Nugent, her
daughter and son-in-law.
The Johnson's other daughter,
Lynda, and her husband, Charles
Robb, flew to Texas from their home
in Charlottesville, Va.
President Johnson's cardiologist,
Dr. George McGranahan, said the
cause of the death appeared to be
coronary thrombosis.
Autopsy Performed
An autopsy was performed at
Brooke General Hospital by Col. L.R.
Hieger, chief of pathology at Brooke.
The autopsy showed that Johnson had
severe coronary artery disease with
complete occlusion of two of three
major arterial supplies to the heart.
The third major artery was about
60 percent occluded. Complete results
of the autopsy will await further
evaluation.
Press aide Johnson also announced
that the former president will lie in
state at the LBJ Library from 10 a.m.
PST today to 6 a.m. tomorrow.
"A full honor guard of the U.S.
armed forces will be present. Various
members of Johnson's former staff
will be at his side at the library, as
they were during his years in public
life," said the press secretary. No other
funeral arrangements were announced.
Last Surviving President
Johnson was the nation's only
living former president. His death
came less than a month after that of
Harry S Truman.
President Richard M. Nixon called
Johnson "a dynamic leader, a unique
personality, and a man of great ability
and unshakeable courage."

He added, "It is particularly
heartbreaking that even as our flags fly
at half staff in President Truman's
memory, another of our leaders has
fallen.
"No man had greater dreams for
America than Lyndon Johnson. Even
as we mourn his death, we are grateful
for his life, which did so much to
make those dreams into realities."
Nixon ordered all flags on federal
buildings to fly at half staff in honor
of Johnson for 30 days.
Vice President Spiro T. Agnew led
the initial mourning from the nation's
capital following the stunning news of
Johnson's death.
Passing Unbelievable
''President Johnson's
death . .. comes as a severe shock. His
strength and vitality, his liveliness and

warmth, make the idea of his passing
somehow unbelievable," Agnew stated
yesterday afternoon.
In extending his "deepest sympathy
to Mrs. Johnson," the vice president
also said, "No president in our history
has tried harder to serve his country
well. His many accomplishments speak
fully for themselves. In time his
countrymen will come to fully
appreciate them."
Hubert H. Humphrey, whose public
life was intertwined with Johnson in
the Senate and as his vice president,
thought back on the former president
as "a strong man who cared for the
weak.
Dedicated To Education
"He was a schoolteacher who
dedicated his public life to the cause
of education. He was a man of

compassion for the elderly, and of
concern for the young.
"No man," Humphrey said, "gave
more to the struggle for human rights
nor asked more of us in the battle
against racism and discrimination."
Sen. Barry Goldwater, the man
Johnson swamped in 1964 in one of
the greatest political triumphs of
American history, said of his 1964
White House opponent:
"The country has lost a great
political leader, a dedicated American
and I have lost a friend, the memory
of whose friendship I will forever hold
close."
'True Human itarianism'
Justice Thuxgood Marshall,
appointed by the 36th president as the
first black to the Supreme Court, said:
