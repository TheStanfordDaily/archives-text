## Disrespect For Truth In Academia 
### 
William shockley

Disrespect for truth in
academia is a reality. "Unsearch
dogmatism" and semantic
ingenuity lead to recurrent
mistakes in the search for truth.
These are powerful foes to my
objectives in tonight's debate in
the Psychology Department
Colloquium. What is needed for
intellectual health was expressed
by Harry Stack Sullivan in The
Psychiatric Interview (W.W.
Norton and Co., Inc.; New York,
1954):
"Sometimes a patient asks:

'Doctor, how can I do better at
what it is vital for me to do?'
And sometimes a therapist asks:
'What do I do to be of help in all
this?' The answer to both
questions is this: work towards
uncovering those factors which
are concerned in the person's
recurrent mistakes, and which
lead to his taking ineffective and
inappropriate action. There is no
necessity to do more."
Sullivan's observation expresses
a major objective of my debate
position. It demands that we do
uncover those factors relevant to
the agonizing question in the back
of the minds of many concerned
citizens—the question that
because I have openly demanded
that it be considered has produced
the publicity that provoked the
debate—the question of hereditary
factors in our urban decay and the
related racial problems.
Disrespect For Truth
My aim in this column and in
the debate is to hasten sound
diagnosis. To do so, I shall analyze
more deeply the growing
disrespect for truth in our
intellectual community.
This disrespect for truth
shocked me when I attempted to
prevent ROTC from being barined
from the Stanford Campus. It
seemed to me that the attitude
expressed by youth and by
inverted-liberal faculty members
was unrealistic. The history of a
similar position taken by the
signers of the Oxford Oath in the
1920s showed that our society
had failed to learn history's
lesson.
My severest shock was from an
argument with a professor of
profoundly unrealistic
views—indeed, one unwilling to
concede a non-seinantic reality for
2 + 3 = 5. "It might be different
on Mars," I was told. Two plus
three equals five is the simplest
general example of the
commutative law of addition. It
applies pebbles, coins, and
mixtures of apples, oranges and
marbles. When such a true,
quantitative, transmittable reality

is rejected by the intellectual
community, recurrent mistakes
and ineffective and inappropriate
self-defeating actions must follow.
Ethical Decline
Our nation—indeed Western
Civilization itself—is suffering
from an ethical decline. A central
symptom is anti-intellectualism—a
concomitant of disrespect for
truth. I hold that applied
anti-intellectualism is an evil. In
the 19205, Albert Schweitzer, in
his "The Philosophy of
Civilization," similarly blamed
philosophy (which in those
pre-women's lib days he referred
to as "she"): "The creative spirit
had left her. . . Refusing to
concern herself with elemental
problems, she contained no
elemental philosophy which could
become a philosophy of the
people." Schweitzer tried to
remedy this ethical defect by
proposing his "reverence for life"
as a fundamental principle.
I have attempted to set goals
for myself similar to Schweitzer's.
I shall attempt to define an
important cause for our
intellectual irresponsibility. I have
proposed a basis for ethical
principles. This basis is one that I
have been forced to develop in
response to attacks upon my

motives, competence and
integrity.
I have been attacked because
of my insistence on discussing the
topics that, at long last, have
provoked the Psychology
Department to challenge me to
debate (after their professors
ignored my debate challenge in
The Stanford Daily). I printed my
basis for ethics when I responded
to a column in Presbyterian Life
that branded me a disciple of
Hitler. My response was entitled,
"Three Moral Postulates:
Truth—Concern— Death—."
Mammalian Forms
I welcome the opportunity to
participate in the Psychology
Department's Colloquium-
Debate on heritability of IQ and
its significance in modem society.
I believe the heritability of
intelligence and man's relationship
to other mammalian forms of life
on earth are central to the ethical
problems of our nation.
[Space limitations have required
us to omit portions of Dr.
Shockley's statement. The full
text of the statement will be
available in handout form at
tonight's debate.]
During the debate, I urge
listeners to search for objective
realities—truths. When I was

allowed to teach freshmen
seminars (no professor at Stanford
has taught more), I defined
TRANSOPREP ACORS as
objective realities:
TRANSmittable to others,
defined in Operational terms, and
found to be REProducible.
My counting example of
2 + 3 = 5 is TRANSOPREP. It is
also an ACOR. It has (key or
central) Attributes that by
Comparison Operations do
produce an Orderly
Relationship—2 +3=3+ 2= 5
exhibits the orderly relationships
of the commutative law of
addition. A TRANSOPREP ACOR
for human-quality problems is the
80 percent at 2,000 IQ geneticity
assertion.
I anticipate from prior
experience that irrelevant side
issues will enter ttie
Colloquium-Debate, including ad
hominem arguments. I urge
observers to seek for
TRANSOPREP ACORS in the
area of controversy and to
disregard ad hominem attacks in
the debate.
Wisdom from the mouths of
babes is truth—//" it is a
TRANSOPREP ACOR.
