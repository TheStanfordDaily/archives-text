## Minimum Wage Law Strikes Again 
### 
Chris hocker

Ronald McDonald is not the only clown in
San Francisco.
Ronald, who is familiar to us as the mascot
of the world-famous hamburger enterprise,
appears in fact to be a paragon of wisdom and
virtue when compared to some of The City's
Master Planners, who recently caused a
controversy of some proportion by denying
McDonald's the right to open more franchises
within city limits.
The reasons given for this denial were
somewhat vague, but in the main, McDonald's
was accused of perpetrating various high
crimes and misdemeanors against its employed
staff. Employees, it was said, were paid below
the minimum wage, and the management
often withheld tips from the aforementioned
underpaid staff, and We certainly can't have
this sort of unenlightened, unprogressive
goings-on in Our City, now can We?
I find it hard to believe that these were the
real reasons for denying the permits, since
there must be other companies with similar
practices operating in San Francisco. I tend to
think that the real reasons involved matters of
personal taste, which become so important
when Master Planners are allowed to exercise
control over our economic life.
Hamburgers And French Fries
At Stanford, for instance, McDonald's is
regarded as a rallying-point for the cheap, the
plastic, the tawdry and unsophisticated—in
short, the bourgeois ideal. McDonald's is an
affront to our delicate sensibilities

Hamburgers and french fries—God, how
middle-class! Such an attitude is prevalent in
San Francisco, as demonstrated in the recent
attempt to limit building-height to six
stories—a frivolous and arbitrary proposal that
expressed nothing more concrete than the
aesthetic whim of Alvin Duskin.
The fact is, it's damn difficult to define
objectively "good" taste and "poor" taste,
and even if you could, should such
pronouncements have the force of law?
But let's forget San Francisco's tendency
to legislate opinions, and pretend that
McDonald's was denied the right to build
hamburger stands because of their heinous
treatment of employees, and that this ill
treatment is the worst and most flagrant
example of capitalist excess in the entire Bay
Area. Assuming all this, should McDonald's be
banned from the San Francisco city limits?
Unskilled Workers
That all depends on your views on the
minimum-wage law. Suppose McDonald's is
willing to hire 16 people at $1.00 an hour,
and that 16 people are willing to work for
$1.00 an hour. These people will probably be
unskilled—students, the poor, minorities—the
same people who comprise much of the
unemployed at the present time. By working
at McDonald's these people are no longer
unemployed, although their wages are not
very large.
Now suppose that a law is passed requiring
the minimum unge to be $1 f>o cv"" hour

McDonald's is probably going to fire six of its
workers in order to hold expenses to the
previous level—not because it's a dirty
profiteering rip-off organization, but because
its economic survival comes down to the few
cents per hour that it can save (the other
alternative would be to raise the price of the
food).
If there are ten people working at $1.60
per hour where there were 16 people working
at $1.00 per hour, then,obviously, six more
people are unemployed than before. And
these people, who are for the most part
unskilled, inexperienced, and disadvantaged,
will tend to stay unemployed longer.
Milton Friedman
Granted, $1.00 an hour isn't much—barely
enough to supply necessities. But, to
paraphrase Milton Friedman, would you
rather have six people employed at $1.00 per
hour or six people unemployed at $1.60 per
hour?
What San Francisco's Master Planners view
as "underpayment" is demonstrably
preferable to no payment at all—unless one
favors the expansion of the already-swollen
welfare rolls or the imposition of price
controls, both of which lead to the eventual
paralysis of the economy.
And as for withholding tips—when was the
last time you tipped a McDonald's employee?
