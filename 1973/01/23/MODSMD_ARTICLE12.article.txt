## 'Shockley A Threat To Us' 
### 
gini faller

Tonight at 7:30 in Memorial
Auditorium, William Shockley
will debate his theories on race
and intelligence with Profs. Cedric
X of Psychology and L.L.
Cavalli-Sforza of Genetics. This
debate is especially important
because Shockley has, in the past,
refused to debate anyone and
because the audience will be able
to ask questions.
Although his field is electrical
engineering, Shockley is a
self-proclaimed "expert" in

questions of inheritance and
intelligence. He feels that Black
people are genetically inferior
intellectually to whites and favors
"voluntary" sterilization and
strict welfare laws to prevent high
ghetto birthrates. He has even
started his own organization:
Foundation for Research and
Education on Eugenics and
Dysgenics (FREED) to lobby
scientists and legislators to
support his plans.
Last year the Stanford
Rehabilitation Movement (SRM)
demanded that Shockley no
longer be allowed to use his
position as professor at Stanford
to gain credance for his views and
that he be dismissed from the
university. The administration's
refusal to do so was based on
"free speech."
Yet Bruce P'ranklin was fired
for making speeches outside of
the classroom while Shockley
used his Quantum Mechanics
course to lecture on dysgenics and
refused to allow an African
student to take his course for
credit.
When the Third World
Liberation Front (TWLF) entered
his class to demand that he at
least publicly debate a Black
member of the faculty or
community, three students were
suspended indefinitely. Yet when
the "Stanford Chapter of the Ku
Klux Klan" offered him a "free
sterilization at the hospital of his
choice," eight people were
arrested and are now facing heavy
•fines and probation. It became
clear that "free speech" at
Stanford protects the right to
promote genocide but not the
right to protest against it.
It has also become clear that
Shockley is not just a "crazy old
man" and that his theories will
not die out when he does.
Shockley's plans are'a very real
threat now.

After his successful work on
the transistor, William Shockley
opened the first semi-conductor
plant in 1956 (this plant was later
bought out by ITT). Most of the
industry's big men (founders of
Watkins-Johnson, Fairchild, etc.)
were trained in his laboratories—in
his race theories as well as in his
knowledge of semi-conductors.
As a result the industry, which
is one of the largest employers of
women in the Bay Area, not only
divides its workers along sex lines,
but along race lines, with some
bosses openly following
Shockley's hierarchy (Blacks on
bottom, followed by Brown
people, with Asians and white
people tied for the top).
Shockley's theories not only
help mold the semi-conductor
(war) industry, but are creeping
up in legislative circles as a result
of FREED lobbying. A welfare
plan is being discussed which
would declare the mother of a
third illegitimate child "morally
depraved." She would have the
choice of either giving up welfare
or her child. In other parts of the
country, forced sterilization of
welfare women has become a
reality. These programs work
toward Shockley's end of
preventing dangerous inbreeding
among "genetic inferiors."
Because of these and other
examples, many groups, such as
the Women's Center and the
Women's Union at Stanford, have
seen Shockley's plans as a threat
not only to Third World people,
but to all women. We must realize
that Shockley is a danger to all of
us and that "an attack against one
is an attack against all." We
should go to the debate, question
him, and then join together in
demanding that William Shockley
not be allowed to teach at
Stanford.

X of Psychology and L.L.
Cavalli-Sforza of Genetics. This
debate is especially important
because Shockley has, in the past,
refused to debate anyone and
because the audience will be able
to ask questions.
Although his field is electrical
engineering, Shockley is a
self-proclaimed "expert" in

questions of inheritance and
intelligence. He feels that Black
people are genetically inferior
intellectually to whites and favors
"voluntary" sterilization and
strict welfare laws to prevent high
ghetto birthrates. He has even
started his own organization:
Foundation for Research and
Education on Eugenics and
Dysgenics (FREED) to lobby
scientists and legislators to
support his plans.
Last year the Stanford
Rehabilitation Movement (SRM)
demanded that Shockley no
longer be allowed to use his
position as professor at Stanford
to gain credance for his views and
that he be dismissed from the
university. The administration's
refusal to do so was based on
"free speech."
Yet Bruce P'ranklin was fired
for making speeches outside of
the classroom while Shockley
used his Quantum Mechanics
course to lecture on dysgenics and
refused to allow an African
student to take his course for
credit.
When the Third World
Liberation Front (TWLF) entered
his class to demand that he at
least publicly debate a Black
member of the faculty or
community, three students were
suspended indefinitely. Yet when
the "Stanford Chapter of the Ku
Klux Klan" offered him a "free
sterilization at the hospital of his
choice," eight people were
arrested and are now facing heavy
•fines and probation. It became
clear that "free speech" at
Stanford protects the right to
promote genocide but not the
right to protest against it.
It has also become clear that
Shockley is not just a "crazy old
man" and that his theories will
not die out when he does.
Shockley's plans are'a very real
threat now.

After his successful work on
the transistor, William Shockley
opened the first semi-conductor
plant in 1956 (this plant was later
bought out by ITT). Most of the
industry's big men (founders of
Watkins-Johnson, Fairchild, etc.)
were trained in his laboratories—in
his race theories as well as in his
knowledge of semi-conductors.
As a result the industry, which
is one of the largest employers of
women in the Bay Area, not only
divides its workers along sex lines,
but along race lines, with some
bosses openly following
Shockley's hierarchy (Blacks on
bottom, followed by Brown
people, with Asians and white
people tied for the top).
Shockley's theories not only
help mold the semi-conductor
(war) industry, but are creeping
up in legislative circles as a result
of FREED lobbying. A welfare
plan is being discussed which
would declare the mother of a
third illegitimate child "morally
depraved." She would have the
choice of either giving up welfare
or her child. In other parts of the
country, forced sterilization of
welfare women has become a
reality. These programs work
toward Shockley's end of
preventing dangerous inbreeding
among "genetic inferiors."
Because of these and other
examples, many groups, such as
the Women's Center and the
Women's Union at Stanford, have
seen Shockley's plans as a threat
not only to Third World people,
but to all women. We must realize
that Shockley is a danger to all of
us and that "an attack against one
is an attack against all." We
should go to the debate, question
him, and then join together in
demanding that William Shockley
not be allowed to teach at
Stanford.
