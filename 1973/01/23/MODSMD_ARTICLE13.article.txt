The University disconnected the extension phone from our house.
When we tried calling for an explanation the guy in charge wasn Y ever
in. What goes? B.F.
All of the so-called "dial nine, limited access phones" were
removed from University housing as of Jan. 8 because the University
needed the telephone lines for its offices, according to Barbara
Hockett, accounting assistant for Plant Services.
Dale Snape in the dean of students office is working with plant
services to investigate the possibility of installing a special "black
box" exchange which would allow all of the houses to have special
outside lines. These lines would allow only local calls and would cost
only $1.80 a month. The University extensions had cost $13.60 per
month. The only apparent problem with the black box system is that
installation would cost over $2000.
Snape said he should know about the black box system within a
month. Until then he advises that houses can and probably should get
pay telephones which are free and in fact pay the dorm a percentage
of their income.

What is the history behind Lake Lagunita? When was it built and
why? K.H.R.
Lake Lagunita, sometimes known as Fake Lagunita, is usually
assumed to have been built for the pleasure of Stanford students. In
fact, however, according to records furnished by the archivist, it
outdates the University and was originally built in the early 1880's as
a reservoir to store water to irrigate alfalfa which grew in what now is
the central campus.
"Lagunita! The very mention of the name will bring back a train of
memories to every son and daughter of the Stanford Red. Across its
calm surface has rippled mirth; its murky depths have mutely held
their tragedies; and, with every passing year, every passing class, it has
passed with them into history," according to a 1939 Stanford
Illustrated Review.
When the lake was first built it was too porous to store water. To
correct the situation Governor Leland Stanford had several tons of
clay hauled in to completely cover the bottom. 2000 sheep were used
to tramp the clay. According to a '25 Illustrated Review the process
went as follows: "When all was ready the depression was filled with
water. Then the sheep were started traveling around the edge. Two
men and four dogs kept them going. They were driven two hours in
the morning and two again in the afternoon.
Each day about eight feet of water was run off, and then the sheep
were driven around again. This process was continued until only a
shallow pond remained. The superintendent of the Stanford ranch
and about fifty Chinamen and all hands bunched the sheep in the
water to trample the bottom. When this was finished, the same
process was repeated three times."
According to a 1945 Daily article, "When Stanford came into
existence, some of the students discovered that the lake would be an
ideal location for crew meets. Some of the athletes began climbing
over the fences in the lake in order to practice. This crew activity soon
gave rise to interest among the students for the establishment of the
only boating and swimming center in the vicinity."
So it was that Lagunita—Spanish for "little lake"—got started.

a reservoir to store water to irrigate alfalfa which grew in what now is
the central campus.
"Lagunita! The very mention of the name will bring back a train of
memories to every son and daughter of the Stanford Red. Across its
calm surface has rippled mirth; its murky depths have mutely held
their tragedies; and, with every passing year, every passing class, it has
passed with them into history," according to a 1939 Stanford
Illustrated Review.
When the lake was first built it was too porous to store water. To
correct the situation Governor Leland Stanford had several tons of
clay hauled in to completely cover the bottom. 2000 sheep were used
to tramp the clay. According to a '25 Illustrated Review the process
went as follows: "When all was ready the depression was filled with
water. Then the sheep were started traveling around the edge. Two
men and four dogs kept them going. They were driven two hours in
the morning and two again in the afternoon.
Each day about eight feet of water was run off, and then the sheep
were driven around again. This process was continued until only a
shallow pond remained. The superintendent of the Stanford ranch
and about fifty Chinamen and all hands bunched the sheep in the
water to trample the bottom. When this was finished, the same
process was repeated three times."
According to a 1945 Daily article, "When Stanford came into
existence, some of the students discovered that the lake would be an
ideal location for crew meets. Some of the athletes began climbing
over the fences in the lake in order to practice. This crew activity soon
gave rise to interest among the students for the establishment of the
only boating and swimming center in the vicinity."
So it was that Lagunita—Spanish for "little lake"—got started.

How do we get refunds on ASSUappropriations? N.L.

The University disconnected the extension phone from our house.

All of the so-called "dial nine, limited access phones" were
removed from University housing as of Jan. 8 because the University
needed the telephone lines for its offices, according to Barbara
Hockett, accounting assistant for Plant Services.
Dale Snape in the dean of students office is working with plant
services to investigate the possibility of installing a special "black
box" exchange which would allow all of the houses to have special
outside lines. These lines would allow only local calls and would cost
only $1.80 a month. The University extensions had cost $13.60 per
month. The only apparent problem with the black box system is that
installation would cost over $2000.
Snape said he should know about the black box system within a
month. Until then he advises that houses can and probably should get
pay telephones which are free and in fact pay the dorm a percentage
of their income.

What is the history behind Lake Lagunita? When was it built and
why? K.H.R.
Lake Lagunita, sometimes known as Fake Lagunita, is usually
assumed to have been built for the pleasure of Stanford students. In
fact, however, according to records furnished by the archivist, it
outdates the University and was originally built in the early 1880's as
a reservoir to store water to irrigate alfalfa which grew in what now is
the central campus.
