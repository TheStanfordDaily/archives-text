# Yale Serves Breakfast In Bed
## 
### 
(AP) — About 900 Yale freshmen,
bleary-eyed and book-ridden on
the last day of final exams, got a
special treat last week—breakfast
in bed, complete with cigars for
the men and red carnations for
the women.
Dining hall workers and some
60 student volunteers teamed to
deliver juice, scrambled eggs,
home fries, sausage, bagels, cream
cheese and coffee to the freshman
rooms.
"It's pretty nice of them to do
this," said Tomas Flores, a

freshman from San Diego, Calif.
He and his roommate, Jeffrey
Green of Tucson, Ariz., had just
rolled over in bed and accepted
breakfast in insulated trays from a
volunteer server.
Freshman John Andrews of
Concord, Mass., said he originated
the idea while mulling over the
question: "Who are the most
uptight people around here?"
The answer, he said, was
evident: freshmen at exam time.
William J. Hickey Jr., an
assistant director of dining halls,

said the idea was welcomed by the
Yale administration because
"we're interested in this
monotony-breaking thing."
Most of the students appeared
happy with the service, although
some left "Do Not Disturb" signs
on their doors.
"I think spirits are better than
usual this morning," said
volunteer server Julie Melamud of
New York City as she ran up and
down stairs delivering meals in
all-male Bingham College.
