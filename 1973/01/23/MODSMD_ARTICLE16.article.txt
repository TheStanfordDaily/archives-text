# LBJ Ruled Over Turbulent 1960s
## 
### 
From the Associated Press
Lyndon Baines Johnson, the
nation's 36th president, held
office during the stormiest
domestic times since the Civil War
and declined to run for a second
full term.
The Stonewall, Tex., native
who combined a folksy manner
with a will of iron that he used in
the Congress and in the White
House to bend legislators his way,
presided over the buildup of the
Vietnam war.
And it was the war that many
said led to his announcement in
March of 1968 that he would not
run for another full term. At the
same time, Johnson announced a
halt in the U.S. bombing of North
Vietnam above the 19th Parallel
and set in motion the machinery
that led to the Paris peace talks.
Lyndon Johnson was born
August 27, 1908. After he
finished high school, he showed
no interest in further education or
a career.
Johnson's parents persuaded
him to enter Southwest State
Teachers College at San Marcos,
Texas. After he graduated, he
taught debate in high school.
In 1934 Johnson married

Claudia Alta Taylor — known as
Lady Bird. One year later
President Franklin D. Roosevelt
appointed him director of the
National Youth Administration
for Texas.
Johnson was elected to the
U.S. House of Representatives in
1937. He tried and lost for the
U.S. Senate in 1941. He was
finally elected to the Senate in
1948 and became majority leader
in 1954.
Johnson had sought the
Democratic nomination for
president which Kennedy won in
1960. And when Kennedy asked
the Texas to be his running mate,
Johnson agreed, although he knew
he would be surrendering his
powerful place as Senate majority
leader for th£ traditional
obscurity of the vice presidency.
Low Profile Veep
As vice president, he presided
routinely over the Senate. He did
not use that position as he had
used the majority leader's role to
dynamically force legislation
through Congress.
Neither did he use his talents as
a great legislative persuader, arm
twister and compromiser after he
became vice president.

Thrust into the White House
after the assassination of John F.
Kennedy on Nov. 22, 1963 in
Dallas, Tex., he succeeded the
man he challenged for the 1960
nomination. He was elected to a
full term by a landslide in 1964.
The first Southerner to hold
the presidency since 1865,
Johnson was one of the strongest
advocates of civil rights
legislation, both during his more
than two decades in Congress and
while he was in the White House.
Sweeping Developments
Johnson's administration was
marked by sweeping
developments in the field of civil
rights, Social Security, aid to
education, and housing and
development.
He proposed the voting rights
act later enacted by the 89th
Congress. He also initiated the war
on poverty and the Great Society,
a collection of domestic societal
programs, many of which liberal
Democrats had fought for
unsuccessfully since Franklin D.
Roosevelt.
It was Roosevelt who was
Johnson's political mentor. "He
was like a daddy to me," Johnson
often said.

Johnson announced his plans
for the Great Society in a
commencement address at the
University of Texas on May 30,
1964. "I intend to try and achieve
a broad national consensus which
can end obstructionand paralysis
and liberate the energies of the
nation for the work of the
future."
1965 Inaugural
In his inaugural address of
1965 — one of the shortest in
history — Johnson vowed to
overcome poverty, sickness and
ignorance. And he told the world:
"We aspire to nothing that
belongs to others. We seek no
dominion over our fellow man,
but man's dominion over tyranny
and misery."
The first American troops were
sent to South Vietnam in
February of that year, however.
Escalation of the war actually had
begun in August the previous year
when Communist boats attacked
U.S. ships in the Gulf of Tonkin
and Johnson gained congressional
approval of a resolution granting
him full support for "all necessary
action to protect our armed
forces."
In April, 1965 Johnson

provoked a storm of criticism
when he announced that 400 U.S.
Marines had been sent into Santo
Domingo to protect Americans
caught in a Dominican Republic
government upheaval.
The Texan's first year in office
on an elected basis also was
marked by the arrests and
brutality in Selma, Ala., when
Negroes sought to register to vote.
The trouble brought a proposal
from Johnson that Congress enact
the voting rights act.
It is ironic that Johnson was
responsible for more legislation to
help Negroes than any president
since Abraham Lincoln. Yet his
administration was marred by
black rioting.
He sponsored massive aid to
education. Yet college unrest and
attacks broke out as never before
in the nation's history.
Johnson's years in the White
House also saw the weddings of
both of his daughters — Luci, who
as a converted Catholic was
married in a church, and Lynda
who was married in the White
House.
No Second Term
He stunned the nation when he
announced in March, 1968 that he
would not seek a second elected
term and also said that he had
ordered a partial halt to U.S.
bombing of North Vietnam.
His avowed reason for failing
to seek the office in 1968 was
that he wished to devote full time
for the remainder of his term,
without the distractions of
campaigning, to ending the
Vietnam War.
At another time, he said he
decided early in his full term — a
term he won in 1964 over
Republican U.S. Sen. Barry
Goldwater with a whopping 61
percent of the ballots cast — that
he would not seek another four
years in the White House.
But when he announced that
he would not run for the office
again, he appeared drawn and
tired. Some felt he was fed up
with civil strife sweeping the
nation partly over domestic issues
and partly because of the war, and
that he simply wanted out.
Johnson flew from the White
House to retirement on his ranch
when Richard Nixon became
president. The ex-president rarely
appeared in public his first two
years out of office and even less
frequently permitted interviews.
One of his few ventures back into
the limelight came in May 1971
when, with the help of President
Nixon, he dedicated the new
Lyndon B. Johnson Presidential
Library in a spectacular galal
lasting several days
He agreed to tape a series of
television interviews with CBS
reviewing his years in office. In
these he divulged that it was his
Secretary of State- Dean Rusk who
had advocated the cessation of
bombing in North Vietnam, that
he was sorely disappointed that
the war had not ended and that he
felt his administration had been
undermined by some former staff
member of the late President
Kennedy during the transition
period in which he assumed the
presidency.

Congress. He also initiated the war
on poverty and the Great Society,
a collection of domestic societal
programs, many of which liberal
Democrats had fought for
unsuccessfully since Franklin D.
Roosevelt.
It was Roosevelt who was
Johnson's political mentor. "He
was like a daddy to me," Johnson
often said.

Johnson announced his plans
for the Great Society in a
commencement address at the
University of Texas on May 30,
1964. "I intend to try and achieve
a broad national consensus which
can end obstructionand paralysis
and liberate the energies of the
nation for the work of the
future."
1965 Inaugural
In his inaugural address of
1965 — one of the shortest in
history — Johnson vowed to
overcome poverty, sickness and
ignorance. And he told the world:
"We aspire to nothing that
belongs to others. We seek no
dominion over our fellow man,
but man's dominion over tyranny
and misery."
The first American troops were
sent to South Vietnam in
February of that year, however.
Escalation of the war actually had
begun in August the previous year
when Communist boats attacked
U.S. ships in the Gulf of Tonkin
and Johnson gained congressional
approval of a resolution granting
him full support for "all necessary
action to protect our armed
forces."
In April, 1965 Johnson

provoked a storm of criticism
when he announced that 400 U.S.
Marines had been sent into Santo
Domingo to protect Americans
caught in a Dominican Republic
government upheaval.
The Texan's first year in office
on an elected basis also was
marked by the arrests and
brutality in Selma, Ala., when
Negroes sought to register to vote.
The trouble brought a proposal
from Johnson that Congress enact
the voting rights act.
It is ironic that Johnson was
responsible for more legislation to
help Negroes than any president
since Abraham Lincoln. Yet his
administration was marred by
black rioting.
He sponsored massive aid to
education. Yet college unrest and
attacks broke out as never before
in the nation's history.
Johnson's years in the White
House also saw the weddings of
both of his daughters — Luci, who
as a converted Catholic was
married in a church, and Lynda
who was married in the White
House.
No Second Term
He stunned the nation when he
announced in March, 1968 that he
would not seek a second elected
term and also said that he had
ordered a partial halt to U.S.
bombing of North Vietnam.
His avowed reason for failing
to seek the office in 1968 was
that he wished to devote full time
for the remainder of his term,
without the distractions of
campaigning, to ending the
Vietnam War.
At another time, he said he
decided early in his full term — a
term he won in 1964 over
Republican U.S. Sen. Barry
Goldwater with a whopping 61
percent of the ballots cast — that
he would not seek another four
years in the White House.
But when he announced that
he would not run for the office
again, he appeared drawn and
tired. Some felt he was fed up
with civil strife sweeping the
nation partly over domestic issues
and partly because of the war, and
that he simply wanted out.
Johnson flew from the White
House to retirement on his ranch
when Richard Nixon became
president. The ex-president rarely
appeared in public his first two
years out of office and even less
frequently permitted interviews.
One of his few ventures back into
the limelight came in May 1971
when, with the help of President
Nixon, he dedicated the new
Lyndon B. Johnson Presidential
Library in a spectacular galal
lasting several days
He agreed to tape a series of
television interviews with CBS
reviewing his years in office. In
these he divulged that it was his
Secretary of State- Dean Rusk who
had advocated the cessation of
bombing in North Vietnam, that
he was sorely disappointed that
the war had not ended and that he
felt his administration had been
undermined by some former staff
member of the late President
Kennedy during the transition
period in which he assumed the
presidency.
From the Associated Press
Lyndon Baines Johnson, the
nation's 36th president, held
office during the stormiest
domestic times since the Civil War
and declined to run for a second
full term.
The Stonewall, Tex., native
who combined a folksy manner
with a will of iron that he used in
the Congress and in the White
House to bend legislators his way,
presided over the buildup of the
Vietnam war.
And it was the war that many
said led to his announcement in
March of 1968 that he would not
run for another full term. At the
same time, Johnson announced a
halt in the U.S. bombing of North
Vietnam above the 19th Parallel
and set in motion the machinery
that led to the Paris peace talks.
Lyndon Johnson was born
August 27, 1908. After he
finished high school, he showed
no interest in further education or
a career.
Johnson's parents persuaded
him to enter Southwest State
Teachers College at San Marcos,
Texas. After he graduated, he
taught debate in high school.
In 1934 Johnson married

Claudia Alta Taylor — known as
Lady Bird. One year later
President Franklin D. Roosevelt
appointed him director of the
National Youth Administration
for Texas.
Johnson was elected to the
U.S. House of Representatives in
1937. He tried and lost for the
U.S. Senate in 1941. He was
finally elected to the Senate in
1948 and became majority leader
in 1954.
Johnson had sought the
Democratic nomination for
president which Kennedy won in
1960. And when Kennedy asked
the Texas to be his running mate,
Johnson agreed, although he knew
he would be surrendering his
powerful place as Senate majority
leader for th£ traditional
obscurity of the vice presidency.
Low Profile Veep
As vice president, he presided
routinely over the Senate. He did
not use that position as he had
used the majority leader's role to
dynamically force legislation
through Congress.
Neither did he use his talents as
a great legislative persuader, arm
twister and compromiser after he
became vice president.

Thrust into the White House
after the assassination of John F.
Kennedy on Nov. 22, 1963 in
Dallas, Tex., he succeeded the
man he challenged for the 1960
nomination. He was elected to a
full term by a landslide in 1964.
The first Southerner to hold
the presidency since 1865,
Johnson was one of the strongest
advocates of civil rights
legislation, both during his more
than two decades in Congress and
while he was in the White House.
Sweeping Developments
Johnson's administration was
marked by sweeping
developments in the field of civil
rights, Social Security, aid to
education, and housing and
development.
He proposed the voting rights
act later enacted by the 89th
Congress. He also initiated the war
on poverty and the Great Society,
a collection of domestic societal
programs, many of which liberal

unsuccessfully since Franklin D.

he would not seek another four
years in the White House.
But when he announced that
he would not run for the office
again, he appeared drawn and
tired. Some felt he was fed up
with civil strife sweeping the
nation partly over domestic issues
and partly because of the war, and
that he simply wanted out.
Johnson flew from the White
House to retirement on his ranch

president. The ex-president rarely

when, with the help of President

television interviews with CBS
reviewing his years in office. In
these he divulged that it was his

the war had not ended and that he
felt his administration had been

member of the late President

presidency.
From the Associated Press
Lyndon Baines Johnson, the
nation's 36th president, held
office during the stormiest
domestic times since the Civil War
and declined to run for a second
full term.
The Stonewall, Tex., native
who combined a folksy manner
with a will of iron that he used in
the Congress and in the White
House to bend legislators his way,
presided over the buildup of the
Vietnam war.
And it was the war that many
said led to his announcement in
March of 1968 that he would not
run for another full term. At the
same time, Johnson announced a
halt in the U.S. bombing of North
Vietnam above the 19th Parallel
and set in motion the machinery
that led to the Paris peace talks.
Lyndon Johnson was born
August 27, 1908. After he
finished high school, he showed
no interest in further education or
a career.
Johnson's parents persuaded
him to enter Southwest State
Teachers College at San Marcos,
Texas. After he graduated, he
taught debate in high school.
In 1934 Johnson married

Claudia Alta Taylor — known as
Lady Bird. One year later
President Franklin D. Roosevelt
appointed him director of the
National Youth Administration
for Texas.
Johnson was elected to the
U.S. House of Representatives in
1937. He tried and lost for the
U.S. Senate in 1941. He was
finally elected to the Senate in
1948 and became majority leader
in 1954.
Johnson had sought the
Democratic nomination for
president which Kennedy won in
1960. And when Kennedy asked
the Texas to be his running mate,
Johnson agreed, although he knew
he would be surrendering his
powerful place as Senate majority
leader for th£ traditional
obscurity of the vice presidency.
Low Profile Veep
As vice president, he presided
routinely over the Senate. He did
not use that position as he had
used the majority leader's role to
dynamically force legislation
through Congress.
Neither did he use his talents as
a great legislative persuader, arm
twister and compromiser after he
became vice president.

Thrust into the White House
after the assassination of John F.
Kennedy on Nov. 22, 1963 in
Dallas, Tex., he succeeded the
man he challenged for the 1960
nomination. He was elected to a
full term by a landslide in 1964.
The first Southerner to hold
the presidency since 1865,
Johnson was one of the strongest
advocates of civil rights
legislation, both during his more
than two decades in Congress and
while he was in the White House.
Sweeping Developments
Johnson's administration was
marked by sweeping
developments in the field of civil
rights, Social Security, aid to
education, and housing and
development.
He proposed the voting rights
act later enacted by the 89th
Congress. He also initiated the war
on poverty and the Great Society,
a collection of domestic societal
programs, many of which liberal
Democrats had fought for
unsuccessfully since Franklin D.
Roosevelt.
It was Roosevelt who was
Johnson's political mentor. "He
was like a daddy to me," Johnson
often said.

Johnson announced his plans
for the Great Society in a
commencement address at the
University of Texas on May 30,
1964. "I intend to try and achieve
a broad national consensus which
can end obstructionand paralysis
and liberate the energies of the
nation for the work of the
future."
1965 Inaugural
In his inaugural address of
1965 — one of the shortest in
history — Johnson vowed to
overcome poverty, sickness and
ignorance. And he told the world:
"We aspire to nothing that
belongs to others. We seek no
dominion over our fellow man,
but man's dominion over tyranny
and misery."
The first American troops were
sent to South Vietnam in
February of that year, however.
Escalation of the war actually had
begun in August the previous year
when Communist boats attacked
U.S. ships in the Gulf of Tonkin
and Johnson gained congressional
approval of a resolution granting
him full support for "all necessary
action to protect our armed
forces."
In April, 1965 Johnson

provoked a storm of criticism
when he announced that 400 U.S.
Marines had been sent into Santo
Domingo to protect Americans
caught in a Dominican Republic
government upheaval.
The Texan's first year in office
on an elected basis also was
marked by the arrests and
brutality in Selma, Ala., when
Negroes sought to register to vote.
The trouble brought a proposal
from Johnson that Congress enact
the voting rights act.
It is ironic that Johnson was
responsible for more legislation to
help Negroes than any president
since Abraham Lincoln. Yet his
administration was marred by
black rioting.
He sponsored massive aid to
education. Yet college unrest and
attacks broke out as never before
in the nation's history.
Johnson's years in the White
House also saw the weddings of
both of his daughters — Luci, who
as a converted Catholic was
married in a church, and Lynda
who was married in the White
House.
No Second Term
He stunned the nation when he
announced in March, 1968 that he
would not seek a second elected
term and also said that he had
ordered a partial halt to U.S.
bombing of North Vietnam.
His avowed reason for failing
to seek the office in 1968 was
that he wished to devote full time
for the remainder of his term,
without the distractions of
campaigning, to ending the
Vietnam War.
At another time, he said he
decided early in his full term — a
term he won in 1964 over
Republican U.S. Sen. Barry
Goldwater with a whopping 61
percent of the ballots cast — that
he would not seek another four
years in the White House.

powerful place as Senate majority
leader for th£ traditional
obscurity of the vice presidency.
Low Profile Veep
As vice president, he presided
routinely over the Senate. He did
not use that position as he had
used the majority leader's role to
dynamically force legislation
through Congress.
Neither did he use his talents as
a great legislative persuader, arm
twister and compromiser after he
became vice president.

Thrust into the White House
after the assassination of John F.
Kennedy on Nov. 22, 1963 in
Dallas, Tex., he succeeded the
man he challenged for the 1960
nomination. He was elected to a
full term by a landslide in 1964.
The first Southerner to hold
the presidency since 1865,
Johnson was one of the strongest
advocates of civil rights
legislation, both during his more
than two decades in Congress and
while he was in the White House.
Sweeping Developments
Johnson's administration was
marked by sweeping
developments in the field of civil
rights, Social Security, aid to
education, and housing and
development.
He proposed the voting rights
act later enacted by the 89th
Congress. He also initiated the war
on poverty and the Great Society,
a collection of domestic societal
programs, many of which liberal
Democrats had fought for
unsuccessfully since Franklin D.
Roosevelt.
It was Roosevelt who was
Johnson's political mentor. "He
was like a daddy to me," Johnson
often said.

Johnson announced his plans
for the Great Society in a
commencement address at the
University of Texas on May 30,
1964. "I intend to try and achieve
a broad national consensus which
can end obstructionand paralysis
and liberate the energies of the
nation for the work of the
future."
1965 Inaugural
In his inaugural address of
1965 — one of the shortest in
history — Johnson vowed to
overcome poverty, sickness and
ignorance. And he told the world:
"We aspire to nothing that
belongs to others. We seek no
dominion over our fellow man,
but man's dominion over tyranny
and misery."
The first American troops were
sent to South Vietnam in
February of that year, however.
Escalation of the war actually had
begun in August the previous year
when Communist boats attacked
U.S. ships in the Gulf of Tonkin
and Johnson gained congressional
approval of a resolution granting
him full support for "all necessary
action to protect our armed
forces."
In April, 1965 Johnson

provoked a storm of criticism
when he announced that 400 U.S.
Marines had been sent into Santo
Domingo to protect Americans
caught in a Dominican Republic
government upheaval.
The Texan's first year in office
on an elected basis also was
marked by the arrests and
brutality in Selma, Ala., when
Negroes sought to register to vote.
The trouble brought a proposal
from Johnson that Congress enact
the voting rights act.
It is ironic that Johnson was
responsible for more legislation to
help Negroes than any president
since Abraham Lincoln. Yet his
administration was marred by
black rioting.
He sponsored massive aid to
education. Yet college unrest and
attacks broke out as never before
in the nation's history.
Johnson's years in the White
House also saw the weddings of
both of his daughters — Luci, who
as a converted Catholic was
married in a church, and Lynda
who was married in the White
House.
No Second Term
He stunned the nation when he
announced in March, 1968 that he
would not seek a second elected
term and also said that he had
ordered a partial halt to U.S.
bombing of North Vietnam.
His avowed reason for failing
to seek the office in 1968 was
that he wished to devote full time
for the remainder of his term,
without the distractions of
campaigning, to ending the
Vietnam War.
At another time, he said he
decided early in his full term — a
term he won in 1964 over
Republican U.S. Sen. Barry
Goldwater with a whopping 61
percent of the ballots cast — that
he would not seek another four
years in the White House.
But when he announced that
he would not run for the office
again, he appeared drawn and
tired. Some felt he was fed up
with civil strife sweeping the
nation partly over domestic issues
and partly because of the war, and
that he simply wanted out.
Johnson flew from the White
House to retirement on his ranch
when Richard Nixon became
president. The ex-president rarely
appeared in public his first two
years out of office and even less
frequently permitted interviews.
One of his few ventures back into
the limelight came in May 1971
when, with the help of President
Nixon, he dedicated the new
Lyndon B. Johnson Presidential
Library in a spectacular galal
lasting several days
He agreed to tape a series of
television interviews with CBS
reviewing his years in office. In
these he divulged that it was his
Secretary of State- Dean Rusk who
had advocated the cessation of
bombing in North Vietnam, that
he was sorely disappointed that
the war had not ended and that he
felt his administration had been
undermined by some former staff
member of the late President
Kennedy during the transition
period in which he assumed the
presidency.
