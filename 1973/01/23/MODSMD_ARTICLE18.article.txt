# Faculty Discipline Rules Enacted
## 
### 
Protection against
.self-incrimination and witness
rights identical to those in
California civil lawsuits are
included in new procedural rules
for faculty disciplinary hearings at
Stanford.
Now in effect, the rules were
promulgated by the Advisory
Board, a group of seven full
professors elected by the
Academic Council.
The procedures were developed
in accord with a new Statement
on Faculty Discipline, approved
bv the Academic Council last fall
and enacted by the Board of
Trustees earlier this month.
The hearing rules will become
final unless vetoed by the Faculty
Senate at either of its next two
regularly scheduled meetings, Jan.
25 and Feb. 8.
In a transmittal note to the
Senate, Advisory Board Secretary
Sanford M. Dombusch said the
procedures "are the product of
sustained consultation with the
President, your Steering

Committee, and last year's
Advisory Board," which heard the
case of former Prof. H. Bruce
Franklin.
Hearing Officers
The rules provide for the
Advisory Board to establish a list
of five or more hearing officers,
none employed by the University
and all holding a law degree. The
individual chosen to hear a
particular case by the Board may
be subject to a peremptory
challenge by the defendant or by
the University President, and to
additional challenges for cause
which shall be resolved by the
Board.
Members of the Advisory
Board themselves may be subject
to challenge for cause in writing
by either side. Following
consultation with other Board
members, the challenged
individual decides whether or not
to withdraw. Any resulting
vacancies are then filled by
alternates from the previous
faculty election.
The defendant has the right to
be represented by counsel in all
stages of any proceedings resulting
from the filing of charges by the
University President.
After being charged, the
individual has the right to request
an Advisory Board hearing, to
choose between a public or a
private hearing, and to submit a
written request for financial
assistance in preparing a defense.
Hearings
If factual statements in the
charges are disputed, an
evidentiary hearing is held by an
outside officer. The Advisory
Board determines what issues of
historical fact are relevant to the
charges and are in dispute. It
transmits these in writing to both
parties and the hearing officer.
"Under no circumstances shall
the respondent be required to
testify," the rules state. "If he
elects to testify, he shall be
subject to cross examination only
on the subject or subjects entering
his direct testimony."
Witnesses are guaranteed the
privilege against sdlf-incrimination
in answer to any question and
"any other privilege accorded a
witness in a civil lawsuit in a
California State court."
In addition, witnesses are
guaranteed 1) "the privilege not
to divulge a confidential
communication from a University
employee or student made with
the understanding of all parties to
the communication that it would
be kept confidential and 2) the
privilege not to divulge
information which is confidential
in the context of his appropriate
function in the University."
While the hearing officer "shall

not be bound by formal rules of
evidence," only testimony
deemed "competent and relevant"
shall be admitted. The hearing
itself "shall be conducted for the
purpose of reaching a conclusion"
on the issues of historical fact
listed by the Advisory Board.
In reaching conclusions, the
hearing officer "shall place upon
the President the burden of proof
by highly persuasive evidence,"
the rules state.
If hearings are disrupted, the
presiding officer has the authority
"to exclude, temporarily or
permanently, a person he believes
to have committed acts of
disruption," including parties to
the case and their counsel.
After receiving the hearing
officer's report, the Advisory
Board chairman shall set a date
for a final hearing before the
board itself.
Written briefs may then be
submitted, arguing on 1) any
previous ruling of the hearing
officer or Advisory Board,
provided there was a recorded
objection, 2) whether findings of
fact by the hearing officer are
supported by "substantial
evidence," 3) whether a violation
of faculty disciplinary standards
has taken place, and 4) whether
the sanction proposed by the
President when the charges were
filed is appropriate.
Final Hearings
'The schedule for the final
hearing will provide each party
with no more than one day for
final oral argument," the rules
state. 'The parties will be allotted
equal time." By majority vote, the
Advisory Board may extend
various time limits stated in the
procedural rules in an individual
case.
Conclusions and decisions of
the Board transmitted to the
University President must be by a
majority vote of the entire group.
Individual serving on the Board
when the charges are filed shall
serve throughout the case. They
may elect a chairman and
vice-chairman from among their
members for purposes of handling
the disciplinary proceedings.
Prof. Lee J. Cronbach,
education, serves as Advisory
Board chairman for 1972-73.
Prof. Robert A. Chase, surgery, is
vice-chairman, and Prof.
Dornbusch is secretary. Other
current members are Prof. Walter
E. Meyerhof, chairman of physics;
Gerald J. Lieberman, chairman of
operations research; Wolfgang
Panofsky, director of the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center; and

Robert McAfee Brown, religion.
In an interview with campus
radio station KZSU Tuesday,
President Richard W. Lyman
pointed out that the Statement on
Faculty Discipline was "not
initiated or dominated by the
Administration." Steps leading to
the change began more than two
years ago with the Stanford
chapter of the American
Association of University
Professors, following a national
AAUP statement on faculty
freedom and responsibility.
Noteworthy Changes
Lyman said he felt the most
noteworthy changes in the new
system were 1) the use of outside
hearing officers, 2) greater
specificity concerning the grounds
on which charges could be
brought, and 3) new limitations
on Presidential powers at the end
of the process, following the
Advisory Board decision.
He said there was
"substantially no change" in the
President's power to initiate
disciplinary proceedings, except
that the grounds for bringing
charges were more specific. This
does not "constitute a new risk"
to the faculty, he maintained.
Use of outside hearing officers
were introduced in student
disciplinary cases at Stanford last
year, when outside arbitrators also
were first used in employee
grievance procedures.
The Senate Steering
Committee has placed the rules on
the agenda as a report from the
Advisory Board, primarily for
information of Senate members,
according to Academic Secretary
H. Donald Winbigler. The Steering
Committee has invited Prof.
Cronbach and others he may
designate to attend the Senate
meeting, respond to questions,
and participate in discussion.
In the opinion of the Steering
Committee, the language of the
Statement on Faculty Discipline
precludes such actions as
adopting, approving, or amending
the rules.
"This leaves the Senate two
primary alternatives," Winbigler
notes. "These are: 1) a veto of the
rule, with or without a statement
of reasons for the veto, or 2) no
action, or some parliamentary
equivalent, such as postponement
until expiration of the period for
veto, which would allow the rules
to stand as promulgated."
The Steering Committee has
recommended that no action be
taken, thus allowing the rules to
become final.

the respondent be required to
testify," the rules state. "If he
elects to testify, he shall be
subject to cross examination only
on the subject or subjects entering
his direct testimony."
Witnesses are guaranteed the
privilege against sdlf-incrimination
in answer to any question and
"any other privilege accorded a
witness in a civil lawsuit in a
California State court."
In addition, witnesses are
guaranteed 1) "the privilege not
to divulge a confidential
communication from a University
employee or student made with
the understanding of all parties to
the communication that it would
be kept confidential and 2) the
privilege not to divulge
information which is confidential
in the context of his appropriate
function in the University."
While the hearing officer "shall

not be bound by formal rules of
evidence," only testimony
deemed "competent and relevant"
shall be admitted. The hearing
itself "shall be conducted for the
purpose of reaching a conclusion"
on the issues of historical fact
listed by the Advisory Board.
In reaching conclusions, the
hearing officer "shall place upon
the President the burden of proof
by highly persuasive evidence,"
the rules state.
If hearings are disrupted, the
presiding officer has the authority
"to exclude, temporarily or
permanently, a person he believes
to have committed acts of
disruption," including parties to
the case and their counsel.
After receiving the hearing
officer's report, the Advisory
Board chairman shall set a date
for a final hearing before the
board itself.
Written briefs may then be
submitted, arguing on 1) any
previous ruling of the hearing
officer or Advisory Board,
provided there was a recorded
objection, 2) whether findings of
fact by the hearing officer are
supported by "substantial
evidence," 3) whether a violation
of faculty disciplinary standards
has taken place, and 4) whether
the sanction proposed by the
President when the charges were
filed is appropriate.
Final Hearings
'The schedule for the final
hearing will provide each party
with no more than one day for
final oral argument," the rules
state. 'The parties will be allotted
equal time." By majority vote, the
Advisory Board may extend
various time limits stated in the
procedural rules in an individual
case.
Conclusions and decisions of
the Board transmitted to the
University President must be by a
majority vote of the entire group.
Individual serving on the Board
when the charges are filed shall
serve throughout the case. They
may elect a chairman and
vice-chairman from among their
members for purposes of handling
the disciplinary proceedings.
Prof. Lee J. Cronbach,
education, serves as Advisory
Board chairman for 1972-73.
Prof. Robert A. Chase, surgery, is
vice-chairman, and Prof.
Dornbusch is secretary. Other
current members are Prof. Walter
E. Meyerhof, chairman of physics;
Gerald J. Lieberman, chairman of
operations research; Wolfgang
Panofsky, director of the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center; and

Robert McAfee Brown, religion.
In an interview with campus
radio station KZSU Tuesday,
President Richard W. Lyman
pointed out that the Statement on
Faculty Discipline was "not
initiated or dominated by the
Administration." Steps leading to
the change began more than two
years ago with the Stanford
chapter of the American
Association of University
Professors, following a national
AAUP statement on faculty
freedom and responsibility.
Noteworthy Changes
Lyman said he felt the most
noteworthy changes in the new
system were 1) the use of outside
hearing officers, 2) greater
specificity concerning the grounds
on which charges could be
brought, and 3) new limitations
on Presidential powers at the end
of the process, following the
Advisory Board decision.
He said there was
"substantially no change" in the
President's power to initiate
disciplinary proceedings, except
that the grounds for bringing
charges were more specific. This
does not "constitute a new risk"
to the faculty, he maintained.
Use of outside hearing officers
were introduced in student
disciplinary cases at Stanford last
year, when outside arbitrators also
were first used in employee
grievance procedures.
The Senate Steering
Committee has placed the rules on
the agenda as a report from the
Advisory Board, primarily for
information of Senate members,
according to Academic Secretary
H. Donald Winbigler. The Steering
Committee has invited Prof.
Cronbach and others he may
designate to attend the Senate
meeting, respond to questions,
and participate in discussion.
In the opinion of the Steering
Committee, the language of the
Statement on Faculty Discipline
precludes such actions as
adopting, approving, or amending
the rules.
"This leaves the Senate two
primary alternatives," Winbigler
notes. "These are: 1) a veto of the
rule, with or without a statement
of reasons for the veto, or 2) no
action, or some parliamentary
equivalent, such as postponement
until expiration of the period for
veto, which would allow the rules
to stand as promulgated."
The Steering Committee has
recommended that no action be
taken, thus allowing the rules to
become final.
Protection against
.self-incrimination and witness
rights identical to those in
California civil lawsuits are
included in new procedural rules
for faculty disciplinary hearings at
Stanford.
Now in effect, the rules were
promulgated by the Advisory
Board, a group of seven full
professors elected by the
Academic Council.
The procedures were developed
in accord with a new Statement
on Faculty Discipline, approved
bv the Academic Council last fall
and enacted by the Board of
Trustees earlier this month.
The hearing rules will become
final unless vetoed by the Faculty
Senate at either of its next two
regularly scheduled meetings, Jan.
25 and Feb. 8.
In a transmittal note to the
Senate, Advisory Board Secretary
Sanford M. Dombusch said the
procedures "are the product of
sustained consultation with the
President, your Steering

Committee, and last year's
Advisory Board," which heard the
case of former Prof. H. Bruce
Franklin.
Hearing Officers
The rules provide for the
Advisory Board to establish a list
of five or more hearing officers,
none employed by the University
and all holding a law degree. The
individual chosen to hear a
particular case by the Board may
be subject to a peremptory
challenge by the defendant or by
the University President, and to
additional challenges for cause
which shall be resolved by the
Board.
Members of the Advisory
Board themselves may be subject
to challenge for cause in writing
by either side. Following
consultation with other Board
members, the challenged
individual decides whether or not
to withdraw. Any resulting
vacancies are then filled by
alternates from the previous
faculty election.
The defendant has the right to
be represented by counsel in all
stages of any proceedings resulting
from the filing of charges by the
University President.
After being charged, the
individual has the right to request
an Advisory Board hearing, to
choose between a public or a
private hearing, and to submit a
written request for financial
assistance in preparing a defense.
Hearings
If factual statements in the
charges are disputed, an
evidentiary hearing is held by an
outside officer. The Advisory
Board determines what issues of
historical fact are relevant to the
charges and are in dispute. It
transmits these in writing to both
parties and the hearing officer.
"Under no circumstances shall
the respondent be required to
testify," the rules state. "If he
elects to testify, he shall be
subject to cross examination only
on the subject or subjects entering

University President must be by a
majority vote of the entire group.
Individual serving on the Board
when the charges are filed shall
serve throughout the case. They
may elect a chairman and
vice-chairman from among their
members for purposes of handling
the disciplinary proceedings.
Prof. Lee J. Cronbach,
education, serves as Advisory
Board chairman for 1972-73.
Prof. Robert A. Chase, surgery, is
vice-chairman, and Prof.
Dornbusch is secretary. Other
current members are Prof. Walter
E. Meyerhof, chairman of physics;
Gerald J. Lieberman, chairman of
operations research; Wolfgang
Panofsky, director of the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center; and

Robert McAfee Brown, religion.
In an interview with campus
radio station KZSU Tuesday,
President Richard W. Lyman
pointed out that the Statement on
Faculty Discipline was "not
initiated or dominated by the
Administration." Steps leading to
the change began more than two
years ago with the Stanford
chapter of the American
Association of University
Professors, following a national
AAUP statement on faculty
freedom and responsibility.
Noteworthy Changes
Lyman said he felt the most
noteworthy changes in the new
system were 1) the use of outside
hearing officers, 2) greater
specificity concerning the grounds
on which charges could be
brought, and 3) new limitations
on Presidential powers at the end
of the process, following the
Advisory Board decision.
He said there was
"substantially no change" in the
President's power to initiate
disciplinary proceedings, except
that the grounds for bringing
charges were more specific. This
does not "constitute a new risk"
to the faculty, he maintained.
Use of outside hearing officers
were introduced in student
disciplinary cases at Stanford last
year, when outside arbitrators also
were first used in employee
grievance procedures.
The Senate Steering
Committee has placed the rules on
the agenda as a report from the
Advisory Board, primarily for
information of Senate members,
according to Academic Secretary
H. Donald Winbigler. The Steering
Committee has invited Prof.
Cronbach and others he may
designate to attend the Senate
meeting, respond to questions,
and participate in discussion.
In the opinion of the Steering
Committee, the language of the
Statement on Faculty Discipline
precludes such actions as
adopting, approving, or amending
the rules.
"This leaves the Senate two
primary alternatives," Winbigler
notes. "These are: 1) a veto of the
rule, with or without a statement
of reasons for the veto, or 2) no
action, or some parliamentary
equivalent, such as postponement
until expiration of the period for
veto, which would allow the rules
to stand as promulgated."
The Steering Committee has
recommended that no action be
taken, thus allowing the rules to
become final.
Protection against
.self-incrimination and witness
rights identical to those in
California civil lawsuits are
included in new procedural rules
for faculty disciplinary hearings at
Stanford.
Now in effect, the rules were
promulgated by the Advisory
Board, a group of seven full
professors elected by the
Academic Council.
The procedures were developed
in accord with a new Statement
on Faculty Discipline, approved
bv the Academic Council last fall
and enacted by the Board of
Trustees earlier this month.
The hearing rules will become
final unless vetoed by the Faculty
Senate at either of its next two
regularly scheduled meetings, Jan.
25 and Feb. 8.
In a transmittal note to the
Senate, Advisory Board Secretary
Sanford M. Dombusch said the
procedures "are the product of
sustained consultation with the
President, your Steering

Committee, and last year's
Advisory Board," which heard the
case of former Prof. H. Bruce
Franklin.
Hearing Officers
The rules provide for the
Advisory Board to establish a list
of five or more hearing officers,
none employed by the University
and all holding a law degree. The
individual chosen to hear a
particular case by the Board may
be subject to a peremptory
challenge by the defendant or by
the University President, and to
additional challenges for cause
which shall be resolved by the
Board.
Members of the Advisory
Board themselves may be subject
to challenge for cause in writing
by either side. Following
consultation with other Board
members, the challenged
individual decides whether or not
to withdraw. Any resulting
vacancies are then filled by
alternates from the previous
faculty election.
The defendant has the right to
be represented by counsel in all
stages of any proceedings resulting
from the filing of charges by the
University President.
After being charged, the
individual has the right to request
an Advisory Board hearing, to
choose between a public or a
private hearing, and to submit a
written request for financial
assistance in preparing a defense.
Hearings
If factual statements in the
charges are disputed, an
evidentiary hearing is held by an
outside officer. The Advisory
Board determines what issues of
historical fact are relevant to the
charges and are in dispute. It
transmits these in writing to both
parties and the hearing officer.
"Under no circumstances shall
the respondent be required to
testify," the rules state. "If he
elects to testify, he shall be
subject to cross examination only
on the subject or subjects entering
his direct testimony."
Witnesses are guaranteed the
privilege against sdlf-incrimination
in answer to any question and
"any other privilege accorded a
witness in a civil lawsuit in a
California State court."
In addition, witnesses are
guaranteed 1) "the privilege not
to divulge a confidential
communication from a University
employee or student made with
the understanding of all parties to
the communication that it would
be kept confidential and 2) the
privilege not to divulge
information which is confidential
in the context of his appropriate
function in the University."
While the hearing officer "shall

not be bound by formal rules of
evidence," only testimony
deemed "competent and relevant"
shall be admitted. The hearing
itself "shall be conducted for the
purpose of reaching a conclusion"
on the issues of historical fact
listed by the Advisory Board.
In reaching conclusions, the
hearing officer "shall place upon
the President the burden of proof
by highly persuasive evidence,"
the rules state.
If hearings are disrupted, the
presiding officer has the authority
"to exclude, temporarily or
permanently, a person he believes
to have committed acts of
disruption," including parties to
the case and their counsel.
After receiving the hearing
officer's report, the Advisory
Board chairman shall set a date
for a final hearing before the
board itself.
Written briefs may then be
submitted, arguing on 1) any
previous ruling of the hearing
officer or Advisory Board,
provided there was a recorded
objection, 2) whether findings of
fact by the hearing officer are
supported by "substantial
evidence," 3) whether a violation
of faculty disciplinary standards
has taken place, and 4) whether
the sanction proposed by the
President when the charges were
filed is appropriate.
Final Hearings
'The schedule for the final
hearing will provide each party
with no more than one day for
final oral argument," the rules
state. 'The parties will be allotted
equal time." By majority vote, the
Advisory Board may extend
various time limits stated in the
procedural rules in an individual
case.
Conclusions and decisions of
the Board transmitted to the
University President must be by a
majority vote of the entire group.

adopting, approving, or amending
the rules.
"This leaves the Senate two
primary alternatives," Winbigler
notes. "These are: 1) a veto of the
rule, with or without a statement
of reasons for the veto, or 2) no
action, or some parliamentary
equivalent, such as postponement
until expiration of the period for
veto, which would allow the rules
to stand as promulgated."
The Steering Committee has
recommended that no action be
taken, thus allowing the rules to
become final.
Protection against
.self-incrimination and witness
rights identical to those in
California civil lawsuits are
included in new procedural rules
for faculty disciplinary hearings at
Stanford.
Now in effect, the rules were
promulgated by the Advisory
Board, a group of seven full
professors elected by the
Academic Council.
The procedures were developed
in accord with a new Statement
on Faculty Discipline, approved
bv the Academic Council last fall
and enacted by the Board of
Trustees earlier this month.
The hearing rules will become
final unless vetoed by the Faculty
Senate at either of its next two
regularly scheduled meetings, Jan.
25 and Feb. 8.
In a transmittal note to the
Senate, Advisory Board Secretary
Sanford M. Dombusch said the
procedures "are the product of
sustained consultation with the
President, your Steering

Committee, and last year's
Advisory Board," which heard the
case of former Prof. H. Bruce
Franklin.
Hearing Officers
The rules provide for the
Advisory Board to establish a list
of five or more hearing officers,
none employed by the University
and all holding a law degree. The
individual chosen to hear a
particular case by the Board may
be subject to a peremptory
challenge by the defendant or by
the University President, and to
additional challenges for cause
which shall be resolved by the
Board.
Members of the Advisory
Board themselves may be subject
to challenge for cause in writing
by either side. Following
consultation with other Board
members, the challenged
individual decides whether or not
to withdraw. Any resulting
vacancies are then filled by
alternates from the previous
faculty election.
The defendant has the right to
be represented by counsel in all
stages of any proceedings resulting
from the filing of charges by the
University President.
After being charged, the
individual has the right to request
an Advisory Board hearing, to
choose between a public or a
private hearing, and to submit a
written request for financial
assistance in preparing a defense.
Hearings
If factual statements in the
charges are disputed, an
evidentiary hearing is held by an
outside officer. The Advisory
Board determines what issues of
historical fact are relevant to the
charges and are in dispute. It
transmits these in writing to both
parties and the hearing officer.
"Under no circumstances shall
the respondent be required to
testify," the rules state. "If he
elects to testify, he shall be
subject to cross examination only
on the subject or subjects entering
his direct testimony."
Witnesses are guaranteed the
privilege against sdlf-incrimination
in answer to any question and
"any other privilege accorded a
witness in a civil lawsuit in a
California State court."
In addition, witnesses are
guaranteed 1) "the privilege not
to divulge a confidential
communication from a University
employee or student made with
the understanding of all parties to
the communication that it would
be kept confidential and 2) the
privilege not to divulge
information which is confidential
in the context of his appropriate
function in the University."
While the hearing officer "shall

not be bound by formal rules of
evidence," only testimony
deemed "competent and relevant"
shall be admitted. The hearing
itself "shall be conducted for the
purpose of reaching a conclusion"
on the issues of historical fact
listed by the Advisory Board.
In reaching conclusions, the
hearing officer "shall place upon
the President the burden of proof
by highly persuasive evidence,"
the rules state.
If hearings are disrupted, the
presiding officer has the authority
"to exclude, temporarily or
permanently, a person he believes
to have committed acts of
disruption," including parties to
the case and their counsel.
After receiving the hearing
officer's report, the Advisory
Board chairman shall set a date
for a final hearing before the
board itself.
Written briefs may then be
submitted, arguing on 1) any
previous ruling of the hearing
officer or Advisory Board,
provided there was a recorded
objection, 2) whether findings of
fact by the hearing officer are
supported by "substantial
evidence," 3) whether a violation
of faculty disciplinary standards
has taken place, and 4) whether
the sanction proposed by the
President when the charges were
filed is appropriate.
Final Hearings
'The schedule for the final
hearing will provide each party
with no more than one day for
final oral argument," the rules
state. 'The parties will be allotted
equal time." By majority vote, the
Advisory Board may extend
various time limits stated in the
procedural rules in an individual
case.
Conclusions and decisions of
the Board transmitted to the
University President must be by a
majority vote of the entire group.
Individual serving on the Board
when the charges are filed shall
serve throughout the case. They
may elect a chairman and
vice-chairman from among their
members for purposes of handling
the disciplinary proceedings.
Prof. Lee J. Cronbach,
education, serves as Advisory
Board chairman for 1972-73.
Prof. Robert A. Chase, surgery, is
vice-chairman, and Prof.
Dornbusch is secretary. Other
current members are Prof. Walter
E. Meyerhof, chairman of physics;
Gerald J. Lieberman, chairman of
operations research; Wolfgang
Panofsky, director of the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center; and

Robert McAfee Brown, religion.
In an interview with campus
radio station KZSU Tuesday,
President Richard W. Lyman
pointed out that the Statement on
Faculty Discipline was "not
initiated or dominated by the
Administration." Steps leading to
the change began more than two
years ago with the Stanford
chapter of the American
Association of University
Professors, following a national
AAUP statement on faculty
freedom and responsibility.
Noteworthy Changes
Lyman said he felt the most
noteworthy changes in the new
system were 1) the use of outside
hearing officers, 2) greater
specificity concerning the grounds
on which charges could be
brought, and 3) new limitations
on Presidential powers at the end
of the process, following the
Advisory Board decision.
He said there was
"substantially no change" in the
President's power to initiate
disciplinary proceedings, except
that the grounds for bringing
charges were more specific. This
does not "constitute a new risk"
to the faculty, he maintained.
Use of outside hearing officers
were introduced in student
disciplinary cases at Stanford last
year, when outside arbitrators also
were first used in employee
grievance procedures.
The Senate Steering
Committee has placed the rules on
the agenda as a report from the
Advisory Board, primarily for
information of Senate members,
according to Academic Secretary
H. Donald Winbigler. The Steering
Committee has invited Prof.
Cronbach and others he may
designate to attend the Senate
meeting, respond to questions,
and participate in discussion.
In the opinion of the Steering
Committee, the language of the
Statement on Faculty Discipline
precludes such actions as
adopting, approving, or amending
the rules.
"This leaves the Senate two
primary alternatives," Winbigler
notes. "These are: 1) a veto of the
rule, with or without a statement
of reasons for the veto, or 2) no
action, or some parliamentary
equivalent, such as postponement
until expiration of the period for
veto, which would allow the rules
to stand as promulgated."
The Steering Committee has
recommended that no action be
taken, thus allowing the rules to
become final.
