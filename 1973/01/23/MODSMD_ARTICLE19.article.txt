# Bears Defeat Wrestlers, 32-12
## 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
The fact that the athletic
department forgot to bring in
enough chairs for Saturday's
wrestling meet against
Cal-Berkeley was only the first of
Stanford's problems.
Although the Cardinals lost
32-12, the 100 or so spectators,
about half of whom didn't get a
seat, certainly got their share of
excitement in the meet.
One interesting battle occurred
in the heavyweight division, where
Art Estrada of Stanford won by
forfeit after Jon Culpepper took a
swing at him.
Estrada had dominated the
first period, nearly gaining a pin
when time ran out. Culpepper
came back strong in the second
period, nearly pinning Estrada.
Both periods were rough and
exciting.
The third period was
ridiculous, as Culpepper decided
that if he couldn't win any other

way, he'd do it by forearming his
opponent, among other illegal
tactics. Finally, with Culpepper
acting more like a pro wrestler
than a college one, the match was
stopped.
Another thrilling aspect of the
meet was the performance of
blind Bobby Sweetman at 126
pounds. After being ahead by
only 6-5 after two periods,
Sweetman ripped into his
opponent in the third period.

scoring 11 points to win 17-8.
Sweetman has been very
impressive recently, but has on
several occasions lost points
because his takedowns have taken
place off the mat.
The only other Stanford
wrestler to win was Chris Horpel
at 150 pounds, who won 11-6
despite a questionable reversal
called by the referee.
The rest of the meet was bleak

for the home team. Cal showed
real strength at most weight
divisions. The Bears' Bob McNiel
(142) and Mike Mclntyre (177)
looked particularly good.
Stanford's dual meet record
now stands at 1-3, excluding two
forfeit victories. Prospects for
immediate improvement do not
look much better, as Cal Poly, the
nation's top NCAA-college
division team, comes to Encina
Gym at 7:30 Tuesday evening.

PACKING THEM IN — The Incomparable Roger "Wood" Cowan leaps high in an attempt to block an
extra point attempt by Duke's David Wright in Stanford's 1971 9-3 loss to the Blue Devils. The Athletic
Department has announced plans to build two tunnels on the west side of the field to help the alumni
rooters get to those low seats without walking to the top of the stadium first.
