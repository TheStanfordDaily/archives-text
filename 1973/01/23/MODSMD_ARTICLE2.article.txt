# City Council Resolution Protests Indochina War
## 
### ROBERT BACON SUE KING 
The Palo Alto City Council, amidst
critical shouts from its audience, early
this morning passed a resolution
protesting the Indochina War.
Earlier in its meeting, it had
approved a controversial demolition
moratorium on downtown residential
structures, but sent an equally
controversial apartment manager
licensing ordinance to committee for
study.
The anti-war resolution, introduced
by Councilwoman Enid Pearson, urges
citizens to contribute to the rebuilding
of the bombed-out Bach Mai Hospital
in Hanoi, supports peaceful anti-war
demonstrations, and asks Congress to
cut off war funds before Feb. 28.
The resolution passed 5-4, amid a
clamor of shouts claiming that the
Council ought to donate $50,000 of
city funds to the hospital rebuilding
effort.
No Donation Proposed
Twelve speakers had earlier urged
the latter course to the Council, but
the members relied on an opinion
from City Attorney Peter Stone that
such a donation was forbidden by law.
No such donation was proposed by
any Council member.
Some had asked the Council to
place the question of a gift of public
funds on the May municipal ballot,
but the Council also declined to do
this.
The resolution was the outgrowth
of a stormy hearing two weeks ago at
which the Council decided to consider
further anti-war proposals at last
night's meeting.
Pearson said that the "undeclared,
illegal, immoral war" saps funds that
could be used for social programs, in
presenting her resolution.
Taunts And Shouts
Councilman John Beahrs, amid
taunts and shouts from the audience,
called Pearson's resolution "replete

with specious assumptions." He said
that some of the anti-war speakers in
the audience "were frighteningly
simplistic .... They reminded me of
pre-Munich Britain."
Supporting Pearson's resolution
were Mayor Kirke Comstock, Richard
Rosenbaum, Alan Henderson, and

Sylvia Seman. In opposition were
Beahrs, John Berwald, William Clark,
and Vice Mayor Stanley Norton.
Several of the opponents insisted this
was not a proper subject for council
action.
