approved the $400,000
expenditure.
The two tunnels, measuring 10
feet in height by nine feet in

width, will be bored at ground
level for entry into sections Rand
SS. Points of entry will be at row
32, with a cross aisle spanning six
sections to serve all midfield
seating locations.
According to Young, "We will
be losing about 800 seats with this
construction, but the tunnels will
provide easy access to many good
seating locations in the lower rows
A new official seating capacity

of something less than the present
figure of 87,206 will be
announced shortly. However,
Stanford Stadium, opened in
1921, will continue to be the
largest privately owned facility of
its type for Allege football and
