# Symphony Features Talented Pianist In Memorial Concert
## 
### MARK OREGLIA 
The strong talent in the S.F. Symphony
Orchestra has been somewhat ignored this
season, as attention has focused mostly on
the magnificent guest artists who have
appeared with the orchestra. Wednesday
evening, however, the audience was
overwhelmed by talent from three sources:
not only Maestro Ozawa and pianist
Jean-Philippe Collard, but ilso the orchestra
itself.
The evening commenced with Dvorak's
"Hussite Overture." This patriotic
composition was written in 1883 for a
dramatization of the fourteenth century
Hussite movement in Czechoslovakia to
commemorate Jan Hus, the heroic Hussite
reformer of the Catholic church.
The music is very impressive, encompassing
themes of enlightenment, political suppression
and struggle. If music of this grandeur is to
come across successfully it must be skillfully
conducted, lest it revert to grandiose schmalz.
This Maestro Ozawa accomplished; he was
careful to control the music. His
interpretation remained powerful, yet he did
not let the volume get out of hand.
Within the music's grandeur remained a
definite mortal element, giving to the work
realistic human emotion. The string and
percussion sections performed very well here,
although the brass section played off-key at
several points. The dissonance it created
occasionally came close to ruining an
otherwise fine performance. Fortunately, the
horns improved as the evening progressed.
Memorable Occasion
The orchestra played Arnold Schoenberg's
"Transfigured Night" (Verklaerte Nacht)
amazingly well; in fact, its performance made
the evening a very memorable occasion. This
piece is an early work of Schoenberg,
composed in an effort to preserve the tonal
harmony that Schoenberg felt was being
threatened by the advent of atonal music at

the turn of this century.
"Transfigured Night" is based on a very
moving poem from Richard Drehmels cycle
"Weib und Welt" (Woman and the World),
wherein a moonlit night, love and human
understanding work to transfigure the
desolate and anxiety-ridden world of a lonely
couple into one of wonder, beauty and hope.
Few works have moved me as deeply as
this one; to listen to it is a beautiful emotional
experience. To bring out the beauty of any
music requires quality of performance.
Ozawa's interpretation and the orchestra's
playing allowed this beauty to be gracefully
transmitted. The strings played brilliantly.
The performances of Concertmaster Stuart
Canin and principal violist Rolf Persinger
highlighted the excellent presentation.
Delightful Debut
After intermission the mood changed
drastically, as the orchestra performed Ravel's
delightful and amusing Double-handed
Concerto in G Major. Young French pianist
Jean-Philippe Collard made his American
debut as soloist in this work. He replaced the
late Robert Casadesus who had orignally been
scheduled to perform, and to whom this
Symphony performance was dedicated.
Collard's performance was excellent.
Prominent European critics have predicted a
brilliant future for the 24-year old pianist. He
has been hailed as a potential Horowitz. If
Wednesday's performance was an accurate
indication, I must agree.
There was a tinge of apprehension as the
first movement began, but the audience lost
all doubt as to Collard's ability when he
played the second movement absolutely
beautifully. Collard displayed accuracy, yet
the warmth of interpretation necessary to
make Ravel's composition more than just an
exercise—his sensitivity to Ravel was evident.
The orchestra provided excellent support
for M. Collard. Even the horns succeeded in
most of their difficult music. The orchestra

seemed to lag behind just a little throughout
the first movement. They came back however,
to provide an amazing conclusion to the third
movement. Here, conductor, orchestra and
pianist moved well in phrase with one
another, to succeed in a very critical
movement of the concerto.
Best of Season
It is difficult to say that any one
composition of the evening was the highlight.
From the standpoint of the orchestra,
however, there is no doubt that the
symphony's performance of Ravel's
"Alborada del Gracioso" was the most
splendid. It may well have been their best
played work of the season so far T j
Maestro Ozawa deserved kudos for his
fantastic coordination of the orchestra. As a
result of Ozawa's efforts, the orchestra was
completely in harmony with itself, and in the
control of the conductor.
The music was enhanced by solo
performances by several members of the
orchestra, loosely representing each section of
the orchestra. The new principal basoonist
Ryohei Nakagawa received enthusiastic
applause; the new french horn player, Arthur
Krehbiel, deserved the same.
The other outstanding musicians (in their
usual manner) were principal cellist Robert
Sayre, Violinist Stuart Canin and violist Rolf
Persinger. The new timpanist, Elayne Jones,
also played very well throughout the evening.
"Alborada del Gracioso," which, loosely
translated, means "Morning Song of the
Gentle Fool," was originally composed for
piano. Maestro Ozawa's version sounds
extremely Spanish and vibrant—there is even
an omnipresent clatter of castanettes—whereas
the piano version is quieter and more serious.
Yet, since the orchestra was so well controlled
and sharp, the vigorous Spanish atmosphere
lent itself well to the composition. Ozawa has
a flair for this kind of music. I hope we shall
hear more pieces like it in the future.

and struggle. If music of this grandeur is to
come across successfully it must be skillfully
conducted, lest it revert to grandiose schmalz.
This Maestro Ozawa accomplished; he was
careful to control the music. His
interpretation remained powerful, yet he did
not let the volume get out of hand.
Within the music's grandeur remained a
definite mortal element, giving to the work
realistic human emotion. The string and
percussion sections performed very well here,
although the brass section played off-key at
several points. The dissonance it created
occasionally came close to ruining an
otherwise fine performance. Fortunately, the
horns improved as the evening progressed.
Memorable Occasion
The orchestra played Arnold Schoenberg's
"Transfigured Night" (Verklaerte Nacht)
amazingly well; in fact, its performance made
the evening a very memorable occasion. This
piece is an early work of Schoenberg,
composed in an effort to preserve the tonal
harmony that Schoenberg felt was being
threatened by the advent of atonal music at

the turn of this century.
"Transfigured Night" is based on a very
moving poem from Richard Drehmels cycle
"Weib und Welt" (Woman and the World),
wherein a moonlit night, love and human
understanding work to transfigure the
desolate and anxiety-ridden world of a lonely
couple into one of wonder, beauty and hope.
Few works have moved me as deeply as
this one; to listen to it is a beautiful emotional
experience. To bring out the beauty of any
music requires quality of performance.
Ozawa's interpretation and the orchestra's
playing allowed this beauty to be gracefully
transmitted. The strings played brilliantly.
The performances of Concertmaster Stuart
Canin and principal violist Rolf Persinger
highlighted the excellent presentation.
Delightful Debut
After intermission the mood changed
drastically, as the orchestra performed Ravel's
delightful and amusing Double-handed
Concerto in G Major. Young French pianist
Jean-Philippe Collard made his American
debut as soloist in this work. He replaced the
late Robert Casadesus who had orignally been
scheduled to perform, and to whom this
Symphony performance was dedicated.
Collard's performance was excellent.
Prominent European critics have predicted a
brilliant future for the 24-year old pianist. He
has been hailed as a potential Horowitz. If
Wednesday's performance was an accurate
indication, I must agree.
There was a tinge of apprehension as the
first movement began, but the audience lost
all doubt as to Collard's ability when he
played the second movement absolutely
beautifully. Collard displayed accuracy, yet
the warmth of interpretation necessary to
make Ravel's composition more than just an
exercise—his sensitivity to Ravel was evident.
The orchestra provided excellent support
for M. Collard. Even the horns succeeded in
most of their difficult music. The orchestra

seemed to lag behind just a little throughout
the first movement. They came back however,
to provide an amazing conclusion to the third
movement. Here, conductor, orchestra and
pianist moved well in phrase with one
another, to succeed in a very critical
movement of the concerto.
Best of Season
It is difficult to say that any one
composition of the evening was the highlight.
From the standpoint of the orchestra,
however, there is no doubt that the
symphony's performance of Ravel's
"Alborada del Gracioso" was the most
splendid. It may well have been their best
played work of the season so far T j
Maestro Ozawa deserved kudos for his
fantastic coordination of the orchestra. As a
result of Ozawa's efforts, the orchestra was
completely in harmony with itself, and in the
control of the conductor.
The music was enhanced by solo
performances by several members of the
orchestra, loosely representing each section of
the orchestra. The new principal basoonist
Ryohei Nakagawa received enthusiastic
applause; the new french horn player, Arthur
Krehbiel, deserved the same.
The other outstanding musicians (in their
usual manner) were principal cellist Robert
Sayre, Violinist Stuart Canin and violist Rolf
Persinger. The new timpanist, Elayne Jones,
also played very well throughout the evening.
"Alborada del Gracioso," which, loosely
translated, means "Morning Song of the
Gentle Fool," was originally composed for
piano. Maestro Ozawa's version sounds
extremely Spanish and vibrant—there is even
an omnipresent clatter of castanettes—whereas
the piano version is quieter and more serious.
Yet, since the orchestra was so well controlled
and sharp, the vigorous Spanish atmosphere
lent itself well to the composition. Ozawa has
a flair for this kind of music. I hope we shall
hear more pieces like it in the future.
The strong talent in the S.F. Symphony
Orchestra has been somewhat ignored this
season, as attention has focused mostly on
the magnificent guest artists who have
appeared with the orchestra. Wednesday
evening, however, the audience was
overwhelmed by talent from three sources:
not only Maestro Ozawa and pianist
Jean-Philippe Collard, but ilso the orchestra
itself.
The evening commenced with Dvorak's
"Hussite Overture." This patriotic
composition was written in 1883 for a
dramatization of the fourteenth century
Hussite movement in Czechoslovakia to
commemorate Jan Hus, the heroic Hussite
reformer of the Catholic church.

themes of enlightenment, political suppression
and struggle. If music of this grandeur is to

amazingly well; in fact, its performance made
the evening a very memorable occasion. This
piece is an early work of Schoenberg,
composed in an effort to preserve the tonal
harmony that Schoenberg felt was being
threatened by the advent of atonal music at

the turn of this century.
"Transfigured Night" is based on a very
moving poem from Richard Drehmels cycle
"Weib und Welt" (Woman and the World),
wherein a moonlit night, love and human
understanding work to transfigure the
desolate and anxiety-ridden world of a lonely
couple into one of wonder, beauty and hope.
Few works have moved me as deeply as
this one; to listen to it is a beautiful emotional
experience. To bring out the beauty of any
music requires quality of performance.
Ozawa's interpretation and the orchestra's
playing allowed this beauty to be gracefully
transmitted. The strings played brilliantly.
The performances of Concertmaster Stuart
Canin and principal violist Rolf Persinger
highlighted the excellent presentation.
Delightful Debut
After intermission the mood changed
drastically, as the orchestra performed Ravel's
delightful and amusing Double-handed
Concerto in G Major. Young French pianist
Jean-Philippe Collard made his American
debut as soloist in this work. He replaced the
late Robert Casadesus who had orignally been
scheduled to perform, and to whom this
Symphony performance was dedicated.
Collard's performance was excellent.
Prominent European critics have predicted a
brilliant future for the 24-year old pianist. He
has been hailed as a potential Horowitz. If
Wednesday's performance was an accurate
indication, I must agree.
There was a tinge of apprehension as the
first movement began, but the audience lost
all doubt as to Collard's ability when he
played the second movement absolutely
beautifully. Collard displayed accuracy, yet
the warmth of interpretation necessary to
make Ravel's composition more than just an
exercise—his sensitivity to Ravel was evident.
The orchestra provided excellent support
for M. Collard. Even the horns succeeded in
most of their difficult music. The orchestra

seemed to lag behind just a little throughout
the first movement. They came back however,
to provide an amazing conclusion to the third
movement. Here, conductor, orchestra and
pianist moved well in phrase with one
another, to succeed in a very critical
movement of the concerto.
Best of Season
It is difficult to say that any one
composition of the evening was the highlight.
From the standpoint of the orchestra,
however, there is no doubt that the
symphony's performance of Ravel's
"Alborada del Gracioso" was the most
splendid. It may well have been their best
played work of the season so far T j
Maestro Ozawa deserved kudos for his
fantastic coordination of the orchestra. As a
result of Ozawa's efforts, the orchestra was
completely in harmony with itself, and in the
control of the conductor.
The music was enhanced by solo
performances by several members of the
orchestra, loosely representing each section of
the orchestra. The new principal basoonist
Ryohei Nakagawa received enthusiastic
applause; the new french horn player, Arthur
Krehbiel, deserved the same.
The other outstanding musicians (in their
usual manner) were principal cellist Robert
Sayre, Violinist Stuart Canin and violist Rolf
Persinger. The new timpanist, Elayne Jones,
also played very well throughout the evening.
"Alborada del Gracioso," which, loosely
translated, means "Morning Song of the
Gentle Fool," was originally composed for
piano. Maestro Ozawa's version sounds
extremely Spanish and vibrant—there is even
an omnipresent clatter of castanettes—whereas
the piano version is quieter and more serious.
Yet, since the orchestra was so well controlled
and sharp, the vigorous Spanish atmosphere
lent itself well to the composition. Ozawa has
a flair for this kind of music. I hope we shall
hear more pieces like it in the future.
The strong talent in the S.F. Symphony
Orchestra has been somewhat ignored this
season, as attention has focused mostly on
the magnificent guest artists who have
appeared with the orchestra. Wednesday
evening, however, the audience was
overwhelmed by talent from three sources:
not only Maestro Ozawa and pianist
Jean-Philippe Collard, but ilso the orchestra
itself.
The evening commenced with Dvorak's
"Hussite Overture." This patriotic
composition was written in 1883 for a
dramatization of the fourteenth century
Hussite movement in Czechoslovakia to
commemorate Jan Hus, the heroic Hussite
reformer of the Catholic church.
The music is very impressive, encompassing
themes of enlightenment, political suppression
and struggle. If music of this grandeur is to
come across successfully it must be skillfully
conducted, lest it revert to grandiose schmalz.
This Maestro Ozawa accomplished; he was
careful to control the music. His
interpretation remained powerful, yet he did
not let the volume get out of hand.
Within the music's grandeur remained a
definite mortal element, giving to the work
realistic human emotion. The string and
percussion sections performed very well here,
although the brass section played off-key at
several points. The dissonance it created
occasionally came close to ruining an
otherwise fine performance. Fortunately, the
horns improved as the evening progressed.
