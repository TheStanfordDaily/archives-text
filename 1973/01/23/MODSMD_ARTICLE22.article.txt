# 'Odyssey' Captures Epic Spirit
## 
### JEFFERY SEGAL 
"Sing in me, Muse, and
through me tell the story of that
man skilled in all ways of
contending."
Those words begin both the
great Greek epic poem, the
Odyssey, and the ambitious free
adaptation of Homer's tale as a
play, magnificently produced last
weekend in the Nitery under the
direction of its creator, Ph.D.
candidate in dramatic literature,
Ellen Mease.
The Odyssey relates the deeds
of the Greek hero, Odysseus,
during his twenty years of
wandering on the way home from
the War at Troy. The poem itself
is a massive literary work; an
adaptation could easily have been
made overly verbose and
extremely dull. Instead,
Mease's adaptation captures the
very essence of this dynamic
action tale in a vibrant production
stirringly executed by a skillful
cast.
The poem itself was
transmitted originally orally, not
graphically, and the merit of the

work depended on the skill of the
storyteller in using Homer's rich
descriptions as keys to conjuring
up images of great actions in the
listener's mind.
With this in mind, Mease
staged her production to try to
stimulate the imaginations of her
audience in much the same
fashion. The action occurs on
black plastic covered levels, a
rugged terrain of flexible
neutrality, with audience on two
sides and white material draped
on the two other walls. Onto
those drapings are continually
projected slides of colors, images,
places, and people, to keep the
atmosphere awash with views
from the mind's eye.
Scenes flow smoothly and
rapidly into one another like a
stream of consciousness, shaped
and punctuated by percussion
instruments such as a gong,
chimes, and wood blocks.
The ensemble serves both as
individual actors and as a chorus.
They provide a perpetual
background of sight, sound, and
words that act to unify and

intensify the main action being
depicted on stage. They help
create and sustain the feeling that
what is being seen comes from the
spectator's own imagination
stimulated by Homer's
magnificent poetry.
Improvisation
Relying little on props or
costumes, the actors improvise
what they need, from ships to
shawls, by the ingenious use of a
few lengths of material. The
ensemble works together
beautifully, never letting the show
drag for a moment. Only the first
of the three acts has any
structural problems and resultant
performance drawbacks. The
introductory scenes confuse the
action more than set it, take a
little too long for transitions, and
lack coherency for a viewer
unfamiliar with the tale. But the
last two acts more than
compensate for this.
Although nearly every member
of the cast plays several roles, and
all of them do so very well, a few
actors deserve particular citation.
In a show such as this the
ensemble as a whole is
all-important. The greatest overall
contribution to the show in this
respect is made by Ron Ross. An
actor of groat versatility, whether
as a member of the chorus or in a
solo characterization such as
Polyphemus the cyclops, a harpy,
cr the ghost of a dead soldier, his
energy is always at its peak, his
focus precise, and sensory work
outstanding. He places no
restraints on his emotions or his
body and commits himself totally
to the requirements of his
character at the moment.
Also especially noteworthy was

Carol Bunker, playing the story's
most alluring women, Circe and
Calypso. Although Bunker
possesses a beauty to rival any
goddess in Olympus, she is not
just a pretty face. Deliciously
sensual and irresistably powerful,
she has great range, control and
subtlety as an actress that makes
her truly a pleasure to watch.
Personal Charms
Eric Booth Miller, who
performed the nearly impossible
task of making Count Orsino
likeable in the University
Theater's production of "Twelfth
Night" earlier this year, played
Odysseus. The handsome, rugged
Miller, clad only in leather
breeches, portrays the cunning,
aggressive hero with the delicate
sensibility and great personal
charm that marks all his
performances. Although at times
he appears to be somewhat more
concerned with listening to what
he is saying than feeling what he is
talking about, his performance is
graced by a professional polish
and appeal.
The others in the cast are Ruth
Ward, an actress of great strength
and intensity, Michael Goldstein,
whose huffing and puffing Aeolus
is brilliant, Michael Hackett, Jane
Seaman, and Susie Malouf.
The production is part of the
Drama 200 series which augments
the four play season of classics on
the University Theater schedule.
The next show in the series will be
the English language premiere of
"The Breakdown," by
Durrenmatt, and translated and
directed by Donald Bowman, on
February 1, 2, and 3. Admission to
all the Drama 200 productions is
free.
