# New Art Show At Gallery
## 
### 
An exhibition of recent works by Richard Randell is now open in
the Stanford Art Gallery. All the sculptures in the exhibition were
made in 1972 and represent the second stage of a series of works
initiated in 1971.
The pieces are executed in PPG 50112 mass-cast polyester, a
material that comes from the industrial manufacturer as a thick liquid
and is cast in a metal and wood mold and finished with a high
transparent gloss.
The plastic works in the show are of various sizes and proportions
based on only two different shapes that appear in several variations: a
rectangle and a rainbow-like shape. The main technical concern of the
artist is with the control of color hues and shades within a very
limited array of shapes.
Richard Randell moved to California from Minneapolis in 1966. He
first taught at Sacramento State College. He has been a faculty
member of the Art Department at Stanford since 1968.
The show will be on view at the Gallery through March 4. The Art
Gallery is open every day except Monday from 10 till 5 on weekdays
