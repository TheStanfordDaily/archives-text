# Brilliant 'New Music'
## 
### MICHAEL SAFFLE 
Speculum Musicae, a group of
talented young New York
virtuosi, presented an intelligent
and dramatic modern music
concert before a small but
enthusiastic Dinkelspiel audience
last Sunday afternoon.
Medieval philosophers believed
that mathematical proportions
discovered in natural objects, the
human body, and even the orbits
of heavenly bodies were imitated
in that hierarchy of musical
intervals and complex
compositional procedures popular
with intellectuals in their own
day. From this view comes the
term speculum musicae— musical
mirror'—which, during the later
Middle Ages, epitomized attitudes
that produced elaborately
structured works supposedly
reflecting the 'music of the
spheres.'
Speculum Musicae's eight
members chose their group's name
not because of keen interest in
antiquity, but because today's
composers are once again writing
"Medieval" music reflecting
mathematical processes; they
create music organized in
uniquely complex ways which (in
some cases) mirrors natural and
even celestial numerical processes.
Fred Sherry, cellist and
sometime conductor for the
ensemble, believes that "highly
organized music is the germinal
force behind future musical
development." Speculum's other
members, including flutist Paul
Duekel and Donald Palma, bass,
find the improvised chaos popular
with John Cage and other
aleatoric composers rather old
hat.
Prefer 'Serial'
While occasionally playing
modern 'classics' by Stravinski,
Ravel, and Bartok, Speculum
members prefer playing works
written after World War ll—heady,
totally organized 'serial
compositions' by Karlheinz
Stockhausen, Stefan Wolpe, and
others.
Charles Wuorinen's "Speculum
Speculi," composed especially for
the group last year, proved the
concert's most exhilerating
experience. "Mirror's mirror" is
an apt title for a composition
which blends rigid serial
organization with unique
opportunities for individual
instrumentalists to strut their
stuff.
Wuorinen's piece, written for
flute, oboe, bass clarinet, bass,
piano, and percussion, starts
quietly but builds to a
tremendous climax of clashing
gongs and swirling woodwinds,
with every possibility for
virtuosity explored. The group
gave it a dazzling performance.

Richard Fitz' accurate and
sensitive percussion display was
particularly noteworthy.
Dashing Rendition
American composer Elliott
Carter's "Sonata for Flute, Oboe,
Cello, and Harpsichord" also
received a dashing rendition. A
complex work which parodies
both Baroque trio sonata and
early twentieth-century
Expressionistic cliches, Carter's
sonata is frequently enchanting,
occasionally mannered and
artificial. Joel Marangella, oboist,
played expressively, while
harpsichordist Ursula Oppens
played with dash and rhythmic
accuracy. Unfortunately, the
Stanford harpsichord used is a
rather lifeless instrument; cloudy
bass notes and unclear registration
changes marred Oppens'
performance.
The group presented Bela
Bartok's famous "contrasts for
Clarinet, Violin, and Piano"
competently, if a little less
satisfactorily. Speculum members
seem more at home with
contemporary musical rhetoric
than with Bartok's music, which
features naive folk-songs mixed
with broad, Romantic passages.
Violinist Eugene Drucker

played a brilliant cadenza in the
final movement, but Virgil
Blackwell's clarinet performance
was sometimes vague, his tone
frequently breathy.
A less taxing work, Charles
Wuorinen's colorful arrangement
of the "Glogauer Liederbuch," a
fifteenth-century collection of
part-songs for violin, flute,
clarinet, and cello which opened
the program, was brilliantly
performed. Wuorinen's rich
arrangement reminds one of
Schoenberg's orchestrations of
Bach fugues, preserving musical
structure at the expense of
old-fashioned timbre.
So excellent a concert simply
should have had more publicity
and a larger audience. Although a
number of people seemed to think
this "modern stuff" is pretty ugly
and totally confusing (one could
overhear them arguing during the
intermissions), controversy is
beginning to subside and several
of these avant-garde compositions
have already become fairly
popular. Get out and hear a little
of what's happening on the
modern musical scene when
Speculum Musicae returns next
year. If you don't like it, at least
you won't forget it!

they will perform at Flint Center at 8:30, on Saturday at the Masonic Auditorium at 8:30, and on Sunday

of the "Glogauer Liederbuch," a
fifteenth-century collection of
part-songs for violin, flute,
clarinet, and cello which opened
the program, was brilliantly
performed. Wuorinen's rich
arrangement reminds one of
Schoenberg's orchestrations of
Bach fugues, preserving musical
structure at the expense of
old-fashioned timbre.
So excellent a concert simply
should have had more publicity
and a larger audience. Although a
number of people seemed to think
this "modern stuff" is pretty ugly
and totally confusing (one could
overhear them arguing during the
intermissions), controversy is
beginning to subside and several
of these avant-garde compositions
have already become fairly
popular. Get out and hear a little
of what's happening on the
modern musical scene when
Speculum Musicae returns next
year. If you don't like it, at least
you won't forget it!

Speculum Musicae, a group of
talented young New York
virtuosi, presented an intelligent
and dramatic modern music
concert before a small but
enthusiastic Dinkelspiel audience
last Sunday afternoon.
Medieval philosophers believed
that mathematical proportions
discovered in natural objects, the
human body, and even the orbits
of heavenly bodies were imitated
in that hierarchy of musical
intervals and complex
compositional procedures popular
with intellectuals in their own
day. From this view comes the
term speculum musicae— musical
mirror'—which, during the later
Middle Ages, epitomized attitudes
that produced elaborately
structured works supposedly
reflecting the 'music of the
spheres.'
Speculum Musicae's eight
members chose their group's name
not because of keen interest in
antiquity, but because today's
composers are once again writing
"Medieval" music reflecting
mathematical processes; they
create music organized in
uniquely complex ways which (in
some cases) mirrors natural and
even celestial numerical processes.
Fred Sherry, cellist and
sometime conductor for the
ensemble, believes that "highly
organized music is the germinal
force behind future musical
development." Speculum's other
members, including flutist Paul
Duekel and Donald Palma, bass,
find the improvised chaos popular
with John Cage and other
aleatoric composers rather old
hat.
Prefer 'Serial'
While occasionally playing
modern 'classics' by Stravinski,
Ravel, and Bartok, Speculum
members prefer playing works
written after World War ll—heady,
totally organized 'serial
compositions' by Karlheinz
Stockhausen, Stefan Wolpe, and
others.
Charles Wuorinen's "Speculum
Speculi," composed especially for
the group last year, proved the
concert's most exhilerating
experience. "Mirror's mirror" is
an apt title for a composition
which blends rigid serial
organization with unique
opportunities for individual
instrumentalists to strut their
stuff.
Wuorinen's piece, written for
flute, oboe, bass clarinet, bass,
piano, and percussion, starts
quietly but builds to a
tremendous climax of clashing
gongs and swirling woodwinds,
with every possibility for
virtuosity explored. The group
gave it a dazzling performance.

Richard Fitz' accurate and
sensitive percussion display was
particularly noteworthy.
Dashing Rendition
American composer Elliott
Carter's "Sonata for Flute, Oboe,
Cello, and Harpsichord" also
received a dashing rendition. A
complex work which parodies
both Baroque trio sonata and
early twentieth-century
Expressionistic cliches, Carter's
sonata is frequently enchanting,
occasionally mannered and
artificial. Joel Marangella, oboist,
played expressively, while
harpsichordist Ursula Oppens
played with dash and rhythmic
accuracy. Unfortunately, the
Stanford harpsichord used is a
rather lifeless instrument; cloudy
bass notes and unclear registration
changes marred Oppens'
performance.
The group presented Bela
Bartok's famous "contrasts for
Clarinet, Violin, and Piano"
competently, if a little less
satisfactorily. Speculum members
seem more at home with
contemporary musical rhetoric
than with Bartok's music, which
features naive folk-songs mixed
with broad, Romantic passages.
Violinist Eugene Drucker

played a brilliant cadenza in the
final movement, but Virgil
Blackwell's clarinet performance
was sometimes vague, his tone
frequently breathy.

sensitive percussion display was
particularly noteworthy.
Dashing Rendition
American composer Elliott
Carter's "Sonata for Flute, Oboe,
Cello, and Harpsichord" also
received a dashing rendition. A
complex work which parodies
both Baroque trio sonata and
early twentieth-century
Expressionistic cliches, Carter's
sonata is frequently enchanting,
occasionally mannered and
artificial. Joel Marangella, oboist,
played expressively, while
harpsichordist Ursula Oppens
played with dash and rhythmic
accuracy. Unfortunately, the
Stanford harpsichord used is a
rather lifeless instrument; cloudy
bass notes and unclear registration
changes marred Oppens'
performance.
The group presented Bela
Bartok's famous "contrasts for
Clarinet, Violin, and Piano"
competently, if a little less
satisfactorily. Speculum members
seem more at home with
contemporary musical rhetoric
than with Bartok's music, which
features naive folk-songs mixed
with broad, Romantic passages.
Violinist Eugene Drucker

played a brilliant cadenza in the
final movement, but Virgil
Blackwell's clarinet performance
was sometimes vague, his tone
frequently breathy.
A less taxing work, Charles
Wuorinen's colorful arrangement
of the "Glogauer Liederbuch," a
fifteenth-century collection of
part-songs for violin, flute,
clarinet, and cello which opened
the program, was brilliantly
performed. Wuorinen's rich
arrangement reminds one of
Schoenberg's orchestrations of
Bach fugues, preserving musical
structure at the expense of
old-fashioned timbre.
So excellent a concert simply
should have had more publicity
and a larger audience. Although a
number of people seemed to think
this "modern stuff" is pretty ugly
and totally confusing (one could
overhear them arguing during the
intermissions), controversy is
beginning to subside and several
of these avant-garde compositions
have already become fairly
popular. Get out and hear a little
of what's happening on the
modern musical scene when
Speculum Musicae returns next
year. If you don't like it, at least
you won't forget it!
