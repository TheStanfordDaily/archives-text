Cease-Fire Tomorrow?
PARIS — Henry A. Kissinger arrived last night for what
may be his final negotiating session with Hanoi's Le Due
Tho on a Vietnam cease-fire agreement.
The U.S. presidential adviser made no statement after
his flight from Andrews Air Force Base near Washington,
and went directly to a meeting with Foreign Minister Tran
Van Lam of South Vietnam.
In Washington, Secretary of Defense Melvin R. Laird
hinted to newsmen that a cease-fire agreement would be
initialed tomorrow.
After dedicating a Pentagon corridor to the memory of
an Air Force general, Laird was asked by reporters for
information on the return of prisoners of war.
"We've told you all that we can until after
Wednesday," Laird replied.
It was perhaps the firmest clue yet that tomorrow is
the target date for initialing an accord.
The same day also was cited as the initialing date in
Communist high-command documents reported captured
in South Vietnam Sunday.
These were among the bits of evidence cropping up at
home and abroad to reinforce reports by sources that
Nixon has set a timetable of concluding a Vietnam
agreement this week.
American officials said Kissinger would confer with
Lam again this morning prior to his first meeting with Tho
in the International Conference Center near the Arc de
Triumphe.
Fierce Fighting Near Saigon
SAIGON — North Vietnamese troops have inflicted heavy
losses on South Vietnamese forces in the Michelin rubber
plantation northwest of Saigon.
Fighting has raged there for several days despite talk of
an early cease-fire in the capital, only 40 miles away.
As reports from the battle area were put together
yesterday, there were strong indications two South
Vietnamese battalions were decimated and relief forces
were systematically ambushed as they moved forward.
A senior military official called the fighting the biggest
single battle in the 112. igon region since An Loc was
attacked last spring.
Military sources reported government casualties in the
operation between Jan. 13 and Sunday as 80 killed, 245
wounded and at least 40 missing.
Westmoreland Report Examined
LOS ANGELES — A high Army staff official contended
at the Pentagon Papers trnl yesterday that a report on the
Vietnam war written by Gen. William Westmoreland and
published by the U.S. government could have been of ust
to the North Vietnamese if it fell into their hands.
Lt. Gen. William DePuy made that statement on cross
examination as the defense drew similarities between the
Westmoreland report and another report which was

classified Top Secret and later released to the public by
Daniel Ellsberg and Anthony Russo.
The document by Westmoreland, former commander
of U.S. troops in Vietnam, included an assessment of the
1968 Tet offensive. Another report on that offensive,
written by former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
Earle Wheeler, was marked top secret. The Westmoreland
report, published by the government printing office in
1969, could have been bought by anyone for $6, DePuy
conceeded earlier.
Watergate Wiretapping Confusion
WASHINGTON — The man who said he listened to
wiretapped conversations from Democratic headquarters
testified yesterday he thought it was legal because his
orders came from the security chief of President Nixon's
reelection committee.
"Weren't you suspicious that some hanky-panky was
going on, that something was wrong when he told you to
use an assumed name?" Judge John J. Sirica asked the
witness, Alfred C. Baldwin, 111, at the Watergate trial.
"Not the use of an assumed name, no sir, your honor,"
said Baldwin, a former FBI agent who once taught police
science.
Baldwin, the prosecution's star witness, was on the
stand for the third day as the third week of trial began for
G. Gordon Liddy and James W. McCord Jr., charged with
conspiracy, burglary and illegal wiretapping in a case
involving a break-in at Democratic headquarters last June.
Baldwin had said he was recruited by McCord to
monitor conversations from his hotel room across the
street from Democratic headquarters in the Watergate
building.
He had said he saw a letter McCord wrote to the
Federal Communications Commission requesting the use
of certain radio frequencies and that he had received
permission. He st'd that, as well as McCord's position with
the reelection committee, were factors in believing the
activities were legal.
