# Cavalli-Sforza, Shockley, X Debate Tonight
## 
### VLAE KERSHNER JOANNE JACOBS 
Electrical Engineering Prof. William
Shockley will debate his controversial
views on race and intelligence with
Cedic X (Clark), assistant professor of
psychology, and L.L. Cavalli-Sforza,
genetics professor, tonight at 7:30 in
Memorial Auditorium.
Each participant will have 45
minutes to discuss "The Nature of
Heritability of I.Q. and Its Social,
Economic and Political Implications."
After a ten minute rebuttal period for
each panelist, the meeting will be
opened for comments and questions
from the audience, which will be
limited to one minute each.
Psychology Prof. Philip Zimbardo
arranged the forum on behalf of the
Psychology Department's Colloquium
Committee. Zimbardo will serve as
timekeeper for the debate, while
Statistics Prof. Herman Chernoff will
act as moderator.
Shockley, who won a Nobel Prize
in physics in 1956 for his work in the
invention of the transistor, lectured
last night in Skilling Auditorium
before an orderly crowd of about 90
people.
The purpose of the lecture was to
present analytical considerations
supporting the arguments he will make
this evening. Specifically, Shockley
spoke on (1) his hypothesis that 80
percent of intelligence, as measured by
IQ tests, is genetically determined and

(2) his belief that it is possible to
estimate the percentage of Caucasian
ancestry in American Negro
populations.
Identical Twins
In order to prove the genetic nature
of IQ, Shockley used studies made of
identical twins reared apart in the
U.S., Canada, and Denmark. He
attempted to show that the IQ's of the
pairs were as close together as could be
expected if 80 percent of intelligence
is genetically determined, as he claims.
Responding to a question, Shockley
cited evidence purporting to show that
IQ tests measure the quality of life, a
major point in his argument that in
general, the Negro population is
genetically inferior to the Caucasian
population and that all persons with
IQ's below 100 should be paid to be
voluntarily sterilized.
He cited evidence from a study of
California children during the 19205,
which, followed up after the children
had become adults, produced,
according to Shockley, a ".5
correlation between childhood IQ and
eventual income," and also "positive
correlations between high IQ and
lower levels of divorce, alcoholism,
and jail sentences."
Shockley then began his sec r >. i
argument, claiming that a legitim.. e
way of measuring the percentage of
Caucasian heritage in the American
Negro exists.
