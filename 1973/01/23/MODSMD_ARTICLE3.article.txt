# Cavalli-Sforza, Shockley, X Debate Tonight
## 
### VLAE KERSHNER JOANNE JACOBS 
Electrical Engineering Prof. William
Shockley will debate his controversial
views on race and intelligence with
Cedic X (Clark), assistant professor of
psychology, and L.L. Cavalli-Sforza,
genetics professor, tonight at 7:30 in
Memorial Auditorium.
Each participant will have 45
minutes to discuss "The Nature of
Heritability of I.Q. and Its Social,
Economic and Political Implications."
After a ten minute rebuttal period for
each panelist, the meeting will be
opened for comments and questions
from the audience, which will be
limited to one minute each.
Psychology Prof. Philip Zimbardo
arranged the forum on behalf of the
Psychology Department's Colloquium
Committee. Zimbardo will serve as
timekeeper for the debate, while
Statistics Prof. Herman Chernoff will
act as moderator.
Shockley, who won a Nobel Prize
in physics in 1956 for his work in the
invention of the transistor, lectured
last night in Skilling Auditorium
before an orderly crowd of about 90
people.
The purpose of the lecture was to
present analytical considerations
supporting the arguments he will make
this evening. Specifically, Shockley
spoke on (1) his hypothesis that 80
percent of intelligence, as measured by
IQ tests, is genetically determined and

(2) his belief that it is possible to
estimate the percentage of Caucasian
ancestry in American Negro
populations.
Identical Twins
In order to prove the genetic nature
of IQ, Shockley used studies made of
identical twins reared apart in the
U.S., Canada, and Denmark. He
attempted to show that the IQ's of the
pairs were as close together as could be
expected if 80 percent of intelligence
is genetically determined, as he claims.
Responding to a question, Shockley
cited evidence purporting to show that
IQ tests measure the quality of life, a
major point in his argument that in
general, the Negro population is
genetically inferior to the Caucasian
population and that all persons with
IQ's below 100 should be paid to be
voluntarily sterilized.
He cited evidence from a study of
California children during the 19205,
which, followed up after the children
had become adults, produced,
according to Shockley, a ".5
correlation between childhood IQ and
eventual income," and also "positive
correlations between high IQ and
lower levels of divorce, alcoholism,
and jail sentences."
Shockley then began his sec r >. i
argument, claiming that a legitim.. e
way of measuring the percentage of
Caucasian heritage in the American
Negro exists.

CHALKTALK — Electrical Engineering Prof. William Shockley lectured last
night on technical aspects of his controversial theories on race and intelligence.
Shockley will debate assistant psychology Prof. Cedric X (Clark) and genetics
Prof. L.L. Cavalli-Sforza at 7:30 this evening in Memorial Auditorium.
He cited the Duffy (blood) trait,
which occurs in 43 percent of
American Caucasian genes but not at
all in the genes of members of African
populations in the areas from which
slaves were taken several hundred
years ago.
By taking the percentage of blacks
who have the Duffy trait, T.E. Reed, a
Toronto scientist, has given estimates
of the percentage of Caucasian blood
in a sample of blacks in Oakland,
Shockley said. This serves as the basis
for the measurement of intelligence
compared with racial heritage, a
fundamental Shockley argument not
detailed in the lecture.
According to Black Student Union

Chairman Charles Ogletree, members
of the BSU and the Fruit of Islam will,
at X's request, monitor the debate in
order to ensure orderly conduct.
Shockley and X debated on Dec. 7
at Monterey Peninsula College before
an orderly crowd, but Shockley has
had problems with hecklers in the
past.
Both Shockley and X have prepared
statements for tonight's debate which
will be available to all members of the
audience.
Shockley said that while his
presentation will be largely a
"blackboard" analysis of statistical
data, his written statement covers
many of the ethical and moral questions
raised by his proposals.

years ago.
By taking the percentage of blacks
who have the Duffy trait, T.E. Reed, a
Toronto scientist, has given estimates
of the percentage of Caucasian blood
in a sample of blacks in Oakland,
Shockley said. This serves as the basis
for the measurement of intelligence
compared with racial heritage, a
fundamental Shockley argument not
detailed in the lecture.
According to Black Student Union

Chairman Charles Ogletree, members
of the BSU and the Fruit of Islam will,
at X's request, monitor the debate in
order to ensure orderly conduct.
Shockley and X debated on Dec. 7
at Monterey Peninsula College before
an orderly crowd, but Shockley has
had problems with hecklers in the
past.
Both Shockley and X have prepared
statements for tonight's debate which
will be available to all members of the
audience.
Shockley said that while his
presentation will be largely a
"blackboard" analysis of statistical
data, his written statement covers
many of the ethical and moral questions
raised by his proposals.
Electrical Engineering Prof. William
Shockley will debate his controversial
views on race and intelligence with
Cedic X (Clark), assistant professor of
psychology, and L.L. Cavalli-Sforza,
genetics professor, tonight at 7:30 in
Memorial Auditorium.
Each participant will have 45
minutes to discuss "The Nature of
Heritability of I.Q. and Its Social,
Economic and Political Implications."
After a ten minute rebuttal period for
each panelist, the meeting will be
opened for comments and questions
from the audience, which will be
limited to one minute each.
Psychology Prof. Philip Zimbardo
arranged the forum on behalf of the
Psychology Department's Colloquium
Committee. Zimbardo will serve as
timekeeper for the debate, while
Statistics Prof. Herman Chernoff will
act as moderator.
Shockley, who won a Nobel Prize
in physics in 1956 for his work in the
invention of the transistor, lectured
last night in Skilling Auditorium
before an orderly crowd of about 90
people.
The purpose of the lecture was to
present analytical considerations
supporting the arguments he will make
this evening. Specifically, Shockley
spoke on (1) his hypothesis that 80
percent of intelligence, as measured by
IQ tests, is genetically determined and

(2) his belief that it is possible to
estimate the percentage of Caucasian
ancestry in American Negro
populations.
Identical Twins
In order to prove the genetic nature
of IQ, Shockley used studies made of
identical twins reared apart in the
U.S., Canada, and Denmark. He
attempted to show that the IQ's of the
pairs were as close together as could be
expected if 80 percent of intelligence
is genetically determined, as he claims.
Responding to a question, Shockley
cited evidence purporting to show that
IQ tests measure the quality of life, a
major point in his argument that in
general, the Negro population is
genetically inferior to the Caucasian
population and that all persons with
IQ's below 100 should be paid to be
voluntarily sterilized.
He cited evidence from a study of
California children during the 19205,
which, followed up after the children
had become adults, produced,
according to Shockley, a ".5
correlation between childhood IQ and
eventual income," and also "positive
correlations between high IQ and
lower levels of divorce, alcoholism,
and jail sentences."
Shockley then began his sec r >. i
argument, claiming that a legitim.. e
way of measuring the percentage of
Caucasian heritage in the American
Negro exists.
