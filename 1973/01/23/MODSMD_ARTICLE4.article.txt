# Heated Confrontation With Garry
## Chino Case Pre-Trial Judge Resigns 
### TERRY ANZUR 
San Bernardino Superior Court
Judge Henry Busch, who has been
handling pre-trial motions in the
murder and assault trial of Andrea
Holman and Douglas Benton Burt,
announced he had other court
calendar commitments and literally
walked out of the case yesterday.
Busch made the announcement
shortly after 11 a.m., following a
heated confrontation with defense
attorney Charles Garry over
courtroom security searches, instituted
yesterday for the first time in the
Chino Prison escape case.
The argument started at 10 a.m.
when Garry arrived at the San
Bernardino courthouse with two other
defense attorneys, refused to allow
himself to be searched, and said he
wanted to talk to the judge.
Busch retorted that Garry must
submit to a search if he wanted to
enter the courtroom.
'Standard Procedure'
Everyone, including reporters and
spectators, was searched upon entering
the courtroom. Later, the Court Clerk
for the trial could not explain why the
searches were instituted, explaining
only that they are "a standard
procedure for pre-trial hearings."
Garry continued his corridor
standoff for nearly an hour before he

was allowed inside through a back
entrance. He claimed that he had never
been searched before and charged that
the searches are "not consonant with a
free society, or a free courtroom."
Then Busch told Garry that he
must follow the directive of the court,
said he was reassigning the case to the
presiding judge, and walked out of the
courtroom.
New Judge Assigned
After a 20-minute delay, Presiding
Judge J. Steve Williams entered and
announced he was assigning Judge
Joseph B. Campbell to the pretrial
hearings.
The San Bernardino Court Clerk
confirmed Campbell's appointment to
handle pretrial motions, adding that a
trial judge has not yet been named.
Venceremos members Burt and
Holman, daughter of Medicine Prof.
Halsted Holman, are charged with
murder and assault in connection with
Chino convict Ronald Beaty's prison
escape last Oct. 6. One prison guard
was killed and another wounded by
gunfire in the escape attempt. Beaty
was later recaptured, and Holman and
Burt surrendered to authorities Oct.
23.
Motion Denied
The pair have been denied bail and
are currently being held in Sau
Bernardino County detention

facilities.
Appeals for a change of venue in
the trial have been denied both by
Busch and the State Court of Appeals
in San Bernardino. Holman and Burt,
who claim they will suffer "great,
grievous, and irreparable damage"
unless a change of venue is granted,
appealed last Friday to the State
Supreme Court to move the trial.
In a related development,
investigators unearthed 170 pounds of
dynamite buried near a Little League
baseball field 15 miles south of
Bakersfield.
Beaty, who is serving a life sentence
for the murder of a Chino guard,
directed authorities to the cache of
explosives. He says they were buried

last April by Venceremos for
"revolutionary purposes."
Investigation Continues
Whether Venceremos really buried
the dynamite or made specific plans
for its use is not yet known.
Venceremos leaders have since
denied taking part in the escape plans,
and have repeatedly denounced Beaty
as an "enemy of the people" for
cooperating with authorities.
The San Bernardino Sheriffs
department is continuing to question
Beaty at an undisclosed place of
confinement. Investigators discovered
almost 100 pounds of explosives when
they began digging last Thursday. An
additional 75 pounds of dynamite was
unearthed Friday.
