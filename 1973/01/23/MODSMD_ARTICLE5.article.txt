# High Court Decision Legalizes Abortions
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The Supreme
Court yesterday granted American
women the right to have medical
abortions during the first six months
of pregnancy.
The state may interfere with this
"right of privacy" only in
approximately the last three months,
when the unborn child is developed
enough to live outside the mother, the
court held 7 to 2.
The ruling struck down a Texas law
that made it a crime for a doctor to
end a pregnancy except "for the
purpose of saving the life of the
mother." Thirty other states have
similar laws. All presumably will
become invalid.
At the same time, the court
disapproved, 7 to 2, key provisions of
a Georgia law that allowed medical
abortions only to residents of the state
and said two additional doctors must
concur with the woman's physician.
The court said this
unconstitutionally kept citizens of
other states from using Georgia's
medical facilities and unduly restricted
the rights of pregnant women.
Similar laws in 13 other states will
become invalid as a result.
Justice Harry A. Blackmun spoke
for the majority in rulings that took
more than two years to reach.
Justices Byron R. White and
William H. Rehnquist dissented. White
said, "The court apparently values the
convenience of the pregnant mother
more than the continued existence and
development of the life or potential
life which she carries."
But Blackmun, for the majority,
said the state could cause a pregnant
woman considerable harm by not
allowing her to have an abortion.
Additional and unwanted children
could force a distressful life upon her,
he said. "Mental and physical health
may be taxed by child care," wrote
the 63-vear old former house counsel

for the Mayo clinic in Rochester,
Minn.
For single, pregnant women, he
said, there are "the additional
difficulties and continuing stigma of
unwed motherhood."
On the other hand, Blackmun said,
the mortality rate for women having
abortions in the early stages of
pregnancy apparently are as low or
lower than the rate of normal
childbirth.
Therefore, Blackmun said, while a
pregnant woman does not have "an
absolute constitutional right to an
abortion on her demand," the state
cannot interfere with the judgment of
the woman and her doctor in the first
three months.
In the second three-month period,
all the state may do, he said, is to
regulate abortion procedures in ways
that are "reasonably related to
maternal health," such as supervising
the licensing of physicians, clinics and
hospitals.
But when the fetus becomes viable
— after the 24th to 28th week — state
regulation to protect the unborn child
is important and logical, he said. "If
the state is interested in protecting
fetal life after viability, it may go so
far as to prescribe abortion during that
period except when it is necessary to
preserve the life or health of the
mother," Blackmun wrote.
Blackmun rejected the idea that a
fetus has legal rights which must be
protected by the state. Blackmun said
there is no basis for that theory in the
Constitution and"the unborn have
never been recognized in the law as
person in the whole sense."
Therefore, he said, the woman's
right to privacy must be upheld against
any state interest until the interest
becomes compelling — in generally the
last three months of pregnancy when
mortality in abortion reaches or
surpasses mortality in childbirth.
