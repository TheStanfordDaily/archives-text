## Fire Safety 
### 
When the University removed courtesy telephone extensions from
the fraternity clusters and Row houses recently, a number of residents
complained that removal of these phones created a major fire hazard.
House residents who have been used to making free local calls on
these phones have been exaggerating the danger since there are alarm
boxes outside every fraternity in the clusters and in the vicinity of all
the Row houses.
Fire officials agree that in case of a fire, it is much wiser for people
to get out of a building and pull a box alarm than it is for someone to
stop and phone the Fire Department from inside. People should
always leave a building without delay when a fire breaks out.
Furthermore, when someone pulls a box alarm, fire apparatus is
dispatched immediately to a specific location. When someone calls in
a fire there is always a chance that the person might panic and give an
inaccurate location, a problem which can't occur with a box alarm.
The argument that remuval of these phones creates a serious fire
hazard is very weak.
But this phone controversy did bring to light a serious danger
which exists because there are no internal alarms in the fraternity
clusters. An internal alarm does not summon the Fire Department,
but it performs the crucial function of alerting residents so they can
evacuate the building.
The Row houses arc equipped with such alarms and last summer
following the Lathrop fire, the alarms were supplemented by smoke
detection devices which automatically activate the alarms. But despite
the large amount of concern about fire safety which followed the
Lathrop and Encina fires, University officials apparently didn't feel
that the lack of internal alarms in the clusters constituted a serious
hazard.
Internal alarms in the clusters are not required by the fire code, but
we feel that University officials should have realized long ago that
installation of such alarms is a very wise safety investment.
Fortunately the controversy about the removal of phones has spurred
the University into action concerning the internal alarms, but it is still
hard to understand why the University waited so long before
acknowledgingthe danger.
According to Fire Chief Frank Jurian, engineers will be on campus
this week to make bids on installation of these alarms. University
Director of Residences and Fraternities Alan Cummings feels that a
decision on bids can be made in the very near future and he feels that
the alarm systems can be ordered within 2 to 3 weeks. Jurian and
Cummings agree that the lag between ordering and delivery is
sometimes greater, but they feel that such a delay can't be avoided.
The cost of all the necessary alarms will be approximately $50,000.
Funds are difficult to obtain in a financially overburdened University,
but funding for these alarms must be an absolute top priority.
Cummings reports that maintenance reserves could cover the cost,
but he is hesitant to use these reserve funds. But if other funding
cannot be found, those reserves should be tapped. The safety of
human lives is at stake and funds must be appropriated and these
alarms must be installed as soon as possible.
