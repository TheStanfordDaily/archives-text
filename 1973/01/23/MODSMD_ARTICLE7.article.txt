# 'scientists act like god'
## Geneticity Versus Truth

In the Daily article of Jan. 11,
1973, I was quoted as saying that
"the purpose of the debate is to
make clear to the University
community and to the public at
large that Shockley's views are
fundamentally no different from
(those of) Profs. Pauling, Ehrlich,
or Cavalli-Sforza. . ." Since the
appearance of this article, several
people have asked me to explain
further what I meant. I would like
to take this opportunity to do so,
so far as space permits.
My belief that Professor
Shockley's views are
fundamentally the same as those of
many Stanford professors is based
on the fact that many of them have
gone on public record as being opposed
to the inclusion of the theory of
Divine Creation in California
textbooks. While this act of theirs
may be considered by some as
scientific, rather than political,
this depends on how political (or
scientific) one views the process
of public education.
In any case, the fact remains
that the four Stanford professors
are in substantial agreement on
this controversial issue, while I
disagree with all of them. I further
believe that this issue of Divine
Creation is critical, for unless this
is understood, it is difficult to
understand the role of science in
issues concerning the quality and
quantity problems of human
populations.
Divine Creation
My position is that if a scientist
does not accept the theory of
Divine Creation, then that
scientist can not help but reflect
this in the conduct of his research.
This is particularly true for those
scientists working in the area of
human behavior.
If a scientist does not believe
that man has the spark of Divinity
within him, it is quite easy for
him to entertain the notion that a
small group of men have the right
to determine which of the other
groups should be encouraged to
reproduce. In effect, this disbelief
allows some scientists to act as
though they were God.
My position is that man is
something more than that which
is indicated by his genetic
make-up; and since we do not yet
fully understand what this
"something more" is, it is
arrogant and presumptuous of us
to feel that the present state of
scientific knowledge is sufficient
for us to decide which people
have "diseases" or "genetic
weaknesses" and should,
therefore, be discouraged from
further reproduction.
Identity Problems
When you say to a group of
people (e.g., those carrying the
sickle-cell trait) that no more of
their kind is desired, you are in
fact telling that person that he is

not desired. Since, psychologically
speaking, a man identifies himself
by the recognition of his kind,
scientists are largely responsible
for the various "identity
problems" suffered by members
of the general population. Telling
a person that no more of his kind
is desired is not a sign of moral
concern, nor benign neglect; it is,
simply, the most academically
respected sign of racial hatred.
If those scientists who presume
to possess enough knowledge to
tell others who they should and
should not marry were truly
motivated by concern and love for
people, they would pay as much
attention towards solving the
problem of sterility among black
geniuses as they would towards
the problem of over-population
among the black non-geniuses. If
"improvement" of the black race
were truly the source of scientific
motivation, then our newspapers
would carry as many stories
encouraging birth among some
blacks (as opposed to only
discouraging it among others).
Human Nature
But what we find is a one-sided
orientation: elimination of the
least-fit. No mention is ever made
about Government support for

the development of the best of a
particular race; this is probably
because very few whites can
conceive of the possibility that
the best of another race may in
fact be better than the best of
their own race. Some call this
white "racism;" I think that it is
better described as "human
nature" though, admittedly, it is
perhaps the worst aspect of it.
An important issue here
involves how the "best" of any
race is defined. The four scientists
with whom I disagree all subscribe
to some genetic indicator of one
kind or another. My own view is
that it is the divinity of man, as
reflected by his state of spiritual
consciousness, which is the only
yardstick by which some men
should presume to judge the
essential worth of other men. But
science has not yet progressed to
the stage where it can adequately
measure the spiritual
consciousness of man. Unless and
until this stage is reached, any
proposals which put forth genetic
solutions to the human problems
of quality and quantity represent
not the best of science, but the
worst of racial politics.

geniuses as they would towards
the problem of over-population
among the black non-geniuses. If
"improvement" of the black race
were truly the source of scientific
motivation, then our newspapers
would carry as many stories
encouraging birth among some
blacks (as opposed to only
discouraging it among others).
Human Nature
But what we find is a one-sided
orientation: elimination of the
least-fit. No mention is ever made
about Government support for

the development of the best of a
particular race; this is probably
because very few whites can
conceive of the possibility that
the best of another race may in
fact be better than the best of
their own race. Some call this
white "racism;" I think that it is
better described as "human
nature" though, admittedly, it is
perhaps the worst aspect of it.
An important issue here
involves how the "best" of any
race is defined. The four scientists
with whom I disagree all subscribe
to some genetic indicator of one
kind or another. My own view is
that it is the divinity of man, as
reflected by his state of spiritual
consciousness, which is the only
yardstick by which some men
should presume to judge the
essential worth of other men. But
science has not yet progressed to
the stage where it can adequately
measure the spiritual
consciousness of man. Unless and
until this stage is reached, any
proposals which put forth genetic
solutions to the human problems
of quality and quantity represent
not the best of science, but the
worst of racial politics.

In the Daily article of Jan. 11,
1973, I was quoted as saying that
"the purpose of the debate is to
make clear to the University
community and to the public at
large that Shockley's views are
fundamentally no different from
(those of) Profs. Pauling, Ehrlich,
or Cavalli-Sforza. . ." Since the
appearance of this article, several
people have asked me to explain
further what I meant. I would like
to take this opportunity to do so,
so far as space permits.
My belief that Professor
Shockley's views are
fundamentally the same as those of
many Stanford professors is based
on the fact that many of them have
gone on public record as being opposed
to the inclusion of the theory of
Divine Creation in California
textbooks. While this act of theirs
may be considered by some as
scientific, rather than political,
this depends on how political (or
scientific) one views the process
of public education.
In any case, the fact remains
that the four Stanford professors
are in substantial agreement on
this controversial issue, while I
disagree with all of them. I further
believe that this issue of Divine
Creation is critical, for unless this
is understood, it is difficult to
understand the role of science in
issues concerning the quality and
quantity problems of human
populations.
Divine Creation
My position is that if a scientist
does not accept the theory of
Divine Creation, then that
scientist can not help but reflect
this in the conduct of his research.
This is particularly true for those
scientists working in the area of
human behavior.
If a scientist does not believe
that man has the spark of Divinity
within him, it is quite easy for
him to entertain the notion that a
small group of men have the right
to determine which of the other
groups should be encouraged to
reproduce. In effect, this disbelief
allows some scientists to act as
though they were God.
My position is that man is
something more than that which
is indicated by his genetic
make-up; and since we do not yet
fully understand what this
"something more" is, it is
arrogant and presumptuous of us
to feel that the present state of
scientific knowledge is sufficient
for us to decide which people
have "diseases" or "genetic
weaknesses" and should,
therefore, be discouraged from
further reproduction.
Identity Problems
When you say to a group of
people (e.g., those carrying the
sickle-cell trait) that no more of
their kind is desired, you are in
fact telling that person that he is

not desired. Since, psychologically
speaking, a man identifies himself
by the recognition of his kind,
scientists are largely responsible
for the various "identity
problems" suffered by members
of the general population. Telling
a person that no more of his kind
is desired is not a sign of moral
concern, nor benign neglect; it is,
simply, the most academically
respected sign of racial hatred.
If those scientists who presume
to possess enough knowledge to
tell others who they should and
should not marry were truly
motivated by concern and love for
people, they would pay as much
attention towards solving the
problem of sterility among black
geniuses as they would towards
the problem of over-population
among the black non-geniuses. If
"improvement" of the black race
were truly the source of scientific
motivation, then our newspapers

that man has the spark of Divinity
within him, it is quite easy for
him to entertain the notion that a
small group of men have the right
to determine which of the other
groups should be encouraged to
reproduce. In effect, this disbelief
allows some scientists to act as
though they were God.
My position is that man is
something more than that which
is indicated by his genetic
make-up; and since we do not yet
fully understand what this
"something more" is, it is
arrogant and presumptuous of us
to feel that the present state of
scientific knowledge is sufficient
for us to decide which people
have "diseases" or "genetic
weaknesses" and should,
therefore, be discouraged from
further reproduction.
Identity Problems
When you say to a group of
people (e.g., those carrying the
sickle-cell trait) that no more of
their kind is desired, you are in
fact telling that person that he is

not desired. Since, psychologically
speaking, a man identifies himself
by the recognition of his kind,
scientists are largely responsible
for the various "identity
problems" suffered by members
of the general population. Telling
a person that no more of his kind
is desired is not a sign of moral
concern, nor benign neglect; it is,
simply, the most academically
respected sign of racial hatred.
If those scientists who presume
to possess enough knowledge to
tell others who they should and
should not marry were truly
motivated by concern and love for
people, they would pay as much
attention towards solving the
problem of sterility among black
geniuses as they would towards
the problem of over-population
among the black non-geniuses. If
"improvement" of the black race
were truly the source of scientific
motivation, then our newspapers
would carry as many stories
encouraging birth among some
blacks (as opposed to only
discouraging it among others).
Human Nature
But what we find is a one-sided
orientation: elimination of the
least-fit. No mention is ever made
about Government support for

the development of the best of a
particular race; this is probably
because very few whites can
conceive of the possibility that
the best of another race may in
fact be better than the best of
their own race. Some call this
white "racism;" I think that it is
better described as "human
nature" though, admittedly, it is
perhaps the worst aspect of it.
An important issue here
involves how the "best" of any
race is defined. The four scientists
with whom I disagree all subscribe
to some genetic indicator of one
kind or another. My own view is
that it is the divinity of man, as
reflected by his state of spiritual
consciousness, which is the only
yardstick by which some men
should presume to judge the
essential worth of other men. But
science has not yet progressed to
the stage where it can adequately
measure the spiritual
consciousness of man. Unless and
until this stage is reached, any
proposals which put forth genetic
solutions to the human problems
of quality and quantity represent
not the best of science, but the
worst of racial politics.
