Leaflet Aids Communists
Editor:
Many of us with mailboxes on
campus have received leaflets
entitled "Rebuild Bach Mai
Hospital." I would like to
comment on the contents of the
leaflets.
First the name of the
organization to which we are
requested to send the completed
form and contributions:
Committee for Supplies to
Indochina. Though the
organization seems to be aiding
only North Vietnam, it is
probably appropriately named in
that (a) North Vietnam fully
intends to gain control over all of
Indochina, and (b) many of
Hanoi's sympathizers believe that
a communist government would
"help" the average Indochinese.
Funds are solicited in order to
"promote good will between
ourselves and the people of North
Vietnam." I am unaware that any
foreign organizations are allowed
any dealings with private citizens
of North Vietnam. One can deal
only with their repressive,

totalitarian, Communist
government. While the North
Vietnamese people are as
deserving of good will as anyone, I
find it hard to imagine that
goodwill is promoted by aiding
the government which drafts their
men and sends them off to die in
South Vietnam. How anyone with
an understanding of and respect
for human civil rights could
knowingly give aid to such a
regime, I do not know.
Another sentence in the leaflet
calls for an end to military
funding of the war, without the
merest mention of 145,000 North
Vietnamese troops presently
engaged in killing South
Vietnamese. We're supposed to cut
off military aid so that the South
Vietnamese, troops run out of
supplies and can then be
slaughtered more readily. That
would be humane? Would it be
moral to knowingly set up such a
situation? Will you pray for the
dead and build hospitals for the
displaced?
