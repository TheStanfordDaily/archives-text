# Shockley Seeks Study Of Racial Ancestry, IQ
## 
### JOANNE JACOBS 
Electrical Engineering Prof. William
Shockley last night suggested spending
$40,000 to study the correlation
between the amount of Caucasian
ancestry of black students here and
their scholastic performance and IQ.
Shockley, Genetics Prof. L.L.
Cavalli-Sforza and Asst. Psychology
Profs. D. Phillip McGee and Cedric X
(Clark) debated "The Heritability of
IQ and Its Social, Economic and
Political Implications" before a
Memorial Auditorium audience of
1800 people.
McGee was added to the panel at
the last minute, after X complained
that its composition was biased.
Psychology , Prof. Philip Zimbardo,
who organized the debate and acted as
timekeeper, called the last minute
request a "ploy," complaining that X
waited to present his objections until a
few minutes before the program was
scheduled to begin.
But Charles Ogletree, Chairman of
the Black Student Union, said, "If the
debate can't be run evenly, both the
FSU and the F of I (Fruit of Islam)
won't allow it to go on." Members of
the Fruit of Islam, a Black Muslim
group, and the BSU were on hand to
maintain order.
The participants and moderator
Herman Chernoff, statistics
department chairman, decided to
allow McGee to share X's speaking
time. The participants were allotted 45
minutes for initial presentations and
ten minutes for rebuttal. Then
questions and comments were
accepted from the floor.
Supports Theory
Shockley, who won the Nobel Prize
in physics in 1956, supported his
theory that "genes account for 80
percent of whatever pushes IQ up or
down" with slides of graphs describing
studies on white identical twins raised
apart. In a written statement
distributed before the discussion,

Shockley said that this assertion "leads
inescapably to the opinion that
American Negro IQ and social deficits
are primarily hereditary and racially
genetic in origin."
Shockley hypothesizes that the IQ
of the average American black goes up
one percent for every one percent of
Caucasian ancestry.
Ogletree called Shockley's proposal
"ridiculous" and added, "Even if he
found people to participate, he would
be surprised to discover that the
results would be the opposite of what
he thought they would be."
Detestable Subject
Shockley said that Nazi
experiments with eugenics are
"something that we can learn from,
not something we should turn our
backs on." He noted, "This subject is
so detestable to scientists that they are
unwilling to do anything about it."
Shockley called welfare programs,
which he feels encourage large
families, "humanism gone berserk."
Shockley's competence in genetics
was challenged by Cavalli-Sforza, who
said, "I am very embarrassed to note
that some of the main concepts of
genetics have escaped Professor
Shockley." He implied that Shockley
might not be able to pass a genetics
test if he relied on his theories.

Cavalli-Sforza stated that genetics
finds that differences between races
are small when compared to
differences between individuals of the
same race. "The things we can see
seem very different," the geneticist
said, describing skin color, hair texture
and facial features.
X and McGee challenged the
validity of the IQ test for blacks.
Shockley stated that the IQ test is a
fair prediction of the quality of life,
citing educational achievement,
intellectual achievement, divorce,
intelligence of children, and income.
X pointed out that "Shockley's
conception of quality of life is heavily
weighted to aspects of his own life —
academia." He added that "Love,
humility, courage, honesty represent
spiritual values of man — qualities that
Shockley is ignorant of or not
interested in."
The professors waded into
discussions of data, statistical analysis,
"poor genes," and adoption, but
avoided sharp exchanges.
The audience thinned as the
program, which started a half hour
late, went into its fourth hour. When
the questions period began about 11
p.m., the auditorium was only one
third full.

the last minute, after X complained
that its composition was biased.
Psychology , Prof. Philip Zimbardo,
who organized the debate and acted as
timekeeper, called the last minute
request a "ploy," complaining that X
waited to present his objections until a
few minutes before the program was
scheduled to begin.
But Charles Ogletree, Chairman of
the Black Student Union, said, "If the
debate can't be run evenly, both the
FSU and the F of I (Fruit of Islam)
won't allow it to go on." Members of
the Fruit of Islam, a Black Muslim
group, and the BSU were on hand to
maintain order.
The participants and moderator
Herman Chernoff, statistics
department chairman, decided to
allow McGee to share X's speaking
time. The participants were allotted 45
minutes for initial presentations and
ten minutes for rebuttal. Then
questions and comments were
accepted from the floor.
Supports Theory
Shockley, who won the Nobel Prize
in physics in 1956, supported his
theory that "genes account for 80
percent of whatever pushes IQ up or
down" with slides of graphs describing
studies on white identical twins raised
apart. In a written statement
distributed before the discussion,

Shockley said that this assertion "leads
inescapably to the opinion that
American Negro IQ and social deficits
are primarily hereditary and racially
genetic in origin."
Shockley hypothesizes that the IQ
of the average American black goes up
one percent for every one percent of
Caucasian ancestry.
Ogletree called Shockley's proposal
"ridiculous" and added, "Even if he
found people to participate, he would
be surprised to discover that the
results would be the opposite of what
he thought they would be."
Detestable Subject
Shockley said that Nazi
experiments with eugenics are
"something that we can learn from,
not something we should turn our
backs on." He noted, "This subject is
so detestable to scientists that they are
unwilling to do anything about it."
Shockley called welfare programs,
which he feels encourage large
families, "humanism gone berserk."
Shockley's competence in genetics
was challenged by Cavalli-Sforza, who
said, "I am very embarrassed to note
that some of the main concepts of
genetics have escaped Professor
Shockley." He implied that Shockley
might not be able to pass a genetics
test if he relied on his theories.

Cavalli-Sforza stated that genetics
finds that differences between races
are small when compared to
differences between individuals of the
same race. "The things we can see
seem very different," the geneticist
said, describing skin color, hair texture
and facial features.
X and McGee challenged the
validity of the IQ test for blacks.
Shockley stated that the IQ test is a
fair prediction of the quality of life,
citing educational achievement,
intellectual achievement, divorce,
intelligence of children, and income.
X pointed out that "Shockley's
conception of quality of life is heavily
weighted to aspects of his own life —
academia." He added that "Love,
humility, courage, honesty represent
spiritual values of man — qualities that
Shockley is ignorant of or not
interested in."
The professors waded into
discussions of data, statistical analysis,
"poor genes," and adoption, but
avoided sharp exchanges.
The audience thinned as the
program, which started a half hour
late, went into its fourth hour. When
the questions period began about 11
p.m., the auditorium was only one
third full.
