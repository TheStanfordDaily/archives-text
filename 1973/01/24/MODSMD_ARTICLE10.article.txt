# many things neglected
## 'My Time Is Limited' 
### 
Fred a. hargadon

I have a feeling this is not going
to be one of my vintage years. I
am equally convinced that my
future lies in providing case
material for the study of
pathology in college
administration. I had hoped that
by this time in my career, my
secretary might answer the phone
by saying "I'm sorry, but he's
busy thinking," rather than "he's
in a meeting," but even that

prospect now seems dimmer.
(Among my other fantasies, the
prospect of finding some morning,
in place of the newspaper, a
simple note to the effect that
there was no news worth
reporting that day.)
Your expressed concern
(editorial, 19 Jan. 73) that
administrators be accessible and
that, in this particular instance,
the Dean of Admissions be more
accessible than he has been to The
Daily, is a valid one. On the other
hand, it is one thing to argue that
among all those to whom the
Dean of Admissions ought to be
accessible, The Daijy has been
undeservedly neglected (a point
with which I agree) and quite
another thing to (a) attribute that
negligence to the kinds of motives
you have rather ungenerously
implied and (b) to so narrowly
construe the measures of
accessibility as they apply to this
particular administrator.
Motives
Since almost none of the
questions I am supposedly trying
to duck are ones to which I have
not responded repeatedly, directly
(even bluntly) and publicly over
the past couple of years, you can
be assured you will hear from me
on them shortly. If I had to
reconstruct my motives for not
responding to The Daily earlier on
such matters, nothing more
conspiratorial was involved than
my (a) being tired of responding
to such questions and (b)
thinking, at the time, that the
request had lower priority than a
lot of other things on my desk.
From where I sit I am, for
instance, convinced that the
number of people submitting
questionnaires about admissions
long ago surpassed the number
who have to fill them out and I
am increasingly concerned that it

will become impossible both to
effectively perform one's job and
at the same time to talk and write
about how one performs that job
as frequently as others would like.
I regret even more than you do
my not being able to spend more
time being a "hail fellow well ( or
even poorly) met" on campus.
But, for better or for worse, I
strongly believe that the group of
students who have the highest
priority in terms of my
accessibility are those outside the
University, the large majority of
whom I will never actually meet
in person: some 25,000 who
inquire about admission each
year, and 13,000 or so who will
then apply for either freshman or
transfer admission.
Rejects Spared
I spend an awful lot of
mealtimes, evenings and weekends
with them. (It only now occurs to
me to tell those we must
disappoint each year that they are
at least spared the inaccessibility
of the Dean of Admissions during
their undergraduate years).
Attempting to maintain a personal
and individualized admissions
process of this scope is no easy
task, even given the very able,
dedicated and hard-working staff
we have. We are all reminded of
the things we could be doing
better if only we had more time.
At any rate, you will be
pleased to know that in expressing
your concern about my
accessibility you have spoken on
behalf of my family, my
secretary, my staff, my advisees,
the alumni, nearly 10,000
secondary school counselors, and
many others. And, like them, you
have extracted a promise on my
part definitely to be more
accessible. Pardon me, I think I
hear the phone.
(Fred A. Hargadon is Dean of
Admissions.)
