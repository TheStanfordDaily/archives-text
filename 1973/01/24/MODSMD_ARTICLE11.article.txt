# 'firm commitment needed'
## 'Women And Minorities Snubbed' 
### 
davidson, reaven, rosenberg and snow

There is currently before the Senate of the
Academic Council a proposal concerning
opportunities for women and minority groups
in Graduate Education. The proposal
commends the past record of Stanford and
suggests that some continuing recruiting
efforts would be desirable.
Not surprisingly this proposal has been
described as bland, self-serving and falling
mid-way between lip-service and tokenism.
Obviously what is needed is a program of
action on behalf of minorities and women
based on criteria which reflect a real
commitment on the part of the University to
increase representation of these groups.
There are three general issues (suggested by
the code words listed below) which come up
in the discussion and upon which there seems
to be differences of opinion. These concern:
1. Quality, qualifications and criteria: 2.
Quotas and goals; 3. Priorities and resources.
Qualifications
1. The issue is not quality, about which
there is indeed unanimity. There is
disagreement about the qualifications required
for admission as well as the criteria used to
judge the degree to which the qualifications
are met. An effective program to increase the
numbers of under-represented groups
demands a serious re-examination of the
admissions criteria. The participation of
blacks, Chicanos, Native Americans and
women in the establishment of appropriate
criteria is essential

Such efforts are not novel. But they are
resisted by a variety of sophistries which do
not address the question of excellence but are
aimed only at preserving the status quo.
Schools which fail for decades to include
significant numbers of blacks, Chicanos,
Native Americans and women (and there is a
striking congruity in the performance of
different schools with respect to the different
under-represented groups) have deplorably
low standards with respect to fulfilling social
obligations. For such schools a re-evaluation
of admissions criteria is essential.
2. On quotas. This word is introduced as a
scare word since, in the minds of many, it
recalls the elitist past when few spaces—far
fewer than the numbers of qualified-would
be admitted from, for example, the Jewish
applicant pool.
But a quota to exclude on the basis of
religious prejudice is different from a quota
designed to include those deprived of
admission because of institutional, individual
and cultural racism and sexism.
Highest Priority
3. Priorities and resources. The argument is
made that the principle determinant of the
institutional effort is the limit imposed by the
resources available. Doubtless, in an abstract
or absolute sense, that is true. Equally true is
the' argument that the priority assigned the
matter determines the call upon resources.
Improvement of our effort in the area of
minoritv affairs or recruitment of women

demands in the first instance that this be given
a higher priority at all levels of decision
making. The Senate has not by its actions to
date indicated that it considers this matter of
the highest priority.
It is hoped that out of any future
discussions of these issues will emerge a
program aimed at achieving substantial
increases in the numbers of blacks, Chicanos,
Native Americans and women in all schools
with especial emphasis on those schools
showing less than 10 percent minority or 40
percent women enrolled.
As a minimal procedure, committees
should be set up, with representatives of the
faculty of each school, and of the various
groups under-represented, as well as of the
administration. Each committee can be
charged with communicating to all minority
students and women in the freshman class at
Stanford the opportunities open to them in
the school it represents. Such committees, in
co-operation with the schools and
departments should seek to admit to graduate
school an appropriate number of
undergraduates who meet the qualifications.
The President or his designate should
report annually to the Senate on the status of
programs for women and minorities.

in the discussion and upon which there seems
to be differences of opinion. These concern:
1. Quality, qualifications and criteria: 2.
Quotas and goals; 3. Priorities and resources.
Qualifications
1. The issue is not quality, about which
there is indeed unanimity. There is
disagreement about the qualifications required
for admission as well as the criteria used to
judge the degree to which the qualifications
are met. An effective program to increase the
numbers of under-represented groups
demands a serious re-examination of the
admissions criteria. The participation of
blacks, Chicanos, Native Americans and
women in the establishment of appropriate
criteria is essential

Such efforts are not novel. But they are
resisted by a variety of sophistries which do
not address the question of excellence but are
aimed only at preserving the status quo.
Schools which fail for decades to include
significant numbers of blacks, Chicanos,
Native Americans and women (and there is a
striking congruity in the performance of
different schools with respect to the different
under-represented groups) have deplorably
low standards with respect to fulfilling social
obligations. For such schools a re-evaluation
of admissions criteria is essential.
2. On quotas. This word is introduced as a
scare word since, in the minds of many, it
recalls the elitist past when few spaces—far
fewer than the numbers of qualified-would
be admitted from, for example, the Jewish
applicant pool.
But a quota to exclude on the basis of
religious prejudice is different from a quota
designed to include those deprived of
admission because of institutional, individual
and cultural racism and sexism.
Highest Priority
3. Priorities and resources. The argument is
made that the principle determinant of the
institutional effort is the limit imposed by the
resources available. Doubtless, in an abstract
or absolute sense, that is true. Equally true is
the' argument that the priority assigned the
matter determines the call upon resources.
Improvement of our effort in the area of
minoritv affairs or recruitment of women

demands in the first instance that this be given
a higher priority at all levels of decision
making. The Senate has not by its actions to
date indicated that it considers this matter of
the highest priority.
It is hoped that out of any future
discussions of these issues will emerge a
program aimed at achieving substantial
increases in the numbers of blacks, Chicanos,
Native Americans and women in all schools
with especial emphasis on those schools
showing less than 10 percent minority or 40
percent women enrolled.
As a minimal procedure, committees
should be set up, with representatives of the
faculty of each school, and of the various
groups under-represented, as well as of the
administration. Each committee can be
charged with communicating to all minority
students and women in the freshman class at
Stanford the opportunities open to them in
the school it represents. Such committees, in
co-operation with the schools and
departments should seek to admit to graduate
school an appropriate number of
undergraduates who meet the qualifications.
The President or his designate should
report annually to the Senate on the status of
programs for women and minorities.

There is currently before the Senate of the
Academic Council a proposal concerning
opportunities for women and minority groups
in Graduate Education. The proposal
commends the past record of Stanford and
suggests that some continuing recruiting
efforts would be desirable.
Not surprisingly this proposal has been
described as bland, self-serving and falling
mid-way between lip-service and tokenism.
Obviously what is needed is a program of
action on behalf of minorities and women
based on criteria which reflect a real
commitment on the part of the University to
increase representation of these groups.
