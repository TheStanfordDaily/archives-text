False Charge
Editor:
I want to thank your reporter
for calling me in New York City
last Wednesday to inTorm me
about the price-fixing charge
leveled against General Motors
and Ford, and giving me an
opportunity to comment. Since
returning to carnpus, I have
learned through your article that I
am apparently charged with
participating in meetings with
chairman James Roche of General
Motors and chairman Lynn
Townsend of Chryslerâ€”meetings
that took place after I joined
Stanford.
This charge is false. I never saw
Mr. Townsend during the period
in question, and the only times I
saw Mr. Roche were in
Washington while we were both
attending meetings of the
National Commission on
Productivity. Furthermore, my
telephone, if bugged, would reveal
I had no conversations with either
of these men.
It should be emphasized that I
am not a defendant in the case. As
I understand it, my being named,
along with more than one
hundred others, is a legal device to
permit the admission as evidence
of some documents that otherwise
would be excluded.

Tresidder Should Expand
Editor:
I read with great dismay the
conclusion of your editorial on
Tresidder (Daily, Jan. 18) stating
that expansion of services should
wait until tfiose offered presently
are "dramatically" improved. This
shows a great lack of insight into
the problems facing Tresidder
which are essentially the same as
those encountered by unions all
across the country.
In particular, the largest
problem is rising food costs and
decreasing sales in union cafeterias
caused by students' increasing
inability to pay someone to
prepare their food for them. The
"solution" most unions try is to
decrease the level of their services
until they are better and more
"manageable." All this means is
that the new system is relatively
more costly because of its smaller
scale, and students go without
services.
The real answer is to get more
students into the union by being
progressive, creative, and, most of
all, being sensitive to student
needs and wishes. The student
union should be the focal point of
student activity on campus, not
just a bank or a travel agency or a
cafeteria. In light of this, the
coffee house is definitely a step in
the right direction for Tresidder,
but what about offering pizza at
night or starting a small grocery
store or free flicks (old John
Wayne movies are surprisingly
cheap) on off-nights to get
students into the union and keep
them from being ripped-off for
the same thing at more expensive
places? It is surprising what can be
done for students at their union.

Medical Ethics
Editor:
As a pre-medical student I
cannot minimize nor refute the
existance of several forms of
unethical competition in pre-med
courses as was outlined in your
article of Jan. 22 entitled,
"Competitive Atmosphere
Encourages 'Psychological War'
Among Premeds." 1 would like to
stress, however, that such actions
as sabotage of notes and labs,
bomb threats on classes, and
cheating on examinations, etc., do
not imply that all pre-meds, or
even those who cheat, are of a
lower basic character than
students in general.
Most pre-medical students
possess respect for the ethics and

humanity that medicine ideally
demands, and some, as such, carry
that on to imply that
qualifications for a medical career
transcend the normal criteria of
grade point averages and
standardized testing. The lack of
medical education facilities at
both the undergraduate and
graduate level induces strong
competition among students, and
the im personalized nature of
educational institutions and their
mode of evaluation, compels
many to unethical action.
It is a sad paradox that an
appreciation for the ethics of
medicine induces in some a lack
of respect for the ethics of
education. The above may, of
course, be a rationalization for
actions viewed by one too closely
interested to present an unbiased
opinion. It cannot be proven as
such, however, until medical
facilities can be upgraded and
expanded so as to produce the
number and quality of doctors
this nation deserves and until the
manner of . evaluation of
prospective doctors parallels the
humaneness the medical
profession should ideally demand.

'Great Innovation'
Editor:
I write to observe that I think
the "Bug Me" column which has
been added to the Daily this year
is the best innovation the Daily
has had in a long time. For the
University community to have its
own "Action Line" is useful
indeed.
Parenthetically, I think, too,
that Mr. Litterman who conducts
this column is doing an excellent
job of going to the proper sources
and getting helpful responses.

Servile Class
Editor:
We staff members at the
Hansen Labs wish to protest the
University administration's policy
of permitting discriminatory
layoffs of older employees before
retirement. The case of Julia
Harvey is particularly blatant and
the administration has yet to be
heard from.
When faculty members are
entitled to tenure while staff
members are not even permitted
simple seniority rights, it becomes
clear that members of the
Stanford community are not
created equal. At one time
graduate students were referred to
as slave labor, and it seems that
the servile class is growing.

Arroyo Collection
Editor:
The recent bombing attacks
unleashed by Nixon over North
Vietnam during Christmas
brought expressions of outrage
and sorrow from governments and
citizens all over the world. We at
Arroyo House in Wilbur felt not
only sorrow for the victims of
Nixon's rage but shame that our
Government should so callously
undertake the systematic
destruction of another civilization
and people.
In order to express our
feelings, and begin to undo some
of the damage, we have
undertaken a collection in our
dorm to help rebuild the Bach Mai
hospital in Hanoi. To date we
have raised $60 dollars. We
strongly encourage other members
of the Stanford community who
have not already contributed to
the fund to rebuild this hospital
to send their money to, Medical
Aid For Indochina, 1233 Mills St.,
Menlo Park 94025.
