## Entertainment Renowned Chorus Sings In Concert At Mem Chu 
### 
Two of the outstanding college vocal ensembles
in the United States are scheduled to appear under
the direction of Dr. William Hall Thursday at noon
in front of Memorial Church.
The Concert Choir of Chapman College is a select
group of seventy-five singers chosen from all
departments of the college. They have recently
returned from a tour of Europe, including
engagements at St. Stephen's Cathedral in Vienna,
Kaiser-Wilhelm Kirche in Berlin, and the Bella
Bartok School in Budapest.
The Chapman College Singers have performed
throughout the United States and Europe. They
have worked under Henri Temianka, renowned
violinist and conductor, and with the famed
Baroque Viennese Ensemble, The Musica Da
Camera.
They have also recorded at the three major
studios in Europe, the Bayerischer Rundfunk, in
Munich, the Hessicher Rundfunk in Frankfurt, and
the 8.8.C. in London.
Dr. Hall, associate professor of music at
Chapman College since 1963, teaches courses in
choral literature and church music. He is

founder-conductor of the William Hall Chorale,
which has enjoyed successful concert tours through
Europe. He will be returning this summer to record
Benjamin Britten's 'War Requiem' with the
Bratislava Symphony in Czechoslovakia.
Dr. Hall is well known as a clinician-conductor
throughout the United States and Europe, where he
conducts twenty honor choirs and orchestra
festivals annually. He has lectured at the famed
Academy of Music in Vienna.
He has delivered papers at various conventions
and has acted as Dean of the Festival Choirs at the
Summer Music Camp, Northern Arizona University.
Dr. Hall is the Minister of Music at the First
United Methodist Church of Glendale (The
Cathedral of the West). His seventy-five voice choir
is heard every Sunday on radio KIEV.
Along with his duties at the college, he composes
and edits choral music under his own series entitled
"The William Hall Chorale" with National Music
Publishers. A graduate of Whittier College, he
received his M.A. and D.M.A. degrees from the
University of Southern California.
Admission to the concert is free.
