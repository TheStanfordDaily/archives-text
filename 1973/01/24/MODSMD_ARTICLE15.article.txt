# Lotte Goslar Rescues Lackluster Circus
## 
### CHRISTINE DOUGLAS 
In her performance Friday
night in Memorial Auditorium
with her Pantomime Circus, Lotte
Goslar showed herself to be
beyond doubt one of the more
talented clowns around. She has
grace and persuasive charm,
convincing the audience always
with her full involvement in
whatever piece of acting she does.
Because her face, a natural for the
expressiveness of mime, covers the
gamut of human feeling, by the
end of the show she had without
question won over the affection
of the audience.
I wonder, however, whether
the program should not have read
"Goslar and Her Pantomime
Circus" rather than "Goslar's
Pantomime Circus," for, although
her troupe consists of some
talented dancers (Lance
Westergard and Kathleen Cardin),
actors (particularly Bob Bowyer),
and one excellent mime (Ray
Collins), it lacked her own ability
to establish an immediate rapport
with the audience.
At times it seemed as if the
show could have been improved
had Goslar either done a

one-woman show or maintained a
more central position in each of
the individual skits.
Occasionally, Goslar wrongly
allowed the more flashy antics of
her company to overshadow her,
as in the skit "La Ch&sse," where
the actors and dancers ran and
stumbled around the stage while
Goslar stood sullen-faced in the
background. She gained the
audience's full attention only
when left alone onstage at the end
of the skit.
No Dragging
Most of the skits showed a
sensitivity to the chronological
limits of stage humor. Surprisingly
enough, none of the skits dragged
on too long, and some, such as a
ballet parody called "A Propos
Elves" and an anti-war piece
called "All's Well That Ends
cut the audience short effectively.
Although one skit, 'The Music
Box," in which Ray Collins and
Jerri Lines mimed machine-like
dolls, did hold its own without
Goslar's help, most of the skits in
which she did not appear were

comparatively weak and at times
downright amateur, such as the
skit "Poet and Muse," in which "
Byronic poet, played by Bob
Bowyer, desperately courts a
wandering Muse, played by Jerri
Lines.
In her unforgettable solo skits,
Goslar indisputably proved herself
to be the motivating force of her
own company. She performed in a
myriad of roles, at one time
playing a poor snowed-upon and
rained-upon flower and at another
time in a skit called "Grandma
Always Danced," she traced the
life of a woman from infancy to
death. The curtain closed with the
audience's imagination soaring up
to heaven with a winged Goslar.
It seemed an ironic ending, for
Goslar is far from dead. Her verve
and spirit are what saved an
otherwise flat show.
