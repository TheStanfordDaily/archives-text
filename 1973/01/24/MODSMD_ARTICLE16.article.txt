# Taj Mahal Brings Audience Participation To Mem Aud
## 
### JAY HARLOW 
Six o'clock on a Monday evening is no time
to start a rock concert. Joy of Cooking and
Tfej Mahal did the best they could with half a
house in Mem Aud Monday night. The results
were, under the circumstances, surprisingly
good.
Joy of Cooking, a Berkeley-based band,
came on first. Three of the five members
remained from the original band—Terry
Garthwaite on guitar, Fritz Karsten on drums
and occasionally harmonica, and Ron Wilson
on congas. A new piano player, Stephen
Roseman, replaced Toni Brown; Happy Smith
was the new bass player, whose axe appeared
to be a violin body with an electric bass neck,
bridge, and pickup.
The audience required its customary first
few numbers to warm up; it then began to get
into the appropriate spirit. Not until the band
played "Brownsville/Mockingbird" did the
audience finish digesting its early dinner and
settle down for some good, solid music.
Although they played some mellower
songs, the group were at their best doing
hard-driving rock, highlighting the solo
instruments (in this case, the piano, drums,
and congas). Both percussionists were
exceptionally good at maintaining the rhythm

while doing elaborate solos, seemingly a rare
talent among drummers.
Skillful Lead Work
Roseman did most of the instrumental lead
work on piano very skillfully. But the most
remarkable thing was Terry Garth waite's vocal
style, packing an incredible number of
syllables into a single beat, and doing "scat"
vocal duets with the other singers, piano,
drums, and congas. The crowd dug it enough
to call for an encore.
After the break, Taj Mahal came onstage.
He spent the next hour or so giving a great
show. He simultaneously led the audience in
entertaining itself, while apparently having a
good time himself.
He began in his usual manner on a kalimba,
a sort of African thumb harp which one often
hears in the soundtrack of African wildlife
documentaries. Half of the effect of the piece
came from Taj's facial expressions, which
almost acted like another instrument to
complement the music. The rest of the set
included banjo and slide guitar, as well as his
Mississippi National steel-bodied guitar.
Audience Involvement
Taj announced very early his intention to
involve the audience in the music: "Gonna
put some shake in your shaker, a little quake

in your quaker, and a little rock in your
sock."
Throughout the set he had the audience
clapping and singing along from time to time,
sometimes giving the women one part and the
men another. In between the audience
participation parts, Taj did some great vocals
and instrumental licks; he obviously enjoyed
himself.
Finally, he went to the piano, proceeded to
pound random chords and discords and make
diabolical faces, then landed suddenly in a
blues progression leading into a song about
"churning butter." As an encore, he led the
crowd in still another round of clapping,
stomping, and shouting.
Release Energy
Anyone who went to the concert expecting
Taj Mahal to play at him was probably
disappointed. Taj's purpose was not to
provide energy for his listeners but rather to
release energy from them. At one point he
revealed that he was a messenger from another
planet sent to explain the blues. The message
he seemed to carry was that blues exists not
for the glory of the performer but for the
enjoyment of performer and audience alike.

drums, and congas. The crowd dug it enough
to call for an encore.
After the break, Taj Mahal came onstage.
He spent the next hour or so giving a great
show. He simultaneously led the audience in
entertaining itself, while apparently having a
good time himself.
He began in his usual manner on a kalimba,
a sort of African thumb harp which one often
hears in the soundtrack of African wildlife
documentaries. Half of the effect of the piece
came from Taj's facial expressions, which
almost acted like another instrument to
complement the music. The rest of the set
included banjo and slide guitar, as well as his
Mississippi National steel-bodied guitar.
Audience Involvement
Taj announced very early his intention to
involve the audience in the music: "Gonna
put some shake in your shaker, a little quake

in your quaker, and a little rock in your
sock."
Throughout the set he had the audience
clapping and singing along from time to time,
sometimes giving the women one part and the
men another. In between the audience
participation parts, Taj did some great vocals
and instrumental licks; he obviously enjoyed
himself.
Finally, he went to the piano, proceeded to
pound random chords and discords and make
diabolical faces, then landed suddenly in a
blues progression leading into a song about
"churning butter." As an encore, he led the
crowd in still another round of clapping,
stomping, and shouting.
Release Energy
Anyone who went to the concert expecting
Taj Mahal to play at him was probably
disappointed. Taj's purpose was not to
provide energy for his listeners but rather to
release energy from them. At one point he
revealed that he was a messenger from another
planet sent to explain the blues. The message
he seemed to carry was that blues exists not
for the glory of the performer but for the
enjoyment of performer and audience alike.

TAJ MAHAL — The great blues performer entertained with Joy of
Cooking in two shows at Memorial Auditorium. Finding his special
place within the blues and gifted with a natural musical artistry, Taj
Mahal drew immediate enthusiasm from the Stanford audience.
Six o'clock on a Monday evening is no time
to start a rock concert. Joy of Cooking and
Tfej Mahal did the best they could with half a
house in Mem Aud Monday night. The results
were, under the circumstances, surprisingly
good.
Joy of Cooking, a Berkeley-based band,
came on first. Three of the five members
remained from the original band—Terry
Garthwaite on guitar, Fritz Karsten on drums
and occasionally harmonica, and Ron Wilson
on congas. A new piano player, Stephen
Roseman, replaced Toni Brown; Happy Smith
was the new bass player, whose axe appeared
to be a violin body with an electric bass neck,
bridge, and pickup.
The audience required its customary first
few numbers to warm up; it then began to get
into the appropriate spirit. Not until the band
played "Brownsville/Mockingbird" did the
audience finish digesting its early dinner and
settle down for some good, solid music.
Although they played some mellower
songs, the group were at their best doing
hard-driving rock, highlighting the solo
instruments (in this case, the piano, drums,
and congas). Both percussionists were
exceptionally good at maintaining the rhythm

while doing elaborate solos, seemingly a rare
talent among drummers.
Skillful Lead Work
Roseman did most of the instrumental lead
work on piano very skillfully. But the most
remarkable thing was Terry Garth waite's vocal
style, packing an incredible number of
syllables into a single beat, and doing "scat"
vocal duets with the other singers, piano,
drums, and congas. The crowd dug it enough
to call for an encore.
After the break, Taj Mahal came onstage.
He spent the next hour or so giving a great
show. He simultaneously led the audience in
