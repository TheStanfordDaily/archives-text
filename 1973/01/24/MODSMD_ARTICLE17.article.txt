# Renegade Organist
## 
### 
Anthony Newman, brilliant and controversial
harpsichordist-organist, will present a recital at 8 on Friday in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium. He plans to play two harpsichord
compositions, "Quadran Pavan with a Variation and Gailard," dance
music by the Elizabethan composer John Bull, and "Partita in B
Minor" by J.S. Bach.
The second half of the program features Bach's earliest organ work
to appear in print in the "Klavierubung." The composition has
twenty-three sections, the first and last interrelated and based on the
well known hymn tune, "St. Anne."
In the performance of the "Klavierubung," Dorothy Barnhouse
will sing a hymn.
Judging from reviewers' comments, Newman has caused a bigger
upheaval in the rather sleepy world of harpsichord and organ than
anyone since Landowska and Schweitzer.
When he plays Bach, he has no inhibitions about using his
imagination or his senses. He rethinks each piece with innovative
Baroque ornamentation and dynamics. His radical departures from
normal procedures on the instruments has evoked substantial response
from students.
The Newman concert is the third in the Stanford Public Events
Keyboard Series. Future performers scheduled include Jacob Lateiner,
pianist on February 9 and Murray Perahia, pianist, on April 6. Tickets
are $4.50, $3.75 for students, and are now available at Tresidder
Ticket Office and Ticketron.
