BALLOTS by David C. Weber and Allen B. Veaner of
the University Libraries staff.
Why libraries need computers
The "information explosion" which universities have
helped create in recent decades has inundated libraries
and research centers with so many new publications that
traditional manual systems are becoming increasingly
unable to handle the load.
Libraries are in large measure still using many of the
basic techniques devised over the last 2,600 years. These
techniques were considered moderately adequate until
the Second World War. But library systems now are
inconvenient of access, slow in response, difficult to use,
frustrating in complexity, and unresponsive to changing
needs.
Problem of huge files
Files have grown so large that they are virtually
becoming unmanageable and many libraries have
seriously considered ceasing to add to their card catalogs
and starting afresh for new acquisitions with some
degree of automation.
* Ohio State University has announced that its card
catalog will be closed and replaced by computer-oriented
bibliographic services in 1976.
* The Library of Congress has predicted that, at the
present rate of growth, by 1980 its own public catalog
will contain some 32,000,000 cards—a tile so vast that
its manageability is questionable.
* Even at Stanford, which is the nation's eighth
largest research library, the various catalogs available to
the public are estimated to contain some ten million
cards.
To create this major bibliographic tool-key to the
millions of bibliographic units at Stanford—requires
many formalized activities and functions which are
routine and which do not require interpretive, scholarly,
or qualitative judgments. Many of these lunctions are
almost ideally suited to machine processing.
More cost, less service
Constantly rising costs are another factor in the
libraries' desire to turn to computers. Labor costs go up
5 to 6 percent each year, whereas the cost of computer
transactions goes up at only half that rate.
It is thus clear that at some point in the future the
University should be paying increasingly less for library
services under a machine system than if it stuck with thu
tried and tested manual process with its ever increasing
complexities and frustrations.
And at the same time a machine system is a more
powerful instrument for giving full, very precise, and
more rapid access to local and national library resources.
Library collections double in size about every 16
years. Even in periods of social unrest or economic
dislocation, the spiral of publishing and communication
activity continues upwards.
Unfortunately, when a library doubles in size, the
effort required to maintain an equivalent level of service
more than doubles-and therein lies the rub.
The large research library at times seems to resemble
a dinosaur or a book museum. In the one instance, it is
slow and ponderous, not terribly adaptive or responsive
to changes in environment. In the other, it grows and
accumulates material relentlessly~yct the adequacy of
its services diminishes as it increases in size because it is
so difficult to access anything within a reasonable time.
Modernization and service improvement needed
The situation may be aggravated by the apparent
increase of interest in interdisciplinary or multidiscipli
nary studies which runs counter to pressures for physical
decentralization of libraries. The scholar in urban prob
lems has to shuttle between the Main Library, the Law
Library, the Jackson Library of Business, and perhaps
the Engineering and Art libraries.
If lie is unable to determine from some central place
(or better yet, from his own office, department, or
laboratory) whether one library or another possesses a
book and also whether that book is available for use, he
may give up in all but the most pressing searches.
In frustration, potential library users may turn to
other services or devices for their information needs—
perhaps building a personal library, long distance tele
phone conversations with colleagues, costly and time
consuming conferences, purchase of commercial inform
ation service, or the multiplication of branch libraries.
Students, and particularly graduate students, research
staff and faculty are now increasingly critical of the
ability of libraries to respond to current needs. Yet the
library is still a major and essential component in a huge
network of information processing; it too must be
brought into the 20th century.
Efforts to make this change at Stanford began more
than six years ago in the Stanford library automation
project. Involving 100 people and nearly $2 million to
date, it is called Project BALLOTS-for Bibliographic
Automation of Large Library Operations using a Time
sharing System. One ot the most advanced library
automation projects in the country, it still will require
several more years to complete. (See table.)
What BALLOTS can do for you
Computer terminals will aid you in 1973 and later
years to borrow books, search for publications you need,
determine what the library has on a subject for your
interest, and determine if a bibliographic citation that
interests you is now in the Stanford Library and if so,
where it is and whether it is in use.
This effort is the result of computer programs written
to operate television-like terminals that arc now in the
Main Library and will be added in Meyer and other
major library branches in the course of the next two to
four years. (Any typewriter terminal on campus can
already search the BALLOTS-MARC file, which consists
of current Library of Congress catalog data.)
The library staff will be able to help you with your
searches during 1973-4; it is expected that public use of
the TV-like terminals may start as early as 1974.

How BALLOTS works
Using terminals with cathode ray tubes, popularly
called "CRT's," library staff now conducts searches of
bibliographic files, enters commands and tells the com
puter to format data for purchase orders, sort the orders
alphabetically by vendor, and print them overnight.
The computer will also print messages notifying
faculty or student requesters that their materials have
arrived. Search commands will find Library of Congress
bibliographic data if available, and if not available, will
eventually enable the staff to create their own data on
the spot.
Similarly, commands entered at the terminal will
instruct the computer to properly format desired biblio
graphic data, sort it in batches for the main and
departmental libraries, and within each batch, print out
the complete set of library cards already sorted in
correct alphabetical filing sequence.
The magnitude of this operation is appreciated when
it is realized that the typical large research library
prepares between half a million and a million cards each
year—a job which in the manual system is not very
interesting and is susceptible to error.
In circulation, data collection devices and machine
readable identification cards will speed circulation tran
sactions and virtually eliminate the nuisance of filling
out charge cards by hand.
In summary the system will aid processing of roman
alphabet material acquired, and items the catalog listing
of which can be transliterated. There will be a consider
able time period before a sufficiently large fraction of
the library's holdings is contained in machine-readable
fdes to make automatic search rewarding to the general
user.
This time varies depending upon discipline. In the
sciences, it might be as short as two to five years. In the
humanities perhaps as much as 30 to 50 years, or until
such time as technological breakthroughs provide in
expensive, reliable conversion to machine-readable form
of massive bibliographic files-a prospect which docs not
seem imminent at this writing.
Unfortunately, a majority of the use of the library by
scientists involves the search for journal articles and
these will not be included in the initial implementation
of the system because of the expense of buying and
processing machine-readable data bases.
Typically, lists in machine-readable form for journal
citations covering a broad subject cost from
$10,000-25,000 each year, more than that to store
locally, and still more to convert them to internal

machine formats like SPIRES so that they can be run
against search programs. (SPIRES—the Stanford Public
Information REtrieval System-is a computer-based,
generalized information system. See Campus Report
Oct. 11, 1972 p. 1-2.)
Thus from the point of view of general patron search
of the library catalog, we must consider that BALLOTS
piovides a benefit of increasing utility over a period of
years.
The Meyer Library represents an exception in that all
its holdings (except journalarticles) will included in
the on-line catalog. The Meyer catalog is now printed,
bound, and distributed in book form to several locations
on campus.
Computer applications in bibliographic data
In 1965, the Library of Congress started a develop
ment program to apply computer technology to the
creation and distribution of its large pool of biblio
graphic data.
Known as the MARC Project (Machine Readable
Cataloging), this effort eventually resulted in establish
ment of a national and international standard for
creating magnetic tapes containing all the information
normally found on printed Library of Congress cards
cards which form the backbone of the cataloging system
in nearly every major research library in North America.
For several years now the Library of Congress has
been distributing weekly magnetic tapes containing
machine readable bibliographic records for currently
catalogued books. The service began with English lan
guage books and late in the current fiscal year will be
extended to French titles, to be followed by titles in
other romance languages and in German.
The MARC tapes form one of the foundations of the
BALLOTS system. But BALLOTS also will permit
libraries at Stanford to create their own bibliographic
records for items not yet represented in the MARC
service. Machine readable bibliographic records from
MARC now make it possible for staff of the Stanford
Libraries to:
1. Search the files for information on a book,
whether the information is known precisely or
imprecisely.
2. Create purchase orders for books without the
requirement to retype the data.
3. Have the computer print catalog cards without the
requirement for any further typing or
proofreading.

(This space paid for by News and Publications)
4. Sort the cards by computer (before they are*
printed), resulting in the saving of the human labor
which would otherwise be necessary to sort the
close to one million cards prepared each year at
Stanford.
5. Notify interested library patrons that requested
books have arrived and are available for use.
These are just a few of the major activities which
Project BALLOTS now performs.
Computer access will, however, allow the user of the
Meyer Library to determine whether the Meyer Library
has the book and whether it is on the shelf. It thus
provides a more up-to-date inventory than found in the
printed catalog which is now cumulated every other year
and provided with quarterly supplements.
There are many others, such as preparing spine labels
which permits books to be identified and shelved
together in the stacks, gathering statistics, and upgrading
or otherwise editing existing bibliographic data. In the
near future the system will provide the capability to post
and update control files applicable to ordered items
(such as change of titles, delay in publication, etc.).
BALLOTS: An advanced, on-line facility
Research and development into computer applica
tions has been under way in North American research
libraries for two decades and especially during the last
seven years. Most of the applications have been to
circulation and technical processes, while nearly all have
relied upon the conventional batch processing com
puting environment. t
The BALLOTS system now becoming operational at
Stanford is substantially different from these earlier
efforts.
Since its inception BALLOTS has been oriented
toward on-line data processing, an approach which is
being found increasingly practical by other library
systems as well. BALLOTS employs technology and
software far more complex than that required for batch
operations. The complexity of on-line operations in
comparison with batch (or "off-line") operations tor the
bibliographic work done at Stanford has been estimated
to range from 10 to 50 times greater.
The development of an on-line system is possible only
in a computer environment characterized by great
intellectual strength and extensive experience. The Stan
ford University Libraries are fortunate to be able to
work in a university environment characterized by this
competence and degree of excellence.
Basically, an on-line system permits a transaction to
be conducted and brought to a relatively immediate
conclusion, whereas a batch system requires all transac
tions to be deferred (i.e., batched) for a processing job in
the computer and its printer.
The Library is a very transaction-oriented system. At
Stanford the total number of transactions of all types is
about 2,000,000 per year, or an average of about 8,000
each day.
When a library transaction is being conducted, the
patron or the staff member usually needs an immediate,
or at least a rapid, response. When a student or faculty
member cannot find a desired book on the shelf, he
wants to know now whether it is charged to some other
user-not tomorrow or next week.
When an acquisition librarian receives a book pur
chase request, he has to know at once whether the book
has already been ordered—not a week or a day later.
Thus, the library operation is typically an on-line
manual system. The availability of on-line expertise at
Stanford plus the possibility of obtaining external giant
monies to fund development work combined to in
fluence the direction of the development effort toward
an advanced, on-line facility. (See accompanying story
on The people-andprograms-behind BALLOTS.)
What BALLOTS will do for the library staff and users
One way to envision what BALLOTS will do is to
look at some of the limitations of current manual
systems. Take book circulation, for instance.
At present, Stanford library users must write their
names, addresses, and all the book information onto a
card for each book they desire to charge out. The charge
card is in two parts—one goes with the book and the
other is filed by call number so the location ol each
book can be known.
This system obviously has two inconveniences: one
for the patron and one for the library staff. Much of the
patron's time is consumed writing repetitive information
which could easily be recorded by data collection
devices and machine-readable identification cards, one
for the book and one for the patron.
Much staff time is consumed arranging and filing
charge cards and the work is subject to human error.
Furthermore, in the manual system, in order to find out
which books are overdue, one must run through the
whole file even including cards for books which are not
overdue.
Book purchasing is another area of potential change
through automation. When a book is recommended for
purchase, very often the exact title is not known, the
author's name may be incomplete or misspelled, or
authorship may even be attributed to the wrong organi
zation or person.
The control file for books on order contains a few
tens of thousands of copies of purchase orders; these
copies are on 3"x5" slips, which makes them difficult to
search and hard to maintain in file.
It is economically prohibitive in a manual system to
maintain outstanding order files in several sequences to
account for variations. Typically, a copy of a purchase
order is filed in only one location in the file; therefore,
the required information on an ordered title can be
found in only one place in the file.
Furthermore, the file itself is available in only one
location a serious geographic limitation to the flow of
bibliographic information in the academic community.
Consider next the problem of searching for a book in
a manual file such as a conventional card catalog.
The typical card catalog is arranged in "dictionary"
form, with authors, titles, subjects, and corporate bodies
all interfiled in one alphabet. Suppose, as is not
unreasonable, that a library user or staff member needs
to search for an item under several different access
points simultaneously. Let us say he wants to find works
on the recycling of solid wastes and the generation of
electric power. Practically speaking, he cannot do this in
the card catalog, because it is basically a single access
file.
Only with very great inconvenience to himself (and
others) and with greatly diminished response time is it
possible for a user to conduct a "coordinated search" in
a manual file. Most users would despair at the thought of
such a laborious and cumbersome task. Yet the com
puter otters the opportunity of conducting such multi
ple access searches easily, conveniently, and quickly
thus enlarging greatly the user's power to retrieve
citations from the file.
Beyond the immediate benefits to the Library staff,
the University intends to make its public bibliographic
files available to the community at the earliest possible
date. The BALLOTS-MARC file, consisting of Library of
Congress MARC records, is now searchable via SHIRES
from any terminal on campus, including typewriter
terminals. The same searching language used by the
library for staff searching is available to the public.
How BALLOTS will look to users
Librarians have labored long under the limitations of
files which have been available in only one place. A
requirement of an automated library system, therefore,
is extension of file access beyond the confines of one
room, one building, or even one campus.
Fortunately, the computer terminal is a device which
readily permits this multiplication of file access. Com
puter video terminals (CRT's) themselves have been
evolving actively only for the past decade. Development
work has been carried out with typewriter terminals, like
the IBM 2741, in order to gain experience, test the
feasibility of multiple access searching software, and, of
course, to write and debug systems and applications
programs.
But it was obvious that the typewriter terminal could
never be satisfactorily used in a production library
environment—it was much too slow and noisy for the
heavy duty use and rapid response the library staff
needed from large bibliographic files, even though its
merit for low volume use was recognized.
The video display terminal or CRT seemed ideal for
the library's purpose, but it was not until last year that
enough choice of reliable terminals was available from
manufacturers so that / terminal could actually be
chosen for BALLOTS.
It was felt that Stanford could not afford a
customized terminal for each possible graphic applica
tion. After an extensive evaluation, the BALLOTS
Project and the Stanford Computation Center selected
,the Sanders 804 programmable terminal. A major
consideration in picking the Sanders unit was that the
unit itself is programmable (contains a minicomputer)
which allows it to meet the requirements of library
automation. Thus it will become one of the Campus
Facility's standard CRT's for video display.
The Sanders 804, pictured in center, shows a
bibliographic record which has been retrieved from the
BALLOTS-MARC file. Note that the record looks
similar to a printed Library of Congress card.

Ihe traditional format was maintained because of its
familiarity to the library staff and public, and to stress
the continuity of bibliographic records, whether manual
or computerized. (Other reformatted versions arc avail
able only to the library staff for editing, input of new
records, or update.)
A simple command language enables anyone, after a
brief instructional session, to enter simple searches for
material in the MARC file. As implementation proceeds,
other files will be accessible to the same kinds of search
commands. Here is an example of what an easy search
might look like:
find author commoner and title circle
After a little experience, the searcher learns to work
with abbreviated commands, and inputs:
fin a commoner and t circle
If Barry Commoner's The Closing Circle is in the
MARC data base, its full bibliographic citation, format
ted like a Library of Congress catalog card, will appear
on the screen of the terminal.
In the event that a searcher obtains only one book
corresponding to his search criteria, the bibliographic
data for that one title is immediately displayed to him.
If more than one book satisfies the search request, the
number of titles found by the computer search is
displayed:
"RESULT: 15 books."
At this point a very significant and advanced feature
of the BALLOTS system can be called into action:
BALLOTS searches arc interactive and negotiable.
The searcher can either expand or contract the search
result, or have each of the citations displayed before him
in turn, one at a time, just as if he were leafing through
cards in a catalog.
Except that he won't be bumping shoulders with
other users, waiting for someone else to finish using a
tray, and more importantly, he will be able to conduct
his search from any unit of the library where a CRT
terminal is located.
BALLOTS impact on the Stanford academic community
The library automation program called BALLOTS is
designed to:

1. Increase the speed of making library materials
available to the public.
The computer will enable the library to acquire,
catalog, and process materials somewhat more rapidly
than is currently the case.
2. Speed and simplify book circulation procedures.
In this area, two major improvements can be
expected.
One is to make available, from any point on campus
where there is a Sanders terminal, information on the
present location of any particular book in the automated
tiles and its present circulation status, when it is due
back, whether it is being held for another borrower, and
whether it can be held for the present inquirer, including
notification of availability.
Another goal is to make circulation as close as
possible to being a self-service process, with the
attendant simplicity and speed that would derive there
from.
3. Enlarge the breadth and depth of access to local
bibliographic records by going beyond the limited access
points provided by manual card catalogs.

Searchers will no longer be confined to exact and full
author, title, or subject entry point-bibliographic
records will be findable from parts of the entries and the
sequence of terms will no longer be so important.
4. Spread access to the bibliographic record through
out the user community by making it available wherever
a terminal is located.
It should be possible from any terminal on campus
for any student, professor, or staff member with a
budget account to find out what is in the automated
library system and what material is on order.
Information should cover Meyer Library as well as all
material newly processed by BALLOTS for the Main
Library system, all major branches which have
catalogued collections, and all of the Coordinate Li
braries that implement the system.
5. Facilitate eventual access to national and regional
data bases.
Toward the end of the 1975-79 period, it is to be
hoped that there will be economical ways of accessing
rather large data bases that are presently being developed
or are proposed for early development.
. This may include in machine-readable form the
800,000 entry catalog of recently acquired books in the
University of California library system, the Library of
Congress' National Union Catalog, the California State
Library Union Catalog, and the New York Times Data
Bank.
6. In conjunction with other systems, such as SPIRES,
begin to provide special bibliographic services to mem
bers of the academic community.
These special services will include the preparation of
"demand bibliographies," and the possible servicing of
data archives, such as opinion polls, U.S. census data,
and the like.
7. Contribute to deescalation of library costs.
This will be accomplished by assigning to the com
puter repetitive tasks, such as sorting, formatting,
printing, arranging, selecting, and otherwise mani
pulating or maintaining a bibliographic record. Slowing
down of library cost rises will lead to operating costs
lower than manual projections by the beginning of the
next decade.
The Library of Congress has begun a new and
significant program for libiary users. Designated CIP (for
Cataloging In Publication), this program makes biblio
graphic data on new books available almost immediately,
often before publication. CIP information is included in
the regular MARC Distribution Service, and is available
on BALLOTS files.
A special computerized searching facility in
BALLOTS-the Standing Search Request-will search all
MARC entries, including CIP information, as tapes come
in from Washington each week. If a specific search has
not made a hit, the Library can request the BALLOTS
system to continue searching the incoming tapes each
week for a pre-set number ol weeks.
Library staff will no longer have to waste time
repeatedly looking for cataloging information, and
bibliographic information and books will be available to
potential library users more rapidly than is possible in
the manual system.

guage books and late in the current fiscal year will be
extended to French titles, to be followed by titles in
other romance languages and in German.
The MARC tapes form one of the foundations of the
BALLOTS system. But BALLOTS also will permit
libraries at Stanford to create their own bibliographic
records for items not yet represented in the MARC
service. Machine readable bibliographic records from
MARC now make it possible for staff of the Stanford
Libraries to:
1. Search the files for information on a book,
whether the information is known precisely or
imprecisely.
2. Create purchase orders for books without the
requirement to retype the data.
3. Have the computer print catalog cards without the
requirement for any further typing or
proofreading.

(This space paid for by News and Publications)
4. Sort the cards by computer (before they are*
printed), resulting in the saving of the human labor
which would otherwise be necessary to sort the
close to one million cards prepared each year at
Stanford.
5. Notify interested library patrons that requested
books have arrived and are available for use.
These are just a few of the major activities which
Project BALLOTS now performs.
Computer access will, however, allow the user of the
Meyer Library to determine whether the Meyer Library
has the book and whether it is on the shelf. It thus
provides a more up-to-date inventory than found in the
printed catalog which is now cumulated every other year
and provided with quarterly supplements.
There are many others, such as preparing spine labels
which permits books to be identified and shelved
together in the stacks, gathering statistics, and upgrading
or otherwise editing existing bibliographic data. In the
near future the system will provide the capability to post
and update control files applicable to ordered items
(such as change of titles, delay in publication, etc.).
BALLOTS: An advanced, on-line facility
Research and development into computer applica
tions has been under way in North American research
libraries for two decades and especially during the last
seven years. Most of the applications have been to
circulation and technical processes, while nearly all have
relied upon the conventional batch processing com
puting environment. t
The BALLOTS system now becoming operational at
Stanford is substantially different from these earlier
efforts.
Since its inception BALLOTS has been oriented
toward on-line data processing, an approach which is
being found increasingly practical by other library
systems as well. BALLOTS employs technology and
software far more complex than that required for batch
operations. The complexity of on-line operations in
comparison with batch (or "off-line") operations tor the
bibliographic work done at Stanford has been estimated
to range from 10 to 50 times greater.
The development of an on-line system is possible only
in a computer environment characterized by great
intellectual strength and extensive experience. The Stan
ford University Libraries are fortunate to be able to
work in a university environment characterized by this
competence and degree of excellence.
Basically, an on-line system permits a transaction to
be conducted and brought to a relatively immediate
conclusion, whereas a batch system requires all transac
tions to be deferred (i.e., batched) for a processing job in
the computer and its printer.
The Library is a very transaction-oriented system. At
Stanford the total number of transactions of all types is
about 2,000,000 per year, or an average of about 8,000
each day.
When a library transaction is being conducted, the
patron or the staff member usually needs an immediate,
or at least a rapid, response. When a student or faculty
member cannot find a desired book on the shelf, he
wants to know now whether it is charged to some other
user-not tomorrow or next week.
When an acquisition librarian receives a book pur
chase request, he has to know at once whether the book
has already been ordered—not a week or a day later.
Thus, the library operation is typically an on-line
manual system. The availability of on-line expertise at
Stanford plus the possibility of obtaining external giant
monies to fund development work combined to in
fluence the direction of the development effort toward
an advanced, on-line facility. (See accompanying story
on The people-andprograms-behind BALLOTS.)
What BALLOTS will do for the library staff and users
One way to envision what BALLOTS will do is to
look at some of the limitations of current manual
systems. Take book circulation, for instance.
At present, Stanford library users must write their
names, addresses, and all the book information onto a
card for each book they desire to charge out. The charge
card is in two parts—one goes with the book and the
other is filed by call number so the location ol each
book can be known.
This system obviously has two inconveniences: one
for the patron and one for the library staff. Much of the
patron's time is consumed writing repetitive information
which could easily be recorded by data collection
devices and machine-readable identification cards, one
for the book and one for the patron.
Much staff time is consumed arranging and filing
charge cards and the work is subject to human error.
Furthermore, in the manual system, in order to find out
which books are overdue, one must run through the
whole file even including cards for books which are not
overdue.
Book purchasing is another area of potential change
through automation. When a book is recommended for
purchase, very often the exact title is not known, the
author's name may be incomplete or misspelled, or
authorship may even be attributed to the wrong organi
zation or person.
The control file for books on order contains a few
tens of thousands of copies of purchase orders; these
copies are on 3"x5" slips, which makes them difficult to
search and hard to maintain in file.
It is economically prohibitive in a manual system to
maintain outstanding order files in several sequences to
account for variations. Typically, a copy of a purchase
order is filed in only one location in the file; therefore,
the required information on an ordered title can be
found in only one place in the file.
Furthermore, the file itself is available in only one
location a serious geographic limitation to the flow of
bibliographic information in the academic community.
Consider next the problem of searching for a book in
a manual file such as a conventional card catalog.
The typical card catalog is arranged in "dictionary"
form, with authors, titles, subjects, and corporate bodies
all interfiled in one alphabet. Suppose, as is not
unreasonable, that a library user or staff member needs
to search for an item under several different access
points simultaneously. Let us say he wants to find works
on the recycling of solid wastes and the generation of
electric power. Practically speaking, he cannot do this in
the card catalog, because it is basically a single access
file.
Only with very great inconvenience to himself (and
others) and with greatly diminished response time is it
possible for a user to conduct a "coordinated search" in
a manual file. Most users would despair at the thought of
such a laborious and cumbersome task. Yet the com
puter otters the opportunity of conducting such multi
ple access searches easily, conveniently, and quickly
thus enlarging greatly the user's power to retrieve
citations from the file.
Beyond the immediate benefits to the Library staff,
the University intends to make its public bibliographic
files available to the community at the earliest possible
date. The BALLOTS-MARC file, consisting of Library of
Congress MARC records, is now searchable via SHIRES
from any terminal on campus, including typewriter
terminals. The same searching language used by the
library for staff searching is available to the public.
How BALLOTS will look to users
Librarians have labored long under the limitations of
files which have been available in only one place. A
requirement of an automated library system, therefore,
is extension of file access beyond the confines of one
room, one building, or even one campus.
Fortunately, the computer terminal is a device which
readily permits this multiplication of file access. Com
puter video terminals (CRT's) themselves have been
evolving actively only for the past decade. Development
work has been carried out with typewriter terminals, like
the IBM 2741, in order to gain experience, test the
feasibility of multiple access searching software, and, of
course, to write and debug systems and applications
programs.
But it was obvious that the typewriter terminal could
never be satisfactorily used in a production library
environment—it was much too slow and noisy for the
heavy duty use and rapid response the library staff
needed from large bibliographic files, even though its
merit for low volume use was recognized.
The video display terminal or CRT seemed ideal for
the library's purpose, but it was not until last year that
enough choice of reliable terminals was available from
manufacturers so that / terminal could actually be
chosen for BALLOTS.
It was felt that Stanford could not afford a
customized terminal for each possible graphic applica
tion. After an extensive evaluation, the BALLOTS
Project and the Stanford Computation Center selected
,the Sanders 804 programmable terminal. A major
consideration in picking the Sanders unit was that the
unit itself is programmable (contains a minicomputer)
which allows it to meet the requirements of library
automation. Thus it will become one of the Campus
Facility's standard CRT's for video display.
The Sanders 804, pictured in center, shows a
bibliographic record which has been retrieved from the
BALLOTS-MARC file. Note that the record looks
similar to a printed Library of Congress card.

Ihe traditional format was maintained because of its
familiarity to the library staff and public, and to stress
the continuity of bibliographic records, whether manual
or computerized. (Other reformatted versions arc avail
able only to the library staff for editing, input of new
records, or update.)
A simple command language enables anyone, after a
brief instructional session, to enter simple searches for
material in the MARC file. As implementation proceeds,
other files will be accessible to the same kinds of search
commands. Here is an example of what an easy search
might look like:
find author commoner and title circle
After a little experience, the searcher learns to work
with abbreviated commands, and inputs:
fin a commoner and t circle
If Barry Commoner's The Closing Circle is in the
MARC data base, its full bibliographic citation, format
ted like a Library of Congress catalog card, will appear
on the screen of the terminal.
In the event that a searcher obtains only one book
corresponding to his search criteria, the bibliographic
data for that one title is immediately displayed to him.
If more than one book satisfies the search request, the
number of titles found by the computer search is
displayed:
"RESULT: 15 books."
At this point a very significant and advanced feature
of the BALLOTS system can be called into action:
BALLOTS searches arc interactive and negotiable.
The searcher can either expand or contract the search
result, or have each of the citations displayed before him
in turn, one at a time, just as if he were leafing through
cards in a catalog.
Except that he won't be bumping shoulders with
other users, waiting for someone else to finish using a
tray, and more importantly, he will be able to conduct
his search from any unit of the library where a CRT
terminal is located.
BALLOTS impact on the Stanford academic community
The library automation program called BALLOTS is
designed to:

1. Increase the speed of making library materials
available to the public.
The computer will enable the library to acquire,
catalog, and process materials somewhat more rapidly
than is currently the case.
2. Speed and simplify book circulation procedures.
In this area, two major improvements can be
expected.
One is to make available, from any point on campus
where there is a Sanders terminal, information on the
present location of any particular book in the automated
tiles and its present circulation status, when it is due
back, whether it is being held for another borrower, and
whether it can be held for the present inquirer, including
notification of availability.
Another goal is to make circulation as close as
possible to being a self-service process, with the
attendant simplicity and speed that would derive there
from.
3. Enlarge the breadth and depth of access to local
bibliographic records by going beyond the limited access
points provided by manual card catalogs.

Searchers will no longer be confined to exact and full
author, title, or subject entry point-bibliographic
records will be findable from parts of the entries and the
sequence of terms will no longer be so important.
4. Spread access to the bibliographic record through
out the user community by making it available wherever
a terminal is located.
It should be possible from any terminal on campus
for any student, professor, or staff member with a
budget account to find out what is in the automated
library system and what material is on order.
Information should cover Meyer Library as well as all
material newly processed by BALLOTS for the Main
Library system, all major branches which have
catalogued collections, and all of the Coordinate Li
braries that implement the system.
5. Facilitate eventual access to national and regional
data bases.
Toward the end of the 1975-79 period, it is to be
hoped that there will be economical ways of accessing
rather large data bases that are presently being developed
or are proposed for early development.
. This may include in machine-readable form the
800,000 entry catalog of recently acquired books in the
University of California library system, the Library of
Congress' National Union Catalog, the California State
Library Union Catalog, and the New York Times Data
Bank.
6. In conjunction with other systems, such as SPIRES,
begin to provide special bibliographic services to mem
bers of the academic community.
These special services will include the preparation of
"demand bibliographies," and the possible servicing of
data archives, such as opinion polls, U.S. census data,
and the like.
7. Contribute to deescalation of library costs.
This will be accomplished by assigning to the com
puter repetitive tasks, such as sorting, formatting,
printing, arranging, selecting, and otherwise mani
pulating or maintaining a bibliographic record. Slowing
down of library cost rises will lead to operating costs
lower than manual projections by the beginning of the
next decade.
The Library of Congress has begun a new and
significant program for libiary users. Designated CIP (for
Cataloging In Publication), this program makes biblio
graphic data on new books available almost immediately,
often before publication. CIP information is included in
the regular MARC Distribution Service, and is available
on BALLOTS files.
A special computerized searching facility in
BALLOTS-the Standing Search Request-will search all
MARC entries, including CIP information, as tapes come
in from Washington each week. If a specific search has
not made a hit, the Library can request the BALLOTS
system to continue searching the incoming tapes each
week for a pre-set number ol weeks.
Library staff will no longer have to waste time
repeatedly looking for cataloging information, and
bibliographic information and books will be available to
potential library users more rapidly than is possible in
the manual system.

the University Libraries staff.
Why libraries need computers
The "information explosion" which universities have
helped create in recent decades has inundated libraries
and research centers with so many new publications that
traditional manual systems are becoming increasingly
unable to handle the load.
Libraries are in large measure still using many of the
basic techniques devised over the last 2,600 years. These
techniques were considered moderately adequate until
the Second World War. But library systems now are
inconvenient of access, slow in response, difficult to use,
frustrating in complexity, and unresponsive to changing
needs.
Problem of huge files
Files have grown so large that they are virtually
becoming unmanageable and many libraries have
seriously considered ceasing to add to their card catalogs
and starting afresh for new acquisitions with some
degree of automation.
* Ohio State University has announced that its card
catalog will be closed and replaced by computer-oriented
bibliographic services in 1976.
* The Library of Congress has predicted that, at the
present rate of growth, by 1980 its own public catalog
will contain some 32,000,000 cards—a tile so vast that
its manageability is questionable.
* Even at Stanford, which is the nation's eighth
largest research library, the various catalogs available to
the public are estimated to contain some ten million
cards.
To create this major bibliographic tool-key to the
millions of bibliographic units at Stanford—requires
many formalized activities and functions which are
routine and which do not require interpretive, scholarly,
or qualitative judgments. Many of these lunctions are
almost ideally suited to machine processing.
More cost, less service
Constantly rising costs are another factor in the
libraries' desire to turn to computers. Labor costs go up
5 to 6 percent each year, whereas the cost of computer
transactions goes up at only half that rate.
It is thus clear that at some point in the future the
University should be paying increasingly less for library
services under a machine system than if it stuck with thu
tried and tested manual process with its ever increasing
complexities and frustrations.
And at the same time a machine system is a more
powerful instrument for giving full, very precise, and
more rapid access to local and national library resources.
Library collections double in size about every 16
years. Even in periods of social unrest or economic
dislocation, the spiral of publishing and communication
activity continues upwards.
Unfortunately, when a library doubles in size, the
effort required to maintain an equivalent level of service
more than doubles-and therein lies the rub.
The large research library at times seems to resemble
a dinosaur or a book museum. In the one instance, it is
slow and ponderous, not terribly adaptive or responsive
to changes in environment. In the other, it grows and
accumulates material relentlessly~yct the adequacy of
its services diminishes as it increases in size because it is
so difficult to access anything within a reasonable time.
Modernization and service improvement needed
The situation may be aggravated by the apparent
increase of interest in interdisciplinary or multidiscipli
nary studies which runs counter to pressures for physical
decentralization of libraries. The scholar in urban prob
lems has to shuttle between the Main Library, the Law
Library, the Jackson Library of Business, and perhaps
the Engineering and Art libraries.
If lie is unable to determine from some central place
(or better yet, from his own office, department, or
laboratory) whether one library or another possesses a
book and also whether that book is available for use, he
may give up in all but the most pressing searches.
In frustration, potential library users may turn to
other services or devices for their information needs—
perhaps building a personal library, long distance tele
phone conversations with colleagues, costly and time
consuming conferences, purchase of commercial inform
ation service, or the multiplication of branch libraries.
Students, and particularly graduate students, research
staff and faculty are now increasingly critical of the
ability of libraries to respond to current needs. Yet the
library is still a major and essential component in a huge
network of information processing; it too must be
brought into the 20th century.
Efforts to make this change at Stanford began more
than six years ago in the Stanford library automation
project. Involving 100 people and nearly $2 million to
date, it is called Project BALLOTS-for Bibliographic
Automation of Large Library Operations using a Time
sharing System. One ot the most advanced library
automation projects in the country, it still will require
several more years to complete. (See table.)
What BALLOTS can do for you
Computer terminals will aid you in 1973 and later
years to borrow books, search for publications you need,
determine what the library has on a subject for your
interest, and determine if a bibliographic citation that
interests you is now in the Stanford Library and if so,
where it is and whether it is in use.
This effort is the result of computer programs written
to operate television-like terminals that arc now in the
Main Library and will be added in Meyer and other
major library branches in the course of the next two to
four years. (Any typewriter terminal on campus can
already search the BALLOTS-MARC file, which consists
of current Library of Congress catalog data.)
The library staff will be able to help you with your
searches during 1973-4; it is expected that public use of
the TV-like terminals may start as early as 1974.

How BALLOTS works
Using terminals with cathode ray tubes, popularly
called "CRT's," library staff now conducts searches of
bibliographic files, enters commands and tells the com
puter to format data for purchase orders, sort the orders
alphabetically by vendor, and print them overnight.
The computer will also print messages notifying
faculty or student requesters that their materials have
arrived. Search commands will find Library of Congress
bibliographic data if available, and if not available, will
eventually enable the staff to create their own data on
the spot.
Similarly, commands entered at the terminal will
instruct the computer to properly format desired biblio
graphic data, sort it in batches for the main and
departmental libraries, and within each batch, print out
the complete set of library cards already sorted in
correct alphabetical filing sequence.
The magnitude of this operation is appreciated when
it is realized that the typical large research library
prepares between half a million and a million cards each
year—a job which in the manual system is not very
interesting and is susceptible to error.
In circulation, data collection devices and machine
readable identification cards will speed circulation tran
sactions and virtually eliminate the nuisance of filling
out charge cards by hand.
In summary the system will aid processing of roman
alphabet material acquired, and items the catalog listing
of which can be transliterated. There will be a consider
able time period before a sufficiently large fraction of
the library's holdings is contained in machine-readable
fdes to make automatic search rewarding to the general
user.
This time varies depending upon discipline. In the
sciences, it might be as short as two to five years. In the
humanities perhaps as much as 30 to 50 years, or until
such time as technological breakthroughs provide in
expensive, reliable conversion to machine-readable form
of massive bibliographic files-a prospect which docs not
seem imminent at this writing.
Unfortunately, a majority of the use of the library by
scientists involves the search for journal articles and
these will not be included in the initial implementation
of the system because of the expense of buying and
processing machine-readable data bases.
Typically, lists in machine-readable form for journal
citations covering a broad subject cost from
$10,000-25,000 each year, more than that to store
locally, and still more to convert them to internal

machine formats like SPIRES so that they can be run
against search programs. (SPIRES—the Stanford Public
Information REtrieval System-is a computer-based,
generalized information system. See Campus Report
Oct. 11, 1972 p. 1-2.)
Thus from the point of view of general patron search
of the library catalog, we must consider that BALLOTS
piovides a benefit of increasing utility over a period of
years.
The Meyer Library represents an exception in that all
its holdings (except journalarticles) will included in
the on-line catalog. The Meyer catalog is now printed,
bound, and distributed in book form to several locations
on campus.
Computer applications in bibliographic data
In 1965, the Library of Congress started a develop
ment program to apply computer technology to the
creation and distribution of its large pool of biblio
graphic data.
Known as the MARC Project (Machine Readable
Cataloging), this effort eventually resulted in establish
ment of a national and international standard for
creating magnetic tapes containing all the information
normally found on printed Library of Congress cards
cards which form the backbone of the cataloging system
in nearly every major research library in North America.
For several years now the Library of Congress has
been distributing weekly magnetic tapes containing
machine readable bibliographic records for currently
catalogued books. The service began with English lan
guage books and late in the current fiscal year will be
extended to French titles, to be followed by titles in
other romance languages and in German.
The MARC tapes form one of the foundations of the
BALLOTS system. But BALLOTS also will permit
libraries at Stanford to create their own bibliographic
records for items not yet represented in the MARC
service. Machine readable bibliographic records from
MARC now make it possible for staff of the Stanford
Libraries to:
1. Search the files for information on a book,
whether the information is known precisely or
imprecisely.
2. Create purchase orders for books without the

3. Have the computer print catalog cards without the
requirement for any further typing or
proofreading.

4. Sort the cards by computer (before they are*
printed), resulting in the saving of the human labor
which would otherwise be necessary to sort the
close to one million cards prepared each year at
Stanford.
5. Notify interested library patrons that requested
books have arrived and are available for use.
These are just a few of the major activities which
Project BALLOTS now performs.
Computer access will, however, allow the user of the
Meyer Library to determine whether the Meyer Library
has the book and whether it is on the shelf. It thus
provides a more up-to-date inventory than found in the
printed catalog which is now cumulated every other year
and provided with quarterly supplements.
There are many others, such as preparing spine labels
which permits books to be identified and shelved

BALLOTS impact on the Stanford academic community
The library automation program called BALLOTS is
designed to:

1. Increase the speed of making library materials
available to the public.
The computer will enable the library to acquire,
catalog, and process materials somewhat more rapidly
than is currently the case.
2. Speed and simplify book circulation procedures.
In this area, two major improvements can be
expected.
One is to make available, from any point on campus
where there is a Sanders terminal, information on the
present location of any particular book in the automated
tiles and its present circulation status, when it is due
back, whether it is being held for another borrower, and
whether it can be held for the present inquirer, including
notification of availability.
Another goal is to make circulation as close as
possible to being a self-service process, with the
attendant simplicity and speed that would derive there
from.
3. Enlarge the breadth and depth of access to local
bibliographic records by going beyond the limited access
points provided by manual card catalogs.

Searchers will no longer be confined to exact and full
author, title, or subject entry point-bibliographic
records will be findable from parts of the entries and the
sequence of terms will no longer be so important.
4. Spread access to the bibliographic record through
out the user community by making it available wherever
a terminal is located.
It should be possible from any terminal on campus
for any student, professor, or staff member with a
budget account to find out what is in the automated
library system and what material is on order.
Information should cover Meyer Library as well as all
material newly processed by BALLOTS for the Main
Library system, all major branches which have
catalogued collections, and all of the Coordinate Li
braries that implement the system.
5. Facilitate eventual access to national and regional
data bases.
Toward the end of the 1975-79 period, it is to be
hoped that there will be economical ways of accessing
rather large data bases that are presently being developed
or are proposed for early development.
. This may include in machine-readable form the
800,000 entry catalog of recently acquired books in the
University of California library system, the Library of
Congress' National Union Catalog, the California State
Library Union Catalog, and the New York Times Data
Bank.
6. In conjunction with other systems, such as SPIRES,
begin to provide special bibliographic services to mem
bers of the academic community.
These special services will include the preparation of
"demand bibliographies," and the possible servicing of
data archives, such as opinion polls, U.S. census data,
and the like.
7. Contribute to deescalation of library costs.
This will be accomplished by assigning to the com
puter repetitive tasks, such as sorting, formatting,
printing, arranging, selecting, and otherwise mani
pulating or maintaining a bibliographic record. Slowing
down of library cost rises will lead to operating costs
lower than manual projections by the beginning of the
next decade.
The Library of Congress has begun a new and
significant program for libiary users. Designated CIP (for

on BALLOTS files.
A special computerized searching facility in
BALLOTS-the Standing Search Request-will search all

week for a pre-set number ol weeks.

Why libraries need computers
The "information explosion" which universities have
helped create in recent decades has inundated libraries
and research centers with so many new publications that
traditional manual systems are becoming increasingly
unable to handle the load.
Libraries are in large measure still using many of the
basic techniques devised over the last 2,600 years. These
techniques were considered moderately adequate until
the Second World War. But library systems now are
inconvenient of access, slow in response, difficult to use,
frustrating in complexity, and unresponsive to changing
needs.
Problem of huge files
Files have grown so large that they are virtually
becoming unmanageable and many libraries have
seriously considered ceasing to add to their card catalogs
and starting afresh for new acquisitions with some
degree of automation.
* Ohio State University has announced that its card
catalog will be closed and replaced by computer-oriented
bibliographic services in 1976.
* The Library of Congress has predicted that, at the
present rate of growth, by 1980 its own public catalog
will contain some 32,000,000 cards—a tile so vast that
its manageability is questionable.
* Even at Stanford, which is the nation's eighth
largest research library, the various catalogs available to
the public are estimated to contain some ten million
cards.
To create this major bibliographic tool-key to the
millions of bibliographic units at Stanford—requires
many formalized activities and functions which are
routine and which do not require interpretive, scholarly,
or qualitative judgments. Many of these lunctions are
almost ideally suited to machine processing.
More cost, less service
Constantly rising costs are another factor in the
libraries' desire to turn to computers. Labor costs go up
5 to 6 percent each year, whereas the cost of computer
transactions goes up at only half that rate.
It is thus clear that at some point in the future the
University should be paying increasingly less for library
services under a machine system than if it stuck with thu
tried and tested manual process with its ever increasing
complexities and frustrations.
And at the same time a machine system is a more
powerful instrument for giving full, very precise, and
more rapid access to local and national library resources.
Library collections double in size about every 16
years. Even in periods of social unrest or economic
dislocation, the spiral of publishing and communication
activity continues upwards.
Unfortunately, when a library doubles in size, the
effort required to maintain an equivalent level of service
more than doubles-and therein lies the rub.
The large research library at times seems to resemble
a dinosaur or a book museum. In the one instance, it is
slow and ponderous, not terribly adaptive or responsive
to changes in environment. In the other, it grows and
accumulates material relentlessly~yct the adequacy of
its services diminishes as it increases in size because it is
so difficult to access anything within a reasonable time.
Modernization and service improvement needed
The situation may be aggravated by the apparent
increase of interest in interdisciplinary or multidiscipli
nary studies which runs counter to pressures for physical
decentralization of libraries. The scholar in urban prob
lems has to shuttle between the Main Library, the Law
Library, the Jackson Library of Business, and perhaps
the Engineering and Art libraries.
If lie is unable to determine from some central place
(or better yet, from his own office, department, or
laboratory) whether one library or another possesses a
book and also whether that book is available for use, he
may give up in all but the most pressing searches.
In frustration, potential library users may turn to
other services or devices for their information needs—
perhaps building a personal library, long distance tele
phone conversations with colleagues, costly and time
consuming conferences, purchase of commercial inform
ation service, or the multiplication of branch libraries.
Students, and particularly graduate students, research
staff and faculty are now increasingly critical of the
ability of libraries to respond to current needs. Yet the
library is still a major and essential component in a huge
network of information processing; it too must be
brought into the 20th century.
Efforts to make this change at Stanford began more
than six years ago in the Stanford library automation
project. Involving 100 people and nearly $2 million to
date, it is called Project BALLOTS-for Bibliographic
Automation of Large Library Operations using a Time
sharing System. One ot the most advanced library
automation projects in the country, it still will require
several more years to complete. (See table.)
What BALLOTS can do for you
Computer terminals will aid you in 1973 and later
years to borrow books, search for publications you need,
determine what the library has on a subject for your
interest, and determine if a bibliographic citation that
interests you is now in the Stanford Library and if so,
where it is and whether it is in use.
This effort is the result of computer programs written
to operate television-like terminals that arc now in the
Main Library and will be added in Meyer and other
major library branches in the course of the next two to
four years. (Any typewriter terminal on campus can
already search the BALLOTS-MARC file, which consists
of current Library of Congress catalog data.)
The library staff will be able to help you with your
searches during 1973-4; it is expected that public use of
the TV-like terminals may start as early as 1974.

How BALLOTS works
Using terminals with cathode ray tubes, popularly
called "CRT's," library staff now conducts searches of
bibliographic files, enters commands and tells the com
puter to format data for purchase orders, sort the orders
alphabetically by vendor, and print them overnight.
The computer will also print messages notifying
faculty or student requesters that their materials have
arrived. Search commands will find Library of Congress
bibliographic data if available, and if not available, will
eventually enable the staff to create their own data on
the spot.
Similarly, commands entered at the terminal will
instruct the computer to properly format desired biblio
graphic data, sort it in batches for the main and
departmental libraries, and within each batch, print out
the complete set of library cards already sorted in
correct alphabetical filing sequence.
The magnitude of this operation is appreciated when
it is realized that the typical large research library
prepares between half a million and a million cards each
year—a job which in the manual system is not very
interesting and is susceptible to error.
In circulation, data collection devices and machine
readable identification cards will speed circulation tran
sactions and virtually eliminate the nuisance of filling
out charge cards by hand.
In summary the system will aid processing of roman
alphabet material acquired, and items the catalog listing
of which can be transliterated. There will be a consider
able time period before a sufficiently large fraction of
the library's holdings is contained in machine-readable
fdes to make automatic search rewarding to the general
user.
This time varies depending upon discipline. In the
sciences, it might be as short as two to five years. In the
humanities perhaps as much as 30 to 50 years, or until
such time as technological breakthroughs provide in
expensive, reliable conversion to machine-readable form
of massive bibliographic files-a prospect which docs not
seem imminent at this writing.
Unfortunately, a majority of the use of the library by
scientists involves the search for journal articles and
these will not be included in the initial implementation
of the system because of the expense of buying and
processing machine-readable data bases.
Typically, lists in machine-readable form for journal
citations covering a broad subject cost from
$10,000-25,000 each year, more than that to store
locally, and still more to convert them to internal

machine formats like SPIRES so that they can be run
against search programs. (SPIRES—the Stanford Public
Information REtrieval System-is a computer-based,
generalized information system. See Campus Report
Oct. 11, 1972 p. 1-2.)
Thus from the point of view of general patron search
of the library catalog, we must consider that BALLOTS
piovides a benefit of increasing utility over a period of
years.
The Meyer Library represents an exception in that all
its holdings (except journalarticles) will included in
the on-line catalog. The Meyer catalog is now printed,
bound, and distributed in book form to several locations
on campus.
Computer applications in bibliographic data
In 1965, the Library of Congress started a develop
ment program to apply computer technology to the
creation and distribution of its large pool of biblio
graphic data.
Known as the MARC Project (Machine Readable
Cataloging), this effort eventually resulted in establish
ment of a national and international standard for
creating magnetic tapes containing all the information
normally found on printed Library of Congress cards
cards which form the backbone of the cataloging system
in nearly every major research library in North America.
For several years now the Library of Congress has
been distributing weekly magnetic tapes containing
machine readable bibliographic records for currently
catalogued books. The service began with English lan
guage books and late in the current fiscal year will be
extended to French titles, to be followed by titles in
other romance languages and in German.
The MARC tapes form one of the foundations of the
BALLOTS system. But BALLOTS also will permit
libraries at Stanford to create their own bibliographic
records for items not yet represented in the MARC
service. Machine readable bibliographic records from
MARC now make it possible for staff of the Stanford
Libraries to:
1. Search the files for information on a book,
whether the information is known precisely or
imprecisely.
2. Create purchase orders for books without the
requirement to retype the data.
3. Have the computer print catalog cards without the
requirement for any further typing or
proofreading.

(This space paid for by News and Publications)
4. Sort the cards by computer (before they are*
printed), resulting in the saving of the human labor
which would otherwise be necessary to sort the
close to one million cards prepared each year at
Stanford.
5. Notify interested library patrons that requested
books have arrived and are available for use.
These are just a few of the major activities which
Project BALLOTS now performs.
Computer access will, however, allow the user of the
Meyer Library to determine whether the Meyer Library
has the book and whether it is on the shelf. It thus
provides a more up-to-date inventory than found in the
printed catalog which is now cumulated every other year
and provided with quarterly supplements.
There are many others, such as preparing spine labels
which permits books to be identified and shelved
together in the stacks, gathering statistics, and upgrading
or otherwise editing existing bibliographic data. In the
near future the system will provide the capability to post
and update control files applicable to ordered items
(such as change of titles, delay in publication, etc.).
BALLOTS: An advanced, on-line facility
Research and development into computer applica
tions has been under way in North American research
libraries for two decades and especially during the last
seven years. Most of the applications have been to
circulation and technical processes, while nearly all have
relied upon the conventional batch processing com
puting environment. t
The BALLOTS system now becoming operational at
Stanford is substantially different from these earlier
efforts.
Since its inception BALLOTS has been oriented
toward on-line data processing, an approach which is
being found increasingly practical by other library
systems as well. BALLOTS employs technology and
software far more complex than that required for batch
operations. The complexity of on-line operations in
comparison with batch (or "off-line") operations tor the
bibliographic work done at Stanford has been estimated
to range from 10 to 50 times greater.
The development of an on-line system is possible only
in a computer environment characterized by great
intellectual strength and extensive experience. The Stan
ford University Libraries are fortunate to be able to
work in a university environment characterized by this
competence and degree of excellence.
Basically, an on-line system permits a transaction to
be conducted and brought to a relatively immediate
conclusion, whereas a batch system requires all transac
tions to be deferred (i.e., batched) for a processing job in
the computer and its printer.
The Library is a very transaction-oriented system. At
Stanford the total number of transactions of all types is
about 2,000,000 per year, or an average of about 8,000
each day.
When a library transaction is being conducted, the
patron or the staff member usually needs an immediate,
or at least a rapid, response. When a student or faculty
member cannot find a desired book on the shelf, he
wants to know now whether it is charged to some other
user-not tomorrow or next week.
When an acquisition librarian receives a book pur
chase request, he has to know at once whether the book
has already been ordered—not a week or a day later.
Thus, the library operation is typically an on-line
manual system. The availability of on-line expertise at
Stanford plus the possibility of obtaining external giant
monies to fund development work combined to in
fluence the direction of the development effort toward
an advanced, on-line facility. (See accompanying story
on The people-andprograms-behind BALLOTS.)
What BALLOTS will do for the library staff and users
One way to envision what BALLOTS will do is to
look at some of the limitations of current manual
systems. Take book circulation, for instance.
At present, Stanford library users must write their
names, addresses, and all the book information onto a
card for each book they desire to charge out. The charge
card is in two parts—one goes with the book and the
other is filed by call number so the location ol each
book can be known.
This system obviously has two inconveniences: one
for the patron and one for the library staff. Much of the
patron's time is consumed writing repetitive information
which could easily be recorded by data collection
devices and machine-readable identification cards, one
for the book and one for the patron.
Much staff time is consumed arranging and filing
charge cards and the work is subject to human error.
Furthermore, in the manual system, in order to find out
which books are overdue, one must run through the
whole file even including cards for books which are not
overdue.
Book purchasing is another area of potential change
through automation. When a book is recommended for
purchase, very often the exact title is not known, the
author's name may be incomplete or misspelled, or
authorship may even be attributed to the wrong organi
zation or person.
The control file for books on order contains a few
tens of thousands of copies of purchase orders; these
copies are on 3"x5" slips, which makes them difficult to
search and hard to maintain in file.
It is economically prohibitive in a manual system to
maintain outstanding order files in several sequences to
account for variations. Typically, a copy of a purchase
order is filed in only one location in the file; therefore,
the required information on an ordered title can be
found in only one place in the file.
Furthermore, the file itself is available in only one
location a serious geographic limitation to the flow of
bibliographic information in the academic community.
Consider next the problem of searching for a book in
a manual file such as a conventional card catalog.
The typical card catalog is arranged in "dictionary"
form, with authors, titles, subjects, and corporate bodies
all interfiled in one alphabet. Suppose, as is not
unreasonable, that a library user or staff member needs
to search for an item under several different access
points simultaneously. Let us say he wants to find works
on the recycling of solid wastes and the generation of
electric power. Practically speaking, he cannot do this in
the card catalog, because it is basically a single access
file.
Only with very great inconvenience to himself (and
others) and with greatly diminished response time is it
possible for a user to conduct a "coordinated search" in
a manual file. Most users would despair at the thought of
such a laborious and cumbersome task. Yet the com
puter otters the opportunity of conducting such multi
ple access searches easily, conveniently, and quickly
thus enlarging greatly the user's power to retrieve
citations from the file.
Beyond the immediate benefits to the Library staff,
the University intends to make its public bibliographic
files available to the community at the earliest possible
date. The BALLOTS-MARC file, consisting of Library of
Congress MARC records, is now searchable via SHIRES
from any terminal on campus, including typewriter
terminals. The same searching language used by the
library for staff searching is available to the public.
How BALLOTS will look to users
Librarians have labored long under the limitations of
files which have been available in only one place. A
requirement of an automated library system, therefore,
is extension of file access beyond the confines of one
room, one building, or even one campus.
Fortunately, the computer terminal is a device which
readily permits this multiplication of file access. Com
puter video terminals (CRT's) themselves have been
evolving actively only for the past decade. Development
work has been carried out with typewriter terminals, like
the IBM 2741, in order to gain experience, test the
feasibility of multiple access searching software, and, of
course, to write and debug systems and applications
programs.
But it was obvious that the typewriter terminal could
never be satisfactorily used in a production library
environment—it was much too slow and noisy for the
heavy duty use and rapid response the library staff
needed from large bibliographic files, even though its
merit for low volume use was recognized.
The video display terminal or CRT seemed ideal for
the library's purpose, but it was not until last year that
enough choice of reliable terminals was available from
manufacturers so that / terminal could actually be
chosen for BALLOTS.
It was felt that Stanford could not afford a
customized terminal for each possible graphic applica
tion. After an extensive evaluation, the BALLOTS
Project and the Stanford Computation Center selected
,the Sanders 804 programmable terminal. A major
consideration in picking the Sanders unit was that the
unit itself is programmable (contains a minicomputer)
which allows it to meet the requirements of library
automation. Thus it will become one of the Campus
Facility's standard CRT's for video display.
The Sanders 804, pictured in center, shows a
bibliographic record which has been retrieved from the
BALLOTS-MARC file. Note that the record looks
similar to a printed Library of Congress card.

Ihe traditional format was maintained because of its
familiarity to the library staff and public, and to stress
the continuity of bibliographic records, whether manual
or computerized. (Other reformatted versions arc avail

A simple command language enables anyone, after a
brief instructional session, to enter simple searches for
material in the MARC file. As implementation proceeds,
other files will be accessible to the same kinds of search
commands. Here is an example of what an easy search
might look like:

The situation may be aggravated by the apparent
increase of interest in interdisciplinary or multidiscipli
nary studies which runs counter to pressures for physical
decentralization of libraries. The scholar in urban prob
lems has to shuttle between the Main Library, the Law
Library, the Jackson Library of Business, and perhaps
the Engineering and Art libraries.
If lie is unable to determine from some central place
(or better yet, from his own office, department, or
laboratory) whether one library or another possesses a
book and also whether that book is available for use, he
may give up in all but the most pressing searches.
In frustration, potential library users may turn to
other services or devices for their information needs—
perhaps building a personal library, long distance tele
phone conversations with colleagues, costly and time
consuming conferences, purchase of commercial inform
ation service, or the multiplication of branch libraries.
Students, and particularly graduate students, research
staff and faculty are now increasingly critical of the
ability of libraries to respond to current needs. Yet the
library is still a major and essential component in a huge
network of information processing; it too must be
brought into the 20th century.
Efforts to make this change at Stanford began more
than six years ago in the Stanford library automation
project. Involving 100 people and nearly $2 million to
date, it is called Project BALLOTS-for Bibliographic
Automation of Large Library Operations using a Time
sharing System. One ot the most advanced library
automation projects in the country, it still will require
several more years to complete. (See table.)
What BALLOTS can do for you
Computer terminals will aid you in 1973 and later
years to borrow books, search for publications you need,
determine what the library has on a subject for your
interest, and determine if a bibliographic citation that
interests you is now in the Stanford Library and if so,
where it is and whether it is in use.
This effort is the result of computer programs written
to operate television-like terminals that arc now in the
Main Library and will be added in Meyer and other
major library branches in the course of the next two to
four years. (Any typewriter terminal on campus can
already search the BALLOTS-MARC file, which consists
of current Library of Congress catalog data.)
The library staff will be able to help you with your
searches during 1973-4; it is expected that public use of
the TV-like terminals may start as early as 1974.

How BALLOTS works
Using terminals with cathode ray tubes, popularly
called "CRT's," library staff now conducts searches of
bibliographic files, enters commands and tells the com
puter to format data for purchase orders, sort the orders
alphabetically by vendor, and print them overnight.
The computer will also print messages notifying
faculty or student requesters that their materials have
arrived. Search commands will find Library of Congress
bibliographic data if available, and if not available, will
eventually enable the staff to create their own data on
the spot.
Similarly, commands entered at the terminal will
instruct the computer to properly format desired biblio
graphic data, sort it in batches for the main and
departmental libraries, and within each batch, print out
the complete set of library cards already sorted in
correct alphabetical filing sequence.
The magnitude of this operation is appreciated when
it is realized that the typical large research library
prepares between half a million and a million cards each
year—a job which in the manual system is not very
interesting and is susceptible to error.
In circulation, data collection devices and machine
readable identification cards will speed circulation tran
sactions and virtually eliminate the nuisance of filling
out charge cards by hand.
In summary the system will aid processing of roman
alphabet material acquired, and items the catalog listing
of which can be transliterated. There will be a consider
able time period before a sufficiently large fraction of
the library's holdings is contained in machine-readable
fdes to make automatic search rewarding to the general
user.
This time varies depending upon discipline. In the
sciences, it might be as short as two to five years. In the
humanities perhaps as much as 30 to 50 years, or until
such time as technological breakthroughs provide in
expensive, reliable conversion to machine-readable form
of massive bibliographic files-a prospect which docs not
seem imminent at this writing.
Unfortunately, a majority of the use of the library by
scientists involves the search for journal articles and
these will not be included in the initial implementation
of the system because of the expense of buying and
processing machine-readable data bases.
Typically, lists in machine-readable form for journal
citations covering a broad subject cost from
$10,000-25,000 each year, more than that to store
locally, and still more to convert them to internal

machine formats like SPIRES so that they can be run
against search programs. (SPIRES—the Stanford Public
Information REtrieval System-is a computer-based,
generalized information system. See Campus Report
Oct. 11, 1972 p. 1-2.)
Thus from the point of view of general patron search
of the library catalog, we must consider that BALLOTS
piovides a benefit of increasing utility over a period of
years.
The Meyer Library represents an exception in that all
its holdings (except journalarticles) will included in
the on-line catalog. The Meyer catalog is now printed,
bound, and distributed in book form to several locations
on campus.
Computer applications in bibliographic data
In 1965, the Library of Congress started a develop
ment program to apply computer technology to the
creation and distribution of its large pool of biblio
graphic data.
Known as the MARC Project (Machine Readable
Cataloging), this effort eventually resulted in establish
ment of a national and international standard for
creating magnetic tapes containing all the information
normally found on printed Library of Congress cards
cards which form the backbone of the cataloging system
in nearly every major research library in North America.
For several years now the Library of Congress has
been distributing weekly magnetic tapes containing
machine readable bibliographic records for currently
catalogued books. The service began with English lan
guage books and late in the current fiscal year will be
extended to French titles, to be followed by titles in
other romance languages and in German.
The MARC tapes form one of the foundations of the
BALLOTS system. But BALLOTS also will permit
libraries at Stanford to create their own bibliographic
records for items not yet represented in the MARC
service. Machine readable bibliographic records from
MARC now make it possible for staff of the Stanford
Libraries to:
1. Search the files for information on a book,
whether the information is known precisely or
imprecisely.
2. Create purchase orders for books without the
requirement to retype the data.
3. Have the computer print catalog cards without the
requirement for any further typing or
proofreading.

(This space paid for by News and Publications)
4. Sort the cards by computer (before they are*
printed), resulting in the saving of the human labor
which would otherwise be necessary to sort the
close to one million cards prepared each year at
Stanford.
5. Notify interested library patrons that requested
books have arrived and are available for use.
These are just a few of the major activities which
Project BALLOTS now performs.
Computer access will, however, allow the user of the
Meyer Library to determine whether the Meyer Library
has the book and whether it is on the shelf. It thus
provides a more up-to-date inventory than found in the
printed catalog which is now cumulated every other year
and provided with quarterly supplements.
There are many others, such as preparing spine labels
which permits books to be identified and shelved
together in the stacks, gathering statistics, and upgrading
or otherwise editing existing bibliographic data. In the
near future the system will provide the capability to post
and update control files applicable to ordered items
(such as change of titles, delay in publication, etc.).
BALLOTS: An advanced, on-line facility
Research and development into computer applica
tions has been under way in North American research
libraries for two decades and especially during the last
seven years. Most of the applications have been to
circulation and technical processes, while nearly all have
relied upon the conventional batch processing com
puting environment. t
The BALLOTS system now becoming operational at
Stanford is substantially different from these earlier
efforts.
Since its inception BALLOTS has been oriented
toward on-line data processing, an approach which is
being found increasingly practical by other library
systems as well. BALLOTS employs technology and
software far more complex than that required for batch
operations. The complexity of on-line operations in
comparison with batch (or "off-line") operations tor the
bibliographic work done at Stanford has been estimated
to range from 10 to 50 times greater.
The development of an on-line system is possible only
in a computer environment characterized by great
intellectual strength and extensive experience. The Stan
ford University Libraries are fortunate to be able to
work in a university environment characterized by this
competence and degree of excellence.
Basically, an on-line system permits a transaction to
be conducted and brought to a relatively immediate
conclusion, whereas a batch system requires all transac
tions to be deferred (i.e., batched) for a processing job in
the computer and its printer.
The Library is a very transaction-oriented system. At
Stanford the total number of transactions of all types is
about 2,000,000 per year, or an average of about 8,000
each day.
When a library transaction is being conducted, the
patron or the staff member usually needs an immediate,
or at least a rapid, response. When a student or faculty
member cannot find a desired book on the shelf, he
wants to know now whether it is charged to some other
user-not tomorrow or next week.
When an acquisition librarian receives a book pur
chase request, he has to know at once whether the book
has already been ordered—not a week or a day later.
Thus, the library operation is typically an on-line
manual system. The availability of on-line expertise at
Stanford plus the possibility of obtaining external giant
monies to fund development work combined to in
fluence the direction of the development effort toward
an advanced, on-line facility. (See accompanying story
on The people-andprograms-behind BALLOTS.)
What BALLOTS will do for the library staff and users
One way to envision what BALLOTS will do is to
look at some of the limitations of current manual
systems. Take book circulation, for instance.
At present, Stanford library users must write their
names, addresses, and all the book information onto a
card for each book they desire to charge out. The charge
card is in two parts—one goes with the book and the
other is filed by call number so the location ol each
book can be known.
This system obviously has two inconveniences: one
for the patron and one for the library staff. Much of the
patron's time is consumed writing repetitive information
which could easily be recorded by data collection
devices and machine-readable identification cards, one
for the book and one for the patron.
Much staff time is consumed arranging and filing
charge cards and the work is subject to human error.
Furthermore, in the manual system, in order to find out
which books are overdue, one must run through the
whole file even including cards for books which are not
overdue.
Book purchasing is another area of potential change
through automation. When a book is recommended for
purchase, very often the exact title is not known, the
author's name may be incomplete or misspelled, or
authorship may even be attributed to the wrong organi
zation or person.
The control file for books on order contains a few
tens of thousands of copies of purchase orders; these
copies are on 3"x5" slips, which makes them difficult to
search and hard to maintain in file.
It is economically prohibitive in a manual system to
maintain outstanding order files in several sequences to
account for variations. Typically, a copy of a purchase
order is filed in only one location in the file; therefore,
the required information on an ordered title can be
found in only one place in the file.
Furthermore, the file itself is available in only one
location a serious geographic limitation to the flow of
bibliographic information in the academic community.
Consider next the problem of searching for a book in
a manual file such as a conventional card catalog.
The typical card catalog is arranged in "dictionary"
form, with authors, titles, subjects, and corporate bodies
all interfiled in one alphabet. Suppose, as is not
unreasonable, that a library user or staff member needs
to search for an item under several different access
points simultaneously. Let us say he wants to find works
on the recycling of solid wastes and the generation of
electric power. Practically speaking, he cannot do this in
the card catalog, because it is basically a single access
file.
Only with very great inconvenience to himself (and
others) and with greatly diminished response time is it
possible for a user to conduct a "coordinated search" in
a manual file. Most users would despair at the thought of
such a laborious and cumbersome task. Yet the com
puter otters the opportunity of conducting such multi
ple access searches easily, conveniently, and quickly
thus enlarging greatly the user's power to retrieve
citations from the file.
Beyond the immediate benefits to the Library staff,
the University intends to make its public bibliographic
files available to the community at the earliest possible
date. The BALLOTS-MARC file, consisting of Library of
Congress MARC records, is now searchable via SHIRES
from any terminal on campus, including typewriter
terminals. The same searching language used by the
library for staff searching is available to the public.
How BALLOTS will look to users
Librarians have labored long under the limitations of
files which have been available in only one place. A
requirement of an automated library system, therefore,
is extension of file access beyond the confines of one
room, one building, or even one campus.
Fortunately, the computer terminal is a device which
readily permits this multiplication of file access. Com
puter video terminals (CRT's) themselves have been
evolving actively only for the past decade. Development
work has been carried out with typewriter terminals, like
the IBM 2741, in order to gain experience, test the
feasibility of multiple access searching software, and, of
course, to write and debug systems and applications
programs.
But it was obvious that the typewriter terminal could
never be satisfactorily used in a production library
environment—it was much too slow and noisy for the
heavy duty use and rapid response the library staff
needed from large bibliographic files, even though its
merit for low volume use was recognized.
The video display terminal or CRT seemed ideal for
the library's purpose, but it was not until last year that
enough choice of reliable terminals was available from
manufacturers so that / terminal could actually be
chosen for BALLOTS.
It was felt that Stanford could not afford a
customized terminal for each possible graphic applica
tion. After an extensive evaluation, the BALLOTS
Project and the Stanford Computation Center selected
,the Sanders 804 programmable terminal. A major
consideration in picking the Sanders unit was that the
unit itself is programmable (contains a minicomputer)
which allows it to meet the requirements of library
automation. Thus it will become one of the Campus
Facility's standard CRT's for video display.
The Sanders 804, pictured in center, shows a
bibliographic record which has been retrieved from the
BALLOTS-MARC file. Note that the record looks
similar to a printed Library of Congress card.

Ihe traditional format was maintained because of its
familiarity to the library staff and public, and to stress
the continuity of bibliographic records, whether manual
or computerized. (Other reformatted versions arc avail
able only to the library staff for editing, input of new
records, or update.)
A simple command language enables anyone, after a
brief instructional session, to enter simple searches for
material in the MARC file. As implementation proceeds,
other files will be accessible to the same kinds of search
commands. Here is an example of what an easy search
might look like:
find author commoner and title circle
After a little experience, the searcher learns to work
with abbreviated commands, and inputs:
fin a commoner and t circle
If Barry Commoner's The Closing Circle is in the
MARC data base, its full bibliographic citation, format
ted like a Library of Congress catalog card, will appear
on the screen of the terminal.
In the event that a searcher obtains only one book
corresponding to his search criteria, the bibliographic
data for that one title is immediately displayed to him.
If more than one book satisfies the search request, the
number of titles found by the computer search is
displayed:
"RESULT: 15 books."
At this point a very significant and advanced feature
of the BALLOTS system can be called into action:
BALLOTS searches arc interactive and negotiable.
The searcher can either expand or contract the search
result, or have each of the citations displayed before him
in turn, one at a time, just as if he were leafing through
cards in a catalog.
Except that he won't be bumping shoulders with
other users, waiting for someone else to finish using a
tray, and more importantly, he will be able to conduct
his search from any unit of the library where a CRT
terminal is located.
BALLOTS impact on the Stanford academic community
The library automation program called BALLOTS is
designed to:

1. Increase the speed of making library materials
available to the public.
The computer will enable the library to acquire,
catalog, and process materials somewhat more rapidly
than is currently the case.
2. Speed and simplify book circulation procedures.
In this area, two major improvements can be
expected.
One is to make available, from any point on campus
where there is a Sanders terminal, information on the
present location of any particular book in the automated
tiles and its present circulation status, when it is due
back, whether it is being held for another borrower, and
whether it can be held for the present inquirer, including
notification of availability.
Another goal is to make circulation as close as
possible to being a self-service process, with the
attendant simplicity and speed that would derive there
from.
3. Enlarge the breadth and depth of access to local
bibliographic records by going beyond the limited access
points provided by manual card catalogs.

Searchers will no longer be confined to exact and full
author, title, or subject entry point-bibliographic
records will be findable from parts of the entries and the
sequence of terms will no longer be so important.
4. Spread access to the bibliographic record through
out the user community by making it available wherever
a terminal is located.
It should be possible from any terminal on campus
for any student, professor, or staff member with a
budget account to find out what is in the automated
library system and what material is on order.
Information should cover Meyer Library as well as all
material newly processed by BALLOTS for the Main
Library system, all major branches which have
catalogued collections, and all of the Coordinate Li
braries that implement the system.
5. Facilitate eventual access to national and regional
data bases.
Toward the end of the 1975-79 period, it is to be
hoped that there will be economical ways of accessing
rather large data bases that are presently being developed
or are proposed for early development.
. This may include in machine-readable form the
800,000 entry catalog of recently acquired books in the
University of California library system, the Library of
Congress' National Union Catalog, the California State
Library Union Catalog, and the New York Times Data
Bank.
6. In conjunction with other systems, such as SPIRES,
begin to provide special bibliographic services to mem
bers of the academic community.
These special services will include the preparation of
"demand bibliographies," and the possible servicing of
data archives, such as opinion polls, U.S. census data,
and the like.
7. Contribute to deescalation of library costs.
This will be accomplished by assigning to the com
puter repetitive tasks, such as sorting, formatting,
printing, arranging, selecting, and otherwise mani
pulating or maintaining a bibliographic record. Slowing
down of library cost rises will lead to operating costs
lower than manual projections by the beginning of the
next decade.
The Library of Congress has begun a new and
significant program for libiary users. Designated CIP (for
Cataloging In Publication), this program makes biblio
graphic data on new books available almost immediately,
often before publication. CIP information is included in
the regular MARC Distribution Service, and is available
on BALLOTS files.
A special computerized searching facility in
BALLOTS-the Standing Search Request-will search all
MARC entries, including CIP information, as tapes come
in from Washington each week. If a specific search has
not made a hit, the Library can request the BALLOTS
system to continue searching the incoming tapes each
week for a pre-set number ol weeks.
Library staff will no longer have to waste time
repeatedly looking for cataloging information, and
bibliographic information and books will be available to
potential library users more rapidly than is possible in
the manual system.

Why libraries need computers
The "information explosion" which universities have
helped create in recent decades has inundated libraries
and research centers with so many new publications that
traditional manual systems are becoming increasingly
unable to handle the load.
Libraries are in large measure still using many of the
basic techniques devised over the last 2,600 years. These
techniques were considered moderately adequate until
the Second World War. But library systems now are
inconvenient of access, slow in response, difficult to use,
frustrating in complexity, and unresponsive to changing
needs.
Problem of huge files
Files have grown so large that they are virtually
becoming unmanageable and many libraries have
seriously considered ceasing to add to their card catalogs
and starting afresh for new acquisitions with some
degree of automation.
* Ohio State University has announced that its card
catalog will be closed and replaced by computer-oriented
bibliographic services in 1976.
* The Library of Congress has predicted that, at the
present rate of growth, by 1980 its own public catalog
will contain some 32,000,000 cards—a tile so vast that
its manageability is questionable.
* Even at Stanford, which is the nation's eighth
largest research library, the various catalogs available to
the public are estimated to contain some ten million
cards.
To create this major bibliographic tool-key to the
millions of bibliographic units at Stanford—requires
many formalized activities and functions which are
routine and which do not require interpretive, scholarly,
or qualitative judgments. Many of these lunctions are
almost ideally suited to machine processing.
More cost, less service
Constantly rising costs are another factor in the
libraries' desire to turn to computers. Labor costs go up
5 to 6 percent each year, whereas the cost of computer
transactions goes up at only half that rate.
It is thus clear that at some point in the future the
University should be paying increasingly less for library
services under a machine system than if it stuck with thu
tried and tested manual process with its ever increasing
complexities and frustrations.
And at the same time a machine system is a more
powerful instrument for giving full, very precise, and
more rapid access to local and national library resources.
Library collections double in size about every 16
years. Even in periods of social unrest or economic
dislocation, the spiral of publishing and communication
activity continues upwards.
Unfortunately, when a library doubles in size, the
effort required to maintain an equivalent level of service
more than doubles-and therein lies the rub.
The large research library at times seems to resemble
a dinosaur or a book museum. In the one instance, it is
slow and ponderous, not terribly adaptive or responsive
to changes in environment. In the other, it grows and
accumulates material relentlessly~yct the adequacy of
its services diminishes as it increases in size because it is
so difficult to access anything within a reasonable time.
Modernization and service improvement needed
The situation may be aggravated by the apparent
increase of interest in interdisciplinary or multidiscipli
nary studies which runs counter to pressures for physical
decentralization of libraries. The scholar in urban prob
lems has to shuttle between the Main Library, the Law
Library, the Jackson Library of Business, and perhaps
the Engineering and Art libraries.
If lie is unable to determine from some central place
(or better yet, from his own office, department, or

book and also whether that book is available for use, he
may give up in all but the most pressing searches.

phone conversations with colleagues, costly and time
consuming conferences, purchase of commercial inform
ation service, or the multiplication of branch libraries.

conclusion, whereas a batch system requires all transac
tions to be deferred (i.e., batched) for a processing job in
the computer and its printer.
The Library is a very transaction-oriented system. At
Stanford the total number of transactions of all types is
about 2,000,000 per year, or an average of about 8,000
each day.
When a library transaction is being conducted, the
patron or the staff member usually needs an immediate,
or at least a rapid, response. When a student or faculty
member cannot find a desired book on the shelf, he
wants to know now whether it is charged to some other
user-not tomorrow or next week.
When an acquisition librarian receives a book pur
chase request, he has to know at once whether the book
has already been ordered—not a week or a day later.
Thus, the library operation is typically an on-line
manual system. The availability of on-line expertise at
Stanford plus the possibility of obtaining external giant
monies to fund development work combined to in
fluence the direction of the development effort toward
an advanced, on-line facility. (See accompanying story
on The people-andprograms-behind BALLOTS.)
What BALLOTS will do for the library staff and users
One way to envision what BALLOTS will do is to
look at some of the limitations of current manual
systems. Take book circulation, for instance.
At present, Stanford library users must write their
names, addresses, and all the book information onto a
card for each book they desire to charge out. The charge
card is in two parts—one goes with the book and the
other is filed by call number so the location ol each
book can be known.
This system obviously has two inconveniences: one
for the patron and one for the library staff. Much of the
patron's time is consumed writing repetitive information
which could easily be recorded by data collection
devices and machine-readable identification cards, one
for the book and one for the patron.
Much staff time is consumed arranging and filing
charge cards and the work is subject to human error.
Furthermore, in the manual system, in order to find out
which books are overdue, one must run through the
whole file even including cards for books which are not
overdue.
Book purchasing is another area of potential change
through automation. When a book is recommended for
purchase, very often the exact title is not known, the
author's name may be incomplete or misspelled, or
authorship may even be attributed to the wrong organi
zation or person.
The control file for books on order contains a few
tens of thousands of copies of purchase orders; these
copies are on 3"x5" slips, which makes them difficult to
search and hard to maintain in file.
It is economically prohibitive in a manual system to
maintain outstanding order files in several sequences to
account for variations. Typically, a copy of a purchase
order is filed in only one location in the file; therefore,
the required information on an ordered title can be
found in only one place in the file.
Furthermore, the file itself is available in only one
location a serious geographic limitation to the flow of
bibliographic information in the academic community.
Consider next the problem of searching for a book in
a manual file such as a conventional card catalog.
The typical card catalog is arranged in "dictionary"
form, with authors, titles, subjects, and corporate bodies
all interfiled in one alphabet. Suppose, as is not
unreasonable, that a library user or staff member needs
to search for an item under several different access
points simultaneously. Let us say he wants to find works
on the recycling of solid wastes and the generation of
electric power. Practically speaking, he cannot do this in
the card catalog, because it is basically a single access
file.
Only with very great inconvenience to himself (and
others) and with greatly diminished response time is it
possible for a user to conduct a "coordinated search" in
a manual file. Most users would despair at the thought of
such a laborious and cumbersome task. Yet the com
puter otters the opportunity of conducting such multi
ple access searches easily, conveniently, and quickly
thus enlarging greatly the user's power to retrieve
citations from the file.
Beyond the immediate benefits to the Library staff,
the University intends to make its public bibliographic
files available to the community at the earliest possible
date. The BALLOTS-MARC file, consisting of Library of
Congress MARC records, is now searchable via SHIRES
from any terminal on campus, including typewriter
terminals. The same searching language used by the
library for staff searching is available to the public.
How BALLOTS will look to users
Librarians have labored long under the limitations of
files which have been available in only one place. A
requirement of an automated library system, therefore,
is extension of file access beyond the confines of one
room, one building, or even one campus.
Fortunately, the computer terminal is a device which
readily permits this multiplication of file access. Com
puter video terminals (CRT's) themselves have been
evolving actively only for the past decade. Development
work has been carried out with typewriter terminals, like
the IBM 2741, in order to gain experience, test the
feasibility of multiple access searching software, and, of
course, to write and debug systems and applications
programs.
But it was obvious that the typewriter terminal could
never be satisfactorily used in a production library
environment—it was much too slow and noisy for the
heavy duty use and rapid response the library staff
needed from large bibliographic files, even though its
merit for low volume use was recognized.
The video display terminal or CRT seemed ideal for
the library's purpose, but it was not until last year that
enough choice of reliable terminals was available from
manufacturers so that / terminal could actually be
chosen for BALLOTS.
It was felt that Stanford could not afford a
customized terminal for each possible graphic applica
tion. After an extensive evaluation, the BALLOTS
Project and the Stanford Computation Center selected
,the Sanders 804 programmable terminal. A major
consideration in picking the Sanders unit was that the
unit itself is programmable (contains a minicomputer)
which allows it to meet the requirements of library
automation. Thus it will become one of the Campus
Facility's standard CRT's for video display.
The Sanders 804, pictured in center, shows a
bibliographic record which has been retrieved from the
BALLOTS-MARC file. Note that the record looks
similar to a printed Library of Congress card.

Ihe traditional format was maintained because of its
familiarity to the library staff and public, and to stress
the continuity of bibliographic records, whether manual
or computerized. (Other reformatted versions arc avail
able only to the library staff for editing, input of new
records, or update.)
A simple command language enables anyone, after a
brief instructional session, to enter simple searches for
material in the MARC file. As implementation proceeds,
other files will be accessible to the same kinds of search
commands. Here is an example of what an easy search
might look like:
find author commoner and title circle
After a little experience, the searcher learns to work
with abbreviated commands, and inputs:
fin a commoner and t circle
If Barry Commoner's The Closing Circle is in the
MARC data base, its full bibliographic citation, format
ted like a Library of Congress catalog card, will appear
on the screen of the terminal.
In the event that a searcher obtains only one book
corresponding to his search criteria, the bibliographic
data for that one title is immediately displayed to him.
If more than one book satisfies the search request, the
number of titles found by the computer search is
displayed:
"RESULT: 15 books."
At this point a very significant and advanced feature
of the BALLOTS system can be called into action:
BALLOTS searches arc interactive and negotiable.
The searcher can either expand or contract the search
result, or have each of the citations displayed before him
in turn, one at a time, just as if he were leafing through
cards in a catalog.
Except that he won't be bumping shoulders with
other users, waiting for someone else to finish using a
tray, and more importantly, he will be able to conduct
his search from any unit of the library where a CRT
terminal is located.
BALLOTS impact on the Stanford academic community
The library automation program called BALLOTS is
designed to:

1. Increase the speed of making library materials
available to the public.
The computer will enable the library to acquire,
catalog, and process materials somewhat more rapidly
than is currently the case.
2. Speed and simplify book circulation procedures.
In this area, two major improvements can be
expected.
One is to make available, from any point on campus
where there is a Sanders terminal, information on the
present location of any particular book in the automated
tiles and its present circulation status, when it is due
back, whether it is being held for another borrower, and
whether it can be held for the present inquirer, including
notification of availability.
Another goal is to make circulation as close as
possible to being a self-service process, with the
attendant simplicity and speed that would derive there
from.
3. Enlarge the breadth and depth of access to local
bibliographic records by going beyond the limited access
points provided by manual card catalogs.

Searchers will no longer be confined to exact and full
author, title, or subject entry point-bibliographic
records will be findable from parts of the entries and the
sequence of terms will no longer be so important.
4. Spread access to the bibliographic record through
out the user community by making it available wherever
a terminal is located.
It should be possible from any terminal on campus
for any student, professor, or staff member with a
budget account to find out what is in the automated
library system and what material is on order.
Information should cover Meyer Library as well as all
material newly processed by BALLOTS for the Main
Library system, all major branches which have
catalogued collections, and all of the Coordinate Li
braries that implement the system.
5. Facilitate eventual access to national and regional
data bases.
Toward the end of the 1975-79 period, it is to be
hoped that there will be economical ways of accessing
rather large data bases that are presently being developed
or are proposed for early development.
. This may include in machine-readable form the
800,000 entry catalog of recently acquired books in the
University of California library system, the Library of
Congress' National Union Catalog, the California State
Library Union Catalog, and the New York Times Data
Bank.
6. In conjunction with other systems, such as SPIRES,
begin to provide special bibliographic services to mem
bers of the academic community.
These special services will include the preparation of
"demand bibliographies," and the possible servicing of
data archives, such as opinion polls, U.S. census data,
and the like.
7. Contribute to deescalation of library costs.
This will be accomplished by assigning to the com
puter repetitive tasks, such as sorting, formatting,
printing, arranging, selecting, and otherwise mani
pulating or maintaining a bibliographic record. Slowing
down of library cost rises will lead to operating costs
lower than manual projections by the beginning of the
next decade.
The Library of Congress has begun a new and
significant program for libiary users. Designated CIP (for
Cataloging In Publication), this program makes biblio
graphic data on new books available almost immediately,
often before publication. CIP information is included in
the regular MARC Distribution Service, and is available
on BALLOTS files.
A special computerized searching facility in
BALLOTS-the Standing Search Request-will search all
MARC entries, including CIP information, as tapes come
in from Washington each week. If a specific search has
not made a hit, the Library can request the BALLOTS
system to continue searching the incoming tapes each
week for a pre-set number ol weeks.
Library staff will no longer have to waste time
repeatedly looking for cataloging information, and
bibliographic information and books will be available to
potential library users more rapidly than is possible in
the manual system.

BALLOTS by David C. Weber and Allen B. Veaner of
the University Libraries staff.
Why libraries need computers
The "information explosion" which universities have
helped create in recent decades has inundated libraries
and research centers with so many new publications that
traditional manual systems are becoming increasingly
unable to handle the load.
Libraries are in large measure still using many of the
basic techniques devised over the last 2,600 years. These
techniques were considered moderately adequate until
the Second World War. But library systems now are
inconvenient of access, slow in response, difficult to use,
frustrating in complexity, and unresponsive to changing
needs.
Problem of huge files
Files have grown so large that they are virtually
becoming unmanageable and many libraries have
seriously considered ceasing to add to their card catalogs
and starting afresh for new acquisitions with some
degree of automation.
* Ohio State University has announced that its card
catalog will be closed and replaced by computer-oriented
bibliographic services in 1976.
* The Library of Congress has predicted that, at the
present rate of growth, by 1980 its own public catalog
will contain some 32,000,000 cards—a tile so vast that
its manageability is questionable.
* Even at Stanford, which is the nation's eighth
largest research library, the various catalogs available to
the public are estimated to contain some ten million
cards.
To create this major bibliographic tool-key to the
millions of bibliographic units at Stanford—requires
many formalized activities and functions which are
routine and which do not require interpretive, scholarly,
or qualitative judgments. Many of these lunctions are
almost ideally suited to machine processing.
More cost, less service
Constantly rising costs are another factor in the
libraries' desire to turn to computers. Labor costs go up
5 to 6 percent each year, whereas the cost of computer
transactions goes up at only half that rate.
It is thus clear that at some point in the future the
University should be paying increasingly less for library
services under a machine system than if it stuck with thu
tried and tested manual process with its ever increasing
complexities and frustrations.
And at the same time a machine system is a more
powerful instrument for giving full, very precise, and
more rapid access to local and national library resources.
Library collections double in size about every 16
years. Even in periods of social unrest or economic
dislocation, the spiral of publishing and communication
activity continues upwards.
Unfortunately, when a library doubles in size, the
effort required to maintain an equivalent level of service
more than doubles-and therein lies the rub.
The large research library at times seems to resemble
a dinosaur or a book museum. In the one instance, it is
slow and ponderous, not terribly adaptive or responsive
to changes in environment. In the other, it grows and
accumulates material relentlessly~yct the adequacy of
its services diminishes as it increases in size because it is
so difficult to access anything within a reasonable time.
Modernization and service improvement needed
The situation may be aggravated by the apparent
increase of interest in interdisciplinary or multidiscipli
nary studies which runs counter to pressures for physical
decentralization of libraries. The scholar in urban prob
lems has to shuttle between the Main Library, the Law
Library, the Jackson Library of Business, and perhaps
the Engineering and Art libraries.
If lie is unable to determine from some central place
(or better yet, from his own office, department, or
laboratory) whether one library or another possesses a
book and also whether that book is available for use, he
may give up in all but the most pressing searches.
In frustration, potential library users may turn to
other services or devices for their information needs—
perhaps building a personal library, long distance tele
phone conversations with colleagues, costly and time
consuming conferences, purchase of commercial inform
ation service, or the multiplication of branch libraries.
Students, and particularly graduate students, research
staff and faculty are now increasingly critical of the
ability of libraries to respond to current needs. Yet the
library is still a major and essential component in a huge
network of information processing; it too must be
brought into the 20th century.
Efforts to make this change at Stanford began more
than six years ago in the Stanford library automation
project. Involving 100 people and nearly $2 million to
date, it is called Project BALLOTS-for Bibliographic
Automation of Large Library Operations using a Time
sharing System. One ot the most advanced library
automation projects in the country, it still will require
several more years to complete. (See table.)
What BALLOTS can do for you
Computer terminals will aid you in 1973 and later
years to borrow books, search for publications you need,
determine what the library has on a subject for your
interest, and determine if a bibliographic citation that
interests you is now in the Stanford Library and if so,
where it is and whether it is in use.
This effort is the result of computer programs written
to operate television-like terminals that arc now in the
Main Library and will be added in Meyer and other
major library branches in the course of the next two to
four years. (Any typewriter terminal on campus can
already search the BALLOTS-MARC file, which consists
of current Library of Congress catalog data.)
The library staff will be able to help you with your
searches during 1973-4; it is expected that public use of
the TV-like terminals may start as early as 1974.

How BALLOTS works
Using terminals with cathode ray tubes, popularly
called "CRT's," library staff now conducts searches of
bibliographic files, enters commands and tells the com
puter to format data for purchase orders, sort the orders
alphabetically by vendor, and print them overnight.
The computer will also print messages notifying
faculty or student requesters that their materials have
arrived. Search commands will find Library of Congress
bibliographic data if available, and if not available, will
eventually enable the staff to create their own data on
the spot.
Similarly, commands entered at the terminal will
instruct the computer to properly format desired biblio
graphic data, sort it in batches for the main and
departmental libraries, and within each batch, print out
the complete set of library cards already sorted in
correct alphabetical filing sequence.
The magnitude of this operation is appreciated when
it is realized that the typical large research library
prepares between half a million and a million cards each
year—a job which in the manual system is not very
interesting and is susceptible to error.
In circulation, data collection devices and machine
readable identification cards will speed circulation tran
sactions and virtually eliminate the nuisance of filling
out charge cards by hand.
In summary the system will aid processing of roman
alphabet material acquired, and items the catalog listing
of which can be transliterated. There will be a consider
able time period before a sufficiently large fraction of
the library's holdings is contained in machine-readable
fdes to make automatic search rewarding to the general
user.
This time varies depending upon discipline. In the
sciences, it might be as short as two to five years. In the
humanities perhaps as much as 30 to 50 years, or until
such time as technological breakthroughs provide in
expensive, reliable conversion to machine-readable form
of massive bibliographic files-a prospect which docs not
seem imminent at this writing.
Unfortunately, a majority of the use of the library by
scientists involves the search for journal articles and
these will not be included in the initial implementation
of the system because of the expense of buying and
processing machine-readable data bases.
Typically, lists in machine-readable form for journal
citations covering a broad subject cost from
$10,000-25,000 each year, more than that to store
locally, and still more to convert them to internal

machine formats like SPIRES so that they can be run
against search programs. (SPIRES—the Stanford Public
Information REtrieval System-is a computer-based,
generalized information system. See Campus Report
Oct. 11, 1972 p. 1-2.)
Thus from the point of view of general patron search
of the library catalog, we must consider that BALLOTS
piovides a benefit of increasing utility over a period of
years.
The Meyer Library represents an exception in that all
its holdings (except journalarticles) will included in
the on-line catalog. The Meyer catalog is now printed,
bound, and distributed in book form to several locations
on campus.
Computer applications in bibliographic data
In 1965, the Library of Congress started a develop
ment program to apply computer technology to the
creation and distribution of its large pool of biblio
graphic data.
Known as the MARC Project (Machine Readable
Cataloging), this effort eventually resulted in establish
ment of a national and international standard for
creating magnetic tapes containing all the information
normally found on printed Library of Congress cards
cards which form the backbone of the cataloging system
in nearly every major research library in North America.
For several years now the Library of Congress has
been distributing weekly magnetic tapes containing
machine readable bibliographic records for currently
catalogued books. The service began with English lan
guage books and late in the current fiscal year will be
extended to French titles, to be followed by titles in
other romance languages and in German.
The MARC tapes form one of the foundations of the
BALLOTS system. But BALLOTS also will permit
libraries at Stanford to create their own bibliographic
records for items not yet represented in the MARC
service. Machine readable bibliographic records from
MARC now make it possible for staff of the Stanford
Libraries to:
1. Search the files for information on a book,
whether the information is known precisely or
imprecisely.
2. Create purchase orders for books without the
requirement to retype the data.
3. Have the computer print catalog cards without the
requirement for any further typing or
proofreading.

(This space paid for by News and Publications)
4. Sort the cards by computer (before they are*
printed), resulting in the saving of the human labor
which would otherwise be necessary to sort the
close to one million cards prepared each year at
Stanford.
5. Notify interested library patrons that requested
books have arrived and are available for use.
These are just a few of the major activities which
Project BALLOTS now performs.
Computer access will, however, allow the user of the
Meyer Library to determine whether the Meyer Library
has the book and whether it is on the shelf. It thus
provides a more up-to-date inventory than found in the
printed catalog which is now cumulated every other year
and provided with quarterly supplements.
There are many others, such as preparing spine labels
which permits books to be identified and shelved
together in the stacks, gathering statistics, and upgrading
or otherwise editing existing bibliographic data. In the
near future the system will provide the capability to post
and update control files applicable to ordered items
(such as change of titles, delay in publication, etc.).
BALLOTS: An advanced, on-line facility
Research and development into computer applica
tions has been under way in North American research
libraries for two decades and especially during the last
seven years. Most of the applications have been to
circulation and technical processes, while nearly all have
relied upon the conventional batch processing com
puting environment. t
The BALLOTS system now becoming operational at
Stanford is substantially different from these earlier
efforts.
Since its inception BALLOTS has been oriented
toward on-line data processing, an approach which is
being found increasingly practical by other library
systems as well. BALLOTS employs technology and
software far more complex than that required for batch
operations. The complexity of on-line operations in
comparison with batch (or "off-line") operations tor the
bibliographic work done at Stanford has been estimated
to range from 10 to 50 times greater.
The development of an on-line system is possible only
in a computer environment characterized by great
intellectual strength and extensive experience. The Stan
ford University Libraries are fortunate to be able to
work in a university environment characterized by this
competence and degree of excellence.
Basically, an on-line system permits a transaction to
be conducted and brought to a relatively immediate
conclusion, whereas a batch system requires all transac
tions to be deferred (i.e., batched) for a processing job in
the computer and its printer.
The Library is a very transaction-oriented system. At
Stanford the total number of transactions of all types is
about 2,000,000 per year, or an average of about 8,000
each day.

or at least a rapid, response. When a student or faculty

When an acquisition librarian receives a book pur
chase request, he has to know at once whether the book
has already been ordered—not a week or a day later.
Thus, the library operation is typically an on-line
manual system. The availability of on-line expertise at
Stanford plus the possibility of obtaining external giant

an advanced, on-line facility. (See accompanying story

Why libraries need computers
The "information explosion" which universities have
helped create in recent decades has inundated libraries
and research centers with so many new publications that
traditional manual systems are becoming increasingly
unable to handle the load.
Libraries are in large measure still using many of the
basic techniques devised over the last 2,600 years. These
techniques were considered moderately adequate until
the Second World War. But library systems now are
inconvenient of access, slow in response, difficult to use,
frustrating in complexity, and unresponsive to changing
needs.
Problem of huge files
Files have grown so large that they are virtually
becoming unmanageable and many libraries have
seriously considered ceasing to add to their card catalogs
and starting afresh for new acquisitions with some
degree of automation.
* Ohio State University has announced that its card
catalog will be closed and replaced by computer-oriented
bibliographic services in 1976.
* The Library of Congress has predicted that, at the
present rate of growth, by 1980 its own public catalog
will contain some 32,000,000 cards—a tile so vast that
its manageability is questionable.
* Even at Stanford, which is the nation's eighth
largest research library, the various catalogs available to
the public are estimated to contain some ten million
cards.
To create this major bibliographic tool-key to the
millions of bibliographic units at Stanford—requires
many formalized activities and functions which are
routine and which do not require interpretive, scholarly,
or qualitative judgments. Many of these lunctions are
almost ideally suited to machine processing.
More cost, less service
Constantly rising costs are another factor in the
libraries' desire to turn to computers. Labor costs go up
5 to 6 percent each year, whereas the cost of computer
transactions goes up at only half that rate.
It is thus clear that at some point in the future the
University should be paying increasingly less for library
services under a machine system than if it stuck with thu
tried and tested manual process with its ever increasing
complexities and frustrations.
And at the same time a machine system is a more
powerful instrument for giving full, very precise, and
more rapid access to local and national library resources.
Library collections double in size about every 16
years. Even in periods of social unrest or economic
dislocation, the spiral of publishing and communication
activity continues upwards.
Unfortunately, when a library doubles in size, the
effort required to maintain an equivalent level of service
more than doubles-and therein lies the rub.
The large research library at times seems to resemble
a dinosaur or a book museum. In the one instance, it is
slow and ponderous, not terribly adaptive or responsive
to changes in environment. In the other, it grows and
accumulates material relentlessly~yct the adequacy of
its services diminishes as it increases in size because it is
so difficult to access anything within a reasonable time.
Modernization and service improvement needed
The situation may be aggravated by the apparent
increase of interest in interdisciplinary or multidiscipli
nary studies which runs counter to pressures for physical
decentralization of libraries. The scholar in urban prob
lems has to shuttle between the Main Library, the Law
Library, the Jackson Library of Business, and perhaps
the Engineering and Art libraries.
If lie is unable to determine from some central place
(or better yet, from his own office, department, or
laboratory) whether one library or another possesses a
book and also whether that book is available for use, he
may give up in all but the most pressing searches.
In frustration, potential library users may turn to
other services or devices for their information needs—
perhaps building a personal library, long distance tele
phone conversations with colleagues, costly and time
consuming conferences, purchase of commercial inform
ation service, or the multiplication of branch libraries.
Students, and particularly graduate students, research
staff and faculty are now increasingly critical of the
ability of libraries to respond to current needs. Yet the
library is still a major and essential component in a huge
network of information processing; it too must be
brought into the 20th century.
Efforts to make this change at Stanford began more
than six years ago in the Stanford library automation
project. Involving 100 people and nearly $2 million to
date, it is called Project BALLOTS-for Bibliographic
Automation of Large Library Operations using a Time
sharing System. One ot the most advanced library
automation projects in the country, it still will require
several more years to complete. (See table.)
What BALLOTS can do for you
Computer terminals will aid you in 1973 and later
years to borrow books, search for publications you need,
determine what the library has on a subject for your
interest, and determine if a bibliographic citation that
interests you is now in the Stanford Library and if so,
where it is and whether it is in use.
This effort is the result of computer programs written
to operate television-like terminals that arc now in the
Main Library and will be added in Meyer and other
major library branches in the course of the next two to
four years. (Any typewriter terminal on campus can
already search the BALLOTS-MARC file, which consists
of current Library of Congress catalog data.)
The library staff will be able to help you with your
searches during 1973-4; it is expected that public use of
the TV-like terminals may start as early as 1974.

How BALLOTS works
Using terminals with cathode ray tubes, popularly
called "CRT's," library staff now conducts searches of
bibliographic files, enters commands and tells the com
puter to format data for purchase orders, sort the orders
alphabetically by vendor, and print them overnight.
The computer will also print messages notifying
faculty or student requesters that their materials have
arrived. Search commands will find Library of Congress
bibliographic data if available, and if not available, will
eventually enable the staff to create their own data on
the spot.
Similarly, commands entered at the terminal will
instruct the computer to properly format desired biblio
graphic data, sort it in batches for the main and
departmental libraries, and within each batch, print out
the complete set of library cards already sorted in
correct alphabetical filing sequence.
The magnitude of this operation is appreciated when
it is realized that the typical large research library
prepares between half a million and a million cards each
year—a job which in the manual system is not very
interesting and is susceptible to error.
In circulation, data collection devices and machine
readable identification cards will speed circulation tran
sactions and virtually eliminate the nuisance of filling
out charge cards by hand.
In summary the system will aid processing of roman
alphabet material acquired, and items the catalog listing
of which can be transliterated. There will be a consider
able time period before a sufficiently large fraction of
the library's holdings is contained in machine-readable
fdes to make automatic search rewarding to the general
user.
This time varies depending upon discipline. In the
sciences, it might be as short as two to five years. In the
humanities perhaps as much as 30 to 50 years, or until
such time as technological breakthroughs provide in
expensive, reliable conversion to machine-readable form
of massive bibliographic files-a prospect which docs not
seem imminent at this writing.
Unfortunately, a majority of the use of the library by
scientists involves the search for journal articles and
these will not be included in the initial implementation
of the system because of the expense of buying and
processing machine-readable data bases.
Typically, lists in machine-readable form for journal
citations covering a broad subject cost from
$10,000-25,000 each year, more than that to store
locally, and still more to convert them to internal

machine formats like SPIRES so that they can be run
against search programs. (SPIRES—the Stanford Public
Information REtrieval System-is a computer-based,
generalized information system. See Campus Report
Oct. 11, 1972 p. 1-2.)
Thus from the point of view of general patron search
of the library catalog, we must consider that BALLOTS
piovides a benefit of increasing utility over a period of
years.
The Meyer Library represents an exception in that all
its holdings (except journalarticles) will included in
the on-line catalog. The Meyer catalog is now printed,
bound, and distributed in book form to several locations
on campus.
Computer applications in bibliographic data
In 1965, the Library of Congress started a develop
ment program to apply computer technology to the
creation and distribution of its large pool of biblio
graphic data.
Known as the MARC Project (Machine Readable
Cataloging), this effort eventually resulted in establish
ment of a national and international standard for
creating magnetic tapes containing all the information
normally found on printed Library of Congress cards
cards which form the backbone of the cataloging system
in nearly every major research library in North America.
For several years now the Library of Congress has
been distributing weekly magnetic tapes containing
machine readable bibliographic records for currently
catalogued books. The service began with English lan
guage books and late in the current fiscal year will be
extended to French titles, to be followed by titles in
other romance languages and in German.
The MARC tapes form one of the foundations of the
BALLOTS system. But BALLOTS also will permit
libraries at Stanford to create their own bibliographic
records for items not yet represented in the MARC
service. Machine readable bibliographic records from
MARC now make it possible for staff of the Stanford
Libraries to:
1. Search the files for information on a book,
whether the information is known precisely or
imprecisely.
2. Create purchase orders for books without the
requirement to retype the data.
3. Have the computer print catalog cards without the
requirement for any further typing or
proofreading.

(This space paid for by News and Publications)
4. Sort the cards by computer (before they are*
printed), resulting in the saving of the human labor
which would otherwise be necessary to sort the
close to one million cards prepared each year at
Stanford.
5. Notify interested library patrons that requested
books have arrived and are available for use.
These are just a few of the major activities which
Project BALLOTS now performs.
Computer access will, however, allow the user of the
Meyer Library to determine whether the Meyer Library
has the book and whether it is on the shelf. It thus
provides a more up-to-date inventory than found in the
printed catalog which is now cumulated every other year
and provided with quarterly supplements.
There are many others, such as preparing spine labels
which permits books to be identified and shelved
together in the stacks, gathering statistics, and upgrading
or otherwise editing existing bibliographic data. In the
near future the system will provide the capability to post
and update control files applicable to ordered items
(such as change of titles, delay in publication, etc.).
BALLOTS: An advanced, on-line facility
Research and development into computer applica
tions has been under way in North American research
libraries for two decades and especially during the last
seven years. Most of the applications have been to
circulation and technical processes, while nearly all have
relied upon the conventional batch processing com
puting environment. t
The BALLOTS system now becoming operational at
Stanford is substantially different from these earlier
efforts.
Since its inception BALLOTS has been oriented
toward on-line data processing, an approach which is
being found increasingly practical by other library
systems as well. BALLOTS employs technology and
software far more complex than that required for batch
operations. The complexity of on-line operations in
comparison with batch (or "off-line") operations tor the
bibliographic work done at Stanford has been estimated
to range from 10 to 50 times greater.
The development of an on-line system is possible only
in a computer environment characterized by great
intellectual strength and extensive experience. The Stan
ford University Libraries are fortunate to be able to
work in a university environment characterized by this
competence and degree of excellence.
Basically, an on-line system permits a transaction to
be conducted and brought to a relatively immediate
conclusion, whereas a batch system requires all transac
tions to be deferred (i.e., batched) for a processing job in
the computer and its printer.
The Library is a very transaction-oriented system. At
Stanford the total number of transactions of all types is
about 2,000,000 per year, or an average of about 8,000
each day.
When a library transaction is being conducted, the
patron or the staff member usually needs an immediate,
or at least a rapid, response. When a student or faculty
member cannot find a desired book on the shelf, he
wants to know now whether it is charged to some other
user-not tomorrow or next week.
When an acquisition librarian receives a book pur
chase request, he has to know at once whether the book
has already been ordered—not a week or a day later.
Thus, the library operation is typically an on-line
manual system. The availability of on-line expertise at
Stanford plus the possibility of obtaining external giant
monies to fund development work combined to in
fluence the direction of the development effort toward
an advanced, on-line facility. (See accompanying story
on The people-andprograms-behind BALLOTS.)
What BALLOTS will do for the library staff and users
One way to envision what BALLOTS will do is to
look at some of the limitations of current manual
systems. Take book circulation, for instance.
At present, Stanford library users must write their
names, addresses, and all the book information onto a
card for each book they desire to charge out. The charge
card is in two parts—one goes with the book and the
other is filed by call number so the location ol each
book can be known.
This system obviously has two inconveniences: one
for the patron and one for the library staff. Much of the
patron's time is consumed writing repetitive information
which could easily be recorded by data collection
devices and machine-readable identification cards, one
for the book and one for the patron.
Much staff time is consumed arranging and filing
charge cards and the work is subject to human error.
Furthermore, in the manual system, in order to find out
which books are overdue, one must run through the
whole file even including cards for books which are not
overdue.
Book purchasing is another area of potential change
through automation. When a book is recommended for
purchase, very often the exact title is not known, the
author's name may be incomplete or misspelled, or
authorship may even be attributed to the wrong organi
zation or person.
The control file for books on order contains a few
tens of thousands of copies of purchase orders; these
copies are on 3"x5" slips, which makes them difficult to
search and hard to maintain in file.
It is economically prohibitive in a manual system to
maintain outstanding order files in several sequences to
account for variations. Typically, a copy of a purchase
order is filed in only one location in the file; therefore,
the required information on an ordered title can be
found in only one place in the file.
Furthermore, the file itself is available in only one
location a serious geographic limitation to the flow of
bibliographic information in the academic community.
Consider next the problem of searching for a book in
a manual file such as a conventional card catalog.
The typical card catalog is arranged in "dictionary"
form, with authors, titles, subjects, and corporate bodies
all interfiled in one alphabet. Suppose, as is not
unreasonable, that a library user or staff member needs
to search for an item under several different access
points simultaneously. Let us say he wants to find works
on the recycling of solid wastes and the generation of
electric power. Practically speaking, he cannot do this in
the card catalog, because it is basically a single access
file.
Only with very great inconvenience to himself (and
others) and with greatly diminished response time is it
possible for a user to conduct a "coordinated search" in
a manual file. Most users would despair at the thought of
such a laborious and cumbersome task. Yet the com
puter otters the opportunity of conducting such multi
ple access searches easily, conveniently, and quickly
thus enlarging greatly the user's power to retrieve
citations from the file.
Beyond the immediate benefits to the Library staff,
the University intends to make its public bibliographic
files available to the community at the earliest possible
date. The BALLOTS-MARC file, consisting of Library of
Congress MARC records, is now searchable via SHIRES
from any terminal on campus, including typewriter
terminals. The same searching language used by the
library for staff searching is available to the public.
How BALLOTS will look to users
Librarians have labored long under the limitations of
files which have been available in only one place. A
requirement of an automated library system, therefore,
is extension of file access beyond the confines of one
room, one building, or even one campus.
Fortunately, the computer terminal is a device which
readily permits this multiplication of file access. Com
puter video terminals (CRT's) themselves have been
evolving actively only for the past decade. Development
work has been carried out with typewriter terminals, like
the IBM 2741, in order to gain experience, test the
feasibility of multiple access searching software, and, of
course, to write and debug systems and applications
programs.
But it was obvious that the typewriter terminal could
never be satisfactorily used in a production library
environment—it was much too slow and noisy for the
heavy duty use and rapid response the library staff
needed from large bibliographic files, even though its
merit for low volume use was recognized.
The video display terminal or CRT seemed ideal for
the library's purpose, but it was not until last year that
enough choice of reliable terminals was available from
manufacturers so that / terminal could actually be
chosen for BALLOTS.
It was felt that Stanford could not afford a
customized terminal for each possible graphic applica
tion. After an extensive evaluation, the BALLOTS
Project and the Stanford Computation Center selected
,the Sanders 804 programmable terminal. A major
consideration in picking the Sanders unit was that the
unit itself is programmable (contains a minicomputer)
which allows it to meet the requirements of library
automation. Thus it will become one of the Campus
Facility's standard CRT's for video display.
The Sanders 804, pictured in center, shows a
bibliographic record which has been retrieved from the
BALLOTS-MARC file. Note that the record looks
similar to a printed Library of Congress card.

Ihe traditional format was maintained because of its
familiarity to the library staff and public, and to stress
the continuity of bibliographic records, whether manual
or computerized. (Other reformatted versions arc avail
able only to the library staff for editing, input of new
records, or update.)
A simple command language enables anyone, after a
brief instructional session, to enter simple searches for
material in the MARC file. As implementation proceeds,
other files will be accessible to the same kinds of search
commands. Here is an example of what an easy search
might look like:
find author commoner and title circle
After a little experience, the searcher learns to work
with abbreviated commands, and inputs:
fin a commoner and t circle
If Barry Commoner's The Closing Circle is in the
MARC data base, its full bibliographic citation, format
ted like a Library of Congress catalog card, will appear
on the screen of the terminal.
In the event that a searcher obtains only one book
corresponding to his search criteria, the bibliographic
data for that one title is immediately displayed to him.
If more than one book satisfies the search request, the
number of titles found by the computer search is
displayed:
"RESULT: 15 books."
At this point a very significant and advanced feature
of the BALLOTS system can be called into action:
BALLOTS searches arc interactive and negotiable.
The searcher can either expand or contract the search
result, or have each of the citations displayed before him
in turn, one at a time, just as if he were leafing through
cards in a catalog.
Except that he won't be bumping shoulders with
other users, waiting for someone else to finish using a
tray, and more importantly, he will be able to conduct
his search from any unit of the library where a CRT
terminal is located.
BALLOTS impact on the Stanford academic community
The library automation program called BALLOTS is
designed to:

1. Increase the speed of making library materials
available to the public.
The computer will enable the library to acquire,
catalog, and process materials somewhat more rapidly
than is currently the case.
2. Speed and simplify book circulation procedures.
In this area, two major improvements can be
expected.
One is to make available, from any point on campus
where there is a Sanders terminal, information on the
present location of any particular book in the automated
tiles and its present circulation status, when it is due
back, whether it is being held for another borrower, and
whether it can be held for the present inquirer, including
notification of availability.
Another goal is to make circulation as close as
possible to being a self-service process, with the
attendant simplicity and speed that would derive there
from.
3. Enlarge the breadth and depth of access to local
bibliographic records by going beyond the limited access
points provided by manual card catalogs.

Searchers will no longer be confined to exact and full
author, title, or subject entry point-bibliographic
records will be findable from parts of the entries and the
sequence of terms will no longer be so important.

Library system, all major branches which have
catalogued collections, and all of the Coordinate Li
braries that implement the system.

hoped that there will be economical ways of accessing

or are proposed for early development.

graphic data, sort it in batches for the main and
departmental libraries, and within each batch, print out
the complete set of library cards already sorted in
correct alphabetical filing sequence.
The magnitude of this operation is appreciated when
it is realized that the typical large research library
prepares between half a million and a million cards each
year—a job which in the manual system is not very
interesting and is susceptible to error.
In circulation, data collection devices and machine
readable identification cards will speed circulation tran
sactions and virtually eliminate the nuisance of filling
out charge cards by hand.
In summary the system will aid processing of roman
alphabet material acquired, and items the catalog listing
of which can be transliterated. There will be a consider
able time period before a sufficiently large fraction of
the library's holdings is contained in machine-readable
fdes to make automatic search rewarding to the general
user.
This time varies depending upon discipline. In the
sciences, it might be as short as two to five years. In the
humanities perhaps as much as 30 to 50 years, or until
such time as technological breakthroughs provide in
expensive, reliable conversion to machine-readable form
of massive bibliographic files-a prospect which docs not
seem imminent at this writing.
Unfortunately, a majority of the use of the library by
scientists involves the search for journal articles and
these will not be included in the initial implementation
of the system because of the expense of buying and
processing machine-readable data bases.
Typically, lists in machine-readable form for journal
citations covering a broad subject cost from
$10,000-25,000 each year, more than that to store
locally, and still more to convert them to internal

machine formats like SPIRES so that they can be run
against search programs. (SPIRES—the Stanford Public
Information REtrieval System-is a computer-based,
generalized information system. See Campus Report
Oct. 11, 1972 p. 1-2.)
Thus from the point of view of general patron search
of the library catalog, we must consider that BALLOTS
piovides a benefit of increasing utility over a period of
years.
The Meyer Library represents an exception in that all
its holdings (except journalarticles) will included in
the on-line catalog. The Meyer catalog is now printed,
bound, and distributed in book form to several locations
on campus.
Computer applications in bibliographic data
In 1965, the Library of Congress started a develop
ment program to apply computer technology to the
creation and distribution of its large pool of biblio
graphic data.
Known as the MARC Project (Machine Readable
Cataloging), this effort eventually resulted in establish
ment of a national and international standard for
creating magnetic tapes containing all the information
normally found on printed Library of Congress cards
cards which form the backbone of the cataloging system
in nearly every major research library in North America.
For several years now the Library of Congress has
been distributing weekly magnetic tapes containing
machine readable bibliographic records for currently
catalogued books. The service began with English lan
guage books and late in the current fiscal year will be
extended to French titles, to be followed by titles in
other romance languages and in German.
The MARC tapes form one of the foundations of the
BALLOTS system. But BALLOTS also will permit
libraries at Stanford to create their own bibliographic
records for items not yet represented in the MARC
service. Machine readable bibliographic records from
MARC now make it possible for staff of the Stanford
Libraries to:
1. Search the files for information on a book,
whether the information is known precisely or
imprecisely.
2. Create purchase orders for books without the
requirement to retype the data.
3. Have the computer print catalog cards without the
requirement for any further typing or
proofreading.

(This space paid for by News and Publications)
4. Sort the cards by computer (before they are*
printed), resulting in the saving of the human labor
which would otherwise be necessary to sort the
close to one million cards prepared each year at
Stanford.
5. Notify interested library patrons that requested
books have arrived and are available for use.
These are just a few of the major activities which
Project BALLOTS now performs.
Computer access will, however, allow the user of the
Meyer Library to determine whether the Meyer Library
has the book and whether it is on the shelf. It thus
provides a more up-to-date inventory than found in the
printed catalog which is now cumulated every other year
and provided with quarterly supplements.
There are many others, such as preparing spine labels
which permits books to be identified and shelved
together in the stacks, gathering statistics, and upgrading
or otherwise editing existing bibliographic data. In the
near future the system will provide the capability to post
and update control files applicable to ordered items
(such as change of titles, delay in publication, etc.).
BALLOTS: An advanced, on-line facility
Research and development into computer applica
tions has been under way in North American research
libraries for two decades and especially during the last
seven years. Most of the applications have been to
circulation and technical processes, while nearly all have
relied upon the conventional batch processing com
puting environment. t
The BALLOTS system now becoming operational at
Stanford is substantially different from these earlier
efforts.
Since its inception BALLOTS has been oriented
toward on-line data processing, an approach which is
being found increasingly practical by other library
systems as well. BALLOTS employs technology and
software far more complex than that required for batch
operations. The complexity of on-line operations in
comparison with batch (or "off-line") operations tor the
bibliographic work done at Stanford has been estimated
to range from 10 to 50 times greater.
The development of an on-line system is possible only
in a computer environment characterized by great
intellectual strength and extensive experience. The Stan
ford University Libraries are fortunate to be able to
work in a university environment characterized by this
competence and degree of excellence.
Basically, an on-line system permits a transaction to
be conducted and brought to a relatively immediate
conclusion, whereas a batch system requires all transac
tions to be deferred (i.e., batched) for a processing job in
the computer and its printer.
The Library is a very transaction-oriented system. At
Stanford the total number of transactions of all types is
about 2,000,000 per year, or an average of about 8,000
each day.
When a library transaction is being conducted, the
patron or the staff member usually needs an immediate,
or at least a rapid, response. When a student or faculty
member cannot find a desired book on the shelf, he
wants to know now whether it is charged to some other
user-not tomorrow or next week.
When an acquisition librarian receives a book pur
chase request, he has to know at once whether the book
has already been ordered—not a week or a day later.
Thus, the library operation is typically an on-line
manual system. The availability of on-line expertise at
Stanford plus the possibility of obtaining external giant
monies to fund development work combined to in
fluence the direction of the development effort toward
an advanced, on-line facility. (See accompanying story
on The people-andprograms-behind BALLOTS.)
What BALLOTS will do for the library staff and users
One way to envision what BALLOTS will do is to
look at some of the limitations of current manual
systems. Take book circulation, for instance.
At present, Stanford library users must write their
names, addresses, and all the book information onto a
card for each book they desire to charge out. The charge
card is in two parts—one goes with the book and the
other is filed by call number so the location ol each
book can be known.
This system obviously has two inconveniences: one
for the patron and one for the library staff. Much of the
patron's time is consumed writing repetitive information
which could easily be recorded by data collection
devices and machine-readable identification cards, one
for the book and one for the patron.
Much staff time is consumed arranging and filing
charge cards and the work is subject to human error.
Furthermore, in the manual system, in order to find out
which books are overdue, one must run through the
whole file even including cards for books which are not
overdue.
Book purchasing is another area of potential change
through automation. When a book is recommended for
purchase, very often the exact title is not known, the
author's name may be incomplete or misspelled, or
authorship may even be attributed to the wrong organi
zation or person.
The control file for books on order contains a few
tens of thousands of copies of purchase orders; these
copies are on 3"x5" slips, which makes them difficult to
search and hard to maintain in file.
It is economically prohibitive in a manual system to
maintain outstanding order files in several sequences to
account for variations. Typically, a copy of a purchase
order is filed in only one location in the file; therefore,
the required information on an ordered title can be
found in only one place in the file.
Furthermore, the file itself is available in only one
location a serious geographic limitation to the flow of
bibliographic information in the academic community.
Consider next the problem of searching for a book in
a manual file such as a conventional card catalog.
The typical card catalog is arranged in "dictionary"
form, with authors, titles, subjects, and corporate bodies
all interfiled in one alphabet. Suppose, as is not
unreasonable, that a library user or staff member needs
to search for an item under several different access
points simultaneously. Let us say he wants to find works
on the recycling of solid wastes and the generation of
electric power. Practically speaking, he cannot do this in
the card catalog, because it is basically a single access
file.
Only with very great inconvenience to himself (and
others) and with greatly diminished response time is it
possible for a user to conduct a "coordinated search" in
a manual file. Most users would despair at the thought of
such a laborious and cumbersome task. Yet the com
puter otters the opportunity of conducting such multi
ple access searches easily, conveniently, and quickly
thus enlarging greatly the user's power to retrieve
citations from the file.
Beyond the immediate benefits to the Library staff,
the University intends to make its public bibliographic
files available to the community at the earliest possible
date. The BALLOTS-MARC file, consisting of Library of
Congress MARC records, is now searchable via SHIRES
from any terminal on campus, including typewriter
terminals. The same searching language used by the
library for staff searching is available to the public.
How BALLOTS will look to users
Librarians have labored long under the limitations of
files which have been available in only one place. A
requirement of an automated library system, therefore,
is extension of file access beyond the confines of one
room, one building, or even one campus.
Fortunately, the computer terminal is a device which
readily permits this multiplication of file access. Com
puter video terminals (CRT's) themselves have been
evolving actively only for the past decade. Development
work has been carried out with typewriter terminals, like
the IBM 2741, in order to gain experience, test the
feasibility of multiple access searching software, and, of
course, to write and debug systems and applications
programs.
But it was obvious that the typewriter terminal could
never be satisfactorily used in a production library
environment—it was much too slow and noisy for the
heavy duty use and rapid response the library staff
needed from large bibliographic files, even though its
merit for low volume use was recognized.
The video display terminal or CRT seemed ideal for
the library's purpose, but it was not until last year that
enough choice of reliable terminals was available from
manufacturers so that / terminal could actually be
chosen for BALLOTS.
It was felt that Stanford could not afford a
customized terminal for each possible graphic applica
tion. After an extensive evaluation, the BALLOTS
Project and the Stanford Computation Center selected
,the Sanders 804 programmable terminal. A major
consideration in picking the Sanders unit was that the
unit itself is programmable (contains a minicomputer)
which allows it to meet the requirements of library
automation. Thus it will become one of the Campus
Facility's standard CRT's for video display.
The Sanders 804, pictured in center, shows a
bibliographic record which has been retrieved from the
BALLOTS-MARC file. Note that the record looks
similar to a printed Library of Congress card.

Ihe traditional format was maintained because of its
familiarity to the library staff and public, and to stress
the continuity of bibliographic records, whether manual
or computerized. (Other reformatted versions arc avail
able only to the library staff for editing, input of new
records, or update.)
A simple command language enables anyone, after a
brief instructional session, to enter simple searches for
material in the MARC file. As implementation proceeds,
other files will be accessible to the same kinds of search
commands. Here is an example of what an easy search
might look like:
find author commoner and title circle
After a little experience, the searcher learns to work
with abbreviated commands, and inputs:
fin a commoner and t circle
If Barry Commoner's The Closing Circle is in the
MARC data base, its full bibliographic citation, format
ted like a Library of Congress catalog card, will appear
on the screen of the terminal.
In the event that a searcher obtains only one book
corresponding to his search criteria, the bibliographic
data for that one title is immediately displayed to him.
If more than one book satisfies the search request, the
number of titles found by the computer search is
displayed:
"RESULT: 15 books."
At this point a very significant and advanced feature
of the BALLOTS system can be called into action:
BALLOTS searches arc interactive and negotiable.
The searcher can either expand or contract the search
result, or have each of the citations displayed before him
in turn, one at a time, just as if he were leafing through
cards in a catalog.
Except that he won't be bumping shoulders with
other users, waiting for someone else to finish using a
tray, and more importantly, he will be able to conduct
his search from any unit of the library where a CRT
terminal is located.
BALLOTS impact on the Stanford academic community
The library automation program called BALLOTS is
designed to:

1. Increase the speed of making library materials
available to the public.
The computer will enable the library to acquire,
catalog, and process materials somewhat more rapidly
than is currently the case.
2. Speed and simplify book circulation procedures.
In this area, two major improvements can be
expected.
One is to make available, from any point on campus
where there is a Sanders terminal, information on the
present location of any particular book in the automated
tiles and its present circulation status, when it is due
back, whether it is being held for another borrower, and
whether it can be held for the present inquirer, including
notification of availability.
Another goal is to make circulation as close as
possible to being a self-service process, with the
attendant simplicity and speed that would derive there
from.
3. Enlarge the breadth and depth of access to local
bibliographic records by going beyond the limited access
points provided by manual card catalogs.

Searchers will no longer be confined to exact and full
author, title, or subject entry point-bibliographic
records will be findable from parts of the entries and the
sequence of terms will no longer be so important.
4. Spread access to the bibliographic record through
out the user community by making it available wherever
a terminal is located.
It should be possible from any terminal on campus
for any student, professor, or staff member with a
budget account to find out what is in the automated
library system and what material is on order.
Information should cover Meyer Library as well as all
material newly processed by BALLOTS for the Main
Library system, all major branches which have
catalogued collections, and all of the Coordinate Li
braries that implement the system.
5. Facilitate eventual access to national and regional
data bases.
Toward the end of the 1975-79 period, it is to be
hoped that there will be economical ways of accessing
rather large data bases that are presently being developed
or are proposed for early development.
. This may include in machine-readable form the
800,000 entry catalog of recently acquired books in the
University of California library system, the Library of
Congress' National Union Catalog, the California State
Library Union Catalog, and the New York Times Data
Bank.
6. In conjunction with other systems, such as SPIRES,
begin to provide special bibliographic services to mem
bers of the academic community.
These special services will include the preparation of
"demand bibliographies," and the possible servicing of
data archives, such as opinion polls, U.S. census data,
and the like.
7. Contribute to deescalation of library costs.
This will be accomplished by assigning to the com
puter repetitive tasks, such as sorting, formatting,
printing, arranging, selecting, and otherwise mani
pulating or maintaining a bibliographic record. Slowing
down of library cost rises will lead to operating costs
lower than manual projections by the beginning of the
next decade.
The Library of Congress has begun a new and
significant program for libiary users. Designated CIP (for
Cataloging In Publication), this program makes biblio
graphic data on new books available almost immediately,
often before publication. CIP information is included in
the regular MARC Distribution Service, and is available
on BALLOTS files.
A special computerized searching facility in
BALLOTS-the Standing Search Request-will search all
MARC entries, including CIP information, as tapes come
in from Washington each week. If a specific search has
not made a hit, the Library can request the BALLOTS
system to continue searching the incoming tapes each
week for a pre-set number ol weeks.
Library staff will no longer have to waste time
repeatedly looking for cataloging information, and
bibliographic information and books will be available to
potential library users more rapidly than is possible in
the manual system.

Why libraries need computers
The "information explosion" which universities have
helped create in recent decades has inundated libraries
and research centers with so many new publications that
traditional manual systems are becoming increasingly
unable to handle the load.
Libraries are in large measure still using many of the
basic techniques devised over the last 2,600 years. These
techniques were considered moderately adequate until
the Second World War. But library systems now are
inconvenient of access, slow in response, difficult to use,
frustrating in complexity, and unresponsive to changing
needs.
Problem of huge files
Files have grown so large that they are virtually
becoming unmanageable and many libraries have
seriously considered ceasing to add to their card catalogs
and starting afresh for new acquisitions with some
degree of automation.
* Ohio State University has announced that its card
catalog will be closed and replaced by computer-oriented
bibliographic services in 1976.
* The Library of Congress has predicted that, at the
present rate of growth, by 1980 its own public catalog
will contain some 32,000,000 cards—a tile so vast that
its manageability is questionable.
* Even at Stanford, which is the nation's eighth
largest research library, the various catalogs available to
the public are estimated to contain some ten million
cards.
To create this major bibliographic tool-key to the
millions of bibliographic units at Stanford—requires
many formalized activities and functions which are
routine and which do not require interpretive, scholarly,
or qualitative judgments. Many of these lunctions are
almost ideally suited to machine processing.
More cost, less service
Constantly rising costs are another factor in the
libraries' desire to turn to computers. Labor costs go up
5 to 6 percent each year, whereas the cost of computer
transactions goes up at only half that rate.
It is thus clear that at some point in the future the
University should be paying increasingly less for library
services under a machine system than if it stuck with thu
tried and tested manual process with its ever increasing
complexities and frustrations.
And at the same time a machine system is a more
powerful instrument for giving full, very precise, and
more rapid access to local and national library resources.
Library collections double in size about every 16
years. Even in periods of social unrest or economic
dislocation, the spiral of publishing and communication
activity continues upwards.
Unfortunately, when a library doubles in size, the
effort required to maintain an equivalent level of service
more than doubles-and therein lies the rub.
The large research library at times seems to resemble
a dinosaur or a book museum. In the one instance, it is
slow and ponderous, not terribly adaptive or responsive
to changes in environment. In the other, it grows and
accumulates material relentlessly~yct the adequacy of
its services diminishes as it increases in size because it is
so difficult to access anything within a reasonable time.
Modernization and service improvement needed
The situation may be aggravated by the apparent
increase of interest in interdisciplinary or multidiscipli
nary studies which runs counter to pressures for physical
decentralization of libraries. The scholar in urban prob
lems has to shuttle between the Main Library, the Law
Library, the Jackson Library of Business, and perhaps
the Engineering and Art libraries.
If lie is unable to determine from some central place
(or better yet, from his own office, department, or
laboratory) whether one library or another possesses a
book and also whether that book is available for use, he
may give up in all but the most pressing searches.
In frustration, potential library users may turn to
other services or devices for their information needs—
perhaps building a personal library, long distance tele
phone conversations with colleagues, costly and time
consuming conferences, purchase of commercial inform
ation service, or the multiplication of branch libraries.
Students, and particularly graduate students, research
staff and faculty are now increasingly critical of the
ability of libraries to respond to current needs. Yet the
library is still a major and essential component in a huge
network of information processing; it too must be
brought into the 20th century.
Efforts to make this change at Stanford began more
than six years ago in the Stanford library automation
project. Involving 100 people and nearly $2 million to
date, it is called Project BALLOTS-for Bibliographic
Automation of Large Library Operations using a Time
sharing System. One ot the most advanced library
automation projects in the country, it still will require
several more years to complete. (See table.)
What BALLOTS can do for you
Computer terminals will aid you in 1973 and later
years to borrow books, search for publications you need,
determine what the library has on a subject for your
interest, and determine if a bibliographic citation that
interests you is now in the Stanford Library and if so,
where it is and whether it is in use.
This effort is the result of computer programs written
to operate television-like terminals that arc now in the
Main Library and will be added in Meyer and other
major library branches in the course of the next two to
four years. (Any typewriter terminal on campus can
already search the BALLOTS-MARC file, which consists
of current Library of Congress catalog data.)
The library staff will be able to help you with your
searches during 1973-4; it is expected that public use of
the TV-like terminals may start as early as 1974.

How BALLOTS works
Using terminals with cathode ray tubes, popularly
called "CRT's," library staff now conducts searches of
bibliographic files, enters commands and tells the com
puter to format data for purchase orders, sort the orders
alphabetically by vendor, and print them overnight.
The computer will also print messages notifying
faculty or student requesters that their materials have
arrived. Search commands will find Library of Congress
bibliographic data if available, and if not available, will
eventually enable the staff to create their own data on
the spot.
Similarly, commands entered at the terminal will
instruct the computer to properly format desired biblio
graphic data, sort it in batches for the main and
departmental libraries, and within each batch, print out
the complete set of library cards already sorted in
correct alphabetical filing sequence.
The magnitude of this operation is appreciated when
it is realized that the typical large research library
prepares between half a million and a million cards each
year—a job which in the manual system is not very
interesting and is susceptible to error.
In circulation, data collection devices and machine
readable identification cards will speed circulation tran
sactions and virtually eliminate the nuisance of filling
out charge cards by hand.
In summary the system will aid processing of roman
alphabet material acquired, and items the catalog listing
of which can be transliterated. There will be a consider
able time period before a sufficiently large fraction of
the library's holdings is contained in machine-readable
fdes to make automatic search rewarding to the general
user.
This time varies depending upon discipline. In the
sciences, it might be as short as two to five years. In the
humanities perhaps as much as 30 to 50 years, or until
such time as technological breakthroughs provide in
expensive, reliable conversion to machine-readable form
of massive bibliographic files-a prospect which docs not
seem imminent at this writing.
Unfortunately, a majority of the use of the library by
scientists involves the search for journal articles and
these will not be included in the initial implementation

against search programs. (SPIRES—the Stanford Public
Information REtrieval System-is a computer-based,
generalized information system. See Campus Report

Thus from the point of view of general patron search
of the library catalog, we must consider that BALLOTS

location a serious geographic limitation to the flow of
bibliographic information in the academic community.
Consider next the problem of searching for a book in
a manual file such as a conventional card catalog.
The typical card catalog is arranged in "dictionary"
form, with authors, titles, subjects, and corporate bodies
all interfiled in one alphabet. Suppose, as is not
unreasonable, that a library user or staff member needs
to search for an item under several different access
points simultaneously. Let us say he wants to find works
on the recycling of solid wastes and the generation of
electric power. Practically speaking, he cannot do this in
the card catalog, because it is basically a single access
file.
Only with very great inconvenience to himself (and
others) and with greatly diminished response time is it
possible for a user to conduct a "coordinated search" in
a manual file. Most users would despair at the thought of
such a laborious and cumbersome task. Yet the com
puter otters the opportunity of conducting such multi
ple access searches easily, conveniently, and quickly
thus enlarging greatly the user's power to retrieve
citations from the file.
Beyond the immediate benefits to the Library staff,
the University intends to make its public bibliographic
files available to the community at the earliest possible
date. The BALLOTS-MARC file, consisting of Library of
Congress MARC records, is now searchable via SHIRES
from any terminal on campus, including typewriter
terminals. The same searching language used by the
library for staff searching is available to the public.
How BALLOTS will look to users
Librarians have labored long under the limitations of
files which have been available in only one place. A
requirement of an automated library system, therefore,
is extension of file access beyond the confines of one
room, one building, or even one campus.
Fortunately, the computer terminal is a device which
readily permits this multiplication of file access. Com
puter video terminals (CRT's) themselves have been
evolving actively only for the past decade. Development
work has been carried out with typewriter terminals, like
the IBM 2741, in order to gain experience, test the
feasibility of multiple access searching software, and, of
course, to write and debug systems and applications
programs.
But it was obvious that the typewriter terminal could
never be satisfactorily used in a production library
environment—it was much too slow and noisy for the
heavy duty use and rapid response the library staff
needed from large bibliographic files, even though its
merit for low volume use was recognized.
The video display terminal or CRT seemed ideal for
the library's purpose, but it was not until last year that
enough choice of reliable terminals was available from
manufacturers so that / terminal could actually be
chosen for BALLOTS.
It was felt that Stanford could not afford a
customized terminal for each possible graphic applica
tion. After an extensive evaluation, the BALLOTS
Project and the Stanford Computation Center selected
,the Sanders 804 programmable terminal. A major
consideration in picking the Sanders unit was that the
unit itself is programmable (contains a minicomputer)
which allows it to meet the requirements of library
automation. Thus it will become one of the Campus
Facility's standard CRT's for video display.
The Sanders 804, pictured in center, shows a
bibliographic record which has been retrieved from the
BALLOTS-MARC file. Note that the record looks
similar to a printed Library of Congress card.

Ihe traditional format was maintained because of its
familiarity to the library staff and public, and to stress
the continuity of bibliographic records, whether manual
or computerized. (Other reformatted versions arc avail
able only to the library staff for editing, input of new
records, or update.)
A simple command language enables anyone, after a
brief instructional session, to enter simple searches for
material in the MARC file. As implementation proceeds,
other files will be accessible to the same kinds of search
commands. Here is an example of what an easy search
might look like:
find author commoner and title circle
After a little experience, the searcher learns to work
with abbreviated commands, and inputs:
fin a commoner and t circle
If Barry Commoner's The Closing Circle is in the
MARC data base, its full bibliographic citation, format
ted like a Library of Congress catalog card, will appear
on the screen of the terminal.
In the event that a searcher obtains only one book
corresponding to his search criteria, the bibliographic
data for that one title is immediately displayed to him.
If more than one book satisfies the search request, the
number of titles found by the computer search is
displayed:
"RESULT: 15 books."
At this point a very significant and advanced feature
of the BALLOTS system can be called into action:
BALLOTS searches arc interactive and negotiable.
The searcher can either expand or contract the search
result, or have each of the citations displayed before him
in turn, one at a time, just as if he were leafing through
cards in a catalog.
Except that he won't be bumping shoulders with
other users, waiting for someone else to finish using a
tray, and more importantly, he will be able to conduct
his search from any unit of the library where a CRT
terminal is located.
BALLOTS impact on the Stanford academic community
The library automation program called BALLOTS is
designed to:

1. Increase the speed of making library materials
available to the public.
The computer will enable the library to acquire,
catalog, and process materials somewhat more rapidly
than is currently the case.
2. Speed and simplify book circulation procedures.
In this area, two major improvements can be
expected.
One is to make available, from any point on campus
where there is a Sanders terminal, information on the
present location of any particular book in the automated
tiles and its present circulation status, when it is due
back, whether it is being held for another borrower, and
whether it can be held for the present inquirer, including
notification of availability.
Another goal is to make circulation as close as
possible to being a self-service process, with the
attendant simplicity and speed that would derive there
from.
3. Enlarge the breadth and depth of access to local
bibliographic records by going beyond the limited access
points provided by manual card catalogs.

Searchers will no longer be confined to exact and full
author, title, or subject entry point-bibliographic
records will be findable from parts of the entries and the
sequence of terms will no longer be so important.
4. Spread access to the bibliographic record through
out the user community by making it available wherever
a terminal is located.
It should be possible from any terminal on campus
for any student, professor, or staff member with a
budget account to find out what is in the automated
library system and what material is on order.
Information should cover Meyer Library as well as all
material newly processed by BALLOTS for the Main
Library system, all major branches which have
catalogued collections, and all of the Coordinate Li
braries that implement the system.
5. Facilitate eventual access to national and regional
data bases.
Toward the end of the 1975-79 period, it is to be
hoped that there will be economical ways of accessing
rather large data bases that are presently being developed
or are proposed for early development.
. This may include in machine-readable form the
800,000 entry catalog of recently acquired books in the
University of California library system, the Library of
Congress' National Union Catalog, the California State
Library Union Catalog, and the New York Times Data
Bank.
6. In conjunction with other systems, such as SPIRES,
begin to provide special bibliographic services to mem
bers of the academic community.
These special services will include the preparation of
"demand bibliographies," and the possible servicing of
data archives, such as opinion polls, U.S. census data,
and the like.
7. Contribute to deescalation of library costs.
This will be accomplished by assigning to the com
puter repetitive tasks, such as sorting, formatting,
printing, arranging, selecting, and otherwise mani
pulating or maintaining a bibliographic record. Slowing
down of library cost rises will lead to operating costs
lower than manual projections by the beginning of the
next decade.
The Library of Congress has begun a new and
significant program for libiary users. Designated CIP (for
Cataloging In Publication), this program makes biblio
graphic data on new books available almost immediately,
often before publication. CIP information is included in
the regular MARC Distribution Service, and is available
on BALLOTS files.
A special computerized searching facility in
BALLOTS-the Standing Search Request-will search all
MARC entries, including CIP information, as tapes come
in from Washington each week. If a specific search has
not made a hit, the Library can request the BALLOTS
system to continue searching the incoming tapes each
week for a pre-set number ol weeks.
Library staff will no longer have to waste time
repeatedly looking for cataloging information, and
bibliographic information and books will be available to
potential library users more rapidly than is possible in
the manual system.

BALLOTS by David C. Weber and Allen B. Veaner of
the University Libraries staff.
Why libraries need computers
The "information explosion" which universities have
helped create in recent decades has inundated libraries
and research centers with so many new publications that
traditional manual systems are becoming increasingly
unable to handle the load.
Libraries are in large measure still using many of the
basic techniques devised over the last 2,600 years. These
techniques were considered moderately adequate until
the Second World War. But library systems now are
inconvenient of access, slow in response, difficult to use,
frustrating in complexity, and unresponsive to changing
needs.
Problem of huge files
Files have grown so large that they are virtually
becoming unmanageable and many libraries have
seriously considered ceasing to add to their card catalogs
and starting afresh for new acquisitions with some
degree of automation.
* Ohio State University has announced that its card
catalog will be closed and replaced by computer-oriented
bibliographic services in 1976.
* The Library of Congress has predicted that, at the
present rate of growth, by 1980 its own public catalog
will contain some 32,000,000 cards—a tile so vast that
its manageability is questionable.
* Even at Stanford, which is the nation's eighth
largest research library, the various catalogs available to
the public are estimated to contain some ten million
cards.
To create this major bibliographic tool-key to the
millions of bibliographic units at Stanford—requires
many formalized activities and functions which are
routine and which do not require interpretive, scholarly,
or qualitative judgments. Many of these lunctions are
almost ideally suited to machine processing.
More cost, less service
Constantly rising costs are another factor in the
libraries' desire to turn to computers. Labor costs go up
5 to 6 percent each year, whereas the cost of computer
transactions goes up at only half that rate.
It is thus clear that at some point in the future the
University should be paying increasingly less for library
services under a machine system than if it stuck with thu
tried and tested manual process with its ever increasing
complexities and frustrations.
And at the same time a machine system is a more
powerful instrument for giving full, very precise, and
more rapid access to local and national library resources.
Library collections double in size about every 16
years. Even in periods of social unrest or economic
dislocation, the spiral of publishing and communication
activity continues upwards.
Unfortunately, when a library doubles in size, the
effort required to maintain an equivalent level of service
more than doubles-and therein lies the rub.
The large research library at times seems to resemble
a dinosaur or a book museum. In the one instance, it is
slow and ponderous, not terribly adaptive or responsive
to changes in environment. In the other, it grows and
accumulates material relentlessly~yct the adequacy of
its services diminishes as it increases in size because it is
so difficult to access anything within a reasonable time.
Modernization and service improvement needed
The situation may be aggravated by the apparent
increase of interest in interdisciplinary or multidiscipli
nary studies which runs counter to pressures for physical
decentralization of libraries. The scholar in urban prob
lems has to shuttle between the Main Library, the Law
Library, the Jackson Library of Business, and perhaps
the Engineering and Art libraries.
If lie is unable to determine from some central place
(or better yet, from his own office, department, or
laboratory) whether one library or another possesses a
book and also whether that book is available for use, he
may give up in all but the most pressing searches.
In frustration, potential library users may turn to
other services or devices for their information needs—
perhaps building a personal library, long distance tele
phone conversations with colleagues, costly and time
consuming conferences, purchase of commercial inform
ation service, or the multiplication of branch libraries.
Students, and particularly graduate students, research
staff and faculty are now increasingly critical of the
ability of libraries to respond to current needs. Yet the
library is still a major and essential component in a huge
network of information processing; it too must be
brought into the 20th century.
Efforts to make this change at Stanford began more
than six years ago in the Stanford library automation
project. Involving 100 people and nearly $2 million to
date, it is called Project BALLOTS-for Bibliographic
Automation of Large Library Operations using a Time
sharing System. One ot the most advanced library
automation projects in the country, it still will require
several more years to complete. (See table.)
What BALLOTS can do for you
Computer terminals will aid you in 1973 and later
years to borrow books, search for publications you need,
determine what the library has on a subject for your
interest, and determine if a bibliographic citation that
interests you is now in the Stanford Library and if so,
where it is and whether it is in use.
This effort is the result of computer programs written
to operate television-like terminals that arc now in the
Main Library and will be added in Meyer and other
major library branches in the course of the next two to
four years. (Any typewriter terminal on campus can
already search the BALLOTS-MARC file, which consists
of current Library of Congress catalog data.)
The library staff will be able to help you with your
searches during 1973-4; it is expected that public use of
the TV-like terminals may start as early as 1974.

How BALLOTS works
Using terminals with cathode ray tubes, popularly
called "CRT's," library staff now conducts searches of
bibliographic files, enters commands and tells the com
puter to format data for purchase orders, sort the orders
alphabetically by vendor, and print them overnight.
The computer will also print messages notifying
faculty or student requesters that their materials have
arrived. Search commands will find Library of Congress
bibliographic data if available, and if not available, will
eventually enable the staff to create their own data on
the spot.
Similarly, commands entered at the terminal will
instruct the computer to properly format desired biblio
graphic data, sort it in batches for the main and
departmental libraries, and within each batch, print out
the complete set of library cards already sorted in
correct alphabetical filing sequence.
The magnitude of this operation is appreciated when
it is realized that the typical large research library
prepares between half a million and a million cards each
year—a job which in the manual system is not very
interesting and is susceptible to error.
In circulation, data collection devices and machine
readable identification cards will speed circulation tran
sactions and virtually eliminate the nuisance of filling
out charge cards by hand.
In summary the system will aid processing of roman
alphabet material acquired, and items the catalog listing
of which can be transliterated. There will be a consider
able time period before a sufficiently large fraction of
the library's holdings is contained in machine-readable
fdes to make automatic search rewarding to the general
user.
This time varies depending upon discipline. In the
sciences, it might be as short as two to five years. In the
humanities perhaps as much as 30 to 50 years, or until
such time as technological breakthroughs provide in
expensive, reliable conversion to machine-readable form
of massive bibliographic files-a prospect which docs not
seem imminent at this writing.
Unfortunately, a majority of the use of the library by
scientists involves the search for journal articles and
these will not be included in the initial implementation
of the system because of the expense of buying and
processing machine-readable data bases.
Typically, lists in machine-readable form for journal
citations covering a broad subject cost from
$10,000-25,000 each year, more than that to store
locally, and still more to convert them to internal

machine formats like SPIRES so that they can be run
against search programs. (SPIRES—the Stanford Public
Information REtrieval System-is a computer-based,
generalized information system. See Campus Report
Oct. 11, 1972 p. 1-2.)
Thus from the point of view of general patron search
of the library catalog, we must consider that BALLOTS
piovides a benefit of increasing utility over a period of
years.
The Meyer Library represents an exception in that all
its holdings (except journalarticles) will included in
the on-line catalog. The Meyer catalog is now printed,
bound, and distributed in book form to several locations
on campus.
Computer applications in bibliographic data
In 1965, the Library of Congress started a develop
ment program to apply computer technology to the
creation and distribution of its large pool of biblio
graphic data.
Known as the MARC Project (Machine Readable
Cataloging), this effort eventually resulted in establish
ment of a national and international standard for
creating magnetic tapes containing all the information
normally found on printed Library of Congress cards
cards which form the backbone of the cataloging system
in nearly every major research library in North America.
For several years now the Library of Congress has
been distributing weekly magnetic tapes containing
machine readable bibliographic records for currently
catalogued books. The service began with English lan
guage books and late in the current fiscal year will be
extended to French titles, to be followed by titles in
other romance languages and in German.
The MARC tapes form one of the foundations of the
BALLOTS system. But BALLOTS also will permit
libraries at Stanford to create their own bibliographic
records for items not yet represented in the MARC
service. Machine readable bibliographic records from
MARC now make it possible for staff of the Stanford
Libraries to:
1. Search the files for information on a book,
whether the information is known precisely or
imprecisely.
2. Create purchase orders for books without the
requirement to retype the data.
3. Have the computer print catalog cards without the
requirement for any further typing or
proofreading.

(This space paid for by News and Publications)
4. Sort the cards by computer (before they are*
printed), resulting in the saving of the human labor
which would otherwise be necessary to sort the
close to one million cards prepared each year at
Stanford.
5. Notify interested library patrons that requested
books have arrived and are available for use.
These are just a few of the major activities which
Project BALLOTS now performs.
Computer access will, however, allow the user of the
Meyer Library to determine whether the Meyer Library
has the book and whether it is on the shelf. It thus
provides a more up-to-date inventory than found in the
printed catalog which is now cumulated every other year
and provided with quarterly supplements.
There are many others, such as preparing spine labels
which permits books to be identified and shelved
together in the stacks, gathering statistics, and upgrading
or otherwise editing existing bibliographic data. In the
near future the system will provide the capability to post
and update control files applicable to ordered items
(such as change of titles, delay in publication, etc.).
BALLOTS: An advanced, on-line facility
Research and development into computer applica
tions has been under way in North American research
libraries for two decades and especially during the last
seven years. Most of the applications have been to
circulation and technical processes, while nearly all have
relied upon the conventional batch processing com
puting environment. t
The BALLOTS system now becoming operational at
Stanford is substantially different from these earlier
efforts.
Since its inception BALLOTS has been oriented
toward on-line data processing, an approach which is
being found increasingly practical by other library
systems as well. BALLOTS employs technology and
software far more complex than that required for batch
operations. The complexity of on-line operations in
comparison with batch (or "off-line") operations tor the
bibliographic work done at Stanford has been estimated
to range from 10 to 50 times greater.
The development of an on-line system is possible only
in a computer environment characterized by great
intellectual strength and extensive experience. The Stan
ford University Libraries are fortunate to be able to
work in a university environment characterized by this
competence and degree of excellence.
Basically, an on-line system permits a transaction to
be conducted and brought to a relatively immediate
conclusion, whereas a batch system requires all transac
tions to be deferred (i.e., batched) for a processing job in
the computer and its printer.
The Library is a very transaction-oriented system. At
Stanford the total number of transactions of all types is
about 2,000,000 per year, or an average of about 8,000
each day.
When a library transaction is being conducted, the
patron or the staff member usually needs an immediate,
or at least a rapid, response. When a student or faculty
member cannot find a desired book on the shelf, he
wants to know now whether it is charged to some other
user-not tomorrow or next week.
When an acquisition librarian receives a book pur
chase request, he has to know at once whether the book
has already been ordered—not a week or a day later.
Thus, the library operation is typically an on-line
manual system. The availability of on-line expertise at
Stanford plus the possibility of obtaining external giant
monies to fund development work combined to in
fluence the direction of the development effort toward
an advanced, on-line facility. (See accompanying story
on The people-andprograms-behind BALLOTS.)
What BALLOTS will do for the library staff and users
One way to envision what BALLOTS will do is to
look at some of the limitations of current manual
systems. Take book circulation, for instance.
At present, Stanford library users must write their
names, addresses, and all the book information onto a
card for each book they desire to charge out. The charge
card is in two parts—one goes with the book and the
other is filed by call number so the location ol each
book can be known.
This system obviously has two inconveniences: one
for the patron and one for the library staff. Much of the
patron's time is consumed writing repetitive information
which could easily be recorded by data collection
devices and machine-readable identification cards, one
for the book and one for the patron.
Much staff time is consumed arranging and filing
charge cards and the work is subject to human error.
Furthermore, in the manual system, in order to find out
which books are overdue, one must run through the
whole file even including cards for books which are not
overdue.
Book purchasing is another area of potential change
through automation. When a book is recommended for
purchase, very often the exact title is not known, the
author's name may be incomplete or misspelled, or
authorship may even be attributed to the wrong organi
zation or person.
The control file for books on order contains a few
tens of thousands of copies of purchase orders; these
copies are on 3"x5" slips, which makes them difficult to
search and hard to maintain in file.
It is economically prohibitive in a manual system to
maintain outstanding order files in several sequences to
account for variations. Typically, a copy of a purchase
order is filed in only one location in the file; therefore,
the required information on an ordered title can be
found in only one place in the file.
Furthermore, the file itself is available in only one
location a serious geographic limitation to the flow of
bibliographic information in the academic community.
Consider next the problem of searching for a book in
a manual file such as a conventional card catalog.
The typical card catalog is arranged in "dictionary"
form, with authors, titles, subjects, and corporate bodies
all interfiled in one alphabet. Suppose, as is not
unreasonable, that a library user or staff member needs
to search for an item under several different access
points simultaneously. Let us say he wants to find works
on the recycling of solid wastes and the generation of
electric power. Practically speaking, he cannot do this in
the card catalog, because it is basically a single access
file.
Only with very great inconvenience to himself (and
others) and with greatly diminished response time is it
possible for a user to conduct a "coordinated search" in
a manual file. Most users would despair at the thought of
such a laborious and cumbersome task. Yet the com

Why libraries need computers
The "information explosion" which universities have
helped create in recent decades has inundated libraries
and research centers with so many new publications that
traditional manual systems are becoming increasingly
unable to handle the load.
Libraries are in large measure still using many of the
basic techniques devised over the last 2,600 years. These
techniques were considered moderately adequate until
the Second World War. But library systems now are
inconvenient of access, slow in response, difficult to use,
frustrating in complexity, and unresponsive to changing
needs.
Problem of huge files
Files have grown so large that they are virtually
becoming unmanageable and many libraries have
seriously considered ceasing to add to their card catalogs
and starting afresh for new acquisitions with some
degree of automation.
* Ohio State University has announced that its card
catalog will be closed and replaced by computer-oriented
bibliographic services in 1976.
* The Library of Congress has predicted that, at the
present rate of growth, by 1980 its own public catalog
will contain some 32,000,000 cards—a tile so vast that
its manageability is questionable.
* Even at Stanford, which is the nation's eighth
largest research library, the various catalogs available to
the public are estimated to contain some ten million
cards.
To create this major bibliographic tool-key to the
millions of bibliographic units at Stanford—requires
many formalized activities and functions which are
routine and which do not require interpretive, scholarly,
or qualitative judgments. Many of these lunctions are
almost ideally suited to machine processing.
More cost, less service
Constantly rising costs are another factor in the
libraries' desire to turn to computers. Labor costs go up
5 to 6 percent each year, whereas the cost of computer
transactions goes up at only half that rate.
It is thus clear that at some point in the future the
University should be paying increasingly less for library
services under a machine system than if it stuck with thu
tried and tested manual process with its ever increasing
complexities and frustrations.
And at the same time a machine system is a more
powerful instrument for giving full, very precise, and
more rapid access to local and national library resources.
Library collections double in size about every 16
years. Even in periods of social unrest or economic
dislocation, the spiral of publishing and communication
activity continues upwards.
Unfortunately, when a library doubles in size, the
effort required to maintain an equivalent level of service
more than doubles-and therein lies the rub.
The large research library at times seems to resemble
a dinosaur or a book museum. In the one instance, it is
slow and ponderous, not terribly adaptive or responsive
to changes in environment. In the other, it grows and
accumulates material relentlessly~yct the adequacy of
its services diminishes as it increases in size because it is
so difficult to access anything within a reasonable time.
Modernization and service improvement needed
The situation may be aggravated by the apparent
increase of interest in interdisciplinary or multidiscipli
nary studies which runs counter to pressures for physical
decentralization of libraries. The scholar in urban prob
lems has to shuttle between the Main Library, the Law
Library, the Jackson Library of Business, and perhaps
the Engineering and Art libraries.
If lie is unable to determine from some central place
(or better yet, from his own office, department, or
laboratory) whether one library or another possesses a
book and also whether that book is available for use, he
may give up in all but the most pressing searches.
In frustration, potential library users may turn to
other services or devices for their information needs—
perhaps building a personal library, long distance tele
phone conversations with colleagues, costly and time
consuming conferences, purchase of commercial inform
ation service, or the multiplication of branch libraries.
Students, and particularly graduate students, research
staff and faculty are now increasingly critical of the
ability of libraries to respond to current needs. Yet the
library is still a major and essential component in a huge
network of information processing; it too must be
brought into the 20th century.
Efforts to make this change at Stanford began more
than six years ago in the Stanford library automation
project. Involving 100 people and nearly $2 million to
date, it is called Project BALLOTS-for Bibliographic
Automation of Large Library Operations using a Time
sharing System. One ot the most advanced library
automation projects in the country, it still will require
several more years to complete. (See table.)
What BALLOTS can do for you
Computer terminals will aid you in 1973 and later
years to borrow books, search for publications you need,
determine what the library has on a subject for your
interest, and determine if a bibliographic citation that
interests you is now in the Stanford Library and if so,
where it is and whether it is in use.
This effort is the result of computer programs written
to operate television-like terminals that arc now in the
Main Library and will be added in Meyer and other
major library branches in the course of the next two to
four years. (Any typewriter terminal on campus can
already search the BALLOTS-MARC file, which consists
of current Library of Congress catalog data.)
The library staff will be able to help you with your
searches during 1973-4; it is expected that public use of
the TV-like terminals may start as early as 1974.

How BALLOTS works
Using terminals with cathode ray tubes, popularly
called "CRT's," library staff now conducts searches of
bibliographic files, enters commands and tells the com
puter to format data for purchase orders, sort the orders
alphabetically by vendor, and print them overnight.
The computer will also print messages notifying
faculty or student requesters that their materials have
arrived. Search commands will find Library of Congress
bibliographic data if available, and if not available, will
eventually enable the staff to create their own data on
the spot.
Similarly, commands entered at the terminal will
instruct the computer to properly format desired biblio
graphic data, sort it in batches for the main and
departmental libraries, and within each batch, print out
the complete set of library cards already sorted in
correct alphabetical filing sequence.
The magnitude of this operation is appreciated when
it is realized that the typical large research library
prepares between half a million and a million cards each
year—a job which in the manual system is not very
interesting and is susceptible to error.
In circulation, data collection devices and machine
readable identification cards will speed circulation tran
sactions and virtually eliminate the nuisance of filling
out charge cards by hand.
In summary the system will aid processing of roman
alphabet material acquired, and items the catalog listing
of which can be transliterated. There will be a consider
able time period before a sufficiently large fraction of
the library's holdings is contained in machine-readable
fdes to make automatic search rewarding to the general
user.
This time varies depending upon discipline. In the
sciences, it might be as short as two to five years. In the
humanities perhaps as much as 30 to 50 years, or until
such time as technological breakthroughs provide in
expensive, reliable conversion to machine-readable form
of massive bibliographic files-a prospect which docs not
seem imminent at this writing.
Unfortunately, a majority of the use of the library by
scientists involves the search for journal articles and
these will not be included in the initial implementation
of the system because of the expense of buying and
processing machine-readable data bases.
Typically, lists in machine-readable form for journal
citations covering a broad subject cost from
$10,000-25,000 each year, more than that to store
locally, and still more to convert them to internal

machine formats like SPIRES so that they can be run
against search programs. (SPIRES—the Stanford Public
Information REtrieval System-is a computer-based,
generalized information system. See Campus Report
Oct. 11, 1972 p. 1-2.)
Thus from the point of view of general patron search
of the library catalog, we must consider that BALLOTS
piovides a benefit of increasing utility over a period of
years.
The Meyer Library represents an exception in that all
its holdings (except journalarticles) will included in
the on-line catalog. The Meyer catalog is now printed,
bound, and distributed in book form to several locations
on campus.
Computer applications in bibliographic data
In 1965, the Library of Congress started a develop
ment program to apply computer technology to the
creation and distribution of its large pool of biblio
graphic data.
Known as the MARC Project (Machine Readable
Cataloging), this effort eventually resulted in establish
ment of a national and international standard for
creating magnetic tapes containing all the information
normally found on printed Library of Congress cards
cards which form the backbone of the cataloging system
in nearly every major research library in North America.
For several years now the Library of Congress has
been distributing weekly magnetic tapes containing
machine readable bibliographic records for currently
catalogued books. The service began with English lan
guage books and late in the current fiscal year will be
extended to French titles, to be followed by titles in
other romance languages and in German.
The MARC tapes form one of the foundations of the
BALLOTS system. But BALLOTS also will permit
libraries at Stanford to create their own bibliographic
records for items not yet represented in the MARC
service. Machine readable bibliographic records from
MARC now make it possible for staff of the Stanford
Libraries to:
1. Search the files for information on a book,
whether the information is known precisely or
imprecisely.
2. Create purchase orders for books without the
requirement to retype the data.
3. Have the computer print catalog cards without the
requirement for any further typing or
proofreading.

(This space paid for by News and Publications)
4. Sort the cards by computer (before they are*
printed), resulting in the saving of the human labor
which would otherwise be necessary to sort the
close to one million cards prepared each year at
Stanford.
5. Notify interested library patrons that requested
books have arrived and are available for use.
These are just a few of the major activities which
Project BALLOTS now performs.
Computer access will, however, allow the user of the
Meyer Library to determine whether the Meyer Library
has the book and whether it is on the shelf. It thus
provides a more up-to-date inventory than found in the
printed catalog which is now cumulated every other year
and provided with quarterly supplements.
There are many others, such as preparing spine labels
which permits books to be identified and shelved
together in the stacks, gathering statistics, and upgrading
or otherwise editing existing bibliographic data. In the
near future the system will provide the capability to post
and update control files applicable to ordered items
(such as change of titles, delay in publication, etc.).
BALLOTS: An advanced, on-line facility
Research and development into computer applica
tions has been under way in North American research
libraries for two decades and especially during the last
seven years. Most of the applications have been to
circulation and technical processes, while nearly all have
relied upon the conventional batch processing com
puting environment. t
The BALLOTS system now becoming operational at
Stanford is substantially different from these earlier
efforts.
Since its inception BALLOTS has been oriented
toward on-line data processing, an approach which is
being found increasingly practical by other library
systems as well. BALLOTS employs technology and
software far more complex than that required for batch
operations. The complexity of on-line operations in
comparison with batch (or "off-line") operations tor the
bibliographic work done at Stanford has been estimated
to range from 10 to 50 times greater.
The development of an on-line system is possible only
in a computer environment characterized by great
intellectual strength and extensive experience. The Stan
ford University Libraries are fortunate to be able to
work in a university environment characterized by this
competence and degree of excellence.
Basically, an on-line system permits a transaction to
be conducted and brought to a relatively immediate
conclusion, whereas a batch system requires all transac
tions to be deferred (i.e., batched) for a processing job in
the computer and its printer.
The Library is a very transaction-oriented system. At
Stanford the total number of transactions of all types is
about 2,000,000 per year, or an average of about 8,000
each day.
When a library transaction is being conducted, the
patron or the staff member usually needs an immediate,
or at least a rapid, response. When a student or faculty
member cannot find a desired book on the shelf, he
wants to know now whether it is charged to some other
user-not tomorrow or next week.
When an acquisition librarian receives a book pur
chase request, he has to know at once whether the book
has already been ordered—not a week or a day later.
Thus, the library operation is typically an on-line
manual system. The availability of on-line expertise at
Stanford plus the possibility of obtaining external giant
monies to fund development work combined to in
fluence the direction of the development effort toward
an advanced, on-line facility. (See accompanying story
on The people-andprograms-behind BALLOTS.)
What BALLOTS will do for the library staff and users
One way to envision what BALLOTS will do is to
look at some of the limitations of current manual
systems. Take book circulation, for instance.
At present, Stanford library users must write their
names, addresses, and all the book information onto a
card for each book they desire to charge out. The charge
card is in two parts—one goes with the book and the
other is filed by call number so the location ol each
book can be known.
This system obviously has two inconveniences: one
for the patron and one for the library staff. Much of the
patron's time is consumed writing repetitive information
which could easily be recorded by data collection
devices and machine-readable identification cards, one
for the book and one for the patron.
Much staff time is consumed arranging and filing
charge cards and the work is subject to human error.
Furthermore, in the manual system, in order to find out
which books are overdue, one must run through the
whole file even including cards for books which are not
overdue.
Book purchasing is another area of potential change
through automation. When a book is recommended for
purchase, very often the exact title is not known, the
author's name may be incomplete or misspelled, or
authorship may even be attributed to the wrong organi
zation or person.
The control file for books on order contains a few
tens of thousands of copies of purchase orders; these
copies are on 3"x5" slips, which makes them difficult to
search and hard to maintain in file.
It is economically prohibitive in a manual system to
maintain outstanding order files in several sequences to
account for variations. Typically, a copy of a purchase
order is filed in only one location in the file; therefore,
the required information on an ordered title can be
found in only one place in the file.
Furthermore, the file itself is available in only one
location a serious geographic limitation to the flow of
bibliographic information in the academic community.
Consider next the problem of searching for a book in
a manual file such as a conventional card catalog.
The typical card catalog is arranged in "dictionary"
form, with authors, titles, subjects, and corporate bodies
all interfiled in one alphabet. Suppose, as is not
unreasonable, that a library user or staff member needs
to search for an item under several different access
points simultaneously. Let us say he wants to find works
on the recycling of solid wastes and the generation of
electric power. Practically speaking, he cannot do this in
the card catalog, because it is basically a single access
file.
Only with very great inconvenience to himself (and
others) and with greatly diminished response time is it
possible for a user to conduct a "coordinated search" in
a manual file. Most users would despair at the thought of
such a laborious and cumbersome task. Yet the com
puter otters the opportunity of conducting such multi
ple access searches easily, conveniently, and quickly
thus enlarging greatly the user's power to retrieve
citations from the file.
Beyond the immediate benefits to the Library staff,
the University intends to make its public bibliographic
files available to the community at the earliest possible
date. The BALLOTS-MARC file, consisting of Library of
Congress MARC records, is now searchable via SHIRES
from any terminal on campus, including typewriter
terminals. The same searching language used by the
library for staff searching is available to the public.
How BALLOTS will look to users
Librarians have labored long under the limitations of
files which have been available in only one place. A
requirement of an automated library system, therefore,
is extension of file access beyond the confines of one
room, one building, or even one campus.
Fortunately, the computer terminal is a device which
readily permits this multiplication of file access. Com
puter video terminals (CRT's) themselves have been
evolving actively only for the past decade. Development
work has been carried out with typewriter terminals, like
the IBM 2741, in order to gain experience, test the
feasibility of multiple access searching software, and, of
course, to write and debug systems and applications
programs.
But it was obvious that the typewriter terminal could
never be satisfactorily used in a production library
environment—it was much too slow and noisy for the
heavy duty use and rapid response the library staff
needed from large bibliographic files, even though its
merit for low volume use was recognized.
The video display terminal or CRT seemed ideal for
the library's purpose, but it was not until last year that
enough choice of reliable terminals was available from
manufacturers so that / terminal could actually be
chosen for BALLOTS.
It was felt that Stanford could not afford a
customized terminal for each possible graphic applica
tion. After an extensive evaluation, the BALLOTS
Project and the Stanford Computation Center selected
,the Sanders 804 programmable terminal. A major
consideration in picking the Sanders unit was that the
unit itself is programmable (contains a minicomputer)
which allows it to meet the requirements of library
automation. Thus it will become one of the Campus
Facility's standard CRT's for video display.
The Sanders 804, pictured in center, shows a
bibliographic record which has been retrieved from the
BALLOTS-MARC file. Note that the record looks
similar to a printed Library of Congress card.

Ihe traditional format was maintained because of its
familiarity to the library staff and public, and to stress
the continuity of bibliographic records, whether manual
or computerized. (Other reformatted versions arc avail
able only to the library staff for editing, input of new
records, or update.)
A simple command language enables anyone, after a
brief instructional session, to enter simple searches for
material in the MARC file. As implementation proceeds,
other files will be accessible to the same kinds of search
commands. Here is an example of what an easy search
might look like:
find author commoner and title circle
After a little experience, the searcher learns to work
with abbreviated commands, and inputs:
fin a commoner and t circle
If Barry Commoner's The Closing Circle is in the
MARC data base, its full bibliographic citation, format
ted like a Library of Congress catalog card, will appear
on the screen of the terminal.
In the event that a searcher obtains only one book
corresponding to his search criteria, the bibliographic
data for that one title is immediately displayed to him.
If more than one book satisfies the search request, the
number of titles found by the computer search is
displayed:
"RESULT: 15 books."
At this point a very significant and advanced feature
of the BALLOTS system can be called into action:
BALLOTS searches arc interactive and negotiable.
The searcher can either expand or contract the search
result, or have each of the citations displayed before him
in turn, one at a time, just as if he were leafing through
cards in a catalog.
Except that he won't be bumping shoulders with
other users, waiting for someone else to finish using a
tray, and more importantly, he will be able to conduct
his search from any unit of the library where a CRT
terminal is located.
BALLOTS impact on the Stanford academic community
The library automation program called BALLOTS is
designed to:

1. Increase the speed of making library materials
available to the public.
The computer will enable the library to acquire,
catalog, and process materials somewhat more rapidly
than is currently the case.
2. Speed and simplify book circulation procedures.
In this area, two major improvements can be
expected.
One is to make available, from any point on campus
where there is a Sanders terminal, information on the
present location of any particular book in the automated
tiles and its present circulation status, when it is due
back, whether it is being held for another borrower, and
whether it can be held for the present inquirer, including
notification of availability.
Another goal is to make circulation as close as
possible to being a self-service process, with the
attendant simplicity and speed that would derive there
from.
3. Enlarge the breadth and depth of access to local
bibliographic records by going beyond the limited access
points provided by manual card catalogs.

Searchers will no longer be confined to exact and full
author, title, or subject entry point-bibliographic
records will be findable from parts of the entries and the
sequence of terms will no longer be so important.
4. Spread access to the bibliographic record through
out the user community by making it available wherever
a terminal is located.
It should be possible from any terminal on campus
for any student, professor, or staff member with a
budget account to find out what is in the automated
library system and what material is on order.
Information should cover Meyer Library as well as all
material newly processed by BALLOTS for the Main
Library system, all major branches which have
catalogued collections, and all of the Coordinate Li
braries that implement the system.
5. Facilitate eventual access to national and regional
data bases.
Toward the end of the 1975-79 period, it is to be
hoped that there will be economical ways of accessing
rather large data bases that are presently being developed
or are proposed for early development.
. This may include in machine-readable form the
800,000 entry catalog of recently acquired books in the
University of California library system, the Library of
Congress' National Union Catalog, the California State
Library Union Catalog, and the New York Times Data
Bank.
6. In conjunction with other systems, such as SPIRES,
begin to provide special bibliographic services to mem
bers of the academic community.
These special services will include the preparation of
"demand bibliographies," and the possible servicing of
data archives, such as opinion polls, U.S. census data,
and the like.
7. Contribute to deescalation of library costs.
This will be accomplished by assigning to the com
puter repetitive tasks, such as sorting, formatting,
printing, arranging, selecting, and otherwise mani
pulating or maintaining a bibliographic record. Slowing
down of library cost rises will lead to operating costs
lower than manual projections by the beginning of the
next decade.
The Library of Congress has begun a new and
significant program for libiary users. Designated CIP (for
Cataloging In Publication), this program makes biblio
graphic data on new books available almost immediately,
often before publication. CIP information is included in
the regular MARC Distribution Service, and is available
on BALLOTS files.
A special computerized searching facility in
BALLOTS-the Standing Search Request-will search all
MARC entries, including CIP information, as tapes come
in from Washington each week. If a specific search has
not made a hit, the Library can request the BALLOTS
system to continue searching the incoming tapes each
week for a pre-set number ol weeks.
Library staff will no longer have to waste time
repeatedly looking for cataloging information, and
bibliographic information and books will be available to
potential library users more rapidly than is possible in
the manual system.

guage books and late in the current fiscal year will be
extended to French titles, to be followed by titles in
other romance languages and in German.
The MARC tapes form one of the foundations of the
BALLOTS system. But BALLOTS also will permit
libraries at Stanford to create their own bibliographic
records for items not yet represented in the MARC
service. Machine readable bibliographic records from
MARC now make it possible for staff of the Stanford
Libraries to:
1. Search the files for information on a book,
whether the information is known precisely or
imprecisely.
2. Create purchase orders for books without the
requirement to retype the data.
3. Have the computer print catalog cards without the
requirement for any further typing or
proofreading.

(This space paid for by News and Publications)
4. Sort the cards by computer (before they are*
printed), resulting in the saving of the human labor
which would otherwise be necessary to sort the
close to one million cards prepared each year at
Stanford.
5. Notify interested library patrons that requested
books have arrived and are available for use.
These are just a few of the major activities which
Project BALLOTS now performs.
Computer access will, however, allow the user of the
Meyer Library to determine whether the Meyer Library
has the book and whether it is on the shelf. It thus
provides a more up-to-date inventory than found in the
printed catalog which is now cumulated every other year
and provided with quarterly supplements.
There are many others, such as preparing spine labels
which permits books to be identified and shelved
together in the stacks, gathering statistics, and upgrading
or otherwise editing existing bibliographic data. In the
near future the system will provide the capability to post
and update control files applicable to ordered items
(such as change of titles, delay in publication, etc.).
BALLOTS: An advanced, on-line facility
Research and development into computer applica
tions has been under way in North American research
libraries for two decades and especially during the last
seven years. Most of the applications have been to
circulation and technical processes, while nearly all have
relied upon the conventional batch processing com
puting environment. t
The BALLOTS system now becoming operational at
Stanford is substantially different from these earlier
efforts.
Since its inception BALLOTS has been oriented
toward on-line data processing, an approach which is
being found increasingly practical by other library
systems as well. BALLOTS employs technology and
software far more complex than that required for batch
operations. The complexity of on-line operations in
comparison with batch (or "off-line") operations tor the
bibliographic work done at Stanford has been estimated
to range from 10 to 50 times greater.
The development of an on-line system is possible only
in a computer environment characterized by great
intellectual strength and extensive experience. The Stan
ford University Libraries are fortunate to be able to
work in a university environment characterized by this
competence and degree of excellence.
Basically, an on-line system permits a transaction to
be conducted and brought to a relatively immediate
conclusion, whereas a batch system requires all transac
tions to be deferred (i.e., batched) for a processing job in
the computer and its printer.
The Library is a very transaction-oriented system. At
Stanford the total number of transactions of all types is
about 2,000,000 per year, or an average of about 8,000
each day.
When a library transaction is being conducted, the
patron or the staff member usually needs an immediate,
or at least a rapid, response. When a student or faculty
member cannot find a desired book on the shelf, he
wants to know now whether it is charged to some other
user-not tomorrow or next week.
When an acquisition librarian receives a book pur
chase request, he has to know at once whether the book
has already been ordered—not a week or a day later.
Thus, the library operation is typically an on-line
manual system. The availability of on-line expertise at
Stanford plus the possibility of obtaining external giant
monies to fund development work combined to in
fluence the direction of the development effort toward
an advanced, on-line facility. (See accompanying story
on The people-andprograms-behind BALLOTS.)
What BALLOTS will do for the library staff and users
One way to envision what BALLOTS will do is to
look at some of the limitations of current manual
systems. Take book circulation, for instance.
At present, Stanford library users must write their
names, addresses, and all the book information onto a
card for each book they desire to charge out. The charge
card is in two parts—one goes with the book and the
other is filed by call number so the location ol each
book can be known.
This system obviously has two inconveniences: one
for the patron and one for the library staff. Much of the
patron's time is consumed writing repetitive information
which could easily be recorded by data collection
devices and machine-readable identification cards, one
for the book and one for the patron.
Much staff time is consumed arranging and filing
charge cards and the work is subject to human error.
Furthermore, in the manual system, in order to find out
which books are overdue, one must run through the
whole file even including cards for books which are not
overdue.
Book purchasing is another area of potential change
through automation. When a book is recommended for
purchase, very often the exact title is not known, the
author's name may be incomplete or misspelled, or
authorship may even be attributed to the wrong organi
zation or person.
The control file for books on order contains a few
tens of thousands of copies of purchase orders; these
copies are on 3"x5" slips, which makes them difficult to
search and hard to maintain in file.
It is economically prohibitive in a manual system to
maintain outstanding order files in several sequences to
account for variations. Typically, a copy of a purchase
order is filed in only one location in the file; therefore,
the required information on an ordered title can be
found in only one place in the file.
Furthermore, the file itself is available in only one
location a serious geographic limitation to the flow of
bibliographic information in the academic community.
Consider next the problem of searching for a book in
a manual file such as a conventional card catalog.
The typical card catalog is arranged in "dictionary"
form, with authors, titles, subjects, and corporate bodies
all interfiled in one alphabet. Suppose, as is not
unreasonable, that a library user or staff member needs
to search for an item under several different access
points simultaneously. Let us say he wants to find works
on the recycling of solid wastes and the generation of
electric power. Practically speaking, he cannot do this in
the card catalog, because it is basically a single access
file.
Only with very great inconvenience to himself (and
others) and with greatly diminished response time is it
possible for a user to conduct a "coordinated search" in
a manual file. Most users would despair at the thought of
such a laborious and cumbersome task. Yet the com
puter otters the opportunity of conducting such multi
ple access searches easily, conveniently, and quickly
thus enlarging greatly the user's power to retrieve
citations from the file.
Beyond the immediate benefits to the Library staff,
the University intends to make its public bibliographic
files available to the community at the earliest possible
date. The BALLOTS-MARC file, consisting of Library of
Congress MARC records, is now searchable via SHIRES
from any terminal on campus, including typewriter
terminals. The same searching language used by the
library for staff searching is available to the public.
How BALLOTS will look to users
Librarians have labored long under the limitations of
files which have been available in only one place. A
requirement of an automated library system, therefore,
is extension of file access beyond the confines of one
room, one building, or even one campus.
Fortunately, the computer terminal is a device which
readily permits this multiplication of file access. Com
puter video terminals (CRT's) themselves have been
evolving actively only for the past decade. Development
work has been carried out with typewriter terminals, like
the IBM 2741, in order to gain experience, test the
feasibility of multiple access searching software, and, of
course, to write and debug systems and applications
programs.
But it was obvious that the typewriter terminal could
never be satisfactorily used in a production library
environment—it was much too slow and noisy for the
heavy duty use and rapid response the library staff
needed from large bibliographic files, even though its
merit for low volume use was recognized.
The video display terminal or CRT seemed ideal for
the library's purpose, but it was not until last year that
enough choice of reliable terminals was available from
manufacturers so that / terminal could actually be
chosen for BALLOTS.
It was felt that Stanford could not afford a
customized terminal for each possible graphic applica
tion. After an extensive evaluation, the BALLOTS
Project and the Stanford Computation Center selected
,the Sanders 804 programmable terminal. A major
consideration in picking the Sanders unit was that the
unit itself is programmable (contains a minicomputer)
which allows it to meet the requirements of library
automation. Thus it will become one of the Campus
Facility's standard CRT's for video display.
The Sanders 804, pictured in center, shows a
bibliographic record which has been retrieved from the
BALLOTS-MARC file. Note that the record looks
similar to a printed Library of Congress card.

Ihe traditional format was maintained because of its
familiarity to the library staff and public, and to stress
the continuity of bibliographic records, whether manual
or computerized. (Other reformatted versions arc avail
able only to the library staff for editing, input of new
records, or update.)
A simple command language enables anyone, after a
brief instructional session, to enter simple searches for
material in the MARC file. As implementation proceeds,
other files will be accessible to the same kinds of search
commands. Here is an example of what an easy search
might look like:
find author commoner and title circle
After a little experience, the searcher learns to work
with abbreviated commands, and inputs:
fin a commoner and t circle
If Barry Commoner's The Closing Circle is in the
MARC data base, its full bibliographic citation, format
ted like a Library of Congress catalog card, will appear
on the screen of the terminal.
In the event that a searcher obtains only one book
corresponding to his search criteria, the bibliographic
data for that one title is immediately displayed to him.
If more than one book satisfies the search request, the
number of titles found by the computer search is
displayed:
"RESULT: 15 books."
At this point a very significant and advanced feature
of the BALLOTS system can be called into action:
BALLOTS searches arc interactive and negotiable.
The searcher can either expand or contract the search
result, or have each of the citations displayed before him
in turn, one at a time, just as if he were leafing through
cards in a catalog.
Except that he won't be bumping shoulders with
other users, waiting for someone else to finish using a
tray, and more importantly, he will be able to conduct
his search from any unit of the library where a CRT
terminal is located.
BALLOTS impact on the Stanford academic community
The library automation program called BALLOTS is
designed to:

1. Increase the speed of making library materials
available to the public.
The computer will enable the library to acquire,
catalog, and process materials somewhat more rapidly
than is currently the case.
2. Speed and simplify book circulation procedures.
In this area, two major improvements can be
expected.
One is to make available, from any point on campus
where there is a Sanders terminal, information on the
present location of any particular book in the automated
tiles and its present circulation status, when it is due
back, whether it is being held for another borrower, and
whether it can be held for the present inquirer, including
notification of availability.
Another goal is to make circulation as close as
possible to being a self-service process, with the
attendant simplicity and speed that would derive there
from.
3. Enlarge the breadth and depth of access to local
bibliographic records by going beyond the limited access
points provided by manual card catalogs.

Searchers will no longer be confined to exact and full
author, title, or subject entry point-bibliographic
records will be findable from parts of the entries and the
sequence of terms will no longer be so important.
4. Spread access to the bibliographic record through
out the user community by making it available wherever
a terminal is located.
It should be possible from any terminal on campus
for any student, professor, or staff member with a
budget account to find out what is in the automated
library system and what material is on order.
Information should cover Meyer Library as well as all
material newly processed by BALLOTS for the Main
Library system, all major branches which have
catalogued collections, and all of the Coordinate Li
braries that implement the system.
5. Facilitate eventual access to national and regional
data bases.
Toward the end of the 1975-79 period, it is to be
hoped that there will be economical ways of accessing
rather large data bases that are presently being developed
or are proposed for early development.
. This may include in machine-readable form the
800,000 entry catalog of recently acquired books in the
University of California library system, the Library of
Congress' National Union Catalog, the California State
Library Union Catalog, and the New York Times Data
Bank.
6. In conjunction with other systems, such as SPIRES,
begin to provide special bibliographic services to mem
bers of the academic community.
These special services will include the preparation of
"demand bibliographies," and the possible servicing of
data archives, such as opinion polls, U.S. census data,
and the like.
7. Contribute to deescalation of library costs.
This will be accomplished by assigning to the com
puter repetitive tasks, such as sorting, formatting,
printing, arranging, selecting, and otherwise mani
pulating or maintaining a bibliographic record. Slowing
down of library cost rises will lead to operating costs
lower than manual projections by the beginning of the
next decade.
The Library of Congress has begun a new and
significant program for libiary users. Designated CIP (for
Cataloging In Publication), this program makes biblio
graphic data on new books available almost immediately,
often before publication. CIP information is included in
the regular MARC Distribution Service, and is available
on BALLOTS files.
A special computerized searching facility in
BALLOTS-the Standing Search Request-will search all
MARC entries, including CIP information, as tapes come
in from Washington each week. If a specific search has
not made a hit, the Library can request the BALLOTS
system to continue searching the incoming tapes each
week for a pre-set number ol weeks.
Library staff will no longer have to waste time
repeatedly looking for cataloging information, and
bibliographic information and books will be available to
potential library users more rapidly than is possible in
the manual system.

the University Libraries staff.
Why libraries need computers
The "information explosion" which universities have
helped create in recent decades has inundated libraries
and research centers with so many new publications that
traditional manual systems are becoming increasingly
unable to handle the load.
Libraries are in large measure still using many of the
basic techniques devised over the last 2,600 years. These
techniques were considered moderately adequate until
the Second World War. But library systems now are
inconvenient of access, slow in response, difficult to use,
frustrating in complexity, and unresponsive to changing
needs.
Problem of huge files
Files have grown so large that they are virtually
becoming unmanageable and many libraries have
seriously considered ceasing to add to their card catalogs
and starting afresh for new acquisitions with some
degree of automation.
* Ohio State University has announced that its card
catalog will be closed and replaced by computer-oriented
bibliographic services in 1976.
* The Library of Congress has predicted that, at the
present rate of growth, by 1980 its own public catalog
will contain some 32,000,000 cards—a tile so vast that
its manageability is questionable.
* Even at Stanford, which is the nation's eighth
largest research library, the various catalogs available to
the public are estimated to contain some ten million
cards.
To create this major bibliographic tool-key to the
millions of bibliographic units at Stanford—requires
many formalized activities and functions which are
routine and which do not require interpretive, scholarly,
or qualitative judgments. Many of these lunctions are
almost ideally suited to machine processing.
More cost, less service
Constantly rising costs are another factor in the
libraries' desire to turn to computers. Labor costs go up
5 to 6 percent each year, whereas the cost of computer
transactions goes up at only half that rate.
It is thus clear that at some point in the future the
University should be paying increasingly less for library
services under a machine system than if it stuck with thu
tried and tested manual process with its ever increasing
complexities and frustrations.
And at the same time a machine system is a more
powerful instrument for giving full, very precise, and
more rapid access to local and national library resources.
Library collections double in size about every 16
years. Even in periods of social unrest or economic
dislocation, the spiral of publishing and communication
activity continues upwards.
Unfortunately, when a library doubles in size, the
effort required to maintain an equivalent level of service
more than doubles-and therein lies the rub.
The large research library at times seems to resemble
a dinosaur or a book museum. In the one instance, it is
slow and ponderous, not terribly adaptive or responsive
to changes in environment. In the other, it grows and
accumulates material relentlessly~yct the adequacy of
its services diminishes as it increases in size because it is
so difficult to access anything within a reasonable time.
Modernization and service improvement needed
The situation may be aggravated by the apparent
increase of interest in interdisciplinary or multidiscipli
nary studies which runs counter to pressures for physical
decentralization of libraries. The scholar in urban prob
lems has to shuttle between the Main Library, the Law
Library, the Jackson Library of Business, and perhaps
the Engineering and Art libraries.
If lie is unable to determine from some central place
(or better yet, from his own office, department, or
laboratory) whether one library or another possesses a
book and also whether that book is available for use, he
may give up in all but the most pressing searches.
In frustration, potential library users may turn to
other services or devices for their information needs—
perhaps building a personal library, long distance tele
phone conversations with colleagues, costly and time
consuming conferences, purchase of commercial inform
ation service, or the multiplication of branch libraries.
Students, and particularly graduate students, research
staff and faculty are now increasingly critical of the
ability of libraries to respond to current needs. Yet the
library is still a major and essential component in a huge
network of information processing; it too must be
brought into the 20th century.
Efforts to make this change at Stanford began more
than six years ago in the Stanford library automation
project. Involving 100 people and nearly $2 million to
date, it is called Project BALLOTS-for Bibliographic
Automation of Large Library Operations using a Time
sharing System. One ot the most advanced library
automation projects in the country, it still will require
several more years to complete. (See table.)
What BALLOTS can do for you
Computer terminals will aid you in 1973 and later
years to borrow books, search for publications you need,
determine what the library has on a subject for your
interest, and determine if a bibliographic citation that
interests you is now in the Stanford Library and if so,
where it is and whether it is in use.
This effort is the result of computer programs written
to operate television-like terminals that arc now in the
Main Library and will be added in Meyer and other
major library branches in the course of the next two to
four years. (Any typewriter terminal on campus can
already search the BALLOTS-MARC file, which consists
of current Library of Congress catalog data.)
The library staff will be able to help you with your
searches during 1973-4; it is expected that public use of
the TV-like terminals may start as early as 1974.

How BALLOTS works
Using terminals with cathode ray tubes, popularly
called "CRT's," library staff now conducts searches of
bibliographic files, enters commands and tells the com
puter to format data for purchase orders, sort the orders
alphabetically by vendor, and print them overnight.
The computer will also print messages notifying
faculty or student requesters that their materials have
arrived. Search commands will find Library of Congress
bibliographic data if available, and if not available, will
eventually enable the staff to create their own data on
the spot.
Similarly, commands entered at the terminal will
instruct the computer to properly format desired biblio
graphic data, sort it in batches for the main and
departmental libraries, and within each batch, print out
the complete set of library cards already sorted in
correct alphabetical filing sequence.
The magnitude of this operation is appreciated when
it is realized that the typical large research library
prepares between half a million and a million cards each
year—a job which in the manual system is not very
interesting and is susceptible to error.
In circulation, data collection devices and machine
readable identification cards will speed circulation tran
sactions and virtually eliminate the nuisance of filling
out charge cards by hand.
In summary the system will aid processing of roman
alphabet material acquired, and items the catalog listing
of which can be transliterated. There will be a consider
able time period before a sufficiently large fraction of
the library's holdings is contained in machine-readable
fdes to make automatic search rewarding to the general
user.
This time varies depending upon discipline. In the
sciences, it might be as short as two to five years. In the
humanities perhaps as much as 30 to 50 years, or until
such time as technological breakthroughs provide in
expensive, reliable conversion to machine-readable form
of massive bibliographic files-a prospect which docs not
seem imminent at this writing.
Unfortunately, a majority of the use of the library by
scientists involves the search for journal articles and
these will not be included in the initial implementation
of the system because of the expense of buying and
processing machine-readable data bases.
Typically, lists in machine-readable form for journal
citations covering a broad subject cost from
$10,000-25,000 each year, more than that to store
locally, and still more to convert them to internal

machine formats like SPIRES so that they can be run
against search programs. (SPIRES—the Stanford Public
Information REtrieval System-is a computer-based,
generalized information system. See Campus Report
Oct. 11, 1972 p. 1-2.)
Thus from the point of view of general patron search
of the library catalog, we must consider that BALLOTS
piovides a benefit of increasing utility over a period of
years.
The Meyer Library represents an exception in that all
its holdings (except journalarticles) will included in
the on-line catalog. The Meyer catalog is now printed,
bound, and distributed in book form to several locations
on campus.
Computer applications in bibliographic data
In 1965, the Library of Congress started a develop
ment program to apply computer technology to the
creation and distribution of its large pool of biblio
graphic data.
Known as the MARC Project (Machine Readable
Cataloging), this effort eventually resulted in establish
ment of a national and international standard for
creating magnetic tapes containing all the information
normally found on printed Library of Congress cards
cards which form the backbone of the cataloging system
in nearly every major research library in North America.
For several years now the Library of Congress has
been distributing weekly magnetic tapes containing
machine readable bibliographic records for currently
catalogued books. The service began with English lan
guage books and late in the current fiscal year will be
extended to French titles, to be followed by titles in
other romance languages and in German.
The MARC tapes form one of the foundations of the
BALLOTS system. But BALLOTS also will permit
libraries at Stanford to create their own bibliographic
records for items not yet represented in the MARC
service. Machine readable bibliographic records from
MARC now make it possible for staff of the Stanford
Libraries to:
1. Search the files for information on a book,
whether the information is known precisely or
imprecisely.
2. Create purchase orders for books without the

3. Have the computer print catalog cards without the
requirement for any further typing or
proofreading.

4. Sort the cards by computer (before they are*
printed), resulting in the saving of the human labor
which would otherwise be necessary to sort the
close to one million cards prepared each year at
Stanford.
5. Notify interested library patrons that requested
books have arrived and are available for use.
These are just a few of the major activities which
Project BALLOTS now performs.
Computer access will, however, allow the user of the
Meyer Library to determine whether the Meyer Library
has the book and whether it is on the shelf. It thus
provides a more up-to-date inventory than found in the
printed catalog which is now cumulated every other year
and provided with quarterly supplements.
There are many others, such as preparing spine labels
which permits books to be identified and shelved

automation. Thus it will become one of the Campus
Facility's standard CRT's for video display.
The Sanders 804, pictured in center, shows a
bibliographic record which has been retrieved from the
BALLOTS-MARC file. Note that the record looks
similar to a printed Library of Congress card.

Ihe traditional format was maintained because of its
familiarity to the library staff and public, and to stress
the continuity of bibliographic records, whether manual
or computerized. (Other reformatted versions arc avail
able only to the library staff for editing, input of new
records, or update.)
A simple command language enables anyone, after a
brief instructional session, to enter simple searches for
material in the MARC file. As implementation proceeds,
other files will be accessible to the same kinds of search
commands. Here is an example of what an easy search
might look like:
find author commoner and title circle
After a little experience, the searcher learns to work
with abbreviated commands, and inputs:
fin a commoner and t circle
If Barry Commoner's The Closing Circle is in the
MARC data base, its full bibliographic citation, format
ted like a Library of Congress catalog card, will appear
on the screen of the terminal.
In the event that a searcher obtains only one book
corresponding to his search criteria, the bibliographic
data for that one title is immediately displayed to him.
If more than one book satisfies the search request, the
number of titles found by the computer search is
displayed:
"RESULT: 15 books."
At this point a very significant and advanced feature
of the BALLOTS system can be called into action:
BALLOTS searches arc interactive and negotiable.
The searcher can either expand or contract the search
result, or have each of the citations displayed before him
in turn, one at a time, just as if he were leafing through
cards in a catalog.
Except that he won't be bumping shoulders with
other users, waiting for someone else to finish using a
tray, and more importantly, he will be able to conduct
his search from any unit of the library where a CRT
terminal is located.
BALLOTS impact on the Stanford academic community
The library automation program called BALLOTS is
designed to:

1. Increase the speed of making library materials
available to the public.
The computer will enable the library to acquire,
catalog, and process materials somewhat more rapidly
than is currently the case.
2. Speed and simplify book circulation procedures.
In this area, two major improvements can be
expected.
One is to make available, from any point on campus
where there is a Sanders terminal, information on the
present location of any particular book in the automated
tiles and its present circulation status, when it is due
back, whether it is being held for another borrower, and
whether it can be held for the present inquirer, including
notification of availability.
Another goal is to make circulation as close as
possible to being a self-service process, with the
attendant simplicity and speed that would derive there
from.
3. Enlarge the breadth and depth of access to local
bibliographic records by going beyond the limited access
points provided by manual card catalogs.

Searchers will no longer be confined to exact and full
author, title, or subject entry point-bibliographic
records will be findable from parts of the entries and the
sequence of terms will no longer be so important.
4. Spread access to the bibliographic record through
out the user community by making it available wherever
a terminal is located.
It should be possible from any terminal on campus
for any student, professor, or staff member with a
budget account to find out what is in the automated
library system and what material is on order.
Information should cover Meyer Library as well as all
material newly processed by BALLOTS for the Main
Library system, all major branches which have
catalogued collections, and all of the Coordinate Li
braries that implement the system.
5. Facilitate eventual access to national and regional
data bases.
Toward the end of the 1975-79 period, it is to be
hoped that there will be economical ways of accessing
rather large data bases that are presently being developed
or are proposed for early development.
. This may include in machine-readable form the
800,000 entry catalog of recently acquired books in the
University of California library system, the Library of
Congress' National Union Catalog, the California State
Library Union Catalog, and the New York Times Data
Bank.
6. In conjunction with other systems, such as SPIRES,
begin to provide special bibliographic services to mem
bers of the academic community.
These special services will include the preparation of
"demand bibliographies," and the possible servicing of
data archives, such as opinion polls, U.S. census data,
and the like.
7. Contribute to deescalation of library costs.
This will be accomplished by assigning to the com
puter repetitive tasks, such as sorting, formatting,
printing, arranging, selecting, and otherwise mani
pulating or maintaining a bibliographic record. Slowing
down of library cost rises will lead to operating costs
lower than manual projections by the beginning of the
next decade.
The Library of Congress has begun a new and
significant program for libiary users. Designated CIP (for
Cataloging In Publication), this program makes biblio
graphic data on new books available almost immediately,
often before publication. CIP information is included in
the regular MARC Distribution Service, and is available
on BALLOTS files.
A special computerized searching facility in
BALLOTS-the Standing Search Request-will search all
MARC entries, including CIP information, as tapes come
in from Washington each week. If a specific search has
not made a hit, the Library can request the BALLOTS
system to continue searching the incoming tapes each
week for a pre-set number ol weeks.
Library staff will no longer have to waste time
repeatedly looking for cataloging information, and
bibliographic information and books will be available to
potential library users more rapidly than is possible in
the manual system.
