# Library Automation At Stanford: Progress Report

### 
Fallowing is a report to the community on Project
BALLOTS by David C. Weber and Allen B. Veaner of
the University Libraries staff.
Why libraries need computers
The "information explosion" which universities have
helped create in recent decades has inundated libraries
and research centers with so many new publications that
traditional manual systems are becoming increasingly
unable to handle the load.
Libraries are in large measure still using many of the
basic techniques devised over the last 2,600 years. These
techniques were considered moderately adequate until
the Second World War. But library systems now are
inconvenient of access, slow in response, difficult to use,
frustrating in complexity, and unresponsive to changing
needs.
Problem of huge files
Files have grown so large that they are virtually
becoming unmanageable and many libraries have
seriously considered ceasing to add to their card catalogs
and starting afresh for new acquisitions with some
degree of automation.
* Ohio State University has announced that its card
catalog will be closed and replaced by computer-oriented
bibliographic services in 1976.
* The Library of Congress has predicted that, at the
present rate of growth, by 1980 its own public catalog
will contain some 32,000,000 cards—a tile so vast that
its manageability is questionable.
* Even at Stanford, which is the nation's eighth
largest research library, the various catalogs available to
the public are estimated to contain some ten million
cards.
To create this major bibliographic tool-key to the
millions of bibliographic units at Stanford—requires
many formalized activities and functions which are
routine and which do not require interpretive, scholarly,
or qualitative judgments. Many of these lunctions are
almost ideally suited to machine processing.
More cost, less service
Constantly rising costs are another factor in the
libraries' desire to turn to computers. Labor costs go up
5 to 6 percent each year, whereas the cost of computer
transactions goes up at only half that rate.
It is thus clear that at some point in the future the
University should be paying increasingly less for library
services under a machine system than if it stuck with thu
tried and tested manual process with its ever increasing
complexities and frustrations.
And at the same time a machine system is a more
powerful instrument for giving full, very precise, and
more rapid access to local and national library resources.
Library collections double in size about every 16
years. Even in periods of social unrest or economic
dislocation, the spiral of publishing and communication
activity continues upwards.
Unfortunately, when a library doubles in size, the
effort required to maintain an equivalent level of service
more than doubles-and therein lies the rub.
The large research library at times seems to resemble
a dinosaur or a book museum. In the one instance, it is
slow and ponderous, not terribly adaptive or responsive
to changes in environment. In the other, it grows and
accumulates material relentlessly~yct the adequacy of
its services diminishes as it increases in size because it is
so difficult to access anything within a reasonable time.
Modernization and service improvement needed
The situation may be aggravated by the apparent
increase of interest in interdisciplinary or multidiscipli
nary studies which runs counter to pressures for physical
decentralization of libraries. The scholar in urban prob
lems has to shuttle between the Main Library, the Law
Library, the Jackson Library of Business, and perhaps
the Engineering and Art libraries.
If lie is unable to determine from some central place
(or better yet, from his own office, department, or
laboratory) whether one library or another possesses a
book and also whether that book is available for use, he
may give up in all but the most pressing searches.
In frustration, potential library users may turn to
other services or devices for their information needs—
perhaps building a personal library, long distance tele
phone conversations with colleagues, costly and time
consuming conferences, purchase of commercial inform
ation service, or the multiplication of branch libraries.
Students, and particularly graduate students, research
staff and faculty are now increasingly critical of the
ability of libraries to respond to current needs. Yet the
library is still a major and essential component in a huge
network of information processing; it too must be
brought into the 20th century.
Efforts to make this change at Stanford began more
than six years ago in the Stanford library automation
project. Involving 100 people and nearly $2 million to
date, it is called Project BALLOTS-for Bibliographic
Automation of Large Library Operations using a Time
sharing System. One ot the most advanced library
automation projects in the country, it still will require
several more years to complete. (See table.)
What BALLOTS can do for you
Computer terminals will aid you in 1973 and later
years to borrow books, search for publications you need,
determine what the library has on a subject for your
interest, and determine if a bibliographic citation that
interests you is now in the Stanford Library and if so,
where it is and whether it is in use.
This effort is the result of computer programs written
to operate television-like terminals that arc now in the
Main Library and will be added in Meyer and other
major library branches in the course of the next two to
four years. (Any typewriter terminal on campus can
already search the BALLOTS-MARC file, which consists
of current Library of Congress catalog data.)
The library staff will be able to help you with your
searches during 1973-4; it is expected that public use of
the TV-like terminals may start as early as 1974.

How BALLOTS works
Using terminals with cathode ray tubes, popularly
called "CRT's," library staff now conducts searches of
bibliographic files, enters commands and tells the com
puter to format data for purchase orders, sort the orders
alphabetically by vendor, and print them overnight.
The computer will also print messages notifying
faculty or student requesters that their materials have
arrived. Search commands will find Library of Congress
bibliographic data if available, and if not available, will
eventually enable the staff to create their own data on
the spot.
Similarly, commands entered at the terminal will
instruct the computer to properly format desired biblio
graphic data, sort it in batches for the main and
departmental libraries, and within each batch, print out
the complete set of library cards already sorted in
correct alphabetical filing sequence.
The magnitude of this operation is appreciated when
it is realized that the typical large research library
prepares between half a million and a million cards each
year—a job which in the manual system is not very
interesting and is susceptible to error.
In circulation, data collection devices and machine
readable identification cards will speed circulation tran
sactions and virtually eliminate the nuisance of filling
out charge cards by hand.
In summary the system will aid processing of roman
alphabet material acquired, and items the catalog listing
of which can be transliterated. There will be a consider
able time period before a sufficiently large fraction of
the library's holdings is contained in machine-readable
fdes to make automatic search rewarding to the general
user.
This time varies depending upon discipline. In the
sciences, it might be as short as two to five years. In the
humanities perhaps as much as 30 to 50 years, or until
such time as technological breakthroughs provide in
expensive, reliable conversion to machine-readable form
of massive bibliographic files-a prospect which docs not
seem imminent at this writing.
Unfortunately, a majority of the use of the library by
scientists involves the search for journal articles and
these will not be included in the initial implementation
of the system because of the expense of buying and
processing machine-readable data bases.
Typically, lists in machine-readable form for journal
citations covering a broad subject cost from
$10,000-25,000 each year, more than that to store
locally, and still more to convert them to internal

machine formats like SPIRES so that they can be run
against search programs. (SPIRES—the Stanford Public
Information REtrieval System-is a computer-based,
generalized information system. See Campus Report
Oct. 11, 1972 p. 1-2.)
Thus from the point of view of general patron search
of the library catalog, we must consider that BALLOTS
piovides a benefit of increasing utility over a period of
years.
The Meyer Library represents an exception in that all
its holdings (except journalarticles) will included in
the on-line catalog. The Meyer catalog is now printed,
bound, and distributed in book form to several locations
on campus.
Computer applications in bibliographic data
In 1965, the Library of Congress started a develop
ment program to apply computer technology to the
creation and distribution of its large pool of biblio
graphic data.
Known as the MARC Project (Machine Readable
Cataloging), this effort eventually resulted in establish
ment of a national and international standard for
creating magnetic tapes containing all the information
normally found on printed Library of Congress cards
cards which form the backbone of the cataloging system
in nearly every major research library in North America.
For several years now the Library of Congress has
been distributing weekly magnetic tapes containing
machine readable bibliographic records for currently
catalogued books. The service began with English lan
guage books and late in the current fiscal year will be
extended to French titles, to be followed by titles in
other romance languages and in German.
The MARC tapes form one of the foundations of the
BALLOTS system. But BALLOTS also will permit
libraries at Stanford to create their own bibliographic
records for items not yet represented in the MARC
service. Machine readable bibliographic records from
MARC now make it possible for staff of the Stanford
Libraries to:
1. Search the files for information on a book,
whether the information is known precisely or
imprecisely.
2. Create purchase orders for books without the
requirement to retype the data.
3. Have the computer print catalog cards without the
requirement for any further typing or
proofreading.

(This space paid for by News and Publications)
4. Sort the cards by computer (before they are*
printed), resulting in the saving of the human labor
which would otherwise be necessary to sort the
close to one million cards prepared each year at
Stanford.
5. Notify interested library patrons that requested
books have arrived and are available for use.
These are just a few of the major activities which
Project BALLOTS now performs.
Computer access will, however, allow the user of the
Meyer Library to determine whether the Meyer Library
has the book and whether it is on the shelf. It thus
provides a more up-to-date inventory than found in the
printed catalog which is now cumulated every other year
and provided with quarterly supplements.
There are many others, such as preparing spine labels
which permits books to be identified and shelved
together in the stacks, gathering statistics, and upgrading
or otherwise editing existing bibliographic data. In the
near future the system will provide the capability to post
and update control files applicable to ordered items
(such as change of titles, delay in publication, etc.).
BALLOTS: An advanced, on-line facility
Research and development into computer applica
tions has been under way in North American research
libraries for two decades and especially during the last
seven years. Most of the applications have been to
circulation and technical processes, while nearly all have
relied upon the conventional batch processing com
puting environment. t
The BALLOTS system now becoming operational at
Stanford is substantially different from these earlier
efforts.
Since its inception BALLOTS has been oriented
toward on-line data processing, an approach which is
being found increasingly practical by other library
systems as well. BALLOTS employs technology and
software far more complex than that required for batch
operations. The complexity of on-line operations in
comparison with batch (or "off-line") operations tor the
bibliographic work done at Stanford has been estimated
to range from 10 to 50 times greater.
The development of an on-line system is possible only
in a computer environment characterized by great
intellectual strength and extensive experience. The Stan
ford University Libraries are fortunate to be able to
work in a university environment characterized by this
competence and degree of excellence.
Basically, an on-line system permits a transaction to
be conducted and brought to a relatively immediate
conclusion, whereas a batch system requires all transac
tions to be deferred (i.e., batched) for a processing job in
the computer and its printer.
The Library is a very transaction-oriented system. At
Stanford the total number of transactions of all types is
about 2,000,000 per year, or an average of about 8,000
each day.
When a library transaction is being conducted, the
patron or the staff member usually needs an immediate,
or at least a rapid, response. When a student or faculty
member cannot find a desired book on the shelf, he
wants to know now whether it is charged to some other
user-not tomorrow or next week.
When an acquisition librarian receives a book pur
chase request, he has to know at once whether the book
has already been ordered—not a week or a day later.
Thus, the library operation is typically an on-line
manual system. The availability of on-line expertise at
Stanford plus the possibility of obtaining external giant
monies to fund development work combined to in
fluence the direction of the development effort toward
an advanced, on-line facility. (See accompanying story
on The people-andprograms-behind BALLOTS.)
What BALLOTS will do for the library staff and users
One way to envision what BALLOTS will do is to
look at some of the limitations of current manual
systems. Take book circulation, for instance.
At present, Stanford library users must write their
names, addresses, and all the book information onto a
card for each book they desire to charge out. The charge
card is in two parts—one goes with the book and the
other is filed by call number so the location ol each
book can be known.
This system obviously has two inconveniences: one
for the patron and one for the library staff. Much of the
patron's time is consumed writing repetitive information
which could easily be recorded by data collection
devices and machine-readable identification cards, one
for the book and one for the patron.
Much staff time is consumed arranging and filing
charge cards and the work is subject to human error.
Furthermore, in the manual system, in order to find out
which books are overdue, one must run through the
whole file even including cards for books which are not
overdue.
Book purchasing is another area of potential change
through automation. When a book is recommended for
purchase, very often the exact title is not known, the
author's name may be incomplete or misspelled, or
authorship may even be attributed to the wrong organi
zation or person.
The control file for books on order contains a few
tens of thousands of copies of purchase orders; these
copies are on 3"x5" slips, which makes them difficult to
search and hard to maintain in file.
It is economically prohibitive in a manual system to
maintain outstanding order files in several sequences to
account for variations. Typically, a copy of a purchase
order is filed in only one location in the file; therefore,
the required information on an ordered title can be
found in only one place in the file.
Furthermore, the file itself is available in only one
location a serious geographic limitation to the flow of
bibliographic information in the academic community.
Consider next the problem of searching for a book in
a manual file such as a conventional card catalog.
The typical card catalog is arranged in "dictionary"
form, with authors, titles, subjects, and corporate bodies
all interfiled in one alphabet. Suppose, as is not
unreasonable, that a library user or staff member needs
