# Pentagon Papers Witness Says Disclosure Could Have Assisted Foreign Intelligence
## 
### ED KOHN Special to the Daily 
LOS ANGELES — Another
high-ranking United States military
official testified yesterday that the
release of the "top secret," 18-volume
"Pentagon Papers" could have aided
intelligence analysts in foreign nations.
Brig. Gen. Paul F. Gorman, one of

the authors of the "Papers," testified
that the report could be "useful" to
intelligence officers and diplomats for
two reasons.
"They could augment intelligence
(reports) of a foreign nation and they
could influence international relations.
In the hands of another country, they
could be used to shape, direct or block

channels of international
communications," Gorman testified.
He told the jury that the "Papers"
could be useful for both purposes.
Gorman's testimony closely
paralleled that of Lt. Gen. William
Depuy, who testified last week that
the release of the "Papers" could have
aided North Vietnam in its preparation

for the highly successful April, 1972
offensive.
At that time, Depuy termed the
"Papers" "the best piece of
intelligence they ever had."
A soldior since 1945, Gorman is
presently stationed at Ft. Collins,
Colo. He served two tours in Vietnam
as an infantry commander, one with
the First Infantry Division and the
other with the 101st Airborne.
Gorman, who served for two years
as an American military aide at the
Paris peace talks, holds a master's
degree from Harvard University in
International Relations and served
briefly as an Asst. Professor of History
at West Point, his alma mater. He is
expected to testify for the remainder
of the week.
Daniel Ellsberg, 41, and Anthony J.
Russo Jr., 36, are charged with
conspiracy, theft of government
property and espionage for duplicating
and distributing copies of three "top
secret" Defense Department studies —
the "Papers," an eight-page segment of
a lengthy report written by
then-Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff Earle G. Wheeler, and a study of
the 1954 Geneva Convention written
by Defense Department employee
Melvin Gurtov.
If convicted on all charges, Ellsberg
