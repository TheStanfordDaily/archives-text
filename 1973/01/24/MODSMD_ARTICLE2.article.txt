# Pentagon Papers Witness Says Disclosure Could Have Assisted Foreign Intelligence
## 
### ED KOHN Special to the Daily 
LOS ANGELES — Another
high-ranking United States military
official testified yesterday that the
release of the "top secret," 18-volume
"Pentagon Papers" could have aided
intelligence analysts in foreign nations.
Brig. Gen. Paul F. Gorman, one of

the authors of the "Papers," testified
that the report could be "useful" to
intelligence officers and diplomats for
two reasons.
"They could augment intelligence
(reports) of a foreign nation and they
could influence international relations.
In the hands of another country, they
could be used to shape, direct or block

channels of international
communications," Gorman testified.
He told the jury that the "Papers"
could be useful for both purposes.
Gorman's testimony closely
paralleled that of Lt. Gen. William
Depuy, who testified last week that
the release of the "Papers" could have
aided North Vietnam in its preparation

for the highly successful April, 1972
offensive.
At that time, Depuy termed the
"Papers" "the best piece of
intelligence they ever had."
A soldior since 1945, Gorman is
presently stationed at Ft. Collins,
Colo. He served two tours in Vietnam
as an infantry commander, one with
the First Infantry Division and the
other with the 101st Airborne.
Gorman, who served for two years
as an American military aide at the
Paris peace talks, holds a master's
degree from Harvard University in
International Relations and served
briefly as an Asst. Professor of History
at West Point, his alma mater. He is
expected to testify for the remainder
of the week.
Daniel Ellsberg, 41, and Anthony J.
Russo Jr., 36, are charged with
conspiracy, theft of government
property and espionage for duplicating
and distributing copies of three "top
secret" Defense Department studies —
the "Papers," an eight-page segment of
a lengthy report written by
then-Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff Earle G. Wheeler, and a study of
the 1954 Geneva Convention written
by Defense Department employee
Melvin Gurtov.
If convicted on all charges, Ellsberg
could face a 115-year jail term, while
Russo could serve a 35-year sentence.
Prosecutor David Nissen questioned
Gorman extensively on the process by
which the "Papers" were researched,
written and compiled. Gorman told
the court that most of the reference
material for the "Papers" came from
"secret" or "top secret" documents
made available by the Secretary of
Defense's office, the Pentagon, the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, and other
government agencies and departments,
such as the Department of State.
After the jury was excused for the
day, a Defense Department attorney
who was sent back to Washington,
D.C. over the weekend to retrieve a
controversial Defense Department
study of the alleged damage caused by
the release of the "Papers," returned
to the witness stand.
Trial judge Matthew Byrne Jr.
closely questioned Frank A. Bartimo
about the study he brought to Los
Angeles, concluded that Bartimo
brought the wrong study, and ordered
Bartimo to produce the other study
this morning when the trial resumes.
Several members of the 10-woman,
two-man jury appear to be
overwhelmed by the mass of evidence

that has already been introduced in
the trial, and some appear to be
cat-napping while the courtroom lights
are dimmed so that they may view
overhead projections of segments of
the "Papers."
In another development, the
prosecution yesterday introduced into
evidence all 18 volumes of the
"Papers," which means that as soon as
a protective order covering the defense
is lifted, the four unpublished
"diplomatic" volumes will be available
for inspection by members of the press
and public.
