# The 						people—and programs—behind BALLOTS
## 
### 
The achievement of the BALLOTS Project
would have been impossible without the intellec
tual and creative resources of the BALLOTS staff,
including Glee Cady, Wayne Davison, Eleanor
Montague, and Madeleine Stovel performing the
systems analysis, Gilbert Chang, Donn Martin, and
Baxter Moyer developing the computer programs,
and Jennifer Hartzell responsible tor project
documentation, with the assistance ol Marlene
Amiot and Charla Meyer.
The BALLOTS system was also strongly sup
ported by the campus facility programming staff
under Jim Moore, including Richard Levitt, James
Powell, and Craig Will, who developed the video
terminal software support, and Richard Guertin,
William Kiefer, Tom Martin (of the Institute for
Communication Research), and John Schroeder
(project leader for SPIRES) for the SPIRES soft
ware utilized by the BALLOTS system.
Management direction and support came from
the Stanford Computation Center under its direc
tor, Charles Dickens, the director of the campus
facility. T. David Phillips, and their predecessors,
Paul Armer and Roderick M. Fredrickson.
The project director, Hank Epstein, drew upon
his experience with operational on-line systems to
bring BALLOTS to successful operation. Key con
tributions have come from Prof Edwin B. Parker.

principal investigator of Project SPIRES. The con
tinuing and persistent recognition of several of
ficers in the Provost's Office of the importance to
Stanford of enhanced library and information
retrieval service provided a moving and vital force
to the development effort, notably from Provost
William F. Miller and Associate Provost Gene F.
Franklin, who are, respectively, former chairman
and current chairman of the project's Executive
Committee.
To complete the credits for the past six years
would require listing nearly 100 names—more than
50 persons on the libraiy stalt, a dozen taculty
members who served in advisory capacities, and an
equal number of non-Stanford persons who served
on the project's External Advisory Committee.
To this list of living individuals we would have
to add the names of three important pseudo
persons having significant human attributes and
frequently personified, sometimes with affection,
sometimes with displeasure: MILTEN, WYLBUR,
and ORVYL, the masters of terminal discipline,
text editing, and time-sharing in the campus facili
ty's 360/67.
Where was all this accomplished? Mostly in two
inconspicuous temporary buildings located adja
cent to Cypress Hall and close to the Computation
Center's Campus Facility.

The project director, Hank Epstein, drew upon
his experience with operational on-line systems to
bring BALLOTS to successful operation. Key con
tributions have come from Prof Edwin B. Parker.

principal investigator of Project SPIRES. The con
tinuing and persistent recognition of several of
ficers in the Provost's Office of the importance to
Stanford of enhanced library and information
retrieval service provided a moving and vital force
to the development effort, notably from Provost
William F. Miller and Associate Provost Gene F.
Franklin, who are, respectively, former chairman
and current chairman of the project's Executive
Committee.
To complete the credits for the past six years
would require listing nearly 100 names—more than
50 persons on the libraiy stalt, a dozen taculty
members who served in advisory capacities, and an
equal number of non-Stanford persons who served
on the project's External Advisory Committee.
To this list of living individuals we would have
to add the names of three important pseudo
persons having significant human attributes and
frequently personified, sometimes with affection,
sometimes with displeasure: MILTEN, WYLBUR,
and ORVYL, the masters of terminal discipline,
text editing, and time-sharing in the campus facili

Where was all this accomplished? Mostly in two
inconspicuous temporary buildings located adja
cent to Cypress Hall and close to the Computation
Center's Campus Facility.
