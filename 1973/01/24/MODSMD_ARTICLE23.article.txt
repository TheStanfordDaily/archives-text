# Funding for BALLOTS
## 
### 
Funding to conduct feasibility studies and
create a working prototype of the BALLOTS
system was in large measure provided in a series of
three grants totaling $1,168,890 from the U.S.
Office of Education. Office of Education funding
began in July 1967, and terminated in March
1971, just as the Project was approaching final
development work on the production system now
being implemented.
Between April 1971 and August 1972, Stanford
continued the Project with its own resources at a
considerably reduced rate. In July 1972 the
National Endowment for the Humanities awarded
a two-year joint grant of $650,000 to complete
development and bring the basic BALLOTS sys
tem to operational status at Stanford. Half of the
funds in this new grant were supplied by the
Council on Library Resources, Inc.
BALLOTS has been very closely coordinated
with Project SPIRES (Stanford Public /nformation
REtrieval System), which received $1 million in
grants from the National Science Foundation
between 1967 and 1972.
Both projects have used the campus facility's
IBM 360/67 for development and production, and
both have benefited immeasurably from the Stan
ford Computation Center's intellectual expertise
and advanced knowledge of large, on-line, inter
active systems.
The coordination with SPIRES has allowed the
BALLOTS system to make extensive use of the
SPIRES file management and file searching soft
ware. Several features of the SPIRES system were
added by the SPIRES staff to aid in the develop
ment of BALLOTS.
