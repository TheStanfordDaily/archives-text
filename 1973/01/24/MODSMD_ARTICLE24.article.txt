# Foreign Investment May Be Beneficial
## 
### 
(AP) — A U.N. study suggests that
foreign subsidiaries of U.S.-based
multinational corporations help
rather than harm the developing
countries where they operate.
The author, Prof. Raymond
Vernon of Harvard, said their
operations seem "generally
benign" and in any event certainly
not "destructive enough to elicit
the deeply and widely felt
expressions of concern that
commonly come" from such
countries.
The study was released
Sunday.
"My impression is," Vernon
said, "that, when measured in
narrow economic terms, the
operations of United States-based
subsidiaries in the less developed
countries have benefited those
countries on balance."
Money Provided
He explained that U.S. oil,
copper, aluminum and
manufacturing companies had
provided such countries with the

necessary money and know-how
to develop their resources;
ready-made markets for their
products; jobs for their people;
and a push toward
industrialization.
Vernon conceded that the
countries' leaders got "a sense of
diluted control over the economic
life of their own countries" and
"a feeling of inequality and
insecurity" from the size and
power of the multinational
corporations and their ability to
pull out at will.
But he suggested that even if
they got rid of such corporations,
they would still "feel a sense of
vulnerability to world markets."
Quality Change
"It is not at all evident, for
instance," he said, "that
developing countries which
exclude multinational enterprises
from their territory do very much
more than change the quality and
form of their dependence."
He noted, "An acceptable

alternative mav well allow for the
continued existence and operation
of multinational enterprises in
developing countries under
conditions that limit the sense of
impotence and uncertainty of
those countries."
Vernon did not elaborate on
that. Indeed, he cautioned that
not enough facts were kflown
about this subject to warrant
"objectively defensible
conclusions."
Does Not Suffer
But he insisted that a
developing country does not
suffer economic harm just because
a multinational enterprise shows a
high rate of financial return on its
investment in a subsidiary there.
He explained that the
bookkeeping involved does not
take into account the overseas
research, marketing, credit and
other facilities from which the
subsidiary benefits.
Vernon, citing Department of
Commerce figures, said that in

1970, U.S.-based enterprises had
investments totaling over $21
million in developing countries
around the world.
The 26-page study was issued
here as a document of the U.N.
Conference on Trade and
Development, a permanent
organization in Geneva.

products; jobs for their people;
and a push toward
industrialization.
Vernon conceded that the
countries' leaders got "a sense of
diluted control over the economic
life of their own countries" and
"a feeling of inequality and
insecurity" from the size and
power of the multinational
corporations and their ability to
pull out at will.
But he suggested that even if
they got rid of such corporations,
they would still "feel a sense of
vulnerability to world markets."
Quality Change
"It is not at all evident, for
instance," he said, "that
developing countries which
exclude multinational enterprises
from their territory do very much
more than change the quality and
form of their dependence."
He noted, "An acceptable

alternative mav well allow for the
continued existence and operation
of multinational enterprises in
developing countries under
conditions that limit the sense of
impotence and uncertainty of
those countries."
Vernon did not elaborate on
that. Indeed, he cautioned that
not enough facts were kflown
about this subject to warrant
"objectively defensible
conclusions."
Does Not Suffer
But he insisted that a
developing country does not
suffer economic harm just because
a multinational enterprise shows a
high rate of financial return on its
investment in a subsidiary there.
He explained that the
bookkeeping involved does not
take into account the overseas
research, marketing, credit and
other facilities from which the
subsidiary benefits.
Vernon, citing Department of
Commerce figures, said that in

1970, U.S.-based enterprises had
investments totaling over $21
million in developing countries

(AP) — A U.N. study suggests that
foreign subsidiaries of U.S.-based
multinational corporations help
rather than harm the developing
countries where they operate.
The author, Prof. Raymond
Vernon of Harvard, said their
operations seem "generally
benign" and in any event certainly
not "destructive enough to elicit
the deeply and widely felt
expressions of concern that
commonly come" from such
countries.
The study was released
Sunday.
"My impression is," Vernon
said, "that, when measured in
narrow economic terms, the
operations of United States-based
subsidiaries in the less developed
countries have benefited those
countries on balance."
Money Provided
He explained that U.S. oil,
copper, aluminum and
manufacturing companies had
provided such countries with the

necessary money and know-how
to develop their resources;
ready-made markets for their
products; jobs for their people;
and a push toward
industrialization.
