## A 						Question Of Athletic Funds 
### 
The Athletic Department
recently announced that it would
spend $400,000 to construct two
tunnels on the west side of the
Stanford Stadium before this
coming fall.
Frankly, this is a waste of
money. Associate Athletic
Director Robert Young says that
the six sections in the stadium
which will be served by the new
tunnels are occupied "on the main
by our season ticket holders."
Young cited "congestion" in and
around these six sections as the
primary reason for this major
expenditure.
He complained that it has been
"damn near impossible" for the
occupants of those sections to
reach concessions and washrooms
during the game. Essentially,
Young said, the construction is
intended as "a customer service to
keep the season ticket sales up in
the lean years" when the Cardinal
football program is not as
successful as it has been in recent
years.
Public relations has its place,
but the pricetag in this case is far
too high when one considers how
many other areas within the
Athletic Department are more
deserving of this funding.
In addition to such trivial
needs as an appropriation for the
lighting of our tennis courts, the
women's athletics program here
would benefit greatly from greater
appropriations. The current level
of funding is pathetic and as long

ago as October, Athletic Director
Joe Ruetz promised that his
department would adapt to the
needs of the Women's Physical
Education program. As far as we
know, Ruetz has done little to
fulfill this pledge.
Women's PE Department
Chairman Pamela Strathairn says
that $400,000 would go a long
way towards "an expansion of the
facilities" within which her
program is now confined. She
estimates that 1100 women are
now taking part in the
instructional phase of the
program. Strathairn adds that the
Department also has five teams
which engage in intercollegiate
competition.
In addition to causing "a whole
bunch of people to faint," a
massive appropriation of this kind
would allow Strathairn's
department to immediately
implement many of the program
additions which they have been
planning over the last two years.
Increased funding would also
allow the five intercollegiate
teams to travel to and compete at
other schools.
If the Athletic Department and
the Board of Trustees were to
reallocate the $400,000 from the
Stadium to the Women's PE
program, the women who would
benefit from this money would
probably be glad to run for a
season ticket holder's popcorn
every Saturday next fall.

money. Associate Athletic
Director Robert Young says that
the six sections in the stadium
which will be served by the new
tunnels are occupied "on the main
by our season ticket holders."
Young cited "congestion" in and
around these six sections as the
primary reason for this major
expenditure.
He complained that it has been
"damn near impossible" for the
occupants of those sections to
reach concessions and washrooms
during the game. Essentially,
Young said, the construction is
intended as "a customer service to
keep the season ticket sales up in
the lean years" when the Cardinal
football program is not as
successful as it has been in recent
years.
Public relations has its place,
but the pricetag in this case is far
too high when one considers how
many other areas within the
Athletic Department are more
deserving of this funding.
In addition to such trivial
needs as an appropriation for the
lighting of our tennis courts, the
women's athletics program here
would benefit greatly from greater
appropriations. The current level
of funding is pathetic and as long

ago as October, Athletic Director
Joe Ruetz promised that his
department would adapt to the
needs of the Women's Physical
Education program. As far as we
know, Ruetz has done little to
fulfill this pledge.
Women's PE Department
Chairman Pamela Strathairn says
that $400,000 would go a long
way towards "an expansion of the
facilities" within which her
program is now confined. She
estimates that 1100 women are
now taking part in the
instructional phase of the
program. Strathairn adds that the
Department also has five teams
which engage in intercollegiate
competition.
In addition to causing "a whole
bunch of people to faint," a
massive appropriation of this kind
would allow Strathairn's
department to immediately
implement many of the program
additions which they have been
planning over the last two years.
Increased funding would also
allow the five intercollegiate
teams to travel to and compete at
other schools.
If the Athletic Department and
the Board of Trustees were to
reallocate the $400,000 from the
Stadium to the Women's PE
program, the women who would
benefit from this money would
probably be glad to run for a
season ticket holder's popcorn
every Saturday next fall.

FLYING HIGH — Stanford's gymnasts opened their season last week
with a victory over Fullerton State. Olympian Steve Hug led the Cards
in the victory. Stanford's next gymnastics meet will be this Friday,
against Chico State, in an 8 p.m. contest at Maples Pavilion.

The Athletic Department
recently announced that it would
spend $400,000 to construct two
tunnels on the west side of the
Stanford Stadium before this
coming fall.
Frankly, this is a waste of
money. Associate Athletic
Director Robert Young says that
the six sections in the stadium
which will be served by the new
tunnels are occupied "on the main
by our season ticket holders."
