# Track Captains Elected
## 
### 
Although the first varsity track
meet is still six weeks away, the
Cardinal trackmen have been
practicing since the start of the
fall quarter. At that time, the
team elected two captains for the
1973 season, seniors John
Anderson and Ralph Bakkensen.
Both are fourth year veterans
who have excelled in their
individual events and have
contributed greatly to the team.
Anderson, whose specialty is the
quarter-mile, has also competed in
the high hurdles, 220, and the
mile relay team. Bakkensen is a
shot putter and discus thrower.
Anderson, who hails from
Newberg, Oregon, chose Stanford
because, "I wanted the best
school that suited both my
academic and athletic pursuits.
Stanford is outstanding in both of
these categories." He was class
valedictorian and state champion
in the high and low hurdles.
He chose mechanical
engineering as his major and
followed it with the aid of an
ROTC scholarship. Recently, he
was elected to the prestigeous Tau
Beta Pi Honorary Engineering
Society.
Anderson was last year's team
captain and the third highest
scorer on the squad. He was the
1972 winner of the 110% Award,
the Ironman Award, the Judah
Memorial Captains Award.

On the track he ranks as the
number one quarter-miler with a
46.8 clocking to his credit, and is
expected to anchor the mile relay
team again this season. Anderson
is rated second in the 120 yard
high hurdles and 220 with times
of 14.4 and 21.4 respectively.
Bakkensen is also an Oregonian
(from Portland), and is the most
outstanding student-athlete on the
team. He too, was class
valedictorian and maintained a 4.0
grade point average throughout
his high school years.
Last year, he was elected to the

national honor fraternity Phi Beta
Kappa. He was also the recipient
of a Block "S" Scholarship-
Athlete Award and the A 1 Masters
Scholastic-Athletic Track Award.
Head track coach Payton
Jordan describes him as "an
extremely hard working athlete."
His hard work has earned him
marks of 53'5" in the shot put
and 154'3" in the discus.
However, he hopes to improve
this season. He says that his goal
in the shot is "58 feet" and adds
that "anything beyond that will
be a bonus."
