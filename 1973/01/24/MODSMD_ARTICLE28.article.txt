# Shuffling The Cards
## It Ain't All Dirty Towels 
### Dave Robinson 
Most basketball fans probably think the team
manager is a skinny little kid who picks up towels
after practice. But at Stanford, manager Buz Battle's
duties more closely resemble those of a corporate
executive than a waterboy.
Battle, a junior majoring in economics and
communications, spends more time on the phone
and at the bank than he does on the basketball
court. He is in charge of all plane reservations, meal
money for plavers, hotel reservations, arranging for
statisticians and ballboys, and all the Stanford
equipment. Occasionally he even finds time to
watch the Cards perform on the basketball court.
Buz began his association with Stanford
basketball as a player on the 1970-71 freshman
team. The frosh were 15-3 that year, but Buz spent
most of the season observing the action from the
bench. He did have one moment of glory, though.
With two seconds remaining in one game. Buz went
to the free throw line and converted both ends of a
one and one. Ordinarily this wouldn't be too
significant, but Buz's free throws were points
number 99 and 100 for Stanford, the first time a
Card frosh team had ever reached the century mark.
Buz claims that his high school career was
unusual, if not spectacular. "I was always noted for
unusual shots," he said. "I once tipped in a bounce
pass and came up with some really weird layups."
Defense Standout
Buz earned two varsity letters and averaged
about seven points a game. "I was never much of a
scorer," he admits. But in his senior year Buz was
honored as his team's outstanding defensive player
in a vote he insists was legitimate.
Despite his heavy workload, Buz has enjoyed his
association with the Stanford team, although the
Cards' inconsistency has left him frustrated at times.
"I still have that playing instinct and when the team
is going bad I feel like getting in there and playing,"
he said.
Stanford center Rich Kelley doesn't think that
Buz would do the Cards much good on the court,

but points out that he is an invaluable person on
road trips. "Buz takes care of everything," Kelley
said.
Buz's duties for a weekend road trip begin on
Thursday when he packs all the uniforms and
equipment,, confirms plane and hotel reservations,
picks up the trip itineraries, and cashes a check for
all the money used for miscellaneous items on the
trip (meals, taxis, movies, etc.). "I always get a
funny look from bank tellers when I tell them I
need 70 one dollar bills and 20 dollars in quarters,"
Buz said

On the day of a trip Buz calls all the players to
wake them up, takes care of all the luggage, handles
the plane tickets, checks into the motel, and
distributes the keys. "Later that evening I call all
the players a half hour before dinner," Buz says,
"and after dinner I proceed to wipe their asses in
poker."
Buz is in charge of a staff of 16 managers, who
cover all the freshman and varsity practices and
keep statistics for both teams. This year there are
four girls on the managerial staff. "I enjoy having
girls on the staff," Buz said, "and of course I try to
be as friendly to them as possible."
Buz's way with women became a legend on the
flight back from Seattle, where Buz set the Western
Airlines record for the most champagne consumed
in flight. Buz, who was in a frivolous mood after
Stanford's 76-55 victory over Washington, became
increasingly friendly with one of the stewardesses,
and by the time the plane neared San Francisco, he
and the stewardess were close friends.
As the players departed from the plane, the
stewardess kissed Buz and freshman forward Tim
Patterson. Dazed, Buz left the plane without the
team's movie projector. He got back on the plane
and was rewarded with a second kiss when he got
off, becoming the first person associated with the
Stanford team to be kissed twice by a stewardess.
And Buz Battle, the busiest man on the Stanford
basketball scene, loved every minute of it.

and the stewardess were close friends.
As the players departed from the plane, the
stewardess kissed Buz and freshman forward Tim
Patterson. Dazed, Buz left the plane without the
team's movie projector. He got back on the plane
and was rewarded with a second kiss when he got
off, becoming the first person associated with the
Stanford team to be kissed twice by a stewardess.
And Buz Battle, the busiest man on the Stanford
basketball scene, loved every minute of it.
Most basketball fans probably think the team
manager is a skinny little kid who picks up towels
after practice. But at Stanford, manager Buz Battle's
duties more closely resemble those of a corporate
executive than a waterboy.
Battle, a junior majoring in economics and
communications, spends more time on the phone
and at the bank than he does on the basketball
court. He is in charge of all plane reservations, meal
money for plavers, hotel reservations, arranging for
statisticians and ballboys, and all the Stanford
equipment. Occasionally he even finds time to
watch the Cards perform on the basketball court.
Buz began his association with Stanford
basketball as a player on the 1970-71 freshman
team. The frosh were 15-3 that year, but Buz spent
most of the season observing the action from the
bench. He did have one moment of glory, though.
With two seconds remaining in one game. Buz went
to the free throw line and converted both ends of a
one and one. Ordinarily this wouldn't be too
significant, but Buz's free throws were points
number 99 and 100 for Stanford, the first time a
Card frosh team had ever reached the century mark.
Buz claims that his high school career was
unusual, if not spectacular. "I was always noted for
unusual shots," he said. "I once tipped in a bounce
pass and came up with some really weird layups."
Defense Standout
Buz earned two varsity letters and averaged
about seven points a game. "I was never much of a
scorer," he admits. But in his senior year Buz was
honored as his team's outstanding defensive player
in a vote he insists was legitimate.
Despite his heavy workload, Buz has enjoyed his
association with the Stanford team, although the
Cards' inconsistency has left him frustrated at times.
"I still have that playing instinct and when the team
is going bad I feel like getting in there and playing,"
he said.
Stanford center Rich Kelley doesn't think that
Buz would do the Cards much good on the court,

but points out that he is an invaluable person on
road trips. "Buz takes care of everything," Kelley
said.
Buz's duties for a weekend road trip begin on
Thursday when he packs all the uniforms and
equipment,, confirms plane and hotel reservations,
picks up the trip itineraries, and cashes a check for
all the money used for miscellaneous items on the
trip (meals, taxis, movies, etc.). "I always get a
funny look from bank tellers when I tell them I
need 70 one dollar bills and 20 dollars in quarters,"
Buz said

On the day of a trip Buz calls all the players to
wake them up, takes care of all the luggage, handles
the plane tickets, checks into the motel, and
distributes the keys. "Later that evening I call all
the players a half hour before dinner," Buz says,
"and after dinner I proceed to wipe their asses in
poker."
Buz is in charge of a staff of 16 managers, who
cover all the freshman and varsity practices and
keep statistics for both teams. This year there are
four girls on the managerial staff. "I enjoy having
girls on the staff," Buz said, "and of course I try to
be as friendly to them as possible."
Buz's way with women became a legend on the
flight back from Seattle, where Buz set the Western
Airlines record for the most champagne consumed
in flight. Buz, who was in a frivolous mood after
Stanford's 76-55 victory over Washington, became
increasingly friendly with one of the stewardesses,
and by the time the plane neared San Francisco, he
and the stewardess were close friends.
