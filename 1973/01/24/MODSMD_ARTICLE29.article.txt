# Spikers To Compete Friday
## 
### PHIL HUBBARD 
The 1973 track season begins
this Friday for several members of
the Stanford team who have been
invited to compete in the San
Francisco Examiner Indoor
Games.
Brian Mittelstaedt will be
featured in the mile. His best
mark of 4:05.3 was made in an
upset third place finish in the
Pac-8 Championships last year.
Another possible entry for the
Cards is Mark McConnell in the
two mile. He has received an
invitation and will go if the
coaches feel he is ready for the
meet. He has run 9:10:4 officially,
but has run several seconds faster
than that in practice.
Ken Curl, last year's high point
man as a sophomore, will run in
the 60 yard dash. Last May in the
Pac-8 Championships, Curl ran an
outstanding 9.4 in the preliminary
heats of the 100. He is probably
best known for a 9.3 100 he ran
as a junior in high school.
Tom Anderson, with a lifetime
best of 25'2 1 /2" in the long jump,
will be competing in that event

against a strong field. Sophomore
Dave Bagshaw will be running
both the high hurdles and the mile
relay. He brought his high hurdle
time down over half a second to
13.2 last season. He has run a 48.1
relay leg.
Other members of the relay
team include co-captain John
Anderson, who ran a blistering
46.8 relay leg last year, freshman
Matt Hogsett, who ran a 47.7 leg
last year, and decathlon star
Kenny Kring, who transferred this
year from Hancock J.C. and has
run in the low 49's.
Tony Sandoval, a freshman
distance runner, was also invited
to compete in the Examiner two
mile, but chose instead to go to
the Albuquerque J.C. meet on
Saturday. He went to high school

in New Mexico, and wanted the
chance to compete there again.
Along with the Stanford
athletes will be competitors from
USC, UCLA, Cal, San Jose State,
ana several area high schools and
junior colleges.
Some exciting open events will
be the mile, which will feature
Dave Wottle, the Olympic gold
medalist in the 800 meters; the
long jump, with another gold
medalist, Randy Williams, who
leaped 27''/2" to get it; and the
shot put, a grudge match between
America's three Olympians, A 1
Feuerbach, George Wootfs, and
Brian Oldfield, and Wladyslaw
Komar of Poland, who beat them
out for the gold at Munich.
The events will begin at 6 p.m.
Friday at the Cow Palace.
