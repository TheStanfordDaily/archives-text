# New Founders League Formed
## Alumni Seek Change In Campus Direction 
### DAN BRENNER 
Michael Antonacci graduated from Stanford in
1924 with a bachelor's degree in engineering. Like
many members of that class, he is today a successful
businessman who remembers his good old college
days fondly and doesn't approve of the direction of
this institution.
Antonacci says: "99 percent of the students here
are fundamentally decent, but in order to bring
stronger discipline on campus, an end to
permissiveness, and a redirection of Stanford's
philosophy towards the center," he and 15 other
alumni, all pre-1954 graduates, organized the New
Founders League in August, 1972.
With a current membership of 700, the League
has bolted from the Alumni Association which
League first vice president Louis Sullivan (AB '48)
says "tends to minimize problems in the eyes of
alumni in their publications."
Antonacci says the League's purpose is to restore
greater alumni support for the University. "Many
have closed their hearts and pocketbooks to the
University.
"I came out of a tenement in Brooklyn. My
association with Stanford means a lot."
Question Mem Chu's Use
While claiming to be supporting the University,
their tabloid publication, "Stanford's Direction,"
puts a premium on campus lowlights. They bitterly
oppose Interim Chapel Dean Robert McAfee
Brown's management of the Memorial Church,
calling for reestablishment of the Church "as a place
of reverence and meditation, as specified by Mrs.
Stanford."
To argue their case, the December issue of

"Stanford's Direction" features a front page photo
of the Stanford Band recording at the church
chancel with a band member circled in crimson red
sitting on the altar. The accompanying article which
begins, "The desecration of Stanford Memorial
Church continues," accuses Brown of turning the
church into an auditorium.
Brown is scored on page three of the four page
newsletter in an article "Robert McAfee Brown —
Clergyman or Politician?" At one point the article
notes, "While he (Brown) spouts his political
harangues to a dwindling coterie of supporters
(Memorial Church is sometimes half empty when
Brown speaks), a true religious revival is taking place
on campus."
Brown, acknowledged as one of the world's
leading pioneers in ecumenical cooperation, was
quoted in the S.F. Examiner (Jan. 15, 1973) as
saying, "If the people who publish this sheet had
been kind enough to have contacted me, I would
have been glad to tell them that as soon as I learned
of this (Band incident), I wrote a letter to the
Stanford Band."
Mascot Abolition 'Asinine'
The League also objects to abolishing the Indian
as school mascot. The banner of "Stanford
Directions," contains a profile of the Indian, and
the first issue, dated August 1972, describes the
abolition as "Asinine!"
Sullivan termed the mascot change as "pointless
irritation to alumni." When explained the Native
American Student Association objections to the
symbol he said, "I disagree with their being
offended."
The League, which is similar to para-alumni

organizations established at Princeton and Yale, also
seeks restoration of the VIOTC programs, a "more
balanced faculty," admission of qualified students
only, regardless of race, color or creed, and a new
method of electing trustees.
"We want alumni to be informed," said Sullivan.
"The net result of the present procedures is that
most alumni don't vote."
Antonacci and Sullivan don't want to challenge
the administration. "We're not try to push President
Lyman out of office," assured Sullivan.
At the same time, the League has urged alumni
not to give unrestricted gifts to the University.
"Until such time as the trustees and administration
give concrete evidence of their desire to change
Stanford's Direction and place the University in a
more balanced position it is suggested that
contributions be made on a selective basis," suggests
an editorial. It specified the Hoover Institution as
one area.
With their newsletter mailed to 22,000 alumni,
the League's "redirection" seems to be more of a
turnaround to the changing politics and morality of
the student body during the 1960'5.
They praise 29 members of last year's football
team who affirmed their allegiance to the so-called
Jesus movement while attacking Prof. Brown for
encouraging the use of Memorial Church to mix
politics and the church. They lather over the skin
flicks shown in Roble Hall last quarter but issue
high praise for the Stanford Choir and the honor
code.
And while Sullivan says the League is "not trying
to tum the clock back 40 years," they are after
some basic policy changes in the University.

many members of that class, he is today a successful
businessman who remembers his good old college
days fondly and doesn't approve of the direction of
this institution.
Antonacci says: "99 percent of the students here
are fundamentally decent, but in order to bring
stronger discipline on campus, an end to
permissiveness, and a redirection of Stanford's
philosophy towards the center," he and 15 other
alumni, all pre-1954 graduates, organized the New
Founders League in August, 1972.
With a current membership of 700, the League
has bolted from the Alumni Association which
League first vice president Louis Sullivan (AB '48)
says "tends to minimize problems in the eyes of
alumni in their publications."
Antonacci says the League's purpose is to restore
greater alumni support for the University. "Many
have closed their hearts and pocketbooks to the
University.
"I came out of a tenement in Brooklyn. My
association with Stanford means a lot."
Question Mem Chu's Use
While claiming to be supporting the University,
their tabloid publication, "Stanford's Direction,"
puts a premium on campus lowlights. They bitterly
oppose Interim Chapel Dean Robert McAfee
Brown's management of the Memorial Church,
calling for reestablishment of the Church "as a place
of reverence and meditation, as specified by Mrs.
Stanford."
To argue their case, the December issue of

"Stanford's Direction" features a front page photo
of the Stanford Band recording at the church
chancel with a band member circled in crimson red
sitting on the altar. The accompanying article which
begins, "The desecration of Stanford Memorial
Church continues," accuses Brown of turning the
church into an auditorium.
Brown is scored on page three of the four page
newsletter in an article "Robert McAfee Brown —
Clergyman or Politician?" At one point the article
notes, "While he (Brown) spouts his political
harangues to a dwindling coterie of supporters
(Memorial Church is sometimes half empty when
Brown speaks), a true religious revival is taking place
on campus."
Brown, acknowledged as one of the world's
leading pioneers in ecumenical cooperation, was
quoted in the S.F. Examiner (Jan. 15, 1973) as
saying, "If the people who publish this sheet had
been kind enough to have contacted me, I would
have been glad to tell them that as soon as I learned
of this (Band incident), I wrote a letter to the
Stanford Band."
Mascot Abolition 'Asinine'
The League also objects to abolishing the Indian
as school mascot. The banner of "Stanford
Directions," contains a profile of the Indian, and
the first issue, dated August 1972, describes the
abolition as "Asinine!"
Sullivan termed the mascot change as "pointless
irritation to alumni." When explained the Native
American Student Association objections to the
symbol he said, "I disagree with their being
offended."
The League, which is similar to para-alumni

organizations established at Princeton and Yale, also
seeks restoration of the VIOTC programs, a "more
balanced faculty," admission of qualified students
only, regardless of race, color or creed, and a new
method of electing trustees.
"We want alumni to be informed," said Sullivan.
"The net result of the present procedures is that
most alumni don't vote."
Antonacci and Sullivan don't want to challenge
the administration. "We're not try to push President
Lyman out of office," assured Sullivan.
At the same time, the League has urged alumni
not to give unrestricted gifts to the University.
"Until such time as the trustees and administration
give concrete evidence of their desire to change
Stanford's Direction and place the University in a
more balanced position it is suggested that
contributions be made on a selective basis," suggests
an editorial. It specified the Hoover Institution as
one area.
With their newsletter mailed to 22,000 alumni,
the League's "redirection" seems to be more of a
turnaround to the changing politics and morality of
the student body during the 1960'5.
They praise 29 members of last year's football
team who affirmed their allegiance to the so-called
Jesus movement while attacking Prof. Brown for
encouraging the use of Memorial Church to mix
politics and the church. They lather over the skin
flicks shown in Roble Hall last quarter but issue
high praise for the Stanford Choir and the honor
code.
And while Sullivan says the League is "not trying
to tum the clock back 40 years," they are after
some basic policy changes in the University.
