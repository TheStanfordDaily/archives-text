US Ambassador Held At Gunpoint
WASHINGTON — The U.S. ambassador to Haiti, Clinton
E. Knox, was reported last night to be trapped at
gunpoint in the American Embassy in Port au Prince.
State Department officials declined to comment on the
report in any way at this time. They indicated they might
have something to say later.
Other sources said Knox was being held at the embassy
by three unidentified gunmen. They had no immediate
word as to the motive.
Johnson Lies In State
AUSTIN, Tex. - The body of Lyndon B. Johnson lay in
state yesterday on the eve of his final journey to the
nation's capital, the peace he longed for finally signalled
by his successor as the nation's president.
As thousands of mourners paced slowly by the
flag-draped coffin, President Nixon told the nation that
the distant and divisive war that had haunted Johnson's
dreams of a Great Society had come to an end.
Johnson, 64 and wracked by years of heart disease,
died Monday of what doctors described as "severe
coronary artery disease."
"In his life, President Johnson endured the vilification
of those who portray him as a man of war," Nixon said in
a televised address. "But there was nothing he cared about
more deeply than achieving lasting peace in the world."
In announcing conclusion of an agreement to end the
conflict that reached its peak during the Johnson years,
Nixon said of his predecessor: "No one would have
welcomed this peace more than he."
The body will be flown to Washington today and will
be carried by Army caison to the Capitol Rotunda, where
the former president will lie in state until tomorrow
morning. President Nixon and other dignitaries are
expected to take part in the hour-long procession up
Constitution Avenue to the Capitol.
Nixon has declared tomorrow a national day of
mourning and called on people to assemble on that day
"in their respective places of worship" to honor Johnson's
memory.
Evangelist Billy Graham will officiate at final rites
before Johnson is buried alongside his parents and
grandparents in the graveyard, situated in Texas' hill
country and dotted with handsome oak trees.
Pentagon Readies POW Return
WASHINGTON — Secretary of Defense Melvin R. Laird
announced last night that flight crews and teams of
doctors, nurses, and other medical personnel were
standing by — awaiting only a go-ahead on where and
when to pick up U.S. servicemen held captive in
Indochina.
Laird said, shortly after President Nixon announced
that an Indochina cease-fire will go into effect 4 p.m. PST
Saturday, that initial flights to pick up the prisoners will

begin "as soon as possible after the formal signing of the
agreement in Paris."
The Pentagon had hoped to fly medical evacuation
planesdirectly to Hanoi for the pickup but officials believe
North Vietnam is unlikely to go along with this. Instead,
it now appears the men will be flown from Hanoi aboard
Communist aircraft to Vientiane in Laos.
They will be loaded aboard huge Air Force Cl4l
transports now standing by in the Western Pacific and
shuttled to Clark Field in the Philippines, the primary
processing station. In the event of a mass release, some
would be flown to U.S. bases on Okinawa and Guam.
New uniforms specially tailored to account for
expected weight loss and stitched with decorations and
rank insignia earned while in prison await each man at
Clark Field.
Also awaiting the men at Clark are toilet kits and
"personnel information brochures" with photographs and
letters from their families and list of back pay allowances
and leave time accrued while in captivity.
Operation Homecoming anticipates that some of the
men, because of their long periods in captivity may face
long periods of adjustment.
Viet Fighting Reported Heavy
SAIGON — Communist forces nearly doubled their
attacks across South Vietnam in a high point of activity
before a cease-fire, the Saigon command announced
today.
Military headquarters reported 95 Communist attacks
during the 24-hour period ending at 6 a.m. today,
compared with 52 in the previous 24 hours. About
two-thirds were rocket and mortar assaults.
American warplanes pounded Red positions
throughout South Vietnam yesterday and South
Vietnamese infantrymen mounted spoiling operations on
the ground.
Military sources said the air raids — the heaviest in one
day in five months — and the ground thrusts were
designed to prevent a Viet Cong land grab before a
cease-fire.
President Nguyen Van Thieu, in a special Tet lunar new
year letter read over government television last night,
warned his nation not to trust the Communists during a
cease-fire.
"If the Communists have to agree to sign a cease-fire
agreement it is only because their war of invasion has been
defeated," the president said.
Today's Weather
Increasing cloudiness today with rain likely this afternoon
and night becoming partly cloudy with chance of showers
tomorrow. Lows tonight in mid 30s to low 40s. Highs
today and tomorrow in 50s. Light wind becoming
southerly 10 to 20 mph today. Chance of rain 70 percent
today and tonight.

Clark Field.
Also awaiting the men at Clark are toilet kits and
"personnel information brochures" with photographs and
letters from their families and list of back pay allowances
and leave time accrued while in captivity.
Operation Homecoming anticipates that some of the
men, because of their long periods in captivity may face
long periods of adjustment.
Viet Fighting Reported Heavy
SAIGON — Communist forces nearly doubled their
attacks across South Vietnam in a high point of activity
before a cease-fire, the Saigon command announced
today.
Military headquarters reported 95 Communist attacks
during the 24-hour period ending at 6 a.m. today,
compared with 52 in the previous 24 hours. About
two-thirds were rocket and mortar assaults.
American warplanes pounded Red positions
throughout South Vietnam yesterday and South
Vietnamese infantrymen mounted spoiling operations on
the ground.
Military sources said the air raids — the heaviest in one
day in five months — and the ground thrusts were
designed to prevent a Viet Cong land grab before a
cease-fire.
President Nguyen Van Thieu, in a special Tet lunar new
year letter read over government television last night,
warned his nation not to trust the Communists during a
cease-fire.
"If the Communists have to agree to sign a cease-fire
agreement it is only because their war of invasion has been
defeated," the president said.
Today's Weather
Increasing cloudiness today with rain likely this afternoon
and night becoming partly cloudy with chance of showers
tomorrow. Lows tonight in mid 30s to low 40s. Highs
today and tomorrow in 50s. Light wind becoming
southerly 10 to 20 mph today. Chance of rain 70 percent
today and tonight.
US Ambassador Held At Gunpoint
WASHINGTON — The U.S. ambassador to Haiti, Clinton
E. Knox, was reported last night to be trapped at
gunpoint in the American Embassy in Port au Prince.
State Department officials declined to comment on the
report in any way at this time. They indicated they might
have something to say later.
Other sources said Knox was being held at the embassy
by three unidentified gunmen. They had no immediate
word as to the motive.
Johnson Lies In State
AUSTIN, Tex. - The body of Lyndon B. Johnson lay in
state yesterday on the eve of his final journey to the
nation's capital, the peace he longed for finally signalled
by his successor as the nation's president.
As thousands of mourners paced slowly by the
flag-draped coffin, President Nixon told the nation that
the distant and divisive war that had haunted Johnson's
dreams of a Great Society had come to an end.
Johnson, 64 and wracked by years of heart disease,
died Monday of what doctors described as "severe
coronary artery disease."
"In his life, President Johnson endured the vilification
of those who portray him as a man of war," Nixon said in
a televised address. "But there was nothing he cared about
more deeply than achieving lasting peace in the world."
In announcing conclusion of an agreement to end the
conflict that reached its peak during the Johnson years,
Nixon said of his predecessor: "No one would have
welcomed this peace more than he."
The body will be flown to Washington today and will
be carried by Army caison to the Capitol Rotunda, where
the former president will lie in state until tomorrow
morning. President Nixon and other dignitaries are
expected to take part in the hour-long procession up
Constitution Avenue to the Capitol.
Nixon has declared tomorrow a national day of
mourning and called on people to assemble on that day
"in their respective places of worship" to honor Johnson's
memory.
Evangelist Billy Graham will officiate at final rites
before Johnson is buried alongside his parents and
grandparents in the graveyard, situated in Texas' hill
country and dotted with handsome oak trees.
Pentagon Readies POW Return
WASHINGTON — Secretary of Defense Melvin R. Laird
announced last night that flight crews and teams of
doctors, nurses, and other medical personnel were
standing by — awaiting only a go-ahead on where and
when to pick up U.S. servicemen held captive in
Indochina.
Laird said, shortly after President Nixon announced
that an Indochina cease-fire will go into effect 4 p.m. PST
Saturday, that initial flights to pick up the prisoners will

begin "as soon as possible after the formal signing of the
agreement in Paris."
The Pentagon had hoped to fly medical evacuation
planesdirectly to Hanoi for the pickup but officials believe
North Vietnam is unlikely to go along with this. Instead,
it now appears the men will be flown from Hanoi aboard
Communist aircraft to Vientiane in Laos.
They will be loaded aboard huge Air Force Cl4l
transports now standing by in the Western Pacific and
shuttled to Clark Field in the Philippines, the primary
processing station. In the event of a mass release, some
would be flown to U.S. bases on Okinawa and Guam.
New uniforms specially tailored to account for
expected weight loss and stitched with decorations and
rank insignia earned while in prison await each man at
Clark Field.
Also awaiting the men at Clark are toilet kits and
"personnel information brochures" with photographs and
letters from their families and list of back pay allowances
and leave time accrued while in captivity.

the former president will lie in state until tomorrow
morning. President Nixon and other dignitaries are
expected to take part in the hour-long procession up
Constitution Avenue to the Capitol.
Nixon has declared tomorrow a national day of
mourning and called on people to assemble on that day
"in their respective places of worship" to honor Johnson's
memory.
Evangelist Billy Graham will officiate at final rites
before Johnson is buried alongside his parents and
grandparents in the graveyard, situated in Texas' hill
country and dotted with handsome oak trees.
Pentagon Readies POW Return
WASHINGTON — Secretary of Defense Melvin R. Laird
announced last night that flight crews and teams of
doctors, nurses, and other medical personnel were
standing by — awaiting only a go-ahead on where and
when to pick up U.S. servicemen held captive in
Indochina.
Laird said, shortly after President Nixon announced
that an Indochina cease-fire will go into effect 4 p.m. PST
Saturday, that initial flights to pick up the prisoners will

begin "as soon as possible after the formal signing of the
agreement in Paris."
The Pentagon had hoped to fly medical evacuation
planesdirectly to Hanoi for the pickup but officials believe
North Vietnam is unlikely to go along with this. Instead,
it now appears the men will be flown from Hanoi aboard
Communist aircraft to Vientiane in Laos.
They will be loaded aboard huge Air Force Cl4l
transports now standing by in the Western Pacific and
shuttled to Clark Field in the Philippines, the primary
processing station. In the event of a mass release, some
would be flown to U.S. bases on Okinawa and Guam.
New uniforms specially tailored to account for
expected weight loss and stitched with decorations and
rank insignia earned while in prison await each man at
Clark Field.
Also awaiting the men at Clark are toilet kits and
"personnel information brochures" with photographs and
letters from their families and list of back pay allowances
and leave time accrued while in captivity.
Operation Homecoming anticipates that some of the
men, because of their long periods in captivity may face
long periods of adjustment.
Viet Fighting Reported Heavy
SAIGON — Communist forces nearly doubled their
attacks across South Vietnam in a high point of activity
before a cease-fire, the Saigon command announced
today.
Military headquarters reported 95 Communist attacks
during the 24-hour period ending at 6 a.m. today,
compared with 52 in the previous 24 hours. About
two-thirds were rocket and mortar assaults.
American warplanes pounded Red positions
throughout South Vietnam yesterday and South
Vietnamese infantrymen mounted spoiling operations on
the ground.
Military sources said the air raids — the heaviest in one
day in five months — and the ground thrusts were
designed to prevent a Viet Cong land grab before a
cease-fire.
President Nguyen Van Thieu, in a special Tet lunar new
year letter read over government television last night,
warned his nation not to trust the Communists during a
cease-fire.
"If the Communists have to agree to sign a cease-fire
agreement it is only because their war of invasion has been
defeated," the president said.
