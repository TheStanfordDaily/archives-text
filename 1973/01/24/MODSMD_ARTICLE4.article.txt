###

announced last night.

held "throughout Indochina" will be
released within 60 days, and an
accounting of those missing in action
will be made.
All United States troops will leave
South Vietnam within 60 days, but no
withdrawal from the remainder of
Indochina or the Gulf of Tonkin was
announced.

yesterday by Henry Kissinger for the
United States and Le Due Tho for
North Vietnam. Foreign ministers for
the U.S., the two Vietnams, and the
Viet Cong will sign it in Paris on
Saturday.

Its text was to be disclosed at the
White House at 7 a.m. PST today.
Nixon addressed the nation on
radio and television yesterday evening.
"Throughout the 'years of
negotiations we have insisted on peace
with honor," the President said. "In
the settlement that has now been
agreed to, all the stipulations I have set
down have been met."
Self-Determination
Nixon said the agreement
guarantees that the people of South
Vietnam will have "the right to
determine their own future without
outside interference." On this, as on
other points, he did not elaborate.

He said the settlement meets the
goals and has the full support of South
Vietnamese President Thieu and all the
other allies, and he added: "We shall
continue to aid the South Vietnamese
and all the other people of Southeast
Asia."
Thieu said this morning in Saigon
the Vietnam cease-fire will not "give
us a 100 percent guarantee for a
lasting peace" and the political
struggle following it "will be as
difficult and dangerous as the military
fight."

Thieu claimed in a nationwide radio
address that most of his major
demands had been met by Hanoi,
including recognition of South
Vietnam as a separate sovereign state.
Sole Government
Nixon said, "The United States will
continue to recognize the government
of the Republic of Vietnam (the Thieu
government) as the sole legitimate
government of South Vietnam."
To the leaders of North Vietnam,

he said, "Let us now build a peace of
reconciliation. For our part, we are
prepared to make a major effort to
help achieve that g0a1.... Reciproc
ity ... will be needed to build and
strengthen the peace."
The President saved his message "to
the American people" until the end of
his speech, saying their stead fa -
support of "our insistence on peace
with honor has made peace with honor
possible."
Silence
He acknowledged that he had
avoided for months any public
stat.ements about Vietnam
negotiations, but said his silence was
necessary. "The important thing was
not to talk about peace, but to get
peace — and to get the right kind of
peace," he said. "This we have done.
"Let us be proud," Nixon said,
"that America did not settle for a
peace that would have betrayed our
allies, that would have abandoned our
prisoners of war, or that would have
ended the war for us but would have
continued the war for the 50 million
people of Indochina."
He said America should be proud
too, for the 2'A million young
Americans who served in Vietnam "in
one of the most selfless enterprises in
the history of nations."

He singled out the wives, children
and families of American POWs and
men missing in action as "some of the
bravest people I have ever met" and
added, "Nothing means more to me
than the fact that your long vigil is
coming to an end.

"We must recognize that ending the
war is only the first step toward
building the peace," Nixon said.
"All parties must now see to it that
this is peace that lasts, a peace that
heals — and a peace that not only ends
the war in Southeast Asia but
contributes to prospects of peace in
the world," he said.
Nixon said the United States will
strictly adhere to the agreement's
terms and that he expects other parties
to do the same — a phrase that
appeared intended as a warning to the
Communists that the United States
will be watching for violations of the
accord.
He told the people and government
of South Vietnam that their courage
and sacrifice "have won the precise
right to determine your own future."

Nixon addressed the nation on
radio and television yesterday evening.
"Throughout the 'years of
negotiations we have insisted on peace
with honor," the President said. "In
the settlement that has now been
agreed to, all the stipulations I have set
down have been met."
Self-Determination
Nixon said the agreement
guarantees that the people of South
Vietnam will have "the right to
determine their own future without
outside interference." On this, as on
other points, he did not elaborate.

He said the settlement meets the
goals and has the full support of South
Vietnamese President Thieu and all the
other allies, and he added: "We shall
continue to aid the South Vietnamese
and all the other people of Southeast
Asia."
Thieu said this morning in Saigon
the Vietnam cease-fire will not "give
us a 100 percent guarantee for a
lasting peace" and the political
struggle following it "will be as
difficult and dangerous as the military
fight."

Vietnam War Chronology, page five

Thieu claimed in a nationwide radio
address that most of his major
demands had been met by Hanoi,
including recognition of South
Vietnam as a separate sovereign state.
Sole Government
Nixon said, "The United States will
continue to recognize the government
of the Republic of Vietnam (the Thieu
government) as the sole legitimate
government of South Vietnam."
To the leaders of North Vietnam,

he said, "Let us now build a peace of
reconciliation. For our part, we are
prepared to make a major effort to
help achieve that g0a1.... Reciproc
ity ... will be needed to build and
strengthen the peace."
The President saved his message "to
the American people" until the end of
his speech, saying their stead fa -
support of "our insistence on peace
with honor has made peace with honor
possible."
Silence
He acknowledged that he had
avoided for months any public
stat.ements about Vietnam
negotiations, but said his silence was
necessary. "The important thing was
not to talk about peace, but to get
peace — and to get the right kind of
peace," he said. "This we have done.
"Let us be proud," Nixon said,
"that America did not settle for a
peace that would have betrayed our
allies, that would have abandoned our
prisoners of war, or that would have
ended the war for us but would have
continued the war for the 50 million
people of Indochina."
He said America should be proud
too, for the 2'A million young
Americans who served in Vietnam "in
one of the most selfless enterprises in
the history of nations."

He singled out the wives, children
and families of American POWs and
men missing in action as "some of the
bravest people I have ever met" and
added, "Nothing means more to me
than the fact that your long vigil is
coming to an end.

"We must recognize that ending the
war is only the first step toward
building the peace," Nixon said.
"All parties must now see to it that
this is peace that lasts, a peace that
heals — and a peace that not only ends
the war in Southeast Asia but
contributes to prospects of peace in
the world," he said.
Nixon said the United States will
strictly adhere to the agreement's
terms and that he expects other parties
to do the same — a phrase that
appeared intended as a warning to the
Communists that the United States
will be watching for violations of the
accord.
He told the people and government
of South Vietnam that their courage
and sacrifice "have won the precise
right to determine your own future."
From the Associated Press
A Vietnam peace agreement has
