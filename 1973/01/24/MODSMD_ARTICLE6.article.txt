# Cease-Fire May Not Alter Basic Indochina Problems
## 
### DAVID THIEMANN 
President Nixon last night
announced a cease-fire agreement, not

a peace pact. Although the United
States will withdraw its military forces
from South Vietnam, the Indochina
mess remains otherwise the same, aside
from a fragile truce in Vietnam.
Despite Nixon's boast that
"America did not settle for a peace
that would have ... ended the war for
us but continued the war for the 50
million people of Indochina," the
agreement does not alter the military
and political status quo in Southeast
Asia.

Analysis

By his timing Nixon separated the
announcement of a cease-fire
agreement from release of confusing,
sobering agreements and protocols.
After last night's emotional relief and
catharsis, the American people, who
now remember the war only during
elections and massive bombing, may
wake today to an uncertain picture.
The President worded his statement
weakly, without proclaiming victory
or taunting the North Vietnamese and
Viet Cong, but he emphasized the
principles — "peace with honor" and
self-determination — which
precipitated the American debacle in
Vietnam.
Privately, Nixon has apparently
abandoned these illusions. He, Henry
Kissinger, and other national security
advisers doubtless realize that the
North Vietnamese have not renounced
attempts to unify Vietnam.
The survival of South Vietnam —
barring unexpected American action —
now depends on the North Vietnamese
and Viet Cong. They may wait,
rebuilding their battered country,
before trying again to "liberate" the
south.
They may concentrate on political
and low-profile guerilla action in the
south, without openly violating the
Paris accords.
Or they may renew military action
in South Vietnam after the United
States withdraws. The communist
strategy depends in large part on the
strength of the South Vietnamese
government.
In any case, the United States will
withdraw during the cease-fire,
regardless of the ultimate fate of the
tormented south. President Nixon
negotiated the agreement for this
reason, his statements to the contrary
notwithstanding.
Nixon correctly noted that
"America did not settle for a peace
that would have abandoned our
allies," but the United States has
