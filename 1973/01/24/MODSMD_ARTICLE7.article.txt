## Earthquake Disaster 
### 
Natural disasters, like the earthquake which leveled Managua,
Nicaragua in December, bring victims an anguish and despair which
cannot be assuaged by promises or blind faith. In a matter of minutes,
hundreds of lives were lost and thousands of dreams of a better future
were dashed.
A disaster of the scope of the Managua quake deals a critical blow
to an emerging economy. Unable to properly care for its citizens
under normal conditions, the depleted national resources cannot now
be expected to carry the heavy burden of relief and rebuilding.
Those whose houses were left standing or who have relatives to
stay with can at least begin to piece together their broken lives and
livelihoods. It is the poorest, however, who suffer most in the quake's
aftermath, living in crowded refugee centers under squalid conditions.
Many of these people still lack adequate housing and food, but
regrettably, there are just not enough relief supplies to go around.
The Nicaraguan Relief Drive being sponsored by six Nicaraguan
students here is aimed at helping those who need help most by
channeling funds to a relief center in Granada, Nicaragua.
Tax-deductible donations can be made this week at the engineering
corner, the Post Office and Tresidder or by mail to Nicaraguan Relief,
Bcchtel International Center, P.O. Box 5816, Stanford, Calif. 94305.
We urge you to give what you can.
The tragedy in Managua reminds us that the possibility of
earthquakes in this area is very real. The tremors in Los Angeles two
years ago are sharp reminders that the Bay Area is susceptible to the
terror of sndden earth movements. Because building practices in
California are strictly regulated, a quake of the magnitude of the
Managua disaster would not cause nearly as many deaths or as much
property damage here. But a quake still could cause sizeable problems
and all residents of this area should remember some basic safety
procedures to follow in case of a quake.
If you are inside a building when a quake occurs, stay inside. Don't
run outside. If you are near, a desk, get under it. But if there are no
desks, take a look at the ceiling to determine which area is safest from
falling light fixtures, plaster or other objects. Also, be sure to keep
away from large windows. If you are outside, but very near a building,
get inside quickly. But if you are not directly adjacent to a building,
stay out in the open as far away from potential falling objects as
possible. Cornices, decorative objects and tiles are particularly
dangerous during a tremor, so stay away from areas with these
objects. Remember, stay in the middle of the street or in an open area
if you are outside and not directly adjacent to a building when a
quake occurs.
The arcades in the Quad are particularly dangerous during a quake
because of the large number of cornices and tiles. Although the
University has strengthened some of these arcades in recent years, get
away from them during a quake. We urge the University to again make
a thorough check of all buildings to see that all fixtures and other
potentially dangerous objects are as firmly anchored as is possible.
Do not panic during a quake. Remember the safety procedures
outlined above and keep yourself in the safest position possible.
Simple common sense can prevent many deaths and injuries during an
earthquake.
