## Predators Of The Highway

It seems most people in this
country eventually get the idea to
go on some kind of casual
cross-country tour. I myself had a
job on the East Coast over the
summer, and for those of you
who have never been there I am
going to fill you in on some of the
strange things you will see when
you drive there.
First thing you should know is
that as you may have learned
from your classmates, people on
the East Coast do indeed speak
English. The natives range from
the friendly to the spear-throwing
so you should always check the
character of the neighborhood
you are in before venturing out.
Travelers from San Francisco will
have no trouble in adjusting
themselves to this situation.
Driving on the East Coast is
incredibly expensive and
intolerably wearying. The East
Coast is, after all, the region that
invented the non-free freeway. It
seems everybody in the East has
his hand out and toll collectors on
the Pennsylvania Turnpike are no
exception.
That turnpike is such an
incredibly bad and archaic road
that it is remarkable to me that
they do not pay travelers instead
of the other way around. Where
else can the motorist breathe
truck exhaust for hundreds of
miles straight while rolling
through open green countryside?
Evidently, the Pennsylvania
State Legislature long before the
ecology movement became
popular decided to discourage the
growth of automobile traffic by
stopping building roads. They
stopped construction after they
had built just one four-lane
highway to connect Philadelphia
and Pittsburgh. Unfortunately,
they neglected to provide
alternative transportation systems,
and consequently it has become a
permanent rush hour.
Trucks seem to be attracted to
this winding road in droves, and it
is not unusual to see whole hordes
of these predators ganging up on
little Volkswagens. The technique
is very simple. A Bekins moving
van comes up from behind, and
prevents the Volksie from slowing
down. Then an auto carrier passes
and holds the little car up in
front, while a gasoline truck,
easily the most-feared Goliath of
them all, takes up a covering
position kissing the Volkswagen's
rear bumper.
The motorist's screams of
terror are covered up by the
snorting of the trucks and their
grinding gears, like grizzlies'
licking their chops before dining
on Bambi. Belching black smoke,
they have cornered their prev, and

now they move in for the kill.
An Eastern friend of mine tells
me that sometimes the highway
patrol is about to rescue the poor
motorist before it is too late, but
generally even then the poor
fellow has to be carted forthwith
to the nearest insane asylum.
I was instrumental in saving a
poor girl from whatever doom the
truckers had planned for her.
When she was cornered by some
truckers near Mountain Home, I,
admittedly somewhat
courageously, forced my way
between an Armour Meats truck
and a Wonder Bread truck, and
scared them all off by turning on
my handy-dandy "made in Hong
Kong" wonder police flasher,
which is highly illegal, but an
emergency is an emergency. (My
brother gave me the flasher; he
told me it was good for laughs in
Lover's Lane.) The trucks were
scared off and whooshed on down
the highway. As they rounded the
next rise, I heard the bread driver
challenge the other to a joust with
a blast of his horn.
The girl pulled her Volkswagen

off the highway and I followed.
As I came up to her window, I
could see she was slightly
delirious. I gently slapped her face
to bring her out of it as I had seen
in TV shows, but she did not
come to- I immediately tried
mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and
this revived her very quickly.
Immediately, without saying a
word, she threw her car into gear
and zipped off onto the highway,
a look of clear mania on her face.
You have to realize that
Easterners are always on tight
schedules. She barely missed being
squished by a Cadillac who
sounded his horn most nobly for
ten seconds thereafter in a kind of
spastic reaction.
I found out later from reading
the newspaper that those two
trucks finally got their just
rewards. Near Morristown they
apparently tangled when they
both tried simultaneously to pass
a '53 DeSoto on a sharp curve.
There were sandwiches all over
the highway.
