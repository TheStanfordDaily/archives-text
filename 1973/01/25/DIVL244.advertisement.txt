In Case Of Fire
1. ALWA YS pull a fire alarm box or call the Stanford Fire J
Department (322-6868 or extension 2313) — even if you think »
you have extinguished or can control a fire. Use a fire alarm box \
when possible, because it dispatches fire apparatus more quickly «
and surely than a phone alarm. Post these numbers next to your [
p telephone. If you phone, make sure you call the STANFORD n
H Fire Department, not Palo Alto.
B 2. If you are in a building with a local alarm, which sounds »
horns but does not ring in the fire station, pull the nearest \
j outdoor alarm box or phone in an alarm immediately after *
* evacuating the building. Most of the frats and row houses have J
local alarms. i
3. Do not attempt to fight major fires — evacuate the J
J building immediately. Always evacuate when you hear a fire x
m alarm — do not assume it is a test or a false alarm.
4. Summon firemen for emergency medical care. They i
v respond more quickly than an ambulance and provide excellent *
jj care. Use the same phone numbers (322-6868 or extension (
i 2313). »
