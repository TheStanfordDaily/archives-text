## COST: Coalition On Student Tuition 
### 
elaine wong

You've heard the facts by now.
Tuition for undergraduates has
doubled in the last eight years,
rising from $1575 in 1966-67 to
next year's scheduled $3135. If
the recent ten percent rate of
increase continues, freshmen
entering this year will be paying a
$3800 tuition bill in their
graduating year.
The figures are fearsome.
Contrary to popular belief, not all
Stanford students are living off of
their parents or cushy financial
aids packages. How many students
are on work-study, have
part-time jobs, or work all
summer? How many more would

like to be financially independent
of their parents, or question
whether the financial burden they
place on themselves or their
family is worth it? How many
potential students of lower
income backgrounds never even
apply because the huge price tag
scares them off?
The answers to the above may
be difficult to quantify, but they
and other questions do need
answering. Why were freshmen
told before they enrolled that the
scheduled rate of tuition increase
was going to be six percent when
that rate isn't adhered to? Over
the past seven years, the rates
have been successively 8.5%
11.7%, 11.9%, 8.75%,* 8.75%,
9.2%, and next year 10%. This is
more than mere oversight or
miscalculation; it approaches
deception.
Market Impact
The administration's deciding
on tuition levels in November
before the final budget is
approved and actual expenditures
are known in March leads some
students to suspect that tuition is
set at what the market will bear
and not to simply meet the level
of income the university finds
necessary to acheive whatever
goals it has set for itself.

Students are graduating early
and spending quarters at other
schools or working to ease the
financial pressures, but most
students who have entered
Stanford eventually want to
graduate from here. Leaving
because you can't pay the price,
although you want to stay, is no
alternative.
What is all this leading to? Talk
is met by more talk. We don't
want sympathy; we want set
policies and actions from the
administration which will ease the
tuition crunch. We want to know
why tuition was raised ten
percent; "we need it," is not
sufficient (Provost Miller's three
word explanation). We want to
know what tuition is being used
for. Don't we as members of the
community deserve an
explanation?
The University must develop a
set of rational guidelines for
tuition that can be the subject of
constructive criticism. Financial
aids should be reviewed to insure
that tuition raises do not have
harmful affects on the
composition of the student body.
The Financial Aids Office could
develop deferred post-graduate
payment options through which
students could escape the

financial burden while still in
school.
These are the possibilities for
change. Their implementation
requires COST, the Coalition On
Student Tuition. Tuition can
continue to rise at these
unreasonable rates because the
administration feels that the rates
are reasonable and that students
will continue to pay increasing
amounts of money without much
more than a few grumblings. That
is why we must illustrate and
articulate our real situation and
feelings. COST is the mechanism.
Ask any administrator and he'll
tell you it's the squeaky wheel
that gets the grease. Within a
bureaucracy, a group must
organize to be heard. We can
change the outlook on tuition
decisions. COST already has
specific ideas for expressing
student dissatisfaction concerning
tuition, but we'll be stronger
when we get together and pool
our ideas. People are going to have
to act on their own behalf and for
the students excluded from
Stanford. Come to the first
meeting of COST, at 7:00 p.m.
tonight in the Tresidder Small
Lounge (room 282).

You've heard the facts by now.
Tuition for undergraduates has
doubled in the last eight years,
rising from $1575 in 1966-67 to
next year's scheduled $3135. If
the recent ten percent rate of
increase continues, freshmen
entering this year will be paying a
$3800 tuition bill in their
graduating year.
The figures are fearsome.
Contrary to popular belief, not all
Stanford students are living off of
their parents or cushy financial
aids packages. How many students
are on work-study, have
part-time jobs, or work all
summer? How many more would

like to be financially independent
of their parents, or question
whether the financial burden they
place on themselves or their
family is worth it? How many
potential students of lower
income backgrounds never even
apply because the huge price tag
scares them off?
The answers to the above may
be difficult to quantify, but they
and other questions do need
answering. Why were freshmen
told before they enrolled that the
scheduled rate of tuition increase
was going to be six percent when
that rate isn't adhered to? Over
the past seven years, the rates
have been successively 8.5%
11.7%, 11.9%, 8.75%,* 8.75%,
9.2%, and next year 10%. This is
more than mere oversight or
miscalculation; it approaches
deception.
Market Impact
The administration's deciding
on tuition levels in November
before the final budget is
approved and actual expenditures
are known in March leads some
students to suspect that tuition is
set at what the market will bear
and not to simply meet the level
of income the university finds
necessary to acheive whatever
goals it has set for itself.

Students are graduating early
and spending quarters at other
schools or working to ease the
financial pressures, but most
students who have entered
Stanford eventually want to
graduate from here. Leaving
because you can't pay the price,
although you want to stay, is no
alternative.
What is all this leading to? Talk
is met by more talk. We don't
want sympathy; we want set
policies and actions from the
administration which will ease the
tuition crunch. We want to know
why tuition was raised ten
percent; "we need it," is not
sufficient (Provost Miller's three
word explanation). We want to
know what tuition is being used
for. Don't we as members of the
community deserve an
explanation?
The University must develop a
set of rational guidelines for
tuition that can be the subject of
constructive criticism. Financial
aids should be reviewed to insure
that tuition raises do not have
harmful affects on the
composition of the student body.
The Financial Aids Office could
develop deferred post-graduate
payment options through which
students could escape the

financial burden while still in
school.
These are the possibilities for
change. Their implementation
requires COST, the Coalition On
Student Tuition. Tuition can
continue to rise at these
unreasonable rates because the
administration feels that the rates
are reasonable and that students
will continue to pay increasing
amounts of money without much
more than a few grumblings. That
is why we must illustrate and
articulate our real situation and
feelings. COST is the mechanism.
Ask any administrator and he'll
tell you it's the squeaky wheel
that gets the grease. Within a
bureaucracy, a group must
organize to be heard. We can
change the outlook on tuition
decisions. COST already has
specific ideas for expressing
student dissatisfaction concerning
tuition, but we'll be stronger
when we get together and pool
our ideas. People are going to have
