Political Lesson
Editor:
One of the reasons that the
U.S. lost the war in Indochina is
that its military "intelligence"
could never figure out what was
going on there. Almost any part
of the Pentagon Papers makes this
clear.
For this reason I was pleased to
read the Daily's interview
(1/22/73) with Robert F. Turner,
the Hoover Institute's new
Vietnam specialist. Except for his
imperialist ideology and his ability
to lie about facts (how many
people were killed during the
bombing of Bach Mai Hospital?),
Turner's interview is remarkable
mainly for his display of blank
stupidity. We should all be
relieved that "intelligence" hasn't
learned anything.
But I do think that Turner's
abilities are being wasted here. I
hope he decides to go back to
Vietnam as a "civilian advisor." I
hope he is assigned to a hamlet
which he is sure is "secure."
Because then the Provisional
Revolutionary Government will
be able to teach him a lesson in
practical politics which he won't
have time to forget.

Engineering Flourishes
Editor:
The article about the interest
1972 seniors have in graduate
work is somewhat misleading
(Daily, Jan. 10). By omission it
would appear that there is little
interest on the part of Stanford
seniors in graduate work in
engineering. That is far from true.
The reason that engineering did
not appear in the article is that
the originators of the survey were
unable to cope with the
coterminal program and admit
that in the report.
The coterminal program
enables students to work
simultaneously for both B.S. and
M.S. degrees. A total of 36
students who received their B.S.
degrees during the 1971-72
academic year also received their
M.S. in engineering. A Placement
Center study indicates that 16
B.S. recipients will continue in
graduate work in engineering at
Stanford and nine B.S. engineers
will do graduate work elsewhere.
Further, 49 students who would
normally have received their B.S.
degrees by last June are still
enrolled in the coterminal
8.5.-M.S. program. Thus, there is
indeed great interest in graduate
work in engineering on the part of
Stanford undergraduates.

Parking Lot Expenditures
Editor:
The thought of parking lot
construction is disheartening to
those of us still struggling to
comprehend the reasons for the
dramatic tuition increases forseen
for the coming years. If they rest
in part in such needless
expenditures, I question the
intentions of those with power to
assess the economic priorities of
Stanford University.
Since the parking lot behind
Wilbur is indeed "never full," why
don't those people who cannot
find places near their destinations
park therein? A five or ten minute
walk is refreshing and enjoyable
exercise. Such activity might be
rewarding for those of Stanford's
sedentary employees whose
number of years employment here
is directly proportional to the
number of rolls of fat around
their middles.
My intent is not to insult
anyone, but to suggest a healthy
alternative to fighting for the
closest parking place. Clearly, The
Farm needs not another concrete
slab covering once grassy areas,
but an awakening of those of its
inhabitants who would ignore
asthetics and economics in favor
of unnecessary convenience.
