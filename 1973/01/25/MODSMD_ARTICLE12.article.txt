# 'hatchet job'
## 'I Am NOT An Imperialist' 
### 
3 robert 112. turner

I agreed to being interviewed
by your reporter after he
informed me that he was
interested in giving some balance
to a campus "with a left-wing
bias." I knew that my views
would not be popular, but felt
they might show some of our
more objective students that there
are two rational sides to the
Vietnam debate.
Clearly I wasted two hours of
my time and about 20 column
inches of your front page, as the
hatchet job which appeared in
Monday's Daily did not reflect my
views on Vietnam. In addition to
disassociating myself from the
story as a whole, I want to make a
few specific clarifications.
First of all, I am not a
"self-confessed . . . 'right-wing
crackpot' " and I do not— in spite
of your headline—advocate
"imperialist" policies. The original
context of both terms was clearly
ironic. I advocate an
anti-imperialist foreign
policy—opposing North Vietnam's
aggression against South Vietnam,
Laos and Cambodia, just as I
would have opposed Germany's
imperialism during World War 11.
Double Standard
My charge of a double-standard
in collecting funds to alleviate the
consequences of Vietnam
"atrocities" (of which the Daily is
as guilty as the Palo Alto City
Council) perhaps warrants
additional comment. The Bach
Mai hospital was damaged in an
air attack on a main petroleum
storage area which the North
Vietnamese had located only 200
yards from the hospital (Time, 8
January, p. 10). According to
Hanoi radio (VNA, 23 December),
all but one of the hospital's
patients escaped unharmed
(although several staff members

were reported killed).
While it is tragic that even one
patient was injured, this hardly
qualifies as "one of the worst
atrocities in a war filled with such
acts" (Daily editorial, 8 January).
One can wonder where the Daily's
concern was on 13 April 1972
when a Soviet tank reportedly
drove into an An Loc church
(Binh Long Province) in which
services were being held and killed
100 people, or later that night
when the North Vietnamese blew
away a clearly marked An Loc
hospital with mortar and artillery
fire—killing all of the patients
(UPI, 4 June 1972).
Hanoi radio (5 January)
claimed that 2,579 people were
killed or wounded in the 12-day
B-52 bombing of Hanoi. Even
accepting the North Vietnamese
figures (which in the past have not
been very reliable), this is
considerably fewer than the
number of South Vietnamese
citizens executed by the
communists in the city of Hue
during the 1968 Tet Offensive
(excluding battle casualties). To
condemn the United States for
what appear clearly to be
accidental casualties of military
operations, while ignoring literally
thousands of incidents in which
the communists have as a matter
of policy killed non-combatant
civilians appears to me to be a
double-standard.
Continued Struggle
I was quoted as saying that the
struggle for South Vietnam will
continue after a "cease-fire"
agreement is signed. Anyone
doubting this might benefit from
the article by Nguyen Khan Toan
in the November 1972 issue of
Hoc Tap (theoretical journal of
the Lao Dong Party in Hanoi).
Toan explained that it is

sometimes necessary to "step
backward temporarily" and
"accept a certain agreement with
the enemy .. . aimed at
weakening his forces and
increasing our forces," but noted
that "complete victory is the
unchanged path that our party
and people are following."
Finally, the last sentence in
your article is a misquotation and
misrepresents my views. I was
quoted as having said "I don't like
to be stereotyped or dismissed."
This should have read
" ... stereotyped and dismissed."
Your readers are, of course, free
to dismiss my views at their

pleasure and without causing the
least offense. My point to your
reporter—who had been trying to
associate my position with that of
some prominent individual or
organization—is that my views on
Vietnam are neither traditional
"hawk" nor "dove," and that to
stereotype and in so doing dismiss
them because of similarities with
previously encountered positions
is a mistake—//" one is seriously
interested in understanding my
position. Regrettably, your article
contributes little to such an
understanding.
