# The 						Tragedy Of Indochina: What Went Wrong?

(AP)—What went wrong for the United
States in Indochina?
How could intentions regarded at
the outset as honorable by most
Americans bring results that ultimately
would be widely denounced around
the world?
Historians will be a long time
probing the evidence. They are likely
to label a lot of key U.S. actions and
decisions as unqualified and
extravagantly costly blunders.
From the vantage point of
hindsight, some of the early judgments
already being made go something like
this:
1. Early alarm signals went
unheeded.
Early in the game, as Americans
began to get involved in a war they
didn't understand, some U.S. leaders
who would share responsibility for the
policy of involvement were themselves
fearful that the United States was
painting itself into a corner. Those
same leaders eventually helped wield
the painbrush.
Alarm Signal
An alarm signal came in November
1961 in a cable to President John F.
Kennedy from Gen. Maxwell Taylor.
Assessing the situation in Vietnam,
Taylor noted that an engagement of
U.S. prestige likely would be deepened
proportionately by the number of U.S.
troops committed.
If results were not achieved

quickly, he said, "it will be difficult to
resist the pressure to reinforce."
Another alarm was sounded that
same month by Defense Secretary
Robert S. McNamara. He told the
President in a memorandum that
introduction of a sizable U.S. force
would not have decisive effect, but
would make it almost certain that the
United States would "get increasingly
mired down in an inconclusive
struggle."
Unwinnable War
2. The United States, with its eyes
open, went into a war that by some
standards was unwinnable.
As late as June, 1965, after the big
escalation had started, a memorandum
by Secretary of State Dean Rusk
noted:
"Once we suffer large casualties we
will have started a well-nigh
irreversible process. Our involvement
will be so great that we cannot
without national humiliation stop
short of achieving our complete
objectives. Of the two possibilities, I
think humiliation would be the more
likely than achievement of our
objectives—even after we have paid
terrible costs."
3. U.S. Southeast Asia policy was
murky.
There was hardly any Southeast
Asia policy until Korea caused U.S.
planners to improvise hastily. What
resulted was closely connected to a
fear that another area might be "lost"
as China was "lost" to the
Communists.

The China episode had produced
political dynamite in the McCarthy
era. Thereafter, the reading of U.S.
cold war stakes became a matter of
assuming a world Communist goal to
gobble up Asia. When Lyndon B.
Johnson became president, he said he
would not be the man to see Southeast
Asia go "the way China went."
4. The United States was
embarassed by its own power.
Involvement in an undeclared war
meant war little by little, unsupported
by any homefront mobilization. The
expressed U.S. anxiety was to prevent
a wide war.
The Americans had power enough
to destroy all Vietnam at one blow
many times over, but could not and
would not use it. Thus, at the start,
the United States was getting itself
gradually drawn into a partial war,
limited to what were regarded as
minimal measures to stop the
Communists.
Confused
5. Americans were confused and
bewildered.
Until 1963, few Americans had any
idea where Indochina might be on the
map. They became acutely aware of it
with the crisis of November, 1963,
when President Ngo Dinh Diem was
assassinated. The Communists chose
that time of upheaval to step up
pressure. Gradually, Americans
became aware they were involed in a
shadowy, hit-and-run jungle guerrilla
conflict.

Americans were involved with an
Asian ally who could be the most
frustrating of partners. Early in the
game observers on the scene wondered
who was in charge: the U.S.
commander, the U.S. ambassador or
the mixed-up Saigon regime.
6. Prospective costs outweighed
U.S. interests and objectives.
Apparently, costs and interests
were out of balance. The United States
did not appear to have a clearly
defined objective other than keeping
the Communists out of control of the
South.
Vietnam Vital?
However, once the United States
pronounced Vietnam vital to its
interest, it seemed necessary to hold
on at any cost. Until recently, the idea
that Vietnam was vital to American
interests was automatically accepted
gospel in Washington.
7. There was a lack of coherent and
consistent strategy.
The strategy seemed just to grow,
with the increasing involvement. Soon
the United States was, figuratively
speaking, using sledgehammers to kill
fleas. Enormously expensive planes
and military hardware were committed
to flattening huts, blasting sampans
and attacking jungle shadows. It was
testimony both to the lack of
American experience in Southeast Asia
and a U.S. urge to apply technological
power to vexing problems.
Malaya Experience
8. The Americans failed to learn

from the Malaya experience of the
early 19505.
The insurgency on the Malay
Peninsula had been beaten by
clear-and-hold tactics, using the
guerrillas' own methods against them.
In Vietnam, the Americans relied on
enormous firepower, incredibly
powerful air fleets, a naval armada,
swarms of helicopters and jeeps and all
manner of other hardware.
In turn, this cataract of material
and men pouring into the little
country produced a social upheaval
and along with it all manner of
corruption.
The power also did considerable
propaganda harm through the
wrecking of villages, suffering inflicted
on civilians and bombing errors
causing heavy casualties.
9. The cost of bombing the North
balanced against its usefulness.
'Blunder'
Some competent observers say the
bombing of the North may have been
the greatest strategic blunder of the
war. With respect to impairing the
North's fighting capacity, the effect
seemed negligible.
In the long run the bombing
appeared to react against the United
States, first by hardening North
Vietnamese morale and then by
bringing down wide condemnation. If
the United States was trying to bomb
Hanoi to the negotiating table before
1968, the reality was that after that
year's Tet offensive the United States
itself was the one that was pushed in

the direction of the table.
10. The aim to make North
Vietnam pay dearly backfired.
The policy is regarded now by
many to have been counter-productive
and another error. The more price thp
Communists paid, the more stake they
had in sticking it out.
Open societies are no match for
totalitarian ones when it comes to
propaganda warfare. The North
Vietnamese were not obliged to be
responsible to an electorate. The
leaders could continue tenaciously to
try to justify the investment in their
ambition to rule the whole country.
Lost Goal
11. The Americans lost sight of
their immediate goal.
All presidents involved in the
Vietnam situation had said the U.S.
aim simply was to make it possible for
the South Vietnamese to choose their
own future without interference. The
Americans insisted it was the
Vietnamese who had to be responsible
for Vietnam.
The war progressed in an opposite
direction, however. The South
Vietnamese became all client, and for
a long time everything depended on
the Americans. South Vietnam's
presidents and politicians became
heavily dependent upon American
support.
At the same time, an American
stake developed in keeping the Saigon
regime in power, to an extent that it
seemed at times the Saigon tail was
wagging the U.S. dog.
