# Textbooks Lag In Recognizing Occupational Equality Of Sexes
## 
### 
While elementary and high
school textbooks have been slow
to recognize the occupational
equality of men and women, most
publishers are now closing the
gap, a veteran educator here is
convinced.
Paul R. Hanna, emeritus holder
of the Lee L. Jacks Professorship
of Child Education and emeritus
director of the Stanford
International Development
Education Center (SIDEC), has
long been an adviser to local,
state, and federal agencies as well
as to foreign governments.
"There has been a variety of
reasons for the textbook lag," he
claims. "Cost-conscious publishers
were often reluctant to make
expensive changes in new editions
without assurance that schools
would buy.
"The lack of a coordinated
attack on the problem by both
the educational and the publishing
establishments, and the male
superiority syndrome in
thenational culture itself" also
contributed to this lag.
Busy Life
Hanna, who officially retired a
few years ago, still maintains a
busy personal and professional life
as a senior author for two major
publishing firms and as a
worldwide consultant on
educational problems. He recently
was appointed by the White
House to the U.S. National
Commission for UNESCO.
He first began studying
"cultural lag" in school textbooks
25 years ago and came to the
conclusion that most texts were at
least a decade behind the accepted
generalizations of the geographer,
the economist, and the physicist.
"Then," he said, "we found

another 10-year lag occurring in
the courses of study behind the
textbooks because the textbooks
generally set the pace for the
curriculum."
"If the schools adopt new texts
and don't promptly get around to
changing the course of study," he
continued, "by the time they do
modify the curriculum, it's
probably 20 years behind what
the historians, the humanists, and
the sociologists are saying is
reality."
Role Choice
"But the concept that both
men and women should be free to
choose between homemaking and
professional roles (or engage in
both if that can be managed) was
a subject of discussion more than
10 years ago in school faculties
and in curriculum committee
meetings," Hanna said.
"And this pluralistic concept
of sex and jobs was certainly
anticipated by most authors and
editors of American textbooks."
Furthermore, there was
considerable resistance to change
on the part of the publishers'
stable of artists. "You can't show
women doctors, lawyers,
engineers, and truck drivers," one
told him.
Hanna once urged that, in a
social studies textbook he wrote
on rural life, the artist depict the
farm wife as an integral
part—helping with the chores and
the crops as well as performing
the traditional role of
housekeeper and mother.
Artist's Picture
"But the artist came up with
pictures of the farm wife in her
'Sunday-go-to-meetin' hat,
wearing white dress gloves as she
picked vegetables."

The illustrator explained, "We
want to show children the highest
standards of respectability of
dress."
They may be some justification
for this lag, Hanna things, because
the school serves society as a
conservator as well as an
innovator—somewhat like the
governor on an engine that
prevents the engine from running
too fast.
But the fact remains that
"many textbooks still lag behind
the 'frontier thinkers,' " in failing
to present the change in status.
"The present pluralism must
show the variety of choices a
female should have in selecting an
occupation or profession. This is
very important," he said.
Newer Texts
The newer texts already reflect
this emphasis on plurality of role
choice. "Pluralism is one of the
secrets of our society's success,"
Hanna said.
He expressed the hope that,
school texts would maintain a
balanced presentation of the
occupational roles of both men
and women.
"If textbooks are tipped all the
way toward the more extreme
'women's lib' movement," he said,
"they could become just as biased
as those reflecting previous
centuries of male domination."
Hanna believes that texts will
emphasize that a choice of
life-styles does and should exist.
"If one listens only to the
'way-out lib-movement,' " he said,
"one might think that every
woman has to be a professional
person or not be acceoted by
family and society.
"With this point of view, I
disagree entirely. Some women
have the desire and talent for
occupational careers; some don't.
"It's time for us to cease
encouraging every girl child to
conform to the life-style pattern
advocated so adamantly by
some."
Hanna added a word of caution
about the possibility of backlash
from the more strident
proponents of the women's
movement: "Part of the secret of
moving society forward is
knowing when to take off the
pressure."
