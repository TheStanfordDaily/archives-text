(AP)â€”U.S. Ambassador Clinton E.
Knox, seized at gunpoint Tuesday
afternoon, was released yesterday
in exchange for the freedom of 12
prisoners and payment of
$70,000.
The ambassador and consul
General Ward Christianson, who
was held with him, were freed at
the airport where their captors
prepared to board a plane with
the released prisoners to fly to
Mexico.
Arrangements for freeing the
two American diplomats were
announced earlier by Haitian
Information Secretary Fritz
Cineaf. The release, however, took
place earlier than originally
foreseen.
Knox was seized at gunpoint
late Tuesday. Kidnapers stopped
his car on its way to the embassy
residence.
During the evening Knox
telephoned Christianson, who
went to the residence on the
outskirts of Port au Prince.
Cineaf said the 12 prisoners
would be flown to Mexico aboard

an Air Haiti 047 plane along with
five kidnapers. They were to be
accompanied by French
Ambassador Bernard Dorin, the
papal emissary Luigi Barbito, and
Mexican Ambassador Armando
Duran. The diplomats acted as
intermediaries in negotiation with
the kidnapers.
Cineaf said the kidnapers
originally demanded the release of
31 prisoners and payment of
$500,000 by the U.S.
avernment. The $70,000
payment agreed upon was to be
made by the Haitian government,
he said.
