# Engineer Appointed Director Of Facilities
## 
### 
James E. Nelson, 32, formerly
of Memorex Corp., has been
appointed new director of
facilities and properties here.
The announcement was made
by Robert R. Augsburger,
vice-president for business and
finance, who said that Nelson's
duties will include the
administration of Stanford's
lands, outside properties, and
"certain general engineering
functions."
"With the heavy building
component in the current
Campaign for Stanford and my
office's recent assumption of
responsibility for Medical Center
facilities planning, this
organizational move is being made
to strengthen our managerial and
technical skills and to provide an
orderly administrative transition
in anticipation of Director of
Facilities Dwight Adams'
retirement next year,"
Augsburger's announcement said.
Nelson was director of
corporate facilities and
administrative services for
Memorex, a position which
entailed responsibilities for
facilities, real estate, advance
planning, engineering, and
telecommunication services.
Prior to that Nelson was
manager of general industrial
engineering for IBM Corp. He
holds a B.S. degree in industrial
engineering from the General
Motors Institute of Technology
and memberships in the American
Institutes of Plant Engineers and
Industrial Engineers.
Nelson will report directly to
Augsburger on matters involving

general administration, land
resources, construction and
engineering, and planning.
He is the son of Mr. and Mrs.
Paul E. Nelson of Muskegon
Heights, Mich. He attended
Muskegon High and Muskegon
Community College before
choosing General Motors Institute
over the University of Michigan.
General Motors Institute,
founded in 1919, is a five-year
institution granting a wide variety
of engineering degrees. Very
selective, it admits about one of
every 2,000 applicants.
While it charges tuition, it also
features a work-study plan in
which the students draw pay
while studying and interning in
every department in every GM
plant in and around Flint, Mich.
The school operates year rou id
on a five-and-a-half-day schedule.
While the expectation at GMI
is that each graduate will plan a
career with General Motors, many
of its graduates have gone into
professional service elsewhere,
Nelson explained.
