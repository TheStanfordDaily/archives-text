# General Testifies In Ellsberg Trial
## 
### ED KOHN 
Special to the Daily
LOS ANGELES - While the talk in
most of the country was of the
impending Vietnam cease-fire,
yesterday's testimony in the
"Pentagon Papers" trial focused on the
American military presence there since
the early 1960'5.
Brig. Gen. Paul F. Gorman, one of
the authors of the "Papers," testified
that the release of the formerly "Top

Secret" documents could have helped
foreign intelligence analysts build a
damaging dossier on Henry Cabot
Lodge, former U.S. Ambassador at the
Paris peace talks. Prior to his service in
Paris, Lodge served as American
ambassador to South Vietnam during
the 1963 American-supported
overthrow of then South Vietnamese
President Ngo Dinh Diem.
Testifying for the second day,
Gorman cited numerous examples of

material that he said could be useful to
other nations' intelligence operations.
In a long narrative punctuated by
frequent defense objections, Gorman
explained various references to Col.
Edwin Landsale's psychological
warfare operations, several central
intelligence agency sponsored
counterinsurgency programs, and the
''Strategic Hamlet" and
"Vietnam ization" programs.
Gorman, who holds a master's

degree in international relations from
Harvard University and who served
two tours of duty in Vietnam prior to
a 1968 assignment as an aide to the
U.S. military advisor at the Paris peace
talks, told the court that despite the
age of the material in the "Papers,"
intelligence analysts could have found
most of it useful in 1969.
In his testimony Tuesday, Gorman
termed the "Papers" "an authoritative
survey of the war" which he said
revealed the "thinking of the U.S.
government at the highest levels."
Gorman, who was the
highest-ranking military official
attached to the task force that
prepared the "Papers," testified in
civilian clothes, as did Lt. Gen. William
DePuy, whose cross-examination
ended Tuesday.
Dr. Daniel Ellsberg, 41, and
Anthony J. Russo Jr., 36, both former
Rand Corp. analysts, face a total of 15
counts of conspiracy, espionage and
theft of government property for
duplicating and distributing portions
of the three "Top-Secret" documents
between March 1, 1969 and Sept. 30,
1970.
Ellsberg and Russo are not charged
with "leaking" the documents to the
New York Times or other newspapers
but rather with duplicating and
distributing them to two unindicted
"coconspirators," neither of whom
had security clearances. No one has
been charged with "leaking" the
"Papers" to the newspapers.
If convicted on all counts, Ellsberg
faces a lib-year jail term, while Russo
could serve a 35-year sentence.
In order to prove its espionage case
against Ellsberg and Russo, the
government must convince the jurors
that the release of the three
documents did indeed harm the
"national interest." Prosecutor David
Nissen's questioning of government
witnesses thus far has been directed
towards proving this allegation.
Despite the fact that the "Papers"
were entered into evidence Tuesday,
the four "diplomatic" volumes
remained almost unavailable for public
inspection because presiding Judge
Matt Byrne Jr.'s ruling that the
defense is still prohibited from making
them available to reporters.
Spectators and reporters read the
four volumes for about 20 minutes
yesterday afternoon, and have asked
the court clerk to make them available

for public inspection early Monday
morning before the day's proceedings
begin.
Frank A. Bartimo, who was ordered
to produce one or more defense
department reports of alleged damage
caused by publication of the "Papers,"
was unable to produce them in court
yesterday, and an angry Byrne ordered
him to produce them first thing Friday
morning.
During a noontime recess, Ellsberg
said that the release of the "Papers"
had helped shorten the Vietnam War.
"I think it was one of thousands of
acts by thousands and millions of
people who acted to resist this war and
who helped bring it to an end. And I
think all those people, and I'm one of
them, and Tony (Russo) is another,
are feeling proud today that we did no
less than we did," he said.
Ellsberg termed the cease-fire
agreement "a victory for the people of
this country."
"The People's wishes for peace have
prevailed and we can rejoice for the
people of Indochina who will no
longer be bombed by us and rejoice
for the children of this country," he
said.
The trial will be in recess today in
honor of the late President Johnson. It
will resume Friday morning, with
Gorman again on the witness stand.
