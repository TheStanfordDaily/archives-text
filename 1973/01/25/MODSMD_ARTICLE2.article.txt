# General Testifies In Ellsberg Trial
## 
### ED KOHN 
Special to the Daily
LOS ANGELES - While the talk in
most of the country was of the
impending Vietnam cease-fire,
yesterday's testimony in the
"Pentagon Papers" trial focused on the
American military presence there since
the early 1960'5.
Brig. Gen. Paul F. Gorman, one of
the authors of the "Papers," testified
that the release of the formerly "Top

Secret" documents could have helped
foreign intelligence analysts build a
damaging dossier on Henry Cabot
Lodge, former U.S. Ambassador at the
Paris peace talks. Prior to his service in
Paris, Lodge served as American
ambassador to South Vietnam during
the 1963 American-supported
overthrow of then South Vietnamese
President Ngo Dinh Diem.
Testifying for the second day,
Gorman cited numerous examples of

material that he said could be useful to
other nations' intelligence operations.
In a long narrative punctuated by
frequent defense objections, Gorman
explained various references to Col.
Edwin Landsale's psychological
warfare operations, several central
intelligence agency sponsored
counterinsurgency programs, and the
''Strategic Hamlet" and
"Vietnam ization" programs.
Gorman, who holds a master's

degree in international relations from
Harvard University and who served
two tours of duty in Vietnam prior to
a 1968 assignment as an aide to the
U.S. military advisor at the Paris peace
talks, told the court that despite the
age of the material in the "Papers,"
intelligence analysts could have found
most of it useful in 1969.
In his testimony Tuesday, Gorman
termed the "Papers" "an authoritative
survey of the war" which he said
revealed the "thinking of the U.S.
government at the highest levels."
Gorman, who was the
highest-ranking military official
attached to the task force that
prepared the "Papers," testified in
civilian clothes, as did Lt. Gen. William
DePuy, whose cross-examination
ended Tuesday.
Dr. Daniel Ellsberg, 41, and
Anthony J. Russo Jr., 36, both former
Rand Corp. analysts, face a total of 15
counts of conspiracy, espionage and
theft of government property for
duplicating and distributing portions
of the three "Top-Secret" documents
between March 1, 1969 and Sept. 30,
1970.
