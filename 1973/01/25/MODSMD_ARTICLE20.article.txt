# State Panel To Study Minority Hiring
## 
### 
LOS ANGELES (AP) - State
university and college trustees
decided yesterday to form a
special 12-man panel to consider
whether more women and
minority members should be hired
on the system's 19 campuses.
The group was formed on a
recommendation from the board
of trustees' committee on faculty
and staff affairs, which earlier
discussed hiring guidelines set
down by the Department of
Health, Education and Welfare.
Recommendations from the
committee are to be presented to
the board's July 1973 meeting.
The trustees, campus
presidents, the statewide academic
senate, the support staff of the
system, student body presidents
and the chancellor's staff will each
have two members on the
committee.
In a report on hiring, vice
Chancellor C. Mansel Keene
voiced opposition to several of the

federal guidelines, but said he
supported the concept of equal
opportunity hiring.
He said an investigation of
hiring practices at some campuses
"revealed some examples of
overzealousness and in every such
instance campuses were advised to
correct the situation.
"We reject practices that would
use affirmative action programs
dishonestly as an excuse when
making negative personnel
decisions involving Caucasians; or
as a crutch in making preferential
personnel decisions on behalf of
minorities or women that would
otherwise not have been made."
Chancellor Glenn S. Dumke
said, "We encourage affirmative
action, but not to the exclusion of
other applicants." In 1971, the
system had 25,138 employees,
with 21,733 identified as
Caucasians, 3405 as minority
group members and 8860 as

women.
Kenne criticized the federal
guidelines as being vague,
burdensome, and philosophically
questionable.
In other action, the trustees
voted to urge Gov. Ronald Reagan
and the legislature to provide

faculty salary increase of 7.5
percent and fringe benefit increase
of 4.7 percent.
Officials said the governor's
budget has an $18.9 million
appropriation for the salary
increases, but does not provide for
the fringe benefit increases.

committee are to be presented to
the board's July 1973 meeting.
The trustees, campus
presidents, the statewide academic
senate, the support staff of the
system, student body presidents
and the chancellor's staff will each
have two members on the
committee.
In a report on hiring, vice
Chancellor C. Mansel Keene
voiced opposition to several of the

federal guidelines, but said he
supported the concept of equal
opportunity hiring.
He said an investigation of
hiring practices at some campuses
"revealed some examples of
overzealousness and in every such
instance campuses were advised to
correct the situation.
"We reject practices that would
use affirmative action programs
dishonestly as an excuse when
making negative personnel
decisions involving Caucasians; or
as a crutch in making preferential
personnel decisions on behalf of
minorities or women that would
otherwise not have been made."
Chancellor Glenn S. Dumke
said, "We encourage affirmative
action, but not to the exclusion of
other applicants." In 1971, the
system had 25,138 employees,
with 21,733 identified as
Caucasians, 3405 as minority
group members and 8860 as

women.
Kenne criticized the federal
guidelines as being vague,
burdensome, and philosophically
questionable.
In other action, the trustees
voted to urge Gov. Ronald Reagan
and the legislature to provide

faculty salary increase of 7.5
percent and fringe benefit increase
of 4.7 percent.
Officials said the governor's
budget has an $18.9 million
appropriation for the salary
increases, but does not provide for
the fringe benefit increases.
