# Student Fees Questioned

SACRAMENTO (AP) - A
California lawmaker angered by
students who said they would
send $1200 in student fees to
North Vietnam introduced a bill
yesterday to make such fees
voluntary - not mandatory.
Assemblyman Ray Johnson
(R-Chico), said in a news release
that he was "gravely disturbed
and affronted" by student body
officers at California State
University at Chico who said last
week they would send the $1200
to North Vietnam.
Under Johnson's bill, student

fees would be made voluntary and
this would "terminate the
possibility of compulsory funds
being allocated to causes that
were repugnant to university
students.
"Student body officers are
complaining they do not have
enough revenue to meet their
needs," Johnson said. "But that
can hardly be so if they can
allocate a substantial share of
their fund not only to what I
consider a distasteful purpose, but
to one that is certainly extraneous
to affairs on a college campus."
