Vietnam Prepares For Truce
SAIGON - The warring sides in South Vietnam appeared
to be redoubling their efforts yesterday to gain footholds
for the cease-fire and the impending political struggle that
President Nguyen Van Thieu warned will be as difficult
and dangerous as the war.
Increased battlefield action and a variety of other
indicators showed the Communist command moving to
consolidate its position in areas now contested or
controlled by its troops, allied officials said.
The Saigon government was reported planning a
security crackdown for the weekend before the cease-fire
which begins officially at 8 a.m. Sunday Saigon time. That
is 7 p.m. EST Saturday.
One report from a senior government source said a
two-day curfew will be imposed in the countryside and
smaller cities in contested areas to strengthen the
government's control and head off last-minute armed
activity by the North Vietnamese and local guerilla forces.
The South Vietnamese military command reported 95
Viet Cong initiated incidents across the country in the 24
hours ending about dawn yesterday, the most since Jan. 6.
Senior South Vietnamese commanders had earlier
predicted just such a "high point," citing intelligence
reports that showed the Communist command would
launch one more major effort to gain territory and control
of population before the cease-fire takes hold.
The Saigon command reported 112 Viet Cong attacks
in the 24 hours ended at dawn today, about three-fourths
of them with rockets and mortars. A communique said 61
Viet Cong soldiers were killed in four significant fights at
a cost of six South Vietnamese killed and 39 wounded.
In a 45-minute cease-fire address to the nation, Thieu
declared that "the Communists do not have good will or
peace. Therefore, as I have frequently told you, no
agreement will provide a 100 percent guarantee for peace
and no international body may be considered to be able
to give us a 100 percent guarantee for peace."
U.S. and South Vietnamese aircraft continued normal
operations. But U.S. sources indicated American bombing
would begin tapering off today, although some strikes
probably will be flown until just before the truce
deadline. They said it also is likely that American military
advisers in the field with South Vietnamese units and
assigned to provincial and districts teams will begin pulling
out in the next few days.
Johnson Lies In Stale
WASHINGTON — Lyndon B. Johnson returned in death
yesterday to a capital preparing for the peace he sought so
long.
His coffin was borne in military splendor down
Constitution Avenue — from near the White House to the
Capitol — the twin edifices of his power for more than 30
years.
His flag-draped coffin was to lie in state in the Rotunda
of the Capitol for an 18-hour, final farewell by the people
he served as congressman, senator, vice president and
president.
Washington still bore the signs of the second
inauguration, only four days earlier, of Richard Nixon,
who succeeded Johnson as the 37th President.
Nixon, who had only hours earlier announced the
initialing of a peace agreement with Vietnam, rode with
Mrs. Nixon in the funeral procession.
Mrs. Johnson, their two daughters and sons-in-law had
accompanied the body of the nation's 36th President

from Austin, Tex., to Washington. They flew aboard the
presidential jet — the same plane on which Johnson took
his presidential oath on Nov. 22, 1963, after the
assassination of President John F. Kennedy.
Only a month ago, Johnson had attended the
lying-in-state in Independence, Mo., of another former
Democratic president, Harry S Truman.
Judge Censures Republicans
WASHINGTON — The judge in the Watergate political
espionage trial said from the bench yesterday that
Republicans have no right to buy Democratic telephones
or burglarize their opponents' offices.
"The Republican National Committee is just another
political organization," U.S. District Judge John J. Sirica
said after the jury had left the courtroom.
"They don't have all the rights of the world. What do
you think they would be saying if the Democrats did it to
them?" Sirica asked defense attorney Gerald Alch.
"Any decent American, whether you happen to be a
Democrat or Republican, deplores this kind of conduct,"
Sirica said. "I know it and you know it."
Sirica, who said he is a Republican, made the remarks
after hearing Alch argue for the right to offer a defense
that James W. McCord Jr. was justified in breaking into
the Democratic Party headquarters last year and bugging
telephone lines.
Alch has contended that McCord was acting under
justifiable fears that Republicans, including President
Nixon, were in danger from violent demonstrations staged
by what he called radical groups linked to the Democrats.
Sirica indicated that he would deny Alch's request for
jury instructions stating that such a defense is valid. He
said a written rejection would be issued later.
Homosexuals File Bias Suit
SAN FRANCISCO — A class action suit seeking to end
what it contends is a federal practice of firing employees
who are homosexuals was filed Wednesday in U.S. District
Court.
The suit brought by Donald W. Hickerson and the
Society for Individual Rights, a homosexual organization
with 1300 members, named the heads of the U.S. Civil
Service Commission, its appeal board and Agriculture
department officials as defendants.
Hickerson, 25, contends he first was suspended
without pay and later fired as a supply clerk with the
agriculture department's consumer marketing service here
for violating a civil service regulation requiring dismissal
for "criminal, infamous, dishonest, immoral or
notoriously disgraceful conduct."
The suit further contends Hickerson was fired because,
through evidence obtained in Army records, he allegedly
had engaged in "private, consentual, noncriminal
homosexual conduct and showed no desire to be
rehabilitated."
The suit asked the court to reinstate Hickerson and
others and reimburse them for lost pay. The court also
was asked to declare the federal policy invalid and grant
injunctions in cases where employees are threatened with
dismissal solely on the basis of being a homosexual.

The Saigon command reported 112 Viet Cong attacks
in the 24 hours ended at dawn today, about three-fourths
of them with rockets and mortars. A communique said 61
Viet Cong soldiers were killed in four significant fights at
a cost of six South Vietnamese killed and 39 wounded.
In a 45-minute cease-fire address to the nation, Thieu
declared that "the Communists do not have good will or
peace. Therefore, as I have frequently told you, no
agreement will provide a 100 percent guarantee for peace
and no international body may be considered to be able
to give us a 100 percent guarantee for peace."
U.S. and South Vietnamese aircraft continued normal
operations. But U.S. sources indicated American bombing
would begin tapering off today, although some strikes
probably will be flown until just before the truce
deadline. They said it also is likely that American military
advisers in the field with South Vietnamese units and
assigned to provincial and districts teams will begin pulling
out in the next few days.
Johnson Lies In Stale
WASHINGTON — Lyndon B. Johnson returned in death
yesterday to a capital preparing for the peace he sought so
long.
His coffin was borne in military splendor down
Constitution Avenue — from near the White House to the
Capitol — the twin edifices of his power for more than 30
years.
His flag-draped coffin was to lie in state in the Rotunda
of the Capitol for an 18-hour, final farewell by the people
he served as congressman, senator, vice president and
president.
Washington still bore the signs of the second
inauguration, only four days earlier, of Richard Nixon,
who succeeded Johnson as the 37th President.
Nixon, who had only hours earlier announced the
initialing of a peace agreement with Vietnam, rode with
Mrs. Nixon in the funeral procession.
Mrs. Johnson, their two daughters and sons-in-law had
accompanied the body of the nation's 36th President

from Austin, Tex., to Washington. They flew aboard the
presidential jet — the same plane on which Johnson took
his presidential oath on Nov. 22, 1963, after the
assassination of President John F. Kennedy.
Only a month ago, Johnson had attended the
lying-in-state in Independence, Mo., of another former
Democratic president, Harry S Truman.
Judge Censures Republicans
WASHINGTON — The judge in the Watergate political
espionage trial said from the bench yesterday that
Republicans have no right to buy Democratic telephones
or burglarize their opponents' offices.
"The Republican National Committee is just another
political organization," U.S. District Judge John J. Sirica
said after the jury had left the courtroom.
"They don't have all the rights of the world. What do
you think they would be saying if the Democrats did it to
them?" Sirica asked defense attorney Gerald Alch.
"Any decent American, whether you happen to be a
Democrat or Republican, deplores this kind of conduct,"
Sirica said. "I know it and you know it."
Sirica, who said he is a Republican, made the remarks
after hearing Alch argue for the right to offer a defense
that James W. McCord Jr. was justified in breaking into
the Democratic Party headquarters last year and bugging
telephone lines.
Alch has contended that McCord was acting under
justifiable fears that Republicans, including President
Nixon, were in danger from violent demonstrations staged
by what he called radical groups linked to the Democrats.
Sirica indicated that he would deny Alch's request for
jury instructions stating that such a defense is valid. He
said a written rejection would be issued later.
Homosexuals File Bias Suit
SAN FRANCISCO — A class action suit seeking to end
what it contends is a federal practice of firing employees
who are homosexuals was filed Wednesday in U.S. District
Court.
The suit brought by Donald W. Hickerson and the
Society for Individual Rights, a homosexual organization
with 1300 members, named the heads of the U.S. Civil
Service Commission, its appeal board and Agriculture
department officials as defendants.
Hickerson, 25, contends he first was suspended
without pay and later fired as a supply clerk with the
agriculture department's consumer marketing service here
for violating a civil service regulation requiring dismissal
for "criminal, infamous, dishonest, immoral or
notoriously disgraceful conduct."
The suit further contends Hickerson was fired because,
through evidence obtained in Army records, he allegedly
had engaged in "private, consentual, noncriminal
homosexual conduct and showed no desire to be
rehabilitated."
The suit asked the court to reinstate Hickerson and
others and reimburse them for lost pay. The court also
was asked to declare the federal policy invalid and grant
injunctions in cases where employees are threatened with
dismissal solely on the basis of being a homosexual.

Vietnam Prepares For Truce
SAIGON - The warring sides in South Vietnam appeared
to be redoubling their efforts yesterday to gain footholds
for the cease-fire and the impending political struggle that
President Nguyen Van Thieu warned will be as difficult
and dangerous as the war.
Increased battlefield action and a variety of other
indicators showed the Communist command moving to
consolidate its position in areas now contested or
controlled by its troops, allied officials said.
The Saigon government was reported planning a
security crackdown for the weekend before the cease-fire
which begins officially at 8 a.m. Sunday Saigon time. That
is 7 p.m. EST Saturday.
One report from a senior government source said a
two-day curfew will be imposed in the countryside and
smaller cities in contested areas to strengthen the
government's control and head off last-minute armed
activity by the North Vietnamese and local guerilla forces.
The South Vietnamese military command reported 95
Viet Cong initiated incidents across the country in the 24
hours ending about dawn yesterday, the most since Jan. 6.
Senior South Vietnamese commanders had earlier
predicted just such a "high point," citing intelligence
reports that showed the Communist command would
launch one more major effort to gain territory and control

Capitol — the twin edifices of his power for more than 30
years.
His flag-draped coffin was to lie in state in the Rotunda
of the Capitol for an 18-hour, final farewell by the people
he served as congressman, senator, vice president and
president.
Washington still bore the signs of the second
inauguration, only four days earlier, of Richard Nixon,
who succeeded Johnson as the 37th President.
Nixon, who had only hours earlier announced the
initialing of a peace agreement with Vietnam, rode with
Mrs. Nixon in the funeral procession.
Mrs. Johnson, their two daughters and sons-in-law had
accompanied the body of the nation's 36th President

from Austin, Tex., to Washington. They flew aboard the
presidential jet — the same plane on which Johnson took
his presidential oath on Nov. 22, 1963, after the
assassination of President John F. Kennedy.
Only a month ago, Johnson had attended the
lying-in-state in Independence, Mo., of another former
Democratic president, Harry S Truman.
Judge Censures Republicans
WASHINGTON — The judge in the Watergate political
espionage trial said from the bench yesterday that
Republicans have no right to buy Democratic telephones
or burglarize their opponents' offices.
"The Republican National Committee is just another
political organization," U.S. District Judge John J. Sirica
said after the jury had left the courtroom.
"They don't have all the rights of the world. What do
you think they would be saying if the Democrats did it to
them?" Sirica asked defense attorney Gerald Alch.
"Any decent American, whether you happen to be a
Democrat or Republican, deplores this kind of conduct,"
Sirica said. "I know it and you know it."
Sirica, who said he is a Republican, made the remarks
after hearing Alch argue for the right to offer a defense
that James W. McCord Jr. was justified in breaking into
the Democratic Party headquarters last year and bugging
telephone lines.
Alch has contended that McCord was acting under
justifiable fears that Republicans, including President
Nixon, were in danger from violent demonstrations staged
by what he called radical groups linked to the Democrats.
Sirica indicated that he would deny Alch's request for
jury instructions stating that such a defense is valid. He
said a written rejection would be issued later.
Homosexuals File Bias Suit
SAN FRANCISCO — A class action suit seeking to end
what it contends is a federal practice of firing employees
who are homosexuals was filed Wednesday in U.S. District
Court.
The suit brought by Donald W. Hickerson and the
Society for Individual Rights, a homosexual organization
with 1300 members, named the heads of the U.S. Civil
Service Commission, its appeal board and Agriculture
department officials as defendants.
Hickerson, 25, contends he first was suspended
without pay and later fired as a supply clerk with the
agriculture department's consumer marketing service here
for violating a civil service regulation requiring dismissal
for "criminal, infamous, dishonest, immoral or
notoriously disgraceful conduct."
The suit further contends Hickerson was fired because,
through evidence obtained in Army records, he allegedly
had engaged in "private, consentual, noncriminal
homosexual conduct and showed no desire to be
rehabilitated."
The suit asked the court to reinstate Hickerson and
others and reimburse them for lost pay. The court also
was asked to declare the federal policy invalid and grant
injunctions in cases where employees are threatened with
dismissal solely on the basis of being a homosexual.
Today's Weather
Partly cloudy with chance of showers today. Clearing
tonight and mostly fair tomorrow. Low tonight in the 30s
to low 40s. Highs today and tomorrow in upper 40s to
low 50s. Southerly wind 10 to 20 mph becoming
northwest today. Chance of rain 40 percent today.
Vietnam Prepares For Truce
SAIGON - The warring sides in South Vietnam appeared
to be redoubling their efforts yesterday to gain footholds
for the cease-fire and the impending political struggle that
President Nguyen Van Thieu warned will be as difficult
and dangerous as the war.
Increased battlefield action and a variety of other
indicators showed the Communist command moving to
consolidate its position in areas now contested or
controlled by its troops, allied officials said.
The Saigon government was reported planning a
security crackdown for the weekend before the cease-fire
which begins officially at 8 a.m. Sunday Saigon time. That
is 7 p.m. EST Saturday.
One report from a senior government source said a
two-day curfew will be imposed in the countryside and
smaller cities in contested areas to strengthen the
government's control and head off last-minute armed
activity by the North Vietnamese and local guerilla forces.
The South Vietnamese military command reported 95
Viet Cong initiated incidents across the country in the 24
hours ending about dawn yesterday, the most since Jan. 6.
Senior South Vietnamese commanders had earlier
predicted just such a "high point," citing intelligence
reports that showed the Communist command would
launch one more major effort to gain territory and control
of population before the cease-fire takes hold.
The Saigon command reported 112 Viet Cong attacks
in the 24 hours ended at dawn today, about three-fourths
of them with rockets and mortars. A communique said 61
Viet Cong soldiers were killed in four significant fights at
a cost of six South Vietnamese killed and 39 wounded.
In a 45-minute cease-fire address to the nation, Thieu
declared that "the Communists do not have good will or
peace. Therefore, as I have frequently told you, no
agreement will provide a 100 percent guarantee for peace
and no international body may be considered to be able
to give us a 100 percent guarantee for peace."
U.S. and South Vietnamese aircraft continued normal
operations. But U.S. sources indicated American bombing
would begin tapering off today, although some strikes
probably will be flown until just before the truce
deadline. They said it also is likely that American military
advisers in the field with South Vietnamese units and
assigned to provincial and districts teams will begin pulling
out in the next few days.
Johnson Lies In Stale
