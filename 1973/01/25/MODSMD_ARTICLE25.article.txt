# Stanford-In-Business Provides Summer Internship Opportunities
## 
### LARRY FLEECE 
Stanford-in-Business (SIB), a
newly-formed non-profit organization,
seeks to provide interested
undergraduate students with summer
internship positions in corporate
businesses.
"Most students are only vaguely
familiar with the American corporate
business structure," explained Bob
Larson, SIB director.
"The only way to increase their
understanding is by providing
exposure to business-oriented
positions and management experience.
This is our goal."
Larson, a senior economics major,
suggested that the general concept of
the American corporation is both
"mysterious" and "terrifying," and
that as a result students are often
reluctant to approach businesses for
employment.
But Larson stressed that his group
seeks to attract businesses representing
a wide range of student interests. "Our
program is geared toward helping
students who are still unsure of what
they want to do," Larson said.

Over the past two quarters Larson
and his staff of seven students have
worked through the Placement Center,
using its mailing list and other sources
to actively solicit the interest of
private corporations in their program.
"I'm very optimistic this year,"
Larson said, "for two reasons. First,
the national economic situation is
much better than it was a few years
ago. Second, we have been earnestly
and actively soliciting job offers,
rather than waiting for them to come
to us. I expect our work to pay off."
Larson said that any estimate of the
number of jobs which will be made
available "would be just a ball-park
guess," but he expected good results
from industries concerned with
management training programs. As
examples of these, he cited General
Motors, U.S. Steel, and many oil
companies, banking firms, and airlines.
In addition, he expressed the hope
that job offers would open up 'n
corporations outside of private
industry, such as those dealing with
public affairs.
SIB operates from an office on the

second floor of the old Firehouse,
where applications are made available
to students at no charge.
The applications will be reviewed
by Larson's staff, and then channeled
to appropriate corporations,
depending on the student's interests.
SIB will further aid in setting up
interviews, if they are requested by the
corporation, and will act as general
liaison between student and potential
employer.
"The whole purpose," Larson said,
"is simply to bring the student and the
corporation together. They each have
something to offer."
On Monday, SIB will be
represented in a summer employment
panel, to be held in the Tresidder
Large Lounge from 4-6 p.m. At this
public discussion, various campus
groups will describe the services they
offer in aiding students to find
summer employment.

second floor of the old Firehouse,
where applications are made available
to students at no charge.
The applications will be reviewed
by Larson's staff, and then channeled
to appropriate corporations,
depending on the student's interests.
SIB will further aid in setting up
interviews, if they are requested by the
corporation, and will act as general
liaison between student and potential
employer.
"The whole purpose," Larson said,
"is simply to bring the student and the
corporation together. They each have
something to offer."
On Monday, SIB will be
represented in a summer employment
panel, to be held in the Tresidder
Large Lounge from 4-6 p.m. At this
public discussion, various campus
groups will describe the services they
offer in aiding students to find
summer employment.

Stanford-in-Business (SIB), a
newly-formed non-profit organization,
seeks to provide interested
undergraduate students with summer
internship positions in corporate
businesses.
"Most students are only vaguely
familiar with the American corporate
business structure," explained Bob
Larson, SIB director.
"The only way to increase their
understanding is by providing
exposure to business-oriented
positions and management experience.
This is our goal."
Larson, a senior economics major,
suggested that the general concept of
the American corporation is both
"mysterious" and "terrifying," and
that as a result students are often
reluctant to approach businesses for
employment.
But Larson stressed that his group
seeks to attract businesses representing
a wide range of student interests. "Our
program is geared toward helping
students who are still unsure of what
they want to do," Larson said.

Over the past two quarters Larson
and his staff of seven students have
worked through the Placement Center,
using its mailing list and other sources
to actively solicit the interest of
private corporations in their program.
"I'm very optimistic this year,"
Larson said, "for two reasons. First,
the national economic situation is
much better than it was a few years
ago. Second, we have been earnestly
and actively soliciting job offers,
rather than waiting for them to come
to us. I expect our work to pay off."
Larson said that any estimate of the
number of jobs which will be made
available "would be just a ball-park
guess," but he expected good results
from industries concerned with
management training programs. As
examples of these, he cited General
Motors, U.S. Steel, and many oil
companies, banking firms, and airlines.
In addition, he expressed the hope
that job offers would open up 'n
corporations outside of private
industry, such as those dealing with
public affairs.
SIB operates from an office on the

second floor of the old Firehouse,

to students at no charge.
