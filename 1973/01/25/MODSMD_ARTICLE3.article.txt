# Waldie Seeks Campaign Support
## 
### JIM FRIEND 
U.S. Rep. Jerome Waldie
(D-Antioch), the only announced
candidate for the 1974 California
gubernatorial race, came to campus
yesterday to enlist support for his
campaign.
The four-term congressman spoke
to an environmental planning class at
10 a.m. before appearing at an open
meeting in Tresidder Union at 11 a.m.
"I don't want to become a
professional congressman," Waldie
told about 25 students at the
Tresidder meeting. "There are too
many men who have been there too
long. If I stay in Congress much longer
it wouldn't be good for the people I
represent."

And, he admitted, "I'm tired of
Congress."
Waldie is considered a longshot in
what is expected to be a crowded field
in the Democratic primary. Other
potential candidates frequently
mentioned include San Francisco
Mayor Joseph Alioto, Assembly
Speaker Bob Moretti (D-Van Nuys),
State Sen. George Moscone (D-San
Francisco), and Secretary of State
Edmund G. Brown Jr.
"I've written a scenario about the
election, and as you can imagine, I'm
the one taking all of the bows at the
end of the last act," said the former
assemblyman. He predicted that
Brown and Moscone would decide
against making the gubernatorial race,
and that the campaign would narrow
down to Alioto, Moretti and himself.
Waldie, an opponent of the
congressional seniority system, cited
Rep. John McMillan (D-South
Carolina), as "a perfect example of a
poor chairman" of a Congressional
committee.
"He had the racial attitudes of a
South Carolina constituency, and was
chairman of the D.C. Committee, a
predominantly black constituency."
Speaking to about 50 engineering
students in the environmental planning
course, Waldie said that "those whose
interests are at stake are able to
prevent the passage of legislation."
Environmental legislation, he said,

"could have passed with comfortable
majorities on the floor, but it just
couldn't get out of committee."
However, in the absence of
Congressional action, he pointed to
the "encouraging" fact that
Californians used the ballot initiative
process to obtain environmental laws.
Prop. 20, the coastline protection
initiative, was "a good example of how
effective the initiative can be. The
people showed an amazing ability to
cut through the flack" of the
campaign. Waldie stated.

against making the gubernatorial race,
and that the campaign would narrow
down to Alioto, Moretti and himself.
Waldie, an opponent of the
congressional seniority system, cited
Rep. John McMillan (D-South
Carolina), as "a perfect example of a
poor chairman" of a Congressional
committee.
"He had the racial attitudes of a
South Carolina constituency, and was
chairman of the D.C. Committee, a
predominantly black constituency."
Speaking to about 50 engineering
students in the environmental planning
course, Waldie said that "those whose
interests are at stake are able to
prevent the passage of legislation."
Environmental legislation, he said,

"could have passed with comfortable
majorities on the floor, but it just
couldn't get out of committee."
However, in the absence of
Congressional action, he pointed to
the "encouraging" fact that
Californians used the ballot initiative
process to obtain environmental laws.
Prop. 20, the coastline protection
initiative, was "a good example of how
effective the initiative can be. The
people showed an amazing ability to
cut through the flack" of the
campaign. Waldie stated.

U.S. Rep. Jerome Waldie
(D-Antioch), the only announced
candidate for the 1974 California
gubernatorial race, came to campus
yesterday to enlist support for his
campaign.
The four-term congressman spoke
to an environmental planning class at
10 a.m. before appearing at an open
meeting in Tresidder Union at 11 a.m.
"I don't want to become a
professional congressman," Waldie
told about 25 students at the
Tresidder meeting. "There are too
many men who have been there too
long. If I stay in Congress much longer
it wouldn't be good for the people I
represent."

And, he admitted, "I'm tired of
Congress."
Waldie is considered a longshot in
what is expected to be a crowded field
in the Democratic primary. Other
potential candidates frequently
mentioned include San Francisco
Mayor Joseph Alioto, Assembly
Speaker Bob Moretti (D-Van Nuys),
State Sen. George Moscone (D-San
Francisco), and Secretary of State
Edmund G. Brown Jr.
"I've written a scenario about the
election, and as you can imagine, I'm
the one taking all of the bows at the
end of the last act," said the former
assemblyman. He predicted that
Brown and Moscone would decide
against making the gubernatorial race,
and that the campaign would narrow
down to Alioto, Moretti and himself.
Waldie, an opponent of the
congressional seniority system, cited
Rep. John McMillan (D-South
Carolina), as "a perfect example of a
