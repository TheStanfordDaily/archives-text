# Manzanita Park Fire Demolishes Trailer
## 
### 
One Manzanita Park trailer was
completely gutted and another
partially destroyed by fire last night.
There were no injuries.
According to reports from the
scene, Janell D. Edman and Julie
Fagan, both sophomores, were heating
wax on the stove of Manzanita 13W
when the blaze broke out.
The blaze apparently jumped an
eight-foot walkway and ignited trailer
13X. One bedroom in the second
trailer was extensively damaged.
According to a neighbor, Stuart
Bursten, the two women were heating
about 10 pounds of wax when the fire
erupted. "I was asleep; they wanted
me to help them with the fire
extinguisher. I opened their fire
extinguisher and put the fire out. The
trailer was filled with smoke except
for about three feet by the ceiling."
The three then left the trailer for
about 10 minutes to allow the smoke
out. However, when they returned, the
blaze had erupted again almost
completely engulfed the kitchen.
Fire officials said one of the three
dialed "0" and asked for the fire
department, and was connected with
the Palo Alto Fire Department. Palo
Alto then contacted Stanford, and the
four Stanford units rolled at about
8:40 p.m.
Firemen said the blaze was under
control within five minutes.
No estimate of the damage was
immediately available, but Fire Chief
Frank Jurian said that the trailer itself
was valued at about $12,000.
Manzanita residents identified the
other two residents of 13W as Lee
Crooks and Carol Frey, both

sophomores. Neither were in the
trailer at the time of the fire.
The residents of 13X were
identified as Steven Hauger, Robert
Aster, Nelson Noguchi, and Rod
Sherwood. It was not known if any of
them were in the trailer at the time.
