# Kissinger Details Terms Of Vietnam Cease-Fire

From the Associated Press
Details of the Vietnam peace
agreement were made public
yesterday, revealing an accord that left
its chief authors cautiously optimistic
but postponing resolution of several
important issues.
Presidential adviser Henry Kissinger
said the long-awaited settlement could
bring "a peace that heals," first to
Vietnam and then to all of Indochina.
Le Due Tho, North Vietnam's chief
negotiator, said in Paris that it
represented "a great victory for the
Vietnamese people."
Kissinger, in a 90-minute news
conference yesterday morning at the
White House, elaborated on the terms
of the complex accord, the text of
which had been released earlier
yesterday.
He said the first American POWs
will be released from North Vietnam
within 15 days from Saturday, when
the four-party agreement will be
signed in Paris.
No firm date was disclosed but
Pentagon sources said they were
hopeful the initial release would come
within 24 hours, possibly Sunday.
The American POWs will be picked
up in Hanoi by American personnel in
American planes. The entire
contingent of 587 U.S. captives — 473
in North Vietnam, 108 in the South
and 6 in Laos — will be released in
groups at about two-week intervals for
two months.

From Hanoi, the first stop outside
Indochina for the American prisoners
will be Clark Field in the Philippines.
There, they will receive medical
examinations and intelligence
debriefings to gather information on
men still missing and on their
experiences in captivity.
Long Flight
Once cleared by the doctors for the
long flight across the Pacific, they will
be flown to Travis Air Force Base,
Calif., and transferred to one of 31
military hospitals across the country
closest to their homes. It is at these
hospitals that they will be reunited
with their families.
On Saturday in Paris, North
Vietnam is to give U.S. officials a list
of Americans held captive.
"Whether this agreement brings a
lasting peace or not," Kissinger said,
"depends not only upon its provisions
but also on the spirit in which it is
implemented."
12-Page Agreement
According to the full 12-page
agreement and the four accompanying
explanatory and technical documents,
the settlement will be signed by
foreign ministers of the United States,
North Vietnam, South Vietnam, and
the Viet Cong, in Paris on Saturday.
The cease-fire initially will be
limited to Vietnam, because of the
complexities in the other two
Indochina nations, Kissinger said.
But he added that "It is our firm
expectation that within a short period
of time there will be a formal
cease-fire in Laos."
As to Cambodia, the presidential
adviser said "it is our expectation that
a de facto cease-fire will come into
being over a period of time relevant to
the execution of this agreement."
Kissinger told a national broadcast
and television audience yesterday
morning that "no one side got all it
wanted," but he claimed the United
States obtained most of its essential
demands, particularly concerning the
right of political self-determination for
the South.
No Problems Left
Tho said there are "no remaining
problems to be settled." Both he and
Kissinger denied that there are any
secret understandings or protocols.
But the phrasing of some of the 23
articles of the agreement is
exceedingly vague.
For example, it states that
"immediately after the cease-fire," the
Thieu government and the Viet Cong
"will achieve national reconciliation
and concord" and "end hatred and
enmity."
The reunification of Vietnam, the
withdrawal of North Vietnamese
troops from the South, and the
elections to be held in the South are
left to future negotiation.
The accord "respects the unity of
Vietnam," calling the military
demarcation line along the 17 th
parallel "only provisional."
Kissinger was asked yesterday what
was accomplished in the agreement
that couldn't have been obtained four
years ago and he took the opportunity
to outline the U.S. gains.
For the entire period since the first
negotiating session in Paris four years
ago, Kissinger said, any chance for a
settlement "foundered on the
insistence of the North Vietnamese
that a political victory be handed to
them" by demanding acceptance of a

coalition government as a precondition
to negotiation on other issues.
"It was not until last Oct. 8 that
the North Vietnamese ever agreed to
separate" the political and military
issues, he said, and from then on the
negotiations moved relatively fast.
What this led to, Kissinger stated, is
a guarantee that no coalition
government will be imposed on the
South, that the South Vietnamese will
determine their own political future.
