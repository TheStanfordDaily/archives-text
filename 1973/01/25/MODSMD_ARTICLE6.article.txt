# Stanford Reaction To Peace
## 
### MARCIA FRIEDMAN 
Reactions of the Stanford
community to President Nixon's
formal announcement of the Vietnam
peace agreement and Dr. Henry
Kissinger's later disclosure of details
ranged from sighs of relief to general
bewilderment to outright disgust, but
with peace at hand Tuesday evening,
no victory celebrations were in sight.
A quiet and often weary acceptance
seemed to be the order of the evening.
Robert McAfee Brown, Stanford
professor of religion and a national
leader in Clergy and Laity Concerned
About Vietnam said in a statement
issued yesterday: "My response is a
combination of hope and fear — hope
that it will take effect, fear that once
again we may have been misled. But I
shall hope that this time the fear is
misplaced."
Brown called for the rebuilding of
"the nation we have so tragically
destroyed," the release of the 200,000
South Vietnamese political prisoners,
amnesty for American men who
refused to fight, restoration of the
"right to dissent" in America,
regaining the balance of powers from
its executive inclination, and public
acknowledgement of "our guilt for
failing to speak out sooner," once the
cease-fire begins.
Confident
Law professor Jack Friedenthal,
who publicly endorsed Nixon in an ad
placed in the New York Times before
the November elections, was "happy"
that an agreement had been reached
and confident that both sides would
live up to it.
"I think there was an honesty in its
creation," he said, "and that it is
legitimate to believe that the USSR
and the Republic of China in effect are
supporting it and will bring pressures
to bear to bring it to a lasting peace."
Rep. Paul N. "Pete" McCloskey
(R-Portola Valley), a leading
Republican Vietnam war critic, said
yesterday that the agreement lifted a
"tremendous weight" from Congress'
shoulders, but said that peace would
not last and guerilla activity would
continue under Thieu's South Vietnam
regime.
War Commission
He plans to introduce two
resolutions in Congress to (1) prevent
the "resumption of American activity
in or over Indochina without prior
consent of Congress," and (2) create a
commission to examine the war to
define rules for any such future action.
Greg Larsen, a December graduate
of Stanford, was watching the NBA
All-star game when Nixon came on
with the announcement.
"It didn't make any impression
then," he said, "and later on, when I
thought about it, I didn't feel any
cause for elation. How can I celebrate
a peace with honor when all I can
remember is the thousands of people
whose lives have been ruined.
"Nixon tried to turn this into a
moral victory for the U. 5.," Larsen
continued, "and I don't think we
should be proud of ourselves or our
country."
'Relieved'
Tom Ehrlichmann, a freshman who
campaigned for Nixon, said: "Of
course I am relieved as is everyone
else, but I can see that it is not a firm
peace — it has to be worked towards.
"There are still questions in my
mind as to why they did some of the
things they did," he continued, "but
on the whole I hold a lot of respect for
Nixon for pulling this thing out."
Kevin O'Grady, a leading campus
organizer for the McGovern campaign,
did not see the agreement as an end of
the conflict, but merely as a change in
its conduct. Ray White, a leader of the
Nixon campus campaign, did not see
the agreement as an end to Indochina's
problems and expressed concern for
the fate of the prisoners of the South
Vietnamese.

mind as to why they did some of the
things they did," he continued, "but
on the whole I hold a lot of respect for
Nixon for pulling this thing out."
Kevin O'Grady, a leading campus
organizer for the McGovern campaign,
did not see the agreement as an end of
the conflict, but merely as a change in
its conduct. Ray White, a leader of the
Nixon campus campaign, did not see
the agreement as an end to Indochina's
problems and expressed concern for
the fate of the prisoners of the South
Vietnamese.
Reactions of the Stanford
community to President Nixon's
formal announcement of the Vietnam
peace agreement and Dr. Henry
Kissinger's later disclosure of details
ranged from sighs of relief to general
bewilderment to outright disgust, but
with peace at hand Tuesday evening,
no victory celebrations were in sight.
A quiet and often weary acceptance
seemed to be the order of the evening.
Robert McAfee Brown, Stanford
professor of religion and a national
leader in Clergy and Laity Concerned
About Vietnam said in a statement
issued yesterday: "My response is a
combination of hope and fear — hope
that it will take effect, fear that once
again we may have been misled. But I
shall hope that this time the fear is
misplaced."
Brown called for the rebuilding of
"the nation we have so tragically
destroyed," the release of the 200,000
South Vietnamese political prisoners,
amnesty for American men who
refused to fight, restoration of the
"right to dissent" in America,
regaining the balance of powers from
its executive inclination, and public
acknowledgement of "our guilt for
failing to speak out sooner," once the
cease-fire begins.
Confident
Law professor Jack Friedenthal,
who publicly endorsed Nixon in an ad
placed in the New York Times before
the November elections, was "happy"
that an agreement had been reached
and confident that both sides would
live up to it.
"I think there was an honesty in its
creation," he said, "and that it is
legitimate to believe that the USSR
and the Republic of China in effect are
supporting it and will bring pressures
to bear to bring it to a lasting peace."
Rep. Paul N. "Pete" McCloskey
(R-Portola Valley), a leading
Republican Vietnam war critic, said
yesterday that the agreement lifted a
"tremendous weight" from Congress'
shoulders, but said that peace would
not last and guerilla activity would
continue under Thieu's South Vietnam
regime.
War Commission
He plans to introduce two
resolutions in Congress to (1) prevent
the "resumption of American activity
in or over Indochina without prior
consent of Congress," and (2) create a
commission to examine the war to
define rules for any such future action.
Greg Larsen, a December graduate
of Stanford, was watching the NBA
All-star game when Nixon came on
with the announcement.
"It didn't make any impression
then," he said, "and later on, when I
thought about it, I didn't feel any
cause for elation. How can I celebrate
a peace with honor when all I can
remember is the thousands of people
whose lives have been ruined.
"Nixon tried to turn this into a
moral victory for the U. 5.," Larsen
continued, "and I don't think we
should be proud of ourselves or our
country."
'Relieved'
Tom Ehrlichmann, a freshman who
campaigned for Nixon, said: "Of
course I am relieved as is everyone
else, but I can see that it is not a firm
peace — it has to be worked towards.
"There are still questions in my
mind as to why they did some of the
things they did," he continued, "but
on the whole I hold a lot of respect for
Nixon for pulling this thing out."
