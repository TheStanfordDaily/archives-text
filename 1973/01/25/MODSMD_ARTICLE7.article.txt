## Fragile Peace 
### 
The cease-fire in Vietnam is expected to end more than a
decade of painful American military intervention in that
country. It should lead to the return of over 600 American
prisoners of war and a cessation of military activities in
Vietnam. These facts make us thankful for the agreement.
There are still, however, many problems to be worked out,
and many of the underlying reasons for the war are still not
resolved. North Vietnamese troops remain in the South, the
ultimate control of South Vietnam remains in doubt, and
the continuation of President Thieu's government depends
directly on military and economic aid from this country. In
the long run the agreement specifies the reunification of
Vietnam, and we doubt that the communists in North or
South Vietnam will accept anything less than complete
control. In this context, the cease-fire represents an
important event in the war, but almost certainly not its end.
America's military strategy has changed enormously
during the course of the war. From the self-assured policy of
intervention throughout the world which led to Vietnam, we
have embaiked on a cautious course of negotiation and big
power rapprochement. This more realistic foreign policy is
probably one of the few positive results of the war.
For those who have been at Stanford at any time during
the past decade, the war-and for students, the draft-cannot
have failed to have profoundly affected their view of the
world and themselves in it. The division of this country was
perhaps most intensely felt at institutions like Stanford
which tried to objectively view the world and make sense
out of it.
The war forced many of us to take seriously criticisms of
this country which struck to the very core of what it
represents. At Stanford it led to the abolition of ROTC, the
resignation of President Kenneth Pitzer, and the destruction
of considerable University property some of which had only
remote, if any, connection to the war.
The war led to confrontations with police, riots, trashing,
cancellation of classes, and tremendous efforts through
peaceful channels all with the objective of ending the war. It
led to many acts of civil disobedience and arrests. Hopefully,
some or all of these actions contributed at least in a small
way to the eventual ceasefire.
More importantly, however, these actions demonstrated
to many of us how remote our own perceptions were from
those of our government, and how powerless we were in
affecting public policy. The apparent ineffectiveness of the
anti-war activities led to a state of chronic frustration.
Meanwhile, the continuation of the war led to a pervasive
lack of respect for authority.
While we hope that the Vietnam acords signal the end of
America's involvement in that country, we fear that they
will lead to continued civil war and possibly renewed
involvement by United States armed forces. The basic
demand of all those who have opposed American Vietnam
policy, that this country stop supporting the South
Vietnamese government, has not yet taken place.

affecting public policy. The apparent ineffectiveness of the
anti-war activities led to a state of chronic frustration.
Meanwhile, the continuation of the war led to a pervasive
lack of respect for authority.
While we hope that the Vietnam acords signal the end of
America's involvement in that country, we fear that they
will lead to continued civil war and possibly renewed
involvement by United States armed forces. The basic
demand of all those who have opposed American Vietnam
policy, that this country stop supporting the South
Vietnamese government, has not yet taken place.
The cease-fire in Vietnam is expected to end more than a
decade of painful American military intervention in that
country. It should lead to the return of over 600 American
prisoners of war and a cessation of military activities in
Vietnam. These facts make us thankful for the agreement.
There are still, however, many problems to be worked out,
and many of the underlying reasons for the war are still not
resolved. North Vietnamese troops remain in the South, the
ultimate control of South Vietnam remains in doubt, and
the continuation of President Thieu's government depends
directly on military and economic aid from this country. In
the long run the agreement specifies the reunification of
Vietnam, and we doubt that the communists in North or
South Vietnam will accept anything less than complete
control. In this context, the cease-fire represents an
important event in the war, but almost certainly not its end.
America's military strategy has changed enormously
during the course of the war. From the self-assured policy of
intervention throughout the world which led to Vietnam, we
have embaiked on a cautious course of negotiation and big
power rapprochement. This more realistic foreign policy is
probably one of the few positive results of the war.
For those who have been at Stanford at any time during
the past decade, the war-and for students, the draft-cannot
have failed to have profoundly affected their view of the
world and themselves in it. The division of this country was
perhaps most intensely felt at institutions like Stanford
which tried to objectively view the world and make sense
out of it.
The war forced many of us to take seriously criticisms of
this country which struck to the very core of what it
represents. At Stanford it led to the abolition of ROTC, the
resignation of President Kenneth Pitzer, and the destruction
of considerable University property some of which had only
remote, if any, connection to the war.
The war led to confrontations with police, riots, trashing,
cancellation of classes, and tremendous efforts through
peaceful channels all with the objective of ending the war. It
led to many acts of civil disobedience and arrests. Hopefully,
some or all of these actions contributed at least in a small
way to the eventual ceasefire.
More importantly, however, these actions demonstrated
to many of us how remote our own perceptions were from
those of our government, and how powerless we were in
affecting public policy. The apparent ineffectiveness of the
anti-war activities led to a state of chronic frustration.
