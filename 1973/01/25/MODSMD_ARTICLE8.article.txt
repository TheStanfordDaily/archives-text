The eulogies for Lyndon
Baines Johnson, the thirty-sixth
President of the United States, are
being given. Special notice should
be taken of the nearly unanimous
endorsement by LBJ's eulogists of
his domestic program. Sen.
Edward Kennedy and the New
York Times' editorial both spoke
highly of LBJ's Great Society.
People on university campuses
generally were, during his
Presidency, dissatisfied with
President Johnson's foreign
policy. Certainly Johnson's
overseas policy was one of
aggression and should be
condemned. But I believe that
close examination shows that his
domestic policies were also
unsatisfactory.

In Stephen E. Ambrose's
historical treatment of American
involvement in the Cold War, Rise
to Globalism, he notes that "in
Vietnam, as elsewhere, Johnson
continued |John F. ] Kennedy's
policies."
Empire Or Nation?
This means that when Johnson
faced the question of whether
America was to be an empire or a
nation, "Johnson chose
empire .... Johnson's
foreign-policy advisers, almost to
a man Kennedy appointees,
concurred." This was the basis of
Johnson's foreign policy from
Vietnam to the Dominican
Republic.
Amidst the somewhat
confusing rhetoric of epitaphs and
tributes to greatness, it is still
possible to present a true picture
of Johnson's domestic policy.
Here as in foreign affairs,
Johnson took the same general
stand that Kennedy had. G.
William Domhoff in Fat Cats and
Democrats is realistic and notes
that Johnson even more than
Kennedy gave the group within
th»» power elite that Domhoff calls
the "CFR-CED clique" what they
wanted. (CFR stands for Council
of Foreign Relations; CED stands
for Committee for Economic
Development.)
Policy Makers
Domhoff describes the CED as
consisting of more than 200
influential business leaders and (in

recent times) a few university
presidents. He discusses in the
several books he has written on
power in America how the CED
and its satellites, the Brookings
Institute, the National Bureau for
Economic Research, the American
Assembly, and the National
Planning Association, make policy
on domestic issues in America. It
was on these policy
recommendations that Johnson
acted.
Ferdinand Lundberg in The
Rich and the Super-Rich had a
very prosaic but believable
explanation for this big business
affinity for the policies LBJ
promoted, at the same time that
many businessmen feared
Goldwater's laissez-faire

proposals. The corporate leaders
were an "integral part" of the
Great Society because there was
"obviously a great deal of lucre to
be made filling profitable
government contracts for cement,
steel, aluminum, copper,
textbooks, rockets, space
machines, tanks, recoilless rifles,
schools, hospitals, sanitoria and
bird baths."
Thus, material interest may
plausibly have influenced some
key business leaders in supporting
Johnson. In Murray N. Rothbard's
critique of the Johnson
administration (printed in The
Great Society Reader), he
identifies concern for their web of
special privileges as the decisive
reason for these businessmen's
alliance with the government.
Corporate State
Rothbard maintains that
Johnson's Great Society retained
the essence of FDR's National
Recovery Administration of the
1930s (an institution inspired by
the example of Mussolini's Italy).
"The usual tripartite
rapprochement of big business,
big unions, and big government
symbolizes the organization of
society by blocs, syndics, and
corporations, regulated and
privileged by the federal, state,
and local governments. What this
all amounts to in essence is the
'corporate state.' "
Having described the
socio-economic basis of the Great

Society, Rothbard goes on to
adversely criticize LBJ in an area
where LBJ's public relations and
propaganda staff have created a
false aura that persists to this day:
"The cruelest myth fostered by
the liberals is that the Great
Society functions as a great boon
and benefit to the poor; in reality,
when we cut through the frothy
appearances to the cold reality
underneath, the poor are the
major victims of the welfare state.
Poor Drafted
'The poor are the ones to be
conscripted to fight and die at
literally slave wages in the Great
Society's imperial wars. The poor
are the ones to lose their homes to
the bulldozer of urban renewal,
that bulldozer that operates for
the benefit of real estate and
construction interests to pulverize
available low-cost housing. . . .
"The poor (e.g., Negroes in the
South) are the ones disemployed
by rising minimum wage floors,
put in for the benefit of
employers and unions in
higher-wage areas (e.g., the North)
to prevent industry from moving
to the low-wage areas.
'The poor are cruelly
victimized by an income tax that
left and right alike misconstrue as
an egalitarian program to soak the
rich; actually, various tricks and
exemptions insure that it is the
poor and middle class who are hit
the hardest.
Perpetual Inflation
'The poor are victimized too
by a welfare state of which the
cardinal macro-economic tenet is
perpetual if controlled inflation."
In summing up the situation
during the Johnson
administration, we are better off
ignoring all the bombast then and
since about how LBJ helped the
poor. The old jokes from the War
on Poverty days about there being
"money in poverty" for those
who knew how to get it were
funny and true at the same time.
In Lyndon Johnson's day as in
Richard Nixon's, there are many
who seek to make a living by
using protection, privileges, or
subsidies gotten through
connections with the government.
The institutionalization of more
such practices was certainly a
defining characteristic of LBJ's
domestic policy. But this is
something to be condemned, not
lauded.

presidents. He discusses in the
several books he has written on
power in America how the CED
and its satellites, the Brookings
Institute, the National Bureau for
Economic Research, the American
Assembly, and the National
Planning Association, make policy
on domestic issues in America. It
was on these policy
recommendations that Johnson
acted.
Ferdinand Lundberg in The
Rich and the Super-Rich had a
very prosaic but believable
explanation for this big business
affinity for the policies LBJ
promoted, at the same time that
many businessmen feared
Goldwater's laissez-faire

proposals. The corporate leaders
were an "integral part" of the
Great Society because there was
"obviously a great deal of lucre to
be made filling profitable
government contracts for cement,
steel, aluminum, copper,
textbooks, rockets, space
machines, tanks, recoilless rifles,
schools, hospitals, sanitoria and
bird baths."
Thus, material interest may
plausibly have influenced some
key business leaders in supporting
Johnson. In Murray N. Rothbard's
critique of the Johnson
administration (printed in The
Great Society Reader), he
identifies concern for their web of
special privileges as the decisive
reason for these businessmen's
alliance with the government.
Corporate State
Rothbard maintains that
Johnson's Great Society retained
the essence of FDR's National
Recovery Administration of the
1930s (an institution inspired by
the example of Mussolini's Italy).
"The usual tripartite
rapprochement of big business,
big unions, and big government
symbolizes the organization of
society by blocs, syndics, and
corporations, regulated and
privileged by the federal, state,
and local governments. What this
all amounts to in essence is the
'corporate state.' "
Having described the
socio-economic basis of the Great

Society, Rothbard goes on to
adversely criticize LBJ in an area
where LBJ's public relations and
propaganda staff have created a
false aura that persists to this day:
"The cruelest myth fostered by
the liberals is that the Great
Society functions as a great boon
and benefit to the poor; in reality,
when we cut through the frothy
appearances to the cold reality
underneath, the poor are the
major victims of the welfare state.
Poor Drafted
'The poor are the ones to be
conscripted to fight and die at
literally slave wages in the Great
Society's imperial wars. The poor
are the ones to lose their homes to
the bulldozer of urban renewal,
that bulldozer that operates for
the benefit of real estate and
construction interests to pulverize
available low-cost housing. . . .
"The poor (e.g., Negroes in the
South) are the ones disemployed
by rising minimum wage floors,
put in for the benefit of
employers and unions in
higher-wage areas (e.g., the North)
to prevent industry from moving
to the low-wage areas.
'The poor are cruelly
victimized by an income tax that
left and right alike misconstrue as
an egalitarian program to soak the
rich; actually, various tricks and
exemptions insure that it is the
poor and middle class who are hit
the hardest.
Perpetual Inflation
'The poor are victimized too
by a welfare state of which the
cardinal macro-economic tenet is
perpetual if controlled inflation."
In summing up the situation
during the Johnson
administration, we are better off
ignoring all the bombast then and
since about how LBJ helped the
poor. The old jokes from the War
on Poverty days about there being
"money in poverty" for those
who knew how to get it were
funny and true at the same time.
In Lyndon Johnson's day as in
Richard Nixon's, there are many
who seek to make a living by
using protection, privileges, or
subsidies gotten through
connections with the government.
The institutionalization of more
such practices was certainly a
defining characteristic of LBJ's
domestic policy. But this is
something to be condemned, not
lauded.

The eulogies for Lyndon
Baines Johnson, the thirty-sixth
President of the United States, are
being given. Special notice should
be taken of the nearly unanimous
endorsement by LBJ's eulogists of
his domestic program. Sen.
Edward Kennedy and the New
York Times' editorial both spoke
highly of LBJ's Great Society.
People on university campuses
generally were, during his
Presidency, dissatisfied with
President Johnson's foreign
policy. Certainly Johnson's
overseas policy was one of
aggression and should be
condemned. But I believe that
close examination shows that his
domestic policies were also
unsatisfactory.

In Stephen E. Ambrose's
historical treatment of American
involvement in the Cold War, Rise
to Globalism, he notes that "in
Vietnam, as elsewhere, Johnson
continued |John F. ] Kennedy's
policies."
Empire Or Nation?
This means that when Johnson
faced the question of whether
America was to be an empire or a
nation, "Johnson chose
empire .... Johnson's
foreign-policy advisers, almost to
a man Kennedy appointees,
concurred." This was the basis of
Johnson's foreign policy from
Vietnam to the Dominican
Republic.
Amidst the somewhat
confusing rhetoric of epitaphs and
tributes to greatness, it is still
possible to present a true picture
of Johnson's domestic policy.
Here as in foreign affairs,
Johnson took the same general
stand that Kennedy had. G.
William Domhoff in Fat Cats and
Democrats is realistic and notes
that Johnson even more than
Kennedy gave the group within
th»» power elite that Domhoff calls
the "CFR-CED clique" what they
wanted. (CFR stands for Council
of Foreign Relations; CED stands
for Committee for Economic
Development.)
Policy Makers
Domhoff describes the CED as
consisting of more than 200
influential business leaders and (in

recent times) a few university
presidents. He discusses in the

The eulogies for Lyndon
Baines Johnson, the thirty-sixth
President of the United States, are
being given. Special notice should
be taken of the nearly unanimous
endorsement by LBJ's eulogists of
his domestic program. Sen.
Edward Kennedy and the New
York Times' editorial both spoke
highly of LBJ's Great Society.
People on university campuses
generally were, during his
Presidency, dissatisfied with
President Johnson's foreign
policy. Certainly Johnson's
overseas policy was one of
aggression and should be
condemned. But I believe that
close examination shows that his
domestic policies were also
unsatisfactory.

In Stephen E. Ambrose's
historical treatment of American
involvement in the Cold War, Rise
to Globalism, he notes that "in
Vietnam, as elsewhere, Johnson
continued |John F. ] Kennedy's
policies."
Empire Or Nation?
This means that when Johnson
faced the question of whether
America was to be an empire or a
nation, "Johnson chose
empire .... Johnson's
foreign-policy advisers, almost to
a man Kennedy appointees,
concurred." This was the basis of
Johnson's foreign policy from
Vietnam to the Dominican
Republic.
Amidst the somewhat
confusing rhetoric of epitaphs and
tributes to greatness, it is still
possible to present a true picture
of Johnson's domestic policy.
Here as in foreign affairs,
Johnson took the same general
stand that Kennedy had. G.
William Domhoff in Fat Cats and
Democrats is realistic and notes
that Johnson even more than
Kennedy gave the group within
th»» power elite that Domhoff calls
the "CFR-CED clique" what they
wanted. (CFR stands for Council
of Foreign Relations; CED stands
for Committee for Economic
Development.)
Policy Makers
Domhoff describes the CED as
consisting of more than 200
influential business leaders and (in

recent times) a few university
presidents. He discusses in the
several books he has written on
power in America how the CED
and its satellites, the Brookings
Institute, the National Bureau for
Economic Research, the American
Assembly, and the National
Planning Association, make policy
on domestic issues in America. It
was on these policy
recommendations that Johnson
acted.
Ferdinand Lundberg in The
Rich and the Super-Rich had a
very prosaic but believable
explanation for this big business
affinity for the policies LBJ
promoted, at the same time that
many businessmen feared
Goldwater's laissez-faire

proposals. The corporate leaders
were an "integral part" of the
Great Society because there was
"obviously a great deal of lucre to
be made filling profitable
government contracts for cement,
steel, aluminum, copper,
textbooks, rockets, space
machines, tanks, recoilless rifles,
schools, hospitals, sanitoria and
bird baths."
Thus, material interest may
plausibly have influenced some
key business leaders in supporting
Johnson. In Murray N. Rothbard's
critique of the Johnson
administration (printed in The
Great Society Reader), he
identifies concern for their web of
special privileges as the decisive
reason for these businessmen's
alliance with the government.
Corporate State
Rothbard maintains that
Johnson's Great Society retained
the essence of FDR's National
Recovery Administration of the
1930s (an institution inspired by
the example of Mussolini's Italy).
"The usual tripartite
rapprochement of big business,
big unions, and big government
symbolizes the organization of
society by blocs, syndics, and
corporations, regulated and
privileged by the federal, state,
and local governments. What this
all amounts to in essence is the
'corporate state.' "
Having described the
socio-economic basis of the Great

Society, Rothbard goes on to
adversely criticize LBJ in an area
where LBJ's public relations and
propaganda staff have created a
false aura that persists to this day:
"The cruelest myth fostered by
the liberals is that the Great
Society functions as a great boon
