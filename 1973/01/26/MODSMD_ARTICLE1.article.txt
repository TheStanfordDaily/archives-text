# Trailers Meet All Fire Standards
## 
### MARCIA FRIEDMAN 
The charred skeleton of trailer 13W
and the partial destruction of its
neighbor 13X in Wednesday night's
Manzanita Park fire have raised many
questions about the safety of the
trailers.
Built to house four students, each
trailer has inside walls made of thin
plywood, outside aluminum siding,
contains all-wooden furniture and has
a forced air gas heating system. There
are two exits at the living
room-kitchen end of the trailer, but
there are none in the bedroom section.
Manzanita Park must live up to fire
code standards for trailer parks and
according to Fire Marshall Pat Cady:
"The trailers are up to code as far

as construction of mobile homes go.
We go by national and county fire
codes and they live up to both."
Fire-proofing is required by the fire
code for curtains and common areas,
such as lounges. Alan Cummings,
Manager of Residences and
Fraternities, said that this is applied
equally to all university residences,
including the trailers.
Trailers Safe
"Although the trailers do not have
the same quality construction as
Wilbur or Roble, they shouldn't be
considered inferior or unsafe,"
Cummings said. "The carpet, fabrics,
and furniture, in terms of
combustibility, are no different from
the rest of the resident system.

"My own feeling, as an individual,
is that there is nothing to prompt me
to think that special measures need to
be taken because these are trailers
instead of apartments," Cummings
continued. "No fire retardant would
have reduced or minimized the effect
of that fire."
The fire, which was caused by ten
pounds of melting wax in 13W's oven,
was first extinguished by trailer
occupants. Leaving the doors and
windows to the trailer open to let the
smoke out, however, let in the
necessary oxygen to rekindle the
flames which quickly gutted the
trailer.
"Last night's rapid spread can't be
attributed to the construction of the
trailer," Karen Murray, Director of
Manzanita Park, said.
Human Error
"The thing definitely started by
wax in the oven, a human error, not a
structural one, and then was fed by
leaving the trailer open," she added.
"It would have been a major fire
anywhere."
Murray said that the trailers are a
very easy place for a major fire to
spread, both within the trailer and to
adjacent ones. The Wednesday night
fire demonstrated that, she felt.
Although the distance between
trailers meets code standards, Fire
Chief Frank .Jurian expressed concern:
"We would prefer to have them
further apart. Just think what would
happen if the humidity was way down
and we had some winds."
Jurian also commented on the lack
of exits in the sleeping areas: "We're
contemplating studying the possibility
of trap doors which could be used as
emergency exits."
Alarm Boxes
He suggested that these doors might
take the form of kick-out panels in the
bedrooms. The installation of more
alarm boxes in the park is also being
explored, as there is only one in the
park, adjacent to the Manzanita Park
office.
Fire marshals inspect the dorms and

their fire equipment for code
violations at the close of the regular
school year, but do not enter private
rooms unless the occupants request
them.
Jurian attributed most of the
individual room fires on campus over
the last five years'to candles, and said
that those hanging from the ceiling
were particular problems.
Cummings sees the most needed
fire safety improvements coming from
students.
"Most of our effort for
improvement will be directed to
orientation, to make people more
sensitive to the candle problem," he
said. "We have to improve the level of
awareness of fire safety and
procedure."
