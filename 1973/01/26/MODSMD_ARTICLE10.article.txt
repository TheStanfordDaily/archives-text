Peace. What a relief to have the prisoners
of war on their way home and the B-52s
grounded!
I write this from Washington on the day
following the President's announcement. All
day long senators and congressmen have been
grinning at each other, saying, "Thank God
it's over. Let's get down to work."
It is like having a great weight lifted from
our hearts and minds. At long last we can turn
to constructive solution of problems with a
free conscience that people are not being
killed and maimed while we deliberate.
For nearly eight and a half years, the
energies, resources and emotions of nearly all
of us have been diverted away from full, hard
attention to domestic problems. What a
pleasure it is going to be to work on problems
of health, energy, housing, water pollution
and tax reform!
Time Invested
As I look back over my own expenditure
of time during the past five years in Congress,
I suspect that well over half of that time has
been spent in seeking an end to the war. This
has been true of many of my colleagues in the
House and Senate, and certainly our efforts
have required a responding allocation of effort
on the part of those who have supported the
war.

It is thus with tremendous optimism that
the 93rd Congress finally gets down to
business. This is not to say that we have any
assurance or anticipation that the conflict will
not resume in Vietnam once American
prisoners of war are returned and American
troops withdrawn. Vietnam is still divided and
there is little cause to believe that the North
Vietnamese and the Viet Cong will abandon
the struggle in the countryside to achieve the
realization they have fought for since 1954.
President Thieu has instituted the same
measures of repression, censorship, torture
and abolishing of village elections which led to
the ultimate overthrow of Premier Diem ten
years ago.
Two Goals
There are two things I feel Congress should
do as we end our military participation in
Indochina:
First, I think we should adopt a simple law
prohibiting further American combat activity
on the Asian continent save with prior
approval of Congress. This is not to say that
circumstances might not arise where American
effort might be required; the purpose is to
reestablish our constitutional form of
government with a Congress which must
approve before a war is commenced.
The second action, before forgetting the

mistake of Vietnam, would be the creation of
a congressional Commission of Inquiry, made
up of both Members of Congress and
distinguished private lawyers, to examine our
conduct of the war in Vietnam and to
recommend legal principles of warfare to
govern us, and hopefully all nations, in the
future.
New Precedents Needed
The principles of Nuremberg established
certain precedents but are of confused
application with respect to carpet-bombing,
"search and destroy" missions, the use of
gunships and cluster bomb anti-personnel
devices against inhabited areas, relocation of
civilian populations and, in particular, the
denial of due process and torture under the
so-called Phoenix Program.
The purpose of a Commission of Inquiry
would not be to assess blame, but to define
legal principles for future guidance in
insurgency and counter-insurgency conflicts.
I am introducing resolutions to accomplish
both of these goals and would welcome any
comments and suggestions any constituent
would care to offer.
