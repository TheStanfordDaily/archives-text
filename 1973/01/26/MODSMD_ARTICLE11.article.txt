Debate 'Mismanaged'
Editor:
The Psychology
Department-sponsored debate on
the "Heritabiiity of 1.Q." Tuesday
night in Mem. Aud. was
participated in with dignity and
decorum—but only by Prof.
William Shockley.
The debate was structured so
that his opponents were given all
possible advantage; even so, they
felt obliged to make irrelevant
character references and take
clearly empirical statements
personally.
The debate was grossly
mismanaged, and the pointed way
in which Shockley was often
ignored by his fellow panelists is a
sad commentary about the
open-mindedness of our academic
community.
If a debate is this widely
publicized in the future, one can
only hope that an attempt will be
made to find responsible
spokesmen willing to interact in a
courteous, dignified atmosphere.

The Same Mistake
Editor:
I am disturbed over the
closed-mindedness and illogic
displayed by Ms. Gini Faller in her
article entitled "Shockley A
Threat To Us All" (Daily, Jan.
23). Ms. Faller bemoans the
dismissal of Bruce Franklin
(whose only "crime" consisted of
airing his views), then turns
around and urges the identical
action to be taken against
Shockley. Certainly the Franklin
decision was an irresponsible
mistake. So why make the same
mistake twice? Why perform the
Administration's task for them?
I wonder how Ms. Faller would
have reacted had the Daily refused
to print her article, judging it to
be "a threat to us." Probably the
same way I will react should her
proposal to dismiss Prof. Shockley
become a reality.
The opinions themselves
expressed by Shockley and his
opponents are irrelevant. I am
concerned with the frightening
fact that Ms. Faller's reverence for
"freedom of speech" seems to
crack under pressure. It would be
nice if she, as well as the many
other members of the "Stanford
community" who would prevent
an unpopular view from being
expressed, would wake up to the
responsibilities of a community
which labels itself "free" and
"academic."

The residents of Escondido
Village have paid $40,000 for the
renovation of the Escondido
Village Cottage, including a
meeting room equipped with a
kitchen and rest room.
However, Escondido Village
residents are not allowed to use
this room for any reason
whatsoever from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.,
Mondays through Fridays. The
reason given by Frank Gallagher is
that having meetings during the
day would be distracting to the
staff. However, by closing only
one door, this meeting room is
entirely set off from the rest of
the building, and has its own
outside entrance.
Further, the residents (and
even the Escondido Village
Council) were not consulted or
even informed of the policy. It
wasn't until a member of the
Escondido Village Executive
Board tried to reserve the room
that this policy became known.
I feel that this problem is
indicative of the attitude of the
Escondido Administration
towards the residents.

Women's Pamphlet
Editor:
There are a multitude of
women students who enter
Stanford every fall. They might be
interested in becoming involved
with women's issues in general or
in women's caucuses in their
individual departments, but they
don't know where to turn.
The CEEW (Committee on the
Education and Employment of
Women) has taken this need into
account and is planning to publish
a pamphlet dealing with women at
Stanford.
This pamphlet will include a
list and description of every
women's organization on campus,
helpful hints on how to get along
as a woman at this university and
finally, a description of what, in
our opinion, it means to be a
Stanford woman.
If you are active in such an
organization, we are requesting
that you write a short description
of its activities and purpose as
well as the way that new students
can become involved. This will, of
course, be beneficial to you in
recruiting new members.
Even if you are not a member
of any specific organization, your
contributions and suggestions will
be much appreciated.
The deadline will be Feb. 2.

'Support Your Local Eskimos'
Editor:
This is the time of year when
numerous U.S. gasoline companies
send out offers for credit cards to
a "select" group of
students—apparently nearly
everyone who was registered for
first quarter. I have received three
of these offers in two days.
I also received—from the
Mohawk Nation, and on
request—a printed message which
I think would be of interest to
you:
"The following gasoline
companies are suing to stop
Eskimos of Alaska's North Slope
from forming their own
municipality. The Eskimos wish
to form a local school district to
keep their kids from being
shipped out, and will use tax
moneys from the oil companies to
do this. Support your local
Eskimos, and do NOT support:
Mobil Oil
Amerada-Hess
Amoco
BP
Humble Oil of Calif.
Phillips Petroleum
Union Oil of Calif."
I urge you to draw your own
conclusions. And if you feel
strongly enough, you might even
use that postage-paid envelope in
your credit card offer to let the
companies know how you feel
about hard human lives as
opposed to easy credit.

the "Heritabiiity of 1.Q." Tuesday
night in Mem. Aud. was
participated in with dignity and
decorum—but only by Prof.
William Shockley.
The debate was structured so
that his opponents were given all
possible advantage; even so, they
felt obliged to make irrelevant
character references and take
clearly empirical statements
personally.
The debate was grossly
mismanaged, and the pointed way
in which Shockley was often
ignored by his fellow panelists is a
sad commentary about the
open-mindedness of our academic
community.
If a debate is this widely
publicized in the future, one can
only hope that an attempt will be
made to find responsible
spokesmen willing to interact in a
courteous, dignified atmosphere.

The Same Mistake
Editor:
I am disturbed over the
closed-mindedness and illogic
displayed by Ms. Gini Faller in her
article entitled "Shockley A
Threat To Us All" (Daily, Jan.
23). Ms. Faller bemoans the
dismissal of Bruce Franklin
(whose only "crime" consisted of
airing his views), then turns
around and urges the identical
action to be taken against
Shockley. Certainly the Franklin
decision was an irresponsible
mistake. So why make the same
mistake twice? Why perform the
Administration's task for them?
I wonder how Ms. Faller would
have reacted had the Daily refused
to print her article, judging it to
be "a threat to us." Probably the
same way I will react should her
proposal to dismiss Prof. Shockley
become a reality.
The opinions themselves
expressed by Shockley and his
opponents are irrelevant. I am
concerned with the frightening
fact that Ms. Faller's reverence for
"freedom of speech" seems to
crack under pressure. It would be
nice if she, as well as the many
other members of the "Stanford
community" who would prevent
an unpopular view from being
expressed, would wake up to the
responsibilities of a community
which labels itself "free" and
"academic."

The residents of Escondido
Village have paid $40,000 for the
renovation of the Escondido
Village Cottage, including a
meeting room equipped with a
kitchen and rest room.
However, Escondido Village
residents are not allowed to use
this room for any reason
whatsoever from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.,
Mondays through Fridays. The
reason given by Frank Gallagher is
that having meetings during the
day would be distracting to the
staff. However, by closing only
one door, this meeting room is
entirely set off from the rest of
the building, and has its own
outside entrance.
Further, the residents (and
even the Escondido Village
Council) were not consulted or
even informed of the policy. It
wasn't until a member of the
Escondido Village Executive
Board tried to reserve the room
that this policy became known.
I feel that this problem is
indicative of the attitude of the
Escondido Administration
towards the residents.

Women's Pamphlet
Editor:
There are a multitude of
women students who enter
Stanford every fall. They might be
interested in becoming involved
with women's issues in general or
in women's caucuses in their
individual departments, but they
don't know where to turn.
The CEEW (Committee on the
Education and Employment of
Women) has taken this need into
account and is planning to publish
a pamphlet dealing with women at
Stanford.
This pamphlet will include a
list and description of every
women's organization on campus,
helpful hints on how to get along
as a woman at this university and
finally, a description of what, in
our opinion, it means to be a
Stanford woman.
If you are active in such an
organization, we are requesting
that you write a short description
of its activities and purpose as
well as the way that new students
can become involved. This will, of
course, be beneficial to you in
recruiting new members.
Even if you are not a member
of any specific organization, your
contributions and suggestions will
be much appreciated.
The deadline will be Feb. 2.

'Support Your Local Eskimos'
Editor:
This is the time of year when
numerous U.S. gasoline companies
send out offers for credit cards to
a "select" group of
students—apparently nearly
everyone who was registered for
first quarter. I have received three
of these offers in two days.
I also received—from the
Mohawk Nation, and on
request—a printed message which
I think would be of interest to
you:
"The following gasoline
companies are suing to stop
Eskimos of Alaska's North Slope
from forming their own
municipality. The Eskimos wish
to form a local school district to
keep their kids from being
shipped out, and will use tax
moneys from the oil companies to
do this. Support your local
Eskimos, and do NOT support:
Mobil Oil
Amerada-Hess
Amoco
BP
Humble Oil of Calif.
Phillips Petroleum
Union Oil of Calif."
I urge you to draw your own
conclusions. And if you feel
strongly enough, you might even
use that postage-paid envelope in
your credit card offer to let the
companies know how you feel
about hard human lives as
opposed to easy credit.

decorum—but only by Prof.
William Shockley.
The debate was structured so
that his opponents were given all
possible advantage; even so, they
felt obliged to make irrelevant
character references and take
clearly empirical statements
personally.
The debate was grossly
mismanaged, and the pointed way
in which Shockley was often
ignored by his fellow panelists is a
sad commentary about the
open-mindedness of our academic
community.
If a debate is this widely
publicized in the future, one can
only hope that an attempt will be
made to find responsible
spokesmen willing to interact in a
courteous, dignified atmosphere.

The Same Mistake
Editor:
I am disturbed over the
closed-mindedness and illogic
displayed by Ms. Gini Faller in her
article entitled "Shockley A
Threat To Us All" (Daily, Jan.
23). Ms. Faller bemoans the
dismissal of Bruce Franklin
(whose only "crime" consisted of
airing his views), then turns
around and urges the identical
action to be taken against
Shockley. Certainly the Franklin
decision was an irresponsible
mistake. So why make the same
mistake twice? Why perform the
Administration's task for them?
I wonder how Ms. Faller would
have reacted had the Daily refused
to print her article, judging it to
be "a threat to us." Probably the
same way I will react should her
proposal to dismiss Prof. Shockley
become a reality.
The opinions themselves
expressed by Shockley and his
opponents are irrelevant. I am
concerned with the frightening
fact that Ms. Faller's reverence for
"freedom of speech" seems to
crack under pressure. It would be
nice if she, as well as the many
other members of the "Stanford
community" who would prevent
an unpopular view from being
expressed, would wake up to the
responsibilities of a community
which labels itself "free" and
"academic."

The residents of Escondido
Village have paid $40,000 for the
renovation of the Escondido
Village Cottage, including a
meeting room equipped with a
kitchen and rest room.
However, Escondido Village
residents are not allowed to use
this room for any reason
whatsoever from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.,
Mondays through Fridays. The
reason given by Frank Gallagher is
that having meetings during the
day would be distracting to the
staff. However, by closing only
one door, this meeting room is
entirely set off from the rest of
the building, and has its own
outside entrance.
Further, the residents (and
even the Escondido Village
Council) were not consulted or
even informed of the policy. It
wasn't until a member of the
Escondido Village Executive
Board tried to reserve the room
that this policy became known.
I feel that this problem is
indicative of the attitude of the
Escondido Administration
towards the residents.

Women's Pamphlet
Editor:
There are a multitude of
women students who enter
Stanford every fall. They might be
interested in becoming involved
with women's issues in general or
in women's caucuses in their
individual departments, but they
don't know where to turn.
The CEEW (Committee on the
Education and Employment of
Women) has taken this need into
account and is planning to publish
a pamphlet dealing with women at
Stanford.
This pamphlet will include a
list and description of every
women's organization on campus,
helpful hints on how to get along
as a woman at this university and
finally, a description of what, in
our opinion, it means to be a
Stanford woman.
If you are active in such an
organization, we are requesting
that you write a short description
of its activities and purpose as
well as the way that new students
can become involved. This will, of
course, be beneficial to you in
recruiting new members.
Even if you are not a member
of any specific organization, your
contributions and suggestions will
be much appreciated.
The deadline will be Feb. 2.

'Support Your Local Eskimos'
Editor:
This is the time of year when
numerous U.S. gasoline companies
send out offers for credit cards to
a "select" group of
students—apparently nearly
everyone who was registered for
first quarter. I have received three
of these offers in two days.
I also received—from the
Mohawk Nation, and on
request—a printed message which
I think would be of interest to
you:
"The following gasoline
companies are suing to stop
Eskimos of Alaska's North Slope
from forming their own
municipality. The Eskimos wish
to form a local school district to
keep their kids from being
shipped out, and will use tax
moneys from the oil companies to
do this. Support your local
Eskimos, and do NOT support:
Mobil Oil
Amerada-Hess
Amoco
BP
Humble Oil of Calif.
Phillips Petroleum
Union Oil of Calif."
I urge you to draw your own
conclusions. And if you feel
strongly enough, you might even
use that postage-paid envelope in
your credit card offer to let the
companies know how you feel
about hard human lives as
opposed to easy credit.
