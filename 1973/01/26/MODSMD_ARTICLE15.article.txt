# Living Group Proposals Due
## 
### 
' All proposals for new living groups or special programs must be
submitted in writing to Larry Horton, Associate Dean for Residential
Education, third floor, Old Union, no later than Feb. 1, 1973. Only
written proposals will be considered. This early deadline is necessary
because the configuration must be established before residence staff
for next year can be selected. Sufficient time must also be allowed to
fit the new configuration into the University housing draw, especially
to permit a full description of the 1973-74 housing configuration in
the draw booklet.
Last year five proposals for special housing programs were
submitted, and two of them were implemented this yearâ€”the Synergy
and Dag Hammarskjold Houses. Students may go to the office of the
Dean of Student Affairs or call 321-2300, ext. 3046, for assistance.
The written proposals will be carefully studied by the Dean of
Student Affairs Office, and, when warranted, by Advisory Panels on
Academics and Minority Housing. Proponents may be invited to
discuss their proposal orally before an appropriate advisory group.
