I've noticed that the fire
department runs into problems
any time it has to respond to the
central campus because of those
police department poles in all the
walkways and roads. Usually they
have to cut the chains that hold
the poles in the ground. Docs this
additional response time add to
the fire danger on campus, and is
the fire department trying to do
something about its slow response
time? T.W.H.

Each fire truck sent out in
response to an alarm has a set of
keys that unlock the poles and
chains blocking off roads and
walkways on campus. However,
because of dirt or corrosion the
locks sometimes don't work and
have to be cut. The firemen have
bolt cutters which do the job. It is
possible that the locks are cut to
save time, as it is faster to cut
them than unlock them.
In either case, Assistant Chief
Jack Barr says that it takes about
a minute for the truck to stop and
someone to remove one of the
polesâ€”about the same amount of
time it would take to go through a
crowded intersection. 'They do
slow down our response," said
Barr, "and that is a problem, but
not a serious problem" because
fire department equipment can
reach any point on campus "three
minutes or less from the time we
receive the signal. We'd rather not
have them and our
recommendation is usually that
roads be left open."
For example, the fire
department recommended, that
the road around newly
constructed Escondido V be left
open, but someone in the
University heirarchy must have
weighed other factors and decided

that poles should be put in. It is
"something we have to live with,"
said Barr.

Why is the second floor side
entrance to UGLY permanently
closed? A.B.
The side door is closed for
financial reasons, explained
Robert Goiter, director of Meyer
Library. It would take $14,364.00
a year to pay someone to sit at
the door and monitor the
materials coming out of the
library, and it was decided that
the money would be better spent
on more important services.

It seems that Stanford thiblic
Events has a contradiction in its
ticket policy. As a married
student, I can buy two student
tickets at the regular student price
(a whopping $3.75 each for last
Sunday's Speculum Musical! but
I can purchase only one student
rush ticket. Can you find out the
rationale behind this sinister
policy? P.S.S.
The Stanford Public Events
ticket policy is governed mainly
by financial considerations. They
must cover all expenses from gate
receipts, so naturally they want to
sell as many as possible for regular
or student discount prices. Tf

there are unsold tickets fifteen
minutes before the performance is
to begin they are sold at the
student rush price of $2.00. The
Public Events office loses money
by selling the tickets at $2.00
apiece, so they try to encourage
people to buy tickets at the
regular price by allowing them to
purchase two tickets with one I.I),
card.
