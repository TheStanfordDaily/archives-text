# 'Train Wrecks': Enjoyable Book

### LARRY HUMMER 
Train Wrecks: A Pictorial History
of Accidents on the Main Line, by
Robert C. Reed (Bonanza Books,
New York, 183 pages).
Railroads have had an
important part to play in
American history, and over the
course of that history they have
captured the imagination of a lot
of people. Robert C. Reed is
obviously a railroad freak par
excellence.
He is an English teacher at a
private school in the Washington,
D.C. area who had this thing
about railroad accidents and set
out to find out all about them.
The result is "Train Wrecks," a
very enjoyable and non-technical
book. The text is easy to follow
and it is accompanied by loads of
photographs and contemporary
lithographs of various extravagant
train wrecks.
Indeed, one begins to wonder
how any trains ever got to their
destinations. As Reed puts it in
Chapter Three, entitled 'The
Horrors of Travel," 'Throughout
the Nineteenth Century America
was horrified by a series of
railroad catastrophes as boilers
burst, bridges crumbled, and
engines derailed." The book is
laced with pictures of locomotives
lying in ditches, down cliffs, and
over embankments.
There are also a few pictures of
trains whipping across open
drawbridges, with predictable
results. And in every picture there
appear the crowds of curiosity
seekers swarming over the broken
behemoths and tom-up tracks.
Fascination With Disaster
For indeed, the Victorians may
have been horrified by railroad
disasters but they were also
fascinated, and many prim ladies

in white muslin showed up to
gawk along with school boys.
Reed notes that the
sensationalizing press made the
most out of train wrecks, with
lithographs "drawn on the spot"
that were both gory and
imaginative, to match the
accompanying stories. A train
wreck was downright dramatic
and the poses of the characters in
the illustrations reflect it.
"Appalling disaster on the
Northern Pennsylvania Railroad"
screams one headline from 1856
reproduced in the book. Below
there is an illustration of two
passenger trains meeting head-on,
the locomotives rearing up like
broncos, and cars tumbling every
which-a-way in a mass of fire and
explosion. Fascinating.
What little kid with an electric
train has not at some point taken
time off from ferrying around
plastic army men in a gondola cat
in order to stage a train wreck?
What are the mesmerizing effects
of witnessing two Lionel
locomotives running into each
other at full speed? Or running
down plastic army men?
This spirit finds adult
statement in author Reed. His
book is a cornucopia of grim
delights and some macabre
humor. He mimics in the captions
to the photographs the Victorian
use of words like dreadful and
appalling. In one accident, Reed
notes, "twenty men were crushed
to jelly in the smoking car." The
reader is left with a grim picture
of—who knows what—and a
thankfulness that he wasn't there.
Unfortunately, Reed does not
deal with the psychology of the
public's infatuation with disaster,
probably because he himself is too
subject to it. After all, he did
write this entire book devoted to

the subject of train wrecks.
Damned Glad
People gawk at horrible
calamities because they are
damned glad they were not
involved in them, that they are
still around to see what happened.
They say, "Look what happened
to those poor people." The more
fear of possible involvement in
such a disaster, the more interest.
Fortunately, Reed does not
merely picture one accident after

another. Instead he attempts to
explain the causes of accidents
and what was eventually done to
eliminate them. John H. White,
Curator of Transportation at the
Smithsonian, says in his Preface to
'Train Wrecks" that railroads are
today the safest mode of travel
available to Americans. That
seems true enough, although one
would have to say that passenger
trains no longer seem truly
available.
The division of the book is
such that each chapter specializes
in a different kind of accident.
And Reed does not waste much
time in getting around to what he
sees as the main cause of railroad
accidents: human carelessness.
Victorians saw this too.
Whereas they were content to see
shipwrecks and road accidents as
being in the nature of acts of God,
they placed the blame for railroad
accidents on the railroad
managements. "Railroad
Butchery!" roared the
newspapers. The public saw
accidents as being the result of
shoddy equipment and train
handling. And they were largely
right.

Accidents increased
dramatically in the 1850's, Reed
says, as train speeds were
increased and the practice of
running at night started. American
lines, unlike the British ones, were
largely single-track, which
required the use of sidings so that
trains going opposite directions
could pass each other. Avoiding
accidents meant strict adherence
to the time schedule and a set of
precautionary rules.

But these rules were sometimes
ignored by some train crew and an
accident resulted. The invention
of the telegraph made it possible
to alert other trains to an
off-schedule run. But for
economy reasons, many railroads
refused to install telegraphs. Also
for economy reasons, cars were
built of wood even after the
invention of the steel car, because
wood was cheaper.
Government policies to
encourage railroad building were
based on the number of miles of
track laid. Thus, railroads were
encouraged to build quickly, with
less attention to road beds and
bridges than was really necessary.
Wash-outs and many deaths
resulted.
But there were trade-offs to
such rapid and economical
construction. The United States
had a rail network long before
many other countries such as
Germany had them, and that was
valuable for economic

development. Reed does not
address himself to this
all-important issue, and that is a
sad omission.
Interesting Information
He does give interesting
information on the development
of various safety devices such as
the Westinghouse air brake and
steam heating (which replaced
fire-causing coal stoves).
Eventually, he notes, trains
became safer and safer, as the

technology improved and as
safety regulations were more
strictly enforced.
Americans often call
themselves an ahistorical people,
for Lord only knows what
reasons. It probably makes
everybody feel more modern. It is
certainly not because America
does not have a rich history.
People just do not bother
themselves about it and so remain
woefully ignorant.
They are missing out on some
amazing stories, even if they reject
the idea that history can teach
anything of modern applicability.
For the reader who wants a light
introduction to the history of
railroad transportation systems
heavilv laced with a curious
sensationalism,"Train Wrecks" is
made to order.
