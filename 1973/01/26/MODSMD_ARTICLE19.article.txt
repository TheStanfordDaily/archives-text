# Kelley Brightens Basketball Outlook
## The 						Stanford Daily SPORTS 
### BILL CLASTER 
Unlike past years, most of the
talk about Stanford's basketball
outlook does not concern the
future of Coach Howie Dallmar's
job. Rather, possibilities such as
beating UCLA and USC and
getting a bid to the National
Invitational Tournament are far
more frequently discussed. Rich
Kelley, a 7-0 sophomore center, is
much of the reason for this
change in topics.
Kelley is Stanford's best big
man in almost a decade. From
1964, when center Tom Dose
ended his career as Stanford's
all-time top scorer (since
surpassed by Claude Terry), until
last season, the Cardinals had a
succession of guard-oriented
teams. Top shooting guards such
as Art Harris, Don Griffin, and
Terry provided the nucleus during
these lean years. While these
teams were exciting at times, they
were only able to produce an
84-118 overall won/loss record.
Throughout these seasons one
glaring weakness remained
constant—the lack of a big man
who could rebound as well as
shoot. The addition of Kelley has
solved this problem. And while
Stanford is not yet an awesome
basketball power, it is well on its
way to regaining the respectability
it lost during the sixties and early
seventies.
But Kelley was not the most
difficult player that Coach

Dallmar has ever recruited. Over
100 schools tried to get the big
center, but they hardly had a
chance. A resident of nearby
Woodside, he has always lived in
the immediate area and both his
parents are Stanford graduates.
Considered UCLA
Still Kelley contends that he

looked at things objectively. "I
did consider UCLA and USC for a
while. In the end, though, I chose
Stanford because it provided the
best balance between athletics and
academics."
Kelley's biggest asset is his
mobility. He shoots with a soft
touch, passes well, and is able to
dribble the ball effectively.
Evidence of his agility can be
found on the tennis court. The
number-three man on his
Woodside High School
championship tennis team, he was
one half of the league's doubles
champions. While he is not varsity
tennis caliber at Stanford, he
certainly could be playing at
many other schools.
The talented sophomore is
currently averaging 16.2 points

and 12.8 rebounds per game. He is
shooting 50 percent from the field
and has almost three times as
many rebounds as Mike Mann, the
team's second leading rebounder.
But Kelley has yet to reach his
full potential.
He is currently getting most of
his points on tip-ins and short

jumpers, and has rarely displayed
his hook shot. He notes, "I don't
really have confidence in my hook
yet. I've shot thousands in
practice the last couple years, but
I don't feel good with it in
games."
Confident Player
With the exception of his hook
shot, Kelley is a very confident
player. As he puts it, "For the last
two years I've thought about
varsity and how nervous I'd
probably be when it finally
started. But now that I'm playing,
I don't feel a thing. I'm really
surprised at my lack of
nervousness."
Perhaps a good part of Kelley's
confidence was built up in his
freshman year. Although not
eligible to play varsity last year,
he was certainly good enough to
be the starting center. However an
inexperienced and uncertain
freshman with as much pressure
on him as Kelley would have had

could easily have lost much of his
confidence.
As it was, the slender
seven-footer led the Frosh in both
scoring and rebounding. More
importantly he improved his
offensive moves and worked on
his outlet passes off defensive
rebounds.

Thus, when this season started,
Kelley was well-prepared. Having
developed a good upper body
fake, he is able to get his shot off
against anyone. While some
centers like UCLA's Bill Walton
have sent a few of Kelley's shots
back at him, the Cardinal big man
has not lost his cool. He notes,
"Sure I was aware of Walton. I've
seen him on TV a lot and I know
what he can do. No matter where
he is, you always think he's on
you. Still I wasn't rattled by
him—l just wasn't shooting well."

Defensively, Kelley adds a new
dimension to the Stanford game.
He is not an exceptional leaper,
nor is the 228-pounder
particularly strong. However his
superb timing and excellent
reactions make opposing players
aware of his presence. He doesn't
block shots in the Walton style,
but he does intimidate shooters.
Moreover, the knowledge that
Kelley is behind them enables his
teammates to play more of a
gambling defense. They are able
to play their men closer—they
know that Kelley's there to help
them out.
Consistent
Perhaps Kellev's best quality is
his consistency. Only rarely does
he have a bad game. Furthermore,
his value as contrasted to that of a
good guard was illustrated by the
Utah game. Against a small team
like Utah, an outside-shooting
guard would have had to work
just as hard for his points as he
would against a big team. But for
the 7-0 Kelley, things were easier.
He was able to do almost anything
he wanted as illustrated by his 12
field goals in 15 attempts and a
total of 30 points.
While it is unlikely that it will
always be so easy for Kelley, one
thing is certain: Stanford is a far
more stable team with him in the
line-up. He assures that the
Cardinals can rebound and play
defense with anyone. This
stability is the contrast with the
past and the hope for the future.

TALENTED SOPH — Rich Kelley, Stanford's seven foot center, is the
first big man to come to The Farm in ten years. Kelley leads the team
in scoring and rebounding, and is second in the conference in
rebounds, behind All-American Bill Walton of UCLA.
