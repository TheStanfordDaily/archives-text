# Escondido Residents Approve Rent Report

### CHRISTY WISE 
Reaction to the Escondido Village
Residents' Report on Rents has been
"favorable" according to Charles
Williams, co-chairman of the ad hoc
committee which proposed seven
recommendations to assist the
Escondido Village Administration in
keeping costs and rents to a minimum.
The report was first officially
presented at the January meeting of
the Escondido Village Council. At the
meeting, Frank Gallagher, manager of
the Village, announced his approval,
stating he concurs with all but one of
the recommendations.
That recommendation, suggesting
that dormitories and fraternities assume
responsibility for payment of one of
the high-rise apartments, was termed
"inequitable and inappropriate," by
Edward Scoles, director of residences
and food services.
The other recommendations
propose participation and
encouragement of student input in
Escondido Village financial matters;
the application of Budget Adjustment
Program procedures to the Village
budget; encouragement of endowment
support for Escondido Village; a
moratorium on all construction until
there is a demonstrated need for
additional housing; and a continuous
program of communication from the
Escondido Village administration to
the residents on financial matters.
Williams observed, "Almost
everyone in the Village agrees with the
findings of the report. My feelings are
that the administration thought it was
inflammatory. We didn't think so.
Some people felt the report should
have been stronger."
Scoles commented that the report
seems "to exaggerate the situation. It
sounds as though we've never done
anything at all to respond, when we
have." He claims the administration
has been "ahead of the report in many
respects."
William Faught, another

co-chairman of the ad hoc committee,
responded to Gallagher's claim that
four of the recommendations had
already been implemented with the
statement. "Financial and
communications problems still
exist ....Saying that the
recommendations have been
implemented will not make the
problems go away," Faught said.
A committee is presently being
organized in conjunction with the
Committee on Student Services
(COSS) to implement some of the
proposals. The committee will concern
itself with financial aspects of the
Village and will work under the
direction of the council.
Tentatively, the committee will
consist of one or two members of
COSS, three residents of Escondido
Village, a representative from the Dean
of Students office and Gallagher.
Williams said the Dean of Students
office has been "very encouraging,
quite helpful, quite concerned and
quite interested."

meeting, Frank Gallagher, manager of
the Village, announced his approval,
stating he concurs with all but one of
the recommendations.
That recommendation, suggesting
that dormitories and fraternities assume
responsibility for payment of one of
the high-rise apartments, was termed
"inequitable and inappropriate," by
Edward Scoles, director of residences
and food services.
The other recommendations
propose participation and
encouragement of student input in
Escondido Village financial matters;
the application of Budget Adjustment
Program procedures to the Village
budget; encouragement of endowment
support for Escondido Village; a
moratorium on all construction until
there is a demonstrated need for
additional housing; and a continuous
program of communication from the
Escondido Village administration to
the residents on financial matters.
Williams observed, "Almost
everyone in the Village agrees with the
findings of the report. My feelings are
that the administration thought it was
inflammatory. We didn't think so.
Some people felt the report should
have been stronger."
Scoles commented that the report
seems "to exaggerate the situation. It
sounds as though we've never done
anything at all to respond, when we
have." He claims the administration
has been "ahead of the report in many
respects."
William Faught, another

co-chairman of the ad hoc committee,
responded to Gallagher's claim that
four of the recommendations had
already been implemented with the
statement. "Financial and
communications problems still
exist ....Saying that the
recommendations have been
implemented will not make the
problems go away," Faught said.
A committee is presently being
organized in conjunction with the
Committee on Student Services
(COSS) to implement some of the
proposals. The committee will concern
itself with financial aspects of the
Village and will work under the
direction of the council.
Tentatively, the committee will
consist of one or two members of
COSS, three residents of Escondido
Village, a representative from the Dean
of Students office and Gallagher.
Williams said the Dean of Students
office has been "very encouraging,
quite helpful, quite concerned and
quite interested."
