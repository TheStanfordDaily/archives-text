# Swimmers Face Preps
## 
### MIKE CHASSON 
Stanford's swimming team
hopes to get back on the winning
track when they face the Santa
Clara Swim Club today at 3 p.m.
Santa Clara is comprised
entirely of high school swimmers
during the school year. During the

summer they are joined by many
collegiate swimmers such as
Stanford's Brian Job, John
Hencken, Martin Pedley, Richard
Cook, and Randy Whitchurch.
While not as strong as in the
past, Santa Clara still boasts
swimmers that will give Stanford
some good races.
Santa Clara's top swimmer is
Joe Bottom, who is being sought
by numerous collegiate swim
coaches. Bottom has placed in
AAU National Championships in
both butterfly and freestyle. He
has lifetime bests of 21.0 in the
50 free and 46.3 in the 100 free,
with season bests of 21.3 and
46.5. No Stanford sprinter has
matched those times so far this
season.
Lending support to Bottom is
his younger brother, Mike, Brian
Roux, and Jeff Roy. The younger
Bottom can swim fly, the IM, and
the sprints if needed. Roux is a
butterflyer who had one of the
fastest high school 100 flys in the
country last season. Roy excels
at both butterfly and freestyle.
The rest of the Santa Clara
squad consists of many younger
swimmers, who will be tough to
beat in a year or two, but
shouldn't give the Cardinals
problems this afternoon.
This is Stanford's final tune-up
for its second Pacific Eight meet
of the season against UCLA next
Saturday at the Encina Pools.
