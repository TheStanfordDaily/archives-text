Egads, sportsfans! The Daily's
amazing Lola was a perfect nine
for nine last week, to run her
season record to an incredible 12

And to top it all off, Lola has
forseen two point spreads exactly,
in a performance that would make
Major Hoople turn green with
envy.
Lola and the Cardinals should
roll this weekend, and the Bruins
should win their 61st straight
against Notre Dame tomorrow
night. Her predictions:
