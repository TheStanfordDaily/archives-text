# Gymnastics Provides Aesthetic Enjoyment
## 
### PHIL HUBBARD 
To a hard-core football or basketball fan, Stanford gymnastics
doesn't seem to offer much at first glance. There is no constantly
roaring crowd, no one shouting obscenities at the officials and
opposing team. There are no scantily clad dollies dancing on the
sidelines. The band rarely shows up, and when they do, they seem less
obnoxious than usual.
A man stuffing a hot dog down his mouth with a can of beer by his
side feels a little out of place at a gymnastics meet.
This is not to say that a gymnastics contest is dull. Far from it.
Gymnastics is exciting and entertaining, and possibly the most
aesthetically pleasing sport of all, but it is also an individual sport.
Only one gymnast performs at a time, as the spectators keep, their
eyes glued to each smooth and subtly intricate move, the silence
broken only by occasional muffled "oohs" or "aahs" and the squeak
of the apparatus.
For those who have never seen a gymnastics meet, some
explanation may be necessary. First the gymnasts warm up, stretching
out their muscles and practicing moves in their respective events. As
contrasted with the rigid, paramilitary calisthenics of a football team,
a gymnastics warmup is a symphony of moving bodies, twisting,
swinging, and leaping across the floor below.
Combination of Skills
After the warmup and the introduction of the teams, the first event
the floor exercise, begins. The floor exercise must consist of tumbling,
balance, leaps, strength movements, and smooth transitional elements,
all combined in a rhythmatical whole. It includes moves like flips,
handsprings, splits, and handstands.
The second event is the side or pommeled horse. This event must
be composed of clean swings, without stops, and both forward and
backward scissors movements. It requires tremendous upper body
strength, as well as balance and flexibility.
The rings event is next. It consists of alternation between swinging,
slow strength movements, and hold parts, all of which is done while
trying to hold the unstable rings in a stationary position.
After the rings comes a short intermission, a sort of "halftime."
Sometimes this period is used to give non-competitive exhibitions or a
trampoline performance. Before the last three events begin, the
gymnasts come out and do their warmup once again.
The Vault
The long horse vault leads off the second half. In the vault, the
gymnasts sprint down a runway, leap onto a springboard, and flip
themselves off the end of the horse, sometimes adding a twist or other
move, trying to land as gracefully and balanced as possible.
Next comes the parallel bars, which must consist of swinging,
flying, holding, and strength parts, with the swinging and flight moves
predominating.
The final event, the high bar, must be composed of clean swings
without stops, and movements of changing rhythm.
All of the events are scored on a 0-10.0 scale by four judges. The
top and bottom scores for each gymnast are ignored, and the middle
two averaged. A 10.0 score would represent a creative, daring,
aesthetic and technically perfect routine.
A non-scoring event, at least in dual meets, is the all-around, which
consists of the total scorc in all six events. People in the Stanford area
have the unique opportunity to see two-time Olympian Steve Hug, the
1972 NCAA all-around champion and widely acclaimed as the top
all-around gymnast for the U.S. at Munich.
Other Stanford stars are Ted Marcy, the 1971 and '72 AAU side
horse champ, Howard Bessen, 6th in the NCAA on the rings last year,
and Bob Anderson, acclaimed as the top all-around high school
gymnast in 1971.
