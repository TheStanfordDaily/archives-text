# Card Cagers Face UC Santa Barbara
## 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
Stanford will match its height
against UC-Santa Barbara's
quickness tonight when the two
teams meet in an 8 p.m. game at
Santa Barbara.
Stanford assistant coach Billy
Jones, who coached at Santa
Barbara for two years before
coming here, says that the
Gauchos "are small, but they're a
very good ball club.
"We'll have to get out in front
early," Jones said. "There's a
possibility that they might hold
the ball on us if they get ahead."
Santa Barbara's quick starting
five averages only 6-4 compared
to 6-6 for Stanford, but the
Gauchos' record stands at an
impressive 8-5. Most of those
victories have come at home,
where Santa Barbara is extremely
tough in cozy Robertson
Gymnasium.
.500 Record
Coach Howie Dallmar's Cards
will take a 7-7 record into
tonight's contest, having evened
their season mark last Saturday
with an 80-71 victory over Utah
at Maples Pavilion.
Seven foot sophomore center
Rich Kelley scored 30 points
against the Utes, connecting on 12
of 15 field goal attempts and 6-8
from the free throw line. Kelley
also had 12 rebounds and no
turnovers in a performance that
earned him the distinction of
Northern California co-player of
the week along with Santa Clara's
Mike Stewart.
Kelley's outstanding effort
against Utah was complemented
by the play of fast-improving
freshman Tim Patterson. The 6-11
Patterson came off the bench to
contribute 16 points, seven
rebounds, and five assists in his
most complete performance of
the season.

"Tim doesn't realize he's a
freshman," - Dallmar said. "He's
amazingly confident and it's great
to see him get better and better
each week."
No Lineup Change
Dallmar plans to give Patterson
plenty of playing time tonight but
he indicated that the same lineup
that opened the game against
Utah will start again tonight.
Kelley, Mike Mann, Dave Frost,
Mel Arterberry, and Mark Gilberg
will start for the Cards, but
Dallmar stressed that "we'll
continue to substitute freely, and
we are just not going to place a lot
of emphasis on who starts from
week to week."
Substitutes who should see
considerable action are Patterson,
Bob Buell, Steve Shupe, and Scott
Trobbe.
After his 30 point effort
against Utah, Kelley has moved
far ahead in the Stanford scoring
statistics. He is now averaging
16.2 points a game, while Dave
Frost is the only other Card
player in double figures, scoring at
an 11.4 clip.
Mann Slumping
Mike Mann, who opened the
season with 16 and 24 point
performances against USF and
Arizona, has seen his average fall

to 9.7 after scoring only five
points in the Cards' last three
outings. Arterberry, Buell, and
Patterson are all averaging near
seven points a game.
Santa Barbara's scoring
statistics are amazingly balanced,
with four of the Gaucho starters
averaging between 10 and 13
points a game. Jones regards 6-2

senior guard Bob Schacter, a three
year starter averaging 12.3 points
per game, as Santa Barbara's top
individual performer.
Stanford will resume its Pac-8
schedule next Saturday afternoon
in Berkeley when the Cards face
the Bears in a regionally televised
contest. Stanford's conference
record currently stands at 1-3.

AFTER THE RECORD — John Wooden, college basketball's active
coach with the most career wins, guided his UCLA Bruins to their
60th-straight win last night, an 87-73 win over Loyola of Chicago. The
Bruin streak spans three seasons, and ties the collegiate record set a
decade ago by Bill Russell and USF. The Bruins go after win number
61 tomorrow night against Notre Dame.
