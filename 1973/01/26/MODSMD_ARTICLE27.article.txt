# Askea, Klippert, Merlo Head List
## Pros Eye Stanford Gridders

Stanford football stars Jim
Merlo, Younger Klippert, Mike
Askea, and Eric Cross all have an
excellent chance to be selected in
the National Football League
draft next month, according to
Stanford coach Jack Christiansen
and sources in professional
football.
Coach Christiansen believes
that Askea, a 6-4, 260 lb.
offensive tackle, and Klippert, a
6-3, 240 lb. guard, may have the
best chances to be drafted. He
expects Cross and Merlo to be
selected, despite their relatively
small size, and believes linemen
Roger Cowan and Pierre Perrault
may also be selected. Linebacker
Pat Moore and defensive halfback
Charles McCloud may also be
draft possibilities.
"It kind of depends on who
needs what," noted Christiansen,
"and there aren't as many good
offensive linemen in the nation
this year. Askea has a good chance
to go pretty high, and Klippert
will probably be drafted.
"Merlo came on strong for us
as a junior, and this fall he had an
outstanding year. He showed in
the bowl games he's played in
(last year's Rose Bowl, and the
Hula Bowl and East-West Shrine
game this season) that he has the
speed and size to play
linebacker," Christiansen said.
Talented Receiver
"Every now and then a guy
comes out of college like (Randy)

Vataha, who's only 5-9 or 5-10. I
think Eric (Cross) will probably
be drafted," Christiansen said,
noting that the talented receiver
stands only 5-11.
The 180-pounder from
Alameda led the Pac-Eight in
Receiving this season. Christiansen
believes Cross'speed (4.6 in the
40) can make up for his lack of
size.
"He impressed the pro scouts
with his speed and quickness, and
he could conceivably be a backup
receiver and specialist,"
Christiansen pointed out.
Skeptical
Askea appears to be somewhat
skeptical concerning the draft.
"I've heard that I might go fairly
high, but it's hard to know where
you're going to go. They really
leave you out in left field."
As with Cross, size appears to
be a factor in determining Merlo's
chances. At 6-2 and 220, the
talented linebacker is somewhat
smaller than the "ideal"
linebacker size of about 6-3 and
240 lbs. But Merlo made a
number of tackles in this year's
East-West game, and undoubtedly
impressed pro scouts with his
hard-hitting play.
"I think I have a pretty good
chance to go fairly high," Merlo
stated. "The pros may consider
me a little short, but there are a
lot more guys in pro football who
are smaller. Mike Simone (former
Stanford linebacker now playing
for the Denver Broncos) is 20 lbs.

lighter and three inches shorter
than I am."
Problems With 7x>ne Defenses
Concerning Cross' size, Ron
Wolfe, director of player
personnel for the Oakland
Raiders, said, "The fact that he
doesn't have ideal height will
cause a great deal of concern,
particularly with the zone
defense."
Dick Nolan, head coach of
the San Francisco Forty-Niners,
disagreed with Wolfe saying that
size won't be so important. "For a
flanker and a linebacker both guys
(Cross and Merlo) have the height
for their positions. Guys like Dave
Wilcox are exceptional. People
who are 6-3 and 240—there aren't
too many of them around; you
don't always get the ideal 6-3 or
6-4.
"I remember Chris Hanburger
of the Redskins weighed 205
pounds when he came out of
college," Nolan continued, "and
when he got into the pros he went
to 225, and he's one of the best
around. Size just isn't going to be
a factor.
"I think they (Askea, Klippert,
Merlo, and Cross) will be
drafted," Nolan said. "In the past
Stanford has had the top ones,
and they've gone very high in the
draft. The guys we have—Gene
Washington, John Brodie, and
Paul Wiggin (now an assistant
coach)—they're good ones."
