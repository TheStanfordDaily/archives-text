Nixon Asks For Budget Cuts
WASHINGTON — President Nixon's fiscal 1974
budget will call for drastic cutbacks in many of
Lyndon B. Johnson's Great Society programs, all in
the effort of keeping inflation under control.
Among the agencies that will be affected by the
economy drive is the Office of Economic
Opportunity, scheduled to be broken up and its
responsibilities placed in other agencies.
The budget is expected to total around $268
billion or $269 billion, an increase of about $19
billion from the current fiscal year. This is
considered relatively small in view of the rapidly
expanding economy, growing population, and new
federal services.
It will be one of the tightest budgets in recent
years according to officials in the Office of
Management and Budget. Nixon will send the
massive document to Congress Monday.
Rockets Strike U.S. Base
SAIGON — A Viet Cong rocket attack on the Bien

Hoa Air Base near Saigon early Friday — just two
days before the scheduled cease-fire — killed a U.S.
Marine and wounded 21 Americans destined to go
home soon, the U.S. Command said.
The 27 rockets came in a surge of Viet Cong
action that has killed dozens of South Vietnamese
soldiers and damaged an American warship.
"The war's still on," said a U.S. Marine
commander. "You can hear the whine of jet engines
now. The rocket caught the guard in the open about
2:30 a.m. He probably never had a chance to get
under cover, although it is available. You can't live
under a sandbag 24 hours a day."
Marine officers said the victim had been at Bien
Hoa since last May, when two Marine squadrons
arrived there as part of a U.S. build-up to counter a
North Vietnamese invasion in South Vietnam. Like
all other Americans, he would have gone home
within 60 days of the signing of the cease-fire
agreement in Paris tomorrow.
LBJ Buried At His Ranch
STONEWALL, Tex. — Former President Lyndon B.

Johnson was laid to rest yesterday in the ranch
cemetery where his family members have been
buried for three-quarters of a century.
It was a dismal afternoon, with rain falling and
the threat of snow, but just before the ceremonies
the skies began to clear somewhat. The footing was
churned to mud by hometown folk and the nation's
great coming to pay Johnson homage.
"No one could ever understand Lyndon Johnson
unless they understood the land and the people
from which he came. His roots were deep in this hill
country. They were also deep in the religious
heritage of this country," the Rev. Dr. Graham said.
Johnson, 64, was fatally stricken Monday at the
ranch house, a quarter mile from the cemetery
where he was buried.
Today's Weather
Fair today and tonight. Increasing cloudiness
tomorrow with chance of rain in the afternoon.
Low tonight in the low 30s to low 40s. Highs today
and tomorrow in the 50s. Northwest wind 5 to 15
mph becoming southerly 10 to 20 mph tomorrow.

LBJ Buried At His Ranch
STONEWALL, Tex. — Former President Lyndon B.

Johnson was laid to rest yesterday in the ranch
cemetery where his family members have been
buried for three-quarters of a century.
It was a dismal afternoon, with rain falling and
the threat of snow, but just before the ceremonies
the skies began to clear somewhat. The footing was
churned to mud by hometown folk and the nation's
great coming to pay Johnson homage.
"No one could ever understand Lyndon Johnson
unless they understood the land and the people
from which he came. His roots were deep in this hill
country. They were also deep in the religious
heritage of this country," the Rev. Dr. Graham said.
Johnson, 64, was fatally stricken Monday at the
ranch house, a quarter mile from the cemetery
where he was buried.
Today's Weather
Fair today and tonight. Increasing cloudiness
tomorrow with chance of rain in the afternoon.
Low tonight in the low 30s to low 40s. Highs today
and tomorrow in the 50s. Northwest wind 5 to 15
mph becoming southerly 10 to 20 mph tomorrow.
Nixon Asks For Budget Cuts
WASHINGTON — President Nixon's fiscal 1974
budget will call for drastic cutbacks in many of
Lyndon B. Johnson's Great Society programs, all in
the effort of keeping inflation under control.
Among the agencies that will be affected by the
economy drive is the Office of Economic
Opportunity, scheduled to be broken up and its
responsibilities placed in other agencies.
The budget is expected to total around $268
billion or $269 billion, an increase of about $19
billion from the current fiscal year. This is
considered relatively small in view of the rapidly
expanding economy, growing population, and new
federal services.
It will be one of the tightest budgets in recent
years according to officials in the Office of
Management and Budget. Nixon will send the
massive document to Congress Monday.
Rockets Strike U.S. Base
SAIGON — A Viet Cong rocket attack on the Bien

Hoa Air Base near Saigon early Friday — just two
days before the scheduled cease-fire — killed a U.S.
Marine and wounded 21 Americans destined to go
home soon, the U.S. Command said.
The 27 rockets came in a surge of Viet Cong
action that has killed dozens of South Vietnamese
soldiers and damaged an American warship.
"The war's still on," said a U.S. Marine
commander. "You can hear the whine of jet engines
now. The rocket caught the guard in the open about
2:30 a.m. He probably never had a chance to get
under cover, although it is available. You can't live
under a sandbag 24 hours a day."
Marine officers said the victim had been at Bien
Hoa since last May, when two Marine squadrons
arrived there as part of a U.S. build-up to counter a
North Vietnamese invasion in South Vietnam. Like
all other Americans, he would have gone home
within 60 days of the signing of the cease-fire
