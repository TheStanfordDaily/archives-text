# New Course Review Rates Major Classes
## 
### RIC WEILAND 
A new, innovative course evaluation
by students, designed to provide
feedback to students, professors, and
administrators, has appeared in the
form of the ASSU Course Review.
The ASSU Course Review was
originated by ASSU co-president Brent
Appel to provide a "comprehensive,
statistically-based method of
evaluation." Last quarter students
participated in "grading" 76
undergraduate courses. According to
Appel, the ASSU asked every
department to distribute the ASSU's
course-evaluation questionnaires in all
its major lecture courses so that the
most heavily-attended courses would
be sampled.
After keypunching and computer
output of statistics, the information
will be edited to produce a verbal
catalogue with relevant statistics
included. The catalogue will be
available this spring in time for
preregistration for fall quarter, Appel
says.
Although the idea of a course
review is not new here, the systematic
approach has never been tried. Ellen
Nold, director of the Writing Center
also uses student feedback in order to
evaluate the freshman English classes,

Freshman Seminars and Writing Center
Courses.
According to Nold, course
evaluations are examined and the
instructor is told the relevant results.
If, after two quarters, any required
improvement is not seen, the course is
decertified.
In the pasf, only the instructor of a
writing course received the evaluation,
and then only if he himself requested
it from his students. Now someone
"higher up" — Nold — has the power
to hold the quality of education here
at peak levels.
Besides evaluating courses, Nold
and others are reconsidering their
methods of evaluation. The evaluation
techniques of the past have been
inconsistent, Nold says. David Levine
of the ASSU Course Review Board
says the ASSU questionnaire is
"basically good," but the intent of
some of its questions are being
examined and the questionnaire
adjusted accordingly.
There has been some resistance to
evaluation, says Nold. Many
instructors feel that if the evaluation
system isn't perfect, then the system
isn't good enough to be taken
seriously. But Nold says "any method
is preferred to none at all."
