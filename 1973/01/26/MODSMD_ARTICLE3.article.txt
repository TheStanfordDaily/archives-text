# Stanford Museum Houses Many Relics
## From Bicycles To Baskets 
### BRUCE KADDEN 
One of the most worthwhile
educational opportunities available on
campus is not found in a classroom or
offered as a course. The Leland
Stanford Jr. Museum houses many
interesting objects which represent
many cultures, past and present,
throughout the world.
Behind its doors lie artifacts from
Egyptian, Oriental, and Indian
societies, paintings from European
countries, and reminiscents of the
Stanford family.
The museum has a vibrant schedule
of temporary exhibitions, which are

shown in the Miedel Room and at the
nearby Thomas Welton Stanford Art
Gallery to accompany its permanent
displays.
Currently, an exhibition of "Recent
Works by Richard Randell" is on
display in the Art Gallery. It contains
sculptures, made in 1972, of various
sizes and proportions but based on
only two different shapes that appear
in several variations: a rectangle and a
rainbow-like curve.
Museum History
The museum dates back to the
founding of the University. It was the
idea of Mrs. Leland Stanford (Jane
Lathrop), who initially conceived of
it as a repository for the various objects,
including a bicycle and toy soldiers,
collected by Leland Jr., who died in
1884 at the age of 16.
The museum was built in the
Neo-Classic "Grecian Style," and was
opened in 1894. In 1898 the north
and south annexes were built into the
original structure.
Between the time of the museum's
inception and her death in 1905, Mrs.
Stanford extended the museum's
collections through such purchases as
the Ikeda Collection of Oriental Art
and the Cesnola Collection of Cyprist

Pottery, examples of which are now
permanently on view.
Earthquake Damage
During the 1906 earthquake, the
north and south wings collapsed,
causing extensive damage to the
collection.
For 40 years after the earthquake,
the museum suffered from neglect and
indifference, and as a result was closed
from 1945-1954 for reorganization
and partial renovation.
Dr. Francoise Forster-Hahn, a
lecturer in art history and museum
curator, believes the museum has
entered into its most vital phase during
the past decade.
"The last 10 years have put the
museum on the map," said Dr.
Forster-Hahn. She credits the changes
largely to work done by Prof. Lorenz
Eitner, Chairman of the Art
Department.
'The Last Spike'
"The museum has progressed past
'The Last Spike' stage," she
commented, believing it now includes
a wider range of interesting displays.
But "The Last Spike" will still attract
many observers.
It is a 17.6 carat gold replica of a
