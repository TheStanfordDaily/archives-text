# Stanford Museum Houses Many Relics
## From Bicycles To Baskets 
### BRUCE KADDEN 
One of the most worthwhile
educational opportunities available on
campus is not found in a classroom or
offered as a course. The Leland
Stanford Jr. Museum houses many
interesting objects which represent
many cultures, past and present,
throughout the world.
Behind its doors lie artifacts from
Egyptian, Oriental, and Indian
societies, paintings from European
countries, and reminiscents of the
Stanford family.
The museum has a vibrant schedule
of temporary exhibitions, which are

shown in the Miedel Room and at the
nearby Thomas Welton Stanford Art
Gallery to accompany its permanent
displays.
Currently, an exhibition of "Recent
Works by Richard Randell" is on
display in the Art Gallery. It contains
sculptures, made in 1972, of various
sizes and proportions but based on
only two different shapes that appear
in several variations: a rectangle and a
rainbow-like curve.
Museum History
The museum dates back to the
founding of the University. It was the
idea of Mrs. Leland Stanford (Jane
Lathrop), who initially conceived of
it as a repository for the various objects,
including a bicycle and toy soldiers,
collected by Leland Jr., who died in
1884 at the age of 16.
The museum was built in the
Neo-Classic "Grecian Style," and was
opened in 1894. In 1898 the north
and south annexes were built into the
original structure.
Between the time of the museum's
inception and her death in 1905, Mrs.
Stanford extended the museum's
collections through such purchases as
the Ikeda Collection of Oriental Art
and the Cesnola Collection of Cyprist

Pottery, examples of which are now
permanently on view.
Earthquake Damage
During the 1906 earthquake, the
north and south wings collapsed,
causing extensive damage to the
collection.
For 40 years after the earthquake,
the museum suffered from neglect and
indifference, and as a result was closed
from 1945-1954 for reorganization
and partial renovation.
Dr. Francoise Forster-Hahn, a
lecturer in art history and museum
curator, believes the museum has
entered into its most vital phase during
the past decade.
"The last 10 years have put the
museum on the map," said Dr.
Forster-Hahn. She credits the changes
largely to work done by Prof. Lorenz
Eitner, Chairman of the Art
Department.
'The Last Spike'
"The museum has progressed past
'The Last Spike' stage," she
commented, believing it now includes
a wider range of interesting displays.
But "The Last Spike" will still attract
many observers.
It is a 17.6 carat gold replica of a
railroad spike, and was driven in by
Leland Stanford during a special
ceremony at Promontory Utah, where
the Central Pacific and Union Pacific
tracks met.
It is on display in the museum
along with the "Nevada Spike," made
of pure Virginia City silver.
Other Stanford family momentos
on display include the uniform worn
by Stanford when he was Governor of

California during the Civil War and
pictures of the Stanford homes in
Sacramento and San Francisco.
Leland Jr.'s Momentos
Leland Jr.'s remembrances,
including his collections and personal
possessions, fulfill the original purpose
of the museum.
Some of the more noteworthy
objects are models of the world's most
famous diamonds, presented to him as
a gift from Tiffany Co., and a leaf
from a magnolia tree planted by
George Washington at Mt. Vernon.
Another current exhibition includes
examples of American Indian Art, a
collection which dates back to the last
decade of the nineteenth century
when Mrs. Stanford donated objects of
Hopi, Navajo, Pima, Plains, and
Northern California Indian Arts.
The display includes baskets from
the Southwestern Indians and Indians
of Northern California, pottery of the
prehistoric Indian cultures, several
"Chief's Blankets," examples of
Navajo silver jewelry, and highly
decorated beadwork of the Plains
Indians.
Also exhibited are sacred images
made in New Mexico and Colorado

from 1750-1860. The images, called
Santos, represent Saints, the Holy
Family, and the Crucifixion.
A selection of color lithographs
from John Audubon's "The
Viviparous Quadrupeds of North
America" (1845-48) testifies to the
avid interest and exploration of
America throughout the 19th century.
A case of early American silver
including examples of the silversmith
Paul Revere (1735-1818) add to the
display of 19th century art. The seven
pieces are from the "Marble Collection
of Early American Silver."
Time Machine
Stepping into the room
representing pre-dynastic Egypt is like
walking into a time machine. The
oldest object is a pre-dynastic vase
from the Nagada Culture, dated
6500-5500 B.C.
One complete mummy and parts of
others highlight the display.
Other Egyptian art includes
jewelry, sacred animals, sandstone
casts, and bronze statuettes.
Jade Collection
The Frank E. Buck Collection of
Jade ranges from bowls and vases to
animals such as the water buffalo. A

four-fold screen with 12 carved
plaques dominates the jade exhibit.
Jade is one of the hardest stones
known to man and is precious to the
Chinese. The carvings are from the
Ming and Ch'ing dynasties.
Hanging scrolls, depicting various
Chinese serenes emphasize the
educational aspect of the museum.
The display was put up in connection
with Prof. Michael Sullivan's Chinese
art course. The scrolls are done in ink
and light colors on paper.
European paintings and antique
furniture is highlighted by a set of
limestone columns from northern
Italy. The six pillars contain floral and
animal designs, and were made in the
11th century.
Pop Art
The Marie Stauffer Sigall Room
displays objects of modern art. One
large painting done entirely in black
and white depicts a great variety of
scenes. The careful observer can pick
out a space capsule, a traffic jam, a
swimmer, and a football game among
other things.
The museum hours are Tuesday
through Friday, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.;
Saturday and Sunday, 1-5 p.m.

shown in the Miedel Room and at the
nearby Thomas Welton Stanford Art
Gallery to accompany its permanent
displays.
Currently, an exhibition of "Recent
Works by Richard Randell" is on
display in the Art Gallery. It contains
sculptures, made in 1972, of various
sizes and proportions but based on
only two different shapes that appear
in several variations: a rectangle and a
rainbow-like curve.
Museum History
The museum dates back to the
founding of the University. It was the
idea of Mrs. Leland Stanford (Jane
Lathrop), who initially conceived of
it as a repository for the various objects,
including a bicycle and toy soldiers,
collected by Leland Jr., who died in
1884 at the age of 16.
The museum was built in the
Neo-Classic "Grecian Style," and was
opened in 1894. In 1898 the north
and south annexes were built into the
original structure.
Between the time of the museum's
inception and her death in 1905, Mrs.
Stanford extended the museum's
collections through such purchases as
the Ikeda Collection of Oriental Art
and the Cesnola Collection of Cyprist

Pottery, examples of which are now
permanently on view.
Earthquake Damage
During the 1906 earthquake, the
north and south wings collapsed,
causing extensive damage to the
collection.
For 40 years after the earthquake,
the museum suffered from neglect and
indifference, and as a result was closed
from 1945-1954 for reorganization
and partial renovation.
Dr. Francoise Forster-Hahn, a
lecturer in art history and museum
curator, believes the museum has
entered into its most vital phase during
the past decade.
"The last 10 years have put the
museum on the map," said Dr.
Forster-Hahn. She credits the changes
largely to work done by Prof. Lorenz
Eitner, Chairman of the Art
Department.
'The Last Spike'
"The museum has progressed past
'The Last Spike' stage," she
commented, believing it now includes
a wider range of interesting displays.
But "The Last Spike" will still attract
many observers.
It is a 17.6 carat gold replica of a
railroad spike, and was driven in by
Leland Stanford during a special
ceremony at Promontory Utah, where
the Central Pacific and Union Pacific
tracks met.
It is on display in the museum
along with the "Nevada Spike," made
of pure Virginia City silver.
Other Stanford family momentos
on display include the uniform worn
by Stanford when he was Governor of

California during the Civil War and
pictures of the Stanford homes in
Sacramento and San Francisco.
Leland Jr.'s Momentos
Leland Jr.'s remembrances,
including his collections and personal
possessions, fulfill the original purpose
of the museum.
Some of the more noteworthy
objects are models of the world's most
famous diamonds, presented to him as
a gift from Tiffany Co., and a leaf
from a magnolia tree planted by
George Washington at Mt. Vernon.
Another current exhibition includes
examples of American Indian Art, a
collection which dates back to the last
decade of the nineteenth century
when Mrs. Stanford donated objects of
Hopi, Navajo, Pima, Plains, and
Northern California Indian Arts.
The display includes baskets from
the Southwestern Indians and Indians
of Northern California, pottery of the
prehistoric Indian cultures, several
"Chief's Blankets," examples of
Navajo silver jewelry, and highly
decorated beadwork of the Plains
Indians.
Also exhibited are sacred images
made in New Mexico and Colorado

from 1750-1860. The images, called
Santos, represent Saints, the Holy
Family, and the Crucifixion.
A selection of color lithographs
from John Audubon's "The
Viviparous Quadrupeds of North
America" (1845-48) testifies to the
avid interest and exploration of
America throughout the 19th century.
A case of early American silver
including examples of the silversmith
Paul Revere (1735-1818) add to the
display of 19th century art. The seven
pieces are from the "Marble Collection
of Early American Silver."
Time Machine
Stepping into the room
representing pre-dynastic Egypt is like
walking into a time machine. The
oldest object is a pre-dynastic vase
from the Nagada Culture, dated
6500-5500 B.C.
One complete mummy and parts of
others highlight the display.
Other Egyptian art includes
jewelry, sacred animals, sandstone
casts, and bronze statuettes.
Jade Collection
The Frank E. Buck Collection of
Jade ranges from bowls and vases to
animals such as the water buffalo. A

four-fold screen with 12 carved
plaques dominates the jade exhibit.
Jade is one of the hardest stones
known to man and is precious to the
Chinese. The carvings are from the
Ming and Ch'ing dynasties.
Hanging scrolls, depicting various
Chinese serenes emphasize the
educational aspect of the museum.
The display was put up in connection
with Prof. Michael Sullivan's Chinese
art course. The scrolls are done in ink
and light colors on paper.
European paintings and antique
furniture is highlighted by a set of
limestone columns from northern
Italy. The six pillars contain floral and
animal designs, and were made in the
11th century.
Pop Art
The Marie Stauffer Sigall Room
displays objects of modern art. One
large painting done entirely in black
and white depicts a great variety of
scenes. The careful observer can pick
out a space capsule, a traffic jam, a
swimmer, and a football game among
other things.
The museum hours are Tuesday
through Friday, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.;
Saturday and Sunday, 1-5 p.m.
One of the most worthwhile
educational opportunities available on
campus is not found in a classroom or
offered as a course. The Leland
Stanford Jr. Museum houses many
interesting objects which represent
many cultures, past and present,
throughout the world.
Behind its doors lie artifacts from
Egyptian, Oriental, and Indian
societies, paintings from European
countries, and reminiscents of the
Stanford family.

founding of the University. It was the
idea of Mrs. Leland Stanford (Jane
Lathrop), who initially conceived of
it as a repository for the various objects,
including a bicycle and toy soldiers,
collected by Leland Jr., who died in
1884 at the age of 16.
The museum was built in the
Neo-Classic "Grecian Style," and was
opened in 1894. In 1898 the north
and south annexes were built into the
original structure.
Between the time of the museum's
inception and her death in 1905, Mrs.
Stanford extended the museum's
collections through such purchases as
the Ikeda Collection of Oriental Art
and the Cesnola Collection of Cyprist

Pottery, examples of which are now
permanently on view.
Earthquake Damage
During the 1906 earthquake, the
north and south wings collapsed,
causing extensive damage to the
collection.
For 40 years after the earthquake,
the museum suffered from neglect and
indifference, and as a result was closed
from 1945-1954 for reorganization
and partial renovation.
Dr. Francoise Forster-Hahn, a
lecturer in art history and museum
curator, believes the museum has
entered into its most vital phase during
the past decade.
"The last 10 years have put the
museum on the map," said Dr.
Forster-Hahn. She credits the changes
largely to work done by Prof. Lorenz
Eitner, Chairman of the Art
Department.
'The Last Spike'
"The museum has progressed past
'The Last Spike' stage," she
commented, believing it now includes
a wider range of interesting displays.
But "The Last Spike" will still attract
many observers.
It is a 17.6 carat gold replica of a
railroad spike, and was driven in by
Leland Stanford during a special
ceremony at Promontory Utah, where
the Central Pacific and Union Pacific
tracks met.
It is on display in the museum
along with the "Nevada Spike," made
of pure Virginia City silver.
Other Stanford family momentos
on display include the uniform worn
by Stanford when he was Governor of

California during the Civil War and
pictures of the Stanford homes in
Sacramento and San Francisco.
Leland Jr.'s Momentos
Leland Jr.'s remembrances,
including his collections and personal
possessions, fulfill the original purpose
of the museum.
Some of the more noteworthy
objects are models of the world's most
famous diamonds, presented to him as
a gift from Tiffany Co., and a leaf
from a magnolia tree planted by
George Washington at Mt. Vernon.
Another current exhibition includes
examples of American Indian Art, a
collection which dates back to the last
decade of the nineteenth century
when Mrs. Stanford donated objects of
Hopi, Navajo, Pima, Plains, and
Northern California Indian Arts.
The display includes baskets from
the Southwestern Indians and Indians
of Northern California, pottery of the
prehistoric Indian cultures, several
"Chief's Blankets," examples of
Navajo silver jewelry, and highly
decorated beadwork of the Plains
Indians.
Also exhibited are sacred images
made in New Mexico and Colorado

from 1750-1860. The images, called
Santos, represent Saints, the Holy
Family, and the Crucifixion.
A selection of color lithographs
from John Audubon's "The
Viviparous Quadrupeds of North
America" (1845-48) testifies to the
avid interest and exploration of
America throughout the 19th century.
A case of early American silver
including examples of the silversmith
Paul Revere (1735-1818) add to the
display of 19th century art. The seven
pieces are from the "Marble Collection
of Early American Silver."
Time Machine
Stepping into the room
representing pre-dynastic Egypt is like
walking into a time machine. The
oldest object is a pre-dynastic vase
from the Nagada Culture, dated
6500-5500 B.C.
One complete mummy and parts of
others highlight the display.
Other Egyptian art includes
jewelry, sacred animals, sandstone
casts, and bronze statuettes.
Jade Collection
The Frank E. Buck Collection of
Jade ranges from bowls and vases to
animals such as the water buffalo. A

four-fold screen with 12 carved
plaques dominates the jade exhibit.
Jade is one of the hardest stones
known to man and is precious to the
Chinese. The carvings are from the
Ming and Ch'ing dynasties.
Hanging scrolls, depicting various
Chinese serenes emphasize the
educational aspect of the museum.
The display was put up in connection
with Prof. Michael Sullivan's Chinese
art course. The scrolls are done in ink
and light colors on paper.
European paintings and antique
furniture is highlighted by a set of
limestone columns from northern
Italy. The six pillars contain floral and
animal designs, and were made in the
11th century.
Pop Art
The Marie Stauffer Sigall Room
displays objects of modern art. One
large painting done entirely in black
and white depicts a great variety of
scenes. The careful observer can pick
out a space capsule, a traffic jam, a
swimmer, and a football game among
other things.
The museum hours are Tuesday
through Friday, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.;
Saturday and Sunday, 1-5 p.m.
One of the most worthwhile
educational opportunities available on
campus is not found in a classroom or
offered as a course. The Leland
Stanford Jr. Museum houses many
interesting objects which represent
many cultures, past and present,
throughout the world.
Behind its doors lie artifacts from
Egyptian, Oriental, and Indian
societies, paintings from European
countries, and reminiscents of the
Stanford family.
The museum has a vibrant schedule
of temporary exhibitions, which are

shown in the Miedel Room and at the
nearby Thomas Welton Stanford Art
Gallery to accompany its permanent
displays.
Currently, an exhibition of "Recent
Works by Richard Randell" is on
display in the Art Gallery. It contains
sculptures, made in 1972, of various
sizes and proportions but based on
only two different shapes that appear
in several variations: a rectangle and a
rainbow-like curve.
