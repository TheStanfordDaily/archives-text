# Shockley Speech Postponed
## 
### 
The Cornell Club of Northern California has postponed a scheduled
speech by Electrical Engineering Prof. William Shockley on the geneticity
of IQ, planned for last night in San Francisco.
Club president Poe Fratt decided to postpone the speech after Students
for a Democratic Society (SDS) announced plans to demonstrate against
Shockley's appearance at the University Club wine cellar. Nearly 100
persons had paid for reservations.
Fratt said his decision was based on concern for potential physical harm
to older alumni who planned to come and were unaware of the
demonstration. To continue the talk as scheduled would be "an
unnecessary risk, as much as I abhor the idea that the guy can't speak his
piece," Fratt said yesterday.
Fratt also said he planned to talk with Shockley and arrange another
opportunity for the Cornellians to hear him at a later date. Shockley's talk
was one of several announced early this fall in a mailing to 3000 Northern
California alumni.
Shockley, who was willing to speak despite the protest, said that the
planned demonstration was "a symptom of the times" and added that the
SDS had "an extreme form of distrust of truth in academia."
