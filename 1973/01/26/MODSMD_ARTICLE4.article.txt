# Faculty Senate Approves Closing Vienna Campus
## 
### MARK SIMONIAN 
The Faculty Senate yesterday voted
unanimously to approve a resolution
from its Committee on Foreign Study
Programs (C-FSP) to close down the
present Stanford in Austria campus.
The C-FSP statement recommended
that the lease on the Vienna site be
terminated, but stressed that this
action in no way prejudiced Vienna as
a location for the development of
other programs. The committee also
requested the Austrian Subcommittee
to explore new alternatives for the
Austrian campus and submit them at a
later date.
Prof. Clark Reynolds of the Food
Research Institute cited the Vienna
Campus' financial problems as a chief
factor in his committee's decision to
advocate an end to the Austrian
program.
"There is, in fact, a very heavy

subsidy of those going to Vienna, both
by those who are going to other
programs abroad, but also by the
University at large, amounting to
approximately $2000 per student.
This weighed very heavily in our
decision," he stated.
Reynolds added, "We were thinking
not 'Have many wonderful things
come out of the Vienna program?',
but 'Does it make sense to have the
rest of the programs subsidize the
Vienna program under its present
contractural form?' It didn't seem to
the majority of the committee that
there were compelling arguments to
continue with the program in its
present form at that cost."
With this Senate approval, the
Vienna campus closing passes to
Provost William Miller, who, earlier
this month, expressed his intent to end
the Austrian program at the end of
summer quarter this year.
$80,000 Deficit
In his report to the faculty body
yesterday, Miller pointed to an
expected $80,000 deficit that the
University faces due to low enrollment
at the Vienna campus as a good reason
to terminate the campus lease.
However, he emphasized that "we
haven't removed the Vienna money
from the budget" in the hopes that the
funds can be utilized to establish
"provocative and far-reaching
proposals for strengthening Stanford's
Overseas Study Program." This, he
suggested, did not rule out the
possibility of a new Vienna campus.
In other Senate business, faculty
representatives considered affirmative
action proposals to increase the
number of women and minority group
members in the enrollment pools of
the graduate schools.
Faculty Program
Provost Miller presented the
preliminary results of the faculty

affirmative action program, stating
that during 1972 the University hired
22 women, nine blacks, and five
Chicanos out of a total of 90 new
faculty members.
Associate Dean of Graduate Studies
J. Merrill Carlsmith continued with a
report of the Study of Graduate
Education outlining the improvement
of graduate school equity toward
women and minority students. He
suggested that admissions of women
and minorities were increasing steadily
in the graduate programs and that no
discernable discrimination occurred in
the granting of financial aids.
Psychology Prof. Eleanor Maccoby
presented the most controversial bill
of the day, a substitute resolution on
affirmative action separating women's
problems from minority admissions
and providing strict guidelines for
deciding whether women are poorly
represented.
The bill also provides for annual
progress reports by the Dean of
Graduate Studies and the Faculty
Affirmative Action Officer.
Challenge
The Maccoby resolution stemmed
from a challenge to the Senate
Steering Committee Report, authored
by Asst. Sociology Prof. Francesca
Cancian and presented at the last
Senate meeting two weeks ago.
The Cancian report suggested a
publicity campaign to emphasize
graduate study opportunities for
women, increased admission
flexibility, and the allocation of
financial resources specifically for
affirmative action programs.
The study also suggested that
academic departments with fewer than
40 percent women graduate students
encourage female applicants with
welcoming brochures and information
designed to elicit their interest.
