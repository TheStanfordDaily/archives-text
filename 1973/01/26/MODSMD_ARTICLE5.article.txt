# Cease-Fire Plans Finalized
## 
### 
From the Associated Press
Diplomats and military men worked yesterday to make
ready for tomorrow's cease-fire in Vietnam.
Secretary of State William Rogers, who will sign the
peace agreement for the United States tomorrow in Paris,
met with Canadian, Indonesian, and United Nations
officials to discuss final plans for the international peace
force which will patrol the cease-fire.
The 1160-man truce supervision force, made up of
Canadians, Hungarians, Poles, and Indonesians, is
expected to begin arriving in Vietnam within 48 hours
after the cease-fire takes effect at 4 p.m. PST tomorrow.
Cambodia announced yesterday that, although the
cease-fire does not extend to its territory, its forces will
cease offensive operations against Communist units in its
territory at the same time the cease-fire takes effect in
Vietnam.
Communist forces are required by the agreement to
withdraw from Cambodia within 60 days.
60-Day Minimum
In Washington, Rogers met Canada's foreign minister,
Mitchell Sharp, who announced after the meeting that his
nation's delegation to the truce team will stay in Vietnam
a minimum of 60 days.
Whether Canadians will stay longer depends on
"whether we will be effective," Sharp said.
Canada has participated in a number of unsuccessful
international peace-keeping efforts in the past, and was
reluctant to contribute to the Vietnam force unless the
probability of effectiveness was high.

UN Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim told Rogers that
any peacekeeping by the UN in Vietnam will depend upon
whether the "participants wish us to play such a role."
Rogers also met with Adam Malik, foreign minister of
Indonesia, who said his country's peacekeeping force will
leave for Saigon even before tomorrow's signing ceremony
in Paris.
In Saigon, South Vietnamese premier Nguyen Van
Thieu said yesterday that if the Communists violate the
cease-fire, his government will get support from many
other nations.
Agnew Arriving
Asked if he meant the United States, Thieu said, "Let's
see in a few days." Vice President Spiro Agnew arrives in
Saigon Sunday, and there is speculation that he may
promise Thieu continued American support.
Nguyen Duy Trinh, North Vietnam's foreign minister,
arrived in Paris yesterday morning. He promised that his
country will live up to the accords, and hoped that all
other parties would also do so.
The four will sign the agreement tomorrow morning.
Then tomorrow afternoon, a nearly identical
agreement affecting only the United States and North
Vietnam will be signed.
The bifurcated procedure, was set up to satisfy South
Vietnam and the Viet Cong, neither of which recognizes
the other's existence. The four-party covenant, the only
one which they will sign, does not mention the parties by
name.

Diplomats and military men worked yesterday to make
ready for tomorrow's cease-fire in Vietnam.
Secretary of State William Rogers, who will sign the
peace agreement for the United States tomorrow in Paris,
met with Canadian, Indonesian, and United Nations
officials to discuss final plans for the international peace
force which will patrol the cease-fire.
The 1160-man truce supervision force, made up of
Canadians, Hungarians, Poles, and Indonesians, is
expected to begin arriving in Vietnam within 48 hours
after the cease-fire takes effect at 4 p.m. PST tomorrow.
Cambodia announced yesterday that, although the
cease-fire does not extend to its territory, its forces will
cease offensive operations against Communist units in its
territory at the same time the cease-fire takes effect in
Vietnam.
Communist forces are required by the agreement to
withdraw from Cambodia within 60 days.
60-Day Minimum
In Washington, Rogers met Canada's foreign minister,
Mitchell Sharp, who announced after the meeting that his
nation's delegation to the truce team will stay in Vietnam
a minimum of 60 days.
Whether Canadians will stay longer depends on
"whether we will be effective," Sharp said.
Canada has participated in a number of unsuccessful
international peace-keeping efforts in the past, and was
reluctant to contribute to the Vietnam force unless the
probability of effectiveness was high.

UN Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim told Rogers that
any peacekeeping by the UN in Vietnam will depend upon
whether the "participants wish us to play such a role."
Rogers also met with Adam Malik, foreign minister of
Indonesia, who said his country's peacekeeping force will
leave for Saigon even before tomorrow's signing ceremony
in Paris.
In Saigon, South Vietnamese premier Nguyen Van
Thieu said yesterday that if the Communists violate the
cease-fire, his government will get support from many
other nations.
Agnew Arriving
Asked if he meant the United States, Thieu said, "Let's
see in a few days." Vice President Spiro Agnew arrives in
Saigon Sunday, and there is speculation that he may
promise Thieu continued American support.
Nguyen Duy Trinh, North Vietnam's foreign minister,
arrived in Paris yesterday morning. He promised that his
country will live up to the accords, and hoped that all
other parties would also do so.
The four will sign the agreement tomorrow morning.
Then tomorrow afternoon, a nearly identical
agreement affecting only the United States and North
Vietnam will be signed.
The bifurcated procedure, was set up to satisfy South
Vietnam and the Viet Cong, neither of which recognizes
the other's existence. The four-party covenant, the only
one which they will sign, does not mention the parties by
name.
