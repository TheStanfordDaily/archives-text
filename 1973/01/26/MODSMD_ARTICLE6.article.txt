## Fire Safety 
### 
Once again a campus tragedy was narrowly averted Wednesday
night when fire demolished one Manzanita Park trailer and heavily
damaged another. This fire is yet another addition to a list of
near-tragedies which includes blazes at Junipero, Lathrop and
Manzanita again.
Clearly this campus has had its share of serious fires in recent years
and our luck at avoiding deaths or serious injuries can't last forever. In
light of Wednesday's blaze, all members of this community should do
some serious thinking about fire safety.
Many people are again asking if the Manzanita trailers are as safe as
they should be. First of all, the trailers meet all fire codes for trailer
parks. Admittedly the trailers do present some different hazards than
more permanent residences, but as Fire Chief Frank Jurian says"the
trailer wasn't the cause of the fire." Wednesday's fire was caused by
extremely careless behavior and no amount of constructional
safeguards could have prevented the blaze.
Jurian and Director of Residences and Fraternities Alan Cummings
admit that there are some additional safety features which could be
utilized in the trailer park and which they intend to explore. We agree
that installation of emergency exits such as panels which can be
kicked out, especially in sleeping areas, should be considered. More
alarm boxes should be installed in Manzanita as well.
Some people have suggested that sprinklers and fireproof carpets
be installed and that fire retardants be extensively used in the trailers,
but the cost of such measures would be prohibitive. However we urge
the University to carefully study improvement of safety precautions
in Manzanita and just as importantly, we urge all of our readers to be
more careful and place a higher emphasis on fire safety. Common
sense could have prevented Wednesday's fire.
Many campus residents frequently exhibit extreme carelessness.
Over half the individual dorm room fires in the last five years have
been caused by candles. Candles are admittedly aesthetic, but their
use should be carefully regulated. Special caution should be used with
hanging candles.
Among the other dangers which people frequently overlook are
overloaded electrical outlets, waterbed heaters and storage of
motorcycles inside of buildings. Although fire marshals frequently
inspect campus buildings, they cannot go into dormitory rooms
uninvited and accordingly residents must personally guard against
potential fire hazards in their rooms.
One of the biggest problems faced by University officials is
vandalism and theft of emergency fire equipment. Fire officials often
have to replacc extinguishers and hose nozzles, unclog fire horns and
rewire alarms. Remember, this equipment is meant to protect human
lives. People who tamper with or steal such equipment are committing
crimes and no one should hesitate to report such actions to the police.
A person has to be somewhat deranged to damage emergency
equipment.
Perhaps most importantly, don't overlook the basic aspects of fire
safety. Make note of where exits and alarm boxes are. Make sure all
your telephones have emergency number stickers. If you live in a
campus residence, you can usually get an emergency number sticker
from your RA or house director. The Fire Department also distributes
the stickers to all offices. If your office or residence is out of stickers,
call the Fire Department for more. If you discover a Fire hazard, call
the Fire Department at 322-6868 or extension 2313.
University officials have a responsibility to see that general
conditions are as safe as possible, but the effectiveness of their efforts
will be greatly limited if people don't cooperate. Make sure you are
fully aware of safety procedures and don't take foolish risks. You
can't be too careful where fires are concerned.

crimes and no one should hesitate to report such actions to the police.
A person has to be somewhat deranged to damage emergency
equipment.
Perhaps most importantly, don't overlook the basic aspects of fire
safety. Make note of where exits and alarm boxes are. Make sure all
your telephones have emergency number stickers. If you live in a
campus residence, you can usually get an emergency number sticker
from your RA or house director. The Fire Department also distributes
the stickers to all offices. If your office or residence is out of stickers,
call the Fire Department for more. If you discover a Fire hazard, call
the Fire Department at 322-6868 or extension 2313.
University officials have a responsibility to see that general
conditions are as safe as possible, but the effectiveness of their efforts
will be greatly limited if people don't cooperate. Make sure you are
fully aware of safety procedures and don't take foolish risks. You
can't be too careful where fires are concerned.
Once again a campus tragedy was narrowly averted Wednesday
night when fire demolished one Manzanita Park trailer and heavily
damaged another. This fire is yet another addition to a list of
near-tragedies which includes blazes at Junipero, Lathrop and
Manzanita again.
Clearly this campus has had its share of serious fires in recent years
and our luck at avoiding deaths or serious injuries can't last forever. In
light of Wednesday's blaze, all members of this community should do
some serious thinking about fire safety.
Many people are again asking if the Manzanita trailers are as safe as
they should be. First of all, the trailers meet all fire codes for trailer
parks. Admittedly the trailers do present some different hazards than
more permanent residences, but as Fire Chief Frank Jurian says"the
trailer wasn't the cause of the fire." Wednesday's fire was caused by
extremely careless behavior and no amount of constructional
safeguards could have prevented the blaze.
Jurian and Director of Residences and Fraternities Alan Cummings
admit that there are some additional safety features which could be
utilized in the trailer park and which they intend to explore. We agree
that installation of emergency exits such as panels which can be
kicked out, especially in sleeping areas, should be considered. More
alarm boxes should be installed in Manzanita as well.
Some people have suggested that sprinklers and fireproof carpets
be installed and that fire retardants be extensively used in the trailers,
but the cost of such measures would be prohibitive. However we urge
the University to carefully study improvement of safety precautions
in Manzanita and just as importantly, we urge all of our readers to be
more careful and place a higher emphasis on fire safety. Common
sense could have prevented Wednesday's fire.
Many campus residents frequently exhibit extreme carelessness.
Over half the individual dorm room fires in the last five years have
been caused by candles. Candles are admittedly aesthetic, but their
use should be carefully regulated. Special caution should be used with
hanging candles.
Among the other dangers which people frequently overlook are
overloaded electrical outlets, waterbed heaters and storage of
motorcycles inside of buildings. Although fire marshals frequently
inspect campus buildings, they cannot go into dormitory rooms
uninvited and accordingly residents must personally guard against
potential fire hazards in their rooms.
One of the biggest problems faced by University officials is
vandalism and theft of emergency fire equipment. Fire officials often
have to replacc extinguishers and hose nozzles, unclog fire horns and
rewire alarms. Remember, this equipment is meant to protect human
lives. People who tamper with or steal such equipment are committing
crimes and no one should hesitate to report such actions to the police.
