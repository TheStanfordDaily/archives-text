## 'Great Debate' A Success 
### 
icharles ogletree

The "Great Debate" has finally
occurred. Now one must ponder
the question of what was actually
stated in verbal as well as
non-verbal terms.
All in all the 'The Great
Debate" should be termed
successful. First, Dr. Shockley's
theories on the linkage between
genetic factors and intelligence
quotients were never
substantiated and inaccuratedly
applied. Although the charts and
graphs utilized in the dissertation
could possibly be considered in a
sense accurate, they do not in any
way correlate with his scientific
data concerning intelligence.
The most interesting part of
the debate, however, was the
arguments presented by Brother
Prof. Cedric X. The continual
hissing and other minor forms of
disruptions replicate the patterned
response expected from a
predominantly white middle class
audience in a predominantly,
white middle class environment
(Stanford University). I personally
commend Prof. Cedric X for
having the courage to defend his
ideological beliefs and in the same
instance refute the theories of
Prof. Shockley. It was evident
that the audience was seeking a
method of refuting Shockley's
theories rather than presenting a
viable alternative (if one is capable
of understanding this dichotomy).
Promotion Vs. Preservation
Conversely, one element is
interested in promoting his race,
which his theories can attest to
and the other element is
interested in preserving his race,
which is also readily visible.
The conclusion one must draw
is that the victor in the debate was
that element which is most
representative in accord to each
individual'sideological beliefs. The
two elements which resulted from
the debate were:
(1) Shockley's views were
heard and refuted.
(2) Prof. Cedric X's views were
heard, not understood,
and refuted.
Those Black students who were
able to hear Prof. Cedric X

thoroughly explain his views prior
to his debate with Shockley, were
able to leave the debate with a
much clearer understanding of
precisely why the audience did
not understand his views and thus
were not willing to consider their
validity.
My overall conclusion is that
those who want to know the truth
will go beyond the information
presented in the debate. Is there a
genocidal process of racial
extinction being perpetrated in
America?
To answer this question, one
must consider several givens;
among them are:
1. Shockley's views being
widely publicized;

2. Zero Population Growth;
3. Sickle Cell Anemia and its
implications;
4. The concept of good vs. bad
genes;
5. The concept of Social
Darwinism;
6. The substantive amount of
interest stimulated concerning
Black/white dissimilarities.
If these points are given
thorough intellectual
consideration, one will find no
difficulty in answering the
preceding question. The issue is
clear. What direction will you
pursue?

presented in the debate. Is there a
genocidal process of racial
extinction being perpetrated in
America?
To answer this question, one
must consider several givens;
among them are:
1. Shockley's views being
widely publicized;

2. Zero Population Growth;
3. Sickle Cell Anemia and its
implications;
4. The concept of good vs. bad
genes;
5. The concept of Social
Darwinism;
6. The substantive amount of
interest stimulated concerning
Black/white dissimilarities.
If these points are given
thorough intellectual
consideration, one will find no
difficulty in answering the
preceding question. The issue is
clear. What direction will you
pursue?

The "Great Debate" has finally
occurred. Now one must ponder
the question of what was actually
stated in verbal as well as
non-verbal terms.
All in all the 'The Great
Debate" should be termed
successful. First, Dr. Shockley's
theories on the linkage between
genetic factors and intelligence
quotients were never
substantiated and inaccuratedly
applied. Although the charts and
graphs utilized in the dissertation
could possibly be considered in a
sense accurate, they do not in any
way correlate with his scientific
data concerning intelligence.
The most interesting part of
the debate, however, was the
arguments presented by Brother
Prof. Cedric X. The continual
hissing and other minor forms of
disruptions replicate the patterned
response expected from a
predominantly white middle class
audience in a predominantly,
white middle class environment
(Stanford University). I personally
commend Prof. Cedric X for
having the courage to defend his
ideological beliefs and in the same
instance refute the theories of
Prof. Shockley. It was evident
that the audience was seeking a
method of refuting Shockley's
theories rather than presenting a
viable alternative (if one is capable
of understanding this dichotomy).
Promotion Vs. Preservation
Conversely, one element is
interested in promoting his race,
which his theories can attest to
and the other element is
interested in preserving his race,
which is also readily visible.
The conclusion one must draw
is that the victor in the debate was
that element which is most
representative in accord to each
individual'sideological beliefs. The
two elements which resulted from
the debate were:
(1) Shockley's views were
heard and refuted.
(2) Prof. Cedric X's views were
heard, not understood,
and refuted.
Those Black students who were
able to hear Prof. Cedric X

thoroughly explain his views prior
to his debate with Shockley, were
able to leave the debate with a
much clearer understanding of
precisely why the audience did
not understand his views and thus
were not willing to consider their
validity.
My overall conclusion is that
those who want to know the truth
will go beyond the information
presented in the debate. Is there a
genocidal process of racial
extinction being perpetrated in
America?
