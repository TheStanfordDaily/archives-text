# 'life and death struggle'
## Competition In English 
### 
jerry coleman

Some of you may have read
this Monday's lead article on
pre-med competition. Today I'd
like to report a true story proving
that pre-meds have not cornered
the red hot market.
My story concerns an English
class: (Yes, even the humanities
have been infected with the
get-ahead ethic.) "American
Humor," five units, interesting
material, and no prerequisites.
It sounded like the perfect
elective course to get away from
all the hustle and hassle. 120
others must have thought so as
well, for that number
approximates the total
enrollment.
Victory
I'll skip telling you how we had
to change rooms twice, or
couldn't get books for two weeks.
Suffice it to say that late in the
second week the instructor won a
victory with the bookstore and
started class by telling us the
news:
"The books have been in the
store basement for days," he
began, "but they had to very
carefully mark the price on each
one. They assure me the books
will be on the shelf this
afternoon ....

"But there are only 80 of the
books so you'll just have to share
or use three reserve shelf copies in
the library. A new shipment may
take weeks."
Interruption
The day's lecture began
without further announcement
but was interrupted ten minutes
later as a student slowly rose and
exited.
Ten more minutes passed and
three more classmates slipped out.
There were sighs from some in
class as the sound of the deserters'
bike chains rattled in.
Ten minutes left in class: the
instructor reaches for his own,
personal copy of the book to read
a selection from Mark Twain, and
five students get up in mid-row,
snake their way to the aisle, then
dart out without a backward
glance.
'Gimme That Joint'
Twain's first words are
drowned out by the comments of
students still in class—"What red
hots!" "Jesus Kele-riste!" "How
rude!" and "Gimme that joint!"
Teach reads on, some listeners
get their ponchos ready (it was
one of those primevil flood days),
and the clock's hands move
toward their inexorable destiny.
The reading is finished and the
concluding lecture comments are
begun. These statements,
normally picked up by a hundred
pens, fall on deaf ears and hands
too occupied to write.
From somewhere in the bowels
of the University Physical Plant, a
transistor switches on, activating
the campus bell system—it is 2:05.
Before the instructor can even
finish his last sentence, the entire
remainder of the class (70 or so)
leaves. But my story is not over
yet. Hardly: the fun has just
begun.
A great crowd of students
starts the exodus from Geology
corner (the only available room
big enough for the class in that
time slot) to the bookstore. As I
get on my bicycle my roommate
shouts, "We can share the book;
but don't take your time getting
up there."
Book Rush
Making my way toward lower
White Plaza I pass walking
students denouncing the whole

book-rush as stupid. Their
ten-speed-cyclist-classmates have
begun, by this time, a mini Tour
de France along the Quad.
I turn up White Plaza and see
one male begin running to catch
up with those already near the
fountain. Two females near me
shout. "Hey—he's running!" and
off they go.
In fact, each new group of
students turning the corner from
the Quad to White Plaza begins to
run, their ponchos flapping
behind them. One shocked
observer whispered to a friend, "If
God had meant man to fly, He
would have given him wings, not
water-proof plastic."
Life And Death
Fifty of us converge on the
bookstore steps at once and all
notice the "Place Leave All
Articles Outside" sign. Once a
mere annoyance, this request now
means the difference between
academic life and death.
We crowd into the bookstore, a
new speeding figure replacing each
previous one in the doorway. All
the check ladies look up,
confused. Two blacks selling
Socialist Worker newspapers
comment, "What the f—?"
The mass pushes up the stairs
toward the English bookshelf,
while others come down, books in
hand, shouting "I've got one!"
We reach an empty shelf.
But I go around back, see a
cart, and the last six copies. As I
reach in the cry goes up "There
they are—quick!" and I barely
escape.
The next scene Stakes place at
the checkstand. There are five
lines, each ten deep. As we get out
our check books to pay the $6.25
tab, a girl can be heard going up
each line offering to buy
anybody's copy for $10.
So who doesn't get the
books—who gets penalized? The
ones who refused to take part in
this madness. Maybe good
sportsmanship just doesn't count
anymore.
Well I won't stand for it. I'm
willing to take my book out of its
safe deposit box and give it up to
anyone . .. anyone who bids the
best price. Step right up, folks!

this madness. Maybe good
sportsmanship just doesn't count

anyone . .. anyone who bids the
best price. Step right up, folks!

Some of you may have read
this Monday's lead article on
pre-med competition. Today I'd
like to report a true story proving
that pre-meds have not cornered
the red hot market.
My story concerns an English
class: (Yes, even the humanities
have been infected with the
get-ahead ethic.) "American
Humor," five units, interesting
material, and no prerequisites.
It sounded like the perfect
elective course to get away from
all the hustle and hassle. 120
others must have thought so as
well, for that number
approximates the total
enrollment.
Victory
I'll skip telling you how we had
to change rooms twice, or
couldn't get books for two weeks.
Suffice it to say that late in the
second week the instructor won a
victory with the bookstore and
started class by telling us the
news:
"The books have been in the
store basement for days," he
began, "but they had to very
carefully mark the price on each
one. They assure me the books
will be on the shelf this
afternoon ....

"But there are only 80 of the
books so you'll just have to share
or use three reserve shelf copies in
the library. A new shipment may
take weeks."
Interruption
The day's lecture began
without further announcement
but was interrupted ten minutes
later as a student slowly rose and
exited.
Ten more minutes passed and
three more classmates slipped out.
There were sighs from some in
class as the sound of the deserters'
bike chains rattled in.
Ten minutes left in class: the
instructor reaches for his own,
personal copy of the book to read
a selection from Mark Twain, and
five students get up in mid-row,
snake their way to the aisle, then
dart out without a backward
glance.
'Gimme That Joint'
Twain's first words are
drowned out by the comments of
students still in class—"What red
hots!" "Jesus Kele-riste!" "How
rude!" and "Gimme that joint!"
Teach reads on, some listeners
get their ponchos ready (it was
one of those primevil flood days),
and the clock's hands move
toward their inexorable destiny.
The reading is finished and the
concluding lecture comments are
begun. These statements,
normally picked up by a hundred
pens, fall on deaf ears and hands
too occupied to write.
From somewhere in the bowels
of the University Physical Plant, a
transistor switches on, activating
the campus bell system—it is 2:05.
Before the instructor can even
finish his last sentence, the entire
remainder of the class (70 or so)
leaves. But my story is not over
yet. Hardly: the fun has just
begun.
A great crowd of students
starts the exodus from Geology
corner (the only available room
big enough for the class in that
time slot) to the bookstore. As I
get on my bicycle my roommate
shouts, "We can share the book;
but don't take your time getting
up there."
Book Rush
Making my way toward lower
White Plaza I pass walking
students denouncing the whole

book-rush as stupid. Their
ten-speed-cyclist-classmates have
begun, by this time, a mini Tour
de France along the Quad.
I turn up White Plaza and see
one male begin running to catch
up with those already near the
fountain. Two females near me
shout. "Hey—he's running!" and
off they go.
In fact, each new group of
students turning the corner from
the Quad to White Plaza begins to
run, their ponchos flapping
behind them. One shocked
observer whispered to a friend, "If
God had meant man to fly, He
would have given him wings, not
water-proof plastic."
Life And Death
Fifty of us converge on the
bookstore steps at once and all
notice the "Place Leave All
Articles Outside" sign. Once a
mere annoyance, this request now
means the difference between
academic life and death.
We crowd into the bookstore, a
new speeding figure replacing each
previous one in the doorway. All
the check ladies look up,
confused. Two blacks selling
Socialist Worker newspapers
comment, "What the f—?"
The mass pushes up the stairs
toward the English bookshelf,
while others come down, books in
hand, shouting "I've got one!"
We reach an empty shelf.
But I go around back, see a
cart, and the last six copies. As I
reach in the cry goes up "There
they are—quick!" and I barely
escape.
The next scene Stakes place at
the checkstand. There are five
lines, each ten deep. As we get out
our check books to pay the $6.25
tab, a girl can be heard going up
each line offering to buy
anybody's copy for $10.
So who doesn't get the
books—who gets penalized? The
ones who refused to take part in
this madness. Maybe good
sportsmanship just doesn't count
anymore.
Well I won't stand for it. I'm
willing to take my book out of its
safe deposit box and give it up to
anyone . .. anyone who bids the
best price. Step right up, folks!

the checkstand. There are five
lines, each ten deep. As we get out
our check books to pay the $6.25
tab, a girl can be heard going up
each line offering to buy
anybody's copy for $10.
So who doesn't get the
books—who gets penalized? The
ones who refused to take part in
this madness. Maybe good
sportsmanship just doesn't count
anymore.
Well I won't stand for it. I'm
willing to take my book out of its
safe deposit box and give it up to
anyone . .. anyone who bids the
best price. Step right up, folks!

Some of you may have read
this Monday's lead article on
pre-med competition. Today I'd
like to report a true story proving
that pre-meds have not cornered
the red hot market.
My story concerns an English
class: (Yes, even the humanities
have been infected with the
get-ahead ethic.) "American
Humor," five units, interesting
material, and no prerequisites.
It sounded like the perfect
elective course to get away from
all the hustle and hassle. 120
others must have thought so as
well, for that number
approximates the total
enrollment.
Victory
I'll skip telling you how we had
to change rooms twice, or
couldn't get books for two weeks.
Suffice it to say that late in the
second week the instructor won a
victory with the bookstore and
started class by telling us the
news:
"The books have been in the
store basement for days," he
began, "but they had to very
carefully mark the price on each
one. They assure me the books
will be on the shelf this
afternoon ....

"But there are only 80 of the
books so you'll just have to share
or use three reserve shelf copies in
the library. A new shipment may
take weeks."
Interruption
The day's lecture began
without further announcement
but was interrupted ten minutes
later as a student slowly rose and
exited.
Ten more minutes passed and
three more classmates slipped out.
There were sighs from some in
class as the sound of the deserters'
bike chains rattled in.
Ten minutes left in class: the
instructor reaches for his own,
personal copy of the book to read
a selection from Mark Twain, and
five students get up in mid-row,
snake their way to the aisle, then
dart out without a backward
glance.
'Gimme That Joint'
Twain's first words are
drowned out by the comments of
students still in class—"What red
hots!" "Jesus Kele-riste!" "How
rude!" and "Gimme that joint!"
Teach reads on, some listeners
get their ponchos ready (it was
one of those primevil flood days),
and the clock's hands move
toward their inexorable destiny.
The reading is finished and the
concluding lecture comments are
begun. These statements,
normally picked up by a hundred
pens, fall on deaf ears and hands
too occupied to write.
From somewhere in the bowels
of the University Physical Plant, a
transistor switches on, activating
the campus bell system—it is 2:05.
Before the instructor can even
finish his last sentence, the entire
remainder of the class (70 or so)
leaves. But my story is not over
yet. Hardly: the fun has just
begun.
A great crowd of students
starts the exodus from Geology
corner (the only available room
big enough for the class in that
time slot) to the bookstore. As I
get on my bicycle my roommate
shouts, "We can share the book;
but don't take your time getting
up there."
Book Rush
Making my way toward lower
White Plaza I pass walking
students denouncing the whole

book-rush as stupid. Their
ten-speed-cyclist-classmates have
begun, by this time, a mini Tour
de France along the Quad.
I turn up White Plaza and see
one male begin running to catch
up with those already near the
fountain. Two females near me
shout. "Hey—he's running!" and
off they go.
In fact, each new group of
students turning the corner from
the Quad to White Plaza begins to
run, their ponchos flapping
behind them. One shocked
observer whispered to a friend, "If
God had meant man to fly, He
would have given him wings, not
water-proof plastic."
Life And Death
Fifty of us converge on the
bookstore steps at once and all
notice the "Place Leave All
Articles Outside" sign. Once a
mere annoyance, this request now
means the difference between
academic life and death.
We crowd into the bookstore, a
new speeding figure replacing each
previous one in the doorway. All
the check ladies look up,
confused. Two blacks selling
Socialist Worker newspapers
comment, "What the f—?"
The mass pushes up the stairs
toward the English bookshelf,
while others come down, books in
hand, shouting "I've got one!"
We reach an empty shelf.
But I go around back, see a
cart, and the last six copies. As I
reach in the cry goes up "There
they are—quick!" and I barely
escape.
The next scene Stakes place at
the checkstand. There are five
lines, each ten deep. As we get out
our check books to pay the $6.25
tab, a girl can be heard going up
each line offering to buy
anybody's copy for $10.
