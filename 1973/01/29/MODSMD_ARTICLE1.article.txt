# Peace Treaty Signed But War Goes On
## Bombs Still Falling In Indochina; VS. Draft To Cease Immediately 
### 
From the Associated Press
The war goes on in Indochina,
although the long-awaited cease fire
agreement has been signed.
Meanwhile, the Defense
Department announced Saturday that
the induction of draftees will cease at
once.
Families of men held prisoner in
North Vietnam or missing in action
learned authoritatively of their men's
status for the first time over the
weekend.
Foreign ministers of the United
States, North Vietnam, South
Vietnam, and the Viet Cong signed the
peace agreement Saturday morning in
Paris. The officials were expressionless
and silent as they signed the multiple
copies of the complex agreements.
Saturday
The cease-fire theoretically took
effect at 4 p.m. PST Saturday.
Under terms of the agreement, all
American troops will leave South
Vietnam within 60 days, and all
Americans held captive by North
Vietnam will be returned during the
same period.
The POWs are expected to begin
returning in about a week.
More than 120 U.S. war planes
bombed North Vietnamese supply
trails in Laos and military targets in
Cambodia after the Vietnam cease-fire
went into effect, it was learned
yesterday.
The American planes met relatively
light antiaircraft fire, and there were
no reported U.S. losses.
852s And Phantoms
One hundred F4 Phantom jet
fighter-bombers flew from three bases
in Thailand and 22 852 bombers
attacked out of Guam.
A top State Department official
confirmed the continued bombing of
Laos, but said nothing about
Cambodia.
William Sullivan, former

ambassador to Laos, said:
"In the interim period between
now and whenever there is a cease-fire
in Laos, we are continuing to provide
air support to the Royal Laotian
forces in resisting whatever
Communist movements there are
taking place."
Sullivan, a deputy assistant
secretary of State, gave no details on
the nature or scope of the air support.
The Pentagon noted Sullivan's
statement and said it would have
nothing to add at this time.
Troop Withdrawal
The United States sped withdrawal
of its remaining 23,000 troops as the
day-old cease-fire was shattered by
widespread fighting.
The Saigon command accused the
Communist side of 373 truce
violations between noon yesterday and
6 a.m. today.
U.S. officials said they anticipated
more hard fighting ahead.
As the fighting for political control
flared in scores of hamlets, members
of the International Commission of
Control and Supervision and
Vietnamese Communist delegates to
the peace agreement's Joint Military
Commission converged on Saigon to
set up machinery designed to
strengthen the fragile cease-fire.
Commission To Meet
The Vietnamese Communist
delegates were scheduled to join the
United States and South Vietnam
today for the initial meeting of the
four-party Joint Military Commission
which also has the task of determining
the methods of the American
withdrawal.
The 10 Viet Cong delegates refused
to get off their plane yesterday in
Saigon and were still on it this
morning because of a hassle involving
immigration forms. Diplomats were
trying to sort it out.
Two U.S. Air Force Cl3O transport

planes flew to Hanoi last night to pick
up about 150 North Vietnamese
military men who will serve with the
commission supervising the cease-fire.
Draft Ended
Secretary of Defense Melvin R.
Laird announced Saturday that "use
of the draft has ended."
His action, placing the nation's
armed forces on an all-volunteer
footing for the first time in nearly 25
years, came five months ahead of
President Nixon's goal.
Although the legal authority to
draft men will expire June 30, the
