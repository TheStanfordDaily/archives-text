# Peace Treaty Signed But War Goes On
## Bombs Still Falling In Indochina; VS. Draft To Cease Immediately 
### 
From the Associated Press
The war goes on in Indochina,
although the long-awaited cease fire
agreement has been signed.
Meanwhile, the Defense
Department announced Saturday that
the induction of draftees will cease at
once.
Families of men held prisoner in
North Vietnam or missing in action
learned authoritatively of their men's
status for the first time over the
weekend.
Foreign ministers of the United
States, North Vietnam, South
Vietnam, and the Viet Cong signed the
peace agreement Saturday morning in
Paris. The officials were expressionless
and silent as they signed the multiple
copies of the complex agreements.
Saturday
The cease-fire theoretically took
effect at 4 p.m. PST Saturday.
Under terms of the agreement, all
American troops will leave South
Vietnam within 60 days, and all
Americans held captive by North
Vietnam will be returned during the
same period.
The POWs are expected to begin
returning in about a week.
More than 120 U.S. war planes
bombed North Vietnamese supply
trails in Laos and military targets in
Cambodia after the Vietnam cease-fire
went into effect, it was learned
yesterday.
The American planes met relatively
light antiaircraft fire, and there were
no reported U.S. losses.
852s And Phantoms
One hundred F4 Phantom jet
fighter-bombers flew from three bases
in Thailand and 22 852 bombers
attacked out of Guam.
A top State Department official
confirmed the continued bombing of
Laos, but said nothing about
Cambodia.
William Sullivan, former

ambassador to Laos, said:
"In the interim period between
now and whenever there is a cease-fire
in Laos, we are continuing to provide
air support to the Royal Laotian
forces in resisting whatever
Communist movements there are
taking place."
Sullivan, a deputy assistant
secretary of State, gave no details on
the nature or scope of the air support.
The Pentagon noted Sullivan's
statement and said it would have
nothing to add at this time.
Troop Withdrawal
The United States sped withdrawal
of its remaining 23,000 troops as the
day-old cease-fire was shattered by
widespread fighting.
The Saigon command accused the
Communist side of 373 truce
violations between noon yesterday and
6 a.m. today.
U.S. officials said they anticipated
more hard fighting ahead.
As the fighting for political control
flared in scores of hamlets, members
of the International Commission of
Control and Supervision and
Vietnamese Communist delegates to
the peace agreement's Joint Military
Commission converged on Saigon to
set up machinery designed to
strengthen the fragile cease-fire.
Commission To Meet
The Vietnamese Communist
delegates were scheduled to join the
United States and South Vietnam
today for the initial meeting of the
four-party Joint Military Commission
which also has the task of determining
the methods of the American
withdrawal.
The 10 Viet Cong delegates refused
to get off their plane yesterday in
Saigon and were still on it this
morning because of a hassle involving
immigration forms. Diplomats were
trying to sort it out.
Two U.S. Air Force Cl3O transport

planes flew to Hanoi last night to pick
up about 150 North Vietnamese
military men who will serve with the
commission supervising the cease-fire.
Draft Ended
Secretary of Defense Melvin R.
Laird announced Saturday that "use
of the draft has ended."
His action, placing the nation's
armed forces on an all-volunteer
footing for the first time in nearly 25
years, came five months ahead of
President Nixon's goal.
Although the legal authority to
draft men will expire June 30, the

PEACE AGREEMENT â€” An aide places a copy of the Vietnam peace accord in front of U.S. Secretary of State William
P. Rogers during signing ceremonies in Paris Saturday. Across the table, with his back to the camera, North Vietnamese-
Foreign Minister Nguyen Duy Trinh signs another copy for his nation.
Selective Service law will remain on
the books so that the standby
machinery can be revived if necessary.
But to use that machinery, a President
would have to go back to Congress and
ask for restoration of the induction
authority.
Young men will still be required to
register for the draft at age 18.
Laird's decision cancels plans to
draft about 5000 men before next
June 30, when legal authority to
induct young men into the armed
forces will expire.
The Nixon administration has set a
policy that, in any future war
emergency, the roughly one-million
National Guardsmen and reservists will
be called before the country turns to
the draft for the necessary military
manpower.
555 POWs Named
The Defense Department said
yesterday that the Communists listed
555 living U.S. servicemen as prisoners
in North and South Vietnam and
another 55 who died in captivity. The
Pentagon said no clues to the fate of
more than 1300 Americans missing in
action wrre provided.
Pentagon spokesman Jerry W.
Friedheim said the lists included men
imprisoned in North and South
Vietnam but failed to identify any Gls
known captive in Laos.
He said the United States expects
to receive shortly another list covering
the 317 Americans who previously

were listed as either captured or
missing in Laos.
Few Of Missing
Officials said the POW list given
U.S. officials in Paris Saturday by the
North Vietnamese as part of the
cease-fire agreement contained the
names of only a few of those 1334
previously listed as missing in
Indochina.
This came as a bitter
disappointment to the Defense
Department and the families of the
missing, many of whom waited in
anguish for as long as eight years with
the slim hope that their men would
turn up as prisoners and some day
come home.
Friedheim said notification of
relatives of the 555 living, the 55 dead
and the 1315 still missing was
completed within 24 hours after the
POW list was received from Paris.
Moral Support
High South Vietnamese officials
said yesterday they expect no more
than moral support from the United
States if the North Vietnamese violate
the cease-fire.
If an attack comes, these sources
say, Saigon does not expect the United
States to provide the kind of military
aid necessary to repulse the enemy.
This feeling of a lack of support is
behind the quick visit made to the
United States this weekend by South
Vietnamese Foreign Minister Tran Van
Lam.
Lam flew back from the Paris peace

signing with Secretary of State William
P. Rogers in order to see President
Nixon.
The South Vietnamese delegate left
the Paris ceremony somberly, and one
Saigon official used terms like
"doublecross" to describe his version
of the U.S. negotiating role over the
last three months.
South Vietnamese officials
indicated, however, one factor that
might deter the Communists would be
an early public show of American
support for Saigon. They said Vice
President Spiro T. Agnew's current
trip to South Vietnam would help.
Last Killed
The U.S. Command disclosed that
the last American killed in Vietnam
before the start of the cease-fire was
Lt. Col. William B. Nolde, 43, a father
of five children, from Mount Pleasant,
Mich.
Nolde, the senior U.S. adviser in
Binh Long Province, was killed by
artillery fire Saturday night, 11 hours
before the official start of the
cease-fire. He was hit near the
provincial capital of An Loc, 60 miles
north of Saigon.
In all, four Americans were known
killed in the two days preceding the
start of the cease-fire and four others
were reported by the U.S. command as
missing after two U.S. planes were
shot down just below the demilitarized
zone Saturday afternoon.
