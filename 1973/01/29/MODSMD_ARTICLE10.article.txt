# 'liberate Oakland'
## People's Political Machine 
### 
zjoshua goldstein

Bobby Seale has summed up
the direction of the Black
Panther Party in the phrase
"organize and unify the people
around their basic needs and
desires." The most recent and
currently most important tool
being used to this end is the
campaign to build a "people's
political machine" throughout the
city of Oakland and take over
local institutions beginning with
the city government. Bobby is

running for mayor, and Elaine
Brown for city council; six
campaign offices and 1000
campaign workers are already in
operation, three months before
the election (April 17). Elaine will
speak at Cubberley auditorium
tonight (admission free) to
explain the campaign.
Many myths and
misconceptions have surrounded
the Black Panther Party,
particularly in the white
community and media. The Party
and the campaign are not just
"black" issues, although they
spring from the black community;
they have national and
international importance. The
Party is trying to create in
Oakland a revolutionary base of
operation — liberated territory
within the United States — 30
miles from Stanford. An
investigation of the Party's history
may illuminate this situation for
those of us who have been
isolated from the process.
The Party began in 1966 with
the ten-point program ("What We
Want, What We Believe"). The
program with minor modification
still appears in each week's Black
Panther newspaper. Point one
reads "We want freedom. We want
the power to determine the
destiny of our Black and
oppressed communities."Point ten
concludes "We want land, bread,
housing, education, clothing,
justice, peace and people's
community control of modern
technology."
The Party picked up a
tool to put these goals into action
— the tool of organized action

rather than spontaneous uprising,
and the philosophy of dialectical
materialism. Then they picked up
another tool, the gun, in order to
survive to use the first tool. Mao
used both tools, and succeeded.
But he also warned against
dogmatically transplanting ideas
without adapting them to new
conditions.
By 1971, thirty Panthers had
been killed by police and Huey
Newton had just spent three years
in prison. Eldridge Cleaver, in
Algiers, felt that the time had
come for "urban guerilla warfare"
in the U.S. The majority of the
Party, led by Huey and Bobby,
disagreed. Eldridge quit to form an
"underground army" which has
yet to take action.
Huey explains in his book, To
Die For The People:"Under the
influence of Eldridge Cleaver the
Party gave the community no
alternative for dealing with us
except by picking up the gun.
This move was reactionary simply
because the community was not
prepared to do that at that
point... We became, by that act,
a revolutionary cult group." The
Party criticized itself for having
"defected" from the community.
Survival Programs
So the Party put down the gun
and began to organize and unify
the people around Survival
Programs — the Free Breakfast
program (begun in 1966), People's
Free Medical Research Health
Clinics, Sickle Cell Anemia
Research Foundation, free shoe
factory, free plumbing and
maintenance, and so on. One of
the "survival conferences" held in
Oakland last year gave away
10,000 full bags of groceries in
three days, with a chicken in
every bag. The Party registered
29,000 people to vote in the Bay
Area last year. Intercommunal
Newsservice publishes the Black
Panther newspaper weekly, with a
circulation of 22,000 — "the
lifeline of the Party to the
community and vice versa."
All the programs are ongoing.
In Oakland, the six campaign
headquarters throughout the city
will remain open after the
election, so that people will have a
vehicle for implementing the
power which is inherent among
them. A number of groups have
sprung up in white communities,
working in conjunction with the
Panthers. Locally, the
Intercommunal Survival
Committee (968-3725) operates
two free child-care centers (in
Sunnyvale and San Mateo), a free
repairs program, medical care, free
food, and free busing to prisons
for families of prisoners.
The Stanford community must
stay informed of the situation in
Oakland, just as we would of
Vietnam or Washington. The
media will rant about Bobby and
Elaine, the "militant radicals."
But as Bobby points out, "when
your stomach's empty, you start
to get 'radical' about filling it."
The people want radical changes
to take place. All power to the
people.

the people around Survival
Programs — the Free Breakfast
program (begun in 1966), People's
Free Medical Research Health
Clinics, Sickle Cell Anemia
Research Foundation, free shoe
factory, free plumbing and
maintenance, and so on. One of
the "survival conferences" held in
Oakland last year gave away
10,000 full bags of groceries in
three days, with a chicken in
every bag. The Party registered
29,000 people to vote in the Bay
Area last year. Intercommunal
Newsservice publishes the Black
Panther newspaper weekly, with a
circulation of 22,000 — "the
lifeline of the Party to the
community and vice versa."
All the programs are ongoing.
In Oakland, the six campaign
headquarters throughout the city
will remain open after the
election, so that people will have a
vehicle for implementing the
power which is inherent among
them. A number of groups have
sprung up in white communities,
working in conjunction with the
Panthers. Locally, the
Intercommunal Survival
Committee (968-3725) operates
two free child-care centers (in
Sunnyvale and San Mateo), a free
repairs program, medical care, free
food, and free busing to prisons
for families of prisoners.
The Stanford community must
stay informed of the situation in
Oakland, just as we would of
Vietnam or Washington. The
media will rant about Bobby and
Elaine, the "militant radicals."
But as Bobby points out, "when
your stomach's empty, you start
to get 'radical' about filling it."
The people want radical changes
to take place. All power to the
people.

Bobby Seale has summed up
the direction of the Black
Panther Party in the phrase
"organize and unify the people
around their basic needs and
desires." The most recent and
currently most important tool
being used to this end is the
campaign to build a "people's
political machine" throughout the
city of Oakland and take over
local institutions beginning with
the city government. Bobby is

running for mayor, and Elaine
Brown for city council; six
campaign offices and 1000
campaign workers are already in
operation, three months before
the election (April 17). Elaine will
speak at Cubberley auditorium
tonight (admission free) to
explain the campaign.
Many myths and
misconceptions have surrounded
the Black Panther Party,
particularly in the white
community and media. The Party
and the campaign are not just
"black" issues, although they
spring from the black community;
they have national and
international importance. The
Party is trying to create in
Oakland a revolutionary base of
operation — liberated territory
within the United States — 30
miles from Stanford. An
investigation of the Party's history
may illuminate this situation for
those of us who have been
isolated from the process.
The Party began in 1966 with
the ten-point program ("What We
Want, What We Believe"). The
program with minor modification
still appears in each week's Black
Panther newspaper. Point one
reads "We want freedom. We want
the power to determine the
destiny of our Black and
oppressed communities."Point ten
concludes "We want land, bread,
housing, education, clothing,
justice, peace and people's
community control of modern
technology."
The Party picked up a
tool to put these goals into action
— the tool of organized action

rather than spontaneous uprising,
and the philosophy of dialectical
materialism. Then they picked up
another tool, the gun, in order to
survive to use the first tool. Mao
used both tools, and succeeded.
But he also warned against
dogmatically transplanting ideas
without adapting them to new
conditions.
By 1971, thirty Panthers had
been killed by police and Huey
Newton had just spent three years
in prison. Eldridge Cleaver, in
Algiers, felt that the time had
come for "urban guerilla warfare"
in the U.S. The majority of the
Party, led by Huey and Bobby,
disagreed. Eldridge quit to form an
"underground army" which has
yet to take action.
Huey explains in his book, To
Die For The People:"Under the
influence of Eldridge Cleaver the
Party gave the community no
alternative for dealing with us
except by picking up the gun.
This move was reactionary simply
because the community was not
prepared to do that at that
point... We became, by that act,
a revolutionary cult group." The
Party criticized itself for having
"defected" from the community.

isolated from the process.
The Party began in 1966 with
the ten-point program ("What We
Want, What We Believe"). The
program with minor modification
still appears in each week's Black
Panther newspaper. Point one
reads "We want freedom. We want
the power to determine the
destiny of our Black and
oppressed communities."Point ten
concludes "We want land, bread,
housing, education, clothing,
justice, peace and people's
community control of modern
technology."
The Party picked up a
tool to put these goals into action
— the tool of organized action

rather than spontaneous uprising,
and the philosophy of dialectical
materialism. Then they picked up
another tool, the gun, in order to
survive to use the first tool. Mao
used both tools, and succeeded.
But he also warned against
dogmatically transplanting ideas
without adapting them to new
conditions.
By 1971, thirty Panthers had
been killed by police and Huey
Newton had just spent three years
in prison. Eldridge Cleaver, in
Algiers, felt that the time had
come for "urban guerilla warfare"
in the U.S. The majority of the
Party, led by Huey and Bobby,
disagreed. Eldridge quit to form an
"underground army" which has
yet to take action.
Huey explains in his book, To
Die For The People:"Under the
influence of Eldridge Cleaver the
Party gave the community no
alternative for dealing with us
except by picking up the gun.
This move was reactionary simply
because the community was not
prepared to do that at that
point... We became, by that act,
a revolutionary cult group." The
Party criticized itself for having
"defected" from the community.
Survival Programs
So the Party put down the gun
and began to organize and unify
the people around Survival
Programs — the Free Breakfast
program (begun in 1966), People's
Free Medical Research Health
Clinics, Sickle Cell Anemia
Research Foundation, free shoe
factory, free plumbing and
maintenance, and so on. One of
the "survival conferences" held in
Oakland last year gave away
10,000 full bags of groceries in
three days, with a chicken in
every bag. The Party registered
29,000 people to vote in the Bay
Area last year. Intercommunal
Newsservice publishes the Black
Panther newspaper weekly, with a
circulation of 22,000 — "the
lifeline of the Party to the
community and vice versa."
All the programs are ongoing.
In Oakland, the six campaign
headquarters throughout the city
will remain open after the
election, so that people will have a
vehicle for implementing the
power which is inherent among
them. A number of groups have
sprung up in white communities,
working in conjunction with the
Panthers. Locally, the
Intercommunal Survival
Committee (968-3725) operates
two free child-care centers (in
Sunnyvale and San Mateo), a free
repairs program, medical care, free
food, and free busing to prisons
for families of prisoners.
The Stanford community must
stay informed of the situation in
Oakland, just as we would of
Vietnam or Washington. The
media will rant about Bobby and
Elaine, the "militant radicals."
But as Bobby points out, "when
your stomach's empty, you start
to get 'radical' about filling it."
The people want radical changes
to take place. All power to the
people.
