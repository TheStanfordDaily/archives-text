'Limited Mind'
Editor:
Dr. Shockley claims to be worried
about quality of intelligence in
Black people; we quite frankly are
concerned over quality of
intelligence in Dr. Shockley.
At the Tuesday (Jan. 23)
evening colloquium, Dr. Shockley
proved to be an adept public
speaker but surely a man of
limited mind. In the course of the
evening his obsessions, his "ticks"
came to the fore: his graphs, his
watch, the passing of minutes, the
"ground rules," the National
Academy of Sciences, the Nobel
Prize, above all, the publications
and activities of William Shockley.
It is curious that a man who has
studies genetics and eugenics over
the past six years should have
totally failed to grasp any of the
theoretical presuppositions
underlying his new "field" and
the moral and philosophical
problems raised by it.
Personally, we define
intelligence as mastery of the
synthetic as well as the analytic.
We assume it includes culture,
e.g., familiarity with the
philosophical and esthetic
contributions of man to the
universe, and we believe that
intelligence requires a dynamic,
vibrant, living personality that
applies the workings of the mind
with the passion and commitment
to one's everyday life and relates
them to the outside world.
Alas! Given Dr. Shockley's
refusal to deal with issues
unconnected with his graphs, his
obstination in quoting irrelevant
and trivial statements by himself
and by men he has met at
scholarly conferences, the
smooth, controlled, but lifeless
tone of his voice — he does not
measure up to our standards of
human intelligence.
This does not mean we request
Dr. Shockley to be sterilized, for
we do not presume to dictate our
values to society. There is a place
for finely analytic but limited
minds without culture and human
warmth, such as Dr. Shockley's.
However, since Dr. Shockley
probably places very well on I.Q.
tests, does not his very existence
question the validity of such
measurements for determining
true quality of intelligence?

'Financial Pinch' Over?
Editor:
I was fascinated to read that
the Trustees have determined that
there is such a surplus of funds
that they can afford the luxury of
a $400,000 expenditure for the
construction of entrance tunnels
on the west side of the stadium.
Tuition increases, unrepaired
streets, and a general shortage of
operating funds had led me to
believe that the University was
squirming in a financial pinch. I
am happy to see this indication
that the worst is over.
The Trustees have spent
$400,000, or about $30 per
student, on a project of no benefit
to the academic operations of the
University. I would recommend
that each student appropriate $30
out of his next tuition check to
himself.

'Foot-Dragging Charge Untrue
Editor:
Several comments are
mandated as a result of the Jan.
24 Sports editorial, "A Question
of Athletic Funds."
First, the quotes attributed to
me are accurate as are the two
paragraphs which contain and
amplify the quotations.
Second, that Mr. Ruetz "has

done little to fulfill this pledge"
of adapting to the needs of the
Women's Physical Education
program is totally inaccurate.
Your reporters would be
well-advised to devote time to
exploring the facts upon which
they intend to base an editorial.
As one of many who work in
concert with Mr. Ruetz, "as far as
we know" means that your
reporter learned of the $400,000
expenditure and talked with me
over the telephone for less than
five minutes. His interview
consisted of these basic questions:
1) What would you do if someone
gave you $400,000? 2)Wouldn't
$400,000 get your program on its
feet? 3) How many intercollegiate
teams to you have? 4) What could
the teams do if they had the
money?
A positive contribution the
Daily could make with respect to
athletics on this campus would be
to follow up on the excellent
series written by Terri Mac Donald
last year.

Someone Cares
Editor:
Sir Hargadon has spoken
(Daily, Jan. 24), placing your
concern about his accessibility in
its proper place on a mile-long list
of priorities.
I was one of those 13,000
applicants to Stanford has year. I
had never been west of the
Rockies, let alone visited the
campus. But exotic rumors of a
sunny (?) west-coast paradise held
me captivated. When I mentioned
it to my college counselor, she
had but one thing to say: "It's a
shot in the dark ..." So I
naturally flipped out when I got
in . . . but I was also accepted at
some other major eastern
universities. Alas! Would I opt for
that eastern seaboard seal of
approval or strike out for the
Promised Land?
On the bottom of my Stanford
acceptance letter, written in
shocking pink magic marker, were
the words: "Terrific! Wow!
Great!" in that I would later come
to recognize as the famous
Hargadon Scrawl. Another of
Hargadon's letters, sent to
incoming freshmen, spoke of a
slight case of overacceptance
which might force him to convert
his home into a dormitory and be
exiled to a tent. He went on to
say that he was sure we'd all heard
the "collective sigh of relief" from
admissions committees all over
the country as April 15 arrived,
and that if his staff had to work
one more week of 16 hour days,
they would've hanged him "in
effigy."
Notes from other departments
confirmed my impression of
Stanford as an easy-going place,
relatively unconcerned with
prestige and intellectual bullshit.
Stanford seemed to be a more
honest and less alienating place
tha most other schools I had
visited. Before my arrival, this was
one of the few real contacts I had
with Stanford, and thus, to a large
extent, formed a basis for my
decision.
Mr. Hargadon and I continued
to write back and forth during the
summer. But I can't say that I've
really seen him since I've been
here — except for one brief visit
which I watched, awestruck, as he
whirled about his office at the
speed of light, answering phones
and rushing to appointments. God
only knows how he does it — but
he is still able to convey the
feeling that someone cares to
those 13,000 applicants who wait
paralyzed for five months in the
most mangled positions
imaginable — toes, fingers, arms
and legs crossed . . .
