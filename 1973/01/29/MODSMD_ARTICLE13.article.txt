# FBI Annual Report Mentions Venceremos
## 
### 
Two Bay Area-based political
groups, Venceremos and the
Revolutionary Union, were given
special mention in the Federal
Bureau of Investigation's 1972
"Annual Report."
"Venceremos, the FBI report
states, "proclaims itself to be a
multinational organization ready
to engage in any and all means of
struggle."
Several Venceremos members
or former members recently were
charged in connection with the
October escape of Chino Prison

inmate Ronald Wayne
Beaty—himself then a Venceremos
member.
One prison guard trainee was
shot to death during the escape.
Beaty, who turned state's
evidence after his recapture in
December, recently was
denounced by the organization as
"an enemy of the people."
The FBI report says that
"every member is required to
learn to operate and service
weapons; to have arms available;
and to teach the 'oppressed'
methods of armed and organized
self-defense."
The report also alleges that the
group's leadership—presumably
the Central Committee—"is in the
process of establishing a liason
with the CPC (Communist Party
of China)."
The bureau's report which does
not provide any documentation
for its commentaries on the two
groups, says that the

Revolutionary Union, which is
not active in the Midpeninsula,
now operates in a "semicovert"
manner in 10 states.
"RU members," the report
states, "have been accumulating
weapons while engaging in
firearms and guerilla warfare
training."
The report also contains brief
descriptions of such groups as
Weatherman, Students for a
Democratic Society, the Black
Panther Party, the Ku Klux Klan,
the Communist Party, and the
Venceremos Brigade.
"The FBl's responsibilities in
the internal security field are
derived from legislative
enactments, executive orders, and
instructions from the Attorney
General," the report says.
"Specific statutory jurisdiction
in this area includes matters
relating to espionage,
counterespionage, sabotage,
treason, subversion, and sedition."
