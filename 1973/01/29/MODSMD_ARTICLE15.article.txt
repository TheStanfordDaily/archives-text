# Carnegie Plant Biology Director Named
## 
### 
Dr. Philip H. Abelson,
President of the Carnegie
Institution of Washington, has
announced the appointment of
Dr. Winslow R. Briggs as Director
of the Institution's Department of
Plant Biology here. Effective July
1, Briggs will replace Dr. C. Stacy
French, who will retire after
serving as Director since 1947.
Briggs, a resident of Lexington,
Mass., is now Professor of Biology
at Harvard University, and
previously was Professor of
Biology here. He is a leading
experimental botanist and a
pioneer in modern developmental
plant biology. Among his sixty
published works are important
studies of plant development,
growth hormone physiology,
plant tropisms, and plant pigment
function. He has made several
recent contributions to the study
of the biophysical and
biochemical properties and
physiological role of the plant
pigment phytochrome.
Briggs believes that a major
determinant of the quality of
future civilization will be the
wisdom and efficiency with which
man deals with renewable
resources and the natural
environment. Ecology has become
a pressing issue, but effective
action is hindered by our limited
knowledge of plant functions.
The situation is aggravated by
the fact that federal levels of
support are too low to meet the
practical challenges facing plant
biology. A modest acceleration of
basic research efforts could have
exciting and important
applications in temperate and
tropical agriculture, management
of fields and forests, and
development of disease-resistant
strains. Success to date of the
"green revolution" indicates what
might be accomplished.

Briggs expects to commit the
Department of Plant Biology to
an expanded program of research
and training in the plant sciences.
The staff will be increased, and
facilities renovated to
accommodate the most modern
research equipment. A group
headed by Briggs will be formed
to investigate the biochemical
aspects of plant development and
physiology. The Department will
intensify its study of the basic
mechanisms of photosynthesis,
the primary source of all food and
oxygen. This process is of central
importance to life, and yet is just
beginning to be understood.
Briggs is confident that the
combined efforts of a larger staff
with complementary research
interests will do much to unravel
its complexities. An
understanding of the
photosynthetic process will be
applicable to many areas of
biology, particularly membrane
function and bioenergetics. A
strong group in . physiological
ecology will also be maintained.
Briggs feels that the field is in
many ways still in its infancy, and
much important pioneering work
is needed.
The new director also sees
increased interaction with
Stanford's Department of Plant
Biology and greater emphasis on
graduate training: "The program
of postdoctoral fellowships should

be continued, but a program of
predoctoral fellowships instituted
and a role in predoctoral training
acquired. Predoctoral training
should never become the prime
focus, but the unrealized potential
for closer collaboration with a
strong plant development group at
Stanford requires some
collaborative graduate student
training. Such collaboration
would produce an unusually
strong complex of experimental
botanists, perhaps unmatched
elsewhere. Some progress is being
made in this area, but more would
be extremely fruitful."
The Carnegie Institution of
Washington is concerned with
advanced education and research
in the biological and physical
sciences. Its five departments
include: the Geophysical

Laboratory and the Department
of Terrestrial Magnetism, both
located in Washington, D.C.; the
Department of Plant Biology at
Stanford, California; the
Department of Embryology at
Baltimore, Maryland; and the Hale
Observatories at Pasadena,
California, which are jointly
operated with the California
Institute of Technology.
