# State Approval Received
## 'Daily' Incorporation Ratified 
### 
The independence of the Daily was
finalized last week when the Secretary
of State's office in Sacramento
approved the incorporation papers of
The Stanford Daily Publishing
Corporation.
Last fall, students voted to transfer
all assets of the paper from the ASSU
to the non-profit corporation,
provided it was incorporated by Feb.
1.
Daily executives received word of
the approval late last week from
counsel Gerald Marer. He said the
certificate of incorporation and other
certified documents are in the mail
and should be received shortly.
Although Daily independence has
been discussed for over a decade, the
impetus did not come until October,
1970.
Bodily Injury
On Oct. 2, 1970, the paper
published a column by a jailed radical
which advocated bodily injury to two
named individuals who had testified
against the writer. The publication of

the column created considerable
controversy and led to a strong
statement by President Richard
Lyman urging total independence for
the paper as soon as possible.
In January, 1971, a SWOPSI course
was organized to study the question of
independence. Approximately 15
Daily staffers, along with
Communication Prof. David Grey,
studied all facets of independence for
two quarters and compiled a 150-page
report on the subject.
Following publication of the
report, action was immediately taken
to implement its recommendations
and 1972 was a year of intense
negotiations between the Daily and
University administrators.
Constitutionality
A debate over the constitutionality
of the October ASSU election
including the Daily proposal delayed
work on the incorporation, but all
qualifications were finally met by the
first week of winter quarter.
The editor-in-chief and business

manager of the Daily are the ex-officio
president and vice president of the
corporation. They head a nine-member
Board of Directors.
The Board of Directors is composed
of President Donald Tollefson,
