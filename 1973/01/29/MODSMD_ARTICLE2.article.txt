# State Approval Received
## 'Daily' Incorporation Ratified 
### 
The independence of the Daily was
finalized last week when the Secretary
of State's office in Sacramento
approved the incorporation papers of
The Stanford Daily Publishing
Corporation.
Last fall, students voted to transfer
all assets of the paper from the ASSU
to the non-profit corporation,
provided it was incorporated by Feb.
1.
Daily executives received word of
the approval late last week from
counsel Gerald Marer. He said the
certificate of incorporation and other
certified documents are in the mail
and should be received shortly.
Although Daily independence has
been discussed for over a decade, the
impetus did not come until October,
1970.
Bodily Injury
On Oct. 2, 1970, the paper
published a column by a jailed radical
which advocated bodily injury to two
named individuals who had testified
against the writer. The publication of

the column created considerable
controversy and led to a strong
statement by President Richard
Lyman urging total independence for
the paper as soon as possible.
In January, 1971, a SWOPSI course
was organized to study the question of
independence. Approximately 15
Daily staffers, along with
Communication Prof. David Grey,
studied all facets of independence for
two quarters and compiled a 150-page
report on the subject.
Following publication of the
report, action was immediately taken
to implement its recommendations
and 1972 was a year of intense
negotiations between the Daily and
University administrators.
Constitutionality
A debate over the constitutionality
of the October ASSU election
including the Daily proposal delayed
work on the incorporation, but all
qualifications were finally met by the
first week of winter quarter.
The editor-in-chief and business

manager of the Daily are the ex-officio
president and vice president of the
corporation. They head a nine-member
Board of Directors.

managing editor; Diane Fields, a law
student here and former member of
the ASSU Council of Presidents;
Templeton Peck, editorial writer for
the San Francisco Chronicle; William
Rivers, professor of communication
here; and Pat Newport, who works in
the personnel department of Crown
Zellerbach Corporation.
Changes
However, there will be a number of
changes in the board before it holds its
first meeting Feb. 12. Hoffman,
currently managing editor, will
become editor-in-chief and president
on Feb. 1, succeeding Tollefson. A
lawyer will be named to replace
Wascher, who is an interim director.
The Daily and the University have
negotiated a rent-free lease by which
the Daily will retain its present offices
in the Storke Student Publications
Building. The paper will pay taxes,
utilities, maintenance and insurance on
its offices. The initial lease is for a
period of three years, but is renewable.
The University has also agreed to
continue to pay $17,500 during the
current academic year and the next
two academic years to print an
additional 4000 copies daily for
faculty and staff members.
Student Fees
The Daily currently receives $2 a
year from students, but next year
plans to ask for only $1 per student.
Following next year, the Daily does
not plan to ask for any further student
body fees and when the subsidy from
the University is discontinued in the
'75-'76 academic year, the Daily will
be existing almost entirely on
advertising revenue. Many independent
student newspapers operate on a
purely subscription basis, with sizeable
rates. The Harvard Crimson sells for 15
cents a copy.

Tollefson said that finalization of
independence "marks a historic day
for this newspaper and this
community. We are extremely happy
at becoming an independent student
newspaper and we are committed to a
continued high level of journalism and
community service.
"Independence will mean more
work and responsibility for both our
editorial and business staffs, but this is
a small price to pay for total freedom
from the threat of control by the
University, the ASSU or any other
special interest group. We are very
happy."

against the writer. The publication of

the column created considerable
controversy and led to a strong
statement by President Richard
Lyman urging total independence for
the paper as soon as possible.
In January, 1971, a SWOPSI course
was organized to study the question of
independence. Approximately 15
Daily staffers, along with
Communication Prof. David Grey,
studied all facets of independence for
two quarters and compiled a 150-page
report on the subject.
Following publication of the
report, action was immediately taken
to implement its recommendations
and 1972 was a year of intense
negotiations between the Daily and
University administrators.
Constitutionality
A debate over the constitutionality
of the October ASSU election
including the Daily proposal delayed
work on the incorporation, but all
qualifications were finally met by the
first week of winter quarter.
The editor-in-chief and business

manager of the Daily are the ex-officio
president and vice president of the
corporation. They head a nine-member
Board of Directors.

Templeton Peck, editorial writer for
the San Francisco Chronicle; William

here; and Pat Newport, who works in
the personnel department of Crown
Zellerbach Corporation.
Changes
However, there will be a number of
changes in the board before it holds its
first meeting Feb. 12. Hoffman,
currently managing editor, will
become editor-in-chief and president
on Feb. 1, succeeding Tollefson. A
lawyer will be named to replace
Wascher, who is an interim director.
The Daily and the University have
negotiated a rent-free lease by which
the Daily will retain its present offices
in the Storke Student Publications
Building. The paper will pay taxes,
utilities, maintenance and insurance on
its offices. The initial lease is for a
period of three years, but is renewable.
The University has also agreed to
continue to pay $17,500 during the
current academic year and the next
two academic years to print an
additional 4000 copies daily for
faculty and staff members.
Student Fees
The Daily currently receives $2 a
year from students, but next year
plans to ask for only $1 per student.
Following next year, the Daily does
not plan to ask for any further student
body fees and when the subsidy from
the University is discontinued in the
'75-'76 academic year, the Daily will
be existing almost entirely on
advertising revenue. Many independent
student newspapers operate on a
purely subscription basis, with sizeable
rates. The Harvard Crimson sells for 15
cents a copy.

Tollefson said that finalization of
independence "marks a historic day
for this newspaper and this
community. We are extremely happy
at becoming an independent student
newspaper and we are committed to a
continued high level of journalism and
community service.
"Independence will mean more
work and responsibility for both our
editorial and business staffs, but this is
a small price to pay for total freedom
from the threat of control by the
University, the ASSU or any other
special interest group. We are very
happy."
The independence of the Daily was
finalized last week when the Secretary
of State's office in Sacramento
approved the incorporation papers of
The Stanford Daily Publishing
Corporation.
Last fall, students voted to transfer
all assets of the paper from the ASSU
to the non-profit corporation,
provided it was incorporated by Feb.
1.
Daily executives received word of
the approval late last week from
counsel Gerald Marer. He said the
certificate of incorporation and other
certified documents are in the mail
and should be received shortly.
Although Daily independence has
been discussed for over a decade, the
impetus did not come until October,
1970.
Bodily Injury
On Oct. 2, 1970, the paper
published a column by a jailed radical
which advocated bodily injury to two
named individuals who had testified
against the writer. The publication of

the column created considerable
controversy and led to a strong
statement by President Richard
Lyman urging total independence for
the paper as soon as possible.
