# Last American Dies In Vietnam
## 
### 
SAIGON (AP)—The last American
killed before the Vietnam
cease-fire was the father of five
children, an Army officer who
had lived through the siege of An
Loc and was passionately
dedicated to rebuilding the
devastated city.
Ironically, Lt. Col. William
Nolde of Mount Pleasant, Mich.,
was killed in An Loc by a direct
artillery round which hit just as he
finished conferring with his
Vietnamese counterpart on how
to get the economy rolling again.
The official end of the war was
only hours away.
"Bill was a very compassionate
person," said Robert Walkinshaw,
the pacification chief for the 3rd
Military Region and a close
personal friend. "He drove ail over
Binh Long Province in his jeep
encouraging the people to go back
and put the pieces of their city
together again."
Senior Advisor
Nolde, 43, was assigned to An
Loc, the capital of Binh Long

Province, in early May as senior
advisor, just as the city was
midway in its 4'/2-month siege by
Communist command troops and
heavy guns.
Once a lovely city surrounded
by rubber plantations, An Loc
after its relief was little more than
a moonscape of rubble and dust.
"But Bill loved that place,"
Walkinshaw continued. "He was
always getting together with the
Catholic priest on how to rebuild
the church, and hardly a week
v.vnt by that he didn't run over to
refugee camp at Phu Van in the
neighboring province to see how
the people were making out
whom the war had driven from
their homes."
Rebuild An Loc
Nolde's obsession with the
dream that An Loc would rise
again had given him a street
corner fluency in Vietnamese.
"More than enough to carry on a
conversation on getting things
going again," said another
American friend.

At the height of siege, when
7,000 rockets, mortars and
artillery shells a day were falling
on An Loc, Nolde made his
headquarters in neighboring Binh
Duong Province.
The enemy wanted the town
60 miles north of Saigon as the
showpiece of their spring invasion
and perhaps as a provisional
capital for the Viet Cong
government. More than 10,000
North Vietnamese troops were
killed trying to take the city.
Friends say it was then that
Nolde made up his mind to help
rebuild what the helicopter pilots
who circled the town described as
a red dust bowl made up of clay
and blood.
Last Fatality
George Jacobson, the chief of
staff for pacification in Vietnam
and Nolde's top boss, said, "While
I realize someone has got to be
the last one killed in the official
part of the war, I regret
exceedingly it had to be Bill. He
was a first class officer and a first

class person. The Vietnamese
people loved him." "He was a fine
gentleman," said a South
Vietnamese officer who knew him
well.
Nolde was killed about 10 p.m.
on the last day of the war. While
the rest of the country was
witnessing a marked upsurge in
fighting, the town on Highway 13
was relatively quiet.
"That night, the town wasn't
taking that much fire," said
Walkinshaw. "Bill was just leaving
the ranger compound, after saying
good night to the province chief,
when the round came in."

after its relief was little more than
a moonscape of rubble and dust.
"But Bill loved that place,"
Walkinshaw continued. "He was
always getting together with the
Catholic priest on how to rebuild
the church, and hardly a week
v.vnt by that he didn't run over to
refugee camp at Phu Van in the
neighboring province to see how
the people were making out
whom the war had driven from
their homes."
Rebuild An Loc
Nolde's obsession with the
dream that An Loc would rise
again had given him a street
corner fluency in Vietnamese.
"More than enough to carry on a
conversation on getting things
going again," said another
American friend.

At the height of siege, when
7,000 rockets, mortars and
artillery shells a day were falling
on An Loc, Nolde made his
headquarters in neighboring Binh
Duong Province.
The enemy wanted the town
60 miles north of Saigon as the
showpiece of their spring invasion
and perhaps as a provisional
capital for the Viet Cong
government. More than 10,000
North Vietnamese troops were
killed trying to take the city.
Friends say it was then that
Nolde made up his mind to help
rebuild what the helicopter pilots
who circled the town described as
a red dust bowl made up of clay
and blood.
Last Fatality
George Jacobson, the chief of
staff for pacification in Vietnam
and Nolde's top boss, said, "While
I realize someone has got to be
the last one killed in the official
part of the war, I regret
exceedingly it had to be Bill. He
was a first class officer and a first

class person. The Vietnamese
people loved him." "He was a fine
gentleman," said a South
Vietnamese officer who knew him
well.
Nolde was killed about 10 p.m.
on the last day of the war. While
the rest of the country was
witnessing a marked upsurge in
fighting, the town on Highway 13
was relatively quiet.
"That night, the town wasn't
taking that much fire," said
Walkinshaw. "Bill was just leaving
the ranger compound, after saying
good night to the province chief,
when the round came in."
SAIGON (AP)—The last American
killed before the Vietnam
cease-fire was the father of five
children, an Army officer who
had lived through the siege of An
Loc and was passionately
dedicated to rebuilding the
devastated city.
Ironically, Lt. Col. William
Nolde of Mount Pleasant, Mich.,
was killed in An Loc by a direct
artillery round which hit just as he
finished conferring with his
Vietnamese counterpart on how
to get the economy rolling again.
The official end of the war was
only hours away.
"Bill was a very compassionate
person," said Robert Walkinshaw,
the pacification chief for the 3rd
Military Region and a close
personal friend. "He drove ail over
Binh Long Province in his jeep
encouraging the people to go back
and put the pieces of their city
together again."
Senior Advisor
Nolde, 43, was assigned to An
Loc, the capital of Binh Long

Province, in early May as senior
advisor, just as the city was
midway in its 4'/2-month siege by
Communist command troops and
heavy guns.
Once a lovely city surrounded
by rubber plantations, An Loc
after its relief was little more than
a moonscape of rubble and dust.
