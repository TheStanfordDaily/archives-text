# Dan Millman Goes To Oberlin
## Searching For A New Approach To Sports The 						Stanford Daily SPORTS 
### MIKE CHASSON 
It has been almost a year since
the Stanford gymnastics team
came within 0.075 points of being
the Pacific-Eight's representative
in the NCAA Championships.
Each of the point winners from
last year's team has returned.
This, coupled with the addition of
several excellent freshmen,
establishes the Cardinals as one of
the favorites for the Pac-Eight
title.
However, one important
member of last year's team won't
be around. Dan Millman, last
year's head coach, quietly moved
on to Oberlin College in Ohio late
last spring.
In four years of haru work,
Millman converted what was
probably the worst team in the
Pac-Eight into a national
gymnastics power.
Millman came here in 1968 as
what he terms "a pretty fanatical
gymnastics-trampoline
competitor" with "a strange
mixture of liberal-radical-conser
vative perspective on life."
Three Tenets
His coaching philosophy then
was based on three tenets — to be
as fair and rational as possible; to
trust and leave final responsibility
to the individual in matters
affecting his or her life, and to be
as harmonious and constructive in
nature as he could.
Millman had been used to
success during his collegiate years
at UC Berkeley and was a fanatic
about building a top program
here.
During his first year, in 1969,
S inford had what Millman
considered a very low caliber
program. The equipment was old,
the workout room was very poor,
and the team had none of the
traditional support he had been
used to at Berkeley.
The following year Millman
recruited heavily — "crazy" in his
terms — and moved into the Old
Pavilion with much better
equipment. At this point the team
had two excellent all-around
gymnasts and he pushed them
hard.
Second Thoughts
It was at this time that Millman
started having second thoughts
about his methods and philosophy
of coaching. It was also at this
time that he first talked to Jack
Scott, now athletic director at
Oberlin.
Scott, considered by many to
be the number one spokesman for
those who are demanding a basic
re-examination of sport, started

Millman thinking in new
directions on his role as a coach.
"I had to sit back and take
stock of my coaching methods,
my personality, and what 1 could
offer young men," stated
Millman.
"We weren't winning — we
were losing, losing, losing. The
team wasn't getting the traditional
rewards. So I began to search for a
new definition of success, based
upon the meaning involved, the
process orientation rather than
goal orientation."
'Transcending Competition'
"I had to find this new picture
of success for my gymnasts, and
for me. So I developed a sense of
humor and concept of what
gymnasts could be, independent
of competition — transcending
it."

Stanford lost all of its dual
meets in 1971, but Millman's new
philosophy and a number of
excellent recruits improved the
team to such an extent that it lost
only to California last year. With
Cal ineligible for the NCAA
championships, Stanford had a
shot at representing the Pac-Eight,
but lost in a close battle to
Washington at the Conference
Championships.
Millman's new philosophy,
while not making him one of the
most popular coaches in the
conference nor even in the
Stanford Athletic Department,
impressed enough outstanding
high school seniors to convince
them to come here, giving the
Cardinals one of the best
gymnastics teams in the country.
The story of Millman's
departure from Stanford began
last March when then-Acting
Athletic Director Robert Young
called Millman into his office to
inform him that, because of
Budget Adjustment Program cuts,
the Department would have to
replace some instructors in P.E.
classes. Graduate students were to
teach in order to save money, and
Millman was one of the
instructors to lose his P.E. job.
Interested In Oberlin
When Millman heard the news

he was forced to look for a new
job because he could not afford to
live on his coaching salary alone.
At this time he talked once again
to Scott, who had been recently
appointed as head of the
Department of Athletics at
Oberlin. Scott indicated that an
opening might exist in the
department.
The situation became
complicated, however, when a
generous donor offered a large
amount of money to supplement
Millman's salary, allowing him to
stay for at least three more years.
With this development,
Millman had pretty much decided
to stay, but as he puts it, "many
questions remained." He now
enjoyed teaching his P.E. classes
as much as working with the
team. He also began to "catch

glimpses of some new directions
in physical education which might
be possible at Oberlin and simply
weren't at Stanford."
When an opening did occur at
Oberlin, Millman visited the
campus and found the atmosphere
to his liking. Millman, in
summarizing his visit states, "I
found much stronger attention
given to the arts. The situation in
physical education was as exciting
as I ever had imagined."
Many Factors
Millman weighed many factors
in making his critical decision. He
saw advantages and disadvantages
at both schools.
He saw that the team was going
to finally see the result of his
work, and it would be easy to
predict "that Stanford would be
one of the nation's top gymnastics
teams for the next few years, now
that it had built up a tradition and
reputation.
"Yet with all Stanford had to
offer it represented sameness,
stagnation in an educational sense
for me," states Millman. "I was
seeking something more in
physical education.
"There have been times that
I've asked myself why I left... if
it was the right thing . . . and the
answer is, that in some ways it
was the best, and in other ways
not. All I can do is to make the
best commitment I can, and
continue along my present path."
Under Jack Scott
At Oberlin Millman works
under Scott, who was hired there
last spring to put his "unorthodox
theories" of athletics to work as
Chairman of the Physical
Education Department and
Athletic Director.
Scott has written two books
expounding his theories on
athletics. The first was Athletics
for Athletes, which he published
at his cwn expense during the
winter of 1968-69. In it Scott
charged that collegiate sports and
the coaching fraternity are guilty
of misdemeanors ranging from
racism to authoritarianism. Scott's
most recent book, The Athletic
Revolution (1971) went still
further with descriptions of drug
abuse, payoffs and coaches whose
only concern is winning.
Another Scott enterprise was
Dave Meggesey's Out of Their
League, which tore into football's
brutality and regimentation. Scott
helped Meggesy with the writing
while the former St. Louis
Cardinal linebacker was in
residence at Scott's Institute for
the Study of Sport in Oakland.
Now that he has taken over at
Oberlin, Scott gets his first real
chance to see if he can work
within the system. The school has
a young and aggressive new

president, 35-year-old Robert
Fuller, who decided a year and a
half ago that the physical
education department was ripe for
an overhaul.
Investigation Of PE Department
Fuller and the Dean of the
College of Arts and Sciences, Dr.
Donald Reich, conducted an
investigation of the P.E.
department. "At Oberlin we've
felt that the physical education
department should offer a
diversified and valuable
experience," explained Reich in a
recent Sports Illustrated article.
"We questioned a great many
people about this and concluded
that the program was not reaching
the students."
Both Fuller and Reich agreed
the man they wanted was Jack
Scott. If they were delighted by

the arrival of Scott, the P.E.
faculty was not. A poll of the 14
member department, taken just
before Scott's arrival showed only
one member totally favorable.
Last summer the non-believers
began leaving, partly out of
administrative urging, partly out
of fear of Scott. Five different
coaches or faculty left or made
plans to leave by the end of this
school year.

Given this sudden bonus of
open positions to fill, Scott began
to surround himself with
individuals that probably would
make most members of the
athletic establishment shudder.
Most of the appointees have little
or no teaching background, but all
have been involved in some aspect
of athletics.
Scott's success is hard to
measure at this point. However,
the P.E. classes are bursting with
new enrollees. Despite the fact
there is no P.E. requirement many
classes have doubled in size.
Compromise
Millman is excited about what
Scott is trying to do at Oberlin,
but admits that Scott is having
problems since he is so new to the
job. "Jack is finding that
compromise is necessary to
achieve his goals for the athletic
department," states Millman.
No matter what success
Millman achieves at Oberlin he
was successful here. The question
now is whether or not the
Cardinals will continue to be the
gymnastics power Millman built
them into and retain what
Millman tried to instill in them.
"I'm hoping the individuals on
the team will not forget what it's
like to do gymnastics for yourself
— to enjoy training and not
over-do the stress on judging
yourself only in relation to whom
you can beat," states Millman. "I
hope they keep the same humility
in victory as they did a few years
ago.
"Many coaches around the
Pac-Eight will not say 'Stanford is
doing great now that Millman is
gone with his weird ideas.' But
