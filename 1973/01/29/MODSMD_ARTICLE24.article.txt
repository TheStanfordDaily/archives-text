The Stanford gymnastics team
worked its way to an easy
153.25-143.35 victory over Chico
State Friday before a crowd of
about 1,000 at Maples Pavilion.
Freshman Ted Marcy proved
he is still master of the side horse
with the meet's highest individual
score, a 9.55 for the second week
in a row.
George Negrete had an
impressive 9.0 in the rings event.

Howard Bessen was right behind
him with an 8.95. Steve Hug,
competing in only one event
instead of the usual all-around,
unleashed a new high bar routine
that was good for a 9.1.
Although Hector Neff is still
out with a muscle tear, Bob
Anderson showed he was well on
his way to recovering from his
shoulder injury in winning the
all-around with a 50.85, more
than three points ahead of his

nearest competitor. His score
included an 8.95 in floor exercise
and an 8.85 on the high bar.
Coach > Hamada was
disappointed in the crowd for
booing some of the low scores
given to Chico State performers.
The lower scores were a result of
less difficult routines, and taking
extra swings between moves, both
of which deduct heavily from the
score, even if the routine is
aesthetically excellent.
Although the Cards won by a
comfortable margin, the final
score was still about four points
below last week's total.
"I wasn't after a high team
score," explained Hamada, "or I
would have used Steve (Hug) in
the all-around." I wanted to give
some of the less experienced
performers a chance to compete.
"At the UCLA meet next week
and the Southern California
Gymastics Federation Invitational
the week after that, we'll be going
for score."
