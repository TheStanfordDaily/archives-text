# Patterson, Kelley Combine For 43
## Stanford Holds Off Gauchos 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
SANTA BARBARA 4000 frenzied
fans at Robertson Gymnasium
loved the basketball action
between Stanford and UC Santa
Barbara for 35 minutes Friday
night, but the Stanford
combination of 7-0 sophomore
Rich Kelley and 6-11 freshman
Tim Patterson dulled their spirits
in the final five minutes as the
Cards pulled away for an 80-68
victory.
The capacity crowd cheered
wildly when the Gauchos were
introduced at the start of the
game, and the roars became
deafening when Santa Barbara
pulled within one point at 63-62
with 4:37 remaining. At that
point, however, Kelley and
Patterson led a spirited Stanford
surge that quieted the crowd and
ruined Santa Barbara's upset
hopes.
Stanford outscored the
Gauchos 9-1 in the next 2:10
and the issue was decided. The
victory improved Stanford's
record to 8-7 while UCSB fell to
8-6.
Patterson Impressive
The Cards' tall and talented
duo of Kelley and Patterson
combined for 43 points, 22 for
Patterson and 21 for Kelley.
Patterson was particularly
impressive as he hit all 10 of his
field goal attempts in a brilliant
shooting exhibition. Scoring

mainly on layups and 10-15 foot
jump shots, Patterson recorded his
career high scoring total, erasing
his previous high of 16 last week
against Utah. Judging from his
constant improvement and cool,
confident play, Patterson's new
career high probably won't last
very long either.
Kelley's performance wasn't
nearly as flawless as his 30 point,
12 rebound, no turnover effort
against Utah last Saturday, but he
scored when it mattered most
against the Gauchos. Kelley, who
was angered by some questionable
officiating and finally a technical
foul, harnessed his rage into an
aggressive performance in the final
five minutes, scoring eight points
and controlling the boards as the
Cards pulled away.
Gilberg Hot
Before Kelley and Patterson
began to score inside, it was the
outside shooting of 6-0 guard
Mark Gilberg that kept Stanford
in front. Gilberg hit five of his six
field goal tries in the first half as
Stanford took a 40-32 halftime
lead. He added one more field
goal and two free throws in the
second half to finish with 14
points.
"Mark played very well, not
only shooting but also with his
floor play and direction," said
Stanford coach Howie Dallmar.
"Mark's outside shooting really
adds to our offense," Kelley
added, obviously relieved to have
some of the scoring burden off his
shoulders.
Stanford shot a torrid 57.6
percent from the field but
surprisingly were outrebounded
40-33 by the smaller Gauchos.
"We were a little lethargic on
the boards," Dallmar said. "We
should have been more aggressive.
Big Men Harassed
6-7 Santa Barbara center Pat
Boyer took rebounding honors for

the game with 13 while Kelley
had 11 and Patterson seven for
Stanford. 6-4 forward John
Radford led the Gauchos in
scoring with 17 points and also
harassed Stanford's big men
underneath before fouling out
with 5:42 remaining.
With Radford in the game
Santa Barbara was able to
neutralize Stanford's tremendous
height advantage at times with
some physical play under the
basket. But in the end Stanford's
height was just too much for the
Gauchos.
"It's very difficult to contain

two players like Kelley and
Patterson when you're giving up
seven or eight inches," said Santa
Barbara coach Ralph Barkey.
'This was really the first time this
year that our height disadvantage
was decisive."
Stanford now has 10 games
remaining this season, all Pacific
Eight contests. The Cards will
travel to Berkeley Saturday
afternoon for a regionally
televised game against California.
Stanford and Cal are both 1-3 in
Pac-8 play. UCLA and USC lead
the conference with perfect 4-0
records.
