# Cards Win In Examiner Meet
## 
### PHIL HUBBARD 
Stanford's indoor track season
got underway Friday night as
Stanford runners, ex-runners, and
even the track coach got into the
act.
The Cards' mile relay team of
Matt Hogsett, Dave Bagshaw,
Kenny Kring, and John Anderson
destroyed the field in winning the
university division mile relay with
a 3:24.0 clocking. Berkeley was a
distant third at 3:28.9.
The highlight of the evening
was a thrilling duel between 1968
Olympic gold medalist Kip Keino
and ex Stanford star Duncan
Mac Donald (running for the
Outrigger Canoe Club) in the mile.
Mac Donald led by a good margin
going into the last lap, but was
caught by Keino's sprint finish in
the final few yards. Keino won by
a nose as both were timed in
4:03.8.
Stanford senior Brian
Mittelstaedt was fourth in that
race with an outstanding 4:08.2.
His best outdoor clocking is
4:05.3.
Other performers for the Cards
who had to compete with
world-class athletes in their events
were Tom Anderson in the long
jump, Dave Bagshaw in the
hurdles, Mark McConnell in the
2-mile, and Ken Curl in the 60.
Stanford Track Coach Pavton
Jordan showed he was still in fine
sprinting form as he handily won
the senior's (55-up) 60 yard dash.
Three Stanford Running Club
members competed in the senior's
mile: Norman Lloyd (2nd), Dave
Stevenson, and Gene Havnes.
