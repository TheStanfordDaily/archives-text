# Frosh Cagers Win A Pair
## 
### MARK WHITE 
Faced with their first road trip
of the season, the Stanford
Freshman basketball team
integrated a steady defense with a
productive offense in winning two
games, an 87-62 win over
Sacramento State Friday night,
and a 72-54 victory over UC Davis
Saturday.
It was a weekend for
Stanford's big men, as their
dominance of the boards
paved the way for the two wins.
Against Sacramento State
steady Fd Schweitzer had his
usual good game, scoring 27
points and nabbing a season high
17 rebounds. But it was Dale
Peters who cinched the game for
the Cards as he turned in his best
performance of the season,
coming off the bench to grab 11
rebounds and contribute 14
points.
Stanford started tough against
Sacramento State, using a solid
defense and good medium range
shooting to take a 12 point lead
after 10 minutes of play.
But the Cards turned cold and

Sacramento cut the margin to
four points .at the 5:00 mark.
Peters then came off the bench to
pull down several key rebounds
and lead Stanford to a 36-29
halftime lead.
Assistant Coach Bob Nicholson
explained that, "Peters dominated
the second half." Stanford
utilized a fast break to stretch
their lead to 17 points within five
minutes of the second period.
Once again the Cards experienced
a mid stanza slump, but when
coach Jones emptied the bench in
the waning minutes of the game,
the Cards blew State out of the
gym, scoring a season high 51
second half points to win 87-62.
Against UC Davis a similar
pattern evolved. Schweitzer had
another excellent game, scoring
24 and rebounding 11, but it was
the complimentary performance
of another Stanford big man, six
foot-six Kevin Enright that gave
the game to the Cards. Enright
turned in his best performance of
the season, scoring 20 points,
hitting on 10 of 13 shots in relief
duty off the bench.
Stanford opened the game

slowly against Davis, but solid
defense kept them in the game
until a productive running game
propelled the Cards to a 12 point
lead midway in the half.
Rich Wohlstadter added to the
Cardinal impetus in the first half
with his 11 points and as Stanford
shut off Davis' attack, Stanford
rolled to a 37-26 halftime lead.
The Cards slowly built a 20
point lead in the first ten minutes
of the second half. Davis fought
back to cut the deficit to 15, but
when coach Jones cleared the
bench again, the reserves built up
the lead and Stanford coasted to
their second consecutive
convincing victory', 72-54.
It was an important pair of
wins for the Cards as it brought
their season record to five wins
and four losses. Coach Jones
commented. "This weekend really
gave us a mental lift. We've been
playing good defense, but we
haven't been scoring enough. I
think we played very well this
weekend; we (it together mentally
and I think we can play against
anybody now. I'm very pleased
with the team."
