Nixon Asks Big Budget Cuts
KEY BISCAYNE, Fla. — Declaring it is "time to get big
government off your back and out of your pocket,"
President Nixon told the nation yesterday he is sending
Congress a peacetime budget holding the line on taxes and
slashing several popular federal programs.
A day after the formal end of American fighting in
Vietnam — the nation's longest war — the President said in
a nationwide radio address that his $269-billion budget
"will give us the chance ... to make our new era of peace
a new era of progress."
Nixon's budget goes to Congress at noon today, but he
set the stage for his battle of the budget with Congress by
unveiling some of its key provisions in the radio address
taped before he flew to Florida on Friday.
Nixon's slashes in programs popular with Congress,
coupled with his vow to keep current fiscal year spending
to $250 billion by withholding congressionally approved
funds, already has touched off major controversy on
Capitol Hill.
The President appeared to extend an olive branch to
unhappy congressmen, while at the same time seeking
public support for the White House position, when he
said:
"Every member of the Congress gets enormous
pressure from special interests to spend your money for

what they want. And so I ask you to back up those
congressmen and those senators, whether Democrats or
Republicans, who have the courage to vote against higher
spending. They hear from the special interests, let them
hear from you."
Corona Defense Wants New Trial
FAIRFIELD, Calif. — Juan Corona's attorney — caught
off guard by a guilty verdict based on circumstantial
evidence — is maneuvering for a new trial that might
include the first testimony from Corona.
Defense attorney Richard Hawk's motion for a new
trial in the nation's biggest mass murder court case is
scheduled for hearing today at the same Fairfield court
where the four-month trial ended Jan. 18 with 25 guilty
verdicts.
During the first trial, Hawk repeatedly attacked what
he called "the errors, omissions and mistakes" of the
prosecution. He surprised observers by resting his case
without calling a single defense witness.
