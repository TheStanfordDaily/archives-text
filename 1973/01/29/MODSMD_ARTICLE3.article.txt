# 'Papers' Injury Reports Admitted
## 
### ED KOHN 
The defense in the "Pentagon
Papers" trial in Los Angeles may have
won an important victory Friday when
it forced a government admission that
at least two documents leaked to the
press in 1971 did not affect the
national defense two years earlier.
After repeated orders by presiding
Judge Matthew Byme Jr., the
government Wednesday turned over
one of several "damage reports"
prepared by the Department of
Defense at the request of the
Department of Justice following the
publication of segments of the
"Papers" in newspapers around the
country in June, 1971.
An unnamed government expert
wrote in that report that disclosure of
the "Gurtov Report," an analysis of
the 1954 Geneva Convention, could
not have harmed the national defense.
"It is not possible to identify
material in this study which would
relate to the national defense in
1969," the analyst wrote. "Virtually
all of the information has been in the

public domain prior to 1969 .. . (the
release) does not have any effect
whatsoever on the national defense."
The expert also wrote that one of
the 18 volumes of. the "Pentagon
Papers" that defendants Dr. Daniel
Ellsberg, 41, and Anthony J. Russo
Jr., 36, allegedly duplicated and later
distributed to the news media did not
affect national security in 1969. The
volume deals with the evolution of the
Vietnam War from 1954 through
1956.
"The Department of Defense does
not find that the compromise of this
document in 1969 in any way affects
national defense," the report states.
Face 15 Counts
Ellsberg and Russo face a total of
15 counts of espionage, conspiracy
and theft of government property for
allegedly duplicating and distributing
segments of the "Papers," a
47-volume, 7000-page analysis of
United States involvement in Vietnam
between 1940 and 1968; eight pages
of the "Wheeler Report," an analysis
of U.S. and North Vietnamese
capabilities written by the then
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
during the 1968 Tet offensive; and the
"Gurtov Report." All the reports were
classified "Top Secret" at the time of
their publication.
In order to prove its charges against
Ellsberg and Russo, the government
must prove that the documents related
to the national defense between March
1, 1968 and Sept. 30, 1969 and that
the material was not available
anywhere else prior to its publication
in the New York Times and
Washington Post in June, 1971.
Late Friday afternoon, Byrne

refused to turn over the "damage
report" to the defense pending receipt
of all other similar reports.
Earlier, he told defense and
prosecution attorneys that the defense
is entitled to receive the opinions in
the government's possession of all
"expert witnesses." Such reports could
provide "exculpatory evidence" —
material that could be used by the
defendants to prove their innocence.
Officials Summoned
In a move that seems designed to
ensure that he receives all the "damage
reports" promptly, Byrne Friday
halted all testimony and ordered the
appearances of J. Fred Buzhardt, and

Defense Department's general counsel,
and John Martin, a high-ranking
official in the Justice Department's
Internal Security Division.
They have been ordered to appear
in court this afternoon to explain the
delay in turning over the documents
and to produce any other "damage
reports" that were not flown out to
Los Angeles by special Air Force jet
Friday afternoon for Byrne's
inspection.
Byrne Wednesday afternoon
defined "damage report" as "any
study, analysis, survey, or report
prepared by the Department of
Defense, regarding these documents
(the "Pentagon Papers") ... as to
whether their release could, would, did
or possibly could, would or did cause
injury to the United States or damage
to a foreign country."
The prosecution is under
long-standing orders to turn over any
such studies, regardless of their value
to the government, to Byrne for an in
camera examination.
Prosecutor David Nissen repeatedly
told Byrne that he did not know of
any such studies, but his first witness,
Frank A. Bartimo, a Defense
Department lawyer, told the court on
cross-examination that he had
organized a four-to-six man "task
force" to prepare just such an analysis.
Study Took Several Months
Bartimo testified that the study was
ordered five days after the government
went to court to try to stop the Times
and the Post from publishing any more
material from the "Papers" on the
grounds of "national security."
Bartimo said that the report took
several months — perhaps as long as
half a year — to prepare. By then, the
government had lost its case against
the newspapers by a 6-3 margin in the

Supreme Court.
Byrne has ordered Bartimo to
produce that study several times — and
he even sent Bartimo back to his
Pentagon office 10 days ago to obtain
a copy — but Bartimo has been unable
or unwilling to tum it over to Byrne
for examination.
Brig. Gen. Paul F. Gorman, the
government's third witness and the
highest-ranking military officer
assigned to the preparation of the
"Papers," Friday completed his third
and final day of direct examination. In
his testimony, he discussed in some
detail the four "diplomatic volumes"
of the "Papers."
Gorman, a Harvard-education
infantry and airborne commander who
served for two years as a military aide
at the Paris Peace Talks, said that the
release of the "Papers" could have
interfered with negotiations with the
North Vietnamese because they had
insisted that any negotiations outside
of the regular, public peace talks be
carried out in strict secrecy.
Byrne ordered the 10-woman,
two-man jury to report to court at
9:30 Tuesday morning when
cross-examination of Gorman — which
may last all week — is expected to
begin.
