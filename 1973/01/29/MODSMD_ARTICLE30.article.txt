# University Seeks Postponement; Council Reviews Annexation
## 
### ROBERT BACON 
Stanford officials have asked the
Palo Alto City Council to postpone
consideration of annexation of the
Frenchman's Terrace housing site
"until the questions of availability of
funds and taxation are resolved." A
related matter will probably also be
deferred.
The much-postponed annexation
proposal is on the agenda for tonight's
Council meeting.
In a letter to Mayor Kirke
Comstock, made public Friday,

Robert R. Augsburger, University Vice
President for Business and Finance,
pointed out that the moratorium on
federal funding announced Jan. 8 and
Gov. Ronald Reagan's veto of
legislation offering property tax relief
to government-assisted housing "may
result in delaying the development of
the project as proposed."
Frenchman's Terrace has been
proposed by Stanford as a 225-unit,
federally-subsidized
low/moderate-income housing project,
to be built on University-owned land

at the corner of Peter Coutts and Page
Mill Roads.
Since the federal housing fund
freeze was announced, the
Stanford-Midpeninsula Urban
Coalition, project sponsors along with
the University, have been exploring
possible alternative means of funding.
Realignment
Also on the Council's agenda
tonight is a related matter, the
realignment of the Stanford
Avenue-Bowdoin Street intersection.
After two University committees
rejected a proposed realignment which
would have required the University to
offer one acre of greenbelt land at the
intersection for annexation to the city,
Palo Alto traffic planners designed a
modified plan requiring only .35 acre
of Stanford land, only .1 acre of which
is greenbelt.
Last Monday, the University
Committee on Land and Building
Development asked the city to provide
it with additional information on the
proposal, and took no action, pending
receipt of the data.

A third Stanford-related item facing
the Council is Councilwoman Enid
Pearson's request for information on

be constructed at Stanford Hospital.
