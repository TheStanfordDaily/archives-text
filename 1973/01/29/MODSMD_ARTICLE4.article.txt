Today's scheduled election to fill
11 vacant graduate seats in the ASSU
Senate has been cancelled because not
enough people filed petitions to run,
according to ASSU Elections
Commissioner Mike Nilsson.
Only four grad students, two from
the School of Education, one from
Engineering and Earth Sciences, and
one from Humanities and Sciences,
filed petitions to run for the Senate.
Nilsson said the unopposed candidates
were automatically elected.
The four new members of the
Senate are Timothy B. Moyer,
representing H&S, George M. Goodwin
and J. Michael Korff from the School
of Education, and Melvyn L.
Rappeport representing the School of
Engineering and Earth Sciences.
This leaves seven graduate seats
vacant, five from the School of
Engineering and Earth Sciences and
both of the Medical School seats.
The poor response "seems to be
due to a repetitive manifest lack of
interest. It will probably go on until
next year, when the Senate gets a
better reputation," commented
Nilsson.
"There was a lack of respect for the
student government in the past," he
continued. "Last year's government
didn't do much to encourage
participation. I'm not saying that's
good or bad â€” they just didn't
encourage people to take part in

government. Students feel that student
government is less than respectable.
This year's student government seems
to be much better."
Nilsson said that the apparent lack
of interest in student government is
common, pointing out that last year
there were vacancies in the Senate.
Senate President Rocky Barber was
disappointed by the small number of
petitions, but he feels that the Senate
will be effective even with seven seats
vacant.
"I'm obviously disappointed, but I
understand (why students aren't
interested in running for the Senate),"
he said. "The Medical and Engineering
schools have always been detached
(from the Senate). I think that in the
last few years they've been turned off
by the radical image of the Senate.
We'll just have to work to form a
liason. This year we're sort of working
off the ground level to show people
how much the Senate can get done.
"I don't think another election will
help. The year's half over and people
think they can't get much done,"
Barber continued.
Nilsson added that the number of
elections held is limited by financial
considerations, as people must be paid
to staff voting tables and tally votes.
"The four new members will help,"
concluded Barber. "They will provide
better representation and more
chances for a quorum."
