# Lab Studies Narcotics Addiction
## 
### VALERIE LEZIN 
Heroin, methadone and morphine are the objects
of an intensive investigation by researchers and lab
technicians at the new Narcotics Addiction
Research Laboratory here.
Twelve people are involved in the actual lab,
researching the basic biological and pharmacological
aspects of narcotics addiction. Another 16 are
employed in data collection and analysis work.
Pharmacology Prof. Avram Goldstein heads the
research group.
Experiments with mice have already been
conducted within the framework of the laboratory
to determine the length of time in which one can
become addicted or kick a drug habit. Morphine,
which is assumed to work on the same principles as
heroin, was used in the tests. Signs of tolerance
development were indicated by the lessening of the
analgesic effects of the narcotic.
Varying levels of methadone, which prevents
heroin withdrawal pains, are now being tested. To
determine possible high and low methadone dosage
levels in humans, the Mountain View addiction
clinic administers blind dosages to its patients.
Neither the nurse administering the drug nor the
patient is aware of how much methadone the
patient is receiving. This is to prevent unfavorable
reactions of a psychosomatic nature. If the patient
returns the next day feeling ill or experiencing
withdrawal symptoms, the dosage is too small and is
accordingly increased.

A new, long-lasting methadone has also been
developed, and tests identical to those conducted on
regular methadone have been made on this new
formula with very favorable results.
It has been discovered that the new formula need
not be administered daily, but, unlike regular
methadone, the new formula can be administered
only by a doctor. Such treatment is more
convenient for the patient and helps to prevent the
illegal sale of extra take-home methadone to
"non-prescription" users.
Termed as a "major breakthrough" in the
research, sputum (saliva) tests were found to be
successful by the research lab in conjunction with
the Mountain View clinic in detecting methadone
content within the human body. Urinalyses had
proven to be less than an easy method of obtaining
the same information, with patients either refusing
to or unable to participate in the tests.
With sputum tests, the patients need only chew a
piece of parafilm and submit it to the lab for
analysis.
At the present time, sputum tests are being
designed for the purpose of detecting heroin
content in the body.
Binding Substance
Some progress has been made in the study of a
narcotic binding substance found in the brain cells
of mice and in guinea pig intestines. A paper will
soon be published detailing the results of the study.

Although actual experimentation involves only
animal subjects, some tests on the plasma level in
non-heroin addicts as opposed to the plasma level
found in addicts are being conducted.
Treatment will not be administered to patients at
the research lab. However, facilities will exist at the
lab to observe the patients overnight.
Such experimentation and observation will be
the basis for sound treatment. Goldstein said, "As
we learn more about addiction, we will be able to
formulate better treatment programs."
Pilot Project
Pharmacology Research Associate Robert
Campos is organizing a pilot project to withdraw
methadone users from that drug. This would be the
equivalent of a second phase of drug withdrawal;
kicking the heroin habit would be the first.
Four teams of "family facilitators" will approach
the problem of addiction from a psychological
standpoint. Acting as counselors, the teams will try
to relieve the psychological need which causes users
to return to the drug.
The lab facilities will be unique upon their
completion, scheduled for sometime early next
year. Nowhere else in the country are basic
scientists and researchers working with clinical
scientists in one operation. Ray Dingledine, a
pharmacology graduate student here, commented,
"It will be a learning experience for everyone. It'll
be a real stimulating place."
