## Independence 
### 
"The student press is always freer when it is independent. Only
when it is utterly independent can it be utterly free." Professor of
Religion William Clebseh made this statement in the fall of 1970 and
today his words have special meaning.
After more than a decade of discussion and more than two years of
intense work, the Daily has finally achieved independence. The
incorporation last week of The Stanford Daily Publishing Corporation
marks the beginning of a long awaited new era for the Daily.
Independence will not cause major changes in the everyday
appearance of the paper. But it has important meaning for all of our
staff members and all of our readers. Most importantly, there will no
longer be the threat of potential censorship by the University or the
ASSU.
To find an example of such censorship, one has to go far back in
the Daily's history. But as long as the Daily was dependent on these
two organizations for a large portion of its income, that threat
continued.
In recent months, student newspapers at a large number of
universities and colleges have had censorship problems. At San Jose
State, the student government has accused the Spartan Daily of
irresponsibility and is threatening to withhold funds from the paper
next year. At the University of Florida, The Daily Alligator has had a
running battle with the school's president ever since it published an
abortion referral list.
There are many more examples of student newspapers which have
recently faced censorship or outside control, and we feel it is
extremely important to be free of this threat. A strong newspaper
which is able to vigorously investigate, condemn or praise anyone or
anything is a necessity for this campus.
University and student subsidies are no longer a major part of our
revenue and when they are phased out completely in three years,
students, faculty and staff will still continue to get the Daily free.
Many independent student papers charge for subscriptions, but we are
committed to providing a free newspaper.
Independence will mean that we will have to be responsible to our
readers. Since we will soon be subsisting almost entirely on
advertising, we will have to be responsible to readers who must
patronize our advertisers to insure the Daily's financial stability. But
the large number of advertisers we have eliminates the possibility of
influence by any one of them.
We realize that independence will mean more work for us. Our
business staff members will have to work harder to assure that our
advertising revenues remain high. Our editorial staff members will
have to work harder to make sure that we are consistently producing a
high quality professional product and serving the community. We
welcome these added responsibilities which come with total freedom.
The road to independence has been a long and hard one. We
especially want to thank those non-Daily people who have made
independence possible. ASSU President Scott Burke has strongly
supported our independence. We have received a large amount of
invaluable help from members of the Department of Communication.
And University administrators, especially President Richard Lyman,
have understood the value of independence and have been extremely
cooperative in helping us to achieve it.
On many campuses, administrators and student governments have
forced papers to go independent rapidly and prematurely, without
proper preparation. That has not occurred here as almost everyone
involved has shown the highest degree of cooperation. We have
approached independence carefully and are fully prepared for the
challenges awaiting us.
