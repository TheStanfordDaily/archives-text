# 'a tortuous path'
## What Is Patriotism? 
### 
Daniel brenner

As Eric Severeid noted in his
analysis of the President's
announcement last week, no hats
will fly to celebrate the end of the
tragic, traumatic period of
Vietnam. The relief felt last
Saturday afternoon as the clock
struck four will soon dissipate,
and we will have to address
ourselves to national moral
reconstruction.
At this period, it seems
appropriate to discuss
"patriotism" in the aftermath of
Vietnam. The meaning of that
word has traveled a tortuous path
through the national psyche.
As the war anchored itself to
national policy, the concept of
"national service" and obligation
to the common weal became
convoluted. Defenders of
"patriotism," which became
synonomous with "My country,
right or wrong," were the
Daughters of the American
Revolution, the American legion,
VIVA, and Young Americans for
Freedom.
Allegiance
The war became more complex
and so, too, did the meaning of
allegiance. Bright men, angry men
began to call the American war a
grave mistake, a diurnal
repudiation of all that made this
country different from and better
than its European models. For the
war resisters, Montreal and
Stockholm had become Concord
and Lexington.
The flag provided a symbol for
the competing meanings of
patriotism. Those who supported
the war, the old patriotism,
plastered translucent surfaces with
Old Glory decals, as if to say, "We
still believe." The peace
movement turned the flag upside
down: "Distress," it read.
Then everyone began to co-opt
the tricolor, fashioning crotch
patches, work shirt emblems, and
T-shirt designs. The flag's meaning
was further obscured as the
balance tipped to antiwarism. The
people of America no longer
believed in Gen. Westmoreland's
predictions. Like the gambler who
will not sign for another 500,000
chips, the forward motion of war
was shifted to Vietnamization.
National Feast
Patriotism shifted too. A
national feast occurred as
politicians and leaders ate their
words of a few years back. VIVA

— Victory In Vietnam — no longer
advocated a military solution for
the war. The American Legion
began to listen to voices which
disagreed with continuing the war.
George McGovern articulated
what he believed patriotism
meant: "Come Home, America"
became the theme of his campaign
of conscience. And now with
American presence in Indochina
ending, "patriotism," like
"America," is a much
misunderstood notion.
Repudiation
Clearly, "patriotism" can no
longer mean blind allegiance to
national policy. The foreign
policy principles of the architects
of this war were repudiated in
Nixon's second inaugural.
Flag-wavi.ig "Americanism" has

degenerated into the philosophy
of racism and intolerance for
those of a differing lifestyle.
What it does mean is uncertain.
The war has added a strong dose
of dissent and debate as essential
ingredients of American
democracy. The writings of
Emerson and Thoreau will now
line up with "The Federalist
Papers" and "Common Sense" as
keepsakes of the nation.
But these are superficial
attempts at rethinking
"patriotism." Now at war's end,
as a society we need to
dispassionately address ourselves
to what America should mean.

synonomous with "My country,
right or wrong," were the
Daughters of the American
Revolution, the American legion,
VIVA, and Young Americans for
Freedom.
Allegiance
The war became more complex
and so, too, did the meaning of
allegiance. Bright men, angry men
began to call the American war a
grave mistake, a diurnal
repudiation of all that made this
country different from and better
than its European models. For the
war resisters, Montreal and
Stockholm had become Concord
and Lexington.
The flag provided a symbol for
the competing meanings of
patriotism. Those who supported
the war, the old patriotism,
plastered translucent surfaces with
Old Glory decals, as if to say, "We
still believe." The peace
movement turned the flag upside
down: "Distress," it read.
Then everyone began to co-opt
the tricolor, fashioning crotch
patches, work shirt emblems, and
T-shirt designs. The flag's meaning
was further obscured as the
balance tipped to antiwarism. The
people of America no longer
believed in Gen. Westmoreland's
predictions. Like the gambler who
will not sign for another 500,000
chips, the forward motion of war
was shifted to Vietnamization.
National Feast
Patriotism shifted too. A
national feast occurred as
politicians and leaders ate their
words of a few years back. VIVA

— Victory In Vietnam — no longer
advocated a military solution for
the war. The American Legion
began to listen to voices which
disagreed with continuing the war.
George McGovern articulated
what he believed patriotism
meant: "Come Home, America"
became the theme of his campaign
of conscience. And now with
American presence in Indochina
ending, "patriotism," like
"America," is a much
misunderstood notion.
Repudiation
Clearly, "patriotism" can no
longer mean blind allegiance to
national policy. The foreign
policy principles of the architects
of this war were repudiated in
Nixon's second inaugural.
Flag-wavi.ig "Americanism" has

degenerated into the philosophy
of racism and intolerance for
those of a differing lifestyle.
What it does mean is uncertain.
The war has added a strong dose
of dissent and debate as essential
ingredients of American
democracy. The writings of
Emerson and Thoreau will now
line up with "The Federalist
Papers" and "Common Sense" as
keepsakes of the nation.
But these are superficial
attempts at rethinking
"patriotism." Now at war's end,
as a society we need to
dispassionately address ourselves
to what America should mean.

As Eric Severeid noted in his
analysis of the President's
announcement last week, no hats
will fly to celebrate the end of the
tragic, traumatic period of
Vietnam. The relief felt last
Saturday afternoon as the clock
struck four will soon dissipate,
and we will have to address
ourselves to national moral
reconstruction.
At this period, it seems
appropriate to discuss
"patriotism" in the aftermath of
Vietnam. The meaning of that
word has traveled a tortuous path
through the national psyche.
As the war anchored itself to
national policy, the concept of
"national service" and obligation
to the common weal became
convoluted. Defenders of
"patriotism," which became
synonomous with "My country,
right or wrong," were the
Daughters of the American
Revolution, the American legion,
VIVA, and Young Americans for
Freedom.
