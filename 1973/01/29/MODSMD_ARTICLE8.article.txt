## Profit At Human Expense 
### 
David cole

I once believed Chris Hocker was just another
Ronald McDonald (Daily Jan. 23), concocted by the
Daily in the continuing vein of high school humor
that brings us Tim White personal ads and
photographs of "the Don." But now I'm sure he is a
real person, since even a Daily clown couldn't
defend the decades-old concept that employment at
any wage is better than no employment at all.
McDonald's surely applauds this view with
corporate glee, since the financial benefit is entirely
theirs and not the workers.
McDonald's is not in business to be
humanitarian, libertarian, or even to provide the
world's best hamburger. They wanna make money.
To this end, the worker is simply a commodity like
the fatty meat and watered-down soft drinks.
Faced with rising raw material prices, and
wanting to hold product cost constant so
Jack-In-The-Box doesn't get their business,
McDonald's must compensate by lowering workers'
wages. Continuing our hypothetical example, when
the worker isn't efficient, complains about his low
wage, or fails to pass one of McDonald'sliedetector
tests, he is shucked off like last night's french fries.
Logical Extension
Well shucks, sez Hocker, I'm not shucking at all.
Sixteen workers at $1 an hour is more jobs than 10
workers at $1.60 an hour, and $1 an hour is
certainly enough to supply the "necessities" of life.
By logical extension. Mocker's solution to the next
increase in raw material prices is to lower workers'
wages again. After all, which is better — 16 workers
at $1 an hour, or 32 workers at 50 cents an hour?
Hooray for capitalism - unemployment is down.
Some day minimum wage laws will disappear.

Such laws are the result of social reformers who
work within the capitalist framework and regard
things like minimum sufficient wages as the goal of
social revolution. This Utopian concept of socialism
began with Owenites during the last century and
currently gives national popularity to people like
Ted Kennedy.
Profit At Human Expense
McDonalds doesn't affront our delicate
sensibilities because it sells hamburgers and french
fries, but because it is a "rallying-point for the
cheap, the plastic, the tawdry... in short, the
bourgeois ideal." This ideal promotes profit at the
expense of humanity, and no amount of naive
snickering by Chris Hocker about the benefits of
employment with below-subsistence living
conditions will ever change that fact.
But don't take my word for it. Ask those
McDonald's employees about their low wages, the
lie detector tests, and the mechanical
regimentation of packaging a maximum amount of
Rig Macs every hour. Ask them how it feels to be
unskilled, with nothing to offer but human labor.
Ask the poor, the minorities, the old and the
handicapped whether they really believe in the
American dream that any person can become
president of McDonald's.
Some day, minimum wage laws will be totally
unnecessary because McDonald's — and America —
will belong to all the workers.(David Cole is a
graduate student in drama.

American dream that any person can become
president of McDonald's.
Some day, minimum wage laws will be totally
unnecessary because McDonald's — and America —
will belong to all the workers.(David Cole is a

I once believed Chris Hocker was just another
Ronald McDonald (Daily Jan. 23), concocted by the
Daily in the continuing vein of high school humor
that brings us Tim White personal ads and
photographs of "the Don." But now I'm sure he is a
real person, since even a Daily clown couldn't
defend the decades-old concept that employment at
any wage is better than no employment at all.
McDonald's surely applauds this view with
corporate glee, since the financial benefit is entirely
theirs and not the workers.
McDonald's is not in business to be
humanitarian, libertarian, or even to provide the
world's best hamburger. They wanna make money.
To this end, the worker is simply a commodity like
the fatty meat and watered-down soft drinks.
Faced with rising raw material prices, and
wanting to hold product cost constant so
Jack-In-The-Box doesn't get their business,
McDonald's must compensate by lowering workers'
wages. Continuing our hypothetical example, when
the worker isn't efficient, complains about his low
wage, or fails to pass one of McDonald'sliedetector
tests, he is shucked off like last night's french fries.
Logical Extension
Well shucks, sez Hocker, I'm not shucking at all.
Sixteen workers at $1 an hour is more jobs than 10
workers at $1.60 an hour, and $1 an hour is
certainly enough to supply the "necessities" of life.
By logical extension. Mocker's solution to the next
increase in raw material prices is to lower workers'
wages again. After all, which is better — 16 workers
at $1 an hour, or 32 workers at 50 cents an hour?
Hooray for capitalism - unemployment is down.
Some day minimum wage laws will disappear.

Such laws are the result of social reformers who
work within the capitalist framework and regard
things like minimum sufficient wages as the goal of
social revolution. This Utopian concept of socialism
began with Owenites during the last century and
currently gives national popularity to people like
Ted Kennedy.
Profit At Human Expense
McDonalds doesn't affront our delicate
sensibilities because it sells hamburgers and french
fries, but because it is a "rallying-point for the
cheap, the plastic, the tawdry... in short, the
bourgeois ideal." This ideal promotes profit at the
expense of humanity, and no amount of naive
snickering by Chris Hocker about the benefits of
employment with below-subsistence living
conditions will ever change that fact.
But don't take my word for it. Ask those
McDonald's employees about their low wages, the
lie detector tests, and the mechanical
regimentation of packaging a maximum amount of
Rig Macs every hour. Ask them how it feels to be
unskilled, with nothing to offer but human labor.
Ask the poor, the minorities, the old and the
handicapped whether they really believe in the
American dream that any person can become
president of McDonald's.
Some day, minimum wage laws will be totally
unnecessary because McDonald's — and America —
will belong to all the workers.(David Cole is a
