# Government Testimony Divulges Pentagon Papers Impact Studies
## 
### ED KOHN 
Special To The Daily
LOS ANGELES — A high-ranking
Justice Department official yesterday
admitted that 26 separate analyses of
the "Pentagon Papers" and two
accompanying documents were
prepared by the Department of
Defense. The official stated that all
but two were forwarded to the
government prosecutor here shortly
after they were written.
Prosecutor David Nissen repeatedly
has told presiding Judge Matt Byrne
Jr. that he knew of no such studies.
The defense, which today claimed
— but made no attempt to prove —
that there are at least 18 other such
studies, is attempting to force the
government to reveal the contents of
the analyses on the grounds that they
contain "exculpatory material" — that
is, evidence that could be used by the
defendants to prove their innocence.
'Damage Reports'
It is not clear how many of the 26
analyses, called "damage reports" by
the Department of Defense, contain
exculpatory- material.
However, material read into the
transcript Friday afternoon by Byrne,
who is examining the reports in
camera, shows that at least one, an
analysis of the 1954 Geneva
Convention, does contain an opinion

favorable to the defense. Under the
terms of a 1963 Supreme Court ruling,
all such material must be turned over
to the defendants.
John L. Martin, a section chief in
the Justice Department's Internal
Security Division, told Byrne under
cross examination that two of the first
"damage reports" had to be rewritten.
Martin testified that the two
reports did not respond to several
important questions — including
national security — and that they
"didn't have enough depth . .. not
enough specifics, and not enough
details." These two reports were not
mailed to Nissen, Martin testified.
However, defense attorney Charles
Nessen contended that all of the
original reports were completed very
rapidly in mid-December, 1971 and
that all were rewritten to eliminate
any exculpatory material that shows
that release of the "Papers" did not
harm the national defense. He told
Byrne he would try to prove his point
during today's session.
In order to prove its case against
Dr. Daniel Ellsberg, 41, and Anthony
J. Russo Jr., 36, who are charged with
espionage, theft of government
property and conspiracy, the
government must convince the jurors
that release of the "Papers" damaged

the national defense.
Should Byrne find that some
exculpatory material was not turned
over to the defense, he could dismiss
all or part of the 15-count indictment,
delay the trial to give the defense
additional time for preparation, or
take several other actions against the
prosecution, including citing members
of the prosecution staff and the
Justice Department for contempt.
Martin's Testimony
According to Martin's testimony,
the "damage reports" took nearly five
months to prepare. He said they were
begun at his direction on Dec. 13,
1971, half a year after the government
tried unsuccessfully to block
publication of segments of the
"Papers" by several newspapers on the
grounds that their publication would
be harmful to the national interest.
Martin said that the analyses were
prepared by William Gerhardt, a
national security agency employee "on
loan" to the general counsel's office at
the Department of Defense.
Speaking so quitely that spectators
were unable to hear segments of his
answers, Martin testified that to his
knowledge there are no other "damage
reports" or similar documents.
However, at the close of yesterday's
session, Nissen told Byrne that at least

two more documents would be
forthcoming today — several hundred
sheets of "working papers" written
during a Government Printing Office
(GPO) study prior to that agency's
printing an "authorized" edition of
the "Papers," and a three-paragraph
memorandum detailing a search of
Pentagon files for exculpatory
evidence.
