## Does Intelligence Measure Quality? 
### 
[Dr. William] Shockley's study
of caucasian, identical, but
separately-reared twins claims to
show that inherited intelligence is
a four-times-more-important
factor in determining IQ than
environmental determinants.
Geneticists can debate whether
Shockley's research has
established this as a scientific
truth, but for the sake of
argument, let us suppose that
Shockley has discovered a
universal law.

Second, Shockley asserts that
members of the Black race are less
intelligent than Caucasians, and he
attributes this difference primarily
to genetic dissimilarities between
Blacks and Whites. I am not
familiar with the evidence
Shockley advances to support this
hypothesis, but again for the sake
of argument, let's suppose this
assertion is true.
The third aspect of Shockley's
thesis, and really the most critical,
if his whole theory of "human
quality" is to hang together, is
that those who are less intelligent
are morally inferior. According to
the Jan. 23 Daily, Shockley cites a
California study of the 1920s
which produced a ".5 correlation
between childhood IQ and
eventual income" and also
"positive correlations between
high IQ and lower levels of
divorce, alcoholism, and jail
sentences."
Important Questions
What the methodology of this
study was, who conducted the
research, what results would have
been obtained in another culture,
whether the tests used accurately
defined and measured
"intelligence," and whether
results disclose a universal truth
about "human quality" are
important questions. But in any
case, does this study indicate, or
has Shockley shown anywhere,
that people don't succeed or do
engage in criminal actions because
they are less intelligent? The
answer is no. No one has proved
this assertion, and Shockley wants
us to accept a priori a
scientifically unproved hypothesis
as a scientific law. It is at this
point that Shockley's claim to
possess "scientific truth" is most

pretentious, arrogant, misleading,
and false.
Would statistics showing a
positive correlation between the
yolume of ice cream sales and
the number of homicides in New
York City (assume both increase
during warm months) indicate ice
cream consumption is the cause of
murder?
Corrupt Intelligence
Plato claimed that "virtue is
knowledge," and he also
intuitively gave us the truth that
intelligent persons, if corrupted,
were particularly bad. History is
full of examples of intelligent men
who were very, very bad. It is
apparent, however, that in a
complex and unjust society those
who are less intelligent, whatever
their race, may have a harder time
coping within the rules of the
system, may be less "successful,"
and may end up more frequently
committing asocial acts
punishable under the law (we all
know sticking-up a gas station has
serious consequences whereas
corporate crime—selling unsafe or
harmful products on a mass scale,
for example—is socially approved
because "growth" and higher
profits are involved).
To deal with asocial activity, it
might be more effective (and
humane) to eliminate a corrupt
corporate state than to apply a
restrictive genetics policy to
oppressed peoples. Yet Shockley
never even considers this
possibility, because his politics are
the master of his "science."
Shockley's false claim to
possess "scientific truth" about
"human quality problems" is
what makes his statement about
"disrespect for truth in academia"
so hypocritical.

The fact that Shockley's
technical competence has been
crowned with a Nobel Prize does
not automatically invest his social
theories with logical or scientific
rigor; similarly, the rite of
quantification and even the
esoteric formula, 'TRANSOPREP
ACOR" (if we close our eyes and
repeat the magic words three
times, will we be instantly seized
with Shocklean illumination?) is
not enough to sway all of us. With
Shockley, social science becomes
quackery.
Yet those who challenge him
have rightly perceived the danger.
Shockley advocated voluntary
sterilization for those with IQ's
under 100. What if the
government of the U.S. decided to
follow his recommendations? By
Shockley's reckoning, a higher
percentage of Blacks than Whites
would be tied off. What if Blacks
refused sterilization? Would
forced castration be the next
step? Even this might not be the
most "rational" and effective
approach; there might be a better
and more "final" solution.
What if Shockley's plan for
dealing with "human quality
problems" were applied by the
United States to foreign peoples?
Pursuing Shockley's scheme to its
logical conclusion, why should the
quest for "better quality" humans
stop at our national borders? Why
not make the world "safe" for the
"quality" races?
Technical Jargon
Shockley's race theories are
disturbing because of their broad
implications and also because they
are packaged in the technical
jargon of science, which insures
credibility among ordinary
citizens and government and
corporate managers alike.
Hopefully, those who debate
Shockley in the future will not
only challenge the first two
premises of his argumnt, but will
demolish the flimsy pretense of
scientific validation on which his
assertion that intelligence
determines right conduct rests. If
this "proof" is discredited, the
whole theory remains only on the
level of pseudo-scientific racist
ideology where it belongs.

repeat the magic words three
times, will we be instantly seized
with Shocklean illumination?) is
not enough to sway all of us. With
Shockley, social science becomes
quackery.
Yet those who challenge him
have rightly perceived the danger.
Shockley advocated voluntary
sterilization for those with IQ's
under 100. What if the
government of the U.S. decided to
follow his recommendations? By
Shockley's reckoning, a higher
percentage of Blacks than Whites
would be tied off. What if Blacks
refused sterilization? Would
forced castration be the next
step? Even this might not be the
most "rational" and effective
approach; there might be a better
and more "final" solution.
What if Shockley's plan for
dealing with "human quality
problems" were applied by the
United States to foreign peoples?
Pursuing Shockley's scheme to its
logical conclusion, why should the
quest for "better quality" humans
stop at our national borders? Why
not make the world "safe" for the
"quality" races?
Technical Jargon
Shockley's race theories are
disturbing because of their broad
implications and also because they
are packaged in the technical
jargon of science, which insures
credibility among ordinary
citizens and government and
corporate managers alike.
Hopefully, those who debate
Shockley in the future will not
only challenge the first two
premises of his argumnt, but will
demolish the flimsy pretense of
scientific validation on which his
assertion that intelligence
determines right conduct rests. If
this "proof" is discredited, the
whole theory remains only on the
level of pseudo-scientific racist
ideology where it belongs.

[Dr. William] Shockley's study
of caucasian, identical, but
separately-reared twins claims to
show that inherited intelligence is
a four-times-more-important
factor in determining IQ than
environmental determinants.
Geneticists can debate whether
Shockley's research has
established this as a scientific
truth, but for the sake of
argument, let us suppose that
Shockley has discovered a
universal law.

Second, Shockley asserts that
members of the Black race are less
intelligent than Caucasians, and he
attributes this difference primarily
to genetic dissimilarities between
Blacks and Whites. I am not
familiar with the evidence
Shockley advances to support this
hypothesis, but again for the sake
of argument, let's suppose this
assertion is true.
The third aspect of Shockley's
thesis, and really the most critical,
if his whole theory of "human
quality" is to hang together, is
that those who are less intelligent
are morally inferior. According to
the Jan. 23 Daily, Shockley cites a
California study of the 1920s
which produced a ".5 correlation
between childhood IQ and
eventual income" and also
"positive correlations between
high IQ and lower levels of
divorce, alcoholism, and jail
sentences."
Important Questions
What the methodology of this
study was, who conducted the
research, what results would have
been obtained in another culture,
whether the tests used accurately
defined and measured
"intelligence," and whether
results disclose a universal truth
about "human quality" are
important questions. But in any
case, does this study indicate, or
has Shockley shown anywhere,
that people don't succeed or do
engage in criminal actions because
they are less intelligent? The
answer is no. No one has proved
this assertion, and Shockley wants
us to accept a priori a
scientifically unproved hypothesis
as a scientific law. It is at this
point that Shockley's claim to
possess "scientific truth" is most

pretentious, arrogant, misleading,
and false.
Would statistics showing a
positive correlation between the
yolume of ice cream sales and
the number of homicides in New
York City (assume both increase
during warm months) indicate ice
cream consumption is the cause of
murder?
Corrupt Intelligence
Plato claimed that "virtue is
knowledge," and he also
intuitively gave us the truth that
intelligent persons, if corrupted,
were particularly bad. History is
full of examples of intelligent men
who were very, very bad. It is
apparent, however, that in a
complex and unjust society those
who are less intelligent, whatever
their race, may have a harder time
coping within the rules of the
system, may be less "successful,"
and may end up more frequently
committing asocial acts
punishable under the law (we all
know sticking-up a gas station has
serious consequences whereas
corporate crime—selling unsafe or
harmful products on a mass scale,
for example—is socially approved
because "growth" and higher
profits are involved).
To deal with asocial activity, it
might be more effective (and
humane) to eliminate a corrupt
corporate state than to apply a
restrictive genetics policy to
oppressed peoples. Yet Shockley
never even considers this
possibility, because his politics are
the master of his "science."
Shockley's false claim to
possess "scientific truth" about
"human quality problems" is
what makes his statement about
"disrespect for truth in academia"
so hypocritical.

possess "scientific truth" is most

pretentious, arrogant, misleading,
and false.
Would statistics showing a
positive correlation between the
yolume of ice cream sales and
the number of homicides in New
York City (assume both increase
during warm months) indicate ice
cream consumption is the cause of
murder?
Corrupt Intelligence
Plato claimed that "virtue is
knowledge," and he also
intuitively gave us the truth that
intelligent persons, if corrupted,
were particularly bad. History is
full of examples of intelligent men
who were very, very bad. It is
apparent, however, that in a
complex and unjust society those
who are less intelligent, whatever
their race, may have a harder time
coping within the rules of the
system, may be less "successful,"
and may end up more frequently
committing asocial acts
punishable under the law (we all
know sticking-up a gas station has
serious consequences whereas
corporate crime—selling unsafe or
harmful products on a mass scale,
for example—is socially approved
because "growth" and higher
profits are involved).
To deal with asocial activity, it
might be more effective (and
humane) to eliminate a corrupt
corporate state than to apply a
restrictive genetics policy to
oppressed peoples. Yet Shockley
never even considers this
possibility, because his politics are
the master of his "science."
Shockley's false claim to
possess "scientific truth" about
"human quality problems" is
what makes his statement about
"disrespect for truth in academia"
so hypocritical.

The fact that Shockley's
technical competence has been
crowned with a Nobel Prize does
not automatically invest his social
theories with logical or scientific
rigor; similarly, the rite of
quantification and even the
esoteric formula, 'TRANSOPREP
ACOR" (if we close our eyes and
repeat the magic words three
times, will we be instantly seized
with Shocklean illumination?) is
not enough to sway all of us. With
Shockley, social science becomes
quackery.
Yet those who challenge him
have rightly perceived the danger.
Shockley advocated voluntary
sterilization for those with IQ's
under 100. What if the
government of the U.S. decided to
follow his recommendations? By
Shockley's reckoning, a higher
percentage of Blacks than Whites
would be tied off. What if Blacks
refused sterilization? Would
forced castration be the next
step? Even this might not be the
most "rational" and effective
approach; there might be a better
and more "final" solution.
What if Shockley's plan for
dealing with "human quality
problems" were applied by the
United States to foreign peoples?
Pursuing Shockley's scheme to its
logical conclusion, why should the
quest for "better quality" humans
stop at our national borders? Why
not make the world "safe" for the
"quality" races?
Technical Jargon
Shockley's race theories are
disturbing because of their broad
implications and also because they
are packaged in the technical
jargon of science, which insures
credibility among ordinary
citizens and government and
corporate managers alike.
Hopefully, those who debate
Shockley in the future will not
only challenge the first two
premises of his argumnt, but will
demolish the flimsy pretense of
scientific validation on which his
assertion that intelligence
determines right conduct rests. If
this "proof" is discredited, the
whole theory remains only on the
level of pseudo-scientific racist
ideology where it belongs.

from Stanford in 1960 and is an

[Dr. William] Shockley's study
of caucasian, identical, but
separately-reared twins claims to
show that inherited intelligence is
a four-times-more-important
factor in determining IQ than
environmental determinants.
Geneticists can debate whether
Shockley's research has
established this as a scientific
truth, but for the sake of
argument, let us suppose that
Shockley has discovered a
universal law.

Second, Shockley asserts that
members of the Black race are less
intelligent than Caucasians, and he
attributes this difference primarily
to genetic dissimilarities between
Blacks and Whites. I am not
familiar with the evidence
Shockley advances to support this
hypothesis, but again for the sake
of argument, let's suppose this
assertion is true.
The third aspect of Shockley's
thesis, and really the most critical,
if his whole theory of "human
quality" is to hang together, is
that those who are less intelligent
are morally inferior. According to
the Jan. 23 Daily, Shockley cites a
California study of the 1920s
which produced a ".5 correlation
between childhood IQ and
eventual income" and also
"positive correlations between
high IQ and lower levels of
divorce, alcoholism, and jail
sentences."
Important Questions
What the methodology of this
study was, who conducted the
research, what results would have
been obtained in another culture,
whether the tests used accurately
defined and measured
"intelligence," and whether
results disclose a universal truth
about "human quality" are
important questions. But in any
case, does this study indicate, or
has Shockley shown anywhere,
that people don't succeed or do
engage in criminal actions because
they are less intelligent? The
answer is no. No one has proved
this assertion, and Shockley wants
us to accept a priori a
scientifically unproved hypothesis
as a scientific law. It is at this
point that Shockley's claim to
possess "scientific truth" is most

pretentious, arrogant, misleading,
and false.
