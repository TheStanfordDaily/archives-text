'Lily-White Majority' Offended
Editor:
Recent letters and commentary
in the Daily make it sound as if
Nixon did the poor a favor by
cutting off Federal housing
programs. I, on the contrary,
think this action displays a callous
disregard for the plight of low
income families.
Anyone who has worked with
the Federal Department of
Housing and Urban Development
can agree that moderate and low
income housing subsidy programs
are administered by a nightmarish
bureaucracy that needs reform. It
is also true that corruption has
crept into the administration of
the Federal housing apparatus in
some cities. Finally, it cannot be
doubted that banks and
high-income real estate investors
benefit from the tax-shelters and
mortgage subsidies allowed by the
programs as much if not more
than the tenants of the buildings
themselves.
But all of these problems could
be dealt with through tightened
administration and new legislation
that could cut out the worst part

of the corruption and most of the
"pork-barrel." A moratorium is
not needed to do this.
Why, then, has Nixon chosen
to cut off the funds entirely?
Primarily because non-profit
groups such as the Urban
Coalition are beginning to use the
programs where they are needed
most: near suburban employment
centers such as Stanford. Nixon's
lily-white majority is upset by the
idea of sharing their schools and
parks with low income neighbors.
What better way for the President
to re-assure his supporters than by
eliminating Federal support
entirely?

Message From Vienna
Editor:
As a member of the Stanford
faculty now teaching at the
Vienna campus I would like to
present some information and
some ideas about the work being
done here, about life in Vienna,
and about prospects for the
future. In the first place, an
officer of the University assured
us that a decision to close the
Vienna campus would be made on
purely financial grounds: the
operation has been losing money.
Such a decision in no way reflects
on the quality of instruction at
the campus or the quality of life
in the Austrian capital.
My own opinion, which is
supported by the statements of
many former students and
teachers here, is that courses in
music, art, and drama, as well as
other offerings at this campus, are
and have been a highly stimulating
academic experience. From an
educational and cultural
standpoint the Vienna campus is
one of the most attractive of the
Overseas Campuses and it is
indeed regrettable that the
University administration should
find it necessary, for reasons that
have nothing to do with academic
excellence, to abandon Vienna. Of
course we know that the
University is experiencing
financial strains, but may we hope
that economic considerations may
not always be the overriding ones?
What of the future?
Considering the advantages
Vienna offers as a cultural center,
as the former capital of the
Austro-Hungarian Empire, as the
natural gateway to Eastern
Europe and the Balkans, as a
distinguished center of
scholarship, it seems to me
inconceivable that the new
Director of Overseas Campuses,
when he is appointed, will not
consider the possibility of
maintaining the Vienna campus,
perhaps in a new location and
with a modified intellectual
emphasis.
One possibility that should and
no doubt will be considered is the
proposal offered many weeks ago
by the Center for Russian and
East European Studies that the
Vienna campus become a center
for the study of Eastern European
languages, literatures, and history.
Vienna has advantages in hosting
such a program that no East
European capital can match, and
the most important of these
advantages is that Vienna is a
Western city where free and
untrammeled study is still
possible, and where all viewpoints
can be heard. As chairman of the
committee that presented that
proposal I should like to voice the
fervent hope that the new
Director of Overseas Campuses
move rapidly in the direction of
saving for the University a unique
educational facility that should
not be lost.
