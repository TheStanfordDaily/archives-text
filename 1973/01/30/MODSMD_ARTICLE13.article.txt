Agnew Arrives In Saigon
SAIGON — Vice President Spiro T. Agnew
arrived in Saigon today in an apparent show of
the U.S. government's continued support for
President Nguyen Van Thieu's regime.
Agnew was expected to meet later in the day
with Thieu.
Saigon is Agnew's first stop on a
seven-nation Asian tour that includes also
Cambodia, Thailand, Laos, Singapore,
Indonesia and Malaysia.
Meanwhile, hundreds more reported
cease-fire violations and casualties by the
thousands threw the Vietnam truce into bloody
turbulence, but the violations appeared to be
declining today.
The Saigon command said there were 257
violations between noon yesterday and dawn
today Saigon time, a 30 percent decline from
the previous reporting period.
In Saigon, a delegation of North Vietnamese
and Viet Cong envoys flown from Hanoi to
Saigon by U.S. aircraft, disembarked from the
planes after a 21-hour sit-in.
The delegation, including 50 North
Vietnamese and 40 Viet Cong, were previously
reported to consist of 150 North Vietnamese.
The Communists were flown to Saigon to
participate in the four-party Joint Military
Commission that is to supervise the initial
stages of the cease-fire.
In Washington, 56 Americans known to have
been prisoners of war in Southeast Asia remain
unaccounted for by North Vietnam, the
Pentagon said yesterday.
Defense Department spokesman Jerry W.
Friedheim said an initial name-by-name analysis
indicates that there were "56 men that we had
previously carried on our list of prisoners of
war that are not on either list" received from
the North Vietnamese.
Officials said these men were known to have
been alive in Communist prison camps at some

point during the war.
Two lists turned over to U.S. officials in
Paris Saturday by the Communists identify 555
U.S. fighting men captured in North and South
Vietnam and 55 others who died.
There also were no clues to the whereabouts
of 1269 men listed as missing in Southeast Asia,
including more than 300 lost in Laos during air
strikes against enemy supply routes.
"We don't have any further information
about them at this point," Friedheim told
newsmen. But he said a list of the missing and
captured in Laos was expected shortly.
Nixon Reveals '74 Budget
WASHINGTON — President Nixon demanded
death for dozens of federal spending programs
yesterday, called on Congress for a rigid 1974
budget ceiling of $268.7 billion, and cautioned
that greater spending would mean "high taxes,
higher interest rates, renewed inflation, or all
three."
"I oppose these alternatives; with a firm rein
on spending, none of them is necessary," Nixon
said in his fiscal 1974 budget message.
The document lived up to advance billing as
an "axe job" on many social, health, housing,
education, and antipoverty programs of his
Democratic predecessors — programs Nixon
said had failed after a fair trial.
Despite the domestic cutbacks, the budget
called for $81.1 billion of military outlays, the
biggest defense budget in history even with the
peace agreement in Vietnam. It provided no
funds for reconstruction of South Vietnam.
Nixon invited an intensified power struggle
with the Democratic-controlled Congress not
only on spending but on two other old battle
fronts.
He urged the bundling of 70 federal aid
programs into four broad "special
revenue-sharing programs" for the states and
cities, with less federal control. And he
repeated his call for a drastic governmental

reorganization which Congress has resisted for'
two years.
Congress reacted quickly to President
Nixon's 1974 budget as both Democrats and
Republicans called for a reordering of priorities.
"Drastic cutbacks in housing, manpower
training, poverty, urban and agricultural
programs . . . must be repaired by adopting
appropriate alternatives or rearranging
priorities," said Sen. Jacob K. Javits.
"The federal government clearly has a
continuing obligation to help those who cannot
help themselves," the New York Republican
said.
The Democrats took a much tougher stand
with Sen. Hubert H. Humphrey of Minnesota
labeling the budget as "one of deception,
deficits, domestic disengagement and neglect.
"The budget is deceptive in its claim that
Congress is the big spender while the President
is the 'economizer,'" Humphrey said. "In
reality, Congress has cut the President's budget
each year — last year by about $5 billion in
defense alone."
House Speaker Carl Albert called the budget
"a big business budget that leaves the common
man out."
The Oklahoma Democrat said Nixon's
proposal was "the vehicle to make the rich
richer in the hope that they will let some of
their wealth trickle down to the laborers, and
the farmers and the workers. . ."
Bugging Trial Nears End
WASHINGTON — The prosecutor in the
Watergate bugging trial told the jury yesterday
that defendant Gordon Liddy was "the
moneyman, the supervisor, the organizer" of
espionage in Democratic headquarters and that
co-defendant James W. McCord Jr. did his
bidding.
Never once referring to involvement by the
Committee for Re-election of the President, for
which both men worked, prosecutor Earl J.

Silbert said of the two defendants: "He and
Liddy were off on an enterprise of their own."
Both sides had rested earlier in the day — the
15th of the trial, and Silbert completed his
one-hour closing argument. Judge John J. Sirica
put off the defense's closing arguments until
today and said he would issue his instructions
to the jury afterward.
Repeatedly turning toward the two
defendants — the only ones left on trial from an
original seven — Silbert asked:
"Who was the boss that night?" referring to
an evening when the men were riding around
with a young college student looking over
McGovern headquarters.
"The boss was the defendant Liddy, the
moneyman, the supervisor, the organizer."
Senate Confirms Richardson
WASHINGTON — The Senate yesterday
confirmed President Nixon's nomination of
Elliot L. Richardson to be secretary of Defense.
The vote was 81-1, with only Sen. James
Abourezk (D-South Dakota), voting against.
Richardson, who has been secretary of
Health, Education and Welfare, succeeds Melvin
R. Laird in the Pentagon Cabinet post.
Earlier the Senate Labor Committee
approved without a dissenting vote the
nomination of Peter J. Brennan, New York
labor leader, to be Secretary of Labor.
This completed Ssnate committee approval
of all of Nixon's new Cabinet members, but
three of the six still have to be acted on by the
Senate.
Today's Weather
Partly cloudy today through tomorrow with
chance of showers. Little temperature change.
Low nights in the 40s. High today and
tomorrow in the 50s. Gusty southerly winds
decreasing today.

Committee for Re-election of the President, for
which both men worked, prosecutor Earl J.

Silbert said of the two defendants: "He and
Liddy were off on an enterprise of their own."
Both sides had rested earlier in the day — the
15th of the trial, and Silbert completed his
one-hour closing argument. Judge John J. Sirica
put off the defense's closing arguments until
today and said he would issue his instructions
to the jury afterward.
Repeatedly turning toward the two
defendants — the only ones left on trial from an
original seven — Silbert asked:
"Who was the boss that night?" referring to
an evening when the men were riding around
with a young college student looking over
McGovern headquarters.
"The boss was the defendant Liddy, the
moneyman, the supervisor, the organizer."
Senate Confirms Richardson
WASHINGTON — The Senate yesterday
confirmed President Nixon's nomination of
Elliot L. Richardson to be secretary of Defense.
The vote was 81-1, with only Sen. James
Abourezk (D-South Dakota), voting against.
Richardson, who has been secretary of
Health, Education and Welfare, succeeds Melvin
R. Laird in the Pentagon Cabinet post.
Earlier the Senate Labor Committee
approved without a dissenting vote the
nomination of Peter J. Brennan, New York
labor leader, to be Secretary of Labor.
This completed Ssnate committee approval
of all of Nixon's new Cabinet members, but
three of the six still have to be acted on by the
Senate.
Today's Weather
Partly cloudy today through tomorrow with
chance of showers. Little temperature change.
Low nights in the 40s. High today and
tomorrow in the 50s. Gusty southerly winds
decreasing today.
Agnew Arrives In Saigon
SAIGON — Vice President Spiro T. Agnew
arrived in Saigon today in an apparent show of
the U.S. government's continued support for
President Nguyen Van Thieu's regime.
Agnew was expected to meet later in the day
with Thieu.
Saigon is Agnew's first stop on a
seven-nation Asian tour that includes also
Cambodia, Thailand, Laos, Singapore,
Indonesia and Malaysia.
Meanwhile, hundreds more reported
cease-fire violations and casualties by the
thousands threw the Vietnam truce into bloody
turbulence, but the violations appeared to be
declining today.
The Saigon command said there were 257
violations between noon yesterday and dawn
today Saigon time, a 30 percent decline from
the previous reporting period.
In Saigon, a delegation of North Vietnamese
and Viet Cong envoys flown from Hanoi to
Saigon by U.S. aircraft, disembarked from the
planes after a 21-hour sit-in.
The delegation, including 50 North
Vietnamese and 40 Viet Cong, were previously
reported to consist of 150 North Vietnamese.
The Communists were flown to Saigon to
participate in the four-party Joint Military
Commission that is to supervise the initial
stages of the cease-fire.
In Washington, 56 Americans known to have
been prisoners of war in Southeast Asia remain
unaccounted for by North Vietnam, the
Pentagon said yesterday.
Defense Department spokesman Jerry W.
Friedheim said an initial name-by-name analysis
indicates that there were "56 men that we had
previously carried on our list of prisoners of
war that are not on either list" received from
the North Vietnamese.
Officials said these men were known to have
been alive in Communist prison camps at some

point during the war.
Two lists turned over to U.S. officials in
Paris Saturday by the Communists identify 555
U.S. fighting men captured in North and South
Vietnam and 55 others who died.
There also were no clues to the whereabouts
of 1269 men listed as missing in Southeast Asia,
including more than 300 lost in Laos during air
strikes against enemy supply routes.
"We don't have any further information
about them at this point," Friedheim told
newsmen. But he said a list of the missing and
captured in Laos was expected shortly.
Nixon Reveals '74 Budget
WASHINGTON — President Nixon demanded
death for dozens of federal spending programs
yesterday, called on Congress for a rigid 1974
budget ceiling of $268.7 billion, and cautioned
that greater spending would mean "high taxes,
higher interest rates, renewed inflation, or all
three."
"I oppose these alternatives; with a firm rein
on spending, none of them is necessary," Nixon
said in his fiscal 1974 budget message.
The document lived up to advance billing as
an "axe job" on many social, health, housing,
education, and antipoverty programs of his
Democratic predecessors — programs Nixon
said had failed after a fair trial.
Despite the domestic cutbacks, the budget
called for $81.1 billion of military outlays, the
biggest defense budget in history even with the
peace agreement in Vietnam. It provided no
funds for reconstruction of South Vietnam.
Nixon invited an intensified power struggle
with the Democratic-controlled Congress not
only on spending but on two other old battle
fronts.
He urged the bundling of 70 federal aid
programs into four broad "special
revenue-sharing programs" for the states and
cities, with less federal control. And he
repeated his call for a drastic governmental

reorganization which Congress has resisted for'
two years.
Congress reacted quickly to President
Nixon's 1974 budget as both Democrats and
Republicans called for a reordering of priorities.
"Drastic cutbacks in housing, manpower
training, poverty, urban and agricultural
programs . . . must be repaired by adopting
appropriate alternatives or rearranging
priorities," said Sen. Jacob K. Javits.
"The federal government clearly has a
continuing obligation to help those who cannot
help themselves," the New York Republican
said.
The Democrats took a much tougher stand
with Sen. Hubert H. Humphrey of Minnesota
labeling the budget as "one of deception,
deficits, domestic disengagement and neglect.
"The budget is deceptive in its claim that
Congress is the big spender while the President
is the 'economizer,'" Humphrey said. "In
reality, Congress has cut the President's budget
each year — last year by about $5 billion in
defense alone."
House Speaker Carl Albert called the budget
"a big business budget that leaves the common
man out."
The Oklahoma Democrat said Nixon's
proposal was "the vehicle to make the rich
richer in the hope that they will let some of
their wealth trickle down to the laborers, and
the farmers and the workers. . ."
Bugging Trial Nears End
WASHINGTON — The prosecutor in the
Watergate bugging trial told the jury yesterday
that defendant Gordon Liddy was "the
moneyman, the supervisor, the organizer" of
espionage in Democratic headquarters and that
co-defendant James W. McCord Jr. did his
bidding.
Never once referring to involvement by the

cities, with less federal control. And he
repeated his call for a drastic governmental

reorganization which Congress has resisted for'
two years.
Congress reacted quickly to President
Nixon's 1974 budget as both Democrats and
Republicans called for a reordering of priorities.
"Drastic cutbacks in housing, manpower
training, poverty, urban and agricultural
programs . . . must be repaired by adopting
appropriate alternatives or rearranging
priorities," said Sen. Jacob K. Javits.
"The federal government clearly has a
continuing obligation to help those who cannot
help themselves," the New York Republican
said.
The Democrats took a much tougher stand
with Sen. Hubert H. Humphrey of Minnesota
labeling the budget as "one of deception,
deficits, domestic disengagement and neglect.
"The budget is deceptive in its claim that
Congress is the big spender while the President
is the 'economizer,'" Humphrey said. "In
reality, Congress has cut the President's budget
each year — last year by about $5 billion in
defense alone."
House Speaker Carl Albert called the budget
"a big business budget that leaves the common
man out."
The Oklahoma Democrat said Nixon's
proposal was "the vehicle to make the rich
richer in the hope that they will let some of
their wealth trickle down to the laborers, and
the farmers and the workers. . ."
Bugging Trial Nears End
WASHINGTON — The prosecutor in the
Watergate bugging trial told the jury yesterday
that defendant Gordon Liddy was "the
moneyman, the supervisor, the organizer" of
espionage in Democratic headquarters and that
co-defendant James W. McCord Jr. did his
bidding.
Never once referring to involvement by the
Committee for Re-election of the President, for
which both men worked, prosecutor Earl J.

Silbert said of the two defendants: "He and
Liddy were off on an enterprise of their own."
Both sides had rested earlier in the day — the
15th of the trial, and Silbert completed his
one-hour closing argument. Judge John J. Sirica
put off the defense's closing arguments until
today and said he would issue his instructions
to the jury afterward.
Repeatedly turning toward the two
defendants — the only ones left on trial from an
original seven — Silbert asked:
"Who was the boss that night?" referring to
an evening when the men were riding around
with a young college student looking over
McGovern headquarters.
"The boss was the defendant Liddy, the
moneyman, the supervisor, the organizer."
Senate Confirms Richardson
WASHINGTON — The Senate yesterday
confirmed President Nixon's nomination of
Elliot L. Richardson to be secretary of Defense.
The vote was 81-1, with only Sen. James
Abourezk (D-South Dakota), voting against.
Richardson, who has been secretary of
Health, Education and Welfare, succeeds Melvin
R. Laird in the Pentagon Cabinet post.
Earlier the Senate Labor Committee
approved without a dissenting vote the
nomination of Peter J. Brennan, New York
labor leader, to be Secretary of Labor.
This completed Ssnate committee approval
of all of Nixon's new Cabinet members, but
three of the six still have to be acted on by the
Senate.
Today's Weather
Partly cloudy today through tomorrow with
chance of showers. Little temperature change.
Low nights in the 40s. High today and
tomorrow in the 50s. Gusty southerly winds
decreasing today.
Agnew Arrives In Saigon
SAIGON — Vice President Spiro T. Agnew
arrived in Saigon today in an apparent show of
the U.S. government's continued support for
President Nguyen Van Thieu's regime.
Agnew was expected to meet later in the day
with Thieu.
Saigon is Agnew's first stop on a
seven-nation Asian tour that includes also
Cambodia, Thailand, Laos, Singapore,
Indonesia and Malaysia.
Meanwhile, hundreds more reported
cease-fire violations and casualties by the
thousands threw the Vietnam truce into bloody
turbulence, but the violations appeared to be
declining today.
The Saigon command said there were 257
violations between noon yesterday and dawn
today Saigon time, a 30 percent decline from
the previous reporting period.
In Saigon, a delegation of North Vietnamese
and Viet Cong envoys flown from Hanoi to
Saigon by U.S. aircraft, disembarked from the
planes after a 21-hour sit-in.
The delegation, including 50 North
Vietnamese and 40 Viet Cong, were previously
reported to consist of 150 North Vietnamese.
The Communists were flown to Saigon to
participate in the four-party Joint Military
Commission that is to supervise the initial
stages of the cease-fire.
In Washington, 56 Americans known to have
been prisoners of war in Southeast Asia remain
unaccounted for by North Vietnam, the
Pentagon said yesterday.
Defense Department spokesman Jerry W.
Friedheim said an initial name-by-name analysis
indicates that there were "56 men that we had
previously carried on our list of prisoners of
war that are not on either list" received from
the North Vietnamese.
Officials said these men were known to have
been alive in Communist prison camps at some

point during the war.
Two lists turned over to U.S. officials in
Paris Saturday by the Communists identify 555
U.S. fighting men captured in North and South
Vietnam and 55 others who died.
There also were no clues to the whereabouts
of 1269 men listed as missing in Southeast Asia,
including more than 300 lost in Laos during air
strikes against enemy supply routes.
"We don't have any further information
about them at this point," Friedheim told
newsmen. But he said a list of the missing and
captured in Laos was expected shortly.
Nixon Reveals '74 Budget
WASHINGTON — President Nixon demanded
death for dozens of federal spending programs
yesterday, called on Congress for a rigid 1974
budget ceiling of $268.7 billion, and cautioned
that greater spending would mean "high taxes,
higher interest rates, renewed inflation, or all
three."
"I oppose these alternatives; with a firm rein
on spending, none of them is necessary," Nixon
said in his fiscal 1974 budget message.
The document lived up to advance billing as
an "axe job" on many social, health, housing,
education, and antipoverty programs of his
Democratic predecessors — programs Nixon
said had failed after a fair trial.
Despite the domestic cutbacks, the budget
called for $81.1 billion of military outlays, the
biggest defense budget in history even with the
peace agreement in Vietnam. It provided no
funds for reconstruction of South Vietnam.
Nixon invited an intensified power struggle
with the Democratic-controlled Congress not
only on spending but on two other old battle
fronts.
He urged the bundling of 70 federal aid
programs into four broad "special
revenue-sharing programs" for the states and
cities, with less federal control. And he
repeated his call for a drastic governmental

reorganization which Congress has resisted for'
two years.
Congress reacted quickly to President
Nixon's 1974 budget as both Democrats and
