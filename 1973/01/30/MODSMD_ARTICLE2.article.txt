# Programs Improve Reading Speed
## 
### GLENN KRAMON First of Two Parts 
Some years ago, a teen-aged boy in
Texas named Thomas Jefferson
Vaughn claimed he could read 85,000
words per minute. Few believed him
until he flipped through the 1146
pages of Tolstoy's War and Peace in 18
minutes and then discussed the book
in detail for several hours.
Vaughn is an extreme example of
many natural speed readers on whose
technique a rash of new rapid reading
courses is based. The largest program,
nationwide Evelyn Wood Reading
Dynamics, claims its 600,000
graduates, 70 percent of whom are
students or professionals, can read
between three and 10 times faster with
a 12 percent increase in
comprehension.
Wood says she began in 1945 an
intensive study of the reading methods
of 50 people from different
backgrounds who read over 1500
words per minute. She compared their
technique of reading with the
traditional method taught in schools.
Subvocalization
She observed that most people
learned by reading aloud because only
by this method, says the Evelyn Wood
brochure, could your teacher "tell
whether you were reading correctly,
and you found it reassuring to hear the
words as well as see them." Such
teaching results in "subvocalizing," or
saying the words under your breath as
you read.
"If you read by subvocalizing,"
says Carol Perley, one of Evelyn
Wood's Palo Alto instructors, "you
can only read as fast as you talk
(150-350 words per minute). In the
South, someone may read slower
because he talks slower."
Subvocalization leads to "fixation,"
the zeroing in on one word at a time,
and "regression," the loss and then
rediscovery of one's place on a page.
According to Perley, the average
reader loses his place up to 40 times a
page, occupying as much as 47 percent
of his reading time.
Dolan's Program
All speed reading programs base
their exercises on extinction of these
bad habits learned in elementary
school. John Dolan, who runs a San
Francisco school for improvement of
memory and rapid reading, also
discovered on his own a technique of
instruction stmilar to Wood's. Dolan
emphasizes two fundamentals
necessary for readers to increase their
speeds — improvement of perceptual
and conceptual abilities.
"Perceptual skill," says Dolan,
"involves how fast the reader can
visually pick up words; conceptual

skill is how much he can conceptualize
at one time."
To aid perceptual ability, speed
reading teachers force their students to
focus on groups of words rather than
fixate on only one. For example, they
hold up a card with a phrase on it only
for an instant. The student must
"photograph" it as a whole rather than
read word by word if he is to
comprehend the message.
Finger Guidance
Speed reading schools advocate use
of the reader's fingers to move along
the page in front of his eyes, inhibiting
regression. Perley noted that teachers
of the traditional reading method
loathe this method, which she regards
as "natural. . . instinctive."
Several styles of finger guidance
include the "Z" and "S" motions in
which the finger moves down the page
in either letter pattern instead of the
normal left to right technique.
Another perceptual exercise,
designed to restrain subvocalization,
makes the student read as fast as he
can and still try to comprehend.
Jim Flood, a graduate student
working on his Ph.D. in English
Education here who instructs a
six-week speed reading course on
campus, uses a mechanical "pacer" to
encourage faster reading rates. Dolan,
however, calls any machine used for
learning speed a "rubber crutch"
because he believes machine-trained
readers will lose much of their reading
rate gain after they stop using the
machine.
To help him conceptualize more
easily, Dolan advises the reader to
regard a book as a Gestaltian
"kaleidoscope" in which "you can
recognize patterns you've learned
before." He urges his students to
"anticipate, to second-guess the author
the way a defensive back must size up
the mind of an opposing quarterback."
Note-Taking
He recommends aids for getting at
the structure of a book to improve
comprehension: preview the book to
extract the core of the author's idea
from titles and subtitles.

commonly-used terms in the index,
boldfaced and/or italicized
typography, and visual aids; test
yourself on what you have read,
reconstructing an outline on paper if
necessary.
Evelyn Wood instructors suggest
that the student who must take notes
should write down each main topic,
circle it, and then branch off words or
short phrases which will bring to mind
associations when studying at a later
date.
For example, if the main topic were
"Lady Godiva," the student would
branch off words such as "hair,"
"naked," and "reaction." He would
then branch off each of these words to
add more detail to the outline.

reader loses his place up to 40 times a
page, occupying as much as 47 percent
of his reading time.
Dolan's Program
All speed reading programs base
their exercises on extinction of these
bad habits learned in elementary
school. John Dolan, who runs a San
Francisco school for improvement of
memory and rapid reading, also
discovered on his own a technique of
instruction stmilar to Wood's. Dolan
emphasizes two fundamentals
necessary for readers to increase their
speeds — improvement of perceptual
and conceptual abilities.
"Perceptual skill," says Dolan,
"involves how fast the reader can
visually pick up words; conceptual

skill is how much he can conceptualize
at one time."
To aid perceptual ability, speed
reading teachers force their students to
focus on groups of words rather than
fixate on only one. For example, they
hold up a card with a phrase on it only
for an instant. The student must
"photograph" it as a whole rather than
read word by word if he is to
comprehend the message.
Finger Guidance
Speed reading schools advocate use
of the reader's fingers to move along
the page in front of his eyes, inhibiting
regression. Perley noted that teachers
of the traditional reading method
loathe this method, which she regards
as "natural. . . instinctive."
Several styles of finger guidance
include the "Z" and "S" motions in
which the finger moves down the page
in either letter pattern instead of the
normal left to right technique.
Another perceptual exercise,
designed to restrain subvocalization,
makes the student read as fast as he
can and still try to comprehend.
Jim Flood, a graduate student
working on his Ph.D. in English
Education here who instructs a
six-week speed reading course on
campus, uses a mechanical "pacer" to
encourage faster reading rates. Dolan,
however, calls any machine used for
learning speed a "rubber crutch"
because he believes machine-trained
readers will lose much of their reading
rate gain after they stop using the
machine.
To help him conceptualize more
easily, Dolan advises the reader to
regard a book as a Gestaltian
"kaleidoscope" in which "you can
recognize patterns you've learned
before." He urges his students to
"anticipate, to second-guess the author
the way a defensive back must size up
the mind of an opposing quarterback."
Note-Taking
He recommends aids for getting at
the structure of a book to improve
comprehension: preview the book to
extract the core of the author's idea
from titles and subtitles.

commonly-used terms in the index,
boldfaced and/or italicized
typography, and visual aids; test
yourself on what you have read,
reconstructing an outline on paper if
necessary.
Evelyn Wood instructors suggest
that the student who must take notes
should write down each main topic,
circle it, and then branch off words or
short phrases which will bring to mind
associations when studying at a later
date.
For example, if the main topic were
"Lady Godiva," the student would
branch off words such as "hair,"
"naked," and "reaction." He would
then branch off each of these words to
add more detail to the outline.
Some years ago, a teen-aged boy in
Texas named Thomas Jefferson
Vaughn claimed he could read 85,000
words per minute. Few believed him
until he flipped through the 1146
pages of Tolstoy's War and Peace in 18
minutes and then discussed the book
in detail for several hours.
Vaughn is an extreme example of
many natural speed readers on whose
technique a rash of new rapid reading
courses is based. The largest program,
nationwide Evelyn Wood Reading
Dynamics, claims its 600,000
graduates, 70 percent of whom are
students or professionals, can read
between three and 10 times faster with
a 12 percent increase in
comprehension.
Wood says she began in 1945 an
intensive study of the reading methods
of 50 people from different
backgrounds who read over 1500
words per minute. She compared their
technique of reading with the
traditional method taught in schools.
Subvocalization
She observed that most people
learned by reading aloud because only
by this method, says the Evelyn Wood
brochure, could your teacher "tell
whether you were reading correctly,
and you found it reassuring to hear the
words as well as see them." Such
teaching results in "subvocalizing," or
saying the words under your breath as
you read.
"If you read by subvocalizing,"
says Carol Perley, one of Evelyn
Wood's Palo Alto instructors, "you
can only read as fast as you talk
(150-350 words per minute). In the
South, someone may read slower
because he talks slower."
Subvocalization leads to "fixation,"
the zeroing in on one word at a time,
and "regression," the loss and then
rediscovery of one's place on a page.

however, calls any machine used for
learning speed a "rubber crutch"

readers will lose much of their reading
rate gain after they stop using the
machine.
To help him conceptualize more

regard a book as a Gestaltian

recognize patterns you've learned
before." He urges his students to
"anticipate, to second-guess the author
the way a defensive back must size up
the mind of an opposing quarterback."

Evelyn Wood instructors suggest
that the student who must take notes
should write down each main topic,
circle it, and then branch off words or
short phrases which will bring to mind
associations when studying at a later
date.
For example, if the main topic were
"Lady Godiva," the student would
branch off words such as "hair,"
"naked," and "reaction." He would
then branch off each of these words to
add more detail to the outline.
Some years ago, a teen-aged boy in
Texas named Thomas Jefferson
Vaughn claimed he could read 85,000
words per minute. Few believed him
until he flipped through the 1146
pages of Tolstoy's War and Peace in 18
minutes and then discussed the book
in detail for several hours.
Vaughn is an extreme example of
many natural speed readers on whose
technique a rash of new rapid reading
courses is based. The largest program,
nationwide Evelyn Wood Reading
Dynamics, claims its 600,000
graduates, 70 percent of whom are
students or professionals, can read
between three and 10 times faster with
a 12 percent increase in
comprehension.
Wood says she began in 1945 an
intensive study of the reading methods
of 50 people from different
backgrounds who read over 1500
words per minute. She compared their
technique of reading with the
traditional method taught in schools.
Subvocalization
She observed that most people
learned by reading aloud because only
by this method, says the Evelyn Wood
brochure, could your teacher "tell
whether you were reading correctly,
and you found it reassuring to hear the
words as well as see them." Such
teaching results in "subvocalizing," or
saying the words under your breath as
you read.
"If you read by subvocalizing,"
says Carol Perley, one of Evelyn
Wood's Palo Alto instructors, "you
can only read as fast as you talk
(150-350 words per minute). In the
South, someone may read slower
because he talks slower."
Subvocalization leads to "fixation,"
the zeroing in on one word at a time,
and "regression," the loss and then
rediscovery of one's place on a page.
According to Perley, the average
reader loses his place up to 40 times a
page, occupying as much as 47 percent
of his reading time.
Dolan's Program
All speed reading programs base
their exercises on extinction of these
bad habits learned in elementary
school. John Dolan, who runs a San
Francisco school for improvement of
memory and rapid reading, also
discovered on his own a technique of
instruction stmilar to Wood's. Dolan
emphasizes two fundamentals
necessary for readers to increase their
speeds — improvement of perceptual
and conceptual abilities.
"Perceptual skill," says Dolan,
"involves how fast the reader can
visually pick up words; conceptual

skill is how much he can conceptualize
at one time."
To aid perceptual ability, speed
reading teachers force their students to
focus on groups of words rather than
fixate on only one. For example, they
hold up a card with a phrase on it only
for an instant. The student must
"photograph" it as a whole rather than
read word by word if he is to
comprehend the message.
Finger Guidance
Speed reading schools advocate use
of the reader's fingers to move along
the page in front of his eyes, inhibiting
regression. Perley noted that teachers
of the traditional reading method
loathe this method, which she regards
as "natural. . . instinctive."
Several styles of finger guidance
include the "Z" and "S" motions in
which the finger moves down the page
in either letter pattern instead of the
normal left to right technique.
Another perceptual exercise,
designed to restrain subvocalization,
makes the student read as fast as he
can and still try to comprehend.

working on his Ph.D. in English

six-week speed reading course on
