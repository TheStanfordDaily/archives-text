# Palo Alto City Council Shelves Frenchman's Terrace Proposal
## 
### ROBERT BACON 
The Palo Alto City Council last
night indefinitely postponed the
question of annexing the Frenchman's
Terrace housing site. Combined with
the federal fund moratorium which led
to the decision, the postponement
effectively shelves the long-discussed
project indefinitely.
The Council sent the related
Stanford Avenue-Bowdoin Street
intersection question to a committee.
Postponement of the annexation
was at Stanford's request. University
officials sought the deferral because
the recently-announced moratorium
on federal housing funds has placed
the future of the Frenchman's Terrace
project in doubt.
Frenchman's Terrace is proposed as

a 225-unit low/moderate-income
housing project for 20 acres of
Stanford land at the corner of Peter
Coutts and Page Mill Roads.
The Council unanimously and with
almost no debate put off the
annexation "until such time as
solutions become evident" to the
problem of funding.
18-Month Moratorium
On Jan. 8, the Department of
Housing and Urban Development
(HUD) announced an 18-month
moratorium on federal grants to
localities under the Section 236
program for housing projects like
Frenchman's Terrace.
Officials of the Stanford-Midpenin
sula Urban Coalition, sponsors of the
project, are seeking alternate sources

of construction funds. Preparing the
site and constructing the project is
estimated to cost $5 million "if it
began before July 1, 1973," according
to Ira Hall, Executive Director of the
Coalition.
Due to inflation, the postponement
caused by the federal fund cutoff will
increase the eventual cost.
Intersection
The proposed redesign of the
Stanford Avenue-Bowdoin Street
intersection, and related traffic studies
in the College Terrace subdivision
adjoining Stanford, were unanimously
referred to the Council's Finance and
Public Works Committee at the
request of its chairman, Vice Mayor
Stanley Norton. The committee will
consider the matter "at its leisure."
The city staff agreed to provide a
University committee with additional
information that it requested about
the project, but City Manager George
Sipel intimated that the city is
considering a method of implementing
its plan without Stanford's approval.
The redesign, which would direct
through traffic off Stanford Avenue
onto the campus via Bowdoin Street,
was first proposed in 1966. The idea
was resurrected last fall when some
College Terrace residents claimed that
Frenchman's Terrace would unduly
add to traffic congestion in their
neighborhood, and that the redesign
would solve the problems.
Skeptical
On Dec. 11, the University
Committee on Land and Building
Development declined to offer one

acre of Stanford land at the
intersection for annexation to the city,
to make the redesign possible. They
were skeptical toward the plan's
desirability and effectiveness.
City officials then modified their
plans to require only .35 acre of
University land. Last Monday, the
University committee asked the City
for more information on the new plan,
prior to making any decision.
In the meantime, city traffic
engineers are making large-scale
surveys of College Terrace traffic,
which Spiel said last night will
probably be completed in two or three
months.
Extraterritorial Jurisdiction
He added that, "I don't know if
annexation is necessary. We prefer to
try extraterritorial jurisdiction rather
than annexation."
According to a letter from
Augsburger to Comstock, the
University committee requested
information concerning "evidence of
the need for any realignment. . . plans
to provide for the safety of pedestrians
and bicyclists .. . the costs of the
proposed plan, and the source of
funding for the improvements."
In a third Stanford-related matter
considered last night, Dr. Thomas
Gonda, Director of Stanford Hospital,
reassured Councilwoman Enid Pearson
that the Hospital's new $9 million core
building, on which construction will
soon begin, will not upset the complex
bed priority agreements between the
city and the University which govern
use of the hospital.
