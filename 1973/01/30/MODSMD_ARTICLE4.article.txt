# Approval, Ambivalence, Skepticism
## Reactions To Draft's End Vary 
### CHRISTY WISE 
Campus reaction to the announcement by Secretary of
Defense Melvin R. Laird that "use of the draft has ended"
varied from approval to ambivalenc? to skepticism.
"I'm very happy. It has taken a lot of load off people's
future and minds," said Michael Frank, a senior. He
explained that when a peacetime draft was first
inaugurated 25 years ago, it passed by one vote. At that
time, he said, draft opponents were concerned that once
one generation had grown up with the draft, "people
would accept it after having lived with it, and it would be
hard to abolish."
With the war over, amnesty is bound to become a
major issue. Bookstore employee Jerry Fihn commented,
"Amnesty seems a logical step. I don't know how long it
will take." Fihn feels the draft is a good idea "when there
is more of a direct threat to our society, our freedom. I
can't face the draft in relationship to the Vietnam War."
Graduate student Lowry Pei thinks the end of the draft
use "is great. I'm a CO in the first place. I've already been
drafted and done my thing. I was always hacked off by it
[the draft]."
Incited Demonstrations
Pei feels the draft incited people to demonstrate.
"Without that kind of pressure you won't get people out
of Stanford dorms to protest," explained Pei. In that
sense, he feels this recent move is "good for Nixon too."
He thinks President Nixon would "have to be pushed"
to grant amnesty to draft dodgers, adding that the
President might do it by making it not seem like amnesty.
"It will take a long time," commented Pei.
"The draft has not been abolished," said University
senior counselor Alan Strain. We have simply "gone to
zero draft calls," he added.
Strain questioned the motives behind the recent action.
"We could have moved to this some time ago," he said. He
feels the effect is "to diffuse the issue," explaining that
when Congress reviews the question of induction
authority, it will be more likely to extend the present
presidential authority if there have been no draft calls
within the past six months.

Strain indicated that many groups will lobby to extend
the presidential induction authority, granted by Congress
in 1940.
"Ending the draft is just the beginning of the need to
demilitarize our society," stated Strain. He feels that the
chances for amnesty are "dim at the moment" but that
we "may see legislation for people who are willing to
come back and do alternative service."
Strain is "completely opposed" to the idea of
conscriptive service. He views on all-volunteer army as
preferable to the present mixed system of volunteers and
draftees. "We have always had a professional army with
draftees at beck and call."
Martin Anderson of the Hoover Institution, a Nixon
adviser on the draft, attributes the draft decision to Nixon
himself who, explained Anderson, announced in
November 1967 that he would eventually end the draft.
The President has pursued the idea over five years against
much opposition.
Not Independent Decision
Anderson explained Nixon couldn't have stopped use
of the draft sooner because "it's not an independent
decision." He is surprised that people don't ask why John
Kennedy or Lyndon Johnson didn't move to end the draft
â€” or didn't even think about it.
Anderson feels there is a "responsibility to defend your
country," but not to be forced to do so. He predicts that
when presidential draft induction authority ends in June,
Nixon will ask Congress to assume the responsibility for
any future use of the draft.
Peter Hanawalt, draft counselor in the Dean of Student
Affairs' office, has been busy answering questions by men
concerned with the direct affect to them of Laird's
announcement. The one group still vulnerable to the draft
consists of those men issued work or induction orders
indefinitely in 1972 who failed to show up. These men are
under continuing obligation to report and are also under
threat of prosecution.
Hanawalt emphasized that "the system itself is
permanent. Local draft boards continue to exist." He
explained that the government won't induct men but they
are "not giving up the authority to issue calls."
