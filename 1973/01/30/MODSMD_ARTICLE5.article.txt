# Ex-Director Cites Hopkins Station Conflict
## 
### JANET SANDERS 
"The department is very
sympathetic to Hopkins' Marine
Station's goals and future,"
commented Dr Norman K. Wessells,
chairman of the Biology Department.
But the letter of resignation from Prof.
John H. Phillips, Hopkins' director
until last November, asserted the
opposite.
Phillips' letter, submitted by an
anonymous person to the Palo Alto
Times last week, stated, "The now
very apparent lack of interest in and
need for a marine station within the
department (of biology) has forced the
faculty and staff into a position where
they must justify their existence."
Not only did Wessells deny Phillips'
accusation of the University's lack of
interest in the program, but University
President Richard W. Lyman said, "We
want to retain it, strengthen it, and do
everything we can to make it thrive."
Provost William Miller and Biology
Prof. Peter M. Ray, chairman of the
committee to find a new director for
Hopkins Station, also added their
praise of the program.
"All of these rumors about phasing
out Hopkins Station are garbage," said

Wessells. He did add that research
interest between the Biology
Department and Hopkins Station does
not overlap effectively, "but this does
not indicate a lack of interest in the
program, however. People in this
department are putting too much time
into it for anyone to say that they do
not care."
Phillips also claimed the phasing
out of the oceanographic programs at
the station was partly due to
University disinterest. The Proteus,
Hopkins' ocean-going research vessel,
was discontinued when the National
Science Foundation cut off its
financial support.
Wessells denied that University
disinterest was a factor in the deep-sea
program's shutdown. "The National
Science Foundation had to consolidate
its funds into a few big programs. No
matter how good our program was, it
was too small and expensive."
Ray added that "there is a
consensus among the faculty and
students at Hopkins Station that their
mission is marine coastal biology
research anyway." He said the
University intends to strengthen the
shore-based programs as it phases out
the deep-sea programs.
"There is bound to be anguish
when a program is cut off," said Ray,
explaining Phillips' criticisms of the
Hopkins program. "But there is no
question that the University has an
interest in the Hopkins Marine Station.
That is why we are undertaking the
search for an outstanding director."
Ray admitted that one of the
station's principal problems was its
failure to attract the desired amount
of grant support. "That is one of the
reasons the administration wants to

make it better than it now is," he said.
Considering the enrollment of 25 to
30 undergraduates and 25 graduates
annually, the station "is getting more
than its fair share of funds,"
commented Wessells.
According to Wessells, future plans
for Hopkins include expansion of the
faculty from four to seven members.
Ray also expressed his hope that a new

director would be found by spring.
Phillips, who denied having sent the
letter to the Times, said that he would
have preferred that it not be made
public. "I think that the University is
working very hard at this point to
come to grips with the problem of
making improvements in the place,
and 1 would hate to see the boat
rock," he said.
