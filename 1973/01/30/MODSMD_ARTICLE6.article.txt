## The 						Draft 
### 
Perhaps the most vivid memory this student generation will have of
the Vietnam War will involve the draft. Almost every male who was of
student age during the last decade worried at some time or another
about receiving that dreaded notice from the Selective Service System.
On Saturday, Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird reported that all
inductions would end immediately instead of on June 30 as had been
planned. America's youth greeted Laird's announcement with a
collective sigh of relief.
But unfortunately the draft ends only so far as inductions arc
concerned. Mandatory registration for all males when they turn 18
and the yearly lottery will continue. Government officials say this
continuation of the draft mechanism is necessary so that the
induction process could start immediately in case of a national
emergency.
We see no need for continuing the draft in any form. If America
ever comes under nuclear attack, the draft would be of little help.
And if a more limited kind of warfare creates a true national
emergency, the government should have no problem attracting
massive numbers of volunteers to fight for a just cause, as has been the
case in many previous wars.
The returning POW's have been in the headlines the last week, but
their plight has overshadowed that of the other "prisoners-of-war,"
those men who evaded the draft or deserted during the war.
Thousands of evaders and deserters are living outside the country and
amnesty has become a topic of much concern.
Many of the evaders and deserters refused to participate in the
Vietnam War on moral grounds and we do not think they should be
forever banished for standing up for their principles.
Unfortunately some evaders were motivated by base and selfish
reasons, but still we feel that all evaders should be granted conditional
amnesty. They should be allowed to return to the United States if
they are willing to perform two years of alternative service in the
Peace Corps, VISTA, or a similar agency. They should also be able to
fulfill such a requirement by helping to rebuild Indochina. Such
alternative service would be similar to that performed by
conscientious objectors during the war.
Those people who have evaded the draft because of a high concern
for human life should have no qualms about giving two years of their
lives to help underprivileged persons in this country or elsewhere. And
conditional amnesty would prevent those who evaded the draft for
selfish reasons from returning without making any commitment to
helping other people.
Many soldiers deserted during the war because they too felt it was
an immoral war. But to give any form of amnesty to all deserters
would be unfair. It is undeniable that some servicemen deserted in
situations which unjustifiably placed other servicemen's lives in
jeopardy. We cannot defend such actions and rather than being
granted amnesty, such deserters should be subject to the normal
channels of military law. All other deserters should be given the same
conditional amnesty given draft evaders. People who stood up against
the immorality of our involvement in Vietnam should not have to
remain in permanent exile.

they are willing to perform two years of alternative service in the
Peace Corps, VISTA, or a similar agency. They should also be able to
fulfill such a requirement by helping to rebuild Indochina. Such
alternative service would be similar to that performed by
conscientious objectors during the war.
Those people who have evaded the draft because of a high concern
for human life should have no qualms about giving two years of their
lives to help underprivileged persons in this country or elsewhere. And
conditional amnesty would prevent those who evaded the draft for
selfish reasons from returning without making any commitment to
helping other people.
Many soldiers deserted during the war because they too felt it was
an immoral war. But to give any form of amnesty to all deserters
would be unfair. It is undeniable that some servicemen deserted in
situations which unjustifiably placed other servicemen's lives in
jeopardy. We cannot defend such actions and rather than being
granted amnesty, such deserters should be subject to the normal
channels of military law. All other deserters should be given the same
conditional amnesty given draft evaders. People who stood up against
the immorality of our involvement in Vietnam should not have to
remain in permanent exile.
Perhaps the most vivid memory this student generation will have of
the Vietnam War will involve the draft. Almost every male who was of
student age during the last decade worried at some time or another
about receiving that dreaded notice from the Selective Service System.
On Saturday, Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird reported that all
inductions would end immediately instead of on June 30 as had been
planned. America's youth greeted Laird's announcement with a
collective sigh of relief.
But unfortunately the draft ends only so far as inductions arc
concerned. Mandatory registration for all males when they turn 18
and the yearly lottery will continue. Government officials say this
continuation of the draft mechanism is necessary so that the
induction process could start immediately in case of a national
emergency.
We see no need for continuing the draft in any form. If America
ever comes under nuclear attack, the draft would be of little help.
And if a more limited kind of warfare creates a true national
emergency, the government should have no problem attracting
massive numbers of volunteers to fight for a just cause, as has been the
case in many previous wars.
The returning POW's have been in the headlines the last week, but
their plight has overshadowed that of the other "prisoners-of-war,"
those men who evaded the draft or deserted during the war.
Thousands of evaders and deserters are living outside the country and
amnesty has become a topic of much concern.
Many of the evaders and deserters refused to participate in the
Vietnam War on moral grounds and we do not think they should be
forever banished for standing up for their principles.
Unfortunately some evaders were motivated by base and selfish
reasons, but still we feel that all evaders should be granted conditional
amnesty. They should be allowed to return to the United States if
they are willing to perform two years of alternative service in the
Peace Corps, VISTA, or a similar agency. They should also be able to
fulfill such a requirement by helping to rebuild Indochina. Such
alternative service would be similar to that performed by
