## 'Indochina Needs Relief 
### 
swopsi 157

President Nixon has at long last
announced a cease-fire in
Vietnam. All of us, regardless of
political orientation, no doubt
feel a sense of relief. But added to
this, we believe should be a sense
of concern. The needs of the
various peoples and governmental
units in Indochina for relief,
rehabilitation, and reconstruction
are enormous and complex. U.S.
citizens must understand these
needs and understand how the
U.S. can help meet these needs in
ways that do a maximum of good
and a minimum of further harm
to the peoples and cultures of
Indochina.
The cease fire will NOT mean
an end to the U.S. presence in
Indochina. In South Vietnam
alone, about 10,000 civilian
American "advisors" and
technicians will stay on, mostly
under Defense Department
contract, as well as about 1,000
Agency for International
Development officials (New York
Times, Nov. 25, 1972).
It is questionable whether this
kind of U.S. government presence
is in the best interests of the
people who will be living in the
area controlled by the government
of South Vietnam. The same
danger exists in starker form in
the Royal-Government-controlled
portion of Laos, which has
become in many ways a colony
run by the U.S. Ambassador and
the CIA.
Minimal Meddling
Reconstruction in Indochina
must be carried out by the
respective peoples and leaders
who live there, with U.S.
meddling and self-serving reduced
to a minimum. Our concern must
be with relief of human suffering,
not with military careerism,
commercial profit, or political
manipulation.
The SWOPSI workshop on
Reconstruction in Indochina is
devoting Winter quarter to the
exploration of two principal
questions:
1. What are the priority needs
of the various peoples of
Indochina for relief,
rehabilitation, reconstruction, and
new development?
2. To the extent that external
aid from the U.S. is wanted by the
governments of Indochina (and
even North Vietnam has asked for
it), what is the best way of getting
assistance to the people who need
it most, while minimizing
neo-colonialistic influence by the
donor government?
Outstanding People
Workshop participants include
several advanced graduate
students with field experience in
S.E. Asia, individuals from the
various countries of Indochina,
and a number of outstanding

outside resource people with
relevant experience in or about
Indochina.
To date we have formed three
task forces: one to study the
problem of the relocation of
refugees, one to study the
restoration of the land, and the
third to study and propose
effective ways of channeling and
monitoring external assistance.
Our goal is to prepare a report to
the Stanford community
indicating ways in which people
with particular interests and skills
can become involved politically
and otherwise in making the U.S.
participation in reconstruction
effective, or at least
non-destructive. We hope also to
make some input into the national
discussion of this issue.
Reconstruction
The workshop has a good
collection of books and
documents on reserve for SWOPSI

157 in Meyer Library, which the
community is invited to use. Also
operating in conjunction with the
workshop is the Information
Clearinghouse on Reconstruction
in Indochina, of which Steve
Thomas is Coordinator. Members
of the community desiring
information on reconstruction
matters are invited to phone him
at extension 3606, or to drop in
to see him at the Center for East
Asian Studies, Building 600-T.
There is much to be done, and
we invite every interested member
of the Stanford community
students, staff, or faculty—to join
us in the workshop whenever you
can and to contribute your ideas.
We meet every Tuesday evening at
7 p.m. in Room 61-A, Inner
Quad.
