## Ripping Off 'The People' 
### 
Chris hocker

It happened a few weeks ago. I had just
made myself a sandwich, around noontime,
when there was a knock on my door. I opened
it to find Stanley, a friend of mine from
freshman year. I hadn't seen him since then.
"Stanley! Come on in," I cried, shaking his
hand. "Can I fix you a sandwich?"
"Sure," he answered, "how about a . . . "
His voice trailed off. Staring intently at my
roast beef-on-rye, he asked, "Where did you
get that lettuce?"
"You mean, the lettuce in my sandwich? I
don't know, Safeway probably."
"Safeway!" he shouted. "Don't you know
what you're doing?"
"I'm eating a sandwich."
"No, no. When you buy lettuce at
Safeway, you are exploiting farmworkers."
"Yeah? Why's that?"
Sinking Safeway
"Because Safeway doesn't Sell United
Farmworker lettuce, that's why, and because
United Farmworkers are the only true
representatives of the people." And with that,
he ripped the lettuce out of my sandwich and
threw it into the sink.
"Look, Stan," I said, "let's not get too
carried away here. I mean, what difference
does it make . . . ."
"Coors beer!" he screamed. "You're
drinking Coors beer! Who do you think you
are drinking Coors beer?"
"Well," I stammered, "I'm—l'm just, you
know, I'm just a customer of the store, and I
just sort of.. .
"Unfair labor practices! Coors oppresses
people!" He opened my refrigerator door and
extracted the remaining bottles of beer,
smashing them one by one against the kitchen
floor.
I was becoming somewhat annoyed, but I
decided to change the subject. "So where have
vou been the last few vears, Stan?"

"Oh, I been all over. Berkeley, Delano,
Taos. I seen all kinds of things." I was relieved
to see that he had become much calmer.
"Hey, man," he said, "you really don't know
what's comin' down, do you? I mean about
the lettuce and the beer?"
"Well, no, I guess not," I answered,
"Maybe you can tell me."
Ripping Off
"Allright. Well, there's all kinds of
corporations in our society, see, that just exist
to rip off people, you know, and if people get
together and just decide, you know, not to
buy any more of their stuff, then, you know,
maybe people will stop getting ripped off.
Hey, what kind of toaster is that?"
"General Electric, I think."
"Well, see, GE is a war profiteer," he said
calmly, "and I don't think it's right for you to
kill Vietnamese with your toaster." And he
grabbed the toaster and hurled it against the
wall.
"Oh, no you don't," I yelled futilely, and
grabbed him by the arm. He struggled to get
away from me, and put his hand around the
collar of the sweater I was wearing. As he
pulled away, he managed to read the label:
"Australian Lamb's Wool."
Aborigines
"Australia!" he shrieked, "what about the
aborigines?" And he yanked the sweater off
and ripped it into two pieces in front of my
eyes.
"All right, Stanley, I said, "you've done
enough. I want you to leave, right now."
"Your pants," he answered. "Take off
your pants."
"Stan, what the hell's wrong with
you . ~
"Those are Farah slacks, aren't they? Take
'em off." He produced a long gleaming knife,
and advanced toward me with a purposeful
look in his eves.

Desperate, I tried to stall for time. "Hey,
Stan, where'd you get that keen knife?"
Army Knife
"It's a North Vietnamese army knife," he
answered with some pride as he came toward
me.
I had an idea. "Look, Stan," I said, "where
do you think the North Vietnamese got that
knife from?"
He stopped. "Russia, I guess. That's where
most of their weapons come from."
"Right. And who do you think
manufactures those knives in Russia?"
"Russian workers, I imagine."
"Right again," I continued. "And what do
those Russian workers have to eat in order to
keep manufacturing those knives?"
"Why, bread, of course," he replied.
"And where does bread come from?"
"Wheat," he said, and a look of horror
came into his eyes.
Wheat Cheat
"That's right," I screamed, "and the wheat
comes from the United States and it's grown
by great big rip-off corporations and those
corporations are all run by Republicans,
Stanley! Do you hear me? They're run by
Republicans//"
With a muffled, gurgling cry, Stanley
dropped the knife and ran out the door. A
moment later, there was a screech of brakes
and the sound of a tremendous impact.
I ran outside. Stanley was lying in the road.
He had been hit by a Corvair. I went to his
side.
With a great effort, he struggled to a sitting
position and gasped: "I did it for the
revolution. Don't you understand that?"
I don't.

He stopped. "Russia, I guess. That's where
most of their weapons come from."
"Right. And who do you think
manufactures those knives in Russia?"
"Russian workers, I imagine."
"Right again," I continued. "And what do
those Russian workers have to eat in order to
keep manufacturing those knives?"
"Why, bread, of course," he replied.
"And where does bread come from?"
"Wheat," he said, and a look of horror
came into his eyes.
Wheat Cheat
"That's right," I screamed, "and the wheat
comes from the United States and it's grown
by great big rip-off corporations and those
corporations are all run by Republicans,
Stanley! Do you hear me? They're run by
Republicans//"
With a muffled, gurgling cry, Stanley
dropped the knife and ran out the door. A
moment later, there was a screech of brakes
and the sound of a tremendous impact.
I ran outside. Stanley was lying in the road.
He had been hit by a Corvair. I went to his
side.
With a great effort, he struggled to a sitting
position and gasped: "I did it for the
revolution. Don't you understand that?"
I don't.

It happened a few weeks ago. I had just
made myself a sandwich, around noontime,
when there was a knock on my door. I opened
it to find Stanley, a friend of mine from
freshman year. I hadn't seen him since then.
"Stanley! Come on in," I cried, shaking his
hand. "Can I fix you a sandwich?"
"Sure," he answered, "how about a . . . "
His voice trailed off. Staring intently at my
roast beef-on-rye, he asked, "Where did you
get that lettuce?"
"You mean, the lettuce in my sandwich? I
don't know, Safeway probably."
"Safeway!" he shouted. "Don't you know
what you're doing?"
"I'm eating a sandwich."
"No, no. When you buy lettuce at
Safeway, you are exploiting farmworkers."
"Yeah? Why's that?"
Sinking Safeway
"Because Safeway doesn't Sell United
Farmworker lettuce, that's why, and because
United Farmworkers are the only true
representatives of the people." And with that,
he ripped the lettuce out of my sandwich and
threw it into the sink.
"Look, Stan," I said, "let's not get too
carried away here. I mean, what difference
does it make . . . ."
"Coors beer!" he screamed. "You're
drinking Coors beer! Who do you think you
are drinking Coors beer?"
"Well," I stammered, "I'm—l'm just, you
know, I'm just a customer of the store, and I
just sort of.. .
"Unfair labor practices! Coors oppresses
people!" He opened my refrigerator door and
extracted the remaining bottles of beer,
smashing them one by one against the kitchen
floor.
I was becoming somewhat annoyed, but I
decided to change the subject. "So where have
vou been the last few vears, Stan?"

"Oh, I been all over. Berkeley, Delano,
Taos. I seen all kinds of things." I was relieved
to see that he had become much calmer.
"Hey, man," he said, "you really don't know
what's comin' down, do you? I mean about
the lettuce and the beer?"
"Well, no, I guess not," I answered,
"Maybe you can tell me."
Ripping Off
"Allright. Well, there's all kinds of
corporations in our society, see, that just exist
to rip off people, you know, and if people get
together and just decide, you know, not to
buy any more of their stuff, then, you know,
maybe people will stop getting ripped off.
Hey, what kind of toaster is that?"
"General Electric, I think."
"Well, see, GE is a war profiteer," he said
calmly, "and I don't think it's right for you to
kill Vietnamese with your toaster." And he
grabbed the toaster and hurled it against the
wall.
"Oh, no you don't," I yelled futilely, and
grabbed him by the arm. He struggled to get
away from me, and put his hand around the
collar of the sweater I was wearing. As he
pulled away, he managed to read the label:
"Australian Lamb's Wool."
Aborigines
"Australia!" he shrieked, "what about the
aborigines?" And he yanked the sweater off
and ripped it into two pieces in front of my
eyes.
"All right, Stanley, I said, "you've done
enough. I want you to leave, right now."
"Your pants," he answered. "Take off
your pants."
"Stan, what the hell's wrong with
you . ~
"Those are Farah slacks, aren't they? Take
'em off." He produced a long gleaming knife,
and advanced toward me with a purposeful
look in his eves.

Desperate, I tried to stall for time. "Hey,
Stan, where'd you get that keen knife?"
Army Knife
"It's a North Vietnamese army knife," he
answered with some pride as he came toward
me.
I had an idea. "Look, Stan," I said, "where
do you think the North Vietnamese got that
knife from?"
He stopped. "Russia, I guess. That's where
most of their weapons come from."
"Right. And who do you think
manufactures those knives in Russia?"

wall.
"Oh, no you don't," I yelled futilely, and
grabbed him by the arm. He struggled to get
away from me, and put his hand around the
collar of the sweater I was wearing. As he
pulled away, he managed to read the label:
"Australian Lamb's Wool."
Aborigines
"Australia!" he shrieked, "what about the
aborigines?" And he yanked the sweater off
and ripped it into two pieces in front of my
eyes.
"All right, Stanley, I said, "you've done
enough. I want you to leave, right now."
"Your pants," he answered. "Take off
your pants."
"Stan, what the hell's wrong with
you . ~
"Those are Farah slacks, aren't they? Take
'em off." He produced a long gleaming knife,
and advanced toward me with a purposeful
look in his eves.

Desperate, I tried to stall for time. "Hey,
Stan, where'd you get that keen knife?"
Army Knife
"It's a North Vietnamese army knife," he
answered with some pride as he came toward
me.
I had an idea. "Look, Stan," I said, "where
do you think the North Vietnamese got that
knife from?"
He stopped. "Russia, I guess. That's where
most of their weapons come from."
"Right. And who do you think
manufactures those knives in Russia?"
"Russian workers, I imagine."
"Right again," I continued. "And what do
those Russian workers have to eat in order to
keep manufacturing those knives?"
"Why, bread, of course," he replied.
"And where does bread come from?"
"Wheat," he said, and a look of horror
came into his eyes.
Wheat Cheat
"That's right," I screamed, "and the wheat
comes from the United States and it's grown
by great big rip-off corporations and those
corporations are all run by Republicans,
Stanley! Do you hear me? They're run by
Republicans//"
With a muffled, gurgling cry, Stanley
dropped the knife and ran out the door. A
moment later, there was a screech of brakes
and the sound of a tremendous impact.
I ran outside. Stanley was lying in the road.
He had been hit by a Corvair. I went to his
side.
With a great effort, he struggled to a sitting
position and gasped: "I did it for the
revolution. Don't you understand that?"
I don't.

It happened a few weeks ago. I had just
made myself a sandwich, around noontime,
when there was a knock on my door. I opened
it to find Stanley, a friend of mine from
freshman year. I hadn't seen him since then.
"Stanley! Come on in," I cried, shaking his
hand. "Can I fix you a sandwich?"
"Sure," he answered, "how about a . . . "
His voice trailed off. Staring intently at my
roast beef-on-rye, he asked, "Where did you
get that lettuce?"
"You mean, the lettuce in my sandwich? I
don't know, Safeway probably."
"Safeway!" he shouted. "Don't you know
what you're doing?"
"I'm eating a sandwich."
"No, no. When you buy lettuce at
Safeway, you are exploiting farmworkers."
"Yeah? Why's that?"
Sinking Safeway
"Because Safeway doesn't Sell United
Farmworker lettuce, that's why, and because
United Farmworkers are the only true
representatives of the people." And with that,
he ripped the lettuce out of my sandwich and
threw it into the sink.
"Look, Stan," I said, "let's not get too
carried away here. I mean, what difference
does it make . . . ."
"Coors beer!" he screamed. "You're
drinking Coors beer! Who do you think you
are drinking Coors beer?"
"Well," I stammered, "I'm—l'm just, you
know, I'm just a customer of the store, and I
just sort of.. .
"Unfair labor practices! Coors oppresses
people!" He opened my refrigerator door and
extracted the remaining bottles of beer,
smashing them one by one against the kitchen
floor.
I was becoming somewhat annoyed, but I
decided to change the subject. "So where have
vou been the last few vears, Stan?"

"Oh, I been all over. Berkeley, Delano,
Taos. I seen all kinds of things." I was relieved
to see that he had become much calmer.
"Hey, man," he said, "you really don't know
what's comin' down, do you? I mean about
the lettuce and the beer?"
"Well, no, I guess not," I answered,
"Maybe you can tell me."
Ripping Off
"Allright. Well, there's all kinds of
corporations in our society, see, that just exist
to rip off people, you know, and if people get
together and just decide, you know, not to
buy any more of their stuff, then, you know,
maybe people will stop getting ripped off.
Hey, what kind of toaster is that?"
"General Electric, I think."
"Well, see, GE is a war profiteer," he said
calmly, "and I don't think it's right for you to
kill Vietnamese with your toaster." And he
grabbed the toaster and hurled it against the
wall.
"Oh, no you don't," I yelled futilely, and
grabbed him by the arm. He struggled to get

collar of the sweater I was wearing. As he
