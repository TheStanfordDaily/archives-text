# fundamental issues avoided,
## Debate Panelists Lacked Honesty 
### 
gregory s. saunders

I feel compelled to make an
honest evaluation and
commentary on the events of
Tuesday night, Jan. 23, in
Memorial Auditorium, where
Profs. Shockley, Cavalli-Sforza, X
and McGee, under the auspices of
the Psychology Dept., sponsored
the community event of the year.
An honest evaluation is needed,
because there was such a patent
lack of honesty among the
panelists and they obviously
hadn't evaluated the impact that
their individual presentations
would have on the Stanford
community and the
world-at-large.
Prof. Shockley's presentation
was, predictably, one of the
recurrent attempts to use certain
data to show that blacks are
intellectually inferior to whites.
As such, it was not surprising that
the data were relatively coherent,
organized, and led one to ask
certain questions about the
mentality of "Negroes." And
Shockley was definitely in his
element in presenting and
interpreting these data, never

saying that he had conclusively
proven anything. But his work
suffered from the same defect
that so many "nice" theories do:
he never questioned his basic
assumptions.
For Shockley, it is sufficient
that IQ is a fairly accurate
predictor of social achievement in
American society; but,
unfortunately, American society
is founded on some built-in
inequities, and this prediction
based on IQ merely reflects the
fact of the isolation and
enslavement (some will prefer to
say merely "racial
discrimination"), past and
present, of the African in that
society.
Lrresistable Offer
Shockley went so far as to
make the black Stanford students
an "offer they couldn't refuse."
He called for an experiment to
compare the IQ's of Stanford
blacks (who supposedly have an
average of 40 percent "white
blood") to Stanford whites and to
other groups of blacks (with less
"white blood"), to conclusively

establish the Truth (with a capital
"T"): whether or not blacks are
inferior.
The reactions among the
audience were instructive;
laughter was the dominant
response among those opposed to
Shockley's position. Some
laughed to keep from crying,
others laughed to keep from
thinking. I suggest, as a member
of the group to whom Shockley
made his proposal, that laughter
will not be enough; we must use
our minds (fully confident that
they are not inferior) to defeat
this idea.
Perhaps in the face of such
intellectual arrogance and/or
myopia on Shockley's part, Profs.
X and McGee's presentation was
not surprising. As black men, they
must have felt (as I did) enraged
that white men who have
perpetrated so many evils on
people of African descent, would
continue to do so. They must
have felt (as I also did) angered at
the necessity, after suffering so
much, to prove to the oppressor
that we blacks are. not inferior,
and that he therefore had no
justification for the continued
enslavement of blacks. And thev
must have been indignant(as I was)
at the proposal of one asserting
that blacks are inferior, sitting in a
position of superior political
power, that, powerless and
oppressed, they commit
themselves into the hands of the
oppressor to discover whether or
not they are inferior. The
suggestion that such a proposition
be for blacks' own benefit, given
the present socio-political
configuration, is indeed ludicrous.
Irrelevant Remarks
But I found very little in X's or
McGee's presentation to really be
sufficient to withstand Shockley's
onslaught. Social policies can't be
made or defeated merely by
"selling woof tickets." As a black
man, I hesitate due to a positive
feeling of nationalism to criticize

my brothers. But I saw nothing
positive in a presentation based on
ad hominem attacks, scanty
definitions of "null hypotheses"
and "ordinal scales," and
irrelevant remarks as to the
cultural tendencies of Europeans
as a whole.
Their program did not get to
the fundamental roots of
Shockley's proposals on
dysgenics; if blacks are going to
have a say in determining their
own future, thev will need more
than threatening and mysterious
allusions to the fact that they
won't permit themselves to be
experimented on any longer. If we
don't use our minds and
articulately defeat such proposals,
what have we got to prevent it
from happening?
In summary, none of the
panelists really viewed their
opinions in perspective, with
regards to their impact on society.
In many ways, the idea that the
species Man can be improved
through social planning is ahead
of its time. While the concept is
laudable in abstract, we have
neither the knowledge as to what
really constitutes improvement
(or how to effectuate it), nor the
social harmony and freedom of all
groups to participate in the policy
making for it to be feasible today
(at least not in the manner
proposed by Shock ley).
Progress
As for Profs. X and McGee, we
blacks as a people have certainly
progressed beyond hysterical
reaction-ism as the only means of
preventing our further oppression.
We of course must be united in
opposing whatever threatens our
survival; but we must have leaders
who can critically evaluate and
analyze such programs, to
convince others of better
alternatives. No one can seriously
argue that the bases of racial
differences do not need to be
better understood.
But what I fear is that voices
like Shockley's will be the most
heard. Then, the charge made by
Prof. X against Prof.
Cavalli-Sforza, who opposed
Shockley on his technical
understanding of genetics, will be
true: that all white scientists are
basically the same, in allowing
detrimental experimentation to be
done on black people, with the
result of further and continued
enslavement of blacks in
particular, and Mankind in
general.

The reactions among the
audience were instructive;
laughter was the dominant
response among those opposed to
Shockley's position. Some
laughed to keep from crying,
others laughed to keep from
thinking. I suggest, as a member
of the group to whom Shockley
made his proposal, that laughter
will not be enough; we must use
our minds (fully confident that
they are not inferior) to defeat
this idea.
Perhaps in the face of such
intellectual arrogance and/or
myopia on Shockley's part, Profs.
X and McGee's presentation was
not surprising. As black men, they
must have felt (as I did) enraged
that white men who have
perpetrated so many evils on
people of African descent, would
continue to do so. They must
have felt (as I also did) angered at
the necessity, after suffering so
much, to prove to the oppressor
that we blacks are. not inferior,
and that he therefore had no
justification for the continued
enslavement of blacks. And thev
must have been indignant(as I was)
at the proposal of one asserting
that blacks are inferior, sitting in a
position of superior political
power, that, powerless and
oppressed, they commit
themselves into the hands of the
oppressor to discover whether or
not they are inferior. The
suggestion that such a proposition
be for blacks' own benefit, given
the present socio-political
configuration, is indeed ludicrous.
Irrelevant Remarks
But I found very little in X's or
McGee's presentation to really be
sufficient to withstand Shockley's
onslaught. Social policies can't be
made or defeated merely by
"selling woof tickets." As a black
man, I hesitate due to a positive
feeling of nationalism to criticize

my brothers. But I saw nothing
positive in a presentation based on
ad hominem attacks, scanty
definitions of "null hypotheses"
and "ordinal scales," and
irrelevant remarks as to the
cultural tendencies of Europeans
as a whole.
Their program did not get to
the fundamental roots of
Shockley's proposals on
dysgenics; if blacks are going to
have a say in determining their
own future, thev will need more
than threatening and mysterious
allusions to the fact that they
won't permit themselves to be
experimented on any longer. If we
don't use our minds and
articulately defeat such proposals,
what have we got to prevent it
from happening?
In summary, none of the
panelists really viewed their
opinions in perspective, with
regards to their impact on society.
In many ways, the idea that the
species Man can be improved
through social planning is ahead
of its time. While the concept is
laudable in abstract, we have
neither the knowledge as to what
really constitutes improvement
(or how to effectuate it), nor the
social harmony and freedom of all
groups to participate in the policy
making for it to be feasible today
(at least not in the manner
proposed by Shock ley).
Progress
As for Profs. X and McGee, we
blacks as a people have certainly
progressed beyond hysterical
reaction-ism as the only means of
preventing our further oppression.
We of course must be united in
opposing whatever threatens our
survival; but we must have leaders
who can critically evaluate and
analyze such programs, to
convince others of better
alternatives. No one can seriously
argue that the bases of racial
differences do not need to be
better understood.
But what I fear is that voices
like Shockley's will be the most
heard. Then, the charge made by
Prof. X against Prof.
Cavalli-Sforza, who opposed
Shockley on his technical
understanding of genetics, will be
true: that all white scientists are
basically the same, in allowing
detrimental experimentation to be
done on black people, with the
result of further and continued
enslavement of blacks in
particular, and Mankind in
general.

I feel compelled to make an
honest evaluation and
commentary on the events of
Tuesday night, Jan. 23, in
Memorial Auditorium, where
Profs. Shockley, Cavalli-Sforza, X
and McGee, under the auspices of
the Psychology Dept., sponsored
the community event of the year.
An honest evaluation is needed,
because there was such a patent
lack of honesty among the
panelists and they obviously
hadn't evaluated the impact that
their individual presentations
would have on the Stanford
community and the
world-at-large.
Prof. Shockley's presentation
was, predictably, one of the
recurrent attempts to use certain
data to show that blacks are
intellectually inferior to whites.
As such, it was not surprising that
the data were relatively coherent,
organized, and led one to ask
certain questions about the
mentality of "Negroes." And
Shockley was definitely in his
element in presenting and
interpreting these data, never

saying that he had conclusively
proven anything. But his work
suffered from the same defect
that so many "nice" theories do:
he never questioned his basic
assumptions.
For Shockley, it is sufficient
that IQ is a fairly accurate
predictor of social achievement in
American society; but,
unfortunately, American society
is founded on some built-in
inequities, and this prediction
based on IQ merely reflects the
fact of the isolation and
enslavement (some will prefer to
say merely "racial
discrimination"), past and
present, of the African in that
society.
Lrresistable Offer
Shockley went so far as to
make the black Stanford students
an "offer they couldn't refuse."
He called for an experiment to
compare the IQ's of Stanford
blacks (who supposedly have an
average of 40 percent "white
blood") to Stanford whites and to
other groups of blacks (with less
"white blood"), to conclusively

establish the Truth (with a capital
"T"): whether or not blacks are
inferior.
The reactions among the
audience were instructive;
laughter was the dominant
response among those opposed to
Shockley's position. Some

others laughed to keep from

Shockley's proposals on
dysgenics; if blacks are going to
have a say in determining their
own future, thev will need more
than threatening and mysterious
allusions to the fact that they
won't permit themselves to be
experimented on any longer. If we
don't use our minds and
articulately defeat such proposals,
what have we got to prevent it
from happening?
In summary, none of the
panelists really viewed their
opinions in perspective, with
regards to their impact on society.
In many ways, the idea that the
species Man can be improved
through social planning is ahead
of its time. While the concept is
laudable in abstract, we have
neither the knowledge as to what
really constitutes improvement
(or how to effectuate it), nor the
social harmony and freedom of all
groups to participate in the policy
making for it to be feasible today
(at least not in the manner
proposed by Shock ley).
Progress
As for Profs. X and McGee, we
blacks as a people have certainly
progressed beyond hysterical
reaction-ism as the only means of
preventing our further oppression.
We of course must be united in
opposing whatever threatens our
survival; but we must have leaders
who can critically evaluate and
analyze such programs, to
convince others of better
alternatives. No one can seriously
argue that the bases of racial
differences do not need to be
better understood.
But what I fear is that voices
like Shockley's will be the most
heard. Then, the charge made by
Prof. X against Prof.
Cavalli-Sforza, who opposed
Shockley on his technical
understanding of genetics, will be
true: that all white scientists are
basically the same, in allowing
detrimental experimentation to be
done on black people, with the
result of further and continued
enslavement of blacks in
particular, and Mankind in
general.

I feel compelled to make an
honest evaluation and
commentary on the events of
Tuesday night, Jan. 23, in
Memorial Auditorium, where
Profs. Shockley, Cavalli-Sforza, X
and McGee, under the auspices of
the Psychology Dept., sponsored
the community event of the year.
An honest evaluation is needed,
because there was such a patent
lack of honesty among the
panelists and they obviously
hadn't evaluated the impact that
their individual presentations
would have on the Stanford
community and the
world-at-large.
Prof. Shockley's presentation
was, predictably, one of the
recurrent attempts to use certain
data to show that blacks are
intellectually inferior to whites.
As such, it was not surprising that
the data were relatively coherent,
organized, and led one to ask
certain questions about the
mentality of "Negroes." And
Shockley was definitely in his
element in presenting and
interpreting these data, never

saying that he had conclusively
proven anything. But his work
suffered from the same defect
that so many "nice" theories do:
he never questioned his basic
assumptions.
For Shockley, it is sufficient
that IQ is a fairly accurate
predictor of social achievement in
American society; but,
unfortunately, American society
is founded on some built-in
inequities, and this prediction
based on IQ merely reflects the
fact of the isolation and
enslavement (some will prefer to
say merely "racial
discrimination"), past and
present, of the African in that
society.
Lrresistable Offer
Shockley went so far as to
make the black Stanford students
an "offer they couldn't refuse."
He called for an experiment to
compare the IQ's of Stanford
blacks (who supposedly have an
average of 40 percent "white
blood") to Stanford whites and to
other groups of blacks (with less
"white blood"), to conclusively

establish the Truth (with a capital
"T"): whether or not blacks are
inferior.
The reactions among the
audience were instructive;
laughter was the dominant
response among those opposed to
Shockley's position. Some
laughed to keep from crying,
others laughed to keep from
thinking. I suggest, as a member
of the group to whom Shockley
made his proposal, that laughter
will not be enough; we must use
our minds (fully confident that
they are not inferior) to defeat
this idea.
Perhaps in the face of such
intellectual arrogance and/or
myopia on Shockley's part, Profs.
X and McGee's presentation was
not surprising. As black men, they
must have felt (as I did) enraged
that white men who have
perpetrated so many evils on
people of African descent, would
continue to do so. They must
have felt (as I also did) angered at
the necessity, after suffering so
much, to prove to the oppressor
that we blacks are. not inferior,
and that he therefore had no
justification for the continued
enslavement of blacks. And thev
must have been indignant(as I was)
at the proposal of one asserting
that blacks are inferior, sitting in a
position of superior political
power, that, powerless and
oppressed, they commit
themselves into the hands of the
oppressor to discover whether or
not they are inferior. The
suggestion that such a proposition
be for blacks' own benefit, given
the present socio-political
configuration, is indeed ludicrous.
Irrelevant Remarks
But I found very little in X's or
McGee's presentation to really be
sufficient to withstand Shockley's
onslaught. Social policies can't be
made or defeated merely by
"selling woof tickets." As a black
man, I hesitate due to a positive
feeling of nationalism to criticize

my brothers. But I saw nothing
positive in a presentation based on
ad hominem attacks, scanty
definitions of "null hypotheses"
and "ordinal scales," and
irrelevant remarks as to the
cultural tendencies of Europeans
as a whole.
Their program did not get to
the fundamental roots of
Shockley's proposals on
dysgenics; if blacks are going to
