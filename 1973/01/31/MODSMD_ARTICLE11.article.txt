## 'End Compulsory Service' 
### 
sa five 'daily' staffers

Several members of the Daily staff are
dissatisfied with the Daily editorial opinion (Jan. 30)
on the draft, amnesty, and compulsory
"alternative" service.
This society is composed of free individuals
whose ultimate allegiance is not to the government.
The draft is an imposed obligation which becomes,
in essence, a form of chattel slavery. It prevents free
men from following their own consciences, makes
them the tools of others, and can make them a
party to criminal activities occuring as a part of war.
If one finds the draft acceptable, the logical
consequence is that if the government declares that
it will dictate how all labor services in this society
are to be performed (in other words, institutes
universal slavery), then that person can only step
right into line.
First recognizing the immorality of the draft
provides the only sensible context in which amnesty
can be understood. If the draft is not acceptable, it
then follows that complete and total amnesty
should follow as a matter of course. Demanding
alternative service implies that the principle of the
draft was right all along.
It is important that the United States return to
the spirit of volunteerism upon which it was
founded. Compensating all victims of the draft
would be one way to begin reinstating this principle.

The much-heralded end of the draft
unfortunately does not include the dismantling of
the entire selective service bureaucracy. Registration
will still be required for all 18-year-old males, the
lottery system will continue, as will classification of
all potential inductees.
Rather than the apparatus remaining, at the very
least, a full debate in Congress should proceed any
consideration of reinstituting the selective service
apparatus.
The "crime" of desertion is in fact a victimless
crime. The man who decides to leave is not
aggressing against the person or property of anyone
when he quits work.
Why should he continue to labor in bondage at a
job he finds unconscionable? We find the very idea
of review boards to judge the motivations of those
"absent without leave" an attack upon the heroism
of those who chose to quit killing the innocent.
As Sen. Barry Goldwater noted in 1967, 'The
most fundamental right of man is the right to his
life. The use of force against that right—as in the
draft—is clearly wrong. It would be wrong to assume
that free men must be forced to fight for their
country."

and Doyle McManus arc members of the Daily
staff.)
