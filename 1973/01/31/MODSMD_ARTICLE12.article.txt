'Inconsistent Bullshit'
Editor:
The Daily editorial in
yesterday's paper recommending
only conditional amnesty for
draft evaders is one of the most
inconsistent pieces of bullshit I've
ever seen.
After opposing the war for as
long as the Daily has, how can it
have the nerve to condemn total
amnesty for those who, for
whatever reason, chose not to
participate in what the Daily has
continually called an immoral
war?
It seems to me that anything
contributing to an immoral war is
itself immoral, and that resisters
and deserters who refused to
contribute to that immorality
should be applauded rather than
rebuked.
Second, the Daily claims to
oppose the forced service required
by the draft, yet contends that
those draft resisters and deserters
who left for moral reasons should
have "no qualms about giving two
years of their lives" to social
causes.
Dammit, people should have

qualms about being forced to give
part of their lives to any cause.
How the Daily can claim to
oppose the draft "in any form"
and then require two years of
involuntary social service for draft
resisters and deserters is beyond
me. The editorial says it opposes
involuntary conscription and then
proceeds to recommend
involuntary conscription for all
those resisters who opposed
involuntary conscription!
Finally, the editorial takes the
attitude—both with resisters and
deserters—that those who rebelled
for moral reasons should be
punished by involuntary servitude
in order to prevent those who
rebelled for "selfish reasons" from
escaping. Punishing the innocent
to "get" the guilty is a total
inversion of justice, even if you
believe that those who resisted
and deserted for "selfish reasons"
are guilty, which I do not.
I agree in substance with the
column elsewhere on this page
entitled "End Compulsory
Service" which also attacks the
editorial, but I don't feel it really
goes to the heart of the Daily's
remarkable inconsistency.

David Cole, in his column,
"Profit At Human Expense"
(Daily, Jan. 26), is only trying to
make a few basic points, though
the size of his column might not
indicate this. First, he wants to
emphasize that the people at
McDonald's want to make money.
Well, he's damned right. He then
argues that the libertarian concept
of "ten workers at $1.00 is better
than ten workers at $1.60" is
wrong because it could be
extended to "32 workers at 50
cents an hour."
Any person who is stupid
enough to work for McDonalds at
50 cents an hour deserves such a
fate, for he can easily go down the
block to the Jack-In-The-Box and
get paid more. And what if
Jack-In-The-Box were to lower ite
wages to 50 cents an hour along
with McDonald's? Clearly, their
profits would be too high, and
they would be inviting outside
competition—if competition were
allowed by the almighty state.
But what if the state were to
decide that McDonald's and
Jack-In-The-Box should both pay
a minimum wage? Since both
companies operate on a low profit
in order to discourage outside
competition, they would have to
raise the prices of their products.
And what group of people buys
McDonald's products more than
anyone else? The "workers," who
don't make enough money to eat
at the restaurant where David
Cole's parents probably eat.
If McDonald's wants to lower
wages enough so that it will still
get employees in order to face the
rise in "raw material prices,"
David Cole should be glad or
indifferent, because McDonald's is
only doing this to keep prices
down, to thus satisfy "the
masses."
David Cole is against
McDonald's because, to quote
another observer, it is a
"rallying-point for the cheap, the
plastic, the tawdry: in short, the
bourgeois ideal." I'm truly sorry
that he looks down at all of those
people (of which I am one) who
have bought nine billion cheap
hamburgers (or is it ten?). I am
sorry that it affronts his "delicate
sensibilities," as he so aptly put it,
but my tastes, as well as those of
millions of the "proletariat,"
happen to be less sophisticated
than Mr. Cole's. What right does
he have to impose his tastes on all
of us? Why not let the "people"
decide, when they go out to eat,
whether McDonald's is their kind
of place?

companies operate on a low profit
in order to discourage outside
competition, they would have to
raise the prices of their products.
And what group of people buys
McDonald's products more than
anyone else? The "workers," who
don't make enough money to eat
at the restaurant where David
Cole's parents probably eat.
If McDonald's wants to lower
wages enough so that it will still
get employees in order to face the
rise in "raw material prices,"
David Cole should be glad or
indifferent, because McDonald's is
only doing this to keep prices
down, to thus satisfy "the
masses."
David Cole is against
McDonald's because, to quote
another observer, it is a
"rallying-point for the cheap, the
plastic, the tawdry: in short, the
bourgeois ideal." I'm truly sorry
that he looks down at all of those
people (of which I am one) who
have bought nine billion cheap
hamburgers (or is it ten?). I am
sorry that it affronts his "delicate
sensibilities," as he so aptly put it,
but my tastes, as well as those of
millions of the "proletariat,"
happen to be less sophisticated
than Mr. Cole's. What right does
he have to impose his tastes on all
of us? Why not let the "people"
decide, when they go out to eat,
whether McDonald's is their kind
of place?

Editor:
The Daily editorial in
yesterday's paper recommending
only conditional amnesty for
draft evaders is one of the most
inconsistent pieces of bullshit I've
ever seen.
After opposing the war for as
long as the Daily has, how can it
have the nerve to condemn total
amnesty for those who, for
whatever reason, chose not to
participate in what the Daily has
continually called an immoral
war?
It seems to me that anything
contributing to an immoral war is
itself immoral, and that resisters
and deserters who refused to
contribute to that immorality
should be applauded rather than
rebuked.
Second, the Daily claims to
oppose the forced service required
by the draft, yet contends that
those draft resisters and deserters
who left for moral reasons should
have "no qualms about giving two
years of their lives" to social
causes.
Dammit, people should have

qualms about being forced to give
part of their lives to any cause.
How the Daily can claim to
oppose the draft "in any form"
and then require two years of
involuntary social service for draft
resisters and deserters is beyond
me. The editorial says it opposes
involuntary conscription and then
proceeds to recommend
involuntary conscription for all
those resisters who opposed
involuntary conscription!
Finally, the editorial takes the
attitude—both with resisters and
deserters—that those who rebelled
for moral reasons should be
punished by involuntary servitude
in order to prevent those who
rebelled for "selfish reasons" from
escaping. Punishing the innocent
to "get" the guilty is a total
inversion of justice, even if you
believe that those who resisted
and deserted for "selfish reasons"
are guilty, which I do not.
I agree in substance with the
column elsewhere on this page
entitled "End Compulsory
Service" which also attacks the
editorial, but I don't feel it really
goes to the heart of the Daily's
remarkable inconsistency.

David Cole, in his column,
"Profit At Human Expense"
(Daily, Jan. 26), is only trying to
make a few basic points, though
the size of his column might not
indicate this. First, he wants to
emphasize that the people at
McDonald's want to make money.
Well, he's damned right. He then
argues that the libertarian concept
of "ten workers at $1.00 is better
than ten workers at $1.60" is
wrong because it could be
extended to "32 workers at 50
cents an hour."
Any person who is stupid
enough to work for McDonalds at
50 cents an hour deserves such a
fate, for he can easily go down the
block to the Jack-In-The-Box and
get paid more. And what if
Jack-In-The-Box were to lower ite
wages to 50 cents an hour along
with McDonald's? Clearly, their
profits would be too high, and
they would be inviting outside
competition—if competition were
allowed by the almighty state.
But what if the state were to
decide that McDonald's and
Jack-In-The-Box should both pay
a minimum wage? Since both
companies operate on a low profit
in order to discourage outside
competition, they would have to

entitled "End Compulsory
Service" which also attacks the
editorial, but I don't feel it really
goes to the heart of the Daily's
remarkable inconsistency.

McDonald's Defended
Editor:
David Cole, in his column,
"Profit At Human Expense"
(Daily, Jan. 26), is only trying to
make a few basic points, though
the size of his column might not
indicate this. First, he wants to
emphasize that the people at
McDonald's want to make money.
Well, he's damned right. He then
argues that the libertarian concept
of "ten workers at $1.00 is better
than ten workers at $1.60" is
wrong because it could be
extended to "32 workers at 50
cents an hour."
Any person who is stupid
enough to work for McDonalds at
50 cents an hour deserves such a
fate, for he can easily go down the
block to the Jack-In-The-Box and
get paid more. And what if
Jack-In-The-Box were to lower ite
wages to 50 cents an hour along
with McDonald's? Clearly, their
profits would be too high, and
they would be inviting outside
competition—if competition were
allowed by the almighty state.
But what if the state were to
decide that McDonald's and
Jack-In-The-Box should both pay
a minimum wage? Since both
companies operate on a low profit
in order to discourage outside
competition, they would have to
raise the prices of their products.
And what group of people buys
McDonald's products more than
anyone else? The "workers," who
don't make enough money to eat
at the restaurant where David
Cole's parents probably eat.
If McDonald's wants to lower
wages enough so that it will still
get employees in order to face the
rise in "raw material prices,"
David Cole should be glad or
indifferent, because McDonald's is
only doing this to keep prices
down, to thus satisfy "the
masses."
David Cole is against
McDonald's because, to quote
another observer, it is a
"rallying-point for the cheap, the
plastic, the tawdry: in short, the
bourgeois ideal." I'm truly sorry
that he looks down at all of those
people (of which I am one) who
have bought nine billion cheap
hamburgers (or is it ten?). I am
sorry that it affronts his "delicate
sensibilities," as he so aptly put it,
but my tastes, as well as those of
millions of the "proletariat,"
happen to be less sophisticated
than Mr. Cole's. What right does
he have to impose his tastes on all
of us? Why not let the "people"
decide, when they go out to eat,
whether McDonald's is their kind
of place?
