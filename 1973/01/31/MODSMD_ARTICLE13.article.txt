## Roy Bean And Butch Newman Relives Role 
### 
"The Life and Times of Judge
Roy Bean" is a movie that doesn't
know whether to take itself
seriously or not. The film depicts
a romantically stylized West even
as it parodies that form and
mocks its own parody. These
tones vie for supremacy
throughout, and make the film tilt
rather gracelessly among them.
The story sounds simple
enough. Bank robber Roy Bean
walks out of the desert into a tiny
Texas town west of the Pecos
River. The local inhabitants,
designated succinctly as "bad
men," try to kill him. He kills
them instead, and sets himself up
as Judge Roy Bean, the only law
west of the Pecos.
With a law book and a
collection of rag-tailed deputies,
Bean dispenses justice at the end
of a rope and meets up with
quaint old figures from Western
fantasy, all somewhat arbitrarily.
"Maybe this wasn't the way it
was," says screenwriter John
Milius. "It's the way it should
have been."
Milius' revised version of the
West combines seedy cynicism
with thoroughgoing
sentimentality. It isn't a happy
combination, and director John
Huston doesn't make the best of
it. He has directed with an
abandon that points up the
uneveness of the script.
Milius also co-authored the
screenplay for "Jeremiah
Johnson," the mythicized story of
a mountain man in early
nineteenth century America. That
script has fallen prey to some of
the same problems that plague
"Judge Roy Bean"-a discrepancy
between style and meaning and a
failure to formulate a definite
attitude toward his material.
Sidney Pollack directed
"Johnson" with an even,
soft-tempered hand, thus blending
textures; in contrast, Huston rubs
them abrasively in "Judge Roy
Bean."
"Jeremiah Johnson" starts out
with a better script. Its characters
fit to each other closely, filling in
the spaces between episodes.
"Judge Roy Bean" never rises to
more than a conglomeration of
characters pairing off for an

anecdote or two and regrouping
for a final holocaust to end the
film.
Some of the anecdotes are
amusing, and some of them quite
touching. As Roy Bean, Paul
Newman does provide nice
moments as he sings "Yellow
Rose of Texas" to his sweetheart,
Maria Elena (played with some
dash but no sparkle by Victoria
Principal), or absorbs himself in
the fine art of a poker game.
Newman acts well and uses his
predictable part quite adroitly,
but he can't do much to make
Bean an exciting or imaginative
character.
Much of the time, he plays
straight man for assorted cameos
doled out to Anthony Perkins,
Stacy Keach and Huston himself,
among others. All over-act with
gusto, creating some rousing and
funny bits. But the humor lies
more in the fact that the three
actors know the audience knows
that they're part of a great joke
than in the scenes themselves.
Newman acts his part with less
obvious self-awareness than
anyone else in the film. His judge
is a man with principles as well as
a good sense of expediency; he
can own and run not only the
court but the town saloon.
Without batting an eyelash he says
things like: "Ordinarily I'd take
you in my court, try you and
hang you; but if you got money
for whiskey I guess we can
dispense with those proceedings."
He isn't exactly all heart
although he is entirely
sympathetic throughout, and even
idealized at the end.
Jeremiah Johnson is a slightly
more romantic version of Bean.
Johnson is the strong, taciturn
innocent; Bean is a tower of
strength for a righteous cause, but
otherwise a talkative, pragmatic
individual. Both are defined by a
quality of artlessness.
Robert Redford, who plays
Jeremiah Johnson, may possibly
not have Newman's scope or
facility, but roles like Jeremiah
and Bean call for similar types,

and Newman and Redford
intersect at just this point. That is
why they were so well-matched in
"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance
Kid." In fact, in "Judge Roy
Bean" and "Jeremiah Johnson,"
Newman and Redford essentially
re-do their parts from the earlier
film.
The difference is that Milius'
heroes can take care of themselves
better. Yet the disturbing thing
about both his lead characters is
that they are so eminently
likeable that one tends to forget
that Bean and Jeremiah are also
better and more ruthless killers
than anyone else in either of the
films. But this is hardly a novelty
in American movies.
One of the best things about
"Judge Roy Bean" is Maurice
Jarre's music. It catches the flavor
of the surrounding landscape well
and with poignancy. It's strong,
romantic, and, particularly during
the last battle, quite stirring.
His score cues all the right
emotions, yet it often seems to be
working for the wrong movie.
Jarre seems to know exactly what
he wanted to do with "Judge Roy
Bean." Perhaps it is because he
was the only one who did have a
clear view of the movie that his
score is sometimes at odds with
the rest of "Judge Roy Bean."

NEW EXHIBIT — Richard Randell employs only two simple shapes in his exhibit at the Stanford Gallery,

"The Life and Times of Judge
Roy Bean" is a movie that doesn't
know whether to take itself
seriously or not. The film depicts
a romantically stylized West even
as it parodies that form and
mocks its own parody. These
tones vie for supremacy
throughout, and make the film tilt
rather gracelessly among them.
The story sounds simple
enough. Bank robber Roy Bean
walks out of the desert into a tiny
Texas town west of the Pecos
River. The local inhabitants,
designated succinctly as "bad
men," try to kill him. He kills
them instead, and sets himself up
as Judge Roy Bean, the only law
west of the Pecos.
With a law book and a
collection of rag-tailed deputies,
Bean dispenses justice at the end
of a rope and meets up with
quaint old figures from Western
fantasy, all somewhat arbitrarily.
"Maybe this wasn't the way it
was," says screenwriter John
Milius. "It's the way it should
have been."
Milius' revised version of the
West combines seedy cynicism
with thoroughgoing
sentimentality. It isn't a happy
combination, and director John
Huston doesn't make the best of
it. He has directed with an
abandon that points up the
uneveness of the script.
Milius also co-authored the
screenplay for "Jeremiah
Johnson," the mythicized story of
a mountain man in early
nineteenth century America. That
script has fallen prey to some of
the same problems that plague
"Judge Roy Bean"-a discrepancy
between style and meaning and a
failure to formulate a definite
attitude toward his material.
Sidney Pollack directed
"Johnson" with an even,
soft-tempered hand, thus blending
textures; in contrast, Huston rubs
them abrasively in "Judge Roy
Bean."
"Jeremiah Johnson" starts out
with a better script. Its characters
fit to each other closely, filling in
the spaces between episodes.
"Judge Roy Bean" never rises to
more than a conglomeration of
characters pairing off for an

anecdote or two and regrouping
for a final holocaust to end the
film.
Some of the anecdotes are
amusing, and some of them quite
touching. As Roy Bean, Paul
Newman does provide nice
moments as he sings "Yellow
Rose of Texas" to his sweetheart,
Maria Elena (played with some
dash but no sparkle by Victoria
Principal), or absorbs himself in
the fine art of a poker game.
Newman acts well and uses his
predictable part quite adroitly,
but he can't do much to make
Bean an exciting or imaginative
character.
Much of the time, he plays
straight man for assorted cameos
doled out to Anthony Perkins,
Stacy Keach and Huston himself,
among others. All over-act with
gusto, creating some rousing and
funny bits. But the humor lies
more in the fact that the three
actors know the audience knows
that they're part of a great joke
than in the scenes themselves.
Newman acts his part with less
obvious self-awareness than
anyone else in the film. His judge
is a man with principles as well as
a good sense of expediency; he
can own and run not only the
court but the town saloon.
Without batting an eyelash he says
things like: "Ordinarily I'd take
you in my court, try you and
hang you; but if you got money
for whiskey I guess we can
dispense with those proceedings."
He isn't exactly all heart
although he is entirely
sympathetic throughout, and even
idealized at the end.
Jeremiah Johnson is a slightly
more romantic version of Bean.
Johnson is the strong, taciturn
innocent; Bean is a tower of
strength for a righteous cause, but
otherwise a talkative, pragmatic
individual. Both are defined by a
quality of artlessness.
Robert Redford, who plays
Jeremiah Johnson, may possibly
not have Newman's scope or
facility, but roles like Jeremiah
and Bean call for similar types,

Principal), or absorbs himself in
the fine art of a poker game.
Newman acts well and uses his
predictable part quite adroitly,
but he can't do much to make
Bean an exciting or imaginative
character.
Much of the time, he plays
straight man for assorted cameos
doled out to Anthony Perkins,
Stacy Keach and Huston himself,
among others. All over-act with
gusto, creating some rousing and
funny bits. But the humor lies
more in the fact that the three
actors know the audience knows
that they're part of a great joke
than in the scenes themselves.
Newman acts his part with less
obvious self-awareness than
anyone else in the film. His judge
is a man with principles as well as
a good sense of expediency; he
can own and run not only the
court but the town saloon.
Without batting an eyelash he says
things like: "Ordinarily I'd take
you in my court, try you and
hang you; but if you got money
for whiskey I guess we can
dispense with those proceedings."
He isn't exactly all heart
although he is entirely
sympathetic throughout, and even
idealized at the end.
Jeremiah Johnson is a slightly
more romantic version of Bean.
Johnson is the strong, taciturn
innocent; Bean is a tower of
strength for a righteous cause, but
otherwise a talkative, pragmatic
individual. Both are defined by a
quality of artlessness.
Robert Redford, who plays
Jeremiah Johnson, may possibly
not have Newman's scope or
facility, but roles like Jeremiah
and Bean call for similar types,

and Newman and Redford
intersect at just this point. That is
why they were so well-matched in
"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance
Kid." In fact, in "Judge Roy
Bean" and "Jeremiah Johnson,"
Newman and Redford essentially
re-do their parts from the earlier
film.
The difference is that Milius'
heroes can take care of themselves
better. Yet the disturbing thing
about both his lead characters is
that they are so eminently
likeable that one tends to forget
that Bean and Jeremiah are also
better and more ruthless killers
than anyone else in either of the
films. But this is hardly a novelty
in American movies.
One of the best things about
"Judge Roy Bean" is Maurice
Jarre's music. It catches the flavor
of the surrounding landscape well
and with poignancy. It's strong,
romantic, and, particularly during
the last battle, quite stirring.
His score cues all the right
emotions, yet it often seems to be
working for the wrong movie.
Jarre seems to know exactly what
he wanted to do with "Judge Roy
Bean." Perhaps it is because he
was the only one who did have a
clear view of the movie that his
score is sometimes at odds with
the rest of "Judge Roy Bean."

NEW EXHIBIT — Richard Randell employs only two simple shapes in his exhibit at the Stanford Gallery,
which is situated directly across from History Corner. Hours are from 10 to 5 Tuesday through Friday and
from 1 to 5 on Saturday and Sunday. The Gallery is closed on Monday. See the story on the right to learn
more about the show.
"The Life and Times of Judge
Roy Bean" is a movie that doesn't
know whether to take itself
seriously or not. The film depicts
a romantically stylized West even
as it parodies that form and
mocks its own parody. These
tones vie for supremacy
throughout, and make the film tilt
rather gracelessly among them.
The story sounds simple
enough. Bank robber Roy Bean
walks out of the desert into a tiny
Texas town west of the Pecos
River. The local inhabitants,
designated succinctly as "bad
men," try to kill him. He kills
them instead, and sets himself up
as Judge Roy Bean, the only law
west of the Pecos.
With a law book and a
collection of rag-tailed deputies,
Bean dispenses justice at the end
of a rope and meets up with
quaint old figures from Western
fantasy, all somewhat arbitrarily.
"Maybe this wasn't the way it
was," says screenwriter John
Milius. "It's the way it should
have been."
Milius' revised version of the
West combines seedy cynicism
with thoroughgoing
sentimentality. It isn't a happy
combination, and director John
Huston doesn't make the best of
it. He has directed with an
abandon that points up the
uneveness of the script.
Milius also co-authored the
screenplay for "Jeremiah
Johnson," the mythicized story of
a mountain man in early
nineteenth century America. That
script has fallen prey to some of
the same problems that plague
"Judge Roy Bean"-a discrepancy
between style and meaning and a
failure to formulate a definite
attitude toward his material.
Sidney Pollack directed
"Johnson" with an even,
soft-tempered hand, thus blending
textures; in contrast, Huston rubs
them abrasively in "Judge Roy
Bean."
"Jeremiah Johnson" starts out
with a better script. Its characters
fit to each other closely, filling in
the spaces between episodes.
"Judge Roy Bean" never rises to
more than a conglomeration of
characters pairing off for an

anecdote or two and regrouping
for a final holocaust to end the
film.
Some of the anecdotes are
amusing, and some of them quite
touching. As Roy Bean, Paul
Newman does provide nice
moments as he sings "Yellow
Rose of Texas" to his sweetheart,
Maria Elena (played with some
dash but no sparkle by Victoria
Principal), or absorbs himself in
the fine art of a poker game.
