# Art Exhibit Marks End & Beginning
## 
### JOHN LOOMIS 
"1 have never dwelled on anything when I
could see its end," says Richard Randell on
how he approaches sculpture. Randell
explores an area, experiments with all its
possibilities and, when he has reached a
solution, he moves on to explore and
experiment with something else.
The exhibition of his sculpture at the
Stanford Gallery reflects an interest in change
and experiment. On walking into the main
room of the gallery one is immediately hit
with a violent juxtaposition of two very
different works. One is plastic — a smooth
rainbow-like form — subtle in coloration, and
highly finished. The other is a sharp, angular
'M'-shape of black stone, raw and unfinished.
The cast polyester resin works cover close
to two years of work in this medium and form
a grand finale to these experiments. The stone
pieces mark the beginning of a new series of
experiments in the assembling of stone slabs
into temporary constructions.
The most abundant works are those of cast
resin. They exist in two basic forms, an air
foil-like slab and variations on the rainbow
arch form. The reason for this formal
repetition is so that the viewer will not
become involved as much in the form itself as
in the subtle blend and change of color and
density of the piece.

Randell considers the shapes
"natural-nonreferential." Says he, "1 prefer to
repeat the same shape many times in an
exhibition in order to mute the 'uniqueness'
and de-emphasize shape particulars."
In his experimenting with casting polyester
resin, Randell found that the gentle fusing of
color was the most successful way to take
advantage of his medium. In commenting
frankly on an unsuccessful piece using very
bright colors instead of soft colors, he explains,
"I tried to do those real smasho decorative
ones but they were a real disaster."
Randell's use of the air foil form in some
of the resin pieces has interesting origins. In
his early works in the sixties he made use of
forms found in World War 1 airplanes. He also
is an avid airplane and glider pilot.
Furthermore, right now Randell is building a
wind tunnel in order to work on and perfect
the design of glider wings.
Quality And Refinement
To make a good polyester resin cast
requires a lot of time, patience, and muscle
work. The amount of sanding it takes to give
the casting a clear surface is tremendous.
These pieces have the same quality, precision,
and refinement found in his previous works
though they are very diverse in other respects.
It is in a mild reaction to himself and this
very "finished" quality that Randell has made

the two stone constructions. They are, in his
own words, "direct, unpretentious,
unstructured." They mark a beginning and a
source for new exploration.
He already has ideas: "When we were
setting up the show we realized the need for
two by fours underneath the stones because
they could not have stood up on the slippery
floor. 1 saw that, next time, I would like to do
much more in the way of substructure like
bolt a wooden structure together like this
[making an angle with his hands] and then
laying the stone on top. That way 1 also don't
have to drill holes into stone that doesn't
belong to me."
Temporary Construction
The marble is on loan so the sculpture is a
temporary construction. Randell has left plans
for erecting more of these stone slab
sculptures in abeyance. "I like the idea of
working out things," he says, "but I don't
always know if I want to do them."
Still, if they do not happen, Richard
Randell's mind will remain a rich source of
changing ideas and projects which will emerge,
if we can judge from the past, in many forms.
The Stanford Art Gallery is located across
from History Corner. The hours are 10-5
Tuesday through Friday and 1-5 Saturday and
Sunday. The Gallery is closed Monday. The
exhibit will last until March 4.
