# Traffic Brings Down House
## 
### 
In recent years, the once
clear-cut distinction between
"jazz" and "rock and roll" has
blurred almost to the point of
obscurity, as a result of a creative
explosion on both sides of the
mythical dividing line.
Jazz stalwarts like Cannonball
Adderley, the Crusaders, Don Ellis
and many others have widened
horizons by including a number of
numbers with a beat worthy of
any rock band; rock bands like
The Grateful Dead, the Allman
Brothers, and the Rolling Stones
have concurrently added to the
rock idiom by stressing the art of
improvisation against a rock and
roll rhythm.
The result of this evolution has
been "rock-'n'-jazz" utilizing rock
beat to mesmerize and
improvisation to amaze. Traffic is
one such group; in the space of its
last two albums, the group has
transcended its rock origins and
become one of the finest
"rock-'n'-jazz bands anywhere.
Un-Acoustic Guitar
The show last Thursday at
Winterland opened with John
Martyn, a solo acoustic guitarist.
Using a variety of electronic
devices Martyn made his guitar
sound distinctly un-acoustic. His
reliance on electronic
embellishment proved his
undoing; equipment failure
robbed him of his accompaniment
in the midst of a number of songs.
Like any
number of lesser groups, Free
specializes in "heavy" music —
heavy on the bass and organ, that
is. The resulting performance

often seemed like a two-man
show; it also was incredibly
boring.
Three Remain
Traffic more than atoned for
the shortcomings of the early sets.
Having undergone numerous
changes since the days with Dave
Mason and Spencer Davis, Traffic
is led by the three remaining
originals: Steve Winwood plays
guitar, piano and performs a
majority of the vocals; Chris
Wood stays on the flute and
saxophone; Jim Capaldi, formerly
the group's drummer, plays the
tambourine with fury ard sings, a
bit too infrequently considering
that he stopped drumming so that
the group could benefit from his
excellent voice.
"Reebop" Kwaku Baah, who
joined the group for the live
"Canteen" album, played a
variety of percussion instruments
with an unusual and mesmerizing
feeling for rhythm. Bassist David
Hood has replaced Rick Grech,
while Roger Hawkins has taken
over for Jim Gordon on drums.
Also joining Traffic was an
unidentified organist, a fine
musician whose presence was
undoubtedly necessary to play
parts which were done entirely by
Winwood and double tracked on
the albums.
The occasion for Traffic's tour
is a new album, entitled
"Shootout at the Fantasy
Factory." Their set opened, as
does the album, with the title
song featuring a driving bass line
produced by Hood and Chris
Wood on electric alto sax, and a

very jazzy lead by Winwood on
guitar.
They followed with "Rock and
Roll Stew" from their previous
album, "Low Spark of High
Heeled Boys," the album which
first offered the distinctly
jazz-influenced sound. Following
a pattern that was a bit too
obvious, Traffic delivered the
second song from the new album,
"Roll Right Stones."
Winwood later traded his guitar
for piano and delivered one of the
high points of the evening.
Beginning with "Glad" from
"John Barleycorn," Winwood
played magnificently. During the
bridge connecting "Glad" to
"Freedom Rider," Winwood
produced a superb impressionistic
but jazzy piano solo.
Capaldi Sings
After "40,000 Headmen,"
Chris Wood was featured in his
first instrumental, "Traffic
Magic," a song about alcohol. The
set ended with "Light Up or
Leave Me Alone," a simply

worded but subtlely played
number that finally exposed
Capaldi's singing (and writing)
talents, and "(sometimes I feel so)
Uninspired," featuring very
jazz-oriented solos by Winwood
on guitar and Wood on sax.
The audience demanded an
encore and received a fine
rendition of "Low Spark of High
Heeled Boys," the album's title
song. After ten minutes of
raucous howling and stamping the
audience convinced Traffic to
play another encore — an unusual
feat of enthusiasm for a band on
the road.
They responded with "Many a
Mile to Freedom" and "Dear Mr.
Fantasy," an old song which, like
a poet discoursing on his art,
summed up Traffic's efforts for a
good portion of their careers:
"Dear Mister Fantasy, play us a
tune,
something to make us all
happy."
