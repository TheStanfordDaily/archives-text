One of the reasons that cyclists have not
used the bicycle path on the Blackweldcr side
of Escondido Road in the past is that from
September to December enormous thorns
from the weeds alongside the jxith get on the
path and cause punctures. Would it be
possible for the plant department to remove
the weeds and sow a hardy grass instead?
G.H.B.
Both Perry Hackett, Roads & Grounds
Superintendent, and Terry McGovern, head of
the maintenance department of Escondido
Village, are aware of the problem and are
taking steps to eradicate the "puncture vine,
as it is commonly known.
McGovern said that early in the school year
the area along Escondido Road up to Campus
Drive was sprayed to destroy the weed. Then
the roots were dug up and all visible thorns,
leaves and branches were swept up and
removed. In November a "search-and-destroy "
was carried out for secondary growth.
Another check is planned for the spring to
make sure that the weeds have been

eradicated.
McGovern said that seeding the area with
grass is not feasible because there is no
irrigation system. What is growing there now
is "native vegetation" that can be watered
with sprinklers and needs minimal care.
McGovern emphasized that student
cooperation is needed to solve the problem of
the puncture vine. He suggested that if anyone
sees the vine on campus, they report it to
Perry Hackett.

Why aren't the tennis courts lighted? C.H.
Bob Young, Associate Director for
Administration in the Athletic Department,
said that two of the main reasons why lights
haven't been installed is that tennis has
become a popular game only within the last
few years, and that other projects, such as the
construction of Maples Pavilion and the new
swimming pool complex, had financial
priority.
Young did say that in a report submitted
by a subcommittee to the Faculty Student
Athletic Committee, a recommendation

would be made that the varsity and Encina
courts be lighted. The courts by the women's
gym will not be recommended for lighting
because they are close to a housing area.

Who are the Stanford employees with
peace officer status? Arc there any peacc
officers who are not with the S.U.P.D.? Y.B.
At the present time there are three peace
officers on the police force. They are Director
of Public Safety Marvin Herrington, Capt.
Frank Benederet, and Capt. William
Wullschleger.
The only other people who might have
peace officer status would be members of a
fire department. Although some large fire
departments have peace officers, Stanford's
does not.
