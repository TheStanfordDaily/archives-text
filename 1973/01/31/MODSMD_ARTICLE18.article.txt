## Saints Draft Merlo 
### 
Stanford linebacker Jim Merlo,
the Cards' most valuable player
this season, was selected by the
New Orleans Saints in the fourth
round of Tuesday's NFL draft.
Mike Askea, a 6-4, 260-pound
offensive tackle, was selected by
Denver three rounds later.
Merlo, the 87 th collegiate
taken by the pros, starred in the
East-West Shrine Classic and the
Hula Bowl, being selected the
outstanding defensive player in
the latter. The talented 6-2,
222-pound outside linebacker was
named to both the All-Coast and
All-Conference teams at the
conclusion of this season.
Askea was the pros' 165 th
choice yesterday, and will join
former Stanford coach John
Ralston at Denver.
Linemen dominated the first
round of the draft. Houston, the
worst team in pro football with a
dismal 1-13 record, was awarded
the dubious distinction of
selecting first. The Oiler's chose
John Matusak, a 6-7, 280-pound

defensive tackle from Tampa.
Quarterback Bert Jones of LSU
was the lone back among the pros'
first eight picks. Baltimore, by
virtue of a trade with New
Orleans, made Jones the second
choice by the pros.
The first Pac-Eight player
chosen in the draft was tight end
Charles Young, a 6-4, 228-pound
All-American from USC. Young is
regarded as an excellent blocker,
and few would deny his talent as a
receiver.
The national champion Trojans
had three players chosen in the
first round. In addition to Young,
running back Sam Cunningham
was chosen 11th by New England,
and offensive tackle Pete Adams
was chosen 22nd by Cleveland.
Heisman Trophy winner
Johnny Rodgers, the versatile
Ail-American from Nebraska, was
chosen in the first round by San
Diego, but was only the 25th
player taken by the pros. Rodgers,
a punt returner, running back, and
receiver, is considered too small
by many pro scouts.

Denver three rounds later.
Merlo, the 87 th collegiate
taken by the pros, starred in the
East-West Shrine Classic and the
Hula Bowl, being selected the
outstanding defensive player in
the latter. The talented 6-2,
222-pound outside linebacker was
named to both the All-Coast and
All-Conference teams at the
conclusion of this season.
Askea was the pros' 165 th
choice yesterday, and will join
former Stanford coach John
Ralston at Denver.
Linemen dominated the first
round of the draft. Houston, the
worst team in pro football with a
dismal 1-13 record, was awarded
the dubious distinction of
selecting first. The Oiler's chose
John Matusak, a 6-7, 280-pound

defensive tackle from Tampa.
Quarterback Bert Jones of LSU
was the lone back among the pros'
first eight picks. Baltimore, by
virtue of a trade with New
Orleans, made Jones the second
choice by the pros.
The first Pac-Eight player
chosen in the draft was tight end
Charles Young, a 6-4, 228-pound
All-American from USC. Young is
regarded as an excellent blocker,
and few would deny his talent as a
receiver.
The national champion Trojans
had three players chosen in the
first round. In addition to Young,
running back Sam Cunningham
was chosen 11th by New England,
and offensive tackle Pete Adams
was chosen 22nd by Cleveland.
Heisman Trophy winner
Johnny Rodgers, the versatile
Ail-American from Nebraska, was
chosen in the first round by San
Diego, but was only the 25th
player taken by the pros. Rodgers,
a punt returner, running back, and
receiver, is considered too small
by many pro scouts.
