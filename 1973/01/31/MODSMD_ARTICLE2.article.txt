# Watergate Defendants Convicted
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - T..0 former
officials of President Nixon's
re-election committee were convicted
yesterday of conspiracy, burglary and
wiretapping of Democratic party
headquarters in the Watergate
political-espionage case.
The jury of eight women and four
men took less than 90 minutes to
convict G. Gordon Liddy and James
W. McCord Jr. — respectively the
general counsel and security chief of
the Committee for the Re-election of
the President.
McCord was one of five men
arrested in the Watergate office
building quarters of the Democratic
National Committee last June 17.
Liddy was described by the
prosecution as the boss of the
operation, a contention accepted by
the jury in convicting him of
conspiracy.
The 16-day trial failed to answer
wider questions raised in the Watergate
affair — whether the conspirators were
acting on orders from higher up in the
Nixon campaign organization, or
whether they went off on their own in
illegal activities.
Senate Inquiry
A Senate panel is expected to look
into such issues in a later inquiry.
E. Howard Hunt, a former White

House consultant, and the four men
arrested with McCord, pleaded guilty
as the trial began and await sentencing
— now along with Liddy and McCord.
Chief U.S. District Court Judge
John J. Sirica, who presided over the
trial, ordered Liddy's and McCord's
bond revoked after the verdict was
given, and the men were jailed. Hunt
posted $100,000 surety bond after his
guilty plea; the other four remain in
custody.
Smiles
Liddy and McCord took the verdict
with slight smiles.
Neither defendant testified. There
were 51 witnesses for the prosecution
and 11 for the defense.
Sentencing for all seven will come
later after presentence investigations.
Conspiracy
Liddy was convicted of conspiracy
and two counts each of second-degree
burglary, attempting to intercept oral
and wire communications and actually
intercepting conversations.
McCord was convicted on those
same charges, plus two counts of
possessing bugging equipment.
The trial stemmed from the bugging
and break-in of Democratic party
headquarters in the Watergate building
last June 17.
The attorneys for McCord and

Liddy said they would request a bond
hearing before Judge Sirica today.
Gerald Alch, attorney for McCord,
said basic grounds for appeal would be
Sirica's failure to allow questioning of
prospective jurors on an individual
basis, his denial of mistrial motions
after five of the defendants pleaded
guilty and denial of Alch's request that
he be allowed to present witnesses that
McCord acted to prevent greater
crimes.
Alch was asked whether there were
higher Republican re-election officials
involved and replied: "Mr. McCord
was concerned solely with the charges
against him and that was the limit of
my knowledge."
The 69-year-old chief judge, who
assigned the case to himself because of
its importance, cautioned the jury to
instructions that lasted two hours and
15 minutes that a good motive is not a
defense against crime.
Demonstrations
The principal defense for McCord
was that he acted to learn in advance
of demonstrations planned against
Republican candidates or their
stand-ins.
Liddy's defense was principally that
he ordered investigations but that
others below him acted illegally.
In his final summation the

prosecutor said Liddy and McCord
were guilty of "conduct such as to
undermine the political system."
Objectivity
"Remember you are not advocates
or partisans in this matter, you are
now judges," the judge told the jurors.
"You must approach this matter
objectively ... the purpose of this trial
is to arrive at the truth."
In the pretrial days the veteran
judge had provided much greater limits
for testimony than was actually
introduced and there was little in the
evidence that had not been brought
out since the Watergate break-in June
17 in various news media
investigations.
The prosecution limited its 51
witnesses to try to provide that a
conspiracy existed to break into the
Democratic party headquarters and
the headquarters of Sens. George
McGovern and Edmund Muskie, that a
break-in occurred, that wiretaps and
microphones were planted and that
communications were intercepted.
The 32-year-old prosecutor, Earl J.
Silbert, in his final arguments, asked
the jury to bring in a guilty verdict,
"to help restore the faith that we have
in the democratic system and in our
political system that has been so
damaged."
Liddy, 42, the former counsel for
the Finance Committee to Re-elect the
President, was described as the boss of
the operation — an assertion with
which his lawyer agreed.
The maximum sentence for Liddy
would be 50 years and $40,000 in
fines.
McCord, 53, former security
coordinator for the President's
Re-election Committee and a 19-year
veteran of the CIA, could receive 60
years in prison and $60,000 in fines.

bond revoked after the verdict was
given, and the men were jailed. Hunt
posted $100,000 surety bond after his
guilty plea; the other four remain in
custody.
Smiles
Liddy and McCord took the verdict
with slight smiles.
Neither defendant testified. There
were 51 witnesses for the prosecution
and 11 for the defense.
Sentencing for all seven will come
later after presentence investigations.
Conspiracy
Liddy was convicted of conspiracy
and two counts each of second-degree
burglary, attempting to intercept oral
and wire communications and actually
intercepting conversations.
McCord was convicted on those
same charges, plus two counts of
possessing bugging equipment.
The trial stemmed from the bugging
and break-in of Democratic party
headquarters in the Watergate building
last June 17.
The attorneys for McCord and

Liddy said they would request a bond
hearing before Judge Sirica today.
Gerald Alch, attorney for McCord,
said basic grounds for appeal would be
Sirica's failure to allow questioning of
prospective jurors on an individual
basis, his denial of mistrial motions
after five of the defendants pleaded
guilty and denial of Alch's request that
he be allowed to present witnesses that
McCord acted to prevent greater
crimes.
Alch was asked whether there were
higher Republican re-election officials
involved and replied: "Mr. McCord
was concerned solely with the charges
against him and that was the limit of
my knowledge."
The 69-year-old chief judge, who
assigned the case to himself because of
its importance, cautioned the jury to
instructions that lasted two hours and
15 minutes that a good motive is not a
defense against crime.
Demonstrations
The principal defense for McCord
was that he acted to learn in advance
of demonstrations planned against
Republican candidates or their
stand-ins.
Liddy's defense was principally that
he ordered investigations but that
others below him acted illegally.
In his final summation the

prosecutor said Liddy and McCord
were guilty of "conduct such as to
undermine the political system."
Objectivity
"Remember you are not advocates
or partisans in this matter, you are
now judges," the judge told the jurors.
"You must approach this matter
objectively ... the purpose of this trial
is to arrive at the truth."
In the pretrial days the veteran
judge had provided much greater limits
for testimony than was actually
introduced and there was little in the
evidence that had not been brought
out since the Watergate break-in June
17 in various news media
investigations.
The prosecution limited its 51
witnesses to try to provide that a
conspiracy existed to break into the
Democratic party headquarters and
the headquarters of Sens. George
McGovern and Edmund Muskie, that a
break-in occurred, that wiretaps and
microphones were planted and that
communications were intercepted.
The 32-year-old prosecutor, Earl J.
Silbert, in his final arguments, asked
the jury to bring in a guilty verdict,
"to help restore the faith that we have
in the democratic system and in our
political system that has been so
damaged."
Liddy, 42, the former counsel for
the Finance Committee to Re-elect the
President, was described as the boss of
the operation — an assertion with
which his lawyer agreed.
The maximum sentence for Liddy
would be 50 years and $40,000 in
fines.
McCord, 53, former security
coordinator for the President's
Re-election Committee and a 19-year
veteran of the CIA, could receive 60
years in prison and $60,000 in fines.
WASHINGTON (AP) - T..0 former
officials of President Nixon's
re-election committee were convicted
yesterday of conspiracy, burglary and
wiretapping of Democratic party
headquarters in the Watergate
political-espionage case.
The jury of eight women and four
men took less than 90 minutes to
convict G. Gordon Liddy and James
W. McCord Jr. — respectively the
general counsel and security chief of
the Committee for the Re-election of
the President.
McCord was one of five men
arrested in the Watergate office
building quarters of the Democratic
National Committee last June 17.
Liddy was described by the
prosecution as the boss of the
operation, a contention accepted by
the jury in convicting him of
conspiracy.
The 16-day trial failed to answer
wider questions raised in the Watergate
affair — whether the conspirators were
acting on orders from higher up in the
Nixon campaign organization, or
whether they went off on their own in
illegal activities.
Senate Inquiry
A Senate panel is expected to look
into such issues in a later inquiry.
E. Howard Hunt, a former White

House consultant, and the four men
arrested with McCord, pleaded guilty
as the trial began and await sentencing
— now along with Liddy and McCord.

was concerned solely with the charges
against him and that was the limit of
my knowledge."
The 69-year-old chief judge, who
assigned the case to himself because of
its importance, cautioned the jury to
instructions that lasted two hours and
15 minutes that a good motive is not a
defense against crime.
Demonstrations
The principal defense for McCord
was that he acted to learn in advance
of demonstrations planned against
Republican candidates or their
stand-ins.
Liddy's defense was principally that
he ordered investigations but that
others below him acted illegally.
In his final summation the

prosecutor said Liddy and McCord
were guilty of "conduct such as to
undermine the political system."
Objectivity
"Remember you are not advocates
or partisans in this matter, you are
now judges," the judge told the jurors.
"You must approach this matter
objectively ... the purpose of this trial
is to arrive at the truth."
In the pretrial days the veteran
judge had provided much greater limits
for testimony than was actually
introduced and there was little in the
evidence that had not been brought
out since the Watergate break-in June
17 in various news media
investigations.
The prosecution limited its 51
witnesses to try to provide that a
conspiracy existed to break into the
Democratic party headquarters and
the headquarters of Sens. George
McGovern and Edmund Muskie, that a
break-in occurred, that wiretaps and
microphones were planted and that
communications were intercepted.
The 32-year-old prosecutor, Earl J.
Silbert, in his final arguments, asked
the jury to bring in a guilty verdict,
"to help restore the faith that we have
in the democratic system and in our
political system that has been so
damaged."
Liddy, 42, the former counsel for
the Finance Committee to Re-elect the
President, was described as the boss of
the operation — an assertion with
which his lawyer agreed.
The maximum sentence for Liddy
would be 50 years and $40,000 in
fines.
McCord, 53, former security
coordinator for the President's
Re-election Committee and a 19-year
veteran of the CIA, could receive 60
years in prison and $60,000 in fines.
WASHINGTON (AP) - T..0 former
officials of President Nixon's
re-election committee were convicted
yesterday of conspiracy, burglary and
wiretapping of Democratic party
headquarters in the Watergate
political-espionage case.
The jury of eight women and four
men took less than 90 minutes to
convict G. Gordon Liddy and James
W. McCord Jr. — respectively the
general counsel and security chief of
the Committee for the Re-election of
the President.
McCord was one of five men
arrested in the Watergate office
building quarters of the Democratic
National Committee last June 17.
Liddy was described by the
prosecution as the boss of the
operation, a contention accepted by
the jury in convicting him of
conspiracy.
The 16-day trial failed to answer
wider questions raised in the Watergate
affair — whether the conspirators were
acting on orders from higher up in the
Nixon campaign organization, or
whether they went off on their own in
illegal activities.
Senate Inquiry
A Senate panel is expected to look
into such issues in a later inquiry.
E. Howard Hunt, a former White

House consultant, and the four men
arrested with McCord, pleaded guilty
as the trial began and await sentencing
— now along with Liddy and McCord.
Chief U.S. District Court Judge
John J. Sirica, who presided over the
trial, ordered Liddy's and McCord's
bond revoked after the verdict was
given, and the men were jailed. Hunt
posted $100,000 surety bond after his
guilty plea; the other four remain in
custody.
Smiles
Liddy and McCord took the verdict
with slight smiles.
Neither defendant testified. There
were 51 witnesses for the prosecution
and 11 for the defense.
Sentencing for all seven will come
later after presentence investigations.
Conspiracy
Liddy was convicted of conspiracy
and two counts each of second-degree
burglary, attempting to intercept oral
and wire communications and actually
intercepting conversations.
McCord was convicted on those
same charges, plus two counts of
possessing bugging equipment.
The trial stemmed from the bugging
and break-in of Democratic party
headquarters in the Watergate building
last June 17.
The attorneys for McCord and

Liddy said they would request a bond
hearing before Judge Sirica today.
Gerald Alch, attorney for McCord,
said basic grounds for appeal would be
Sirica's failure to allow questioning of
prospective jurors on an individual
basis, his denial of mistrial motions
after five of the defendants pleaded
guilty and denial of Alch's request that
he be allowed to present witnesses that
McCord acted to prevent greater
crimes.
Alch was asked whether there were
higher Republican re-election officials
involved and replied: "Mr. McCord
was concerned solely with the charges
against him and that was the limit of
my knowledge."
