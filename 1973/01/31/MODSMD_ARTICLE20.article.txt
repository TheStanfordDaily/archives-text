# Oriental Art Stresses 'Harmony'
## 
### DAVID BRENNER 
Frank Doran doesn't move-he
flows. Gliding across the floor to
demonstrate the finer points of
Shiho Nage, the Four Comer
Throw, he moves with ease, a
twist here, a turn there, always in
control.
Moments later he claps his
hands and 30 students kneel in a
line along the edge of the mat.
Surveying their faces, Doran
reminds them, as always, to stay
relaxed, to harmonize with their
partners, and to flow with the
natural tendencies of their bodies.
What Frank Doran is teaching,
and what his students are
surprisingly eager to learn, is the
Oriental martial art ot Aikido.
Unlike its better-known
contemporaries, Judo and Karate,
Aikido is purely defensive. In
Aikido practices, there are no
imaginary opponents, only
partners with whom to
harmonize.
It was this concept of harmony
that first attracted Frank to
Aikido 14 years ago. He had been
studying Judo for several years
before he entered the first Aikido
do jo school to open in the United
States.
Offers Something More
There was nothing really wrong
with Judo, but Aikido seemed to
offer something more. He said, "If
it was only for self-defense, you
might just as well carry a big stick
around all the time. It's senseless
to do all this just to go out and
beat people. The idea is not
learning how to defeat others, but
learning how to make such a
perfect person out of yourself
that no one will fight with you."
Dave Brown, a student in
Doran's class at Stanford, was

originally attracted to the art
because of its self-defense aspects.
Now he says, "Aikido is a vehicle
for us to tune into ourselves, and
from that understanding we can
develop a positive attitude toward
others."
That doesn't sound like the
philosophy of a martial art, but
Aikido techniques can be very
effective against physical assaults.
The primary emphasis, however, is
on moving naturally and flowing
with one's partner. The word
Aikido itself can be loosely
translated as "the spirit of
harmony."
During Frank's class there are
none of the grunts and thuds
which generally accompany Judo
and Karate workouts. He
constantly reminds his students to
smileâ€”and they do. The sight of
30 peoplp twirling about and
repeatedly throwing one another
on the ground, smiling all the
while, seems incongruous, but the
students are an extraordinarily
happy group.
Different Approach
Anne Harrington, a graduate
student in computer science, said,
"I just feel super afterwards." She
added that in the months she has
been studying Aikido her posture,
speech, and general approach to
life had improved. "I see life as
one big Aikido exercise," she said.
Aikido encourages that sort of
attitude, but Doran supplements
it by bringing his own special gifts
to the role of sensei, teacher.
He has what Dave Brown called
a "gut feeling of concern for his
students." Doran rarely criticizes;
most of his comments fall into the
realm of helpful suggestions. In
short, he teaches by making
people feel good. Dave, who has
studied Aikido for over a year,
said, "Frank has an intuitive
knack for knowing just where you
are. The harder he throws me, the
more confidence I know he has in
my ability."
The talented instructor is an
excellent technician who clearly
inspires trust and respect; but the
respect is softened by genuine
warmth for the man. On his 40th
birthday the entire class joined in
a rousing chorus of "Happy

birthday dear sensei, happy
birthday to you."
Harmony
Doran minimizes the
traditional Oriental distinction
between sensei and student by
working hard to relate to each
member of the class. He
explained, "Too often we listen,
but don't really hear. In Aikido
you get on the mat and find that
if you're not in harmony with
your partner it won't work. So
you learn by necessity to do unto
others as you would have them do
unto you."
Many teachers find that
making a deep emotional
commitment to their students
leaves them drained of energy, but
Doran seems to thrive on it. For
him Aikido is more than just a
subject to teach, it is a way of life.
"I know Aikido is a good thing,"
he said. "We're dealing with
truth." The basis of that truth is
that there is an energy dimension
in all men which originates in
some greater entity like God or
Nature. Once men realize that this
infinite life force is constantly
flowing through them, they are
able to continually give of
themselves and harmonize with
others.
This isn't a Utopian philosophy
of universal love. Doran said, "I
know that goodness exists, but I
can't see it in everyone all the
time. Through Aikido I've come
to have more compassion and
understanding."
Intricate Movements
Near the end of one class
session, Frank had already
explained the Shiho Nage many
times, but one girl simply couldn't
get it right. After quietly
observing her for a moment, he
moved to her side, placed a
friendly arm around her shoulder,
smiled and said, "That's very
good, but why not try this; I
think it will be easier." Then he
gently took her arm and softly led
her through the intricate,
dance-like movements of the Four
Corner Throw.
Tom Garvey, another student,
said, "Aikido could be taught as a
dance," but feels that the

self-defense aspects make it more
interesting. Tom, who has studied
Kenpo Karate for five years, saw
many parallels. He noted that
Karate relies on anticipating an
opponent, but Aikido is based on
relaxed responses to potentially
aggressive acts.
Relaxed
Doran's pupils are so
relaxed that at times they seem to
be dancing instead of practicing a
martial art. His own love of
harmony and fluidity of motion
often seemed out of place away
from the dojo while he was on
duty as a policeman in Half Moon
Bay. However, his eight-year
police career ended last
December, and he has begun to
teach Aikido full-time. Although
this will mean a financial risk for
Doran and his family, his love of
the art was the overriding
consideration in the decision. His
first dojo in Half Moon Bay closed
for lack of students, but he is
presently teaching classes at Santa
Cruz and Canada College, as well
as at Stanford where practices are
held three days a week.
Doran enjoyed police work,
but it became increasingly
difficult to maintain a positive
attitude in the face of the negative
situations he regularly
encountered. Aikido, on the other
hand, keeps him "charged up all
the time." Doran compared law
enforcement and Aikido to the
difference between a dark room
and light room, and more bluntly,
between "unconsciousness and
consciousness"
"I'm trying to be true to
myself," he said, "and that's a
full-time job." To illustrate the
importance of being centered and
having a positive approach to life,
he told a story of a little boy
trying to stuff a dirt clod into the

spout of an old-fashioned, white
porcelain drinking fountain.
Positive Vibrations
"As long as the water is
flowing out of the fountain, the
little boy won't be able to stop it
up with dirt; but the instant the
water stops flowing, that boy can
jam up the works by ramming the
dirt into the spout," he said.
Men are like that drinking
fountain. As long as they give
positive vibrations, life won't bog
them down; but the moment they
cease, problems begin to envelop
them. Doran always tries to emit
these positive vibrations, but
when he encounters a bad
situation that seems absolutely
unalterable, he simply moves on.
In class it is different. There he
is prepared to deal with virtually
any problem. Observing his
students, he stands motionless,
arms draped at his sides, feet
hidden in the shadowy folds of
hakama, the long skirt worn bv
Aikido black belts. Then, quickly,
and smoothly, Frank Doran is
swirling and flowing, guiding
another initiate into the harmony
that is Aikido.
