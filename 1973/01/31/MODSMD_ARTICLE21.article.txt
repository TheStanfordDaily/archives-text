# Horpel Leads Card Wrestlers
## 
### 
Stanford's wrestling team had a
fine weekend, overwhelming
UC-Santa Barbara 44-5 Friday
morning and then going on to
finish seventh of 17 teams at the
San Francisco St. tourney Friday
and Saturday.
Chris Horpel came back from
the tournament with another first
place trophy. At 150 pounds,
Horpel pinned three of his four
opponents and just missed being
named the tournament's
outstanding wrestler.
In the Santa Barbara meet,
Coach Joe DeMeo pointed to
several outstanding performances.
Danny Mueller (134) won 12-4
over a good opponent, while both
Mike Achenbach (190), who is
now 2-0, and Chris Westersunt
(Hwt.) pinned their opponents.
At San Francisco State, where
Cal-Berkeley won the tourney
easily, nine of the 10 Stanford
wrestlers scored points. Especially
impressive were Ken Krebs, who
got to the semifinals before losing
to the defending meet champion,
and Bobby Sweetman, the blind
wrestler at 126, who gave the
champion in that weight division
his only tough match, finally
losing in overtime.
Other Cardinal point-scorers
included Allen Axworthy (119),
Mueller, Emmett Stanton (158),
John Govea (177), Mark Frelier
(190), and Art Estrada (Hwt.).
The team has several away
meets now, the first of which is at
San Jose State on Tuesday.
