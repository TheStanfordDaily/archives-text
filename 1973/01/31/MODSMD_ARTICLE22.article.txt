# Surgery For Plunkett
## 
### 
Quarter Jim Plunkett of the
New England Patriots will
undergo surgery on his left knee.
Plunkett aggravated the knee
yesterday while getting out of his
car. The injury is the latest in a
series of knee problems for the
1971 American Conference
Rookie of the Year and former
Stanford Heisman Trophy winner.
Patriots coach Chuck
Fairbanks said, "I look at it as a
blessing. If he has a cartilage that
is so sore it hurts whenever he
lands on it, then I'd rather have it
operated on now than in June."
