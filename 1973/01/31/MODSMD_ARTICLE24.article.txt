Earthquake Hits Mexico
MEXICO CITY — At least 10 persons were killed
and about 100 injured in a strong earthquake that
rocked a wide area of west-central Mexico
yesterday, the government announced.
The biggest toll reported so far was in the town
of Tecoman, in Colima state. The government said
six persons were killed in the town and about 100
injured there and in the surrounding valley.
Tecoman is 30 miles from the state capital,
Colima City.
Another four deaths were reported in Gomez
Farias, a village near Guzman City, in Jalisco state
near the border with Colima.
Damage also was reported in Michoacan state, in
the towns of San Vicente, Coahuayana and El
Ticuil.
The Fire Volcano, 50 miles north of Colima City,
erupted in a ball of flame and blew smoke and ash
over the area. Lava ran to some nearby villages, but
no casualties were reported.
"We saw it explode and throw up a pink ball of
flames," said Pablo Pacheco, a government
communications employee in nearby Guzman City.
"It began to vomit rocks and then pure smoke."
Colima City is 310 miles west of Mexico City
near the reported epicenter of the quake.
Pacheco said others in Tecoman were injured,
but he gave no figures. Army troops and Red Cross
help were on their way to the town, which had no
communication with the outside.
The quake occurred at 12:02 p.m.-l:02 p.m.
PST. The Tacubaya Observatory said it registered
7.5 on the Richter scale at the epicenter, about 300
miles west of Mexico City.
The National University said the tremor felt in
Mexico City lasted three minutes and 20 seconds.
Buildings swayed there and plaster fell from ceilings.
Officc workers scurried into the streets.
The governor's office in Colima said the quake
damaged part of the social security clinic in
Queseria, 15 miles north of the city, and an
undetermined number of persons were injured.
Vietnamese Trade Accusations
SAIGON — Vietnamese on both sides in the war
traded accusations of cease-fire violations yesterday
as Vice President Spiro T. Agnew met with Saigon's
leaders to underscore the Nixon administration's
post-war support for South Vietnam.
North Vietnam charged that the United States
and South Vietnam also violated the spirit of the
Paris cease-fire by hindering Communist delegates
arriving in Saigon to work on peacekeeking
arrangements.
The International Commission of Control and
Supervision, stalled by lack of security and
transportation because of the disputes failed to
meet an 8 a.m. deadline for getting its seven regional
teams in place and operating.
The fighting that marked the beginning of the
truce was reported to have subsidied in some areas
of South Vietnam, including the northern quarter
and the central highlands. But the clashes resulted in
major troop redeployments and movements in
violation of the agreement, thus causing chaos in the
key question of territorial control.
The Communist side apparently made more gains
than the South Vietnamese in the land grab that
preceded the truce with such momentum that it

never stopped when the cease-fire became effective
at 8 a.m. Sunday.
Nixon Optimistic For Economy
WASHINGTON — President Nixon tells Congress
today that his proposed curbs on federal spending
could make 1973 a great year for the economy,
prevent a price explosion and hasten an end to
wage-price controls.
In his annual economic report to Congress,
Nixon stresses the theme that he did in his fiscal
1974 budget message: sustained, noninflationary
economic growth is not possible without fiscal
restraint on Capitol Hill.
"We must develop more reliable and responsible
attitudes and methods for dealing with the federal
budget, so that it is not perpetually on the margin
of an inflationary explosion," Nixon says in the
report.
"We must prepare for the end of wage and price
controls, and be willing to show the same courage in
taking them off as was shown in imposing them."
He also calls for an end to the "restrictive effects
of the large number of other economic controls
exercised by the federal government, most of them
having their origins decades ago, and many of them
interfering with productivity and production."
Nixon does not explain what he means by these
controls, although it is presumed to refer to
agricultural policies. He gives no clue on when he
would end wage-price restraints.
The President says that 1973 economic prospects
are bright, with the economy expanding rapidly and
unemployment declining. "The problem, as far as
can now be foreseen, will be to prevent this
expansion from becoming an inflationary boom."
Judge Orders Study Released
LOS ANGELES — The judge in the Pentagon Papers
trial ordered the government yesterday to give the
defense 11 government studies, previously withheld
from the judge, which he said could help the
defendants "in the impeachment of witnesses."
The studies released showed more than half of
the Pentagon Papers study involved in the case were
assessed as having no relation to U.S. defense
interests and their release could not have harmed
the country.
U.S. Dist. Court Judge Matt Byrne made his
ruling after probing for nearly two weeks to find
out if the government concealed studies which were
"exculpatory," meaning helpful *to defendants
Daniel Ellsberg and Anthony Russo. He said he still
must review government studies submitted at the
last minute and could conceivably give the defense
more papers today.
Byrne revealed that in the past two weeks the
government prosecutor, Asst. U.S. Atty. David
Nissen, has given him 37 separate analysis of the
Pentagon Papers, many of which were supposed to
have been turned over last spring.
The defense said it would move today for
"sanctions" against the government for withholding
the data they said is "crucial" to the defense. They
also said they expect to move for dismissal of the
indictment.
Defense attorney Leonard Weinglass claimed that
testimony has shown Nissen had the studies since
January 1972, but didn't show them to the judge
until this month. Nissen has said he didn't consider
the studies as being covered by the judge's order of
last spring.

The judge's ruling gave the defense official
written government assessments that eight of the 18
Pentagon Papers volumes plus a report on the 1954
Geneva conference and part of one of the four
"secret negotiations volumes" would have had no
adverse effect on national defense if they were
released in 1969.
There are 20 documents entered in evidence —
the 18 volumes plus two background reports. The
exculpatory studies apply to lOV2 of the documents.
Ellsberg and Russo are charged with copying the
papers in 1969.
Senate Considers Power Curb
WASHINGTON — Senate hearings on a bill designed
to help Congress recapture control of the
government purse-strings began yesterday with
accusations by witnesses and senators that President
Nixon is abusing his power by impounding
appropriations.
But a theme also emphasized by committee
members and witnesses was that Congress must
reform its own procedures and show greater
discipline in holding down spending.
Sen. Sam J. Ervin, Jr. (D-N.C.), chairman of the
Senate Judiciary subcommittee on separation of
powers, said "Congress has a solemn responsibility
to bring appropriations in harmony with revenues."
