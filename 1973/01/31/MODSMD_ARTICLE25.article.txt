# Coyote Hill Zoning Meeting
## 
### 
The Palo Alto Planning Commission will
hold a public hearing tonight on a zone
change in the Stanford-owned Coyote Hill
industrial park.
As part of the settlement of the lawsuit
challenging industrial development of the
hill, Stanford has asked the city to shift
most of the area from the L-M-5 to the
L-M-5-D zone. Both zones permit light
industrial uses similar to those in the
Stanford Industrial Park; the "D"
classification would impose design controls,
requiring city officials to approve
architectural plans for any buildings built in
the area.
Stanford has also requested that a small
part of the area, covering the top of Coyote
Hill itself, be transferred from the L-M-5
zone to A-C (Agriculture and conservation),
a zone in which construction is not
permitted.
In addition to the Planning Commission,
the City Council must approve any zone
change.
The Commission meeting begins at 7:30
p.m. tonight in the Civic Center, 250
Hamilton Avenue.
