# Many Factors Affect Speed Reading Gains
## 
### GLENN KRAMON Second of Two Parts 
Although the Evelyn Wood
brochure claims its "graduates often
read entire college text books in one
evening," the average Reading
Dynamics graduate must slow down
considerably more for such material.
According to John Dolan, who has
conducted his own programs in the
Bay Area since 1956, speed reading is
analogous to driving a car. You read
slowly through technical materials just
as you move slowly through
construction areas, and faster through
light reading just as you drive faster on
a highway.
"You don't always have to go like a
hot-rodder," he stressed. But "like an
athlete who has worked the fat off can
play any sport better," the
conditioned speed reader will be able
to read even technical material more
quickly.
Because the speed reading
technique differs so completely from
the traditional method, the
instructor's installation of confidence
in his student is crucial for success.
Encouraging Figures
Evelyn Wood instructors advise the
beginner not to worry about his
present reading speed, then present
encouraging figures based on gains of
past students to raise his expectation
of success.
After he finishes the course,
mentions Carol Perley at her
introductory lesson, the average reader
can read light materials at up to 3000
words per minute. At that rate, he
could read The Godfather in just over
half an hour. And he learns to sift
through heavy pieces at up to 1000
words per minute.
She also tells her students that IQ
and age are of little importance as long
as the person is motivated to learn.
"Anyone can learn Reading Dynamics
who can read and understand their
favorite part of the Daily Newspaper,"
claims the brochure she distributes.
Though Dolan does not refute this
statement, he adds that "high IQ
doesn't mean he's going to be a speed
reader, but the speed reader is more
likely to have a high IQ. Also, the
person who tends more to the sight of
language does better than one who
tends to the sound of language."
Literary Background
Literary background more than IQ
determines ability to speed read. A
person who has read more will be
better able to fill in parts he missed
and to anticipate the author's ideas.
John Tate, an Evelyn Wood
instructor in Berkeley, says that age
makes a difference in regard to

how long it would take one to gain
confidence in his new skill.
Because an older person has more
deeply-ingrained habits, "his security
factor would take a longer time in
coming."
"You can teach an old dog new
tricks," adds Dolan, "but the dog has
to be strongly motivated."
Much more than IQ, background or
age, motivation determines whether or
not a reader will learn the new
technique. "If you go in skeptically,
you're not going to learn as much,"
says a sophomore Russian major who
asked not to be identified. "And if
you go in thinking it will do something
for you just by your sitting there
instead of going in aggressively, you
won't get as much out of it."
Tate observed that paying more for
the course motivates the student
because he'll work harder to get his
money's worth.
Instructors encourage use of books
or materials that the speed reading
student must read anyway as further
motivation for practice vital for
acquiring the skill.
Evelyn Wood courses call for at
least one hour of practice each day,
and the Reading Dynamics contract
stipulates that a person is not entitled
to take its free refresher course until
he does the required work and attends
all the sessions in the original class.
Criticism of speed reading courses
centers around the confidence and
concentration necessary for employing
the technique.
"If you speed read without
subvocalizing, you start to wonder
whether you're not missing
something," said the sophomore, who
took an Evelyn Wood class.
Although according to the tests
provided in the course she improved
her comprehension, she said she felt as
if the tests only covered the main
points in the reading and that she
could not answer more specific
questions.
Many speed reading graduates do
not trust their new skill, especially if
they feel the material they're reading
is crucial for good grades, for example.
Science students in particular
complain that they cannot apply speed
reading skills to their technical reading
with confidence.
And many gripe that speed reading
just takes too much energy for
practical use. George Fleeson, a senior
majoring in Psychology, concluded:
"It's like trying to teach someone how
to run faster. He may run faster, but
he's exhausted. You can read faster,
but you really have to dive into it and
concentrate."

majoring in Psychology, concluded:
"It's like trying to teach someone how
to run faster. He may run faster, but
he's exhausted. You can read faster,
but you really have to dive into it and
concentrate."
Although the Evelyn Wood
brochure claims its "graduates often
read entire college text books in one
evening," the average Reading
Dynamics graduate must slow down
considerably more for such material.
According to John Dolan, who has
conducted his own programs in the
Bay Area since 1956, speed reading is
analogous to driving a car. You read
slowly through technical materials just
as you move slowly through
construction areas, and faster through
light reading just as you drive faster on
a highway.
"You don't always have to go like a
hot-rodder," he stressed. But "like an
athlete who has worked the fat off can
play any sport better," the
conditioned speed reader will be able
to read even technical material more
quickly.
Because the speed reading
technique differs so completely from
the traditional method, the
instructor's installation of confidence
in his student is crucial for success.
Encouraging Figures
Evelyn Wood instructors advise the
beginner not to worry about his
present reading speed, then present
encouraging figures based on gains of
past students to raise his expectation
of success.
After he finishes the course,
mentions Carol Perley at her
introductory lesson, the average reader
can read light materials at up to 3000
words per minute. At that rate, he
could read The Godfather in just over
half an hour. And he learns to sift
through heavy pieces at up to 1000
words per minute.
She also tells her students that IQ
and age are of little importance as long
as the person is motivated to learn.
"Anyone can learn Reading Dynamics
who can read and understand their
favorite part of the Daily Newspaper,"
claims the brochure she distributes.
Though Dolan does not refute this
statement, he adds that "high IQ
doesn't mean he's going to be a speed
reader, but the speed reader is more
likely to have a high IQ. Also, the
person who tends more to the sight of
language does better than one who
tends to the sound of language."
Literary Background
Literary background more than IQ
determines ability to speed read. A
person who has read more will be
better able to fill in parts he missed
and to anticipate the author's ideas.
John Tate, an Evelyn Wood
instructor in Berkeley, says that age
makes a difference in regard to

how long it would take one to gain
confidence in his new skill.
Because an older person has more
deeply-ingrained habits, "his security
factor would take a longer time in
coming."
"You can teach an old dog new
tricks," adds Dolan, "but the dog has
to be strongly motivated."
Much more than IQ, background or
age, motivation determines whether or
not a reader will learn the new
technique. "If you go in skeptically,
you're not going to learn as much,"
says a sophomore Russian major who
asked not to be identified. "And if
you go in thinking it will do something
for you just by your sitting there
instead of going in aggressively, you
won't get as much out of it."
Tate observed that paying more for
the course motivates the student
because he'll work harder to get his
money's worth.
Instructors encourage use of books
or materials that the speed reading
student must read anyway as further
motivation for practice vital for
acquiring the skill.
Evelyn Wood courses call for at
least one hour of practice each day,
and the Reading Dynamics contract
stipulates that a person is not entitled
to take its free refresher course until
he does the required work and attends
all the sessions in the original class.
Criticism of speed reading courses
centers around the confidence and
concentration necessary for employing
the technique.
"If you speed read without
subvocalizing, you start to wonder
whether you're not missing
something," said the sophomore, who
took an Evelyn Wood class.
Although according to the tests
provided in the course she improved
her comprehension, she said she felt as
if the tests only covered the main
points in the reading and that she
could not answer more specific
questions.
Many speed reading graduates do
not trust their new skill, especially if
they feel the material they're reading
is crucial for good grades, for example.
Science students in particular
complain that they cannot apply speed
reading skills to their technical reading
with confidence.
And many gripe that speed reading

complain that they cannot apply speed
reading skills to their technical reading

to run faster. He may run faster, but
he's exhausted. You can read faster,
but you really have to dive into it and
concentrate."
