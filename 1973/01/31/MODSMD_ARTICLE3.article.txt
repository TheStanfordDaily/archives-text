# Former Venceremos Members Plead Not Guilty In Chino Case
## 
### LARRY FLEECE 
Robert Allan Seabock and Jean Stevens Hobson, two
former Venceremos members facing murder charges in the
Chino prison escape case, entered pleas of not guilty
during arraignment proceedings in San Bernardino County
Superior Court yesterday afternoon.
In addition, a motion by Deputy District Attorney
Joseph Canty during the arraignment to combine the trial
of Hobson and Seabock with the upcoming trial of
Andrea Holman and Benton Douglas Burt was denied by
Superior Court Judge Joseph B. Campbell.
The trial of Holman and Burt, who have also pleaded
not guilty to charges of murdering a Chino prison guard in
the escape of former Venceremos member Ronald Wayne
Beaty, is scheduled for Feb. 20. Holman is the daughter of
Medicine Prof. Halsted Holman.
Campbell scheduled the trial of Hobson and Seabock
for March 28.
Hobson was arrested on Dec. 11 of last year with Beaty
while crossing the Bay Bridge. Beaty had been at large
since Oct. 6, when, with the assistance of several
assailants, he fled the custody of two Chino prison guards
while en route to a court appearance in San Bernardino.
In the escape, one guard was shot and killed and the other
was seriously wounded.
Beaty Confession
Seabock was arrested on Dec. 19, along with fired
English Prof. H. Bruce Franklin, two other Venceremos
members, another former Venceremos member, and three
Arizona residents. The other seven were charged with
harboring the fugitive Beaty. The arrests were made
following the confession of Beaty, who implicated the
others.
Charges against Franklin and the three other local
residents for harboring a fugitive have since been dropped.
Following Beaty's confession, he was branded an
"enemy of the people" by other Venceremos members
and ousted from the revolutionary organization. Shortly

after this, Beaty pleaded guilty to first degree murder and
was sentenced to life imprisonment.
Police allege Seabock to have been the "trigger man" in
the Beaty escape. Beaty's own confession agreed with the
identification of Seabock by the deputies.
Arsenal Of Weapons
Following Seabock's arrest, authorities searched his
Palo Alto home and removed an arsenal of weapons,
including pistols, shotguns, ammunition, and explosive
devices.
Ten days ago, San Bernardino Sheriff's deputies, at the
direction of Beaty, uncovered a c.iche of 170 pounds of
dynamite buried in Bakersfield.
According to Sgt. Don Hardy of the Sheriff's
department, Beaty planned to retrieve the explosives
"with another member of the Venceremos" and use them
"for revolutionary purposes."
'Revolutionary Purposes'
But a photostat of a purported San Bernardino County
Sheriff s report obtained by Venceremos attorneys
contradicted earlier reports that Venceremos intended to
use the Bakersfield dynamite cache for "revolutionary
purposes."
The police report said that Beaty claimed he had been
told about the cache by a fellow prison inmate before his
escape. Beaty said he and Hobson attempted to locate the
cache after the escape, but were unsuccessful. He did not
make clear whether or not Venceremos had been involved
in gathering or burying the explosives.
Another San Bernardino Sheriff's report stated that
Beaty has identified a tape of H. Bruce Franklin's voice as
being the voice of a person he spoke with after his escape.
According to the report, Beaty picked out a tape of
Franklin's voice from four tapes of police officers reciting
the same words.
In his confession after his recapture, Beaty allegedly
accused Franklin of organizing a series of trips which took
the convict to Arizona and around the Bay Area.
