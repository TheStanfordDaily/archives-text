# More SLAC Cutbacks Planned
## 
### JIM WASCHER 
SLAC Director Wolfgang Panofsky
announced Monday that an impending
financial crisis would necessitate the
involuntary lay-off of 80 employees,
effective June 30.
Panofsky cited an announced
federal budget cut and spiralling
inflation as the principal reasons for
the lay-offs.
In a memo to "all hands" at SLAC,
Panofsky said that President Nixon's
budget for fiscal 1974 proposes $24.2
million for SLAC. This is a reduction
of $750,000 from the present
spending level, which was cut back last
fall when the Atomic Energy
Commission impounded $500,000
previously appropriated by Congress.
Panofsky said all those facing
lay-offs will be notified by Mar. 1. He
added the SLAC Personnel
Department will cooperate with the
University Personnel and Employee
Relations Department to "set up a
special task force to provide as much
assistance as possible to those who
must be laid off in searching for other
employment." The SLAC director said
"much as I regret these necessary
layoffs, indications are the possibility
of finding other suitable jobs on the
Peninsula, in particular with a
four-month lead time, is very much
better than it was two years ago."
Future Inflation
Panofsky explained that "using the
experience of the past, we conclude
that inflation next year will take an
additional $1.75 million out of
SLAC's program." Combined with the
Federal budget cuts, "this totals to an
equivalent of about $2.5 million by
which SLAC's purchasing power will

suffer next year — roughly 10
percent."
In addition to making the 6.75
percent cut in personnel, Panofsky
proposes "reducing the number of
contract personnel on board to an
absolute minimum." This reduction
"can reduce the number of people at
SLAC by approximately 20."
Panofsky estimates "that by not
filling 40 or 45 vacancies caused over
the next year and a half by retirements
and resignations (except when
absolutely necessary) we believe we
can accomplish the equivalent of a 25
man-year reduction" in personnel.
Finally, Panofsky says "an increase
of average basic earnings by an amount
1.5 percent lower than this year can
reduce costs equivalent to a reduction
of 15 more manyears."

This overall reduction of "the
number of people at SLAC by 140"
will save about two million dollars and
allow the accelerator to continue
operating "about half the time," as it
does now.
'Viable Laboratory'
Panofsky says "we simply cannot
run (the accelerator) any less and
continue to be a viable laboratory,
based on the output of the
accelerator's beams." SLAC has
reduced its operations each year in
order to provide a greater portion of
its budget "for salaries and other
related personnel costs such as fringe
benefits."
In fiscal year 1969, 46 percent of
SLAC's funds were spent for these
purposes, compared to nearly 64
percent now.

Panofsky says that government
agencies have assured him that SLAC's
long-range outlook is "excellent, as
long as (its) experimental and
theoretical research output continues
to contribute new basic facts of
nature."
The SLAC director also announced
that authorization for the construction
of the Recirculating Linear
Accelerator (RLA) was not included in
the 1974 budget. The RLA would
increase the research capabilities of the
accelerator by sending an electron
beam into the accelerator at twice its
normal energy' or by gradually spilling
the beam into experimental areas.
Panofsky added that "the President
is asking the Congress to authorize a
permanent computer building for
SLAC, a separate item in his budget."

percent."
In addition to making the 6.75
percent cut in personnel, Panofsky
proposes "reducing the number of
contract personnel on board to an
absolute minimum." This reduction
"can reduce the number of people at
SLAC by approximately 20."
Panofsky estimates "that by not
filling 40 or 45 vacancies caused over
the next year and a half by retirements
and resignations (except when
absolutely necessary) we believe we
can accomplish the equivalent of a 25
man-year reduction" in personnel.
Finally, Panofsky says "an increase
of average basic earnings by an amount
1.5 percent lower than this year can
reduce costs equivalent to a reduction
of 15 more manyears."

This overall reduction of "the
number of people at SLAC by 140"
will save about two million dollars and
allow the accelerator to continue
operating "about half the time," as it
does now.
'Viable Laboratory'
Panofsky says "we simply cannot
run (the accelerator) any less and
continue to be a viable laboratory,
based on the output of the
accelerator's beams." SLAC has
reduced its operations each year in
order to provide a greater portion of
its budget "for salaries and other
related personnel costs such as fringe
benefits."
In fiscal year 1969, 46 percent of
SLAC's funds were spent for these
purposes, compared to nearly 64
percent now.

Panofsky says that government
agencies have assured him that SLAC's
long-range outlook is "excellent, as
long as (its) experimental and
theoretical research output continues
to contribute new basic facts of
nature."
The SLAC director also announced
that authorization for the construction
of the Recirculating Linear
Accelerator (RLA) was not included in
the 1974 budget. The RLA would
increase the research capabilities of the
accelerator by sending an electron
beam into the accelerator at twice its
normal energy' or by gradually spilling
the beam into experimental areas.
Panofsky added that "the President
is asking the Congress to authorize a
permanent computer building for
SLAC, a separate item in his budget."
SLAC Director Wolfgang Panofsky
announced Monday that an impending
financial crisis would necessitate the
involuntary lay-off of 80 employees,
effective June 30.
Panofsky cited an announced
federal budget cut and spiralling
inflation as the principal reasons for
the lay-offs.
In a memo to "all hands" at SLAC,
Panofsky said that President Nixon's
budget for fiscal 1974 proposes $24.2
million for SLAC. This is a reduction
of $750,000 from the present
spending level, which was cut back last
fall when the Atomic Energy
Commission impounded $500,000
previously appropriated by Congress.
Panofsky said all those facing
lay-offs will be notified by Mar. 1. He
added the SLAC Personnel
Department will cooperate with the
University Personnel and Employee
Relations Department to "set up a
special task force to provide as much
assistance as possible to those who
must be laid off in searching for other
employment." The SLAC director said
"much as I regret these necessary
layoffs, indications are the possibility
of finding other suitable jobs on the
Peninsula, in particular with a
four-month lead time, is very much
better than it was two years ago."
Future Inflation
Panofsky explained that "using the
experience of the past, we conclude
that inflation next year will take an
additional $1.75 million out of
SLAC's program." Combined with the
Federal budget cuts, "this totals to an
equivalent of about $2.5 million by
which SLAC's purchasing power will

suffer next year — roughly 10
percent."
In addition to making the 6.75
percent cut in personnel, Panofsky
proposes "reducing the number of
contract personnel on board to an
absolute minimum." This reduction
"can reduce the number of people at
SLAC by approximately 20."
