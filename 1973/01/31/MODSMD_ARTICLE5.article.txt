# Senator John Stennis Wounded In Robbery At Washington Home
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Sen. John C.
Stennis (D-Miss.) was shot during a
holdup in front of his northwest
Washington home last night and
underwent a lengthy operation at
Walter Reed Army Medical Center for
removal of two bullets.
When Stennis entered surgery at
about 5:30 p.m. (PST), the hospital
would say only that his condition was
stable. Five hours later Stennis was
still reported in surgery and there was
no further word of his condition.
Stennis, 71, chairman of the Senate
Armed Services Committee, and a key

supporter of U.S. policy in Vietnam,
was shot as he alighted from his car,
police reported.
"It was just an ordinary street
robbery, it appears to me," said
Inspector T.J. Woifrey.
He said the assailants took Stennis'
gold watch, wallet and 25 cents in
change.
Woifrey said police had descriptions
of the assailants and were for
two young men. Tl.ey said the
shooting occurred at 7:40 p.m. EST.
Edward Jussely, Stennis' press
secretary, said one bullet hit the
Mississippi Democrat in the left side of
the chest just below the nipple. He
said it traveled across the chest,
piercing the stomach, the pancreas and
the colon, and lodged in the right side.
Another bullet struck the senator in
the left leg.
Jussely said Stennis did not go into
shock. Woifrey said Stennis was
conscious and talking when the first
officers arrived.
White House Press Secretary
Ronald L. Ziegler said President Nixon
was informed of the shooting and was
receiving reports on the senator's
condition.
"He talked by phone with Mrs.
Stennis at Walter Reed tonight and
expressed his deep concern," Ziegler
said. The President has instructed the
FBI to assist in every way possible in
the case.
A 1971 law makes it a federal crime
to assault, kidnap or kill a member of
Congress. That law allowed the FBI to

enter the Stennis case immediately.
FB 1 Director L. Patrick Gray 111 talked
with Stennis' wife for 15 minutes at
the hospital.
Sen. Henry M. Jackson (D-Wash.),
after talking with Mrs. Stennis and
doctors, said the senator "offered no
resistance" to the assailants.
Jackson said Mrs. Stennis told
police she heard "two pops" and then
her husband's voice calling "Coy,"
Mrs. Stennis' name.
Jackson said Stennis walked into
the house and told his wife "precisely
what to do."
Police Lt. George Keene said he had
no idea how Stennis was able to move
the 50 feet from the curb to the
house.
Keene said Stennis apparently was
accosted as he got out of his car, a
late-model white Buick.
Secretary of State William P.
Rogers went to the hospital to console
Mrs. Stennis and called her husband
"one of the great men of our time."
"Sen. Stennis to a very great extent
has been responsible for the success of
our foreign policy," Rogers said.
Stennis was shot a short time after
leaving a National Guard reception
near the Capitol. Aides said the
senator probably drove directly to his
home, about six miles away in
Washington's northwest quadrant.
They said he always drove to and from
work, usually alone.
Stennis' brown leather briefcase
was found lying next to the curb
directly in front of his home at 3609
Cumberland Ave., a white, two-story
brick house in a well-to-do
neighborhood. His coat was lying on
the curb.
Sen. James Eastland and Rep.
Jamie Whitten, fellow Mississippi
Democrats, were among the early
arrivals at the hospital. Dr. Edward
Elson, Senate chaplain, also arrived.
Sen. Strom Thurmond (R-S.C.), said
Stennis was shot with a small-bore gun
â€” "maybe a Saturday night special or
a .22 caliber."
"I feel more assured of his recovery
now that I've been told it was a
small-bore weapon," said Thurmond, a
World War II combat officer. Stennis,
who has been in the Senate since
1947, is chairman of the Senate
Armed Services Committee and a
strong supporter of the military.
