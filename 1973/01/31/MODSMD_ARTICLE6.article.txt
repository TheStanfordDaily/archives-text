# President Lyman Defends Stadium Tunnel Additions
## 
### 
President Richard Lyman last night
defended the controversial $400,000
entrance tunnels to be built in
Stanford Stadium as important to
sustaining the income-producing
capability of the stadium.
Speaking on KZSU radio's
"Campus Conference," Lyman
admitted the expenditure made "a
tempting target" for critics, but
pointed to the necessity of keeping the
stadium attractive to patrons.
Lyman said the project would
include new restroom and concession
facilities on the ground level, and
would be financed three-quarters from
accumulated gate receipts and
one-quarter from a gift to the Athletic
Department.
Gate Receipts
He conceded that neither the gate
receipts nor the gift were specifically
earmarked for the tunnel project,
although he said the funds were
restricted to the Athletic Department.
Although the stadium's seating
capacity will be reduced by 800,
Lyman said the project would
contribute to the stadium's revenue.
"The stadium is seldom full," he
pointed out, and "this will help to
keep people coming."
lie conceded that the revenue

increase attributable to the project
could not be pinpointed.
Manzanita Safety
On other matters, he said the
Manzanita Park trailers "are as fire
resistant as that kind of structure
could be ... It's not reasonable for
them to be the same as permanent
structures... I have no reason to
believe that they are substandard."
Nevertheless, he said, "We're
looking into additional safety
precautions" after the fire last week
which destroyed one trailer and
damaged another.
Lyman admitted that "it's not
realistic at all" to expect federal
funding for the Frenchman's Terrace
low/moderate-income housing project
in the near future. He attacked
President Nixon's moratorium on
federal housing funds, and pointed out
that no non-federal program would be
large enough to finance the $5 million
Stanford-proposed development.
Stanford officials are making
inquiries with government officials
regarding funding for the project,
Lyman said.
Lyman was questioned by Bob Fuss
and Pete Williams of KZSU and
Robert Bacon of the Daily.
