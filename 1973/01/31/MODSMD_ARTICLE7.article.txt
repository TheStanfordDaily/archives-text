## Reflections 
### 
As my term as editor comes to a close, I am getting ready to again
appreciate the simple things in life. After over seven months of 15
minute dinners and four hour sleeps filled with nightmares of
misspelled headlines and dropped bylines, I can again look forward to
a return to normalcy.
On. those nights when you are lucky enough to get to bed by 2
a.m., you are invariably awakened at 7 a.m. by somebody who dialed
the wrong number. And just when you're ready for an exquisite
half-hour dinner, a fire breaks out or your night editor breaks a leg
and you end up eating a Jack's burger on the run. When I decided to
run for editor last spring, people told me I was insane to want the job.
They were right and I loved every crazy minute of it.
The satisfaction one gets out of working with 75 people from all
sorts of backgrounds to put out a daily newspaper is hard to describe.
Sometimes you're amazed that the paper gets out, but it always does.
Despite all the arguments and enraged readers and public relations
people who want you to run a 10,000 word release about polar bear
hunting in Outer Mongolia, it's a lot of fun.
Although I'm looking forward to normal meals and normal sleep
and more than two minutes a day to spend with family and friends,
one has to leave this job with mixed emotions. You're happy about
having some time to call your own, but sad about all you didn't get
done. You're happy about the good things you did, but sad about
those that weren't so good.
In many ways, I'm surprised we were able to accomplish as much
as we did over the past seven months. When I took over as editor last
June I realized that we were facing a real manpower challenge. Most
of the Daily's top people from last year had graduated or gone
overseas or returned to long-neglected academic pursuits. Very few
experienced people were returning and this is quite a handicap to start
a volume with.
But we faced the challenge by planning a massive staff recruiting
campaign which was overwhelmingly successful. About half of the
current Daily staff joined the paper this year and most of these people
are freshmen and sophomores. This predominance of youth extends
to management positions as well. Half of the editors this past volume
were freshmen or sophomores. And the majority of our night editors
in recent weeks have been freshmen.
The fine job these newcomers did is a testimony to both their
eagerness and ability and to the fine training job done by those
experienced staff members who worked with them intensively. And
perhaps most importantly, this unprecedented influx of new staff
members means there will be a solid staff for the next two or three
years at least.
Despite the large amount of emphasis placed on staff training, we
were able to devote considerable time to innovations which greatly
improved the quality of the Daily.
Our "Bug Me" column has been extremely well-received and it will
be run more often in the future and expanded to include more
in-depth consumer affairs coverage. Our full-page opinions format
allowed for more community access and it led to more creative and
professional layouts. Big Daddy's column and the football issues were
also valuable additions to the "Daily!'
Of course the victory in our lawsuit against the Palo Alto Police
Department and our realization of an independent status were the two
major events of the volume. Much has been written on these two
subjects but I want to reiterate how important they were from a
freedom of the press standpoint.
Our lawsuit victory was one of the few positive decisions for the
press in recent months and our independence means that we have
finally achieved the professional freedom we have sought for so long.
The volume was not without its disappointments. We still had
reoccuring problems with accuracy and consistency, although this
situation improved in recent weeks. Our features coverage was not as
broad as I had hoped it would be. And at times, we were still guilty of
bad news judgment.
But all in all, I was very satisfied with the performance of my staff
the past volume and I want to thank all of them for their help. I want
to also thank those innumerable people in the community who gave
me advice and suggestions and made my job a bit easier.
So now it's all over and I can once again become a student. But
first I'm going to spend a little while involved in some self-indulgence
just like a freshly returned exile. I'm going to start with a long
leisurely sleep and a few long leisurely meals and some leisurely visits
with old friends. And I'm going to try to ignore fire alarms, phones
and newspapers for a few days. But, yes I would do it all over again.
Despite the problems, the confusion and the hours, these were the
best months of my life.
