# confounding the doctors
## The 						Joys Of Life In A Hospital 
### 
, peter schaffer

Not too long ago I was a happy
hedonistic student enjoying
vacation. Then one morning I felt
a sharp pain in my chest. This has
happened twice before, so I knew
it to be a pneumo thorax, a clever
medical term for getting a flat in
one of your lungs. This is caused
by blisters on the lung which a
few people are bom with. It seems
to attack college age males who
are tall, skinny, and ugly.
I arrived at a well-known
nearby hospital (which I won't
name because I'm still here and
want those pain pills to keep
coming). I waited awhile, then
filled out some forms twice
because the carbon paper didn't
work the first time. These forms
basically state, "The undersigned
agrees we can do anything we
want to him, and he must pay us
lots of money." What a deal.
Once in my room a friend
dropped by and left a quart of
malt liquor which I consumed
eagerly, although I hid it in a bag
feeling like a guilty teenager until
the nurse told me I didn't have to
hide it.
The next morning I was given a
pre-operation shot that made me
feel really good. I felt absolutely
great as they whizzed me through
the corridors. They pushed me
into a room where everyone was
wearing green pajamas. Another
shot put me under for hours.
Fog Cleared
The fog in my head cleared
finally, letting through
unbelievable pain. I drifted in and
out of consciousness, trying to
stay out. There were two tubes
coming out of my chest attached
to a noisy gadget called a
Pleur-evac which was vacuuming
my lung.
Early the next morning I
realized I had to go to the
bathroom. That quart of malt
liquor had been in there a day and
a half. They gave me a urinal so I
could "void" myself. That's
medical talk for urinating. I

positioned the plastic bottle and
braced myself.
Nothing happened. The nurse
suggested I wait awhile and try
again. Wait awhile? I was near
panic. I pleaded with the nurse,
asking what could be done. She
called the doctor, then gave me a
shot, saying if that didn't work I
would get a catheter. A catheter is
a thin plastic tube pushed through
the urinating device and into the
bladder allowing urine to flow. I
tried again, but after a few
minutes, I had to be "cathed."
New Record
In four hours I released over
2000 cc, some sort of hospital
record. At least I had the
satisfaction of thoroughly
confounding my doctors when
they saw the urine report. They
asked, "Where's all that fluid
coming from, I've never seen a
case like it."
Because of my chest drainage
tubes I was chained to my bed. In
order to take my daily X-rays a
portable machine was used. A
technician wheels the apparatus
into the room, places film
between my pillowcase and
pillow, snaps the picture and
leaves.
One time he returned,
sheepishly, explaining that he had
put the film backwards and had
taken an X-ray of my pillow,
which. I was glad to learn, was in
perfect health.
Jack LaLanne Fan
The nurses come in often.
Visualize the scene: you've been
cut open from front to back; your
ribs have been stretched, part of
your lung removed, and the lung's
been sanded and stuck to the
plural cavity wall; oral and anal
thermometers, needles, IV tubes,
catheters, and chest tubes have
been pushed in and out of you
until you feel like a pin cushion;
your left arm is useless because of
cut shoulder muscles; and your
roommate is a "Let's Make A
Deal," "Dating Game," and Jack

LaLanne fan. Enter the Nurse,
that Angel of Mercy, armed with a
black cloth band and a
stethoscope. "Hi," she says,
"feeling any pain?"
I thought of saying,"No, I'm a
masochist, and I love it here." But
before I can say anything, she
sticks a thermometer in my
mouth and grabs my arm, a little
disappointed to find me awake.
She wraps her band around my
arm, pumping it until it cuts off
circulation. She gets distracted
watching Jack LaLanne standing
on his head reading a fan letter
from a 28-year-old mother of

three. She starts taking my pulse
before finishing my blood
pressure.
But I've found ways to get
back at them. I put my
thermometer in ice water or even
better hold it against my bed
lamp. Watch them jump when
thev read "108Â°F"!
So much for hospital life. At
least it gives me a chance to do
absolutely nothing, my
strongpoint and a favorite
pasttime.
