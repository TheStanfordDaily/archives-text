# Kissinger Will Visit Hanoi To Discuss Postwar Aid
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - President
Nixon said yesterday he is sending
Henry Kissinger to Hanoi next week to
discuss postwar financial aid for North
Vietnam and disclosed he personally
will meet this spring with South
Vietnamese President Nguyen Van
Thieu.
Holding his first news conference in
nearly four months, the chief
executive said the intricate agreement
signed Saturday in Paris can bring

peace "in Indochina for a very long
period of time."
But he said the once-warring parties
need "incentives to peace." And he
cast the Indochina-wide reconstruction
program as one incentive, calling it "a
potential investment in peace."
Tendency Towards Peace
With the postwar aid, Nixon said,
the North Vietnamese "will have a
tendency to turn inward to the works
of peace rather than turning outward

to the works of war."
Officials said Kissinger will stress
Nixon's view that the postwar aid can
begin only after the Vietnam cease-fire
is fully observed.
The visit to Hanoi Feb. 10-13 will
open "vitally important.. . direct
communication" with top North
Vietnamese leaders, Nixon said.
Meeting With Thieu
Kissinger's mission as the first
ranking American official to reach
Hanoi in more than a decade was
announced by the White House about
an hour before Nixon appeared in the
Executive Mansion's news briefing
room. Nixon announced he will meet
with Thieu at the Western White
House in San Clemente, Calif., at a
"mutually convenient" time in the
spring.
Fielding reporters' for 36
minutes, the President also:
—Reiterated that he will not grant
amnesty to those who "chose to desert
their country" rather than serve in
Vietnam.
—Bitterly chastised critics in the
media and intellectual circles,
declaring he had achieved peace with
honor although "I know it gags some
of you to write that phrase . .
—Said he would not personally
welcome U.S. prisoners of war back to
American soil because the PCWs
deserve privacy and a rapid return to
their families and "we should not
grandstand it; we should not exploit
it."
Nixon also said he had received
every assurance that China will release
two American fliers held since their
planes were shot down in the
mid-19605. He said, "We have every
reason to believe" the fliers will be
freed "as the POW situation is worked
out in Vietnam."
The aviators have been identified as
Navy Lt. Cmdr. Robert Flynn and Air
Force Maj. Philip Smith.

WASHINGTON (AP) - President
Nixon said yesterday he is sending
Henry Kissinger to Hanoi next week to
discuss postwar financial aid for North
Vietnam and disclosed he personally
will meet this spring with South
Vietnamese President Nguyen Van
Thieu.
Holding his first news conference in
nearly four months, the chief
executive said the intricate agreement
signed Saturday in Paris can bring

peace "in Indochina for a very long
period of time."
But he said the once-warring parties
need "incentives to peace." And he
cast the Indochina-wide reconstruction
program as one incentive, calling it "a
potential investment in peace."
Tendency Towards Peace
With the postwar aid, Nixon said,
the North Vietnamese "will have a
tendency to turn inward to the works
of peace rather than turning outward

to the works of war."
Officials said Kissinger will stress
Nixon's view that the postwar aid can
begin only after the Vietnam cease-fire
is fully observed.
The visit to Hanoi Feb. 10-13 will
open "vitally important.. . direct
communication" with top North
Vietnamese leaders, Nixon said.
Meeting With Thieu
Kissinger's mission as the first
ranking American official to reach
Hanoi in more than a decade was
announced by the White House about
an hour before Nixon appeared in the
Executive Mansion's news briefing
room. Nixon announced he will meet
with Thieu at the Western White
House in San Clemente, Calif., at a
"mutually convenient" time in the
spring.
Fielding reporters' for 36
minutes, the President also:
—Reiterated that he will not grant
amnesty to those who "chose to desert
their country" rather than serve in
Vietnam.
—Bitterly chastised critics in the
media and intellectual circles,
declaring he had achieved peace with
honor although "I know it gags some
of you to write that phrase . .
—Said he would not personally
welcome U.S. prisoners of war back to
American soil because the PCWs
deserve privacy and a rapid return to
their families and "we should not
grandstand it; we should not exploit
it."
Nixon also said he had received
every assurance that China will release
two American fliers held since their
planes were shot down in the
mid-19605. He said, "We have every
reason to believe" the fliers will be
freed "as the POW situation is worked
out in Vietnam."
The aviators have been identified as
Navy Lt. Cmdr. Robert Flynn and Air
Force Maj. Philip Smith.
