# On The New Founders
## Love Thy Alma Mater 
### 
"More and more there are
alumni who are ashamed of their
university. Many refuse to further
support the university." "More
than ever before, alumni are
realizing they must be very careful
before they donate funds." These
quotations are from an unsigned
article, "Where Will Your Money
Go?" in the December issue of
Stanford's Direction, published by
the New Founders League of
Stanford.
The New Founders do not
appear to be especially ashamed
by Stanford's slump from the
pinnacle of glory as a Rose Bowl
victor, but they are concerned
that in other activities Stanford is
going in the wrong direction.
They suggest that alumni refrain
from unrestricted donations until
the university trustees and
administration give concrete
evidence that they wish to change
Stanford's direction. That this
advice to donors is given as the
$300 million "Campaign for
| Stanford" gets underway is
[ perhaps not a coincidence.
In their declared objectives the
j New Founders indicate, not very
I precisely, some directions in
which Stanford should go. For
! example, an admirable objective is

excellence in research and
education. This, however, raises
the question: in what schools or
departments is a new direction
needed?
Recommendations
Another recommendation is
that trustees of "proven
capabilities and character" be
sought and that trustees be urged
"to establish more definitive
policies." But how can this be
accomplished unless those who
select the trustees are told what
capabilities and what attributes of
character are lacking in the
present Board and which policies
are not definitive enough?
The encouragement of
"genuinq freedom of thought and
speech for faculty and students"
is surely in harmony with the
Stanford motto "Let the winds of
freedom blow"â€”but how are
these freedoms to be encouraged
unless it is explained by whom
and how they are being denied?
A "philosophically balanced
faculty" is another objective that
might be desirable if trustees,
faculty, and alumni only knew
what kind of tests could be
applied to determine whether a
professor in his field of
specialization, his politics, his

religion was reactionary,
conservative, moderate, or
revolutionary.
Restoring ROTC
The New Founders put great
emphasis on restoring ROTC
because the university has several
obligations: to give students the
opportunity to take the program,
to contribute to the civilian
leadership of the armed forces,
and to national security. Neither
the New Founders nor David
Packard, benefactor, ex-trustee
and ex-Deputy Secretary of
Defense, whom they quote, seem
to consider the reason why there
has been more opposition to
ROTC during the Vietnam war
than during two world wars and
Korea.
Nor do they consider whether,
in view of the rapid changes in
science and technology and the
nature of security, the ROTC
program is the best way to
prepare Stanford students to
participate effectively in national
security.
Neither the New Founders nor
Mr. Packard seem to envision our
security being threatened not by
military rivals, but by
environmental practices that (as
Rene Dubos puts it) may
"transform the earth into a place
fit only for rats, roaches and
ragweed."
Civility and Decency
Mr. Packard has "nothing but
contempt" for university
presidents who disagree with him
about ROTC. Stanford's
president, it appears, is especially
contemptible for disagreeing with
a benefactor. "Let us again learn,"
said the President in his inaugural
address, "to elevate our
differences with civility and
decency."
I have not had the privilege of
spending four or more years as a
Stanford student, but I have
become attached to the place
after fortv-nine years and I
applaud the well-meant concern
of such alumni groups as the New
Founders. But as I have indicated,
I believe the objectives as stated
raise more questions than they
answer. Moreover, an attempt to
buy a change in a university's
direction by the offer of a "gift"
or the threat to withhold a "gift"
is one of the oldest, least
admirable and most dubious ways
of showing one's love for Alma
Mater.
