Editor:
Your recent editorial on
Tresidder was largely based on
incorrect assumptions and trite
generalities.
First, your statement that the
Tresidder Store "has never been
noted for an overly large selection
of goods.. .is erroneous. We
carry over 2,000 items, which,
considering the space alloted us, is
an impressive number. We have
been cutting out slow
merchandise and reducing space
alloted to items in response to
demands to increase our
inventory. As it stands, we offer a
selection of brands in all
merchandise lines, many of them
customer requests. We suggest the
editor visit other campus stores
and compare the sprinkling of
drug sundries they carry to the
variety we offer.
As for prices, we cannot, and
have never claimed to, compete
with big discount stores in the
area. They have storage facilities
which enable them to buy lots of
merchandise in quantities so large
that the retail price they advertise
is often lower than the wholesale
price we pay. We have a low
mark-up and are very competitive
with other similar sized
convenience stores in the area. We
are not a profit-oriented
enterprise: our objective is merely
to cover labor and overhead.
Should we exceed that, any profit
would go toward free Tresidder
services, such as the browsing
room, information desk and
meeting rooms; or toward
improved facilities or lower prices.
Another factor to consider when
talking about prices is the rip-off
rate—s3,ooo last year.
We resent the word "rotted" in
reference to the candy which
melted in our storeroom last year.
There is a difference. And the
Store employees who were
interviewed on this matter
offered, rather than "admitted,"
the fact that we have a heat
problem. This is not an attempt to
whitewash the problem. We do
need air conditioning and plans
are in progress to have it installed
by next summer.
The store is not perfect, but we
believe the editor's parting
recommendation, to forego
expansion of Tresidder services
until those already existing are
"improved dramatically" is itself a
bit pompous and theatrical. The
store has changed and will
continue to improve. The Daily
has ignored this fact consistently,
picking on the stale problems of
the past instead of honestly
reporting the present. We
welcome anyone's concrete
suggestions and criticisms.

Editor:
Henry Kissinger, the U.S.
Government, and the controlled
mass media are already at work
destroying the spirit of the
Vietnam ceasefire. Whenever the
question of North Vietnamese
troops in South Vietnam comes
up, Kissinger and the press assure
us that although there is no
provision for their withdrawal,
these North Vietnamese troops
have no legal right to be in South
Vietnam.
The fact is that the most basic
compromise forced on the U.S. is
Article I of the agreement where
the U.S. recognizes the unity,
sovereignty, and territorial
integrity of Vietnam, as set forth
in the 1954 Geneva Agreements.
This means that the U.S.
recognizes that Vietnam is one
country and any divisions are
temporary conveniences.
It further means that there is
nothing illegal about DRV troops
backing up the NLF-PRG as long
as they do not initiate aggressive
armed action while the ceasefire is
in effect. But it is much more
likely that Thieu, like his

predecessor Diem, will begin
military action against the NLF,
since his tyrannical rule will be
unable to keep down the
revolutionary and progressive
ideas among the non-communist
Vietnamese. There will be unrest
in Thieu's domain—from political
prisoners, veterans, Bhuddhists,
and all kinds of political
groups—which will intensify with
time.
If the honest sections of our
people recognize the distortions
of the agreement that are already
flying around the mass media, it
will help insure that the
Vietnamese people are left to
settle their own affairs. Let's not
give Nixon and the monopoly
corporations any opportunity to
move in on the markets, labor,
and resources they still seek in
Southeast Asia. Runaway shops,
and the rape and pillage of foreign
countries is certainly not in the
interests of the American people.

Editor:
I was pleased to see the Daily
article (Jan. 22) on "Competitive
Atmosphere Encourages .. .
Among Premeds." This subject
and the many attending problems
associated with the large
percentage of students choosing
biologically oriented curricula
here at Stanford and in the
country as a whole needs further
discussion. However, there was a
statement in this article which
needs correction.
It was stated that "Chemistry
lab space here has tripled in the
last three years. If students want a
course we'll find some way to give
it." The latter assertion is correct,
although "want" should have
been "need or require." However,
the statement that laboratory
space in Chemistry has tripled in
the last three years is completely
wrong. The number of
undergraduate students in
Chemistry laboratories has tripled
but the Chemistry undergraduate
laboratory space has not changed
appreciably since 1906 when the
present structure was
reconstructed after the
earthquake.
All undergraduate laboratory
space is now being used forty
hours per week. This quarter
evening Chemistry laboratory
sessions are being given four
nights a week for the first time.
These increasing numbers have
been accommodated with some
difficulty; we hope that our
students will be understanding
while these problems are being
worked out. The inconvenience to
all would have been very much
worse if it were not for the
concern of the Chemistry
Department and our very
dedicated group of excellent
Graduate Teaching Assistants.

Recruiting Proposal
Editor:
One of the most challenged
principles in today's society is the
public's right to know. In order to
buttress this principle, in our own
community, I would like to
propose a change in current
regulations concerning the
operation of the Career Planning
and Placement Center. Below is
the text of my proposal:
1) If at least ten days before
the arrival of any company's or
organization's recruiters, a
petition with at least fifty (50)
signatures of members of the
Stanford Community is presented
to the Office of Career Planning
and Placement, that office will
contact the company or
organization and inform it that to
recruit at Stanford either the
recruiter or another representative
of the company will be required
to hold an open meeting prior to
recruiting to discuss company
policies and practices.
2) If the company or
organization does not comply
with this requirement, its
recruiters will not be allowed on
campus.
Such a regulation would
guarantee the right of the
Stanford community to inquire
into the policies and practices of
companies or organizations using
Stanford Placement facilities. It
would also be consistent with
University policies against other
forms of information such as
classified research.
I would hope that this proposal
could be placed on a future
agenda of the Committee on
Student Services for action.

destroying the spirit of the
Vietnam ceasefire. Whenever the
question of North Vietnamese
troops in South Vietnam comes
up, Kissinger and the press assure
us that although there is no
provision for their withdrawal,
these North Vietnamese troops
have no legal right to be in South
Vietnam.
The fact is that the most basic
compromise forced on the U.S. is
Article I of the agreement where
the U.S. recognizes the unity,
sovereignty, and territorial
integrity of Vietnam, as set forth
in the 1954 Geneva Agreements.
This means that the U.S.
recognizes that Vietnam is one
country and any divisions are
temporary conveniences.
It further means that there is
nothing illegal about DRV troops
backing up the NLF-PRG as long
as they do not initiate aggressive
armed action while the ceasefire is
in effect. But it is much more
likely that Thieu, like his

predecessor Diem, will begin
military action against the NLF,
since his tyrannical rule will be
unable to keep down the
revolutionary and progressive
ideas among the non-communist
Vietnamese. There will be unrest
in Thieu's domain—from political
prisoners, veterans, Bhuddhists,
and all kinds of political
groups—which will intensify with
time.
If the honest sections of our
people recognize the distortions
of the agreement that are already
flying around the mass media, it
will help insure that the
Vietnamese people are left to
settle their own affairs. Let's not
give Nixon and the monopoly
corporations any opportunity to
move in on the markets, labor,
and resources they still seek in
Southeast Asia. Runaway shops,
and the rape and pillage of foreign
countries is certainly not in the

I was pleased to see the Daily
article (Jan. 22) on "Competitive
Atmosphere Encourages .. .
Among Premeds." This subject
and the many attending problems
associated with the large
percentage of students choosing
biologically oriented curricula
here at Stanford and in the
country as a whole needs further
discussion. However, there was a
statement in this article which
needs correction.
It was stated that "Chemistry
lab space here has tripled in the
last three years. If students want a
course we'll find some way to give
it." The latter assertion is correct,
although "want" should have
been "need or require." However,
the statement that laboratory
space in Chemistry has tripled in
the last three years is completely
wrong. The number of
undergraduate students in
Chemistry laboratories has tripled
but the Chemistry undergraduate
laboratory space has not changed
appreciably since 1906 when the
present structure was
reconstructed after the
earthquake.
All undergraduate laboratory
space is now being used forty
hours per week. This quarter
evening Chemistry laboratory
sessions are being given four
nights a week for the first time.
These increasing numbers have
been accommodated with some
difficulty; we hope that our
students will be understanding
while these problems are being
worked out. The inconvenience to
all would have been very much
worse if it were not for the
concern of the Chemistry
Department and our very
dedicated group of excellent
Graduate Teaching Assistants.

Recruiting Proposal
Editor:
One of the most challenged
principles in today's society is the
public's right to know. In order to
buttress this principle, in our own
community, I would like to
propose a change in current
regulations concerning the
operation of the Career Planning
and Placement Center. Below is
the text of my proposal:
1) If at least ten days before
the arrival of any company's or
organization's recruiters, a
petition with at least fifty (50)
signatures of members of the
Stanford Community is presented
to the Office of Career Planning
and Placement, that office will
contact the company or
organization and inform it that to
recruit at Stanford either the
recruiter or another representative
of the company will be required
to hold an open meeting prior to
recruiting to discuss company
policies and practices.
2) If the company or
organization does not comply
with this requirement, its
recruiters will not be allowed on
campus.
Such a regulation would
guarantee the right of the
Stanford community to inquire
into the policies and practices of
companies or organizations using
Stanford Placement facilities. It
would also be consistent with
University policies against other
forms of information such as
classified research.
I would hope that this proposal
could be placed on a future
agenda of the Committee on
Student Services for action.

Your recent editorial on
Tresidder was largely based on
incorrect assumptions and trite
generalities.
First, your statement that the
Tresidder Store "has never been
noted for an overly large selection
of goods.. .is erroneous. We
carry over 2,000 items, which,
considering the space alloted us, is
an impressive number. We have
been cutting out slow
merchandise and reducing space
alloted to items in response to
demands to increase our
inventory. As it stands, we offer a
selection of brands in all
merchandise lines, many of them
customer requests. We suggest the
editor visit other campus stores
and compare the sprinkling of
drug sundries they carry to the
variety we offer.
As for prices, we cannot, and
have never claimed to, compete
with big discount stores in the
area. They have storage facilities
which enable them to buy lots of
merchandise in quantities so large
that the retail price they advertise
is often lower than the wholesale
price we pay. We have a low
mark-up and are very competitive
with other similar sized
convenience stores in the area. We
are not a profit-oriented
enterprise: our objective is merely
to cover labor and overhead.
Should we exceed that, any profit
would go toward free Tresidder
services, such as the browsing
room, information desk and
meeting rooms; or toward
improved facilities or lower prices.
Another factor to consider when
talking about prices is the rip-off
rate—s3,ooo last year.
We resent the word "rotted" in
reference to the candy which
melted in our storeroom last year.
There is a difference. And the
Store employees who were
interviewed on this matter
offered, rather than "admitted,"
the fact that we have a heat
problem. This is not an attempt to
whitewash the problem. We do
need air conditioning and plans
are in progress to have it installed
by next summer.
The store is not perfect, but we
believe the editor's parting
recommendation, to forego
expansion of Tresidder services
until those already existing are
"improved dramatically" is itself a
bit pompous and theatrical. The
store has changed and will
continue to improve. The Daily
has ignored this fact consistently,
picking on the stale problems of
the past instead of honestly
reporting the present. We
welcome anyone's concrete
suggestions and criticisms.

wrong. The number of
undergraduate students in
Chemistry laboratories has tripled
but the Chemistry undergraduate
laboratory space has not changed
appreciably since 1906 when the
present structure was
reconstructed after the

All undergraduate laboratory
space is now being used forty
hours per week. This quarter
evening Chemistry laboratory

nights a week for the first time.
These increasing numbers have
been accommodated with some
difficulty; we hope that our

Recruiting Proposal
Editor:
One of the most challenged
principles in today's society is the
public's right to know. In order to
buttress this principle, in our own
community, I would like to
propose a change in current
regulations concerning the
operation of the Career Planning
and Placement Center. Below is
the text of my proposal:
1) If at least ten days before
the arrival of any company's or
organization's recruiters, a
petition with at least fifty (50)
signatures of members of the
Stanford Community is presented
to the Office of Career Planning
and Placement, that office will
contact the company or
organization and inform it that to
recruit at Stanford either the
recruiter or another representative
of the company will be required
to hold an open meeting prior to
recruiting to discuss company
policies and practices.
2) If the company or
organization does not comply
with this requirement, its
recruiters will not be allowed on
campus.
Such a regulation would
guarantee the right of the
Stanford community to inquire
into the policies and practices of
companies or organizations using
Stanford Placement facilities. It
would also be consistent with
University policies against other
forms of information such as
classified research.
I would hope that this proposal
could be placed on a future
agenda of the Committee on
Student Services for action.

Your recent editorial on
Tresidder was largely based on
incorrect assumptions and trite
generalities.
First, your statement that the
Tresidder Store "has never been
noted for an overly large selection
of goods.. .is erroneous. We
carry over 2,000 items, which,
considering the space alloted us, is
an impressive number. We have
been cutting out slow
merchandise and reducing space
alloted to items in response to
demands to increase our
inventory. As it stands, we offer a
selection of brands in all
merchandise lines, many of them
customer requests. We suggest the
editor visit other campus stores
and compare the sprinkling of
drug sundries they carry to the
variety we offer.
As for prices, we cannot, and
have never claimed to, compete
with big discount stores in the
area. They have storage facilities
which enable them to buy lots of
merchandise in quantities so large
that the retail price they advertise
is often lower than the wholesale
price we pay. We have a low
mark-up and are very competitive
with other similar sized
convenience stores in the area. We
are not a profit-oriented
enterprise: our objective is merely
to cover labor and overhead.
Should we exceed that, any profit
would go toward free Tresidder
services, such as the browsing
room, information desk and
meeting rooms; or toward
improved facilities or lower prices.
Another factor to consider when
talking about prices is the rip-off
rate—s3,ooo last year.
We resent the word "rotted" in
reference to the candy which
melted in our storeroom last year.
There is a difference. And the
Store employees who were
interviewed on this matter
offered, rather than "admitted,"
the fact that we have a heat
problem. This is not an attempt to
whitewash the problem. We do
need air conditioning and plans
are in progress to have it installed
by next summer.
The store is not perfect, but we
believe the editor's parting
recommendation, to forego
expansion of Tresidder services
until those already existing are
"improved dramatically" is itself a
bit pompous and theatrical. The
store has changed and will
continue to improve. The Daily
has ignored this fact consistently,
picking on the stale problems of
the past instead of honestly
reporting the present. We
welcome anyone's concrete
suggestions and criticisms.

Henry Kissinger, the U.S.
Government, and the controlled
mass media are already at work
destroying the spirit of the
Vietnam ceasefire. Whenever the
question of North Vietnamese
troops in South Vietnam comes
up, Kissinger and the press assure
us that although there is no
provision for their withdrawal,
these North Vietnamese troops
have no legal right to be in South
Vietnam.
The fact is that the most basic
compromise forced on the U.S. is
Article I of the agreement where
the U.S. recognizes the unity,
sovereignty, and territorial
integrity of Vietnam, as set forth
in the 1954 Geneva Agreements.
This means that the U.S.
recognizes that Vietnam is one
country and any divisions are
temporary conveniences.
It further means that there is
nothing illegal about DRV troops
backing up the NLF-PRG as long
as they do not initiate aggressive
armed action while the ceasefire is
in effect. But it is much more
likely that Thieu, like his

predecessor Diem, will begin
military action against the NLF,
since his tyrannical rule will be
unable to keep down the
revolutionary and progressive
ideas among the non-communist
Vietnamese. There will be unrest
in Thieu's domain—from political
prisoners, veterans, Bhuddhists,
and all kinds of political
groups—which will intensify with
time.
If the honest sections of our
people recognize the distortions
of the agreement that are already
flying around the mass media, it
will help insure that the
Vietnamese people are left to
settle their own affairs. Let's not
give Nixon and the monopoly
corporations any opportunity to
move in on the markets, labor,
and resources they still seek in
Southeast Asia. Runaway shops,
and the rape and pillage of foreign
countries is certainly not in the
interests of the American people.

alloted to items in response to
demands to increase our
inventory. As it stands, we offer a
selection of brands in all
merchandise lines, many of them
customer requests. We suggest the
editor visit other campus stores
and compare the sprinkling of
drug sundries they carry to the
variety we offer.
As for prices, we cannot, and
have never claimed to, compete
with big discount stores in the
area. They have storage facilities
which enable them to buy lots of
merchandise in quantities so large
that the retail price they advertise
is often lower than the wholesale
price we pay. We have a low
mark-up and are very competitive
with other similar sized
convenience stores in the area. We
are not a profit-oriented
enterprise: our objective is merely
to cover labor and overhead.
Should we exceed that, any profit
would go toward free Tresidder
services, such as the browsing
room, information desk and
meeting rooms; or toward
improved facilities or lower prices.
Another factor to consider when
talking about prices is the rip-off
rate—s3,ooo last year.
We resent the word "rotted" in
reference to the candy which
melted in our storeroom last year.
There is a difference. And the
Store employees who were
interviewed on this matter
offered, rather than "admitted,"
the fact that we have a heat
problem. This is not an attempt to
whitewash the problem. We do
need air conditioning and plans
are in progress to have it installed
by next summer.
The store is not perfect, but we
believe the editor's parting
recommendation, to forego
expansion of Tresidder services
until those already existing are
"improved dramatically" is itself a
bit pompous and theatrical. The
store has changed and will
continue to improve. The Daily
has ignored this fact consistently,
picking on the stale problems of
the past instead of honestly
reporting the present. We
welcome anyone's concrete
suggestions and criticisms.

Undermining Ceasefire
Editor:
Henry Kissinger, the U.S.
Government, and the controlled
mass media are already at work
destroying the spirit of the
Vietnam ceasefire. Whenever the
question of North Vietnamese
troops in South Vietnam comes
up, Kissinger and the press assure
us that although there is no
provision for their withdrawal,
these North Vietnamese troops
have no legal right to be in South
Vietnam.
The fact is that the most basic
compromise forced on the U.S. is
Article I of the agreement where
the U.S. recognizes the unity,
sovereignty, and territorial
integrity of Vietnam, as set forth
in the 1954 Geneva Agreements.
This means that the U.S.
recognizes that Vietnam is one
country and any divisions are
temporary conveniences.
It further means that there is
nothing illegal about DRV troops
backing up the NLF-PRG as long
as they do not initiate aggressive
armed action while the ceasefire is
in effect. But it is much more
likely that Thieu, like his

predecessor Diem, will begin
military action against the NLF,
since his tyrannical rule will be
unable to keep down the
revolutionary and progressive
ideas among the non-communist
Vietnamese. There will be unrest
in Thieu's domain—from political
prisoners, veterans, Bhuddhists,
and all kinds of political
groups—which will intensify with
time.
If the honest sections of our
people recognize the distortions
of the agreement that are already
flying around the mass media, it
will help insure that the
Vietnamese people are left to
settle their own affairs. Let's not
give Nixon and the monopoly
corporations any opportunity to
move in on the markets, labor,
and resources they still seek in
Southeast Asia. Runaway shops,
and the rape and pillage of foreign
countries is certainly not in the
interests of the American people.

No Change Since 1906
Editor:
I was pleased to see the Daily
article (Jan. 22) on "Competitive
Atmosphere Encourages .. .
Among Premeds." This subject
and the many attending problems
associated with the large
percentage of students choosing
biologically oriented curricula
here at Stanford and in the
country as a whole needs further
discussion. However, there was a
statement in this article which
needs correction.
It was stated that "Chemistry
lab space here has tripled in the
last three years. If students want a
course we'll find some way to give
it." The latter assertion is correct,
although "want" should have
been "need or require." However,
the statement that laboratory
space in Chemistry has tripled in
the last three years is completely
wrong. The number of
undergraduate students in
Chemistry laboratories has tripled
but the Chemistry undergraduate
laboratory space has not changed
appreciably since 1906 when the
present structure was
reconstructed after the
earthquake.
All undergraduate laboratory
space is now being used forty
hours per week. This quarter
evening Chemistry laboratory
sessions are being given four
nights a week for the first time.
These increasing numbers have
been accommodated with some
difficulty; we hope that our
students will be understanding
while these problems are being
worked out. The inconvenience to
all would have been very much
worse if it were not for the
concern of the Chemistry
Department and our very
dedicated group of excellent
Graduate Teaching Assistants.

Recruiting Proposal
Editor:
One of the most challenged
principles in today's society is the
public's right to know. In order to
buttress this principle, in our own
community, I would like to
propose a change in current
regulations concerning the
operation of the Career Planning
and Placement Center. Below is
the text of my proposal:
1) If at least ten days before
the arrival of any company's or
organization's recruiters, a
petition with at least fifty (50)
signatures of members of the
Stanford Community is presented
to the Office of Career Planning
and Placement, that office will
contact the company or
organization and inform it that to
recruit at Stanford either the
recruiter or another representative
of the company will be required
to hold an open meeting prior to
recruiting to discuss company
policies and practices.
2) If the company or
organization does not comply
with this requirement, its
recruiters will not be allowed on
campus.
Such a regulation would
guarantee the right of the
Stanford community to inquire
into the policies and practices of
companies or organizations using
Stanford Placement facilities. It
would also be consistent with
University policies against other
forms of information such as
classified research.
I would hope that this proposal
could be placed on a future
agenda of the Committee on
Student Services for action.
