# Senate Denies Funds For Bach Mai
## 
### SUE KING 
In a close roll-call vote
Tuesday night, the ASSU Senate
defeated a proposal to transfer
$50 from the Senate
Discretionary Fund to the Bach
Mai Fund.
The Senate also defeated a
motion to place Resolution 73-5
on the ballot of the next regularly
scheduled election. This
resolution, introduced by senator
David Levine, condemns the
recent bombing of North Vietnam
and endorses the efforts of groups
in the Palo Alto area to raise
funds to repair the damage.
When it was tabled, ASSU
Vice-President Brent Appel
accused the Senate of refusing to
debate on Levine's resolution and
made the motion to present it to

the students to vote on.
After the meeting Appel said
that he would mass circulate
petitions asking for a special
election for the two motions. He
commented, "On both these
resolutions I feel the Senate is
completely out of line with the
student body and I hope that
concerned students will look at
the roll-call votes and put pressure
on the senators who voted 'no'. I
would prefer not to hold a special
election because of the expense

involved but I may be willing to
appeal to the student body if
necessary."
In other business the Senate
elected three members to the
Nominations Committee and heard
a report on the Sunday Flicks
from Flicks Manager Baker Terry.
Frank Brokaw and Michael
Herman were elected to the
Nominations Commmittee,
replacing Peter Van Pet ten and
Sonny Tuel. Rischa Williams, who
has served on the committee for

two years, was the third member
to be elected to the committee.
Terry reported that he is
considering the idea of selling
season passes to the Flicks next
quarter. He feels that it would be
a reward for consistent customers
if season ticket holders were let in
five minutes before people with
regular tickets. Terry emphasized
that the passes would be
transferable because "the idea is
not to rip someone off for the
Flicks."
