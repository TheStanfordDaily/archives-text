# SLAC Ring Reaches Record High
## 
### 
The highest electron-positron beam intensities
ever obtained in accelerator storage rings have just
been recorded by the SPEAR ring at the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC), according to an
announcement last Monday, by Prof. Wolfgang K.H.
Panofsky, director of the center.
The SPEAR storage ring, containing electron and
positron beams circulating in opposite directions at
2.6 billion volts, attained a "luminosity" or
potential interaction rate for particles in the two
beams of (ten octillion) per square centimeter
per second.
Although even physicists find it difficult to
comprehend such a figure, they explain that the
SPEAR achievement is of major significance because
of the enormously increased number of
experimental annihilations of matter this makes

possible.
When matter (the electrons) and anti-matter (the
positrons) collide head-on, they annihilate each
other. This produces an intermediate state of pure
energy—a tiny but extremely hot fireball—which can
result in a variety of other states of matter as it
decays.
Physicists are eager to study large numbers of
these final particle states, hoping this will tell them
more about the fundamental nature of all matter.
SPEAR will provide "hundreds" of such
annihilations per hour, according to SLAC Prof.
Burton Richter, who heads the SPEAR project. It is
the first storage ring in the world to reach such high
luminosity and do it with a beam current of 25
milliamperes—loo times less than a conventional
ring would have required.
