Stennis In Very Serious Condition
WASHINGTON - Sen. John C. Stennis (D-Miss.), who
was shot twice during a robbery, was reported still in very
serious condition yesterday but doing well in view of the
extensive wounds and subsequent surgery.
Stennis, 71, chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee and a powerful member of Congress, was shot
in the chest and thigh by two young men who accosted
him outside his Washington home Tuesday night.
A spokesman at Walter Reed Army Medical Center,
where Stennis was taken, told an afternoon briefing that
Stennis is "conscious, responsive and well-oriented to his
surroundings."
The hospital spokesman said Stennis' vital signs were
stable, referring to heart beat, blood pressure and
respiration.
He described the wound in the thigh as a flesh wound.
The other bullet, he said, entered Stennis' left side "in the
vicinity of the lower rib cage and followed a general
downward path. It passed through the mid-portion of the
stomach, then through the pancreas which lies behind the
stomach. In its passage the bullet damaged a major vein
which empties blood from the intestinal tract. The bullet
then passed through the first portion of the right flank.
"Its presence creates no problem," the spokesman said.
N. Viet Forces Attack DMZ
SAIGON — Powerful North Vietnamese forces launched
new attacks along the demilitarized zone yesterday in a
violation of the still-unsupervised cease-fire, field reports
said.
The fresh fighting came as the peace agreement passed
its fourth day of continuing but declining violations and
officials disclosed plans for more U.S. meetings with both
Vietnams to prepare for postwar relations.
President Nixon said he will hold a summit meeting
with President Nguyen Van Thieu and also announced he
is dispatching Henry A. Kissinger to Hanoi to open
postwar communications with the North Vietnamese and
discuss reconstruction.
Battlefield reports reaching Saigon said North
Vietnamese troops overran South Vietnam marine
positions re-established just before the cease-fire as a new
eastern anchor on the northern defense line at the mouth
of the Cua Viet estuary, four miles below the
demilitarized zone. About 90 marines were reported
killed, wounded or missing.
Despite the heavy fighting along the demilitarized
zone, the Saigon command reported alleged cease-fire
violations dropped over-all in South Vietnam by one-third
to little more than 200 during the last 24 hours.
Nixon Defends Spending Policies
WASHINGTON - President Nixon said yesterday the
American taxpayer already is overburdened and the
president has a right to impound funds if the spending
would mean higher taxes.
The constitutional right to impound, or refuse to
spend, funds appropriated by Congress is clear, he said.
Nixon spoke out at a news conference, when he was
asked to respond to critics who say that his impoundment

of funds abrogates power or authority that the
constitution gave to Congress.
Claiming that Congress represents special interests,
Nixon said he will represent the general interest of the
nation and that the interest "whether it be rich or poor or
old, is don't break the family budget by raising the taxes
or raising prices."
Therefore, the President said, "I will not spend money
if the Congress overspends, and I will not be for programs
that will raise the taxes and put a bigger burden on the
already overburdened American taxpayer."
Stable Cease-Fire Predicted
WASHINGTON — Secretary of Defense Elliot L.
Richardson yesterday predicted the shaky cease-fire in
Vietnam will evolve into "a pretty stable situation" by
next week.
"The situation generally seems to be moving in an
encouraging direction" with hostilities being reduced
day-by-day, Richardson told newsmen in his second day
on the job.
Richardson, who formerly headed the Department of
Health, Education and Welfare, will allow some reductions
in the new Pentagon budget for fiscal 1974.
"I don't want to hold out the prospect that the
cessation of hostilities in South Vietnam will have a
massive impact on our budget requests, but certainly we
do need to review them in the light of the situation," he
said.
European Nations Organize Talks
VIENNA — Delegates from nations of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact met yesterday
for the first time to organize talks on cutting the armed
forces in Europe.
The meeting in the Hofburg, once the palace of the
emperors of Austria, was described as informal. Each of
the 19 delegations spoke, but no progress in solving
organizational problems was reported.
Jonathan Dean, head of the U.S. delegation, told
reporters as he entered the meeting: "We have been
pressing for this a long time. We are going to do our best
to give it a constructive outcome. We are only at the
beginning."
Soviet chief delegate Oleg N. Khlestov told reporters,
'The Soviet Union attaches great importance to these
consultations, having in mind that an agreement about a
reduction of armed forces and armaments in Europe
would promote the process of further lessening of tension
on the European continent, the cause of strengthening
world peace."
