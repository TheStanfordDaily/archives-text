# Venceremos Dynamite Link Contradicted By Reports
## 
### 
Photostats of a San Bernardino County Sheriff's report contradict
previous newspaper stories that Venceremos might have buried a
170-pound cache of dynamite found near Bakersfield to use for
"revolutionary purposes."
According to articles which appeared in the Daily and the Los Angeles
Times, former Venceremos member Ronald Wayne Beaty told authorities
that the cache was intended for Venceremos' use, and did not make clear
whether it was buried by the organization.
However, the report, obtained by Venceremos attorneys, tells a
different story.
It says that Beaty — now serving a life sentence after pleading guilty to
murder charges stemming from his escape from Chino prison — was told
about the cache by another Chino inmate. After his escape, he said, he and
former Venceremos member Jean Hobson unsuccessfully attempted to
locate it.
He did not implicate Venceremos in either the gathering or buying of
the explosives, according to the report.
A second police report says that Beaty has identified the voice of fired
English Prof. H. Bruce Franklin as the person he talked with by telephone
after his escape.
The tape Beaty identified came from a Franklin appearance at a Palo
Alto City Council meeting. Beaty selected the tape from four others of
police officers reciting the same words.
In his confession, Beaty allegedly accused Franklin of organizing a
series of trips that took the convict to Arizona.
Franklin was arrested in Menlo Park on Dec. 19 on federal charges of
harboring a fugitive. The charges against him were subsequently dropped,
but there is speculation that the government may be awaiting a federal
grand jury indictment of him.
