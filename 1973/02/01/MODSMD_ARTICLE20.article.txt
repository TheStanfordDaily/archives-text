# Witness Says Pentagon Forced Removal Of 'Exculpatory' Files
## 
### ED KOHN 
A defense witness at the "Pentagon
Papers" trial in Los Angeles testified
yesterday that several secret analyses
of the "Papers" he prepared were
ordered purged from Pentagon files.
The defense contends that the
analyses contain "exculpatory
material" that could help prove its
contention that the release of the
"Papers" did not damage the national
defense.
Retired Air Force Lt. Col. Edward
A. Miller said he prepared analyses of
nine volumes of the "Papers" while he
worked in the Pentagons Office of
Security Review in December, 1971.
Miller said he received instructions
on how to prepare the analyses —
which the defense earlier claimed took
one week to prepare — during a Dec.
15, 1971 meeting in the office of an
assistant Defense Department counsel,
Frank A. Bartimo.
Bartimo, who was the government's
first witness when testimony in the
trial began two weeks ago, has testified
at least twice that he attended no such
meeting and that his office was used
for no such meetings.
Office Logs 'Destroyed'
However, he told presiding Judge
Matt Byrne Jr. Tuesday that his
"office logs" for 1971 "were
destroyed." He did not elaborate.

Defense attorney Charles Nesson
Tuesday accused the Defense
Department's general counsel, J. Fred
Buzhardt, of ordering Miller's studies
stricken from Defense Department
files because they demonstrated that
the release of the "Papers" did not
damage the national defense.
Nesson offered to prove that
Buzhardt made the request to
Pentagon spokesman Jerry W.
Friedheim, who in turn passed it on to
Charles Hinkle, director of the
Pentagon's Office of Security Review.
That office's normal function is to
review books and speeches prior to
their release.
Removal Of Reports Ordered?
Hinkle, Nesson claimed, ordered
the reports removed from Pentagon
files and dictated a memorandum to
his own personal files about the
matter. Nesson told Byrne that Miller
had seen the memo and discussed it
with Hinkle, who, Nessen said,
admitted writing it.
During cross-examination Tuesday,
Buzhardt told the court that he had
made no such request of Friedheim or
anyone else in the Defense
Department. He said he hadn't seen or
heard of Miller's analyses until 12
hours before his testimony.
Buzhardt testified that Miller's
studies were "not official" and that

Miller apparently had done them to
occupy his spare time.
The defense has been seeking the
analyses, sometimes referred to as
"damage reports" by the Defense
Department, since April, 1972. Byrne
has issued several orders that all such
material be turned over to him for
in-chambers examination. Under the
terms of a 1963 Supreme Court ruling,
all prosecution reports containing
exculpatory material must be given to
the defense.
So far, the government had
submitted 37 analyses to Byrne for in
camera examination. Byrne, in turn,
has ruled that 11 of the studies
contain exculpatory material and has
turned these studies over to the
defense. He has reserved decision on at
least 15 other reports.
Ellsberg and Russo are charged with
conspiracy and theft of government
property for allegedly duplicating and
distributing copies of 18 volumes of
the "Papers" and two other Defense
Department documents, all of which
had been classified "Top Secret."
The government contends that the
release of the documents was harmful
to the national defense.
The jury has not heard any of this
week's witnesses. Judge Byrne
yesterday excused them until 9:30
Monday morning.

analyses, sometimes referred to as
"damage reports" by the Defense
Department, since April, 1972. Byrne
has issued several orders that all such
material be turned over to him for
in-chambers examination. Under the
terms of a 1963 Supreme Court ruling,
all prosecution reports containing
exculpatory material must be given to
the defense.
So far, the government had
submitted 37 analyses to Byrne for in
camera examination. Byrne, in turn,
has ruled that 11 of the studies
contain exculpatory material and has
turned these studies over to the
defense. He has reserved decision on at
least 15 other reports.
Ellsberg and Russo are charged with
conspiracy and theft of government
property for allegedly duplicating and
distributing copies of 18 volumes of
the "Papers" and two other Defense
Department documents, all of which
had been classified "Top Secret."
The government contends that the
release of the documents was harmful
to the national defense.
The jury has not heard any of this
week's witnesses. Judge Byrne
yesterday excused them until 9:30
Monday morning.
A defense witness at the "Pentagon
Papers" trial in Los Angeles testified
yesterday that several secret analyses
of the "Papers" he prepared were
ordered purged from Pentagon files.
The defense contends that the
analyses contain "exculpatory
material" that could help prove its
contention that the release of the
"Papers" did not damage the national
defense.
Retired Air Force Lt. Col. Edward
A. Miller said he prepared analyses of
nine volumes of the "Papers" while he
worked in the Pentagons Office of
Security Review in December, 1971.
Miller said he received instructions
on how to prepare the analyses —
which the defense earlier claimed took
one week to prepare — during a Dec.
15, 1971 meeting in the office of an
assistant Defense Department counsel,
Frank A. Bartimo.
Bartimo, who was the government's
first witness when testimony in the
trial began two weeks ago, has testified
at least twice that he attended no such
meeting and that his office was used
for no such meetings.
Office Logs 'Destroyed'
However, he told presiding Judge
Matt Byrne Jr. Tuesday that his
"office logs" for 1971 "were
destroyed." He did not elaborate.

Defense attorney Charles Nesson
Tuesday accused the Defense
Department's general counsel, J. Fred
Buzhardt, of ordering Miller's studies
stricken from Defense Department
files because they demonstrated that
the release of the "Papers" did not
damage the national defense.
Nesson offered to prove that
Buzhardt made the request to
Pentagon spokesman Jerry W.
Friedheim, who in turn passed it on to
Charles Hinkle, director of the
Pentagon's Office of Security Review.
That office's normal function is to
review books and speeches prior to
their release.
Removal Of Reports Ordered?
Hinkle, Nesson claimed, ordered
the reports removed from Pentagon
files and dictated a memorandum to
his own personal files about the
matter. Nesson told Byrne that Miller
had seen the memo and discussed it
with Hinkle, who, Nessen said,
admitted writing it.
During cross-examination Tuesday,
Buzhardt told the court that he had
made no such request of Friedheim or
anyone else in the Defense
Department. He said he hadn't seen or
heard of Miller's analyses until 12
hours before his testimony.
Buzhardt testified that Miller's
studies were "not official" and that

Miller apparently had done them to
occupy his spare time.

analyses, sometimes referred to as
