The day before Christmas, they
deliver cakes and fruits to students
staying on campus. During finals week,
at the request of concerned parents,
they bring "care packages" containing
candy and cookies. The rest of the
year they plan parties, give luncheons
and sell cookbooks to earn over
$14,000 annually to donate to the
University.
For 49 years, the Stanford Mothers'
Club has been dedicated to
"promoting the welfare of the student
body," according to spokesman
Mildred Schubert.
Although there are branches in
Oakland, Los Angeles, Portland, and
Seattle, Schubert points out, "Ours
(located at Stanford] is the parent
club — the others are offshoots."

All mothers of Stanford students
(undergraduate and graduate)
throughout the U.S. and in foreign
countries are invited by letter to join
the "parent" club — "Anyone can
join, whether they have children or
not," Schubert commented. "Many
members have children who have long
since graduated."
The club claims only 890 members

because, she said, "distance is a great
factor. 1 think if people were across
country, they'd find it difficult to jo"*
an organization they'd never been
direct contact with."
Not Like PTA
Schubert says the club's function is
to "bring together Stanford parents, to
inform them what University life is
like." She emphasizes that the

mothers' club is not like a PTA: "We
do nothing administrative as far as
establishing any formal policy."
The monthly meetings, each
attended by an average of 150
mothers, are free and feature guest
speakers. Upcoming lectures include
Dr. Herant Katchadourian on "Sex
Education at Stanford," and Jewell

from the bride's father.
