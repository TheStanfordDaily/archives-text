# Mothers' Club Dispenses Treats', Seeks To Boost Student Morale

The day before Christmas, they
deliver cakes and fruits to students
staying on campus. During finals week,
at the request of concerned parents,
they bring "care packages" containing
candy and cookies. The rest of the
year they plan parties, give luncheons
and sell cookbooks to earn over
$14,000 annually to donate to the
University.
For 49 years, the Stanford Mothers'
Club has been dedicated to
"promoting the welfare of the student
body," according to spokesman
Mildred Schubert.
Although there are branches in
Oakland, Los Angeles, Portland, and
Seattle, Schubert points out, "Ours
(located at Stanford] is the parent
club — the others are offshoots."

All mothers of Stanford students
(undergraduate and graduate)
throughout the U.S. and in foreign
countries are invited by letter to join
the "parent" club — "Anyone can
join, whether they have children or
not," Schubert commented. "Many
members have children who have long
since graduated."
The club claims only 890 members

because, she said, "distance is a great
factor. 1 think if people were across
country, they'd find it difficult to jo"*
an organization they'd never been
direct contact with."
Not Like PTA
Schubert says the club's function is
to "bring together Stanford parents, to
inform them what University life is
like." She emphasizes that the

mothers' club is not like a PTA: "We
do nothing administrative as far as
establishing any formal policy."
The monthly meetings, each
attended by an average of 150
mothers, are free and feature guest
speakers. Upcoming lectures include
Dr. Herant Katchadourian on "Sex
Education at Stanford," and Jewell

lunch is provided do members have to
pay to attend.
Last year, the organization granted
three full scholarships (awarded by the
financial aids office) and provided over
$4000 to aid the International Center,
library system and Cowell Health
Center in purchasing books and
magazines. "Fund raising is always a
primary purpose," Schubert stated.
The money is collected mainly
through letters of solicitation and
social gatherings.
A popular money-maker is Easy
Gourmet From Stanford, a cookbook

prepared by four mothers, who
advertised for "simple but elegant"
recipes, tested each one, and put them
into print. The book, selling for $2.95,
recently came out in braille.
The greatest amount of money is

usually raised at the "Phantom Party"
held each spring, which Schubert
called "just a gimmick." Invitations to
a non-existent party are sent out to
each member — in reality, they are
simply requests for money.
