# Nursing Task Force Recommends Replacing Bachelor's Program
## 
### BRUCE KADDEN 
A task force on nursing education has recommended a
plan in which the bachelor of nursing program, in
existence since 1917, would be phased out and replaced
by a two-year graduate program offering a master of
science degree in nursing.
In a report to Dean Clayton Rich of the School of
Medicine, the 12-member group wrote that nursing at
Stanford must be a contributing segment of the Medical
Center marked by strong research emphasis, a high degree
of specialization, and a ifocus on complex medical care.
"It is at the graduate level that nursing would
complement the School of Medicine and the surrounding
health care milieu," the report said.
If adopted, the new graduate program will admit its
first students in the fall of 1974. Rich is studying the
report and will forward it to Provost William Miller in the
near future.
Current Program Small
Susan J. Brueckner, task force chairman and nursing
project coordinator at the University Hospital, said the
present program is small and has little effect on the overall
health care delivery system.
"But the impact of graduating 30 advanced clinicians
prepared for expanded roles in health delivery would be
substantial," she said.
The task force recommended that nurses at the
graduate level should be prepared for new roles as clinical

specialists, with stronger emphasis on research.
They would work interdependently with physicians,
assuming some of the functions ordinarily performed by
the physician, and would obtain health histories, manage
treatment for the chronically ill and participate in
preventive medicine efforts.
Supervisory Roles
The clinical specialists would also be prepared to
assume supervisory roles in nursing care units, including
the assessment of nursing care needs of patients and
development of innovative methods in nursing care.
Rich said the task force turned out a "good report"
that would mean graduating "nurses with more skills."
Currently, 40-60 students per year receive their
bachelor's degree in nursing. The new program would
admit 30 students each year.
Students who are currently enrolled in the
baccalaureate program will be able to complete it at
Stanford. Nursing school admissions were curtailed last
fall pending the task force report, and no new students
will be admitted this fall.
Master's Degree
The report envisions students first receiving a bachelor
of nursing degree at another university and then working
toward their master's degree in the graduate school
program here. There would be no undergraduate degree
offered at Stanford leading to this program.
Many nursing schools have changed their curriculum
recently by adding or substituting a master's program.
