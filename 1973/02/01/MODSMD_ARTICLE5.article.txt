# Village Undergoes Dramatic Changes Profs. Investigate German Settlement
## 
### MELODY BROADBENT 
Anthropology Profs. George and
Louise Spindler based their latest
project — using Stanford-in-Germany
students to help in research — on the
premise that it is most important "to
develop something with a sense of
discovery."
From their 14-year collaboration
has emerged a book entitled Burgbach:
Urbanization and Identity in a German
Village, which is to be published in
April. The name Burgbach was
substituted for the actual name of the

village, Beutelsbach, to protect it from
casual tourists.
The book will focus on the cultural
and social changes in the German town
that occurred after its post-World War
II resettlement and subsequent
population increase.
While Burgbach had been relatively
homogeneous before the war, it
suddenly shifted from an agricultural
to an industrial economy. The book
will examine the impact of such
innovations as new forms of housing
and transportation built to serve the

inflex of factory workers.
The purpose of the forthcoming
book is to analyze the experience of
modernization on a small village. The
book states, "This is a study of the
confrontation of the past and future in
a village in South Germany, one of
the many in Europe and elsewhere in
the world where dramatic urbanization
and industrialization are taking place
and a traditional folk community is
being overwhelmed by
modernization."
Data collection was done as a part

of the course work at
Stan ford-in-Germany while the
Spindlers taught there. The basic
theme of the book, said Spindler, will
be how "the culture of the area, the
Swabian culture of small village, land
and vineyard has persisted for
centuries, how a strong identity
developed, and how this identity is
being submerged by massive
urbanization."
Spindler had nothing but praise for
his unusual "research assistants."
Unusual Experience
"I think it was an unusual
educational experience for all of us,
and the result is unusual. It has some
significance, I think, as one of the
ways the overseas campuses could have
been, and still could be, more than
they sometimes were," he said.
In Spindler's opinion, the manner
in which the project was conducted
can be linked to the current discussion
of the overseas campuses. Me said,
"The overseas program was beautifully
constructed, except for a few defects."
According to the Spindlers, "the
principal defect is that the
instructional program may not be
relevant to the particular country and
region in which the campus is located.
"All social sciences have the
opportunity to make the study of the
national culture and regional system
the primary focus of what the students
do," he says.
He suggests that student-directed
research could be applied at each
campus to the local culture, to great
benefit for students and faculty.
He stresses, though, that the real
native culture is not available in the
cities, and thus he questions
recommendations made by the
Committee on Foreign Study
Programs' that campus sites be located
in exclusively urban areas. This might
rob the students of the opportunity to
"participate with folk in a real
experience."
