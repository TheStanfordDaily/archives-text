# PA Plan Commission Nixes Stanford Plea
## 
### ROBERT BACON 
The Palo Alto Planning Commission
last night, contrary to Stanford's
request, recommended that four
industrial lots in the Stanford-owned
Coyote Hill Industrial Park be placed
in an agricultural zone.
The four lots are under a scenic
restriction which prohibits
development for 20 years, or, on one
of the lots, 51 years. Stanford sought
to have them placed in a design
control district, retaining their L-M-5
(industrial) designation but subjected
to stringent design control
requirements on any buildings.
Heeding Commissioner Frances
Brenner's plea to conform zoning to
the reality of the scenic restriction, the
Commission voted 5-1 to ask the City
Council to zone the four lots A-C
(agricultural conservation).
Appearing for the University,
Associate Staff Counsel Michael
Hudnall pointed out that should the
property be condemned for public use,
the scfcnic restriction would lapse and
StanfclM would receive a much larger
reimbursement under L-M-5-D
(industrial with design control) than
under A-C.
The four lots are on the west side
of the hill, which is located just above
the Stanford Industrial Park.
Other Requests
The commission endorsed, at

Stanford's request, the L-M-5-I)
designation for three other lots on the
east and south sides of the hill, and
A-C zoning for the top of the hill.
Three of the four lots for which
A-C zoning was recommended are
classed as open space in Palo Alto's
general plan, and Commission
Chairman Mary Gordon stated that
"we have the responsibility to bring
zoning into conformity with the
general plan."
As Hudnall pointed out, the fourth
lot, north of Coyote Hill Road, is
classed for industrial use in the general
plan, however.
Rack Dissented
Commissioner Frank Rack was the
only dissenter. He echoed HudnaH's
concern that Stanford be able to
obtain maximum industrial value for
the land should it be condemned.
Stanford requested the zone change
as part of an out-of-court settlement
of an anti-development lawsuit
brought in 1969 by the Committee for
Green Foothills. The scenic
restrictions were also imposed by that
settlement.
Hudnall stressed that the scenic
restrictions represented a considerable
financial sacrifice to the University in
the interest of open space. "It's a very
heavy loss we're taking in meeting
community needs here," he pointed
out in urging that L-M-5-D zoning be
granted.
The City Council, final authority
over zoning, will consider the Planning
Commission's recommendations Feb.
26.
The only public witness to testify
at the meeting was John F. Porter of

the steering committee of the Palo
Alto Civic League. He supported the
majority position in favor of A-C
zoning of the west side lots.
He doubted that A-C classification
would significantly lower the value to
Stanford in the event of a
condemnation but, when pressed, was
unable to cite evidence for that view.
