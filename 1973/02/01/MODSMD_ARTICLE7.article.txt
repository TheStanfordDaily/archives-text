## Two Tunnels 
### 
In recent years many alumni have bepn deeply distressed by the
behavior of Stanford students and the University's administration and
faculty who tolerate, and perhaps even like, many of them. Students
have had the audacity to demand "relevant" courses, to challenge
established authority, to turn their backs on older notions of
decorum, even to sneer at alumni traditions. Unfortunately, these
students have not been banished from the campus; few have even been
chastised. Many alumni have rightly felt that their cherished
values—their conception of a university—have been repudiated by
brash newcomers.
Fortunately, there is now some evidence that important segments
of the University are returning to a sense of responsibility and
recognizing the importance of alumni and the keenness of their
criticisms. The most recent, and perhaps the most heartening,
evidence is that the University administration and trustees have
decided to spend $400,000 building two tunnels into the stadium so
that alumni rooters will no longer have to walk to the top of the
stadium in order to get to their low seats. This bold, and greatly
overdue, action is precisely the much-needed reordering of priorities
that so many have justifiably demanded. It represents a recognition of
the importance of alumni to the maintenance of this great
University—and suggests the opening of a new era in which
time-honored values will again receive respect: sports in general
above all, and football in particular, which (as all Americans know)
Build Character.
Alternatives
The inevitable short-sighted critics may argue that the money could
have been better spent—say, to hire forty instructors to teach
literature or western civilization to small groups of undergraduates; to
refurbish a hundred classrooms; or to add 40,000 books to the library.
But careful reflection will indicate that none of these acts could
contribute as directly and meaningfully to the maintenance of this
great University as two tunnels in the stadium. Who really needs more
teachers, better classroom facilities, or more books? What have
they to do with greatness?
For the University's greatness lies in its preservation of our
civilization; the proof of its success, the success of its alumni who rise
to prominence in the corporations and councils of this great nation.
Civilization
These men and women recognize the importance of spectator
sports and have placed them at the forefront of American life. They
have elevated football to a celebration of national community far
outshining the circuses of Rome and the cultural celebrations of
Greece.
Could there possibly be any higher purpose to the University, any
nobler allocation of resources, than towards the preservation of this
great tradition?
