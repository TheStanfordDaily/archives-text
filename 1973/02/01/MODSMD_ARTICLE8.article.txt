# After Vietnam
## A New Isolationism?
### 
Much discussion of foreign
affairs in recent years has been on
the specifics of the Indochina war,
but some critics of the war have
been able to raise larger questions.
In response to these larger
questions about the general
direction of American foreign
policy, political figures from Dean
Rusk of the Johnson
administration to Spiro Agnew of
the Nixon administration have
spoken about the dangers of
neoisolationism.
But in fact, it is only through a
return to the glorious American
tradition of an isolationist foreign
policy that wars like the
Indochina war can be avoided in
the future.
Obstacles
The first obstacle which lies in
the way of a return to
isolationism is widespread
misunderstanding of what the
word means.
As Robert W. Tucker writes in
his recent book A New
Isolationism: "Isolationism is not
to be identified with 'quitting the
world,' something we
(Americans] have never done and
will never do. It is not to be
identified with the absence of all
significant relationships, but,
rather, with the absence of certain
relationships.
"As a policy, isolationism is
above all generally characterized
by the refusal to enter into
alliances and to undertake
military interventions. This was
the essential meaning of an
isolationist policy in the past, and
it remains the essential meaning of
an isolationist policy today."
History
The same non-interventionist
position can be found in the
formula that British libertarian
Richard Cobden gave for his

foreign policy views in 1836: "As
little intercourse as possible
betwixt the Governments, as
much connection as possible
between the nations of the
world."
The second obstacle to a
revival of isolationism is an
inadequate understanding of the

and economic disorder was a
corrupt relationship between
business and aristocracy and the
government."
Cleveland viewed it as his
central task in both domestic and
foreign affairs to prevent the
distribution of new privileges to
businessmen and others, and to

Bill Evers

Immediately on becoming
President for his second term, he
withdrew the Hawaiian
annexation treaty that the
previous Republican
administration had put before the
Senate.
Repudiating the political
takeover of Hawaii by some
American commercial interests, he
declared that "right and justice"
and "national honesty" should be
the only touchstones in the
foreign policy of the United
States. "The law of nations is
founded upon reason and justice,
and the rules of conduct
governing individual relations
between citizens or subjects of a
civilized state are equally
applicable as between enlightened
nations."
Principles of the sort that
Cleveland possessed are what the
American public should demand
of American politicians today.
Cleveland's non-interventionism
was a corollary of his belief in
independent and voluntarily
chosen social institutions: "The
use of power in the extension of
American institutions presents an
inconsistency whose evil and
dangerous tendency ought to be
apparent to all those who love
these institutions and understand
their motives and purposes."
This was a lesson which
Cleveland's successors—especially
McKinley, Wilson, Franklin
Roosevelt, Truman, and Lyndon
Johnson—did not accept. Their
ideas and interests led them to
intervene militarily all over the
globe. It is only by a return to the
isolationist, non-interventionist
principles of a man like Cleveland
that future Vietnams will be
avoided.
