history of non-interventionism
and its heroic champions.
As a specific instance I would
like to take President Grover
Cleveland. While his record in
foreign policy was not perfect, the
policies of his administrations
(especially his first) contrast
sharply with the imperialistic,
interventionist policies of
American Presidents during the
twentieth century.
Privileges
Cleveland and many of his
political associates took an
approach to political events that
went right to the roots. Robert
Kelley in The Transatlantic
Persuasion identifies their analytic
framework well when he says that
"Cleveland, the British Liberals,
and the Jacksonians were moved
by a political world view that
concentrated most of its force in
one central conviction: that the
root cause of social oppression

take away the privileges that
previous administrations had
granted.
Thus the Cleveland
administration could instruct one
of its ambassadors to "abstain
from using your diplomatic
position to promote (American)
financial or business enterprises."
This remarkably wise general
policy had then and would have
now (if adopted anew) the
salutary effect of disentangling
the American government from
American commercial interests
abroad. Such entanglement has
been a source of interventions in
foreign countries in the past.
Withdrawal
As President, Cleveland
withdrew from an isthmian canal
treaty with Nicaragua that had
been proposed by his predecessors
in office. He did so on the ground
that the treaty arrangements were
coercive and expansionist.
