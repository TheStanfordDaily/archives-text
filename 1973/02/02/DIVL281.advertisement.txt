ATTENTION CADETS!!!
Stanford undergraduates who formerly at
tended one of the US military academies: I'd
like to meet with you as a group to compare
stories and experiences as the basis for a
Daily story. Please call Boh Litterman this

MARATHON
This weekend can be different. We'll spend 40
hours, non-stop, in a marathon experience. Vic
Lovell, Ph.D.. will lead us in psychodrama,
gestalt and encounter. Is the inner me really
different from the inner you? How often do we
experience more than Inner Quad? A marathon
is exciting; can be profound. Call Prometheus,
328-6137, and ask Susan more about it. It's 145
for students, and we'll go from midnight on
Friday 2nd till Sunday afternoon at 401
Florence, Palo Alto.
