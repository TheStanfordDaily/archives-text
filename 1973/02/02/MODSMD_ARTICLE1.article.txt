# Vietnam Vets Express Contrasting War Views
## 
### ROBERT MOULTON 
Linked by common experience,
Vietnam veterans Dan Higgins and
Sonny Tuel are a study in contrast.
Told in July of 1969 that he would
never walk again, Dan Higgins has
defied such prophecy, and is now
walking with a limp.
Higgins, now 24, is a senior
majoring in philosophy. "It is very
difficult for me to have some
meaningful mutual communication
with most undergraduates I have met."
Accordinly, Higgins has few friends on
campus and considers his closest ones
to be in the 28-35 age group. When he
recounts his 4'/2-month Vietnam duty,
most undergraduates are infused with
a sense of disbelief. "In their eyes you
become first and foremost an
ex-soldier. Almost like a zoo animal."
Higgins credits the Stanford
community for confirming his own
anti-war feelings. "The anti-war
movement here made my views more
sophisticated as well as producing a
certain amount of guilt that had not
surfaced before. However, to veterans,
there is a very noticeable gap between
what people who have not experienced
war and militarism think it is versus
their actual components. That's
certainly not to say it's more
desirable!"
Ambush Leader
Serving in the 173 rd Airborne
Brigade, Higgins frequently led
nighttime ambush and reconnaissance
patrols. Attaining a rank of staff
sargeant, he was wounded twice by
gunfire and once by a mine.
Although admitting that at the time
he was "really into it," Higgins
revealed that his original attitude was
not militaristic. "At least half of the
people I knew in the service entered
under conditions of extreme duress.
They considered it an escape. The only
way out of an intolerable situation.
That's what it was for me when I went
in."
Responding to the charge of
Stanford's war complicity, Higgings
said, "I don't think that the
connection between Stanford and the
war is as strong as some people make it
to be. However, Mr. Lyman and other
presidents have not fulfilled their role
as moral leaders in the university
communities. At Stanford, I find
President Lyman sadly lacking in this
respect."
Regarding the recently negotiated
cease-fire, Higgins said, "What we did
amounted to signing another treaty.
We have not admitted to making a
mistake. We have not really refuted
the ideology that trapped and held us
there for twelve years. Indochina is
still being ruled by U.S. puppet
governments. I think it's great that the
prisoners are returning, but the
cease-fire has an extremely limited
potential to change the real scenario."
Amnesty For All
Higgins favors unconditional

amnesty for all draft evaders and
pointed out that there has been a
general amnesty granted after almost
every war. "If all men refused to fight,
then we would not have any wars.
People who deserted were for the most
part doing it out of conviction, not
cowardice. Individual courage is the
catalyst for social change."
Tuel went to Vietnam in 1968,
after completing his first year of law
school here. He embraced a different
perspective. "Coming back for me was
no cultural shock. Although there
were some new faces, I was in contact
with virtually the same group of
friends."
Tuel, now 27, is in his final year of
law school. "Most people were fairly
apathetic towards my serving in
Vietnam, they generally accepted it.
Although my anti-war friends had
their own personal views, they
respected me for acting in a manner
consistent with my principles. Given
the uniqueness of my experience, they
were eager to know the details of what
went on."
Efforts Worthwhile
Tuel claimed that the Stanford
community had virtually no effect
upon his opinions. "If there was any
change at all, my experience in
Vietnam made me more convinced
that our efforts in Vietnam were
worthwhile. I was very disappointed in
the student body; it was sad to see
that the anti-war movement had
enlisted so much support. I do not like
to see my fellow citizens support the
enemy in a time of war."
Having enlisted and volunteering
for Vietnam duty, Tuel spent six of his
eight months there in the field. He
served as a first lieutenant in the 25th
infantry division, and his platoon was
primarily engaged in search and
destroy missions.
Although he feels that the use of
ground troops was a fairly inefficient
way to fight the war, Tuel remarked,
"I am proud of what I did. I would do
it again anyplace in the world if I felt

it was necessary. I felt obligated to do
my share, yet come home alive. Air
power should have been emphasized
long before it was."
Approves Cease-Fire
Welcoming the cease-fire, Tuel said,
"I was happy to see the cease-fire
signed. It was not until the bombing of
Hanoi that the North Vietnamese were
forced to compromise certain of their
demands. The cease-fire agreement
although imperfect, is far better than
none at all. Which is precisely what we
would have had if George McGovern
had been elected.
"Any Congressional action that
would grant immunity to the North
Vietnamese would be disastrous. I
don't think that the North Vietnamese
have given up their ambitions to

issues. Higgins is a senior majoring in philosophy and Tuel is in his final year of law school.
