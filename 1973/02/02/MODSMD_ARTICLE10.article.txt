## A 						Serious Column 
### 
ass® Jerry Coleman

I have just been informed that
by the grace of the Gods, and the
new opinions editor in particular,
I will be able to keep my column
a while longer. Some of you may
want to curse, others dance in the
street, perhaps; but the majority
could care less.
This opening week of a new
volume I have something to say to
all of you readers, whatever
category you may fit in. First to
you who curse: I'll make this
message mercifully short.
Heed the advice I once picked

up on a Sunday School lavatory
wall: "Don't curse the darkness;
light a candle." That means, stop
complaining about the quality of
this newspaper or my
contributions to it; write me c/o
the Daily and say what you think
should be the subjects for my
columns.
For my regular or occasional
readers I ask the same. Sitting
down week after week and
producing something that's both
funny and timely is no simple
task. There are times when I'd
rather face a bowl of strained
squash than a Monday opinions
deadline.
As for you unopinionated
masses: if nothing funny ever
happens to you, then you're
stranger than I thought. Take a
minute and send in your ideas,
happenings, fantasies. Then you 11
have something to look forward
to reading on this paper's pages.
A column is only as good as its
material. Give monkeys on
typewriters a good topic and they
can't help but produce; tell a
Hemingway or Steinbeck to write
about banana slugs in Costa Rica
and look what you get.
I believe the opinions page of
the Daily to be overly political.

Politics may be a vital element in
the campus or national society,
but it isn't everything. This
political reporting or opinion
rarely takes time to laugh at itself,
so strong is its concern in winning
converts or exposing hidden filth
and corruption.
Humor can be a political
weapon as well, but it is too
infrequently used as such. So as
long as I write for the Daily I
intend to use humor—to
propagandize, to stimulate
counter opinions, to relieve the
heartbreak of psoriasis, to
entertain and arouse laughter.
But since the news these days
is so gloomy, we have to share
what little humor there is to make
it stretch, to spread the laughter a
little farther.
Quit your griping, your
polemics, and your apathy long
enough to bring a smile to
someone's face: if it's funny,
inane, absurd, or incredible-but
true, write it down and send it to
me at the Daily and there will be a
truly representative humor
column on page two each and
every week.
Write on!

regular Daily columnist.)
