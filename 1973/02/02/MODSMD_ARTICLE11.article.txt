# No More Inductions
## Draft System Continues 
### 
® Peter Hanawalt

Defense Secretary Laird's
announcement that "use of the
draft has ended" accurately
characterizes the current
situation. Draft calls appear to be
over for the indefinite future, but
the Selective Service System and
all of its functions—except
induction—will continue with no
foreseeable end.
Laird emphasized that all
services will depend entirely on
volunteers in the future; however,
he qualified this statement with a
reference to the doctor draft.
While he did not announce a

ROUGH DRAFT

future draft call for doctors,
neither did he rule one out; he
focused on the need for Congress
to authorize pay supplements for
doctors in order to attract enough
enlistees from the medical
professions.
The authority to issue a draft
call for doctors expires on June
30, 1973, along with the regular
induction authority. In order for
doctors to be drafted after that
date, Congress would have to vote
for a special authorization.
Reserves Draft
Similar to his qualification of
the doctor draft, Laird made
reference last November to the
possibility of a special draft for
the National Guard and Reserves
after June, 1973, if Congress did
not pass legislation designed to
help boost the enlistment rate in
these programs.
However, in his announcement
Saturday, Laird made no
reference to this possible version
of continued conscription. In the
context of his other remarks, the
omission would indicate a move
away from the threat of a draft
for the Reserves, but the issue is

far from clear.
We have received many
questions concerning who, if
anyone, can still be drafted under
the provisions of Laird's
announcement.
Who's Draftable
In a period of no draft calls
such as between now and June 30,
only a violator, parolee, or
involuntarily activated Reservist
can be sent an induction order or
work order. The same conditions
will prevail after the expiration of
the induction authority (assuming
it is not renewed).

Therefore, a man who is
currently appealing his
classification, is deferred or
medically unacceptable, is
awaiting a physical examination
or the results of one, or is
awaiting a new induction or work
order after having a former one
cancelled, cannot be issued a new
order to report.
Furthermore, men who
received induction or work orders
last year and had the reporting
dates postponed until sometime in
1973 cannot be given new dates
to report. Men under such
circumstances should have their
orders cancelled. This has already
been accomplished for those with
postponements expiring in the
months of January and February.
Alternate Service
Until December 1, 1972, a
conscientious objector was given a
60-day period in which to find an
approvable job; only after that
period could he be issued a work
order (Form 153). A c.o. who
began that 60-day period during
1972, but who was not issued
Form 153 during 1972, cannot
now be issued Form 153. He is in

the same situation as a c.o. who
has had no processing toward an
alternate service assignment.
One fairly small group of
registrants is still vulnerable to
being assigned new reporting dates
for induction or alternate service.
This group is made up of men
who have failed to comply with
an induction or work order that
was legally issued during 1972.
The violation can be in the
form of refusal or failure to
report, and can be done
knowingly or not knowingly.
Often a registrant who did not
receive mail sent by his draft
board is termed a violator without
his prior knowledge that he was
sent an order.
These men can continue to be
given new dates to report, even
after the expiration of the draft
authority on June 30. Otherwise,
they may be considered for
prosecution for violation of the
Selective Service Act.
