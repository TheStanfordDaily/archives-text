Amnesty For Slaves
Editor:
Regarding your editorial of
January 30 on amnesty and the
draft:
Dear President Lincoln,
It is a wonderful thing that
slavery has finally been
abolished. That institution of
human bondage is no longer
necessary in a society such as
ours, and it is right that these
people now be free to live as
they choose. The topic of how
the freed slaves will fit into the
society has been much debated
over the past few years.
Unfortunately, the debate
of how they will fit in has
over-shadowed the topic of
what to do with those slaves
who ran away before they were

legally freed from their
servitude. Clearly some of the
run-aw ays fled to the North
because they opposed slavery
on moral grounds. This is fine,
and they should not be
permanently punished for
standing up for their moral
principles. However, there were
those who fled for base and
selfish reasons. Clearly this was
wrong and they should
somehow be made to pay their
debt to society. Perhaps they
can be required to work for
nominal wages on the
plantations from which they
fled for two years.
Let us guarantee justice for
all those who were enslaved,
but not allow those who
shirked their duties for base
and selfish reasons to go
unpunished.

I think the analogy fits.

Nixon Abuses Role
Editor:
Events of the past two months
have led me to question Mr.
Nixon's role as President of the
United States. In December 1972
the peace talks stalled. Without
consulting the American people,
Mr. Nixon began the most
devastating bombing raids of the
war. How convenient that
Congress was out of session and
could not bring the President to
account for his orders. World
leaders rose up in protest against
Mr. Nixon's inhumane policy. Did
the problems at the talks justify
Mr. Nixon's harsh response? I
think not.
The Administration has stated
that it will help rebuild Vietnam,
but with all the damage caused by
the recent bombing, how many
more billions of dollars will it cost
now? We have lost at least 15
B-52's, costing $8 million each. As
a physician, I can only despair of
how many hospitals and health
centers could have been built with
this now wasted money. And Mr.
Nixon is slashing funds to
numerous health programs at
home. What are his priorities?
Clearly the serving of the needs of
humanity is not among them.
The civilian tolls caused by Mr.
Nixon's bombing can never be put
in terms of dollars. The President
and the Pentagon "apologized" for
the killing of civilians in the latest
bombings, but "That's war, etc."
How Mr. Nixon can sleep at night
with 2000 persons killed because
of his policy is beyond my
comprehension. Those killed were
not "the enemy": they were
people with the same basic needs,
loves, joys, and sorrows as you or
I. So many innocent people have
already been killed in Vietnam,
why did Mr. Nixon order bombing
that unavoidably took a high
civilian toll? Where is "peace with
honor" here?
Taking together all of the
actions of Mr. Nixon, I wonder
just whom he represents. Surely
not those of us who condemn his
inhumane bombing policy. Surely
not those who believe in checks
and balances between the
Congress and the President. Surely
not medical researchers who need
federal grants to support health
care delivery projects and
research. Mr. Nixon through his
seemingly deliberate isolation
from the American people and
Congress has abused the role of
the Chief Executive. We must
work together to curtail his
excessive use of executive power
and to restore power to Congress
before the America we all love
becomes a world power that will
be uniformly condemned by all
humane, freedom-loving people.
