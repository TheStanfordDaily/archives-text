# 'Beaux Strategemâ€™ Succeeds
## 
### JEFFERY SEGAL 
When George Farquhar's last
play, "The Beaux' Strategem,"
was first produced in 1707 it was
an instant success. More than just
the last play of Farquhar's, "The
Beaux' Strategem" is considered
the last of the English Restoration
comedies.
It represents an important
transition from a style of biting
satire in which one-sided
characters representative of
particular social or personal ills
affronted one another, to a
comedy of more fully fleshed

people where the humor arises
from the follies of being human.
Characters are treated with
sympathy and understanding in
the knowledge that we cannot
wholly control those conditions
that win good fortune for us or
take it away.
The Stanford University
Theater's production of "The
Beaux' Strategem," which opened
Tuesday night, presents an
extremely enjoyable evening, if
the appreciative opening night
audience can be used as judge.
The production, however, is
plagued not only by the problems
that attend many first nights, but
also by others which are more
intrinsic to the production.
Reduced Fortunes
The action of the play centers
around two handsome young
gentlemen whose fortunes have
been reduced to merely enough
for a last, mischievous deceit.
Hoping to find themselves two
wealthy country wives, they set
out from London masquerading as
a lord and his footman.
They discover their loves and
fortunes in the end through the
unhappily married Mrs. Sullen, a
beautiful girl poorly matched with
a "sullen, silent sot," and her
equally lovely sister-in-law,
Dorinda. Their amours are
complicated further by the
intercession of the local crooked
innkeeper, his saucy daughter, and
a motley crew of rather inept
highwaymen.
As is characteristic in
Restoration comedy, the names of
the characters reveal their basic
nature; several cast members do
an excellent job of living up to
their appellations. Eric Booth
Miller as the craftier of the beaux,
Archer, is as charming, witty, and
handsome an engineer of
seduction as ever was.
Handsome Pair
He is handsomely paired with
Mrs. Sullen, portrayed with great
grace and sensuousness by Janis
Lipman. Both fine individual
performances, they complement
each other beautifully.
Caroline Gillespie plays Mrs.
Sullen's mother, the good-hearted
healer, Lady Bountiful. She acts
at home on any stage in any style;

this performance is no exception.
She will be remembered by
regular patrons of the University
Theater as Viola in 'Twelfth
Night," and Mrs. Alving in
"Ghosts."
Incomparable
Incomparable is Mark Capri as
the embodiment of the French
superfluous manners and prating
which the English loved so well to
ridicule, Count Bellair. He is
unbearably funny and perfectly
"precieux."
These performers have
managed to rise above what

appeared to be a general lack of
directional design on the part of
guest director, Kent Paul. He
always balanced his staging
physically but only occasionally
psychologically. Under him the
actors form pretty stage pictures
but he has evoked no sense of the
show as a physical whole flowing
from one moment into the next.
This static staging nearly
undoes the show in the opening
act, but improves greatly when
Farquhar spells out more specific
action for Paul in the later acts.
New Assignment
Paul, a graduate of Harvard and
the Neighborhood Playhouse, was
given the directing assignment
following the resignation of the
head of the drama department,
Michael Barry, who was to direct
the play. Paul came to Stanford
following his highly successful
production of "The Lady's Not
for Burning" at the Long Wharf
Theater in New Haven, Conn.
The other actors do not fare
quite as well in the show. Many of
the drama department actors do
especially well in the modern
drama, probing psyches and
focusing on internal technique.
However, they should all take a
cue from Eric Booth Miller, and
discover as he has the personal
enjoyment of the actor of
Farquhar's day in sharing his
character with the audience.
As themselves as well as the
characters, the actors must revel
in the delightful intrigues they
perpetrate on one another for the
audience to fully enjoy them.
Indicative of this problem is Peter
Moore.
Somber Focus
As the other beau, Aimwell,
Moore has great potential, he
works with an indefatiguable,
driving, studied intensity at his
craft. Unfortunately, he has not
been able to leave that somber,
internal focus at home. He used it
to his advantage as Oswald in
"Ghosts" quite well, but in this
play it is too heavy a weight to be
born by such a light and airy
show.
Marta Kepes as the innkeeper's
daughter, the delicious Cherry,
would also benefit greatly from
savoring herself a good deal

more so would the innkeeper
himself, Bonniface, played by
Michael Gillespie. The distinction
here is often a subtle one, but
very important to the enjoyment
of the show.
The only real disappointments
in the cast are Jerry Post and
Mary Leyden. Post, as Sir Charles
Freeman, brother to Mrs. Sullen,
acts a vital part in untangling the
intrigues at the end of the show.
Post lets underplayed naturalism
pass for the self-assurance of a
respected nobleman at ease; he
comes off weak and anticlimactic.

Leyden has been assigned her
second lusty wench of the year,
the first being Regina in
"Ghosts," and again presents
herself as an unbreachable iceberg.
Jose Leiva's set has almost as
much to do as the actors. Scene
changes, involving rooms that
virtually explode as walls and set
dressings are turned about and
flown in and out with the
assistance of costumed
stagehands, make a show in
themselves. The attractive,
earth-colored costumes were
designed by Douglas Russell.
Lighting is by Tom Arnsten.
The years have not tarnished
this warm, bawdy, funny play,
nor have the problems of
marriage, friendship, religion, and
love changed a bit since the play
was written, as the audience
readily acknowledged by its
laughter.
Disjointedness in a show is a
common problem with openings.
Hopefully, it has cleared up by
today.
Note: A member of the fine
cast of "The Odyssey" was omitted
from the show's review last week
by mistake. Apologies and
congratulations to Mark
Crawford.
