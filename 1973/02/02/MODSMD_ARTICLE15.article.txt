# Forgettable 'Lear' Production
## 
### MARC D. KAYE 
The Company Theatre of the
Bay Area tries, and vigorously so,
to satisfy a need for
Shakespearean drama with its
presentation of 'King Lear.' Its
Berkeley audience thirsts for good
theatre.
The play was so oversubscribed
that there was sitting room on the
floor only. Unfortunately, this is a
tribute only to the Berkeley
community, which
wholeheartedly supports the local
effort, but should demand more
artistic quality.
A subtle and viciously circular
fact of contemporary drama
production should underscore any
criticism of this 'King Lear.'
Small, fledgling companies face a
dilemma. To survive, they must
present theatre which will attract
an audience.
With their limited resources,
facilities, and experience,
however, these same companies
cannot take on classic pieces
which they clearly won't be able
to handle. They must strike a
balance for continued existence
unless there is that faithful,
benevolent audience which is'able
to stomach the mistakes and come
back for more.
'King Lear' undoubtedly ranks
among the most difficult of plays
to present. The Company Theatre
shows guts, if not ambition, in
choosing to perform 'Lear.' But it
seems to have jumped in a bit over
its head.
Shakespeare should be exciting
for both the audience and the
players. The players should
communicate their excitement to
add to the audience's. This
production was tedious, and it
was this tedium that came across.
Luckily, Shakespeare gives enough
motion and intrigue to keep the
audience awake despite an over-all
dull performance.
Shakespeare prescribes a wide
range of emotions, supposed to
rend our hearts, tear us apart, and
send us into catharsis. Never have
I seen a more passionless
Shakespeare.
Nature did go awry during
Lear's tragedy. The order of being
was upset, yet the surviving

people in the last scene showed no
hint of horror on their faces in
response to the tragic sequence of
events they had just witnessed.
Granted, the Duke of Albany
professes no pity in the last scene.
But these are just words. Lear's
tragedy is a catastrophic event,
and the characters are meant to
respond to it with abhorrent
feeling and awe, not with
unthinking blandness or staring
into blank space.
'King Lear' is a passionately
intellectual play. A prerequisite
for success is that the characters
be portrayed as thoughtful
people; their ability to understand
the awesomeness of the tragic
events adds to the passions. King
Lear himself is a victim of his
unbridled passion coupled with
his blind, obstinate will.
In this production, the
inability to understand is also the
vital flaw. To try to undercut the
character's intellectual nature
results in passionate characters
who cannot understand and in
actors, since they are not always
encouraged to deal intellectually
with the material, who cannot
show the appropriate passions.
Intellect should not
overshadow passion, but rather
add fuel to the flame. Instead, the
audience witnessed some very
mechanical and flat performances.
There might just as well have
been a robot out on the stage
playing Cordelia.
She was icy, aloof, not the
passionate father's daughter. This
portrayal worked in the first scene
in which Lear tried to impose his
will over the way of love,
demanding a verbal display of
affection. In the last scenes,
however, Cordelia was too
detached, emotionless, and
withholding from her dear father.
I sensed sparse understanding, and
icy passion.
With such an acting
environment for the portrayal of
the King, it is a wonder that Lear
came off as decently as he did.
James Arrington showed
understanding and feeling in
portraying the complex Lear.

(liven the passions in the portrayal
of some of the other characters,
it's surprising that this Lear
survived to die. It not only looked
grim at times for Lear the
character, but also for the actor.
It's difficult to react
passionately to a passionlessly
played daughter. Arrington
started off slow, not seeming to
possess the range of expression
needed to do Lear adequately. Me
picked up as the play went on.
The tragic flaw and its
recognition holds utmost
importance in 'King Lear.' The
part requires a slow illumination,
spiced with madness. Yet the
actor did not understand Lear's
madness as well as he could have.
He therefore did not act it out as
insanely believable. The
performance faltered and dragged.
It picked up when Lear was
reunited with Cordelia. Lear
understood more and more. He
made a turn away from the
foolishness and folly of his old
age. Despite the cold Cordelia,
Arrington drew out more emotion
from the audience at Lear's death.
This scene is supposed to be
the most moving part of a play in
which most of the actors do not
suspend their disbelief. The
actor's reaction to Lear's death
borders on being a "drag." Both
actors and audience had a "Let's
get out of here" attitude.
Despite these blatant
shortcomings, the Company
production did have some bright
spots. The Earl of Gloucester,
played by William Kramer, was
able to communicate pathos in
the time between his death and
his having his eyes cut out, even
after a poor beginning.
In comparison, the Earl of
Kent struck me as being a bland,
one dimensional fellow,
sometimes going into a second
dimension of feeling, but lacking a
third of understanding and the
consequent horror.
Patrick Largent as Edgar was
perhaps the most convincing actor
in the whole play. He did an
excellent Poor Tom routine. He
showed sensitivity to ironic

implications and generally showed
he cared about both thinking and
feeling. His passion was
consequently well-rooted and
extremely effective.
Stuart Rudin's Edmund was
inconsistent. His transition from
the slightly effeminate bastard to
the heroic soldier was
unbelievable. In portraying him,
Rudin didn't exhibit thorough
understanding of Edmund's inner
structure, which would have made
the transition successful.
Paul Baccus gave Lear's fool an
agreeable characterization. He
went over some of the lines too
fast, yet as a foil to Lear, Baccus
showed sensitivity. Michael Harpe
also merited mention in a
hilarious although inaccurate
portrayal as Oswald, as does
Domingo Magwili as the King of
France.
Last come Lear's two other
daughters, Goneril and Regan,
played by Patricia McColm and
Ellen Leonard. McColm was
appropriately shrewish. But,
although somewhat convincing,
she was not outraged enough to
be really contemptuous. The rage
should have been held in, but
boiling enough just under the
surface to give a hint that her
father really wanted a boy when
he had her.
I perceived Regan as a bland,
inconspicuous character, not
passionately pointed enough in
her characterization to be
remembered in retrospect.
Perhaps that also applies to this
rendition of 'King Lear' as a
whole. It really is an eminently
forgettable performance.

it's surprising that this Lear
survived to die. It not only looked
grim at times for Lear the
character, but also for the actor.
It's difficult to react
passionately to a passionlessly
played daughter. Arrington
started off slow, not seeming to
possess the range of expression
needed to do Lear adequately. Me
picked up as the play went on.
The tragic flaw and its
recognition holds utmost
importance in 'King Lear.' The
part requires a slow illumination,
spiced with madness. Yet the
actor did not understand Lear's
madness as well as he could have.
He therefore did not act it out as
insanely believable. The
performance faltered and dragged.
It picked up when Lear was
reunited with Cordelia. Lear
understood more and more. He
made a turn away from the
foolishness and folly of his old
age. Despite the cold Cordelia,
Arrington drew out more emotion
from the audience at Lear's death.
This scene is supposed to be
the most moving part of a play in
which most of the actors do not
suspend their disbelief. The
actor's reaction to Lear's death
borders on being a "drag." Both
actors and audience had a "Let's
get out of here" attitude.
Despite these blatant
shortcomings, the Company
production did have some bright
spots. The Earl of Gloucester,
played by William Kramer, was
able to communicate pathos in
the time between his death and
his having his eyes cut out, even
after a poor beginning.
In comparison, the Earl of
Kent struck me as being a bland,
one dimensional fellow,
sometimes going into a second
dimension of feeling, but lacking a
third of understanding and the
consequent horror.
Patrick Largent as Edgar was
perhaps the most convincing actor
in the whole play. He did an
excellent Poor Tom routine. He
showed sensitivity to ironic

implications and generally showed
he cared about both thinking and
feeling. His passion was
consequently well-rooted and
extremely effective.
Stuart Rudin's Edmund was
inconsistent. His transition from
the slightly effeminate bastard to
the heroic soldier was
unbelievable. In portraying him,
Rudin didn't exhibit thorough
understanding of Edmund's inner
structure, which would have made
the transition successful.
Paul Baccus gave Lear's fool an
agreeable characterization. He
went over some of the lines too
fast, yet as a foil to Lear, Baccus
showed sensitivity. Michael Harpe
also merited mention in a
hilarious although inaccurate
portrayal as Oswald, as does
Domingo Magwili as the King of
France.
Last come Lear's two other
daughters, Goneril and Regan,
played by Patricia McColm and
Ellen Leonard. McColm was
appropriately shrewish. But,
although somewhat convincing,
she was not outraged enough to
be really contemptuous. The rage
should have been held in, but
boiling enough just under the
surface to give a hint that her
father really wanted a boy when
he had her.
I perceived Regan as a bland,
inconspicuous character, not
passionately pointed enough in
her characterization to be
remembered in retrospect.
Perhaps that also applies to this
rendition of 'King Lear' as a
whole. It really is an eminently
forgettable performance.

The Company Theatre of the
Bay Area tries, and vigorously so,
to satisfy a need for
Shakespearean drama with its
presentation of 'King Lear.' Its
Berkeley audience thirsts for good
theatre.
The play was so oversubscribed
that there was sitting room on the
floor only. Unfortunately, this is a
tribute only to the Berkeley
community, which
wholeheartedly supports the local
effort, but should demand more
artistic quality.
A subtle and viciously circular
fact of contemporary drama
production should underscore any
criticism of this 'King Lear.'
Small, fledgling companies face a
dilemma. To survive, they must
present theatre which will attract
an audience.
With their limited resources,
facilities, and experience,
however, these same companies
cannot take on classic pieces
which they clearly won't be able
to handle. They must strike a
balance for continued existence
unless there is that faithful,
benevolent audience which is'able
to stomach the mistakes and come
back for more.
'King Lear' undoubtedly ranks
among the most difficult of plays
to present. The Company Theatre
shows guts, if not ambition, in
choosing to perform 'Lear.' But it
seems to have jumped in a bit over
its head.
Shakespeare should be exciting
for both the audience and the
players. The players should
communicate their excitement to
add to the audience's. This
production was tedious, and it
was this tedium that came across.
Luckily, Shakespeare gives enough
motion and intrigue to keep the
audience awake despite an over-all
dull performance.
Shakespeare prescribes a wide
range of emotions, supposed to
rend our hearts, tear us apart, and
send us into catharsis. Never have
I seen a more passionless
Shakespeare.
Nature did go awry during
Lear's tragedy. The order of being
was upset, yet the surviving

people in the last scene showed no
hint of horror on their faces in
response to the tragic sequence of
events they had just witnessed.
Granted, the Duke of Albany
professes no pity in the last scene.
But these are just words. Lear's
tragedy is a catastrophic event,
and the characters are meant to
respond to it with abhorrent
feeling and awe, not with
unthinking blandness or staring
into blank space.
'King Lear' is a passionately
intellectual play. A prerequisite
for success is that the characters
be portrayed as thoughtful
people; their ability to understand
the awesomeness of the tragic
events adds to the passions. King
Lear himself is a victim of his
unbridled passion coupled with
his blind, obstinate will.
In this production, the
inability to understand is also the
vital flaw. To try to undercut the
character's intellectual nature
results in passionate characters
who cannot understand and in
actors, since they are not always
encouraged to deal intellectually
with the material, who cannot
show the appropriate passions.
Intellect should not
overshadow passion, but rather
add fuel to the flame. Instead, the
audience witnessed some very
mechanical and flat performances.
There might just as well have
been a robot out on the stage
playing Cordelia.
She was icy, aloof, not the
passionate father's daughter. This
portrayal worked in the first scene
in which Lear tried to impose his
will over the way of love,
demanding a verbal display of
affection. In the last scenes,
however, Cordelia was too
detached, emotionless, and
withholding from her dear father.
I sensed sparse understanding, and
icy passion.
With such an acting
environment for the portrayal of
the King, it is a wonder that Lear
came off as decently as he did.
James Arrington showed

portraying the complex Lear.

Small, fledgling companies face a

present theatre which will attract
an audience.
With their limited resources,

however, these same companies

balance for continued existence

'King Lear' undoubtedly ranks
among the most difficult of plays

shows guts, if not ambition, in
choosing to perform 'Lear.' But it
seems to have jumped in a bit over
its head.
Shakespeare should be exciting
for both the audience and the
players. The players should
communicate their excitement to
add to the audience's. This
production was tedious, and it
was this tedium that came across.
Luckily, Shakespeare gives enough
motion and intrigue to keep the
audience awake despite an over-all
dull performance.
Shakespeare prescribes a wide
range of emotions, supposed to
rend our hearts, tear us apart, and
send us into catharsis. Never have
I seen a more passionless
Shakespeare.
Nature did go awry during
Lear's tragedy. The order of being
was upset, yet the surviving

people in the last scene showed no
hint of horror on their faces in
response to the tragic sequence of
events they had just witnessed.
Granted, the Duke of Albany
professes no pity in the last scene.
But these are just words. Lear's
tragedy is a catastrophic event,
and the characters are meant to
respond to it with abhorrent
feeling and awe, not with
unthinking blandness or staring
into blank space.
'King Lear' is a passionately
intellectual play. A prerequisite
for success is that the characters
be portrayed as thoughtful
people; their ability to understand
the awesomeness of the tragic
events adds to the passions. King
Lear himself is a victim of his
unbridled passion coupled with
his blind, obstinate will.
In this production, the
inability to understand is also the
vital flaw. To try to undercut the
character's intellectual nature
results in passionate characters
who cannot understand and in
actors, since they are not always
encouraged to deal intellectually
with the material, who cannot
show the appropriate passions.
Intellect should not
overshadow passion, but rather
add fuel to the flame. Instead, the
audience witnessed some very
mechanical and flat performances.
There might just as well have
been a robot out on the stage
playing Cordelia.
She was icy, aloof, not the
passionate father's daughter. This
portrayal worked in the first scene
in which Lear tried to impose his
will over the way of love,
demanding a verbal display of
affection. In the last scenes,
however, Cordelia was too
detached, emotionless, and
withholding from her dear father.
I sensed sparse understanding, and
icy passion.
With such an acting
environment for the portrayal of
the King, it is a wonder that Lear
came off as decently as he did.
James Arrington showed
understanding and feeling in
portraying the complex Lear.

(liven the passions in the portrayal
of some of the other characters,
it's surprising that this Lear
survived to die. It not only looked
grim at times for Lear the
character, but also for the actor.
It's difficult to react
passionately to a passionlessly
played daughter. Arrington
started off slow, not seeming to
possess the range of expression
needed to do Lear adequately. Me
picked up as the play went on.
The tragic flaw and its
recognition holds utmost
importance in 'King Lear.' The
part requires a slow illumination,
spiced with madness. Yet the
actor did not understand Lear's
madness as well as he could have.
He therefore did not act it out as
insanely believable. The
performance faltered and dragged.
It picked up when Lear was
reunited with Cordelia. Lear
understood more and more. He
made a turn away from the
foolishness and folly of his old
age. Despite the cold Cordelia,
Arrington drew out more emotion
from the audience at Lear's death.
This scene is supposed to be
the most moving part of a play in
which most of the actors do not
suspend their disbelief. The
actor's reaction to Lear's death
borders on being a "drag." Both
actors and audience had a "Let's
get out of here" attitude.
Despite these blatant
shortcomings, the Company
production did have some bright
spots. The Earl of Gloucester,
played by William Kramer, was
able to communicate pathos in
the time between his death and
his having his eyes cut out, even
after a poor beginning.
In comparison, the Earl of
Kent struck me as being a bland,
one dimensional fellow,
sometimes going into a second
dimension of feeling, but lacking a
third of understanding and the
consequent horror.
Patrick Largent as Edgar was
perhaps the most convincing actor
in the whole play. He did an
excellent Poor Tom routine. He
showed sensitivity to ironic

implications and generally showed
he cared about both thinking and
feeling. His passion was
consequently well-rooted and
extremely effective.
Stuart Rudin's Edmund was
inconsistent. His transition from
the slightly effeminate bastard to
the heroic soldier was
unbelievable. In portraying him,
Rudin didn't exhibit thorough
understanding of Edmund's inner
structure, which would have made
the transition successful.
Paul Baccus gave Lear's fool an
agreeable characterization. He
went over some of the lines too
fast, yet as a foil to Lear, Baccus
showed sensitivity. Michael Harpe
also merited mention in a
hilarious although inaccurate
portrayal as Oswald, as does
Domingo Magwili as the King of
France.
Last come Lear's two other
daughters, Goneril and Regan,
played by Patricia McColm and
Ellen Leonard. McColm was
appropriately shrewish. But,
although somewhat convincing,
she was not outraged enough to
be really contemptuous. The rage
should have been held in, but
boiling enough just under the
surface to give a hint that her
father really wanted a boy when
he had her.
I perceived Regan as a bland,
inconspicuous character, not
passionately pointed enough in
her characterization to be
remembered in retrospect.
Perhaps that also applies to this
rendition of 'King Lear' as a
whole. It really is an eminently
forgettable performance.

madness as well as he could have.
He therefore did not act it out as
insanely believable. The
performance faltered and dragged.
It picked up when Lear was
reunited with Cordelia. Lear
understood more and more. He
made a turn away from the
foolishness and folly of his old
age. Despite the cold Cordelia,
Arrington drew out more emotion
from the audience at Lear's death.
This scene is supposed to be
the most moving part of a play in
which most of the actors do not
suspend their disbelief. The
actor's reaction to Lear's death
borders on being a "drag." Both
actors and audience had a "Let's
get out of here" attitude.
Despite these blatant
shortcomings, the Company
production did have some bright
spots. The Earl of Gloucester,
played by William Kramer, was
able to communicate pathos in
the time between his death and
his having his eyes cut out, even
after a poor beginning.
In comparison, the Earl of
Kent struck me as being a bland,
one dimensional fellow,
sometimes going into a second
dimension of feeling, but lacking a
third of understanding and the
consequent horror.
Patrick Largent as Edgar was
perhaps the most convincing actor
in the whole play. He did an
excellent Poor Tom routine. He
showed sensitivity to ironic

implications and generally showed
he cared about both thinking and
feeling. His passion was
consequently well-rooted and
extremely effective.
Stuart Rudin's Edmund was
inconsistent. His transition from
the slightly effeminate bastard to
the heroic soldier was
unbelievable. In portraying him,
Rudin didn't exhibit thorough
understanding of Edmund's inner
structure, which would have made
the transition successful.
Paul Baccus gave Lear's fool an
agreeable characterization. He
went over some of the lines too
fast, yet as a foil to Lear, Baccus
showed sensitivity. Michael Harpe
also merited mention in a
hilarious although inaccurate
portrayal as Oswald, as does
Domingo Magwili as the King of
France.
Last come Lear's two other
daughters, Goneril and Regan,
played by Patricia McColm and
Ellen Leonard. McColm was
appropriately shrewish. But,
although somewhat convincing,
she was not outraged enough to
be really contemptuous. The rage
should have been held in, but
boiling enough just under the
surface to give a hint that her
father really wanted a boy when
he had her.
I perceived Regan as a bland,
inconspicuous character, not
passionately pointed enough in
her characterization to be
remembered in retrospect.
Perhaps that also applies to this
rendition of 'King Lear' as a
whole. It really is an eminently
forgettable performance.
