# National Indoor Meet
## Cards Seek Tennis Title 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
Everything the Stanford tennis
team does this season will point to
just one goal—winning the NCAA
title of Princeton this June.
In 1972, the team
accomplished several things: It
beat both USC and UCLA for the
first time in the same season, won
the Pac-8 title, and captured the
Ojai Intercollegiate championship.
Only the NCAA title eluded
Coach Dick Gould's team, which
finished second behind Trinity
(Tex.).
The Cardinals will find out
just how good a chance they have
to become national champions
this weekend at the National
Indoor Championships in
Madison, Wisconsin. They are
co-seeded first with Pac-8 rivals
USC and UCLA in a tourney that
includes virtually all of the
nation's top college teams.
This afternoon, Stanford faces
North Carolina in a first round
match.The Tar Heels, 21-3 last year,
are considered the best team in
the Southeast. If the Cards win
that match, they will probably
face Trinity in the second round.
Trinity has lost five members
from last year's championship
team.
Gould is reasonably confident
his team will win both of these
matches and advance to the
semifinals. tJSC would be
Stanford's likely opponent in the
semifinals tomorrow and if the
Cards win that match, the final
match Sunday will probably be
against UCLA.
Wouldn't Trade
"I wouldn't trade
personnel—my number one man
for theirs, my number two man
for theirs—with any other team in
the country," Gould said. "But
still, it's possible that on a given
day USC or UCLA could beat us."
The lineup Gould took to
Wisconsin Wednesday is headed
by junior Alex (Sandy) Mayer.
"There is no college player better

than Mayer although there are
several who could beat him on a
given day. I'd say there are only
three or four players in America
better than Mayer," Gould said.
One of those players, possibly,
is Roscoe Tanner. A senior this
year, Tanner starred for Stanford
the last three years before turning
professional during the summer.
Added Incentive
The absence of Tanner puts
Stanford on an even keel with
USC and UCLA, each of whom
previously lost their stars, Eric
Van Dillen and Jimmy Connors,
to the pro ranks before
graduation. "Last year people said
our Pac-8 championship was just a
fluke, I don't happen to agree
with that, but this year, with
Roscoe gone, everything's even,
which gives us a little added
incentive," the Stanford coach
said.
Playing second singles behind
Mayer this weekend will be
sophomore Jim Delaney, a finalist
in the National Amateur Singles
Championship last summer.
Senior Rick Fisher will play third
singles.
The rest of the order was
undecided when the team left
with senior Gary Groslimond,
sophomore Chip Fisher, and
freshmen Pat DuPre and John
Whitlinger, both former Junior
Davis Cuppers, all making the trip.
The tourney consists of dual
meets featuring six singles and
three doubles matches. Playing
first doubles for the Cardinals will
be Groslimond and Rick Fisher,
one of the nation's top collegiate
doubles teams. Mayer and
Whitlinger will team at second
doubles with Delaney and Chip
Fisher at the third doubles slot.
Impressive Depth
Gould's starting lineup is
impressive, but he emphasizes that
the team has a lot of depth. For
example, sophomore Chico
Hagey, out with an ankle injury,
was an Ail-American last year.

Junior Paul Sidone has been
another consistent player the past
two years.
One thing which particularly
impresses Gould is the attitude of
his players. "We have a fine group
of guys. They Ve socially very close,
they approach work in a positive
way, they get good grades ... I've
never seen a team work as hard as
this one and I think it will pay
off."
The winner of this weekend's
tournament will become the
NCAA favorite, even though the
nine-match dual meet system in
Madison is somewhat different
from the NCAA outdoor event
which is conducted with four-man
teams.
However, the Stanford coach
sees this weekend's meet, the first
ever matching teams from all over
the country in head-to-head
competition, as a prelude to the
way national championships will
be decided in the future.
Gould recognizes luck as a
factor in determining the ultimate
national champion. But, although
he sees both USC and UCLA as
threats, he is "cautiously
optimistic" that his team will win
Stanford's first official national
championship in tennis.
