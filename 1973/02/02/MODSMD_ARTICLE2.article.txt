# Improved Job Market Seen
## 
### KATHY ALCALA 
According to Dr. Ralph Keller,
director of the University Career
Planning and Placement Center,
Stanford's June graduates will have
better job prospects than have been
available at any time in the last few
years.
In the Placement Center's annual
report and a news release on Tuesday,
Dr. Keller said that "offers to
bachelor's and master's degree holders
are up significantly, although they are
down slightly for some Ph.D.'s." There
was an overall eight percent increase in
placement over the previous year for
all graduates.
"Prospects appear brightest for
engineering majors, especially at the
bachelor of science level," he said.
The only trouble in placement
appears to be with the liberal arts
majors. This year, more than others, a
greater number of students decided to
go directly to work rather than to
graduate school. Of the liberal arts

majors, only forty percent of them
were able to find jobs.
Two Educations
"It appears as though liberal arts
and humanities majors in general will
require two educations in the
immediate future — one for the good
life and the other for a salable skill,"
said Keller.
"We find that 11 percent of
Stanford undergraduates are members
of minority races,"he continued.
"Many of them hope to enter law,
business or medical school. The
number intending graduate
professional preparation probably
exceeds the number who can be
admitted. As many of them are liberal
arts majors, they will face the same job
search problems as all their other
classmates."
Women graduating with humanities
degrees will also face job problems.
Except for airline hostesses, job offers
for women A.B.'s are down, he said.
For the first time, Harvard and

Radcliffe reported their student plans
after graduation together. They were
very close to those of Stanford
graduates. They show that Stanford
has a slight edge in both percentages of
seniors who plan graduate study
(47-42 percent), and those who do not
plan to further their basic education
(8-4 percent).
A slightly higher percentage of
Stanford men plan to seek work than
those at Harvard (34-31 percent),
while only a one percent difference
exists between the number of Stanford
and Radcliffe women who will go to
work (40-41 percent).
Stanford Ph.D.'s did well in getting
"excellent jobs," Keller reported,
except those who had not completed
their dissertations. "Having the degree
in hand is important."
Other good news, according to
Keller, is that job offers increased at
all degree levels over the previous year.
Recruiters from industry, business,
and government increased in number
from 352 to 369, even though the
number of actual interviews fell
slightly.
Summer Jobs
The Placement Center is becoming
increasingly concerned with the
growing student need for part-time
summer employment to meet rising
school costs and acquire useful skills.
The staff has intensified its efforts to
find this type of employment for
students who register with the service.
Plans are already under way to add
personnel to the campus center and
the Stanford Los Angeles office (with
the cooperation of the Stanford
Alumni Association) to provide
additional assistance to students, said
Keller.
He noted that there has been a
significant increase in both the use of
the service by students and in the
number of hours of counseling for
undergraduates who have started
planning for their careers well in
advance. Keller feels that this is a good
sign.
A copy of the Placement Center's
annual report is available at the
Placement Center, located at the
northeast corner of White Plaza, for
anyone who is interested in more
detailed information.

HAPPY DAYS — Placement Center Director Ralph Keller (1.) feels that the job
market for seniors graduating this June will be better than in years past. Times
weren't as good for Keller in Nov. 1971, when he was interviewed by KZSUnews
reporter Bill Johnson during an anti-war recruiting demonstration at the Center.
