# Golfers Face First Intercollegiate Test
## 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
After dropping a 58-50
decision to the alumni two weeks
ago, Stanford's golf team will face
its first intercollegiate
competition today when the
Cards host San Jose State, Santa
Clara, San Francisco State, and
Cal State-Hayward in an 18 hole
medal play tournament.
Six players from each team will
test the Stanford course beginning
at 11:30 a.m. Stanford's lineup
will include five sophomores and a
senior as Coach Bud Finger
continues to search for his top six
players.
The Cards are currently in the
midst of an extensive 10 round
qualifying for positions on the
team. Sophomore Bruce
Robertson leads the qualifying
after six rounds with a 71.0
average. Four more sophomores
trail Robertson-Aly Trompas
(72.5), Conrad Nilmeier (72.8),
Dave Baskms (74.7), and Bob
Chapman (75.0). Senior Denny
Colvin earned the sixth varsity
spot for today's tournament on
the strength of his 75.2 average.
Besides this tentative top six,
Finger will get a look at most of
his top contenders this afternoon
since he plans to enter three
Stanford junior
varsity, and freshman. John Beers,
George Pettinger, Bob Harrington,
and Steve Oliverio are some of
the players from the junior varsity
squad who could emerge as varsity
starters later in the season.
San Jose State and Stanford
are easily the favorites in this

afternoon's tourney. The Spartans
were the only West Coast team to
survive the 36 hole cut at last
year's NCAA tournament and
eventually finished seventh in the
nation.
Phil Barry, Dean May, and
Brian Inkster return from that
team as well as Mark Lye, who
redshirted last year as a freshman.
Although this will be his first year
of collegiate golf, Lye has already
established himself as one of the
top amateur players in Northern
California and should be the
Spartans' number one man.
If last year's dual matches
between Stanford and San Jose
State are any indication, today's
tournament should go down to
the final green. The Cards and
Spartans played to a 27-27 tie in a
thrilling 36 hole match at
Stanford and the Cards edged the
Spartans 30-24 at the San Jose
Country Club.
