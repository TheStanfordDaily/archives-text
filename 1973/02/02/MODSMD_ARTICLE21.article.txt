# Face Cal At Berkeley
## Cagers Seek Ninth Win 
### STAN WILSON 
Last week's Northern
California Players of the Week will
be featured when Stanford travels
to Berkeley tomorrow to
challenge the Bears in the
Pac-Eight TV game of the week at
2:40 p.m.
Stanford's Tim Patterson and
Cal's Rickie Hawthorne, both
freshmmen, were co-recipients of
the award after leading their
teams to convincing wins. The
Cards outlasted Santa Barbara
80-68, as Patterson converted all
ten of his field goal attempts for a
22 point effort. Hawthorne scored
27 points, grabbed nine rebounds,
and recorded six assists as the
Bears overwhelmed Santa Clara
83-60.
But Patterson, who has
improved with every game, won't
be in the starting lineup
tomorrow. Coach Howie Dallmar
has indicated that he will start the
same lineup that started last
week—Dave Frost (6-6) and Mike
Mann (6-9) at the forwards, Rich
Kelley (7-0) at center, and sophs
Mark Gilberg (6-0) and Mel
Arterberry (6-3) at the guard
positions.
"He'll (Patterson) continue to
come off the bench," Dallmar
said, "but he'll play as much as
the starters."
Another bright spot for
Stanford last weekend was
Gilbert's outside shooting. Gilberg
seems to have regained his touch
after an earlier cold streak.
He hit six of seven shots from
the field against the Gauchos,
mostly from the 20-foot range.
"Mark has to hit from the
outside," Dallmar explained.
"We're not a great outside
shooting team—if we do get that
shooting from Mark around the
perimeter it certainly opens things
up for the big men inside."

Last week's statistics would
seem to bear out Dallmar's
statement, as the Cards two big
men, Kelley and Patterson,
combined to score 43 points.
Youth will be the rule
tomorrow, as the only senior in
the starting lineup for either team
will be the Bears' talented forward
John Coughran, who leads the
Bears in both scoring and
rebounding. Coughran was slowed
down for a few weeks with the
flu, but is averaging 16.8 points a
game and pulling down 9.1
rebounds.
Hawthorne, the Bears' second
leading scorer, has sparked the
Bears in their last six games,
averaging 18.5 points per contest
during that period. The 6-3
freshman sensation is now
averaging 13.5 points a game for
the season.
Cal utilizes a basically three
guard attack, and features great
quickness. Brady Allen, a JC

transfer, veteran Eric Long, and
center Carl Meier round out the
Bears' starting five.
Dallmar compared Cal and
Santa Barbara, explaining that,
"Cal has the same kind of
quickness that Santa Barbara
featured, but they are much
bigger. Dick (Edwards) also has a
good combination going for him
now, and its intersting that two
freshmen are playing so well for
each team."
Cal has evened its record at
8-8, while the Cards are 8-7 on the
season.

CAPTAIN, 1973—Senior Bob Buell, shown here getting ready to
shoot against UCLA, was elected captain for the 1973 season in a
player vote Tuesday. Buell is currently averaging 6.8 points a game
and leads the team in free throw shooting with an 83.3 percentage.
