# Swimmers Challenge UCLA
## 
### MIKE CHASSON 
Stanford's swim team will be out to avenge last
year's 81-32 defeat to UCLA when the Bruins come
to the Stanford Pools this Saturday at 2 p.m.
Though they will be without the services of
Olympic star Steve Genter, who is sitting out a year,
the Bruins still can boast a collegiate All-American
in every swim event.
Leading the UCLA squad is Tom Bruce, the
Olympic silver medalist in the 100 meter breastroke,
and gold medal winner on the 400 meter medley
relay.
Bruce will have a tough time in the 200
breastroke, however, as he will be facing the top
two breastrokers in the country, Brian Job and John
Hencken. In the latest national rankings Job and
Hencken lead the rest of the nation by over three
seconds.
Two Freestylers
The Bruins have two excellent freestylers in Kurt
Krumpoltz and Rex Favero. Krumpholtz set the
world record in the 400 meter free in the prelims of
the Olympic Trials, but failed to make the team
when he finished fourth in the finals.
Favero, a freshman from Sacramento, made the
finals inthe 400 and 1500 meter freestyles at the
Olympic Trials, to rank as one of the world's fastest
distance swimmers.
Stanford junior Terry Sutton could face either of
this pair in the 1000 free where he is currently
ranked fourth in the country. In the 500 free coach
Jim Gaughran will choose among Sutton, Steve
Strong, and Paul Clark to counter the Bruin duo.
UCLA is strong in the butterfly with NCAA

finalist Rob Clark, senior Bernie Stenson, and frosh
Steve Baxter. Baxter, from Palo Alto High School,
has been a pleasant surprise for the UCLA coaching
staff since he currently has one of the ten fastest
times in the 200 fly.
In the backstroke the Bruins have two good 100
yard performers in Paul Benson and Steve Doyle.
Both Benson and Doyle have been NCAA finalists in
the 100 back, but Stanford's Randy Whitchurch,
who currently has the third fastest 200 backstroke
in the country should be able to defeat both of
them in the longer event.
Sprinters
UCLA relies on Barry Townsend and freshman
Brad Anderson in the sprints, with help from soph
Tim McDonnell. Townsend a NCAA finalist in
50 free will be tested by Cardinal's Dean Anderson
and Steve Carey, both currently ranked in the top
ten in this event.
Anderson will be the Bruin's hope in the 100
free, but will be facing Stanford's Anderson and
Martin Pedley. Pedley and Anderson are currently in
the top ten in the latest national rankings.
UCLA will rely on their Anderson and
McDonnell in the 200 free, with Richard Cook
being Stanford's hope in that event. Gaughran hopes
Cook can break up a possible one-two UCLA finish
in the 200, but this will be tough if Krumpholtz
swims this instead of the 1000.
A key event for the Cardinals if they are to win
the meet will be the 400 medley relay. UCLa has
potentially tough relay centered around Bruce's
breastroke leg, but how fast they will actually be
won't be known until the race is over.

free, but will be facing Stanford's Anderson and
Martin Pedley. Pedley and Anderson are currently in
the top ten in the latest national rankings.
UCLA will rely on their Anderson and
McDonnell in the 200 free, with Richard Cook
being Stanford's hope in that event. Gaughran hopes
Cook can break up a possible one-two UCLA finish
in the 200, but this will be tough if Krumpholtz
swims this instead of the 1000.
A key event for the Cardinals if they are to win
the meet will be the 400 medley relay. UCLa has
potentially tough relay centered around Bruce's
breastroke leg, but how fast they will actually be
won't be known until the race is over.
Stanford's swim team will be out to avenge last
year's 81-32 defeat to UCLA when the Bruins come
to the Stanford Pools this Saturday at 2 p.m.
Though they will be without the services of
Olympic star Steve Genter, who is sitting out a year,
the Bruins still can boast a collegiate All-American
in every swim event.
Leading the UCLA squad is Tom Bruce, the
Olympic silver medalist in the 100 meter breastroke,
and gold medal winner on the 400 meter medley
relay.
Bruce will have a tough time in the 200
breastroke, however, as he will be facing the top
two breastrokers in the country, Brian Job and John
Hencken. In the latest national rankings Job and
Hencken lead the rest of the nation by over three
seconds.
Two Freestylers
The Bruins have two excellent freestylers in Kurt
Krumpoltz and Rex Favero. Krumpholtz set the
world record in the 400 meter free in the prelims of
the Olympic Trials, but failed to make the team
when he finished fourth in the finals.
Favero, a freshman from Sacramento, made the
finals inthe 400 and 1500 meter freestyles at the
Olympic Trials, to rank as one of the world's fastest
distance swimmers.
Stanford junior Terry Sutton could face either of
this pair in the 1000 free where he is currently
ranked fourth in the country. In the 500 free coach
Jim Gaughran will choose among Sutton, Steve
Strong, and Paul Clark to counter the Bruin duo.
UCLA is strong in the butterfly with NCAA

finalist Rob Clark, senior Bernie Stenson, and frosh
Steve Baxter. Baxter, from Palo Alto High School,
has been a pleasant surprise for the UCLA coaching
staff since he currently has one of the ten fastest
times in the 200 fly.
In the backstroke the Bruins have two good 100
yard performers in Paul Benson and Steve Doyle.
Both Benson and Doyle have been NCAA finalists in
the 100 back, but Stanford's Randy Whitchurch,
who currently has the third fastest 200 backstroke
in the country should be able to defeat both of
them in the longer event.
Sprinters
UCLA relies on Barry Townsend and freshman
Brad Anderson in the sprints, with help from soph
Tim McDonnell. Townsend a NCAA finalist in
50 free will be tested by Cardinal's Dean Anderson
and Steve Carey, both currently ranked in the top
ten in this event.
Anderson will be the Bruin's hope in the 100
free, but will be facing Stanford's Anderson and
Martin Pedley. Pedley and Anderson are currently in
the top ten in the latest national rankings.
