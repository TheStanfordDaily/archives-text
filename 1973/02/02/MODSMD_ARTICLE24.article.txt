# Cards Face Alums In Baseball Opener
## 
### SCOTT DAILEY 
Embarking on a 60-game
season, the longest in the school's
history, the Stanford Cardinals
open the 1973 baseball season
tomorrow afternoon when they
host the Alumni in a 2:00 p.m.
game at Sunken Diamond.
Coach Ray Young's Cards will
play five games a week—single
games on Mondays, Wednesdays
and Fridays, and a doubleheader
on Saturdays—until Spring Break,
when they will defend their title
in the UC-Riverside Tournament.
At Riverside, Stanford will be
trying for its third tournament

championship against national
champion Southern California,
nationally ranked Arizona State,
and powerful UC-Riverside.
Tomorrow the Cards will face
Cleveland Indian pitching star
Steve Dunning and Sandy Vance,
a promising hurler for the Los
Angeles Dodgers. Cleveland
shortstop Frank Duffy, Kansas
City outfielder Rod Boone and
Card Frosh-Soph Coach Mark
Marquess will also play for the
alumni.
Tom Williams, who led the
NCAA District 8 last year with a
.430 batting average and was the
Cards' most valuable player will
also appear.
Coach Young has not yet
announced his starting pitcher,
but either Dan Shaw or Bob
DiPietro could conceivably draw
the assignment. Senior
righthander Shaw has a 19-8
record and a 2.40 ERA over his
two varsity seasons. DiPietro, a
junior southpaw, threw four
shutouts last year, compiling an
8-4 record and a 2.58 ERA.
Other probable starters are
three-year letterman Glen
Johnson and Mike Nelson in the
outfield, and Bob Reece, also a
three-year letterwinner, at
catcher. Heavy-hitting Mike
Lucich will probably start at first
base, and Mickey Aguirre should
get the call at third.
Bob Hampton, a probable
starter in left field, is one of seven
sophomores whom Coach Young
hopes will give the team some
needed depth this year. The Cards
are also carrying one freshman on
the roster—pitcher Ken Grolle.
"We're pretty much a veteran
ballclub this year, b'ut the key to
the ballclub will be its depth if

our sophomores come along the
way we think they will," Young
said earlier this week. "We've been
contenders every year, but every
time we've come down the
stretch, someone's been injured
and we haven't had anyone to
back him up. This year we're
hoping we've solved our depth
problems."
The addition of Grolle and
sophomores A 1 Arthur and Jim
Dudley to the pitching staff
should bolster a mound crew
which was fourth in the
conference last year with a
combined ERA of 3.68.
Grolle is an outstanding
prospect with a good fastball and
an effective change-of-pace.
Arthur, who as 6-4 for the junior
varsity team last year, and
Dudley, who was 4-2 with the JV

club, will add depth to the staff.
Dave Frost, a letterman last
year and a started on Stanford's
basketball team, will return to the
mound after basketball season.
Frost was 4-0 in 1972. Max
Goldstein, a safety on the varsity
football team for two seasons, will
also pitch for the Cards.
Once again, the Cards will be a
powerful team at the plate,
Aguirre, Hampton, Reece, and
Nelson all hit over .300 last
season. Nelson hammered the ball
at a .353 clip, and hit seven home
runs in 46 games. Shortstop Al
O'Brien hit .296 in 1972.
Said Young, "I've never had a
team that has worked as hard as
this one. We're much more
confident this year. We're going to
concentrate on being consistent
and on being solid."

nationally ranked Arizona State,
and powerful UC-Riverside.
Tomorrow the Cards will face
Cleveland Indian pitching star
Steve Dunning and Sandy Vance,
a promising hurler for the Los
Angeles Dodgers. Cleveland
shortstop Frank Duffy, Kansas
City outfielder Rod Boone and
Card Frosh-Soph Coach Mark
Marquess will also play for the
alumni.
Tom Williams, who led the
NCAA District 8 last year with a
.430 batting average and was the
Cards' most valuable player will
also appear.
Coach Young has not yet
announced his starting pitcher,
but either Dan Shaw or Bob
DiPietro could conceivably draw
the assignment. Senior
righthander Shaw has a 19-8
record and a 2.40 ERA over his
two varsity seasons. DiPietro, a
junior southpaw, threw four
shutouts last year, compiling an
8-4 record and a 2.58 ERA.
Other probable starters are
three-year letterman Glen
Johnson and Mike Nelson in the
outfield, and Bob Reece, also a
three-year letterwinner, at
catcher. Heavy-hitting Mike
Lucich will probably start at first
base, and Mickey Aguirre should
get the call at third.
Bob Hampton, a probable
starter in left field, is one of seven
sophomores whom Coach Young
hopes will give the team some
needed depth this year. The Cards
are also carrying one freshman on
the roster—pitcher Ken Grolle.
"We're pretty much a veteran
ballclub this year, b'ut the key to
the ballclub will be its depth if

our sophomores come along the
way we think they will," Young
said earlier this week. "We've been
contenders every year, but every
time we've come down the
stretch, someone's been injured
and we haven't had anyone to
back him up. This year we're
hoping we've solved our depth
problems."
The addition of Grolle and
sophomores A 1 Arthur and Jim
Dudley to the pitching staff
should bolster a mound crew
which was fourth in the
conference last year with a
combined ERA of 3.68.
Grolle is an outstanding
prospect with a good fastball and
an effective change-of-pace.
Arthur, who as 6-4 for the junior
varsity team last year, and
Dudley, who was 4-2 with the JV

club, will add depth to the staff.
Dave Frost, a letterman last
year and a started on Stanford's
basketball team, will return to the
mound after basketball season.
Frost was 4-0 in 1972. Max
Goldstein, a safety on the varsity
football team for two seasons, will
also pitch for the Cards.
Once again, the Cards will be a
powerful team at the plate,
Aguirre, Hampton, Reece, and
Nelson all hit over .300 last
season. Nelson hammered the ball
at a .353 clip, and hit seven home
runs in 46 games. Shortstop Al
O'Brien hit .296 in 1972.
Said Young, "I've never had a
team that has worked as hard as
this one. We're much more
confident this year. We're going to
concentrate on being consistent
and on being solid."
Embarking on a 60-game
season, the longest in the school's
history, the Stanford Cardinals
open the 1973 baseball season
tomorrow afternoon when they
host the Alumni in a 2:00 p.m.
game at Sunken Diamond.
Coach Ray Young's Cards will
play five games a week—single
games on Mondays, Wednesdays
and Fridays, and a doubleheader
on Saturdays—until Spring Break,
when they will defend their title
in the UC-Riverside Tournament.
At Riverside, Stanford will be
trying for its third tournament

championship against national
champion Southern California,
nationally ranked Arizona State,
and powerful UC-Riverside.
