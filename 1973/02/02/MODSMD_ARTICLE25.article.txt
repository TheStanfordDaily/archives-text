Kissinger Interviewed
WASHINGTON — Presidential adviser Henry A. Kissinger
said yesterday the chances for a lasting Vietnam peace
depend on the attitudes of China and the Soviet Union as
well as the Vietnamese people.
"All countries, including ourselves, have to ask" what
is at stake in deciding their policy in Vietnam, Kissinger
said, adding there is no agreement with Moscow and
Peking but he expects the two big Communist powers to
be restrained.
Kissinger was interviewed in his White House office by
CBS diplomatic correspondent Marvin Kalb in his first
full-scale question-and-answer session with a single
American broadcast reporter.
The biggest task to be accomplished now in Vietnam,
Kissinger said, "is to move a generation that has known
nothing but war toward" peace.
"I don't trust the good will" of the Vietnam parties, he
said, but added that a variety of conditions indicate a real
opportunity for a lasting settlement.
The terms of the agreement "are firm and specific" and
couldn't be any tighter, he said. In addition, Kissinger
stated, there is no reason to assume Hanoi can accumulate
enough arms in the next two or three years to launch a
major offensive.
In the meantime, the South Vietnamese have been
provided with sufficient equipment to handle any
foreseeable violation of the cease-fire.
But in any event, a true end to the fighting "depends in
part on the Vietnamese and in part" on outside forces,
said Kissinger, who negotiated the Vietnam cease-fire. He
said he thinks China and the Soviet Union will act
responsibly.
When Kalb asked the presidential adviser about the
American commitment to the Saigon government,
Kissinger answered that any future military assistance is
defined by the terms of the agreement and in relation to
the military situation.
As to South Vietnamese President Nguyen Van Thieu's
statement that he would not ask for reintroduction of
American ground troops if fighting broke out, but would
expect U.S. air power, Kissinger said:
"It is legally correct that we have the right to do
so ... it depends on the extent of the challenge, the
nature of the threat."
But he emphasized it would be unwise for any
responsible American official to "provide a checklist" of
what the United States might or might not do.
Fighting Ebbs In Vietnam
SAIGON — Fighting ebbed across South Vietnam
yesterday amid glimmers of hope that peacekeeping
commissions were finally on their way toward policing the
frail cease-fire.
Another 70 North Vietnamese delegates to the
four-party Joint Military Commission were to arrive in
Saigon during the next few days. Sunday was reported as
the target date for the Communist representatives to be
deployed to seven regional field headquarters.
The timetable for the start of field operations by the
Joint Military Commission hinges on agreement among its
four members, the United States, North and South
Vietnam and the Viet Cong.
American commission members are in place, drawn for
the most part from U.S. advisory teams already operating
in the regions.
The commission itself has been bogged down by
diplomatic haggling and charges of cease-fire violations
and has been meeting only at the deputy chief level.

Court Rules On Clean-Air Standard
WASHINGTON — A federal appeals court has required
nationwide compliance with clean-air standards by
mid-1975, wiping out the two-year delays previously
granted 18 states, including California.
The court allowed for eventual reinstatement of the
extensions if carefully justified, but it insisted on "interim
measures of control" going at least part way toward the
full standards.
That seemed to mean many urban areas would have to
impose some transportation controls to reduce smog,
while working toward a more complete clean-up.
The decision was won late Wednesday by the Natural
Resources Defense Council, a citizen environment group,
in a lawsuit against the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency.
David Hawkins, NRDC lawyer, said yesterday the
threat of transportation controls might spark some public
"backlash" against the environment movement; he said he
was urging EPA to counteract that tendency with a public
education campaign.
Stennis' Condition Improves
WASHINGTON — Sen. John C. Stennis, who was shot
twice during a street robbery near his Washington home,
was reported showing definite improvement yesterday at
Walter Reed Army Medical Center.
Maj. Frank Garland, a spokesman for the hospital, said
the 71-year-old Mississippi Democratic senator had been
removed from the surgical recovery room and had been
taken to a private room in the intensive care suite. Stennis
no longer requires the need of a respirator to aid his
breathing, Garland said.
Garland said the chairman of the powerful Senate
Armed Services Committee is able to speak, is alert and
conversant.
Bonn Debates Sex, TV Reforms
BONN, Germany — West German lawmakers are debating
a package of legal reforms that would liberalize outdated
sex laws but crack down on television violence to protect
minors.
Provisions of the bill include lowering the permissible
age limit for homosexual acts between consenting males
from 21 to 18, permitting the now restricted sale of
pornography and lifting an outright ban on such activities
as wife-swapping.
The government bill, which was referred to a
parliamentary committee yesterday after an opening
debate in the lower house, reflects considerable changes in
moral attitudes since existing sex laws were drafted up to
a century ago.
One of the main targets for reform in the bill, which
seeks to protect "the freedom of the individual to sexual
determination" and"the unhindered sexual development
of the young person," is a paragraph in the 1871 penal
code banning procuring in any form.
Another proposal aimed mainly at protecting children
from exposure to TV violence would punish
"glorification" of brutality in communications media with
heavy fines or as much as a year's imprisonment.

measures of control" going at least part way toward the
full standards.
That seemed to mean many urban areas would have to
impose some transportation controls to reduce smog,
while working toward a more complete clean-up.
The decision was won late Wednesday by the Natural
Resources Defense Council, a citizen environment group,
in a lawsuit against the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency.
David Hawkins, NRDC lawyer, said yesterday the
threat of transportation controls might spark some public
"backlash" against the environment movement; he said he
was urging EPA to counteract that tendency with a public
education campaign.
Stennis' Condition Improves
WASHINGTON — Sen. John C. Stennis, who was shot
twice during a street robbery near his Washington home,
was reported showing definite improvement yesterday at
Walter Reed Army Medical Center.
Maj. Frank Garland, a spokesman for the hospital, said
the 71-year-old Mississippi Democratic senator had been
removed from the surgical recovery room and had been
taken to a private room in the intensive care suite. Stennis
no longer requires the need of a respirator to aid his
breathing, Garland said.
Garland said the chairman of the powerful Senate
Armed Services Committee is able to speak, is alert and
conversant.
Bonn Debates Sex, TV Reforms
BONN, Germany — West German lawmakers are debating
a package of legal reforms that would liberalize outdated
sex laws but crack down on television violence to protect
minors.
Provisions of the bill include lowering the permissible
age limit for homosexual acts between consenting males
from 21 to 18, permitting the now restricted sale of
pornography and lifting an outright ban on such activities
as wife-swapping.
The government bill, which was referred to a
parliamentary committee yesterday after an opening
debate in the lower house, reflects considerable changes in
moral attitudes since existing sex laws were drafted up to
a century ago.
One of the main targets for reform in the bill, which
seeks to protect "the freedom of the individual to sexual
determination" and"the unhindered sexual development
of the young person," is a paragraph in the 1871 penal
code banning procuring in any form.
Another proposal aimed mainly at protecting children
from exposure to TV violence would punish
"glorification" of brutality in communications media with
heavy fines or as much as a year's imprisonment.
Today's Weather

Kissinger Interviewed
WASHINGTON — Presidential adviser Henry A. Kissinger
said yesterday the chances for a lasting Vietnam peace
depend on the attitudes of China and the Soviet Union as
well as the Vietnamese people.
"All countries, including ourselves, have to ask" what
is at stake in deciding their policy in Vietnam, Kissinger
said, adding there is no agreement with Moscow and
Peking but he expects the two big Communist powers to
be restrained.
Kissinger was interviewed in his White House office by
CBS diplomatic correspondent Marvin Kalb in his first
full-scale question-and-answer session with a single
American broadcast reporter.
The biggest task to be accomplished now in Vietnam,
Kissinger said, "is to move a generation that has known
nothing but war toward" peace.
"I don't trust the good will" of the Vietnam parties, he
said, but added that a variety of conditions indicate a real
opportunity for a lasting settlement.
The terms of the agreement "are firm and specific" and
couldn't be any tighter, he said. In addition, Kissinger
stated, there is no reason to assume Hanoi can accumulate
enough arms in the next two or three years to launch a
major offensive.
In the meantime, the South Vietnamese have been
provided with sufficient equipment to handle any
foreseeable violation of the cease-fire.
But in any event, a true end to the fighting "depends in
part on the Vietnamese and in part" on outside forces,
said Kissinger, who negotiated the Vietnam cease-fire. He
said he thinks China and the Soviet Union will act
responsibly.
When Kalb asked the presidential adviser about the
American commitment to the Saigon government,
Kissinger answered that any future military assistance is
defined by the terms of the agreement and in relation to
the military situation.
As to South Vietnamese President Nguyen Van Thieu's
statement that he would not ask for reintroduction of
American ground troops if fighting broke out, but would
expect U.S. air power, Kissinger said:
"It is legally correct that we have the right to do
so ... it depends on the extent of the challenge, the
nature of the threat."
But he emphasized it would be unwise for any
responsible American official to "provide a checklist" of
what the United States might or might not do.
Fighting Ebbs In Vietnam
SAIGON — Fighting ebbed across South Vietnam
yesterday amid glimmers of hope that peacekeeping
commissions were finally on their way toward policing the
frail cease-fire.
Another 70 North Vietnamese delegates to the
four-party Joint Military Commission were to arrive in
Saigon during the next few days. Sunday was reported as
the target date for the Communist representatives to be
deployed to seven regional field headquarters.
The timetable for the start of field operations by the
Joint Military Commission hinges on agreement among its
four members, the United States, North and South
Vietnam and the Viet Cong.
American commission members are in place, drawn for
the most part from U.S. advisory teams already operating
in the regions.
The commission itself has been bogged down by
diplomatic haggling and charges of cease-fire violations
and has been meeting only at the deputy chief level.

Court Rules On Clean-Air Standard
WASHINGTON — A federal appeals court has required
nationwide compliance with clean-air standards by
mid-1975, wiping out the two-year delays previously

said, but added that a variety of conditions indicate a real
opportunity for a lasting settlement.
The terms of the agreement "are firm and specific" and
couldn't be any tighter, he said. In addition, Kissinger
stated, there is no reason to assume Hanoi can accumulate
enough arms in the next two or three years to launch a
major offensive.
In the meantime, the South Vietnamese have been
provided with sufficient equipment to handle any
foreseeable violation of the cease-fire.
But in any event, a true end to the fighting "depends in
part on the Vietnamese and in part" on outside forces,
said Kissinger, who negotiated the Vietnam cease-fire. He
said he thinks China and the Soviet Union will act
responsibly.
When Kalb asked the presidential adviser about the
American commitment to the Saigon government,
Kissinger answered that any future military assistance is
defined by the terms of the agreement and in relation to
the military situation.
As to South Vietnamese President Nguyen Van Thieu's
statement that he would not ask for reintroduction of
American ground troops if fighting broke out, but would
expect U.S. air power, Kissinger said:
"It is legally correct that we have the right to do
so ... it depends on the extent of the challenge, the
nature of the threat."
But he emphasized it would be unwise for any
responsible American official to "provide a checklist" of
what the United States might or might not do.
Fighting Ebbs In Vietnam
SAIGON — Fighting ebbed across South Vietnam
yesterday amid glimmers of hope that peacekeeping
commissions were finally on their way toward policing the
frail cease-fire.
Another 70 North Vietnamese delegates to the
four-party Joint Military Commission were to arrive in
Saigon during the next few days. Sunday was reported as
the target date for the Communist representatives to be
deployed to seven regional field headquarters.
The timetable for the start of field operations by the
Joint Military Commission hinges on agreement among its
four members, the United States, North and South
Vietnam and the Viet Cong.
American commission members are in place, drawn for
the most part from U.S. advisory teams already operating
in the regions.
The commission itself has been bogged down by
diplomatic haggling and charges of cease-fire violations
and has been meeting only at the deputy chief level.

Court Rules On Clean-Air Standard
WASHINGTON — A federal appeals court has required
nationwide compliance with clean-air standards by
mid-1975, wiping out the two-year delays previously
granted 18 states, including California.
The court allowed for eventual reinstatement of the
extensions if carefully justified, but it insisted on "interim
measures of control" going at least part way toward the
full standards.
That seemed to mean many urban areas would have to
impose some transportation controls to reduce smog,
while working toward a more complete clean-up.
The decision was won late Wednesday by the Natural
Resources Defense Council, a citizen environment group,
in a lawsuit against the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency.
David Hawkins, NRDC lawyer, said yesterday the
threat of transportation controls might spark some public
"backlash" against the environment movement; he said he
was urging EPA to counteract that tendency with a public
education campaign.
Stennis' Condition Improves
WASHINGTON — Sen. John C. Stennis, who was shot
twice during a street robbery near his Washington home,
was reported showing definite improvement yesterday at
Walter Reed Army Medical Center.
Maj. Frank Garland, a spokesman for the hospital, said
the 71-year-old Mississippi Democratic senator had been
removed from the surgical recovery room and had been
taken to a private room in the intensive care suite. Stennis
no longer requires the need of a respirator to aid his
breathing, Garland said.
Garland said the chairman of the powerful Senate
Armed Services Committee is able to speak, is alert and
conversant.
Bonn Debates Sex, TV Reforms
BONN, Germany — West German lawmakers are debating
a package of legal reforms that would liberalize outdated
sex laws but crack down on television violence to protect
minors.
Provisions of the bill include lowering the permissible
age limit for homosexual acts between consenting males
from 21 to 18, permitting the now restricted sale of
pornography and lifting an outright ban on such activities
as wife-swapping.
The government bill, which was referred to a
parliamentary committee yesterday after an opening
debate in the lower house, reflects considerable changes in
moral attitudes since existing sex laws were drafted up to
a century ago.
One of the main targets for reform in the bill, which
seeks to protect "the freedom of the individual to sexual
determination" and"the unhindered sexual development
of the young person," is a paragraph in the 1871 penal
code banning procuring in any form.
Another proposal aimed mainly at protecting children
from exposure to TV violence would punish
"glorification" of brutality in communications media with
heavy fines or as much as a year's imprisonment.

Kissinger Interviewed
WASHINGTON — Presidential adviser Henry A. Kissinger
said yesterday the chances for a lasting Vietnam peace
depend on the attitudes of China and the Soviet Union as
well as the Vietnamese people.
"All countries, including ourselves, have to ask" what
is at stake in deciding their policy in Vietnam, Kissinger
said, adding there is no agreement with Moscow and
Peking but he expects the two big Communist powers to
be restrained.
Kissinger was interviewed in his White House office by
CBS diplomatic correspondent Marvin Kalb in his first
full-scale question-and-answer session with a single
American broadcast reporter.
The biggest task to be accomplished now in Vietnam,
Kissinger said, "is to move a generation that has known
nothing but war toward" peace.
"I don't trust the good will" of the Vietnam parties, he
said, but added that a variety of conditions indicate a real
opportunity for a lasting settlement.
The terms of the agreement "are firm and specific" and
