# Interest In Recycling Wanes

### 
Recycling centers have succumbed
to apathy on Stanford's campus. The
last remaining center, located in the
Wilbur Parking lot, closed last winter
due to a lack of manpower,
campus-wide organization, and
interest.
Ecology House residents manned
the center until a general decline of
support forced them to abandon the
project. Ron Rich, an Ecology House
resident, says the lack of enthusiasm
stems from reaction to publication of
a study on the actualities of recycling.
The study pointed out the futility
of attempts to recycle cans, glass, and
paper. Its findings implied that
continuation of the Wilbur Center
recycling efforts would be almost
ludicrous.
A four-man research group, led by
Sid Liebus, conducted the study here
last fall as a SCIRE project.
The most persuasive finding of the
study was the discrepancy between the
attempt to save energy as compared to
actual expenditure of energy. The
group determined the amount of
energy used by a car to transport small
loads of recyclable cans equalled the
energy needed to make new cans from
scratch.
"If you have a truck, it's not so
bad," commented Rich. "Energy-wise,
it's feasible."
Recycling Centers also
accomplished little in the conservation
of mineral resources, according to the
SCIRE study. Collected bimetal cans
are shipped to a San Francisco

Chemical Company where the outer
coatings are burned off. Then a copper
company dissolves acid from the
remaining metal compounds to use as
catalysts for purifying copper ore.
The useless iron sulfate precipitate is
discarded after the procedure.
Aluminum companies melt down
aluminum cans for use in other
aluminum products. Pure aluminum is
not obtained in this procedure because
the tops of the cans are not made of
the same alloys as the sides.
Glass recycling efforts also
encounter problems. Only about one
percent of collected glass is recycled.
Rich views recyclable glass bottles
as the best solution to glass recycling
problems. Bottling companies,
however, lose money on the thicker
bottles because customers discard
them.
On a large scale, paper recycling
continues to be effective, the study
team reported.

Richard Jerome, a former volunteei
at the defunct center, stated that the
report in itself did not have sufficienl
impact upon the students to cause the
center to fail. He attributed the
center's demise to a "visceral lack of
committment."
No further plans have been made
for similar recycling efforts.

ludicrous.
A four-man research group, led by
Sid Liebus, conducted the study here
last fall as a SCIRE project.
The most persuasive finding of the
study was the discrepancy between the
attempt to save energy as compared to
actual expenditure of energy. The
group determined the amount of
energy used by a car to transport small
loads of recyclable cans equalled the
energy needed to make new cans from
scratch.
"If you have a truck, it's not so
bad," commented Rich. "Energy-wise,
it's feasible."
Recycling Centers also
accomplished little in the conservation
of mineral resources, according to the
SCIRE study. Collected bimetal cans
are shipped to a San Francisco

Chemical Company where the outer
coatings are burned off. Then a copper
company dissolves acid from the
remaining metal compounds to use as
catalysts for purifying copper ore.
The useless iron sulfate precipitate is
discarded after the procedure.
Aluminum companies melt down
aluminum cans for use in other
aluminum products. Pure aluminum is
not obtained in this procedure because
the tops of the cans are not made of
the same alloys as the sides.
Glass recycling efforts also
encounter problems. Only about one
percent of collected glass is recycled.
Rich views recyclable glass bottles
as the best solution to glass recycling
problems. Bottling companies,
however, lose money on the thicker
bottles because customers discard
them.
On a large scale, paper recycling
continues to be effective, the study
team reported.

Richard Jerome, a former volunteei
at the defunct center, stated that the
report in itself did not have sufficienl
impact upon the students to cause the
center to fail. He attributed the
center's demise to a "visceral lack of
committment."
No further plans have been made
for similar recycling efforts.
