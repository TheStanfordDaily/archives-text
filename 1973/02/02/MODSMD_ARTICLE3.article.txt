# Ellsberg Mistrial Move Expected
## 
### 
From The Associated Press
The defense in the "Pentagon
Papers" trial in Los Angeles will move
for a mistrial today, following
yesterday's conflicting testimony over
whether or not orders were ever issued
to remove analyses that could prove
helpful to defendants Dr. Daniel
Ellsberg and Anthony J. Russo Jr.
Defense attorneys are expected to
argue that large segments of the
15-count indictment against Ellsberg
and Russo are not supported by the

prosecution's own evidence and
studies and that the prosecution's
failure to disclose this material has
jeopardized the defendants' right to a
fair trial.
During yesterday's testimony,
Charles Hinkle, director of the Defense
Department's Office of Security
Review, told presiding Judge Matt
Byrne Jr. that he had "no
recollection" of receiving orders to
hide or remove the analyses of the
"Papers" or having dictated a

memorandum to his personal files
about such an order.
Earlier, defense witness Lt. Col.
Edward A. Miller, who served under
Hinkle's command in the security
review office, testified that Hinkle had
been ordered to purge the files, had
dictated a memo for his own personal
files, and that he, Miller, had discussed
the memo with Hinkle.
Not Harmful
Miller, now retired, testified that he
had prepared analyses of nine volumes
of the "Pentagon Papers" stating that
the release of the "Papers" in 1969,
the time period specified in the
indictment, was not harmful to the
national defense.
The defense has attempted to
obtain these reports since April, 1972,
on the grounds that they contain
"exculpatory" material — that is,
material that could be used to
demonstrate the innocence of the
defendants. Under the terms of a 1963
Supreme Court decision, Brady vs
Maryland, the prosecution is required
to turn over to the defense all
exculpatory material that it has.
In addition, Byme has issued
several standing orders that any such
analyses, which the Defense
Department frequently terms "damage
reports," be turned over to him for in
camera examination.
Prosecutor David Nissen steadfastly
has denied that any "damage reports"
existed, even though prosecution
witnesses have testified that more than
20 such reports were sent to him while
he was preparing the litigation against
Ellsberg and Russo.
A total of 37 analyses have now
been turned over to Byrne, and Byrne
has turned over to the defense reports
that contain exculpatory material
dealing with 10 of the 20 documents
the defendants are accused of
compromising.
Conflicting Testimony
During two days of testimony,
Miller told the court that he was
assigned to write the analyses on Dec.
15, 1971 — shortly before a Los
Angeles grand jury returned a second,
superceding indictment against

Ellsberg and Russo — during a
Pentagon meeting that government
witnesses have repeatedly testified
never took place.
J. Fred Buzhardt, the Defense
Department's general counsel, testified
earlier this week that Miller wrote the
reports on a "voluntary" basis to
occupy his spare time.
Defense attorney Charles Nesson
charged in court that it was Buzhardt
who ordered the reports stricken from
Pentagon files. Nesson alleged that
Buzhardt made the request to Defense
Department spokesman Jerry W.
Friedheim, who in turn passed it along
to Hinkle.
Buzhardt testified that Miller's
reports, which were highly critical of
the "Top Secret" classification given
to the "Papers," did not reflect
Defense Department policy. He also
told the court that he had never heard
of Miller's reports until the night
before his testimony.
Denial Of Meeting
Frank A. Bartimo, the
government's first witness when
testimony in the trial began
two-and-one-half weeks ago, denied
for at least the third time that any
meeting about the "Papers" took place
in his office on Dec. 15. Earlier, he
told the court that his "office logs"
for 1971 had been destroyed.
However, Bartimo told Byrne that
one member of his staff, William
Gerhart — the Pentagon analyst who
prepared nearly 20 analyses of the
"Papers" — does remember the Dec.
15 meeting. Observers believe that
Byrne may order Gerhart to Los
Angeles early next week to testify
about the meeting and the reports that
he prepared.
The trial has been snagged on the
problem of the exculpatory material
all week. The jurors have been ordered
to report to court Monday, but it
appears that the delay could continue
through part of the week and that
defense attorneys could ask for a
lengthy recess to study the material
that has been ordered turned over by
Byrne.
