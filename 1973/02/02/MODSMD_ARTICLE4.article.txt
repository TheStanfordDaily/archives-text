# Grand Jury Investigates Alleged Venceremos Role In Chino Case
## 
### ED KOHN 
A special federal grand jury is
meeting in San Francisco to investigate
Venceremos' alleged role in the
October, 1972 escape of Chino
prisoner Ronald Wayne Beaty, a
spokesman for the National Lawyers
Guild grand jury office said yesterday.
Barbara Hyland, a former Stanford
student who is now a Venceremos
member, said that the Justice
Department's Internal Security
Division has convened the grand jury
to return indictments against fired
English Prof. H. Bruce Franklin and
three other Venceremos members or

former members in connection with
Beaty's jailbreak.
Hyland said the grand jury has been
meeting for about three weeks. She
described most of the witnesses who
have testified so far as "police or FBI
types."
Charges Dropped
Earlier federal charges of harboring
a fugitive against Franklin and three
others were dropped Jan. 5. At that
time, police officials announced that
they would seek grand jury
indictments against the four.
Hyland said that a young Mountain
View machinist and his wife were

jailed Wednesday for refusing to
answer questions before the grand
jury. She said that Guy Goodwin, head
of the Internal Security Division's
Special Litigation Section, directed the
questioning, aided by an assistant U.S.
attorney.
Goodwin has led numerous other
federal probes into alleged radical
activities, including the Seattle grand
jury that indicted Leslie Bacon in
connection with the 1970 bombing of
the U.S. Capitol building. Those
charges later were dropped.
The machinist, Milton J. Taulbee,
and his wife, Laura, could be jailed for
three months â€” the expected life of
the grand jury, Hyland said. She said
most of the questions asked of the
Taulbees dealt with Beaty's
whereabouts shortly after his escape
from Chino.
Limited Immunity
The Taulbees, who apparently are
not members of Venceremos, were
granted limited ("use") immunity, but
still refused to testify before the grand
jury. They then were jailed by U.S.
District Court Judge Spencer Williams.
Williams later denied a motion for
bail. David S. Maguire, the Taulbee's
attorney, said he plans to appeal their
jailing Monday or Tuesday to the
Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
on a number of grounds, including
marital privilege.
Beaty, who was recaptured on Dec.
11, 1972, allegedly has told police that
Venceremos members, including
Franklin, aided in his escape and his
flight from law enforcement officers.
A Venceremos member at the time
of his escape, Beaty has led San
Bernardino County sherrif's
investigators to a large cache of
dynamite, which he said he had been
told about by another Chino inmate.
[United Press International reported
that the 174 pounds of dynamite were
blown up yesterday near Bakersfield. ]
This is the second special Internal
Security Division grand jury to be
convened in the Bay Area in recent
months. Another grand jury, also
initially led by Goodwin, was
convened in October to conduct an
investigation into alleged Weatherman
activities and federal fugitives. That

grand jury, which could last until
April, 1974, jailed a man from Oregon
last week for refusing to answer
questions, but otherwise has been
relatively inactive since Christmastime.
