# To Finance European Tour
## Glee Club Steps Up Fund Drive 
### JON BRAUN 
The Glee Club has embarked on a
$65,000 fund drive to finance a spring
tour of Germany, Austria, Italy and
Switzerland by its 60 student
members.
Without University assistance, Glee
Club President Darian Morray and
Music Director Robert MacKinnon
plan to raise funds from parents,
students and alumni. Club spokesmen
say $30,000 in pledges or gifts have
already been received, and a heavy
schedule of local concerts promises to
carry the campaign throughout the
community.
Planning for the European tour
began last spring after the Glee Club's
successful tour of Southern California.
However, according to Morray, "One
of the problems we had in fund raising

through contributions — parents,
students, and alumni — was in
coordinating with the University
petitions." Thus, the Glee Club has
cooperated with the University
Development Office for alumni
appeals. Contributions remain the
emphasis of the club's drive, but
several projects are already planned in
the campus community.
Candy booths have been set up at
Dinkelspiel Auditorium performances
and evening flicks.
On Feb. 8, the Glee Club will
sponsor a bike race over a 20-mile
course. On Feb. 24, a "Fifties" dance
is planned at Branner Hall. The club
plans to perform on campus, in Palo
Alto and throughout the Bay Area in
support of the tour. In late February,
a major benefit performance will be

held at Gunn High School auditorium,
in the hope of drawing support from
the local community. The Glee Club
petitioned unsuccessfully to bring a
one dollar refundable fee assessment
to vote of the student body for the
Spring Quarter.
The group will change its
performance format for the European
tour. The show will be divided into
two parts, the first acappella and the
second accompanied by an orchestra
of students and professionals. Morray
described the group's appeal: "We're
really a lively, carefree group. On
campus, we're a very active part of the
community. We always perform on
campus for free; I think we spread a
lot of joy." The Glee Club divides its
performance between classical
repertoire folk music, and popular and
show medleys.
The Glee Club cannot tour if fund
raising and contributions don't match
costs. "We have until the end of
February for our second deposit to the
tour agency, and if it appears that we
can't make it, we'll have to call it off,"
Morray said. "Many people, when they
hear the fact that we have to raise
$65,000, just laugh. But I have a
feeling we'll make it. There's one thing
for certain, and it is that the way we'll
make it is through contributions.
When you sing together, work
together, sweat together, pretty soon
you have to be optimistic."

community.
Planning for the European tour
began last spring after the Glee Club's
successful tour of Southern California.
However, according to Morray, "One
of the problems we had in fund raising

through contributions — parents,
students, and alumni — was in
coordinating with the University
petitions." Thus, the Glee Club has
cooperated with the University
Development Office for alumni
appeals. Contributions remain the
emphasis of the club's drive, but
several projects are already planned in
the campus community.
Candy booths have been set up at
Dinkelspiel Auditorium performances
and evening flicks.
On Feb. 8, the Glee Club will
sponsor a bike race over a 20-mile
course. On Feb. 24, a "Fifties" dance
is planned at Branner Hall. The club
plans to perform on campus, in Palo
Alto and throughout the Bay Area in
support of the tour. In late February,
a major benefit performance will be

held at Gunn High School auditorium,
in the hope of drawing support from
the local community. The Glee Club
petitioned unsuccessfully to bring a
one dollar refundable fee assessment
to vote of the student body for the
Spring Quarter.
The group will change its
performance format for the European
tour. The show will be divided into
two parts, the first acappella and the
second accompanied by an orchestra
of students and professionals. Morray
described the group's appeal: "We're
really a lively, carefree group. On
campus, we're a very active part of the
community. We always perform on
campus for free; I think we spread a
lot of joy." The Glee Club divides its
performance between classical
repertoire folk music, and popular and
show medleys.
The Glee Club cannot tour if fund
raising and contributions don't match
costs. "We have until the end of
February for our second deposit to the
tour agency, and if it appears that we
can't make it, we'll have to call it off,"
Morray said. "Many people, when they
hear the fact that we have to raise
$65,000, just laugh. But I have a
feeling we'll make it. There's one thing
for certain, and it is that the way we'll
make it is through contributions.
When you sing together, work
together, sweat together, pretty soon
you have to be optimistic."
The Glee Club has embarked on a
$65,000 fund drive to finance a spring
tour of Germany, Austria, Italy and
Switzerland by its 60 student
members.
Without University assistance, Glee
Club President Darian Morray and
Music Director Robert MacKinnon
plan to raise funds from parents,
students and alumni. Club spokesmen
say $30,000 in pledges or gifts have
already been received, and a heavy
schedule of local concerts promises to
carry the campaign throughout the
community.
