# Accords Ambiguous
## Vietnamâ€”What Next? 
### 
5 Concerned Asian Scholars

The Vietnam accords signed last Saturday are
intentionally ambiguous concerning the future
status of Vietnam. Both sides felt such a cease-fire
was far better than no cease-fire at all. But for the
people of Vietnam, the resolution of these
ambiguities in the coming months will ultimately be
much more crucial than the initial cease-fire.
What, then, are the ambiguities in the Vietnam
accords and what are their possible resolutions?
The most important problem concerns prisoners
of war. For most Americans, the issue seems simple:
within sixty days, while U.S. troops withdraw from
South Vietnam, all U.S. POW's will be released.
However, the real issue of the POW problem is not
the release of U.S. prisoners, but the cooperation of
the Saigon regime in releasing North Vietnamese
and National Liberation Front military and political
prisoners. The accords clearly state that the
captured military personnel and foreign civilians of
the parties concerned shall be released within sixty
days. Therefore, if Thieu does not release North
Vietnamese POW's, the North Vietnamese have the
right to retain American POW's. And if the North
Vietnamese chose to exercise this right, the result
could be resumption of the war.
Political Prisoners
An even greater problem is the fate of the more
than 200,000 political prisoners held by President
Thieu (for comparison, there are slightly less than
600 U.S. POW's in North Vietnam). Only a
relatively small percentage of these political
prisoners are National Liberation Front supporters;
the majority constitute the backbone of the
neutralist Third Force in Vietnam. As an example,
the man who finished second in the 1967
presidential election won by Thieu has been in a
Saigon jail ever since.
The importance of this neutralist force can be
seen by examining the structure of the National
Council of Reconciliation, which will supervise the
eventual elections in South Vietnam. This National
Council will consist of three equal segments: the
NLF, Saigon, and a neutralist third party. Without
this strong, viable third force operative in all sectors
of Vietnamese society, there can be little hope for a
reconciliation and compromise between the other
two parties.
The text of the Vietnam accords states that both
Saigon and the NLF will discuss the release of these
political prisoners, and "will do their utmost to
resolve this question within 90 days after the
cease-fire will come into effect." Thus, three

months from last Saturday, the tone of the post-war
settlement will be set: if Saigon co-operates, there
may be the basis for a peaceful, democratic solution
in South Vietnam and eventual reunification with
the North; if not, there is a good likelihood that
fighting will again break out.
Historical Precedent
Although it is impossible to speculate now on the
resolution of these ambiguities, there is an historical
precedent we can turn to in discussing these issues.
At the 1954 Geneva Conference on Vietnam, a
temporary division of Vietnam was agreed to, with
elections in two years to unify the country by
peaceful and democratic means. There is no doubt
that these elections, to be held by 1956, were
stopped by then-President Diem, with the tacit
agreement of the United States. The major reason
for preventing the election was the expectation by
everyone (including President Eisenhower) that if
the election were to have taken place, Ho Chi Minh
would have won with about an 80% majority.
Strangely enough, Diem held elections in South
Vietnam in 1955, in which he captured 98.8% of
the vote against former Chief of State Bao Dai.
"Free and democratic" elections in South Vietnam
have a long and rather consistently lopsided history.
Another stipulation of the Geneva Accords was
establishment of an international commission to
supervise the cease-fire and plan for the 1956
elections. This International Commission for
Supervision and Control, in a report issued in
January, 1957, stated, "While the Commission has
experienced difficulties in North Vietnam, the
major part of its difficulties has arisen in South
Vietnam." Furthermore, during these same three
years, there is a great deal of evidence to indicate
that North Vietnam made many overtures for
low-level agreements to the South, all of which were
rejected by Diems government.
Since the 1954 Geneva Accords, almost twenty
years of continuous fighting have passed. One point
is perfectly clear: unless both parties in South
Vietnam want a settlement and are willing to
reconcile their differences, there will be no peace.
Those of us in the anti-war movement in this
country must continue to put pressure on the U.S.
government and Thieu's regime to see that this
cease-fire does lead to a truly "just and honorable"
peace.

The Vietnam accords signed last Saturday are
intentionally ambiguous concerning the future
status of Vietnam. Both sides felt such a cease-fire
was far better than no cease-fire at all. But for the
people of Vietnam, the resolution of these
ambiguities in the coming months will ultimately be
much more crucial than the initial cease-fire.
What, then, are the ambiguities in the Vietnam
accords and what are their possible resolutions?
The most important problem concerns prisoners
of war. For most Americans, the issue seems simple:
within sixty days, while U.S. troops withdraw from
South Vietnam, all U.S. POW's will be released.
However, the real issue of the POW problem is not
the release of U.S. prisoners, but the cooperation of
the Saigon regime in releasing North Vietnamese
and National Liberation Front military and political
prisoners. The accords clearly state that the
captured military personnel and foreign civilians of
the parties concerned shall be released within sixty
days. Therefore, if Thieu does not release North
Vietnamese POW's, the North Vietnamese have the
right to retain American POW's. And if the North
Vietnamese chose to exercise this right, the result
could be resumption of the war.
Political Prisoners
An even greater problem is the fate of the more
than 200,000 political prisoners held by President
Thieu (for comparison, there are slightly less than
600 U.S. POW's in North Vietnam). Only a
relatively small percentage of these political
prisoners are National Liberation Front supporters;
the majority constitute the backbone of the
neutralist Third Force in Vietnam. As an example,
the man who finished second in the 1967
presidential election won by Thieu has been in a
Saigon jail ever since.
The importance of this neutralist force can be
seen by examining the structure of the National
Council of Reconciliation, which will supervise the
eventual elections in South Vietnam. This National
Council will consist of three equal segments: the
NLF, Saigon, and a neutralist third party. Without
this strong, viable third force operative in all sectors
of Vietnamese society, there can be little hope for a
reconciliation and compromise between the other
two parties.
The text of the Vietnam accords states that both
Saigon and the NLF will discuss the release of these
political prisoners, and "will do their utmost to
resolve this question within 90 days after the
cease-fire will come into effect." Thus, three

months from last Saturday, the tone of the post-war
settlement will be set: if Saigon co-operates, there
may be the basis for a peaceful, democratic solution
in South Vietnam and eventual reunification with
the North; if not, there is a good likelihood that
fighting will again break out.
Historical Precedent
Although it is impossible to speculate now on the
resolution of these ambiguities, there is an historical
precedent we can turn to in discussing these issues.
At the 1954 Geneva Conference on Vietnam, a
temporary division of Vietnam was agreed to, with
elections in two years to unify the country by
peaceful and democratic means. There is no doubt
that these elections, to be held by 1956, were
stopped by then-President Diem, with the tacit
agreement of the United States. The major reason
for preventing the election was the expectation by
everyone (including President Eisenhower) that if
the election were to have taken place, Ho Chi Minh
would have won with about an 80% majority.
Strangely enough, Diem held elections in South
Vietnam in 1955, in which he captured 98.8% of
the vote against former Chief of State Bao Dai.
"Free and democratic" elections in South Vietnam
have a long and rather consistently lopsided history.
Another stipulation of the Geneva Accords was
establishment of an international commission to
supervise the cease-fire and plan for the 1956
elections. This International Commission for
Supervision and Control, in a report issued in
January, 1957, stated, "While the Commission has
experienced difficulties in North Vietnam, the
major part of its difficulties has arisen in South
Vietnam." Furthermore, during these same three
years, there is a great deal of evidence to indicate
that North Vietnam made many overtures for
low-level agreements to the South, all of which were
rejected by Diems government.

the vote against former Chief of State Bao Dai.
"Free and democratic" elections in South Vietnam
have a long and rather consistently lopsided history.
Another stipulation of the Geneva Accords was
establishment of an international commission to
supervise the cease-fire and plan for the 1956
elections. This International Commission for
Supervision and Control, in a report issued in
January, 1957, stated, "While the Commission has
experienced difficulties in North Vietnam, the
major part of its difficulties has arisen in South
Vietnam." Furthermore, during these same three
years, there is a great deal of evidence to indicate
that North Vietnam made many overtures for
low-level agreements to the South, all of which were
rejected by Diems government.
Since the 1954 Geneva Accords, almost twenty
years of continuous fighting have passed. One point
is perfectly clear: unless both parties in South
Vietnam want a settlement and are willing to
reconcile their differences, there will be no peace.
Those of us in the anti-war movement in this
country must continue to put pressure on the U.S.
government and Thieu's regime to see that this
cease-fire does lead to a truly "just and honorable"
peace.
