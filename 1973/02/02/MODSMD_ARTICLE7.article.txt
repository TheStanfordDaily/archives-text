# The
						Most Serious Problem
## Eugenics And Zero Growth 
### 
SHK Paul R. Ehrlich

I continue to be disturbed by
the frequent linkage of my views
(and the Zero Population Growth
movement) to the views of
Professor Shockley. In 1968 in
the first edition of The Population
Bomb I wrote (p. 188) about
questions of eugenics and whether
some people should breed and
others be sterilized:
"1. Intelligence in man has
both genetic and environmental
components. You might think of
each individual as having an
inherited possible range of
intelligence. His or her
environment—diet, home life,
schooling—determine what level
within that range is actually
achieved. This is an
oversimplification, but it is close
enough.
"2. If, over perhaps five
generations, those at the lower
end of the genetic intelligence
scale far outbred those at the
upper end, the average I.Q. in the
population could be expected to
be reduced by a few points.
"3. If such a change were
detected, average I.Q. could be
returned to its previous level by
the proper breeding program—that
is, the change would be reversible.
No Evidence
"4. There is no evidence that
any such drastic differential in
breeding exists.
"5. It is critical that we start
reducing the number of people in
this generation—worrying about
genetic effects over the next four
to five generations would be
pointless even if we detected a
differential today.
"6. Anyone really concerned
with raising the level of
intelligence in our population
should fight to raise the

environmental component. We
know that drastic increases can be
made in one generation by
improved home and school
situations and in some cases by
improved diet.
"7. Most geneticists feel that if
the genetic component of human
intelligence is to be manipulated
in the future, it is likely to be
dealt with biochemically by
treating individuals. Huge selective
breeding programs on populations
present many technical, social,
and political difficulties.
Cross-Cultural Testing
"8. Research is being done on
the estimation of the genetic
component of variance in
quantitative characters like
intelligence, but to date we
have not come close to solving the
genetic problems of determining
an individual's intellectual
endowment. Even more
importantly, we have not solved
the problems of cross-cultural I.Q.
testing.
"When we can do those things,
we will easily be able to ask the
question whether tall people are
genetically smarter than short
people, or whether black people
may be smarter than white
people. The results would be of
some very limited academic
interest to biologists and
sociologists. For instance,
environmental deprivation may
have created strong selection for
genetic intelligence in black
populations, so that the average
genetic I.Q. of Negroes might be a
few points higher than that of the
white population.
"It is clear from evidence on
other similar genetic characters
that no two samples of Homo
sapiens would be identical with

respect to genetic intelligence. A
sample of Swedes would differ
from a sample of Englishmen. A
sample of carpenters would differ
from a sample of plumbers. Tall
people would differ from short
people, and two different samples
of tall Anglo-Saxon Protestants
would differ from each other.
'Utter Nonsense'
"It is also clear that any social
action on genetic intelligence
would be taken on the basis of
that characteristic in an
individual, and not on the basis of
height, eye color, skin color,
tooth size, blood type, or the like.
For instance, once you know each
child's genetic intelligence, you
would use this, not skin color or
hair type, to judge his or her
educational potential. Thus the
claim that studies of genetic I.Q.
in a context of skin color are
biologically or sociologically
important is absolute and utter
nonsense. Clearly, the genetic
quality question is a red herring
and should be kept out of our
action program for the next
generation."
In our efforts to do something
about the population explosion, I
personally and Zero Population
Growth as an organization have
concentrated primarily on
attempting to change the
reproductive habits of middle
class and affluent whites—simply
because their consumption
patterns make them the essence of
the problem. I have given up
attempts to influence attitudes on
population control among the
poor peoples of the world, simply
because it is clear to me that
advice from the oppressor's camp
is simply not wanted or
needed—no matter how
well-meaning. Until the rich bring
their reproduction under control,
end racism, and redistribute
wealth and opportunity there will
be no solution to the crisis now
faced by mankind. I find plenty
to occupy my time in seeking
those goals.
Responsibility
Finally, my wife and I have
one child, and will have no more.
Wc are not trying to outbreed
anyone. As I have said before,
there is no question that some
white people would like to reduce
the size of the black population
through birth control. It is also
true that some whites think that
all of the world's problems could
be solved simply by reducing the
numbers of people of color. They
are just as wrong as those who say
there is no population problem,
that all the world's problems are
due to American imperialism, or
that all blacks are shiftless or all
whites are racists.
I will fight racism in myself
and in others, but I will not
accept responsibility for those

who twist my views, quote me out
of context, or invent opinions
that I do not hold. The alternative
is to keep my views to myself and
abdicate all responsibility for
finding a way out of what, in my
opinion, is the most serious
situation humanity has ever faced.
