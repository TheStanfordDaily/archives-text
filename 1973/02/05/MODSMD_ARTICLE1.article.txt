# Ceasefire Violations Decline; POW Release Talks Continue
## 
### 
SAIGON (AP) — Rapid progress was
reported yesterday in executing the
provisions of the Vietnam peace
agreement and the South Vietnamese
said cease-fire violations dropped off
even further.
Field teams of the International
Commission for Control and
Supervision fanned out across South
Vietnam to supervise a cease-fire after
a week's delay. The number of truce
violations reported by the Saigon
command during the 24-hour period
ending at 6 a.m. today dropped to
below 100 for the first time.
Eighty-nine incidents were reported.
The head of the control
commission said the first prisoner
releases could be expected about
midweek.
In other developments, two more
U.S. Cl3O transports flew to Hanoi
this morning to pick up additional
North Vietnamese support personnel
and return them to Tan Son Nhut Air
Base, headquarters of the four-party
Joint Military Commission.
Mine Clearance
One of the Cl3os carried Rear
Adm. Brian McCauley, commander of
the Navy task force which will
conduct mine clearing operations in
North Vietnamese ports, and 15
members of his staff, U.S. spokesmen
said.
The Pacific Military Command in
Honolulu said the first U.S.-North
Vietnamese meeting on mine clearance
operations would be held today in
Haiphong. McCauley's Task Force 78,
expected to number 20 to 25 ships,

has been gathering in the Gulf of
Tonkin.
Seven prisoner recovery teams were
standing by at Tan Son Nhut, ready to
move anywhere in Indochina for the
repatriation of POWs, including 562
American servicemen and 23 U.S.
civilians held in North and South
Vietnam and Laos.
Representatives of the United
States, North and South Vietnam and
the Viet Cong scheduled their third
meeting in as many days for this
afternoon to work out details of the
prisoner exchanges.
Yesterday, Cl3os flew more than
220 North Vietnam support personnel
and their equipment from Hanoi to
Saigon to participate in the work of
the Joint Military Commission.
Summing up these developments,
one U.S. official said, "It's
encouraging. Hopefully, things will
keep going rapidly."
Violations Decline
Fighting across South Vietnam
continued to ebb. The Saigon military
command claimed 102 cease-fire
violations during the 24-hour period
ending at 6 a.m. yesterday, the lowest
number reported since the truce
officially began Jan. 28.
Reporting on prisoner exchanges,
Ambassador Michel Gauvin of Canada,
acting chairman of the control
commission, told newsmen: "I believe
arrangements are being made for the
release of prisoners of war within the
next week, probably by the middle of
the week."
He described the one-hour meeting

between his commission and the Joint
Military Commission as "one of the
most constructive steps that have been
taken this week."
The Saigon military command
claimed that 299 North Vietnamese
and Viet Cong troops were killed in
fighting during the 24-hour period
ending at dawn yesterday. The
command said 33 South Vietnamese
troops were killed, 142 wounded and
201 missing.
Lt. Col. Le Trung Hien, chief
spokesman for the command, claimed
that the Communists had violated the
cease-fire 1,585 times since it officially
went into effect. He said total
casualties were 3,705 North
Vietnamese and Viet Cong troops
killed and 590 South Vietnamese
troops killed, 2,382 wounded and 292
missing.
