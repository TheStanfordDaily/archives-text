Audacity And Elitism
Editor:
Did your judgment and good
taste leave with your dependency?
Your audacity to print such trash
as Chris Ho(n)cker's article
"Ripping Off the People" leaves a
lot to be desired. If you are short
of copy, you could print "Once
Around The Quad" in 18-point
Bodoni Bold or something.
These derogatory remarks,
with the obvious racial and ethnic
overtones, appear to be better
suited for a freshman theme at
Oral Roberts University than an
article in the Daily.
Contrary to the elitist
apathetical beliefs here, the issues
which Mr. Ho(n)cker mocks are
very important to many people,
especially when it's literally a
matter of life or death. This poke
at humor isn't cute but rather
quite disgusting. Many others
don't have the luxurious confines
of Stanford to call home where
aside from all the put-on
liberalism, Daddy can always be
called on when times get rough
(over-spent the monthly bucks, or
misplaced his credit card).
Back in 1966, if you are old
enough to remember that far
back, similar attitudes existed in
respect to the grape boycott. And
in 1970, you will remember, the
growers realized that even the
boys in Vietnam couldn't eat
grapes all the time, and signed
union contracts. Cesar and the
laborers didn't do it alone. There
are countless other examples that
can be cited, so if you get a
chance, Mr. Ho(n)cker, take your

nose out of the clouds for a
moment and investigate for a
change.
Personally, Mr. Ho(n)cker, I
hope obesity sets in, it would go
well with your bad taste in
clothes. I do know.

Course Review Wants You
Editor:
Last fall, the ASSU began a
major effort to create a
comprehensive course review.
Volunteers collected information
from over 70 courses in the social
sciences, hard sciences, humanities
and engineering.
The most pressing current need
of the course review is thÂ£
selection of an able editor, and
applications are now available for
the position at the ASSU office.
In addition to needing a
competent editor, the Course
Review needs volunteers to serve
as department coordinators.
Coordinators are responsible for
seeing that questionnaires are
completed in the major lecture
courses offered within their
department during the winter
quarter. They will also be
expected to lend a hand in writing
the essays of the courses that will
appear in the completed course
review.
In order to have a successful
course review, we must attract a
competent staff. I hope interested
students will seriously consider
joining our effort.
