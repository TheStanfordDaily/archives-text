### MARCIA FRIEDMAN 
Does the Bookstore buy back used text books and sell them again?
W.R.
Students may sell used textbooks back to the Bookstore at
Customer Service any time a requisition is made for that book for the
ensuing quarter. According to Bookstore manager Eldon Speed,
requisitions for Spring quarter are expected in another week. Books
are bought back at 50 percent of the retail cost, if it is above $2, and
resold at 75 percent.
Although the Bookstore does not speculate in non-ordered books,
it buys books for two used-book jobbers for 20 to 25 percent of retail
price of books listed in their catalogues.
Is there a Friends (Quaker) Meeting house or Quaker group on
campus or in the Palo Alto area? If so, what is the address, and when
does the group meet? J. W.
A group meets the first Sunday of every month at campus Friends
adviser Alan Strain's house. The address is 369 Wayside Road in
Portola Valley. There is also a Friends Meeting House at 957 Colorado
in Palo Alto. Meetings are held every Sunday at 11 a.m. For more
information contact Alan Strain, ext. 2137.
Is it true that sororities at Stanford were discontinued because two
girls jumped from Hoover tower when they did not get into the house
of their choice? L.N.
According to Fred Glover, Secretary to the University, there is no
connection between the two suicides from Hoover Tower and the
sorority system at Stanford. Sororities were officially abolished from
campus by the Board of Trustees on April 26, 1944, after 13 Roble
sponsors (six were sorority members) declared the system
"undemocratic and unnecessary" in a proposal to eliminate them.
Another factor involved in the decision was the limited number of
living spaces sororities provided for an increasing women's enrollment.
Until 1933, Stanford set a limit of 500 entering women. Ten years
later, with the women quota dropped, enrollment had doubled with
no increase in housing capacity. There were nine sorority houses at
the time with 270 spaces and demand greatly exceeded the supply.
The two suicides occurred within the past ten years. One was a
man from Menlo Park and another was a male Stanford student.
What is Galvez House (next to Frost Amphitheater and across from
Encina Gym)? Who, if anyone, lives there? C.R.
Galvez House is a residence for male Food Service employees. 25
workers from Tresidder and the hospital occupy the single rooms in
the house. Other employees occupy single rooms in Lagunita, Wilbur
and Stern halls.

According to Fred Glover, Secretary to the University, there is no
connection between the two suicides from Hoover Tower and the
sorority system at Stanford. Sororities were officially abolished from
campus by the Board of Trustees on April 26, 1944, after 13 Roble
sponsors (six were sorority members) declared the system
"undemocratic and unnecessary" in a proposal to eliminate them.
Another factor involved in the decision was the limited number of
living spaces sororities provided for an increasing women's enrollment.
Until 1933, Stanford set a limit of 500 entering women. Ten years
later, with the women quota dropped, enrollment had doubled with
no increase in housing capacity. There were nine sorority houses at
the time with 270 spaces and demand greatly exceeded the supply.
The two suicides occurred within the past ten years. One was a
man from Menlo Park and another was a male Stanford student.

Does the Bookstore buy back used text books and sell them again?
W.R.
Students may sell used textbooks back to the Bookstore at
Customer Service any time a requisition is made for that book for the
ensuing quarter. According to Bookstore manager Eldon Speed,
requisitions for Spring quarter are expected in another week. Books
are bought back at 50 percent of the retail cost, if it is above $2, and
resold at 75 percent.
Although the Bookstore does not speculate in non-ordered books,
it buys books for two used-book jobbers for 20 to 25 percent of retail
price of books listed in their catalogues.

Is it true that sororities at Stanford were discontinued because two
girls jumped from Hoover tower when they did not get into the house
