Because of space limitations the Dailv will only print
announcements of events which give free admission.
Announcements may be placed in an envelope outside the Daily
office. OATQ is a public service to our readers. The Daily will
publish as many announcements as space allows. Complaints
should be made to the Managing Editor.
