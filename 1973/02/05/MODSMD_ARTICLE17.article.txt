### MIKE CHASSON 
Stanford's Dean Anderson outswam UCLA's Tim
McDonnell on the last leg of the 400 freestyle relay to help
the Cardinals slip by the Bruins 60-53 at the Stanford pools
Saturday.
On a day marked by intermittent rain, the Cards started
the meet the way they ended it, by winning a relay.
Anderson and Olympian John Hencken paced Stanford with
two individual wins apiece.
Hencken proved the difference in the 400 medley relay as
Stanford won in 3.30.8 with UCLA recording the same time
but getting second on a judges' decision.Henckensplit a 56.5
on the breaststroke to give the Cards breathing room on the
butterfly leg.
Tough Race
The 1000 free provided a contrast in strategy as UCLA's
Rex Favero went out hard and built a 15-yard lead of
Stafford's Terry Sutton. Sutton, swimming a well-paced

race, came storming back at the 750 yard mark and caught
Favero with two laps to go.
Favero then outsprinted Sutton to win in 9.36.8 with
Sutton finishing in 9.38.1. McDonnell finished third in
9.55.1. Favero and Sutton's times currently rank three and
five respectively in the nation.
The Bruins swept the 200 free as Brad Anderson and Kurt
Krumpholz finished in 1.44.0 with Anderson getting the
judges' decision victory. Stanford's Richard Cook was third
in a season best of 1.45.8.
Stanford came right back and swept the 50 free with
Anderson notching the first of his two victories with a 21.8.
Cardinal Bruce Goodwin finished second in the same time
with Barry Townsend of UCLA third in 22.0
Hencken recorded his first win by taking the 200 IM,
pulling away on the breaststroke and free laps to finish in
1.57.6. Paul Benson of UCLA held off a fast closing Brian
Job to finish second in 2.00.3 to Job's 2.01.0.

The Cardiansl received a welcome surprise in the
one-meter diving as Rich Rector upset UCLA's Susie Kincade
to give Stanford valuable place points. Kincade, a fifth place
finisher at the Olympic Trials, is the first woman to compete
in the Pacific Eight.
Stanford had a comfortable 30-22 kead at this point, but
UCLA started a comeback with the 200 fly. Bruins Steve
Baxter and Rob Clark went one-two to close the gap, Baxter
winning in 1.56.2 and Clark second in 1.57.4. Paul Clark of
Stanford finished third in 1.59.0.
The Cardinals, hoping for a one-two finish in the 100 free,
had to settle for a one-three finish as Anderson notched his
second win with a 47.2, but UCLA's Brad Anderson touched
out Goodwin of Stanford as both were timed in 48.1.
UCLA closed within one point of Stanford following an
upset win in the 200 backstroke by Bruin Brian McKmley.
McKinley upset√üandyWhitchurch with a time of 1.57.5 to
second places' 1.58.3. Benson outtouched Stanford's Jack

Deppe for the third place points, 2.01.8 to 2.01.9.
Bruins Lead
The Bruins took the lead for the first time following a
one-two finish in the 500 free as Favero and McDonnell
recorded a 4.40.8 and 4.43.8 respectively.
The Cards hoped Sutton could get second, but the
Stanford junior let the Bruins' pair get too far ahead and had
to settle for third in a season best 4.45.9.
Stanford recovered the lead following the breaststroke as
Hencken and Job battled only each other to finish first and
second. Job led for the first 180 yards at which point
Hencken turned it on to defeat Job for the first time this
season. Hencken was timed in 2.06.5 to Job's 2.06.6 with
Bruce third in 2.09.9.
UCLA tied up the meet, 53-53, following a first place
finish by Kincade in the three-meter diving with Stanford
claiming second and third.
The Cards are now 3-2 on the season.
