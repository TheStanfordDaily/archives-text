# Netmen Ace Brains For Indoor Title
## 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
Stanford's tennis team won the
National Indoor tournament at
Madison, Wise, yesterday by
beating UCLA 6-3 in the final
round.
Previously, the Cardinals had
beaten North Carolina, 9-0,
Trinity (Tex.) 8-1, and USC, 6-3,
to reach the finals of the tourney,
which included virtually all of the
nation's top collegiate teams.
Coach Dick Gould said that the
highlight of the tournament was
the undefeated play of Sandy
Mayer (first singles), Jim Delaney
(second singles), John Whitlinger
(sixth singles), and Rick Fisher
and Gery Groslimond (first
doubles). Whitlinger and the
doubles team did not lose a set,
while Mayer and Delaney lost
only one set each in the four
rounds of play.
The championship was even
more conclusive because of the
fine records of all the teams
Stanford beat. North Carolina,
following its first-round defeat to
the Cards Friday afternoon, went
on to easily win the consolation
championship.
Conslusive Victory
Trinity, whose 36 consecutive
match win streak was snapped by
Stanford Friday night, went on to
win the prize for fifth place. In
the match against the Cards,
Trinity was able to win only one
individual match, that by default
at 2 a.m. when Gould saw no
point in keeping his players at the
court any longer.
USC, the team Stanford beat
Saturday in the semifinals, easily
beat SMU for third place.
Stanford scored a major upset in
the minds of many observers
when the Fisher-Grolimond
doubles team beat Paul Ramirez
and Mike Machette, 6-4, 6-3. The
highly-rated Ramirez recorded
victories over both Roscoe Tanner
and Mayer last year.
UCLA Results
In the final match against
UCLA, results were as follows:
At first singles, Mayer beat Jeff
Austin, 7-6, 3-6, 6-3. At second
singles, Delaney beat Bob Kreiss,
6-3, 1-6, 6-3. Rick Fisher beat
Steve Krulevitz, 6-4, 6-2 at third
singles.
Ray no Segars (UCLA) beat

Groslimond, 0-6, 6-3, 6-3 at
fourth singles, with Stanford also
losing at fifth singles, where Brian
Teacher defeated DuPre, 6-4, 5-7,
6-3. At sixth singles, Whitlinger
topped Steve Mott, 6-1, 4-6, 6-1.
Rick Fisher and Groslimond
beat Austin and Kriess, 6-4. 6-3,
at first doubles. Mayer and
Whitlinger beat Mott and Teacher
at second doubles, 6-4, 6-4, with
Krulevitz and Segars topping Chip
Fisher and Delaney, 6-3, 6-7, 6-0,
at third doubles.
