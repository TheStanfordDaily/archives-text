# Campus Judicial Panel Handles Fewer Student Discipline Cases

### JANET SANDERS 
The decreased political activity on campus this year is
reflected in the small number of cases referred to the
Campus Judicial Panel, the committee on student
discipline. According to CJP chairman Law Prof. William
Cohen, the CJP has handled only three cases this year, all
of which were nonpolitical in nature.
One of the cases, ultimately decided by the Dean of
Student Affairs last quarter, involved a violation of the
honor code. The other two concerned use of forged meal
cards.
"We have had no political cases this year, and certainly
no cases which have aroused student emotion like last
year," said CJP prosecutor Jerry Halligan. Cohen added
that the committee has had almost no business.
Last year, the CJP heard seven cases involving 23
individuals, including the celebrated case that led to the
suspension of radicals Alice Furumoto and Kwonping Ho,
and the expulsion of Don Lee. The three were charged
with disrupting one of Prof. William Shockley's electrical
engineering classes.
The CJP, instituted as an interim system last year by
University President Richard Lyman, aroused student
protest long before the Ho-Lee-Furumoto case. The
judicial panel, composed of three students and four
faculty members, was not approved by the Student
Senate, and the student body this fall voted against a

similar discipline committee with a faculty majority.
"In my opinion, the Faculty Senate was not affected
by the fact that the students voted against a faculty
majority," said Aerophysics Prof. Daniel Bershader, a
current CJP member. "The senate is not ready to give a
student majority on a panel which might decide political
problems," he added.
Cohen, who casts a vote only in the case of a tie,
pointed out that "I have never had to vote because we
have never had such a split." However, he opposed having
a student majority on the panel "because peer pressure
might force them to vote as a bloc if they had the
majority."
Cohen praised the efficiency of the present judicial
system, saying, "For the first time in years, we started out
the year with no old cases on the docket." The Stanford
Judicial Council, the CJP's predecessor, was always
behind, he noted.
The CJP will have to be replaced by a new system as
soon as the faculty and students come to an agreement.
But such an agreement is not in the near future, and
Bershader speculated that "the CJP will be around for
quite a while."
The Committee of 15, the committee formed to find a
viable replacement for the CJP, will have its first meeting
of the year this Thursday to discuss possible alternatives
to the present judicial system.
