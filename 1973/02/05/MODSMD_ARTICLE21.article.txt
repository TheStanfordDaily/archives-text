# Barry's Putt Decisive
## Golfers Edged By SJS 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
Just when it seemed that Stanford's golf team had breezed to
victory over four opponents Friday, San Jose State's Phil Barry
dropped a 12 foot putt on the 18th green for a three under par 68 and
a one stroke Spartan victory.
Nobody realized the significance of Barry's putt until several
minutes later when the scores were finally totaled. In fact San Jose
State coach Jerry Vroom didn't even know his team had won until
fifteen minutes after the conclusion of the match. But the Spartans
finished with a 285 total, one better than the host Cards.
Stanford's junior varsity finished third at 301, the Card frosh team
was fourth with 303, Santa Clara fifth at 325, Cal State Hay ward
sixth at 337, and San Francisco State seventh with 339.

Stanford coach Bud Finger was
bewildered when he added up the
scores. "I was pleased with our
scores," he said, "but we sure got
beat."
Finger was referring to scores
that would normally win any
collegiate event. Bruce Robertson
and Bob Chapman each shot 71,
Dave Baskins, Denny Colvin, and
Aly Trompas had 72's, and
Conrad Nilmeier shot 74.
Since only the low four scores
counted toward the team total,
Stanford finished with 286
strokes. If all six scores had
counted, the Cards would have
defeated San Jose by 10 shots.
Barry's 68 easily won
individual honors while
Robertson, Chapman, and San
Jose's Jim Knoll tied for second at
71. Trompas, Baskins, Colvin, and
Mark Lye of the Spartans were
next at 72.
Three members of Stanford's
junior varsity and freshman teams
also figured high in the individual
competition. George Pettingerand
Bob Steele each shot 73 and Mike
Mc√üride fired a 74.
