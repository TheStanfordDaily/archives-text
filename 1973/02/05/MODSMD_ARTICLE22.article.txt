# Kelley Scores 28
## Cards Handle Bears 
### STAN WILSON 
BERKELEY — With center Rich
Kelley scoring 22 of his game-high
28 points in the second half, the
Stanford Cardinals turned back a
California rally to defeat the Bears
73-68, Saturday afternoon.
The Cards' talented sophomore
pulled down 13 rebounds to lead
all performers in that category,
but the smaller Bears held a 49-39
rebounding edge over Stanford.
The Cards outshot Cal 47 percent
to 41 percent.
Cal's Rickie Hawthorne, who
has sparked the Bears in recent
games, was held to two field goals
in nine attempts, and a total of
four points. Hawthorne picked up
three fouls early in the game, and
saw limited action before the
intermission.
The 6-3 freshman guard
returned to the game in the
second half, but Stanford's
improving zone defense stymied
him. Hawthorne fired up several
unconvincing shots over the zone,
but his inaccuracy hurt the Bears
chances for a comeback.
Balanced Attack
Stanford relied upon a
balanced attack and a 52 percent
shooting effort in the first half,
but the Cards still trailed the
Bears 38-37 at the intermission.
Unheralded senior guard Eric
Long kept the Bears ahead as he
connected on four of five first
half shots. Long finished with
eight for 12 and 20 points.
The game was close
throughout, as the lead changed
hands 14 times and the game was
tied on eight occasions.
The Cards built up a nine-point
lead midway through the second
half, the game's widest margin,
but Stanford went cold, and the
quicker Bears fought back from a
55-46 deficit to a 62-58 lead with
6:42 remaining in the contest.
Kelley then took control of the
game, connecting on both ends on
a one-and-one, and dropping in a
turn-around jumper from the
baseline to tie the score at 62-62.
The seven-footer added a free
throw, and the Cards were on top,
63-62.
Cal's Sam Krupsky tipped in an
errant shot by Long, but buckets
by sophomore Scott Trobbe and
Kelley gave the Cards a
three-point lead with 3:14 to go.
A field goal by the Bears' John
Coughran gave Cal another chance

to win it, but the dependable
Kelley tossed in a twelve-footer
and hit a pair of clutch free
throws.

Tim Patterson added another
bucket for the Cards, and with
Stanford leading 71-68 with less
than a minute left in the game,
the Bears were forced to foul.
With five seconds left in the
contest Kelley canned two more
free throws to ice the game for
Stanford, 73-68.
"In the first half we didn't
have much patience, but in the
second half we just tried to get
the ball to Kelley," said Stanford
Coach Howie Dallmar.
Sophomore guard Mark Gilberg
was the most effective Cardinal at
getting the ball inside to the big
man. Gilberg was credited with
seven assists to go with his eight
points.
Stanford played almost the
entire game without the services
of forward Dave Frost, who
reinjured his back Thursday in
practice. The 6-6 junior
aggravated the injury during his
short stint against Cal, and will be
out for an indefinite period.
Stanford is now 2-3 in the
conference, and 9-7 on the season.
The Bears dropped to 1-4 in the
league, and 8-9 overall.

Stanford, 73-68.
"In the first half we didn't
have much patience, but in the
second half we just tried to get
the ball to Kelley," said Stanford
Coach Howie Dallmar.
Sophomore guard Mark Gilberg
was the most effective Cardinal at
getting the ball inside to the big
man. Gilberg was credited with
seven assists to go with his eight
points.
Stanford played almost the
entire game without the services
of forward Dave Frost, who
reinjured his back Thursday in
practice. The 6-6 junior
aggravated the injury during his
short stint against Cal, and will be
out for an indefinite period.
Stanford is now 2-3 in the
conference, and 9-7 on the season.
The Bears dropped to 1-4 in the
league, and 8-9 overall.
BERKELEY — With center Rich
Kelley scoring 22 of his game-high
28 points in the second half, the
Stanford Cardinals turned back a
California rally to defeat the Bears
73-68, Saturday afternoon.
The Cards' talented sophomore
pulled down 13 rebounds to lead
all performers in that category,
but the smaller Bears held a 49-39
rebounding edge over Stanford.
The Cards outshot Cal 47 percent
to 41 percent.
Cal's Rickie Hawthorne, who
has sparked the Bears in recent
games, was held to two field goals
in nine attempts, and a total of
four points. Hawthorne picked up
three fouls early in the game, and
saw limited action before the
intermission.
The 6-3 freshman guard
returned to the game in the
second half, but Stanford's
improving zone defense stymied
him. Hawthorne fired up several
unconvincing shots over the zone,
but his inaccuracy hurt the Bears
chances for a comeback.
Balanced Attack
Stanford relied upon a
balanced attack and a 52 percent
shooting effort in the first half,
but the Cards still trailed the
Bears 38-37 at the intermission.
Unheralded senior guard Eric
Long kept the Bears ahead as he
connected on four of five first
half shots. Long finished with
eight for 12 and 20 points.
The game was close
throughout, as the lead changed
hands 14 times and the game was
tied on eight occasions.
The Cards built up a nine-point
lead midway through the second
half, the game's widest margin,
but Stanford went cold, and the
quicker Bears fought back from a
55-46 deficit to a 62-58 lead with
6:42 remaining in the contest.
Kelley then took control of the
game, connecting on both ends on
a one-and-one, and dropping in a
turn-around jumper from the
baseline to tie the score at 62-62.
The seven-footer added a free
throw, and the Cards were on top,
63-62.
Cal's Sam Krupsky tipped in an
errant shot by Long, but buckets
by sophomore Scott Trobbe and
Kelley gave the Cards a
three-point lead with 3:14 to go.
A field goal by the Bears' John
Coughran gave Cal another chance

to win it, but the dependable
Kelley tossed in a twelve-footer
and hit a pair of clutch free
throws.

Tim Patterson added another
bucket for the Cards, and with
Stanford leading 71-68 with less
than a minute left in the game,
the Bears were forced to foul.
With five seconds left in the
contest Kelley canned two more
free throws to ice the game for
Stanford, 73-68.
