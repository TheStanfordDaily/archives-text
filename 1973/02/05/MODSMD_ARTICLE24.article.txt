# Cardinals Outpoint UCLA Gymnasts
## 
### PHIL HUBBARD 
A strong finish by UCLA and a
miscalculation by a scorekeeper
almost upset the Stanford
gymnastics team in their final
home meet of the season at
Maples Pavilion Friday night.
Stanford was leading 127.35 to
124.55 going into the last event,
the high bar, and it looked as if
the Cards had their third victory
of the season in the bag. The
Bruins finished with two superb
performances of 8.7 and 8.85, and
Stanford's Steve Hug caught his
foot on the bar and Ipst the
rythym of his routine/ finally
receiving a 5.25.
The Cards' scorekeeper,
automatically counting Hug's
score, came up with a final total
of 149.2 for Stanford and 149.5
for UCLA. The Bruin bench went
wild. A couple of minutes later,
the scorekeeper realized that
Denny Melendez had scored a 6.5
on his routine and should have
been scored in place of Hug. By
the time the correct score of
150.45 to 149.5 had been
announced, many of the
disappointed fans had already left.
The chaotic ending
unfortunately obscured the fact
that Bob Anderson had scored an
outstanding 51.55 in winning the
all-around for the second week in
a row. Anderson led off with an
excellent 9.15 in floor exercise,
followed by an 8.15 side horse
and 8.7 rings routine. In the
second half, he scored 8.05 on the
vault, 8.5 on the parallel bars, and
capped the night with a 9.0 high
bar routine.

Side hourse star Ted Marcy was
a little off the 9.55 pace he had
set in the last two contests.
Friday night Marcy could manage
only a moderately superb 9.5, still
almost a full point ahead of his
nearest competitor.
NCAA placer Howard Bessen
had the high mark of the night on
the rings, with a 9.0. Ted
Miyamoto's second place finish in
the all-around included 8.65 floor
exercise and 8.6 parallel bar
routines, with a 46.65 total for
the six events.
The top performer for the
Bruins was Steve Gerlach. Gerlach
led the field in the vault with an
8.75, and also managed an 8.9
floor exercise routine. UCLA's
Ken Eastman turned in a fine 8.85
score on the high bar.
Coach Hamada said UCLA had
surprised him. "We had expected
an easy meet. I guess this will
teach us not to get
overconfident."
Commenting on the mix-up in
the final score, Hamada explained,
"I coach the guys in the gym, but
I don't teach them how to count."

A strong finish by UCLA and a
miscalculation by a scorekeeper
almost upset the Stanford
gymnastics team in their final
home meet of the season at
Maples Pavilion Friday night.
Stanford was leading 127.35 to
124.55 going into the last event,
the high bar, and it looked as if
the Cards had their third victory
of the season in the bag. The
Bruins finished with two superb
performances of 8.7 and 8.85, and
Stanford's Steve Hug caught his
foot on the bar and Ipst the
rythym of his routine/ finally
receiving a 5.25.
The Cards' scorekeeper,
automatically counting Hug's
score, came up with a final total
of 149.2 for Stanford and 149.5
for UCLA. The Bruin bench went
wild. A couple of minutes later,
the scorekeeper realized that
Denny Melendez had scored a 6.5
on his routine and should have
been scored in place of Hug. By
the time the correct score of
150.45 to 149.5 had been
announced, many of the
disappointed fans had already left.
The chaotic ending
unfortunately obscured the fact
that Bob Anderson had scored an
outstanding 51.55 in winning the
all-around for the second week in
a row. Anderson led off with an
excellent 9.15 in floor exercise,
followed by an 8.15 side horse
and 8.7 rings routine. In the
second half, he scored 8.05 on the
vault, 8.5 on the parallel bars, and
capped the night with a 9.0 high
bar routine.

Side hourse star Ted Marcy was
a little off the 9.55 pace he had
set in the last two contests.
Friday night Marcy could manage
only a moderately superb 9.5, still
almost a full point ahead of his
nearest competitor.
NCAA placer Howard Bessen
had the high mark of the night on
the rings, with a 9.0. Ted
Miyamoto's second place finish in
the all-around included 8.65 floor
exercise and 8.6 parallel bar
routines, with a 46.65 total for
the six events.
The top performer for the
Bruins was Steve Gerlach. Gerlach
led the field in the vault with an
8.75, and also managed an 8.9
floor exercise routine. UCLA's
Ken Eastman turned in a fine 8.85
score on the high bar.
Coach Hamada said UCLA had
surprised him. "We had expected
an easy meet. I guess this will
teach us not to get
overconfident."
Commenting on the mix-up in
the final score, Hamada explained,
"I coach the guys in the gym, but
I don't teach them how to count."
