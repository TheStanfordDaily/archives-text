Congress Views Tax Reform
WASHINGTON — The Democratic-controlled
Congress today begins formal consideration of tax
reform, which the party's candidates used as a major
issue in the 1972 campaign.
The House Ways and Means Committee opens
hearings that are expected to last about eight weeks
and cover every aspect of the Internal Revenue
Code. The last major review was in 1969.
There was no advance outline of the kind of bill
the committee may eventually produce, but
Chairman Wilbur D. Mills (D-Ark.), has put a
damper on hopes for a general tax cut. He also
belittled some reformers' estimates that the
government could pick up large revenue increases by
closing what they call loopholes.
Tax changes made to treat taxpayers equitably,
Mills said, generally tend to balance each other out.
Mills indicated he would consider changes in
capital gains taxation. These could include
lengthening the period, now six months, for which
an asset must be held before profit from its sale
qualifies for the favorable capital gains treatment.
He is also interested in the possibility of a sliding
scale of taxation, so that the levy would decline on
assets held many years.
Heath Disparages U.S. Pullout
WASHINGTON — Prime Minister Edward Heath of
Great Britain said yesterday thatunilateral U.S.
troop withdrawal from Europe might push some of
America's Western European allies into making deals
with the Soviet Bloc.
Britain wouldn't, he said on the NBC broadcast
"Meet the Press," "but others might." He refused to
name any countries.
In an interview taped before his final meeting
with President Nixon last week, Heath said if the
United States were to withdraw all but a token
force from Europe "the general conclusion would
be that America was becoming isolationist,
withdrawing into herself, and no longer interested in
world affairs."
The Soviet Union and China would draw that
conclusion "very rapidly," the prime minister said.
Asked if the Communist powers still represent a
threat to Western Europe, Heath said, "I have
absolutely no doubt about that at all."
Nine More Die In Ulster
BELFAST — British troops claimed they killed six
gunmen in a pitched battle in Belfast on yesterday
while rival terrorist armies mowed down nearly a
score of civilians in the streets.
Two men, both believed to be Protestants, were
shot dead by sectarian assassins and at least 15 other
persons were wounded Saturday night and early
yesterday in one of the bloodiest nights in northern
Ireland since sectarian feuding exploded over three
years ago.
They were hit as Protestant and Roman Catholic
extremists crisscrossed the city in autos, roaring into
each others' territory to spray the sidewalks with
bullets in a savage vendetta that seemed completely
indiscriminate.
"There doesn't appear to be any reason behind
the shooting beyond a fanatical lust to kill," an
army patrol commander reported after the night of
horror. "The gunmen have simply opened up on
anyone and everyone. It's madness."

The weekend fatality toll rose to nine when
children playing along an abandoned railroad track
in Protestant-dominated East Belfast found the
mutilated body of a naked man spreadeagled in a
shallow stream yesterday.
Police reported the unidentified man, aged about
25, had been repeatedly stabbed around the heart,
shot in the head and had been beaten and tortured.
A noose fashioned from a strip of blanket was
knotted around his neck.
The slayings raised Northern Ireland's death toll
in SV2 years of violence to 710. At least 19 persons
have died in the past week.
'76 Games Set For Innsbruck
LAUSANNE, Switzerland — Olympic officials gave
the 1976 Winter Games to Innsbruck yesterday and
hoped that Austrians have forgotten the bitter affair
of Karl Schranz.
The executive body of the International Olympic
Committee chose the Austrian city over three other
applicants — Chamonix, France; Lake Placid, N.Y.,
and Tampere, Finland.
The name of Schranz — the Austrian skier barred
from the 1972 Olympics at Sapporo because of
professionalism, figured in the four-hour parley at
the Palais de Beaulieu in Lausanne.
Lord Killanin, lOC president, asked the
Innsbruck delegation whether the Schranz affair still
rankled the Austrian people.
Innsbruck Mayor Alois Lugger, who led the
delegation, said: "I assured the executive body that
the expulsion of Schranz was all forgotten."
Yesterday decision ended the crisis caused by the
withdrawal of Denver, which gave up the Games
after a Colorado voters last November refused use of
state funds to help stage them.
The United States still hoped for the Games and
proposed Salt Lake City, Utah. But last week, as the
lOC executive body was preparing to interview the
candidates, Salt Lake pulled out because of financial
doubts.
U.S. Energy Crisis Ignored?
WASHINGTON — The United States is moving too
slowly in its efforts to cope with a developing
energy crisis, the outgoing chairman of the
congressional Joint Committee on Defense
Production said yesterday.
Rep. Wright Patman (D-Tex.), expressed this
conclusion in a statement accompanying the
committee's 1972 report, made public yesterday.
The committee reported that 49 of 56 civilian
nuclear power plants under construction have
slipped behind schedule an average of 14.3 months
each.
The Atomic Energy Commission, it said, believes
that development of a new Liquid Metal Fast
Breeder Reactor is essential to meeting energy needs
— but the goal for commercial demonstration of the
reactor is 1980.
The reactor is expected to use at least 60 percent
of the energy from uranium burned, compared with
the 2 percent efficiency of existing reactors.
Reactors of the present type, it was estimated,
would exhaust the low-cost uranium in the United
States in 25 to 50 years.
As for conventional fuels, the report said;
— Department of Commerce studies resulted in
virtually no forecasts that conventional domestic oil
and gas supplies will yield the additional energy

needed from now to 1985.
— The United States will, according to estimates,
be depending on foreign sources for one-third to
one-half of its oil requirements by 1985.
- The very large tankers now becoming standard
for oil shipment cannot be handled by existing port
facilities. The Maritime Administration recommends
constructing offshore deep-water terminals.
Patman issued the report as chairman of the
Joint committee in 1972. Under the practice of
rotating chairmanships, Sen. John Sparkman
(D-Ala.), is the new chairman.
Police Probe Piedmont Slayings
RICHMOND, Calif. — Where and why a wealthy
Piedmont matron and her son were murdered with
gunshots in the head remained a mystery yesterday,
Richmond police investigators said.
Detectives said they were continuing to question
friends and relatives of Ellen Harrison, 67, and her
son by a prior marriage, Warren Merrill, 44, to find a
motive in their slayings.
The two were found bound and gagged with
neckties, both shot in the head with a .38 caliber
weapon, Thursday night in Mrs. Harrison's Cadillac,
parked near the Richmond Golf and Country Club.
Mrs. Harrison's husband Hugh Harrison, 69, the
inventor of "NoDoz" pills, meanwhile was freed on
$25,000 bail in Oakland where he had been jailed
on charges of swindling an Oakland widow of
$65,000 in cash and securities.
Detective Dave Rodden said Harrison was in jail
at the time of the killings sometime last Thursday
evening.
Police at first suspected Mrs. Harrison and her
son may have walked in and surprised burglars at
the Harrison home in the exclusive Oakland hills
suburb of Piedmont. A housekeeper had telephoned
police that evening to report when she came home
from errands she found the house in disarray and
the door open, Rodden said.
Coalition Names Candidates
BERKELEY — The April Coalition, which swept
three radicals onto the City Council in 1971,
nominated a sexually and ethnically balanced
four-candidate slate yesterday to fill moderate and
conservative seats at stake in the April 17 city
election.
Two women candidates were Ying Kelley, 41, an
elementary school teacher and Margot Dashiell, 30,
a black sociology instructor at Laney College in
Oakland. Peter Birdsall, 22, and Lenny Goldberg,
27, both University of California graduate students,
also were nominated.
The Coalition platform called for the elimination
of the council-manager form of government here,
the municipal takeover of public utilities and a
proposal to "demilitarize" the Berkeley police
department.
Today's Weather
