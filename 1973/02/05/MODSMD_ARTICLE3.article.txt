# Engineering School Seeks To Enroll More Women

"A woman in engineering? Why
not?" The School of Engineering's
new booklet, "Consider the
Possibility" is part of a publicity
campaign designed to persuade high
school seniors and Stanford
"freshwomen" with mathematical
aptitude to consider an engineering
career.
The booklet admits that less than
one percent of the nation's engineers
are women, but claims "the field is
rapidly opening for the adventurous
young woman. More women engineers
are being graduated every year."
However, less than five percent of
Stanford's engineering students last

year were women. The school counted
46 women among 637 undergraduates
and 43 women among 1317 graduate
students. This year two women, Lily
Young, assistant professor of civil
engineering, and Patricia Jacobs,
assistant professor of operations
research, have joined the engineering
faculty.
By publicly setting out the
welcome mat for women, the school
hopes to improve its lopsided ratio.
"Engineering is a totally
male-dominated profession," Dean of
Engineering William Kays admits.
Recruitment of women was
"something I was interested in when I
first came into the dean's office last

summer," he says. A delegation from a
new campus group, WISE (Women in
Science and Engineering) encouraged
the new dean to act on that interest.
Recruiting Program
Asst. Dean A 1 Kirkiand now heads
the recruitment program, which began
in September with the sending of
letters to all freshman girls who scored
above 640 on the Math II
Achievement Test. About 40 showed
up at an orientation picnic, but it is
still too soon for administrators to
evaluate the success of the publicity
effort.
Last month the school put out
"Consider The Possibility," which
claims, "now is the perfect time for
women to break some new ground."
High school guidance counselors
around the country have expressed
interest in the booklet, and as the next
step, the school is preparing a mailing
to 12,000 high schools.
Women in engineering here seem to
agree that the climate is cordial.
"They're generally very friendly,"
Irene Pardee, a junior in civil
engineering, reports. "Sometimes in a
lab situation you have to show you're
capable before they let you do
something. But once they know you're
capable it's okay."
'Climate' Improving
Pam Cosby, a sophomore in civil
engineering, believes that, "A lot of
girls feel like it's still got the stigma of
being a male world." But that's not
true, Cosby asserts. "Once you've
showed people you can do the work
it's no problem."
Young has experienced "no overt
hostility" in the months she has been
here. "I think people are very open to
the idea that women will be coming
in." And, she adds, "In general, the
climate is getting better in industry."
"Consider the Possibility" states,
