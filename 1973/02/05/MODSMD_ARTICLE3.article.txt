# Engineering School Seeks To Enroll More Women

### JOANNE JACOBS 
"A woman in engineering? Why
not?" The School of Engineering's
new booklet, "Consider the
Possibility" is part of a publicity
campaign designed to persuade high
school seniors and Stanford
"freshwomen" with mathematical
aptitude to consider an engineering
career.
The booklet admits that less than
one percent of the nation's engineers
are women, but claims "the field is
rapidly opening for the adventurous
young woman. More women engineers
are being graduated every year."
However, less than five percent of
Stanford's engineering students last

year were women. The school counted
46 women among 637 undergraduates
and 43 women among 1317 graduate
students. This year two women, Lily
Young, assistant professor of civil
engineering, and Patricia Jacobs,
assistant professor of operations
research, have joined the engineering
faculty.
By publicly setting out the
welcome mat for women, the school
hopes to improve its lopsided ratio.
"Engineering is a totally
male-dominated profession," Dean of
Engineering William Kays admits.
Recruitment of women was
"something I was interested in when I
first came into the dean's office last

summer," he says. A delegation from a
new campus group, WISE (Women in
Science and Engineering) encouraged
the new dean to act on that interest.
Recruiting Program
Asst. Dean A 1 Kirkiand now heads
the recruitment program, which began
in September with the sending of
letters to all freshman girls who scored
above 640 on the Math II
Achievement Test. About 40 showed
up at an orientation picnic, but it is
still too soon for administrators to
evaluate the success of the publicity
effort.
Last month the school put out
"Consider The Possibility," which
claims, "now is the perfect time for
women to break some new ground."
High school guidance counselors
around the country have expressed
interest in the booklet, and as the next
step, the school is preparing a mailing
to 12,000 high schools.
Women in engineering here seem to
agree that the climate is cordial.
"They're generally very friendly,"
Irene Pardee, a junior in civil
engineering, reports. "Sometimes in a
lab situation you have to show you're
capable before they let you do
something. But once they know you're
capable it's okay."
'Climate' Improving
Pam Cosby, a sophomore in civil
engineering, believes that, "A lot of
girls feel like it's still got the stigma of
being a male world." But that's not
true, Cosby asserts. "Once you've
showed people you can do the work
it's no problem."
Young has experienced "no overt
hostility" in the months she has been
here. "I think people are very open to
the idea that women will be coming
in." And, she adds, "In general, the
climate is getting better in industry."
"Consider the Possibility" states,
"The notion that there is a surplus of
engineering graduates in the job
market is a well-publicized myth."
"I think I'll be a capable engineer,
so there won't be any problem,"
Cosby says. "But I'd rather get the job
on equal grounds."
"I might be offered a slightly lower
salary, but the gap is smaller than in
other fields," Pardee notes. She
predicts that a company which refuses
to hire women will face two problems.
"They'll be getting the civil rights
commission breathing down their
necks, and they'll be losing valuable
engineers."
According to the booklet, "Far
more women have an aptitude for
engineering than are actually going
into the field. Studies indicate that if
all the women who had the aptitude
went into engineering, there would be
close to 500,000 women engineers, as
opposed to the current 7,000.
"Mechanical aptitude is far less
important in a modern engineer than
mathematical ability, a flair for
problem solving, and a taste for hard
work. Physical stamina, however, is
rarely required."

The booklet quotes one woman
engineering student as saying, "There's
nothing inherently feminine about
mixing a given batch of materials,
exposing it to a definite temperature
for a definite time, and producing a
cake. There's nothing inherently
masculine about mixing a batch of
materials, exposing it to a definite
temperature for a given time, and
producing iron castings. I've done
both, and find them satisfying
occupations."
Junior Anita Ewing calls engineers
"realistic, perceptive, practical." She
explains, "I wanted to be in a field
that was analytical and practical,
rather than math or physics."
Other women became involved in
engineering through an interest in
architecture, urban planning,
environmental issues, or a general
desire to do something "useful" and
"challenging."
"A woman who decides to go into
engineering is a person with drive,
determination, and staying power,"
the engineering booklet states. And it
asks, "How many women do you
know who have majored in English or
history and are now pounding a
typewriter?"
