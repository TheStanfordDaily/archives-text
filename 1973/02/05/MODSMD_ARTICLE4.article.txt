# Motion Lacks Successful Precedent
## Judge Denies Mistrial In Ellsberg Case 
### ED KOHN 
The judge in the "Pentagon Papers"
trial in Los Angeles Friday denied
defense motions for dismissal or a
mistrial in the increasingly complex
case.
Defendants Daniel Ellsberg and
Anthony J. Russo Jr. asked U.S.
District Court Judge Matt Byrne Jr. to
dismiss the conspiracy, espionage and
theft charges against them on the

grounds that the government illegally
suppressed evidence that could be used
to prove their innocence.
Russo, acting alone, asked for a
mistrial on the same grounds.
In asking for the dismissal of the
charges, defense attorneys argued that
prosecutor David Nissen was guilty of
acting in "complete, utter bad faith"
in the prosecution of Ellsberg and
Russo.
Charges Defiance
Leonard Boudin, Ellsberg's chief
defense lawyer, characterized Nissen's
behavior as "deliberate, contumacious,
dishonest defiance of a court order."
Nisson did not respond to most of
the defense charges, and submitted the
matter "on the record." He
commented that he knew of no
authority for what the defense was
demanding.
Shaking his head, Byme
commented, "The record is not very
favorable."
However, Byrne agreed with
Nissen that precedent does not allow
or justify dismissal of the 15-count
indictment or granting a mistrial and
ruled agafhst Ellsberg and Russo.
Dismissal Grounds
In their arguments before Byrne,
the defense lawyers argued that the
charges should be dismissed on a
variety of grounds, including:
— the government's failure to make
a "timely disclosure" of the
exculpatory material;
— that the government failed to
present the analyses to the grand jury
that indicted Ellsberg and Russo; and
— that the defense is entitled to the
exculpatory material before itmakesits
opening statements to the jury.
Exculpatory Material
On April 11 and on June 23,1972,

Byrne ordered the government to turn
over to him all analyses of the
"Papers" as well as all other
documents and correspondence related
to material that could be considered
"exculpatory" — that is, that could be
used to exonerate the defendants.
One week ago, after ordering
several high-ranking Defense and
Justice Department officials to testify,
Byrne began receiving the Defense and
State Department analyses — a total of
37 in all — that contained exculpatory
material dealing with 18 of the 20
volumes Ellsberg and Russo are
charged with compromising.
After studying the analyses, Byrne
ordered that most be turned over to
the defense in accordance with a 1963
Supreme Court decision, Brady us
Maryland.
Government witnesses have
testified that the release of the papers
damaged the national defense and
could have helped Hanoi during the

highly-successful spring, 1972
offensive.
Government's Analysis
However, the government's own
analysts concluded in late 1971 and
early 1972 that the release of the
material did not damage the national
defense.
The trial will resume at 9:15 a.m.
today. A government analyst, William
Gerhart, the author of nine of the
Pentagon's studies of the "Papers"
containing exculpatory material, will
undergo what Byrne termed a "limited
inquiry."
Byrne expects to call in jurors into
the courtroom at 10:30 a.m. to
resume testimony in the case. At that
time, the defense is expected to begin
their cross-examination of Brig. Gen.
Paul F. Gorman, whose direct
examination ended ten days ago. All
of last week was spent resolving the
exculpatory material questions, and
the jurors were excused for the entire
week.
