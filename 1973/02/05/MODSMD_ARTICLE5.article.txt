# Higher Costs, Lower Subsidies Fuel Tuition Boosts
## 
### NANCI COLVERT 
Increasing educational costs and decreasing
willingness on the part of taxpayers and
government to subsidize universities, both
private and public, may be causing a
dangerous trend toward high tuitions which
many members of the middle class cannot
afford.
Undergraduate enrollment at the 49
member campuses of the Association of
Independent California Colleges and
Universities dropped 1.7 percent last fall, the
first time it has shown a decrease in 20 years.
The recently released report on
Independent Higher Education in California
by the College Entrance Examination Board
(CEEB) in Palo Alto expressed the fear that
private schools are pricing themselves out of
the market, because tuition has been raised
too high and too fast.
On one hand, the cost of providing a
constant level of quality in universities is
rising and must somehow be passed on to the
student. At Stanford, the total cost to the
student for an education has risen 125.5
percent since 1960 — 37.1 percent of it since
1969.
Still, tuition receipts make up only half the
University's budget.
Comparable Increases
Compared to a nine percent tuition
increase from 1971 to 1972 at Stanford,
comparable schools (all of which have higher

tuitions) experienced the following hikes:
Yale, 10 percent; Princeton, nine percent; and
Harvard and Cornell, seven percent.
Provost William Miller has often denied
that Stanford is "squeezing out the middle
class."
At present, it's estimated that only 26
percent of those freshmen who decline
admission here choose public schools with
lower tuition rates.
But total freshman applications were down
6.7 percent for 1970-71 and were down
another 5.4 percent in 71-72. Because of
rising costs, students may not even be
applying.
Financial Aid Increa*«
In order to continue its policy of admitting
and enrolling the students with the most
potential and promise, regardless of economic
standing, the amount of undergraduate
financial aid would have to be increased by
$385,000.
Lyman Glenny, director of the University
of California at Berkeley's Center for
Research and Development in Higher
Education, told a meeting of the American
Association of Colleges last month that
independent universities may be eventually
forced to price themselves out of the market
to the point that they require federal aid and
lose their autonomy.
According to the CEEB report, the average
tuition per year at California's private

institutions is now $1,146 more than at UC,
$1,597 more than the state universities and
colleges, and $1,776 more than the
community colleges. The tuition gap is
expected to be $2,000 by the fall of 1973.
UC Costs Increase
But the problem is equally complex at the
state level, where the traditional policy of
little or no tuition at its institutions "was
breached two years ago," according to Lyle
Gainsley, University of California director of
admissions.
At that time, an educational fee of $100
was added to the registration fee of $100, in
effect doubling the "tuition" at the nine UC
campuses.
The move was resisted by the University
administration but imposed by the UC
regents, led by Gov. Ronald Reagan, who felt
that students and parents should bear a
greater part of the burden of their education.
As a result, although freshmen enrollment
figures at UC continue to match previous
predictions, the number of continuing upper
classmen has dropped.
"We hear from the community colleges
(the locally-funded two-year institutions]
that more and more applicants who were
formerly UC material are turning up there,"
Gainsley said.
"Although we don't have any figures or
formal studies to prove it, we know intuitively
that this shift is occurring.

"The methodology we use for determining
a student's financial need conforms to the
Collegiate Scholastic Service guidelines, as
does Stanford's. The problem is that the
middle classes are being strained by the
increases, but not badly enough to qualify for
financial aid under this system.
Hesitant Taxpayers
"The money to make up for this in
individual cases has to come from somewhere.
The state and the taxpayers are proving
increasingly hesitant to respond to this need.
"To make matters worse, President Nixon's
proposed budget cuts back on federal funding
in support of higher education. This will
intensify the problem," Gainsley stated.
Dr. David Kagan, dean of Student Affairs
of the California State Universities and
Colleges, stated that the California taxpayer
has been pushed to the limit of support for
public education, and that new ways of
financing must be found.
Full-Cost Pricing
A recent report to the state legislature
suggested instituting full-cost pricing at all of
the college-level state institutions. This would
raise the cost of attending UC from $638 to
$2041, and the cost of a state university or
college from between $117 and $168 to
$2047.
It would also require the initiation of a
$140 tuition rate at the currently tuition-free
community colleges.

One of the alternatives available to keep
from squeezing the lower and middle classes
out of the college and university market is to
increase the amount of individual financial aid
offered.
Harlan Stamm, dean of Academic Programs
and Student Affairs for the community
colleges, stated, "Imposition of tuition would
cut our enrollment by two-thirds. It would
fail to save the state any money because it
would simply increase the size of the
disadvantaged group who would require
individual aid.
Playing 'Robin Hood'
"It's a vicious game of 'Robin Hood' —
robbing the rich to give to the poor. If we
force students out of the community colleges,
they'll wind up in vocational schools or on the
streets, unskilled, and we'll eventually end up
paying for them anyway through welfare and
other aid programs.
"Then everyone will start screaming to
educate our youth and it will start all over
again."
Enrollment at community colleges has
already declined slightly. Stamm attributes
this to several factors — the end of the draft, a
better job market for those with only a high
school education, and the move to vocational
schools which offer shorter term, intensive
skill training which is more salable in the job
market than a liberal arts education.
Increasing educational costs and decreasing
willingness on the part of taxpayers and
government to subsidize universities, both
private and public, may be causing a
dangerous trend toward high tuitions which
many members of the middle class cannot
afford.

Independent Higher Education in California
by the College Entrance Examination Board
(CEEB) in Palo Alto expressed the fear that
private schools are pricing themselves out of
the market, because tuition has been raised
too high and too fast.
On one hand, the cost of providing a
constant level of quality in universities is
rising and must somehow be passed on to the
student. At Stanford, the total cost to the
student for an education has risen 125.5
percent since 1960 — 37.1 percent of it since
1969.
Still, tuition receipts make up only half the
University's budget.
Comparable Increases
Compared to a nine percent tuition
increase from 1971 to 1972 at Stanford,
comparable schools (all of which have higher

tuitions) experienced the following hikes:
Yale, 10 percent; Princeton, nine percent; and
Harvard and Cornell, seven percent.
Provost William Miller has often denied
that Stanford is "squeezing out the middle
class."
At present, it's estimated that only 26
percent of those freshmen who decline
admission here choose public schools with
lower tuition rates.
But total freshman applications were down
6.7 percent for 1970-71 and were down
another 5.4 percent in 71-72. Because of
rising costs, students may not even be
applying.
Financial Aid Increa*«
In order to continue its policy of admitting
and enrolling the students with the most
potential and promise, regardless of economic
standing, the amount of undergraduate
financial aid would have to be increased by
$385,000.
Lyman Glenny, director of the University
of California at Berkeley's Center for
Research and Development in Higher
Education, told a meeting of the American
Association of Colleges last month that
independent universities may be eventually
forced to price themselves out of the market
to the point that they require federal aid and
lose their autonomy.
According to the CEEB report, the average
tuition per year at California's private

institutions is now $1,146 more than at UC,
$1,597 more than the state universities and
colleges, and $1,776 more than the
community colleges. The tuition gap is
expected to be $2,000 by the fall of 1973.
UC Costs Increase
But the problem is equally complex at the
state level, where the traditional policy of
little or no tuition at its institutions "was
breached two years ago," according to Lyle
Gainsley, University of California director of
admissions.
At that time, an educational fee of $100
was added to the registration fee of $100, in
effect doubling the "tuition" at the nine UC
campuses.
The move was resisted by the University
administration but imposed by the UC
regents, led by Gov. Ronald Reagan, who felt
that students and parents should bear a
greater part of the burden of their education.
As a result, although freshmen enrollment
figures at UC continue to match previous
predictions, the number of continuing upper
classmen has dropped.
"We hear from the community colleges
(the locally-funded two-year institutions]
that more and more applicants who were
formerly UC material are turning up there,"
Gainsley said.
"Although we don't have any figures or
formal studies to prove it, we know intuitively
that this shift is occurring.

"The methodology we use for determining
a student's financial need conforms to the
Collegiate Scholastic Service guidelines, as
does Stanford's. The problem is that the
middle classes are being strained by the
increases, but not badly enough to qualify for
financial aid under this system.
Hesitant Taxpayers
"The money to make up for this in
individual cases has to come from somewhere.
The state and the taxpayers are proving
increasingly hesitant to respond to this need.
"To make matters worse, President Nixon's
proposed budget cuts back on federal funding
in support of higher education. This will
intensify the problem," Gainsley stated.
Dr. David Kagan, dean of Student Affairs
of the California State Universities and
Colleges, stated that the California taxpayer
has been pushed to the limit of support for
public education, and that new ways of
financing must be found.
Full-Cost Pricing
A recent report to the state legislature
suggested instituting full-cost pricing at all of
the college-level state institutions. This would
raise the cost of attending UC from $638 to
$2041, and the cost of a state university or
college from between $117 and $168 to
$2047.
It would also require the initiation of a
$140 tuition rate at the currently tuition-free
community colleges.

One of the alternatives available to keep
from squeezing the lower and middle classes
out of the college and university market is to
increase the amount of individual financial aid
offered.
Harlan Stamm, dean of Academic Programs
and Student Affairs for the community
colleges, stated, "Imposition of tuition would
cut our enrollment by two-thirds. It would
fail to save the state any money because it
would simply increase the size of the
disadvantaged group who would require
individual aid.
Playing 'Robin Hood'
"It's a vicious game of 'Robin Hood' —
robbing the rich to give to the poor. If we
force students out of the community colleges,
they'll wind up in vocational schools or on the
streets, unskilled, and we'll eventually end up
paying for them anyway through welfare and
other aid programs.
"Then everyone will start screaming to
educate our youth and it will start all over
again."
Enrollment at community colleges has
already declined slightly. Stamm attributes
this to several factors — the end of the draft, a
better job market for those with only a high
school education, and the move to vocational
schools which offer shorter term, intensive
skill training which is more salable in the job
market than a liberal arts education.
Increasing educational costs and decreasing
willingness on the part of taxpayers and
government to subsidize universities, both
private and public, may be causing a
dangerous trend toward high tuitions which
many members of the middle class cannot
afford.
Undergraduate enrollment at the 49
member campuses of the Association of
Independent California Colleges and
Universities dropped 1.7 percent last fall, the
first time it has shown a decrease in 20 years.

percent since 1960 — 37.1 percent of it since
1969.
Still, tuition receipts make up only half the
University's budget.
Comparable Increases
Compared to a nine percent tuition
increase from 1971 to 1972 at Stanford,
comparable schools (all of which have higher

tuitions) experienced the following hikes:
Yale, 10 percent; Princeton, nine percent; and
Harvard and Cornell, seven percent.
Provost William Miller has often denied
that Stanford is "squeezing out the middle
class."
At present, it's estimated that only 26
percent of those freshmen who decline
admission here choose public schools with
lower tuition rates.
But total freshman applications were down
6.7 percent for 1970-71 and were down
another 5.4 percent in 71-72. Because of
rising costs, students may not even be
applying.
Financial Aid Increa*«
In order to continue its policy of admitting
and enrolling the students with the most
potential and promise, regardless of economic
standing, the amount of undergraduate
financial aid would have to be increased by
$385,000.
Lyman Glenny, director of the University
of California at Berkeley's Center for
Research and Development in Higher
Education, told a meeting of the American
Association of Colleges last month that
independent universities may be eventually
forced to price themselves out of the market
to the point that they require federal aid and
lose their autonomy.
According to the CEEB report, the average
tuition per year at California's private

institutions is now $1,146 more than at UC,
$1,597 more than the state universities and
colleges, and $1,776 more than the
community colleges. The tuition gap is
expected to be $2,000 by the fall of 1973.
UC Costs Increase
But the problem is equally complex at the
state level, where the traditional policy of
little or no tuition at its institutions "was
breached two years ago," according to Lyle
Gainsley, University of California director of
admissions.
At that time, an educational fee of $100
was added to the registration fee of $100, in
effect doubling the "tuition" at the nine UC
campuses.
The move was resisted by the University
administration but imposed by the UC
regents, led by Gov. Ronald Reagan, who felt
that students and parents should bear a
greater part of the burden of their education.
As a result, although freshmen enrollment
figures at UC continue to match previous
predictions, the number of continuing upper
classmen has dropped.
"We hear from the community colleges
(the locally-funded two-year institutions]
that more and more applicants who were
formerly UC material are turning up there,"
Gainsley said.
"Although we don't have any figures or
formal studies to prove it, we know intuitively
that this shift is occurring.

"The methodology we use for determining
a student's financial need conforms to the
Collegiate Scholastic Service guidelines, as
does Stanford's. The problem is that the
middle classes are being strained by the
increases, but not badly enough to qualify for
financial aid under this system.
Hesitant Taxpayers
"The money to make up for this in
individual cases has to come from somewhere.
The state and the taxpayers are proving
increasingly hesitant to respond to this need.
"To make matters worse, President Nixon's
proposed budget cuts back on federal funding
in support of higher education. This will
intensify the problem," Gainsley stated.
Dr. David Kagan, dean of Student Affairs
of the California State Universities and
Colleges, stated that the California taxpayer
has been pushed to the limit of support for
public education, and that new ways of
financing must be found.
Full-Cost Pricing
A recent report to the state legislature
suggested instituting full-cost pricing at all of
the college-level state institutions. This would
raise the cost of attending UC from $638 to
$2041, and the cost of a state university or
college from between $117 and $168 to
$2047.
It would also require the initiation of a
$140 tuition rate at the currently tuition-free
community colleges.

One of the alternatives available to keep
from squeezing the lower and middle classes
out of the college and university market is to
increase the amount of individual financial aid
offered.
Harlan Stamm, dean of Academic Programs
and Student Affairs for the community
colleges, stated, "Imposition of tuition would
cut our enrollment by two-thirds. It would
fail to save the state any money because it
would simply increase the size of the
disadvantaged group who would require
individual aid.
Playing 'Robin Hood'
"It's a vicious game of 'Robin Hood' —
robbing the rich to give to the poor. If we
force students out of the community colleges,
they'll wind up in vocational schools or on the
streets, unskilled, and we'll eventually end up
paying for them anyway through welfare and
other aid programs.
"Then everyone will start screaming to
educate our youth and it will start all over
again."
Enrollment at community colleges has
already declined slightly. Stamm attributes
this to several factors — the end of the draft, a
better job market for those with only a high
school education, and the move to vocational
schools which offer shorter term, intensive
skill training which is more salable in the job
market than a liberal arts education.
Increasing educational costs and decreasing
willingness on the part of taxpayers and
government to subsidize universities, both
private and public, may be causing a
dangerous trend toward high tuitions which
many members of the middle class cannot
afford.
Undergraduate enrollment at the 49
member campuses of the Association of
Independent California Colleges and
Universities dropped 1.7 percent last fall, the
first time it has shown a decrease in 20 years.
The recently released report on
Independent Higher Education in California
by the College Entrance Examination Board
(CEEB) in Palo Alto expressed the fear that
private schools are pricing themselves out of
the market, because tuition has been raised
too high and too fast.
On one hand, the cost of providing a
constant level of quality in universities is
rising and must somehow be passed on to the
student. At Stanford, the total cost to the
student for an education has risen 125.5
percent since 1960 — 37.1 percent of it since
1969.
Still, tuition receipts make up only half the
University's budget.
