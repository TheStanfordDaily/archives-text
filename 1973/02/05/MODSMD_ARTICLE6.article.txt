# Lucubration Spreads
## Pre-Med Pressure 
### 
Daniel Brenner

"Lucubrate" is one of those
obscure words adored by College
Entrance Examination Board test
writers. It means to "burn the
midnight oil," and about this time
of the quarter, it assumes keen
relevance.
To the cadres of organic
chemistry students who have been
flipping formula flash cards,
building "Cootie' Mike molecular
models, and dreaming of being
excused from the final exam
because of high midterm scores,
lucubration has been the order of
the night.
For these students, organic
chemistry, like many other
pre-medical requirements, are
hurdles that have to be jumped in
order to get into med school. But
as the problem of working
through thousands of med school
applications grows, the
relationship between last night's
hard work in organic and the
transcript supposedly representing
that work grows threadbare.
The GPA Shuffle
Grades sent to medical school
are aggregated into a lump sum,
the GPA. While scores are split
into science and non-science
totals, distinctions between
courses in each category are lost
in the GPA shuffle. Tireless
devotion to organic chemistry,
resulting in a B+ or A-, may be
effaced from the GPA by a poor
score in a freshman chemistry
class. And a student who
completes organic at Stanford will
not be taking the same course as
one offered at a less or more
demanding institution.
Maybe the breaks all even out
in the end, and every Micky grade
is balanced out by an arm twister.
But maybe not.
For as the pressure cooker that

the pre-med incubates in during
his wonderful undergraduate days
becomes more pressurized, the
time schedule no longer just lists
courses: it's a handbook for
survival. Required to take a big
helping of physichemibiomatics
every quarter, the premed is
forced to find ways to fill up the
class schedule with low-work
requirements. This allows her or
him to keep GPA in the
non-sciences high and leave time
for more redhotting where it
really counts.
The pre-med winds up with a
course schedule in the short run
and a college degree in the long
run that is not based on
preference but necessity. After all,
the pre-med leaves Stanford to go
on to med school, and he'll need
one thing to make the move: a
competitive GPA.
Commitment
Pre-meds have known about
this for years: goof-offs with low
grades have never talked
themselves into med schools, no
matterhow many fraternity keys
they can rattle.
But this commitment to hard
work is being made by more
people than ever. This year's
freshman class has set records for
wanting to go for the M.D. degree.
And some upper classmen, finding
business to be stifling or too
uncreative, have changed over to
the sciences which offer a
no-nonsense education for their
ballooning tuition dollar.
The upshot is that, unless
departments are ready to grant
more high grades, tests are bound
to become severe as all but the
white-hot premeds make it
through the obstacle course.
Grades may become the be-all and
the end-all of the pre-meds' days,

grades which go to a GPA that can
be fattened by taking the simple
courses.
Grade pressure is not peculiar
to premeds, but it seems to affect
them the most. One source of this
has to be reliance on GPAs by
graduate school admission
committees. But there is probably
no way to circumvent all grades,
the MCAT, a para-aptitude exam
for would-be doctors,
notwithstanding.
Until some University
committee can pull together a
proposal to ease up the pressure
on premeds, they can use an
obscure word to explain to other
people what you do at night. So
the next time a premed is asked
what he's doing at Stanford, he
can say he's lucubrating. At least
it sounds more interesting.

"Lucubrate" is one of those
obscure words adored by College
Entrance Examination Board test
writers. It means to "burn the
midnight oil," and about this time
of the quarter, it assumes keen
relevance.
To the cadres of organic
chemistry students who have been
flipping formula flash cards,
building "Cootie' Mike molecular
models, and dreaming of being
excused from the final exam
because of high midterm scores,
lucubration has been the order of
the night.
For these students, organic
chemistry, like many other
pre-medical requirements, are
hurdles that have to be jumped in
order to get into med school. But
as the problem of working
through thousands of med school
applications grows, the
relationship between last night's
hard work in organic and the
transcript supposedly representing
that work grows threadbare.
The GPA Shuffle
Grades sent to medical school
are aggregated into a lump sum,
the GPA. While scores are split
into science and non-science
totals, distinctions between
courses in each category are lost
in the GPA shuffle. Tireless
devotion to organic chemistry,
resulting in a B+ or A-, may be
effaced from the GPA by a poor
score in a freshman chemistry
class. And a student who
completes organic at Stanford will
not be taking the same course as
one offered at a less or more
demanding institution.
Maybe the breaks all even out
in the end, and every Micky grade
is balanced out by an arm twister.
But maybe not.
For as the pressure cooker that

the pre-med incubates in during
his wonderful undergraduate days
becomes more pressurized, the
time schedule no longer just lists
courses: it's a handbook for
survival. Required to take a big
helping of physichemibiomatics
every quarter, the premed is
forced to find ways to fill up the
class schedule with low-work
requirements. This allows her or
him to keep GPA in the
non-sciences high and leave time
for more redhotting where it
really counts.
The pre-med winds up with a
course schedule in the short run
and a college degree in the long
run that is not based on
preference but necessity. After all,
the pre-med leaves Stanford to go
on to med school, and he'll need
one thing to make the move: a
competitive GPA.
Commitment
Pre-meds have known about
this for years: goof-offs with low
grades have never talked
themselves into med schools, no
matterhow many fraternity keys
they can rattle.
But this commitment to hard
work is being made by more
people than ever. This year's
freshman class has set records for
wanting to go for the M.D. degree.
And some upper classmen, finding
business to be stifling or too
uncreative, have changed over to
the sciences which offer a
no-nonsense education for their
ballooning tuition dollar.
The upshot is that, unless
departments are ready to grant
more high grades, tests are bound
to become severe as all but the
white-hot premeds make it
through the obstacle course.
Grades may become the be-all and
the end-all of the pre-meds' days,

grades which go to a GPA that can
be fattened by taking the simple
courses.
Grade pressure is not peculiar
to premeds, but it seems to affect
them the most. One source of this
has to be reliance on GPAs by
graduate school admission
committees. But there is probably
no way to circumvent all grades,
the MCAT, a para-aptitude exam
for would-be doctors,
notwithstanding.
Until some University
committee can pull together a
proposal to ease up the pressure
on premeds, they can use an
obscure word to explain to other
people what you do at night. So
the next time a premed is asked
what he's doing at Stanford, he
can say he's lucubrating. At least
