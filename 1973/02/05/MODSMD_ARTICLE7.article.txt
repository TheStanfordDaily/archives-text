# Challenges Fail
## Seniority Survives 
### 
Paul N. McCloskey

The first stirrings of congressional reform in the
new 93rd Congress were not exactly overwhelming.
All attempts to end the seniority system were
beaten back.
Both Democrats and Republicans again elected
their 21 most senior members as Chairmen and
Ranking Members, respectively. There were six
challenges on the Democratic side, but the closest
vote upheld tradition by a margin of over two to
one, even though the votes were by secret ballot.
There were only two contests on the Republican
side. Conservative John Erlenborn (111.) challenged
liberal Frank Horton (N.Y.) for the ranking
minority position on the Committee on
Government Operations, but Horton, the senior
man, was approved 100 to 33. Both men were of
equal ability and energy. Most members I talked to
were in agreement that other things being equal,
neither personality nor philosophy should be the
determining factor.
Second Challenge
The second Republican challenge was more
indicative of the hidden strength and tenacity of the
seniority tradition. On the Armed Services
Committee, the top eight congressmen are all
conservative, and all have supported the war. The
first and third senior-ranking members, Les Arends
(111.) and Bob Wilson (Calif.) were disqualified by
reason of holding party leadership positions.
This made Bill Bray (Ind.), who will be 70 this
spring, next in order. Bill Bray is a very decent and
kindly man, but not generally considered by his
colleagues as having achieved marks of excellence
for capability, effort and leadership. Bray holds a
Silver Star from World War II and is often reflective,
in attitude and thinking, of the glories of that last
great chapter in American military history, rather

than of today's realities.
Behind Bray was Charlie Gubser, a long-standing
supporter of the President on the Vietnam war and
an advocate for greater defense spending and
Pentagon secrecy, but highly respected by his
colleagues for his managerial talents, knowledge and
devotion to improvement of the armed forces.
Gubser Declines
I nominated Gubser for the ranking position,
only to have him respectfully decline, stating to the
Conference that he favored Bill Bray and retention
of the seniority system.
Even so, Gubser got 30 votes, Bray being
approved by a vote of 101 to 30. Had Gubser
actively sought the position, I believe the vote
would have been very close. Of 192 Republican
members, 43 are freshmen, and nearly three-fourts
of us are in our first four terms, with little love for
the iron grip of the seniority system.
The Democrats have a somewhat higher average
age and length of service, with only 25 new
members this year and much greater percentage of
older members.
Some Progress
If the House didn't do much to change seniority,
the voters did. Four senior members were defeated
in primaries and 19 others chose to finally retire
rather than face another election. Of the three
chairmen in their 80's, two were defeated and one
retired, dropping the average age of this year's
chairmen to 65.
Republican ranking members average only 58
years of age this year. Only seven of 21 chairmen
will be in their 70's during this Congress, so perhaps
we are making progress.

Conference that he favored Bill Bray and retention
of the seniority system.
Even so, Gubser got 30 votes, Bray being
approved by a vote of 101 to 30. Had Gubser
actively sought the position, I believe the vote
would have been very close. Of 192 Republican
members, 43 are freshmen, and nearly three-fourts
of us are in our first four terms, with little love for
the iron grip of the seniority system.
The Democrats have a somewhat higher average
age and length of service, with only 25 new
members this year and much greater percentage of
older members.
Some Progress
If the House didn't do much to change seniority,
the voters did. Four senior members were defeated
in primaries and 19 others chose to finally retire
rather than face another election. Of the three
chairmen in their 80's, two were defeated and one
retired, dropping the average age of this year's
chairmen to 65.
Republican ranking members average only 58
years of age this year. Only seven of 21 chairmen
will be in their 70's during this Congress, so perhaps
we are making progress.

from California's seventeenth district.)


Another U.S. Withdrawal
Paul N. McCloskey

The first stirrings of congressional reform in the
new 93rd Congress were not exactly overwhelming.
All attempts to end the seniority system were
beaten back.
Both Democrats and Republicans again elected
their 21 most senior members as Chairmen and
Ranking Members, respectively. There were six
challenges on the Democratic side, but the closest
vote upheld tradition by a margin of over two to
one, even though the votes were by secret ballot.
There were only two contests on the Republican
side. Conservative John Erlenborn (111.) challenged
liberal Frank Horton (N.Y.) for the ranking
minority position on the Committee on
Government Operations, but Horton, the senior
man, was approved 100 to 33. Both men were of
equal ability and energy. Most members I talked to
were in agreement that other things being equal,
neither personality nor philosophy should be the
determining factor.
Second Challenge
The second Republican challenge was more
indicative of the hidden strength and tenacity of the
seniority tradition. On the Armed Services
Committee, the top eight congressmen are all
conservative, and all have supported the war. The
first and third senior-ranking members, Les Arends
(111.) and Bob Wilson (Calif.) were disqualified by
reason of holding party leadership positions.
This made Bill Bray (Ind.), who will be 70 this
spring, next in order. Bill Bray is a very decent and
kindly man, but not generally considered by his
colleagues as having achieved marks of excellence
for capability, effort and leadership. Bray holds a
Silver Star from World War II and is often reflective,
in attitude and thinking, of the glories of that last
great chapter in American military history, rather

than of today's realities.
Behind Bray was Charlie Gubser, a long-standing
supporter of the President on the Vietnam war and
an advocate for greater defense spending and
Pentagon secrecy, but highly respected by his
colleagues for his managerial talents, knowledge and
devotion to improvement of the armed forces.
Gubser Declines
I nominated Gubser for the ranking position,
only to have him respectfully decline, stating to the
Conference that he favored Bill Bray and retention
of the seniority system.
Even so, Gubser got 30 votes, Bray being
approved by a vote of 101 to 30. Had Gubser
