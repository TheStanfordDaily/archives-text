# Social Responsibility
## The 						University And Institutional Ethics 
### 
David Abernethy

(First of two parts.)
Under what conditions, for
what reasons, and by what means
should a university attempt to
change the behavior of political
and economic institutions in its
own society?
These questions have been
persistently posed on American
campuses by our government's
lengthy involvement in Indochina,
which has multiplied and made
more visible the linkages among
universities, government agencies,

and private corporations. The war
has shown how difficult it is for a
university to decide whether to
exert influence on other
institutions, and how very limited
that influence can be. But the war
has also underscored the
importance of applying ethical
judgments to the policies of large
bureaucratic structures, both
public and private.
It is not simply that these
structures have committed acts
many people would consider evil.
It is also that the increased
interdependence of our major
institutions enables evil acts to
occur while each of the
participants piously disclaims
responsibility for the end result.
The capacity of the
"military-industrial-academic
complex" to pass the buck,
morally speaking, seems to
increase along with its capacity to
use — or misuse — power.
High Price
One of the war's lessons,
therefore, may be that a society at
our level of organized complexity
pays a high price — in terms of
less of cohesion, direction, and
political legitimacy — if concepts
of institutional and
inter-institutional morality are not
consciously developed and widely
applied. To American universities,
in the post-war period, could well
fall the crucial task of working
out the implications of this
wartime lesson.
At Stanford, as on other
campuses, the loose and often
uneasy coalition of liberals and
radicals comprising the anti-war
movement tried since 1965 first
to publicize and then to weaken
or erode the links between the
university and those institutions
considered most directly
responsible for American crimes
of watf? The principal targets were
[1] research projects sponsored
by the Department of Defense
(see the controversies over
classified research and Stanford
Research Institute, and the
subsequent drive to phase out
campus-based DOD contracts) and
[2] university facilities aiding
recruitment of students into
objectionable institutions (see the
"Off ROTC" controversy and
subsequent disruptions at the
Placement Center when Navy or
Honeywell recruiters came to
call).
In both cases "the movement"
experienced initial success —
classified research was ended and
ROTC phased out — followed by
failure to convince the university
community that a more sweeping
attack on the research and
recruitment points of linkage was
warranted. This failure was due in
part to the radicals' tactics,
notably their willingness to
encourage or at least condone
campus violence and their ready
substitution of rhetorical slogans
for arguments based on factual
evidence and clear ethical
reasoning.
Institutional Identity
More fundamentally, however,
the attack failed because
proposals to break linkages with
other institutions ran counter to
certain values by which the
university defined its own special
institutional identity. Prohibiting
DOD contracts would interfere
with a faculty member's freedom
to define fruitful areas for
research; denying certain
recruiter access to the Placement
Center would interfere with a
student's freedom to make fully
informed vocational choices. The
university's commitment to
encouraging its individual
members' free pursuit of
knowledge (or knowledge-related
employment) was so central to its
own purpose that the
commitment to use institutional

leverage against DOD and its
corporate contractors was
weakened even among those
persons favoring a resort to
leverage on other grounds. The
failures of the anti-war movement
at Stanford suggest another
lesson: an institution will not
substantially alter its relationship
with other institutions if in so
doing it must seriously
compromise its own core values.
Thus the war has taught us the
importance of developing an ethic
that relates to institutional and
inter-institutional behavior, while
campus protests against the war
have revealed the difficulties
inherent in applying such an ethic
to a university's research and
recruitment links with the
"outside world." Where, then,
should the ethic be applied?
Several factors, taken together,
suggest that the investment
linkage between universities and
major corporations merits
increased future attention. First
of all, the investment linkage is
substantial. Stanford, for
example, now holds over $130
million in merged fund stocks and
almost $100 million in yield and
gain pool stocks.
Stable
Second, the investment linkage
is stable. Stanford's role as
stockholder long preceded — and
might even outlast — its role as
research contractor for
government. And the issues raised
by corporate behavior in society
will be with us in peacetime as well
as in war, whereas campus
attitudes toward the Defense
Department vary according to the
nature and extent of American
military involvement abroad at
any given point in time.
Third, changes in the
university's investment policy
need not pose the threat to core
values that changes in its research
of recruitment policy would
entail. The prudent investment of
university funds is of course an
important responsibility,
particularly for the Trustees. But
it is important only in the sense
that the assurance of current and
future income enables the
university to get on with the
central, and quite different, task
of transmitting, producing, and
criticizing the artifacts of human
culture.
Moreover, the value of
maximizing freedom for
individual members of the
university community cannot be
used, as in previous controversies,
as a reason for refusing to take an
institutional stand on the behavior
of corporations in which the
university has purchased stock.
For the very act of purchase is
necessarily an institutional stand,
the university acting as a
collective entity to support
financially, as well as to assume
partial ownership of, another
collective entity. Because
shareholder non-participation in
proxy voting normally counts as
participation on the side of
management, it may be as
difficult for the university to
avoid taking a stand — even by
abstention — on the controversial
actions of corporations as it may
be improper to take an
institutional stand on the
controversial actions of
government.
Impact
Finally, the decisions of
American corporations obviously
have a profound effect upon our
society, and elsewhere in the
world as the companies have
become multi national. Somewhat
less obviously, the magnitude of
that impact, relative to the impact
of federal government decisions, is
quite likely to increase in the
future.
On the domestic front, the

Nixon Administration is busily
dismantling categorical programs
in the social services field, which,
despite their inefficiencies,were at
least directed toward the
disadvantaged elements of the
population and some of our most
intractable social problems.
Government is likely in the next
few years to be criticized as much
for sins of omission as of
commission, and those who have
traditionally looked to
Washington to regulate abuses of
corporate power may be
increasingly disappointed.
Socially concerned individuals
and groups may thus find no
alternative to directly confronting
corporate structures and insisting
on a greater measure of social
responsibility in their hiring, plant
location, worker participation,
pension, pollution control,
defense contracting, and other
policies. On the international
front, an end to massive American

entanglement in Indochina —
where, despite Marxist rhetoric,
American corporate interests were
quite limited — will permit greater
popular concern for other parts of
the world, such as southern Africa
or Chile, where the activity of our
"multi-nationals" is considerably
more intensive and may more
directly conflict with the long-run
interests of Third World people.
President Coolidge's immortal
dictum that the business of
America is business — a point on
which the ideological left and
right apparently concur — may be
even more applicable to the
1970's than to the immediately
preceding decades.
For these reasons, members of
the university community
concerned with institutional
ethics would do well to focus their
attention on the exercise of
academia's "portfolio power."
