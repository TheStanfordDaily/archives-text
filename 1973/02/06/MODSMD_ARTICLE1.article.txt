# New Neighbor Possible For Stanford Hospital
## 
### ROBERT BACON First in a series 
Stanford Medical Center may have
a new medical neighbor in several
years.
The Palo Alto Medical Clinic
(PAMC) has entered into negotiation
with Stanford for a possible relocation
of the Clinic to a site adjacent to the
Medical Center.
Officials of both institutions are
encouraged by the negotiations thus
far, although the subject is very
complex and they stress that there is a
long way to go, with many issues still
to be resolved.
PAMC's plans were once
substantially more ambitious. Until
last year, it had on the drawing boards
a hospital of its own. Various factors

caused it to abandon that plan and
turn toward cooperation with
Stanford.
Private Group Practice
Tht' Palo Alto Medical Clinic,
founded in 1931, has grown to
become one of the largest private
group practices in the western states.
Its medical staff consists of 130
physicians and surgeons, representing
all major medical specialities.
Its principal facilities are located in
a complex of buildings at 300 Homer
Ave. in downtown Palo Alto.
Although the newest and largest of the
buildings is only 12 years old, the
clinic is rapidly outgrowing its
facilities.
Zoning regulations and the
surrounding residential area present
barriers to expansion on that site.
Disposal of the present facilities is a
major obstacle to a move.
"We're studying our space needs,"
according to PAMC Executive
Administrator John Johnson. His
organization c'/early has its collective
eye on relocation near Stanford
Medical Center. "If Stanford land is
available, and we could sell this [300
Homer Avenue] facility," Johnson
said, the clinic would prefer to locate
near the Medical Center.
Convenience
Johnson stressed the convenience
to both doctor and patient in having
outpatient clinic facilities and the
hospital adjacent to one another.
Medical School Dean Clayton Rich,
who called a move by (he clinic to
Stanford "potentially very
worthwhile," also emphasized the
convenience factor as a principal
motivation of PAMC planners.
Bol;h Rich and Johnson stressed
that there is still a long v/ay to go.
Academic Program
"We've considered t,his seriously,"
Rich said last week. "There isn't much
land around the hospital. There'll be
no move unless there is academic
justification for it. They would have to
be substantially involved in the
academic program. It's academic land

— and there isn't much of it."
Rich continued, "We're also
looking into how, if they move, they
and our faculty would interrelate."
Describing the status of the
negotiations, the Dean said, "Their
executive group is talking with us.
Eventually, their executives will go to
their physician partners, and I will go
to our faculty, with the results of the
negotiations. That would happen
before we present it to the University
Trustees.
'Very Interesting'
"We're in the early stages of
something very interesting. It's too
early to say what will emerge," he
noted.
He also explained that "other Palo
Alto physicians might want to move
here in the same way as the Palo Alto
Medical Clinic. We wouldn't just bring
them [PAMC] in and exclude other
doctors."
PAMC and Stanford are not
strangers. Cowell Student Health
Center is operated by PAMC by
contract with the University to
provide medical care for Stanford
students; its staff are employees not of
the University but of PAMC.
Prepaid Health Care
Stanford faculty and staff may
elect to purchase a prepaid health care
plan offered through PAMC and Blue
Cross.
Many Stanford medical students
take clinical clerkships, an important
part of their practical training, at
PAMC. Students in Stanford's
physician's assistant program also train
there.
Most of PAMC's staff physicians
hold non-salaried clinical faculty
appointments at the Medical School,
assisting in both classroom and clinical
teaching.
More than one-third of the
community physicians entitled to
place patients in Stanford Hospital
practice at PAMC.

arrangements.)

Convenience
Johnson stressed the convenience
to both doctor and patient in having

Stanford "potentially very
worthwhile," also emphasized the
convenience factor as a principal

Academic Program
"We've considered t,his seriously,"
Rich said last week. "There isn't much
land around the hospital. There'll be
no move unless there is academic
justification for it. They would have to
be substantially involved in the
academic program. It's academic land

— and there isn't much of it."
Rich continued, "We're also
looking into how, if they move, they
and our faculty would interrelate."
Describing the status of the
negotiations, the Dean said, "Their
executive group is talking with us.
Eventually, their executives will go to
their physician partners, and I will go
to our faculty, with the results of the
negotiations. That would happen
before we present it to the University
Trustees.
'Very Interesting'
"We're in the early stages of
something very interesting. It's too
early to say what will emerge," he
noted.
He also explained that "other Palo

MOVING? — The Palo Alto Medical Clinic consists of 130 physicians, most of whom presently practice in this
three-story building at 300 Homer Ave. in downtown Palo Alto. The clinic is cramped for space, and its officials are
discussing the possibility of moving to a new location on University land near the Stanford Medical Center.
Stanford Medical Center may have
a new medical neighbor in several
years.
The Palo Alto Medical Clinic
(PAMC) has entered into negotiation
with Stanford for a possible relocation

encouraged by the negotiations thus
far, although the subject is very
complex and they stress that there is a
long way to go, with many issues still
to be resolved.
PAMC's plans were once
substantially more ambitious. Until

a hospital of its own. Various factors

caused it to abandon that plan and
