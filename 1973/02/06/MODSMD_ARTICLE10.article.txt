# Investment Guidelines Empty
## The 						University And Institutional Ethics 
###

(Second of two parts)
In an earlier essary I argued for
the establishment of guidelines by
which the behavior of an
institution, and its relationships
with other institutions, could be
eth.ically judged. I further argued
thai;, in the case of a university, it
may be easier and more
appropriate to devise guidelines
concerning its investment than its
research or recruitment links to
the "outside world."
Bui what investment guidelines
should be devised, and what
problems arise when one attempts
to apply abstract moral principles
to concrete cases? The reception
given a recent proposal that
Stanford no longer invest in
companies producing
anti-personnel weapons provides
some revealing answers—and raises
some disturbing questions.
Stanford was one of the first
universities to adopt a set of
investment guidelines taking social
responsibility factors into
account. A policy statement
approved by the Trustees in April,
1971 notes that the Board will
"give independent consideration
and weight to the possible social,

economic, and political
implications of University
investment policy in three classes
of cases." One of the classes
covers a company in which the
University holds securities, where
(1) "The undesirable social,
economic, political acts of the
company involved are direct and
substantial; (2) Substantial
consensus exists in the University
community on the undesirability
of the acts or effects in
question . . . ; (3) The economic
costs to the University of taking
action are commensurate with the
probable effects of that action."
These guidelines are sensible ones,
though like most general
statements they do not specify
the meaning of key terms, the
rules for determining definitions,
or the weights assigned the
different criteria being employed.
Testing Guidelines
In May of last year, in an effort
to test the meaning of these
guidelines and as a personal
witness against our government's
expandirfc air offensive in
Indochina, I proposed to the
University's Commissionn on
Investment Responsibility that
Stanford not knowingly invest in
companies that were prime
contractors for the production of
anti-personnel weapons. If shares
were heltf in such a company, I
proposed« that the appropriate
University officials try to
persuade the company to
disengage from anti-personnel
contracts at the earliest possible
date. If it became clear that the
company would not change its
policy, the University should sell
its shares in that firm.
The proposal was unanimously
approved by the Commission and
by August was expanded into a
24-page document for the
Trustees, replete with definitions
of key terms and appendices
indicating which companies have
produced guava and pineapple
bombs, flechette warheads, gravel,

spider, and dragontooth mines,
and the like.
In the expanded proposal,
which has yet to be sent to the
Trustees for their consideration, I
contended that the University's
guidelines clearly applied to
companies producing
anti-personnel weapons. Here was
a case where company products
directly caused many
non-combatants to suffer and
many combatants to suffer
excessively. Companies were
deemed "substantial" producers if
they had contracted for a certain
volume and variety of
anti-personnel weapons; producers
with under $10 million in
contracts and only one weapon,
for example, might be exempted.
Consensus
As for "substantial consensus,"
it was difficult for me to imagine
an issue on which students,
faculty, staff, and alumni were
more likely to reach agreement
than on the undesirability of
weapons whose sole aim is to
produce indiscriminate, excessive
human suffering. As for the third
guideline, the cost of adopting the
proposal could be reduced if
certain procedures were followed.
Direct benefits to Stanford would
be minimal, but action in concert
with other institutional investors
might stimulate a rethinking of
U.S. policy on the use of
anti-personnel weapons, with
considerable benefit to potential
victims in other countries.
The Commission on
Investment Responsibility, most
of its 1972-73 members newly
appointed, apparently had second
thoughts about the impulsive
unanimity with which its
predecessor had approved the
proposal in May. When it met
early last month, the Commission
was unable to affirm by a decisive
majority that the proposal met
any of the three guidelines.
Robert Augsburger, the Vice
President for Business and

Finance and the man whom the
Commission advises, then decided
that guidelines 1 and 3 had not
been met and guideline 2 was only
"marginally" satisfied. The
proposal, in short, was not
acceptable. This decision was
evidently based on the following
interpretation of the guidelines:
1) Production of a noxious
class of items must represent a
substantial portion of a
company's total sales before the
first guideline can be met. (An
exception may be made when the
company approaches a monopoly
position in the sale of those
items.) Martin-Marietta
Corporation, for example,
probably accounts for a
substantial portion of
an ti-personnel contract volume.
But because that amount is an
insignificant portion of the
corporation's overall sales,
Stanford is not justified in
pressing for termination of its
anti-personnel contracts.
'Soundings'
2) If informal "soundings" by
Commission members reveal signs
of opposition to a proposed
change in investment policy,
substantial consensus as to its
desirability is probably lacking.
3) The calculus of costs to the
University may include the
possible adverse reaction of other
institutions over issues quite
distinct from the investment issue.
In the case at hand, it was felt
that adoption of a policy on
anti-personnel weapons might
stimulate Congressional hawks to
revive the Hebert Amendment,
withholding defense-related
research contracts from all
universities (including Stanford)
which had eliminated ROTC
programs. Even though, as argued
earlier, the research linkage with
government is very different from
the investment link with
corporations, the loss of research
income may be counted among
the costs of a change in

investment policy.
4) The calculus of benefits
should include only the likely
effect of Stanford's action, taken
alone. If the new policy affects
few companies (this one concerns
investments in Martin-Marietta,
possibly Dupont and
Sperry-Rand), and if it is not
publicized or made the basis for a
concerted investor campaign, the
chances are slim that fewer
anti-personnel weapons will be
produced or deployed. Hence the
benefits will be minimal.
Publicity Unwise
5) Even if the new policy were
adopted, it would be unwise for
the University to publicize this
fact or to spearhead an investor
campaign in connection with it,
because costs (i.e., donor
alienation) rise in proportion to
publicity. It is better to do the
right thing without explaining to
the public—or even the offending
company—why one is doing it
than to explain one's actions and
risk loss of support from other
institutions and influential
individuals.
As far as I can determine, these
propositions represent the official,
albeit informal, University
interpretation of its investment
guidelines. This interpretation
deserves to be publicized—and
criticized. Each of the above
propositions is dubious, in my
view, and the net effect of all five
is, of course, to limit severely the
application of the general
guidelines to specific cases.
If the guidelines do not apply
to what is perhaps the purest case
of undesirable corporate activity,
then to what companies,
products, or situations do they
apply? Indeed, are we not fooling
ourselves when we claim even to
possess guidelines? Might not a
more honest approach be to scrap
them altogether?
