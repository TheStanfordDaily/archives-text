# Unorthodox Announcement
## Politics And The Grateful Dead 
### 
~Richard Peers

The announcement of the
Grateful Dead concert scheduled
for February 9 is a cause for
satisfaction and elation by the
Stanford community.
Unfortunately, in conjunction
with this announcement, Stanford
has been subjected to an
incredible display of politics in
the form of a "Thank You"
handbill from Peter Van Petten
and Ron Shannon. Mr. Van Petten
(an ASSU co-President) and Mr.
Shannon (the Special Events
Director), in "thanking" us for
our co-operation in passing the
special events fee assessment and
of informing us of the upcoming
Grateful Dead concert, have
blatantly linked their names to
this popular concert. This linkage
is an apparent political move.
The very format of the
handbill points to the politics
involved. Placement of the names
of Mr. Van Petten and Mr.
Shannon at the top of the sheet,
in larger letters than the
subsequent listing of the Grateful
Dead, leave no doubt as to whom
the announcement is for:
certainly this is an unorthodox
and unusual method by which to
advertise the concert.
As Co-President and Special
Events Director, one assumes Mr.
Van Petten's and Mr. Shannon's
expected duties would include
providing entertainment for the

community. It would seem special
notice of their success need hardly
be made. Mention of these
achievements at times of
electioneering would be
understandable; they seem hardly
appropriate now.
Apparent Endorsement
The question of politics and
the Grateful Dead is especially
significant in light of a recent
statement by Scott Burke. Mr.
Burke, Van Petten's co-president,
indicated at a recent press
conference that he hoped Mr. Van
Petten would consider running
again. In the face of this apparent
endorsement, the use of Mr. Van
Petten's name on the handbill
becomes a sensitive political issue,
one wisely avoided unless
publicity is sought.
The payment for these
handbills indicates that publicity
was a consideration. Assurance
was given by Mr. Van Petten that
ASSU funds were not used, and
that he paid for the
advertisements. Thus assured, we
can at least be happy that this
personal publicity was not
generated with ASSU funds. But
since these handbills were
personally paid for by these two
gentlemen, the utilization of the
Grateful Dead concert for
political publicity must have been
deliberate, and must be
condemned.

Of course, should the
allegation of political use of the
concert be incorrect, an
announcement by Mr. Van Petten
and Mr. Shannon of their
intention not to run for office
would be in order. This will
ensure that the use of their names
on the handbill will not be

misconstrued. If their intention is
to seek the ASSU Presidency,
this fact should also be made
public, so that not so subtle
"Thank You's" can be recognized
for the political publicity they in
fact are.

publicity is sought.
The payment for these
handbills indicates that publicity
was a consideration. Assurance
was given by Mr. Van Petten that
ASSU funds were not used, and
that he paid for the
advertisements. Thus assured, we
can at least be happy that this
personal publicity was not
generated with ASSU funds. But
since these handbills were
personally paid for by these two
gentlemen, the utilization of the
Grateful Dead concert for
political publicity must have been
deliberate, and must be
condemned.

Of course, should the
allegation of political use of the
concert be incorrect, an
announcement by Mr. Van Petten
and Mr. Shannon of their
intention not to run for office
would be in order. This will
ensure that the use of their names
on the handbill will not be

misconstrued. If their intention is
to seek the ASSU Presidency,
this fact should also be made
public, so that not so subtle
"Thank You's" can be recognized
for the political publicity they in
fact are.

The announcement of the
Grateful Dead concert scheduled
for February 9 is a cause for
satisfaction and elation by the
Stanford community.
Unfortunately, in conjunction
with this announcement, Stanford
has been subjected to an
incredible display of politics in
the form of a "Thank You"
handbill from Peter Van Petten
and Ron Shannon. Mr. Van Petten
(an ASSU co-President) and Mr.
Shannon (the Special Events
Director), in "thanking" us for
our co-operation in passing the
special events fee assessment and
of informing us of the upcoming
Grateful Dead concert, have
blatantly linked their names to
this popular concert. This linkage
is an apparent political move.
The very format of the
handbill points to the politics
involved. Placement of the names
of Mr. Van Petten and Mr.
Shannon at the top of the sheet,
in larger letters than the
subsequent listing of the Grateful
Dead, leave no doubt as to whom
the announcement is for:
certainly this is an unorthodox
and unusual method by which to
advertise the concert.
As Co-President and Special
Events Director, one assumes Mr.
Van Petten's and Mr. Shannon's
expected duties would include
providing entertainment for the

community. It would seem special
notice of their success need hardly
be made. Mention of these
achievements at times of
electioneering would be
understandable; they seem hardly
appropriate now.
Apparent Endorsement
The question of politics and
the Grateful Dead is especially
significant in light of a recent
statement by Scott Burke. Mr.
Burke, Van Petten's co-president,
indicated at a recent press
conference that he hoped Mr. Van
Petten would consider running
again. In the face of this apparent
endorsement, the use of Mr. Van
Petten's name on the handbill
becomes a sensitive political issue,
one wisely avoided unless
publicity is sought.
The payment for these
handbills indicates that publicity
was a consideration. Assurance
was given by Mr. Van Petten that
ASSU funds were not used, and
that he paid for the
advertisements. Thus assured, we
can at least be happy that this
