POWs To Return This Week
SAIGON — U.S. officials in Washington and Saigon
declared the first group of American prisoners will
be released this week, but declined to give a specific
time-table.
A U.S. military official said later that there
would be no prisoner releases Tuesday; he refused
to say more.
Officials said the order of release would be
American prisoners first, then Viet Cong followed
by South Vietnamese and North Vietnamese.
Any prisoners picked up in Hanoi will be flown
directly to Clark Air Force Base in the Philippines,
the officials said.
They added that only photographs of the
prisoners would be allowed and there would be no
interviews.
Ambassador Michel Gauvin of Canada, chairman
of the International Commission of Control and
Supervision said release of those held in South
Vietnam will be "closer to the end of the week."
Then four hours later he told newsmen the
release will come "within, I presume, a week or so."
"There will be an exchange of prisoners," Gauvin
added after a four-hour commission meeting. "I
don't know where or when."
Meanwhile, representatives of the four parties in
the Vietnam peace agreement met in three cities
yesterday in quickening diplomatic steps toward
clearing sea mines from North Vietnam, holding
top-level political talks on the South and getting
American war prisoners back home.
In Haiphong, Rear Adm. Brian McCauley and 15
members of his staff conferred with senior North
Vietnamese officials on clearing mines from North
Vietnam's seven ports and thousands of miles of
inland waterways. McCauley is the commander of
the Navy task force gathering in the Tonkin Gulf to
begin clearing the mines as specified in the
agreement.
In Paris, South Vietnamese and Viet Cong
delegates met face to face for the first time for
preliminary low-level procedural talks to set the
stage for high-level negotiations on the future
political shape of South Vietnam.
Corona Sentenced To Prison
FAIRFIELD — Juan Corona was sentenced to 25
consecutive life prison terms yesterday after a judge
denied him a new trial on charges of slaying 25
transient farm workers.
Defense attorney Richard Hawk had sought a
new trial for Corona on the basis of reports that
sheriffs matron Georgia Wallace told juror Naomi

Underwood she could tell her things about the
Mexican defendant that would "ease your
conscience" about voting for conviction.
Hawk based his request for a new trial on this
alleged statement. Judge Richard E. Patton rejected
the request.
Wallace denied yesterday that she had said
anything to sway the thinking of Underwood.
Patton also ordered Hawk arrested in the
courtroom to immediately start serving 54 days of a
total of 70 days of contempt of court citations
issued by the judge during the four-month trial.
Corona was convicted of the slaying of 25
drifters and itinerant farm laborers whose hacked
and slashed bodies were unearthed from orchard
graves along the Feather River 100 miles northeast
of San Francisco during May and June of 1971.
Dominican Republic Landing
SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic — A
government spokesman said a group of guerrillas
from Cuba landed yesterday on a beach 110 miles
west of this Caribbean capital and he accused
former President Juan Bosch of being "seriously
involved" in the operation.
Dominican sources said authorities raided
Bosch's home, but he was elsewhere at the time. It
was reported that Bosch, the government's chief
foe, had passed the word to his followers that he
was safe.
The former president was ousted from office in
1963 a few months after taking office.
The government spokesman said troops found a
yacht believed used by the guerrillas in the landing
in Azua Province. Maps, money, military equipment
and revolutionary literature were left behind in the
boat, he said.
The Dominican Republic shares the island of
Hispaniola with Haiti.
"The rest of the country remains absolutely
peaceful and the authorities are in full control of
the situation," the spokesman added.
Ellsberg Defense Motion Denied
LOS ANGELES — The judge in the Pentagon papers
trial refused yesterday to let the defense tell jurors
about the government's alleged "suppression of
evidence," but said he would consider allowing
additional defense remarks later.
U.S. District Court Judge Matt Byme said that at
the end of the government's case, he would
reconsider attorney Leonard Boudin's motion to
reopen his opening statement to jurors.
The seemingly unprecedented procedure of a

defense opening statement in the midst of the
government's case was first raised by Byrne on
Friday as a possible "sanction" against the
government for withholding until now documents
which could help prove Daniel Ellsberg and
Anthony Russo innocent.
But Byrne, who suggested the possibility when
he turned down a motion to throw out the
indictment, had mentioned Russo's attorneys, who
haven't spoken yet, not Boudin, who already
addressed jurors on Jan. 17.
Byrne stated, "I will, at the conclusion of the
government's case, re-entertain your motion as to
whether at that time you may make an additional
statement."
Air Security Measures Delayed
WASHINGTON — A federal judge yesterday
ordered a delay until Feb. 15 for new regulations
that would have required armed guards at airports.
A hearing has been set for Feb. 13 to determine
whether the order should be made permanent. The
court order, issued by Judge John Smith, in
Washington, D.C., came after the Federal Aviation
Administration refused to extend last night's
midnight deadline for compliance with new airport
security rules.
The Airport Operators Council International —
AOCI — representing 132 facilities, filed a motion
yesterday in U.S. District Court in Washington for a
temporary restraining order against the FAA.
An Associated Press survey showed that most
airports hired anywhere from one to several dozen
extra guards to meet the more stringent security
regulations. The first part of the plan, requiring
searches of all hand-carried luggage, took effect last
month.
Patient Receives New Heart
STANFORD — A 53-year-old California man has
become the 53rd heart transplant recipient at
Stanford University Hospital and was in satisfactory
condition yesterday, the hospital said.
The patient requested that his name not be
released.
Nineteen of Stanford's 53 heart transplant
recipients are surviving.
