# Chino Defendants Arraigned
## 
### 
Three persons facing federal charges stemming from the Oct. 6 guard
murder-prison escape of Chino inmate Ronald Wayne Beaty were arraigned
last week in Phoenix, Ariz.
Dr. Harry Bishara and his wife Laura, of Fort Defiance, Ariz., and
former Stanford law student Michael Goldstein, now working on a
federally-funded legal aid program, were charged with concealing an
escaped prisoner, concealing a person from arrest, misprision (aiding,
abetting, and concealing) a felon, and being accessories after the fact.
They were arraigned Jan. 22 before U.S. District Court Judge Richard
Gromley, and pleaded not guilty to all charges. No trial date has been set,
but U.S. District Court Judge Walter Craig has been designated to hear the
case.
