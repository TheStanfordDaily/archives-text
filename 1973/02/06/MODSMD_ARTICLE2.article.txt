# Medical Center Fears Program Cuts
## 
### STEPHEN CARTER 
Programs at the Stanford Medical
Center would be cut substantially
under President Nixon's proposed
budget, Medical Center officials fear.
According to Dean Clayton Rich,
the proposals could cost the Center an
eventual $3.4 million per year.
Training programs supported by
National Institute of Health grants
will apparently be phased out within
three years. This may leave the Center
unable to fulfill commitments to some
of its 271 pre- and post-doctoral
trainees.
In addition to training grants, the
budget calls for a 60 percent reduction
in general research grants and
elimination of regional medical
programs. The latter, according to
Medical Center officials, include
emergency care, with helicopter
transportation, for newborn infants; a
new community health center in Daly
City; and various community health
worker training programs.
Stanford's Regional Medical
Program (RMP), which provides these
services, covers an 11-county area. The
cuts would also affect such
RMP-funded programs as East Palo
Alto's Sickle Cell Anemia Foundation.
While awaiting official word from
Washington, Rich began a review of

other effects of the budget cuts on the
school, and froze all departmental
appointments until further notice. He
called the cutbacks "a reduction
between muscle and bone," rather
than "fat and muscle." The
departments of biochemistry, genetics,
medicine, microbiology, pediatrics,
pharmacology, psychiatry, and
radiology were expected to be hardest
hit.
Reactions among officials and
professors at the Medical School
seemed uniformly pessimistic.
Nobel Laureate geneticist Joshua
Lederberg termed the end of training
grants "catastrophic," and "obtuse,"
noting that "women are at a point of
finding their just parity," in medicine
and "many minority group students
have found their way through
undergraduate programs to qualify for
leadership in the sciences."
Psychiatry Prof. Seymour Levine
called the proposals "inhumane,"
adding that "there was no forethought
as to implications." He expressed the
fear that since most doctoral fellows
are supported by training grants, the
Medical School would undergo "a
return to the elite," with only the
wealthiest being able to afford it.
Levine also pointed out that if only
research grants remain available,

graduate students will lose much of
their freedom of choice, being
restricted by the nature of the grant.
Biochemistry Department
Chairman Paul Berg condemned the
cutbacks as "the virtual dismantling of
the foremost health sciences research
program in the world."
Berg, whose department does
extensive cancer research, explained,
"People have to realize that it isn't
that the trainees look over the
shoulder of the professors — they are
the ones doing the work. If there is no
money to support them, the research

— or at least a substantial part of it —
isn't going to be done."
Radiology Department Chairman
Malcolm Bagshaw admitted that the
government might be justified in
cutting some programs, but added,
"there are fields in which we don't
have enough trained physicians and
researchers." Pointing out that the
United States has only one-third of its
needed radiation therapists, Bagshaw
predicted, "the budget cuts will
probably force us to trim some
research programs and eliminate others
entirely."
