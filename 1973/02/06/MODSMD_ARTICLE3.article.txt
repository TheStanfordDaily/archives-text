# PA Petitioners Request Bach Mai Fund Vote
## 
### ROBERT BACON 
Initiative petitions were filed
yesterday afternoon to place before
Palo Alto voters the question of giving
$50,000 in city funds to help rebuild
Bach Mai Hospital in North Vietnam.
Although the petitions appear to
contain sufficient signatures to qualify
the question, City Attorney Peter
Stone will probably recommend that it
not be placed on the May 8 Municipal
ballot.
Shortly before the 5 p.m. deadline
yesterday, a group headed by Douglas
Mattern of the Palo Alto Peace Union
and Jeffrey Youdelman of
Venceremos gave City Clerk Ann
Tanner petitions that they claimed
contained 2300 names. Tanner
confirmed that the petitions contained
"more than 1700" signatures.
To qualify the measure for the
ballot, the petition must contain the
names of at least 1646 duly registered
Palo Alto voters. The County Registrar
of Voters' office in San Jose will verify
the petitions to determine whether
this requirement has been met. Tanner
expects their report by the end of this
week.
Stone said yesterday afternoon
that, even if the petitions are found to
contain sufficient names, the City
Council has the prerogative to refuse
to place the measure on the ballot "if
there is doubt as to its legality."
He said he would render a
recommendation on the question only
if the petitions are found sufficient,
but he repeatedly said any gift of
public funds to Bach Mai would be
"patently illegal."

Stone left little doubt that he
would recommend that the issue not
be placed before the voters.
Peace groups began the petition
drive after the Council on Jan. 8 and
22 declined to even consider a gift of
tax funds to Bach Mai. The Council
passed a resolution urging private
donations, but unanimously accepted
Stone's opinion that funds from the
public coffers could not be sent to
North Vietnam.
Stone pointed out yesterday that if
the measure is patently invalid, even
paying the expenses of an election on
it would be an improper use of public
funds.
Youdelman, as he handed the sheaf
of petitions to Tanner, threatened "to
take Pete Stone to court if he won't
let it go on the ballot."
Mattern accused Stone and Mayor
Kirke Comstock of "tampering with
the most fundamental rights of a
democracy." Comstock has said he
will stand by Stone's opinion even if
the attorney urges that the measure
not be placed on the ballot.
Mattern suggested that Comstock
and other council members up for
re-election did not want to have to
take a position on the Bach Mai
question during the forthcoming
campaign; hence, he said, they are
intent on keeping the issue off the
ballot.

ballot.
Shortly before the 5 p.m. deadline
yesterday, a group headed by Douglas
Mattern of the Palo Alto Peace Union
and Jeffrey Youdelman of
Venceremos gave City Clerk Ann
Tanner petitions that they claimed
contained 2300 names. Tanner
confirmed that the petitions contained
"more than 1700" signatures.
To qualify the measure for the
ballot, the petition must contain the
names of at least 1646 duly registered
Palo Alto voters. The County Registrar
of Voters' office in San Jose will verify
the petitions to determine whether
this requirement has been met. Tanner
expects their report by the end of this
week.
Stone said yesterday afternoon
that, even if the petitions are found to
contain sufficient names, the City
Council has the prerogative to refuse
to place the measure on the ballot "if
there is doubt as to its legality."
He said he would render a
recommendation on the question only
if the petitions are found sufficient,
but he repeatedly said any gift of
public funds to Bach Mai would be
"patently illegal."

Stone left little doubt that he
would recommend that the issue not
be placed before the voters.
Peace groups began the petition
drive after the Council on Jan. 8 and
22 declined to even consider a gift of
tax funds to Bach Mai. The Council
passed a resolution urging private
donations, but unanimously accepted
Stone's opinion that funds from the
public coffers could not be sent to
North Vietnam.
Stone pointed out yesterday that if
the measure is patently invalid, even
paying the expenses of an election on
it would be an improper use of public
funds.
Youdelman, as he handed the sheaf
of petitions to Tanner, threatened "to
take Pete Stone to court if he won't
let it go on the ballot."
Mattern accused Stone and Mayor
Kirke Comstock of "tampering with
the most fundamental rights of a
democracy." Comstock has said he
will stand by Stone's opinion even if
the attorney urges that the measure
not be placed on the ballot.
Mattern suggested that Comstock
and other council members up for
re-election did not want to have to
take a position on the Bach Mai
question during the forthcoming
campaign; hence, he said, they are
intent on keeping the issue off the
ballot.
Initiative petitions were filed
yesterday afternoon to place before
Palo Alto voters the question of giving
$50,000 in city funds to help rebuild
Bach Mai Hospital in North Vietnam.
Although the petitions appear to
contain sufficient signatures to qualify
the question, City Attorney Peter
Stone will probably recommend that it
not be placed on the May 8 Municipal
ballot.
