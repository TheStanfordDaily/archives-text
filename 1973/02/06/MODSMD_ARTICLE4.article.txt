# Budget Cut Threaten 80 Jobs
## SLAC Employees Protest Forced Lay-Off 
### CHRISTY WISE 
At least 80 Stanford Linear Accelerator Center
(SLAC) employees are protesting an announcement
by SLAC Director Wolfgang Panofsky that an
impending federal budget cut and inflation will
necessitate the involuntary lay-off of 80 employees,
effective June 30.
Representatives at SLAC of United Stanford
Employees (USE) term the lay-off "unnecessary and
unresponsive to SLAC's real problems."
USE feels the problem is one of internal salary
management rather than an effect of the national
budget economy.
In a memo to "all hands" at SLAC, Panofsky
said that President Nixon's budget for fiscal year
1974 proposes $24.2 million for SLAC. This is a
reduction of $750,000 from the present spending
level, which was reduced last fall when the Atomic
Energy Commission impounded $500,000
previously appropriated by Congress.
Panofsky said, "Using experience of the past, we
conclude that inflation next year will take an
additional $1.75 million out of SLAC's program.
This totals to an equivalent of about $2.5 million by
which SLAC's purchasing power will suffer next
year â€” roughly 10 percent."
Lay-Off Anticipated
USE spokesman Jack Truher said employees
anticipated the possibility of lay-off problems a year
ago and have since been trying to find a way to
become involved in determining the alternatives.
According to Panofsky's assistant, Douglas
Dupen, government projections over the past ten
years have shown SLAC eventually getting more
money. Dupen said there was no indication that
SLAC should begin attrition until November, 1972

when it was discovered the projections weren't
accurate. "We started our hiring freeze then,"' said
Dupen.
Truher feels the lab should be committed to a
comprehensive plan for attrition management. He
added, "It is a reflection on management," that this
attrition program has not been done. "It comes
down to being a clear case of conflict between those
who have influence at the lab and those that don't,"
said Truher.
Normal Attrition
USE suggests normal attrition, which runs about
10 percent a year or about 130 people, combined
with a total hiring freeze, will eliminate the need for
lay-offs.
USE also suggests that hiring of new employees
and restructuring of current personnel first include
hiring within SLAC.
In response to the recommendation that normal
attrition be used instead of lay-offs, Dupen stated,
"We don't know if that rate will continue and we
don't like to gamble. What if those people don't
quit? How do we pay their salaries for the last three
months?"
Specialized Jobs
Dupen also explained that assuming 10 percent
do quit, many of them will have to be replaced
because of their specialized jobs. Dupen did not see
this as a problem if the employees were
restructured.
Dupen further explained that in addition to the
need to have "140 fewer human beings working at
SLAC by the end of the next 17 months," there is a
need to save 140 man-years of salary. This has to be
done by the beginning of the 1973 fiscal year in
July.

Panofsky himself refused to comment on USE's
recommendations.
Morale Problem
Truher predicts the lay-off will destroy the
morale of the lab and create distrust between
workers and management. He feels the "pain of
decision" does not affect higher paid staff. Truher
stated, "We want an atmosphere with a sense of
common objectives and goals," adding he desires
mutual concern by all employees for one another.
"If people are solely in it for the money and
don't want to share the burden, direct them
elsewhere," said Truher.
The lay-off procedure will begin with an
identification of those program areas whose loss or
reduction will damage SLAC's research productivity
least. "In those areas, we will lay people off," said
Dupen.
He feels SLAC will lose many valuable workers if
salaries are cut, instead of laying-off less vital
workers. He added that in many areas salaries are
"not up to market as it is."
'Working Decision'
Dupen explained the lay-off plan is "a working
decision. There is plenty of time to look at other
plans and indeed we are." Dupen said, "Everyone
who is laid-off will know by March 1." He doesn't
think employees will have difficulty finding new
jobs because "the hiring market on the peninsula is
good now."
Current USE action includes "convincing people
of the reality that other options exist," said Truher.
USE intends to protest individual lay-offs in
hardship cases and lay-offs resulting from "biases,"
and does not rule out the possibility of legal action
in some cases.
