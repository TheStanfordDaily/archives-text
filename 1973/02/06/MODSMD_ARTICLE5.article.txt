# Vietnam Truce Leaves Anti-War Movement In Limbo
## 
### DAN BRENNER 
One legacy of the Vietnam war is
the Movement, the broad-based ad hoc
coalition of liberals and radicals who
led the campus anti-war movement.
Various segments of the Movement
organized the sit-ins, teach-ins,
take-overs, and blockades which
characterized "campus protest,"
during the last eight years.
With the ceasefire last month,
military involvement in Vietnam has
receded as the burning national issue.
And just as the war spawned protest,
so its dissolution leaves the future of
campus protest in doubt.
For seven years, Religion Prof.
Robert McAfee Brown has been
involved in the antiwar movement. Up
to three weeks ago, he traveled with a
team of American religious leaders in

an attempt to urge European clergy to
more vigorously protest the war in
their own countries.
"A lot of us thought Vietnam was
an isolated problem. Once it was taken
care of, we expected to go back to
business as usual," says Brown. "But
Vietnam has come to be seen as an
extension of a policy that is applied all
over."
New Issues
While Brown is not sure in what
form protest will continue, he believes
that amnesty, right of dissent, and the
executive-legislative balance of power
will be significant issues for action.
"Thousands are going to have their
lives ruined unless the President shifts
his position on amnesty," he
predicted. "This is an immediate
issue."
Brown believes pressure still needs
to be applied to corporations like
Honeywell to end the production of
anti-personnel bombs. "We have to
find ways to end the willingness of
corporations to engage in making
bombs merely designed to destroy
people," he said.
Issue Remains
And while locations have changed,
the fundamental issue of American
involvement in the Third World
remains, according to Brown. "We
can't afford to let an issue like this
disappear."
Lenny Siegel, a member of the
Pacific Studies Center and former
student, has been a mainstay of the
protest movement at Stanford. "It's a

mistake," said Siegel, "to think that
radicalism will disappear. But there
will be less sensation in it."
Siegel points to a generation gap in
explaining why there will be less
vitriolic protest in the future. Many of
the original protesters adopted

revolutionary attitudes, and "have
little to share with people who didn't
experience that."
No ROTC Return
He bolieves people will object to
bringing back ROTC. But Siegel
predicts fewer efforts to stop

war-industry recruiting at the
Placement Center. Instead he feels that
more emphasis will be placed on
stressing non-military career options to
center users.
Campus action will more likely

WHITHER THE MOVEMENT? — The recently negotiated Vietnam cease-fire casts the future of "The Movement" into
doubt. Santa Clara County Sheriff's deputies may never again clear anti-war protesters from the steps of Dinkelspiel
Auditorium, as they did April 21 last year.
revolve around local issues like student
and faculty discipline, university
governance, and "campus democracy,"
predicts Siegel. Stanford investments
like the Shopping Center and
University land will also be areas for
activity.
In contrast, Biology graduate
student Ray White, who heads the
conservative Free Campus Movement
(FCM), which opposes any
politicization of the campus, believes

that protest has been silent for at least
a year.
"People are coming to conclude
that it's more important to live your
own life than trying to change other
people's priorities," he stated. "The
majority of people decided things
weren't changing very much and they
had other things more important to
do."
