# Beer And Laisses-Faire
## Rugged Consumerism 
### 
: Chris Hocker

My fantasy-column of last
week, "Ripping Off the People,"
provoked far more response than
usual, both verbal and written.
Someone even went so far as to
march into the Daily office and
demand that I be barred from
writing further columns, on the
grounds of "incompetence," thus
adding an entire new dimension to
the meaning of that word, since
what he really meant was that I
didn't think the way he did.
Anyway, I thought it would be
worthwhile to pursue what I was
trying to say last week, which
was, briefly: Every great once in a
while, I become extremely
annoyed with people who insist
on bludgeoning other people to
death with their social
consciences. And one of the most
virulent strains of such aggression
comes in the form of the
self-appointed consumerist who
proclaims loudly that, "We don't
buy such-and-such a product
because (a) it is racist, (b) it
mistreats its workers, (c) it helps
the war effort, (d) it trades with
South Africa, (e) it's just generally
a pig company, (112) all of the
above."
This is not to say that such a
crusader does not have the right
to make these statements; it's just
that there are times that I'd rather
not hear them.
The Infallible 'We'
And I don't think that means
that I am "refusing to face
reality," as one of last week's
letter-writers claimed in an
elaborate psychoanalysis of me
(he has never met me). What it
means is that, just because
someone tells me not to buy a
certain product for whatever
reason, I don't understand why I
should necessarily do what he
says, especially when his basic
justification boils down to "We
don't do that"—the almighty,
collective, unarguable, infallible
We.
Granted, there are often good
reasons for boycotting or

exercising similar economic
sanctions toward certain
companies. They may not be good
reasons for me, but for some
they're excellent. For instance, I
know of some people who to this
day will not buy Anheuser-Busch
products because August Busch
publicly proclaimed his
opposition to Goldwater in 1964.
I'm not making that up either.
Now, that bit of knowledge is
probably enough to start most of
you taking baths in a tub full of
Budweiser for the next three
months. But you'd probably feel
rather strange if you were
magically transported to a
community of rabid Goldwater
supporters who, upon seeing you
with Bud in hand, descended
upon you and proclaimed you an
enemy of the people and one
notch lower than a leper in their
esteem.
Seeing the Light
The point here is that the
individual decision to apply or not
apply an economic sanction on a
particular company is just
that—individual, and almost
always totally subjective. It is at
this point that one runs into the
"No Man Is An I&'and" argument,
which runs something like: Each
individual has a responsibility not
only to himself but also to all
mankind and, thus, when he sees
an injustice being done in the
world, it is his duty to try to
correct it.
This sounds great until you
realize that every aggressive war in
history was justified on exactly
that basis, i.e., someone deciding
that it was his duty to make
someone else see the light. The
logical extension of the "No Man
Is An Island" argument is an
eternal pitched battle among
opposing forces, with "moral"
victories being won on the basis of
who has the biggest gang and the
strongest weapons.
Now, of course, I know of no
one who has been physically

pi'evented from entering a
Safeway and buying a head of
lettuce. But I find it at least ironic
th at those same people who
bemoan the "social pressure" that
they run up against when they go
outside the shelter of a university
community are often the same
ones who apply it the strongest
within the looking-glass enclave of
Stanford University.
In short, I'm advocating a kind
of social laissez-faire policy, by
which all forms of debate would
flourish but hysteria would be
minimized. But I won't hold my
breath waiting for that policy to
be instituted.

what he really meant was that I
didn't think the way he did.
Anyway, I thought it would be
worthwhile to pursue what I was
trying to say last week, which
was, briefly: Every great once in a
while, I become extremely
annoyed with people who insist
on bludgeoning other people to
death with their social
consciences. And one of the most
virulent strains of such aggression
comes in the form of the
self-appointed consumerist who
proclaims loudly that, "We don't
buy such-and-such a product
because (a) it is racist, (b) it
mistreats its workers, (c) it helps
the war effort, (d) it trades with
South Africa, (e) it's just generally
a pig company, (112) all of the
above."
This is not to say that such a
crusader does not have the right
to make these statements; it's just
that there are times that I'd rather
not hear them.
The Infallible 'We'
And I don't think that means
that I am "refusing to face
reality," as one of last week's
letter-writers claimed in an
elaborate psychoanalysis of me
(he has never met me). What it
means is that, just because
someone tells me not to buy a
certain product for whatever
reason, I don't understand why I
should necessarily do what he
says, especially when his basic
justification boils down to "We
don't do that"—the almighty,
collective, unarguable, infallible
We.
Granted, there are often good
reasons for boycotting or

exercising similar economic
sanctions toward certain
companies. They may not be good
reasons for me, but for some
they're excellent. For instance, I
know of some people who to this
day will not buy Anheuser-Busch
products because August Busch
publicly proclaimed his
opposition to Goldwater in 1964.
I'm not making that up either.
Now, that bit of knowledge is
probably enough to start most of
you taking baths in a tub full of
Budweiser for the next three
months. But you'd probably feel
rather strange if you were
magically transported to a
community of rabid Goldwater
supporters who, upon seeing you
with Bud in hand, descended
upon you and proclaimed you an
enemy of the people and one
notch lower than a leper in their
esteem.
Seeing the Light
The point here is that the
individual decision to apply or not
apply an economic sanction on a
particular company is just
that—individual, and almost
always totally subjective. It is at
this point that one runs into the
"No Man Is An I&'and" argument,
which runs something like: Each
individual has a responsibility not
only to himself but also to all
mankind and, thus, when he sees
an injustice being done in the
world, it is his duty to try to
correct it.
This sounds great until you
realize that every aggressive war in
history was justified on exactly
that basis, i.e., someone deciding
that it was his duty to make
someone else see the light. The
logical extension of the "No Man
Is An Island" argument is an
eternal pitched battle among
opposing forces, with "moral"
victories being won on the basis of
who has the biggest gang and the
strongest weapons.
Now, of course, I know of no
one who has been physically

pi'evented from entering a
Safeway and buying a head of
lettuce. But I find it at least ironic
th at those same people who
bemoan the "social pressure" that
they run up against when they go
outside the shelter of a university
community are often the same
ones who apply it the strongest
within the looking-glass enclave of
Stanford University.
In short, I'm advocating a kind
of social laissez-faire policy, by
which all forms of debate would
flourish but hysteria would be
minimized. But I won't hold my
breath waiting for that policy to
be instituted.

My fantasy-column of last

provoked far more response than
usual, both verbal and written.
Someone even went so far as to
march into the Daily office and

adding an entire new dimension to
the meaning of that word, since
