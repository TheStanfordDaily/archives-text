# 'A Deep Freeze Of Indifference'
## Is All Passion Spent? 
### 
Larry Diamond

When I see how much this
campus has changed in its politics
since I first came here I shake my
head. I can't believe it; don't want
to believe it. But it seems
inescapably clear that this student
body does not have the passionate
commitment to moral principles
that moved it even as little as
three years ago.
We are numbed by the
experience of a decade of war,
and now so distant from it all.
The draft has been removed from
most of us for two years, and with
it the threat of imminent death.
So we do not bum with anger
any more. We congeal into a very
deep freeze of indifference that
stills every cause we have been
fighting for.
Into Ice
The cause that is going fastest
into ice is the movement against
this war, and the draft system that
made it possible. When I was a
freshman we applauded and
admired our peers who refused to
participate in this immoral
adventure. Whether they chose jail
or the equally painful alternative
of exile, they were the heroes of a

cruelly absurd tragedy. And many
of us came to realize that we
might someday have to join them.
These young men who went to
jail or fled their homeland had to
break with their lives, leave
behind families and lovers and
hopes, in order not to have to kill
innocent people and destroy a
beautiful land.
They were called criminals and
cowards by most Americans, weak
men seeking a cheap way out. But
in the church and university
communities the true nature ol'
the war had been clearly enough
perceived so that these men could
be sustained and supported for
their acts of bravery and
conscience.
Obscene Logic
And now we, not only the
country but the University
community (or at least that large
segment of it that the Daily
speaks for), now we say to these
men in exile, yes you can come
back, but you owe your nation
two years of service.
It is a logic that is so twisted it
is obscene.

I hope that everyone who left
this country because of the
Vietnam war will want to do a
lifetime of service to change the
country and make it better. But
to force them to do it, or
prescribe how they should do it,
not only smacks of all the
anti-libertarian implications of the
draft, it also tells them that what
they did was wrong.
Conscience
The Daily argued with clarity
and passion against the war and
the recent terror bombings. It has
again taken a leading and
praiseworthy position on the
draft. It has been fair and right to
point out that a number of men
left the country for pretty base
and, at best, amoral reasons.
And it has realized, I suppose,
that to propose that these selfish
men could be effectively
distinguished by human judges
from those who acted out of high
motive would be below its
intelligence.
But to propose that the
"people who stood up against the
immorality of our involvement in
Vietnam" should now be required
to give the nation two years of
service is beneath the sense of
conscience and outrage it always
ha d on this issue. It is beneath the
moral stance the Daily once had
the courage to stand by.
Insensitivity
It is depressing to see this kind
of insensitivity in the Daily,
because those young men who can
come home now only as criminals
are likely to get the impression (at
least partially true) that they have
been deserted by their own
movement.
I hope that they somehow are
informed that there are still a
good number of us in this country
who will not stop fighting until
this nation asks them back
unconditionally, without
recriminations, without
prejudices, without any
prescriptions except that they
continue to speak and act their
consciences on behalf of human
life.

it the threat of imminent death.
So we do not bum with anger
any more. We congeal into a very
deep freeze of indifference that
stills every cause we have been
fighting for.
Into Ice
The cause that is going fastest
into ice is the movement against
this war, and the draft system that
made it possible. When I was a
freshman we applauded and
admired our peers who refused to
participate in this immoral
adventure. Whether they chose jail
or the equally painful alternative
of exile, they were the heroes of a

cruelly absurd tragedy. And many
of us came to realize that we
might someday have to join them.
These young men who went to
jail or fled their homeland had to
break with their lives, leave
behind families and lovers and
hopes, in order not to have to kill
innocent people and destroy a
beautiful land.
They were called criminals and
cowards by most Americans, weak
men seeking a cheap way out. But
in the church and university
communities the true nature ol'
the war had been clearly enough
perceived so that these men could
be sustained and supported for
their acts of bravery and
conscience.
Obscene Logic
And now we, not only the
country but the University
community (or at least that large
segment of it that the Daily
speaks for), now we say to these
men in exile, yes you can come
back, but you owe your nation
two years of service.
It is a logic that is so twisted it
is obscene.

I hope that everyone who left
this country because of the
Vietnam war will want to do a
lifetime of service to change the
country and make it better. But
to force them to do it, or
prescribe how they should do it,
not only smacks of all the
anti-libertarian implications of the
draft, it also tells them that what
they did was wrong.
Conscience
The Daily argued with clarity
and passion against the war and
the recent terror bombings. It has
again taken a leading and
praiseworthy position on the
draft. It has been fair and right to
point out that a number of men
left the country for pretty base
and, at best, amoral reasons.
And it has realized, I suppose,
that to propose that these selfish
men could be effectively
distinguished by human judges
from those who acted out of high
motive would be below its
intelligence.
But to propose that the
"people who stood up against the
immorality of our involvement in
Vietnam" should now be required
to give the nation two years of
service is beneath the sense of
conscience and outrage it always
ha d on this issue. It is beneath the
moral stance the Daily once had
the courage to stand by.
Insensitivity
It is depressing to see this kind
of insensitivity in the Daily,
because those young men who can
come home now only as criminals
are likely to get the impression (at
least partially true) that they have
been deserted by their own
movement.
I hope that they somehow are
informed that there are still a
good number of us in this country
who will not stop fighting until
this nation asks them back
unconditionally, without
recriminations, without
prejudices, without any
prescriptions except that they
continue to speak and act their
consciences on behalf of human
life.

When I see how much this
campus has changed in its politics
since I first came here I shake my
head. I can't believe it; don't want
to believe it. But it seems
inescapably clear that this student
body does not have the passionate
commitment to moral principles
that moved it even as little as
three years ago.
We are numbed by the
experience of a decade of war,
and now so distant from it all.
The draft has been removed from
most of us for two years, and with
it the threat of imminent death.
