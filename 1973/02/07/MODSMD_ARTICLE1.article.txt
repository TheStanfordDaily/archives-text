# Nations To Discuss Lasting Peace; Kissinger To Seek Laotian Truce
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - As Henry
Kissinger's postwar travels took on an
added dimension, the United States
and North Vietnam announced
yesterday that a major international
conference to guarantee the Vietnam
peace would open in Paris Feb. 26.
A few hours after the joint
announcement of the conference date
and site, the White House disclosed
that Kissinger would stop in Laos
Friday to check on prospects for a
Laotian cease-fire before heading to
Hanoi Saturday for four days of talks.
Kissinger, the presidential assistant
who was the chief U.S. negotiator of
the Vietnam peace agreement signed
Jan. 27, departs Andrews Air Force
Base, Md., at 10 a.m. EST, Wednesday.
He will go first to Bangkok to confer
with Thai officials and with U.S.
ambassadors from South Vietnam,
Cambodia and Laos.
Then he will head on to Vientiane
for talks with Laotian officials, then to
Hanoi and afterwards to Peking for
five days of consultations with Chinese
leaders.
When Kissinger's Hanoi mission was
announced last week, Nixon said the
purpose of the trip was to open direct
communication with top North
Vietnamese officials, to discuss
postwar relationships and to initiate
negotiations for North Vietnam's share
of the Indochina-wide reconstruction
program.
The day after Kissinger initialed the

Vietnam agreement, he told a news
conference he expected the cease-fire
in South Vietnam to spread soon to
Laos and later to Cambodia.
U.S. planes are continuing to strike
at Communist positions and supply
lines in Laos and White House press
secretary Ronald L. Ziegler indicated
this bombardment would continue
until a Laotian cease-fire begins.
The simultaneous announcement
made yesterday at the White House
and in Hanoi said the United States
and North Vietnam "have agreed to
propose Paris as the site"for the
conference beginning on Monday, Feb.
26. South Vietnam said the date and
site were acceptable to it.
A communique from the South
Vietnamese Foreign Ministry said
South Vietnam previously had been
reluctant to accept Paris because of
demonstrations at the peace-signing
ceremony Jan. 27.
The State Department said that one
purpose of the conference is to allow
nations not directly involved in the
war "to associate themselves directly
with the agreement" that ended the
fighting.
Press officer Charles Bray did not
list those nations specifically. But
Kissinger said two weeks ago that
outcome of peace in Vietnam depends
largely on the cooperation of the
Soviet Union and China.
In addition to the three major
powers, the conference is to be

attended by the four nations involved
in the International Control
Commission — Canada, Indonesia,
Poland and Hungary — as well as
France, Great Britain, both Vietnams
and the Viet Cong. U.N. Secretary
Gen. Kurt Waldheim also will
participate.
Bray said details for the conference
are incomplete but that consultations
are under way to settle as many of the
issues as possible before the opening
date.
The Vietnam accord had specified
that the international conference
would be convened within 30 days "to
contribute to and guarantee peace in
Indochina."

On the battlefields, an international
cease-fire team was prevented from
getting into Quang Tri City in the far
north by an artillery duel on its first
day in the field.
The official North Vietnamese news
agency reported that U.S. military
officials in Haiphong met for the first
time with North Vietnamese military
representatives Monday to discuss
sweeping U.S. mines from North
Vietnamese waters.
Four U.S. Navy minesweepers were
ordered yesterday to begin clearing an
anchorage 35 miles off Haiphong to
serve as a base of operations to clear
out the mines as the United States
pledged in the Paris cease-fire accord.

fighting.
Press officer Charles Bray did not
list those nations specifically. But
Kissinger said two weeks ago that
outcome of peace in Vietnam depends
largely on the cooperation of the
Soviet Union and China.
In addition to the three major
powers, the conference is to be

attended by the four nations involved
in the International Control
Commission — Canada, Indonesia,
Poland and Hungary — as well as
France, Great Britain, both Vietnams
and the Viet Cong. U.N. Secretary
Gen. Kurt Waldheim also will
participate.
Bray said details for the conference
are incomplete but that consultations
are under way to settle as many of the
issues as possible before the opening
date.
The Vietnam accord had specified
that the international conference
would be convened within 30 days "to
contribute to and guarantee peace in
Indochina."

On the battlefields, an international
cease-fire team was prevented from
getting into Quang Tri City in the far
north by an artillery duel on its first
day in the field.
The official North Vietnamese news
agency reported that U.S. military
officials in Haiphong met for the first
time with North Vietnamese military
representatives Monday to discuss
sweeping U.S. mines from North
Vietnamese waters.
Four U.S. Navy minesweepers were
ordered yesterday to begin clearing an
anchorage 35 miles off Haiphong to
serve as a base of operations to clear
out the mines as the United States
pledged in the Paris cease-fire accord.
WASHINGTON (AP) - As Henry
Kissinger's postwar travels took on an
added dimension, the United States
and North Vietnam announced
yesterday that a major international
conference to guarantee the Vietnam
peace would open in Paris Feb. 26.
A few hours after the joint
announcement of the conference date
and site, the White House disclosed
that Kissinger would stop in Laos
Friday to check on prospects for a
Laotian cease-fire before heading to
Hanoi Saturday for four days of talks.
Kissinger, the presidential assistant
who was the chief U.S. negotiator of
the Vietnam peace agreement signed
Jan. 27, departs Andrews Air Force
Base, Md., at 10 a.m. EST, Wednesday.
He will go first to Bangkok to confer
with Thai officials and with U.S.
ambassadors from South Vietnam,
Cambodia and Laos.
Then he will head on to Vientiane
for talks with Laotian officials, then to
Hanoi and afterwards to Peking for
five days of consultations with Chinese
leaders.
When Kissinger's Hanoi mission was
announced last week, Nixon said the
purpose of the trip was to open direct
communication with top North
Vietnamese officials, to discuss
postwar relationships and to initiate
negotiations for North Vietnam's share
of the Indochina-wide reconstruction
program.
The day after Kissinger initialed the

Vietnam agreement, he told a news
conference he expected the cease-fire
in South Vietnam to spread soon to
Laos and later to Cambodia.
U.S. planes are continuing to strike
at Communist positions and supply
lines in Laos and White House press
secretary Ronald L. Ziegler indicated
this bombardment would continue
until a Laotian cease-fire begins.
The simultaneous announcement
made yesterday at the White House
and in Hanoi said the United States
and North Vietnam "have agreed to
propose Paris as the site"for the
conference beginning on Monday, Feb.
26. South Vietnam said the date and
site were acceptable to it.
A communique from the South
Vietnamese Foreign Ministry said
South Vietnam previously had been
reluctant to accept Paris because of
demonstrations at the peace-signing
ceremony Jan. 27.
The State Department said that one
purpose of the conference is to allow
nations not directly involved in the
war "to associate themselves directly
with the agreement" that ended the
fighting.

list those nations specifically. But
Kissinger said two weeks ago that
outcome of peace in Vietnam depends
