# A 						Possible Alternative
## Macalester College's Judiciary 
### 
As almost everyone knows,
Stanford has been torn by a
judicial crisis for the past several
years. Students rejected a
proposed judicial system in the
fall of this year, and the
Committee of Fifteen is now
beginning to deliberate on a new
proposal.
In the interim, I would like to
explore a judicial system currently
functioning at Macalester College
in St. Paul, Minnesota, copies of
which I have sent to the members
of the C-15. While it is, of course,
true that a University is not a
college and adjustments for this
will need to be made, one can still
assume that justice in St. Paul
ought not be that much different
than that in Palo Alto.
The judicial system at
Macalester is outlined in a booklet
entitled "Student Rights,
Freedoms, and Responsibilities at

Macalester College." Of particular
note are 1) the composition of the
judiciary, 2) the rights guaranteed
defendants, and 3) the method of
amendment. All three of these
points are currently contested
issues in the debate at Stanford
over a fair student judicial system.
Judicial Council
The Macalester Student
Judicial Council, which has
jurisdiction over the activities of
students on campus, consists of all
students, elected one each from the
black, white, Chicano, and
American Indian cultural
constituencies. A defendant's case
may be heard before this Council
or, by request of the accused,
before a jury consisting of five
students, chosen at random from
the student body. There are no
faculty or administration
members on either body. At
Macalester, at least, the
constitutional principle of trial by
peers is taken seriously.
Beyond the issue of
composition of judiciary is the
question of student rights, for
even an all student judicial system
with inadequate safeguards could
be threatening to campus
freedom. At Macalester, students
have the right to 1) protection
against self-incrimination, 2) be
considered innocent until proven
guilty beyond a reasonable doubt,
3) disqualify any one member of
the judicial council or, if the
defendant chooses a jury trial, up
to twenty prospective jurors, by
preemptory challenge, and 4) be
assured that no record of the case
is placed on his permanent
transcript.
Regardless of the composition
and the ennumeration of rights,
even the most perfect document
may need change. At Macalester,
the method of amendment is
straightforward: an amendment
needs the approval of a majority
of students voting in an election.

Period. There is no provision for
veto on the part of the
administration or the faculty.
Students simply govern their own
conduct.
Candor Insufficient
Why is it that Stanford has not
adopted such a judicial system? An
explanation is needed, I think,
from those who would oppose for
Stanford what has worked at
Macalester. Part of the "answer"
may have been expressed by Mr.
Kaplan, who in the Faculty
Senate last fall declared "students
can't be trusted to decide political
cases."
Though I admire Mr. Kaplan's
frankness, his explanation is not
sufficient. Why is it that students
at Macalester can be trusted, but
not Stanford students? What is it
that makes political cases at
Stanford so difficult that students
cannot decide? Does the difficulty
arise because of Stanford's

students, or because of the
character of Stanford as an
institution?
If it is because Stanford
students can't be trusted that they
are denied control of their own
judicial system, ought this fact
not appear in bold type on every
piece of literature sent to
prospective applicants? If student
judicial cases involve issues of
broad community concern that
demand faculty participation on
the judicial panel why is it that
students are denied participation
in faculty discipline cases that
would involve the same kind of
community interest?
And what of student rights?
Ought they not, regardless of the
character of the students or the
institution, be commensurate with
those guaranteed by the U.S.
Constitution?
