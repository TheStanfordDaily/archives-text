## Barenboim Misses Mark 
### KITTY PATTERSON 
A very fine line separates a good performer from
a great one. Many musicians never cross it. Although
they develop virtuoso skill and show adequate
understanding of a composition, they fall short of
the mark.
Daniel Barenboim is just such a performer. In his
concert last Tuesday at the Opera House, he often
played well, sometimes exceptionally, but never
brilliantly.
Perhaps one event flustered him so much that his
performance afterwards didn't reach even his usual
calibre. In the last movement of the first selection,
Beethoven's Sonata in D Major, op. 10 no. 3, one of
the top strings in the piano broke. The ensuing
twang every time he hit a high note forced
Barenboim to get up and leave, while a piano tuner
came out to repair the string.
Even this mishap, however, cannot account for
the generally lackluster performance Barenboim
turned in. Occasionally, in melodic or scale passages,
Barenboim displayed mature interpretation or clever
technique, but the overall impression left this
reviewer cold.
Exemplary Selection
The first selection exemplified the entire
program. Barenboim displayed excellent technique,
especially in rapid right hand scale passages. In the
fourth, interrupted movement, he executed an
accurate tempestuous octave sequence in the right
hand followed by clear, showy arpeggios.
His interpretation left too much unsaid, Many of
his contrasts and subitos sounded weak. When he
used the proper dynamic patterns, they sounded too
programmed. He accented appogiaturas on the
wrong notes, and either over-rubatoed or didn't
rubato enough.
His performance of the second offering,
Beethoven's Sonata in A flat Major, op. 110,
confirmed my doubts. Barenboim played the
opening arpeggios with an excellent feathery' touch.
He used just enough pedal. In the middle of the
fourth movement, during a section echoing the
fugue subject stated in the beginning, he ably
synchronized the subject in both hands, although he
seemed to concentrate so much on those notes that
he stabbed at the crossed-over high notes.
Uneven Timing
He couldn't, however, maintain the proper style.
He timed the two against three passages in the
second movement unevenly and added too much
pedal to cover up the syncopation mistakes. In the
fourth movement, his right hand ran away with the
tempo that his left hand, playing the fugue subject,

was trying to keep.
Throughout the piece, he gave too much weight
to his left hand and often overpowered the right.
Despite the heavy bass, Barenboim underplayed
most of the left hand dynamics, especially the
crescendos in the ascending passages.
He never really arrived at a climax to a phrase.
He played coldly, more as if he were practicing a
finger exercise then performing a sonata requiring a
greater scope of interpretation.
Interpretation Needs Work
Barenboim finished the program with
Beethoven's Sonata in C Major, op. 53
("Waldstein"). Rumor has it that an excellent sight
reader can play all the notes well the first time he
sees this sonata. It is the interpretation that needs
hard work.
Barenboim performed some exemplary technical
feats, especially in the first movement. His opening
runs were clear and precise. His staccatos had just
enough abruptness. He synchronized two-handed
runs with consummate skill.
His main technical fault was that he overpedalled
in many of the arpeggio passages and the
interpretative chords. The airy passage in the second
movement was marred by his smearing with the
sustaining pedal. The bottom third of his runs often
got lost when he put his foot on the pedal and
prepared to hit a new forte.
Not Stealthy
Again, the interpretation lacked a lot. Barenboim
piayed with none of the stealth necessary to make
the first movement more than interesting. The
pauses between his ending chords, perhaps meant to
keep the audience on edge, sounded more as if
Barenboim were searching for the right notes. The
entire sonata needed vitality, and a broader
comprehension of its potential than Barenboim
could give it.
One interpretative aspect of Barenboim's playing
deserves mention. In the middle movements of all
three sonatas, where a single treble line sang over
broken chords in the bass, Barenboim played up
their romantic capacities. He played with the
dynamics and tempo in the treble to contrast them
with the consistent pattern in the bass. In a
performance which over all lacked insight, these
interludes came as a refreshing change.
Beethoven is supposed to be Barenboim's
specialty. The pianist has recorded all of
Beethoven's sonatas, but he has apparently failed to
develop the proper style or interpretation. Perhaps
he should adopt another composer as his own; he
might have better luck.

entire sonata needed vitality, and a broader
comprehension of its potential than Barenboim
could give it.
One interpretative aspect of Barenboim's playing
deserves mention. In the middle movements of all
three sonatas, where a single treble line sang over
broken chords in the bass, Barenboim played up
their romantic capacities. He played with the
dynamics and tempo in the treble to contrast them
with the consistent pattern in the bass. In a
performance which over all lacked insight, these
interludes came as a refreshing change.
Beethoven is supposed to be Barenboim's
specialty. The pianist has recorded all of
Beethoven's sonatas, but he has apparently failed to
develop the proper style or interpretation. Perhaps
he should adopt another composer as his own; he
might have better luck.
A very fine line separates a good performer from
a great one. Many musicians never cross it. Although
they develop virtuoso skill and show adequate
understanding of a composition, they fall short of
the mark.
Daniel Barenboim is just such a performer. In his
concert last Tuesday at the Opera House, he often
played well, sometimes exceptionally, but never
brilliantly.
Perhaps one event flustered him so much that his
performance afterwards didn't reach even his usual
calibre. In the last movement of the first selection,
Beethoven's Sonata in D Major, op. 10 no. 3, one of
the top strings in the piano broke. The ensuing
twang every time he hit a high note forced
Barenboim to get up and leave, while a piano tuner
came out to repair the string.
Even this mishap, however, cannot account for
the generally lackluster performance Barenboim
turned in. Occasionally, in melodic or scale passages,
Barenboim displayed mature interpretation or clever
technique, but the overall impression left this
reviewer cold.
Exemplary Selection
The first selection exemplified the entire
program. Barenboim displayed excellent technique,
especially in rapid right hand scale passages. In the
fourth, interrupted movement, he executed an
accurate tempestuous octave sequence in the right
hand followed by clear, showy arpeggios.
His interpretation left too much unsaid, Many of
his contrasts and subitos sounded weak. When he
used the proper dynamic patterns, they sounded too
programmed. He accented appogiaturas on the
wrong notes, and either over-rubatoed or didn't
rubato enough.
His performance of the second offering,
Beethoven's Sonata in A flat Major, op. 110,
confirmed my doubts. Barenboim played the
opening arpeggios with an excellent feathery' touch.
He used just enough pedal. In the middle of the
fourth movement, during a section echoing the
fugue subject stated in the beginning, he ably
synchronized the subject in both hands, although he
seemed to concentrate so much on those notes that
he stabbed at the crossed-over high notes.
Uneven Timing
He couldn't, however, maintain the proper style.
He timed the two against three passages in the
second movement unevenly and added too much
pedal to cover up the syncopation mistakes. In the
fourth movement, his right hand ran away with the
tempo that his left hand, playing the fugue subject,

was trying to keep.
Throughout the piece, he gave too much weight
to his left hand and often overpowered the right.
Despite the heavy bass, Barenboim underplayed
most of the left hand dynamics, especially the
crescendos in the ascending passages.
He never really arrived at a climax to a phrase.
He played coldly, more as if he were practicing a
finger exercise then performing a sonata requiring a
greater scope of interpretation.
Interpretation Needs Work
Barenboim finished the program with
Beethoven's Sonata in C Major, op. 53
("Waldstein"). Rumor has it that an excellent sight
reader can play all the notes well the first time he
sees this sonata. It is the interpretation that needs
hard work.
Barenboim performed some exemplary technical
feats, especially in the first movement. His opening
runs were clear and precise. His staccatos had just
enough abruptness. He synchronized two-handed
runs with consummate skill.
His main technical fault was that he overpedalled
in many of the arpeggio passages and the
interpretative chords. The airy passage in the second
movement was marred by his smearing with the
sustaining pedal. The bottom third of his runs often
got lost when he put his foot on the pedal and
prepared to hit a new forte.
Not Stealthy
Again, the interpretation lacked a lot. Barenboim
piayed with none of the stealth necessary to make
the first movement more than interesting. The
pauses between his ending chords, perhaps meant to
keep the audience on edge, sounded more as if
Barenboim were searching for the right notes. The
entire sonata needed vitality, and a broader

feats, especially in the first movement. His opening
runs were clear and precise. His staccatos had just
enough abruptness. He synchronized two-handed
runs with consummate skill.
His main technical fault was that he overpedalled
in many of the arpeggio passages and the
interpretative chords. The airy passage in the second
movement was marred by his smearing with the
sustaining pedal. The bottom third of his runs often
got lost when he put his foot on the pedal and
prepared to hit a new forte.
Not Stealthy
Again, the interpretation lacked a lot. Barenboim
piayed with none of the stealth necessary to make
the first movement more than interesting. The
pauses between his ending chords, perhaps meant to
keep the audience on edge, sounded more as if
Barenboim were searching for the right notes. The
entire sonata needed vitality, and a broader
comprehension of its potential than Barenboim
could give it.
One interpretative aspect of Barenboim's playing
deserves mention. In the middle movements of all
three sonatas, where a single treble line sang over
broken chords in the bass, Barenboim played up
their romantic capacities. He played with the
dynamics and tempo in the treble to contrast them
with the consistent pattern in the bass. In a
performance which over all lacked insight, these
interludes came as a refreshing change.
Beethoven is supposed to be Barenboim's
specialty. The pianist has recorded all of
Beethoven's sonatas, but he has apparently failed to
develop the proper style or interpretation. Perhaps
he should adopt another composer as his own; he
might have better luck.
