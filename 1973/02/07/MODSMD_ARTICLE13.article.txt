# ACT Revives Comic Classic
## 
### MARC D. KAYE 
I can just imagine taking my
children to a revival of 'Hair' in
the year 1999. Hopefully they
will be surprised by the conditions
of the 1960'5: the confusion, the
alientation, the change in life
styles.
For comparison's sake, I was
really surprised and delighted by
'You Can't Take It With You,' the
Pulitzer Prize-winning classic first
staged in 1936. This light comedy
was written for my parents'
generation by George Kaufman
and Moss Hart.
I witnessed the beginnings of
what we might consider "hipness"
unfold before my eyes. Contrary
to popular belief, trends towards
cultural change have been around
for years, since the turn of the
century. Although strongly
molded by the Pun tan work ethic
and the accompanying sexual
mores, American life has
proffered alternatives for years,
those same choices up before us
now.
Reflects Culture
' You Can't Take It With You'
may reflect the culture of the
thirties just as 'Hair' mirrors life in
the- sixties. Nonetheless, the
characters in 'Hair' are not the
only people or even the first to
opt out for a more relaxed, less
competitive, more loving, life
style.
Martin Vanderhof, the
patrian?h of the Sycamore family,
played impishly by William
Patterson, was walking up to his
office one morning in 1901 when
he thought to himself: "I don't

need this," and walked away
forever.
The Sycamore family is not
rich, yet they live comfortably for
people during the Depression
years. Each wacky member
pursues those activities which
interests him the most. Penelope
Sycamore, played wonderfully by
Mary Wickes, took up
playwrighting when a typewriter
was accidentally delivered to her
eight years before.
Fireworks
Paul Sycamore, played by E.
Kerrigan Prescott, could have
become an architect, but opted
for making fireworks, erector set
models of ships, and generally
being a fun-loving kid. Essie, their
madcap daughter, played by
Judith Knaiz, aspires to being a
ballerina but "confidentially
stinks," according to her teacher
Boris Kolinkhov, a forlorn
emigre-victim of the Russian
Revolution.
Martin enjoys college
graduation ceremonies and their
implications. His only
irritation comes from the federal
government, which is on his back
for income tax evasion years ago.
The Sycamore home
approaches concentrated insanity,
with the Sycamore's daughter
Alice, convincingly portrayed by
Marsha Mason, the only one with
further "realistic" ambitions.
She's in love with the boss's son,
played by Marc Singer. The son
comes from a very wealthy, blue
book family, who are all invited
to dinner at the Sycamore's.
The plot centers around the
resolution of the love affair and

the social obstacles to the lovers'
marriage.
The play is packed with line
after line of humor, satire, and
farce. All the actors and actresses
time their lives and rebuttals
beautifully. Some of the love
scenes are stiff and a bit alien.
They even get irritating at times.
But finally the people start
communicating and frankness
breaks through. The word "sex" is
even mentioned, many times.
Kaufman and Hart stereotyped
the black characters, but the parts
come off all right when they
throw in some valid and effective
jabs against the dominant white
culture. Hollywood stereotypes
were extremely pernicious in
comparison. There are many
funny lines directed against big
government. They are pretty

irrelevant for today's society but
they still succeeded in drawing
huge applause and laughter from
the predominantly older audience.
I must admit I came into the
ACT's Geary Theatre with mixed
feelings about seeing 'You Can't
Take It With You.' 1 thought it
was going to be another nostalgia
piece, really very distant from my
experience and consciousness. I
didn't suspect that I'd laugh and
learn too.
The play is pretty light and,
therefore, welcome in a theatre
era characterized by heaviness.
Besides, it serves as a good
reminder for those of both our
generation and our parent's that
"you can't take it with you." So,
I'm going to purchase three
tickets and invite my parents to
see it once again to have some
fun.
