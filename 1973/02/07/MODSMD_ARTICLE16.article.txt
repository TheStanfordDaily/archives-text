# Cards Blank Phillie Rookies In Belated Baseball Opener
## 
### SCOTT DAILEY 
Off to a belated start on the
1973 season, the Cardinals turned
back the Philadelphia Phillies
rookie team, 2-0, Monday, in the
first game of a three game series at
Sunken Diamond.
Both of Stanford's runs were
unearned, the result of three Phils
errors and a double by Mike
Lucich in the first inning.
Dan Shaw received credit for
the victory, striking out one and
surrendering one hit before
exiting for Ken Grolle in the
fourth.
The Cards were scheduled to
open the season last Saturday
against the Alumni, but that
contest was cancelled due to wet
grounds. Stanford will play the
Phils today at 2 p.m. and again
on Friday afternoon unless the
weatherman decides to be
uncooperative once again.
The rain held off long enough
Monday to allow Grolle to turn in
an outstanding performance in his
collegiate debut. The freshman
from Los Altos struck out the
first three men he faced, and
added another strikeout in the

fifth. Grolle gave up just a single
and two walks in his three inning
stint.
Coach Ray Young said he was
pleased with the pitching, praising
Grolle and Shaw, who gave up just
two hits between them.
Nick Peterson, who came on in
the seventh also pitched three
shutout frames but the Cards
could amass only three hits—two
singles and Lucich's double.
Coach Young, however, was not
concerned.
"The pitching's still ahead of
the hitting," he said, "and we
haven't had a chance to have too
much game-style batting practice
because of the rain. We'll start to
play ourselves into a hitting
ballclub."
Shaw looked good in his initial
outing of the year, although on
occasion he was a little wild. He
went to a three-ball count five
times in the first three innings,
although his luck held out
sufficiently so that he lost only
one batter to a base on balls.
Phils starter Ken Fuller was not
as lucky. Fuller could only stand
and watch while his defense

stumbled around in the first
inning and gave up two unearned
runs which cost him the ballgame.
The Phils erred on the first
three chances they received.
Stanford shortstop Kim
Hannaford opened the bottom of
the first with an easy bouncer to
short. Bill McMonigle threw
wildly to first and first baseman
Bruce Butler couldn't hold onto
the ball. Glen Johnson grounded
to second, and Rick Bosetti tossed
to McMonigle to force Hannaford.
McMonigle's relay to first
resembled a stone being skipped
across a pond, and the speedy
Johnson flew to second when the
throw got by Butler.
Phillie rightfielder Mike
Bordner misplayed Bob
Hampton's fly ball into a two-base
error to put runners on second
and third. Lucich followed with a
double to right, scoring Johnson
and Hampton for the only runs of
the ballgame.

the ball. Glen Johnson grounded
to second, and Rick Bosetti tossed
to McMonigle to force Hannaford.
McMonigle's relay to first
resembled a stone being skipped
across a pond, and the speedy
Johnson flew to second when the
throw got by Butler.
Phillie rightfielder Mike
Bordner misplayed Bob
Hampton's fly ball into a two-base
error to put runners on second
and third. Lucich followed with a
double to right, scoring Johnson
and Hampton for the only runs of
the ballgame.

PLAY BALL—Stanford's baseball season got underway Monday at
Sunken Diamond as the Cards shutout the Philadelphia Rookies 2-0.
Mark Lucich (20) drove in both runs for the Cards, who will face the
Phillies again today at 2 p.m.
Off to a belated start on the
1973 season, the Cardinals turned
back the Philadelphia Phillies
rookie team, 2-0, Monday, in the
first game of a three game series at
Sunken Diamond.
Both of Stanford's runs were
unearned, the result of three Phils
errors and a double by Mike
Lucich in the first inning.
Dan Shaw received credit for
the victory, striking out one and
surrendering one hit before
exiting for Ken Grolle in the
fourth.
The Cards were scheduled to
open the season last Saturday
against the Alumni, but that
contest was cancelled due to wet
grounds. Stanford will play the
Phils today at 2 p.m. and again
on Friday afternoon unless the
weatherman decides to be
uncooperative once again.
The rain held off long enough
Monday to allow Grolle to turn in
an outstanding performance in his
collegiate debut. The freshman
from Los Altos struck out the
first three men he faced, and
added another strikeout in the

fifth. Grolle gave up just a single
and two walks in his three inning
stint.
Coach Ray Young said he was
pleased with the pitching, praising
Grolle and Shaw, who gave up just
two hits between them.
Nick Peterson, who came on in
the seventh also pitched three
shutout frames but the Cards
could amass only three hits—two
singles and Lucich's double.
Coach Young, however, was not
concerned.
"The pitching's still ahead of
the hitting," he said, "and we
haven't had a chance to have too
much game-style batting practice
because of the rain. We'll start to
play ourselves into a hitting
ballclub."
Shaw looked good in his initial
outing of the year, although on
occasion he was a little wild. He
went to a three-ball count five
times in the first three innings,
although his luck held out
sufficiently so that he lost only
one batter to a base on balls.
Phils starter Ken Fuller was not
as lucky. Fuller could only stand
and watch while his defense

stumbled around in the first
inning and gave up two unearned
runs which cost him the ballgame.
The Phils erred on the first
three chances they received.
Stanford shortstop Kim
Hannaford opened the bottom of
the first with an easy bouncer to
short. Bill McMonigle threw
wildly to first and first baseman
Bruce Butler couldn't hold onto
the ball. Glen Johnson grounded
to second, and Rick Bosetti tossed
to McMonigle to force Hannaford.
McMonigle's relay to first
resembled a stone being skipped
across a pond, and the speedy
Johnson flew to second when the
