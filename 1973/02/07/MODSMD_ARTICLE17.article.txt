# Players Pleased By NFL Draft Results
## 
### MARK WHITE 
Stanford continued its recent
tradition as a producer of
professional football talent as
three Card players were chosen in
the National Football League
draft in last week and another was
signed as a free agent immediately
following the draft.
Jim Merlo, Mike Askea and
Roger Cowan joined 13 other
Stanford players who have been
drafted in the past two years and
Eric Cross was also signed. Last
year Stanford had the distinction
of being the only school to
produce two first round picks,
defensive end Greg Sampson and
linebacker Jeff Siemon. Two years
ago, Stanford great Jim Plunkett
was the first player chosen in the
annual draft.
Merlo became the first Cardinal
selected this year as the New
Orleans Saints picked him in the
fourth round, making him the
87 th collegian taken on the first
day of the draft. The 6-2, 222
pound outside linebacker came
into his own last year, then had a
truly outstanding season in 1972.
Merlo was named to the East-West
Shrine game and the Hula Bowl,
starred in both and was named the
outstanding defenseive player in

the latter. Merlo had been
considered a good pro prospect,
but it wasn't until after the Hula
Bowl that Jim became aware that
a team had a specific interest in
him.
Hopes Raised
"Before I went to Hawaii, the
only teams that seemed interested
in me were the 49er's and the
Packers," Merlo explained. "But
after the Hula Bowl a scout
named Bob Young caught me as
we were boarding the plane,
congratulated me on the game and
asked me for a phone number
where I could be reached during
the draft. This raised my hopes a
little.
"On the day of the draft Young
called me again and asked me if I
had anything against playing for
New Orleaiu. I told him I didn't
and he would get in touch
later. W hen" the third round came
up I was getting a little worried,
but then Young called back, told
me that I was now a Saint and
that they had chosen me in the
fourth round. The head coach,
J.D. Roberts called me soon after
that. Needless to say, I was very
pleased."
There has been some
speculation that Merlo lacks the
size to play professionally, but
Jim doesn't think his size will
keep him from playing for the
Saints. "The Saints indicated they
have confidence in my ability to
play linebacker; I was the only
linebacker they drafted and it's a
position where they need help."
The first Stanford lineman
to be chosen was 6-4, 260 pound
offensive tackle Askea. The
economics major from Visalia was
taken by the Denver Broncos in
the seventh round.
Askea Pleased
"With so many linemen drafted
high, I was pleased to have been
chosen when I was," Askea said.
The draft is really a tricky thing,
so often it depends on what a
team needs and who is available. I
was somewhat surprised to be
drafted by Denver. I had no
indication they were interested in
me, but with John Ralston as
head coach I should have some
idea of what to expect. I'll have a
better idea of what my chances
are when I go back to Denver in
late March during the first rookie
session."
Another lineman chosen was
defensive end Cowan. The
Pittsburgh Steelers made Cowan
their third defensive end picked
and their 14th draftee overall.

One player that was not
drafted, however, was Cross, the
Pacific Eight leading receiver who
was also third in the nation in
touchdown catches. Cross, it was
felt, lacked the size to make it in
the pros, despite his record setting
53 receptions and nine
touchdowns this season.
"I was hoping to be drafted
outright," Cross explained, "and I
waited right through the 16th
round expecting to get picked.

When it was all over I was quite
depressed. A friend and I went
back to my hometown, Alameda,
but what we didn't know was that
one of the Cowboy assistants,
Dick Mansberger, had called my
girlfriend trying to get a hold of
me. Mansberger then flew out
here from Dallas and told me the
Cowboys wanted me to sign as a
free agent."
Cross consulted with Stanford
coach Jack Christiansen for 45

minutes and then signed the
Cowboy contract. "I was glad to
sign with the Cowboys for several
reasons. Benny Barnes, who
played for Stanford last yeat, had
been signed by Dallas in the same
way and he told me he had been
treated very well by the Cowboy
organization.
"Supposedly Dallas is going to
trade either A 1 worth or Hayes
next year, so there should be a
receiver position open".
