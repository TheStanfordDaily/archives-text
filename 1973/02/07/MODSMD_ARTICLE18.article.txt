Stanford's gymnastics team travels south
tomorrow evening for a quadrangular competition
at Cal State Los Angeles. In what will undoubtedly
be their toughest competition to date, the Cards will
face Southern Illinois University, Cal State
Fullerton, and San Fernando Valley.
Southern Illinois was the 1972 NCAA University
Division champion. About a month ago, the
Salukis scored over 163 points in a dual meet. The
Cards' highest score so far has been just over 157.
Leading the Illinois squad is Gary Morova, the
alternate for the 1972 U.S. Olumpic team. "If he is
in good shape, he could give Steve (Hug) a lot of
trouble in the all-around," Stanford Coach Sadao
Hamada said. He added that, "S.I.U. gives a lot of
scholarships, so they can afford to have at least two
specialists in each event."
Cal State P'ullerton has already faced the Cards
once this season. Stanford won the meet by four
points in the season opener on January 19.
Fullerton was the 1972 NCAA College Division
champion, however, and mav have gained some
strength in the last three weeks

Stanford's third opponent, San Fernando Valley,
is, in Hamada's words, "a strong, solid team. They
should be as tough as Fullerton."
After last week's close call against UCLA, the
Cards should be ready for some top performances.
Hector Neff showed he was well on his way to
recovering from his hamstring injury with a couple
of fine exhibitions in Friday's contest. Bob
Anderson's sore shoulder seems to have healed well,
too.
Hug, Bob Anderson, and Ted Miyamoto will
compete in the all-around. Howard Bessen and
George Negrete will be the Cards' ring specialists.
John White may also compete on the rings.
Ted Marcy will once again be setting the pace on
the side horse. White is a possibility here, too.
Shawn Skerrett will do floor exercise, parallel bars,
and the long horse vault. Leo Hollberg will compete
in the vault and on the high bar. He and Bill Madsen
are also possibilities for floor exercise.
Depending on the state of his hamstring, Neff
could be competing on the side horse, parallel bars
and high bar. Denny Melendez is also a possibility
lor the high bar
