Train-Bus Crash Kills Seven
LITTLEFIELD, Tex. — Four children and three teenagers,
including two sets of brothers and sisters, were killed
yesterday afternoon when their school bus collided with a
Santa Fe freight train.
Seventeen others were injured, some critically,
including the bus driver, identified as Artis Johnson.
Police said 29 persons were on the bus.
Most of the victims were from the small farming
community of Fieldton, a few miles north of this Texas
Panhandle agricultural town.
The victims were identified as Edward Ortiz, 17;
Aurora Ortiz, 9; Diana Frausto, 9; David Frausto, 18;
Mary Medina, 10; Anita Martinez, 18, and Julie Davis, 9.
"They were killed instantly," Police Chief James Cox
said. The accident occurred on U.S. 385 just inside the
city limits shortly after 2 p.m. PST.
Stennis 'Prognosis' Grave
WASHINGTON — Sen. John C. Stennis was reported
awake, alert and resting comfortably but his prognosis was
"grave" following new surgery yesterday.
The senator was shot twice in a holdup a week ago and
was making speedy progress toward recovery before the
emergency surgery early yesterday.
At midafternoon, a spokesman at Walter Reed Army
Medical Center said "his condition is stable. The vital signs
are good. His temperature is somewhat elevated but
within expected levels. Sen. Stennis' condition is listed as
very serious. The prognosis remains grave."
The spokesman said Stennis was in the surgical
intensive care unit and was receiving intravenous fluids.
The Mississippi Democrat, chairman of the Senate
Armed Services Committee, underwent a 45-minute
exploratory operation after surgeons at Walter Reed Army
Medical Center "became concerned about a change in the
condition of his small intestine."
A hospital spokesman said doctors suspected blockage
of the small intestine.
Corona Parole Seen Possible
SACRAMENTO — Juan Corona, convicted in the
nation's biggest mass murder case, can be considered for
parole after seven years even though he has been
sentenced to 25 consecutive life terms in prison, state
authorities said yesterday.
"He can only serve one life," said Earl Halderman, a
spokesman for the California Adult Authority, the state's
parole granting agency.
Special prosecutor Ronald Fahey said later that the

effect of the consecutive sentences would be to deny
Corona any chance of parole because he would have to
serve seven years of each sentence, or 175 years, before he
could be eligible.
But state parole and other authorities said yesterday
that is incorrect.
Halderman said the law is that any sentence of
consecutive life terms is treated as one life sentence. A
state appeals court upheld that interpretation in 1945, he
said.
Defense attorney Richard Hawk moved for a new trial
on grounds of jury tampering. Hawk, himself sentenced to
54 days in jail for contempt of court, had said he would
appeal if his retrial motion were rejected. Hawk was
found in contempt for his conduct in the court and for
discussing the case outside the courtroom.
Justice Dept. Chides Congress
WASHINGTON — Stripping the President of full power to
impound funds would reduce him from chief executive to
chief clerk, the Justice Department told Congress
yesterday.
Joseph T. Sneed, deputy attorney general, also said
Congress has shown no signs it has the capacity to insure
balanced budgets or control inflation.
Sneed testified before a Senate Judiciary subcommittee
while the battle of the budget raged in both House and
Senate.
The House Rules Committee cleared a bill to resurrect
a popular farm program, the Rural Environmental
Assistance program. House action is expected today.
And after a White House meeting with President
Nixon, Republican congressional leaders quoted Nixon as
saying he would take whatever steps necessary to keep his
new budget intact. One leader predicted a substantial
number of vetoes.
Sneed said the nation needs the impounding authority
vested in the President to check overspending by
Congress.
"The exercise of this authority by the President to
promote fiscal stability is not usurpation. Rather it is in
the great tradition of checks and balances upon which our
Constitution is based," he said.
