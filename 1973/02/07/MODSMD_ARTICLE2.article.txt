# PA Medical Clinic Ponders Future; Negotiations Continue With Stanford
## 
### ROBERT BACON Second in a series 
If there is to be a Palo Alto Medical
Clinic (PAMC) at Stanford, how will it
relate to Stanford Medical Center?
Where will the new facility be located?
The rather complicated
negotiations over these questions are
in an early stage, and the principals
have cautioned against undue
speculation, but the broad outline of
the possible answers to those questions
can be seen.
The current round of
PAMC-Stanford negotiations began
last May when Clayton Rich, dean of
the Stanford Medical School, told
PAMC officials that Stanford was
willing to lease University land to
PAMC for a clinic building, and to
lease beds in Stanford Hospital to
enable PAMC to offer prepaid hospital
care to its patients.
Discussion has centered on the lease
of land for a clinic building, however.
John Johnson, executive
administrator of the PAMC, said this
week that the leasing of hospital beds
"has not been actively pursued,
because Stanford doesn't have extra
beds to lease."
This, combined with PAMC's
inability to build its own hospital, to
be discussed in the final article in this
series, has led PAMC to abandon at
least for the near future the idea of
offering a comprehensive prepaid
health care package including hospital
care.
Blue Cross
At present, PAMC, without hospital
facilities, offers prepaid hospital
coverage only through Blue Cross to
its prepaid subscribers, who include
many Stanford faculty and students.
Johnson explained that PAMC is
interested in becoming a health
maintenance organization (HMO)
offering comprehensive medical

services — including hospital care — on
a prepaid basis. But he pointed out
that the lack of available hospital beds
precludes such a possibility at the
present time.
HMO is often talked of as a means
of providing national health insurance
through private practitioners, with
public funds underwriting the
premiums of low-income and aged
persons, and employers contributing
substantially to the premiums for their
employees.
Johnson, who described the current
status of the negotiations between his
organization and Stanford as
"gathering and exchanging
information" and listed a number of
studies of Clinic use that will be
presented to Stanford officials,
outlined the type of agreement his
group has in mind:
"We would build, manage, and
operate our own facility" on land
leased from the University. "We would
insist on sufficient parking and
access.... We have to look for
growth in our future."
Mortgage
A PAMC facility on Stanford land,
like the present PAMC building, would
be financed by a mortgage obtained
through private channels. The Clinic is
a private partnership and does not
receive public funds, except through
such programs as Medicare and
Medi-Cal (assistance to low-income
persons).
Without the leased beds, a new
PAMC on Stanford land would
interact with Stanford Medical Center
in much the same ways as the present
PAMC does — which includes a broad
spectrum of connections discussed in
the first article in this series.
Publicly at least, the parties to the
discussions aren't yet talking about
specific parcels of land near the
Medical Center.

The large expanse of land reaching
from the Medical Center uphill to the
Golf,Courseis in academic reserve, and
University officials say it is the
University's most important
undeveloped parcel of land for future
academic use.
45 Acres
Across Willow Road from the
professional office development is a
45-acre parcel of land awaiting
development. Medical uses on it would
link the Medical Center with the
Stanford Children's Hospital on

Willow Road. However, it is much
larger than would be required for a
Clinic site.
. Both Johnson and Rich said
creation of improved auto access
routes to the Medical Center/Shopping
Center area would be necessary before
any move by PAMC to that vicinity.
"It's obvious that that [Willow]
road is saturated," Rich said.
"Neither of us would consider building
[a clinic] without improved access."

Center/Medical Center area,
particularly the lack of a through
street from downtown Palo Alto and
the necessity for non-university traffic
to use Stanford-maintained streets,
have been recognized as a problem in
other contexts as well, and are under
study by the Palo Alto city staff.
PAMC has been canvassing other
possible clinic sites in the
Midpeninsula area, some of them also
on Stanford land. These include the
Dillingham/Palo Alto Square on Page
Mill Road near El Camino Real and
"Stanford North" or "Page
Mill/Foothill," at the corner of Page
Mill Road and Foothill Expressway
above the Industrial Park.
Johnson said his organization's
information-gathering process includes
studies of where its patients come
from, clearly a key determinant of any
move.

Two years ago, PAMC was studying
vacant parcels of land, but with a quite
different purpose.

At present, PAMC, without hospital
facilities, offers prepaid hospital
coverage only through Blue Cross to
its prepaid subscribers, who include
many Stanford faculty and students.
Johnson explained that PAMC is
interested in becoming a health
maintenance organization (HMO)
offering comprehensive medical

services — including hospital care — on
a prepaid basis. But he pointed out
that the lack of available hospital beds
precludes such a possibility at the
present time.
HMO is often talked of as a means
of providing national health insurance
through private practitioners, with
public funds underwriting the
premiums of low-income and aged
persons, and employers contributing
substantially to the premiums for their
employees.
Johnson, who described the current
status of the negotiations between his
organization and Stanford as
"gathering and exchanging
information" and listed a number of
studies of Clinic use that will be
presented to Stanford officials,
outlined the type of agreement his
group has in mind:
"We would build, manage, and
operate our own facility" on land
leased from the University. "We would
insist on sufficient parking and
access.... We have to look for
growth in our future."
Mortgage
A PAMC facility on Stanford land,
like the present PAMC building, would
be financed by a mortgage obtained
through private channels. The Clinic is
a private partnership and does not
receive public funds, except through
such programs as Medicare and
Medi-Cal (assistance to low-income
persons).
Without the leased beds, a new
PAMC on Stanford land would
interact with Stanford Medical Center
in much the same ways as the present
PAMC does — which includes a broad
spectrum of connections discussed in
the first article in this series.
Publicly at least, the parties to the
discussions aren't yet talking about
specific parcels of land near the
Medical Center.

The large expanse of land reaching
from the Medical Center uphill to the
Golf,Courseis in academic reserve, and
University officials say it is the
University's most important
undeveloped parcel of land for future
academic use.
45 Acres
Across Willow Road from the
professional office development is a
45-acre parcel of land awaiting
development. Medical uses on it would
link the Medical Center with the
Stanford Children's Hospital on

Willow Road. However, it is much
larger than would be required for a
Clinic site.
. Both Johnson and Rich said
creation of improved auto access
routes to the Medical Center/Shopping
Center area would be necessary before
any move by PAMC to that vicinity.
"It's obvious that that [Willow]
road is saturated," Rich said.
"Neither of us would consider building
[a clinic] without improved access."

Center/Medical Center area,
particularly the lack of a through
street from downtown Palo Alto and
the necessity for non-university traffic
to use Stanford-maintained streets,
have been recognized as a problem in
other contexts as well, and are under
study by the Palo Alto city staff.
PAMC has been canvassing other
possible clinic sites in the
Midpeninsula area, some of them also
on Stanford land. These include the
Dillingham/Palo Alto Square on Page
Mill Road near El Camino Real and
"Stanford North" or "Page
Mill/Foothill," at the corner of Page
Mill Road and Foothill Expressway
above the Industrial Park.
Johnson said his organization's
information-gathering process includes
studies of where its patients come
from, clearly a key determinant of any
move.

Two years ago, PAMC was studying
vacant parcels of land, but with a quite
different purpose.
(Tomorrow: The hospital that never
was.)
If there is to be a Palo Alto Medical
Clinic (PAMC) at Stanford, how will it
relate to Stanford Medical Center?
Where will the new facility be located?
The rather complicated
negotiations over these questions are
in an early stage, and the principals
have cautioned against undue
speculation, but the broad outline of
the possible answers to those questions
can be seen.
The current round of
PAMC-Stanford negotiations began
last May when Clayton Rich, dean of
the Stanford Medical School, told
PAMC officials that Stanford was
willing to lease University land to
PAMC for a clinic building, and to
lease beds in Stanford Hospital to
enable PAMC to offer prepaid hospital
care to its patients.
Discussion has centered on the lease
of land for a clinic building, however.
John Johnson, executive
administrator of the PAMC, said this
week that the leasing of hospital beds
"has not been actively pursued,
because Stanford doesn't have extra
beds to lease."
This, combined with PAMC's
inability to build its own hospital, to
be discussed in the final article in this
series, has led PAMC to abandon at
least for the near future the idea of
offering a comprehensive prepaid
health care package including hospital

such programs as Medicare and

Without the leased beds, a new
PAMC on Stanford land would

in much the same ways as the present
PAMC does — which includes a broad
spectrum of connections discussed in

45 Acres
Across Willow Road from the

45-acre parcel of land awaiting
development. Medical uses on it would
link the Medical Center with the
Stanford Children's Hospital on

Willow Road. However, it is much
larger than would be required for a
Clinic site.

creation of improved auto access
routes to the Medical Center/Shopping
Center area would be necessary before
any move by PAMC to that vicinity.
"It's obvious that that [Willow]
road is saturated," Rich said.
"Neither of us would consider building
[a clinic] without improved access."

Center/Medical Center area,
particularly the lack of a through
street from downtown Palo Alto and
the necessity for non-university traffic
to use Stanford-maintained streets,
have been recognized as a problem in
other contexts as well, and are under
study by the Palo Alto city staff.
PAMC has been canvassing other
possible clinic sites in the
Midpeninsula area, some of them also
on Stanford land. These include the
Dillingham/Palo Alto Square on Page
Mill Road near El Camino Real and
"Stanford North" or "Page
Mill/Foothill," at the corner of Page
Mill Road and Foothill Expressway
above the Industrial Park.
Johnson said his organization's
information-gathering process includes
studies of where its patients come
from, clearly a key determinant of any
move.

Two years ago, PAMC was studying
vacant parcels of land, but with a quite
different purpose.

If there is to be a Palo Alto Medical
Clinic (PAMC) at Stanford, how will it
relate to Stanford Medical Center?
Where will the new facility be located?
The rather complicated
negotiations over these questions are
in an early stage, and the principals
have cautioned against undue
speculation, but the broad outline of
the possible answers to those questions
can be seen.
The current round of
PAMC-Stanford negotiations began
last May when Clayton Rich, dean of
the Stanford Medical School, told
PAMC officials that Stanford was
willing to lease University land to
PAMC for a clinic building, and to
lease beds in Stanford Hospital to
enable PAMC to offer prepaid hospital
care to its patients.
Discussion has centered on the lease
of land for a clinic building, however.
John Johnson, executive
administrator of the PAMC, said this
week that the leasing of hospital beds
"has not been actively pursued,
because Stanford doesn't have extra
beds to lease."
This, combined with PAMC's
inability to build its own hospital, to
be discussed in the final article in this
series, has led PAMC to abandon at
least for the near future the idea of
offering a comprehensive prepaid
health care package including hospital
care.
Blue Cross
At present, PAMC, without hospital
facilities, offers prepaid hospital
coverage only through Blue Cross to
its prepaid subscribers, who include
many Stanford faculty and students.
Johnson explained that PAMC is
interested in becoming a health
maintenance organization (HMO)
offering comprehensive medical

services — including hospital care — on
a prepaid basis. But he pointed out
that the lack of available hospital beds
precludes such a possibility at the
present time.
HMO is often talked of as a means
of providing national health insurance
through private practitioners, with
public funds underwriting the
premiums of low-income and aged
persons, and employers contributing
substantially to the premiums for their
employees.
Johnson, who described the current
status of the negotiations between his
organization and Stanford as
"gathering and exchanging
information" and listed a number of
studies of Clinic use that will be
presented to Stanford officials,
outlined the type of agreement his
group has in mind:
"We would build, manage, and
operate our own facility" on land
leased from the University. "We would
insist on sufficient parking and
access.... We have to look for
growth in our future."
Mortgage
A PAMC facility on Stanford land,
like the present PAMC building, would
be financed by a mortgage obtained
through private channels. The Clinic is
a private partnership and does not
receive public funds, except through
such programs as Medicare and
Medi-Cal (assistance to low-income
persons).
Without the leased beds, a new
PAMC on Stanford land would
interact with Stanford Medical Center
in much the same ways as the present
PAMC does — which includes a broad
spectrum of connections discussed in
