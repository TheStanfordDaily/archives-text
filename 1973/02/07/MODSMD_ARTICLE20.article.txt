# Judge Delays Franklin Hearing
## 
### TERRY ANZUR 
The series of hearing
postponements in fired English Prof.
H. Bruce Franklin's lawsuit against the
University continued yesterday as a
Superior Court judge ordered that the
hearing on the University's summary
dismissal motion be rescheduled.
Judge Homer B. Thompson
postponed the hearing after attorneys
representing both the University and
Franklin informed him that
presentation of all arguments would
last more than one hour.
The hearing had been scheduled for
yesterday on the motion calendar,
which placed a 30-minute time limit
on arguments on each side.
The Santa Clara County Superior
Court clerk set another hearing date
for Feb. 23 at 9 a.m.
Rehiring Asked
The lawsuit, filed last Aug. 15 by
the American Civil Liberties Union

(ACLU) on Franklin's behalf, seeks
Franklin's reinstatement with full back
pay, court costs, and unspecified
monetary damages.
The Board of Trustees dismissed
Franklin Jan. 22, 1972 in a 20-2 vote,
after an Advisory Board finding that
"by urging and inciting to illegal
coercion and violence" Franklin had
"repeatedly and seriously infringed
upon the rights of others in the
University."
The complaint alleges that
Franklin's firing resulted from his
"political action and political activity"
which are "affirmatively protected by
the guarantees of freedom of speech
and assembly" in the U.S. and
California constitutions.
Dismissal Motion
Claiming that Franklin's case
involves "no triable issue of fact," the
University filed for summary dismissal
of the suit last Oct. 26. That motion

was to have been heard in Superior
Court yesterday.
The judge yesterday granted a
motion permitting the ACLU to file a
supplemental declaration in the case.
Franklin's attorneys submitted an
affidavit containing French Prof.
Raymond Giraud's recollection of a
conversation he had with University
President Richard W. Lyman at a Jan.
5, 1973 Academic Council meeting.
The purpose of introducing the
affidavit as evidence, explained ACLU
Attorney Larry Sleizer, is to present
an interpretation of the University
contract.
"What one of the defendants
[Lyman] says is relevant,"
commented Sleizer. "His viewpoint
agrees with ours." Sleizer summarized
Lyman's opinion saying that Board
findings pertaining to dismissal do not
preclude a faculty member from
challenging those findings in court.
The lawsuit, said Sleizer, concerns
whether or not a faculty member can
challenge the factual findings of the
Board and present his case in court, as
opposed to simply having the court
review the Board decision.

The lawsuit, filed last Aug. 15 by
the American Civil Liberties Union

(ACLU) on Franklin's behalf, seeks
Franklin's reinstatement with full back
pay, court costs, and unspecified
monetary damages.
The Board of Trustees dismissed
Franklin Jan. 22, 1972 in a 20-2 vote,
after an Advisory Board finding that
"by urging and inciting to illegal
coercion and violence" Franklin had
"repeatedly and seriously infringed
upon the rights of others in the
University."
The complaint alleges that
Franklin's firing resulted from his
"political action and political activity"
which are "affirmatively protected by
the guarantees of freedom of speech
and assembly" in the U.S. and
California constitutions.
Dismissal Motion
Claiming that Franklin's case
involves "no triable issue of fact," the
University filed for summary dismissal
of the suit last Oct. 26. That motion

was to have been heard in Superior
Court yesterday.
The judge yesterday granted a
motion permitting the ACLU to file a
supplemental declaration in the case.
Franklin's attorneys submitted an
affidavit containing French Prof.
Raymond Giraud's recollection of a
conversation he had with University
President Richard W. Lyman at a Jan.
5, 1973 Academic Council meeting.
The purpose of introducing the
affidavit as evidence, explained ACLU
Attorney Larry Sleizer, is to present
an interpretation of the University
contract.
"What one of the defendants
[Lyman] says is relevant,"
commented Sleizer. "His viewpoint
agrees with ours." Sleizer summarized
Lyman's opinion saying that Board
findings pertaining to dismissal do not
preclude a faculty member from
challenging those findings in court.
The lawsuit, said Sleizer, concerns
whether or not a faculty member can
challenge the factual findings of the
Board and present his case in court, as
opposed to simply having the court
review the Board decision.
The series of hearing
postponements in fired English Prof.
H. Bruce Franklin's lawsuit against the
University continued yesterday as a
Superior Court judge ordered that the
hearing on the University's summary
dismissal motion be rescheduled.
Judge Homer B. Thompson
postponed the hearing after attorneys
representing both the University and
Franklin informed him that
presentation of all arguments would
last more than one hour.
The hearing had been scheduled for
yesterday on the motion calendar,
which placed a 30-minute time limit
on arguments on each side.
The Santa Clara County Superior
Court clerk set another hearing date
for Feb. 23 at 9 a.m.
