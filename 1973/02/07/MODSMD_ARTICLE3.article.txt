# Luce Cites Political Repression As Hindrance To Vietnam Peace
## 
### MARK SIMONIAN 
"As long as the United States tries
to maintain two Vietnams, there will
be war there. And until the South
Vietnamese government lets its
political prisoners go home, there will
be no peace."
Addressing a crowd of about 200 in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium last night, Don
Luce, a 38-year-old agricultural

economist and Vietnam specialist,
examined the U.S. and Saigon
governments' roles in the
reconstruction of post-cease-fire
Vietnam.
Luce pointed to both political
repression in the South and misuse of
U.S. military and financial aid as
blocks to successful reconstruction of
the Indochina area.

"Peace has not come to Vietnam,"
he stated. "Not for the Vietnamese,
anyway. There are more than 200,000
political prisoners in the Saigon
government jails. Most of these
prisoners are religious figures, teachers,
writers, and students."
Luce worked in Vietnam from
1958 to 1971; he spent most of those
twelve years living closely with the
people, identifying with many of their
problems. From 1961 to 1967 he
served as director of International
Voluntary Services in South Vietnam.
'Tiger Cages'
Two years ago, Luce made world
headlines when he, along with two
U.S. Congressmen, discovered the
infamous South Vietnamese "tiger
cage" prison at Con Son. Each
underground "cage" measured five by
ten feet and was used to hold from
three to five prisoners. The prisoners
were shackled constantly and lye was
often dumped by the guards through
the roof bars as a disciplinary measure.
Luce's visa was withdrawn by the
Saigon government in May, 1971 for
"special reasons" after these findings
had been published.
Luce related that in South Vietnam
"a person can be put in jail for two
years without being charged with a
crime. And this period is renewable.
"I have a friend who was originally
imprisoned because he wrote
something against the government in a
newspaper. Now he's charged with
murder. The [Saigon] government is
free to change the charges against its
political prisoners to avoid
international complaints.
U.S. Support
"And the United States is
supporting this repression."
After the Saigon government had
agreed to close the "tiger cages," Luce

said, the prisoners there were taken
out and ordered to build new cages as
a "self-help project." They refused.
However, with the help of a
$400,000 Department of the Navy
grant, an American construction firm
"built new cells two square feet
smaller than the old ones," Luce
stated. "That means as taxpayers, we
have paid for building new 'tiger
cages.' "
'Misallocated' Funds
Luce also documented other
examples of "misallocated" U.S. aid
funds.
"In 1971," he stated in an
interview before his speech, "the
United States gave the Saigon
government $21 million to help fund
the police and prisons; we gave only
$6.1 million for health and education
programs for the people. In 1972 the
police received $30 million, and health
and education funds were cut to $4.5
million."
"Our priorities have been more and
more for political repression," he
remarked.
Population Moved
"We have helped to move one-third
of the population from the farms to
the slums of the cities with the war.
We have destroyed the ecology of
much of the farmlands, and now there
are no jobs in the cities.
"We have split the Vietnamese
family, sent its sons to war. We have
made Saigon, once a very beautiful
city, into an ugly slum."
Luce continued, "We have taken a
country that was once on an
economically sound basis and turned it
into a country which imports $70
million worth of goods and exports
only $20 million."

"lack of understanding of the culture
of the farm people of Vietnam" and
for "wanting to remake Vietnam in its
own image with high-rise and crowded
textile mills."
He added, "We have never had an
ambassador that has spoken
Vietnamese."
As for actual reconstruction of the
country, Luce envisions a coalition
emerging within three to five years
between the three factions in
Vietnamese politics: the National
Liberation Front (NLF), the Saigon
regime, and the "Third Force"

comprised of neutralists and religious
leaders.
"What the Vietnamese really want
is peace. They want to go back to their
farms, and they want a Vietnam
independent of foreign control," he
told the audience.
Luce urged that Americans support
cutting off all U.S. aid and militaiy
advisers to the Saigon government
until they release all political
prisoners. He also suggested that
donations for reconstruction be made
to international and private
institutions such as the United Nations
or the American Friends Service
Committee.

"Peace has not come to Vietnam,"
he stated. "Not for the Vietnamese,
anyway. There are more than 200,000
political prisoners in the Saigon
government jails. Most of these
prisoners are religious figures, teachers,
writers, and students."
Luce worked in Vietnam from
1958 to 1971; he spent most of those
twelve years living closely with the
people, identifying with many of their
problems. From 1961 to 1967 he
served as director of International
Voluntary Services in South Vietnam.
'Tiger Cages'
Two years ago, Luce made world
headlines when he, along with two
U.S. Congressmen, discovered the
infamous South Vietnamese "tiger
cage" prison at Con Son. Each
underground "cage" measured five by
ten feet and was used to hold from
three to five prisoners. The prisoners
were shackled constantly and lye was
often dumped by the guards through
the roof bars as a disciplinary measure.
Luce's visa was withdrawn by the
Saigon government in May, 1971 for
"special reasons" after these findings
had been published.
Luce related that in South Vietnam
"a person can be put in jail for two
years without being charged with a
crime. And this period is renewable.
"I have a friend who was originally
imprisoned because he wrote
something against the government in a
newspaper. Now he's charged with
murder. The [Saigon] government is
free to change the charges against its
political prisoners to avoid
international complaints.
U.S. Support
"And the United States is
supporting this repression."
After the Saigon government had
agreed to close the "tiger cages," Luce

said, the prisoners there were taken
out and ordered to build new cages as
a "self-help project." They refused.
However, with the help of a
$400,000 Department of the Navy
grant, an American construction firm
"built new cells two square feet
smaller than the old ones," Luce
stated. "That means as taxpayers, we
have paid for building new 'tiger
cages.' "
'Misallocated' Funds
Luce also documented other
examples of "misallocated" U.S. aid
funds.
"In 1971," he stated in an
interview before his speech, "the
United States gave the Saigon
government $21 million to help fund
the police and prisons; we gave only
$6.1 million for health and education
programs for the people. In 1972 the
police received $30 million, and health
and education funds were cut to $4.5
million."
"Our priorities have been more and
more for political repression," he
remarked.
Population Moved
"We have helped to move one-third
of the population from the farms to
the slums of the cities with the war.
We have destroyed the ecology of
much of the farmlands, and now there
are no jobs in the cities.
"We have split the Vietnamese
family, sent its sons to war. We have
made Saigon, once a very beautiful
city, into an ugly slum."
Luce continued, "We have taken a
country that was once on an
economically sound basis and turned it
into a country which imports $70
million worth of goods and exports
only $20 million."
Lack Of Understanding

VIETNAM EXPERT — Don Luce, a specialist in Vietnam affairs, stated his views
on obstacles blocking an effective peace and reconstruction in Vietnam to an
East Asian Studies group and an audience at Dinkelspiel.
"lack of understanding of the culture
of the farm people of Vietnam" and
for "wanting to remake Vietnam in its
own image with high-rise and crowded
textile mills."
He added, "We have never had an
ambassador that has spoken
Vietnamese."
As for actual reconstruction of the
country, Luce envisions a coalition
emerging within three to five years
between the three factions in
Vietnamese politics: the National
Liberation Front (NLF), the Saigon
regime, and the "Third Force"

comprised of neutralists and religious
leaders.
"What the Vietnamese really want
is peace. They want to go back to their
farms, and they want a Vietnam
independent of foreign control," he
told the audience.
Luce urged that Americans support
cutting off all U.S. aid and militaiy
advisers to the Saigon government
until they release all political
prisoners. He also suggested that
donations for reconstruction be made
to international and private
institutions such as the United Nations
or the American Friends Service
Committee.
"As long as the United States tries
to maintain two Vietnams, there will
be war there. And until the South
Vietnamese government lets its
political prisoners go home, there will
be no peace."
Addressing a crowd of about 200 in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium last night, Don
Luce, a 38-year-old agricultural

economist and Vietnam specialist,
examined the U.S. and Saigon
governments' roles in the
reconstruction of post-cease-fire
Vietnam.
Luce pointed to both political
repression in the South and misuse of
U.S. military and financial aid as
blocks to successful reconstruction of
the Indochina area.

infamous South Vietnamese "tiger
cage" prison at Con Son. Each
underground "cage" measured five by
ten feet and was used to hold from
three to five prisoners. The prisoners
were shackled constantly and lye was
often dumped by the guards through
the roof bars as a disciplinary measure.
Luce's visa was withdrawn by the
Saigon government in May, 1971 for
"special reasons" after these findings
had been published.
Luce related that in South Vietnam
"a person can be put in jail for two
years without being charged with a
crime. And this period is renewable.
"I have a friend who was originally
imprisoned because he wrote
something against the government in a
newspaper. Now he's charged with
murder. The [Saigon] government is
free to change the charges against its
political prisoners to avoid
international complaints.
U.S. Support
"And the United States is
supporting this repression."
After the Saigon government had
agreed to close the "tiger cages," Luce

said, the prisoners there were taken
out and ordered to build new cages as
a "self-help project." They refused.
However, with the help of a
$400,000 Department of the Navy
grant, an American construction firm
"built new cells two square feet
smaller than the old ones," Luce
stated. "That means as taxpayers, we
have paid for building new 'tiger
cages.' "
'Misallocated' Funds
Luce also documented other
examples of "misallocated" U.S. aid
funds.
"In 1971," he stated in an
interview before his speech, "the
United States gave the Saigon
government $21 million to help fund
the police and prisons; we gave only
$6.1 million for health and education
programs for the people. In 1972 the
police received $30 million, and health
and education funds were cut to $4.5
million."
"Our priorities have been more and
more for political repression," he
remarked.
Population Moved
"We have helped to move one-third
of the population from the farms to
the slums of the cities with the war.
We have destroyed the ecology of
much of the farmlands, and now there
are no jobs in the cities.
"We have split the Vietnamese
family, sent its sons to war. We have
made Saigon, once a very beautiful
city, into an ugly slum."
Luce continued, "We have taken a
country that was once on an
economically sound basis and turned it
into a country which imports $70
million worth of goods and exports
only $20 million."
Lack Of Understanding
Luce faults the United States for a

VIETNAM EXPERT — Don Luce, a specialist in Vietnam affairs, stated his views
on obstacles blocking an effective peace and reconstruction in Vietnam to an
East Asian Studies group and an audience at Dinkelspiel.
"lack of understanding of the culture
of the farm people of Vietnam" and
for "wanting to remake Vietnam in its
own image with high-rise and crowded
textile mills."
He added, "We have never had an
ambassador that has spoken
Vietnamese."
As for actual reconstruction of the
country, Luce envisions a coalition
emerging within three to five years
between the three factions in
Vietnamese politics: the National
Liberation Front (NLF), the Saigon
regime, and the "Third Force"

comprised of neutralists and religious
leaders.
"What the Vietnamese really want
is peace. They want to go back to their
farms, and they want a Vietnam
independent of foreign control," he
told the audience.
Luce urged that Americans support
cutting off all U.S. aid and militaiy
advisers to the Saigon government
until they release all political
prisoners. He also suggested that
donations for reconstruction be made
to international and private
institutions such as the United Nations
or the American Friends Service
Committee.
"As long as the United States tries
to maintain two Vietnams, there will
be war there. And until the South
Vietnamese government lets its
political prisoners go home, there will
be no peace."
Addressing a crowd of about 200 in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium last night, Don
Luce, a 38-year-old agricultural

economist and Vietnam specialist,
examined the U.S. and Saigon
governments' roles in the
reconstruction of post-cease-fire
Vietnam.
Luce pointed to both political
repression in the South and misuse of
U.S. military and financial aid as
blocks to successful reconstruction of
the Indochina area.

"Peace has not come to Vietnam,"
he stated. "Not for the Vietnamese,
anyway. There are more than 200,000
political prisoners in the Saigon
government jails. Most of these
prisoners are religious figures, teachers,
writers, and students."
Luce worked in Vietnam from
1958 to 1971; he spent most of those
twelve years living closely with the
people, identifying with many of their
problems. From 1961 to 1967 he
served as director of International
Voluntary Services in South Vietnam.
'Tiger Cages'
Two years ago, Luce made world
headlines when he, along with two
U.S. Congressmen, discovered the
infamous South Vietnamese "tiger

underground "cage" measured five by

three to five prisoners. The prisoners
