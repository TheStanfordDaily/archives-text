# $10 To Make $10,240
## Illegal Chain Letters Circulate On Campus 
### KEVIN SMITH 
An illegal endless chain letter
scheme has been operating on the
Stanford campus since the beginning
of January.
According to the freshman
responsible for bringing the chain
scheme to Stanford, every person who
buys into the chain pays ten dollars,
and then receives a letter with 11
names on it, and a five dollar money
order made out to the top name on
the list.
The new person mails the money
order, then makes two copies of the
letter, crossing out the top name and
putting his own name at the bottom of
each list.
Following that, the new person
buys two more five dollar money
orders made out to the name which
has just been moved to the top of the
list. He then attaches one of the
money orders to each of the two
letters and attempts to sell the letters
for ten dollars apiece, continuing the
chain.

If he successfully sells both lists, he
breaks even financially, since he paid
ten dollars to join, another ten dollars
for two money orders, and then
receives twenty dollars back for selling
lists. If the system worked perfectly,
each participant would eventually
receive $10,240 in five dollar money
orders.
Colorado Origin
The freshman first involved got the
chain letter from a friend at Colorado
College. He claimed that his friend
called the person who was second on
the list at the time, and this person
said he had already received $500.
The freshman brought the letter to
Stanford after Christmas and declared
that there are now at least 50 Stanford
students participating.
The freshman was not aware that
he was participating in anything illegal.
He claimed, "I can't get in any trouble
with [the letter] because it's only
illegal if it's mailed."
Apparently it was stated in the
letter that there was nothing illegal

involved as long as the letter itself was
not mailed. The freshman said he
"would only do it if it wasn't
illegal . . . The letter said it was illegal
if mailed ... I don't know what the
law states ..."
In fact, the chain scheme does
violate federal law since the money
orders are sent through the mail.
According to J.P. Keown of the U.S.
Postal Inspection Service, any use of
the mail in a chain letter scheme can
be prosecuted as a felony.
Complaint First
Keown said investigations are
normally opened after there are
complaints from victims or intended
victims. He said the results of the
investigations are turned over to the
U.S. attorneys in the area "who
sometimes decline to prosecute in
minor cases where offenders
discontinue the illegal activity."
In addition to violating the federal
law, endless chain schemes in any
form, violate California law.
Roger Burke, a deputy district

attorney at the Santa Clara County
District Attorney's Palo Alto office,
declared that if the chain scheme came
to his attention, "I'd probably ask for
an investigation pertaining to it."
Tom Hanford, who holds a similar
post in the District Attorney's San
Jose office, stated, "I think that
anyone who is doing this is
committing an offense .. . Anybody
who's passing this chain on and is
making money from it is subject to
prosecution."
'Badly Burned'
Hanford explained that "the reason
these things are outlawed is because
there are only a certain number of
people around, and somebody's going
to get burned pretty badly."
The crime itself is a misdemeanor,
but Hanford said that if there were a
"conspiracy to commit this offense,
then it's a felony ... It's not very hard
to prove a conspiracy in this
circumstance, since there are all these
people involved."
When asked how the District
Attorney's office would proceed in
such a case, Hanford said "the normal
procedure would be to prosecute or
file a civil action to enjoin any further
distribution of the endless chain."
However, Hanford doubted that he
would seek an injunction or criminal
action in this case "because who's
getting hurt for ten bucks? I'll talk to
my boss, though, and who knows,
maybe we'll go to court or
something."
He emphasized that "this is not the
typical case that we go on. If it's not
in the interest of justice, then there are
some cases we don't prosecute. All this
would do is probably raise a big fuss
on the Stanford campus and that's all
we need!"
Not everyone who participated in
the chain scheme is happy about it.
Another freshman, a friend of the
first, has not found anyone who wants
to buy his two letters and so has lost
twenty dollars.
He said, "I feel kind of screwed. It
went like wildfire. It was kind of the
psychology of buying all together."
He concluded philosophically, "I
figure it is a learning experience. I can
rationalize my loss that wav."
