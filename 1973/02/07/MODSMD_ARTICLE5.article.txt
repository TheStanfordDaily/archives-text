# Stanford Fights Budget Cuts
## 
### CHRISTY WISE 
President Richard Lyman last night said the University
"is trying to do whatever [it] can in Washington"
regarding proposed federal budget cuts.
Speaking on KZSU's "Campus Conference," Lyman
said the University intends to speak to Congress and the
Administration. The University wants to make people
aware of the specific effects of the budget proposals,
Lyman added.
Although the federal budget affects a great number of
areas in the University, Lyman said the sharpest impact on
students will be reductions in federal scholarship
programs.
Tunnels Short-Sighted
Lyman said the construction of two new tunnels in the
football stadium, expected to cost $400,000, was
shortsighted since other Athletic Department projects are
uncompleted. But he pointed out that the money
belonged to the department and couldn't be spent
anywhere else.
He said the new tunnels were valuable in terms of
safety and upkeep as well as convenience.
Lyman, just home from five days in Washington, said
reports of a 60 percent reduction in general research
grants are exaggerated. He explained the General
Institutional Grant, $350,000 last year, will probably be

$140,000 this year. According to Lyman, the grant is
"not a large sum compared to the total research fund."
Low-Paying Jobs
In assuming medical students will easily be able to pay
back loans following their schooling, Washington is not
considering students who enter research and other
branches of medicine that don't pay as well, Lyman said.
By cutting back federal grants, he added, Washington may
be pushing students to pursue money-making branches.
"The overall research picture doesn't look that
threatening yet," Lyman said. He explained the University
will "wait and see" before making definite plans for
reallocating funds from other areas.
Although it is too early to tell what strategy Congress
will use, he claimed some Congressmen want to revise the
budget.
According to Lyman, higher education has a feeble
lobby in Washington. They are not well organized because
different institutions go separate ways, there is not a good
consensus, and they are understaffed.
It is even difficult to get the Association of American
Universities, of which Stanford is a member, to agree,
Lyman said.
Although higher education is "not a small interest in
this country anymore," Lyman feels the Association is a
"long way from being able to unify institutions at all."
