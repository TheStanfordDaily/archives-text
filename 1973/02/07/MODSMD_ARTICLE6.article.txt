# Musings Of A Foreign Student
## The 						Gurus Are Coming 
### 
Sri Krishn Chopra

When, during my first lecture
at Stanford, the professor said,
"Gee, this goddamn problem has
screwed me," I nearly exclaimed
Omigosh. Or, rather, Hare
Krishna.
Then 1 saw that the prof wasn't
quite like the gurus we have back
home in India. (A guru,
incidentally, is the Sanskrit name
for a teacher who isn't necessarily
one of the saffron robed Swamis
you see on glossy American
mags.) This one wore a multihued,
mod shirt, flared trousers, a huge
broad crimson tie, shaggy
sideburns, dishevelled hair . . . all
the fixings. "Cool" about sums up
the description, if that's the mot
juste 1 was groping for.
And when I looked around, I
also saw that the shishyas
(Sanskrit for pupils) weren't the
sort of sober looking, staid, Do I
have your permission Sir, students
that one bumps into in the Indian
Varsities. Here were a bunch of
kids whose outlandish attires
make a newcomer start nervously
fingering the waistcoat buttons of
his three piece and wondering if,
after all, he should have brought
along those tattered khaki
overalls. Like someone told me
soon after I arrived, don't get
bewildered, patched blue jeans are
the national dress here.
Legs All Over
Well, I guess in that case, blue
jeans are above question. But
when you find guys sprawled
around, legs all over the
classroom, and nobody so much
as looks up when the Teach walks
in or out and chaps are reading
the Stanford Daily (or similar
crap) like it was bedtea time, or
smoking a cool fag, then, dash it
all, the mixture becomes a spot
too rich. What?
"You kidding?" exclaimed an
American classmate when I told
him that in India, college
students, even now, get up when
the Teach walks in, that it's
blasphemy to have your legs

facing him, and nobody ever
smokes or drinks coffee in class.
And all this because the guru, in
the Indian tradition, is a deeply
revered person.
"Why is he revered?" asks my
American friend.
Fountainhead
"Because he is supposed to be
the fountainhead of knowledge.
Because he is doing you a grpat
> favour by imparting his
knowledge to you."
"Shit," retorts my friend. "The
guy is teaching you because he is
paid to teach. Where do you think
his salary comes from? From your
tuition and mine. See?"
"No, I "
"You know why we don't
respect teachers the wav you do?"
butts in another American
classmate, before I could
complete my objection. "Because
for us, knowledge is ever
changing. We ain't gonna accept
no one's word for it unless we
question him real hard."
Progress
This time I didn't attempt to
object. It looked like the guy had
a point there. Maybe that's the
reason why the Americans have
progressed faster than the rest of
'em. Because they look at
questioning as the very essence of
learning.
Not that questioning is denied
in the traditional Indian
guru-shishya relationship. Only it
is toned and mellowed , with
reverence for the guru. But maybe
that kind of stuff is too
outmoded, too archaic, for this
place.
So I figured, till I saw those
posters of Guru Maharaj Ji all over
the campus. A Swami in kurta
(are saffron robes out?), halo
'round his head, urging the misled
youth to come ye to him to see
the light and all that jazz.
Meditation
I found out more: of how kids
here are getting turned on, in

ever increasing numbers, by
gurus who teach Hindu
philosophy, meditation, etc.; of
how hundreds of them go to live
with a guru the trad way, during
the holidays. I also met followers
of the Hare Krishna mission, the
Ramakrishna mission, the
Annanda Marg ... on campus and
elsewhere, who told me that for
them their guru was everything.
All of which means that gurus
sure are in. Here. And, maybe,
before long, would be replacing
the Cool Profs. Alan Arkin: here's
your chance before someone else
grabs it. How about giving us a
movie called: The Gurus are
coming, the Gurus are coming.
