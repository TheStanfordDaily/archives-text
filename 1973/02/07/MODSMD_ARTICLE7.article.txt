# On Hooker's Individualism
## Consumer Responsibility 
### 
; Dan Higgin*

It is inevitable that as the world progresses—as
societies and institutions become more complex,
and inter-relationships become more
complicated—small groups of less capable
individuals will inevitably be left behind. They will
find that the stress of coming to grips with a
constantly widening range of facts, situations and
decisions, and with having to deal with increasingly
sophisticated distinctions is more than they are able
to tolerate. They are gradually overwhelmed.
The competitive urge to master problems of
increasing complexity evolves into vague feelings of
resentment, and eventually into a withdrawal. In the
withdrawn stage the individual accepts his millieu
strictly at face value. He dares not look to reasons,
causes, or consequences for fear of breaking the
fragile shell that encrusts him.
Ironically, this group often hardens into an
unquestioning acceptance of the progress-oriented
system that brought about their debilitation. As if
staring mesmerized into the light that is blinding
them, they are determined to see nothing else.
Anyone who questions the validity of a superficial
analysis is threatening to eclipse that light, is poking
at the crust. Such action provokes the immediate,
and sometimes vocal, wrath of the withdrawn
individual. Hence, we have Chris Hocker striking out
irrationally in all directions—lambasting (albeit
sometimes incoherently) his opponents in the pages
of the Daily.
Responsibility
His article in the Jan. 30 edition of the Daily is
an excellent example, if for no other reason than
that it is a bit more rational and coherent than most
of his work. In the article Hocker assails the evil
purveyors of the idea that individuals have
responsibility—responsibility to look beyond the
most immediate consequences of one's actions.
Obviously, he could not accept such radical and
excessive ideas. For him, the admission that our
actions do not simply begin and end with ourselves
would mean the destruction of the protective crust.
He cannot admit responsibility into his world, so he
destroys it by dragging it through Russian knives
and Republican wheat, and beyond the borders of
the ridiculous. But isresponsibilityreally a ridiculous

notion, and is the plight of farmworkers really so
complex that it cannot be understood?
For decades migrant farmworkers have been
among the lowest-paid, least-protected workers in
the country. Their average life expectancy is about
49 years. Social security benefits, minimum wage
and child labor laws have consistently been
withheld, either in principle or in practice.
Farmworkers' attempts at unionization have
regularly been met with violence from employers
and government.
Lettuce
The United Farmworkers' request for public
consciousness and cooperation in dealing with their
problems is a rather simple and humble proposition.
They simply ask the buyer to distinguish between
union head lettuce and non-union head lettuce.
Union head lettuce is sold at Co-op; non-union
head lettuce is sold at Safeway and most other
stores; red and romaine lettuce is sold everywhere.
Buying non-union head lettuce works against the
only effective union the farmworkers have, buying
any of the others does not. That shouldn't be too
complicated for a Stanford senior like Mr. Hocker
to grasp.
Likewise with Coors. If I have a choice between
several brands of beer I would rather not buy from a
company with a reputation for mistreating its
workers. That's fairly simple. After all, keeping your
employees happy so they don't cause you trouble is
just a good capitalistic business practice, and that's
exactly one of the things Mr. Hocker has been
espousing all these years.
Honesty
It all comes down to the realization that, as the
poet John Donne put it, "No man is an island." The
world has become more complex, distinctions are
more difficult. Even so, our actions still have
consequences and we have the responsibility, and
the ability, to recognize them.
Regardless, I must credit Mr. Hocker with a
certain degree of personal honesty. At the end of his
article his fanticized friend asks him if he
understands, and Hocker replies, "I don't." Clearly,
he doesn't.

societies and institutions become more complex,
and inter-relationships become more
complicated—small groups of less capable
individuals will inevitably be left behind. They will
find that the stress of coming to grips with a
constantly widening range of facts, situations and
decisions, and with having to deal with increasingly
sophisticated distinctions is more than they are able
to tolerate. They are gradually overwhelmed.
The competitive urge to master problems of
increasing complexity evolves into vague feelings of
resentment, and eventually into a withdrawal. In the
withdrawn stage the individual accepts his millieu
strictly at face value. He dares not look to reasons,
causes, or consequences for fear of breaking the
fragile shell that encrusts him.
Ironically, this group often hardens into an
unquestioning acceptance of the progress-oriented
system that brought about their debilitation. As if
staring mesmerized into the light that is blinding
them, they are determined to see nothing else.
Anyone who questions the validity of a superficial
analysis is threatening to eclipse that light, is poking
at the crust. Such action provokes the immediate,
and sometimes vocal, wrath of the withdrawn
individual. Hence, we have Chris Hocker striking out
irrationally in all directions—lambasting (albeit
sometimes incoherently) his opponents in the pages
of the Daily.
Responsibility
His article in the Jan. 30 edition of the Daily is
an excellent example, if for no other reason than
that it is a bit more rational and coherent than most
of his work. In the article Hocker assails the evil
purveyors of the idea that individuals have
responsibility—responsibility to look beyond the
most immediate consequences of one's actions.
Obviously, he could not accept such radical and
excessive ideas. For him, the admission that our
actions do not simply begin and end with ourselves
would mean the destruction of the protective crust.
He cannot admit responsibility into his world, so he
destroys it by dragging it through Russian knives
and Republican wheat, and beyond the borders of
the ridiculous. But isresponsibilityreally a ridiculous

notion, and is the plight of farmworkers really so
complex that it cannot be understood?
For decades migrant farmworkers have been
among the lowest-paid, least-protected workers in
the country. Their average life expectancy is about
49 years. Social security benefits, minimum wage
and child labor laws have consistently been
withheld, either in principle or in practice.
Farmworkers' attempts at unionization have
regularly been met with violence from employers
and government.
Lettuce
The United Farmworkers' request for public
consciousness and cooperation in dealing with their
problems is a rather simple and humble proposition.
They simply ask the buyer to distinguish between
union head lettuce and non-union head lettuce.
Union head lettuce is sold at Co-op; non-union
head lettuce is sold at Safeway and most other
stores; red and romaine lettuce is sold everywhere.
Buying non-union head lettuce works against the
only effective union the farmworkers have, buying
any of the others does not. That shouldn't be too
complicated for a Stanford senior like Mr. Hocker
to grasp.
Likewise with Coors. If I have a choice between
several brands of beer I would rather not buy from a
company with a reputation for mistreating its
workers. That's fairly simple. After all, keeping your
employees happy so they don't cause you trouble is
just a good capitalistic business practice, and that's
exactly one of the things Mr. Hocker has been
espousing all these years.
Honesty
It all comes down to the realization that, as the
poet John Donne put it, "No man is an island." The
world has become more complex, distinctions are
more difficult. Even so, our actions still have
consequences and we have the responsibility, and
the ability, to recognize them.
Regardless, I must credit Mr. Hocker with a
certain degree of personal honesty. At the end of his
article his fanticized friend asks him if he
understands, and Hocker replies, "I don't." Clearly,
he doesn't.
