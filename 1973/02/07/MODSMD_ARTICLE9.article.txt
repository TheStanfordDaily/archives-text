# Support For Julia Harvey
## 'Stanford Workers: Fight Layoffs' 
### 
Linda Crouse

So the administration has
finally awarded Julia Harvey her
gift for 25 years of service: a swift
kick you-know-where. And while
they're pushing this 60 year old
woman out the door, the
administrators who make many
times her salary (in a university
which rates next to
Colgate-Palmolive in corporate
assets) wring their hands and say
they just don't have the money
and they're just so sorry to "have
to" let her go. "Go" usually
means going to unemployment or
welfare and foodstamps, but then,
administrators are shielded from
these kinds of harsh realities.
This sort of "I'm your buddy"

approach is hard to fight and the
administration is clever enough to
know it. A few years ago they
would have re-affirmed their
"right" to lay off "surplus"
workers but they've learned that
being up-front like that only
serves to mobilize workers more.
After all, even if you're losing
your home and facing bill
collectors when you're laid-off,
how can you confront the
administrator responsible when
he's standing there next to you
sniveling?
Resources
It's important for Stanford
workers to realize several things.
First, Stanford has the resources
to re-hire Julia and to stop
lay-offs if it really wanted to.
Stanford has at least $5 billion in
assets. It is one of the wealthiest
institutions in the country and
ranks among the highest in
endowments.
The medical center, which is
laying off many of its workers,
has $9,000,000 alone for a new
wing, and departments such as
genetics which has "let" people go
are at the same time receiving
close to half a million in new
grants this year. No one can be so
naive to think that if Doctors
Rich or Gonda lost some grant
money that they would be
standing in the unemployment
line. No: in the worst case a few
books would be juggled here or
there and there wouldn't be the

slightest interruption to their
$30,000 or $40,000 salaries.
But somehow, in the midst of
all this, Stanford can't cough up
the money even for one worker, a
couple of more years until she
retires.
Rocking The Boat
The second thing workers must
understand is that there are other
lay-offs besides Julia's. Unlike
Julia, though, most of them are
going quietly and we never hear
about them. They have the
illusion that if they don't rock the
boat their boss will re-hire them
or give them a better
recommendation. Of course that's
just what the administration
wants. It makes their job much
easier. And it's the one way you'll
be sure to be laid off.
There is only one way to stop
lay-offs and that is to take action
and put pressure on the
administration. We have had to
fight for everv little thing we have
here. It took a sit-in to get a
grievance hearing at the hospital.
It took the law to force Stanford
to finally pay unemployment
insurance and it took picket lines
to get a change in minimum pay,
and a boycott to stop lay-offs at
Tresidder.
What To Do
Workers getting their lay-off
notices should:
1) Contact one of the many
organizations on campus such as
USE, Venceremos, the hospital

BAC, etc
2) File a grievance. USE will
help.
All workers should:
3) Demand that Stanford live
up to its own policy of placing
laid off workers in other jobs.
4) Demand that an emergency
fund be established for workers.
5) Demand that some of the
46% overhead Stanford gets on all
federal grants go to this fund.
6) Support Julia all the way.
Julia's layoff is an attack on all
workers, not only because it's so
barbaric, but because Julia has
been one of the most active labor
organizers on campus. We cannot
allow any more John Dolly's here.
The repression coming down in
this country takes many forms:
attacks on revolutionary groups,
wage freezes, "adjustment"
centers in prisons, imprisoning
reporters, etc. You name it.
Laying-off labor organizers is one
of them. We must fight back
because what is at stake is our
livelihoods and rights as workers.
Profits
The last thing that workers
should understand is that there is
a very real reason why we have to
continually face losing our jobs in
this country. Nixon is combatting
inflation with lay-offs. (Third
world and women workers are
always the first victims of this
policy.) Having a reservoir of
unemployed is one of the most
effective ways to keep wages

down and weaken unions.
Meanwhile, the large corporations
and banks have been reaping in
unprecedented profits.
The single biggest reason for
the inflation and lay-offs has
the war. We've squandered
wealth on destroying a people
who threatened our national (big
business) security by almost
voting in a communist
government in 1954. Although
the war has killed over 1,000,000
and caused massive lay-offs and
set-backs for workers here, it has
been very profitable for some.
The large corporations and banks
have made unprecedented profits
from "defense" contracts while at
the same time trying to make Asia
safe for their investments.
They forgot one thing, though.
The Vietnamese were willing to
fight back. And they're winning
Socialism
Of course what Nixon and his
bankers (and the Stanford faculty
who've made it off of DoD funds
for the war) don't tell you is that
under socialism and communism,
which the Vietnamese have jjeen
fighting for, workers aren't I 'laid
off. Under socialism you don't
have to compete to make a living.
You have a right to it.
That's because socialism means
that workers, rather than large
corporations or banks or
Rockefellers, run the country.

would have re-affirmed their
"right" to lay off "surplus"
workers but they've learned that
being up-front like that only
serves to mobilize workers more.
After all, even if you're losing
your home and facing bill
collectors when you're laid-off,
how can you confront the
administrator responsible when
he's standing there next to you
sniveling?
Resources
It's important for Stanford
workers to realize several things.
First, Stanford has the resources
to re-hire Julia and to stop
lay-offs if it really wanted to.
Stanford has at least $5 billion in
assets. It is one of the wealthiest
institutions in the country and
ranks among the highest in
endowments.
The medical center, which is
laying off many of its workers,
has $9,000,000 alone for a new
wing, and departments such as
genetics which has "let" people go
are at the same time receiving
close to half a million in new
grants this year. No one can be so
naive to think that if Doctors
Rich or Gonda lost some grant
money that they would be
standing in the unemployment
line. No: in the worst case a few
books would be juggled here or
there and there wouldn't be the

slightest interruption to their
$30,000 or $40,000 salaries.
But somehow, in the midst of
all this, Stanford can't cough up
the money even for one worker, a
couple of more years until she
retires.
Rocking The Boat
The second thing workers must
understand is that there are other
lay-offs besides Julia's. Unlike
Julia, though, most of them are
going quietly and we never hear
about them. They have the
illusion that if they don't rock the
boat their boss will re-hire them
or give them a better
recommendation. Of course that's
just what the administration
wants. It makes their job much
easier. And it's the one way you'll
be sure to be laid off.
There is only one way to stop
lay-offs and that is to take action
and put pressure on the
administration. We have had to
fight for everv little thing we have
here. It took a sit-in to get a
grievance hearing at the hospital.
It took the law to force Stanford
to finally pay unemployment
insurance and it took picket lines
to get a change in minimum pay,
and a boycott to stop lay-offs at
Tresidder.
What To Do
Workers getting their lay-off
notices should:
1) Contact one of the many
organizations on campus such as
USE, Venceremos, the hospital

BAC, etc
2) File a grievance. USE will
help.
All workers should:
3) Demand that Stanford live
up to its own policy of placing
laid off workers in other jobs.
4) Demand that an emergency
fund be established for workers.
5) Demand that some of the
46% overhead Stanford gets on all
federal grants go to this fund.
6) Support Julia all the way.
Julia's layoff is an attack on all
workers, not only because it's so
barbaric, but because Julia has
been one of the most active labor
organizers on campus. We cannot
allow any more John Dolly's here.
The repression coming down in
this country takes many forms:
attacks on revolutionary groups,
wage freezes, "adjustment"
centers in prisons, imprisoning
reporters, etc. You name it.
Laying-off labor organizers is one
of them. We must fight back
because what is at stake is our
livelihoods and rights as workers.
Profits
The last thing that workers
should understand is that there is
a very real reason why we have to
continually face losing our jobs in
this country. Nixon is combatting
inflation with lay-offs. (Third
world and women workers are
always the first victims of this
policy.) Having a reservoir of
unemployed is one of the most
effective ways to keep wages

down and weaken unions.
Meanwhile, the large corporations
and banks have been reaping in
unprecedented profits.
The single biggest reason for
the inflation and lay-offs has
the war. We've squandered
wealth on destroying a people
who threatened our national (big
business) security by almost
voting in a communist
government in 1954. Although
the war has killed over 1,000,000
and caused massive lay-offs and
set-backs for workers here, it has
been very profitable for some.
The large corporations and banks
have made unprecedented profits
from "defense" contracts while at
the same time trying to make Asia
safe for their investments.
They forgot one thing, though.
The Vietnamese were willing to
fight back. And they're winning
Socialism
Of course what Nixon and his
bankers (and the Stanford faculty
who've made it off of DoD funds
for the war) don't tell you is that
under socialism and communism,
which the Vietnamese have jjeen
fighting for, workers aren't I 'laid
off. Under socialism you don't
have to compete to make a living.
You have a right to it.
That's because socialism means
that workers, rather than large
corporations or banks or
Rockefellers, run the country.

So the administration has
finally awarded Julia Harvey her
gift for 25 years of service: a swift
kick you-know-where. And while
they're pushing this 60 year old
woman out the door, the
administrators who make many
times her salary (in a university
which rates next to
Colgate-Palmolive in corporate
assets) wring their hands and say
they just don't have the money
and they're just so sorry to "have

means going to unemployment or

has $9,000,000 alone for a new
wing, and departments such as
genetics which has "let" people go
are at the same time receiving
close to half a million in new
grants this year. No one can be so
naive to think that if Doctors
Rich or Gonda lost some grant
money that they would be
standing in the unemployment
line. No: in the worst case a few
books would be juggled here or
there and there wouldn't be the

slightest interruption to their
$30,000 or $40,000 salaries.
But somehow, in the midst of
all this, Stanford can't cough up
the money even for one worker, a
couple of more years until she
retires.
Rocking The Boat
The second thing workers must
understand is that there are other
lay-offs besides Julia's. Unlike
Julia, though, most of them are
going quietly and we never hear
about them. They have the
illusion that if they don't rock the
boat their boss will re-hire them
or give them a better
recommendation. Of course that's
just what the administration
wants. It makes their job much
easier. And it's the one way you'll
be sure to be laid off.
There is only one way to stop
lay-offs and that is to take action
and put pressure on the
administration. We have had to
fight for everv little thing we have
here. It took a sit-in to get a
grievance hearing at the hospital.
It took the law to force Stanford
to finally pay unemployment
insurance and it took picket lines
to get a change in minimum pay,
and a boycott to stop lay-offs at
Tresidder.
What To Do
Workers getting their lay-off
notices should:
1) Contact one of the many
organizations on campus such as
USE, Venceremos, the hospital

BAC, etc
2) File a grievance. USE will
help.
All workers should:
3) Demand that Stanford live
up to its own policy of placing
laid off workers in other jobs.
4) Demand that an emergency
fund be established for workers.
5) Demand that some of the
46% overhead Stanford gets on all
federal grants go to this fund.
6) Support Julia all the way.
Julia's layoff is an attack on all
workers, not only because it's so
barbaric, but because Julia has
been one of the most active labor
organizers on campus. We cannot
allow any more John Dolly's here.
The repression coming down in
this country takes many forms:
attacks on revolutionary groups,
wage freezes, "adjustment"
centers in prisons, imprisoning
reporters, etc. You name it.
Laying-off labor organizers is one
of them. We must fight back
because what is at stake is our
livelihoods and rights as workers.
Profits
The last thing that workers
should understand is that there is
a very real reason why we have to
continually face losing our jobs in
this country. Nixon is combatting
inflation with lay-offs. (Third
world and women workers are
always the first victims of this
policy.) Having a reservoir of
unemployed is one of the most
effective ways to keep wages

down and weaken unions.
Meanwhile, the large corporations
and banks have been reaping in
unprecedented profits.
The single biggest reason for
the inflation and lay-offs has
the war. We've squandered
wealth on destroying a people
who threatened our national (big
business) security by almost
voting in a communist
government in 1954. Although
the war has killed over 1,000,000
and caused massive lay-offs and
set-backs for workers here, it has
been very profitable for some.
The large corporations and banks
have made unprecedented profits
from "defense" contracts while at
the same time trying to make Asia
safe for their investments.
They forgot one thing, though.
The Vietnamese were willing to
fight back. And they're winning
Socialism
Of course what Nixon and his
bankers (and the Stanford faculty
who've made it off of DoD funds
for the war) don't tell you is that
under socialism and communism,
which the Vietnamese have jjeen
fighting for, workers aren't I 'laid
off. Under socialism you don't
have to compete to make a living.
You have a right to it.
That's because socialism means
that workers, rather than large
corporations or banks or
Rockefellers, run the country.

So the administration has
finally awarded Julia Harvey her
gift for 25 years of service: a swift
kick you-know-where. And while
they're pushing this 60 year old
woman out the door, the
administrators who make many
times her salary (in a university
which rates next to
Colgate-Palmolive in corporate
assets) wring their hands and say
they just don't have the money
and they're just so sorry to "have
to" let her go. "Go" usually
means going to unemployment or
welfare and foodstamps, but then,
administrators are shielded from
these kinds of harsh realities.
This sort of "I'm your buddy"

approach is hard to fight and the
administration is clever enough to
know it. A few years ago they
would have re-affirmed their
"right" to lay off "surplus"
workers but they've learned that
being up-front like that only
serves to mobilize workers more.
After all, even if you're losing
your home and facing bill
collectors when you're laid-off,
how can you confront the
administrator responsible when
he's standing there next to you
sniveling?
Resources
It's important for Stanford
workers to realize several things.
First, Stanford has the resources
to re-hire Julia and to stop
lay-offs if it really wanted to.
Stanford has at least $5 billion in
assets. It is one of the wealthiest
institutions in the country and
ranks among the highest in
endowments.
The medical center, which is
laying off many of its workers,
has $9,000,000 alone for a new
wing, and departments such as
genetics which has "let" people go
are at the same time receiving
close to half a million in new
grants this year. No one can be so
