# Hargadon Rejects Bowdoin Plan To Eliminate SAT Requirement
## 
### JAMES LOBSENZ 
Stanford will not follow Bowdoin
College's lead in abolishing the SAT
(Scholastic Aptitude Test)
requirement, says Dean of Admissions
Fred A. Hargadon. Applicants for
undergraduate admissions must still
submit test scores with their
application.
Hargadon questions the desirability
of seeking an increase in the number
of applicants at the expense of
dropping admission requirements. "I
would question the value of a policy
that seeks to increase the number of

applicants just for the sake of having
more applications."
Hargadon points out that it is
impossible "to have a rigorous
fast-paced academic program without
a certain level of student ability," and
he feels that the SAT test is helpful in
evaluating an applicant's academic
potential.
Hargadon also draws attention to
the fact that while SAT scores are no
longer required by Bowdoin, they may
be submitted if the applicant wishes to
send them in. "What do they do
with these scores that are optionally
submitted?" asks Hargadon.
Faculty Poll
The Bowdoin decision to drop the
requirement was the result of a faculty
poll in which it was discovered that
the majority of students that faculty
members "liked" had SAT scores that
fell below the median score of the
Bowdoin student.
To further justify their decision to
abolish the SAT requirement the
college administration pointed out
that one Bowdoin student who
became a Rhodes scholar had scored
below the Bowdoin student median on
the SAT.
Hargadon feels that such an
example is fairly meaningless in that
such exceptions to the rule of SAT
accuracy can always be found, but
that on the whole the SAT scores,
"particularly at the extremes, are
really valuable."
Thus an applicant with a very low
SAT score can be reasonably expected
to fare poorly in a stringent academic
environment, and conversely, an
applicant with an unusually high score
can be reasonably expected to excell.
Cultural Bias?
The SAT has been criticized for
being culturally biased. George Jones,
the director of the NEA Center for
Human Relations, has charged that the
test is "subjecting minorities and the
disadvantaged to tests normed for the
white middle-class Northeast." Jones
goes so far as to maintain that the

widespread use of the SAT "violates
the civil rights to equal educational
opportunity" of these minority
people.
Hargadon states that "there is not a
great deal of evidence as yet" that
substantiates the claim of cultural bias.
In his opinion "minority students do
just as well on the test as non-minority
students."
The complaint that the SAT
frequently gives inaccurate
representations of a student's abilities
due the "freeze factor" meets with
little sympathy from Hargadon. The
"freeze factor" is a term for the
incidence of students "choking" on
the test because of great fears that the
test is "crucial" to their being
accepted at the college of their choice.
'No One Likes Tests'
"No one I know likes to take
tests," asserts Hargadon. "But if
choking on the SAT is the worst thing
that ever happens to a person in his

life, then he'll probably have a pretty
good life."
Hargadon believes that "students
tend to make more of the SAT than
colleges do. I know of no selective
college that completely ignores the
test scores, and I know of no selective
institution that relies solely upon
them."
In general, Hargadon holds that the
value of the SAT score in appraising an
applicant is that "it provides us with a
common ground on which to judge all
the applicants." Test scores are judged
against the known quality of the
school, the applicant's rank in class,
the applicant's teacher
recommendations and other factors.
But the SAT alone is a factor common
to everyone.
"It helps us objectify the data"
maintains Hargadon. "We don't know
if an 'A' in one school is equal to an
'A' in another school, but we do know
that an 800 verbal SAT score is the
same for everyone."

goes so far as to maintain that the

widespread use of the SAT "violates
the civil rights to equal educational

people.
Hargadon states that "there is not a
great deal of evidence as yet" that
substantiates the claim of cultural bias.
In his opinion "minority students do
just as well on the test as non-minority
students."
The complaint that the SAT
frequently gives inaccurate
representations of a student's abilities
due the "freeze factor" meets with
little sympathy from Hargadon. The
"freeze factor" is a term for the
incidence of students "choking" on
the test because of great fears that the
test is "crucial" to their being
accepted at the college of their choice.
'No One Likes Tests'
"No one I know likes to take
tests," asserts Hargadon. "But if
choking on the SAT is the worst thing
that ever happens to a person in his

life, then he'll probably have a pretty
good life."
Hargadon believes that "students
tend to make more of the SAT than
colleges do. I know of no selective
college that completely ignores the
test scores, and I know of no selective
institution that relies solely upon
them."
In general, Hargadon holds that the
value of the SAT score in appraising an
applicant is that "it provides us with a
common ground on which to judge all
the applicants." Test scores are judged
against the known quality of the
school, the applicant's rank in class,
the applicant's teacher
recommendations and other factors.
But the SAT alone is a factor common
to everyone.
"It helps us objectify the data"
maintains Hargadon. "We don't know
if an 'A' in one school is equal to an
'A' in another school, but we do know
that an 800 verbal SAT score is the
same for everyone."

SAT TO STAY — Dean of Admissions Fred Hargadon stated that his office
would retain the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) as a means of evaluating
undergraduate applicants. Thus, Stanford will not follow the lead of Bowdoin
College in dropping the test as a criterion for admissions.
Stanford will not follow Bowdoin
College's lead in abolishing the SAT
(Scholastic Aptitude Test)
requirement, says Dean of Admissions
Fred A. Hargadon. Applicants for
undergraduate admissions must still
submit test scores with their
application.
Hargadon questions the desirability
of seeking an increase in the number
of applicants at the expense of
dropping admission requirements. "I
would question the value of a policy
that seeks to increase the number of

applicants just for the sake of having
more applications."
Hargadon points out that it is
impossible "to have a rigorous
fast-paced academic program without
a certain level of student ability," and
he feels that the SAT test is helpful in
evaluating an applicant's academic
potential.
Hargadon also draws attention to
the fact that while SAT scores are no
longer required by Bowdoin, they may
be submitted if the applicant wishes to
send them in. "What do they do
with these scores that are optionally
submitted?" asks Hargadon.
Faculty Poll
The Bowdoin decision to drop the
requirement was the result of a faculty
poll in which it was discovered that
the majority of students that faculty
members "liked" had SAT scores that
fell below the median score of the
Bowdoin student.
To further justify their decision to
abolish the SAT requirement the
college administration pointed out
that one Bowdoin student who
became a Rhodes scholar had scored
below the Bowdoin student median on
the SAT.
Hargadon feels that such an
example is fairly meaningless in that
such exceptions to the rule of SAT
accuracy can always be found, but
that on the whole the SAT scores,
"particularly at the extremes, are
really valuable."
Thus an applicant with a very low
SAT score can be reasonably expected
to fare poorly in a stringent academic
environment, and conversely, an
applicant with an unusually high score
can be reasonably expected to excell.
Cultural Bias?
The SAT has been criticized for
being culturally biased. George Jones,
the director of the NEA Center for
Human Relations, has charged that the
test is "subjecting minorities and the
disadvantaged to tests normed for the
white middle-class Northeast." Jones
goes so far as to maintain that the

widespread use of the SAT "violates
the civil rights to equal educational
opportunity" of these minority
people.
