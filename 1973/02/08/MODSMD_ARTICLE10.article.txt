## 'Free Mick Goldstein' 
### 
April 21 Defense Collective

Last April 21, in response to
Nixon's continued bombing of
North Vietnam and his mining of
Hanoi and Haiphong Harbors,
many people at Stanford
demonstrated their opposition to
Nixon's foreign policies and their
support for the people of
Vietnam. This demonstration was
aimed, in part,, at Stanford's
complicity in the war. 205 people
were arrested for obstructing
traffic that afternoon after
marching through campus and
onto El Camino Real. These
people joined together to form
the "April 21 Defense Collective."
Mass arrests "here and elsewhere
serve even better than arrests of
individual leaders to keep political
dissenters on the defensive and to
drain the resources of the
"Movement." It was to fight this
tactic that the collective defense
was organized. Our defense was
successful largely due to Mick
Goldstein, a law student, who
provided a great deal of help, even
though he himself was not
arrested.
On October 6, 1972, Ronald
Beaty escaped from Chino prison.
Since then the legal arm of
Nixon's administration has been
conducting an intense
investigation of that break. Police
have arrested numerous people
named in Beaty's long story, told
to save his skin, although many of
those arrested have been released
uncharged or have had the charges
dropped. State and federal
authorities seem most interested in
blaming the Venceremos
organization for the escape,

although some of the people
arrested, like Mick, have no
connection with that
organization.
Innocent
While doing off-campus legal
study with the Navajo Legal
Services in Arizona, Mick and two
others were arrested and charged
with harboring Beaty in Arizona.
Mick is entirely innocent and
needs our support to fight his
case.
Attacks on Movement people
by the criminal injustice system
are being used as part of a strategy
to silence opposition to Nixon's
imperialist policies both at home
and abroad. If we do not expose
this tactic as repression, fight it
every time it is used, and unite to
protect its immediate victims, it
might develop into a strong
deterrent to our active
opposition to intolerable
government policies.
The April 21 Defense
Collective was successful in
fighting the mass bust tactic.
Because we decided to assert our
right to speedy trials, the
large-scale arrests caused an
official "judicial emergency."
Many people were forced to plead
guilty to jaywalking (!) so they
could leave the area for the
summer, but most of the rest of
us won acquittals or dismissals of
our charges by sticking together
and demanding jury trials.
Unite to Fight
We can defeat the current use
of large-scale, unjustified arrests if
we unite to fight them as well.
It is especially important that

members and friends of the April
21 Defense Collective join this
fight since Mick, who helped us
before, is now under attack. We
are calling a meeting for Tuesday,
February 13, at 7:30 p.m. in Serra
Lounge (Stern Hall) to support
Mick and to fight this current
repressive attack. Mick will detail
the success of the Defense
Collective and we will plan what
we can do to help toward a
people's victory in his case.
