One comment on Nanci
Col vert's article on costs and
tuition (Daily, Feb. 5). The
suggestion is made that the decline
in applications for admission in
1970-71 and 1971-72 could have
resulted from increased costs.
Perhaps. But the relationship
between applications and costs
should not be drawn too casually.
There are simply too many years
when both costs and applications
rise (as is the case this year, with
applications up about 6%).
Nor have I seen any evidence
that the socioeconomic mix of
either the applicant group, the
admitted group, or the enrolled
group has changed significantly
over the past few years Candidates

have been selected without regard
for ability to pay and
demonstrated need has been met
by financial aid in every case.
For what it's worth, the
decline in applications in the two
years mentioned might have been
caused in part by (a) an increase
in the application fee from $15 to
$20, (b) moving of the deadline
date for applying back from
February 1 to January 1, (c)
introduction of requirement of
three Achievement Tests, in
addition to the previously
required SAT's, or (d)
introduction of a two-step
application process, whereby the
supplementary papers are sent
only after a preliminary
application and the application
fee have been filed. Each of these
changes took effect in 1970-71.
Obviously, none of the above is
meant to allay concerns over
rising costs. Rather it is simply
meant to caution against too
superficially drawing evidence to
support those concerns.

Editor:
I was deeply touched by Larry
Diamond's accusation that the
Daily stance on the draft "smacks
of all the anti-libertarian
implications of the draft" (Daily,
Feb. 6).
Mr. Diamond, of course, is a
great believer in libertarianism and
free will. Witness, for example, his
efforts to rid the campus of
ROTC, even if some students
want to take it; his efforts to keep
DoD-contracted firms out of the
Placement Center, even if some
students want to interview with
them; his many campaigns for
coercive fee assessments.
And lastly, and perhaps most
relevantly, let's all remember Mr.
Diamond's great efforts in the
behalf of Congressional candidate
Jim Stewart—who told us many
times he wanted to retain the
draft in all its glory.

Stanford has once again found
the "need" to raise tuition for the
coming year. Students, whether
their malaise be apathy or a
feeling of helplessness, should
take the time to investigate what
their tuition is being spent for and
what criteria has been established
for such expenditures.
The transience of the Stanford
experience coupled with the "let
Daddy worry about it" syndrome
tends to minimize any
constructive work that can be
accomplished by groups such as
COST that endeavor to collect
information and provide a basis
for student influence in a matter
of fundamental importance ...
MONEY.
COST representatives and
members of the ASSU Senate
subcommittee on finances will
meet this Thursday with
administrators concerning tuition
increases and their relationship to
the University budget. Results of
the meeting will be published. It is
in the interest of all students to
keep themselves informed and be
prepared to voice an opinion to
keep the University responsive to
student needs and concerns. We

Stanford has once again found
the "need" to raise tuition for the
coming year. Students, whether
their malaise be apathy or a
feeling of helplessness, should
take the time to investigate what
their tuition is being spent for and
what criteria has been established
for such expenditures.
The transience of the Stanford
experience coupled with the "let
Daddy worry about it" syndrome
tends to minimize any
constructive work that can be
accomplished by groups such as
COST that endeavor to collect
information and provide a basis
for student influence in a matter
of fundamental importance ...
MONEY.
COST representatives and
members of the ASSU Senate
subcommittee on finances will
meet this Thursday with
administrators concerning tuition
increases and their relationship to
the University budget. Results of
the meeting will be published. It is
in the interest of all students to
keep themselves informed and be
prepared to voice an opinion to
keep the University responsive to
student needs and concerns. We
pay the bills.

One comment on Nanci
Col vert's article on costs and
tuition (Daily, Feb. 5). The
suggestion is made that the decline
in applications for admission in
1970-71 and 1971-72 could have
resulted from increased costs.
Perhaps. But the relationship
between applications and costs
should not be drawn too casually.
There are simply too many years
when both costs and applications
rise (as is the case this year, with
applications up about 6%).
Nor have I seen any evidence
that the socioeconomic mix of
either the applicant group, the
admitted group, or the enrolled
group has changed significantly
over the past few years Candidates

have been selected without regard
for ability to pay and
demonstrated need has been met
by financial aid in every case.
For what it's worth, the
decline in applications in the two
years mentioned might have been
caused in part by (a) an increase
in the application fee from $15 to
$20, (b) moving of the deadline
date for applying back from
February 1 to January 1, (c)
introduction of requirement of
three Achievement Tests, in
addition to the previously
required SAT's, or (d)
introduction of a two-step
application process, whereby the
supplementary papers are sent
only after a preliminary
application and the application
fee have been filed. Each of these
changes took effect in 1970-71.
Obviously, none of the above is
meant to allay concerns over
rising costs. Rather it is simply
meant to caution against too
superficially drawing evidence to
support those concerns.

I was deeply touched by Larry
Diamond's accusation that the
Daily stance on the draft "smacks
of all the anti-libertarian
implications of the draft" (Daily,
Feb. 6).
Mr. Diamond, of course, is a
great believer in libertarianism and
free will. Witness, for example, his
efforts to rid the campus of
ROTC, even if some students
want to take it; his efforts to keep
DoD-contracted firms out of the
Placement Center, even if some
students want to interview with
them; his many campaigns for
coercive fee assessments.
And lastly, and perhaps most
relevantly, let's all remember Mr.
Diamond's great efforts in the
behalf of Congressional candidate
Jim Stewart—who told us many
times he wanted to retain the
draft in all its glory.
