/'ue always heard that motorcycles are much more dangerous than
cars. Do you have any information that quantitatively indicates that
this is trueâ€”e.g. deaths/no. of miles traveled? B.L.
That sort of statistic is not kept by either the Stanford Police
Department or the State Highway Patrol. They did have information
on the number of accidents involving cars as opposed to motorcycles:
in 1971 there were 20,138 motorcyclists killed or injured in the state
of California, as opposed to 224,747 injuries or deaths from accidents
involving other vehicles. On the Stanford campus in 1972 there were
nine accidents involving motorcycles, about four percent of the 212
accidents that took place that year.
Just thinking about it, it would appear that motorcycles are not as
safe as cars. Because motorcycles have only two comparatively narrow
wheels, they are more likely to flip over or skid than cars are. Since
they are smaller, motorcycles are less visible than cars are. And
because motorcycles are "open," riders are less protected than people
in cars, which are enclosed.

1 am filling out summer job applications and need pictures of
myself on most of them. I would prefer not spending the $2.50 for
four pictures that the Stanford passport service offers. Do you know
of any drugstore in the vicinity that has one of those cheap machines
that takes four pictures for a quarter or 50 cents ? P.F.
There is a machine by the back entrance to the Woolworth's store
in the Stanford Shopping Center.

In your Jan. 19, 1973 column the following question was asked:
What was the name of Dudley Do-right's horse? Your reply was that it
did not have a name. Being interested in trivia and not wishing to have
false information dispensed, I beg to differ with you. The name of
Dudley Do-right's horse is Horse. (Yes, Horse.) M.B.

What is that apartment house-type building behind the Faculty
Club, next to Harmony House? Who owns it? Who lives there? J.D.
The apartment complex is called Kingscote Gardens and is
privately owned by the estate of one Sarah Howard. Mrs. Howard,
widow of a Stanford professor, received permission and built the
house in 1917 to accommodate faculty and staff. Today, the building
is managed by Palo Alto real estate firm Hare, Brewer & Kelley Inc.
According to property manager, Tom Barrie, the apartment is a "most
unusual complex" in that it is the "only apartment house on campus
for everybody." Residents include American and international
students, retired and active faculty members and others affiliated with
the university.

I'd really like to see a centralized LOST AND FOUND office on
campus. I never know what to do with books, bikes or bagels that I
find. Or lose. What's the procedure for getting an office like this
established? S.H.
There is no set procedure for establishing such an office. One
possible approach would be through the ASSU Senate. You might
find a senator willing to introduce legislation along those lines. A
more direct way, suggested by Dale Snape, Assistant to the Dean of
Student Affairs, is to contact either Jean Martin, Program Adviser or
Roger Thacker, Office Assistant at Tresidder, about establishing a
central campus office at Tresidder.
At present, Police Services considers itself the only official LOST
AND FOUND. Although the Information desk at Tresidder and the
circulation desks at both libraries are popular drop-off points for lost
items, they return all such items to the police after a certain time
period.
