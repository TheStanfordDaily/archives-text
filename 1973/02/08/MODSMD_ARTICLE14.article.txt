# Eye Bank Program Grows

New sight for the blind, once a
medical dream, is now a reality
for some 1,500 Americans every
year, thanks to the Eye Bank
program.
The Stanford Hospital Eye
Bank, one of the largest suppliers
of human eyes for transplant in
the West, provides the vital cornea
to patients as far away as
Stockton.
Transportation is a key to a
successful eye transplant, since

the cornea is usable for only 24
hours after the death of the
donor.
For over a year, the Cambrian
Park Lions Club in San Jose has
provided the needed
transportation, covering more
than 5,600 miles to move more
than 125 eyes for transplant,
according to Paul Graton, head of
the Lions Club project.
Rapid Routine
The chain of events following
the death of an eye donor is a

practiced, rapid routine. Dr.
Mathea Allansmith, head of the
Eye Bank here, said the cornea
must be removed within six hours
of death.
Hospitals notify the Eye Bank
immediately upon a patient's
death. If Stanford does not have a
candidate for a transplant, the
Eye Bank will notify another
surgeon who can use the eyes.
Then a Lions Club member is
notified, and the race against the
clock begins. A member, on
round-the-clock call, rushes the
eye in a special container to its
destination, possibly miles away.
Allansmith, a specialist in
immunology and eye diseases, said
the club's services are a
tremendous help to the Eye Bank,
which runs on a minimal budget.
25 Percent Fail
Unlike the more heralded heart
and kidney transplants, a cornea
transplant is usually successful,
with only 25 percent of
transplanted corneas failing to
take, Allansmith said.
She explained that a large
number of transplants are done
for a condition called
keratoconus, which causes the
cornea to bulge and become
cone-shaped. The condition is
common in young adults and
commonly affects both eyes.
The cornea, a clear cover over
the eye which lets in the light,
does not have to be typed and
cross-matched, although at
Stanford they are typed.
Corneas can come from
patients of all ages even if they
wear glasses, have cancer of
cataracts, Allansmith said. "As
long as the cornea is clear and
undamaged," it can be used," she
explained.
