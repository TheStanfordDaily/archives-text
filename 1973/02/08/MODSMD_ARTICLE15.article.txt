# Stanford Grad Named New Finance Director
## 
### 
Rodney H. Adams, 34, has
been named director of finance
here, effective immediately.
His promotion reflects the
University's increased emphasis on
management of its financial
resources, according to
Vice-President Robert R.
Augsburger.
Holder of two Stanford degrees
(B.S. in mechanical engineering
1960 and MBA 1962), Adams
joined the University staff in 1965
after working with Standard Oil
of California and Granger
Associates.
During the past year, he
developed the idea and
mechanisms for loaning portfolio
securities, an operation which is
now producing incremental
income at a rate of several
hundred thousand dollars
annually.
He also was influential in
getting the California State
Legislature to enact an
Educational Facilities

Authority, which will enable
Stanford and other private
institutions to obtain long-term
financing through public securities
markets at tax-exempt interest
rates.
He currently is working on
legislative adoption of a proposed
Uniform Investment Management
Act. This would authorize full
delegation of investment
responsibilities to professionals
and permit universities to follow a
"total return" concept in
investments, incorporating both
dividend income and capital gains.
As director of finance he will
play a key role in management of
Stanford's $346 million
endowment, venture capital
investments, financial institutional
relations, external financing, and
the University's technology
licensing program.
He also will be responsible for
determining the most efficient
methods for financing facilities
improvements, student loans, and
employee benefit programs.
