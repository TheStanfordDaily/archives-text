# Soil 'Creep' Perils Hillside Homes
## 
### 
Anyone building on a
California hillside—even one with
a low slope—should give careful
thought to the possibility of soil
"creep" on his lot if he wants to
avoid cracked walls and costly
repairs in the future, a University
geology report suggests.
In 18 months of tests on two
gently sloping hillsides, a kind of
silty clay soil, usually called
adobe, which is common to
California was found to ooze
downhill as much as one and a
half inches during wet winter
months. The results of such creep
are frequently seen in
once-upright rows of fenceposts
and power poles that now lean
over drunkenly.
The study was made on hilly
Stanford and Menlo Park lands by
a former graduate student, Robert
W. Fleming of Livermore, as a
partial requirement for his
doctoral degree. Fleming is now
an assistant professor of geology
at the University of Cincinnati.
His research was supported mainly
by the Army's Cold Regions
Research and Engineering
Laboratories.
"The soil is dark-colored,
composed of 30 percent fine sand,
30 percent silt, and 40 percent
clay-sized [ultrafine] particles,"
said Fleming. "It is highly

expansive and the predominant
clay mineral is montmorillonite."
Geologists add that it is an
almost "indestructible" soil, the
product of volcanic eruptions
20-30 million years ago. Although
it has been buried in the earth
since, it keeps reappearing
unchanged on the surface,
indicating that "even nature can't
get rid of it."
Homes near Fleming's study

sites have sustained damage from
the soil creep. In one Menlo Park
house the damage was so severe
that after seven years it became
necessary to move the house,
rebuild its foundations on
bedrock, then move it back into
place.
On a slope of only eight
degrees, or a drop of about one
foot in ten, soil five feet deep at
the test sites moved an average of

half an inch each year at the
surface, Fleming reported. Creep
lessened with depth to become
almost imperceptible near
bedrock. The amount of surface
creep varied with soil depth and
pitch of the slope.
Nearly all the soil movement
came with the onset of winter
rains in December, January and
February. The greatest movement
occurred at the start, just as soon

as the soil absorbed 20-30 percent
of its weight in water. Continued
wetting did not cause further
creep, however,
Huge Cracks
During the dry period from
April to November the soil
shrank, opening up huge cracks in
the ground familiar to most
Californians. With the return of
winter rains the creep began again,
quickly at first and then slowing
to a halt.
The drying cycle appears to be
very important in the creep
process, Fleming said. He
theorizes that the tiny clay
particles rearrange themselves as
the water content decreases in
such a way as to give little
resistance to deformation of the
soil structure when the next
wetting comes.
With rewetting the soil deforms
readily at first under the force of
gravity. But the wet soil particles
soon settle into new, more stable
positions and the soil creep slows.
Another drying cycle is then
required to set the stage for
further wetting and creep.
Fleming plans to continue the
research in collaboration with his
former teacher, Stanford geology
Prof. Arvid M. Johnson. They
plan to include comparisons of
soil creep at both the Stanford
and Cincinnati areas.
A more important objective,
perhaps, will be to develop a
theoretical "model" of soil creep
that engineers can use to
estimate how much effect the soil
movement will have on a given
structure in a given spot.
"In order to design structures
that will resist damage by creeping
soil," say the geologists,
"engineers tell us they need to
know certain things about creep.
How much lateral pressure will
the soil exert on the foundation?
What practical measures can be
taken to reduce creep?"

very important in the creep
process, Fleming said. He
theorizes that the tiny clay
particles rearrange themselves as
the water content decreases in
such a way as to give little
resistance to deformation of the
soil structure when the next
wetting comes.
With rewetting the soil deforms
readily at first under the force of
gravity. But the wet soil particles
soon settle into new, more stable
positions and the soil creep slows.
Another drying cycle is then
required to set the stage for
further wetting and creep.
Fleming plans to continue the
research in collaboration with his
former teacher, Stanford geology
Prof. Arvid M. Johnson. They
plan to include comparisons of
soil creep at both the Stanford
and Cincinnati areas.
A more important objective,
perhaps, will be to develop a
theoretical "model" of soil creep
that engineers can use to
estimate how much effect the soil
movement will have on a given
structure in a given spot.
"In order to design structures
that will resist damage by creeping
soil," say the geologists,
"engineers tell us they need to
know certain things about creep.
How much lateral pressure will
the soil exert on the foundation?
What practical measures can be
taken to reduce creep?"


CREEPING HILLSIDES—Former geology student Robert Fleming, right, and Ansel Johnson have found
that some adobe moves downhill as much as one and a half inches per year.
Anyone building on a
California hillside—even one with
a low slope—should give careful
thought to the possibility of soil
"creep" on his lot if he wants to
avoid cracked walls and costly
repairs in the future, a University
geology report suggests.
In 18 months of tests on two
gently sloping hillsides, a kind of
silty clay soil, usually called
adobe, which is common to
California was found to ooze
downhill as much as one and a
half inches during wet winter
months. The results of such creep
are frequently seen in
once-upright rows of fenceposts
and power poles that now lean
over drunkenly.
The study was made on hilly
Stanford and Menlo Park lands by
a former graduate student, Robert
W. Fleming of Livermore, as a
partial requirement for his
doctoral degree. Fleming is now
an assistant professor of geology
at the University of Cincinnati.
His research was supported mainly
by the Army's Cold Regions
Research and Engineering
Laboratories.
"The soil is dark-colored,
composed of 30 percent fine sand,
30 percent silt, and 40 percent
clay-sized [ultrafine] particles,"
said Fleming. "It is highly

expansive and the predominant
clay mineral is montmorillonite."
Geologists add that it is an
almost "indestructible" soil, the
product of volcanic eruptions
20-30 million years ago. Although
it has been buried in the earth
since, it keeps reappearing
unchanged on the surface,
indicating that "even nature can't
get rid of it."
Homes near Fleming's study

sites have sustained damage from
the soil creep. In one Menlo Park
house the damage was so severe
that after seven years it became
necessary to move the house,
rebuild its foundations on
bedrock, then move it back into
place.
On a slope of only eight
degrees, or a drop of about one
foot in ten, soil five feet deep at
the test sites moved an average of

half an inch each year at the
surface, Fleming reported. Creep
lessened with depth to become
almost imperceptible near
bedrock. The amount of surface
creep varied with soil depth and
pitch of the slope.
Nearly all the soil movement
came with the onset of winter
rains in December, January and
February. The greatest movement
occurred at the start, just as soon

as the soil absorbed 20-30 percent
of its weight in water. Continued
wetting did not cause further
creep, however,
Huge Cracks
During the dry period from
April to November the soil
shrank, opening up huge cracks in
the ground familiar to most
Californians. With the return of
winter rains the creep began again,
quickly at first and then slowing
to a halt.
The drying cycle appears to be
very important in the creep
process, Fleming said. He
theorizes that the tiny clay

the water content decreases in
such a way as to give little
