# McGovern Gets Student Vote

SACRAMENTO (AP) - Sen.
George McGovern got an
estimated 58 percent of the
California student vote even
though President Nixon carried
the state with a million-vote
plurality, a University of
California research team reported
yesterday.
Students engaged in
ticket-splitting just as their
parents did and—for
instance—voted heavily for
Republican state Sen. Milton
Marks and Congressman Paul N.
McCloskey.
When it came to ballot
measures, a sampling of UC
campus voting precincts showed
that the coastline initiative was a
more popular issue than the
proposal to legalize marijuana
smoking. The team developed a
Campus Political Attitudes
Index-CPA-from the results of the
1972 election, the first in which
citizens aged 18, 19 and 20 could
participate fully for the first time.

UC Santa Cruz was judged the
most liberal of the nine UC
campuses while Sonoma State was
reported most liberal in the
19-campus California State
University and Colleges system.
Occidental College was the
most liberal of seven private
schools surveyed while Santa
Clara was most conservative.
The study was written by
Bruce Fuller, Mike Gilson and

Linda Bond, all members of the
UC Student Lobby in
Sacramento.
The study was based on an
interview of 54,000 students from
40 California colleges and
universities.
The authors emphasizeed the
study was not all-inconclusive as it
did not include sampling of voting
attitudes by newly enfranchised
community college and high
school students.
Hardest Workers Supported
The study showed that the
greatest student support for state
candidates, such as for the
legislature, went to those who
worked hardest for that support.
"None of these candidates
presumed for one moment that
they would corner the student
vote without working very, very
hard for it,"the authors said.
Figures showed UC students
voted 92 percent for Prop. 20, the
coastline conservation initiative
which passed, compared with 83
percent for Prop. 19, the
marijuana initiative which failed.
But the measure that got the
most support was Prop. 2, a bond

issue for construction of UC
medical teaching facilities which
also passed.
CSUC students, more
conservative in their voting
patterns, voted 83 percent for
Prop. 20 and 72 percent for the
marijuana measure.
Adults had a better turn-out
record at the polls but about 80
percent of all college and
university students registered to
vote.
