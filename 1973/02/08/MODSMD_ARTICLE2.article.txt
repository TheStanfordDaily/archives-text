# Mirrielees Flooded By Stray Frisbee
## 
### 
A misthrown Frisbee last night
broke a first-floor sprinkler head,
flooding a hallway and 12 adjoining
rooms in Mirrielees House.
The offending Frisbee, a red, white,
and blue "All-American" model, was
consigned to the floor of a sodden
room after breaking the fusible link in
a hallway sprinkler head and tripping
the system.
Its three accomplices sat unhappily
nearby, apologizing to their neighbors
for the two inches of water that
covered hallway carpets and seeped
into carpeted bedrooms and tiled
kitchens.
Firemen shut down the main
sprinkler control valve as soon as they
arrived at the water-flow alarm, but
the broken head had already sprayed
25 gallons of water per minute into
the hallway.
Large amounts of water continued
to drain from piping in the four-story
building for 45 minutes, however,
because firemen did not have a key to
the boiler-room, where other valves
and drains are located.
A maintenance man finally arrived
from Sunnyvale after the system had
drained almost completely, and
firemen activated the main drain to
divert water from the broken head.
According to Fire Captain Don
Dudak, firemen could have minimized
water damage by draining the system
quickly, but they lacked a key to the
boiler-room because of a "bureaucratic
foul-up."
Several firefighters tried
unsuccessfully to pry open the
boiler-room door with small crowbars
and halligan tools. The door and its
hinges withstood their efforts,
splintering slightly without yielding.
They gave up after failing to receive
permission to cut through the door
with a torch or power saw, which one
fireman said would take "about thirty
seconds."
Water seeped under dry
plasterboard walls into every room on
the hall, spreading the stench of wet,
already-molding carpets throughout
the north wing of Mirrielees.
Firemen mopped up the water with
special vacuum cleaners, pushed it out
doorways with large rubber squeegees,
and used inch-and-a-half hose to
improvise drains for the sprinkler
piping.
