Interested in consumer protection? The Stanford Daily has
created a new department of Consumer Affairs and is looking for
students interested in doing investigative reporting in this field.
There will be an organizational meeting today at 3:30 p.m. in the
Daily editorial office. Both writers and researchers are needed.
