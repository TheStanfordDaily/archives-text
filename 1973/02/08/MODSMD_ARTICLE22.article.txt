# Winters Gives 'High Energy' Show
## 
### JAY HARLOW 
As I walked into Winterland Saturday night to
hear Edgar Winter, Grin, and Earthquake, I
suddenly felt as if I were in a flashback to the late
1960'5. I could have sworn I was hearing Janis
Joplin with Big Brother and the Holding Company.
In fact, it was a band that had not been on the
advance bill. Their name was Pearl (not
coincidentally, the name of Janis' last album), and
the resemblance to Big Brother was complete.
The lead singer used exactly the same type of
phrasing and tonal qualities as Janis, and the lead
guitarist had Sam Andrews' solos down pat. It is one
thing to imitate another band's style, but I have
never heard such a precise replication before. As a
finale, they did "Piece of My Heart," which was
virtually indistinguishable from the recorded
version. Unoriginal, but interesting.
Earthquake, a Berkeley band, was next. This
band is essentially a bunch of non-stars trying to be
superstars. All of the elements were
there—sex-symbol lead singer, gymnastic lead
guitarist, and so on—but it just didn't come off too
well. Their sophisticated lyrics included such
masterpieces as "Do It," -'Shake Your Tail," and"I
Feel Too Good."
Crowd Eats It Up
They're not really bad, it's just that there are
hundreds of bands just like Earthquake (some of
them better) playing high school dances everywhere.
So who wants to hear a high school dance band at
Winterland? Obviously someone does, because the
Winterland crowd, with its usual impeccable taste,
ate it up.
Grin was billed as featuring Nils Lofgren, a
guitarist who has played backup on solo albums by
people like Stephen Stills. He now has his own
band, which is competent but not too exciting. The
brightest moments were his duets with the other
guitarist, including one number where they faced
one another, each fingering his own guitar while
picking the other's.
Once or twice they tried some mellower music
with Lofgren on the piano, but were almost
drowned out by rowdies in the audience shouting
for Edgar Winter. So, they finished with some more

rock, complete with Lofgren doing flips on stage off
a mini-trampoline.
Following the usual announcements and Bugs
Bunny cartoons, the Edgar Winter Band took the
stage. Backed up by Ronnie Montrose on guitar,
Dan Hartman on bass, and Chuck Ruff on drums,
Winter came on playing an ARP synthesizer
keyboard which hung on a strap around his neck.
He also played alto sax on some numbers, as well as
helping the drummer out on timbales from time to
time.
Wide Sound Range
He achieved quite a range of sounds from the
ARP, from fairly conventional electric piano to
wierd electronic manipulations. At one point he laid
it down on the stage, took a few steps back and
pounced on the keys for a while, then spent a few
minutes at the controls, rendering all sorts of sounds
from the machine.
Most of the time, however, he stuck to
piano-style accompaniment and leads. Vocal duties
were shared by Winter and Hartman, who also
pitched in on guitar once or twice. The rest of the
time, the guitar work was handled expertly by
Montrose, one of the best I have heard.
On a long version of "Tobacco Road" he and
Winter squared off, eyeball to eyeball, "talking" to
each other, matching guitar and vocal licks. They
finished their set with an old rock & roll standard,
"New Orleans."
The audience, which had not sat down once since
the band first came on, demanded an encore, so the
band returned with "Rock & Roll Boogie Woogie
Blues" from their newest album, "They Only Come
Out at Night." A second ovation brought them on
again, this time with another new tune,
"Undercover Man."
An acquaintance of mine, himself a musician,
describes Edgar Winter's style as "high-energy
music," which seems to me accurate. Whether they
are playing blues, hard rock, or experimental
sounds, this band is not intended for casual
background music. Rather, the listener is engulfed
in the music and overpowered, and eventually
released. Nearly everyone at Winterland was eager to
dive in again and again.

released. Nearly everyone at Winterland was eager to
dive in again and again.

House at 8:30 on February 12-13, 17-20, and 24-25. Matinee performances at 2:30 will be given on
February 19 and 25. The company will perform at the Flint Center on February 15 and 16 at 8:30, at
the Berkeley Community Theater on February 22 at 8:30 and at Memorial Auditorium in Sacramento on

As I walked into Winterland Saturday night to
hear Edgar Winter, Grin, and Earthquake, I
suddenly felt as if I were in a flashback to the late
1960'5. I could have sworn I was hearing Janis
Joplin with Big Brother and the Holding Company.
In fact, it was a band that had not been on the
advance bill. Their name was Pearl (not
coincidentally, the name of Janis' last album), and
the resemblance to Big Brother was complete.
The lead singer used exactly the same type of
phrasing and tonal qualities as Janis, and the lead
guitarist had Sam Andrews' solos down pat. It is one
thing to imitate another band's style, but I have
never heard such a precise replication before. As a
finale, they did "Piece of My Heart," which was
virtually indistinguishable from the recorded
version. Unoriginal, but interesting.
Earthquake, a Berkeley band, was next. This
band is essentially a bunch of non-stars trying to be
superstars. All of the elements were
there—sex-symbol lead singer, gymnastic lead
guitarist, and so on—but it just didn't come off too
well. Their sophisticated lyrics included such
masterpieces as "Do It," -'Shake Your Tail," and"I
Feel Too Good."
Crowd Eats It Up
They're not really bad, it's just that there are
hundreds of bands just like Earthquake (some of
them better) playing high school dances everywhere.
So who wants to hear a high school dance band at
Winterland? Obviously someone does, because the
Winterland crowd, with its usual impeccable taste,
ate it up.
Grin was billed as featuring Nils Lofgren, a
guitarist who has played backup on solo albums by
people like Stephen Stills. He now has his own
band, which is competent but not too exciting. The
brightest moments were his duets with the other
guitarist, including one number where they faced
one another, each fingering his own guitar while
picking the other's.
Once or twice they tried some mellower music
with Lofgren on the piano, but were almost
drowned out by rowdies in the audience shouting
for Edgar Winter. So, they finished with some more

rock, complete with Lofgren doing flips on stage off
a mini-trampoline.
Following the usual announcements and Bugs
Bunny cartoons, the Edgar Winter Band took the
stage. Backed up by Ronnie Montrose on guitar,
Dan Hartman on bass, and Chuck Ruff on drums,
Winter came on playing an ARP synthesizer
keyboard which hung on a strap around his neck.
He also played alto sax on some numbers, as well as
helping the drummer out on timbales from time to
time.
Wide Sound Range
He achieved quite a range of sounds from the
ARP, from fairly conventional electric piano to
wierd electronic manipulations. At one point he laid
it down on the stage, took a few steps back and
pounced on the keys for a while, then spent a few
minutes at the controls, rendering all sorts of sounds
from the machine.
Most of the time, however, he stuck to
piano-style accompaniment and leads. Vocal duties
were shared by Winter and Hartman, who also
pitched in on guitar once or twice. The rest of the
time, the guitar work was handled expertly by
Montrose, one of the best I have heard.
On a long version of "Tobacco Road" he and
Winter squared off, eyeball to eyeball, "talking" to
each other, matching guitar and vocal licks. They
finished their set with an old rock & roll standard,
"New Orleans."
The audience, which had not sat down once since
the band first came on, demanded an encore, so the
band returned with "Rock & Roll Boogie Woogie
Blues" from their newest album, "They Only Come
Out at Night." A second ovation brought them on
again, this time with another new tune,
"Undercover Man."
An acquaintance of mine, himself a musician,
describes Edgar Winter's style as "high-energy
music," which seems to me accurate. Whether they
are playing blues, hard rock, or experimental
sounds, this band is not intended for casual
background music. Rather, the listener is engulfed
in the music and overpowered, and eventually
released. Nearly everyone at Winterland was eager to
dive in again and again.

finished their set with an old rock & roll standard,
"New Orleans."
The audience, which had not sat down once since
the band first came on, demanded an encore, so the
band returned with "Rock & Roll Boogie Woogie
Blues" from their newest album, "They Only Come
Out at Night." A second ovation brought them on
again, this time with another new tune,
"Undercover Man."
An acquaintance of mine, himself a musician,
describes Edgar Winter's style as "high-energy
music," which seems to me accurate. Whether they
are playing blues, hard rock, or experimental
sounds, this band is not intended for casual
background music. Rather, the listener is engulfed
in the music and overpowered, and eventually
released. Nearly everyone at Winterland was eager to
dive in again and again.
