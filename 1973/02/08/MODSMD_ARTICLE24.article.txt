General Strike Grips Ulster
BELFAST — Protestant mobs and a general strike
by Protestant workers threw Belfast into disarray
yesterday, and a new spasm of terror took five lives.
Four of the dead were civilians, and the fifth was
a fireman shot down by a sniper as he fought a blaze
in Belfast's Shaftesbury Square. Police said the
civilians had not been identified.
The killings raised the death toll of violence in
the British province to 717 in 3 x h years.
Militant Protestant strike leaders, in a statement
late yesterday, threatened "massive conflict" unless
Britain meets demands that include revival of the
suspended provincial parliament and tougher tactics
against the outlawed Irish Republican Army.
The strike, enforced in part through intimidation
by Protestant militants, was obeyed by all but an
estimated 100,000 of the province's 600,000
workers, labor sources said.
The one-day work stoppage caused electrical
blackouts and disrupted public transportation,
closed factories, newspapers and shops and cut into
milk and bread supplies.
The strike was called to protest the detention of
two Protestants after a grenade attack on a busload
of Catholics last week and to demand restoration of
the provincial parliament. That body was suspended
when Britain imposed direct rule last March.
Senate Sets Watergate Probe
WASHINGTON — The Senate yesterday rejected

Republican attempts to broaden the scope and
revise the membership of a proposed special
committee to investigate the Watergate bugging
incident.
The proposal stems from the bugging and
break-in at the Democratic Party's Watergate
building offices last June.
GOP senators said the Democrats were seeking to
cover up their own misdeeds by confining the probe
to the 1972 election, saying, without citing
specifics, that the Democrats had bugged them in
the 1964 and 1968 campaigns.
But the Senate rejected, 44 to 32, a proposal to
broaden the probe to cover the last three
presidential elections.
On two separate tries, the Senate rejected
amendments to add a third Republican to the
proposed panel scheduled to have three Democrats
and two Republicans. Then, the Senate agreed to a
proposal to increase the size of the panel to seven
members, with four Democrats and three
Republicans.
At the White House meanwhile, press secretary
Ronald L. Ziegler said the White House would
cooperate with the Senate investigation as long as
the probe is "not partisan in nature."
Kissinger Departs For Indochina
WASHINGTON — Henry A. Kissinger left for
Thailand yesterday on a multi-purpose Vietnam
postwar mission which will climax with visits to

Hanoi and Peking.
Shortly after Kissinger headed for Bangkok,
White House press secretary Ronald L. Ziegler
reaffirmed that the presidential adviser will stop
over in Vientiane tomorrow to discuss prospects for
a cease-fire in Laos.
Prime Minister Souvanna Phouma, with whom
Kissinger is to dine tomorrow night, is optimistic
about reaching a cease-fire agreement with the
Communist Pathet Lao in about a week.
Settlements in Laos and Cambodia would be, in
the view of U.S. officials, of major help in carrying
through the Jan. 27 Paris pact for an end to the war
in Vietnam.
Kissinger is to fly from Vientiane to Hanoi
Saturday morning for. four days of talks with North
Vietnamese leaders on postwar relations, including
U.S.-North Vietnamese reconciliation and the
rebuilding of Indochina's torn country.
Congress Clashes With Nixon
WASHINGTON — President Nixon lost an opening
round in his multibillion-dollar spending bout with
Congress as the House voted yesterday to force him
to give the farmer 65 cents a day to save America's
soil.
The vote was 251 to 142.
Today's Weather
Partly cloudy through tomorrow with chance of few
showers. Low tonight in 40s. High both days upper
50s. Variable wind 5 to 15 mph.

the 1964 and 1968 campaigns.
But the Senate rejected, 44 to 32, a proposal to
broaden the probe to cover the last three
presidential elections.
On two separate tries, the Senate rejected
amendments to add a third Republican to the
proposed panel scheduled to have three Democrats
and two Republicans. Then, the Senate agreed to a
proposal to increase the size of the panel to seven
members, with four Democrats and three
Republicans.
At the White House meanwhile, press secretary
Ronald L. Ziegler said the White House would
cooperate with the Senate investigation as long as
the probe is "not partisan in nature."
Kissinger Departs For Indochina
WASHINGTON — Henry A. Kissinger left for
Thailand yesterday on a multi-purpose Vietnam
postwar mission which will climax with visits to

Hanoi and Peking.
Shortly after Kissinger headed for Bangkok,
White House press secretary Ronald L. Ziegler
reaffirmed that the presidential adviser will stop
over in Vientiane tomorrow to discuss prospects for
a cease-fire in Laos.
Prime Minister Souvanna Phouma, with whom
Kissinger is to dine tomorrow night, is optimistic
about reaching a cease-fire agreement with the
Communist Pathet Lao in about a week.
Settlements in Laos and Cambodia would be, in
the view of U.S. officials, of major help in carrying
through the Jan. 27 Paris pact for an end to the war
in Vietnam.
Kissinger is to fly from Vientiane to Hanoi
Saturday morning for. four days of talks with North
Vietnamese leaders on postwar relations, including
U.S.-North Vietnamese reconciliation and the
rebuilding of Indochina's torn country.
Congress Clashes With Nixon
WASHINGTON — President Nixon lost an opening
round in his multibillion-dollar spending bout with
Congress as the House voted yesterday to force him
to give the farmer 65 cents a day to save America's
soil.
The vote was 251 to 142.
Today's Weather
Partly cloudy through tomorrow with chance of few
showers. Low tonight in 40s. High both days upper
50s. Variable wind 5 to 15 mph.
General Strike Grips Ulster
BELFAST — Protestant mobs and a general strike
by Protestant workers threw Belfast into disarray
yesterday, and a new spasm of terror took five lives.
Four of the dead were civilians, and the fifth was
a fireman shot down by a sniper as he fought a blaze
in Belfast's Shaftesbury Square. Police said the
civilians had not been identified.
The killings raised the death toll of violence in
the British province to 717 in 3 x h years.
Militant Protestant strike leaders, in a statement
late yesterday, threatened "massive conflict" unless
Britain meets demands that include revival of the
suspended provincial parliament and tougher tactics
against the outlawed Irish Republican Army.
The strike, enforced in part through intimidation
by Protestant militants, was obeyed by all but an
estimated 100,000 of the province's 600,000
workers, labor sources said.
The one-day work stoppage caused electrical
blackouts and disrupted public transportation,
closed factories, newspapers and shops and cut into
milk and bread supplies.
The strike was called to protest the detention of
two Protestants after a grenade attack on a busload
of Catholics last week and to demand restoration of
the provincial parliament. That body was suspended
when Britain imposed direct rule last March.
Senate Sets Watergate Probe
WASHINGTON — The Senate yesterday rejected

Republican attempts to broaden the scope and
revise the membership of a proposed special
committee to investigate the Watergate bugging
incident.
The proposal stems from the bugging and
break-in at the Democratic Party's Watergate
building offices last June.
GOP senators said the Democrats were seeking to
cover up their own misdeeds by confining the probe
to the 1972 election, saying, without citing
specifics, that the Democrats had bugged them in
the 1964 and 1968 campaigns.
But the Senate rejected, 44 to 32, a proposal to
