# 'Papers' Judge Drops One Ellsberg Charge
## 
### 
The judge in the "Pentagon Papers"
trial in Los Angeles penalized
government prosecutors yesterday by
in effect ordering one of the espionage
charges against Daniel Ellsberg
dropped.
U.S. District Court Judge Matt
Byrne Jr. ordered the government not
to present evidence that could
demonstrate that the release of a study
of the 1954 Geneva Convention could
have endangered the national defense
in 1969.
Byrne described his order as the
"first" of a series of measures he will
take against the government for
suppressing State and Defense
Department analyses that Ellsberg and
Anthony J. Russo Jr. could use to
demonstrate their innocence.
By precluding government
testimony on this particular espionage
count, one of six against Ellsberg,
Byme reduced Ellsberg's maximum
possible sentence from 115 to 110
years.
Byrne also rebuked prosecutor
David Nissen for "advising" several
important government witnesses not

to talk with defense lawyers.
During part of his
cross-examination Tuesday, Army
Brig. Gen. Paul F. Gorman, a
Harvard-trained intelligence and
international relations expert,
conceded that he had been advised not
to talk with defense counsel by Nissen
and Army lawyers.
Byrne offered to recess the trial
immediately to allow Gorman to talk
with defense attorneys, but Gorman
forcefully and repeatedly refused to
do so. Gorman said his decision was
his own and that he was not
influenced by Nissen's advice.
Although he denied a defense
motion to strike Gorman's testimony
from the record, Byrne read Gorman
laws governing witnesses'
conversations with opposing counsel as
well as sections of the American Bar
Association's cannons dealing with the
same subject.
Byrne also ordered Nissen to bring
to court every government witness to
whom he gave similar advice. Byrne
said he would read them the same
material he read Gorman yesterday.
