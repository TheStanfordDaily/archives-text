# Negotiations Resume
## 
### 
Negotiations between the University and the Stanford Department of
Public Safety Officers Association (SDPSOA) over police reorganization —
deadlocked since mid-December — were resumed yesterday, it was
reported.
KZSU News said unnamed SDPSOA negotiators met with University
counsel Doug Barton, and that both sides submitted new proposals in an
effort to end the stalemate.
Barton declined to say last night what the new plans contained. He said
only that there will be further meetings between the two sides.
Negotiations were broken off when the two sides could not reach
agreement over what form the proposed elevation of some Stanford
officers to peace officer status would take.
