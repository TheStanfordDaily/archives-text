# Many Feared Dead In Alameda As Jet Crashes Into Apartments

By JIM WASCHER
A Navy A-7 Corsair jet fighter
crashed into a 36-unit apartment
building in Alameda last night. The
building housed at least 80 people and
authorities reported early this morning
that most were missing and feared
dead.
The crash reduced the building to
rubble and a spokesman for the
Alameda Fire Department said it was
still in flames nearly four hours after
the 8:25 p.m. crash. The spokesman
added that two and perhaps three
other apartment buildings adjacent to
the crash site were also on fire.

Witnesses say a fireball shot
hundreds of feet into the air after the
jet slammed into the top of the
wooden, three-story structure and
exploded. Flames were visible from
rooftops in downtown Oakland and
from the San Francisco-Oakland Bay
Bridge.
The crash was within two miles of
the Alameda Naval Air Station.
The Associated Press reported that
a young woman sitting on a porch
across the street from the crash site
said, "There were two big explosions.
The ground kind of shook. I went
blank for a moment and then I looked

over there. There just wasn't a building
there any more. Then there was a fire
and people screaming."
'Flames On The Wing'
Another witness told the A.P. that
he saw the jet come in "with flames on
the wing, hit the place and explode."
Rev. Milton Geyer of the Baptist
Church of Alameda, who lives across
the street from the scene at 1809
Central, said, "My wife and I saw
people hollering for help from the
third floor. I think only a small
percentage could have gotten out."
Navy journalist Jack Lee of the
Alameda Air Station's Press

Information Office said a single-seat
Navy A-7 Corsair jet assigned to the
Lemoore Naval Air Station near
Fresno was missing on an evening
flight to Sacramento.
Although the jet was not scheduled
to land at Alameda, it "was to have
passed over Oakland," according to
Lee. He identified the pilot of the
missing plane as Lt. Robert Lee Ward
of Lemoore, but added that he was
"unable to confirm that the missing
plane is the one that crashed in
Alameda."
22 Treated
Alameda Hospital spokesman Joyce
Jacobsen said 16 people, including one
fireman, had been treated there as a
result of the crash. She added that
most were suffering from "anxiety and
hysteria" over relatives trapped inside
the struck building. Jacobsen said five
others had been admitted to the
hospital.
One other crash victim was
reported hospitalized in "satisfactory"
condition at the Kaiser Foundation
Hospital in Oakland with first- and
second-degree burns.
James Williams, shift commander at
the Alameda County Coroner's Office,
told the Daily this morning that rescue
teams were still working the
perimeters of the crash site.
Rescue Operations
It was still "a little too warm to
really handle things" at the scene, he
said, adding that he expects rescue
operations to continue "well into
tomorrow" â€” meaning today.
The center of the crash site is still
"quite hot," Williams said, and he
called the area a "cinder-type scene."
It was almost four hours after the
crash before rescue workers were able
to bring in cranes and begin sifting
through the still-smoldering wreckage
of what had been the apartment
buildings.
