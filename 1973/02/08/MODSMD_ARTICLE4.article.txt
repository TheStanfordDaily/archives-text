# PA Clinic's Building Plant Now More Modest
## Voters, County Agency Blocked Hospitals 
### ROBERT BACON Last in a series 
In recent years, the Palo Alto Medical Clinic
(PAMC) hasn't been planning just the new clinic
building it is now seeking to build near Stanford
Hospital.
Three years ago, the "hot" development issue in
Palo Alto was not industrial or commercial, but
medical — the downtown hospital, a project of
PAMC and its stepchild, the non-profit Palo Alto
Medical Research Foundation.
Since then several factors have combined to lead
PAMC to drop entirely its plans for a hospital and
to press for new clinic facilities.
Hospital-Based
PAMC sought to convert itself into a complete
hospital-based group practice, which would be able
to function as a health maintenance organization
(HMO), offering complete prepaid medical care to
its patients with the assistance of government
subsidies.
PAMC Executive Administrator John Johnson
pointed out that the hospital-based practice "is ideal
from the doctor's point of view. It's the most
efficient way — he can see in-patients and

out-patients in the same or adjoining buildings."
TTie plan was for a community non-profit
hospital with a medical staff consisting of both
PAMC and non-PAMC doctors.
The first site proposed was adjoining the PAMC
buildings in downtown Palo Alto, the so-called
"Scott Street site."
Residential Area
But in 1970, the city's voters, apparently
reluctant to surrender part of an old and quiet
residential area to development, rejected a zone
change necessary to hospital construction. PAMC
began to look elsewhere.
American Medicorps, Inc., which owns and
operates many hospitals across the nation, was
engaged to study possible alternate sites for the new
facility.
After 18 months of study, PAMC found itself
foiled from another direction.
Out-Patient Care
Trends in medical care change, and the current
trend is toward out-patient care. Occupancy rates in
hospitals nationwide fell sharply, according to
Johnson.
As a result, the Santa Clara County

Comprehensive Health Planning Council, an agency
established by the state to coordinate the
construction of medical facilities, determined that
there was no need for the 175-200 bed hospital
PAMC proposed to construct.
Johnson explained that endorsement by the
county agency is vital: "They must say the beds are
needed, or the hospital won't be licensed. It can't be
accredited, it can't receive Medicare or Medi-Cal
[assistance to low-income patients] funds."
Plans Abandoned
Hence, last fall, PAMC was forced to abandon its
plans to build a hospital. Soon thereafter, PAMC
officials began to investigate the possibilities of
cooperation with Stanford and use of Stanford
Hospital along with a new clinic facility.
Stanford Medical School Dean Clayton Rich is
glad they did. "It would be a mistake to split the
hospital facilities ... the patients would suffer," he
said.
He pointed out that one large hospital, in
addition to being more economically sound than
two smaller ones, is able to maintain more expensive
and infrequently-used facilities for treatment.
More than half the beds at Stanford Hospital are
made available to patients of community physicians;
the rest go to patients of Stanford faculty doctors.
A large percentage of those community
physicians practice at PAMC. Johnson estimated
that at any given time, 125 to 140 patients of
PAMC doctors are in Stanford Hospital.
Rich opined that "It's a great advantage to
Stanford Hospital to have community patients. I
think the patients are better served by Stanford

Hospital" than they would be in a smaller PAMC
institution.
With a nationwide trend toward less
hospitalization, no new hospital is on the drawing
boards for Palo Alto in the foreseeable future.
Stanford awaits a Medical Master Plan, expected
in the fall. It is unlikely to call for new hospital
beds.
The PAMC, which once had plans for a new Palo
Alto hospital, is now dealing with Stanford over the
much more modest proposition of a new building

for its Clinic.
And so the next few years will see yet another
chapter in the Stanford-Palo Alto politics of health
care facilities. Whether because of those political
arrangements or in spite of them, the two
communities have health care facilities nearly
universally recognized as outstanding.
In the final analysis, the business and the politics
of medicine are valuable only insofar as they further
the art and the science of medicine. That is the one
fact that overrides all the others.

Plans Abandoned
Hence, last fall, PAMC was forced to abandon its
plans to build a hospital. Soon thereafter, PAMC
officials began to investigate the possibilities of
cooperation with Stanford and use of Stanford
Hospital along with a new clinic facility.
Stanford Medical School Dean Clayton Rich is
glad they did. "It would be a mistake to split the
hospital facilities ... the patients would suffer," he
said.
He pointed out that one large hospital, in
addition to being more economically sound than
two smaller ones, is able to maintain more expensive
and infrequently-used facilities for treatment.
More than half the beds at Stanford Hospital are
made available to patients of community physicians;
the rest go to patients of Stanford faculty doctors.
A large percentage of those community
physicians practice at PAMC. Johnson estimated
that at any given time, 125 to 140 patients of
PAMC doctors are in Stanford Hospital.
Rich opined that "It's a great advantage to
Stanford Hospital to have community patients. I
think the patients are better served by Stanford

Hospital" than they would be in a smaller PAMC
institution.
With a nationwide trend toward less
hospitalization, no new hospital is on the drawing
boards for Palo Alto in the foreseeable future.
Stanford awaits a Medical Master Plan, expected
in the fall. It is unlikely to call for new hospital
beds.
The PAMC, which once had plans for a new Palo
Alto hospital, is now dealing with Stanford over the
much more modest proposition of a new building

for its Clinic.
And so the next few years will see yet another
chapter in the Stanford-Palo Alto politics of health
care facilities. Whether because of those political
arrangements or in spite of them, the two
communities have health care facilities nearly
universally recognized as outstanding.
In the final analysis, the business and the politics
of medicine are valuable only insofar as they further
the art and the science of medicine. That is the one
fact that overrides all the others.
In recent years, the Palo Alto Medical Clinic
(PAMC) hasn't been planning just the new clinic
building it is now seeking to build near Stanford
Hospital.
Three years ago, the "hot" development issue in
Palo Alto was not industrial or commercial, but
medical — the downtown hospital, a project of
PAMC and its stepchild, the non-profit Palo Alto
Medical Research Foundation.
Since then several factors have combined to lead
PAMC to drop entirely its plans for a hospital and
to press for new clinic facilities.
Hospital-Based
PAMC sought to convert itself into a complete
hospital-based group practice, which would be able
to function as a health maintenance organization
(HMO), offering complete prepaid medical care to
its patients with the assistance of government
subsidies.
PAMC Executive Administrator John Johnson
pointed out that the hospital-based practice "is ideal
from the doctor's point of view. It's the most
efficient way — he can see in-patients and

out-patients in the same or adjoining buildings."
TTie plan was for a community non-profit
hospital with a medical staff consisting of both
PAMC and non-PAMC doctors.
The first site proposed was adjoining the PAMC
buildings in downtown Palo Alto, the so-called
"Scott Street site."
Residential Area
But in 1970, the city's voters, apparently
reluctant to surrender part of an old and quiet
residential area to development, rejected a zone
change necessary to hospital construction. PAMC
began to look elsewhere.
American Medicorps, Inc., which owns and
operates many hospitals across the nation, was
engaged to study possible alternate sites for the new
facility.
After 18 months of study, PAMC found itself
foiled from another direction.
Out-Patient Care
Trends in medical care change, and the current
trend is toward out-patient care. Occupancy rates in
hospitals nationwide fell sharply, according to
Johnson.
As a result, the Santa Clara County

Comprehensive Health Planning Council, an agency
established by the state to coordinate the
construction of medical facilities, determined that
there was no need for the 175-200 bed hospital
PAMC proposed to construct.
Johnson explained that endorsement by the
county agency is vital: "They must say the beds are
needed, or the hospital won't be licensed. It can't be
accredited, it can't receive Medicare or Medi-Cal
[assistance to low-income patients] funds."
