# Women Journalists Discuss Career Roles
## 
### JON BRAUN 
Three successful women journalists discussed the
expanding role of women in the newsroom last
night at Redwood Hall.
Appearing on the panel were Ruth Miller, San
Francisco Chronicle "People" editor, Joanne Lublin
of the Wall Street Journal, and Mary Madison, local
correspondent for UPI.
The meeting was sponsored by the campus
chapter of Women In Communication, a national
professional organization for women in journalism.
The organization aims to unite women working
in all fields of communication while working for a
free and responsible press.
Marcia Friedman, President of the Stanford
chapter of Women in Journalism, opened the
meeting by explaining that membership is open to
all interested students of communication, both men
and women.
The panelists discussed difficulties in their
careers due to sex discrimination, the changing
policies of newspaper policies, and the present
outlook for journalism graduates in a career still
dominated by men.
Began As 'Copyboy'
Ruth Miller began on the Chronicle as a
"copyboy." As was the case for many women, the
end of World War II meant the loss of positions in
deference to returning male veterans, and it was
several years before she could return to the
Chronicle as society editor.

Later, a sign of changing philosophy was
illustrated in the development of the present
"People" section, which attempts to appeal to both
men and women in a broader range of coverage.
Miller acknowledged, however, that the women
reporter's rise has been difficult.
For example, she told the famous story of
Chronicle reporter Mary Crawford, who doggedly
followed the District Attorney and a group of male
reporters into the men's room to get the "scoop" on
an important trial development.
A- common experience Miller shared with the
other panelists was confrontation with the editor
who "wouldn't send a woman reporter into a part
of town where his wife wouldn't go." Plane crashes
and railroad accidents were often scenes of
exaggerated gallantry on the part of male reporters.
Rise In Interest
Mary Madison, Mid-Peninsula correspondent for
UPI emphasized increased interest in journalism
among women. Madison taught an introductory
journalism class at Stanford in 1961, and among the
14 students, only one — a girl — seriously
considered that career, and she thought that city
newsrooms were filled with "hard-drinking men and
coarse language."
Since then times have changed, so much so that
graduate schools of journalism now have a 45
percent woman enrollment. However, when she
graduated in 1954, only the UPI and The Stanford
Daily did not discriminate against her, she said.

Madison's "biggest disappointment" was an
experience on the Palo Alto Times, where, serving in
1960 as political editor, she was denied assignment
to the Democratic National Convention in favor of
the business manager; this she described as "pure
sex discrimination."
Joanne Lublin, the first woman to enter the San
Francisco bureau of the Wall Street Journal, related
several comical experiences:
"I'd walk into a room and they'd all stand, or
reporters would try to walk on the street-side."
Thesis On Discrimination
Soon, Lublin became interested in the extent of
editors' discrimination, and came to Stanford to
write a thesis on the topic. Her results indicate that
stereotypes still dominate newspaper practice
despite changing official policy.
Specifically, she cited discrimination in hiring,
job status, and promotability. Men tended to receive
news "beats" like police, crime, sports, business,
labor and real estate, while women covered women's
news, education and medicine.
Furthermore, women's page reporters were paid
less than the men with "city-side" positions,
although the gradual extention of women into
higher status position has moved to equalize
opportunity for capable women.
However, old terms continue to hang on: "news
hens" refer to women reporters, while men are
"news cocks."

coarse language."
Since then times have changed, so much so that
graduate schools of journalism now have a 45
percent woman enrollment. However, when she
graduated in 1954, only the UPI and The Stanford
Daily did not discriminate against her, she said.

Madison's "biggest disappointment" was an
experience on the Palo Alto Times, where, serving in
1960 as political editor, she was denied assignment
to the Democratic National Convention in favor of
the business manager; this she described as "pure
sex discrimination."
Joanne Lublin, the first woman to enter the San
Francisco bureau of the Wall Street Journal, related
several comical experiences:
"I'd walk into a room and they'd all stand, or
reporters would try to walk on the street-side."
Thesis On Discrimination
Soon, Lublin became interested in the extent of
editors' discrimination, and came to Stanford to
write a thesis on the topic. Her results indicate that
stereotypes still dominate newspaper practice
despite changing official policy.
Specifically, she cited discrimination in hiring,
job status, and promotability. Men tended to receive
news "beats" like police, crime, sports, business,
labor and real estate, while women covered women's
news, education and medicine.
Furthermore, women's page reporters were paid
less than the men with "city-side" positions,
although the gradual extention of women into
higher status position has moved to equalize
opportunity for capable women.
However, old terms continue to hang on: "news
hens" refer to women reporters, while men are
"news cocks."
Three successful women journalists discussed the
expanding role of women in the newsroom last
night at Redwood Hall.
Appearing on the panel were Ruth Miller, San
Francisco Chronicle "People" editor, Joanne Lublin
of the Wall Street Journal, and Mary Madison, local
correspondent for UPI.
The meeting was sponsored by the campus
chapter of Women In Communication, a national
professional organization for women in journalism.
The organization aims to unite women working
in all fields of communication while working for a
free and responsible press.
Marcia Friedman, President of the Stanford
chapter of Women in Journalism, opened the
meeting by explaining that membership is open to
all interested students of communication, both men
and women.
The panelists discussed difficulties in their
careers due to sex discrimination, the changing
policies of newspaper policies, and the present
outlook for journalism graduates in a career still
dominated by men.
Began As 'Copyboy'
Ruth Miller began on the Chronicle as a
"copyboy." As was the case for many women, the
end of World War II meant the loss of positions in
deference to returning male veterans, and it was
several years before she could return to the
Chronicle as society editor.

Later, a sign of changing philosophy was
illustrated in the development of the present
"People" section, which attempts to appeal to both
men and women in a broader range of coverage.
Miller acknowledged, however, that the women
reporter's rise has been difficult.
For example, she told the famous story of
Chronicle reporter Mary Crawford, who doggedly
followed the District Attorney and a group of male
reporters into the men's room to get the "scoop" on
an important trial development.
A- common experience Miller shared with the
other panelists was confrontation with the editor
who "wouldn't send a woman reporter into a part
of town where his wife wouldn't go." Plane crashes
and railroad accidents were often scenes of
exaggerated gallantry on the part of male reporters.
Rise In Interest
Mary Madison, Mid-Peninsula correspondent for
UPI emphasized increased interest in journalism
among women. Madison taught an introductory
journalism class at Stanford in 1961, and among the
14 students, only one — a girl — seriously
considered that career, and she thought that city
newsrooms were filled with "hard-drinking men and
coarse language."

graduate schools of journalism now have a 45
