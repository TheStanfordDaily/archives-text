## Legal Injustice 
### 
The injustice of the American jury system has seldom been more
evident than in the last couple of weeks during the aftermath of the
Juan Corona trial.
Rarely has such unanimity in incompetence been achieved: it
seems that the prosecution, the defense, the jury and the judge were
vying to see who could pervert the judicial process most effectively.
First, the prosecution put on what was recognized as one of the
most poorly planned cases in recent memory.
Then defense attorney Richard Hawk did Corona a great disservice
by resting his case without presenting any evidence on Corona's
behalf. The prosecution's incompetence may have made Hawk
confident that he would win the case anyway, but there is no doubt
that Hawk severely misjudged the situation.
The controversy concerning the jury has centered around one
member, Naomi Underwood, who first declared that she really didn't
feel Corona was guilty despite the fact that she was "pressured" into
convicting him, and then claimed to have discussed the case with
someone who was not a juror before the verdict was delivered.
Finally, Superior Court Judge Richard Patton decided Monday that
Corona was not entitled to a new trial. Given the ineptitude of
Corona's lawyer and the vacillation of at least one jury member, it
seems to me that only a fool would deny that a new trial would serve
the cause of justice. Unfortunately, there was a fool on the bench
Monday in the person of Judge Patton who apparently failed to see
anything amiss in the trial's proceedings.
I admit that most cases are probably handled correctly and result
in justifiable convictions, but glaring examples like this case point out
considerable flaws in our judicial system.
The most obvious change I could recommend would be the
elimination of jury screening before a trial. As the system now
operates, only the least educated people in society are permitted to
participate in controversial cases. In the Corona case, in the Watergate
case, and in the Pentagon Papers case (to name a few), most of the
jurors selected were those who knew little or nothing about the cases
involved.
Since people who read newspapers regularly tend to form opinions
on what they read, and since these cases have received wide publicity
in the press, those people who have not formed opinions tend to be
those who are most isolated and least educated. These are the very
people who comprise most of our juries in important cases!
My feeling is that it makes little difference if a juror leans to one
side or to the other before a trial gets underway. Chances are good
that some jurors would originally lean toward the defense while others
would lean toward the prosecution. This would insure a full airing of
both sides of the case and would really force the prosecution to prove
cases "beyond a reasonable doubt" in order to achieve a unanimous
verdict.
Finally, to return to where I started, Juan Corona should be
granted a new trial immediately. The fact that so much uncertainty
still surrounds his case not only requires a new trial in fairness to
Corona, but also in fairness to the American people — who would like
to know whether the largest domestic mass murderer in American
history has been safely apprehended, or is still on the loose hacking
away while an innocent man suffers.
