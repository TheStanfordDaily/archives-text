# Programs To Cut
## Fat In Nixon's New Budget 
### 
Bill Everg

President Nixon has just
proposed a $269 billion budget
for 1974—an increase of $19
billion and of 7.5 percent over the
budget for 1973.
After closely and judiciously
examining the extensive coverage
of the new budget in the New
York Times and the Wall Street
Journal, one can only conclude
that there is still a lot of fat that
needs to be eliminated from the
1974 budget.
A continued and sustained
taxpayers' revolt of the sort that
prompted the proposal of a few
program eliminations this year
could in the years ahead result in
actual declines in the federal
budget.
Pressure
The citizen unrest that created
the political pressure to reduce
draft calls to zero could similarly,
if aroused and mobilized, reduce
taxes and government
expenditures in the same
direction.
There is a good reason why this
should be done. As Prof. Roland
McKean of UCLA points out in
his textbook Public Spending
(1968), "Any activity supported
by taxes compels some groups to
give up resources for purposes
they might not voluntarily
support.... In most societies,
past or present, government
spending has involved large
reductions of freedom in the sense
of providing services that many
individual taxpayers would not
voluntarily buy. Taxes are
compulsory, and we have no way
of knowing just how each
individual would choose to use
the resources if they were left in
his hands."
What are some of the

Nixon-supported programs that
we would be better off without?
It's impossible for me to think of
any that are really necessary, but
three obvious examples of areas
for program elimination are the
military budget, the maritime
industry subsidy, and the drug
control program.
Military Reducing Diet
A $5 billion cut from Nixon's
specific budget requests on
military spending was called for
by Sen. William Proxmire
(D—Wise.) in a speech on the
Senate floor on Feb. 6.
Proxmire gave details on how
he would reconstruct the military
budget: "A $7 billion savings
from the Vietnam war; a
reduction of the 400 major and
3000 minor bases scattered in 30
countries throughout the world;
reform of procurement; deletion
of funds for the new carrier,
Trident submarine, AWACs,
duplications of close support
aircraft, duplication of
anti-submarine warfare
procurement, B-l bombers funds,
and the F-14 fighter plane;
manpower -savings through
stopping the officers grade creep,
improving the ratio of combat to
supply troops, and cuts in civilian
personnel to match the cuts in
military personnel.
"These cuts should more than
offset the increases for pav and
from inflation for a net savings of
$5 billion."
Tax Piracy Afloat
On Jan. 30, the editorial in the
New York Times complimented
the Nixon administration for
making a long-overdue cut in
direct payments to farmers. But
the Times went on to ask: "Farm
subsidies have been cut but why

have maritime subsidies been
spared?"
On the same day, a news
analysis in the Times noted that
the maritime subsidy program had
been "denounced as ineffective by
nearly everyone who has ever
studied the matter, including
blue-ribbon committees of
business executives."
Economist Clinton Whitehurst,
writing in 1965, puts the cost of
operational subsidies to the
maritime industry at $1.1 billion
for 1947-60.
Drug-User Control
Finally, the Nixon
administration is asking for a total
of $719 million for its program to
control drug users during fiscal
year 1974. This is an increase of
$64 million and of ten percent
over the previous year.
Entirely without reference to
whether or not marijuana is
harmful, legal principles built
upon a right to privacy similar to
that set forth in various court
decisions on birth control and
abortion lead inexorably to the
conclusion that all drugs from
marijuana to heroin should be
legalized. The ingestion of a drug
is not an attack upon some other
person and therefore should be of
no interest to the law and its
enforcers.
The budget for 1974 is, like all
previous budgets, a list of rewards
conferred upon or denied to the
special interests that cluster
around the federal government
and feed upon the taxpaying
public. But the present fiscal crisis
and taxpayers' revolt has slightly
altered the list of recipients of the
largesse.
Collection of Interests
In the Jan. 30 Wall Street

Journal, George Melloan describes
the collection of interests that is
keenly and personally concerned
with the budget: "Trade
associations, business
corporations, lawyers,
consultants, tax experts, influence
peddlers all. . . attracted by the
whiff of Great Society money"
and the government bureaucrats
themselves. These groups consider
the budget as booty to be divided
up among them, according to
their preferences.
But members of the broad
middle sector of the population
would just as soorijnot have their
earnings taken away from them. It
looks like a struggle for years to
come between the net tax-victims
and the net tax-eaters.
