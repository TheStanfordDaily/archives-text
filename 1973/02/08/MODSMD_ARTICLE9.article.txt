# Government's Motives Questionable
## Science And The Sickle Cell 
### 
Cedric X

The same white man who
ordered the dropping of over
seven million tons of bombs on
the Vietnamese people also
increased governmental research
support for the black "disease" of
sickle-cell anemia from $50,000
(in 1968) to $5,000,000 (in
1971).
This fact alone should cause us
some concern over the
government's motives in the
recent congressional passage of
the National Sickle-Cell Anemia
Control Act (with a budget of

$115 million).
One of Stanford's Nobel
laureates, Linus Pauling, made the
discovery in 1949 that sickle
globin differs from normal in just
one amino acid. He is credited
with coining the term "molecular
disease." He is also known for his
1968 suggestion that people
possessing the sickle-cell should be
tattoed on the forehead.
Critical Question
The critical question for all
thoughtful people is "Does the
incidence and consequences of

sickle-cell 'disease' warrant the
sudden Government interest in it,
or is this interest reflective of the
Government's desire to find a
'final solution' for the racial
problem?"
First of all, let us recall that
only 50,000 black people have the
two sickle-cell genes which are
said to constitute the 'disease.'
This represents .001 percent of
the black population. (Based on
what I think—as a former census
taker in the black community—is
a conservative estimate of the
black American population of 50
million.)
Another way of making the
same point is to note that whereas
in 1968 approximately one dollar
was spent on each sickle cell
carrier, in 1972 over two
thousand dollars were spent.
Consequences
Are we to believe that the
government's concern for the
health and welfare of black people
has increased two thousand fold
from the date of Nixon's
inauguration?
Secondly, let us consider the
consequences of this so-called
disease. The first thing we should
note is that having one sickle cell
gene does not make a person a
carrier of the 'dread disease.'
There are many more people with
the single trait then there are
those with the 'disease.' The
single-trait carriers, which the
government estimates to be 10%
of all blacks, suffer no ill effects
from the possession of the trait.
Unless one i6 accustomed to
riding in high pressured airplanes
(which extremely few blacks do),
one will never know that he has a
sickle cell.
The government is discouraging

this 10% of the black population
to marry, but its messages are
beamed at the total black
community. Many states have
compulsory testing laws for
"screening" black children. This is
done despite the fact that if
sickle-cell is something a person is
born with, then there is nothing
anyone can do about it.
The national propaganda
campaign continues despite the
fact that a cure for sickle-cell will
never be found until it is possible
to manipulate genes. Who are to
be the human guinea pigs in such
manipulation? Is it to be the same
race of people who were the
guinea pigs in the South African
heart transplant experimentation
and the Alabama syphilis
experimentation?
Finally, we should note that a
carrier of the sickle cell is
protected from malaria in tropical
climates. This is very important
because increasing numbers of
black people are traveling to
Africa. Government-supported
scientists have very cleverly
convinced us that a genetic trait
which has no value (in
non-malaria countries) is one
which has a negative value. They
would have us believe that just
because the trait is more common
to blacks than to whites that,
therefore, it is a 'disease.' As a
result, there is a nation-wide
campaign directed at "stamping
out sickle-cell." A lot of ignorant,
money-hustling, black people are
involved in these campaigns. Little
do they know that they may, in
fact, be helping to "stamp out"
their race.
