"A magnificent, moving and
very mysterious new film with a focus so
sharp that it seems to have the clarity of
something seen through the medium of fever.
Nothing that Bergman has done before is likely
to prepare you for 'Cries and Whispers'. It stands
alone and it reduces almost everything else
you're likely to see this season to the size
of a small cinder."
