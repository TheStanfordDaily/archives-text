CECIL WILLIAMS
Sunday, February 11, Memorial Church
7:00 P.M. Evening Vespers Celebration
Celebration with Cecil Williams is an unforgettable ex
perience. Combining the Meridian West Jazz-Folk group, the
"soulful" Glide Ensemble, and a light show with up-to-date
liturgy and music provides a worship that is unique. The
Glide Memorial Church "attempts to provide a platform for
the voiceless people of the Bay Area," and is deeply involved
in finding solutions to the problems people face in their daily
lives. We welcome them to Memorial Church as part of Black
History Week.
