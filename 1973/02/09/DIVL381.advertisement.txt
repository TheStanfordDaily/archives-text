Lola Predicts
I There's bad news in the
cards, so to speak, as
Stanford travels north to face
0 the Ducks and Beavers. Lola,
who is 23-3 this season,
predicts that the Cards will be
misdealt this weekend. e
Stanford, with a pair of I
wins, could move into third I
place in the Pac-Eight, but u.
Lola believes the Cards will [
lose on Saturday afternoon to
the hot-shooting Beavers,
fj after a win over the Ducks
tonight. Stanford has to
1 play two games in 16 hours.
□ The boring bus ride from
Eugene to Corvallis,
combined with OSU's
debris-throwing fans, should
be too much for the Cards to
take.
Lola's predictions: □
Stanford 75—Oregon 69
Oregon State 79—Cat 70
Oregon 80— Cat 72 =
jij OSU 77—Stanford 71
UCLA 85-Washington 68
USC 75-Wash. State 70
□ UCLA 82-Wash. State 63
LUSC 78-Washington 73
