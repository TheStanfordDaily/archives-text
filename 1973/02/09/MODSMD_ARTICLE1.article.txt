# Initial Prisoner Release To Free 27 By Monday
## 
### 
SAIGON (AP) - The United States
and North Vietnam have concluded an
agreement on the date, sites and
number of American prisoners to be
released in the first group, senior
American officials disclosed yesterday.
The officials, who have access to
terms of the agreement, would not
disclose its substance. But they
indicated the release will come
sometime between tomorrow and
Monday, and that the initial group to
be freed in South Vietnam will
number 27.
Meanwhile, a Pentagon spokesman
said the Defense Department would
not bring charges against POWs who
broadcast propaganda over Radio
Hanoi.
Asked why the American prisoners
are not being released immediately if
an agreement has been concluded, one
official replied:
"What makes you think the other
side had any intention of doing
anything until the last minute?"
Time Table
The Americans noted that the
Communist side has agreed to a date
apparently within the time table laid
down by Henry A. Kissinger.
Kissinger has said the United States

expects American prisoners to be
released at two-week intervals in
roughly equal installments from the
signing of the agreement until the
60-day deadline for U.S. troop
withdrawal and prisoner repatriation,
which is March 28.
Under Kissinger's timetable, which
is not written into the agreement or
any of its protocols, the first group of
American prisoners should be released
around Sunday, since that marks
expiration of the first two-week
interval since the agreement was signed
in Paris Jan. 27.
Pentagon sources said last night
that 27 American prisoners held in
jungle camps in the South will be
released Sunday near An Loc, 60 miles
north of Saigon.
Indications from the Pentagon
sources were that the first POW release
from North Vietnam might coincide
with Kissinger's four-day visit to
Hanoi.
No Charges
No charges will be filed against
returning war prisoners for making
propaganda statements over North
Vietnamese radio, the Defense
Department said yesterday.
But Pentagon spokesman Jerry W.

Friedheim did not rule out disciplinary
action against POWs for "ratting on
comrades" or stealing food from
fellow prisoners.
Friedheim restated Pentagon policy
during a question-and-answer session
with a youth group.
Former Secretary of Defense
Melvin R. Laird had taken a similar
stand about six months ago, and
Friedheim made it clear that the
policy remains in effect under Elliot L.
Richardson, Laird's successor.
"We do not intend to bring
charges," Friedheim said. "We know
why some of their statements were
made."
'More Than Statement'
Later, he told a reporter that "it
would have to be more than a
statement on Hanoi radio" to bring
government action against any
returning POW.
He stressed to the youth group that
the official Pentagon decision against
bringing formal charges for radio
statements does not bind individual
members of the armed services from
filing charges against other servicemen.
Some returning war prisoners may
bring legal action against other war
prisoners, he indicated.
North Vietnam has identified 562
U.S. servicemen as alive in prison
camps and 55 who died in captivity.
Of the 562 identified as alive, 456 are
in the North, 99 in South Vietnam and
seven in Laos.
In addition, the Communists also
list 27 American civilians as captured
in South Vietnam, some of them State
Department officials.
South Vietnamese military losses
were reported as 794 troops killed,
3350 wounded and 820 missing. In
addition, at least 30 civilians have been
killed and 172 wounded, the Saigon
command said.
It accused the Communist side cf
2045 cease-fire violations.

"What makes you think the other
side had any intention of doing
anything until the last minute?"
Time Table
The Americans noted that the
Communist side has agreed to a date
apparently within the time table laid
down by Henry A. Kissinger.
Kissinger has said the United States

expects American prisoners to be
released at two-week intervals in
roughly equal installments from the
signing of the agreement until the
60-day deadline for U.S. troop
withdrawal and prisoner repatriation,
which is March 28.
Under Kissinger's timetable, which
is not written into the agreement or
any of its protocols, the first group of
American prisoners should be released
around Sunday, since that marks
expiration of the first two-week
interval since the agreement was signed
in Paris Jan. 27.
Pentagon sources said last night
that 27 American prisoners held in
jungle camps in the South will be
released Sunday near An Loc, 60 miles
north of Saigon.
Indications from the Pentagon
sources were that the first POW release
from North Vietnam might coincide
with Kissinger's four-day visit to
Hanoi.
No Charges
No charges will be filed against
returning war prisoners for making
propaganda statements over North
Vietnamese radio, the Defense
Department said yesterday.
But Pentagon spokesman Jerry W.

Friedheim did not rule out disciplinary
action against POWs for "ratting on
comrades" or stealing food from
fellow prisoners.
Friedheim restated Pentagon policy
during a question-and-answer session
with a youth group.
Former Secretary of Defense
Melvin R. Laird had taken a similar
stand about six months ago, and
Friedheim made it clear that the
policy remains in effect under Elliot L.
Richardson, Laird's successor.
"We do not intend to bring
charges," Friedheim said. "We know
why some of their statements were
made."
'More Than Statement'
Later, he told a reporter that "it
would have to be more than a
statement on Hanoi radio" to bring
government action against any
returning POW.
He stressed to the youth group that
the official Pentagon decision against
bringing formal charges for radio
statements does not bind individual
members of the armed services from
filing charges against other servicemen.
Some returning war prisoners may
bring legal action against other war
prisoners, he indicated.
North Vietnam has identified 562
U.S. servicemen as alive in prison
camps and 55 who died in captivity.
Of the 562 identified as alive, 456 are
in the North, 99 in South Vietnam and
seven in Laos.
In addition, the Communists also
list 27 American civilians as captured
in South Vietnam, some of them State
Department officials.
South Vietnamese military losses
were reported as 794 troops killed,
3350 wounded and 820 missing. In
addition, at least 30 civilians have been
killed and 172 wounded, the Saigon
command said.
It accused the Communist side cf
2045 cease-fire violations.

RELEASE SET — The first release of American POWs in Vietnam will include 27 captives and will take place between
tomorrow and Monday, officials announced yesterday.
SAIGON (AP) - The United States
and North Vietnam have concluded an
agreement on the date, sites and
