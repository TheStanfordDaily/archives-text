# A
						Petition They Can't Refuse
## Fettucine Revenge 
### 
- Jerry Coleman

You say you want to take 28
units this quarter? Waive that silly
requirement? Squeeze this
itsy-bitsy one unit P.E. class into
your already obese schedule? Or
maybe graduate 3 years early
cause you're tired of paying
$1000 tuition every 10 weeks?
Well join the crowd, kids! I
speak of the ever-swelling lines of
people petitioning the Dean of
Undergraduate Studies for one
reason or another.
Pull out your Bic accountant's
super fine point and scrawl your
story of hardship and woe onto
the little white paper. Then wait
anxiously for the answer, a mark
in one of two spaces: either "You
got it, baby!" or "Better luck
next time, sport."
Infinite Wisdom
Those who get their requests
granted praise the fairness and
wisdom of the Petition
Committee; many of those given
rejections still respect the
Committee for its careful
consideration.
But there are always some who
nurse a grudge. Three of my
friends—an Italian, a Sicilian, and
an Albanian—came to see me last
week, and over a cask of dry
Amontillado, told me of their
displeasure with the Committee's
denials.
"This is the second time
they've turned me down," began
the Italian. "I won't stand for it
any longer!" Then, his voice
increasing in intensity to match
the growing redness of his face, he
threatened to go to the Old Union
and bang his fists on desks until
something was done.
No Finesse
"They think I've got no power
behind me ... well I've got a
judge in my back pocket—in fact,
he's my old man—and I'll get him
to issue injunctions left and right.
Those Committee members' heads
will be spinning!"
" 'Attsa got no finesse,"
interrupted the Sicilian, slowly
sipping his wine. His brooding
eyes closed, and a slight smile
passed across his lips as he began
his own vendetta fantasy:

"First I go into the Old Union
and ask quietly—in Italian—that
they grant my petition. I repeat
the request, this time in English,
knowing that their minds are
already made up.
Cooperation
"I turn my head. 'Vito—' I call
softly. Vito and his two
capo regimes enter. These are my
friends: tough men who know
how to handle those not wanting
to cooperate. Ah, what messy
business."
I pictured one Committee
member strangled with a hot
canneloni, a second smothered
under steaming mostaccioli alia
calabrese, a third downed by a
breath of deadly garlic.
"And a burst of staccato
gunfire would make any
bystanders look like a cross
between mozzarella and swiss,"
added the crafty Sicilian, reading
my thoughts.
Montenegran Terror
We all turned to the stout,
dark, and curly-haired Albanian to
learn of his plans for revenge. "My
fantasy is more Balkan by nature:
with the same restlessness and
violence that has plagued my
homeland for centuries. But it is
also very funny!" he added with a
Balkan guffaw.
Then, pointing at us, he
ordered, "You three hum the
'Mission Impossible' theme song
and I will tell you want I do with
this Committee." There we sat,
intoning as he recounted a most
entertaining drama, punctuated
by slaps on his knee and hearty
laughter, his hallmarks.
"Picture a hidden storeroom in
the Old Union basement. I enter
to give my group last minute
instructions. They sit at dressing
tables, and as they turn to listen,
they present their nearly
completed disguises: perfect maks
of the Petition Committee
members' faces.
The Übiguitos Closet
"A flashing light on my watch
indicates the Committee
Chairman has left his office for
the Committee meeting. Our
group springs into action. The
electronics expert, with the aid of
150 pounds of plastique, breaks
into the Chairman's office and
takes my petition from the 'dead
files.'
"The beautiful woman locks
the Committee stenographer in a
broom closet. All other
Committee members but the
Chairman meet the same fate.
Then the meeting begins—the
Chairman being the only real
member present.
"My group-safe in their
disguises—urges him to reconsider
my petition. He finally signs its
approval then rises suddenly,
alarmed. 'You aren't the

Committee!' he shouts. 'Where—.'
His question is finished in the
privacy of a broom closet.
Madcap Egress
"With that background of
gagged protestations, the group
climbs down the ivy outside the
building and to our getaway van,
itself disguised as a dumpster.
'The roar of grinding gears
(first, second, third, fourth, fifth,
sixth—and still doing 20!), the
squeal of tires, and the stench of
week-old garbage signal our
departure toward the safety of
San Mateo County where we'll be
out of the law's reach.
"Our dumpster rams through
the police blockade at the County
Line, and we continue north on
101 doing a blistering 35 in ninth
gear "
The constant humming of the
theme song, as well as the wine,
began to take their toll as my
Albanian friend ended his story,
falling into a deep and noisy sleep.
Sweet Lethe
"You have to respect the m
with the imagination to get what
is rightfully his," whispered the
Italian with admiration.
"Thanks for the wine, Jer,"
said the Sicilian. "We'll take
sleep-head home. By the way,
Jer—you look like you could use
some sleep yourself. Been working
hard lately?"
"Yep," I replied. "Taking 46
units this quarter."
"46 units! How d'ja ever get
that approved?"
"I'm on the Committee."
—See ya next week, kids.
