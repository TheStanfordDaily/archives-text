Ehrlichand Shockley
Editor:
Despite his avowed intention
to the contrary, Professor Paul
Ehrlich (Daily, Feb. 3) has clearly
shown his affinity with the views
expressed by Professor William
Shockley concerning human
intelligence. The areas of affinity
are these:
Both professors believe that
intelligence is an entity having
"components;" that this entity is
measurable via the IQ test; that
population control is the "most
serious" problem facing our
country today; and that science
textbooks should present
Darwinian concepts of evolution
as scientific fact rather than
speculation.
I do not believe that human
intelligence can be separated from
or measured independently of the
environment in which it is
manifested. (Which is not the
same as saying that intelligence
has "both genetic and
environmental components.") I
further do not believe that the IQ
test represents anything near a
measure of human intelligence.
Nor do I believe that population is

as serious a problem as the
existence of genetic researchers.
Finally, I believe that Darwinian
concepts should be presented as
speculation, just as those concepts
suggesting Divine Creation.
This is not to say that there are
no differences between the views
of Professor Shockley and those
of Professor Ehrlich. There are,
indeed, many; Professor Ehrlich's
arguments deserve to be taken
much more seriously, since his
motivations for research in this
area are not tainted with a desire
for racial revenge as are Professor
Shockley's.
Nevertheless, the ideological
similarity between the two men
far outweighs, in my mind, their
differences. This ideological
similarity reflects itself in an
abysmal ignorance of modern
physics, modern psychology and
modern philosophy. A debate
with Professor Shockley
concerning Black intelligence is a
ludicious undertaking, as I hope
was demonstrated on January 23;
a debate with Professor Ehrlich
would, however, be intellectually
valuable, for his position is one
which is widely shared among
white academians and, for that
reason, much more dangerous to
the welfare of non-whites
throughout the world.

Dead Politics
Editor:
From the article that Mr. Peers
wrote concerning the Grateful
Dead, Mr. Van Petten, and Mr.
Shannon (Daily, Feb. 6), may I
say, Mr. Peers, you are a total
fool. Of course Mr. Shannon had
something to do with this concert.
The Dead don't just decide to
drop by Stanford for the hell of
it. Someone has to ask them,
don't you think, Mr. Where
is your appreciation, sir?
You disqualify yourself by
such statements as: "mention of
9

these achievements at times of
electioneering would be
understandable; they seem hardly
appropriate now." From my
understanding—so what? If it
seems "hardly appropriate," Mr.
Peers, did it ever occur to you
that perhaps politics are not
involved?
As to the remark concerning
the financing of the handbills in
question—Mr. Peers, you happily
proclaim, after having been
assured that Mr. Van Petten paid
for the advertisements himself:
"We can at least be happy that
this personal publicity was not
generated with ASSU funds."
Really, Mr. Peers, what kind of
man are you? If any of this is
true, it seems to me that the
honor of the Grateful Dead is at
stake, not yours. It seems to me
that your overconcern for your
precious pennies has led you to
failure in one of the most basic
principles of humanity—that of
giving the benefit of the doubt.
The only person who "must be
condemned" is you, sir. Why
should Mr. Van Petten's and Mr.
Shannon's announcement "of
their intention not to run for
office" be in order? Are you
yourself planning to partake in a
little politics? Then as you say,
"This fact should also be made
public."
You see, sir, such accusations
can come from both sides. Don't
tell me you are only interested in
the morality of the whole thing.
That's quite a naive statement
coming from a history major. You
surprise me, being in history.
From what I've read in the Daily
concerning pre-meds, perhaps you
should consider changing your
major, sir.

Discrimination Denied
Editor:
In a front-page article
yesterday, Mary Madison is
quoted as saying that the "biggest
disappointment" of her career is
that while "serving in 1960 as
political editor, she was denied
assignment to the Democratic
National Convention in favor of
the business manager." She
described this, your article states,
"as pure sex discrimination."
We would be interested in
setting the record straight:
—Mrs. Madison at that time
was working as a general reporter
for the Times. She never was
"political editor."
—She was never denied an
assignment "in favor of the
business manager."
—The Times sent Ward
Winslow, now our associate editor
but then editorial and political
writer, to cover the Democratic
Convention in Los Angeles in
1960.
—Don Webster, now a CBS
correspondent but then our
business editor, went to the
convention on his own time.
Webster, an eager-beaver reporter,
frequently did things like that.
So far as claims of sex
discrimination in the newsroom of
the Times is concerned, it's a
myth. Mary Madison started with
us as a society reporter. She did
such a good job that she was
quickly transferred to the
city-side staff, where she covered
the same type of news any man
does. Her leaving here, however,
was connected with sex — she
resigned to become a mother.
The Times historically has
given women equal treatment in
newsroom assignments. Our
current business editor is Marge
Speidel, who was employed to
replace Paul Emerson when he
was made arts editor. The Times
was one of the first to break the
male monopoly on the press room
on the Santa Clara County
Courthouse, assigning a woman to
what is considered one of the top
news beats on the staff.
We employ reporters and
editors, not men or women. I am
sorry that Mary Madison suffered
a big disappointment by not being
assigned to cover the Democratic
National Convention. I can assure
her and you that sex had nothing
to do with it.
