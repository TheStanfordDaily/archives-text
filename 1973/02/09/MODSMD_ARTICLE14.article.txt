Are there any places in the area that make their own pizza
dough, as opposed to using frozen dough? W.T.K.
There are quite a few places that make their own dough:
Cap'ns Gallery Pizza & Pipes in Redwood City, all Round
Table pizza parlours, Shakey's, and Village Host Pizza. The
Amber Lantern uses frozen dough.

Why oh why oh why are there no doors on the toilet stalls
in the Wilbur complex? This seems to be a rather absurd
invasion of personal privacy. L.F.
Wilbur was originally built as an all-male freshman dorm
and at the time it was planned, gang showers and open stalls
seemed to be the thing to put in. No one worried too much
about privacy. A few years ago, swinging doors were put in the
stalls in Otero, but the experiment didn't tum out too well,
according to Marie Haley, administrative assistant for Wilbur.
Students complained that the doors took up too much room
in the stalls.
When Wilbur changed to a co-ed dorm, curtains were put up
in the showers and toilet stalls in the women's bathrooms but
the men's remained as they were: doorless.
Alan Cummings, Manager of Residences and Fraternities,
said that if a Wilbur house put in a request for curtains, he
would see that they were installed.

Where in the foothills can Stanford students hike? Is it
necessary to have a pass? If so, where can you get one? J.H.
It is necessary to have a pass to hike in the Stanford-owned
foothills directly behind the campus, but none are being issued
at the present time. The passes were issued free last year by
the Campus Conservation Group in accordance with certain
conditions set by the leasee Piers Dairy Products.
These conditions included a definite trail for people to
follow, daytime use only, no dogs or fires, and limited access
to Stanford community members and their guests. Phil Farrell,
president of the Conservation group, said that he and
interested students constructed the trail last year, but there
has not been enough interest to rebuild it this year.
The University has been willing to re-issue passes but it
cannot until all conditions are met. Anyone interested in
legalizing foothill hiking might contact Phil Farrell through the
ASSU office.

Is it possible for unescorted visitors to eat at the various
dining halls? If so, what does it cost and what are the hours?
Do any have a reputation for particularly good food? H.G.
Unescorted visitors may eat in different dorms by the Food
Services discourages this as dining rooms get filled quickly.
Maxine Anderson, Manager of the Food Service says, "We
prefer that guests accompany residents." Anyone with a meal
card may eat in any dorm with no prior notice. Breakfast costs
$1.00, lunch $1.60, and dinner $2.50.
Hours vary for each dorm, but generally breakfast is served
from 7:15 to 8:30 a.m., lunch from 11:30 to 12:30, late lunch
from 1:00 to 1:30 and dinner from 5:30 to 6:30. If you want
to find times for specific dorms, contact the Food Service at
ext. 4751.
Some students feel that no dorms have a reputation for
particularly good food, while others Bug Me questioned
insisted on their favorites, each of them different. Wilbur
seemed to be the big dorm most frequently mentioned for
having good food. The Row houses are known to have
particularly good food, due in great part to the smallness of
the houses and the individual cooks.
