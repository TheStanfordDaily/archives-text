# Kirst Urges Education Changes While Testifying Before House
## 
### 
Federal aid to education
should be continued but with "a
mix of grant consolidation (or
special revenue sharing) and the
present categorical approach," a
Stanford specialist in educational
finance testified Wednesday.
Michael Kirst, assistant
professor of education and
business education, told the
House Committee on Education
and Labor that he supported HR
69, which would extend the
Elementary and Secondary
Education Act of 1965, but with
revisions.
The Nixon administration's
'New Federalism' approach has
some good components, he said,
but should not be adopted in
toto.
Kirst and colleagues have just
completed a study of the politics
of Federal aid to education in six
states—California, Michigan,
Massachusetts, Texas, Virginia and
New York—and much of his
Washington testimony was based
on the findings.
Undesirability of Extremes
"Our studies show that neither
extreme is desirable—total reliance
on block grants with no federal
strings or the present federal maze
of categories," Kirst said.
(The 1965 act is known for
short as "Title I " or
"compensatory education." It
covers such subjects as money for
financially distressed school
districts, increased academic
achievement programs for
disadvantaged children, support
for parochial schools, health,
clothing and nutrition programs
for the disadvantaged and a
"carrot-and-stick" system of
encouraging integration.)
Kirst told the committee he
supported the majority of the
original bill's objectives. But he
suggested that integration not be
tied directly to the bill in view of
recent Supreme Court decisions
and civil rights laws.
"The problem of parochial
schools," he added, "is best dealt
with through federal tax credits,
or perhaps not at all.
"I also favor large-scale federal
grant consolidation. [This] will
provide a more effective

mechanism for making
compensatory education
effective."
'Comp Ed'
"Comp Ed" can't be analyzed
for effectiveness without a
school-by-school comparison, the
University educator told the
congressmen.
"You cannot have
compensation without having an
equal base at each school so that
federal funds provide 'more than
equal' for the disadvantaged," he
told the committee. "All our
studies reveal that the schools
with the greatest need have the
least amount of money allocated
to them by the central office."
While the information on what
does work is sketchy or
nonexistent, Prof. Kirst said, his
studies have shown what doesn't
work.
"Merely increasing teachers'
salaries, adding more professional
personnel, and diluting funds
through general aid is probably
ineffective," he testified.
Kirst suggested, what's needed
is a standard assessment of state
needs and establishment of
priorities, coordination of
categorical federal programs, with
federal aid treated as a single
fund. Federal funds thus could be
targeted on state priorities,
reinforcing state aid.

studies have shown what doesn't
work.
"Merely increasing teachers'
salaries, adding more professional
personnel, and diluting funds
through general aid is probably
ineffective," he testified.
Kirst suggested, what's needed
is a standard assessment of state
needs and establishment of
priorities, coordination of
categorical federal programs, with
federal aid treated as a single
fund. Federal funds thus could be
targeted on state priorities,
reinforcing state aid.
Federal aid to education
should be continued but with "a
mix of grant consolidation (or
special revenue sharing) and the
present categorical approach," a
Stanford specialist in educational
finance testified Wednesday.
Michael Kirst, assistant
professor of education and
business education, told the
House Committee on Education
and Labor that he supported HR
69, which would extend the
Elementary and Secondary
Education Act of 1965, but with
revisions.
The Nixon administration's
'New Federalism' approach has
some good components, he said,
but should not be adopted in
toto.
Kirst and colleagues have just
completed a study of the politics
of Federal aid to education in six
states—California, Michigan,
Massachusetts, Texas, Virginia and
New York—and much of his
Washington testimony was based
on the findings.
Undesirability of Extremes
"Our studies show that neither
extreme is desirable—total reliance
on block grants with no federal
strings or the present federal maze
of categories," Kirst said.
(The 1965 act is known for
short as "Title I " or
"compensatory education." It
covers such subjects as money for
financially distressed school
districts, increased academic
achievement programs for
disadvantaged children, support
for parochial schools, health,
clothing and nutrition programs
for the disadvantaged and a
"carrot-and-stick" system of
encouraging integration.)
Kirst told the committee he
supported the majority of the
original bill's objectives. But he
suggested that integration not be
tied directly to the bill in view of
recent Supreme Court decisions
and civil rights laws.
"The problem of parochial
schools," he added, "is best dealt
with through federal tax credits,
or perhaps not at all.
"I also favor large-scale federal
grant consolidation. [This] will
provide a more effective

mechanism for making
compensatory education
effective."
'Comp Ed'
"Comp Ed" can't be analyzed
for effectiveness without a
school-by-school comparison, the
University educator told the
congressmen.
"You cannot have
compensation without having an
equal base at each school so that
federal funds provide 'more than
equal' for the disadvantaged," he
told the committee. "All our
studies reveal that the schools
with the greatest need have the
least amount of money allocated
to them by the central office."
While the information on what
does work is sketchy or
nonexistent, Prof. Kirst said, his
studies have shown what doesn't
work.
