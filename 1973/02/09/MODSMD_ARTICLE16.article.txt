# Stanford Finance Report Urges Productivity Rise
## 
### ROBERT BACON 
Fiscal belt-tightening has been
combined with continued
innovation and creativity in recent
years at Stanford, Provost William
Miller writes in the University's
1972 financial report, published
this week.
University business
management must work to
increase the productivity of
people as well as of invested
dollars, Robert Augsburger,
Vice-President for Business and
Finance, adds in a companion
article.
The two administrators'
comments preface the tables
showing the University's income,
expenditures, and financial
position.
Miller, who titles his discussion
"Reflections on university
management in a period of
dynamic equilibrium," points out
that although the University's
growth has slowed considerably,
the rate of change has not.
Decision-Making
He notes that the Budget
Adjustment Program (BAP), in
reducing University expenditures

by $6 million over a five-year
period ending in 1974, "is having
profound side-effects in changing
the mode of academic decision
making," especially by increasing
the use of long-term and
Universitywide planning.
He lists "the four principal
elements that enter a decision
about the future of a program" as
academic importance, student
interest—present and anticipated,
probability of excellence, and the
likelihood of secure and adequate
funding.
Miller points to the Research
Development Fund and University
Progress Fund, which have been
established despite BAP to
provide funds for innovative and
experimental research and
teaching.
Most Effectively
Augsburger cites as the
challenge to the University's
non-academic administration "to
focus the talents" of faculty and
staff "to serve the teaching and
research functions most
effectively."
He cites programs for increased
efficiency in non-academic
management instituted during his

first year at Stanford.
The other important aspect of
his role is the management of the
University's capital assets, and he
stresses that "if we are to
continue as a first-rate institution,
we must also be a first-rate
investor."
Investment Management
Augsburger, an investment
banker before he came to
Stanford, describes steps that have
been taken to diversify both the
University's portfolio and its
investment management
techniques in order to produce a
higher rate of return on
investments.
He also notes Stanford's
unusual position of being required
to provide municipal services (fire,
police, streets and utilities),
without a tax base to support the
services. He calls this "one of the
principal issues facing Stanford"
and says that "we will of necessity
hold them [services] to the
absolute minimum required."
The financial statements reveal
that Stanford's operating
expenditures topped $200 million
during 1971-72, including all
auxiliary activities. Of this, about
$87 million went to teaching and
research. The remainder was
spread among the Hospital, SLAC,
student aid, housing and food
services, and myriad other
activities.
Principal sources of income
were $47 million in government
grants, $32 million in gifts, and
$30 million in tuition.
The University's endowment
funds have a market value of
about $346 million. In addition,
the physical plant is valued at
about $229 million. The total
value of Stanford's assets stands at
$644 million, up from $591
million in 1971.

management instituted during his

first year at Stanford.
The other important aspect of
his role is the management of the
University's capital assets, and he
stresses that "if we are to
continue as a first-rate institution,
we must also be a first-rate
investor."
Investment Management
Augsburger, an investment
banker before he came to
Stanford, describes steps that have
been taken to diversify both the
University's portfolio and its
investment management
techniques in order to produce a
higher rate of return on
investments.
He also notes Stanford's
unusual position of being required
to provide municipal services (fire,
police, streets and utilities),
without a tax base to support the
services. He calls this "one of the
principal issues facing Stanford"
and says that "we will of necessity
hold them [services] to the
absolute minimum required."
The financial statements reveal
that Stanford's operating
expenditures topped $200 million
during 1971-72, including all
auxiliary activities. Of this, about
$87 million went to teaching and
research. The remainder was
spread among the Hospital, SLAC,
student aid, housing and food
services, and myriad other
activities.
Principal sources of income
were $47 million in government
grants, $32 million in gifts, and
$30 million in tuition.
The University's endowment
funds have a market value of
about $346 million. In addition,
the physical plant is valued at
about $229 million. The total
value of Stanford's assets stands at
$644 million, up from $591
million in 1971.

IT WENT THATAWAY—Three persons retrace the course of an errant
frisbee which, while sailing down a hallway in Mirrielees House
Wednesday night, hit the sprinkler head shown. The impact broke the
head's fusible link, causing water to come shooting down and flooding
the hall and 12 adjoining rooms.
Fiscal belt-tightening has been
combined with continued
innovation and creativity in recent
years at Stanford, Provost William
Miller writes in the University's
1972 financial report, published
this week.
University business
management must work to
increase the productivity of
people as well as of invested
dollars, Robert Augsburger,
Vice-President for Business and
Finance, adds in a companion
article.
The two administrators'
comments preface the tables
showing the University's income,
expenditures, and financial
position.
Miller, who titles his discussion
"Reflections on university
management in a period of
dynamic equilibrium," points out
that although the University's
growth has slowed considerably,
the rate of change has not.
Decision-Making
He notes that the Budget
Adjustment Program (BAP), in
reducing University expenditures

by $6 million over a five-year
period ending in 1974, "is having
profound side-effects in changing
the mode of academic decision
making," especially by increasing
the use of long-term and
Universitywide planning.
He lists "the four principal
elements that enter a decision
about the future of a program" as
academic importance, student
interest—present and anticipated,
probability of excellence, and the
likelihood of secure and adequate
funding.
Miller points to the Research
Development Fund and University
Progress Fund, which have been
established despite BAP to
provide funds for innovative and
experimental research and
teaching.
Most Effectively
Augsburger cites as the
challenge to the University's
non-academic administration "to
focus the talents" of faculty and
staff "to serve the teaching and
research functions most
effectively."
He cites programs for increased
efficiency in non-academic
management instituted during his

first year at Stanford.
