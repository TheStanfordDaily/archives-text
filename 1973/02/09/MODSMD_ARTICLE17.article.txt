# Local Abortion Laws To Remain Intact
## 
### BRUCE KADDEN 
The recent Supreme Court
decision granting American
women the right to have medical
abortions during the first six
months of pregnancy has had
little affect on California laws or
local procedure in unwanted
pregnancy cases.
California's 1967 Therapeutic
Abortion Act permitted abortions
during the first 20 weeks of
pregnancy if a hospital committee
agreed that delivering the child
would "gravely impair" the
woman's physical or mental
health.
The U.S. Supreme Court's
ruling is basically the same as a
November ruling by the California
Supreme Court, which clarified
the 1967 Act.
Justice Harry A. Blackmun,
speaking for the majority in the
7-2 decision rendered Jan. 22, said
the state cannot interfere with the
judgement of a woman and her
doctor during the first three
months.
Maternal Health
In the second three month
period, he said the state could
only regulate abortion procedures
in ways that are "reasonably
related to maternal health," such
as supervising the licensing of
physicians, clinics, and hospitals.
Blackmun defined the period
when a state regulation to protect
the unborn child is important and
logical as after the 24th to 28th
week, which extends the time in
which California women could

legally obtain an abortion.
Stanford Hospital's procedure
for handling cases changed very
little after the decision. Gary
Cavalli, hospital spokesman, said
there used to be a committee
needed to review each case, but
now only one doctor is necessary.
A woman can either be
referred by a private physician or
come to the out-patient clinic,
Cavalli said. He added that the
procedure is then "the same as
with any other surgical patient,"
with regards to standard
pre-surgical tests and release
forms.
Cavalli said that it is "too early
to tell" whether the change in the
law will effect the number of
abortions. Last year Stanford
Hospital performed more
abortions than any other hospital
in Santa Clara County, according
to a state report.
The Cowell Student Health
Center's procedure concerning
problem pregnancy is also
basically the same. Dr. James B.
McClenahan, Cowell's director,
said that when a woman comes
asking to be referred for an
abortion, the doctor first
determines if she is pregnant, then
counsels her.
If she chooses to have an
abortion, she is referred to a
private gynecologist, to Stanford
Hospital, to Cathedral Hill
Medical Center in San Francisco,
or to another qualified clinic.
McClenahan said, 'The change
didn't have much affect on us

because of California's
regulations." The only change was
that previous to the decision, the
woman needed approval of a
psychiatrist before being referred
for an abortion.
Zero Population Growth
One group that is redirecting
its efforts because of the decision
is Zero Population Growth (ZPG).
Johnson Montgomery, president
of ZPG, and Judith Sanderowitz,
vice-president, said in a joint
statement, "The Supreme Court

decision represents a new birth of
freedom for American women."
Sanderowitz called on
anti-abortion "right to life"
groups "to work hard with us to
improve access to contraception,
thus eliminating the need for most
abortions.
Marilyn Thigpen, administrator
of the abortion information bank
for ZPG, said she was surprised by
the large drop in the number of
calls she has gotten requesting
referral since the decision.

the 1967 Act.
Justice Harry A. Blackmun,
speaking for the majority in the
7-2 decision rendered Jan. 22, said
the state cannot interfere with the
judgement of a woman and her
doctor during the first three
months.
Maternal Health
In the second three month
period, he said the state could
only regulate abortion procedures
in ways that are "reasonably
related to maternal health," such
as supervising the licensing of
physicians, clinics, and hospitals.
Blackmun defined the period
when a state regulation to protect
the unborn child is important and
logical as after the 24th to 28th
week, which extends the time in
which California women could

legally obtain an abortion.
Stanford Hospital's procedure
for handling cases changed very
little after the decision. Gary
Cavalli, hospital spokesman, said
there used to be a committee
needed to review each case, but
now only one doctor is necessary.
A woman can either be
referred by a private physician or
come to the out-patient clinic,
Cavalli said. He added that the
procedure is then "the same as
with any other surgical patient,"
with regards to standard
pre-surgical tests and release
forms.
Cavalli said that it is "too early
to tell" whether the change in the
law will effect the number of
abortions. Last year Stanford
Hospital performed more
abortions than any other hospital
in Santa Clara County, according
to a state report.
The Cowell Student Health
Center's procedure concerning
problem pregnancy is also
basically the same. Dr. James B.
McClenahan, Cowell's director,
said that when a woman comes
asking to be referred for an
abortion, the doctor first
determines if she is pregnant, then
counsels her.
If she chooses to have an
abortion, she is referred to a
private gynecologist, to Stanford
Hospital, to Cathedral Hill
Medical Center in San Francisco,
or to another qualified clinic.
McClenahan said, 'The change
didn't have much affect on us

because of California's
regulations." The only change was
that previous to the decision, the
woman needed approval of a
psychiatrist before being referred
for an abortion.
Zero Population Growth
One group that is redirecting
its efforts because of the decision
is Zero Population Growth (ZPG).
Johnson Montgomery, president
of ZPG, and Judith Sanderowitz,
vice-president, said in a joint
statement, "The Supreme Court

decision represents a new birth of
freedom for American women."
Sanderowitz called on
anti-abortion "right to life"
groups "to work hard with us to
improve access to contraception,
thus eliminating the need for most
abortions.
Marilyn Thigpen, administrator
of the abortion information bank
for ZPG, said she was surprised by
the large drop in the number of
calls she has gotten requesting
referral since the decision.
The recent Supreme Court
decision granting American
women the right to have medical
abortions during the first six
months of pregnancy has had
little affect on California laws or
local procedure in unwanted
pregnancy cases.
California's 1967 Therapeutic
Abortion Act permitted abortions
during the first 20 weeks of
pregnancy if a hospital committee
agreed that delivering the child
would "gravely impair" the
woman's physical or mental
health.
The U.S. Supreme Court's
ruling is basically the same as a
November ruling by the California
Supreme Court, which clarified
the 1967 Act.
