# Irish's Son Dies In Rome
## 
### 
Lee Irish, 13, son of Asst. Religion Prof. Jerry A.
Irish, died of acute meningitis in Rome early this
week, the University has announced.
Irish was with his wife and family on a semester
holiday field trip to Rome with students from the
Stanford-in-Germany campus when the youth died.
Precautions have been taken against the disease,
and the students are expected to return to classes
Monday, the University said.
Because of Italian telephone and mail strikes,
further details were unavailable.

Besides his parents, the youth is survived by a
brother, Jeff. Another brother, Mark, died a few
years ago at age four.
A service of thanksgiving for the life of Lee Irish
will be held in the Sanctuary of First Presbyterian
Church, Palo Alto, Sunday at 6 p.m.
The thanksgiving service will consist of
comments about Lee, folk songs, and prayers. Those
who wish are invited to bring cheese, bread, wine or
juice to share with others.
