# Sheriffs Won't Patrol Maples 'Dead' Concert
## 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
Security for tonight's Grateful
Dead concert at Maples Pavilion will
be handled almost exclusively by
Stanford security officers rather than
Santa Clara County Sheriff's deputies.
The change was necessitated when
the county phased out its previous
policy of providing deputies at a fee to
handle security for special events.
Security has posed a major problem
at some previous campus conceits.
Fights and gate crashers marred
August, 1971 Cold Blood and
October, 1972 Miles Davis appearances
— both in Frost Amphitheater.
However, the last concert to be held in
Maples — Stephen Stills' Nov. 8,1972
show — went smoothly.
Sheriffs Lt. Bob Lees said
yesterday that the county had
abandoned its contract-fee security
program at the end of November. He
said it was possible that the county
would assign extra units to the north
county area tonight, but that they
would probably not be at the concert
"unless something happens."
Parking Headache
Capt. Frank Benaderet of the
Stanford Police Services Department
said that the department anticipates
no problems in policing the expected
8000 people, but that parking may
turn into a headache for officers.
Because of construction on Sam
McDonald Road and behind the
Pavilion, an estimated 700-1000
parking spaces normally utilized at
large-attendance events will be

unavailable, and Benaderet asked that
concert-goers not drive if possible.
Benaderet said the University
officers would use "the exact same
deployment as the Jan. 12
UCLA-Stanford [basketball] game" in
Maples.
He said this would consist of about
20 officers, with most of them
handling traffic control and parking.
There will be a "token" number of
security officers inside the building,
"perhaps three to five to begin with,
and maybe up to 10 if they're
needed," he said.
No Problems Expected
"If a mob arises or something, we'll
call the Sheriff's office .. . but we do
not anticipate any problems."
Capt. Wes Johnson, the Sheriffs
office patrol commander, said
yesterday he would consult with
Stanford security chief Marvin
Herrington today before deciding
whether to assign additional officers to
the area.
Neither Johnson nor Lees — the
Sheriffs office community relations
officer — say they plan to be in the
north county area tonight.
Benaderet said that to his
knowledge, the University has not yet
requested additional county units to
be in the area. He said he thought the
ASSU, which is sponsoring the
concert, would have student security
people on hand, but ASSU Special
Events Director Ron Shannon could
not be reached for confirmation.
