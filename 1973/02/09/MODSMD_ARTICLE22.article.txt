# 'Images' Opens In S.F.
## 
### JON R. KENNEDY 
Director Robert Altman was in
the City promoting his current
film, "Images," which opened
Wednesday at the Vogue in San
Francisco. Over lunch in the
Vienna Room at the Mark
Hopkins, he reflected about what
audiences are going to see and
allowed that "Images" may not be
a box office smash.
It's that kind of film.
"Bergmanesque," I suggested, to
which Altman offered that while
writing the story in 1968, during
the filming of "That Cold Day In
the Park," he had been
influenced by Bergman's
"Personna."
"Images" is about a woman,
the wife of a wealthy young
executive, who is haunted by
imaginary characters, including
her own double, doubles of her
husband and a male friend of the
family, and the ghost of a former
"French lover" she lost years
before in a plane crash.
She doesn't know whether the
images are real or imaginary most
of the time, and the audience is
also confused about what's really
happening until the end. It's a
characterization that won the best

actress honor for Susannah York
of the Cannes Film Festival, and
Altman and Columbia are hoping
it might even get her an Oscar
nomination. But everyone is
saying Cicely Tyson ("Sounder"),
Diana Ross ("Lady Sings the
Blues"), and Liza Minelli
("Cabaret") already have
nominations sewed up, and those
are odds even Susannah's director
isn't betting against.
Paranoia and schizophrenia are
the medical terms brought to
mind by the lead character in
"Images." She gets threatening
telephone calls from what turns
out to be her own double. Her
husband turns into that former
lover while trying to console her,
driving her into hysteria. While en
route from their place in the city
to their country house, she leaves
her car at the side of the road,
walks over to a cliff, and sees her
double driving the car she just left
into their front yard off in the
distance.
The film's main practical value
will be giving those who see it
some genuine insights into what
happens in the mind of a
schizophrenic and maybe
clarifying what "insanity" as a

plea to a murder charge means.
But it isn't based on psychological
research or even extensive reading
by Altman. "I just wanted to do
what appealed to me for the
character," he admits. After the
screenplay was finished, however,
psychiatrists who read it thought
it a valid portrayal.
"Images" is Altman's own
baby, something far different
from "M*A*S*H," his most
popular film which he received as
a screenplay after others had
rejected it. It is more like "That
Cold Day In the Park," and he
takes pride in saying the film is
something he wanted to create,
something that communicates a
message for him rather than just a
work project calculated to appeal
to the widest possible audience.
There are directors who put all
the data into a computer to find
out what audiences will go to see,
and then create what they're
asking for. That's how "What's Up
Doc," the Peter Bagdonovich
comedy that's already grossed $22
million, came to follow "The Last
Picture Show," he surmises.
So far, the New York and Los
Angeles critics have been divided
in their reactions to "Images."

"Those who've hated my stuff in
the past - Rex Reed, for example,
and some of the popular-audience
and TV reviewers—have hated it.
But, surprisingly, the New York
Daily News gave it four stars, and
Judith Crist liked it. Women see
something in it a lot of the men
miss."
-The critics didn't go for
Altman's "Brewster McCloud"
that much either, though he
considers the fantasy about a
fallen guardian angel trying to
teach her charge to fly his best
film. American critics generally
panned "Brewster," one of their
biggest gripes being that most of
the dialogue was ad libbed. But
the Berkeley Film Quarterly
thought it one of the most
significant releases of 1971, and it
has been enthusiastically received
by college-age audiences.

ROBERT A LTM AN—Director of the newly-released film "Images" was recently in San Francisco
promoting his film. The star of "Images," Susannah York, won the best actress honor at the Cannes Film
Festival.
Director Robert Altman was in
the City promoting his current
film, "Images," which opened
Wednesday at the Vogue in San
Francisco. Over lunch in the
Vienna Room at the Mark
Hopkins, he reflected about what
audiences are going to see and
allowed that "Images" may not be
a box office smash.
It's that kind of film.
"Bergmanesque," I suggested, to
which Altman offered that while
writing the story in 1968, during
the filming of "That Cold Day In
the Park," he had been
influenced by Bergman's
"Personna."
"Images" is about a woman,
the wife of a wealthy young
executive, who is haunted by
imaginary characters, including
her own double, doubles of her
husband and a male friend of the
family, and the ghost of a former
"French lover" she lost years
before in a plane crash.
She doesn't know whether the
images are real or imaginary most
of the time, and the audience is
also confused about what's really
happening until the end. It's a
characterization that won the best

actress honor for Susannah York
of the Cannes Film Festival, and
Altman and Columbia are hoping
it might even get her an Oscar
nomination. But everyone is
saying Cicely Tyson ("Sounder"),
Diana Ross ("Lady Sings the
Blues"), and Liza Minelli
("Cabaret") already have
nominations sewed up, and those
are odds even Susannah's director
isn't betting against.
Paranoia and schizophrenia are
the medical terms brought to
mind by the lead character in
"Images." She gets threatening
telephone calls from what turns
out to be her own double. Her
husband turns into that former
lover while trying to console her,
driving her into hysteria. While en
route from their place in the city
to their country house, she leaves
her car at the side of the road,
walks over to a cliff, and sees her
double driving the car she just left
into their front yard off in the
distance.
The film's main practical value
will be giving those who see it
some genuine insights into what
happens in the mind of a
schizophrenic and maybe
clarifying what "insanity" as a

plea to a murder charge means.
But it isn't based on psychological
research or even extensive reading
by Altman. "I just wanted to do
what appealed to me for the
character," he admits. After the
screenplay was finished, however,
psychiatrists who read it thought
it a valid portrayal.
"Images" is Altman's own
baby, something far different
from "M*A*S*H," his most
popular film which he received as
a screenplay after others had
rejected it. It is more like "That
Cold Day In the Park," and he
takes pride in saying the film is
something he wanted to create,
something that communicates a
message for him rather than just a
work project calculated to appeal
to the widest possible audience.
There are directors who put all
the data into a computer to find
out what audiences will go to see,
and then create what they're
asking for. That's how "What's Up
Doc," the Peter Bagdonovich
comedy that's already grossed $22
million, came to follow "The Last
Picture Show," he surmises.
So far, the New York and Los
Angeles critics have been divided
in their reactions to "Images."

"Those who've hated my stuff in
the past - Rex Reed, for example,
and some of the popular-audience
and TV reviewers—have hated it.
But, surprisingly, the New York
Daily News gave it four stars, and
Judith Crist liked it. Women see
something in it a lot of the men
miss."
-The critics didn't go for
Altman's "Brewster McCloud"
that much either, though he
considers the fantasy about a
fallen guardian angel trying to
teach her charge to fly his best
film. American critics generally
panned "Brewster," one of their
biggest gripes being that most of
the dialogue was ad libbed. But
the Berkeley Film Quarterly
thought it one of the most
significant releases of 1971, and it
has been enthusiastically received
by college-age audiences.
