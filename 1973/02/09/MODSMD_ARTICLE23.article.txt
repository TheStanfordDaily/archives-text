# Al Green, Spinners Captivate Capacity Crowd In Oakland
## 
### DAN FORTE 
The term "superstar" is often misused, but in the
case of soul singer Al Green, it is far from being an
exageration. On Friday night, Feb. 2, Green came to
the Oakland Coliseum where he was met by a
sell-out crowd.
The show started at 8:30 with a group called The
Silvers. Whatever this vocal sextet (consisting of 2
girls and 4 guys) might have lacked musically or
vocally was more than made up for theatrically.
They put on om 112 the best displays of precision
soul stepping I've ever seen.
Next up was The Spinners, a five-man vocal with
a style of polished professionalism reminiscent of
the old Temptations. The group proved to be a real
crowd pleaser, especially when they did a medley of
imitations of some of the older soul groups. This
included "Do You Love Me" (The Contours),
"Don't Mess With Bill" (The Marvellettes),
"Mickey's Monkey" (The Miracles), "Stop In The
Name Of Love" (The Supremes), "Reach Out, I'll
Be There" (The Four Tops), "Aiift Too Proud To
Beg" (The Temptations), and "Fingertips" (Stevie
Wonder). The Spinners ended their set with their
new hit "Could It Be I'm Falling In Love."
After a fifteen minute intermission came the
only unexciting part of the evening, a comedian. I
can think of no better way to slow down a show.
Then the sell-out audience finally got what it
came for as Al Green took the stage singing "You
Oughta Be With Me." There was an immediate
outburst of controlled hysteria. At the end of the
song, Green had to ask the audience to please take
their seats, which they did in practically no time at
all.

For his next song Green sang his first big hit,
"Tired Of Being Alone." In my opinion, this was his
best song of the night. Al Green has had so many
huge hits that the show was almost like a "Best of
Al Green" album performed live.
Slow Medley
After a great version of "Look What You Done
For Me," Green did a slow medley of "How Can
You Mend A Broken Heart?", "It's Over," and "For
The Good Times." Besides having one of the best
voices of any contemporary singer, Al Green has
more stage presence than almost any performer I've
ever seen.
Next was "Love and Happiness," followed by a
beautiful rendition of "I'm Still In Love With You."
Unlike many performers who start big and finish big
with a half an hour of mediocrity in between, Al
Green kept the spirit high for the entire time he was
on stage. Every song brought down the house.
Green ended the set by singing his "national
anthem," "Let's Stay Together." Naturally he got a
huge ovation, but he didnt return for an encore, which
I thought was pretty lousy, considering the price of
the tickets and the length of his set.
Watching these three soul groups I noticed that
they all had one thing which is almost completely
lacking in most of today's rock groups, and that's
showmanship. Some may think that showmanship is
corny or outdated, but, in my opinion, if a
performer isn't willing to admit that his main aim is
to please his audience, then he is hardly worth
paying to see. Al Green gave his audience about as
much as they could possibly ask for.
Al Green's latest album is "Green Is Blues."

Beg" (The Temptations), and "Fingertips" (Stevie
Wonder). The Spinners ended their set with their
new hit "Could It Be I'm Falling In Love."
After a fifteen minute intermission came the
only unexciting part of the evening, a comedian. I
can think of no better way to slow down a show.
Then the sell-out audience finally got what it
came for as Al Green took the stage singing "You
Oughta Be With Me." There was an immediate
outburst of controlled hysteria. At the end of the
song, Green had to ask the audience to please take
their seats, which they did in practically no time at
all.

For his next song Green sang his first big hit,
"Tired Of Being Alone." In my opinion, this was his
best song of the night. Al Green has had so many
huge hits that the show was almost like a "Best of
Al Green" album performed live.
Slow Medley
After a great version of "Look What You Done
For Me," Green did a slow medley of "How Can
You Mend A Broken Heart?", "It's Over," and "For
The Good Times." Besides having one of the best
voices of any contemporary singer, Al Green has
more stage presence than almost any performer I've
ever seen.
Next was "Love and Happiness," followed by a
beautiful rendition of "I'm Still In Love With You."
Unlike many performers who start big and finish big
with a half an hour of mediocrity in between, Al
Green kept the spirit high for the entire time he was
on stage. Every song brought down the house.
Green ended the set by singing his "national
anthem," "Let's Stay Together." Naturally he got a
huge ovation, but he didnt return for an encore, which
I thought was pretty lousy, considering the price of
the tickets and the length of his set.
Watching these three soul groups I noticed that
they all had one thing which is almost completely
lacking in most of today's rock groups, and that's
showmanship. Some may think that showmanship is
corny or outdated, but, in my opinion, if a
performer isn't willing to admit that his main aim is
to please his audience, then he is hardly worth
paying to see. Al Green gave his audience about as
much as they could possibly ask for.
Al Green's latest album is "Green Is Blues."
The term "superstar" is often misused, but in the
case of soul singer Al Green, it is far from being an
exageration. On Friday night, Feb. 2, Green came to
the Oakland Coliseum where he was met by a
sell-out crowd.
The show started at 8:30 with a group called The
Silvers. Whatever this vocal sextet (consisting of 2
girls and 4 guys) might have lacked musically or
vocally was more than made up for theatrically.
They put on om 112 the best displays of precision
soul stepping I've ever seen.
Next up was The Spinners, a five-man vocal with
a style of polished professionalism reminiscent of
the old Temptations. The group proved to be a real
crowd pleaser, especially when they did a medley of
imitations of some of the older soul groups. This
included "Do You Love Me" (The Contours),
"Don't Mess With Bill" (The Marvellettes),
"Mickey's Monkey" (The Miracles), "Stop In The
Name Of Love" (The Supremes), "Reach Out, I'll
Be There" (The Four Tops), "Aiift Too Proud To
Beg" (The Temptations), and "Fingertips" (Stevie
Wonder). The Spinners ended their set with their
