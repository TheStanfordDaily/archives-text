# I Musici:
## Meeting Of Imaginative Minds 
### BRUCE LAMOTT 
One looks in vain to find the
mastermind among the twelve
musicians comprising I Musici di
Roma, who performed chamber
music for strings with harpsichord
in Memorial Auditorium Sunday
afternoon. Having performed
without conductor for twenty
years, they play with a single
intimate knowledge of musical
detail.
The tranquil, patient line of
the Pastorale movement of the
Corelli Christmas Concerto Grosso
greeted the tardy reviewer, who
immediately regretted having
missed a single more of their
performance.
Stepping from among the
violins, Arnaldo Apostoli played
the Vivaldi concerto, II Favorito,
with spirit and clarity. The
ensemble, intent on his every
nuance, supported with
singularity of tempo, attack, and
inflection. The accompaniment to
the lyrical Andante was fragile
and precise, giving him complete
flexibility with the melodic line.
The final Allegro, though short on
musical substance, avoided the
routine scrubbing often
encountered in Vivaldi
performances.
I Musici prefers a longer, less
articulated line than is
characteristic of historical
performance practice of Baroque
music. Nonetheless, they
demonstrate grace and elegance
which avoids the romantic
excesses of other interpreters.

Though the solo lines were
sparingly ornamented, subtleties
in dynamic and rhythmic accent
revealed the intrinsic elaboration
of the melody.
The persistence of the opening
of Vivaldi's D Minor Concerto
Grosso from L'Estro Armonico
generated a pent-up excitement
constrained by a conservative
tempo, then released in the fugal
interplay which followed. The
dialogue between violins and
cellos proves that interesting
melodic activity, far more than
speed, is responsible for the
energy in this music. Robert
Michelucci played a delicate,
long-breathed melody to the
sensitive accompaniment of the
upper strings in the Largo.
The program proceeded from

the sublime to the ridiculous.
Contrasted with the familiarity of
the Baroque works, the
outrageous Great Duo
Concertante for Violin,
Doublebass and Strings by
Bottesini is little-known, nor
perhaps should it be. An
unapologetic display piece for
virtuoso contrabassist Lucio
Buccarella with violinist Luciano
Vicari, it consists of pyrotechnical
variations applied to the most
banal melodies.
The work opens with a series
of melodramatic cadenzas, leading
one to believe he has just walked
in on the end of a
concertoâ€”perhaps several. These
lapse into sections suggesting
rejected arias from obscure Italian
operas, accompanied by harmonic

arpeggiations in the contrabass.
On occasion, the bass even plays
melodies above the violin.
One thanks the natural
selection of music history for
protecting Rossini's reputation
from works such as his Sonata No.
1 for Violins, Cellos and
Contrabass. While the Bottesini is
camp, this Rossini composition is
merely vacuous, though given
every chance by I Musici.
A Mozart encore, from the
Divertimento, K. 139,
demonstrated careful attention to
detail and nuance, while
maintaining lightness and humor.
In all, every interpretation of I
Musici results from the meeting of
twelve highly imaginative musical
minds.
