# Crucial Pac-8 Weekend
## Kelley Leads Cards Against Ducks, OSU 
### STAN WILSON 
The Stanford Cardinals,
coming off a convincing 73-68
win over California, could move
into third place in the Pac-Eight
Conference with a pair of victories
this weekend.
But it won't be an easy task, as
the Cards travel to rain-soaked
Oregon to face the league's top
individual scorer, Oregon's Doug
Little, and the league's most
productive offensive team, the
Oregon State Beavers.
Little is averaging 20.0 points
per game in five league contests
this season. The rugged 6-3
forward, nicknamed "Cowboy"
for reasons which are readily
apparent to his opposition, is the
only senior in Oregon's young
starting lineup.
Oregon State leads the
conference with an average of
78.6 points a game. The Cards face
the Beavers in the Pac-Eight TV
game of the week on Saturday
afternoon, after tonight's contest
against the Ducks in Oregon's
ancient Mac Arthur Court.
Kelley Honored
Stanford's sophomore center,

Rich Kelley, who scored 28 points
against Cal last weekend, was
named Northern California Player
of the Week. Kelley ranks fourth
in the conference in scoring with a
17.4 average, and second in
rebounding with 11.2. But despite
his impressive statistics, assistant
coach Bub Bowling says that the
talented seven-footer is "going to
get a lot better."
"I don't think there's a better
sophomore center in the West,"
Bowling added.
Bowling had good words to say
about the Cards victory over Cal
last weekend, in which Stanford
fought off a second half rally by
the Bears to win. "We showed
poise," he said, "in contrast to
early in December when we lost
three games in the last minutes."
Frost Doubtful
Stanford may have to play this
weekend without the services of
junior forward Dave Frost, who
has been bothered by recurring
back muscle spasms. Head coach
Howie Dallmar expressed doubts
over whether Frost would be able
to compete. But Frost, who
played only a few minutes last

week, was more optimistic.
"I feel alright," he said on
Wednesday. "I think I could play
tonight if I had to, and by the
weekend I should feel that much
better."
Senior captain Bob Buell will
start in place of Frost. The 6-5
leaper will be joined by Kelley,
junior forward Mike Mann (6-9),
and sophomore guards Mel
Arterberry (6-4) and Mark Gilberg
(6-0). Freshman Tim Patterson
(6-11), and soph Scott Trobbe
(6-6), and junior Steve Shupe

should see plenty of action.
"Trobbe will play a lot this
weekend," Dallmar said. "He had
a real good performance against
Cal. We intend to substitute even
more freely because of the Friday
night and Saturday afternoon
games."
OSU Tough
Oregon State should be the
more difficult of the two
opponents, but both teams are
extremely tough to beat at home.
Coach Ralph Miller's Beavers have
won five straight games, including
two in a row over Oregon. Oregon
State is led by senior forward Sam
Whitehead, who is averaging 14.2
points per game. Freshman Paul
Miller, who joins Whitehead at the
other forward position, is second
for the Beavers with a 12.3
average.
Veteran Neal Jurgensen, a 6-9
center, and guards Ron Jones
(6-4) and Charles Neal (6-2) will
also start for the Beavers.
Another factor may be the

performance of 6-11 reserve Steve
Ericksen, who started for OSU
last season. "I don't know why
Ericksen isn't playing," Dallmar
said. "I think he'll play more
against us because of our height."
The Ducks, 0-14 in the
Conference last season, are 2-3 in
the league so far this year with
wins over Washington and
Washington State. Oregon
dropped a one point decision to
USC a few weeks ago.

Card offense in the last three weeks with his clutch outside shooting
and floor play. Gilberg and Mel Arterberry will be in the
backcourt tonight when Stanford meets Oregon in Eugene.
