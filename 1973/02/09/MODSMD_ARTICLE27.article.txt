# JV Cagers Seek .500 Mark
## 
### MARK WHITE 
Stanford's junior varsity
basketball team will try to
improve on its 2-5 road record
when the Cards play the
University of Pacific frosh tonight
at 6 p.m. in Stockton and take on
Merritt College the following
evening in Oakland at 8 p.m.
With an overall record of 5-6,
the Cardinals will open the second
half of their season trying to get
back to the .500 mark. If past
performances are any indication,
Stanford should come out on top
in both games this weekend. The
last eight JV games have been won
and lost in pairs each weekend

and if the trend continues, last
week's losses to California and
Santa Clara should pave the way
for wins this weekend.
Another important factor is
that the Cards have already
defeated UOP's Tigers. On Jan. 13
UOP fell to the Cards, 58-49, after
UOP showed up with only five
players. With no reserves to spell
them, the Tiger starters showed
good endurance in lasting the
entire game.
Size vs. Quickness
The UOP five was led by Greg
Eccles, a quick 6-1 forward who
scored 16 points and 5-10 guard
Alan Westover, who scored 14.

Although they gave away much in
height, the UOP players outran
and outhustled the Cards most of
the game. With some reserves on
the bench at home, the Tigers
should improve and the game may
turn into a battle between size
and quickness.
If this is the case, 6-9 Ed
Schweitzer will again play a major
role for Stanford. In the game
against UOP last month,
Schweitzer scored 24 points and
grabbed 15 rebounds. Schweitzer
has been averaging nearly 21
points a game this season,
shooting at a 49 percent clip, and
averaging 12 rebounds a contest.
But Schweitzer alone can not
defeat a team; it will take at least
one more good Cardinal scoring
performance to insure a Stanford
victory.
Need Outside Scoring
Although they are connecting
on 45% of their shots, the Cards
need more scoring from their
outside men. The loss to Cal was
indicative of most of the other
losses Stanford has suffered this
season; opponent postmen
collapse on Schweitzer, making it
difficult to get the ball into him,
and the Card wings fail to shoot
effectively. A similar pattern has
evolved in Stanford's victories,
except that the wings score.
In their best games, the 87-62
victory over Sacramento State and
the 72-54 win over UC Davis, Dale
Peters and Kevin Enright scored
14 and 20 points respectively in
backing up Schweitzer. Similar
performances by any of four
other Cards will maximize
Stanford's chances for a pair of
wins this weekend.

With an overall record of 5-6,
the Cardinals will open the second
half of their season trying to get
back to the .500 mark. If past
performances are any indication,
Stanford should come out on top
in both games this weekend. The
last eight JV games have been won
and lost in pairs each weekend

and if the trend continues, last
week's losses to California and
Santa Clara should pave the way
for wins this weekend.
Another important factor is
that the Cards have already
defeated UOP's Tigers. On Jan. 13
UOP fell to the Cards, 58-49, after
UOP showed up with only five
players. With no reserves to spell
them, the Tiger starters showed
good endurance in lasting the
entire game.
Size vs. Quickness
The UOP five was led by Greg
Eccles, a quick 6-1 forward who
scored 16 points and 5-10 guard
Alan Westover, who scored 14.

Although they gave away much in
height, the UOP players outran
and outhustled the Cards most of
the game. With some reserves on
the bench at home, the Tigers
should improve and the game may
turn into a battle between size
and quickness.
If this is the case, 6-9 Ed
Schweitzer will again play a major
role for Stanford. In the game
against UOP last month,
Schweitzer scored 24 points and
grabbed 15 rebounds. Schweitzer
has been averaging nearly 21
points a game this season,
shooting at a 49 percent clip, and
averaging 12 rebounds a contest.
But Schweitzer alone can not
defeat a team; it will take at least
one more good Cardinal scoring
performance to insure a Stanford
victory.
Need Outside Scoring
Although they are connecting
on 45% of their shots, the Cards
need more scoring from their
outside men. The loss to Cal was
indicative of most of the other
losses Stanford has suffered this
season; opponent postmen
collapse on Schweitzer, making it
difficult to get the ball into him,
and the Card wings fail to shoot
effectively. A similar pattern has
evolved in Stanford's victories,
except that the wings score.
In their best games, the 87-62
victory over Sacramento State and
the 72-54 win over UC Davis, Dale
Peters and Kevin Enright scored
14 and 20 points respectively in
backing up Schweitzer. Similar
performances by any of four
other Cards will maximize
Stanford's chances for a pair of
wins this weekend.
Stanford's junior varsity
basketball team will try to
improve on its 2-5 road record
when the Cards play the
University of Pacific frosh tonight
at 6 p.m. in Stockton and take on
Merritt College the following
evening in Oakland at 8 p.m.
