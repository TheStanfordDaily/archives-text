# Shuffling The Cards
## Gilberg Revives Offense 
### Dave Robinson 
Stanford's formerly erratic offense has come
alive in the last three weeks and most people are
attributing the Card turnabout to the improved
scoring of 7-0 sophomore Rich Kelley and 6-11
freshman Tim Patterson.
True, Kelley and Patterson have averaged 42
points between them in Stanford's last three games.
But much of the credit for the Cards offensive
revival belongs to the smallest player on the
Stanford squad, 6-0 sophomore guard Mark Gilberg.
One of the people who recognizes Gilberg's
contribution is Stanford coach Howie Dallmar.
After Kelley scored 28 points in a superb effort
against California last week, Dallmar warned a group
of sportswriters, "You can talk about the big guy all
you want, but you better mention Mark Gilberg
too."
Gilberg scored only eight points against the
Bears, but his floor play was nearly flawless. He was
never bothered by Cal's full court man to man press
and was credited with seven assists.
Shooting Exhibition
The week before against UC Santa Barbara
Gilberg also displayed a deft shooting touch. He
connected on six of seven field goal attempts, five
coming from the 20 foot range. Gilberg added two
free throws for 16 points, his, highest output of the
season. 1 ,
GilbeTrg's shooting exhibition came as somewhat
of a surprise since he had been extremely hesitant to
shoot at all earlier in the season. "Mark doesn't have
a real quick jump shot and it's vulnerable to being
blocked," Dallmar explained. "Early in the year he
had some open shots but didn't know if he had time
to get the shot off.
"Now he's getting used to game situations and
has a better feel for when to shoot. Consequently
he's shooting more and shooting better."
Coach's Orders
Gilberg's own explanation was on little less
technical. "Coach Dallmar just told me to shoot

more," he said, "and I guess I'm a little more
relaxed after playing a lot of games."
It is ironic that anyone would have to tell Gilberg
to shoot since he averaged 34 points a game in high
school. But last year Gilberg shifted his attention to
play making with the Cards' talented frosh team. He
averaged 9.5 points a game but his major
contributions to the 17-3 squad were his quickness
and floor leadership.
"It wasn't hard to make the transition from a
scorer to a playmaker," Gilberg said, "but I think I
overdid it and now I'm having a hard time making
the transition back to a scorer."
Dallmar feels that when Gilberg looks toward the
basket as he has in Stanford's last three games,
things open considerably for Kelley, Patterson, and
Mike Mann underneath. "Mark has to hit from the
outside," Dallmar explained. "We're not a great
shooting teamâ€”if we do get that shooting from
Mark around the perimeter it certainly opens things
up for the big men inside."
Confuses Defense
The recent scoring totals by Kelley and Patterson
would seem to bear out Dallmar's statement.
Gilberg and his backcourt partner Mel Arterberry
are becoming increasingly adept at passing yie ball
inside to Stanford's big men and when Gilberg
scores from outside or penetrates the defense with
his twisting drives, opposing teams are unable to sag
inside or double-team Stanford's giants.
All this has meant more points for the Cards,
who hadn't even scored 80 points in a game until
three weeks ago against Utah. But now Stanford
stands a respectable fourth in the Pac-8 in scoring
offense going into this weekend's games against
Oregon and Oregon State.
And you can be sure that the Ducks and the
Beavers won't key their defenses just to Kelley 3hd
Patterson this weekend. Oregon coach Dick Harter
and Ralph Miller of Oregon State will make sure
that someone is watching Mark Gilberg.
