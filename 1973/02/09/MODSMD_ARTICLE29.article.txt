# Frosh Football Eligibility Okayed
## 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
President Lyman has approved
a recommendation made by the
Committee on Athletics, Physical
Education, and Recreation
(CAPER) which would allow
Stanford freshmen to compete in
varsity football beginning next fall
on a one year trial basis.
Stanford had been the only
school in the Pacific Eight
Conference which did not allow
freshman participation. The
previous Stanford ruling

prohibited freshmen from
competing in major varsity sports
(football and basketball) during
their first quarter at the
University.
This ruling became
controversial when basketball
coach Howie Dallmar requested
that the rule be waived so that
freshmen Tim Patterson and Ed
Schweitzer could open the season
with the Card varsity. Dallmar's
request was refused and the two
frosh had to wait until {he

completion of fall quarter before
they were able to play with the
varsity.
Strictly Voluntary
The new resolution proposed
by the twelve member
student-faculty committee and
approved by Lyman allows
freshman participation in all
sports with the provisions that
freshman participation is strictly
voluntary and that frosh athletes
must take part in the regular
freshman orientation program,
even' if it conflicts with a varsity
road trip.
The new ruling evoked
basically good reactions from
members of the athletic
department. "I still have
reservations about the freshman
rule as a whole," said Associate
Athletic Director Bob Young,
"but I don't think we should be
an island in the conference."
Young said that athletic
director Joe Reutz tried to abolish
all freshman participation in
football and basketball at the
annual meeting of the Pacific
Eight Council last month, but that
Reutz's resolution was defeated
7-1. After that defeat, athletic
department officials decided that
it would most benefit Stanford's
program to go along with the
other Pac-8 schools and allow
freshmen to compete.
Helps Recruiting
Football coach Jack
Christiansen feels that the new
ruling "will definitely help our
recruiting since we can tell
recruits that they'll be eligible to
compete as freshmen."
Christiansen said that he had
opposed last fall's NCAA ruling
which allowed freshmen to
compete for the first time in 1972
but that the outstanding
performances of several freshmen
around the country had changed
his feelings considerably.
Since Stanford loses 25 of last
year's 50 lettermen to graduation,
Christiansen sees 1973 "a year
where some freshmen could
possibly step in on the varsity."

on a one year trial basis.
Stanford had been the only
school in the Pacific Eight
Conference which did not allow
freshman participation. The
previous Stanford ruling

prohibited freshmen from
competing in major varsity sports
(football and basketball) during
their first quarter at the
University.
This ruling became
controversial when basketball
coach Howie Dallmar requested
that the rule be waived so that
freshmen Tim Patterson and Ed
Schweitzer could open the season
with the Card varsity. Dallmar's
request was refused and the two
frosh had to wait until {he

completion of fall quarter before
they were able to play with the
varsity.
Strictly Voluntary
The new resolution proposed
by the twelve member
student-faculty committee and
approved by Lyman allows
freshman participation in all
sports with the provisions that
freshman participation is strictly
voluntary and that frosh athletes
must take part in the regular
freshman orientation program,
even' if it conflicts with a varsity
road trip.
The new ruling evoked
basically good reactions from
members of the athletic
department. "I still have
reservations about the freshman
rule as a whole," said Associate
Athletic Director Bob Young,
"but I don't think we should be
an island in the conference."
Young said that athletic
director Joe Reutz tried to abolish
all freshman participation in
football and basketball at the
annual meeting of the Pacific
Eight Council last month, but that
Reutz's resolution was defeated
7-1. After that defeat, athletic
department officials decided that
it would most benefit Stanford's
program to go along with the
other Pac-8 schools and allow
freshmen to compete.
Helps Recruiting
Football coach Jack
Christiansen feels that the new
ruling "will definitely help our
recruiting since we can tell
recruits that they'll be eligible to
compete as freshmen."
Christiansen said that he had
opposed last fall's NCAA ruling
which allowed freshmen to
compete for the first time in 1972
but that the outstanding
performances of several freshmen
around the country had changed
his feelings considerably.
Since Stanford loses 25 of last
year's 50 lettermen to graduation,
Christiansen sees 1973 "a year
where some freshmen could
possibly step in on the varsity."
