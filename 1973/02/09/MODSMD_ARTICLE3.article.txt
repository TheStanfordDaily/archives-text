# Academic Senate Postpones Affirmative Action Decision
## 
### MARK SIMONIAN 
The Faculty Senate yesterday voted
to postpone decisions on the two
major issues on its agenda.
The Senate left unresolved the
question of affirmative action in
graduate studies programs by
forwarding all reports, documents and
data presented in its last two meetings
to the Committee on Graduate Studies
(C-GS).
Faculty members also unanimously
affirmed a motion to postpone the
matter of transfer student credit
evaluation for one month.
The subject of heated debate during
previous Senate meetings, affirmative
action again stirred up controversy.
Senate Chairman Halsey L. Royden
introduced the matter by stating that
according to the Senate rules, the
Senate could neither accept nor veto

committee recommendations
concerning the levels of women and
minorities enrolled in graduate
programs.
Overstepped Bounds
Royden indicated that he and the
members of the Steering Committee
felt that they overstepped their
bounds by introducing their
recommendations on affirmative
action to the entire Senate before the
Committee on Graduate Studies had
examined the issue. Royden chairs the
Steering Committee.
After much discussion, the Senate
voted to accept Royden's suggestion
and sent all affirmative action
resolutions and recommendations to
C-GS.
C-GS Chairman Julius Moravcsik,
chairman of the Philosophy
Department, said that C-GS members
could not deal with the affirmative
action issue at their next meeting. He

claimed they lacked sufficient time to
study the question fully.
The Senate's move brought mixed
reactions.
Asst. Sociology Prof. Francesca
Cancian, head of the Committee on
the Education and Employment of
Women in the University, was
disappointed by the result.
"The action was unfortunate," she
stated. "I'm not convinced that this
move was an accident."
Asst. German Prof. Ann Snow
disagreed. "What could on the surface
be seen as a stifling move would only
work to the advantage of the women's
movement on campus," she said.
Earlier, the Senate voted
unanimously to postpone a proposal
from the Committee on Academic
Appraisal and Achievement (C-AAA)
to reduce drastically the number of
transfer units applicable to a Stanford
undergraduate degree.
Credit Changes
The proposed changes would have
eliminated any credit for courses with
a "D" grade and have allowed a
maximum of 90 quarter units of
transfer credit, except for
undergraduates admitted to
professional schools or co-terminal
programs. The present maximum is
135 units.
The 90-unit limit is equivalent to
only two average academic years'
work. Assoc. Math Prof. Mary Sunseri,
Chairman of the Subcommittee on
Academic Standing, Petitions, and
Exceptions, assured Senate members
that the proposal is in no way designed
to discriminate against senior transfers.
A number of Senators, including
University President Richard W.
Lyman, voiced fears that the proposal
might discourage a significant
percentage of students from
transferring to Stanford.
After much discussion, the Senate
decided to study the issue at length at
a later date.
