# Seek Second Upset
## Swimmers Face USC 
### MIKE CHASSON 
Stanford's swimming team, coming off an upset
win over UCLA last Saturday,will attempt to do it
again tomorrow against USC at the Stanford Pools
at 2 p.m.
The Trojans, last year's NCAA runner-ups to
Indiana, are stronger than ever this year. Though
weaker in the sprints than in past years, USC has
depth in the other events that can only be matched
by the Hoosiers.
In the distance freestyle events the Trojans rely
on Olympian Tom Mcßreen, senior Jim McConica,
and incoming junior college star Jack Tingley.
Mcßreen placed third in the 400 meter freestyle
at Munich, while McConica finished second in the
200 and 500 freestyles and third in the 1650 free at
the NCAA's last year. Tingley, one of the country's
rising stars, set three National Junior College records
last year in the 200, 500, and 1650.
Butterfly Talent
The Trojans are loaded in the butterfly with
NCAA finalist Chip Furniss, soph Doug Windes, and
top freshman Alan Poucher. USC has excellent
backstrokers with NCAA 100 finalists Bruce Kocsis
and Steve Cameron, and frosh sensation Dave
Hannula.
Olympian Mark Chatfield gives the Trojans an
excellent breastroker, with freshman Gary Willis
providing good depth. Unfortunately for Chatfield
and Willis, they will be facing the virtually
unbeatable Stanford pair of Brian Job and John
Hencken.
USC is tough in the individual medley with
Hannula and Steve Furniss. Furniss was NCAA

runner-up in both the 200 and 400 IM last year,
while Hannula had one of the fastest high school
200 IM times in the country. Poucher and Kocsis
can also swim well in this event if called upon.
In the sprints USC doesn't have a superstar, but
is still strong in the 100 'with soph Ed McClesky,
senior Steve Tyrell and juniors Seth Loveseth and
Kim Tutt. However none of these swimmers excel in
the 50 free.
Stanford will need to score in the same events
they did last week against UCLA to have a chance
to pull off the upset. The key to the meet should
once again be the 400 medley relay. The Trojans are
the defending NCAA champions in this event, but
only Kocsis returns from last year's team.
Sprinters Important
Coach Jim Gaughran will be looking for the
sprinters to make the difference in the outcome.
Last week Dean Anderson won both the 50 and 100
and anchored the 400 free relay, while Martin
Pedley anchored the winning 400 medley relay.
Bruce Goodwin helped out with a second in the 50
and third in the 100.
The sprinters could be given credit for 28 of
Stanford's 60 points against the Bruins. If they do it
again Stanford will be in a good position to win the
meet.
Hopefully Stanford will be able to pick up wins
in the 200 IM, 200 back, and the diving to
supplement the breastroke, sprints and relay wins.
In any case this should be the most exciting dual
meet of the season as Stanford hopes to avenge last
year's lopsided 82-31 defeat in Los Angeles.

IS THAT STEVE CARLTON? - Lanky lefthander Bob Di Pietro will
be on the mound tomorrow afternoon when the Cards face USF in
the second game of a doubleheader at Sunken Diamond. Di Pietro has
a 12-4 record and 2.50 ERA in his two varsity seasons.
Stanford's swimming team, coming off an upset
win over UCLA last Saturday,will attempt to do it
again tomorrow against USC at the Stanford Pools
at 2 p.m.
The Trojans, last year's NCAA runner-ups to
Indiana, are stronger than ever this year. Though
weaker in the sprints than in past years, USC has
depth in the other events that can only be matched
by the Hoosiers.
In the distance freestyle events the Trojans rely
on Olympian Tom Mcßreen, senior Jim McConica,
and incoming junior college star Jack Tingley.
Mcßreen placed third in the 400 meter freestyle
at Munich, while McConica finished second in the
200 and 500 freestyles and third in the 1650 free at
the NCAA's last year. Tingley, one of the country's
rising stars, set three National Junior College records
last year in the 200, 500, and 1650.
Butterfly Talent
The Trojans are loaded in the butterfly with
NCAA finalist Chip Furniss, soph Doug Windes, and
top freshman Alan Poucher. USC has excellent
backstrokers with NCAA 100 finalists Bruce Kocsis
and Steve Cameron, and frosh sensation Dave
Hannula.
Olympian Mark Chatfield gives the Trojans an
excellent breastroker, with freshman Gary Willis
providing good depth. Unfortunately for Chatfield
and Willis, they will be facing the virtually
unbeatable Stanford pair of Brian Job and John
Hencken.
USC is tough in the individual medley with
Hannula and Steve Furniss. Furniss was NCAA

runner-up in both the 200 and 400 IM last year,
while Hannula had one of the fastest high school
200 IM times in the country. Poucher and Kocsis
can also swim well in this event if called upon.
In the sprints USC doesn't have a superstar, but
is still strong in the 100 'with soph Ed McClesky,
senior Steve Tyrell and juniors Seth Loveseth and
Kim Tutt. However none of these swimmers excel in
the 50 free.
Stanford will need to score in the same events
they did last week against UCLA to have a chance
to pull off the upset. The key to the meet should
once again be the 400 medley relay. The Trojans are
the defending NCAA champions in this event, but
only Kocsis returns from last year's team.
Sprinters Important
Coach Jim Gaughran will be looking for the
sprinters to make the difference in the outcome.
Last week Dean Anderson won both the 50 and 100
and anchored the 400 free relay, while Martin
Pedley anchored the winning 400 medley relay.
Bruce Goodwin helped out with a second in the 50
and third in the 100.
The sprinters could be given credit for 28 of
Stanford's 60 points against the Bruins. If they do it
again Stanford will be in a good position to win the
meet.
Hopefully Stanford will be able to pick up wins
in the 200 IM, 200 back, and the diving to
supplement the breastroke, sprints and relay wins.
In any case this should be the most exciting dual
meet of the season as Stanford hopes to avenge last
year's lopsided 82-31 defeat in Los Angeles.
