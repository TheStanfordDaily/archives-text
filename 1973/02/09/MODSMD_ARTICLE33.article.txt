# Wrestling, Rugby Teams On Road
## 
### 
Stanford's wrestling and
rugby teams will both be on the
road this weekend with the
wrestlers traveling to Humboldt
State for a triangular competition
against Humboldt and Fresno
State and the rugby team meeting
UC Davis at Davis.
Coach Joe DeMeo's wrestlers
currently have a 3-5 record after
Monday night's 25-15 loss to
Fresno State. John Govea pinned
his opponent in the 167 weight

division to highlight an otherwise
disappointing Stanford
performance.
Last Tuesday, however, the
Cards turned in one of their best
performances of the year in a
24-17 win over San Jose State.
DeMeo pointed to outstanding
efforts by Emmett Stanton (158),
Govea (167), and Allen Axworthy
as the highlights of the meet.
Other Cardinal winners were blind
wrestler Bob Sweetman (126),
Ken Krebs (142), and Chris
Horpel (150), who has only lost
once all season.

DeMeo calls Horpel "a great
wrestler . . . definitely our best
the last two seasons. Last year
Horpel had a 17-2 record for the
season but failed to place in the
Pac-8 meet after dropping down
to the 142 weight class.
Stanford will face San
Francisco State Tuesday night at
Encina Gym in the final home
meet of the 1973 season. The
match will begin at 7:30 p.m.
Coach Pete Kmetovic's rugby
team will face UC Davis tomorrow
afternoon at 1:30 as the Cards put
their 4-2 record on the line.

Stanford's frosh and 111 teams will
go against the Davis' II and 111
teams at 3 p.m.
Last week's 22-10 Cardinal
victory at UC Santa Barbara was a
welcome change for football stars
Pat Moore and Craig Zaltoski.
Moore and Zaltoski are defensive
players on the gridiron in the fall
but both got on the scoreboard in
Saturday's rugby game.
Moore scored on runs of 30
and 25 yards while Zaltoski also
reached scoring territory twice,
both runs coming from 20 yards
out. John McCormack also scored
a try for the Cards, and Bob
Hurtenstein added one penalty
kick to account for the total of 22
points.

24-17 win over San Jose State.
DeMeo pointed to outstanding
efforts by Emmett Stanton (158),
Govea (167), and Allen Axworthy
as the highlights of the meet.
Other Cardinal winners were blind
wrestler Bob Sweetman (126),
Ken Krebs (142), and Chris
Horpel (150), who has only lost
once all season.

DeMeo calls Horpel "a great
wrestler . . . definitely our best
the last two seasons. Last year
Horpel had a 17-2 record for the
season but failed to place in the
Pac-8 meet after dropping down
to the 142 weight class.
Stanford will face San
Francisco State Tuesday night at
Encina Gym in the final home
meet of the 1973 season. The
match will begin at 7:30 p.m.
Coach Pete Kmetovic's rugby
team will face UC Davis tomorrow
afternoon at 1:30 as the Cards put
their 4-2 record on the line.

Stanford's frosh and 111 teams will
go against the Davis' II and 111
teams at 3 p.m.
Last week's 22-10 Cardinal
victory at UC Santa Barbara was a
welcome change for football stars
Pat Moore and Craig Zaltoski.
Moore and Zaltoski are defensive
players on the gridiron in the fall
but both got on the scoreboard in
Saturday's rugby game.
Moore scored on runs of 30
and 25 yards while Zaltoski also
reached scoring territory twice,
both runs coming from 20 yards
out. John McCormack also scored
a try for the Cards, and Bob
Hurtenstein added one penalty
kick to account for the total of 22
points.
