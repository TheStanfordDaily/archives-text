## Everything You Want To Know About Basketball 
### Richard Holeton 
How big is the average shooter?
Standing erect, the average shooter is around 6-3 tall
and weighs about 190 pounds. Some as tall as 7-4 have
been recorded, and some as small as 5-0. Really.
Is large size considered an indication of performance?
No, though it used to be. A 7-footer may be cut from
the team while a SVfe-footer starts regularly because he's a
good player. But if another 7-footer is also good, though
they shoot equally well, he can obviously reach the
basket easier than the short player and may be more
appealing if the team wants to win a lot of games.
However, if the baskets are raised to 12 feet, then no
one may be able to reach them.
How often do people play basketball?
Most people play every day, unless they are too tired.
There is no harm in this if everyone on the team is
willing.
Where is basketball played?
The most oommon playing surface is a flat,
rectangular court, about 90 feet by 45 feet. Some people
play in driveways or back alleys, usually before they
become permanently attached to a team. They should
not feel guilty about this. A few younger players
attempt it in csrs, though this is generally not
recommended.
Should everyone be a member of a team?
Not necessarily. Many people report satisfactory
basketball from "pick-up" games. Of course if you must
pay people to get in a game with you, then they
probably are more interested in basketball itself than
they are in you.
What equipment is necessary for a good game?
Playing attire should be minimal to allow complete
freedom of movement. Skinlube or Vaseline may be
used to prevent blisters, although by the age of 18 a
truly accomplished player will have developed callouses
so that he need no longer fear blisters. A towel should
always be ready so the court doesn't have to be washed
too often.
How important arc warm-ups?
Warm-ups, though often underrated, are extremely
vital for a good game of basketball. It is important to get
your blood circulating before the game begins. This can
be done with a variety of drills, ranging from light
passing to actually "stuffing" or "dunking" the ball
before the game (this latter drill is exciting for the fans
as well as the players). The team should warm up
together, not at separate ends of the court.

Should players eat before the game?
It was once thought that eating wasn't appropriate
before the game. It is certainly okay, and even
recommended, with two cautions: don't eat so much
that you spoil the game, and too much cream or other
dairy products may curdle in the stomach. Eating after
the game is also acceptable, though players are often not
very hungry after vigorous play.
What about pre-game nervousness?
Some players get tense before the game even begins.
The team members should encourage each other to relax
until the jump-ball.
How often is a perfect game played?
Very rarely, unfortunate as this may be. It takes a
supreme team effort by all participants, both offensively
and defensively. Few teams achieve this more than a few
times per season. Sometimes some members of the team
will be satisfied and others not; the team members
should freely discuss what they did and didn't like about
each others' play.
How can you stop from running up the score?
Basketball teams employ many different methods to
protect themselves from too potent a shot. Some
concentrate on the basket, either tying the net or
putting a lid over the rim. Other teams try always to
throw the ball out-of-bounds, instead of aiming at the
basket—although this method can be somewhat erratic.
A few players, who decide they have scored all the
points they wish to, have their doctor simply cut the
nerves leading to their arms.
Are there different styles of basketball?
Yes! Since individual styles vary widely, a team
should attempt to coordinate its methods. Some teams
like to slow down the game; this is known as
"ball-control" or "stalling." Others prefer to waste no
time and score as soon as possible; this is called
"fast-break" or "run-and-gun." In any case, for a
successful season a team should vary its style from time
to time.
What is a selfish player?
Often, players seem to be in a game only for
themselves. You can tell because they seem to have an
internal adding machine which keeps a running total of
the points they've scored. They forget that a team
victory benefits all athe players.

What about playing basketball by yourself ?
It is naturally quite easy to put the ball in the basket
when no one is guarding you. However, it is much more
rewarding and meaningful to involve others in your
game. It used to be thought that playing alone could
cause insantiy, blindness, or even eventual inability to
play basketball at all. This is not true; no physical harm
can come this way. The only psychological harm
possible is if you feel badly afterwards—say if your shot
was off. In short, better basketball alone than no
basketball at all.
What effect do drugs have on basketball?
Liquor will reduce your inhibitions about getting
into a game, but may hurt your actual performance in
the contest. Marijuana also decreases your anxieties,
especially about playing before a large crowd. And
although this fact has been hidden from the public,
many basket-ballers high on pot report greater
stamina—in some cases the ability to play several games
in one night. For other drugs, our evidence is mostly
hearsay. Remember, most drugs are illegal. But so is
most basketball.
Is basketball a popular spectator sport?
Yes, its popularity as a spectator sport has been
growing rapidly in recent years. In fact, many spectators
get so involved in the action that they run onto the
court and try to score themselves.
What are some common mistakes made in basketball?
Typical offensive mistakes include "too much time in
the key," "palming the ball." "over-and-back," and
"illegal screen." A "double-dribble" is permitted only
after someone else touches the ball. "Turnovers" always
hurt the offensive team. A common mistake made with
too much defense is "goal-tending."
How does coaching affect your game?
If a team is playing poor basketball, coaching can
definitely help. Many teams have markedly improved
their win-loss record with high-quality coaching. It is not
necessary that you get a pep talk just before the game or
at halftime; coaches can be more helpful teaching basic
fundamentals and encouraging the team to work
together.
Arc game films helpful?
Yes, they can be very useful in pointing out mistakes
in technique. Sometimes they encourage the team to
engage in another game soon after, or even during, the
film. They also make for good entertainment and many
laughs.
