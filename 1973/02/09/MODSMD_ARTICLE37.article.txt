# Soggy Diamond Set For Three Games
## 
### SCOTT DAILEY 
Hoping to sneak in a few games
before Sunken Diamond is washed
away by a flood, the Cards will
take on the Philadelphia Phillies
rookie team again this afternoon
at 2 p.m. Tomorrow Stanford will
face the University of San
Francisco in a 12 noon
doubleheader, barring any further,
meterological intervention.
Wednesday's game with the
Phils was canceled due to wet
grounds. Mark Lucich's two run
double in the first inning gave the
Cardinals a 2-0 victory over the
Phils Monday.
Pitching Coach Tom Dunton
will send Max Goldstein, A 1
Arthur, and Jim Dudley to the
mound this afternoon. Dan Shaw
and Ken Grolle are scheduled to
hurl the first game Saturday, with
Bob DiPietro, Mike Higgins, and
Nick Peterson pitching the second
game.
Football Letterman
Goldstein, a lefthander who is
a two year letterman in football,
won one game in his freshman

year before going out for spring
football. Arthur compiled a 6-4
record and a 3.79 ERA for the
frosh-soph team last year.
Shaw and Grolle combined for
six shutout innings against the
Phils Monday. Shaw struck out
one and gave up one hit, and
Grolle fanned four, walking two
and giving up a hit.
DiPietro, a junior with a career
2.50 ERA in two varsity seasons,
hurled four shutouts for the Cards
last season, and was named a
semi-pro All-American for the
Anchorage Pilots over the
summer.
Batting Drill
Although the Cards set back
the Phils on Monday, both of
Stanford's runs were unearned,
and the club could come up with
only three hits. Head Coach Ray
Young sent the team through a
lengthy batting drill during
yesterday's practice, which was
accomplished without the
accompaniment of the rain.
"We're in pretty good shape,"
declared Coach Young yesterday.
"Our main problem has been that
we haven't been able to get the
hitting in, so the rain has kind of
taken its toll there."
Coach Young noted that other
schools in the Bay Area have not
yet been able to practice this year
because their fields have been
soaked by the nearly perpetual
rains.
Sunken Diamond is in good
condition, however. The puddles
near third base and along the first
baseline have been filled with dirt,
and the field has been covered by
the tarp when not in use.
The Cards will continue their
busy schedule next week with
games against St. Mary's, Cal State
Hayward, and Santa Clara.
Monday's game against the Gaels
will be played at St. Mary's with
the latter two contests at home on
Wednesday and Friday.
