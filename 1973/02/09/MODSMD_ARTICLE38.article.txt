40 Feared Dead In Alameda Crash
ALAMEDA — Searchers have found seven bodies in the
smoldering rubble of an apartment building destroyed
when a Navy fighter jet smashed into it.
Fire Chief Ernest Servente said yesterday that as many
as 40 persons may have died in the disaster. He based his
estimate on reports that 42 to 45 persons were in the
open-courtyard building at the time.
At least 17 persons were injured.
The A 7 Corsair attack plane clipped one apartment
building Wednesday night and then plunged through the
roof of the four-story, 27-unit Tahoe Apartments.
The Tahoe building, at 1814 Central Ave., collapsed in
flames and two adjacent structures were set afire.
Disaster crews, unable to go into the burning wreckage
for hours, continued to comb the debris.
Lt. Robert Lee Ward, 28, of Carry, N.C., the plane's
only occupant, was flying at 28,000 feet on a short
"round robin" training flight from Lemoore Naval Air
Station near Fresno, Calif., when his craft plunged to
earth on this residential island on San Francisco Bay.
Navy Cmdr. William D. Collins, public affairs officer
with the Pacific Fleet, said investigators were certain Ward
did not eject before the crash.
Eyewitnesses reported seeing only a very few occupants
escape the building before it exploded, sending flames and
smoke several hundred feet into the night sky.
Fiery debris and jet fuel spread the flames to two
adjacent apartment buildings, when least 17 persons
were reported injured with burns and lacerations.
Rogers Says Hanoi To Comply
WASHINGTON — Secretary of State William P. Rogers
said yesterday he does not believe Hanoi has given up its
desire to take over the South but "I think they've given
up the idea they can achieve their objectives by military
means."
"I think they will attempt to achieve the objectives but
by the political process and obviously that is going to
make the negotiations difficult," Rogers told the House
Foreign Affairs Committee.
"But I think they meant it when they signed this peace
agreement and I think they've given up achieving the
objectives by military means."
In his first report to Congress on progress in
establishing the Indochina peace, the secretary could give
the congressmen no figures on President Nixon's possible
request for U.S. reconstruction aid for Hanoi.
He suggested this will depend partly on Hanoi's
compliance with the peace agreement. He said one thing
presidential adviser Henry A. Kissinger wants to get at his
meeting with Hanoi officials this week will be "more
detail on what they have in mind" on U.S. assistance. Any
aid to Hanoi should be shared by western allies on a
multinational basis, Rogers said.
Rogers told the congressmen he still expects cease-fires
in both Laos and Cambodia despite increased fighting in
Laos and less definite progress toward a cease-fire in
Cambodia than in Laos.
Penn Central Strike Ends
PHILADELPHIA — An emergency resolution ending the
crippling Penn Central railroad strike flew through
Congress and out to President Nixon on the west coast
yesterday, sending strikers back to train yards early today.
Nixon, who had flown to the San Clemente, Calif.,
White House last night, announced that he would sign this
morning the resolution delaying the strike for 90 days.
Nixon's promise led leaders of the United
Transportation Union to begin calling strikers and
ordering them to report for last night's midnight shift.

The trains were halted by a 24-hour strike of
conductors and brakemen fighting a loss of jobs. A
railroad spokesman announced the trains "will be back in
business Friday."
Commuter and passenger trains that carry 300,000
riders daily in 16 states were expected to be operating
normally by the morning rush hour.
Some freights were to be moving before dawn, said
Penn Central President William H. Moore.
"The strike is over," said George W. Legge, manager of
the field service department of the UTU. "We already
notified our officers and chairmen throughout the system
to go back to work as soon as they can."
Under pressure that the strike threatened economic
catastrophe in agriculture and massive layoffs in the auto,
steel and coal industries, Congress completed approval of
the back-to-work order about 2 p.m. PST, taking less than
two hours to agree on the resolution.
Dollar Crisis Resolution Nears
LONDON — The two-week-old international money crisis
undermining the strength of the U.S. dollar yesterday
appeared to be headed for a climax, perhaps by the
weekend.
The value of the American currency was particularly
threatened in West Germany by money dealers seeking to
buy marks in anticipation the German currency will be
revalued, despite Bonn's resolve not to do so.
The dollar-dumping in West Germany and other money
markets reflected a widespread judgment that the dollar's
official value is pegged higher than its real worth, and that
sooner or later the official rate will have to give. '
Washington wants the readjustment to come by
revaluation of foreign currencies, particularly the West
German mark and the Japanese yen. But neither the
Japanese nor the Germans, so far, have been willing to
undercut their export chances.
If their currencies were revalued as the United States
wants, imports such as Volkswagens and transistor radios
would be more expensive in U.S. stores. And conversely,
U.S. exports would be cheaper in Germany and Japan,
giving U.S. traders an edge.
Reports from dealers in Amsterdam and Zurich said
Middle East government banks joined the dollar-selling
wave yesterday, putting more pressure on the U.S.
currency.
Jurors Hear Pentagon Papers
LOS ANGELES — A defense attorney, launching an effort
yesterday to show that U.S. officials hid their own
mistakes by hiding the Pentagon Papers, let jurors hear
passages about damaging U.S. decisions in Vietnam.
Sections of the Vietnam war history were read to
jurors by a key government witness, Brig. Gen. Paul F.
Gorman, as he was cross-examined by attorney Leonard
Weinglass at the trial of Daniel Ellsberg and Anthony
Russo.
Gorman read passages which indicated that the United
States discouraged free elections in South Vietnam in the
early 1950s although officials knew "violence" would
follow if no elections were held.
Jurors were read another passage relating U.S.
disillusionment as early as 1956 with the U.S.-supported
regime of South Vietnamese President Ngo Dinh Diem
and his "repressive" tactics.
