# GSB Lounge Finances Settled
## 
### LARRY FLEECE 
Lengthy negotiations to resolve
disputed financial claims made by last
year's Business School Lounge
operators Ed Jaramillo and Fred Baker
finally have produced a settlement.
The informal discussions, led by
Masters of Business Administration
Student Association (MBASA)
Treasurer Jim Jorgensen and President
Nat Jones, involved a detailed review
of Jaramillo's financial records of the
concession's 1971-72 operation.
Jaramillo's original financial
statement, submitted late last quarter,
showed a profit of only $13,000 for
the year, a sum which fell far short of
earlier predictions.
Accompanying Jaramillo's profit
statement was his claim that since he
and Baker already had paid the
MBASA almost $18,000 before
realizing that profits would not be as

high as projected, the MBASA should
reimburse the pair $4313.
Ledger Examined
Jorgensen was skeptical when he
received the profit statement and the
overpayment claim, and he began to
examine them immediately.
Jorgensen asked Jamarillo to
produce his financial ledger. After it
was finally given to him, Jorgensen
found that the ledger had been kept in
pencil and had been heavily erased.
Ted Hall, editor of the Business
School's newspaper, The Reporter,
said Jaramillo's records contained
several "substantial accounting
errors." During their review, MBASA
officers compiled their own figures
and found that Jaramillo underpaid
the association by some $4700, since
the $18,000 paid earlier was still
$5000 short of earlier profit

projections.
Thus, there was a $10,000
difference between the claims of the
operators and those of the MBASA.
Legal Action Threatened
In addition, Jaramillo and Ba?:er
still owed lounge suppliers nearly
$4500. Creditors were pressing for
payment, and two firms allegedly
threatened to take legal action against
Jaramillo and Baker.
The settlement, finalized on Jan.
19, contains three basic parts.
First, Jaramillo and Baker agreed to
drop their $4313 overpayment claim
against the association. Second, the
MBASA agreed to drop its $4700
underpayment claim against the pair.
Finally, the MBASA will pay the
operators $313, a sum which covers
the cost of a refrigerator purchased by
the two and reimburses them for a
claim against the concession left by
previous operators.
Payment Of Creditors
Though the agreement seems to
represent the perfect compromise, it
leaves Jaramillo and Baker with the
responsibility of paying their creditors
by their own devices, rather than with
the reimbursement they had hoped to
get from the MBASA.
According to the terms stipulated
in the agreement, Jaramillo has
arranged to pay back creditors in
installments through a promissory
note delivered to the MBASA, while
Baker has arranged to pay in cash.
Hall said that two possible
explanations were advanced to explain
the disputed financial claims during
the negotiations.
First, he said, it was possible that
Jaramillo and Baker had incorrectly
valued the worth of the inventory they
inherited from previous lounge
operators.
Second, the results of the review
indicated the likelihood that due to
faulty recording and inventory
procedures, a substantial portion of
the lounge sales went unreported. This
would account for the low profit

margin recorded by Jaramillo and
Baker, Hall said.
Cash Registers Installed
In an effort to safeguard against
similar problems, the Business School
this year installed cash registers in the
lounge concession. In addition, Hall
reported, financial statements are
being printed regularly in The
Reporter.
"Maybe now the graduate business

school can adequately operate its only
business," Hall laughed.
One legal problem remains
unsettled following the conclusion of
the lounge dispute. It is still unclear as
to whether the MBASA or the
operators are liable for losses suffered
in the lounge operation.
The MBASA controls the lounge's
physical facilities and awards the food
service rights to the highest bidder.

In an effort to safeguard against
similar problems, the Business School
this year installed cash registers in the
lounge concession. In addition, Hall
reported, financial statements are
being printed regularly in The
Reporter.
"Maybe now the graduate business

school can adequately operate its only
business," Hall laughed.
One legal problem remains
unsettled following the conclusion of
the lounge dispute. It is still unclear as
to whether the MBASA or the
operators are liable for losses suffered
in the lounge operation.
The MBASA controls the lounge's
physical facilities and awards the food
service rights to the highest bidder.
Lengthy negotiations to resolve
disputed financial claims made by last
year's Business School Lounge
operators Ed Jaramillo and Fred Baker
finally have produced a settlement.
The informal discussions, led by
Masters of Business Administration
Student Association (MBASA)
Treasurer Jim Jorgensen and President
Nat Jones, involved a detailed review
of Jaramillo's financial records of the
concession's 1971-72 operation.
Jaramillo's original financial
statement, submitted late last quarter,
showed a profit of only $13,000 for
the year, a sum which fell far short of
earlier predictions.
Accompanying Jaramillo's profit
statement was his claim that since he
and Baker already had paid the
MBASA almost $18,000 before
realizing that profits would not be as

high as projected, the MBASA should
reimburse the pair $4313.
Ledger Examined
Jorgensen was skeptical when he
received the profit statement and the
overpayment claim, and he began to
examine them immediately.
Jorgensen asked Jamarillo to
produce his financial ledger. After it
was finally given to him, Jorgensen
found that the ledger had been kept in
pencil and had been heavily erased.
Ted Hall, editor of the Business
School's newspaper, The Reporter,
said Jaramillo's records contained
several "substantial accounting
errors." During their review, MBASA
officers compiled their own figures
and found that Jaramillo underpaid
the association by some $4700, since
the $18,000 paid earlier was still
$5000 short of earlier profit

projections.
Thus, there was a $10,000
difference between the claims of the
operators and those of the MBASA.
Legal Action Threatened
In addition, Jaramillo and Ba?:er
still owed lounge suppliers nearly
$4500. Creditors were pressing for
payment, and two firms allegedly
threatened to take legal action against
Jaramillo and Baker.
The settlement, finalized on Jan.
19, contains three basic parts.
First, Jaramillo and Baker agreed to
drop their $4313 overpayment claim
against the association. Second, the
MBASA agreed to drop its $4700
underpayment claim against the pair.
Finally, the MBASA will pay the
operators $313, a sum which covers
the cost of a refrigerator purchased by
the two and reimburses them for a
claim against the concession left by
previous operators.
Payment Of Creditors
Though the agreement seems to
represent the perfect compromise, it
leaves Jaramillo and Baker with the
responsibility of paying their creditors
by their own devices, rather than with
the reimbursement they had hoped to
get from the MBASA.
According to the terms stipulated
in the agreement, Jaramillo has
arranged to pay back creditors in
installments through a promissory
note delivered to the MBASA, while
Baker has arranged to pay in cash.
Hall said that two possible
explanations were advanced to explain
the disputed financial claims during
the negotiations.
First, he said, it was possible that
Jaramillo and Baker had incorrectly
valued the worth of the inventory they
inherited from previous lounge
operators.
Second, the results of the review
indicated the likelihood that due to
faulty recording and inventory
procedures, a substantial portion of
the lounge sales went unreported. This
would account for the low profit

margin recorded by Jaramillo and
Baker, Hall said.
