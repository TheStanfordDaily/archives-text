# GSB Lounge Finances Settled
## 
### LARRY FLEECE 
Lengthy negotiations to resolve
disputed financial claims made by last
year's Business School Lounge
operators Ed Jaramillo and Fred Baker
finally have produced a settlement.
The informal discussions, led by
Masters of Business Administration
Student Association (MBASA)
Treasurer Jim Jorgensen and President
Nat Jones, involved a detailed review
of Jaramillo's financial records of the
concession's 1971-72 operation.
Jaramillo's original financial
statement, submitted late last quarter,
showed a profit of only $13,000 for
the year, a sum which fell far short of
earlier predictions.
Accompanying Jaramillo's profit
statement was his claim that since he
and Baker already had paid the
MBASA almost $18,000 before
realizing that profits would not be as

high as projected, the MBASA should
reimburse the pair $4313.
Ledger Examined
Jorgensen was skeptical when he
received the profit statement and the
overpayment claim, and he began to
examine them immediately.
Jorgensen asked Jamarillo to
produce his financial ledger. After it
was finally given to him, Jorgensen
found that the ledger had been kept in
pencil and had been heavily erased.
Ted Hall, editor of the Business
School's newspaper, The Reporter,
said Jaramillo's records contained
several "substantial accounting
errors." During their review, MBASA
officers compiled their own figures
and found that Jaramillo underpaid
the association by some $4700, since
the $18,000 paid earlier was still
$5000 short of earlier profit

projections.
Thus, there was a $10,000
difference between the claims of the
operators and those of the MBASA.
Legal Action Threatened
In addition, Jaramillo and Ba?:er
still owed lounge suppliers nearly
$4500. Creditors were pressing for
payment, and two firms allegedly
threatened to take legal action against
Jaramillo and Baker.
The settlement, finalized on Jan.
19, contains three basic parts.
First, Jaramillo and Baker agreed to
drop their $4313 overpayment claim
against the association. Second, the
MBASA agreed to drop its $4700
underpayment claim against the pair.
Finally, the MBASA will pay the
operators $313, a sum which covers
the cost of a refrigerator purchased by
