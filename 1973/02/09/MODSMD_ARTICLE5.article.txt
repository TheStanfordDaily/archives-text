# Few Students Respond To Hindu Worship
## Converts Preach Krishna Consciousness Here 
### SRI KRISHN CHOPRA 
"A dog can't control its sex urge. If you too can't, what's the difference
between you and the dog?" His Holiness Satasvarupa Goswami asked the five
students who turned up in a Tresidder meeting room to hear the first of several
lectures given on campus last week by the Hare Krishna movement.
"Helluva lot," a Stanford student might respond. But the spiritual aura of the
room, with the portrait of Lord Krishna, the burning incense and the saffron
robed Swami sitting cross-legged on a dias, discouraged frivolity.
The Swami, a young American who was graduated from New York University
with a degree in English, gave up comforts, his family, his name, sex and drugs,
to adopt a concept of living totally alien to Western values. He shaved his head,
took a Sanskrit name, donned saffron robes, and became a Sanyasi in the service
of Lord Krishna in 1966. There are nearly 3000 more Americans like him.
As part of the "kirtan," Satsvarupa and two "godbrothers" Sahdev and
Jivannanda Dasa, chanted "Hare Krishna, Hare Rama, Hare Krishna, Hare Hare"
with a consuming passion and in a sweet, mellifluous voice. The glow of intense
devotion lit up their faces.
Freed From Sex
"This is all you have to do to free yourself from getting yourself
over-powered by sex and other material urges. Chanting 'Hare Krishna' will
purify you and bring you back to God, the Supreme Krishna," Satasvarupa told
his audience later. He added, "You don't have to shave your head like me. You
can belong to any race, religion — that doesn't matter."
Perhaps it is this simplicity of approach that has drawn Westerners into the
Hare Krishna fold. The convert is not required to spend hours meditating on the
formless, or ponder over the profundity of the Vedas as required in
transcendental meditation taught by many Hindu philosophers and preachers.
In this method, the converts just accept Krishna as the supreme Saviour and
leave the rest to Him. Krishna is the name of God. He came to this world 5000
years ago as Lord Krishna. Hindu scriptures describe his life and deeds in detail.
The Bhagvada Gita is the compilation of the teachings of Lord Krishna which he
gave to one of his disciples, Arjuna.
Forms Of Yoga
All Hindus in India worship Krishna, though different groups may have
different family deities. There are a number of popular folk songs and verses on
the life of Krishna as a child, the blue-complexioned, fun loving cow herder. The

"kirtans" and chanting of "Hare Krishna" are part of the Hindu way of life.
The Hare Krishna movement here preaches the Bhakti Yoga, rather than the
Hatha Yoga, which is the form of yoga most Americans are familiar with.
But Hatha Yoga requires considerable discipline and is very difficult to
perform. In the Bhagvada Gita, Arjuna complains to Lord Krishna that he will
not be able to perform the Hatha Yoga in its truly correct form. Lord Krishna
then told him that the Yogi is one who always thinks of Him with love and faith.
Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, a saint who lived in Bengal, India in the 15th century
who popularised the "Hare Krishna" chant as being the cure-all for our material
age. The word "Hara" is the form of addressing the energy of the Lord and
"Hare" is the vocative of "Hara."
Spiritual Master
The spiritual master and the founder of the Hare Krishna movement in India,
His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupda is claimed to be a direct
descendent in the line of disciples of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, who in turn is
believed to be an incarnation of Lord Krishna.
Hare Krishna movement followers here claim that they are the only ones who
present the genuine teachings of the Gita and Lord Krishna because, in the line
of 'disciplic succession' which they have traced through Chaitanya Mahaprabhu,
their Guru Srila Prabhupada, comes down directly from Lord Krishna.
Recently, Macmillan has published his book called Bhagvada Gita, As It Is
which according to the author contains the original sayings of the Supreme God.
Unlike other Swamis who try to interpret and give their own meaning to Gita, he
says,"I am like a mailman who delivers the mail without opening the letter and
making additions."
Krishna In America
This 77-year-old Swami came to New York in 1966 and founded the
International Society of Krishna Consciousness which has grown into 90 centers
and now has more than 5000 followers.
Why did he come to America? I asked one of his followers.
"He came here on the instruction of his spiritual master who asked him to go
and spread Lord Chaitanya's message to the people of the West," one of his
followers explained. "He chose America because he found that people all over
the world were following America to Hell — so if America took to the Hare
Krishna movement, they would follow the Americans to Heaven."

HARE KRISHNA — This unusual looking man is one of a group of American
converts to Krishna consciousness who came to Stanford last week to explain
their movement. However, few students attended their lectures.
"Lord Chaitanya's prediction was that the holy name of Krishna would be
carried to every town and village. We are helping our spiritual master to fulfill
this prediction," added another follower.
So a group of about six came in their camper van to tell the students of
Stanford — "just tell them and teach them; we are not interested in conversions"
— about Krishna consciousness.
But the students of Stanford, apart from viewing them as objects of curious
interest, didn't really care. "The response has been very poor here," Satsvarupa
lamented. "Normally we used to draw more than 50 to 60 in the other schools.
Here we hardly have more than five or six in every lecture."
One reason for the poor response could be the end of the Vietnam war.
According to one of students, a senior in math who attended some discourses,
"All this interest in Hindu philosophy was, to a large extent, a refuge from the
confusion and disgust the Vietnam war generated in the kids. Now that the war
has ended, it's back to the dog's life of sex and drugs."
"A dog can't control its sex urge. If you too can't, what's the difference

the life of Krishna as a child, the blue-complexioned, fun loving cow herder. The

"kirtans" and chanting of "Hare Krishna" are part of the Hindu way of life.
The Hare Krishna movement here preaches the Bhakti Yoga, rather than the
Hatha Yoga, which is the form of yoga most Americans are familiar with.
But Hatha Yoga requires considerable discipline and is very difficult to
perform. In the Bhagvada Gita, Arjuna complains to Lord Krishna that he will
not be able to perform the Hatha Yoga in its truly correct form. Lord Krishna
then told him that the Yogi is one who always thinks of Him with love and faith.
Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, a saint who lived in Bengal, India in the 15th century
who popularised the "Hare Krishna" chant as being the cure-all for our material
age. The word "Hara" is the form of addressing the energy of the Lord and
"Hare" is the vocative of "Hara."
Spiritual Master
The spiritual master and the founder of the Hare Krishna movement in India,
His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupda is claimed to be a direct
descendent in the line of disciples of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, who in turn is
believed to be an incarnation of Lord Krishna.
Hare Krishna movement followers here claim that they are the only ones who
present the genuine teachings of the Gita and Lord Krishna because, in the line
of 'disciplic succession' which they have traced through Chaitanya Mahaprabhu,
their Guru Srila Prabhupada, comes down directly from Lord Krishna.
Recently, Macmillan has published his book called Bhagvada Gita, As It Is
which according to the author contains the original sayings of the Supreme God.
Unlike other Swamis who try to interpret and give their own meaning to Gita, he
says,"I am like a mailman who delivers the mail without opening the letter and
making additions."
Krishna In America
This 77-year-old Swami came to New York in 1966 and founded the
International Society of Krishna Consciousness which has grown into 90 centers
and now has more than 5000 followers.
Why did he come to America? I asked one of his followers.
"He came here on the instruction of his spiritual master who asked him to go
and spread Lord Chaitanya's message to the people of the West," one of his
followers explained. "He chose America because he found that people all over
the world were following America to Hell — so if America took to the Hare
Krishna movement, they would follow the Americans to Heaven."

HARE KRISHNA — This unusual looking man is one of a group of American
converts to Krishna consciousness who came to Stanford last week to explain
their movement. However, few students attended their lectures.
"Lord Chaitanya's prediction was that the holy name of Krishna would be
carried to every town and village. We are helping our spiritual master to fulfill
this prediction," added another follower.
So a group of about six came in their camper van to tell the students of
Stanford — "just tell them and teach them; we are not interested in conversions"
— about Krishna consciousness.
But the students of Stanford, apart from viewing them as objects of curious
interest, didn't really care. "The response has been very poor here," Satsvarupa
lamented. "Normally we used to draw more than 50 to 60 in the other schools.
Here we hardly have more than five or six in every lecture."
One reason for the poor response could be the end of the Vietnam war.
According to one of students, a senior in math who attended some discourses,
"All this interest in Hindu philosophy was, to a large extent, a refuge from the
confusion and disgust the Vietnam war generated in the kids. Now that the war
has ended, it's back to the dog's life of sex and drugs."
"A dog can't control its sex urge. If you too can't, what's the difference
between you and the dog?" His Holiness Satasvarupa Goswami asked the five
students who turned up in a Tresidder meeting room to hear the first of several
lectures given on campus last week by the Hare Krishna movement.
"Helluva lot," a Stanford student might respond. But the spiritual aura of the
room, with the portrait of Lord Krishna, the burning incense and the saffron
robed Swami sitting cross-legged on a dias, discouraged frivolity.
The Swami, a young American who was graduated from New York University
with a degree in English, gave up comforts, his family, his name, sex and drugs,
to adopt a concept of living totally alien to Western values. He shaved his head,
took a Sanskrit name, donned saffron robes, and became a Sanyasi in the service
of Lord Krishna in 1966. There are nearly 3000 more Americans like him.
As part of the "kirtan," Satsvarupa and two "godbrothers" Sahdev and
Jivannanda Dasa, chanted "Hare Krishna, Hare Rama, Hare Krishna, Hare Hare"
with a consuming passion and in a sweet, mellifluous voice. The glow of intense
devotion lit up their faces.
Freed From Sex
"This is all you have to do to free yourself from getting yourself
over-powered by sex and other material urges. Chanting 'Hare Krishna' will
purify you and bring you back to God, the Supreme Krishna," Satasvarupa told
his audience later. He added, "You don't have to shave your head like me. You
can belong to any race, religion — that doesn't matter."
Perhaps it is this simplicity of approach that has drawn Westerners into the
Hare Krishna fold. The convert is not required to spend hours meditating on the
formless, or ponder over the profundity of the Vedas as required in
transcendental meditation taught by many Hindu philosophers and preachers.
In this method, the converts just accept Krishna as the supreme Saviour and
leave the rest to Him. Krishna is the name of God. He came to this world 5000
years ago as Lord Krishna. Hindu scriptures describe his life and deeds in detail.
The Bhagvada Gita is the compilation of the teachings of Lord Krishna which he
gave to one of his disciples, Arjuna.

HARE KRISHNA — This unusual looking man is one of a group of American
converts to Krishna consciousness who came to Stanford last week to explain
their movement. However, few students attended their lectures.
"Lord Chaitanya's prediction was that the holy name of Krishna would be
carried to every town and village. We are helping our spiritual master to fulfill
this prediction," added another follower.
So a group of about six came in their camper van to tell the students of
Stanford — "just tell them and teach them; we are not interested in conversions"
— about Krishna consciousness.
But the students of Stanford, apart from viewing them as objects of curious
interest, didn't really care. "The response has been very poor here," Satsvarupa
lamented. "Normally we used to draw more than 50 to 60 in the other schools.
Here we hardly have more than five or six in every lecture."
One reason for the poor response could be the end of the Vietnam war.
According to one of students, a senior in math who attended some discourses,
"All this interest in Hindu philosophy was, to a large extent, a refuge from the
confusion and disgust the Vietnam war generated in the kids. Now that the war
has ended, it's back to the dog's life of sex and drugs."
"A dog can't control its sex urge. If you too can't, what's the difference
between you and the dog?" His Holiness Satasvarupa Goswami asked the five
students who turned up in a Tresidder meeting room to hear the first of several
lectures given on campus last week by the Hare Krishna movement.
"Helluva lot," a Stanford student might respond. But the spiritual aura of the
room, with the portrait of Lord Krishna, the burning incense and the saffron
robed Swami sitting cross-legged on a dias, discouraged frivolity.
The Swami, a young American who was graduated from New York University
with a degree in English, gave up comforts, his family, his name, sex and drugs,
to adopt a concept of living totally alien to Western values. He shaved his head,
took a Sanskrit name, donned saffron robes, and became a Sanyasi in the service
of Lord Krishna in 1966. There are nearly 3000 more Americans like him.
As part of the "kirtan," Satsvarupa and two "godbrothers" Sahdev and
Jivannanda Dasa, chanted "Hare Krishna, Hare Rama, Hare Krishna, Hare Hare"
with a consuming passion and in a sweet, mellifluous voice. The glow of intense
devotion lit up their faces.
Freed From Sex
"This is all you have to do to free yourself from getting yourself
over-powered by sex and other material urges. Chanting 'Hare Krishna' will
purify you and bring you back to God, the Supreme Krishna," Satasvarupa told
his audience later. He added, "You don't have to shave your head like me. You
can belong to any race, religion — that doesn't matter."
Perhaps it is this simplicity of approach that has drawn Westerners into the
Hare Krishna fold. The convert is not required to spend hours meditating on the
formless, or ponder over the profundity of the Vedas as required in
transcendental meditation taught by many Hindu philosophers and preachers.
In this method, the converts just accept Krishna as the supreme Saviour and
leave the rest to Him. Krishna is the name of God. He came to this world 5000
years ago as Lord Krishna. Hindu scriptures describe his life and deeds in detail.
The Bhagvada Gita is the compilation of the teachings of Lord Krishna which he
gave to one of his disciples, Arjuna.
Forms Of Yoga
All Hindus in India worship Krishna, though different groups may have
different family deities. There are a number of popular folk songs and verses on
the life of Krishna as a child, the blue-complexioned, fun loving cow herder. The

"kirtans" and chanting of "Hare Krishna" are part of the Hindu way of life.
The Hare Krishna movement here preaches the Bhakti Yoga, rather than the
Hatha Yoga, which is the form of yoga most Americans are familiar with.
But Hatha Yoga requires considerable discipline and is very difficult to
perform. In the Bhagvada Gita, Arjuna complains to Lord Krishna that he will
not be able to perform the Hatha Yoga in its truly correct form. Lord Krishna
then told him that the Yogi is one who always thinks of Him with love and faith.
Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, a saint who lived in Bengal, India in the 15th century
who popularised the "Hare Krishna" chant as being the cure-all for our material
age. The word "Hara" is the form of addressing the energy of the Lord and
"Hare" is the vocative of "Hara."
Spiritual Master
The spiritual master and the founder of the Hare Krishna movement in India,
His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupda is claimed to be a direct
descendent in the line of disciples of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, who in turn is
believed to be an incarnation of Lord Krishna.
Hare Krishna movement followers here claim that they are the only ones who
present the genuine teachings of the Gita and Lord Krishna because, in the line
of 'disciplic succession' which they have traced through Chaitanya Mahaprabhu,
their Guru Srila Prabhupada, comes down directly from Lord Krishna.
Recently, Macmillan has published his book called Bhagvada Gita, As It Is
which according to the author contains the original sayings of the Supreme God.
Unlike other Swamis who try to interpret and give their own meaning to Gita, he
says,"I am like a mailman who delivers the mail without opening the letter and
making additions."
Krishna In America
This 77-year-old Swami came to New York in 1966 and founded the
International Society of Krishna Consciousness which has grown into 90 centers
and now has more than 5000 followers.
Why did he come to America? I asked one of his followers.
"He came here on the instruction of his spiritual master who asked him to go
and spread Lord Chaitanya's message to the people of the West," one of his
followers explained. "He chose America because he found that people all over
the world were following America to Hell — so if America took to the Hare
Krishna movement, they would follow the Americans to Heaven."
