# To Sacramento
## A 						Prison Protest Caravan 
### 
Prison Information Center

At noon on Feb. 10, hundreds
of cars will be departing from the
San Francisco Civic Center on a
"prison protest" caravan to
Sacramento. There are several
reasons; but the multitude of
purposes does not mean that the
caravan's aims are broad or
ambiguous. It is an indication of
the great number of problems
inherent in our prison system.
Some will be going to protest
California's use of the
indeterminate sentence which
incarcerates a prisoner until
he/she is "rehabilitated." Imagine
yourself as an inmate, not
knowing the month, year or
decade of your release.
In California, sentencing and
paroling of male convicts is
entrusted to a nine-member Adult
Authority. The members,
appointed by the governo: for
four-year terms, currently include

eight ex-law enforcement officers
and one dentist.
Parole
An inmate's five to fifteen
minute parole hearing is attended
by two Adult Authority members
and a prison staff member.
According to Jessica Mitford,
author of "Kind and Usual
Punishment in California"
(Atlantic, March 1971) "There
are no written guidelines for the
conduct of the hearing, and if
parole is denied, the prisoner is
not entitled to know the reason.
No transcript is made of the
hearing. The prisoner's family, his
counsel, and the press are
excluded."
Parole denials by the Adult
Authority based on their personal
opinions and prejudices often
seem quite arbitrary. Explains
Mitford, "Adult Authority policj
is to rotate the panels, so that th

man whose parole is denied year
after year will confront a different
duo each time. Nostrums for his
rehabilitation vary, depending on
the idiosyncracies of the
individual panel members."
According to one former
convict, "Panel Member A may be
hipped on religion, and tell the
prisoner to go to church every
week. But fifty-two Sundays later,
he comes before Panel Member Y,
whose bag is Alcoholics
Anonymous, and even if the
prisoner doesn't happen to have a
drinking problem, he'll be told,
'Attend the AA for a year and
then we'll see about a parole
date.' This can go on indefinitely
as long as they haven't set his
sentence. If he shows his true
feelings and says, 'You're
arbitrary and unjust,' they will say
i e's not ready for parole. If he
says he has benefited enormously
from the rehabilitation programs,
they may put him down as a
smoothie and deny parole
anyway."
Rehabilitation
The practice of incarceration
of an inmate until rehabilitation is
evident may work in theory, but
how can a draft resister or the
possessor of one joint of
marijuana be rehabilitated? Even
if rehabilitation could be defined
as the transformation of an
inmate into a productive member
of society, how can this be
accomplished when prison
administrators themselves admit

that the primary purpose of a
prison is detainment and
punishment?
Other caravan members will be
protesting racism, repression, and
the persecution of political
prisoners. They abhor the
shootings of George Jacksons, the
intimidation of the "jailhouse
lawyers," and the indiscriminate
and inhumane use of the
Adjustment Centers and
maximum security "holes."
Many will be going on the
caravan to protest the
construction of a new maximum
security prison, to chide Governor
Reagan for his failure to push
reform, to urge the legislature to

initiate favorable bills, or to give
the inmates at San Quentin and
Vacaville some signs of hope.
There is one common strain
uniting each group and giving the
caravan a collective
purposeâ€”desire to change our
antiquated system of retributive
justice and the facade of
rehabilitation.
If you think prisons should be
improved, or abolished, and if you
care enough to take action, phone
the Prison Information Center at
321-2300, x 2677. We need you,
your car, and your concern.
