# Women And Minorities
## Access To Grad School 
### 
Baeza And Rhue

On January 8, 1971, President Lyman said: "I
believe that there is .lothing more obviously an
appropriate part of Stanford's particular role with
respect to the disadvantaged than the promotion of
more graduate training ... no national program or
family of programs can make much sense if it does
not include a sizeable commitment by universities
such as Stanford to open the doors to the
professions by educating the disadvantaged beyond
the baccalaureate degree."
A reaffirmation of this commitment was the
motivation for The Stanford Daily article by
Professors Davidson, Reaven, Rosenberg, and Snow
which expressed concern about the need on the part
of the University to increase its numbers of
minority and women students in the professional
and graduate schools. While we enthusiastically
support their effort, we have two reservations about
the resolutions proposal currently before the Senate
of the Academic Council:
(1) The issues of female and minority student
access to graduate school cannot be considered
together. The social conditions out of which the
concerns arise place significantly different obstacles
for the two groups, and the goals and purposes of
the two groups for the most part are distinctly
different.
Opportunity
With respect to educational opportunity women,
on the whole, have had access to a wide variety of
undergraduate institutions, even if sexual
stereotyping has controlled much of that education.
Students of color are only now beginning to enter
and experience the variety of educational options at
the college level heretofore inaccessible to them.
When a woman has access to graduate training and

receives a professional degree, she has rightly been
afforded an opportunity to develop her talents and
use her skills.
While she obviously must not be denied this
opportunity, the effect is to bolster the already
well-developed professional pool within the white
community, while the effect of expanded graduate
opportunities for minority students is to only begin
the development of a professional pool and the
economic and social development of whole
communities of color.
(2) The proposal as it presently exists does fall,
to use the professors' words, "midway between lip
service and tokenism." That condition exists
because we are not yet clear on what to
recommend; no studies have been carried out, and
no serious university-wide review has been
attempted. For the most part the current
recommendations are no more, and in some cases
less, than policies being carried out presently by
some schools and departments.
Proposal
We are at this time developing a proposal to
study graduate education as it relates to minority
students and would recommend that the Senate
withhold any recommendations about the
University's commitment to minority graduate and
professional education until the results of the study
have been reviewed and debated. A reaffirmation of
commitment by the Senate at that time will be
better informed, more appropriate, and will have
had the full participation of all concerned
constituencies throughout the University.

(1) The issues of female and minority student
access to graduate school cannot be considered
together. The social conditions out of which the
concerns arise place significantly different obstacles
for the two groups, and the goals and purposes of
the two groups for the most part are distinctly
different.
Opportunity
With respect to educational opportunity women,
on the whole, have had access to a wide variety of
undergraduate institutions, even if sexual
stereotyping has controlled much of that education.
Students of color are only now beginning to enter
and experience the variety of educational options at
the college level heretofore inaccessible to them.
When a woman has access to graduate training and

receives a professional degree, she has rightly been
afforded an opportunity to develop her talents and
use her skills.
While she obviously must not be denied this
opportunity, the effect is to bolster the already
well-developed professional pool within the white
community, while the effect of expanded graduate
opportunities for minority students is to only begin
the development of a professional pool and the
economic and social development of whole
communities of color.
(2) The proposal as it presently exists does fall,
to use the professors' words, "midway between lip
service and tokenism." That condition exists
because we are not yet clear on what to
recommend; no studies have been carried out, and
no serious university-wide review has been
attempted. For the most part the current
recommendations are no more, and in some cases
less, than policies being carried out presently by
some schools and departments.
Proposal
We are at this time developing a proposal to
study graduate education as it relates to minority
students and would recommend that the Senate
withhold any recommendations about the
University's commitment to minority graduate and
professional education until the results of the study
have been reviewed and debated. A reaffirmation of
commitment by the Senate at that time will be
better informed, more appropriate, and will have
had the full participation of all concerned
constituencies throughout the University.

Baeza And Rhue

On January 8, 1971, President Lyman said: "I
believe that there is .lothing more obviously an
appropriate part of Stanford's particular role with
respect to the disadvantaged than the promotion of
more graduate training ... no national program or
family of programs can make much sense if it does
not include a sizeable commitment by universities
such as Stanford to open the doors to the
professions by educating the disadvantaged beyond
the baccalaureate degree."
A reaffirmation of this commitment was the
motivation for The Stanford Daily article by
Professors Davidson, Reaven, Rosenberg, and Snow
which expressed concern about the need on the part
of the University to increase its numbers of
minority and women students in the professional
and graduate schools. While we enthusiastically
support their effort, we have two reservations about
the resolutions proposal currently before the Senate
of the Academic Council:
(1) The issues of female and minority student
access to graduate school cannot be considered
