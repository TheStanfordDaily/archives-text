CLARK AIR FORCE BASE,
Philippines — The first planeload of
American prisoners of war landed here
at 12:12 a.m. today PST after a
two-and-one-half-hour flight from
Hanoi.
Two more planes followed. The
three planes carried a total of 116
American POWs.
The first plane brought 37
ambulatory and three non-ambulatory
prisoners.
The planes left Hanoi at about
30-minute intervals between 9:36 and
10:46 p.m. PST last night. The process
of loading the prisoners on the three
giant Cl4l transport planes took
about two hours, and was
accomplished without any unexpected
problems.
Among the men on the first

hospital plane was Navy Lt. Cmdr.
Everett Alvarez Jr. of Santa Clara, the
first American pilot captured during
the Vietnam War. He spent more than
eight years in captivity.
The first ex-prisoner to disembark,
shortly before 12:30 a.m., was Navy
Capt. Jeremiah Denton of Virginia
Beach, Va., a prisoner for seven years.
He was the only one to speak.
"We are honored to have had the
opportunity to serve our country
under difficult circumstances. We are
profoundly grateful to our
Commander-in-Chief and to our nation
for this day. God Bless America,"he
said.
Alvarez was the second man off the
plane.
The stretcher cases were unloaded
from the plane out of public view.
The ambulatory men left the plane

one at a time, each saluting a color
guard and high-ranking officers
gathered to greet them.
A crowd of about 800 military men
and dependents gathered at the
airfield, applauding the men as they
walked from the plane across a red
carpet to a bus which carried them to
the base hospital.
It was late afternoon here in the
Philippines.
The Viet Cong delayed the release
of 27 other American prisoners of war
from South Vietnam today, and the
senior U.S. representative of the
four-party Joint Military Commission
walked out of a meeting of the chiefs
of delegations in protest. The U.S.
Embassy accused the Communists of
violating the Vietnam ceasefire
agreement.
The dispute was over the release of
North Vietnamese and Viet Cong
prisoners held by the Saigon
government. At one point, Saigon
announced that the dispute had been
resolved and the release of the
Americans was imminent. But the Viet
Cong insisted on bringing the matter
before the four-power commission.
An advance team that landed in
Hanoi this morning to handle the
evacuation had reported earlier that
the first prisoners out would be sick or
wounded.
The first of three Cl4l Starlifter
hospital plans landed at Hanoi's Gia
Lam Airport shortly before 9 p.m.
PST, and the loading of the released
Americans began almost at once.
The spokesman said two groups of
prisoners were aboard the plane by 9
p.m. PST.
The North Vietnamese asked an
advance party of Americans who
arrived at Gia Lam earlier in the day to
bring in the other two hospital planes
at half-hour intervals instead of hourly
as originally planned.
A CI3O Hercules transport arrived
in the North Vietnamese capital at
6:52 p.m. yesterday PST — with an
18-man advance party of doctors and

aviation technicians. It touched down
minutes before the first of the three
giant hospital planes took off from
Clark for Hanoi to begin evacuating
the prisoners.
TTie problem with release of 27
other American POWs by the Viet
Cong apparently was caused by a
dispute over exchange arrangements
for Communist prisoners. A U.S.
hospital plane stood by in Saigon

waiting to fly the Americans here.
A North Vietnamese military
spokesman said the Viet Cong had
been ready to release the POWs at Loc
Ninh, 75 miles north of Saigon. But he
said the South Vietnamese government
announced that Saigon's prisoners at
Bien Hoa, northeast of the capital, had
refused to leave until seeing a Viet
Cong representative.
But seven hours after the release of

the Americans was to have begun,
there was no official word from the
U.S. Command that any of the men
had been freed.
A U.S. spokesman said Maj. Gen.
Gilbert H. Woodward, the senior
American representative on the Joint
Military Commission, "has refused to
rejoin the chiefs of delegations at the
meeting which was scheduled to
reconvene this afternoon."
