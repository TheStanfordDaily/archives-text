# Salary Management The Problem
## Layoffs Unnecessary 
### 
United Stanford Employees

Representatives at SLAC of United Stanford
Employees are protesting Director Panofsky's
announced 80-man layoff as unnecessary and
unresponsive to SLAC's real problems.
Panofsky represents the need for layoffs as a
logical consequence of a three percent decrease in
this year's budget as compared to last year's, which,
combined with inflation, strangles the ability of the
laboratory to function. This emphasis lays the
problem in Washington, and places the SLAC
Directorate in the position of sadly apologizing for
the effects of President Nixon's national budget
economies.
Instead, USE identifies the cost problem as one
of internal salary management. In Panofsky's own
recent announcement he complains that in fiscal
year 1969, manpower cost was 46 percent of
SLAC's budget, whereas this year 64 percent of the
budget went to salaries. A management breakdown
of employee classifications being laid off shows that
the layoffs will indeed result in a restructuring of
laboratory salary distribution. While executive and
faculty numbers will be unchanged,and lower paid
workers will be reduced by five to seven and a half
percent, professionals will be cut by nearly ten
perpent, and so-called "super-techs" (staff
associates) will decrease a whopping 20 percent.
Alternatives
Panofsky has rejected several feasible alternatives
to layoffs. Normal attrition at SLAC runs about ten
percent per year or about 130 people. Panofsky's
total personnel target for reduction is 140 people,
so normal attrition (combined with a total hiring
freeze) will eliminate the need for layoffs —
particularly if the outside employment picture is
looking up as Panofsky argues.
Another approach to the cost problem is
illustrated by realizing that five percent of SLAC's

annual salary budget ($l5 million) is $750,000 —
just the value of the. Atomic Energy Commission's
budget reduction this year. Hence a freeze on raises,
laboratory-wide, would compensate for the funding
decrease.
SLAC leaders have long boasted about their
program of "attrition management." But USE
shows that while gross attrition has been about ten
percent per year, laboratory rehiring has typically
been six to seven percent, so that net attrition has
been held to three to four percent. This rehiring
from outside has meant reduced opportunities
inside. SLAC leaders have been proud of their
"Upward Mobility Program." It is now clear that
this program really should be called, "Up and then
Out."
Activities
A major thrust of USE activities, if layoffs
cannot be stopped, will be to study and identify
individual cases of personal hardship resulting from
the unnecessary layoffs, as well as instances of
individual biases related to race, sex, cultural
orientation, or union activities. Union organizing is
protected under the law, and U.S.E. people may be
defended by court action if appropriate, whenever
biased application of layoffs is identified. SLAC's
"Minority and Women's Committee," a body
created by the administration, has not been notified
of any special guidelines to protect those categories.
Older employees seem particularly vulnerable.
Once Again, USE is disappointed that the
Director has announced a "solution" to a problem
"from Washington" whereas we see the problem as
being right here, and we would like to help. We are
weary of repeated, glowing projections of the future
at the end of grim announcements of annual
disasters.
