Tunnels Not 'Shortsighted'
Editor:
In his campus news conference
with KZSU Feb. 6, President
Lyman did not call the decision to
build the tunnels at the Stadium
shortsighted.
What he said, in part, was:
"Any decision like that can be
criticized.
"Nobody can ever be sure it
was a God-given, right decision.
"But to tell the Athletic
Department they shouldn't be
able to renovate in any significant
way a tremendous piece of capital
equipment like Stanford Stadium,
which is itself a revenue producing
thing, (to say) they can't do that
until every other need in the
University is met seems to be very
shortsighted."

Hargadon On Bowdoin
Editor:
Two comments of clarification
about your article on Bowdoin
and SAT's (Daily, Feb. 8). First, it
was not Bowdoin's stated
intention to increase the sheer
number of applicants by making
SAT's optional. Their applications
did increase and the interviewer
simply asked me if that observable
effect was not a good reason for
dropping the SAT requirement.
As I said, I think not.
Second, I think the Bowdoin
plan, however appropriate it may
be for Bowdoin, inappropriate for
Stanford. But that particular plan
has never been proposed to the
faculty commission on
admissions, which committee sets
the applications requirements. My
"rejection" of the plan amounts
to little more than my particular
thoughts about it.

Editor:
As an old news hand (not news
hen!) I know that covering fellow
reporters can be dangerous. Daily
reporter Jon Braun proved this in
Thursday's Daily where he dealt
with three women journalists
addressing the Stanford chapter of
Women in Communication.
I was one of the three
panelists, and I must protest the
Daily's report of the program.
Reporter Braun both misquoted
me and generally mixed up who
said what.
The most serious errors in the
. story occurred in reporting an
I incident I experienced at the Palo
, Alto Times in 1960. Unlike the
Daily version, I did not refer to
[ myself as "political editor" of the
i Times, and I did not say that the
Times "business manager"
replaced me in covering the
; Democratic convention that year.
What I did say was that I had
. covered politics for the Times
during the year preceding the
1960 convention, and yet I was
, not allowed to represent the
Times at Los Angeles.
Two Times reporters, both
, men, did cover that convention.
? One was the paper's number one
? political writer, but the other was
I the business editor.
In my talk Wednesday night, I
t only mentioned the business
r editor attending the convention as
> he was the reporter who did the
i job I felt I had qualified for.
Without further detail, I used
> this incident to point up the
» reluctance of some newspapers to
r assign major stories to women,
1 even when they have proved
» themselves capable.
; At the same time, it was Times
) Editor Alexander Bodi who gave
me my first city side job as a
i reporter.
[ It is also true that sex
j ultimately came between the
r Times and me. I not only resigned
t to have a baby, but I chose to
' become pregnant while writing a
r 10-part series for the Times on
birth control and the population

Tunnels Not 'Shortsighted'
Editor:
In his campus news conference
with KZSU Feb. 6, President
Lyman did not call the decision to
build the tunnels at the Stadium
shortsighted.
What he said, in part, was:
"Any decision like that can be
criticized.
"Nobody can ever be sure it
was a God-given, right decision.
"But to tell the Athletic
Department they shouldn't be
able to renovate in any significant
way a tremendous piece of capital
equipment like Stanford Stadium,
which is itself a revenue producing
thing, (to say) they can't do that
until every other need in the
University is met seems to be very
shortsighted."

Hargadon On Bowdoin
Editor:
Two comments of clarification
about your article on Bowdoin
and SAT's (Daily, Feb. 8). First, it
was not Bowdoin's stated
intention to increase the sheer
number of applicants by making
SAT's optional. Their applications
did increase and the interviewer
simply asked me if that observable
effect was not a good reason for
dropping the SAT requirement.
As I said, I think not.
Second, I think the Bowdoin
plan, however appropriate it may
be for Bowdoin, inappropriate for
Stanford. But that particular plan
has never been proposed to the
faculty commission on
admissions, which committee sets
the applications requirements. My
"rejection" of the plan amounts
to little more than my particular
thoughts about it.

Dangerous Reporting
Editor:
As an old news hand (not news
hen!) I know that covering fellow
reporters can be dangerous. Daily
reporter Jon Braun proved this in
Thursday's Daily where he dealt
with three women journalists
addressing the Stanford chapter of
Women in Communication.
I was one of the three
panelists, and I must protest the
Daily's report of the program.
Reporter Braun both misquoted
me and generally mixed up who
said what.
The most serious errors in the
. story occurred in reporting an
I incident I experienced at the Palo
, Alto Times in 1960. Unlike the
Daily version, I did not refer to
[ myself as "political editor" of the
i Times, and I did not say that the
Times "business manager"
replaced me in covering the
; Democratic convention that year.
What I did say was that I had
. covered politics for the Times
during the year preceding the
1960 convention, and yet I was
, not allowed to represent the
Times at Los Angeles.
Two Times reporters, both
, men, did cover that convention.
? One was the paper's number one
? political writer, but the other was
I the business editor.
In my talk Wednesday night, I
t only mentioned the business
r editor attending the convention as
> he was the reporter who did the
i job I felt I had qualified for.
