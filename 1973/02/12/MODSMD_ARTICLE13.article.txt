Why won't the new swimming pool have a roof on it? S.K.
Because it would cost $800,000 extra, according to Bob Young,
Associate Director of Athletics. He did say that the complex is being
constructed in such a way that a roof can be added when the athletic
department has enough money to do it.

Escondido Road between Stanford Avenue and Campus Drive is in
terrible condition. I almost had a head-on collision with a car because
the driver was trying to avoid all of the potholes in the road. Can
something be done about this? J.A.
Three or four horrendous new craters have appeared on Palm Drive
near the turnout for El Camino Real. Can you talk to the responsible
party to have them filled before my suspension requires extreme
unction? S.T.P.
Both areas have been temporarily patched, says Perry Hackett,
Roads and Grounds Manager for Plant Services. He suggested that
from now on, if you want to call a specific area to his attention, call
him at ext. 4388. If you have a question about roads or grounds,
please keep calling Bug!

What types of legal aid are available to students? C.C.
There is no organization which offers legal aid specifically to
students. A Legal Aid Society office is located in the Stanford Law
School but it serves mainly as an educational vehicle for law students
wanting practical experience. According to law student Tyrone Holt,
the student office serves as a "conduit to funnel law school students
into legal aid offices and as a referral service to the public at large."
He said that most Stanford students were probably not eligible for
legal aid, because they could afford the minimum fee. Those ineligible
are sent to the Lawyers Reference Service, where, for a ten dollar fee,
a half-hour appointment is given with an attorney in the appropriate
area.
In last April's ASSU elections, a refundable fee assessment for a
student-controlled public interest law firm was defeated. It needed a
2/3 majority to pass and only received a simple majority. The firm
would have worked on public interest cases but did not propose to
provide the student body directly with legal services.
