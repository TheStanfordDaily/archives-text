# Bach Mai Hospital Donation Petition Lacks Signatures
## 
### 
The controversial Bach Mai
Hospital donation initiative
petition drive in Palo Alto has run
into another hurdle, but its
proponents are confident they can
overcome it.
County election officials
reported Friday that the petitions
had 103 too few valid signatures.
The law allows a 10-day grace
period to collect additional
names, however.
A coalition of peace groups
seeks to place on the May 8
municipal ballot the question of
donating $50,000 of city funds to
help rebuild the bombed-out
Bach Mai Hospital in Hanoi.
Of the approximately 2300
signatures in the first batch of
petitions, submitted last Monday,
only 1543 were found valid. To
place the measure on the ballot,
1646 valid names were needed.
Sponsors have until Feb. 20 to
collect additional signatures, and
they are confident they can do so.
"It'll be no problem at all,"
said Douglas Mattern of the Palo
Alto Peace Union. "We got the
first 2300 in five days."
Even if the supplementary
petitions contain enough
signatures, the measure may not
reach the ballot. City Attorney
Peter Stone believes such a
donation to be "patently illegal"
and says that the City Council
may for that reason refuse to
place the issue before the voters.
Mattem reaffirmed over the
weekend that "We're prepared to
go to court if necessary" should
the Council decline to put the
issue on the ballot.
He said, "I hope they don't do
that. Since the response to our
petition drive was so significant,
they may have second thoughts

and decide to let it go through.
"We will, of course, challenge
any decision to keep the issue off
the ballot," he added.
