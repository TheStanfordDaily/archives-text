# Congress Probes National Emergency
## 
### HARRISON HUMPHRIES

WASHINGTON — For more than
22 years, the United States has
been in a state of "national
emergency" — and ending it is not
as easy as it sounds.
Congress could do it by passing
a one-line resolution. The
President could reinstate it the
next day with a one-line
proclamation.
No one knows at this point the
full extent of what is involved,
except that it is far-reaching and
complex.
The Senate has established a
special bipartisan committee to
study the question and allotted
$175,000 for its work. The
committee is to report its findings
and recommendations by Feb. 28,
1974.
In its first month, the
committee's four-member staff
has identified nearly 300 laws that
give the President, and in some
cases his Cabinet officers, powers
not prescribed by the
Constitution during period of war
or national emergency.
Computers At Work
Government computers in the
General Accounting Office have
been put to work in the search for
other statutes containing
"national emergency" triggers.
The present "emergency" was
proclaimed by President Harry S.
Truman on Dec. 16, 1950, at the
start of U.S. involvement in the
Korean War, and is still in effect.
During the past 22 years
Presidents of the United States
have relied on the proclamation to
issue executive orders on a variety
of subjects without specific
congressional approval.
Used By LBJ
President Johnson used it in
1968 to control investments
abroad and ease that year's
balance of payments crisis.

In February, 1971, President
Nixon used it to suspend
provisions of the Davis-Bacon Act
requiring payment of the
prevailing wage in the area to
workers on federal projects.
Sen. Charles McC. Mathias,
(R.-Md.), first proposed a joint
House-Senate committee in 1971
to study how to go about
terminating the Korean War
emergency and "restore the
constitutional balance between
the Presidency and the Congress."
His resolution has 12 Senate
co-sponsors.
President Can Do Much
Mathias said there are
emergency laws on the statute
books "permitting the President
to sell stocks of strategic
materials, revoke leases on real
and personal property, suspend
rules and regulations applicable to
broadcasting stations, detail
enlisted troops beyond the term
of their enlistments, detail
military men to the governments
of other countries, and exercise
control over consumer credit."

The idea of a joint committee
was dropped in 1972 and
establishment of a special Senate
committee proposed to expedite
action.
The special committee
procedure has two purposes:
— To avoid the appearance of
partisan confrontation between the
Democratic majority on all regular
congressional committees and the
Republican administration is
needed in the inquiry.
— To avoid jurisdictional
conflict between existing
committees in a review of
emergency clauses in laws
extending beyond the
responsibility of any one
committee in such inrelated fields
as agriculture, banking, labor,
foreign affairs and defense.
Administration Agrees
The Nixon administration, in
1971, agreed to cooperate in the
inquiry provided that the special
committee's assignment went
beyond determining how to end
the emergency to include whether
it should be terminated.

As late as June 13, 1972,
Assistant Secretary of State David
M. Abshire wrote:
"The executive branch believes
that a number of statutes
dependent on the existence of a
national emergency cannot be
allowed to lapse at this time."
One of them, he said, is the
Trading with the Enemy Act of
1917 which is "a vital element of
our ability to conduct foreign
policy and protect our national
security."
Last June 23 the Senate
unanimously adopted a revised
Mathias resolution reflecting the
suggestions of the administration
as to the scope of the inquiry.
Report Delayed
The special Senate Committee
on Termination of the National
Emergency was to report its
findings and recommendations by
Feb. 28, 1973, but with
congressional recesses for political
conventions last year the
committee assignments — four
Democrats and four Republicans
— were not made until September.

Sen. Frank Church (D.-Idaho),
was named chairman and Mathias
vice chairman.
In one organization meeting
last year, the committee decided
that it would need more time to
assemble a staff and get started.
The committee also adopted the
proposal of Sen. Church that to
emphasize the bipartisan nature of
the project Sen. Mathias would be
given equivalent status as
co-chairman.
Routine Approval
On Jan. 3, the opening day of
the new Congress, Church and
Mathias jointly introduced a new
resolution reauthorizing the
committee, providing for
co-chairmen, extending its
deadline for a year and increasing
its expenditure limit from
$100,000 to $175,000. It was
adopted routinely, without
debate, Jan. 6.
Appointed as staff director was
William G. Miller, former Foreign
Service officer who had served
until the end of 1972 as foreign
affairs specialist on the staff of
retiring Sen. John Sherman
Cooper (R.-Ky.).
Miller, who said he was
"drafted" for the job, told a
newsman that $100,000 of the
committee allowance will be spent
for staff salaries if the work takes
the full 14 months, but that he
hopes for a final report in eight
months. Miller will be paid about
$32,000 a year, the same salary he
received on Cooper's staff.
What Task Involves
The task involves:
— Searching out all the laws
affected.
— Sorting them into categories.
— Seeking out and interviewing
the men who drafted thestatutes
as to the reasons for the
emergency clause.
— Attempting to define a
genuine "national emergency."
— Arranging for expert
witnesses for public hearings,
expected to begin next month.
— Consulting officials of the
executive branch departments and
the White House.

President Johnson used it in

to study how to go about
terminating the Korean War

His resolution has 12 Senate
co-sponsors.

Mathias said there are
emergency laws on the statute
books "permitting the President
to sell stocks of strategic
materials, revoke leases on real
and personal property, suspend
rules and regulations applicable to
broadcasting stations, detail
enlisted troops beyond the term
of their enlistments, detail
military men to the governments
of other countries, and exercise
control over consumer credit."

The idea of a joint committee
was dropped in 1972 and
establishment of a special Senate
committee proposed to expedite
action.
The special committee
procedure has two purposes:
— To avoid the appearance of
partisan confrontation between the
Democratic majority on all regular
congressional committees and the
Republican administration is
needed in the inquiry.
— To avoid jurisdictional
conflict between existing
committees in a review of
emergency clauses in laws
extending beyond the
responsibility of any one
committee in such inrelated fields
as agriculture, banking, labor,
foreign affairs and defense.
Administration Agrees
The Nixon administration, in
1971, agreed to cooperate in the
inquiry provided that the special
committee's assignment went
beyond determining how to end
the emergency to include whether
it should be terminated.

As late as June 13, 1972,
Assistant Secretary of State David
M. Abshire wrote:
"The executive branch believes

One of them, he said, is the

Democrats and four Republicans
— were not made until September.

Sen. Frank Church (D.-Idaho),

In one organization meeting
last year, the committee decided
that it would need more time to
assemble a staff and get started.
The committee also adopted the
proposal of Sen. Church that to
emphasize the bipartisan nature of
the project Sen. Mathias would be
given equivalent status as
co-chairman.
Routine Approval
On Jan. 3, the opening day of
the new Congress, Church and
Mathias jointly introduced a new
resolution reauthorizing the
committee, providing for
co-chairmen, extending its
deadline for a year and increasing
its expenditure limit from
$100,000 to $175,000. It was
adopted routinely, without

Appointed as staff director was
William G. Miller, former Foreign
Service officer who had served
until the end of 1972 as foreign
affairs specialist on the staff of
retiring Sen. John Sherman
Cooper (R.-Ky.).
Miller, who said he was
"drafted" for the job, told a
newsman that $100,000 of the
committee allowance will be spent
for staff salaries if the work takes
the full 14 months, but that he
hopes for a final report in eight
months. Miller will be paid about
$32,000 a year, the same salary he
received on Cooper's staff.

The task involves:
— Searching out all the laws
affected.
— Sorting them into categories.

Mathias said there are
emergency laws on the statute
books "permitting the President
to sell stocks of strategic
materials, revoke leases on real
and personal property, suspend
rules and regulations applicable to
broadcasting stations, detail
enlisted troops beyond the term
of their enlistments, detail
military men to the governments
of other countries, and exercise
control over consumer credit."

The idea of a joint committee
was dropped in 1972 and
establishment of a special Senate
committee proposed to expedite
action.
The special committee
procedure has two purposes:
— To avoid the appearance of
partisan confrontation between the
Democratic majority on all regular
congressional committees and the
Republican administration is
needed in the inquiry.
— To avoid jurisdictional
conflict between existing
committees in a review of
emergency clauses in laws
extending beyond the
responsibility of any one
committee in such inrelated fields
as agriculture, banking, labor,
foreign affairs and defense.
Administration Agrees
The Nixon administration, in
1971, agreed to cooperate in the
inquiry provided that the special
committee's assignment went
beyond determining how to end
the emergency to include whether
it should be terminated.

As late as June 13, 1972,
Assistant Secretary of State David
M. Abshire wrote:
"The executive branch believes
that a number of statutes
dependent on the existence of a
national emergency cannot be
allowed to lapse at this time."
One of them, he said, is the
Trading with the Enemy Act of
1917 which is "a vital element of
our ability to conduct foreign
policy and protect our national
security."
Last June 23 the Senate
unanimously adopted a revised
Mathias resolution reflecting the
suggestions of the administration
as to the scope of the inquiry.
Report Delayed
The special Senate Committee
on Termination of the National
Emergency was to report its
findings and recommendations by
Feb. 28, 1973, but with
congressional recesses for political
conventions last year the
committee assignments — four
Democrats and four Republicans
— were not made until September.

Sen. Frank Church (D.-Idaho),
was named chairman and Mathias
vice chairman.
In one organization meeting
last year, the committee decided
that it would need more time to
assemble a staff and get started.
The committee also adopted the
proposal of Sen. Church that to
emphasize the bipartisan nature of
the project Sen. Mathias would be
given equivalent status as
co-chairman.
Routine Approval
On Jan. 3, the opening day of
the new Congress, Church and
Mathias jointly introduced a new
resolution reauthorizing the
committee, providing for
co-chairmen, extending its
deadline for a year and increasing
its expenditure limit from
$100,000 to $175,000. It was
adopted routinely, without
debate, Jan. 6.
Appointed as staff director was
William G. Miller, former Foreign
Service officer who had served
until the end of 1972 as foreign
affairs specialist on the staff of
retiring Sen. John Sherman
Cooper (R.-Ky.).
Miller, who said he was
"drafted" for the job, told a
newsman that $100,000 of the
committee allowance will be spent
for staff salaries if the work takes
the full 14 months, but that he
hopes for a final report in eight
months. Miller will be paid about
$32,000 a year, the same salary he
received on Cooper's staff.
What Task Involves
The task involves:
— Searching out all the laws
affected.
— Sorting them into categories.
— Seeking out and interviewing
the men who drafted thestatutes
as to the reasons for the
emergency clause.
— Attempting to define a
genuine "national emergency."
— Arranging for expert
witnesses for public hearings,
expected to begin next month.
— Consulting officials of the
executive branch departments and
the White House.

WASHINGTON — For more than
22 years, the United States has
been in a state of "national
emergency" — and ending it is not
as easy as it sounds.
Congress could do it by passing
a one-line resolution. The
President could reinstate it the
next day with a one-line
proclamation.
No one knows at this point the
full extent of what is involved,
except that it is far-reaching and
complex.
The Senate has established a
special bipartisan committee to
study the question and allotted
$175,000 for its work. The
committee is to report its findings
and recommendations by Feb. 28,
1974.
In its first month, the
committee's four-member staff
has identified nearly 300 laws that
give the President, and in some
cases his Cabinet officers, powers
not prescribed by the
Constitution during period of war
or national emergency.
Computers At Work
Government computers in the
General Accounting Office have
been put to work in the search for
other statutes containing
"national emergency" triggers.
The present "emergency" was
proclaimed by President Harry S.
Truman on Dec. 16, 1950, at the
start of U.S. involvement in the
Korean War, and is still in effect.
During the past 22 years
Presidents of the United States
have relied on the proclamation to
issue executive orders on a variety
of subjects without specific
congressional approval.
Used By LBJ
President Johnson used it in
1968 to control investments
abroad and ease that year's
balance of payments crisis.

In February, 1971, President
Nixon used it to suspend
provisions of the Davis-Bacon Act
requiring payment of the
prevailing wage in the area to
workers on federal projects.
Sen. Charles McC. Mathias,
(R.-Md.), first proposed a joint
House-Senate committee in 1971
to study how to go about
terminating the Korean War
emergency and "restore the
constitutional balance between
the Presidency and the Congress."
His resolution has 12 Senate
co-sponsors.

Mathias said there are
emergency laws on the statute
books "permitting the President
to sell stocks of strategic
materials, revoke leases on real
