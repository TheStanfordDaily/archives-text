# Women's Rights Amendment Faces Trouble In Two States
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The equal
rights amendment to the U.S.
Constitution is inching its way
toward ratification, but has run
into trouble in several states. Two
states that previously adopted the
amendment are considering
measures to rescind approval.
The amendment needs the
approval of 38 states to become
law. Thus far it has been passed in
26 states. The most recent to act
were Minnesota, Oregon and
Mississippi.
It was ratified in Minnesota

and Oregon on Thursday, but a
Mississippi legislative committee
killed the ratification attempt for
the current session by tabling a
resolution approving the
amendment. About half a dozen
states have rejected the proposal.
It is pending in the rest.
The language of the proposed
amendment is simple: "Equality
of rights under the law shall not
be denied or abridged by the
United States or by any state on
account of sex."
The issues it has raised,

however, have been complex and
often controversial. Opponents
claim the amendment would
create chaos in the nation's legal
system and would result in
women being drafted â€” an
argument rendered moot by the
recent end of the draft.
Montana State Sen. John K.
McDonald, an opponent of the
measure, argued during debate:
"If Jesus wanted people to be
equal, he would have had six men
and six women apostles."
The amendment was passed by
the Montana House of
Representatives, killed by the
Senate, revived on a technicality
and tabled. Passage this session is
considered unlikely.
Julia Miller, coordinator of a
group of women's clubs working
for the amendment, said, "I'm
optimistic about its passage, but I
don't think we are going to get it
without a great deal of hard
work."
A House committee in Georgia
held hearings on the amendment
on Wednesday. Martha Gaines of
Atlanta, representing the Georgia
branch of the National
Organization of Women, claimed
that opponents of the amendment
were "playing on fears."
"They're saying that it would
render impossible sexual privacy
and that it would do away with
public toilets," she testified. "This
is simply not so. This is a
smokescreen."
Idaho and Nebraska are
considering rescinding ratification.
The Idaho House Judiciary and
Rules Committee held its first
hearing on the resolution Monday
and will decide on Friday whether
to hold another one.
