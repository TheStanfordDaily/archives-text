# Glide Celebrates 'Liberation'
## 
### BRUCE KADDEN 
It was called "Celebration of
Liberation." People from all ethnic
groups, age levels and various
sub-cultures attended. There were
many themes: "Coming together" and
"being honest with ourselves" were
two.
The "celebration" was a vespers
service put on by Reverend A. Cecil
Williams and the Glide Memorial
Church Ensemble last night in Mem
Chu.
The service consisted of a sermon
with contemporary songs and music,
highlighted by a continuous light
show. Williams promised, "We'll move
you" at the beginning of the
celebration, and that they did.
Williams possessed a casual style, as
he conducted the service. He didn't
use the pulpit as a stage, but moved
freely among the congregation.
"We cannot separate what we think
and what we feel," Williams told the
audience during his sermon. "Don't
tell me what you believe, show me,"
he urged.
Williams' goal is to be "the most
human person you've ever met." He
believes "We shall all be liberated
together or we shall not be liberated at
all."
His philosophies were reflected in

all aspects of the service. The light
show emphasized cultural harmony.
Slides, showing people of all ethnic
groups, were highlighted by a color
wheel display.
The songs were built around a
"freedom" theme. The audience
heartily participated in the singing of
"Kum Ba Yah" and "Joshua Fit the
Battle of Jerico."
One part of the service presented a
bit of black history, "where we
were ... where we are ... where we
ought to go." The slides included
pictures of Martin Luther King,
Malcolm X, and Jackie Robinson.
Williams is preaching minister of
Glide Memorial United Methodist
Church in San Francisco. He conducts
celebrations, similar to the one he
conducted here, twice each Sunday
before approximately 2500 people.
The people involved with Glide
attempt to provide a platform for
unheard people of the Bay Area and
try to resolve many of the problems
they are facing such as hunger and
poverty.
Williams has projected that Glide
can become a "Wailing Wall," a place
where people who are struggling to
survive and who need some place to go
can discover themselves.
The service marked the conclusion

of the observance of Black History
week here. It was sponsored by the
ASSU Speakers Bureau, ASSU Special
Events Board, the Black Students
Union, Memorial Church,
Afro-American Studies program and
the Provost's office.
