Following are excerpts from the annual report of the
Career Planning and Placement Center for 1971-72.
Use of the services of the Career Planning and
Placement Center among all students increased substan
tially over last year. A total of 1819 graduating students
registered for services during 1971-72, as against 1385
during 1970-71; an actual increase of 434, or 31%.
Alumni registration amounted to 1094, making the total
registration, 2913. The increase in Alumni registration
over the previous year amounted to 12%.
Separate from services related to career placement, a
total of approximately 2900 hours was devoted to
students who "signed-up" for counseling sessions with
the various directors. Many of these were students below
the senior year level who wanted to discuss questions
relating to career decisions. Many hours of additional
counseling took the form of group sessions in the
residences, Tresidder Union, and the professional
schools.
The number of companies and government agencies
interviewing at Stanford increased to 369 as compared
to 352 for the year 1971-72. Despite this increase, the
number of interviews decreased from 7789 to 6853. The
decrease is attributed to a decrease in the number of
interview schedules, which fell from 813 to 744 when
compared to 1970-71. That the number of placements
actually increased under these conditions attests to the
success with which Stanford's graduates can compete in
a tight job market.
The number of placements for the year probably
exceeds significantly the number recorded. The total
registrants who did not report their employment status
amounted to 300. Past experience has shown that about
one-third of those not reporting do find jobs and that
about two-thirds continue their studies in graduate
schools.
In sum, the record shows that Stanford's graduates
find significant employment. The exceptions are those
who apply for employment after receiving the bachelor's
degree in a liberal arts subject. That this has suddenly
become a significant factor is attributed to the substan
tial number of these graduates who are now seeking
employment rather than continuing at the graduate
level.
The Survey of Future Academic Plans of Graduating
Students - Class of 1972 ("The Senior Survey â€” 1972")
conducted by the Academic Information Center, shows
that fewer than 50% of Stanford's seniors plan to go on
immediately to graduate schools. Of those who do not
plan to continue immediately, 34% of the men, and 40%
of the women indicate that they plan to work. The
report for all seniors planning to work, based on the AIC
report, is 36%.
In this connection, it bears repeating that 29% of
Stanford's liberal arts seniors registered for permanent
service with the Director of Humanities Placement, (322
out of 1135 graduating). When candidates from the
Science Departments who registered with the Director of
Humanities Placement are added, the number of regis
trants increase to 434 of 1486 graduating seniors, and
the percentage registered remains at 29 percent.
Consequently, it appears that most of those who
reported an intent to work, actually followed through
on their efforts to find a job.
Job Prospects for the Period 1973-1980
Predicting career opportunities for future college and
university graduates is a difficult business. The Bureau of
Labor Statistics regularly estimates future requirements
and publishes its data periodically.
Many of the professional personnel administrators in
business and industry feel that these reports tend to be
overly optimistic and based on questionable data. In the
field of chemistry, for example, BLS projects annual
requirements for chemists which exceed by several
thousand the annual requirements estimated by those in
the chemical professions.
Part of the discrepancy appears to be the failure of
the BLS to recognize that many companies are making
more use of nondegree holders. There is an increasing
tendency to employ associate degree candidates and
science technicians, thereby decreasing the number of
positions open to those securing B.S. and B.A. degrees.
At the same time there is a growing tendency to cut
back on the use of those holding masters and Ph.D.
degrees. The belt-tightening of the last few years ap
parently has taught business and industry how to be
more efficient.
Another problem with BLS figures is the apparent
inclination to project estimates based on a fully em
ployed labor force (4% or less), and on a slowed rate of
inflation. Both practices seem unrealistic.
What may be needed is a business by business and
industry by industry development of a basis for project
ing requirements for future college graduates. Such a
move would in time provide for a somewhat more
accurate basis for determining job prospects.
At present, the most reliable indicator available is
probably the College Placement Council's annual study
of Beginning Offers by Business and Industry. These
studies, of course, do not attempt to predict but rather
project for the near future based upon the hiring
estimates for business and industry for the current year.
Fortunately, the prospects for 1972-1973's graduates
"look good;" that is except at the doctoral level and for
liberal arts graduates. The Council reported in January
1973 that, "Compared to January 1972 the number of
offers for bachelor's candidates is up 46% while the
volume for master's candidates has risen 44%. The story
is different at the doctoral level where, after a slight
improvement last January, volume has dropped back
7%."
These figures are based upon returns from 672
respondents expecting to hire college and university
graduates in 1972-1973.
The Council reports that "Prospects appear brightest
for those students majoring in engineering, particularly
at the bachelor's level."
The Council advises that, "The only discipline not
getting its share of the general upward movement. . .is
nontechnical other than business" (graduates). The re
port indicates, in this connection, that offers to MBA's
are up 23 percent over January 1972.
Career Planning
This year the Career Planning and Placement Center is
in its third year of operation as a center focusing
emphasis upon career planning as well as placement
services. During the course of these two years much has
been learned about this asp>ect of the program. Most
importantly, it becomes apparent and often obvious that
students are pursuing courses of study without any
considerable thought being given to the uses which will
be made of the work being undertaken.
Recently Harvard's President Bok stated that: "One
of the important purposes of undergraduate education is

to provide an atmosphere in which students can make
tentative judgment about their relationship to society
and the role they wish to play in society following
graduation."
This mandate is not peculiar to Harvard University.
The Founding Grant of Stanford University, phrased in
the words of Mrs. Stanford, provided that this University
was established "to qualify students for personal success
and direct usefulness in life."
Many years later (1931), President Ray Lyman Wil
bur stated that "the lack of knowledge of the ordinary
boy and girl of the vocations and of the professions is
appalling. A large number of our youth have tound
themselves dislocated, in an economic sense, at the very
beginning of their life careers." If that statement had
been made yesterday, one could not question its validity
with any substantial justification.
Much of the current unemployment is directly a
result of the fact that many graduating students have
given but little thought to what they want to do
professionally.
It should not be concluded that a student should
make an early decision regarding a career field and stick
to it. At the same time, however, the student should be
using available information regarding career opportuni
ties as a basis for contemplating various alternatives for
the future. If planning does not so involve one's think
ing, it is likely that the future will be based upon chance
and the accidental incidents at the moment a decision
becomes necessary.
In a sense, career planning and placement counseling
occur at the same time. This situation occurs primarily
in the case of seniors and graduate students. At the
undergraduate level below the senior year, this sort of
counseling occurs primarily as a result of discussions
between students and the Coordinator of Summer Em
ployment; less often between students and the Director
of Student Employment. In the latter case, the counsel
ing is directed toward informing students about the
other counseling services which are available at the
Career Planning and Placement Center.
The time limitation factor fundamentally pertains to
group counseling. During the last year most group
counseling took place in the residences in the evening
and at Tresidder Union during the late afternoon. One
group situation involved working with SWOPSI. Group
counseling takes place primarily as a result of the "add
on" efforts of the Center and are limited to the time
available to the staff during the late afternoon and
evening.
Liberal Arts Placement
While there are some reasons for encouragement in
respect to liberal arts placement efforts, there are also
reasons to be discouraged. Much of the placement
effected during 1971-72 was in positions relatively un
related to a college degree. Many of the positions
obtained were as sales clerks, stenographers, and secre
taries.
A significant corollary is the fact that many of the
minority students attending Stanford are majoring in
liberal arts subjects. A sizeable proportion of these
students have expressed an intent to attend either
medical school or law school. A study conducted by the
Career Planning and Placement Center during 1970-71
indicates that approximately 39 percent of black stu
dents and 39 percent of Chicano students hope to enter
either medical school or law school.
The Academic Information Center's study of 1972's
seniors shows that 137 graduates submitted 720 applica
tions to law schools, resulting in 271 acceptances. This
amounts to an acceptance rate of only 38 percent.
It would appear probable therefore that many minori
ty students are going to be disappointed in their efforts
to secure admission to law schools. Information concern
ing efforts to secure admission to medical schools is not
available. It is improbable, however, that the result
would be more encouraging.
It is also probable that many of those who fail to
secure admission to medical school and law school will
subsequently seek employment using their liberal arts
degrees as a basis for qualifying for employment.
Such circumstances provide a dismal prognosis for
these students, as well as for other liberal arts graduates
seeking employment.
Fortunately, in a sense, the Academic Information
Center study indicates that approximately 82 percent of
Stanford's 1972 graduates plan to continue in graduate
study within four years. Perhaps this fact will compen
sate in significant part for the lack of professional
quaUfication among many of Stanford's four year grad
uates, in that they subsequently may become better
qualified.
Unfortunately, however, this conjecture does not
provide a solution for the liberal arts graduate who does
not plan to continue graduate study at any time, but
who does plan to work immediately. The Academic
Information Center study indicates that approximately 9
percent of Stanford's graduates fall into this category.
We have at least that much of a problem.
The staff of the Career Planning and Placement
Center and the Director of Humanities Placement in
particular, are especially sensitive to these conditions
and a clear awareness of the acuteness of the problem
exists. There is not, however, a corresponding insight to
the solutions.
One thing is reasonably clear. We are living in a world
of specialization. At the point in time when an individ
ual seeks employment, he or she must generally be able
to exhibit qualifications which correspond to certain job
specifications. There are, of course, exceptions. Often
times the individual's personality, general education, and
intelligence will represent job qualifications. Such oppor

tunities, however, are infrequent compared to those
where more elaborate qualifications are required.
In a sense, it turns out that most of us need two kinds
of education; one with which we qualify ourselves to
lead the "good life," and the other by which we qualify
ourselves to "earn a living"
It is not easy to fit both of these into a four year
liberal arts curriculum. Perhaps we could come nearer to
such an objective if course offerings were more extensive
and counseling more precise and productive. For exam
ple, it is possible even now within limits, through careful
educational planning, for a Stanford undergraduate
majoring in economics to secure a "Stanford education,"
and at the same time to secure a "business education"
which is probably more solid fundamentally than that
obtained at many universities offering a baccalaureate
degree in business administration.
Last year's liberal arts seniors who secured "good
jobs," indeed had generally developed and implemented
such a plan.
It is simply unreasonable, however, tor large numbers
of liberal arts undergraduates to expect that they will be
able to compete successfully for positions calling for
certain minimum professional qualifications without
supplementing their education, either as they go or
afterwards.
The answer in part may be more course offerings
designed to develop professional qualification in various
career specializations. This does not mean that fewer
courses would be offered in general education. It does
mean that the liberal arts students would be able to
develop an educational plan which would more nearly be
professionally qualifying after completing a four year
program and without degrading his or her liberal arts
education.
Competition for jobs which are available in business,
industry, education, and government will become in
creasingly intensified. The number of bachelor's degrees
conferred last year in the U.S. amounted to 839,730.
This is double the number earned in 1962.
Accompanying this development is the fact that
during the last two years there has been a tendency to
hire more and more community college graduates, there
by relatively cutting down on the number of bachelor's
degree candidates who can be employed each year.
In this connection, the Secretary of Labor has re
ported recently, "Eight out of ten jobs to be filled
during the 1970's will be open to people who have not
completed four years of college."
At the moment (January 1973) the College Place
ment Council reports, based upon its annual survey of
the job market, "The decline in College recruiting
activity appears to be over. . .the number of offers
reported (January 1973) for bachelor's candidates is up
46%. .. ." At the same time it reports, "The only
discipline category not getting its share of the general
upward movement looked for in the labor market for
college graduates is nontechnicak other than business."
It is abundantly clear that the Career Planning and
Placement Center for some time to come shall neces
sarily have to focus much of its attention sharply on the
liberal arts graduates.
Educational Placement
Registration of candidates for positions in the educa
tional profession, including educational administration
and public education, as well as higher education,
amounted to 1409 during 1971-1972, as compared to
1272 during 1970-1971. Excluding classroom positions,
a total of 4821 position vacancies were identified. This
figure represents a gain in the number of positions open
over the previous year when the number was 4186. This
is the first gain in six years.
It is clear that the job market for those in the
educational profession in general remains relatively tight
compared to the recent past. The slight improvement,
however, is indeed welcome.
In general the continuing tight market is believed to
represent budgetary limitations in public school systems
throughout the U.S., especially in the large city systems.
The number of on-campus interviews for education
increased slightly, up from 282 to 292. The intensity of
the efforts to Stanford's candidates to secure employ
ment is perhaps best illustrated by the number of
written applications submitted to prospective employers.
The number of placement files mailed to prospective
employers increased during the year from 11,318 to
15,712, an increase of 4394, or a percentage increase of
39 percent.
Ph.D. Placement
Again this year, doctoral degree registrants who had
completed their dissertations were in almost all instances
successful in obtaining college and university teaching
positions. Of the few who were not successful, some
were in narrow specialties for which there were few if
any vacancies. The remaining few were unsuccessful
primarily because, by choice or marriage, they had
restricted themselves to a very limited geographical area.
As was the case last year, those who did not complete
the dissertation were generally unsuccessful in obtaining
full-time positions. A few did find full-time or part-time
positions, but most continued their work toward com
pleting the dissertation. Most candidates obtained con
tinued limited financial support from their departments.
Doctoral candidates registered in all disciplines
totaled 359. Of these, 137 found teaching positions.
Those continuing with their studies amounted to 161.
Thirty-three registrants, already employed, continued in
their current positions. Twenty-two registrants did not
report their employment status, and 66 reported that
they were unemployed.

Junior College Placement
Very few candidates registered for Junior College
placement. Relatively few Stanford students who
registered for Junior College placement had initially
pursued their major with the intent to teach in a
community college. Most of them had no teacher train
ing or prior teaching experience.
In many instances, only as a last resort did they
include Junior College teaching as a vocational choice. In
spite of these limitations, approximately 30 percent of
those registered found full-time teaching positions at the
Junior College level.
In general, Ph.D. placement for Stanford's candidates
with degrees in hand has not been a problem. Most
registrants secure positions. This result is attributed
largely to the quality of the candidates and to the direct
involvement of the departments in the placement effort.
Registrants are now coming in for registration inter
views early in the year with the result that their files are
completed well in advance of the professional conven
tions.
All major departments have designated either a facul
ty member or a staff member as a placement adviser. In
most departments, adivsers are giving more personal
direct assistance. Many are writing personal letter to
prospective employers recommended their advisees.
All of these efforts have resulted in a more productive
job search, especially in respect to the volume of
applications. For example, already this year (1972-73),
the departments have mailed the following number of
confidential files in behalf of their respective candidates.
English 502
Languages 310
History 540
Political Science 78
Classics 40
Philosophy 75
The efforts on the part of the departments represent
the sort of involvement in placement activities which are
likely to produce maximum results as well as contribute
toward the most effective cooperation between the
departments and the Career Planning and Placement
Center.
Secondary School Placement
Secondary teacher placements among the graduates
of Stanford's STEP Program (Stanford Teacher Educa
tion Program) continued for the year at a rate far above
the national average for secondary teachers even if the
figures are compared to periods of teacher shortages.
National Teacher Education Association statistics
reveal that during periods of teacher shortages, teachers
at the secondary level entering teaching immediately
following graduation range from 54 to 69 percent. Of
Stanford's STEP graduates 78 out of 102, or 76 percent,
directly entered the classroom.
This figure would have been significantly higher had
it not been for the fact that seven graduates of the
program chose to continue graduate studies, and another
13 chose other kinds of employment as a preference
over teaching. Of the 102 students in the program, two
reported themselves out of the market and two did not
report their employment status.
Engineering and Science Placement
Among those receiving bachelor's degrees, 41 percent
continued toward an advanced degree, 24 percent took
regular employment, 25 percent did not report their
employment status, and six percent went into military
service. Only 1.7 percent reported that they were "still
looking."
Among master's degree candidates 2.7 percent re
ported they were still looking. In other words, only 17
of 627 receiving master's degrees reported themselves
still available for employment.
Among 38 receiving the engineer degree only one
candidate reported that he was available for employ
ment.
Of the 156 receiving the Ph.D. degree only six
reported that they were still available for employment.
Student Employment
A total of 5320 students registered by quarters for
part-time and summer employment as compared to 4350
in 1970-1 971; an increase of 970. These students filled a
total of 3113 jobs and received an estimated income of
approximately $503,881. Summer placements totaled
522, adding $339,600 in student income; making for a
total student income of $843,481.
The obvious implication of these figures is that as
educational costs increase each year, so do the number
of students, including many minority candidates, who
are in search of part-time and/or summer employment as
a means of defraying these rising expenses.
Realizing this increasing student need, the Student
Employment Office has concentrated a great deal of its
energies on identifying jobs which would meet the
demand.
As was done last year, two students were hired to
work primarily in the area of job development. They
contacted many local businesses, industrial plants, and
governmental agencies. Several other companies and
businessmen were visited by the director. As a direct
result, the number and variety of positions available to
students for part-time work increased.
This year the Coordinator of Summer Employment
joined the staff of the Director of Summer Employment
as the Assistant Director. This in effect gave Student
Employment a full-time professional counselor who
could participate in field work job development.
The Summer Coordinator visited many companies
and businesses in both the Bay Area and the greater Los
Angeles area in search of summer positions. Working
closely with alumni and alumni clubs, mass mailings
were sent across the country in an effort to locate
openings for students returning home for the summer.
The combination of the two (i.e. direct contact and
mass mailing) is largely responsible for the increase in
positions filled and, subsequently, increased net earn
ings. However, as was the case last year, out-of-state
employment was the least successful portion of the total
summer operation, even though several government
internship opportunities were filled by Stanford stu
dents. These positions were secured and filled largely
because of a coordinated effort among the Student
Employment Office, Bowman Alumni House, and the
student group PAIS.
Campus employment figures are down from last year.
This trend downwards can largely be attributed to the
University policy adopted in February 1971, which
provides in effect that any on-campus job which can be
filled by a student and would net that student over $50
per quarter, must be listed with the Office of Financial
Aids.
It is estimated that approximately 372 black stu
dents, 222 chicanos, and 408 Asian American and
foreign students received job referrals from the part-time
section of the Student Employment Office.
