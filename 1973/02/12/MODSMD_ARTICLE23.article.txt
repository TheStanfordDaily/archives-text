The Stanford women's B basketball team played against Humboldt
State's varsity Friday afternoon at the Women's gym and the Stanford
girls learned a fast lesson in the art of basketball. After a fairly even
first half which ended with Humboldt leading 17-14, Stanford was
unable to match Humboldt's quickness in the second period and came
out on the short end of a 47-22 score.
The B team was playing Friday since Stanford coach Shirley
Schoof decided to have her A team play three of the six varsity games
and the B team perform in the other three contests. Last Wednesday
the A team opened the Stanford season with a convincing 40-17
victory over Santa Clara. Blythe Mickelson led all scorers with an
impressive 22 point performance.
Stanford's overall basketball talent seems markedly improved since
last year. The calibre of the 1973 B team is considered comparable to
last year's A squad. "We've got a lot of good basketball players," said
Charlotte Donnelly, a member of the A team. "It's just a matter of
getting everything together."
The A team will travel to UC Davis tomorrow night for a 6:30
game against Davis. Stanford's next home game will be on March 6
against San Jose State.
