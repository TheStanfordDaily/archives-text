# 53 Miscues In Two Losses
## Turnovers Costly For Cards In Oregon 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
Fifty-three turnovers spelled disaster for Stanford this
weekend, as the Cards dropped a pair of six point
decisions to Oregon and Oregon State in the Pacific
Northwest.
Stanford came into the crucial Pac-8 series with a
three game winning streak and high hopes for a weekend
sweep which would have vaulted the Cards into
legitimate contention for second place in the conference.
But after a 62-56 loss to Oregon in Eugene Friday night
and a regionally televised 74-68 setback to the Beavers
Saturday afternoon in Corvallis, Stanford's Pac-8 record
stands at a dismal 2-5 and the Cards' overall mark is a
mediocre 9-9.
The weekend started on a sour note as Coach Howie
Dallmar's Cards went five full minutes Friday night
before Rich Kelley scored Stanford's first field goal. A
momentary Stanford surge gave the Cards an 11-10 lead
with about 10 minutes remaining in the first half but
Oregon quickly erased Stanford's slim margin and the
Cards never led again.
Oregon freshman Ron Lee, the game's top scorer with
17 points, hit a 20 foot jumper at the first half buzzer to
give the Ducks a 30-24 halftime advantage.
Score Tied Five Times
After the intermission Stanford managed a gradual
comeback and finally tied the score at 44-44 with 9:36
remaining. The score was tied four more times in the
next six minutes until Oregon center Gerald Willett put
the Ducks in front by four with 3:15 left.
Kelley fouled out about a minute later and when
Steve Shupe missed a one and one opportunity with

1:50 remaining and the Cards trailing by four, Oregon's
victory was assured.
Keiley and Bob Buell paced Stanford with 14 points
each while Mike Mann contributed 12 in one of his
better recent performances. Lee took game honors with
17 points and Doug Little, the Pac-B's leading scorer,
added 15. It was the Ducks' ninth victory against no
defeats at McArthur Court. Oregon is 2-7 on the road.
Before Saturday afternoon's battle in Corvallis,
Dallmar reflected on the previous night's loss in Eugene.
"They [Oregon] played very aggressive defense," he
said, "and those turnovers (30 for the game) killed us
even though we recovered and played a little better the
second half."
More Turnovers
Turnovers killed the Cards again Saturday, as 14 Card
miscues resulted in a 41-31 halftime deficit. Mark
Gilberg was 4-5 from the field and added two free
throws for a 10 point first half effort. But Keiley

managed only two first half points as the Beavers
successfully bottled him up inside.
Stanford's play was a little less ragged in the second
half (only nine turnovers) and the Cards pulled within
four points at 68-64 with 1:25 remaining. OSU's Charlie
Neal hit two free throws seven seconds later, however,
and Stanford's comeback and Kelley's 17 second half
points were wasted. Overall the Beavers were 16-18 from
the free throw line.
Oregon State's victory was its seventh straight. The
Beavers, ranked 18th nationally in the UPI poll,
improved their Pac-8 to 5-2 and their overall mark to
14-5.
Kelley's 19 points led all scorers while OSU center
Neal Jurgenson netted 18. Cliff Jones and Sam
Whitehead contributed 12 and 11 respectively for the
Beavers while Gilberg (14), Buell (11), and Mel
Arterberry (8) were the other significant scorers for
Stanford.
Patterson Contained
Freshman Tim Patterson, who had scored 48 points
in Stanford's last three games against Utah, UC Santa
Barbara, and California, managed only eight points in
the two game series.
Stanford will face the same two teams next weekend
at Maples Pavilion. Obviously the Cards will have to cut
down on their exorbitant turnover totals and get the ball
inside to the big men more often if they expect to
reverse this past weekend's results.
Oregon State Coach Ralph Miller said after his team
had defeated the Cards, "I don't think we scared 'em at
all. We've got our work cut out for us next week."
