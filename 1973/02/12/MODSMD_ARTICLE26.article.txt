# JV Cagers Beat UOP And Merritt Behind Balanced Offensive Attack
## 
### MARK WHITE 
Getting the balanced scoring they needed
to win, Stanford's junior varsity basketball
team shot their way to two victories this
weekend, beating University of Pacific in
Stockton 50-47 Friday and then defeating
Merritt College in Oakland Saturday, 74-68.
In both games the Cardinals got productive
performances from several players. Against
UOP's Tigers, Mike Kehrli scored 12 points.
Mary Moroski contributed 11, Ed Schweitzer
had 10 and Kevin Enright added nine in a
contest which matched Stanford's height
against UOP's quickness. This balanced
scoring and the Cardinal edge in rebounding
(42-28 for the game) propelled the Cards to
an 18 point lead midway in the second half.
UOP refused to fold, however, and behind
15 points by Tiger center Steve Dahl, pared
Stanford's lead to one point with just a few
minutes left in the game. The outcome of the
game was in doubt until Enright got the ball
to Schweitzer on a late jump-ball. Schweitzer
scored on the play, giving Stanford the 50-47

victory.
Moroski came up with his best
performance of the season against Merritt
College Saturday evening. He scored a game
high 27 points, connecting on nearly two
thirds of his shots, but the freshman from
Marin almost didn't make it to the game as he
missed the team bus. Luckily he got a ride
with a Daily reporter covering the game and
arrived just in time to suit up for the contest.
Schweitzer opened the game with a basket
on an assist from Enright and this
combination led Stanford to an early six point
lead as Stanford's inside game worked
effectively against the smaller Thunderbirds.
Stanford's lead was short-lived, however, as
poor Cardinal ball handling and a tough
T-Bird zone press forced Stanford into several
turnovers. Merritt's deft guard, Ron Gipson,
scored 10 points in four minutes and led his
team to an 18-12 lead.
Schweitzer and Moroski retaliated with a
combined output of 10 points in the next
three minutes and Stanford regained the lead,

22-18 at the 11 minute mark. The Cards then
became reluctant to shoot from the outside,
tried to force the ball inside, and Merritt
outscored the Cards 12-2. The teams traded
baskets the rest of the period and Merritt left
the floor with a 34-32 halftime lead.
Second Half Comeback
Still reluctant to take the outside shot, the
Cards continued to trail through the opening
minutes of the second half. Stanford trailed
by nine until Schweitzer and Moroski's back
to back three point plays brought the Cards
within three points midway in the half.
Seb Ficcadenti capped a seven point
Cardinal outburst minutes later with a tip-in
that gave Stanford its first lead of the half,
50-49. Merritt's Gipson continued to hit from
the outside as the lead shifted from team to
team and it wasn't until Moroski poured in
nine points in the last two minutes of the
game that Stanford cinched the victory.
Moroski's 27 points were followed by
Schweitzer's 17. The win improved Stanford's
record to 7-6.
