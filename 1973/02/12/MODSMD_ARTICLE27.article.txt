## 
### MIKE CHASSON 
Stanford won both relays, but
Southern California overwhelmed
the Cards in the individual events
to record a 62 1 /2-50 1 /2 victory at
the Encina Pools Saturday.
The Cards opened with a win
in the 400 medley relay with the
team of Randy Whitchurch, John
Heneken, Rick Longinotti, and
Martin Pedley posting an easy
four second victory.
The Trojans' depth then went
to work with Jim McConica and
Tom Mcßreen coasting to a
one-two finish over Cardinal Terry
Sutton in the 1000 freestyle.
Sutton has now faced six of the
ten fastest distance swimmers in
the country in dual meets this
season.
The results were much the
same in the 200 freestyle where
the USC pair of Jack Tingley and
Benjt Gingsjo finished first and
second with Richard Cook of
Stanford third.
The Cards were hoping for a
one-two finish in the 50 free but
were only able to get first and a

tie for third. The race provided a
pleasant surprise, however, as
frosh Bruce Goodwin recorded a
lifetime best of 21.4 in winning
the event. Bruce Kocsis of USC
was second with Stanford's Dean
Anderson tying Trojan Kim Tutt
for third.
USC Pulls Away
USC started to pull away with
one-two finishes in the 200 IM
and 200 butterfly, and a first
place in the one-meter diving. In
the IM Steve Fumiss and Dave
Hannuila finished first and second
with Cardinal John Hencken a
close third.
Two USC freshmen, Alan
Poucher and Andy Lehner, went
one-two in the butterfly with
Sutton third. Stanford was hoping
for a first and second in the
one-meter diving but the Trojans
came through with a first and
third, with Rich Rector getting
second for the Cards.
The sprinters came through
once again in the 100 freestyle as
Anderson won it in 47.2, with
Goodwin second in 47.5 and Tutt
inr irar inr ipic

third for USC in the same time.
Goodwin's time was another
lifetime best, indicating he could
be a scorer for the Cards come the
NCAA Championships.

USC clinched the meet
following one-two finishes in the
200 backstroke and 500 freestyle.
Tingley became the meet's only
double winner with a first in the

200 back it was Kocsis and
Fumiss sweeping the event for the
Trojans with Whitchurch third.

second for the Cards.
The sprinters came through
once again in the 100 freestyle as
Anderson won it in 47.2, with
Goodwin second in 47.5 and Tutt
inr irar inr ipic

third for USC in the same time.
Goodwin's time was another
lifetime best, indicating he could
be a scorer for the Cards come the
NCAA Championships.
Tingley Double Winner
USC clinched the meet
following one-two finishes in the
200 backstroke and 500 freestyle.
Tingley became the meet's only
double winner with a first in the
500, with Gingsjo second and Paul
Clark of Stanford third. In the
200 back it was Kocsis and
Fumiss sweeping the event for the
Trojans with Whitchurch third.
The Cards captured the 200
breastroke as Brian Job and
Hencken continued their strangle
hold on the event. Job recorded a
2.06.6 to Hencken's 2.07.0 with
USC's Gary Willis third in 2.15.5.
Stanford won both relays, but
Southern California overwhelmed
the Cards in the individual events
to record a 62 1 /2-50 1 /2 victory at
the Encina Pools Saturday.
The Cards opened with a win
in the 400 medley relay with the
team of Randy Whitchurch, John
Heneken, Rick Longinotti, and
Martin Pedley posting an easy
four second victory.
The Trojans' depth then went
to work with Jim McConica and
Tom Mcßreen coasting to a
one-two finish over Cardinal Terry
Sutton in the 1000 freestyle.
Sutton has now faced six of the
ten fastest distance swimmers in
the country in dual meets this
season.
The results were much the
same in the 200 freestyle where
the USC pair of Jack Tingley and
Benjt Gingsjo finished first and
second with Richard Cook of
Stanford third.
The Cards were hoping for a
one-two finish in the 50 free but
were only able to get first and a

tie for third. The race provided a
pleasant surprise, however, as
frosh Bruce Goodwin recorded a
lifetime best of 21.4 in winning
the event. Bruce Kocsis of USC
was second with Stanford's Dean
Anderson tying Trojan Kim Tutt
for third.
USC Pulls Away
USC started to pull away with
one-two finishes in the 200 IM
and 200 butterfly, and a first
place in the one-meter diving. In
the IM Steve Fumiss and Dave
Hannuila finished first and second
with Cardinal John Hencken a
close third.
Two USC freshmen, Alan
Poucher and Andy Lehner, went
one-two in the butterfly with
Sutton third. Stanford was hoping
for a first and second in the
one-meter diving but the Trojans
came through with a first and
third, with Rich Rector getting
second for the Cards.
The sprinters came through

Anderson won it in 47.2, with
