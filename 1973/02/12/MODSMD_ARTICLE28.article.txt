### VLAE KERSHNER 
Stanford's wrestling team split a double-dual meet Friday night,
losing to undefeated Humboldt State 36-5 but defeating Sonoma
State 24-i4.
The Cardinals, now 4-6 on the year, will close out their home
schedule tomorrow night against San Francisco State at Encina Gym
in a match beginning at 7:30 p.m.
Stanford was able to win only one match against the 16-0
Humboldt State team, which hosted the meet. That victory came
from Ken Krebs at 142. The only other points for Stanford, wrestling
without Chris Horpel, came in a 1-1 draw by Bob Sweetman at 126.

Things went quite a bit better
against Sonoma State. In addition
to a second win by Krebs, Allen
Axworthy (118), Danny Mueller
(134), Emmett Stanton (158),
John Govea (177), and Mark
Frelier (190), all won their
matches.
The split in this meet followed
a 25-15 loss to Fresno State
Tuesday, an event which the host
team won by skillful rearranging
of its best competitors, for
example, moving a 150 pounder
up to 158 and simply forfeiting to
Horpel.
The Cardinals have been
ranked seventh among University
division teams in the state of
California. "We're ahead of all the
schools that have the same-sized
programs as us," said Coach Joe
DeMeo. 'The schools we've been
losing to are the ones that give a
large number of scholarships,
teams that are in the top 20 in the
nation like Nebraska and
Berkeley."
While thus far this year Horpel,
Sweet man, and Krebs have been
winning most of the accolades,
Govea, with two pins in the last
week, and Stanton, among others,
have also been wrestling well
recently.
