to be called after five innings.

extinguish Stanford's hot bats
however. The Cards raked the
Phils for 12 runs on 11 hits,
demolishing an allegedly
professional team, 12-1.

three-for-three, and Mike Nelson,
Bob Hampton and Max Goldstein
all went two-for-two. A 1 O'Brien
also nailed two hits.

up one run on just two hits in his
three inning appearance. A 1
Arthur pitched two perfect
innings until the rains came„
Hoping to find foul weather
shelter in the East Bay, the Cards
