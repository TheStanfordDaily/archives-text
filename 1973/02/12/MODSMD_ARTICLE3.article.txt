# Former Pentagon Aide May Join GSB Faculty
## 
### BILL EVERS News Analysis 
Tomonow, the board of trustees of
the University is expected to approve
the appointment of Alain C.
Enthoven, the head of the Pentagon's
systems analysis office under Defense
Secretaries Robert S. McNamara and
Clark Clifford, to the faculty of the
Graduate School of Business.
Enthoven will be given a tenured
position as professor of business and
public policy, as of September 1,
1973. He is at present a vice-president
of Litton Industries and president of
its subsidiary Litton Medical Products.
At Stanford, Enthoven will be part
of the business school's new program
designed to provide trained managerial
talent for the government. This
program has been instituted under the
leadership of Dean Arjay Miller.
4 A Great Coup'
Henry S. Rowen, former president
of the RAND Corporation, and now
professor of public management at the
business school, told the Daily that
obtaining Enthoven for Stanford was
"a great coup." Rowen described
Enthoven as "an excellent economist"
and said he was "wildly enthusiastic"
about Enthoven's appointment.
Enthoven's major achievement in
the Department of Defense was
building for McNamara a staff of
civilian experts on military matters
that could supply McNamara with
independent information. McNamara
wanted to have his own experts who
were not tied to the Joint Chiefs of
Staff and who were not predominantly
career military men.

Enthoven was one of several
important people from the RAND
Corporation that McNamara brought
to the Pentagon. Another man from
the same think-tank was Charles Hitch,
now president of the University of
California. Hitch was Comptroller;
Enthoven eventually was Assistant
Secretary of Defense for Systems
Analysis.
These analysts were authorized by
McNamara to implement reforms in
the Pentagon's budgetary and planning
process. In essence, they tried to apply
cost-benefit techniques, in Enthoven's
words, to "foreign policy, military
strategy, defense budgets, and the
choice of major weapons and forces."
McNamara's reforms received harsh
criticism from career military men and
their allies in Congress.
Enthoven's systems analysis office
was indirectly rather than directly
related to the Vietnam war. According
to Townsend Hoopes, former
Undersecretary of the Air Force, it
"had remained curiously on the outer
edges of Vietnam policy."
Author David Halberstam, in
describing McNamara's handling of the
war, notes that McNamara relied less
on independent information from "his
own civilians loyal to him and their
craft" on Vietnam than he did on
other policy matters.
Enthoven himself supported the
basic American military policy in
Vietnam until the Tet offensive of the
North Vietnamese and the NLF in
February 1968, according to Hoopes.
However, Enthoven remained in
office.

In his book How Much Is Enough?,
Enthoven includes an account of the
contributions of the systems analysis
approach to U.S. activity in Vietnam.
Readiness Evaluated
First of all, Enthoven contends that
systems analysis resulted in the U.S.
military being better balanced and in a
better state of readiness than at the
beginning of any other war in U.S.
history.
Then, when troop increases were
desired for the U.S. military build-up
in Vietnam, systems analysis helped
make it possible to plan them
efficiently. "A Vietnam deployment
planning system was added to
coordinate the force planning,
budgeting, personnel planning, and
procurement associated with the
Vietnam operation. Thus, when the
Secretary of Defense wanted to add
another division to the Army,
[systems analysis] helped determine
what should be added to the financial
plan, the manpower plan, the
procurement plan, and the like in a
more balanced and coordinated way."
Also a systems analysis approach to
financial planning during the Vietnam
build-up meant, according to
Enthoven, that requested
appropriations and actual expenditures
were linked in an orderly, systematic
way. He contrasts this with the chaotic
military finances during the first two
years of the Korean War.
The work of Enthoven's own
systems analysis office after June 1965
on the Vietnam war "consisted of (1)
developing and maintaining a single,
authoritative plan for manpower,
logistics, procurement, and financial
planning; (2) developing a model for
estimating aircraft attrition; and (3)
attempting to stimulate analysis by
making pilot studies of various aspects
of the war ... All these items were
aimed at improving the management
of the war effort."
After leaving the Pentagon in 1969,
Enthoven went to work in the health
industry for a subsidiary of Litton.
According to Professor Rowen,
Enthoven combines an academic
expertise in economics, business
policy-making experience with Litton,
and government policy-making
experience with the Defense
Department, together with a practical
and a research interest in the delivery
of health services. Enthoven will do
work at Stanford in all these areas and
will participate in the new graduate
program in health services
administration, which is a joint
venture of the medical school and the
business school.
