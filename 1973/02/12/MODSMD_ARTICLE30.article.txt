New Financial Crisis Imminent
BONN -- Major foreign exchange markets were closed
today to give government leaders time to counter rampant
speculation in the U.S. dollar.
West Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Japan all
ordered their foreign money markets closed. There were
reports that a major monetary conference would be held
soon.
A number of smaller nations also announced closure of
their foreign exchange markets.
A private emergency meeting of finance ministers from
France, Britain, Germany and Italy was held late
yesterday at the Paris home of the French finance
minister, Valery Giscard d'Estaing. U.S. Treasury
Undersecretary Paul Volcker joined the talks later.
There was no official word on what was discussed, but
it was evident frantic efforts were being made to repair
the monetary structure, which has seen a massive selling
of U.S. dollars in the past two weeks.
West Germany, hardest hit by the dollar selling,
declared yesterday that it was sticking to its previous
monetary coursc of rejecting unilateral upward
revaluation of the mark. The West German central bank
bought up $6 billion worth of dollars last week to support
the U.S. currency at its floor level.
Pressure intensified on Japan to revalue its yen upward
and take other steps Washington wants within 90 days to
help America get its trade balance out of the red.
William Eberle, President Nixon's trade ambassador,
was reported to have left Tokyo for Washington after
warning the Japanese of possible unilateral U.S. actions
such as an import surcharge, unless Tokyo helps American
goods get freer access to Japanese markets.
Kiichi Aichi, Japan's finance minister, announced that
the Tokyo exchange would stay closed for a second day
today, but said he hoped it could reopen tomorrow. It
was ordered shut Saturday to prevent "unpredictable
confusion," Japanese authorities said.
Speculators betting that Japan will have to revalue and
that Germany will then follow suit, have dumped $10
billion on world exchanges in the past two weeks — $3.5
billion Thursday and Friday in Germany alone.
Recovery Under Way In N.Y. Blast
NEW YORK — The rubble-covered pit of a gas storage
tank on Staten Island yielded yesterday the bodies of 26
out of the 40 men presumed lost when the cone-shaped
structure blew up. Firemen put up powerful floodlights
on the rim of the giant tank to continue their search
through the night.
The bodies were hidden under chunks of the concrete
roof that blew off and collapsed Saturday afternoon.
Those recovered were so blast-and fire-charred that only a
few were likely to be identified visually.
As the pine boxes containing the bodies were lifted out
of the 10-story tank by cranes, a man who watched the
operation from the soot-blackened rim of the tank
reported:
"The bodies are in pieces. They were so charred they
just fell apart when the firemen touched them."
One fire official said that most of the men were found
with their hands in front of their faces, apparently in a
last-ditch effort to shield them from the searing heat.
Preliminary autopsies indicated the men died of smoke
inhalation, the medical examiner's office said.
The other workmen were presumed buried beneath
tons of concrete when the dome-like tank lid — as big as a
football field — lifted with a hissing sound on a ring of fire
and collapsed shortly after 1 p.m. Saturday. The cause of
the blast was still undetermined.
Some of the relatives of victims complained about an

alleged lack of safety precautions, but several men who
worked on the tank said they were satisfied.
"Texas Eastern went overboard on safety," said crane
operator Robert Garraputa, 31. "They are fanatical about
safety. If there was a hint of a gas leak, nobody went
inside."
"The thing was safe or I never would have gone into it
or on top of it," said Bill Williams, a welder. He was
outside in a welding shed when the blast came.
Albert Irate Over Budget Cuts
WASHINGTON — House Speaker Carl Albert summoned
Congress to the battle of the budget yesterday with the
charge that President Nixon has acted callously and
irresponsibly in some of the cuts he has ordered.
In a nationwide radio broadcast responding to Nixon's
Jan. 28 budget speech, Albert said the
administration-proposed cuts would hurt the poor, the
elderly, the sick and the unemployed.
"Congress will not tolerate the callous attitude of an
administration that seems to have no compassion for the
down-and-out citizens of this country," the Oklahoma
Democrat said.
Congress shares Nixon's opposition to wasteful,
inefficient government spending, Albert said, and would
go along with several of the cuts the President is
requesting.
"However," he added, "We cannot support a wholesale
effort to scrap worthwhile programs that have given hope
and promise to so many Americans."
The speaker said Nixon's budget would slam the door
on hospital and health-clinic construction, federal aid to
education and libraries, water and waste-disposal grants
and reduce veterans' benefits, Medicare and scores of
other programs.
"During the four years that Richard Nixon has been
president, his budgets have increased almost 40 percent,
from $195 billion to $269 billion — the largest four-year
increase in American history," Albert said. "That budget
bulge would have been even more had not Congress cut
the President's budget requests by more than $20 billion
during the past four years."
Albert also criticized Nixon for failing to deal with tax
reform or relief from property taxes in his budget
message.
Hussein Optimistic For Accord
NEW YORK — King Hussein of Jordan said yesterday he
was optimistic about chances for a Middle East settlement
because of "new interest" by nations of the world in
achieving global peace.
"I am more optimistic at this stage than any other. I
believe there is a chance," said Hussein, in a televised
interview from Washington where he met last week with
President Nixon.
Hussein also said that while Jordan would seek to
modernize its military force, "we do not wish to have a
more sizeable force."
He would not say whether the issue of U.S. military
assistance came up in his talks with Nixon, commenting
only that "we always are in touch with our friends
here ... regarding our plans."
He said the United States had played a major role in
creating a mood for world peace and he predicted "our
turn will come" to settle tensions in the Middle East.
