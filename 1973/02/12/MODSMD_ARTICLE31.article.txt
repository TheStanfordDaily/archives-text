# Lecturer Policy Changes Asked
## 
### ANNE COFFEY 
The position of lecturers and
part-time faculty is the focal point of
proposals submitted by the University
Women's Caucus to the Senate Faculty
Committee on the Professoriate. The
proposals recommend changes in
Stanford's policy towards lecturers
regarding job security, promotion,
sabbatical leave, travel funds, salary,
benefits, and research grants.
The recommendations, first
developed by a group of lecturers in
the Department of French and Italian,
were approved by the Women's Caucus
on Feb. 1.
The proposals provide for:
— a series of contracts, awarded
consecutively for one, two, three, and
five years. Notification of renewal or
termination would be made by Dec.
15 of the last year of the contract;
— a more flexible distinction
between the positions of lecturer and
full-time faculty members, so that a
regular faculty member could step off
the tenure ladder to apply for a
lecturership, and a lecturer could
apply for any regular faculty position
without preference to his or her
current position;
— sabbatical leave and travel funds
for lecturers on the same terms as
regular faculty members;
— publication of lecturers' salaries
and definition of a full-time teaching

load by each department, to assure
salaries commensurate with teaching
loads;
— proportional benefits extended
to part-time faculty, rather than only
to those who work at least
three-fourths time, as is now the case;
and
— lecturers' right to apply as
principal investigators for both
in-house and externally funded
research grants.
"I can't speak for the other
members of the committee, but I
know I'm sympathetic," said John
Bender, assistant English professor and
member of the Faculty Senate
Committee on the Professoriate. "I
believe that all of these points raised
have been considered by the discussion
committee," he said.
The Professoriate Committee
chairman, Biology Prof. Colin
Pittendrigh, was out of town and
unavailable for comment.
"We've made moves in some of
these directions already," said Provost
William Miller, an ex officio member
of the Committee on the Professoriate.
"It is the goal of committee chairman
Pittendrigh to get a report to the floor
of the Senate within this school year.
It is then up to the Senate to present a
recommendation to the President. This
is a question of employment, so
ultimately it will be up to the

President to act."
Currently, lecturers, most of whom
are women, receive only yearly
contracts, and they claim that they are
underpaid and overworked. Many
women faculty work only part-time
during child-rearing years, and fringe
benefits are not available for those
working less than three-fourths time.
"Obviously, this [current policy] is
a convenience position for the
University," said lecturer Ellen Nold,
director of the Undergraduate Writing
Program and member of the Women's
Caucus.
