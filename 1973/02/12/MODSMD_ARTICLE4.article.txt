# Stanford Studies Nixon Plan
## Officials Fear Budget Slashes 
### JANET SANDERS 
President Nixon's proposed budget of $268.7 billion
submitted to Congress last week will have a great impact
on the University if it is passed, said Frank Newman,
Director of University Relations.
The budget calls for the phasing out of training grants
to the Medical School, federal aid to area studies and
language training, and institutional grants. Funds for
SLAC and graduate fellowships would be severely
reduced.
In the area of student aid, National Student Direct
Loans (NSDL) and Supplementary Opportunity Grants
(SOG) would be completely eliminated. The Work-Study
program would be phased out.
"We are particularly concerned with the declining
number of federally funded graduate fellowships
available," said Newman. This year, 400 fellowships were
awarded, a sharp decrease from approximately 1225
fellowships awarded four years ago.

'The budget proposal merely confirms what is already
happening," said Karlene Dickey, Assistant Dean of the
Graduate Division. She surmised that about 350
fellowships will be available next year.
Another area of concern is undergraduate student aid
which would undergo major revisions in Nixon's proposal.
"Although the President is proposing a $100 million
increase over last year, we are uncomfortable about where
the money is being put," said Robert Huff, Director of
Financial Aids.
Nixon proposed a completely new program of Basic
Opportunity Grants (BOG) to replace the Supplementary
Opportunity Grants. But Huff noted several problems in
the proposal.
"BOG is certainly underfunded," Huff said. Nixon's
estimated program cost of $622 million falls far short of
the most conservative estimate of $1.2 billion made by
the Brookings Institution.

with television coverage of December's Clay Whitehead speech criticizing
newsmen for "idealogical plugola."
"It is also very late," added Huff. "There will be great
difficulty in implementing it in time for the next
academic year."
Because of these problems, Huff expressed confidence
that Congress would insist on funding the programs of
SOG, NSDL and Work-Study, at least until BOG is firmly
established. "I foresee quite a struggle between the Nixon
Administration and the Congress on this point," he said.
However, "No student will be severely affected if SOG
is not continued," he said. "Practically everyone who is
now receiving SOG aid will qualify for BOG help."
Big Impact
'The biggest impact on student aid will be on our loan
program based on NSDL," Huff said. "Without the federal
funds for next year, the loan program will be operating
with only half of its need supplied."
Huff added that the President's proposal transfers the
funds from the NSDL to the federally-insured loan
program where banks supply the money. Although the
interest rate will be 4 I A percent higher than NSDL rates
and the student may be inconvenienced somewhat, "I
don't think this shift will directly affect the amount of
money the student gets," he said.

According to Robert Freelen, Assistant Director of
University Relations, the elimination of financial support
for area studies and language training will have a grave
effect on the two University centers on East Asian Studies
and Latin America Studies. "Although these two
programs will not be completely wiped out, they will be
greatly reduced in scope," Freelen said.
Fund Loss Predicted
Freelen also explained that the University will lose
federal funds if the institutional grants are phased out as
proposed. Reductions in federal aid to SLAC will result in
a layoff of 80 employees effective June 30, and training
grants to the Medical School will be phased out.
Both Freelen and Newman expressed hope that
proposed cuts to some important University programs will
be made up by funds obtained through other programs.
The budget for Research Applied to National Needs
(RANN) would be increased 13 percent, and Stanford, as
a major recipient of RANN's research grants, "might get
some additional money from there," Freelen said.
Freelen also noted that fund increases for Cancer and
Heart Research, the Department of Interior, and the
National Institute of Education will provide additional
sources of money.

sources of money.
President Nixon's proposed budget of $268.7 billion
submitted to Congress last week will have a great impact
on the University if it is passed, said Frank Newman,
Director of University Relations.
The budget calls for the phasing out of training grants
to the Medical School, federal aid to area studies and
language training, and institutional grants. Funds for
SLAC and graduate fellowships would be severely
reduced.
In the area of student aid, National Student Direct
Loans (NSDL) and Supplementary Opportunity Grants
(SOG) would be completely eliminated. The Work-Study
program would be phased out.
"We are particularly concerned with the declining
number of federally funded graduate fellowships
available," said Newman. This year, 400 fellowships were
awarded, a sharp decrease from approximately 1225
fellowships awarded four years ago.

'The budget proposal merely confirms what is already
happening," said Karlene Dickey, Assistant Dean of the
Graduate Division. She surmised that about 350
fellowships will be available next year.
Another area of concern is undergraduate student aid
which would undergo major revisions in Nixon's proposal.
"Although the President is proposing a $100 million
increase over last year, we are uncomfortable about where
the money is being put," said Robert Huff, Director of
Financial Aids.
Nixon proposed a completely new program of Basic
Opportunity Grants (BOG) to replace the Supplementary
Opportunity Grants. But Huff noted several problems in
the proposal.
"BOG is certainly underfunded," Huff said. Nixon's
estimated program cost of $622 million falls far short of
the most conservative estimate of $1.2 billion made by
the Brookings Institution.

with television coverage of December's Clay Whitehead speech criticizing
newsmen for "idealogical plugola."
"It is also very late," added Huff. "There will be great
difficulty in implementing it in time for the next
academic year."
Because of these problems, Huff expressed confidence
that Congress would insist on funding the programs of
SOG, NSDL and Work-Study, at least until BOG is firmly
established. "I foresee quite a struggle between the Nixon
Administration and the Congress on this point," he said.
However, "No student will be severely affected if SOG
is not continued," he said. "Practically everyone who is
now receiving SOG aid will qualify for BOG help."
Big Impact
'The biggest impact on student aid will be on our loan
program based on NSDL," Huff said. "Without the federal
funds for next year, the loan program will be operating
with only half of its need supplied."
Huff added that the President's proposal transfers the
funds from the NSDL to the federally-insured loan
program where banks supply the money. Although the
interest rate will be 4 I A percent higher than NSDL rates
and the student may be inconvenienced somewhat, "I
don't think this shift will directly affect the amount of
money the student gets," he said.

According to Robert Freelen, Assistant Director of
University Relations, the elimination of financial support
for area studies and language training will have a grave
effect on the two University centers on East Asian Studies
and Latin America Studies. "Although these two
programs will not be completely wiped out, they will be
greatly reduced in scope," Freelen said.
Fund Loss Predicted
Freelen also explained that the University will lose
federal funds if the institutional grants are phased out as
proposed. Reductions in federal aid to SLAC will result in
a layoff of 80 employees effective June 30, and training
grants to the Medical School will be phased out.
Both Freelen and Newman expressed hope that
proposed cuts to some important University programs will
be made up by funds obtained through other programs.
The budget for Research Applied to National Needs
(RANN) would be increased 13 percent, and Stanford, as
a major recipient of RANN's research grants, "might get
some additional money from there," Freelen said.
Freelen also noted that fund increases for Cancer and
Heart Research, the Department of Interior, and the
National Institute of Education will provide additional
sources of money.
