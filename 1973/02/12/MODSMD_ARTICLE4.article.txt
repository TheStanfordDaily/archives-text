## Officials Fear Budget Slashes

President Nixon's proposed budget of $268.7 billion
submitted to Congress last week will have a great impact
on the University if it is passed, said Frank Newman,
Director of University Relations.
The budget calls for the phasing out of training grants
to the Medical School, federal aid to area studies and
language training, and institutional grants. Funds for
SLAC and graduate fellowships would be severely
reduced.
In the area of student aid, National Student Direct
Loans (NSDL) and Supplementary Opportunity Grants
(SOG) would be completely eliminated. The Work-Study
program would be phased out.
"We are particularly concerned with the declining
number of federally funded graduate fellowships
available," said Newman. This year, 400 fellowships were
awarded, a sharp decrease from approximately 1225
fellowships awarded four years ago.

'The budget proposal merely confirms what is already
happening," said Karlene Dickey, Assistant Dean of the
Graduate Division. She surmised that about 350
fellowships will be available next year.
Another area of concern is undergraduate student aid
which would undergo major revisions in Nixon's proposal.
"Although the President is proposing a $100 million
increase over last year, we are uncomfortable about where
the money is being put," said Robert Huff, Director of
Financial Aids.
Nixon proposed a completely new program of Basic
Opportunity Grants (BOG) to replace the Supplementary
Opportunity Grants. But Huff noted several problems in
the proposal.
"BOG is certainly underfunded," Huff said. Nixon's
estimated program cost of $622 million falls far short of
the most conservative estimate of $1.2 billion made by
the Brookings Institution.
