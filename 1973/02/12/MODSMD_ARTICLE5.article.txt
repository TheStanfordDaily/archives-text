# Prof Blasts TV News Reporting
## 
### GLENN GARVIN 
When Clay Whitehead, director of
the White House Office of
Telecommunications Policy (OTP),
gave a speech last December blasting
television newsmen for "idealogical
plugola," Economics Prof. Bruce
Owen was unhappy.
He wasn't unhappy with the
speech, but with the way television
covered it. "Walter Cronkite reported
that speech in the same tone he
reports major air disasters," Owen
says.
His reaction isn't really too
surprising; Owen helped write the
now-famous — or infamous —
Whitehead speech that created such a
furor in broadcast circles. At the time
he was the chief economist in the
OTP.
Owen just returned to Stanford
from two and a half years with the
White House, and he has some pointed
words for the media.
Biased News
"I personally believe network news,
on the whole, is biased to the left ... I
admit I can't prove it. I'm not sure it
can be proved, but I still believe it is
biased."
The speech covered two points:

— it announced the Nixon
administration was proposing a bill
extending the length of broadcasting
licenses from three years to five, and
making it easier to renew the licenses;
and
— it pointed out to local television
stations that they were responsible for
the content of network newscasts.
Network Support
"It didn't make the news that two
networks supported the bill [proposed
in the Whitehead speech]. I think it
was typical," Owen complains.
He also thinks the speech has been
misunderstood. "It was an attack on
democracy in the newsroom," Owen
explains. "Whitehead reminded
broadcasters of a long-standing FCC
rule that station managers have the
responsibility for programming, and
they cannot delegate that
responsibility to anyone else.
"It emphasized the fact that
newsmen, like everybody else, have
biases. There is nothing in the
Constitution or the Communications
Act of 1934 [which set up the FCC|
which gives newsmen as such any
particular rights. Rights — and
responsibilities — belong to the
newspaper or television station itself."

"[Whitehead] was saying local
stations are to be held responsible to
their communities - not the
government — at license time, and that
responsibility is not fulfilled by
broadcasting anything the network
hands out."
Owen denies that the Whitehead
speech was part of a government
attempt to cripple or destroy the news
media. "It's no secret the
Administration is unhappy with the
performance and bias in some of the
media. It comes through in the speech,
to a certain extent. But it was not an
attempt to take over the media," he
says.
He claims, rather, that the speech
was aimed at balancing excessive
power in the broadcast industry.
"Networks exert power in the way
they influence the public, the way
they influence events, and so on.
Private concentration of power [in the
media] is just as bad as government
control of media," Owen points out.
Control Methods
"The traditional control on private
power is to regulate it. There is
another way, consistent with the First
Amendment: that is, reduce the
power. One way to do this is to have

individual licensees be accountable for
programming," Owen says. He
maintains that making television
stations responsible to their
communities decreases the role of
government, rather than increasing it.
Owen points out that the speech
didn't necessarily insist that stations
schedule conservative newscasters.
"The broadcaster is responsible for
representing — fairly — conflicting
views according to the needs of his
local community. Maybe his local
community is made up of liberals and
that's all they want to hear. Whitehead
didn't say all the bias was liberal."
Some news executives have
criticized the Whitehead speech on the
grounds that they really have no way
of verifying a network story that
originates in Washington or some other
distant spot.
"Obviously this can't be carried out
on a case by case basis," Owen
concedes. "It has to be broader than
that. It involves bias in such things as
the choice of what stories are
reported, in what depth, to what
length. It involves the whole question
of news judgement, of news
management.
"As a practical matter, there is no
way to check the validity of every
single story. All the station can do is
look at the overall effect of the news.
If it's biased, if it's detrimental to the
community, the station is responsible
for balancing it.
"You can argue, perhaps with some
validity, that if all media were
conservative, this might not have
happened. I hope this isn't true. I
don't think it matters what the bias is,
liberal or conservative."
Nevertheless, Owen is glad the
outcry over the Whitehead speech
arose. "Reporters, with good reason,
are sensitive to what the government
says about them. The existence of a
hue and cry is healthy," he says.
Owen is still a consultant to the
OTP, but he says he's happy to be
back at Stanford and devoting most of
his time to teaching. "I'm basically an
academic," he says,"and it didn't
change me."
