## Empty Pockets 
### 
Many people expected the end of U.S. involvement in
Vietnam to signal a turning point in our history. Now
should be the time to reorder priorities and channel the
nation's resources into social programs.
Two days after the signing of the Vietnam cease fire
agreement, however, President Nixon sent a budget to
Congress that called for an increase in the defense budget
and cutbacks in social, health, housing, education and
antipoverty programs.
It is inconceivable that at the end of the war there should
be even less funds available to fight America's social ills.
The prospect that, in peacetime,the Defense Department will
increase its already swollen budget is even more galling.
Unless Congress can revise drastically confused priorities
in Nixon's budget, the nation will have an increasingly
difficult time helping Americans who cannot help
themselves.
Aside from the national problems that will be created by
the proposed budget, Stanford will face many hardships if it
is passed in its present form.
- Eighty employees at the Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center (SLAC) must be laid off due to a $750,000 cut in its
fiscal 1974 budget.
- Under the new budget, the Medical Center could lose
up to $3.4 million per year. National Institute of Health
grants which fund training programs at the Med Center will
be phased out over a three year period. General research
grant cuts for the area may amount to as much as 60
percent.
- Funded graduate fellowships will probably number
only 350 next year. This represents the continuation of a
trend which has reduced funded fellowships by over 75
percent during the past four years.
- The East Asian Studies and Latin American Studies
programs will suffer due to the elimination of funding for
area studies and language training.
- Although the budget allows for a $100 million increase
in undergraduate aid funding, National Direct Student Loan
program will be eliminated and its successor will impose
interest rates four and a half higher than NDSL.
Stanford will definitely feel the pinch of the new budget
as many worthy research and study programs will be cut
back and curtailed.
The funding cuts and resulting hardships come at a time
when there should be more money for the type of
contribution being made here.
We must now look to Congress to rearrange Nixon's
priorities and channel the nation's resources where they are
most needed.
