# What To Do
## When Not Studying 
### 
Daniel Brenner

By this time in winter quarter,
the mind has a tendency to drift,
to focus on anything but the maze
of words on the textbook page.
And there is no shortage of
things which students are likely to
do while sitting in Meyer Library
or in a dorm room and
"studying."
First, there is the constant
time-watch. People check clocks,
wrist watches, pendant
time-pieces, geodesic calendars,
and movements of the stars.
Time moves slowly when one is
watching it. "Well, if I took a
teensy-weensy break here, then
I'd be refreshed and could double
my output whence I returned,"
one considers.
After checking the clock, and
deciding that since the last break
was three minutes before, the
output argument dissolves, and
one returns to counting pages;
first page numbers, then "sides."
The distance between work and
freedom is computed as "sides."
Illustrations, white spaces, maps
(glorious maps!) become welcome
finds. Chapters become segments
of the evening, and the words,
"... which will be discussed in a
later chapter," brings sighs of
relief that an ordeal has been
delayed.
Ultimate Truth
Then come the words,
especially in math courses,
"... which go beyond the limits
of this course." These words
signal that the reader may further
accept a statement as truth
because the author says so.
After determining "sides" to
go, the student has exhausted the

possible delaying tactics with the
text, and so goes in search of
other distraction. For example,
when things become particularly
boring, pencils invariably find
themselves in need of sharpening.
Or one feels compelled to check
the edges of a hi-lighter to make
doubly sure it hasn'tdried out.
Pen caps keep teeth busy while
the rest of the body studies. One
of the outstanding features of Bic
Pens is their munchability factor.
After the cap has been nibbled to
bits, one can always try to go
after the plastic cork.
Puritanism
But there are other things
students can do besides
clock-watching, side-counting and
uncorking Bic Medium points.
One of the great things about
this university, in my opinion, is
the diversity of activities outside
of normal classwork which
students can take advantage of.
And yet, for many people, the
quarter has become a term of
Puritanical observance to
homework during the week, one
or two blow-outs on the weekend,
and then back to the grind.
Student apathy is predictable.
But it can't be justified, not when
there are so many people who
need the time and talents of this
community.
Those who say they can't
spend one or two hours a week
doing something constructive
beyond the obligations of course
work are either taking 36 units of
chemistry or aren't budgeting
time efficiently.
One Thing
One thing that everyone can do

is get involved in the letter writing
campaign at the Prison
Information Office (located in the
Old Firehouse). There isn't a
person on campus who hasn't felt
down when, after turning the dials
on their postbox, find only a
handbill with Mr. Zip reminding
about postbox rental.
There are thousands of
prisoners in California jails and
prisons who feel the same and
who want and need to establish
contact with someone
outside. All it takes is about an
hour and some concern.
In a time when schoolwork
seems to be sapping student
interest in anything else, it is
necessary to think about reaching
out to those who need
somebody's concern. Hard work is
important and worthwhile, but
there are better things to do than
watch the clock.
