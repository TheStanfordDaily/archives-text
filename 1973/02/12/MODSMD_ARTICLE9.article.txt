# A 						Reply To Abernethy
## Institutional Ethics Revisited 
### 
Robert R. Augsburger

(First of two parts.)
Professor Abernethy's two-part
essay on "The University and
Institutional Ethics" deserves a
response. Based upon the
principle of equal time, I also
intend to contribute a two-part
essay. This, the first, will be
devoted to a recitation of the
facts involved in processing
Professor Abernethy's proposal in
regard to anti-personnel weapons
and investment responsibility.
In April 1971, the Board of
Trustees adopted a Statement on
Investment Responsibility
developed by an ad hoc
committee composed of a faculty
member, representative trustees,
and a student. The Statement sets
forth certain guidelines which
must be met before consideration
will be given by the trustees to the
social aspects of investment

activities. I was subsequently
designated as the University
officer to facilitate
implementation of the policies,
and upon my recommendation a
Commission on Investment
Responsibility was created to
provide advice to me.
On May 15, 1972 Professor
Abernethy submitted a two-page
proposal to the Commission on
Investment Responsibility
requesting the Commission's
reaction to the following
proposals:
Proposals
1) The University should not
knowingly invest new funds in a
company that is a prime
contractor for the production of
anti-personnel weapons.
2) If University funds are
currently invested in such a
company, the appropriate
University officials should make
every effort to persuade company
officials to cancel the relevant
contracts and to state publicly
that no such contracts will be
accepted in the future. University
efforts should include a public
statement of intentions with
regard to the company in question
and may include letters, proxy
votes, and visitations from the
appropriate body (e.g. your
committee, or the Trustees'
Committee on Investments.)
3) If, after a certain length of
time — for example, three or four
months — it is reasonably clear to
the Vice President for Business
and Finance that the company is
not able or willing to change its
practices and general policies in
the very near future, the
University will commit itself to
dispose of the stock at the earliest
opportunity.
Commission Statement
On the same day the proposal
was received the Commission, by
unanimous action of the six
members present, voted the
following policy statement:
"That the University oppose
production, stock-piling or usage
of anti-personnel weapons such as
the cluster bomb, the flechette
bomb, napalm, etc., whose design,
purpose and/or effect is the
indiscriminate destruction of
non-military personnel or civilian
population."

The Commission also voted
that the University implement this
policy through the essential
elements of the Abernethy
proposal set forth above.
Deficiencies
I must say that I was troubled
upon receipt of this advice from
the Commission. I had heard no
debate within the University on
the specific issues involved; the
members of the Commission had
not, themselves, studied the
proposal in advance; nor was there
any indication of the nature of
the debate within the
Commission.
The Commission's advice did
not demonstrate that the proposal
met the Guidelines established in
the Statement on Investment
Responsibility. The definition of
"anti-personnel weapons" was too
loosely defined to permit
identification of when the policy
should apply. There was no
indication of which company, if
any, producing such
anti-personnel weapons were
currently held in the Stanford
portfolio. The proposal went
beyond the moral question and
asked for a strategy that included
public condemnation which might
be adverse to the University's
interests.
In view of the above
deficiencies, I met with Professor
Abernethy early in June and
advised him that I was not in a
position to act upon his
recommendations, while
remaining open to subsequent
consideration of the particular
issues.
Companies
In August I received a second
proposal from Professor
Abernethy, addressing itself to
most of the issues raised above.
In that second proposal he
identified Martin Marietta Corp.,
Sperry Rand Corp., and E. I.
duPont de Nemours & Co. as the
companies whose common stock
was currently held in the Stanford
portfolio and which were
producing anti-personnel
weapons, as defined. In
September, I forwarded copies of
Professor Abernethy's report to
officials of the three companies.
All three replied.
Martin Marietta advised that

hey had in fact held contracts for
he items reported in the
>roposal, but that this was a very
mall area of their business, that
n 1972 it was virtually zero, and
hat in 1973 it will probably be
he same.
Sperry Rand acknowledged
hat they were engaged in
fulfilling certain contracts which
vere considered objectionable in
;he proposal, that some of the
jrojects were no longer active,
ind that the facility which they
nanage for the U.S. Army is
mgaged in the production of
conventional weapons and not
;hose identified in the proposal,
rhey further pointed out that the
Corporation's defense and space
ausiness had declined from 52
percent to 18 percent of their
total volume and that large
numbers of engineers and
technicians formerly employed in
defense contract work were now
being phased into the
development of advanced
commercial and social systems
such as health testing, urban
traffic control, environmental
monitoring, and education.
Replies
DuPont replied that they do
not produce anti-personnel
weapons as defined; that their
involvement is limited to the
manufacture of non-electric
detonators, cord assembly, and
lead azide used by other firms in
the assembly of grenades, mines
and fuses; and that their total
sales of these items are less than
$1.5 million annually
(approximately 3/100 of 1
percent of the company's sales
volume).
The replies from these thret
companies, together with
Professor Abernethy's revised
proposal, were forwarded to the
Commission on Investment
Responsibility with the request
that they advise me whether the
proposal met the Guidelines ol
Investment Responsibility and il
so, how the University should
proceed.
The Commission acknowledged
the quality of the Abernethy
proposal and accepted the
essential background informatior
as correct. In addressing the issue
of whether the Guidelines were
met, the Commission was unabh
to arrive at any specific advice o:
recommendations to me. It shoulc
be noted that there were only five
members present, with on<
faculty, one alumnus, and twe
student members absent.
On the basis of the informatior
and advice available to me,
concluded that the Guidelines hat
not been met and that Professo
Abernethy's proposal should no
be presented to the Trustees
Committee on Investments fo
action.
