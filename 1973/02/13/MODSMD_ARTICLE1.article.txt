# Geologists Fear Effects Of Tremors
## Quake Could Quash Quad Quickly 
### TERRY ANZUR 
The buildings of the University are
wrecked, and the labor of
years. . . has been in a large measure
undone. Stanford . . . must once more
ascend the arduous hill of difficult
endeavor... It will take five or six
years at least before Stanford will be
as efficient and as well equipped as she
was before the earthquake.
This is a frank statement of the
condition of the University after the
great disaster.
—Editorial in the
Daily Palo Alto
April 21, 1906
When a massive earthquake (8.3 on
the Richter scale) shook the Bay Area
on April 18, 1906, the entrance gates
of the Farm collapsed, Memorial
Church fell into ruins, Memorial Arch
crumbled, and surprised students in
University residences were jolted out
of their beds. Stanford suffered such
extensive damage that University
President David Starr Jordan
suspended University work for the
semester, and granted full credit to all
students "in good standing."
No one can predict exactly when
the next earthquake will occur along
the San Andreas Fault, but there is
every reason to believe that fault
activity will continue as it has for
millions of years. And, the U.S.

Geological Survey reports, "Another
earthquake as strong as that of 1906
could happen at any time."
The recorded history of tremors on
the San Andreas Fault, a small sample
of data from which clear behavior
patterns can be determined, enables
scientists to predict the likelihood of
future quakes on a probability basis.
Bob Black, a planner for the
California Planning Research Center
(PRC) in Redwood City, says
earthquakes of near-8.3 magnitude
tend to occur between 75 and 300
years apart. Because the last tremor
occured in 1906, it is reasonable to
expect a similar-sized earthquake in
this area at any time after 1981.
Geology Prof. Ben Page explains,
"It isn't a question of whether or not
there will be an earthquake. Big fault
movements around the rim of the
Pacific (such as the 1964 Alaska
quake) are related to the motion of
the plates that cover the earth. We are
on or near a plate boundary."
Fault Boundary
That boundary, the San Andreas
Fault, cuts a one-half mile wide-path
through Portola Valley, less than four
and one-half miles from the center of
the Quad. Stanford's proximity to the
fault has caused concern about the
effects of the imminent Bay Area
quake on the University.

A report prepared for the federal
Office of Emergency Preparedness
(OEP) by the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)
reveals that a major earthquake could
kill up to 10,000 persons and injure as
many as 300,000 others in the Bay
Area.
This report, the standard guide for
earthquake disaster planning in nine
Bay Area counties, states, "A major
earthquake in the San Francisco Bay
Area will result in one of the greatest
disasters ever experienced in the
United States." It is probable that
Stanford will suffer damages in
proportion to losses throughout the
Bay Area.
Speculation Difficult
It is difficult to speculate on the
exact extent of damage here because
of variables involved in every
earthquake. Variations in magnitude,
duration, and intensity of the shock
determine the amount of damage to
buildings.
According to Page, the University
has attempted to design
"earthquake-proof" buildings for the
past several decades, although building
code standards continue to change as
more is learned about earthquakes.
The University consults experts on the
seismic design of buildings, but Page
notes that no building can be designed
to be 100 percent earthquake
resistant.
Civil Engineering Prof. Emeritus
James Wells, who was a teenager here
at the time of the 1906 quake and
who has prepared earthquake damage
estimates for Stanford since 1945, says
the recently renovated
Math/Psychology corner is the only
part of the Quad considered safe. He
estimates the cost of bringing the
entire Quad up to current building
code standards at $100 million.
Renovation Process
Page describes the renovation
process as "building a reinforced metal
or concrete structure inside the old
masonry." Some colonnades in
Memorial Court were reinforced with
steel girders after a University fund
drive, and Page expects improvements

to continue if more funds become
available.
Civil Engineering Prof. Haresh C.
Shah has explained that Hoover Tower
has a low "dampening factor." This
means the tower would sway
considerably during an earthquake,
but would continue to stand erect.
Memorial Church, which was
almost completely rebuilt after the
1906 quake at a cost of $400,000, still
has a temporary roof, Wells observes.
There is no way to determine the
effect of another earthquake on
MemChu until it actually occurs, he
comments.
Regarding the structural survival of
newer buildings on campus, Wells
states, "They conform to the code.
That's about as much as I can say for
them." He believes the existing codes
are not strict enough to guarantee
safety in a major earthquake.

ALL SHOOK UP — Memorial Church lay in ruins following the 1906 earthquake, which virtually destroyed much of the
campus. Geologists feel that a quake of similar size would do similarly great damage.
Wells estimates earthquake damage
to University structures would be $25
million. Because of the rising cost of
earthquake insurance in the
tremor-prone Bay Area, the University
terminated its damage insurance policy
in 1966.
Only two persons died here in the
1906 disaster. Human losses were
relatively light because the quake
occurred when most Bay Area
residents were asleep. If the next
earthquake strikes at mid-day or
during rush-hour, loss of life would be
extreme.
Those who witness the next quake
will first feel a sharp thud, followed
within a few seconds by a swaying or
rolling motion of the earth's crust. But
the pamphlet Safety and Survival in an
Earthquake, prepared by the OEP and
the U.S. Geological Survey states the
actual movement of the earth rarely
causes death or injury.
Causes Of Injuries
The leaflet reveals most injuries are
caused by six types of events, all of
which would occur on campus during
a quake:
— Partial building collapses such as
toppling walls, ornamental masonry,
ceilings, and light fixtures, particularly

in older buildings, and most of the
Quad.
— Flying glass from broken
windows (this danger is most evident
in more modern structures such as the
Earth Sciences Building), and flying
tiles from rooftops (most structures at
Stanford have Spanish tile roofs).
— Overturned bookcases and
furniture. (A study commissioned by
the University last spring reported that
the Main Library stacks were
particularly unsafe.
— Fires from broken chimneys and
gas lines (The NOAA study indicated
the danger will be increased by a lack
of water due to broken mains, and
that fire departments will be unable to
reach fires because of road damage.
University Fire Department Chief
Frank Jurian says no specific plans
have been made to deal with fires here
after an earthquake).
— Fallen power lines. (Should the
earthquake occur at night, blackouts
would add to confusion.)
— Drastic human actions resulting
from panic. (The OEP advises
earthquake victims to keep calm,
remain where they are, and seek refuge
away from outside doors and
windows, preferably underneath a
desk or table, or outdoors in an open
space.
