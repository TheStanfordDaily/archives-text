# A 						Reply To Abernethy
## Institutional Ethics Revisited 
### 
m Robert R. Augsburger

(Second of two parts.)
This second essay deals with
9ome of the philosophical issues
raised by Professor Abernethy's
essays on 'The University and
Institutional Ethics." He takes the
position that the investment
linkage between universities and
major corporations merits
increased future attention.
He presents four reasons for his
position. I will attempt to address
each of these.
(1) "The investment linkage is
substantial; Stanford, for
example, now holds over $130
million in merged fund stocks (the
correct amount is $65 million)
and almost $100 million in yield
and gain pool stocks." I recognize
that that sounds like big money to
all of us, save perhaps Howard
Hughes, but in the scheme of

things it just isn't very substantial.
Stanford owns 5/100 of 1% of the
du Pont Company; 2/10 of l%of
Martin Marietta; and 1/10 of 1%
of Sperry Rand.
Corporate Responsibility
While officials of these
companies might politely listen to
what we have to say as a
stockholder (and they probably
have other stockholders saying just
the opposite), their proper
responsibility to all their
stockholders is to make a profit
within the limits of what society
has prescribed for them.
Stanford's communications can,
at best, function only as an
early-warning signal that perhaps a
society might be reevaluating its
limits.
(2) "The investment linkage is
stable." Hopefully, the University
will always be an investor, but not
necessarily in the same companies.
Portfolio management is a fluid
process.
(3) "Changes in the
University's investment policy
need not pose the threat to core
values that changes in its research
or recruitment policy would
entail." This, of course, is the
crux of the issue. Professor
A bernethy presumes that
neither the faculty nor the
students need bread to survive.
Reality
But students might consider
that without financial support
from donors and the Federal
government, they would now be
paying $5,700 a year in tuition
rather than $2,850 and would be
attending classes under the oak
trees without either libraries or
laboratories. Faculty might
consider how they could pursue
their teaching and research
interests in the face of a
substantially reduced paycheck
and lack of physical and support
facilities. To assume that the core
values of the University are not
dependent upon financial support
from a variety of external sources
seems to me to be out of touch
with reality.
If the risk of loss of financial
support is not a sufficient
deterrent, there is perhaps a
greater—and more fundamental
risk—to our core values: Should
the University use its financial
resources to impose its will upon

other segments of society, what is
to prevent those segments from
using their financial resources to
impose their will upon the
University?
We . exist as an institution
because society values our
existence. If we collectively seek
to change society, we must be
prepared to have society
collectively seek to change us.
Governmental Responsibility
(4) "The decisions of American
corporations obviously have a
profound impact upon our
society." And so do our
governments—local, state, and
national, our school systems, our
universities, our churches, our
labor unions, etc. Regulation of
corporate activity in the public
interest is essentially . a
governmental, not a stockholder,
responsibility.
Where does this leave us, in a
moral wasteland? Not at all.
Where the actions of a
corporation—social, financial, or
otherwise—may have a direct
adverse effect upon the
University's investment interests,
the University should make, and
the Trustees' Committee on
Investments has made, its views
known to company management.
This has been particularly true in
issues involving composition of
the Board of Directors and those
involving disclosure of
information regarding minority
hiring, activities in southern
Africa, pollution control, etc.
Without regard to our
investment interests, we may take
action on social issues when the
three Guidelines in the Statement
on Investment Responsibility are
met. Professor Abernethy argues
that if they cannot be met in the
case of his proposal, they can
never be met. At the least, that
begs the question. At the most, I
would imagine the authors of that
Statement intended that there
would be very few cases in which
the Guidelines would be met,
precisely because there are very
few occasions which warrant the
University's speaking collectively
on economic, political, or social
issues. The fact that the test is
severe is no reason to reject it as a
test.
Guidelines Not Met
Based upon the advice

provided me by the Commission
on Investment Responsibility,
there is no evidence that these
Guidelines have been met:
(1) The acts of the companies
involved are not direct and
substantial. They are legitimately
in response to contracts placed by
the Federal government. If action
need be taken, it should be
through the governmental process.
(2) There is no evidence that
substantial consensus exists within
the University community of
faculty, students, and alumni. The
issue has not been widely debated
on campus or in campus
publications. Consensus, at best, is
difficult to determine—the more
so when in a vacuum.
Effect Unlikely
(3) The probable effects of the
action are not commensurate with
the economic costs. The use of
Stanford's stockholdings, by
whatever means, is not likely to
have any effect upon the
particular companies' willingness
to provide goods or services to the
Federal government, although
admittedly, it might relieve our
moral conscience. On the other
hand, such actions are likely to
cause alienation of some donors
who may not concur and could
also provoke retaliatory actions
by the Federal government. In
investment parlance, the potential
rewards simply aren't worth the
potential risks.
As one of many University
officers responsible for the
continuity of teaching and
research at Stanford, and having
to make a decision in this
instance, I have concluded that
there is no basis for collective
action on Professor Abernethy's
proposal.
While Professor Abernethy
may find this discouraging, I am
encouraged by what I see
happening. In my experience,
there are few other investing
institutions, i.e., banks, insurance
companies, mutual funds, where
even the process described earlier
could take place. That very
process, in and of itself, is healthy
and effective.

action are not commensurate with
the economic costs. The use of
Stanford's stockholdings, by
whatever means, is not likely to
have any effect upon the
particular companies' willingness
to provide goods or services to the
Federal government, although
admittedly, it might relieve our
moral conscience. On the other
hand, such actions are likely to
cause alienation of some donors
who may not concur and could
also provoke retaliatory actions
by the Federal government. In
investment parlance, the potential
rewards simply aren't worth the
potential risks.
As one of many University
officers responsible for the
continuity of teaching and
research at Stanford, and having
to make a decision in this
instance, I have concluded that
there is no basis for collective
action on Professor Abernethy's
proposal.
While Professor Abernethy
may find this discouraging, I am
encouraged by what I see
happening. In my experience,
there are few other investing
institutions, i.e., banks, insurance
companies, mutual funds, where
even the process described earlier
could take place. That very
process, in and of itself, is healthy
and effective.

This second essay deals with
9ome of the philosophical issues
raised by Professor Abernethy's
essays on 'The University and
Institutional Ethics." He takes the
position that the investment
linkage between universities and
major corporations merits
increased future attention.
He presents four reasons for his
position. I will attempt to address
each of these.
(1) "The investment linkage is
substantial; Stanford, for
example, now holds over $130
million in merged fund stocks (the
correct amount is $65 million)
and almost $100 million in yield
and gain pool stocks." I recognize
that that sounds like big money to
all of us, save perhaps Howard
Hughes, but in the scheme of

things it just isn't very substantial.
Stanford owns 5/100 of 1% of the
du Pont Company; 2/10 of l%of
Martin Marietta; and 1/10 of 1%
of Sperry Rand.
Corporate Responsibility
While officials of these
companies might politely listen to
what we have to say as a
stockholder (and they probably
have other stockholders saying just
the opposite), their proper
responsibility to all their
stockholders is to make a profit
within the limits of what society
has prescribed for them.
Stanford's communications can,
at best, function only as an
early-warning signal that perhaps a
society might be reevaluating its
limits.
(2) "The investment linkage is
stable." Hopefully, the University
will always be an investor, but not
necessarily in the same companies.
Portfolio management is a fluid
process.
(3) "Changes in the
University's investment policy
need not pose the threat to core
values that changes in its research
or recruitment policy would
entail." This, of course, is the
crux of the issue. Professor
A bernethy presumes that
neither the faculty nor the
students need bread to survive.
Reality
But students might consider
that without financial support
from donors and the Federal
government, they would now be
paying $5,700 a year in tuition
rather than $2,850 and would be
attending classes under the oak
trees without either libraries or
laboratories. Faculty might
consider how they could pursue
their teaching and research
interests in the face of a
substantially reduced paycheck
and lack of physical and support
facilities. To assume that the core
values of the University are not
dependent upon financial support
from a variety of external sources
seems to me to be out of touch
with reality.
If the risk of loss of financial
support is not a sufficient
deterrent, there is perhaps a
greater—and more fundamental
risk—to our core values: Should
the University use its financial
resources to impose its will upon

other segments of society, what is
to prevent those segments from
using their financial resources to
impose their will upon the
University?
We . exist as an institution
because society values our
existence. If we collectively seek
to change society, we must be
prepared to have society
collectively seek to change us.
Governmental Responsibility
(4) "The decisions of American
corporations obviously have a
profound impact upon our
society." And so do our
governments—local, state, and
national, our school systems, our
universities, our churches, our
labor unions, etc. Regulation of
corporate activity in the public
interest is essentially . a
governmental, not a stockholder,
responsibility.
Where does this leave us, in a
moral wasteland? Not at all.
Where the actions of a
corporation—social, financial, or
otherwise—may have a direct
adverse effect upon the
University's investment interests,
the University should make, and
the Trustees' Committee on
Investments has made, its views
known to company management.
This has been particularly true in
issues involving composition of
the Board of Directors and those
involving disclosure of
information regarding minority
hiring, activities in southern
Africa, pollution control, etc.
Without regard to our
investment interests, we may take
action on social issues when the
three Guidelines in the Statement
on Investment Responsibility are
met. Professor Abernethy argues
that if they cannot be met in the
case of his proposal, they can
never be met. At the least, that
begs the question. At the most, I
would imagine the authors of that
Statement intended that there
would be very few cases in which
the Guidelines would be met,
precisely because there are very
few occasions which warrant the
University's speaking collectively
on economic, political, or social
issues. The fact that the test is
severe is no reason to reject it as a
test.
Guidelines Not Met
Based upon the advice

provided me by the Commission
on Investment Responsibility,
there is no evidence that these
Guidelines have been met:
(1) The acts of the companies
involved are not direct and
substantial. They are legitimately
in response to contracts placed by
the Federal government. If action
need be taken, it should be
through the governmental process.
(2) There is no evidence that
substantial consensus exists within
the University community of
faculty, students, and alumni. The
issue has not been widely debated
on campus or in campus
publications. Consensus, at best, is
difficult to determine—the more
so when in a vacuum.

case of his proposal, they can
never be met. At the least, that
begs the question. At the most, I
would imagine the authors of that
Statement intended that there
would be very few cases in which
the Guidelines would be met,
precisely because there are very
few occasions which warrant the
University's speaking collectively
on economic, political, or social
issues. The fact that the test is
severe is no reason to reject it as a
test.
Guidelines Not Met
Based upon the advice

provided me by the Commission
on Investment Responsibility,
there is no evidence that these
Guidelines have been met:
(1) The acts of the companies
involved are not direct and
substantial. They are legitimately
in response to contracts placed by
the Federal government. If action
need be taken, it should be
through the governmental process.
(2) There is no evidence that
substantial consensus exists within
the University community of
faculty, students, and alumni. The
issue has not been widely debated
on campus or in campus
publications. Consensus, at best, is
difficult to determine—the more
so when in a vacuum.
Effect Unlikely
(3) The probable effects of the
action are not commensurate with
the economic costs. The use of
Stanford's stockholdings, by
whatever means, is not likely to
have any effect upon the
particular companies' willingness
to provide goods or services to the
Federal government, although
admittedly, it might relieve our
moral conscience. On the other
hand, such actions are likely to
cause alienation of some donors
who may not concur and could
also provoke retaliatory actions
by the Federal government. In
investment parlance, the potential
rewards simply aren't worth the
potential risks.
As one of many University
officers responsible for the
continuity of teaching and
research at Stanford, and having
to make a decision in this
instance, I have concluded that
there is no basis for collective
action on Professor Abernethy's
proposal.
While Professor Abernethy
may find this discouraging, I am
encouraged by what I see
happening. In my experience,
there are few other investing
institutions, i.e., banks, insurance
companies, mutual funds, where
even the process described earlier
could take place. That very
process, in and of itself, is healthy
and effective.

This second essay deals with
9ome of the philosophical issues
raised by Professor Abernethy's
essays on 'The University and
Institutional Ethics." He takes the
position that the investment
linkage between universities and
major corporations merits
increased future attention.
He presents four reasons for his
position. I will attempt to address
each of these.
(1) "The investment linkage is
substantial; Stanford, for
example, now holds over $130
million in merged fund stocks (the
correct amount is $65 million)
and almost $100 million in yield
and gain pool stocks." I recognize
that that sounds like big money to
all of us, save perhaps Howard
Hughes, but in the scheme of

things it just isn't very substantial.
Stanford owns 5/100 of 1% of the
du Pont Company; 2/10 of l%of
Martin Marietta; and 1/10 of 1%
of Sperry Rand.
Corporate Responsibility
While officials of these
companies might politely listen to
what we have to say as a
stockholder (and they probably
have other stockholders saying just
the opposite), their proper
responsibility to all their
stockholders is to make a profit
within the limits of what society
has prescribed for them.
Stanford's communications can,
at best, function only as an
early-warning signal that perhaps a
society might be reevaluating its
limits.
(2) "The investment linkage is
stable." Hopefully, the University
will always be an investor, but not
necessarily in the same companies.
Portfolio management is a fluid
process.
(3) "Changes in the
University's investment policy
need not pose the threat to core
values that changes in its research
or recruitment policy would
entail." This, of course, is the
crux of the issue. Professor
A bernethy presumes that
neither the faculty nor the
students need bread to survive.
Reality
But students might consider
that without financial support
from donors and the Federal
government, they would now be
paying $5,700 a year in tuition
rather than $2,850 and would be
attending classes under the oak
trees without either libraries or
laboratories. Faculty might
consider how they could pursue
their teaching and research
interests in the face of a
substantially reduced paycheck
and lack of physical and support
facilities. To assume that the core
values of the University are not
dependent upon financial support
from a variety of external sources
seems to me to be out of touch
with reality.
If the risk of loss of financial
support is not a sufficient
deterrent, there is perhaps a
greater—and more fundamental
risk—to our core values: Should
the University use its financial
resources to impose its will upon

other segments of society, what is
to prevent those segments from
using their financial resources to
impose their will upon the
University?
We . exist as an institution
because society values our
existence. If we collectively seek
to change society, we must be
prepared to have society
collectively seek to change us.
Governmental Responsibility
(4) "The decisions of American
corporations obviously have a
profound impact upon our
society." And so do our
governments—local, state, and
national, our school systems, our
universities, our churches, our
labor unions, etc. Regulation of
corporate activity in the public
interest is essentially . a
governmental, not a stockholder,
responsibility.
Where does this leave us, in a
moral wasteland? Not at all.
Where the actions of a
corporation—social, financial, or
otherwise—may have a direct
adverse effect upon the
University's investment interests,
the University should make, and
the Trustees' Committee on
Investments has made, its views
known to company management.
This has been particularly true in
issues involving composition of
the Board of Directors and those
involving disclosure of
information regarding minority
hiring, activities in southern
Africa, pollution control, etc.
Without regard to our
investment interests, we may take
action on social issues when the
three Guidelines in the Statement
on Investment Responsibility are
met. Professor Abernethy argues
that if they cannot be met in the
case of his proposal, they can
never be met. At the least, that
