Announcement Defended
Editor:
The recent opinion column in
the Daily entitled "Politics and
the Grateful Dead" was not only
the epitome of the pettiness that
so often characterizes attacks on
the ASSU and its officers, but
demonstrated a careless
misunderstanding of the
announcement it criticized by
ignoring the three reasons for its
publication.
The ASSU, its Special Events
program, and Special Events
Director Ron Shannon have been
subjected to a continual stream of
unwarranted and abusive criticism
in the campus press, criticism not
greatly dissimilar to that
contained in the article that
prompted this reply. Throughout
the year, ASSU Special Events has
been portrayed as poorly run,
when in fact the opposite is the
case.
As recently as Jan. 25, 1973, a
column in the Arena accused the
ASSU of "doing virtually nothing
in the way of scheduling
concerts" and labeled Ron
Shannon "Stanford's number one
can man/incompetent."
These charges are particularly
galling to those of us who have
been around Stanford for a few
years and who know that this
year's concert and entertainment
program is the best in recent times
by any standard, with the notable
exception of press relations.
Given these facts, the
announcement to which objection
was made was entire justified.
First, as partial refutation of the
recent criticism in the press;
second as an attempt on my part
to thank the students for adopting
the Special Events fee assessment
I sponsored; and finally, to
advertise the concert and give the
details of ticket buying.
The article asserts that since it
is the job of Shannon and me to
serve the students, "it would seem
special notice of their success
need hardly be made."
Considering that "special notice"
of the non-existent failures of
Special Events was published
earlier the very same day, the
announcement of our success in
obtaining very popular
entertainers was certainly in
order.
The author also criticizes us for
"blatantly" linking our "names to
this popular concert." When I
think of our time and effort, so
"blatantly linked" to the fact that
the concert is occuring at all, and
the many times in the past that
the ASSU and its officers have
been "blatantly linked"' by others
with unpopular occurences of all
sorts, I can only express the
conviction that the linkage of our
names with the concert was a very
proper retort to the recent attacks
against ourselves and the offices
we hold.

Trial By Peers
Editor,
Brent Appel's argument for an
all-student judicial system
founded on "the constitutional
principle of trial by peers" (Daily,
Feb. 7) has a number of weak
points, one of which is that
neither the U.S. Constitution nor
the Bill of Rights say anything at
all about trial by peers.
