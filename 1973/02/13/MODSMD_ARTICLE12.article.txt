# Premed Madness
## As The World Lubricates 
### 
x Jesse Cedarbaum

Strolling through the dorm the
other night, peacefully minding
my own business, my thoughts
were suddenly shattered by the
rude intercalation of a levi'd leg
into my path over which, klutz
that I am, I tripped. A shout and
three crashes later, I looked up to
find Freddie Frankfurter, future
physician and blazer
extraordinaire disentangling
himself from what once might
have been a bicycle.
"Whatcha doin', Fred?" I
asked painfully.
"Lubricating man," came the
reply.
"Lubricatin'?"
Organic
"Yeah, lubricatin\ Dontcha
read the Daily? Y'know—bumin
the midnight oil," he said, lighting
a match and touching it to the
nozzle of his "Squeek-eez" can,
singeing his sideburns in
the process.
"Oh," said I.
"Gotta keep the of machine in
shape so I can get to my front row
seat in Organic. Don't tell
anybody," he whispered, "but
that way I can take the notes

before the rest of the class gets
them." So saying he took off into
the darkness.
"I'm late, I'm late, for a very
important date. ..
Advisor
No sooner had Fred left for
tomorrow's Organic class than
Willie Weener came bounding
down the hall. Of all pre-meds,
Willie alone has the unique feature
of large white, furry ears which
don't miss a word out of the
professor's mouth, much to Fred's
chagrin.
"But it's midnight, Willie," I
pointed out.
"Gotta study, man. Physics 'til !
12:15, Chem 'til 12:30. Then I !
gotta study for a meeting with my I
pre-med advisor."
"Study?"
"Yeah. He's a spy. They all j
are—get paid by the med schools.
Gotta be prepared." His parting
words echoed up the staircase.
Tired and a bit confused, I
began wandering towards my
room. Along the way, who should
I encounter but Sherwood
Green berg, the Kosher Red Hot.
Sherwood is one of those

holdovers from the golden days of
the Revolution. He got hit in the
head with a rock one day and
decided to go "straight."
''What's happening
Sherwood?" I ventured to ask.
"Work, study, get ahead, kill;
work, study, get ahead, kill; work,

study, get ahead. ..
"Lubricate, man."

professor's mouth, much to Fred's
chagrin.
"But it's midnight, Willie," I
pointed out.
"Gotta study, man. Physics 'til !
12:15, Chem 'til 12:30. Then I !
gotta study for a meeting with my I
pre-med advisor."
"Study?"
"Yeah. He's a spy. They all j
are—get paid by the med schools.
Gotta be prepared." His parting
words echoed up the staircase.
Tired and a bit confused, I
began wandering towards my
room. Along the way, who should
I encounter but Sherwood
Green berg, the Kosher Red Hot.
Sherwood is one of those

holdovers from the golden days of
the Revolution. He got hit in the
head with a rock one day and
decided to go "straight."
''What's happening
Sherwood?" I ventured to ask.
"Work, study, get ahead, kill;
work, study, get ahead, kill; work,

study, get ahead. ..
"Lubricate, man."

Strolling through the dorm the
other night, peacefully minding
my own business, my thoughts
were suddenly shattered by the
rude intercalation of a levi'd leg
into my path over which, klutz
that I am, I tripped. A shout and
three crashes later, I looked up to
find Freddie Frankfurter, future
physician and blazer
extraordinaire disentangling
himself from what once might
have been a bicycle.
"Whatcha doin', Fred?" I
asked painfully.
"Lubricating man," came the
reply.
"Lubricatin'?"
Organic
"Yeah, lubricatin\ Dontcha
read the Daily? Y'know—bumin
the midnight oil," he said, lighting
a match and touching it to the
nozzle of his "Squeek-eez" can,
singeing his sideburns in
the process.
"Oh," said I.
"Gotta keep the of machine in
shape so I can get to my front row
seat in Organic. Don't tell
anybody," he whispered, "but
that way I can take the notes

before the rest of the class gets
them." So saying he took off into
the darkness.
"I'm late, I'm late, for a very
important date. ..

No sooner had Fred left for
tomorrow's Organic class than
Willie Weener came bounding
down the hall. Of all pre-meds,
Willie alone has the unique feature
of large white, furry ears which
don't miss a word out of the
professor's mouth, much to Fred's
chagrin.
"But it's midnight, Willie," I
pointed out.
