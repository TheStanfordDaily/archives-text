# Profs Favor Collective Negotiation
## Faculty Strikes Opposed 
### 
More than a third of the
nation's college professors (36
percent) believe collective
negotiation is the "most
effective" way for the faculty to
have meaningful influence over
decisions of their campuses, a new
University survey indicates.
But very substantial majorities
rate their campus administration
high in its attitude toward their
salary, working conditions, and
communication. Only one in eight
(12 percent) believe the strike
option is one the faculty should
"seriously consider" in dealing
with the administration.
These preliminary findings of
the Stanford project on academic

governance are reported by
graduate student George Paul
Ecker and Assistant Prof. J.
Victor Baldridge of the School of
Education in a research and
development memorandum on
"Academic Politics, Morale and
Involvement."
Their findings are based on
usable returns from more than
9,200 faculty and administrators
at 241 institutions, chosen to
provide a broad cross-section of
higher education.
Only one-fifth of the
respondents (21 percent) felt
faculty on their campus ought to
be more militant in their notion
of what is "proper" in dealing
with their administrations.
How Views Are Expressed
When asked how they made
their views known and articulated
their interests in academic
governance, 38 percent said they
had signed petitions, 34 percent
wrote letters to appropriate
administrators, 17 percent made
public statements urging a
particular action, 8 percent made
their position known to mass
media off campus, 7 percent
appealed to alumni, and 1.5

percent said they had participated
in a strike.
When viewed by type of
institution, support for organizing
and negotiating collectively was
strongest at two-year public
institutions (50 percent) and less
frequent at private institutions
offering the master's degree (19
percent).
More than two-thirds of all
respondents felt the top
administration of their
institutions was generally
"competent, able and energetic."
Almost as many said their
administration understands the
needs of academic professionals
and works hard to make their
campus a place "where academics
can work productively."
