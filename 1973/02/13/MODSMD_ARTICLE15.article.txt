# Peacekeepers Face Rough Task
## 
### WILLIAM L. RYAN AP Special Correspondent 
If history is a guide, the four nations
chosen to supervise a cessation of hostilities in
Indochina have an unenviable and perhaps
impossible job ahead of them.
Poland and Hungary as the Communist
members and Canada and Indonesia as the
non-Communist have been asked to take the
assignment.
Cease-fire and armistice arrangements over
the past quarter century, in a world dotted
with sanguinary conflicts, have been mostly
failures.
Implicit in the story is a lesson that
cease-fire and armistice agreements work only
to the extent that the participants want them
to work. Distrust and suspicion erect
monumental barriers to stable peace in areas
tormented by fratricidal warfare.
International peace-keeping efforts both
within and outside the framework of the
United Nations have been tried in such diverse
areas as Indochina, the Middle East, Africa's
former Belgian Congo, Korea and Cyprus. The
record looks like this:
Middle East
Ever since mid-1949, the United Nations
has been trying to keep Arabs and Jews from
going to war. After U.N. efforts achieved a
cease-fire and armistice in the first Arab-Israeli
war, the world body drew up demarcation
lines to separate the hostile forces. It set up a
mixed armistice commission to watch for
violations. But no international effort could
have healed wounds that went so deep.
Constant tension and frequent armistice
violations culminated in a world crisis in
October 1956 when "Britain and France, stung
by the decision of Gamal Abdel Nasser to
nationalize the Suez Canal, joined Israel in an
attack on Egypt.
Big power intervention forced an end to

the hostilities and in November the United
Nations decided to send an emergency
force—the UNEF—to supervise the cease-fire.
No nation opposed this, although Russia later
would renounce financial responsibility.
A force of 6,000 was formed to serve as a
buffer between the two sides. It was destined
to remain in place through 11 years of
unremitting tension, with never a sign of the
peace that the peace-keepers were supposed to
keep.
Early in 1967 the Arab world was in
another of its frequent states of disarray.
Syria challenged Nassar's preeminence by
clamoring the new war on Israel. Stung,
Nassar ordered the UNEF to leave his
territory. To his dismay, the UNEF complied.
The barrier was gone and the new war erupted
at once.
Israel humiliated the combined Arab forces
for all of Nassar's imposing display of soviet
weaponry in six days of lightning conflict.
Indochina
The effort in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia
was a long exercise in futility.
The 1954 Geneva agreements ending the
French phase of the war and dividing Vietnam
placed a three nation International Control
Commission in charge of policing the
armistice.
A built-in ICC weakness presaged inevitable
failure. The makeup was supposed to be
pro-West, pro-Communist and neutral—the
members were Canada, Poland and India. If
unanimous action were needed paralysis was
automatic.
North Vietnam promptly declined to let
the ICC move freely in its territory. South
Vietnam interfered with investigations. Both
sides blatantly and openly violated armistice
provisions.
The ICC could do little but issue reports to
the two Geneva co-chairmen, the Soviet

Union and Britain.
It had neither the power nor the will to
control the situations in Vietnam, Laos and
Cambodia. The ICC did no better, either, after
the 1962 Geneva agreements on Laos which
were blatantly violated almost before the ink
of the signature was dry.
Korea
An armistice ended fighting between the
Chinese North Korean Communist forces and
the U.N. led by the United States in July
1953. The sides were to withdraw from the
38th parallel and from a demilitarized zone
about three miles wide. Each would refrain
from new military building.
It didn't work. North Korea began at once
to accept big shipments of military hardware
from Russia. South Korea matched that with
material from the Americans. The armistice
for 19 years has been uneasy and marked by
frequent violations across the DMZ line.
Forces massed on each side of the DMZ
make the tension constant. A U.N.
Commission for Unification and
Rehabilitation of Korea has existed since late
1950 but North Korea has never permitted it
to set foot on northern soil and now demands
its dissolution.
Congo
The United Nations tried to keep the peace
in the explosive Belgian Congo in the early
1960's but matters got out of hand. By 1964
the Congo had produced Black Africa's most
dangerous cold war clash growing out of a
Communist supported secessionist rebellion in
the east.
Frustrated, the U.N. peace keeping force
finally withdrew. Eventually Gen. Joseph I).
Mobuto asserted his authority, put down a
variety of challenges, and now rules Zaire as
the Congo has been renamed under a
constitution giving him broad presidential
powers.
