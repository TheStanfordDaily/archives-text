# Despite PA Problems, Dead Brings Audience To Its Feet
## 
### JAY HARLOW 
It was 24 hours before the
Maples Pavilion gates would open,
and the first places in line had
already been occupied for four
hours. Rose Bowl tickets? UCLA
basketball tickets? No, the
Grateful Dead.
I'm sure those intrepid
campers would agree that the
Dead concert Friday night,
sponsored by ASSU Special
Events, was worth the wait. They
and the rest of the crowd, some
8000, were treated to almost five
hours of 'live Dead.'
The group ran into some
technical problems with the amps
and PA system throughout the
first set. The vocals were almost
inaudible for the first few
numbers. The players accordingly
turned them up, but they were
still a bit hard to hear. Also
disappointing was the fact that
the audience could only rarely
hear Keith Godchaux's paino
work; in fact, I often forgot that
he was there at all.
The personnel was basically the
same as on the live "Europe '72"
album, except for the absence of
Pigpen on organ and harmonica:
Jerry Garcia, lead guitar; Bob
Weir, rhythm guitar; Phil Lesh,
bass; Bill Kreutzmann, drums;
Godchaux, piano; and his wife
Donna, vocals.
Pleasant Blends
The concert combined a
pleasant blend of the Dead's best
and least known material, with a
sprinkling of new songs. Of the
first few songs they played, while
the bugs were being worked out
of the system, some were
unfamiliar,' some vaguely familiar.
Later on they played "Me & My
Uncle," "Sugaree" from Garcia's
solo album, Weir's "Mexicali
Blues," and some more
unrecorded and new material
before taking a break.
Half of the trip at any Dead
concert is looking at the rest of
the audience. This crowd looked
like a mixture of the audiences at
a Winterland concert and an SC
football game. I saw painted faces,
a Bozo mask, all sorts of Grateful
Dead T-shirts, crazy hats, and
thrift-store and costume-shop
dresses. Right near them were
Stanford T-shirts and Band hats
and Adidas tennis shoes, too.
There were roach clips, hash
pipes, beer cans, and Southern
Comfort bottles.

There were incredibly
straight-looking people and there
were incredibly freaky people.
Mostly, however, there were a lot
of people having a good time.
Standing Crowd
After the break, with most of
their technical problems ironed
out, the Dead came back with
more familiar songs, many of
them similar to the arrangements
on "Europe '72." These brought
the crowd to its feet through most
of the second set. Unfortunately,
some hums and other problems
lingered, so there were a few long
delays between songs.
Weir partly filled in the waits.
He kept the audience posted on
what was going on in back—"You
don't know how hard it is making
all those little adjustments back
there in the dark, seeing double,"
and so on.
The music that came between
the equipment hassles certainly
made uj. for the delays. The group
played excellent renditions of
"China Cat Sunflower" / "I Know
You Rider," "Jack Straw,"
"Truckin'," and "Ramble On
Rose," together with some more
obscure material.
Bouncing To Music
From time to time throughout
the show, the audience on the
main floor started bouncing in
time with the music until the
entire gym floor was shaking. The
monster speaker towers, which
stood on the stage and reached
halfway to the rafters, were
rocking so violently that they
might have fallen if they had not
been also suspended from the
rafters.
On quite a few numbers, there
were long instrumental breaks in

which Garcia, Weir, and Lesh
would take off in three different
directions, with their paths
crossing just often enough to
establish that they were all headed
for the same place.
One particularly pleasant
surprise was "Box of Rain," one
of the mellower songs from
"American Beauty." They
finished the set with a strong
"Sugar Magnolia" and "Uncle
John's Band."
• Encores
After several minutes of loud,
bouncing, floor-shaking ovation,
the band returned, first with

something that sounded a little
like "Johnny B. Goode,"and then
"Casey Jones," the opening bars
of which brought near-unanimous
shrieks of approval.
The concert seemed on the
whole an even-better-than-usual
blend of mellower and harder
rock, done in the style that is
uniquely the Dead's.
So what if there were some
technical hangups? After seeing
8000 people get off on their
music for nearly five hours, I see
no reason to complain, but only
to ask, "how soon are * the
Grateful Dead coming back?"
