## Symphony Lacks Spirit 
### DOUG SMITH 
Impresario Istvan Kertesz of the Cologne Opera
appeared as guest conductor of the San Francisco
Symphony last Wednesday in a program of works
by Schubert, Mahler and Kodaly.
Schubert's Symphony No. 5 in B flat Major
started out the concert. The composer wrote it
when he was only nineteen; the symphony shows
strong influences of the Viennese classical
composers. The first movement conveys an
especially Haydenesque spirit, with flutes contributing
to the bucolic character.
Kertesz' interpretation plodded considerably.
The orchestra played well but seemed to lack the
inspiration it receives from Seiji Ozawa. There was
none of the usual brilliance, precision and clarity
that Ozawa brings out. It was as if the audience
were hearing the orchestra through a loudspeaker
rather than on the stage before us.
The orchestra generally chose its dynamics well,
although a soloist occasionally played too softly. All
in all, the symphony was pleasant, but only in the
trio of the Minuet was there a sense of freedom.
Not Penetrated Mahler
From his performance of the song cycle
"Kindertotenlieder" it was evident that Kertesz has
not penetrated the depths of Gustav Mahler, either.
He muted the kaleidoscopic color of Mahler's
orchestration and over restrained the passionate
sorrow of these songs on the deaths of children.
Australian soprano Yvonne Minton sang with
great dignity and expression, but, like the orchestra,
she lacked the inspiration from the podium
necessary to turn in a transcendant performance like
Janet Baker's a month ago with Ozawa. Minton
possesses the dark vocal color that a successful
interpreter of Mahler's symphonic songs must

possess; her German diction was good; and she sang
with perfect clarity and control throughout her
entire range.
At the end of the fifth and last song, on the
words "In dieser Brust sie ruh'n/alswieinder Mutter
Haus," Miss Minton was able to rise above the
tedium. In this very moving section the audience
caught a glimpse of a great artist.
In His Element
It was immediately apparent at the beginning of
Zoltan Kodaly's "Hary Janos Suite" that
Hungarian-born Kertesz was much more in his own
element. He handled orchestral color far more
adeptly. In general, his interpretation of the score
was more convincing. Nonetheless, there remained a
trace of the restraint that characterized his Schubert
and Mahler performances.
Kodaly fashioned this suite from his opera on the
subject of the old peasant Hary Janos. Hary is a
spinner of tales, mostly about himself, and in the
suite the orchestra relates his fantasies. The music is
delightful, deriving a great deal of vitality from the
Hungarian folk music that Kodaly and Bartok
collected m the early part of this century. It
features a soloist on the cimbalom, a hammered
dulcimer prominent in Hungarian gypsy bands.
In the final section, the "Entry of the Emperor
and his Court,"the conductor finally forgot
himself, volume and tempo increased and the music
took on a sense of real excitement for the first time.
Most of the audience jumped to their feet for a
lengthy standing ovation.
According to an acquaintance of mine in the
string section, the orchestra thinks very highly of
Kertesz. He is certainly a fine conductor, but this
performance did not demonstrate that he can
consistently penetrate the music beyond the notes.
