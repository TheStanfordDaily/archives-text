# POWs Experiment With New Freedoms
## 
### Associated Press 
CLARK AIR FORCE BASE,
Philippines — The first American war
prisoners to gain freedom since the
Vietnam peace agreement
experimented last night with some
pleasures of life outside Communist
prison campus.
The 116 men who arrived from
Hanoi were joined late yesterday by
26 who had been imprisoned in South
Vietnam.
Back under the U.S. flag, the POWs
telephoned their families in the United
States, tinkered with the TV sets in
their rooms at the Clark Air Base
Hospital and dined on steak and eggs.
Only four of the 143 were sick
enough to be brought back on litters.
Many others looked pale and wan,
particularly those released at Loc Ninh
in South Vietnam. They flew into
Clark after their release was delayed
11 hours by a dispute between the
South Vietnamese government and the
Viet Cong.
POWs Condition Good
But the commander of the Clark
Air Base Hospital, Col. John W. Ord,
told newsmen after his staff of more
than 60 physicians and specialists ran a
quick check: "The general physical
condition of the personnel is good."
Short Hospital Stay
The favorable medical bulletins
indicated that the stay for most
prisoners at Clark might be short.
Officials said most can be expected to
be on their way back to the United
States within three days.
Their first stop in the states will be
Travis Air Force Base near Fairfield,
Calif., about 40 miles northeast of San
Francisco.
Left behind in North and South
Vietnam and Laos are 419 other
Americans, mainly military personnel,
who are scheduled to be released in
three more groups over the next six
weeks.

Those in the first group wolfed
down ice cream, steak, corn on the
cob, chicken and strawberry shortcake
for their first meal in freedom. Most
requested — and got — that typical
fare rather than the bland diets
planned by doctors to ease their
transition from prison life.
Today, the POWs begin extensive
medical checks. They will be measured
for new uniforms and get the basic
items needed for everyday use, like
toothbrushes and soap.
The arrival of the prisoners from
South Vietnam contrasted sharply
with the arrival of those from Hanoi.
Official Welcome
Arriving at Clark, the Air Force and
Navy aviators from Hanoi briskly
emerged from their aircraft, saluted
and shook hands with the official
welcoming party and waved at the
crowd of military personnel and
newsmen.
Most of the 26 men from South
Vietnam had been held for years by
the Viet Cong in tunnels and jungle
villages. Civilian Douglas Pamsey was a
prisoner for seven years. They insisted
on wearing the Viet Cong-issued
pajamas of pastel green and blue cloth
until they entered Clark hospital.
The Hanoi prisoners had changed
into American hospital garb on the
planes.
Viet POWs Shy
The prisoners from the South also
seemed shy of the huge press reception
awaiting them and seemed uncertain
whether to shake hands with the
welcoming dignataries.
One reason for the shyness of the
prisoners from the South was probably
the isolated nature of their
confinement. An escort officer said he
got the impression on the flight to
Clark from Saigon that one of the
POWs had not even been informed
that Americans had landed on the
moon.

The prisoners from the South also
seemed shy of the huge press reception
awaiting them and seemed uncertain
whether to shake hands with the
welcoming dignataries.
One reason for the shyness of the
prisoners from the South was probably
the isolated nature of their
confinement. An escort officer said he
got the impression on the flight to
Clark from Saigon that one of the
POWs had not even been informed
that Americans had landed on the
moon.
CLARK AIR FORCE BASE,
Philippines — The first American war
prisoners to gain freedom since the
Vietnam peace agreement
experimented last night with some
pleasures of life outside Communist
prison campus.
The 116 men who arrived from
Hanoi were joined late yesterday by
26 who had been imprisoned in South
Vietnam.
Back under the U.S. flag, the POWs
telephoned their families in the United
States, tinkered with the TV sets in
their rooms at the Clark Air Base
Hospital and dined on steak and eggs.
Only four of the 143 were sick
enough to be brought back on litters.
Many others looked pale and wan,
particularly those released at Loc Ninh
in South Vietnam. They flew into
Clark after their release was delayed
11 hours by a dispute between the
South Vietnamese government and the
Viet Cong.
POWs Condition Good
But the commander of the Clark
Air Base Hospital, Col. John W. Ord,
told newsmen after his staff of more
than 60 physicians and specialists ran a
quick check: "The general physical
condition of the personnel is good."
Short Hospital Stay
The favorable medical bulletins
indicated that the stay for most
prisoners at Clark might be short.
Officials said most can be expected to
be on their way back to the United
States within three days.
Their first stop in the states will be
Travis Air Force Base near Fairfield,
Calif., about 40 miles northeast of San
Francisco.
Left behind in North and South
Vietnam and Laos are 419 other
Americans, mainly military personnel,
who are scheduled to be released in
three more groups over the next six
weeks.

Those in the first group wolfed
down ice cream, steak, corn on the
cob, chicken and strawberry shortcake
for their first meal in freedom. Most
requested — and got — that typical
fare rather than the bland diets
planned by doctors to ease their
transition from prison life.
Today, the POWs begin extensive
medical checks. They will be measured
for new uniforms and get the basic
items needed for everyday use, like
toothbrushes and soap.
The arrival of the prisoners from
South Vietnam contrasted sharply
with the arrival of those from Hanoi.
Official Welcome
Arriving at Clark, the Air Force and
Navy aviators from Hanoi briskly
emerged from their aircraft, saluted
and shook hands with the official
welcoming party and waved at the
crowd of military personnel and
newsmen.
Most of the 26 men from South
Vietnam had been held for years by
the Viet Cong in tunnels and jungle
villages. Civilian Douglas Pamsey was a
prisoner for seven years. They insisted
on wearing the Viet Cong-issued
pajamas of pastel green and blue cloth
until they entered Clark hospital.
The Hanoi prisoners had changed
into American hospital garb on the
planes.
