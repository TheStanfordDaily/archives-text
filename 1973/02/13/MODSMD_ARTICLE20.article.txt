# 'Sleuth' Runs Like Clockwork
## 
### ELLEN KENESHEA 
'Sleuth' is an exercise in
dexterity for actors Michael Caine
and Laurence Olivier. They are
given much time and little space
in which to move in diverting,
enticing patterns for each other
and the audience. They succeed
for both.
'Sleuth' is based upon Anthony
Shaffer's Tony Award winning
play, and Shaffer has adapted it
for the screen. Nothing has been
lost in the translation; much has
been gained through the
performances of the two actors.
'Sleuth' is a game and a series
of puzzles within puzzles. It posits
a self-contained world and a
gamesman who charts each move
as he waits for the kill.
The gamesman is Andrew
Wyke,(Laurence Olivier), an English
gentleman with a penchant for the
grotesque and a cruel wit. He
writes detective stories whose
protagonist is an aristocratic
English gentleman dependent
upon his breeding and a caustic
intellect.
Hair-Dresser
Into Wyke's English manor
comes Milo Tindle,(Michael C&ine),
a hair-dresser and an Englishman,
but of Italian descent. The film
opens on Wyke, sitting in the
midst of a labyrinth of hedges as
he dictates the end of his latest
novel into a tape-recorder.
Tindle pulls into the mansion's
grand driveway and steps out of a
red sportscar looking lithe,
handsome, and quite capable of
looking out for himself. He walks
with the air of a man who knows
what he wants and how to go
about getting it. But, as Tindle
winds through the labyrinth,
hearing Wyke but unable to work
through the maze to him, one
realizes that for once, Tindle is a
man unprepared.
During the ensuing hour he

learns just that. Gradually,
painfully, he also learns how to
strike back, and, finally, how to
work the games to his own rules.
Esoteric Games
Wyke's mansion is a gorgeous
set-piece full of esoteric games,
half-finished monochromatic
puzzles, and mechanical dolls that
move, sing, and upon appropriate
humorless occasions, laugh nastily.
Director Joseph Mankiewicz
makes full use of the bizarre
house; it becomes an integral part
of the macabre tone of the play.
He has also managed that most
difficult feat of turning a play
that takes place almost entirely in
a few rooms (the stage set
consisted of just one room and a
staircase) into a gripping film.
Mankiewicz moves his camera
well; enough to break up the
staginess of the work, but not so
much that he draws attention to
it.
He also moves his actors well;
they are superb. Olivier's Wyke
careens through his egocentric
world unwilling, almost unable, to
admit the presence of the intruder
Tindle. Wily and calculating, he
shifts from character to character,
from game to game as he schemes
to annihilate the unwanted
presence. Through Olivier's
masterful craftsmanship, Wyke
becomes an expert dissembler, a
man so sure of his artfulness that
ultimately he must trap himself.
Match for Olivier
Caine is as much of a match for
Olivier, as Tindle proves to be for
Wyke. His emotions ring true
throughout; he is the sort of man
just proud enough to tangle with
Wyke on his own grounds, and
then, humiliated and chastened,
still return to the fray. He would
need to even out his disturbances,
and who would be cockey enough
and shrewd enough to do so, at
whatever cost.
The flaw in 'Sleuth' is the play

itself. Slick and tricky though it
may be, at heart it is also mean; it
curls into itself like a dead spider,
whithering rather than growing in
the memory. Shaffer's characters
move and parry with dexterity,
but their too easy manueverings
lack an emotional reasonance.
The audience is forced to
accept on faith what reason may
deny—that men act and react as
do Tindle and Wyke.
Verisimilitude need not be the
goal of art, but Shaffer's play is all
mechanics and posing. Like the
wind-up dolls in the film, 'Sleuth'
is fascinating while it's running,
but stilted and awkward when it
winds down.
Fortunately, Mankiewicz,
Olivier, and Caine keep 'Sleuth'
running and clicking, making the
unavoidable hitches seem minor.

midst of a labyrinth of hedges as
he dictates the end of his latest
novel into a tape-recorder.
Tindle pulls into the mansion's
grand driveway and steps out of a
red sportscar looking lithe,
handsome, and quite capable of
looking out for himself. He walks
with the air of a man who knows
what he wants and how to go
about getting it. But, as Tindle
winds through the labyrinth,
hearing Wyke but unable to work
through the maze to him, one
realizes that for once, Tindle is a
man unprepared.
During the ensuing hour he

learns just that. Gradually,
painfully, he also learns how to
strike back, and, finally, how to
work the games to his own rules.
Esoteric Games
Wyke's mansion is a gorgeous
set-piece full of esoteric games,
half-finished monochromatic
puzzles, and mechanical dolls that
move, sing, and upon appropriate
humorless occasions, laugh nastily.
Director Joseph Mankiewicz
makes full use of the bizarre
house; it becomes an integral part
of the macabre tone of the play.
He has also managed that most
difficult feat of turning a play
that takes place almost entirely in
a few rooms (the stage set
consisted of just one room and a
staircase) into a gripping film.
Mankiewicz moves his camera
well; enough to break up the
staginess of the work, but not so
much that he draws attention to
it.
He also moves his actors well;
they are superb. Olivier's Wyke
careens through his egocentric
world unwilling, almost unable, to
admit the presence of the intruder
Tindle. Wily and calculating, he
shifts from character to character,
from game to game as he schemes
to annihilate the unwanted
presence. Through Olivier's
masterful craftsmanship, Wyke
becomes an expert dissembler, a
man so sure of his artfulness that
ultimately he must trap himself.
Match for Olivier
Caine is as much of a match for
Olivier, as Tindle proves to be for
Wyke. His emotions ring true
throughout; he is the sort of man
just proud enough to tangle with
Wyke on his own grounds, and
then, humiliated and chastened,
still return to the fray. He would
need to even out his disturbances,
and who would be cockey enough
and shrewd enough to do so, at
whatever cost.
The flaw in 'Sleuth' is the play

itself. Slick and tricky though it
may be, at heart it is also mean; it
curls into itself like a dead spider,
whithering rather than growing in
the memory. Shaffer's characters
move and parry with dexterity,
but their too easy manueverings
lack an emotional reasonance.
The audience is forced to
accept on faith what reason may
deny—that men act and react as
do Tindle and Wyke.
Verisimilitude need not be the
goal of art, but Shaffer's play is all
mechanics and posing. Like the
wind-up dolls in the film, 'Sleuth'
is fascinating while it's running,
but stilted and awkward when it
winds down.
Fortunately, Mankiewicz,
Olivier, and Caine keep 'Sleuth'
running and clicking, making the
unavoidable hitches seem minor.
'Sleuth' is an exercise in
dexterity for actors Michael Caine
and Laurence Olivier. They are
given much time and little space
in which to move in diverting,
enticing patterns for each other
and the audience. They succeed
for both.
'Sleuth' is based upon Anthony
Shaffer's Tony Award winning
play, and Shaffer has adapted it
for the screen. Nothing has been
lost in the translation; much has
been gained through the
performances of the two actors.
'Sleuth' is a game and a series
of puzzles within puzzles. It posits
a self-contained world and a
gamesman who charts each move
as he waits for the kill.
The gamesman is Andrew
Wyke,(Laurence Olivier), an English
gentleman with a penchant for the
grotesque and a cruel wit. He
writes detective stories whose
protagonist is an aristocratic
English gentleman dependent
upon his breeding and a caustic
intellect.
Hair-Dresser
Into Wyke's English manor
comes Milo Tindle,(Michael C&ine),
a hair-dresser and an Englishman,
but of Italian descent. The film
opens on Wyke, sitting in the
midst of a labyrinth of hedges as
he dictates the end of his latest
