Kissinger Arrives In Hong Kong
HONG KONG - Henry A. Kissinger arrived in Hong Kong
Tuesday afternoon (local time) after delaying his
departure from Hanoi for three hours. There was no
explanation for the delay.
Kissinger, President Nixon's national security adviser,
had been in the North Vietnamese capital since Saturday,
conferring with top officials of the Communist
government about postwar relations between Washington
and Hanoi.
The White House said Kissinger's talks lasted a total of
16V6 hours, but he was not expected to divulge any
information about them while in Hong Kong.
He is scheduled to remain in Hong Kong until
Thursday, when he flies to Peking for talks there Feb.
15-19 with Premier Chou En-lai. His stay in Hong Kong
was billed as a rest stop, and he scheduled no meetings
with the press.
Prison Disturbance Controlled
WALPOLE, Mass. — Fires broke out in sections of the
state's maximum security prison here last night, but
prison officials reported "stable conditions" at 8:15 p.m.,
some three hours after the disturbance began.
A spokesman said there had been no injuries.
"There were several fires in the maximum security
blocks," prison system spokesman John Mac Lean said in a
statement. He said state police remained on standby alert
at the prison, but said they had not been called inside. He
said corrections officers from three nearby state prisons
were "geared up" and pressed into duty to help put the
troubles down.
A state police spokesman said it was the second
consecutive night of trouble at the prison, located about
20 miles south of Boston. About 100 state police troopers
had been dispatched to the prison in riot gear.
Mac Lean said the trouble began some time after 5 p.m.
when an estimated 300 inmates refused lockup in the
maximum security sections of the prison which houses
580 men.
The trouble came only days after the prison ended a
month-long lockup which was instituted in a search for
contraband and a crackdown on organized crime, which
officials blame for much of the trouble at the prison.
Rand Documents Viewing Protested
LOS ANGELES — Attorneys for Daniel Ellsberg and
Anthony Russo fought yesterday to keep jurors from
seeing signed documents in which Ellsberg and Russo
promised the Rand Corp. they would follow security
rules.
The attorneys argued at the Pentagon Papers trial that
a violation of Rand security rules is not a violation of law
and that the papers are immaterial.
They also sought to keep out of evidence the Rand
security manual and acknowledgements by Ellsberg and
Russo that they had read it. The lawyers asked for a
special hearing at which the government would be ordered
to prove the propriety of such evidence and the defense
would call witnesses to rebut these claims.
U.S. District Court Judge Matt Byrne withheld
immediate ruling, asking the government to indicate more

specifically which phrases of the documents it intends to
show jurors.
Ellsberg 41, and Russo, 36, were employees of the
Rand "think tank" at Santa Monica, Calif., doing research
on government requested projects, when they allegedly
copied the Pentagon Papers. They are charged with
espionage, conspiracy and theft in the leak of that secret
study of the Vietnam war to news media.
Atlantic Pollution Study Released
WASHINGTON — Government scientists yesterday
reported finding globs of oil and bits of plastic "in massive
proportions" in the Atlantic Ocean from Cape Cod to the
Caribbean Sea.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
(NOAA) said the pollution was distributed "far more
widely than had previously been suspected."
Analyzing samples of the microscopic organisms that
form the basis of the ocean's food chain, NOAA reported
that "more than half the plankton samples young fish and
their food collected from surface waters were
oil-con taminated."
The oil pollution was so thick, NOAA reported, that
the three research ships which cruised the Atlantic last
summer had trouble collecting samples at all.
"One of the survey ships, Albatros IV, reported that 75
percent of the time its nets were befouled by oil clumps
so thick they extruded through the mesh 'like
spaghetti,' " the agency said.
The scientists estimated the contamination covered
about 50 percent of the survey area off the East Coast
from Massachusetts to Florida; 80 percent in the
Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico; and 90 percent in an area
surrounding the Bahamas and the West Indies.
For the past several years, oil pollution of the oceans
has been recognized as a serious problem, and has led to
federal actions, international agreements and successful
U.S. legislation, all aimed at curbing it.
Highway 1 Stretch Erased By Slide
BIG SUR — The state Division of Highways estimated
yesterday that it will take three months and a major
outlay of cash to reconstruct a 200-yard stretch of
slide-erased Coast Highway 1.
A spokesman for the Division of Highways said the
gully created eight miles south of here over Laffler
Canyon would require expensive new construction to
reconnect Highway 1.
Fire protection for those living south of the wiped-out
roadbed is available only from a Forestry Service pumper
housed on Pacifica Valley, an hour down the coast.
And for those living south of the gap, the only way to
Carmel, 25 miles to the north, is a two-hour drive to San
Luis Obispo, and back north another two hours on
Highway 101.
Today's Weather
Chance of showers this morning then increasing clouds in
the afternoon with rain likely tonight continuing on and
off tomorrow. Lows tonight in 40s to low 50s. Highs both
days in 50s. Chance of rain 30 percent today and 70
percent tonight.
