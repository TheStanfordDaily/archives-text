# 'Radical' Faces Perjury Charge
## 
### 
The prosecution in the trial of a
Marin County radical plans to file
perjury charges against Sandra Kahn,
34, the wife of History Prof. Harold
Kahn, for her defense testimony in the
case.
Mrs. Kahn testified in behalf of
Tommy Lee Walker, 27, who is
charged with assault on Sausalito
police officer Robert Klein and a

hitchhiker, John Randolph. She said
she saw Klein strike Walker first and
added that she had not known Walker
prior to the incident.
Marin County Deputy District
Attorney Jerry Herman then produced
letters allegedly written by Kahn to
Folsom prison convict Ray Carringer
in which she indicated that she knew
Walker and thought he was a "good

dude."
Earlier in the trial, San Francisco
police officer Alexander Jason
identified Kahn as being associated
with Venceremos, a Bay Area
Marxist-Leninist-Maoist group. Jason,
who said he had infiltrated the group,
alleged that Kahn advocated acts of
terrorism and political assassination.
Fired English Prof. H. Bruce
Franklin, a Venceremos Central
Committee member, said yesterday
that Jason had used the name Al
Jensen while "he was in a study group
we had set up" in San Francisco.
Franklin insisted that Jason "didn't
infiltrate Venceremos" and
emphasized that Kahn was not a
member of the organization.
Superior Court Judge Henry
Broderick ordered Kahn to be
available for further examination, but
then was told that she had
disappeared. Her husband refused to
testify as to the authenticity of her
signature on the letters to the Folsom
inmate. His refusal was based on
marital privilege.
