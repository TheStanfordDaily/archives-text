# Dollar's Value Trimmed To Avert Money Crisis
## 
### Associated Press 
WASHINGTON - The United States
devalued the dollar by 10 percent
Monday night, the second drop in
little over a year, in a bold move to
halt the raging international currency
crisis.
Treasury Secretary George P.
Shultz, flanked by other top
administration officials, announced
the devaluation at a late-night news
conference.
He said President Nixon had
approved it and predicted it would
benefit workers, consumers and
businessmen.
In addition, Shultz disclosed a
number of other moves, including a
floating of the Japanese yen, meaning
the yen will be allowed to find its own
market value. The German mark,

another currency under intense
pressure, will keep its present value.
Gold Price Up
The change in the dollar's value is
effective immediately. It will be
achieved by raising the official price of
gold from the present $38 an ounce to
$42.22. The immediate effect of the
change will be to raise the price of
foreign imports into the United States
and lower the price of American goods
shipped to other countries.
The dollar was last devalued on
Dec. 18, 1971, by 8.57 percent against
the price of gold. That devaluation,
part of a worldwide currency
agreement, became unstuck in the past
two weeks.
Monday night's announcement was
made as most of the world's major
money markets remained closed
because of pressure on the dollar. In
places where they had opened earlier
Monday, the dollar fell again in value,
as it has during the crisis. Money
markets are expected to open again
Tuesday.
Imports More Expensive
Shultz also announced that the
United States will phase out by the
end of 1974 its controls on the export
of U.S. capital.
He told the unusual news
conference that the devaluation and
the other moves taken by the Nixon
administration will benefit "the
American working man, businessman
and the consumer."
A dollar devaluation has the effect
of making imports into the United
States more expensive and U.S.
exports to other countries cheaper,
thus giving the nation a better trading
advantage.
'Floating' To Continue
Shultz said other nations may make
changes in the values of their
currencies after announcement of the
American devaluation. Such currency
changes would have to be announced
by the countries involved.
But he said it is likely that
countries with floating currencies,
such as Canada and Great Britain, will

continue with the float.
As for the Japanese currency,
Shultz said, the United States expects
the yen will rise in value against the
dollar over the 10 percent change.
Monday's devaluation was the
second major change in world
currencies since December 1971, when
major non-Communist nations agreed
to a new currency alignment following
a conf?rence at the Smithsonian
Institution in Washington.
Shultz announced that the United
States will ask Congress for trade
legislation that would provide for
lowering trade barriers; raising tariffs
to make sure that U.S. exports have
fair access to foreign markets; provide
safeguards, such as import quotas, to
guard against rapid changes in foreign
trade, and to protect the United States
from large and persistent deficits in its
balance of payments.
Although the effect of the U.S.
devaluation is to make the dollar 10
percent lower against other currencies,
the effective change when viewed
against gold prices is a little more than
that because of complicated
mathematical methods of figuring
exchange rates.
The secretary said the United States
is not obliged to intervene in foreign
exchange markets to support the value
of the dollar, as it has been doing in
recent weeks.
The capital controls being phased
out include the interest-equalization
tax and money controls on direct
foreign investments.
The dollar has been falling in value
in recent days, prompting most of the
world's major money markets to close
yesterday. As a result of the slippage,
Americans traveling abroad found
their dollar wasn't buying as much as
before.
Monetary experts from the big
Western nations had been searching for
ways to halt the crisis. They were
talking in terms of seeing the West
German mark and the Japanese yen
floated upward.

a conf?rence at the Smithsonian
Institution in Washington.
Shultz announced that the United
States will ask Congress for trade
legislation that would provide for
lowering trade barriers; raising tariffs
to make sure that U.S. exports have
fair access to foreign markets; provide
safeguards, such as import quotas, to
guard against rapid changes in foreign
trade, and to protect the United States
from large and persistent deficits in its
balance of payments.
Although the effect of the U.S.
devaluation is to make the dollar 10
percent lower against other currencies,
the effective change when viewed
against gold prices is a little more than
that because of complicated
mathematical methods of figuring
exchange rates.
The secretary said the United States
is not obliged to intervene in foreign
exchange markets to support the value
of the dollar, as it has been doing in
recent weeks.
The capital controls being phased
out include the interest-equalization
tax and money controls on direct
foreign investments.
The dollar has been falling in value
in recent days, prompting most of the
world's major money markets to close
yesterday. As a result of the slippage,
Americans traveling abroad found

before.

Western nations had been searching for

WASHINGTON - The United States
devalued the dollar by 10 percent
Monday night, the second drop in
little over a year, in a bold move to
halt the raging international currency
crisis.
Treasury Secretary George P.
Shultz, flanked by other top
administration officials, announced
the devaluation at a late-night news
conference.
He said President Nixon had
approved it and predicted it would
benefit workers, consumers and
businessmen.
In addition, Shultz disclosed a
number of other moves, including a
floating of the Japanese yen, meaning
the yen will be allowed to find its own
market value. The German mark,

another currency under intense
pressure, will keep its present value.
Gold Price Up
The change in the dollar's value is
effective immediately. It will be
achieved by raising the official price of
gold from the present $38 an ounce to
$42.22. The immediate effect of the
change will be to raise the price of
foreign imports into the United States
and lower the price of American goods
shipped to other countries.
The dollar was last devalued on
Dec. 18, 1971, by 8.57 percent against
the price of gold. That devaluation,
part of a worldwide currency
agreement, became unstuck in the past
two weeks.
Monday night's announcement was
made as most of the world's major
money markets remained closed
because of pressure on the dollar. In
places where they had opened earlier
Monday, the dollar fell again in value,
as it has during the crisis. Money
markets are expected to open again
Tuesday.
Imports More Expensive
Shultz also announced that the
United States will phase out by the
end of 1974 its controls on the export
of U.S. capital.
He told the unusual news
conference that the devaluation and
the other moves taken by the Nixon
administration will benefit "the
American working man, businessman
and the consumer."
A dollar devaluation has the effect
of making imports into the United
States more expensive and U.S.
exports to other countries cheaper,
thus giving the nation a better trading
advantage.
'Floating' To Continue
Shultz said other nations may make
changes in the values of their
currencies after announcement of the
American devaluation. Such currency
changes would have to be announced
by the countries involved.
But he said it is likely that
countries with floating currencies,
such as Canada and Great Britain, will

continue with the float.
As for the Japanese currency,
Shultz said, the United States expects
the yen will rise in value against the
dollar over the 10 percent change.
Monday's devaluation was the
second major change in world
currencies since December 1971, when
major non-Communist nations agreed
to a new currency alignment following
a conf?rence at the Smithsonian
