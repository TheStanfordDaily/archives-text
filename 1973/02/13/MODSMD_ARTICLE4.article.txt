# Two Arrested For Theft Of University's Supplies
## 
### JIM WASCHER 
Officers of the Stanford
Department of Public Safety yesterday
arrested Eric Braun Test and Lee
Christian Spieller, both juniors in
biology here, for grand theft, a felony.
Test and Spieller allegedly used
requisition forms stolen from the
office of Manager of Residences and
Fraternities Alan A. Cummings to
order merchandise in the name of
several fraternities. The pair allegedly
sold the merchandise after it was
forwarded from the University Stores
Department.
Both Test and Spieller live at the
Beta Theta Pi fraternity and are
residents of Saratoga, Calif. They were
seized at about 3:30 p.m. yesterday as
they were about to drive away from
the Stores Department with about

$400 in merchandise from the
Department.
Pending arraignment in Santa Clara
County Municipal Court, the two are
being held at the North County
Holding Facility in Palo Alto. Bail will
be set at the arraignment. Grand theft
is punishable by "imprisonment in the
county jail for not more than one year
or in the state prison for not more
than ten years," according to the State
Penal Code.
Cummings said yesterday that his
office began its inquiry into the case
after a fraternity complained of being
charged for supplies which it neither
ordered nor received. Cummings added
that "we discovered three stores
requisition (forms) that had been filled
out and charged to a couple of
fraternities" which had not in fact
ordered that merchandise.

According to Cummings, it is
"unclear at this point" how much
merchandise was taken in this manner,
but he offered a preliminary estimate
"in the $300-400 range." Apparently
this estimate was in addition to those
supplies which Test and Spieller were
taking from the Stores Department
yesterday.
Although Stanford Police Services
Chief Marvin L. Herrington was
unavailable for comment last night,
KZSU News reported that Test and
Spieller were coming out of the Stores
building when a car bearing Herrington
and Captains William Wullschleger and
Frank Benaderet raced into the
parking lot. As Herrington and
Benaderet leaped out to make the
arrest, two other Stanford police cars
blocked off the lot's exits.
