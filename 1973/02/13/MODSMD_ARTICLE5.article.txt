# Student Job Market Termed Tight
## 
### MIKE MALONEY 
"Two problems that are
particularly frustrating for me are
finding enough good jobs for Stanford
students and the students discovering
that even after receiving an AB degree,
they are not prepared to do anything,
consequently no employer is likely to
hire them," says Pam Evans, the newly
appointed director of student
employment.
Evans' principal interest is the
procurement of part-time and summer
employment for Stanford students.
She is a 1967 graduate of Stanford
with an AB degree in History.
In the 50's and 60's the job market
was good. Employers would come to
Stanford with many job offers. "But
with the job market as it is today, you
have to go out and find the jobs," she
says. Even then, restricted budgets and
rising operational costs prohibit many
employers from hiring students, notes
Evans.
Students majoring in the
Humanities are especially hard hit by
the competitive job market. "This
does not mean that you should give up
a major you really enjoy because few
job opportunities exist," says Evans.
"Instead, you might consider taking
courses like economics, engineering, or

mathematics which would make you
more employable."
Back-Up Knowledge
These courses would enable
someone like an Art History major to
have a back-up, in case nothing is
available in his field. "It is really
rewarding when I am able to talk with
students and they realize the
importance of taking courses which
will improve their chances for
employment," Evans reveals.
This year's student, especially one
with a major in the Humanities, will
have problems finding part-time and
summer employment.
Students who have no practical
experience or previous clerical or
typing skills are not likely to find
well-paying employment. Evans
mentions that students who are
seeking employment for financial
reasons should not limit themselves to
considering only one area of
employment.
Companies Won't Train
Companies, as a rule, do not like to
hire a student, for the summer period,
who has to be trained in basic skills
and then is on his way after a few
short months. Only when the
company feels it is making an

PLACEMENT DILEMMA — Pam Evans, the new director of student
employment says the employment situation has been getting progressively worse
over the past several years, particularly for Humanities students. One of the big
problems, she added, is that many graduates lack readily salable skills that many
employers desire.
investment in a student who may
decide to join the business after
graduation will it compromise its
employment standards.
There are, of course, certain jobs
that require absolutely no background
experience such as construction work
or manual labor. "One problem in
finding part-time or summer
employment in these areas is that the
student is not only competing with
professional people who are
unemployed but also with a growing
number of college and high school
students," says Evans.
"If you are unable to procure a
basic skill or part-time employment
before this summer, the best advice I
can give you is to be incredibly
persistent," advises Evans. "Because
our offices are constantly busy, if a
student comes in only once to ask
about employment we are not likely
to know or remember him.
"The student who continually
frequents our office is usually the one
we get to know and consequently, he
is remembered and contacted more
often as employment opportunities
become available. Therefore, it is to
the student's advantage to continually
check with our offices for new job
listings," Evans says.
Students Need Money
Stanford students are in need of
part-time and summer employment for
many reasons. "Financial reasons have
become increasingly important,
because of rising tuition," remarks
Evans.
Students with scholarships not only
need to earn money, but are often

expected to as a condition for
continued financial assistance.
Students who do not qualify for
financial aid, often see their parents
financially drained because of the high
tuition. For these students part-time
and summer employment can be
crucial.
A number of Stanford students are
looking for some type of practical
experience before graduation. "These
students hope this background
experience will help them secure a
higher paying position," Evans says.
