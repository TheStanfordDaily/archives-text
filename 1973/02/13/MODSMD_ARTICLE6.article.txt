## National News 
### 
If you care about state, national, and world events, and read the
Daily, I feel sorry for you. You may have wondered why the Daily
doesn't treat more than one or two non-campus stories a week in
regular news format, when in most papers national and world news
dominates the front page. So have I.
There are those of us at the Daily who are trying to make this into
a real newspaper, and sometimes we feel like we're knocking our
heads against a brick wall.
I have been trying for two years, ever since I joined the Daily, to
obtain an explanation as to why this newspaper, unlike others, does
not treat world and national events in customary news format. I have
never received a satisfactory explanation for the relegation of all
except the most extra-ordinary non-campus events to the pitifully
small "AP News Summary" box on the back page.
Readership
Most Daily readers do not also read the Chronicle. After our rather
thorough readership survey in 1971, everyone here ought to know
that. It's an utter mystery to me why the Daily doesn't operate on the
basis of that fact and treat world and national affairs as other
newspapers do.
We also know that in that readership survey, the one item our
readers most wanted increased was world and national news. So, I'm
told that I ought to be glad for the improvement over the last two
years. I'm not.
To me, the "AP News Summary" seems roughly analogous to the
"colored section" at the rear of a Mississippi city bus in decades past.
The improvements over the last two years have been akin to
expanding the "colored section" from the rear two rows of seats to
the rear three rows. No wonder those of us who want the Daily to be
a real newspaper haven't been pacified.
You Can't Shoot A Bank
The fact that editors come and go without the policy changing, and
that nobody can even give a valid reason for the policy, calls to mind
the scene early in John Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath in which the
tenant farmers see a tractor sent by the landowner come rolling over
the land, destroying everything the tenants have built with their labor.
Someone suggests shooting the tractor driver, but another tenant
points out that the owner would just send out a new driver. In the
end, the policy that dictates the evictions is made by a bank, and you
can't shoot a bank.
It's the same way here. Nobody suggests shooting the editor, of
course, but the Daily's policy, like the bank's, seems to have a life of
its own, and exactly who is in control doesn't make much difference.
The fact that the Daily is directed to an academic community
would seem to call for a larger-than-average commitment to world and
national news. But, instead, you and I get the "AP News Summary"
which is, frankly, an insult to our intelligence, and one which makes
the Daily look like a Mom-'n'-Pop rural county seat newspaper.
If you feel as I do, let the Daily editorial staff know. I'm convinced
that the Daily can become a real newspaper, provided its readers make
their wishes known.
