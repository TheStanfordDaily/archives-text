# 'A Step In The Right Direction'
## The 						Nixon Budget 
### 
* Chris Hocker

President Nixon's proposed
new federal budget has sent waves
of horror through liberals,
tremors of hope through
conservatives, and shivers of
ambiguity through libertarians.
No one really likes taxes, with
the exception of those whose
salaries and other benefits are paid
for out of them. Yet Americans
have traditionally been
extraordinarily quiescent when it
comes to paying taxes. Large-scale
taxpayers' revolts are virtually
unknown in our history. Those
small groups whose declared
intent is to repeal the income tax
are generally looked upon as
right-wing fringe groups or other
varieties of crazies.
There has never been the
national indifference to the
necessity for taxpaying that there
is, for example, in Italy, where
millions of citizens never bother
to file returns and the
government, strangled with
bureaucratic impotence, never
catches up with them. "I work
hard and I pay my taxes" is the
statement ascribed to Middle
America.
Annoyance
Nevertheless, as pointed out by
Bill Evers in his Daily column of
last week ("Fat in Nixon's New
Budget"), an undercurrent of
annoyance about rising taxes has
provided an excuse for President
Nixon to cut back many federal

programs that have swelled the
budget into the hundreds of
billions of dollars within the past
few years.
Even in the early years of the
Johnson Administration, the
federal budget was held below
$100 billion. But now that figure
has nearly tripled. Approximately
30% of the average salary is eaten
up by taxes, most of which
represent federal expenditures.
The new Nixon budget is a
serious and sincere attempt to halt
the rising taxation spiral, and the
major areas of cutback appear in
programs of Health, Education
and Welfare and Housing and
Urban Development. The military
budget, on the other hand,
remains about the same, although
its relative size to the total tax
dollar has been reduced.
Alarm and Delight
These developments alarm
liberals, who prefer a drastic
decrease in military expenditures
and at least a continuation of
welfare and related subsidies.
Conservatives, who have always
felt the need for a strong military
program, are delighted. And
libertarians, who oppose taxation
on principle, see the new budget
to be a step in the right direction,
though a feeble step in relation to
the hugeness of the federal bite
that remains.
The liberal plea for retention

of so-called "social services" can
be refuted by the repeated
historical evidence of failure by
the government to act effectively
as omniscient Father for his
backward children. To cite just
one example of many, the
infamous Pruitt-Igoe project in
the St. Louis ghetto is a classic
case of the impropriety of
government attempting to solve
the problem of housing.
Pruitt-Igoe was built in the late
1950s as a public housing project
for inner-city dwellers. The
project consisted of several
high-rise apartment buildings
administered by the federal
government and paid for, of
course, out of millions of
taxpayer dollars. Within a few
years, the Pruitt-Igoe dream was
turned into a nightmare when
those for whom the project was
intended refused to live there. The
buildings became run down and
largely vacant. The incidence of
crime, including stabbings,
muggings, vandalism, and rape,
rose to phenomenal heights.
Pruitt-Igoe became a high-rise
ghost town.
Dynamited
Finally, last year, the
Pruitt-Igoe buildings were
destroyed, dynamited by the
federal government at the cost of
several million dollars, paid for
byâ€”guess who?
Despite countless such
examples, the demand continues
for federally-subsidized housing
and other welfare programs which
have no chance to succeed
because of (1) governmental
distortion of the market, which,
when left alone, provides jobs and
housing, though perhaps not as
some would outline them, and (2)
institutional incompetence
necessarily brought on by
bureaucracy.
Military programs, too, suffer
their share of waste, inefficiency
and corruption, as revealed by
recent Senate investigations. Even
hawks such as Barry Goldwater
and John Stennis have gone on
record in favor of eliminating the
layers of fat that surround
military appropriations.
But it does not follow from
this that the money saved from
military programs should be
rechanneled into domestic
programs. That money should be
left in the hands of the taxpayers,
to dispose of as they individually
see fit.
