# Dean Hargadon Reports Increase In Applications
## 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
Dean of Admissions Fred Hargadon
reported last night that despite a trend
towards public schools in many areas
due to the increasing costs of private
education, current applications here
have increased by six percent over last
year. More than 9200 people have
applied for 1450 openings in next
year's freshman class.
Speaking on KZSU's "Campus
Conference," Hargadon claimed that
"we don't have much evidence" that
middle class students are in danger of
being excluded by tuition hikes at
Stanford. "I don't think we've ever
turned an 'admit' back into another
category because of a financial aid
need we couldn't meet."
He stated that information about
an applicant's financial background is
sent directly to the Financial Aids
office and when the admissions office
reviews applications, "We don't know
what applicants need or if they even
need aid to attend Stanford."
Hargadon reiterated that his office
seeks a socio-economic balance among
the students it admits and added that
"it is a very difficult notion to
determine what is middle class or

middle income. We're as sympathetic
as any admissions office to applicants
from middle income families."
Colleges On The Defensive
"Colleges and universities have been
too much on the defensive in this area.
One doesn't read about middle class or
middle income families being squeezed
out of houses, autos and stereo sets.
Higher education is a consumer
choice." Hargadon added that he is
often "disappointed" that in a large
number of applicants' families, "many
luxury- consumer choices are fulfilled
long before the question of higher
education comes up."
Hargadon has recently defended
Stanford's continued use of Scholastic
Aptitude Test (SAT) scores in
evaluation of applicants and last night
he denied that his appointment in
October to the Board of Trustees of
the College Entrance Examination
Board (CEEB) created a
conflict-of-interest in this area.
He said he has attended only one
CEEB meeting as a trustee and"I did
not get any sense of people sitting
around making people offers they
couldn't refuse."

In response to a question about the
power of the CEEB, he said that "they
do not take a position on what
admissions officers should do with
these tests. I don't think they see
themselves as determining where
students go to college."
In judging an applicant's academic
qualifications, Hargadon said that
SAT's are taken into consideration
along with grades, number of courses
taken, strength of a secondary school's
academic program, and Advanced
Placement scores."
Looks For Excellence
In making admissions decisions,
Hargadon said that his office primarily
tries to determine "how well
candidates use the resources available
to them. We also try for excellence
and excellence comes in a variety of
ways."
According to Hargadon, after
members of the admissions office staff
complete their "first readings" of
applications, 1000 applicants are
usually placed in the "admit" category
while about 3000 are usually placed in
the "reject" category. The rest of the
candidates are placed in the "swim"
category. "A lot swim for an awful
long time and we swim for an awful
long time."
On the subject of quotas, Hargadon
said that "the policy of the University
is not to have quotas, at least as far as
the policy has been articulated to me.
At the undergraduate level, we do not
operate with quotas of any kind. In no
case would we admit a student we
didn't think had a reasonable chance
of fulfilling the curriculum
requirements here."
He said that around 1968 or earlier,
many colleges and universities began
to feel that there were certain groups
of people who didn't apply because
they felt they wouldn't be admitted.
Hargadon said that the most obvious
underrepresented groups here were
''black students and
Mexican-American students in
California. We are trying to get a
message out that Stanford is one
school they might come to for their
education."
