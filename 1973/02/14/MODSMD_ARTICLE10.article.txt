Keep Beutelsbach
Editor:
The report on the Overseas
Campuses meets many of our
suggestions for the improvement
of the program. There is, however,
one proposal made in the report
that could, in our opinion, prove to
be very harmful for the German
program. The report says that if
there is to be any German campus
it should be moved from
Beutelsbach to an urban
community.
Beutelsbach in fact is close to
one of the major urban centers of
West Germany, the city of
Stuttgart (only 30 minutes by
train). At Stuttgart students find a
big and expanding university, the
Max-Planck-Institut, theaters, a
world famous chamber orchestra,
one of the top ballet companies,
museums, galleries etc. Stuttgart is
not only a cultural but also the
economic, political and industrial
heart of Southwest Germany.
Thus, while the campus is located

in a non-urban environment,
students have an easy access to
urban institutions.
At the same time they live in
close contact with the small
community of Beutelsbach, which
has always given very strong
support to the family program
that provides every student with
the opportunity of becoming
intimately acquainted with a
German speaking local family.
The family program at
Beutelsbach has always been
appreciated by students as
something extraordinary and as
helpful in understanding
Germany. For weekend travel the
Swabian countryside offers many
places of great attraction.
The report says that students
should get a real understanding of
the host culture. The basis of
German culture is rural rather
than urban. Most of the great
German poets and philosophers
have lived and worked in small
towns; this is particularly true of
Swabia, the home of Schiller,
Hoelderlin, Hegel and Hesse. No
single city represents all of the
periods of German history and its
cultural development as a whole.
Germany never had a capital
comparable to London, Paris, or
Rome.
A campus at Berlin (and even a
campus at Munich) would be an
isolated campus. It is very
doubtful whether in an urban
environment a family program
could be run successfully. To have
students live in the center of one
of these cities would cut them off
from the sources of German
culture and deprive them of a
singular experience.

Garvin Inaccurate
Editor:
Glenn Garvin's letter about
Larry Diamond in last Thursday's
Daily is inaccurate in at least one
respect.
It was Paul McCloskey, not Jim
Stewart, who told us many times
he wanted to retain the draft in all
its glory. Jim Stewart favors an
immediate end to the draft.
(Could anyone in this intelligent
Stanford community have voted
in the last election assuming
Stewart's and McCloskey's
positions were exactly the
opposite of what they were and
are?)

I also disagree with Garvin's
allegations that Larry Diamond
exerted effort to rid the campus
of ROTC and keep
DoD-contracted firms out of the
Placement Center. One must
consider both what Larry
Diamond said about these issues
and what concrete things he did
about them. (Can anyone who
witnessed Larry Diamond's
actions during political struggles
at Stanford not know where he
stood and stands?)
As for Garvin's statement
about coercive fee assessments, it
is true as far as it goes. However,
at the end of his term as ASSU
co-president, Diamond changed
his mind and came out in favor of
voluntary fee assessments.

Libertarian Clarification
Editor:
We are writing in the hope of
clearing up a possible
misunderstanding about
libertarian doctrine that readers of
the Daily might have gotten from
Glenn Garvin's letter (Feb. 8).
Some people have the mistaken
impression that the sort of
individual liberty that libertarians
talk about includes toleration of
those who have initiated a
physical attack on someone else
or have threatened to do so. On
the contrary, libertarians view
such persons as criminals and
would have them punished.
The question of whether a
person is a criminal or whether an
organization like a Mafia family,
or the U.S. Army, or a company
manufacturing anti-personnel
weapons, is engaged
systematically in criminal
activities is an empirical question.
But no libertarian who believes
in the natural rights of man would
contend that after the objective
reality of someone's guilt has been
established, he should then be
treated as anything other than a
criminal. A criminal loses his
rights in proportion to his
violation of other people's rights.
Total freedom is the right only of
innocent non-aggressors.

Gymnastic Excellence
Editor:
After reading the Jan. 29 Daily
article on my departure from
Stanford and the gymnastics team,
some thoughts rested uneasily in
my mind.
I was naturally pleased to
receive some recognition for my
efforts for four years at Stanford
in connection with the
improvement of the gymnastics
program.
However, Stanford's present
prowess as a nationally ranked
gymnastics power is now a
reflection of Sadao
Hamada—whom I feel is one of
the few outstanding coaches in
the country.
It is not an easy thing, to begin
coaching a fine team such as
Stanford's. If the team doesn't do
as well "as expected," the
community often looks to the
coach. And there may be a
misguided tendency to give the
old coach inordinate credit if the
team does well.
I understand that Sadao is a
very professional coach, and that
the team is training harder than
ever before, I know for a fact that
Sadao is bringing certain aspects
of coaching to the team that I
could not offer. Stanford is
indeed fortunate to have him.
Of course, we must remember
that a coach is only a guide—and
no coach, old or new, can take
final "credit" for a team's
excellence—that rests with the
dedicated individuals in the gym
each day, training diligently
towards their own satisfaction and
growth.
