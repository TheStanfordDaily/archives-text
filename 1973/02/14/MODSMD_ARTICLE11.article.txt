# 'Right To Be Informed'
## In Favor Of Shield Laws 
### 
Alan Cranston

Shield laws to protect a
reporter's confidential news
sources have been called special
interest legislation for the press.
That view couldn't be more
wrong. The over-riding issue in the
news source controversy is the
basic right of every American to
be informed. ,
As a wire-service correspondent
in Hitler's Germany and
Mussolini's Italy, I learned just
how important to the public a
reporter's news sources can be. I
gained information about the
inner workings of fascist
government in the late 1930s that
never would have been told had I
not been able to assure my
informants that I would keep
their names in confidence. My

sources would have lost their jobs,
their freedom—and maybe even
their lives—if it had been known
that they were granting
information.
Wrong-Doing
Wrong-doing in high places, in
and out of government, has been
uncovered by the nation's press
with the help of confidential news
sources. In Boston, for example,
an investigative news team came
up with information that resulted
in, among other things, 119
indictments against 27
people—including three former
city mayors and a city auditor.
'This wouldn't have happened
without help from confidential
sources," stated the editor in
charge of the team. Protecting
those sources is essential for the
sake of law and order and justice
in a free society.
The Contra Costa Times warns
that if the media is required to
divulge confidential news sources,
those sources will "literally dry
up. . . and make it all but
impossible to keep the public
informed about the actions of the
instrument the people themselves
have created—government."
Watch-Dog
The news media performs a
vital watch-dog function in our
system of government. If the news
media's ability to carry out that
function is impaired in any
manner, it is the public who will
suffer in the end.
It is no accident that a free
press is banned in any
dictatorship. A closed society
cannot exist where a fiercely
independent press probes and
investigates, questions and
criticizes. A free society demands
a press that sheds daylight on
shaded or shady areas of both

private and public life.
We Americans must know how
our government is spending our
money and influencing our way of
life. A free press is the bridge
crossing the chasm between the
public's need to know, and
officialdom that is corrupt or
unresponsive. A reporter's news
sources keep that bridge standing.
Only a law that grants newsmen
total immunity to protect news
sources will work. Any single
loophole will inevitably open
other loopholes until the
protection is utterly destroyed or
useless.
