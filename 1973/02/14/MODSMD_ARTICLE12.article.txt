THE STANFORD DAILY is an independent student newspaper
owned and published by The Stanford Daily Publishing Corporation

Editorials represent the opinion of a majority vote by the Daily
editorial board, composed of 17 editors and four at-large members
elected by the staff.
Letters, columns and cartoons on the opinions pages represent
only the views of their authors.
Nothing on the opinions page represents a position of the Daily
staff, the ASSU or the University.
