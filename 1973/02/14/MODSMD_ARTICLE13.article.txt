# Lyman Discusses 'The Student Problem'
## 
### 
(Editor's Note: The following
remarks were delivered by
President Richard Lyman at a Los
Angeles alumni conference at the
Century Plaza Hotel last Sunday.)
"For the past half-dozen years
or so, the Student Problem has
been the uppermost thing on the
mind of anyone upon meeting a
college president. Newspeople
especially. It got to the point
where beleaguered presidents were
raising the subject first, in the
hope—usually a vain one—that
they could that way retain some
shreds of the initiative, or at least
set the stage for the bad news as
gently as possible.
"For some time now, however,
media people have tended to raise
the subject almost nostalgically:
'Is it true that things are all quiet
how?' they'll ask, as if they half
hoped one would surprise them
by saying 'no,' and then they'd be
back on familiar ground—the
unsolicited riot, the
non-negotiable demand, the
unreprimanded blackmail of the
academic process. But in fact the
answer tends to be 'Yes, students
generally are quieter, more
introspective, and more serious
about their work.' For some
newsmen it probably seems like
losing an old friend, not to have
the campus revolution the biggest
show in town.
"(Let me hasten to say that
there are a good many honorable
exceptions. To name an
outstanding one, BillTrombley of
the Los Angeles Times, whose
comprehensive and probing
interest in higher education is
what one would expect from one
of the world's truly great
newspapers.)
"As for alumni audience, I find
they're deeply concerned about a
whole range of problems, from
the tuition scramble to the
question of how to preserve the
liberal arts while at the same time
equipping young people to play a
useful part in the world of
business, government, and the
professions.
"I've nevertheless chosen to
talk about students today, not
because they're embattled, but
because they are a very large part
of what the University is all
about, and because the subject is
endlessly interesting. It is, after
all, perhaps our strongest common
bond throughout this room. We've
all been students (and many of us
no doubt still are); we all know
other students; a lot of us are
supporting students—oh, how
we're supporting them!
'Supporting,' that's spelled with a
large 'S': that has two vertical
lines through it—a Capital'S,' one
might say.
"As you all know, Stanford is a
selective university. Cass &
Birnbaum, Comparative Guide to
American Colleges, is the bible of
the college entrance seeker, the
kind of book you find in a
bookstore with all the pages
well-thumbed even before anyone
has bought it. Cass & Birnbaum
put us in their highest category,
'Most Selective.' And thereby
hang some tales.
"(I'll have to use a few
numbers in this talk. Be reassured,
no higher mathematics will sneak
in-I'm personally too close to
being mathematically illiterate—or
innumerate—for that.)
'Most Selective.' For
undergraduates, that comes from

the fact that we get over 9,000
completed applications, admit
around 2,300, of whom
two-thirds actually show up to
enroll in September. A little over
twenty years ago, 85 percent of
the applicants to Stanford's
freshman class got admitted. Over
the last half-dozen years that
figure has hovered 1 around 25
percent.
"It's not possible to say
exactly how the 2,300 were culled
from the 9,000. No single
criterion applies. Academic
achievement and potential
obviously constitute the most
important single variable. But a
variety of other qualities are
sought, and found. Lately the
Dean of Admissions has been
looking particularly hard at things
like evidence of capacity to take
on and carry out a job—what
non-academics might call 'real
world experience.'(l've never been
able to see quite how the
University was exempt from being
part of the Real World. Certainly
our problems are real enough;
maybe it's the solutions that
sometimes seem unreal.)
"This year's freshman
class—the class of '76—doesn't
that add years to your age just to
hear?—this class came to Stanford
from 829 secondary schools, the
largest number ever. That reflects
Stanford's conscious effort to
spread the word, and not to
concentrate it in a few arbitrarily
chosen places. The freshmen come
from 44 states and the District of

Columbia, plus quite a number of
foreign lands. Overthree-fourthsof
them went to public high schools,
less than one-fourth to private
schools. Sixty per cent are men,
forty per cent are women. This
quite closely parallels the balance
of the sexes in the total pool of
applicants. There are now no
quotas or targets for either sex in
undergraduate admissions. The
gradual reduction to zero of
discrimination against women has
meant that the number of women
undergraduates at Stanford has
increased 27 percent since 1968,
while the total undergraduate
enrollment has gone up only 5
perent in that same time.
"Interestingly, this rise in
woman power hasn't meant a
corresponding drop in
enrollemtnts in such allegedly
non-feminine subjects as the
so-called hard sciences. Principles
of Biology enrolled some 500
students this Fall, a fifth more
than last year. The Chemistry
Department is relieved to find
that their introductory courses
have leveled off at 900, after
doubling in just two years.
Everybody wants to be a
Doctor—that's the shorthand
explanation. But I think
recognition that you don't get
very far by ducking the tough
academic challenges has
something to do with it, too.
"At the same time we're
remaining so selective, we've
clearly diversified the student
body greatly. I've mentioned the
rise of the women. You're all
aware of Stanford's effort, in high
gear since 1968, to find talented
students from among the hitherto
excluded and disadvantaged of
our society. Blacks, Chicanos and
American Indians now total about
15 percent of the undergraduate
student body.
"Has all of this, plus the
inexorable rise of tuition year
after year, meant that the great
American middle class is being
squeezed out? That's the question
I encounter most often in talking
about admissions, selectivity, and
so forth.
"Well, at risk of sounding
incurably academic, I have to say
that the picture isn't terribly clear
at this point. Until this year, we
thought we had a slightly ominous
clue in a rising attrition
rate—more students dropping out
after each quarter, so that by
Spring there were only B'/2
undergraduates left out of every
one hundred who had started in
the Fall. (Don't ask me where that
half-student had gone.) But this
year that mini-trend seems likely
to slow down, perhaps to stop.
"Of course even if they leave
you can't be sure why. Everyone
knows about Joe X, or Suzy Y
who transferred to UC because
the Stanford tuition got too
tough . But when we did a survey
last summer to see why one third
of the students whom we had
admitted went elsewhere, the
results didn't suggest that tuition
was the main problem. More than
one-quarter of the respondents
had chosen either a certain East
Coast conglomerate known as
Harvard-Radcliffe or its arch-rival,
Yale; about half chose other and
comparably expensive private
colleges; only a quarter wen to
publicly supported universities,
where tuition is low or nearly
non-existent.

"On the other hand, there were
signs of what one might call
middle class tuition resistance in
that a somewhat higher
proportion of those who were in
middle income brackets gave
finances as the primary reason for
going elsewhere than was the case
in either the lowest or the highest
brackets.
"So we're keeping a wary eye
on this problem. On the one hand,
it's hard to see why we should not

raise tuition for those in a
position to pay, when it still falls
considerably short of the cost of a
Stanford education in any field,
and when the cost of everything
we buy and the wages of everyone
we hire keep on rising. On the
other hand, we know that there is
real hardship at the margins of
eligibility for scholarship help. We
know also that it's tough to find a
formula for perfect justice. Why,
for instance, should we favor a
family in which only one parent
works, and there's considerable
indebtedness, over one in which
both parents work and the house
and car and color TV are all paid
for? Yet we do. But trying to find
the need formula that's fair
to all is a task for Solomon, and
though there are literally no less
than five people named Solomon
in this year's Faculty
Staff-Directory, none of them has
as yet solved our problem for us.

"Nearly five out of eleven
Stanford students are graduate
students of one kind or another.
This tends sometimes to be
forgotten, so strong is the
mythology of the undergraduate
years in American life. Did these
graduate students have as tough a
time getting in as the freshmen?
"It's hard to generalize. In
some of the professional schools,
the ratio of applicants to admitted
students was steeper still, steeper
than the Matterhorn, and about as
slippery. For 1971-72, over 3,000
people applied to the M.D.
program at the Stanford Medical
School. One hundred forty-three
were admitted, of whom slightly
more than one-half enrolled.
3,000 applicants, seventy-five
students at the end of the great
winnowing process. That's a lot of
disappointed people. And it's got
worse since—nearly 3,700
applicants for this year's class.
"Law is not quite so grim.
Instead of having only one chance
in 21 of being admitted, you had
just a hair more than one chance
in 10 if you applied to the
Stanford Law School in 1971.
"And so it goes. Not
uniformly—the odds are much
more in your favor if you pick
Engineering or Earth Sciences.
But that reflects a general,
national decline in interest in, and
preparedness for, those fields. I
suspect this will turn around when
young people start discovering
that nationally we'll soon be
graduating only about two-thirds
of the engineers we need. An
old-fashioned instrument called
the marketplace will begin to
make itself felt. And the challenge
of actually solving environmental
or energy problems, instead of
just wringing one's hands about
them, should play a part, too.
"Now what does all this mean?
do all these numbers mean that
the main thing is growth, and still
more growth? Do they mean that
all we're focusing on is more of
the same—more selectivity, larger
numbers of disappointed
applicants left out in the cold,
tougher standards of admission,
just so we can brag about ourselves
and feel that because so many
people want in—and because we're
so expensive—we must be good?
"To begin with, we could no
doubt ease the pressure by
admitting more students, letting
ourselves grow larger. We don't
choose to do this. For several
years Stanford has been hovering
around 11,000 to 11,500 total
students (exclusing the so-called
terminal graduate students—not a
fatal disease, just the condition
you'r n in when you've finished
your residence requirements but
not licked the dissertation yet).
One of the clearcut advantages of
the private college or university is
that it need not grow in response

would it make not to exercise care
in selecting those potential
students who are best equipped to
make intelligent and productive
use of these academic resources?
It doesn't bother me if our
students of English are articulate
before they get to us, or if some
of our would-be engineers have
been playing scales on the slide
rule since the age of six. It would
bother me if one had to be a
genius to have a reasonable chance
for admission—but that isn't so. I
ask your indulgence to quote
from a document many of you
have probably read—a letter which
Fred Hargadon, Dean of
Admissions, sends to prospective
applicants. . . we can (and do)
exercise judgments relating to
factors over and above academic
ability in selecting a freshman
class,' he writes. (Some day I'll
pick a bone with Fred about that
'over and above'—l'd prefer
'beyond'or simply and colorlessly
'other than' since as an academic I

to every demand of the moment.
We're not planning to throw that
advantage out.
"But we're not in love with
selectivity for its own sake, either.
Quite a number of critics of
higher education have been
pointing out lately that it's small
wonder the best colleges tend to
turn out an unfair share of the
best-equipped graduates—they
only accept the best-equipped
applicants to begin with. We are,
so the criticism goes, guilty of
making silk purses out of silk.
"I'm afraid my chief response
to that is, 'Sure, why not?' The
leading colleges and universities,
whether public or private, have
gone to considerable lengths to
bring together the most talented
faculty they could find, to build
great library collections, to
develop formidable laboratories
and computer facilities, and so on.
Having done this, what sense

have trouble placing
other considerations, however
important, clearly 'above'
academic ability in this context,
and I'm fairly sure that Fred does
too. He gets equal time in the
panel this afternoon, if I've
misrepresented him.) Anyhow,
Fred goes on to cite
'exceptionally well developed
talents in areas such as the arts,
music, athletics, and leadership,'
and also to stress 'diversity in
backgrounds, values, and
educational objectives.' '. . . we
recognize a broad range of
excellence, realizing that
excellence itself does not always
and everywhere come in uniform
dimensions.' To that I can only
say, Amen...
"Still, the efforts include
attention to diversity, and to
opening up opportunity to people
who haven't had much of it until
recently. It's significant that the
Stanford School of
Engineering,which enrolls about 4
percent of the total graduate
student population of the United
States in engineering, enrolls some
7 percnet of the country's total of
women engineering graduate
students. Also that when Stanford
awarded six master's degree
candidates in all fields of
engineering in the entire nation.
Clearly, to paraphrase Robert
Frost, we have 'miles to go before
we sleep.'
"Diversity has another
dimension worth exploring: age.
"What is being said nowadays
on this subject is familiar enough:
that less and less will education
beyond the high school be
confined to the traditional time
periods; more and more people
will 'stop out' from time to time,
and correspondingly more will
re-enter colleges and universities
after periods, often long periods,
of working for a living. Married
women, their children grown up,
will return to refurbish old skills
or obtain new ones. Refresher
courses of all sorts and sizes will
be needed in the seemingly
endless fight we all face to stave
off personal obsolescence in the
age of future shock.
"Stanford is not likely to
become a vast center for

'extension courses' in the old
meaning of the term. But even
now the University, or parts of it,
are doing more than is generally
recognized to reach out to alumni
and others who are past the
traditional college-going years.
The Observer for January covered
these efforts well, and I shan't try
to repeat it all. From the Summer
Alumni College, through the
volumes entitled Portable
Stanford, to specialized and
concentrated refresher programs
in the Medical School and the
Graduate School of Business,
continuing education goes on in
many forms. I might point to the
obvious: You've shown your
interest in it by coming here
today.
"The point is that Stanford
must reach out to all—and they
are a rapidly growing
number—who see their University
as something more than a place to
look back upon with nostalgia, or
a place where strange and
incomprehensible young people
are doing strange and
incomprehensible things. There's
nothing quite so good for

lowering the incomprehensibility
level than to be learning together.
"What does it all add up to? A
university with a number of
different kinds of education going
on for the benefit of an ever
greater variety of students, but
linked through a common focus
upon quality. The focus doesn't
always work; even with
admissions ratios like ten to one
or twenty to one, not every
student who comes to Stanford
finds it was the right choice. (And
Stanford has now and then been
known to entertain a twinge of
doubt as to its end of the deal, for
that matter.) The difficulty of
pursuing quality in a great variety
of educational enterprises is
always there; the difficulty these
days in finding the resources to
support high quality is something
of which we're all too sharply
aware. But a university, any
university, is principally the
people who com rose it. Given
that fact, it seems to me Stanford
has every reason to feel at least a
sober confidence as it faces the
future."

"Yes, students generally are quieter, more introsoective,
and more serious about their work. For some newsmen
it probably seems like losing an old friend, not to have
the campus revolution the biggest show in town."

to that is, 'Sure, why not?' The
leading colleges and universities,
whether public or private, have
gone to considerable lengths to
bring together the most talented
faculty they could find, to build
great library collections, to
develop formidable laboratories
and computer facilities, and so on.
Having done this, what sense

have trouble placing
other considerations, however
important, clearly 'above'
academic ability in this context,
and I'm fairly sure that Fred does
too. He gets equal time in the
panel this afternoon, if I've
misrepresented him.) Anyhow,
Fred goes on to cite
'exceptionally well developed
talents in areas such as the arts,
music, athletics, and leadership,'
and also to stress 'diversity in
backgrounds, values, and
educational objectives.' '. . . we
recognize a broad range of
excellence, realizing that
excellence itself does not always
and everywhere come in uniform
dimensions.' To that I can only
say, Amen...
"Still, the efforts include
attention to diversity, and to
opening up opportunity to people
who haven't had much of it until
recently. It's significant that the
Stanford School of
Engineering,which enrolls about 4
percent of the total graduate
student population of the United
States in engineering, enrolls some
7 percnet of the country's total of
women engineering graduate
students. Also that when Stanford
awarded six master's degree
candidates in all fields of
engineering in the entire nation.
Clearly, to paraphrase Robert
Frost, we have 'miles to go before
we sleep.'
"Diversity has another
dimension worth exploring: age.
"What is being said nowadays
on this subject is familiar enough:
that less and less will education
beyond the high school be
confined to the traditional time
periods; more and more people
will 'stop out' from time to time,
and correspondingly more will
re-enter colleges and universities
after periods, often long periods,
of working for a living. Married
women, their children grown up,
will return to refurbish old skills
or obtain new ones. Refresher
courses of all sorts and sizes will
be needed in the seemingly
endless fight we all face to stave
off personal obsolescence in the
age of future shock.
"Stanford is not likely to
become a vast center for

'extension courses' in the old
meaning of the term. But even
now the University, or parts of it,
are doing more than is generally
recognized to reach out to alumni
and others who are past the
traditional college-going years.
The Observer for January covered
these efforts well, and I shan't try
to repeat it all. From the Summer
Alumni College, through the
volumes entitled Portable
Stanford, to specialized and
concentrated refresher programs
in the Medical School and the
Graduate School of Business,
continuing education goes on in
many forms. I might point to the
obvious: You've shown your
interest in it by coming here
today.
"The point is that Stanford
must reach out to all—and they
are a rapidly growing
number—who see their University
as something more than a place to
look back upon with nostalgia, or
a place where strange and
incomprehensible young people
are doing strange and
incomprehensible things. There's
nothing quite so good for

lowering the incomprehensibility
level than to be learning together.
"What does it all add up to? A
university with a number of
different kinds of education going
on for the benefit of an ever
greater variety of students, but
linked through a common focus
upon quality. The focus doesn't
always work; even with
admissions ratios like ten to one
or twenty to one, not every
student who comes to Stanford
finds it was the right choice. (And
Stanford has now and then been
known to entertain a twinge of
doubt as to its end of the deal, for
that matter.) The difficulty of
pursuing quality in a great variety
of educational enterprises is
always there; the difficulty these
days in finding the resources to
support high quality is something
of which we're all too sharply
aware. But a university, any
university, is principally the
people who com rose it. Given
that fact, it seems to me Stanford
has every reason to feel at least a
sober confidence as it faces the
future."

"Yes, students generally are quieter, more introsoective,
and more serious about their work. For some newsmen
it probably seems like losing an old friend, not to have
the campus revolution the biggest show in town."

"The point is that Stanford must reach out to all—and
they are a rapidly growing number-who see their
University as something more than a place to look back

incomprehensible young people are doing strange and
incomprehensible things."
(Editor's Note: The following
remarks were delivered by
President Richard Lyman at a Los
Angeles alumni conference at the
Century Plaza Hotel last Sunday.)
"For the past half-dozen years
or so, the Student Problem has
been the uppermost thing on the
mind of anyone upon meeting a
college president. Newspeople
especially. It got to the point
where beleaguered presidents were
raising the subject first, in the
hope—usually a vain one—that
they could that way retain some
shreds of the initiative, or at least
set the stage for the bad news as
gently as possible.
"For some time now, however,
media people have tended to raise
the subject almost nostalgically:
'Is it true that things are all quiet
how?' they'll ask, as if they half
hoped one would surprise them
by saying 'no,' and then they'd be
back on familiar ground—the
unsolicited riot, the
non-negotiable demand, the
unreprimanded blackmail of the
academic process. But in fact the
answer tends to be 'Yes, students
generally are quieter, more
introspective, and more serious
about their work.' For some
newsmen it probably seems like
losing an old friend, not to have
the campus revolution the biggest
show in town.
"(Let me hasten to say that
there are a good many honorable
exceptions. To name an
outstanding one, BillTrombley of
the Los Angeles Times, whose
comprehensive and probing
interest in higher education is
what one would expect from one
of the world's truly great
newspapers.)
"As for alumni audience, I find
they're deeply concerned about a
whole range of problems, from
the tuition scramble to the
question of how to preserve the
liberal arts while at the same time
equipping young people to play a
useful part in the world of
business, government, and the
professions.
"I've nevertheless chosen to
talk about students today, not
because they're embattled, but
because they are a very large part
of what the University is all
about, and because the subject is
endlessly interesting. It is, after
all, perhaps our strongest common
bond throughout this room. We've
all been students (and many of us
no doubt still are); we all know
other students; a lot of us are
supporting students—oh, how
we're supporting them!
'Supporting,' that's spelled with a
large 'S': that has two vertical
lines through it—a Capital'S,' one
might say.
"As you all know, Stanford is a
selective university. Cass &
Birnbaum, Comparative Guide to
American Colleges, is the bible of
the college entrance seeker, the
kind of book you find in a
bookstore with all the pages
well-thumbed even before anyone
has bought it. Cass & Birnbaum
put us in their highest category,
'Most Selective.' And thereby
hang some tales.
"(I'll have to use a few
numbers in this talk. Be reassured,
no higher mathematics will sneak
in-I'm personally too close to
being mathematically illiterate—or
innumerate—for that.)
'Most Selective.' For
undergraduates, that comes from

the fact that we get over 9,000
completed applications, admit
around 2,300, of whom
two-thirds actually show up to
enroll in September. A little over
twenty years ago, 85 percent of
the applicants to Stanford's
freshman class got admitted. Over
the last half-dozen years that
figure has hovered 1 around 25
percent.
"It's not possible to say
exactly how the 2,300 were culled
from the 9,000. No single
criterion applies. Academic
achievement and potential
obviously constitute the most
important single variable. But a
variety of other qualities are
sought, and found. Lately the
Dean of Admissions has been
looking particularly hard at things
like evidence of capacity to take
on and carry out a job—what
non-academics might call 'real
world experience.'(l've never been
able to see quite how the
University was exempt from being
part of the Real World. Certainly
our problems are real enough;
maybe it's the solutions that
sometimes seem unreal.)
"This year's freshman
class—the class of '76—doesn't
that add years to your age just to
hear?—this class came to Stanford
from 829 secondary schools, the
largest number ever. That reflects
Stanford's conscious effort to
spread the word, and not to
concentrate it in a few arbitrarily
chosen places. The freshmen come
from 44 states and the District of

Columbia, plus quite a number of
foreign lands. Overthree-fourthsof
them went to public high schools,
less than one-fourth to private
schools. Sixty per cent are men,
forty per cent are women. This
quite closely parallels the balance
of the sexes in the total pool of
applicants. There are now no
quotas or targets for either sex in
undergraduate admissions. The
gradual reduction to zero of
discrimination against women has
meant that the number of women
undergraduates at Stanford has
increased 27 percent since 1968,
while the total undergraduate
enrollment has gone up only 5
perent in that same time.
"Interestingly, this rise in
woman power hasn't meant a
corresponding drop in
enrollemtnts in such allegedly
non-feminine subjects as the
so-called hard sciences. Principles
of Biology enrolled some 500
students this Fall, a fifth more
than last year. The Chemistry
Department is relieved to find
that their introductory courses
have leveled off at 900, after
doubling in just two years.
Everybody wants to be a
Doctor—that's the shorthand
explanation. But I think
recognition that you don't get
very far by ducking the tough
academic challenges has
something to do with it, too.
"At the same time we're
remaining so selective, we've
clearly diversified the student
body greatly. I've mentioned the
rise of the women. You're all
aware of Stanford's effort, in high
gear since 1968, to find talented
students from among the hitherto
excluded and disadvantaged of
our society. Blacks, Chicanos and
American Indians now total about
15 percent of the undergraduate
student body.
"Has all of this, plus the
inexorable rise of tuition year
after year, meant that the great
American middle class is being
squeezed out? That's the question
I encounter most often in talking
about admissions, selectivity, and
so forth.
"Well, at risk of sounding
incurably academic, I have to say
that the picture isn't terribly clear
at this point. Until this year, we
thought we had a slightly ominous
clue in a rising attrition
rate—more students dropping out
after each quarter, so that by
Spring there were only B'/2
undergraduates left out of every
one hundred who had started in
the Fall. (Don't ask me where that
half-student had gone.) But this
year that mini-trend seems likely
to slow down, perhaps to stop.
"Of course even if they leave
you can't be sure why. Everyone
knows about Joe X, or Suzy Y
who transferred to UC because
the Stanford tuition got too
tough . But when we did a survey
last summer to see why one third
of the students whom we had
admitted went elsewhere, the
results didn't suggest that tuition
was the main problem. More than
one-quarter of the respondents
had chosen either a certain East
Coast conglomerate known as
Harvard-Radcliffe or its arch-rival,
Yale; about half chose other and
comparably expensive private
colleges; only a quarter wen to
publicly supported universities,
where tuition is low or nearly
non-existent.

"On the other hand, there were
signs of what one might call
middle class tuition resistance in
that a somewhat higher
proportion of those who were in
middle income brackets gave
finances as the primary reason for
going elsewhere than was the case
in either the lowest or the highest
brackets.
"So we're keeping a wary eye
on this problem. On the one hand,
it's hard to see why we should not

raise tuition for those in a
position to pay, when it still falls
considerably short of the cost of a
Stanford education in any field,
and when the cost of everything
we buy and the wages of everyone
we hire keep on rising. On the
other hand, we know that there is
real hardship at the margins of
eligibility for scholarship help. We
know also that it's tough to find a
formula for perfect justice. Why,
for instance, should we favor a
family in which only one parent
works, and there's considerable
indebtedness, over one in which
both parents work and the house
and car and color TV are all paid
for? Yet we do. But trying to find
the need formula that's fair
to all is a task for Solomon, and
though there are literally no less
than five people named Solomon
in this year's Faculty
Staff-Directory, none of them has
as yet solved our problem for us.

"Nearly five out of eleven
Stanford students are graduate
students of one kind or another.
This tends sometimes to be
forgotten, so strong is the
mythology of the undergraduate
years in American life. Did these
graduate students have as tough a
time getting in as the freshmen?
"It's hard to generalize. In
some of the professional schools,
the ratio of applicants to admitted
students was steeper still, steeper
than the Matterhorn, and about as
slippery. For 1971-72, over 3,000
people applied to the M.D.
program at the Stanford Medical
School. One hundred forty-three
were admitted, of whom slightly
more than one-half enrolled.
3,000 applicants, seventy-five
students at the end of the great
winnowing process. That's a lot of
disappointed people. And it's got
worse since—nearly 3,700
applicants for this year's class.
"Law is not quite so grim.
Instead of having only one chance
in 21 of being admitted, you had
just a hair more than one chance
in 10 if you applied to the
Stanford Law School in 1971.
"And so it goes. Not
uniformly—the odds are much
more in your favor if you pick
Engineering or Earth Sciences.
But that reflects a general,
national decline in interest in, and
preparedness for, those fields. I
suspect this will turn around when
young people start discovering
that nationally we'll soon be
graduating only about two-thirds
of the engineers we need. An
old-fashioned instrument called
the marketplace will begin to
make itself felt. And the challenge
of actually solving environmental
or energy problems, instead of
just wringing one's hands about
them, should play a part, too.
"Now what does all this mean?
do all these numbers mean that
the main thing is growth, and still
more growth? Do they mean that
all we're focusing on is more of
the same—more selectivity, larger
numbers of disappointed
applicants left out in the cold,
tougher standards of admission,
just so we can brag about ourselves
and feel that because so many
people want in—and because we're
so expensive—we must be good?
"To begin with, we could no
doubt ease the pressure by
admitting more students, letting
ourselves grow larger. We don't
choose to do this. For several
years Stanford has been hovering
around 11,000 to 11,500 total
students (exclusing the so-called
terminal graduate students—not a
fatal disease, just the condition
you'r n in when you've finished
your residence requirements but
not licked the dissertation yet).
One of the clearcut advantages of
the private college or university is
that it need not grow in response

would it make not to exercise care
in selecting those potential
students who are best equipped to
make intelligent and productive
use of these academic resources?
It doesn't bother me if our
students of English are articulate
before they get to us, or if some
of our would-be engineers have
been playing scales on the slide
rule since the age of six. It would
bother me if one had to be a
genius to have a reasonable chance
for admission—but that isn't so. I
ask your indulgence to quote
from a document many of you
have probably read—a letter which
Fred Hargadon, Dean of
Admissions, sends to prospective
applicants. . . we can (and do)
exercise judgments relating to
factors over and above academic
ability in selecting a freshman
class,' he writes. (Some day I'll
pick a bone with Fred about that
'over and above'—l'd prefer
'beyond'or simply and colorlessly
'other than' since as an academic I

to every demand of the moment.
We're not planning to throw that
advantage out.
"But we're not in love with
selectivity for its own sake, either.
Quite a number of critics of
higher education have been
pointing out lately that it's small
wonder the best colleges tend to
turn out an unfair share of the
best-equipped graduates—they
only accept the best-equipped
applicants to begin with. We are,
so the criticism goes, guilty of
making silk purses out of silk.
"I'm afraid my chief response
to that is, 'Sure, why not?' The
leading colleges and universities,
whether public or private, have
gone to considerable lengths to
bring together the most talented
faculty they could find, to build
great library collections, to

indebtedness, over one in which
both parents work and the house
and car and color TV are all paid
for? Yet we do. But trying to find
the need formula that's fair
to all is a task for Solomon, and
though there are literally no less
than five people named Solomon
in this year's Faculty
Staff-Directory, none of them has
as yet solved our problem for us.

"Nearly five out of eleven
Stanford students are graduate
students of one kind or another.
This tends sometimes to be
forgotten, so strong is the
mythology of the undergraduate
years in American life. Did these
graduate students have as tough a
time getting in as the freshmen?
"It's hard to generalize. In
some of the professional schools,
the ratio of applicants to admitted
students was steeper still, steeper
than the Matterhorn, and about as
slippery. For 1971-72, over 3,000
people applied to the M.D.
program at the Stanford Medical
School. One hundred forty-three
were admitted, of whom slightly
more than one-half enrolled.
3,000 applicants, seventy-five
students at the end of the great
winnowing process. That's a lot of
disappointed people. And it's got
worse since—nearly 3,700
applicants for this year's class.
"Law is not quite so grim.
Instead of having only one chance
in 21 of being admitted, you had
just a hair more than one chance
in 10 if you applied to the
Stanford Law School in 1971.
"And so it goes. Not
uniformly—the odds are much
more in your favor if you pick
Engineering or Earth Sciences.
But that reflects a general,
national decline in interest in, and
preparedness for, those fields. I
suspect this will turn around when
young people start discovering
that nationally we'll soon be
graduating only about two-thirds
of the engineers we need. An
old-fashioned instrument called
the marketplace will begin to
make itself felt. And the challenge
of actually solving environmental
or energy problems, instead of
just wringing one's hands about
them, should play a part, too.
"Now what does all this mean?
do all these numbers mean that
the main thing is growth, and still
more growth? Do they mean that
all we're focusing on is more of
the same—more selectivity, larger
numbers of disappointed
applicants left out in the cold,
tougher standards of admission,
just so we can brag about ourselves
and feel that because so many
people want in—and because we're
so expensive—we must be good?
"To begin with, we could no
doubt ease the pressure by
admitting more students, letting
ourselves grow larger. We don't
choose to do this. For several
years Stanford has been hovering
around 11,000 to 11,500 total
students (exclusing the so-called
terminal graduate students—not a
fatal disease, just the condition
you'r n in when you've finished
your residence requirements but
not licked the dissertation yet).
One of the clearcut advantages of
the private college or university is
that it need not grow in response

would it make not to exercise care
in selecting those potential
students who are best equipped to
make intelligent and productive
use of these academic resources?
It doesn't bother me if our
students of English are articulate
before they get to us, or if some
of our would-be engineers have
been playing scales on the slide
rule since the age of six. It would
bother me if one had to be a
genius to have a reasonable chance
for admission—but that isn't so. I
ask your indulgence to quote
from a document many of you
have probably read—a letter which
Fred Hargadon, Dean of
Admissions, sends to prospective
applicants. . . we can (and do)
exercise judgments relating to
factors over and above academic
ability in selecting a freshman
class,' he writes. (Some day I'll
pick a bone with Fred about that
'over and above'—l'd prefer
'beyond'or simply and colorlessly
'other than' since as an academic I

to every demand of the moment.
We're not planning to throw that
advantage out.
"But we're not in love with
selectivity for its own sake, either.
Quite a number of critics of
higher education have been
pointing out lately that it's small
wonder the best colleges tend to
turn out an unfair share of the
best-equipped graduates—they
only accept the best-equipped
applicants to begin with. We are,
so the criticism goes, guilty of
making silk purses out of silk.
"I'm afraid my chief response
to that is, 'Sure, why not?' The
leading colleges and universities,
whether public or private, have
gone to considerable lengths to
bring together the most talented
faculty they could find, to build
great library collections, to
develop formidable laboratories
and computer facilities, and so on.
Having done this, what sense

have trouble placing
other considerations, however
important, clearly 'above'
academic ability in this context,
and I'm fairly sure that Fred does
too. He gets equal time in the
panel this afternoon, if I've
misrepresented him.) Anyhow,
Fred goes on to cite
'exceptionally well developed
talents in areas such as the arts,
music, athletics, and leadership,'
and also to stress 'diversity in
backgrounds, values, and
educational objectives.' '. . . we
recognize a broad range of
excellence, realizing that
excellence itself does not always
and everywhere come in uniform
dimensions.' To that I can only
say, Amen...
"Still, the efforts include
attention to diversity, and to
opening up opportunity to people
who haven't had much of it until
recently. It's significant that the
Stanford School of
Engineering,which enrolls about 4
percent of the total graduate
student population of the United
States in engineering, enrolls some
7 percnet of the country's total of
women engineering graduate
students. Also that when Stanford
awarded six master's degree
candidates in all fields of
engineering in the entire nation.
Clearly, to paraphrase Robert
Frost, we have 'miles to go before
we sleep.'
"Diversity has another
dimension worth exploring: age.
"What is being said nowadays
on this subject is familiar enough:
that less and less will education
beyond the high school be
confined to the traditional time
periods; more and more people
will 'stop out' from time to time,
and correspondingly more will
re-enter colleges and universities
after periods, often long periods,
of working for a living. Married
women, their children grown up,
will return to refurbish old skills
or obtain new ones. Refresher
courses of all sorts and sizes will
be needed in the seemingly
endless fight we all face to stave
off personal obsolescence in the
age of future shock.
"Stanford is not likely to
become a vast center for

'extension courses' in the old
meaning of the term. But even
now the University, or parts of it,
are doing more than is generally
recognized to reach out to alumni
and others who are past the
traditional college-going years.
The Observer for January covered
these efforts well, and I shan't try
to repeat it all. From the Summer
Alumni College, through the
volumes entitled Portable
Stanford, to specialized and
concentrated refresher programs
in the Medical School and the
Graduate School of Business,
continuing education goes on in
many forms. I might point to the
obvious: You've shown your
interest in it by coming here
today.
"The point is that Stanford
must reach out to all—and they
are a rapidly growing
number—who see their University
as something more than a place to
look back upon with nostalgia, or
a place where strange and
incomprehensible young people
are doing strange and
incomprehensible things. There's
nothing quite so good for

lowering the incomprehensibility
level than to be learning together.
"What does it all add up to? A
university with a number of
different kinds of education going
on for the benefit of an ever
greater variety of students, but
linked through a common focus
upon quality. The focus doesn't
always work; even with
admissions ratios like ten to one
or twenty to one, not every
student who comes to Stanford
finds it was the right choice. (And
Stanford has now and then been
known to entertain a twinge of
doubt as to its end of the deal, for
that matter.) The difficulty of
pursuing quality in a great variety
of educational enterprises is
always there; the difficulty these
days in finding the resources to
support high quality is something
of which we're all too sharply
aware. But a university, any
university, is principally the
people who com rose it. Given
that fact, it seems to me Stanford
has every reason to feel at least a
sober confidence as it faces the
future."

"Yes, students generally are quieter, more introsoective,
and more serious about their work. For some newsmen
it probably seems like losing an old friend, not to have
the campus revolution the biggest show in town."

"The point is that Stanford must reach out to all—and
they are a rapidly growing number-who see their
University as something more than a place to look back

(Editor's Note: The following
remarks were delivered by
President Richard Lyman at a Los
Angeles alumni conference at the
Century Plaza Hotel last Sunday.)
"For the past half-dozen years
or so, the Student Problem has
been the uppermost thing on the
mind of anyone upon meeting a
college president. Newspeople
especially. It got to the point
where beleaguered presidents were
raising the subject first, in the
hope—usually a vain one—that
they could that way retain some
shreds of the initiative, or at least
set the stage for the bad news as
gently as possible.
"For some time now, however,
media people have tended to raise
the subject almost nostalgically:
'Is it true that things are all quiet
how?' they'll ask, as if they half
hoped one would surprise them
by saying 'no,' and then they'd be
back on familiar ground—the
unsolicited riot, the
non-negotiable demand, the
unreprimanded blackmail of the
academic process. But in fact the
answer tends to be 'Yes, students
generally are quieter, more
introspective, and more serious
about their work.' For some
newsmen it probably seems like
losing an old friend, not to have
the campus revolution the biggest
show in town.
"(Let me hasten to say that
there are a good many honorable
exceptions. To name an
outstanding one, BillTrombley of
the Los Angeles Times, whose
comprehensive and probing
interest in higher education is
what one would expect from one
of the world's truly great
newspapers.)
"As for alumni audience, I find
they're deeply concerned about a
whole range of problems, from
the tuition scramble to the
question of how to preserve the
liberal arts while at the same time
equipping young people to play a
useful part in the world of
business, government, and the
professions.
"I've nevertheless chosen to
talk about students today, not
because they're embattled, but
because they are a very large part
of what the University is all
about, and because the subject is
endlessly interesting. It is, after
all, perhaps our strongest common
bond throughout this room. We've
all been students (and many of us
no doubt still are); we all know
other students; a lot of us are
supporting students—oh, how
we're supporting them!
'Supporting,' that's spelled with a
large 'S': that has two vertical
lines through it—a Capital'S,' one
might say.
"As you all know, Stanford is a
selective university. Cass &
Birnbaum, Comparative Guide to
American Colleges, is the bible of
the college entrance seeker, the
kind of book you find in a
bookstore with all the pages
well-thumbed even before anyone
has bought it. Cass & Birnbaum
put us in their highest category,
'Most Selective.' And thereby
hang some tales.
"(I'll have to use a few
numbers in this talk. Be reassured,
no higher mathematics will sneak
in-I'm personally too close to
being mathematically illiterate—or
innumerate—for that.)
'Most Selective.' For
undergraduates, that comes from

the fact that we get over 9,000
completed applications, admit
around 2,300, of whom
two-thirds actually show up to
enroll in September. A little over
twenty years ago, 85 percent of
the applicants to Stanford's
freshman class got admitted. Over
the last half-dozen years that
figure has hovered 1 around 25
percent.
"It's not possible to say
exactly how the 2,300 were culled
from the 9,000. No single
criterion applies. Academic
achievement and potential
obviously constitute the most
important single variable. But a
variety of other qualities are
sought, and found. Lately the
Dean of Admissions has been
looking particularly hard at things
like evidence of capacity to take
on and carry out a job—what
non-academics might call 'real
world experience.'(l've never been
able to see quite how the
University was exempt from being
part of the Real World. Certainly
our problems are real enough;
maybe it's the solutions that
sometimes seem unreal.)
"This year's freshman
class—the class of '76—doesn't
that add years to your age just to
hear?—this class came to Stanford
from 829 secondary schools, the
largest number ever. That reflects
Stanford's conscious effort to
spread the word, and not to
concentrate it in a few arbitrarily
chosen places. The freshmen come
from 44 states and the District of

Columbia, plus quite a number of
foreign lands. Overthree-fourthsof
them went to public high schools,
less than one-fourth to private
schools. Sixty per cent are men,
forty per cent are women. This
quite closely parallels the balance
of the sexes in the total pool of
applicants. There are now no
quotas or targets for either sex in
undergraduate admissions. The
gradual reduction to zero of
discrimination against women has
meant that the number of women
undergraduates at Stanford has
increased 27 percent since 1968,
while the total undergraduate
enrollment has gone up only 5
perent in that same time.
"Interestingly, this rise in
woman power hasn't meant a
corresponding drop in
enrollemtnts in such allegedly
non-feminine subjects as the
so-called hard sciences. Principles
of Biology enrolled some 500
students this Fall, a fifth more
than last year. The Chemistry
Department is relieved to find
that their introductory courses
have leveled off at 900, after
doubling in just two years.
Everybody wants to be a
Doctor—that's the shorthand
explanation. But I think
recognition that you don't get
very far by ducking the tough
academic challenges has
something to do with it, too.
"At the same time we're
remaining so selective, we've
clearly diversified the student
body greatly. I've mentioned the
rise of the women. You're all
aware of Stanford's effort, in high
gear since 1968, to find talented
students from among the hitherto
excluded and disadvantaged of
our society. Blacks, Chicanos and
American Indians now total about
15 percent of the undergraduate
student body.
"Has all of this, plus the
inexorable rise of tuition year
after year, meant that the great
American middle class is being
squeezed out? That's the question
I encounter most often in talking
about admissions, selectivity, and
so forth.
"Well, at risk of sounding
incurably academic, I have to say
that the picture isn't terribly clear
at this point. Until this year, we
thought we had a slightly ominous
clue in a rising attrition
rate—more students dropping out
after each quarter, so that by
Spring there were only B'/2
undergraduates left out of every
one hundred who had started in
the Fall. (Don't ask me where that
half-student had gone.) But this
year that mini-trend seems likely
to slow down, perhaps to stop.
"Of course even if they leave
you can't be sure why. Everyone
knows about Joe X, or Suzy Y
who transferred to UC because
the Stanford tuition got too
tough . But when we did a survey
last summer to see why one third
of the students whom we had
admitted went elsewhere, the
results didn't suggest that tuition
was the main problem. More than
one-quarter of the respondents
had chosen either a certain East
Coast conglomerate known as
Harvard-Radcliffe or its arch-rival,
Yale; about half chose other and
comparably expensive private
colleges; only a quarter wen to
publicly supported universities,
where tuition is low or nearly
non-existent.

"On the other hand, there were
signs of what one might call
middle class tuition resistance in
that a somewhat higher
proportion of those who were in
middle income brackets gave
finances as the primary reason for
going elsewhere than was the case
in either the lowest or the highest
brackets.
"So we're keeping a wary eye
on this problem. On the one hand,
it's hard to see why we should not

raise tuition for those in a
position to pay, when it still falls
considerably short of the cost of a
Stanford education in any field,
and when the cost of everything
we buy and the wages of everyone
we hire keep on rising. On the
other hand, we know that there is
real hardship at the margins of
eligibility for scholarship help. We
know also that it's tough to find a
formula for perfect justice. Why,
for instance, should we favor a
family in which only one parent
works, and there's considerable
indebtedness, over one in which
both parents work and the house
and car and color TV are all paid
for? Yet we do. But trying to find
the need formula that's fair
to all is a task for Solomon, and
though there are literally no less
than five people named Solomon
in this year's Faculty
Staff-Directory, none of them has
as yet solved our problem for us.

world experience.'(l've never been
able to see quite how the
University was exempt from being
part of the Real World. Certainly
our problems are real enough;
maybe it's the solutions that
sometimes seem unreal.)
"This year's freshman
class—the class of '76—doesn't
that add years to your age just to
hear?—this class came to Stanford
from 829 secondary schools, the
largest number ever. That reflects
Stanford's conscious effort to
spread the word, and not to
concentrate it in a few arbitrarily
chosen places. The freshmen come
from 44 states and the District of

Columbia, plus quite a number of
foreign lands. Overthree-fourthsof
them went to public high schools,
less than one-fourth to private
schools. Sixty per cent are men,
forty per cent are women. This
quite closely parallels the balance
of the sexes in the total pool of
applicants. There are now no
quotas or targets for either sex in
undergraduate admissions. The
gradual reduction to zero of
discrimination against women has
meant that the number of women
undergraduates at Stanford has
increased 27 percent since 1968,
while the total undergraduate
enrollment has gone up only 5
perent in that same time.
"Interestingly, this rise in
woman power hasn't meant a
corresponding drop in
enrollemtnts in such allegedly
non-feminine subjects as the
so-called hard sciences. Principles
of Biology enrolled some 500
students this Fall, a fifth more
than last year. The Chemistry
Department is relieved to find
that their introductory courses
have leveled off at 900, after
doubling in just two years.
Everybody wants to be a
Doctor—that's the shorthand
explanation. But I think
recognition that you don't get
very far by ducking the tough
academic challenges has
something to do with it, too.
"At the same time we're
remaining so selective, we've
clearly diversified the student
body greatly. I've mentioned the
rise of the women. You're all
aware of Stanford's effort, in high
gear since 1968, to find talented
students from among the hitherto
excluded and disadvantaged of
our society. Blacks, Chicanos and
American Indians now total about
15 percent of the undergraduate
student body.
"Has all of this, plus the
inexorable rise of tuition year
after year, meant that the great
American middle class is being
squeezed out? That's the question
I encounter most often in talking
about admissions, selectivity, and
so forth.
"Well, at risk of sounding
incurably academic, I have to say
that the picture isn't terribly clear
at this point. Until this year, we
thought we had a slightly ominous
clue in a rising attrition
rate—more students dropping out
after each quarter, so that by
Spring there were only B'/2
undergraduates left out of every
one hundred who had started in
the Fall. (Don't ask me where that
half-student had gone.) But this
year that mini-trend seems likely
to slow down, perhaps to stop.
"Of course even if they leave
you can't be sure why. Everyone
knows about Joe X, or Suzy Y
who transferred to UC because
the Stanford tuition got too
tough . But when we did a survey
last summer to see why one third
of the students whom we had
admitted went elsewhere, the
results didn't suggest that tuition
was the main problem. More than
one-quarter of the respondents
had chosen either a certain East
Coast conglomerate known as
Harvard-Radcliffe or its arch-rival,
Yale; about half chose other and
comparably expensive private
colleges; only a quarter wen to
publicly supported universities,
where tuition is low or nearly
non-existent.

"On the other hand, there were
signs of what one might call
middle class tuition resistance in
that a somewhat higher
proportion of those who were in
middle income brackets gave
finances as the primary reason for
going elsewhere than was the case
in either the lowest or the highest
brackets.
"So we're keeping a wary eye
on this problem. On the one hand,
it's hard to see why we should not

raise tuition for those in a
position to pay, when it still falls
considerably short of the cost of a
Stanford education in any field,
and when the cost of everything
we buy and the wages of everyone
we hire keep on rising. On the
other hand, we know that there is
real hardship at the margins of
eligibility for scholarship help. We
know also that it's tough to find a
formula for perfect justice. Why,
for instance, should we favor a
family in which only one parent
works, and there's considerable
indebtedness, over one in which
both parents work and the house
and car and color TV are all paid
for? Yet we do. But trying to find
the need formula that's fair
to all is a task for Solomon, and
though there are literally no less
than five people named Solomon
in this year's Faculty
Staff-Directory, none of them has
as yet solved our problem for us.

"Nearly five out of eleven
Stanford students are graduate
students of one kind or another.
This tends sometimes to be
forgotten, so strong is the
mythology of the undergraduate
years in American life. Did these
graduate students have as tough a
time getting in as the freshmen?
"It's hard to generalize. In
some of the professional schools,
the ratio of applicants to admitted
students was steeper still, steeper
than the Matterhorn, and about as
slippery. For 1971-72, over 3,000
people applied to the M.D.
program at the Stanford Medical
School. One hundred forty-three
were admitted, of whom slightly
more than one-half enrolled.
3,000 applicants, seventy-five
students at the end of the great
winnowing process. That's a lot of
disappointed people. And it's got
worse since—nearly 3,700
applicants for this year's class.
"Law is not quite so grim.
Instead of having only one chance
in 21 of being admitted, you had
just a hair more than one chance
in 10 if you applied to the
Stanford Law School in 1971.
"And so it goes. Not
uniformly—the odds are much
more in your favor if you pick
Engineering or Earth Sciences.
But that reflects a general,
national decline in interest in, and
preparedness for, those fields. I
suspect this will turn around when
young people start discovering
that nationally we'll soon be
graduating only about two-thirds
of the engineers we need. An
old-fashioned instrument called
the marketplace will begin to
make itself felt. And the challenge
of actually solving environmental
or energy problems, instead of
just wringing one's hands about
them, should play a part, too.
"Now what does all this mean?
do all these numbers mean that
the main thing is growth, and still
more growth? Do they mean that
all we're focusing on is more of
the same—more selectivity, larger
numbers of disappointed
applicants left out in the cold,
tougher standards of admission,
just so we can brag about ourselves
and feel that because so many
people want in—and because we're
so expensive—we must be good?
"To begin with, we could no
doubt ease the pressure by
admitting more students, letting
ourselves grow larger. We don't
choose to do this. For several
years Stanford has been hovering
around 11,000 to 11,500 total
students (exclusing the so-called
terminal graduate students—not a
fatal disease, just the condition
you'r n in when you've finished
your residence requirements but
not licked the dissertation yet).
One of the clearcut advantages of
the private college or university is
that it need not grow in response

would it make not to exercise care
in selecting those potential
students who are best equipped to
make intelligent and productive
use of these academic resources?
It doesn't bother me if our
students of English are articulate
before they get to us, or if some
of our would-be engineers have
been playing scales on the slide
rule since the age of six. It would
bother me if one had to be a
genius to have a reasonable chance
for admission—but that isn't so. I
ask your indulgence to quote
from a document many of you
have probably read—a letter which
Fred Hargadon, Dean of
Admissions, sends to prospective
applicants. . . we can (and do)
exercise judgments relating to
factors over and above academic
ability in selecting a freshman
class,' he writes. (Some day I'll
pick a bone with Fred about that
'over and above'—l'd prefer
'beyond'or simply and colorlessly
'other than' since as an academic I

to every demand of the moment.
We're not planning to throw that
advantage out.
"But we're not in love with
selectivity for its own sake, either.
Quite a number of critics of
higher education have been
pointing out lately that it's small
wonder the best colleges tend to
turn out an unfair share of the
best-equipped graduates—they
only accept the best-equipped
applicants to begin with. We are,
so the criticism goes, guilty of
making silk purses out of silk.
"I'm afraid my chief response
to that is, 'Sure, why not?' The
leading colleges and universities,
whether public or private, have
gone to considerable lengths to
bring together the most talented
faculty they could find, to build
great library collections, to
develop formidable laboratories
and computer facilities, and so on.
Having done this, what sense

have trouble placing
other considerations, however
important, clearly 'above'
academic ability in this context,
and I'm fairly sure that Fred does
too. He gets equal time in the
panel this afternoon, if I've
misrepresented him.) Anyhow,
Fred goes on to cite
'exceptionally well developed
talents in areas such as the arts,
music, athletics, and leadership,'
and also to stress 'diversity in
backgrounds, values, and
educational objectives.' '. . . we
recognize a broad range of
excellence, realizing that
excellence itself does not always
and everywhere come in uniform
dimensions.' To that I can only
say, Amen...
"Still, the efforts include
attention to diversity, and to
opening up opportunity to people
who haven't had much of it until
recently. It's significant that the
Stanford School of
Engineering,which enrolls about 4
percent of the total graduate
student population of the United
States in engineering, enrolls some
7 percnet of the country's total of
women engineering graduate
students. Also that when Stanford
awarded six master's degree
candidates in all fields of
engineering in the entire nation.
Clearly, to paraphrase Robert
Frost, we have 'miles to go before
we sleep.'
"Diversity has another
dimension worth exploring: age.
"What is being said nowadays
on this subject is familiar enough:
that less and less will education
beyond the high school be
confined to the traditional time
periods; more and more people
will 'stop out' from time to time,
and correspondingly more will
re-enter colleges and universities
after periods, often long periods,
of working for a living. Married
women, their children grown up,
will return to refurbish old skills
or obtain new ones. Refresher
courses of all sorts and sizes will
be needed in the seemingly
endless fight we all face to stave
off personal obsolescence in the
age of future shock.
"Stanford is not likely to
become a vast center for

'extension courses' in the old
meaning of the term. But even
now the University, or parts of it,
are doing more than is generally
recognized to reach out to alumni
and others who are past the
traditional college-going years.
The Observer for January covered
these efforts well, and I shan't try
to repeat it all. From the Summer
Alumni College, through the
volumes entitled Portable
Stanford, to specialized and
concentrated refresher programs
in the Medical School and the
Graduate School of Business,
continuing education goes on in
many forms. I might point to the
obvious: You've shown your
interest in it by coming here
today.
"The point is that Stanford
must reach out to all—and they
are a rapidly growing
number—who see their University
as something more than a place to
look back upon with nostalgia, or
a place where strange and
incomprehensible young people
are doing strange and
incomprehensible things. There's
nothing quite so good for

lowering the incomprehensibility
level than to be learning together.
"What does it all add up to? A
university with a number of
different kinds of education going
on for the benefit of an ever
greater variety of students, but
linked through a common focus
upon quality. The focus doesn't
always work; even with
admissions ratios like ten to one
or twenty to one, not every
student who comes to Stanford
finds it was the right choice. (And
Stanford has now and then been
known to entertain a twinge of
doubt as to its end of the deal, for
that matter.) The difficulty of
pursuing quality in a great variety
of educational enterprises is
always there; the difficulty these
days in finding the resources to
support high quality is something
of which we're all too sharply
aware. But a university, any
university, is principally the
people who com rose it. Given
that fact, it seems to me Stanford
has every reason to feel at least a
sober confidence as it faces the
future."

"Yes, students generally are quieter, more introsoective,
and more serious about their work. For some newsmen
it probably seems like losing an old friend, not to have
the campus revolution the biggest show in town."

"The point is that Stanford must reach out to all—and
they are a rapidly growing number-who see their
University as something more than a place to look back
upon with nostalgia, or a place where strange and
incomprehensible young people are doing strange and
incomprehensible things."
(Editor's Note: The following
remarks were delivered by
President Richard Lyman at a Los
Angeles alumni conference at the
Century Plaza Hotel last Sunday.)
"For the past half-dozen years
or so, the Student Problem has
been the uppermost thing on the
mind of anyone upon meeting a
college president. Newspeople
especially. It got to the point
where beleaguered presidents were
raising the subject first, in the
hope—usually a vain one—that
they could that way retain some
shreds of the initiative, or at least
set the stage for the bad news as
gently as possible.
"For some time now, however,
media people have tended to raise
the subject almost nostalgically:
'Is it true that things are all quiet
how?' they'll ask, as if they half
hoped one would surprise them
by saying 'no,' and then they'd be
back on familiar ground—the
unsolicited riot, the
non-negotiable demand, the
unreprimanded blackmail of the
academic process. But in fact the
answer tends to be 'Yes, students
generally are quieter, more
introspective, and more serious
about their work.' For some
newsmen it probably seems like
losing an old friend, not to have
the campus revolution the biggest
show in town.
"(Let me hasten to say that
there are a good many honorable
exceptions. To name an
outstanding one, BillTrombley of
the Los Angeles Times, whose
comprehensive and probing
interest in higher education is
what one would expect from one
of the world's truly great
newspapers.)
"As for alumni audience, I find
they're deeply concerned about a
whole range of problems, from
the tuition scramble to the
question of how to preserve the
liberal arts while at the same time
equipping young people to play a
useful part in the world of
business, government, and the
professions.
"I've nevertheless chosen to
talk about students today, not
because they're embattled, but
because they are a very large part
of what the University is all
about, and because the subject is
endlessly interesting. It is, after
all, perhaps our strongest common
bond throughout this room. We've
all been students (and many of us
no doubt still are); we all know
other students; a lot of us are
supporting students—oh, how
we're supporting them!
'Supporting,' that's spelled with a
large 'S': that has two vertical
lines through it—a Capital'S,' one
might say.
"As you all know, Stanford is a
selective university. Cass &
Birnbaum, Comparative Guide to
American Colleges, is the bible of
the college entrance seeker, the
kind of book you find in a
bookstore with all the pages
well-thumbed even before anyone
has bought it. Cass & Birnbaum
put us in their highest category,
'Most Selective.' And thereby
hang some tales.
"(I'll have to use a few
numbers in this talk. Be reassured,
no higher mathematics will sneak
in-I'm personally too close to
being mathematically illiterate—or
innumerate—for that.)
'Most Selective.' For
undergraduates, that comes from

the fact that we get over 9,000
completed applications, admit
around 2,300, of whom
two-thirds actually show up to
enroll in September. A little over
twenty years ago, 85 percent of
the applicants to Stanford's
freshman class got admitted. Over
the last half-dozen years that
figure has hovered 1 around 25
percent.
"It's not possible to say
exactly how the 2,300 were culled
from the 9,000. No single
criterion applies. Academic
achievement and potential
obviously constitute the most
important single variable. But a
variety of other qualities are
sought, and found. Lately the
Dean of Admissions has been
looking particularly hard at things
like evidence of capacity to take
on and carry out a job—what
non-academics might call 'real
world experience.'(l've never been
able to see quite how the
University was exempt from being
part of the Real World. Certainly
our problems are real enough;
maybe it's the solutions that
sometimes seem unreal.)

of which we're all too sharply
aware. But a university, any
university, is principally the
people who com rose it. Given
that fact, it seems to me Stanford
has every reason to feel at least a
sober confidence as it faces the
future."

"Yes, students generally are quieter, more introsoective,
and more serious about their work. For some newsmen
it probably seems like losing an old friend, not to have
the campus revolution the biggest show in town."

"The point is that Stanford must reach out to all—and
they are a rapidly growing number-who see their
University as something more than a place to look back
upon with nostalgia, or a place where strange and
incomprehensible young people are doing strange and
incomprehensible things."
(Editor's Note: The following
remarks were delivered by
President Richard Lyman at a Los
Angeles alumni conference at the
Century Plaza Hotel last Sunday.)
"For the past half-dozen years
or so, the Student Problem has
been the uppermost thing on the
mind of anyone upon meeting a
college president. Newspeople
especially. It got to the point
where beleaguered presidents were
raising the subject first, in the
hope—usually a vain one—that
they could that way retain some
shreds of the initiative, or at least
set the stage for the bad news as
gently as possible.
"For some time now, however,
media people have tended to raise
the subject almost nostalgically:
'Is it true that things are all quiet
how?' they'll ask, as if they half
hoped one would surprise them
by saying 'no,' and then they'd be
back on familiar ground—the
unsolicited riot, the
non-negotiable demand, the
unreprimanded blackmail of the
academic process. But in fact the
answer tends to be 'Yes, students
generally are quieter, more
introspective, and more serious
about their work.' For some
newsmen it probably seems like
losing an old friend, not to have
the campus revolution the biggest
show in town.
"(Let me hasten to say that
there are a good many honorable
exceptions. To name an
outstanding one, BillTrombley of
the Los Angeles Times, whose
comprehensive and probing
interest in higher education is
what one would expect from one
of the world's truly great
newspapers.)
"As for alumni audience, I find
they're deeply concerned about a
whole range of problems, from
the tuition scramble to the
question of how to preserve the
liberal arts while at the same time
equipping young people to play a
useful part in the world of
business, government, and the
professions.
"I've nevertheless chosen to
talk about students today, not
because they're embattled, but
because they are a very large part
of what the University is all
about, and because the subject is
endlessly interesting. It is, after
all, perhaps our strongest common
bond throughout this room. We've
all been students (and many of us
no doubt still are); we all know
other students; a lot of us are
supporting students—oh, how
we're supporting them!
'Supporting,' that's spelled with a
large 'S': that has two vertical
lines through it—a Capital'S,' one
might say.
"As you all know, Stanford is a
selective university. Cass &
Birnbaum, Comparative Guide to
American Colleges, is the bible of
the college entrance seeker, the
kind of book you find in a
bookstore with all the pages
well-thumbed even before anyone
has bought it. Cass & Birnbaum
put us in their highest category,
'Most Selective.' And thereby
hang some tales.
"(I'll have to use a few
numbers in this talk. Be reassured,
no higher mathematics will sneak
in-I'm personally too close to
being mathematically illiterate—or
innumerate—for that.)
'Most Selective.' For
undergraduates, that comes from

the fact that we get over 9,000
completed applications, admit
around 2,300, of whom
two-thirds actually show up to
enroll in September. A little over
twenty years ago, 85 percent of
the applicants to Stanford's
freshman class got admitted. Over
the last half-dozen years that
figure has hovered 1 around 25
percent.
"It's not possible to say
exactly how the 2,300 were culled
from the 9,000. No single
criterion applies. Academic
achievement and potential
obviously constitute the most
important single variable. But a
variety of other qualities are
sought, and found. Lately the
Dean of Admissions has been
looking particularly hard at things
like evidence of capacity to take
on and carry out a job—what
non-academics might call 'real
world experience.'(l've never been
able to see quite how the
University was exempt from being
part of the Real World. Certainly
our problems are real enough;
maybe it's the solutions that
sometimes seem unreal.)
"This year's freshman
class—the class of '76—doesn't
that add years to your age just to
hear?—this class came to Stanford
from 829 secondary schools, the
largest number ever. That reflects
Stanford's conscious effort to
spread the word, and not to
concentrate it in a few arbitrarily
chosen places. The freshmen come
from 44 states and the District of

Columbia, plus quite a number of
foreign lands. Overthree-fourthsof
them went to public high schools,
less than one-fourth to private
schools. Sixty per cent are men,
forty per cent are women. This
quite closely parallels the balance
of the sexes in the total pool of
applicants. There are now no
quotas or targets for either sex in
undergraduate admissions. The
gradual reduction to zero of
discrimination against women has
meant that the number of women
undergraduates at Stanford has
increased 27 percent since 1968,
while the total undergraduate
enrollment has gone up only 5
perent in that same time.
"Interestingly, this rise in
woman power hasn't meant a
corresponding drop in
enrollemtnts in such allegedly
non-feminine subjects as the
so-called hard sciences. Principles
of Biology enrolled some 500
students this Fall, a fifth more
than last year. The Chemistry
Department is relieved to find
that their introductory courses
have leveled off at 900, after
doubling in just two years.
Everybody wants to be a
Doctor—that's the shorthand
explanation. But I think
recognition that you don't get
very far by ducking the tough
academic challenges has
something to do with it, too.
"At the same time we're
remaining so selective, we've
clearly diversified the student
body greatly. I've mentioned the
rise of the women. You're all
aware of Stanford's effort, in high
gear since 1968, to find talented
students from among the hitherto
excluded and disadvantaged of
our society. Blacks, Chicanos and
American Indians now total about
15 percent of the undergraduate
student body.
"Has all of this, plus the
inexorable rise of tuition year
after year, meant that the great
American middle class is being
squeezed out? That's the question
I encounter most often in talking
about admissions, selectivity, and
so forth.
"Well, at risk of sounding
incurably academic, I have to say
that the picture isn't terribly clear
at this point. Until this year, we
thought we had a slightly ominous
clue in a rising attrition
rate—more students dropping out
after each quarter, so that by
Spring there were only B'/2
undergraduates left out of every
one hundred who had started in
the Fall. (Don't ask me where that
half-student had gone.) But this
year that mini-trend seems likely
to slow down, perhaps to stop.
"Of course even if they leave
you can't be sure why. Everyone
knows about Joe X, or Suzy Y
who transferred to UC because
the Stanford tuition got too
tough . But when we did a survey
last summer to see why one third
of the students whom we had
admitted went elsewhere, the
results didn't suggest that tuition
was the main problem. More than
one-quarter of the respondents
had chosen either a certain East
Coast conglomerate known as
Harvard-Radcliffe or its arch-rival,
Yale; about half chose other and
comparably expensive private
colleges; only a quarter wen to
publicly supported universities,
where tuition is low or nearly
non-existent.

"On the other hand, there were
signs of what one might call
middle class tuition resistance in
that a somewhat higher
proportion of those who were in
middle income brackets gave
finances as the primary reason for
going elsewhere than was the case
in either the lowest or the highest
brackets.
"So we're keeping a wary eye
on this problem. On the one hand,
it's hard to see why we should not

raise tuition for those in a
position to pay, when it still falls
considerably short of the cost of a
Stanford education in any field,
and when the cost of everything
we buy and the wages of everyone
we hire keep on rising. On the
other hand, we know that there is
real hardship at the margins of
eligibility for scholarship help. We
know also that it's tough to find a
formula for perfect justice. Why,
for instance, should we favor a
family in which only one parent
works, and there's considerable
indebtedness, over one in which
both parents work and the house
and car and color TV are all paid
for? Yet we do. But trying to find
the need formula that's fair
to all is a task for Solomon, and
though there are literally no less
than five people named Solomon
in this year's Faculty
Staff-Directory, none of them has
as yet solved our problem for us.

"Nearly five out of eleven
Stanford students are graduate
students of one kind or another.
This tends sometimes to be
forgotten, so strong is the
mythology of the undergraduate
years in American life. Did these
graduate students have as tough a
time getting in as the freshmen?
"It's hard to generalize. In
some of the professional schools,
the ratio of applicants to admitted
students was steeper still, steeper
than the Matterhorn, and about as
slippery. For 1971-72, over 3,000
people applied to the M.D.
program at the Stanford Medical
School. One hundred forty-three
were admitted, of whom slightly
more than one-half enrolled.
3,000 applicants, seventy-five
students at the end of the great
winnowing process. That's a lot of
disappointed people. And it's got
worse since—nearly 3,700
applicants for this year's class.
"Law is not quite so grim.
Instead of having only one chance
in 21 of being admitted, you had
just a hair more than one chance
in 10 if you applied to the
Stanford Law School in 1971.
"And so it goes. Not
uniformly—the odds are much
more in your favor if you pick
Engineering or Earth Sciences.
But that reflects a general,
national decline in interest in, and
preparedness for, those fields. I
suspect this will turn around when
young people start discovering
that nationally we'll soon be
graduating only about two-thirds
of the engineers we need. An
old-fashioned instrument called
the marketplace will begin to
make itself felt. And the challenge
of actually solving environmental
or energy problems, instead of
just wringing one's hands about
them, should play a part, too.
"Now what does all this mean?
do all these numbers mean that
the main thing is growth, and still
more growth? Do they mean that
all we're focusing on is more of
the same—more selectivity, larger
numbers of disappointed
applicants left out in the cold,
tougher standards of admission,
just so we can brag about ourselves
and feel that because so many
people want in—and because we're
so expensive—we must be good?
"To begin with, we could no
doubt ease the pressure by
admitting more students, letting
ourselves grow larger. We don't
choose to do this. For several
years Stanford has been hovering
around 11,000 to 11,500 total
students (exclusing the so-called
terminal graduate students—not a
fatal disease, just the condition
you'r n in when you've finished
your residence requirements but
not licked the dissertation yet).
One of the clearcut advantages of
the private college or university is
that it need not grow in response

would it make not to exercise care
in selecting those potential
students who are best equipped to
make intelligent and productive
use of these academic resources?
It doesn't bother me if our
students of English are articulate
before they get to us, or if some
of our would-be engineers have
been playing scales on the slide
rule since the age of six. It would
bother me if one had to be a
genius to have a reasonable chance
for admission—but that isn't so. I
ask your indulgence to quote
from a document many of you
have probably read—a letter which
Fred Hargadon, Dean of
Admissions, sends to prospective
applicants. . . we can (and do)
exercise judgments relating to
factors over and above academic
ability in selecting a freshman
class,' he writes. (Some day I'll
pick a bone with Fred about that
'over and above'—l'd prefer
'beyond'or simply and colorlessly
'other than' since as an academic I

to every demand of the moment.
We're not planning to throw that
advantage out.
"But we're not in love with
selectivity for its own sake, either.
Quite a number of critics of
higher education have been
pointing out lately that it's small
wonder the best colleges tend to
turn out an unfair share of the
best-equipped graduates—they
only accept the best-equipped
applicants to begin with. We are,
so the criticism goes, guilty of
making silk purses out of silk.
"I'm afraid my chief response
to that is, 'Sure, why not?' The
leading colleges and universities,
whether public or private, have
gone to considerable lengths to
bring together the most talented
faculty they could find, to build
great library collections, to
develop formidable laboratories
and computer facilities, and so on.
Having done this, what sense

have trouble placing
other considerations, however
important, clearly 'above'
academic ability in this context,
and I'm fairly sure that Fred does
too. He gets equal time in the
panel this afternoon, if I've
misrepresented him.) Anyhow,
Fred goes on to cite
'exceptionally well developed
talents in areas such as the arts,
music, athletics, and leadership,'
and also to stress 'diversity in
backgrounds, values, and
educational objectives.' '. . . we
recognize a broad range of
excellence, realizing that
excellence itself does not always
and everywhere come in uniform
dimensions.' To that I can only
say, Amen...
"Still, the efforts include
attention to diversity, and to
opening up opportunity to people
who haven't had much of it until
recently. It's significant that the
Stanford School of
Engineering,which enrolls about 4
percent of the total graduate
student population of the United
States in engineering, enrolls some
7 percnet of the country's total of
women engineering graduate
students. Also that when Stanford
awarded six master's degree
candidates in all fields of
engineering in the entire nation.
Clearly, to paraphrase Robert
Frost, we have 'miles to go before
we sleep.'
"Diversity has another
dimension worth exploring: age.
"What is being said nowadays
on this subject is familiar enough:
that less and less will education
beyond the high school be
confined to the traditional time
periods; more and more people
will 'stop out' from time to time,
and correspondingly more will
re-enter colleges and universities
after periods, often long periods,
of working for a living. Married
women, their children grown up,
will return to refurbish old skills
or obtain new ones. Refresher
courses of all sorts and sizes will
be needed in the seemingly
endless fight we all face to stave
off personal obsolescence in the
age of future shock.
"Stanford is not likely to
become a vast center for

'extension courses' in the old
meaning of the term. But even
now the University, or parts of it,
are doing more than is generally
recognized to reach out to alumni
and others who are past the
traditional college-going years.
The Observer for January covered
these efforts well, and I shan't try
to repeat it all. From the Summer
Alumni College, through the
volumes entitled Portable
Stanford, to specialized and
concentrated refresher programs
in the Medical School and the
Graduate School of Business,
continuing education goes on in
many forms. I might point to the
obvious: You've shown your
interest in it by coming here
today.
"The point is that Stanford
must reach out to all—and they
are a rapidly growing
number—who see their University
as something more than a place to
look back upon with nostalgia, or
a place where strange and
incomprehensible young people
are doing strange and
incomprehensible things. There's
nothing quite so good for

lowering the incomprehensibility
level than to be learning together.
"What does it all add up to? A
university with a number of
different kinds of education going
on for the benefit of an ever
greater variety of students, but
linked through a common focus
upon quality. The focus doesn't
always work; even with
admissions ratios like ten to one
or twenty to one, not every
student who comes to Stanford
finds it was the right choice. (And
Stanford has now and then been
known to entertain a twinge of
doubt as to its end of the deal, for
that matter.) The difficulty of
pursuing quality in a great variety
of educational enterprises is
always there; the difficulty these
days in finding the resources to
support high quality is something
of which we're all too sharply
aware. But a university, any
university, is principally the
people who com rose it. Given
that fact, it seems to me Stanford
has every reason to feel at least a
sober confidence as it faces the
future."

"Yes, students generally are quieter, more introsoective,
and more serious about their work. For some newsmen
it probably seems like losing an old friend, not to have
the campus revolution the biggest show in town."

pick a bone with Fred about that
'over and above'—l'd prefer
'beyond'or simply and colorlessly
'other than' since as an academic I

to every demand of the moment.
We're not planning to throw that
advantage out.
"But we're not in love with
selectivity for its own sake, either.
Quite a number of critics of
higher education have been
pointing out lately that it's small
wonder the best colleges tend to
turn out an unfair share of the
best-equipped graduates—they
only accept the best-equipped
applicants to begin with. We are,
so the criticism goes, guilty of
making silk purses out of silk.
"I'm afraid my chief response
to that is, 'Sure, why not?' The
leading colleges and universities,
whether public or private, have
gone to considerable lengths to
bring together the most talented
faculty they could find, to build
great library collections, to
develop formidable laboratories
and computer facilities, and so on.
Having done this, what sense

have trouble placing
other considerations, however
important, clearly 'above'
academic ability in this context,
and I'm fairly sure that Fred does
too. He gets equal time in the
panel this afternoon, if I've
misrepresented him.) Anyhow,
Fred goes on to cite
'exceptionally well developed
talents in areas such as the arts,
music, athletics, and leadership,'
and also to stress 'diversity in
backgrounds, values, and
educational objectives.' '. . . we
recognize a broad range of
excellence, realizing that
excellence itself does not always
and everywhere come in uniform
dimensions.' To that I can only
say, Amen...
"Still, the efforts include
attention to diversity, and to
opening up opportunity to people
who haven't had much of it until
recently. It's significant that the
Stanford School of
Engineering,which enrolls about 4
percent of the total graduate
student population of the United
States in engineering, enrolls some
7 percnet of the country's total of
women engineering graduate
students. Also that when Stanford
awarded six master's degree
candidates in all fields of
engineering in the entire nation.
Clearly, to paraphrase Robert
Frost, we have 'miles to go before
we sleep.'
"Diversity has another
dimension worth exploring: age.
"What is being said nowadays
on this subject is familiar enough:
that less and less will education
beyond the high school be
confined to the traditional time
periods; more and more people
will 'stop out' from time to time,
and correspondingly more will
re-enter colleges and universities
after periods, often long periods,
of working for a living. Married
women, their children grown up,
will return to refurbish old skills
or obtain new ones. Refresher
courses of all sorts and sizes will
be needed in the seemingly
endless fight we all face to stave
off personal obsolescence in the
age of future shock.
"Stanford is not likely to
become a vast center for

'extension courses' in the old
meaning of the term. But even
now the University, or parts of it,
are doing more than is generally
recognized to reach out to alumni
and others who are past the
traditional college-going years.
The Observer for January covered
these efforts well, and I shan't try
to repeat it all. From the Summer
Alumni College, through the
volumes entitled Portable
Stanford, to specialized and
concentrated refresher programs
in the Medical School and the
Graduate School of Business,
continuing education goes on in
many forms. I might point to the
obvious: You've shown your
interest in it by coming here
today.
"The point is that Stanford
must reach out to all—and they
are a rapidly growing
number—who see their University
as something more than a place to
look back upon with nostalgia, or
a place where strange and
incomprehensible young people
are doing strange and
incomprehensible things. There's
nothing quite so good for

lowering the incomprehensibility
level than to be learning together.
"What does it all add up to? A
university with a number of
different kinds of education going
on for the benefit of an ever
greater variety of students, but
linked through a common focus
upon quality. The focus doesn't
always work; even with
admissions ratios like ten to one
or twenty to one, not every
student who comes to Stanford
finds it was the right choice. (And
Stanford has now and then been
known to entertain a twinge of
doubt as to its end of the deal, for
that matter.) The difficulty of
pursuing quality in a great variety
of educational enterprises is
always there; the difficulty these
days in finding the resources to
support high quality is something
of which we're all too sharply
aware. But a university, any
university, is principally the
people who com rose it. Given
that fact, it seems to me Stanford
has every reason to feel at least a
sober confidence as it faces the
future."

"Yes, students generally are quieter, more introsoective,
and more serious about their work. For some newsmen
it probably seems like losing an old friend, not to have
the campus revolution the biggest show in town."

"The point is that Stanford must reach out to all—and
they are a rapidly growing number-who see their
University as something more than a place to look back

incomprehensible young people are doing strange and
incomprehensible things."
(Editor's Note: The following
remarks were delivered by
President Richard Lyman at a Los
Angeles alumni conference at the
Century Plaza Hotel last Sunday.)
"For the past half-dozen years
or so, the Student Problem has
been the uppermost thing on the
mind of anyone upon meeting a
college president. Newspeople
especially. It got to the point
where beleaguered presidents were
raising the subject first, in the
hope—usually a vain one—that
they could that way retain some
shreds of the initiative, or at least
set the stage for the bad news as
gently as possible.
"For some time now, however,
media people have tended to raise
the subject almost nostalgically:
'Is it true that things are all quiet
how?' they'll ask, as if they half
hoped one would surprise them
by saying 'no,' and then they'd be
back on familiar ground—the
unsolicited riot, the
non-negotiable demand, the
unreprimanded blackmail of the
academic process. But in fact the
answer tends to be 'Yes, students
generally are quieter, more
introspective, and more serious
about their work.' For some
newsmen it probably seems like
losing an old friend, not to have
the campus revolution the biggest
show in town.
"(Let me hasten to say that
there are a good many honorable
exceptions. To name an
outstanding one, BillTrombley of
the Los Angeles Times, whose
comprehensive and probing
interest in higher education is
what one would expect from one
of the world's truly great
newspapers.)
"As for alumni audience, I find
they're deeply concerned about a
whole range of problems, from
the tuition scramble to the
question of how to preserve the
liberal arts while at the same time
equipping young people to play a
useful part in the world of
business, government, and the
professions.
"I've nevertheless chosen to
talk about students today, not
because they're embattled, but
because they are a very large part
of what the University is all
about, and because the subject is
endlessly interesting. It is, after
all, perhaps our strongest common
bond throughout this room. We've
all been students (and many of us
no doubt still are); we all know
other students; a lot of us are
supporting students—oh, how
we're supporting them!
'Supporting,' that's spelled with a
large 'S': that has two vertical
lines through it—a Capital'S,' one
might say.
"As you all know, Stanford is a
selective university. Cass &
Birnbaum, Comparative Guide to
American Colleges, is the bible of
the college entrance seeker, the
kind of book you find in a
bookstore with all the pages
well-thumbed even before anyone
has bought it. Cass & Birnbaum
put us in their highest category,
'Most Selective.' And thereby
hang some tales.
"(I'll have to use a few
numbers in this talk. Be reassured,
no higher mathematics will sneak
in-I'm personally too close to
being mathematically illiterate—or
innumerate—for that.)
'Most Selective.' For
undergraduates, that comes from

the fact that we get over 9,000
completed applications, admit
around 2,300, of whom
two-thirds actually show up to
enroll in September. A little over
twenty years ago, 85 percent of
the applicants to Stanford's
freshman class got admitted. Over
the last half-dozen years that
figure has hovered 1 around 25
percent.
"It's not possible to say
exactly how the 2,300 were culled
from the 9,000. No single
criterion applies. Academic
achievement and potential
obviously constitute the most
important single variable. But a
variety of other qualities are
sought, and found. Lately the
Dean of Admissions has been
looking particularly hard at things
like evidence of capacity to take
on and carry out a job—what
non-academics might call 'real
world experience.'(l've never been
able to see quite how the
University was exempt from being
part of the Real World. Certainly
our problems are real enough;
maybe it's the solutions that
sometimes seem unreal.)
"This year's freshman
class—the class of '76—doesn't
that add years to your age just to
hear?—this class came to Stanford
from 829 secondary schools, the
largest number ever. That reflects
Stanford's conscious effort to
spread the word, and not to
concentrate it in a few arbitrarily
chosen places. The freshmen come
from 44 states and the District of

Columbia, plus quite a number of
foreign lands. Overthree-fourthsof
them went to public high schools,
less than one-fourth to private
schools. Sixty per cent are men,
forty per cent are women. This
quite closely parallels the balance
of the sexes in the total pool of
applicants. There are now no
quotas or targets for either sex in
undergraduate admissions. The
gradual reduction to zero of
discrimination against women has
meant that the number of women
undergraduates at Stanford has
increased 27 percent since 1968,
while the total undergraduate
enrollment has gone up only 5
perent in that same time.
"Interestingly, this rise in
woman power hasn't meant a
corresponding drop in
enrollemtnts in such allegedly
non-feminine subjects as the
so-called hard sciences. Principles
of Biology enrolled some 500
students this Fall, a fifth more
than last year. The Chemistry
Department is relieved to find
that their introductory courses
have leveled off at 900, after
doubling in just two years.
Everybody wants to be a
Doctor—that's the shorthand
explanation. But I think
recognition that you don't get
very far by ducking the tough
academic challenges has
something to do with it, too.
"At the same time we're
remaining so selective, we've
clearly diversified the student
body greatly. I've mentioned the
rise of the women. You're all
aware of Stanford's effort, in high
gear since 1968, to find talented
students from among the hitherto
excluded and disadvantaged of
our society. Blacks, Chicanos and
American Indians now total about
15 percent of the undergraduate
student body.
"Has all of this, plus the
inexorable rise of tuition year
after year, meant that the great
American middle class is being
squeezed out? That's the question
I encounter most often in talking
about admissions, selectivity, and
so forth.
"Well, at risk of sounding
incurably academic, I have to say
that the picture isn't terribly clear
at this point. Until this year, we
thought we had a slightly ominous
clue in a rising attrition
rate—more students dropping out
after each quarter, so that by
Spring there were only B'/2
undergraduates left out of every
one hundred who had started in
the Fall. (Don't ask me where that
half-student had gone.) But this
year that mini-trend seems likely
to slow down, perhaps to stop.
"Of course even if they leave
you can't be sure why. Everyone
knows about Joe X, or Suzy Y
who transferred to UC because
the Stanford tuition got too
tough . But when we did a survey
last summer to see why one third
of the students whom we had
admitted went elsewhere, the
results didn't suggest that tuition
was the main problem. More than
one-quarter of the respondents
had chosen either a certain East
Coast conglomerate known as
Harvard-Radcliffe or its arch-rival,
Yale; about half chose other and
comparably expensive private
colleges; only a quarter wen to
publicly supported universities,
where tuition is low or nearly
non-existent.

"On the other hand, there were
signs of what one might call
middle class tuition resistance in
that a somewhat higher
proportion of those who were in
middle income brackets gave
finances as the primary reason for
going elsewhere than was the case
in either the lowest or the highest
brackets.
"So we're keeping a wary eye
on this problem. On the one hand,
it's hard to see why we should not

raise tuition for those in a
position to pay, when it still falls
considerably short of the cost of a
Stanford education in any field,
and when the cost of everything
we buy and the wages of everyone
we hire keep on rising. On the
other hand, we know that there is
real hardship at the margins of
eligibility for scholarship help. We
know also that it's tough to find a
formula for perfect justice. Why,
for instance, should we favor a
family in which only one parent
works, and there's considerable
indebtedness, over one in which
both parents work and the house
and car and color TV are all paid
for? Yet we do. But trying to find
the need formula that's fair
to all is a task for Solomon, and
though there are literally no less
than five people named Solomon
in this year's Faculty
Staff-Directory, none of them has
as yet solved our problem for us.

"Nearly five out of eleven
Stanford students are graduate
students of one kind or another.
This tends sometimes to be
forgotten, so strong is the
mythology of the undergraduate
years in American life. Did these
graduate students have as tough a
time getting in as the freshmen?
"It's hard to generalize. In
some of the professional schools,
the ratio of applicants to admitted
students was steeper still, steeper
than the Matterhorn, and about as
slippery. For 1971-72, over 3,000
people applied to the M.D.
program at the Stanford Medical
School. One hundred forty-three
were admitted, of whom slightly
more than one-half enrolled.
3,000 applicants, seventy-five
students at the end of the great
winnowing process. That's a lot of
disappointed people. And it's got
worse since—nearly 3,700
applicants for this year's class.
"Law is not quite so grim.
Instead of having only one chance
in 21 of being admitted, you had
just a hair more than one chance
in 10 if you applied to the
Stanford Law School in 1971.
"And so it goes. Not
uniformly—the odds are much
more in your favor if you pick
Engineering or Earth Sciences.
But that reflects a general,
national decline in interest in, and
preparedness for, those fields. I
suspect this will turn around when
young people start discovering
that nationally we'll soon be
graduating only about two-thirds
of the engineers we need. An
old-fashioned instrument called
the marketplace will begin to
make itself felt. And the challenge
of actually solving environmental
or energy problems, instead of
just wringing one's hands about
them, should play a part, too.
"Now what does all this mean?
do all these numbers mean that
the main thing is growth, and still
more growth? Do they mean that
all we're focusing on is more of
the same—more selectivity, larger
numbers of disappointed
applicants left out in the cold,
tougher standards of admission,
just so we can brag about ourselves
and feel that because so many
people want in—and because we're
so expensive—we must be good?
"To begin with, we could no
doubt ease the pressure by
admitting more students, letting
ourselves grow larger. We don't
choose to do this. For several
years Stanford has been hovering
around 11,000 to 11,500 total
students (exclusing the so-called
terminal graduate students—not a
fatal disease, just the condition
you'r n in when you've finished
your residence requirements but
not licked the dissertation yet).
One of the clearcut advantages of
the private college or university is
that it need not grow in response

would it make not to exercise care
in selecting those potential
students who are best equipped to
make intelligent and productive
use of these academic resources?
It doesn't bother me if our
students of English are articulate
before they get to us, or if some
of our would-be engineers have
been playing scales on the slide
rule since the age of six. It would
bother me if one had to be a
genius to have a reasonable chance
for admission—but that isn't so. I
ask your indulgence to quote
from a document many of you
have probably read—a letter which
Fred Hargadon, Dean of
Admissions, sends to prospective
applicants. . . we can (and do)
exercise judgments relating to
factors over and above academic
ability in selecting a freshman
class,' he writes. (Some day I'll
pick a bone with Fred about that
'over and above'—l'd prefer
'beyond'or simply and colorlessly
'other than' since as an academic I

to every demand of the moment.
We're not planning to throw that

going elsewhere than was the case
in either the lowest or the highest
brackets.
"So we're keeping a wary eye
on this problem. On the one hand,
it's hard to see why we should not

raise tuition for those in a
position to pay, when it still falls
considerably short of the cost of a
Stanford education in any field,
and when the cost of everything
we buy and the wages of everyone
we hire keep on rising. On the
other hand, we know that there is
real hardship at the margins of
eligibility for scholarship help. We
know also that it's tough to find a
formula for perfect justice. Why,
for instance, should we favor a
family in which only one parent
works, and there's considerable
indebtedness, over one in which
both parents work and the house
and car and color TV are all paid
for? Yet we do. But trying to find
the need formula that's fair
to all is a task for Solomon, and
though there are literally no less
than five people named Solomon
in this year's Faculty
Staff-Directory, none of them has
as yet solved our problem for us.

"Nearly five out of eleven
Stanford students are graduate
students of one kind or another.
This tends sometimes to be
forgotten, so strong is the
mythology of the undergraduate
years in American life. Did these
graduate students have as tough a
time getting in as the freshmen?
"It's hard to generalize. In
some of the professional schools,
the ratio of applicants to admitted
students was steeper still, steeper
than the Matterhorn, and about as
slippery. For 1971-72, over 3,000
people applied to the M.D.
program at the Stanford Medical
School. One hundred forty-three
were admitted, of whom slightly
more than one-half enrolled.
3,000 applicants, seventy-five
students at the end of the great
winnowing process. That's a lot of
disappointed people. And it's got
worse since—nearly 3,700
applicants for this year's class.
"Law is not quite so grim.
Instead of having only one chance
in 21 of being admitted, you had
just a hair more than one chance
in 10 if you applied to the
Stanford Law School in 1971.
"And so it goes. Not
uniformly—the odds are much
more in your favor if you pick
Engineering or Earth Sciences.
But that reflects a general,
national decline in interest in, and
preparedness for, those fields. I
suspect this will turn around when
young people start discovering
that nationally we'll soon be
graduating only about two-thirds
of the engineers we need. An
old-fashioned instrument called
the marketplace will begin to
make itself felt. And the challenge
of actually solving environmental
or energy problems, instead of
just wringing one's hands about
them, should play a part, too.
"Now what does all this mean?
do all these numbers mean that
the main thing is growth, and still
more growth? Do they mean that
all we're focusing on is more of
the same—more selectivity, larger
numbers of disappointed
applicants left out in the cold,
tougher standards of admission,
just so we can brag about ourselves
and feel that because so many
people want in—and because we're
so expensive—we must be good?
"To begin with, we could no
doubt ease the pressure by
admitting more students, letting
ourselves grow larger. We don't
choose to do this. For several
years Stanford has been hovering
around 11,000 to 11,500 total
students (exclusing the so-called
terminal graduate students—not a
fatal disease, just the condition
you'r n in when you've finished
your residence requirements but
not licked the dissertation yet).
One of the clearcut advantages of
the private college or university is
that it need not grow in response

would it make not to exercise care
in selecting those potential
students who are best equipped to
make intelligent and productive
use of these academic resources?
It doesn't bother me if our
students of English are articulate
before they get to us, or if some
of our would-be engineers have
been playing scales on the slide
rule since the age of six. It would
bother me if one had to be a
genius to have a reasonable chance
for admission—but that isn't so. I
ask your indulgence to quote
from a document many of you
have probably read—a letter which
Fred Hargadon, Dean of
Admissions, sends to prospective
applicants. . . we can (and do)
exercise judgments relating to
factors over and above academic
ability in selecting a freshman
class,' he writes. (Some day I'll
pick a bone with Fred about that
'over and above'—l'd prefer
'beyond'or simply and colorlessly
'other than' since as an academic I

to every demand of the moment.
We're not planning to throw that
advantage out.
"But we're not in love with
selectivity for its own sake, either.
Quite a number of critics of
higher education have been
pointing out lately that it's small
wonder the best colleges tend to
turn out an unfair share of the
best-equipped graduates—they
only accept the best-equipped
applicants to begin with. We are,
so the criticism goes, guilty of
making silk purses out of silk.
"I'm afraid my chief response
to that is, 'Sure, why not?' The
leading colleges and universities,
whether public or private, have
gone to considerable lengths to
bring together the most talented
faculty they could find, to build
great library collections, to
develop formidable laboratories
and computer facilities, and so on.
Having done this, what sense

have trouble placing
other considerations, however
important, clearly 'above'
academic ability in this context,
and I'm fairly sure that Fred does
too. He gets equal time in the
panel this afternoon, if I've
misrepresented him.) Anyhow,
Fred goes on to cite
'exceptionally well developed
talents in areas such as the arts,
music, athletics, and leadership,'
and also to stress 'diversity in
backgrounds, values, and
educational objectives.' '. . . we
recognize a broad range of
excellence, realizing that
excellence itself does not always
and everywhere come in uniform
dimensions.' To that I can only
say, Amen...
"Still, the efforts include
attention to diversity, and to
opening up opportunity to people
who haven't had much of it until
recently. It's significant that the
Stanford School of
Engineering,which enrolls about 4
percent of the total graduate
student population of the United
States in engineering, enrolls some
7 percnet of the country's total of
women engineering graduate
students. Also that when Stanford
awarded six master's degree
candidates in all fields of
engineering in the entire nation.
Clearly, to paraphrase Robert
Frost, we have 'miles to go before
we sleep.'
"Diversity has another
dimension worth exploring: age.
"What is being said nowadays
on this subject is familiar enough:
that less and less will education
beyond the high school be
confined to the traditional time
periods; more and more people
will 'stop out' from time to time,
and correspondingly more will
re-enter colleges and universities
after periods, often long periods,
of working for a living. Married
women, their children grown up,
will return to refurbish old skills
or obtain new ones. Refresher
courses of all sorts and sizes will
be needed in the seemingly
endless fight we all face to stave
off personal obsolescence in the
age of future shock.
"Stanford is not likely to
become a vast center for

'extension courses' in the old
meaning of the term. But even
now the University, or parts of it,
are doing more than is generally
recognized to reach out to alumni
and others who are past the
traditional college-going years.
The Observer for January covered
these efforts well, and I shan't try
to repeat it all. From the Summer
Alumni College, through the
volumes entitled Portable
Stanford, to specialized and
concentrated refresher programs
in the Medical School and the
Graduate School of Business,
continuing education goes on in
many forms. I might point to the
obvious: You've shown your
interest in it by coming here
today.
"The point is that Stanford
must reach out to all—and they
are a rapidly growing
number—who see their University
as something more than a place to
look back upon with nostalgia, or
a place where strange and
incomprehensible young people
are doing strange and
incomprehensible things. There's
nothing quite so good for

lowering the incomprehensibility
level than to be learning together.
"What does it all add up to? A
university with a number of
different kinds of education going
on for the benefit of an ever
greater variety of students, but
linked through a common focus
upon quality. The focus doesn't
always work; even with
admissions ratios like ten to one
or twenty to one, not every
student who comes to Stanford
finds it was the right choice. (And
Stanford has now and then been
known to entertain a twinge of
doubt as to its end of the deal, for
that matter.) The difficulty of
pursuing quality in a great variety
of educational enterprises is
always there; the difficulty these
days in finding the resources to
support high quality is something
of which we're all too sharply
aware. But a university, any
university, is principally the
people who com rose it. Given
that fact, it seems to me Stanford
has every reason to feel at least a
sober confidence as it faces the
future."

"Yes, students generally are quieter, more introsoective,
and more serious about their work. For some newsmen
it probably seems like losing an old friend, not to have
the campus revolution the biggest show in town."

"The point is that Stanford must reach out to all—and
they are a rapidly growing number-who see their
University as something more than a place to look back

(Editor's Note: The following
remarks were delivered by
President Richard Lyman at a Los
Angeles alumni conference at the
Century Plaza Hotel last Sunday.)
"For the past half-dozen years
or so, the Student Problem has
been the uppermost thing on the
mind of anyone upon meeting a
college president. Newspeople
especially. It got to the point
where beleaguered presidents were
raising the subject first, in the
hope—usually a vain one—that
they could that way retain some
shreds of the initiative, or at least
set the stage for the bad news as
gently as possible.
"For some time now, however,
media people have tended to raise
the subject almost nostalgically:
'Is it true that things are all quiet
how?' they'll ask, as if they half
hoped one would surprise them
by saying 'no,' and then they'd be
back on familiar ground—the
unsolicited riot, the
non-negotiable demand, the
unreprimanded blackmail of the
academic process. But in fact the
answer tends to be 'Yes, students
generally are quieter, more
introspective, and more serious
about their work.' For some
newsmen it probably seems like
losing an old friend, not to have
the campus revolution the biggest
show in town.
"(Let me hasten to say that
there are a good many honorable
exceptions. To name an
outstanding one, BillTrombley of
the Los Angeles Times, whose
comprehensive and probing
interest in higher education is
what one would expect from one
of the world's truly great
newspapers.)
"As for alumni audience, I find
they're deeply concerned about a
whole range of problems, from
the tuition scramble to the
question of how to preserve the
liberal arts while at the same time
equipping young people to play a
useful part in the world of
business, government, and the
professions.
"I've nevertheless chosen to
talk about students today, not
because they're embattled, but
because they are a very large part
of what the University is all
about, and because the subject is
endlessly interesting. It is, after
all, perhaps our strongest common
bond throughout this room. We've
all been students (and many of us
no doubt still are); we all know
other students; a lot of us are
supporting students—oh, how
we're supporting them!
'Supporting,' that's spelled with a
large 'S': that has two vertical
lines through it—a Capital'S,' one
might say.
"As you all know, Stanford is a
selective university. Cass &
Birnbaum, Comparative Guide to
American Colleges, is the bible of
the college entrance seeker, the
kind of book you find in a
bookstore with all the pages
well-thumbed even before anyone
has bought it. Cass & Birnbaum
put us in their highest category,
'Most Selective.' And thereby
hang some tales.
"(I'll have to use a few
numbers in this talk. Be reassured,
no higher mathematics will sneak
in-I'm personally too close to
being mathematically illiterate—or
innumerate—for that.)
'Most Selective.' For
undergraduates, that comes from

the fact that we get over 9,000
completed applications, admit
around 2,300, of whom
two-thirds actually show up to
enroll in September. A little over
twenty years ago, 85 percent of
the applicants to Stanford's
freshman class got admitted. Over
the last half-dozen years that
figure has hovered 1 around 25
percent.
"It's not possible to say
exactly how the 2,300 were culled
from the 9,000. No single
criterion applies. Academic
achievement and potential
obviously constitute the most
important single variable. But a
variety of other qualities are
sought, and found. Lately the
Dean of Admissions has been
looking particularly hard at things
like evidence of capacity to take
on and carry out a job—what
non-academics might call 'real
world experience.'(l've never been
able to see quite how the
University was exempt from being
part of the Real World. Certainly
our problems are real enough;
maybe it's the solutions that
sometimes seem unreal.)
"This year's freshman
class—the class of '76—doesn't
that add years to your age just to
hear?—this class came to Stanford
from 829 secondary schools, the
largest number ever. That reflects
Stanford's conscious effort to
spread the word, and not to
concentrate it in a few arbitrarily
chosen places. The freshmen come
from 44 states and the District of

Columbia, plus quite a number of
foreign lands. Overthree-fourthsof
them went to public high schools,
less than one-fourth to private
schools. Sixty per cent are men,
forty per cent are women. This
quite closely parallels the balance
of the sexes in the total pool of
applicants. There are now no
quotas or targets for either sex in
undergraduate admissions. The
gradual reduction to zero of
discrimination against women has
meant that the number of women
undergraduates at Stanford has
increased 27 percent since 1968,
while the total undergraduate
enrollment has gone up only 5
perent in that same time.
"Interestingly, this rise in
woman power hasn't meant a
corresponding drop in
enrollemtnts in such allegedly
non-feminine subjects as the
so-called hard sciences. Principles
of Biology enrolled some 500
students this Fall, a fifth more
than last year. The Chemistry
Department is relieved to find
that their introductory courses
have leveled off at 900, after
doubling in just two years.
Everybody wants to be a
Doctor—that's the shorthand
explanation. But I think
recognition that you don't get
very far by ducking the tough
academic challenges has
something to do with it, too.
"At the same time we're
remaining so selective, we've
clearly diversified the student
body greatly. I've mentioned the
rise of the women. You're all
aware of Stanford's effort, in high
gear since 1968, to find talented
students from among the hitherto
excluded and disadvantaged of
our society. Blacks, Chicanos and
American Indians now total about
15 percent of the undergraduate
student body.
"Has all of this, plus the
inexorable rise of tuition year
after year, meant that the great
American middle class is being
squeezed out? That's the question
I encounter most often in talking
about admissions, selectivity, and
so forth.
"Well, at risk of sounding
incurably academic, I have to say
that the picture isn't terribly clear
at this point. Until this year, we
thought we had a slightly ominous
clue in a rising attrition
rate—more students dropping out
after each quarter, so that by
Spring there were only B'/2
undergraduates left out of every
one hundred who had started in
the Fall. (Don't ask me where that
half-student had gone.) But this
year that mini-trend seems likely
to slow down, perhaps to stop.
"Of course even if they leave
you can't be sure why. Everyone
knows about Joe X, or Suzy Y
who transferred to UC because
the Stanford tuition got too
tough . But when we did a survey
last summer to see why one third
of the students whom we had
admitted went elsewhere, the
results didn't suggest that tuition
was the main problem. More than
one-quarter of the respondents
had chosen either a certain East
Coast conglomerate known as
Harvard-Radcliffe or its arch-rival,
Yale; about half chose other and
comparably expensive private
colleges; only a quarter wen to
publicly supported universities,
where tuition is low or nearly
non-existent.

"On the other hand, there were
signs of what one might call
middle class tuition resistance in
that a somewhat higher
proportion of those who were in
middle income brackets gave
finances as the primary reason for
going elsewhere than was the case
in either the lowest or the highest
brackets.
"So we're keeping a wary eye
on this problem. On the one hand,
it's hard to see why we should not

raise tuition for those in a
position to pay, when it still falls
considerably short of the cost of a
Stanford education in any field,

works, and there's considerable
indebtedness, over one in which
both parents work and the house
and car and color TV are all paid
for? Yet we do. But trying to find
the need formula that's fair
to all is a task for Solomon, and
though there are literally no less
than five people named Solomon

Staff-Directory, none of them has
as yet solved our problem for us.

two-thirds actually show up to
enroll in September. A little over
twenty years ago, 85 percent of
the applicants to Stanford's
freshman class got admitted. Over
the last half-dozen years that
figure has hovered 1 around 25
percent.
"It's not possible to say
exactly how the 2,300 were culled
from the 9,000. No single
criterion applies. Academic
achievement and potential
obviously constitute the most
important single variable. But a
variety of other qualities are
sought, and found. Lately the
Dean of Admissions has been
looking particularly hard at things
like evidence of capacity to take
on and carry out a job—what
non-academics might call 'real
world experience.'(l've never been
able to see quite how the
University was exempt from being
part of the Real World. Certainly
our problems are real enough;
maybe it's the solutions that
sometimes seem unreal.)
"This year's freshman
class—the class of '76—doesn't
that add years to your age just to
hear?—this class came to Stanford
from 829 secondary schools, the
largest number ever. That reflects
Stanford's conscious effort to
spread the word, and not to
concentrate it in a few arbitrarily
chosen places. The freshmen come
from 44 states and the District of

Columbia, plus quite a number of
foreign lands. Overthree-fourthsof
them went to public high schools,
less than one-fourth to private
schools. Sixty per cent are men,
forty per cent are women. This
quite closely parallels the balance
of the sexes in the total pool of
applicants. There are now no
quotas or targets for either sex in
undergraduate admissions. The
gradual reduction to zero of
discrimination against women has
meant that the number of women
undergraduates at Stanford has
increased 27 percent since 1968,
while the total undergraduate
enrollment has gone up only 5
perent in that same time.
"Interestingly, this rise in
woman power hasn't meant a
corresponding drop in
enrollemtnts in such allegedly
non-feminine subjects as the
so-called hard sciences. Principles
of Biology enrolled some 500
students this Fall, a fifth more
than last year. The Chemistry
Department is relieved to find
that their introductory courses
have leveled off at 900, after
doubling in just two years.
Everybody wants to be a
Doctor—that's the shorthand
explanation. But I think
recognition that you don't get
very far by ducking the tough
academic challenges has
something to do with it, too.
"At the same time we're
remaining so selective, we've
clearly diversified the student
body greatly. I've mentioned the
rise of the women. You're all
aware of Stanford's effort, in high
gear since 1968, to find talented
students from among the hitherto
excluded and disadvantaged of
our society. Blacks, Chicanos and
American Indians now total about
15 percent of the undergraduate
student body.
"Has all of this, plus the
inexorable rise of tuition year
after year, meant that the great
American middle class is being
squeezed out? That's the question
I encounter most often in talking
about admissions, selectivity, and
so forth.
"Well, at risk of sounding
incurably academic, I have to say
that the picture isn't terribly clear
at this point. Until this year, we
thought we had a slightly ominous
clue in a rising attrition
rate—more students dropping out
after each quarter, so that by
Spring there were only B'/2
undergraduates left out of every
one hundred who had started in
the Fall. (Don't ask me where that
half-student had gone.) But this
year that mini-trend seems likely
to slow down, perhaps to stop.
"Of course even if they leave
you can't be sure why. Everyone
knows about Joe X, or Suzy Y
who transferred to UC because
the Stanford tuition got too
tough . But when we did a survey
last summer to see why one third
of the students whom we had
admitted went elsewhere, the
results didn't suggest that tuition
was the main problem. More than
one-quarter of the respondents
had chosen either a certain East
Coast conglomerate known as
Harvard-Radcliffe or its arch-rival,
Yale; about half chose other and
comparably expensive private
colleges; only a quarter wen to
publicly supported universities,
where tuition is low or nearly
non-existent.

"On the other hand, there were
signs of what one might call
middle class tuition resistance in
that a somewhat higher
proportion of those who were in
middle income brackets gave
finances as the primary reason for
going elsewhere than was the case
in either the lowest or the highest
brackets.
"So we're keeping a wary eye
on this problem. On the one hand,
it's hard to see why we should not

raise tuition for those in a
position to pay, when it still falls
considerably short of the cost of a
Stanford education in any field,
and when the cost of everything
we buy and the wages of everyone
we hire keep on rising. On the
other hand, we know that there is
real hardship at the margins of
eligibility for scholarship help. We
know also that it's tough to find a
formula for perfect justice. Why,
for instance, should we favor a
family in which only one parent
works, and there's considerable
indebtedness, over one in which
both parents work and the house
and car and color TV are all paid
for? Yet we do. But trying to find
the need formula that's fair
to all is a task for Solomon, and
though there are literally no less
than five people named Solomon
in this year's Faculty
Staff-Directory, none of them has
as yet solved our problem for us.

"Nearly five out of eleven
Stanford students are graduate
students of one kind or another.
This tends sometimes to be
forgotten, so strong is the
mythology of the undergraduate
years in American life. Did these
graduate students have as tough a
time getting in as the freshmen?
"It's hard to generalize. In
some of the professional schools,
the ratio of applicants to admitted
students was steeper still, steeper
than the Matterhorn, and about as
slippery. For 1971-72, over 3,000
people applied to the M.D.
program at the Stanford Medical
School. One hundred forty-three
were admitted, of whom slightly
more than one-half enrolled.
3,000 applicants, seventy-five
students at the end of the great
winnowing process. That's a lot of
disappointed people. And it's got
worse since—nearly 3,700
applicants for this year's class.
"Law is not quite so grim.
Instead of having only one chance
in 21 of being admitted, you had
just a hair more than one chance
in 10 if you applied to the
Stanford Law School in 1971.
"And so it goes. Not
uniformly—the odds are much
more in your favor if you pick
Engineering or Earth Sciences.
But that reflects a general,
national decline in interest in, and
preparedness for, those fields. I
suspect this will turn around when
young people start discovering
that nationally we'll soon be
graduating only about two-thirds
of the engineers we need. An
old-fashioned instrument called
the marketplace will begin to
make itself felt. And the challenge
of actually solving environmental
or energy problems, instead of
just wringing one's hands about
them, should play a part, too.
"Now what does all this mean?
do all these numbers mean that
the main thing is growth, and still
more growth? Do they mean that
all we're focusing on is more of
the same—more selectivity, larger
numbers of disappointed
applicants left out in the cold,
tougher standards of admission,
just so we can brag about ourselves
and feel that because so many
people want in—and because we're
so expensive—we must be good?
"To begin with, we could no
doubt ease the pressure by
admitting more students, letting
ourselves grow larger. We don't
choose to do this. For several
years Stanford has been hovering
around 11,000 to 11,500 total
students (exclusing the so-called
terminal graduate students—not a
fatal disease, just the condition
you'r n in when you've finished
your residence requirements but
not licked the dissertation yet).
One of the clearcut advantages of
the private college or university is
that it need not grow in response

would it make not to exercise care
in selecting those potential
students who are best equipped to
make intelligent and productive
use of these academic resources?
It doesn't bother me if our
students of English are articulate
before they get to us, or if some
of our would-be engineers have
been playing scales on the slide
rule since the age of six. It would
bother me if one had to be a
genius to have a reasonable chance
for admission—but that isn't so. I
ask your indulgence to quote
from a document many of you
have probably read—a letter which
Fred Hargadon, Dean of
Admissions, sends to prospective
applicants. . . we can (and do)
exercise judgments relating to
factors over and above academic
ability in selecting a freshman
class,' he writes. (Some day I'll
pick a bone with Fred about that
'over and above'—l'd prefer
'beyond'or simply and colorlessly
'other than' since as an academic I

to every demand of the moment.
We're not planning to throw that
advantage out.
"But we're not in love with
selectivity for its own sake, either.
Quite a number of critics of
higher education have been
pointing out lately that it's small
wonder the best colleges tend to
turn out an unfair share of the
best-equipped graduates—they
only accept the best-equipped
applicants to begin with. We are,
so the criticism goes, guilty of
making silk purses out of silk.
"I'm afraid my chief response
to that is, 'Sure, why not?' The
leading colleges and universities,
whether public or private, have
gone to considerable lengths to
bring together the most talented
faculty they could find, to build
great library collections, to
develop formidable laboratories
and computer facilities, and so on.
Having done this, what sense

have trouble placing
other considerations, however
important, clearly 'above'
academic ability in this context,
and I'm fairly sure that Fred does
too. He gets equal time in the
panel this afternoon, if I've
misrepresented him.) Anyhow,
Fred goes on to cite
'exceptionally well developed
talents in areas such as the arts,
music, athletics, and leadership,'
and also to stress 'diversity in
backgrounds, values, and
educational objectives.' '. . . we
recognize a broad range of
excellence, realizing that
excellence itself does not always
and everywhere come in uniform
dimensions.' To that I can only
say, Amen...
"Still, the efforts include
attention to diversity, and to
opening up opportunity to people
who haven't had much of it until
recently. It's significant that the
Stanford School of
Engineering,which enrolls about 4
percent of the total graduate
student population of the United
States in engineering, enrolls some
7 percnet of the country's total of
women engineering graduate
students. Also that when Stanford
awarded six master's degree
candidates in all fields of
engineering in the entire nation.
Clearly, to paraphrase Robert
Frost, we have 'miles to go before
we sleep.'
"Diversity has another
dimension worth exploring: age.
"What is being said nowadays
on this subject is familiar enough:
that less and less will education
beyond the high school be
confined to the traditional time
periods; more and more people
will 'stop out' from time to time,
and correspondingly more will
re-enter colleges and universities
after periods, often long periods,
of working for a living. Married
women, their children grown up,
will return to refurbish old skills
or obtain new ones. Refresher
courses of all sorts and sizes will
be needed in the seemingly
endless fight we all face to stave
off personal obsolescence in the
age of future shock.
"Stanford is not likely to
become a vast center for

'extension courses' in the old
meaning of the term. But even
now the University, or parts of it,
are doing more than is generally
recognized to reach out to alumni
and others who are past the
traditional college-going years.
The Observer for January covered
these efforts well, and I shan't try
to repeat it all. From the Summer
Alumni College, through the
volumes entitled Portable
Stanford, to specialized and
concentrated refresher programs
in the Medical School and the
Graduate School of Business,
continuing education goes on in
many forms. I might point to the
obvious: You've shown your
interest in it by coming here
today.
"The point is that Stanford
must reach out to all—and they
are a rapidly growing
number—who see their University
as something more than a place to
look back upon with nostalgia, or
a place where strange and
incomprehensible young people
are doing strange and
incomprehensible things. There's
nothing quite so good for

lowering the incomprehensibility
level than to be learning together.
"What does it all add up to? A
university with a number of
different kinds of education going
on for the benefit of an ever
greater variety of students, but
linked through a common focus
upon quality. The focus doesn't
always work; even with
admissions ratios like ten to one
or twenty to one, not every
student who comes to Stanford
finds it was the right choice. (And
Stanford has now and then been
known to entertain a twinge of
doubt as to its end of the deal, for
that matter.) The difficulty of
pursuing quality in a great variety
of educational enterprises is
always there; the difficulty these
days in finding the resources to
support high quality is something
of which we're all too sharply
aware. But a university, any
university, is principally the
people who com rose it. Given
that fact, it seems to me Stanford
has every reason to feel at least a
sober confidence as it faces the
future."

"Yes, students generally are quieter, more introsoective,
and more serious about their work. For some newsmen
it probably seems like losing an old friend, not to have
the campus revolution the biggest show in town."

"The point is that Stanford must reach out to all—and
they are a rapidly growing number-who see their
University as something more than a place to look back
upon with nostalgia, or a place where strange and
incomprehensible young people are doing strange and
incomprehensible things."
(Editor's Note: The following
remarks were delivered by
President Richard Lyman at a Los
Angeles alumni conference at the
Century Plaza Hotel last Sunday.)
"For the past half-dozen years
or so, the Student Problem has
been the uppermost thing on the
mind of anyone upon meeting a
college president. Newspeople
especially. It got to the point
where beleaguered presidents were
raising the subject first, in the
hope—usually a vain one—that
they could that way retain some
shreds of the initiative, or at least
set the stage for the bad news as
gently as possible.
"For some time now, however,
media people have tended to raise
the subject almost nostalgically:
'Is it true that things are all quiet
how?' they'll ask, as if they half
hoped one would surprise them
by saying 'no,' and then they'd be
back on familiar ground—the
unsolicited riot, the
non-negotiable demand, the
unreprimanded blackmail of the
academic process. But in fact the
answer tends to be 'Yes, students
generally are quieter, more
introspective, and more serious
about their work.' For some
newsmen it probably seems like
losing an old friend, not to have
the campus revolution the biggest
show in town.
"(Let me hasten to say that
there are a good many honorable
exceptions. To name an
outstanding one, BillTrombley of
the Los Angeles Times, whose
comprehensive and probing
interest in higher education is
what one would expect from one
of the world's truly great
newspapers.)
"As for alumni audience, I find
they're deeply concerned about a
whole range of problems, from
the tuition scramble to the
question of how to preserve the
liberal arts while at the same time
equipping young people to play a
useful part in the world of
business, government, and the
professions.
"I've nevertheless chosen to
talk about students today, not
because they're embattled, but
because they are a very large part
of what the University is all
about, and because the subject is
endlessly interesting. It is, after
all, perhaps our strongest common
bond throughout this room. We've
all been students (and many of us
no doubt still are); we all know
other students; a lot of us are
supporting students—oh, how
we're supporting them!
'Supporting,' that's spelled with a
large 'S': that has two vertical
lines through it—a Capital'S,' one
might say.
"As you all know, Stanford is a
selective university. Cass &
Birnbaum, Comparative Guide to
American Colleges, is the bible of
the college entrance seeker, the
kind of book you find in a
bookstore with all the pages
well-thumbed even before anyone
has bought it. Cass & Birnbaum
put us in their highest category,
'Most Selective.' And thereby
hang some tales.
"(I'll have to use a few
numbers in this talk. Be reassured,
no higher mathematics will sneak
in-I'm personally too close to
being mathematically illiterate—or
innumerate—for that.)
'Most Selective.' For
undergraduates, that comes from

the fact that we get over 9,000
completed applications, admit
around 2,300, of whom
two-thirds actually show up to
enroll in September. A little over
twenty years ago, 85 percent of
the applicants to Stanford's
freshman class got admitted. Over
the last half-dozen years that
figure has hovered 1 around 25

level than to be learning together.
"What does it all add up to? A
university with a number of
different kinds of education going
on for the benefit of an ever
greater variety of students, but
linked through a common focus
upon quality. The focus doesn't
always work; even with
admissions ratios like ten to one
or twenty to one, not every
student who comes to Stanford
finds it was the right choice. (And
Stanford has now and then been
known to entertain a twinge of
doubt as to its end of the deal, for
that matter.) The difficulty of
pursuing quality in a great variety
of educational enterprises is
always there; the difficulty these
days in finding the resources to
support high quality is something
of which we're all too sharply
aware. But a university, any
university, is principally the
people who com rose it. Given
that fact, it seems to me Stanford
has every reason to feel at least a
sober confidence as it faces the
future."

"Yes, students generally are quieter, more introsoective,
and more serious about their work. For some newsmen
it probably seems like losing an old friend, not to have
the campus revolution the biggest show in town."

"The point is that Stanford must reach out to all—and
they are a rapidly growing number-who see their
University as something more than a place to look back
upon with nostalgia, or a place where strange and
incomprehensible young people are doing strange and
incomprehensible things."
