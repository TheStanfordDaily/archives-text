# 'BUG ME'

### 
Like anyone who buys a parking permit, I purchased one to have a
place to park. Yet the other day all parking places were taken either
by registered cars in my dorm, staff permits, or cars without permits. I
was forced to park in another permit area, not staff, and recived a
parking ticket from Santa Clara County police. Where am I to park
when my designated area is full? Are more parking permits sold than
spaces available? What status do staff permits have? And, why must I
pay a $2.00 parking ticket when 1 purchased a parking permit so I
would not have such tickets to pay? D.S.
—If your designated area is full you can use an "open" parking lot
or a time-limit zone, Maps showing these parking areas are available
from Police Services, near the corner of Serra Street and Campus
Drive. In general, it is safe to park along a curb if it is not painted red
and if there are no signs limiting or prohibiting parking in that area.
—There are about 20,000 registered vehicles and 11,646 marked
parking spaces. Don't panic—according to the Information Desk at
Police Services, they often register more than one car for a single
person, and all registered cars are not on campus at the same time. It
does indeed look like there are more registered cars than parking
places, but no one seems to know what the exact ratio of registered
cars on campus to parking spaces is at any given time.
—Staff permits have the same status as any other type of permit. If
a car with a staff permit is parked illegally, it will be ticketed. Staff
members must park in areas marked "staff" unless they are connected
with a particular University residence. In that case, they have a special
parking permit which allows them to park in the residence parking lot.
—When your car is ticketed, you have to pay a fine. According to
the Information Desk at Police Services, "a parking permit doesn't
guarantee you a space. It is only a license to hunt for one."
