# Secolo Barocco Shows Little Appreciation Of Subleties
## 
### BRUCE LAMOTT 
"All Baroque music sounds alike."
Regrettably this sometime-heard remark gains
credibility if one accepts the performance of
Secolo Barocco in Dinkelspiel Friday,
February 2, as representative of the "Baroque
Century" implied by their name.
This quintet of accomplished
instrumentalists played works by several
eighteenth-century composers. The
performers demonstrated little appreciation of
stylistic differentiation within the period, or
of the subtleties of ensemble playing.
Their technical mastery is beyond
question; their tone is warm and full-bodied.
Intonation and passage-work were accurate.
However, the artistry of such an ensemble
must be measured by their use of these means
to achieve a satisfying musical result.
The ensemble devoted little attention to
the specific musical content of the works,
choosing rather to use them as vehicles for
virtuosic display. Though composers
characteristically divide melodic interest
among the several parts, the performers

neglected to relinquish their soloistic roles.
Flutist Michel Debost, founder of the
group, played Vivaldi's "La Pastorella"
Concerto intent on domination, rather than
interplay between solo and tutti. In
subsequent works, even the Trio Sonata No. 8
in D by Leclair with bassoonist Arnaury
Wallez, he seldom deferred his assertive tone
and gesture to accomodate the other parts.
Possibly this was the kind of 'balance' heard
when Frederick the Great played the flute in
ensemble with his subjects.
In the Trio Sonata in G by J.S. Bach,
violinist Jacques-Francis Manzone
demonstrated a lack of differentiation
between solo and accompanimental passages;
this also marred the larger ensembles. His
partner, oboist Jacques Chambon, performed
with little rhythmic nuance or dynamic
inflection.
Harpsichordist Joel Fernand Pontet had
perhaps the greatest musical command of the
works. His continuo realization for the Corelli
Violin Sonata No. 4 in F compensated for the
lack of imagination in the solo line. He was,

however, encumbered by Stanford's worst
instrument—fine furniture, but an
embarassment in confronting a guest artist.
Even with full registration, it sounds as if it
were being played backstage.
General remarks suffice for the C Minor
Trio Sonata by Telemann, the E Minor
Concerto by de Boismortier, and a quintet by
J.S. Bach. The reading of the fast movements
was impatient and perfunctory. Square-cut
phrases and dynamic rigidity coupled with
tempo disputes robbed the music of grace and
poise.
Though the persistent agitation of late
Baroque passage-work is intrinsically exciting,
it grows monotonous when executed with the
regularity of a sewing machine. For artists of
this calibre, such a level of interpretation
could be expected from sight-reading.
The audience, enthusiastic nonetheless, was
treated to the Mozart Rondo for Glass
Harmonica (played on celesta) as an encore.
The second encore was introduced by M.
Debost as "Vivaldi." Which Vivaldi, you ask?
It really doesn't matter—it all sounds alike.
