# Lateiner Performs Brilliantly
## 
### MICHAEL SAFFLE 
There are many fine pianists,
but few really great ones. Jacob
Lateiner demonstrated greatness
in a brilliant recital at Dinkelspiel
last Friday night, one that earned
over a dozen curtain calls for
performances that proved him
equal to any technical or artistic
tasks Romantic music can offer.
Known as a Beethoven
specialist (as well as a collector of
rare Beethoven editions and
memorabilia), Lateiner opened his
program with the famed
"Waldstein" Sonata, a repertory
chestnut many concert-goers
would rather not hear so often.
I'm certain anyone could have
listened all day to Lateiner's
powerful performance, backed by
fiery passagework and held in
place by those brisk tempo which
the Master himself
prescribed — and which few
pianists handle capably.
Poise and Polish
A few listeners may have
noticed a few, tiny imperfections,
generally slightly blurred

passagework or somewhat
indistinct accompaniments in the
"Waldstein" first movement.
Lateiner proved during
subsequent movements that any
errors were caused merely by an
unfamiliar (and somewhat
unresponsive) instrument. The
rest of the concert demonstrated
consistent poise and technical
polish.
Two Schubert "Impromptus"
and Chopin's formidable c-sharp
minor "Scherzo" followed the
"Waldstein." Lateiner's Schubert
was as lovely and charming as his
Beethoven had been forceful and
scintillating, although some
people might have preferred a
somewhat slower tempo in the
middle section of the second Opus
90 Impromptu. Chopin's
"Scherzo" was as flamingly
brilliant and incisive as anyone
could wish. Lateiner created witty
changes of dynamics in the
repetitions of the principal
thematic material, and a
slam-bang finish that had many
members of the audience on their

feet before the intermission.
Schumann's impressive
"Fantasie," Opus 17, concluded
Lateimer's recital, and offered a
demonstration of what must be
the final test of musicianship.
Throughout the opening
movement Lateiner's resources
never faltered; each section of this
multi-faceted masterpiece came to
life through a well paced,
breathtaking performance.
Accuracy Faltered
In the middle movement,
however, Lateiner's
accuracy—though not his
musicianship—faltered: incorrect
notes both on the first playing
and again on the repetition filled
an important section.
Lateiner's musical instincts,
however, carried him through
even these blunders.
As if in gratitude the "Fantasie's"
final movement lived and
breathed under Lateiner's hands, a
pianistic vision equalled in
technique on several recordings
but uniquely unforgettable in the
concert hall.

Many of us had hoped for at
least one encore, but the
enthusiastic and repeated response
of the audience encouraged
Lateiner to present three:
Chopin's passionate
"Fantasy-Impromptu,"
Mendelssohn's delicate "Scherzo
in E Minor," and the
Paganini-Lizst "Campanella," one
of the all-time show stoppers.
Awesome Technique
In all three pieces Lateiner
displayed his awesome technique
and taste.
The famous "Campanella" had the
entire audience out of their seats
for a final standing ovation.
