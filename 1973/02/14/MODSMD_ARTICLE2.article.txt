# Officers To Impound Stray Campus Dogs
## 
### JANET SANDERS 
Beginning next Monday, Santa
Clara County will enforce its leash law
for all dogs on campus. Any dog not
restrained by a leash under six feet in
length will be impounded by county
authorities.
Tomorrow and Friday, all
unleashed dogs will be tagged with a
warning statement. "At the end of the
day when the owner comes to pick up
his dog at the 'playpen' (Tresidder
Memorial Union), he will find a note
from the campus police chief attached
to his pet's collar," elaborated Don
Carlson, Associated Director of
University Relations.
After this warning period, the Santa
Clara Animal Control Department will
collect all stray dogs. A fee of ten
dollars will be charged to the owner
who bails his canine friend out of the
pound.
The University requested
enforcement of the leash law after
complaints from faculty, students and
staff had become increasingly
numerous. "The problem with dogs is
fairly obvious," said Carlson, and he
listed several problems that had been
outlined in complaints he received.
"Dogs tip over refuse cans in
residential areas and strew garbage
around, and they create a health
danger by freely romping around
eating areas, jumping on tables, and
eating food," Carlson said. "We have
also received reports of blind people
and a person on crutches knocked
down by dogs."
Carlson cited a law professor's
report that 400 formal complaints
about dogs, including five dozen
recorded incidents of dog bites, have
been filed with various University
offices in the past five years.
"The County has enforced the leash
law from time to time," said Marvin L.
Herrington, Director of Police
Services. "In the past, however.
County authorities have been harassed
by members of the community here
and have been reluctant to come
back."
Carlson believed that student
threats to county authorities will not
be a problem this time. "There has
been more student concern over the

canine problem lately," he said.
The current campaign to encourage
use of dog leashes is being supported
by the University President's office,
Dean of Student Affairs' office, the
ASSU, health and safety office and the
University Relations office. The
student senate passed a resolution to
support enforcement of the county
ordinance.
Posters and fact sheets with
information on the leash law and
details on how to retrieve impounded
pets are posted at Tresidder. "We hope
that there will be no dogs to pick up
when Monday comes," said
Herrington.

when Monday comes," said
Herrington.
Beginning next Monday, Santa
Clara County will enforce its leash law
for all dogs on campus. Any dog not
restrained by a leash under six feet in
length will be impounded by county
authorities.
Tomorrow and Friday, all
unleashed dogs will be tagged with a
warning statement. "At the end of the
day when the owner comes to pick up
his dog at the 'playpen' (Tresidder
Memorial Union), he will find a note
from the campus police chief attached
to his pet's collar," elaborated Don
Carlson, Associated Director of
University Relations.
After this warning period, the Santa
Clara Animal Control Department will
collect all stray dogs. A fee of ten
dollars will be charged to the owner
who bails his canine friend out of the
pound.
The University requested
enforcement of the leash law after
complaints from faculty, students and
staff had become increasingly
numerous. "The problem with dogs is
fairly obvious," said Carlson, and he
listed several problems that had been
outlined in complaints he received.
"Dogs tip over refuse cans in
residential areas and strew garbage
around, and they create a health
danger by freely romping around
eating areas, jumping on tables, and
eating food," Carlson said. "We have
also received reports of blind people
and a person on crutches knocked
down by dogs."
Carlson cited a law professor's
report that 400 formal complaints
about dogs, including five dozen
recorded incidents of dog bites, have
been filed with various University
offices in the past five years.
"The County has enforced the leash
law from time to time," said Marvin L.
Herrington, Director of Police
Services. "In the past, however.
County authorities have been harassed
by members of the community here
and have been reluctant to come
back."
Carlson believed that student
threats to county authorities will not
be a problem this time. "There has
been more student concern over the

canine problem lately," he said.
The current campaign to encourage
use of dog leashes is being supported
by the University President's office,
Dean of Student Affairs' office, the
ASSU, health and safety office and the
University Relations office. The
student senate passed a resolution to
support enforcement of the county
ordinance.
Posters and fact sheets with
information on the leash law and
details on how to retrieve impounded
pets are posted at Tresidder. "We hope
that there will be no dogs to pick up
when Monday comes," said
Herrington.
