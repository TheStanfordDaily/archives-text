## Skilled Technique, Familiar Ideas 
### ELLEN KENESHEA 
Ingmar Bergman's new film, "Cries and
Whispers" opens on an expanse of green lawn; a
white mansion, old but stately, dominates the
peaceful, clean grounds. Almost immediately the
camera plunges into the house, into a cluttered
brooding atmosphere inhabited by four women,
each waiting for a vision of that calm outside,
yearning for a state of grace.
Two sisters, Maria and Karin (Liv Ullmann and
Ingrid Thulin) attend a third sister, Agnes (Harriet
Andersson), who is dying. A servant, Anna (Kari
Sylvan) aids them. Through flashbacks, dreams and
confrontations between the women, Bergman
gradually strips off the masks and pretenses of each
character. "Cries and Whispers" fascinates not,
however, because of its revelations, but because of
its technique.
The film is steeped in the Bergman mythos of
women. Bergman glories in seeking and expressing
the dark mysteries of his women. Here, he creates
women who live with the passionate intensity of
characters in D.H. Lawrence's cosmic romanticism,
but without the accompanying heartiness or
curiosity. These women are locked into themselves
and locked into Bergman's imagination.
As Maria, Ullmann rules others through
sensuality, through touch. She is the coquette who
needs to be needed without having, in return, to
give anything of herself. She cannot cope with her
dying sister; Maria's touch is not to comfort the
dying, but to control the living.
Life Through Intellect
She spars relentlessly with Karin, who pursues
life through her intellect. Karin peers out from
behind her glasses and her high collared black
dresses, fearing to come too close to anyone, or to
any emotion.
Agnes watches her death with an acceptance
edged by the sorrow that she has already lost her
sisters; she longs for that grace which is human
friendship. Only Anna approaches her in her
agony—Anna the consoler, the earth mother,
ponderous, bovine, and alone of the four possessed
of faith. Yet all of the women are hard, fearful and
all too capable of destruction.

Clearly there is nothing new in "Cries and
Whispers." Bergman is ensorcelled by these
archetypal women from the myths of western man.
He is drawn in, fearful and loving, to review an old,
old passion.
Power in Actresses
The film's power lies not in the characters and
what they represent, but in the actresses and in their
workings and comminglings.
The women move in formal patterns through
compositions of red, black and white as Bergman
tries to give emotion tangible form in a ritualized
hysteria.
The camera constantly returns for close-ups,
probing the women's faces with a mercilessness that
would be brutal were it not for the love that
motivates the search. Photographer Swen Nykvist
has often worked with Bergman before, and is no
less than masterful here.
Compelling
The sheer intensity of the faces and the presence
of these women on the screen cannot be denied.
They carry the film, even make it compelling.
Sylvan is a newcomer to Bergman's group, and
the weakest of the actresses. Bergman has demanded
an incredible amount of energy and ability from the
women, and Sylvan has not quite given it. She is
too impassive in her gentleness, too stern in her
kindness.
Andersson as Agnes seems to draw pain from
every nerve as she slowly wastes away from cancer.
But the camera most often dwells upon Ullmann
and Thulin, and for good reason. They are a
matched pair, tearing at each other's minds,
bristling, backing off, and finally, in one exquisite
scene, coming together, their hands brushing each
other in fluttering, tender touches. Their men make
brief appearances, only to be dwarfed by the
women.
"Cries and Whispers" deals in ideas and subjects
long familiar, and it does not delve any more deeply
than many another work. Yet through its execution
alone it over-rides its faults and scattered cliches. To
9ee it is to understand the power of the film
medium.

gradually strips off the masks and pretenses of each
character. "Cries and Whispers" fascinates not,
however, because of its revelations, but because of
its technique.
The film is steeped in the Bergman mythos of
women. Bergman glories in seeking and expressing
the dark mysteries of his women. Here, he creates
women who live with the passionate intensity of
characters in D.H. Lawrence's cosmic romanticism,
but without the accompanying heartiness or
curiosity. These women are locked into themselves
and locked into Bergman's imagination.
As Maria, Ullmann rules others through
sensuality, through touch. She is the coquette who
needs to be needed without having, in return, to
give anything of herself. She cannot cope with her
dying sister; Maria's touch is not to comfort the
dying, but to control the living.
Life Through Intellect
She spars relentlessly with Karin, who pursues
life through her intellect. Karin peers out from
behind her glasses and her high collared black
dresses, fearing to come too close to anyone, or to
any emotion.
Agnes watches her death with an acceptance
edged by the sorrow that she has already lost her
sisters; she longs for that grace which is human
friendship. Only Anna approaches her in her
agony—Anna the consoler, the earth mother,
ponderous, bovine, and alone of the four possessed
of faith. Yet all of the women are hard, fearful and
all too capable of destruction.

Clearly there is nothing new in "Cries and
Whispers." Bergman is ensorcelled by these
archetypal women from the myths of western man.
He is drawn in, fearful and loving, to review an old,
old passion.
Power in Actresses
The film's power lies not in the characters and
what they represent, but in the actresses and in their
workings and comminglings.
The women move in formal patterns through
compositions of red, black and white as Bergman
tries to give emotion tangible form in a ritualized
hysteria.
The camera constantly returns for close-ups,
probing the women's faces with a mercilessness that
would be brutal were it not for the love that
motivates the search. Photographer Swen Nykvist
has often worked with Bergman before, and is no
less than masterful here.
Compelling
The sheer intensity of the faces and the presence
of these women on the screen cannot be denied.
They carry the film, even make it compelling.
Sylvan is a newcomer to Bergman's group, and
the weakest of the actresses. Bergman has demanded
an incredible amount of energy and ability from the
women, and Sylvan has not quite given it. She is
too impassive in her gentleness, too stern in her
kindness.
Andersson as Agnes seems to draw pain from
every nerve as she slowly wastes away from cancer.
But the camera most often dwells upon Ullmann
and Thulin, and for good reason. They are a
matched pair, tearing at each other's minds,
bristling, backing off, and finally, in one exquisite
scene, coming together, their hands brushing each
other in fluttering, tender touches. Their men make
brief appearances, only to be dwarfed by the
women.
"Cries and Whispers" deals in ideas and subjects
long familiar, and it does not delve any more deeply
than many another work. Yet through its execution
alone it over-rides its faults and scattered cliches. To
9ee it is to understand the power of the film
medium.
Ingmar Bergman's new film, "Cries and
Whispers" opens on an expanse of green lawn; a
white mansion, old but stately, dominates the
peaceful, clean grounds. Almost immediately the
camera plunges into the house, into a cluttered
brooding atmosphere inhabited by four women,
each waiting for a vision of that calm outside,
yearning for a state of grace.
Two sisters, Maria and Karin (Liv Ullmann and
Ingrid Thulin) attend a third sister, Agnes (Harriet
Andersson), who is dying. A servant, Anna (Kari
Sylvan) aids them. Through flashbacks, dreams and
confrontations between the women, Bergman
gradually strips off the masks and pretenses of each
character. "Cries and Whispers" fascinates not,
