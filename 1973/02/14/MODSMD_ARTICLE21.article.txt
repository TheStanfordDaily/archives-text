## Cards Cook Up Endless Turnovers 
### Don Tollefson 
It was a baker's dream. In less than 24
hours last weekend, Stanford's basketball team
tried admirably to replace Pepperidge Farms
as the nation's most famous maker of
turnovers. The Cardinal roundballers did fine
in the quantity department, but they just
couldn't match the quality of pepperidge's
blueberries, apples, and peaches.
For the last few years Stanford's basketball
program hasn't exactly set the world on fire.
In fact up until this year, very few sparks had
ever been seen in Maples Pavillion. Stanford's
players always seemed to be looking up at the
armpits of their usually taller and more
talented opponents. A few individual stars
made the scores respectable, but lack of
overall talent and height made losing a regular
result.
Finally Rich Kelley and Tim Patterson
arrived on the scene and broke the ancient
height barrier. Claude Terry was gone, but
with the ability to field a 6-9, 6-11, 7-0 front
line, most people thought his loss could be
overcome. At numerous times this year, the
Cards have displayed considerable talent, but
they seem intent on giving both the ball and
games away and with last weekend's double
loss, their record has fallen to 9-9.
An earlier loss to USC epitomized the
Cards' problems. The night before, Stanford
had performed well against UCLA, coming
closer than most of the other flies the Bruins

effortlessly swat. For most of the first half
against the beloved Trojans, Stanford seemed
intent upon brutally avenging the bitter
football loss of last fall.
But alas, the mighty turnover returns. The
Cards turned in a second half performance
that would've made most fourth grade coaches
cringe. Their passes seemed to be thrown from
slickly greased hands and frequent travelling
calls had fans looking for third feet on some
of the Card players. The Trojans made fools
out of the locals, but I think most intramural
teams could have also.
Then in a coaching maneuver as
understandable as Woody Hayes' Rose Bowl
strategy, Howie Dallmar gave his players the
next three days off. Gee, if they'd only
started tipping in the Trojan's missed shots, he
might have given them an entire month off.
He should have given them a few swift kicks
and made them practice fundamentals for a
few hundred hours. You all remember things
like passing, dribbling, and defense. A certain
team in Los Angeles has created a dynasty by
perfecting fundamentals, but it doesn't seem
to have rubbed off on the Cards.
Travelling In Oregon
After the Cards won three games in a row,
I was beginning to think a change might have
come. Ah, but a quick trip to Oregon
reaffirmed the power of the turnover. At least
the Cards seemed to have developed some new

turnovers. In Saturday's televised game against
Oregon State, some Stanford players looked
like they were playing hockey as they tried to
slide towards the basket. Unfortunately most
basketball officials still consider that to be a
travelling violation. But if the American
League can vote in the designated pinch hitter
rule, perhaps the basketball kings will allow
unlimited steps some day.
If Stanford could just play solid
fundamental basketball, they would probably
now be at least 12-6 and in line for a possible
NIT bid. As it is, they will have to scramble to
reach .500 for the season. And if they play
like they did in Oregon, they'll be lucky to
avoid an 9-16 record.
Ah, but turnovers are entertaining.
Watching a team adept at turnovers brings
back memories of the Harlem Globetrotters'
opponents. Maybe the Cards can develop
some new ones for this weekend's games. If
they work hard enough, maybe they can
perfect a move where a player dribbles the
ball off his knee and into the opponent's
basket. The hometown fans might not enjoy
it, but pity poor Oregon and Oregon
State—they've already seen Stanford commit
just about every turnover imaginable. Yes,
what this world needs is a new turnover. A
bigger, better, improved turnover. Hurry
Stanford, before Pepperidge Farms beats you
to it.

it, but pity poor Oregon and Oregon
State—they've already seen Stanford commit
just about every turnover imaginable. Yes,
what this world needs is a new turnover. A
bigger, better, improved turnover. Hurry
Stanford, before Pepperidge Farms beats you
to it.
It was a baker's dream. In less than 24
hours last weekend, Stanford's basketball team
tried admirably to replace Pepperidge Farms
as the nation's most famous maker of
turnovers. The Cardinal roundballers did fine
in the quantity department, but they just
couldn't match the quality of pepperidge's
blueberries, apples, and peaches.
For the last few years Stanford's basketball
program hasn't exactly set the world on fire.
In fact up until this year, very few sparks had
ever been seen in Maples Pavillion. Stanford's
players always seemed to be looking up at the
armpits of their usually taller and more
talented opponents. A few individual stars
made the scores respectable, but lack of
overall talent and height made losing a regular
result.
Finally Rich Kelley and Tim Patterson
arrived on the scene and broke the ancient
height barrier. Claude Terry was gone, but
with the ability to field a 6-9, 6-11, 7-0 front
line, most people thought his loss could be
overcome. At numerous times this year, the
Cards have displayed considerable talent, but
they seem intent on giving both the ball and
games away and with last weekend's double
loss, their record has fallen to 9-9.
An earlier loss to USC epitomized the
Cards' problems. The night before, Stanford
had performed well against UCLA, coming
closer than most of the other flies the Bruins

effortlessly swat. For most of the first half
against the beloved Trojans, Stanford seemed
intent upon brutally avenging the bitter
football loss of last fall.
But alas, the mighty turnover returns. The
Cards turned in a second half performance
that would've made most fourth grade coaches
cringe. Their passes seemed to be thrown from
slickly greased hands and frequent travelling
calls had fans looking for third feet on some
of the Card players. The Trojans made fools
out of the locals, but I think most intramural
teams could have also.
Then in a coaching maneuver as
understandable as Woody Hayes' Rose Bowl
strategy, Howie Dallmar gave his players the
next three days off. Gee, if they'd only
started tipping in the Trojan's missed shots, he
might have given them an entire month off.
He should have given them a few swift kicks
and made them practice fundamentals for a
few hundred hours. You all remember things
like passing, dribbling, and defense. A certain
team in Los Angeles has created a dynasty by
perfecting fundamentals, but it doesn't seem
to have rubbed off on the Cards.
Travelling In Oregon
After the Cards won three games in a row,
I was beginning to think a change might have
come. Ah, but a quick trip to Oregon
reaffirmed the power of the turnover. At least
the Cards seemed to have developed some new

turnovers. In Saturday's televised game against
Oregon State, some Stanford players looked
like they were playing hockey as they tried to
slide towards the basket. Unfortunately most
basketball officials still consider that to be a
travelling violation. But if the American
League can vote in the designated pinch hitter
rule, perhaps the basketball kings will allow
unlimited steps some day.
If Stanford could just play solid
fundamental basketball, they would probably
now be at least 12-6 and in line for a possible
NIT bid. As it is, they will have to scramble to
reach .500 for the season. And if they play
like they did in Oregon, they'll be lucky to
avoid an 9-16 record.
Ah, but turnovers are entertaining.
Watching a team adept at turnovers brings
back memories of the Harlem Globetrotters'
opponents. Maybe the Cards can develop
some new ones for this weekend's games. If
they work hard enough, maybe they can
perfect a move where a player dribbles the
ball off his knee and into the opponent's
basket. The hometown fans might not enjoy
it, but pity poor Oregon and Oregon
State—they've already seen Stanford commit
just about every turnover imaginable. Yes,
what this world needs is a new turnover. A
bigger, better, improved turnover. Hurry
