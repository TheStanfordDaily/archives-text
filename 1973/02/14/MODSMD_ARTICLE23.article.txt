# Horpel Outmaneuvers And Outthinks Opponents

### BRUCE KADDEN 
The wrestling team hasn't fared
so well this season, but one
wrestler Coach Joe DeMeo has
been able to count on all year is
team captain Chris Horpel.
Horpel, a junior architecture
major, has lost only one match
this season. "Chris is a threat to
beat anybody in the country on a
given day,"says DeMeo. "He's
definitely a contender in the
Pacific-Eight conference, and
should be nationally ranked."
Horpel believes that thinking
plays an important role in
wrestling. He considers himself
weak compared to most of his
opponents, so he tries to
"out-think" his counterpart in
everv match.

Wrestling is nothing new to the
Horpel family. Chris's father is a
wrestling coach in his spare time,
his older brother wrestled in high
school, and until this year, his
younger brother also wrestled.
Horpel said his father pushed
him more than he wanted when
he first began wrestling, between
the eighth and ninth grades at the
Costa Mesta AAU Club summer
program.
"I didn't like it at first because
I didn't do well. I lost every
match that summer, mostly by
pins, but my dad kept urging me
on."
As a freshman at Newport
Harbor High in Newport Beach,
Horpel began enjoying the sport.
Wrestling in the 115-pound class,

he was on junior varsity for most
of the season, but did wrestle
three varsity matches.
He didn't receive a varsity
letter, however, and this made
him "work five times as much as I
would have," the rest of the year
and through the summer.
During his sophomore year,
Horpel had a good first half of the
season in the 123-pound class, but
broke his leg playing touch
football. "I worked out during the
six weeks I wore a cast and, along
with my father, convinced the
doctor to remove the cast early,"
Horpel recalls.
He went on to win the league
championship, but didn't place in
the California Interscholastic
Federation (CIF) Championship
Meet, which included the best
high school wrestlers in Southern
California.
Wrestling in the 136-pound

class his junior year, Horpel had
what he called a "good season,"
placing second in the CIF.
His senior year was even better
as he finished first in the CIF. He
was named outstanding wrestler
of the tournament after pinning
all his opponents. During that
year he set a national record by
pinning 34 of 36 foes.
Horpel had a difficult time
deciding where to attend college.
He was "recruited somewhat" by
Stanford, and offered a partial
schoalrship. University of
Washington and UC Berkeley
recruited him, offering him full
scholarships, and he also applied
to Harvard and Princeton.
Wrestling for the varsity his
freshman year, Horpel finished
with a 13-8 record. He finished
third in the Pac-8 in the
150-pound class, and reached the
third round of the NCAA finals

before losing.
Last year he started out in the
150-pound class, and had a 17-2
record, but because DeMeo
thought he would have a better
chance in the Pac-8 meet, he
dropped to 142 pounds. He won
two more regular season matches,
but failed to place in the Pac-8
finals.
This past summer, he tried out
for the U.S. Olympic team in
Greco-Roman wrestling. This
differs from freestyle wrestling in
that only holds above the waist
are allowed. "I prefer
Greco-Roman because I basically
use upper-body holds and moves
in all matches," Chris commented.
In the qualifying meet held in
Anoka, Minnesota, Horpel
finished seventh. Concerning a
future Olympic bid, he said, "I'll
probably try again if I'm still
connected with wrestling."

opponent last night at Encina Gym. Horpel got the job done in 10 seconds, frustrating a Daily
photographer who was able to shoot only three pictures. Horpel's victory was his 16th in 17 matches this
year. The Cards lost to the Gators, however, 26-15, dropping Stanford's record to 4-7
