# Football Pregame Timing
## It's Just Like Clockwork 
### Jerry Coleman 
Flash! With the speed and clarity of an instant
replay, you find yourself once again in the Stanford
Stadium on a sultry autumn Saturday afternoon for
the spectacle of collegiate football.
Remember the great mix of colors: blue sky,
green turf, two squadrons of exercising athletes in
clashing uniforms, the bands, the cheerleaders, and
even the backdrop of the arriving crowd.
Some of you might have been busy getting a hot
dog or finding a seat; others were simply soaking in
the whole pregame football scene. But did any of
you ever stop to ask yourself how, week after week,
the show always started on time?
Did you ever wonder about the perfect
clockwork behind all the team warmups, the band
shows, the changing of numbers on the scoreboard
clock?
Pregame events rarely happen by chance. Rather,
they are regulated, with all the major actors—both
coaches, both band directors, scoreboard clock
operators—moving on pre-arranged cues.
Who is one of the major personalities behind it
all? Who is the unknown, unsung coordinator who
walks miles within the stadium each week,
consulting, cajoling, advising, timing, and
worrying? .. . Not an administrator, or an assistant
coach, or even a guest efficiency expert. He's Alec
Rooke, a Stanford senior from Rochester,
Minnesota, and four-year Bandsman.
Although he begins with fairly consistent time
guidelines, Rooke is specifically responsible for
determining when pregame team practice ends, and
how long each band can perform.
"My goal is to get every kickoff to start at 1:30,"
says Rooke. But the job is not all that easy: "you
ever try to move a 150 member band, all carrying
instruments, in a hurry?" Rooke asks.
Nightmares
Sometimes opposing bands run their shows too
long, or a timer will start the clock late, or a coach
have his team do a hundred extra pushups before
leaving the field. These are Rooke's nightmares.
Yet, despite all the obstacles in his way, he
manages with a combination of firmness and good
humor to keep things on schedule. His two year
record is almost perfect.
Almost. At this year's game with Washington

occurred a slip up that went unnoticed by nearly
everyone in the stadium but a handful of
technicians . .. and hundreds of radio listeners on
the Pacific Coast.
A combiantion of an eager Stanford Band
entrance on the field, an unusually short show by
the Incomparables, and a timer delay resulted in a
performance of the National Anthem three minutes
early.
Evidently, the Pacific Coast Radio Network,
hooked into KSFO for the game, has a pregame
procedure that locks all stations into a commercial,
then off the commercial and right onto the stadium
air. At that point the commentator makes time for a
few seconds until the Anthem starts and is
broadcast.
But that week, the network locked off the
commercial and right into the middle of the
Anthem. The commentator couldn't very well talk
over the Anthem, so all those listeners were treated
to the song's last eight bars.
Realizes Power
"I never knew about the radio timing," Rooke
says. "So I'm probably the only clown on record
who's ever done that. Afterwards I realized that I've
got more control in this job that I had thought."
Rooke may deal with minutes and seconds but
his liason responsibilities with visiting bands provide
him with certain benefits of a more personal nature.
For, once pregame is over (and the halftime shows
as well), Rooke has ample time to visit with the
opposing teams' dollies, bandsmen, and band
directors.
"It's really interesting working with some of
these characters," claims Rooke. "And the SC
dollies looked fine this year . .. couldn't dance but
sure looked fine," he adds.
The Stanford Band apparently thought Rooke
spent more time looking at visiting dollies than at
the scoreboard clock. At the season's end Band
Banquet, he was awarded the "Best Dolly Hustler"
trophy.
The trophy consisted of a coke bottle spray
painted gold and with Rooke's title monogrammed
in magic marker. A more appropriate trophy might
have been a watch with no hands ... or a transistor
radio.
