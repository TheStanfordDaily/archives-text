## 
### 
Last weekend the Stanford Ski Team ended its seven year
confinement to the lower ranges of the standings by elevating itself to
a second place finish against a field of 11 schools at the University of
Nevada Winter Carnival.
On its way to the second place finish, the team, captained by Tom
Headley and coached by Skip Stritter, Bill Gibson, and John Shott,
finished sixth in the jumping event and rallied to a decisive first in the
slalom. The women's team finished second in its slalom event.
The strong men's slalom team had four of its five members finish in
the top ten places. Dave Horth was Stanford's top finisher, coming in
third. He was followed by Gary Wright (fifth), Mike Iker (sixth) and
Steve Taylor (seventh). The top Stanford jumper was Dave Andrews
who finished eleventh with a jump of 88 feet. After Andrews came
Frank Johns (18th), Taylor (25th) and Mike Iker (26th).
The women's slalom saw Lyn Littlefield finish fifth, Kathy
Frankland finish sixth, Kathy Reynolds place seventh, and Terry
Tomsick twelfth.
The winning team at the meet was University of Nevada at Reno,
rated in the top ten in the nation in intercollegiate skiing, followed by
Stanford, Columbia College, College of the Siskyous, Sierra College,
Menlo College, California, U.C. Davis, Southern Oregon, and Feather
River College.
The rapidly improving Stanford team finished sixth in its only
other meet so far this season. Coaches Stritter, Gibson and Shott feel
confident the team will equal this week's performance at the Pacific
Coast Championships at Squaw Valley Feb. 23-25.
