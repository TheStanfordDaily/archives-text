Hanoi To Free 20 More POWs
SAIGON — Hanoi said it will release 20 more
American prisoners of war from North Vietnam in a
few days, and the four-party military peacekeeping
commission here was summoned into session today
to make the arrangements.
At the same time, Col. Bui Tin, chief spokesmen
for the North Vietnamese delegation to the
commission, said the second group of American
prisoners of war held in South Vietnam will be
released in 10 to 15 days, possibly near the same
site where 27 U.S. prisoners were freed Monday.
Tin said he had no details on the impending
release of the 20 prisoners in North Vietnam.
•Jerry VV. Friedheim, spokesman for the Defense
Department in Washington, said yesterday the
Pentagon had received the list of names of the 20
Americans to be freed in North Vietnam and their
families were being notified. Included on the list are
four Navy men and 16 from the Air Force.
The Pentagon indicated that North Vietnam's
action apparently is a goodwill gesture following a
four-day visit to Hanoi by U.S. presidential adviser
Henry A. Kissinger, who negotiated the peace
agreement under which all American prisoners of
war are to be freed by March 28.
Friedheim said the Pentagon was informed of the
release by North Vietnam through
"communications channels." He did not elaborate
but said the message apparently was connected with
Kissinger's postwar discussions with the Hanoi
leadership.
Kissinger arrived in Hong Kong earlier yesterday
for a two-day stop before continuing on to Peking
tomorrow for talks with Chinese leaders.
Kissinger had said he expected that all of the
American prisoners will be released in four
increments of roughly equal numbers in two-week
intervals. The peace agreement signed in Paris on
Jan. 27 states only that all prisoners are to be
released within 60 days, or by March 28, and makes
no specific time provisions. It says only that the
releases shall be contingent on the rate of American
troop withdrawals from South Vietnam, and shall
be no slower.
U.S. To Press MIA Search
SAN DIEGO — The United States will search
relentlessly for the 1328 missing U.S. servicemen in
Indochina, Maj. Gen. Daniel James said yesterday.
"We are going to leave no stone unturned to
account for these men," the assistant U.S. secretary
of defense in charge of war prisoner affairs told
newsmen here. The search will be conducted
through the Joint Casualty Resolution Center, based
in Thailand, in which the United States is a
participant.
Such searches are provided for in the terms of
the ceasefire agreement.
James said the International Red Cross has also
been invited by North Vietnam "to inspect the
prison camps in which our POWs were held."
The 20 men on a list made public yesterday to be
released next by the Communists complete the
repatriation of all those captured up to 1966, said
James. The men captured in 1967 will head the next
group of returnees, he said.
The searchers for missing men will look into
aircraft crashes and grave sites throughout
Indochina, he said, adding "we plan to continue

that until we have resolved as many of these cases as
we can."
Hijack Pack Announced
MIAMI BEACH — Secretary of State William Rogers
said last night an agreement with Cuba on curbing
hijacking would be signed in a "few days."
Rogers, who arrived here with Treasury Secretary
George P. Shultz to discuss foreign trade issues with
AFL-CIO leaders, refused to givt newsmen any
further details at a brief news conference.
Earlier, President Nixon indicated that a
hijacking agreement with Cuba was near and said
Rogers would give further details at a later date.
In Washington, the State Department said a note
received from the Havana government over the
weekend "made it clear only procedural details
remain to be worked out."
Department spokesman Charles W. Bray
expressed the hope that these details will be worked
out over the next days.
Cuba has been a favorite haven of terrorists who
seized control of planes in the United States and
forced pilots to fly there. Of late, however, there
has been an apparent hardening of the Cuban
attitude toward these hijackers.
Airport Guards Resume Friday
WASHINGTON - The Federal Aviation
Administration ordered airport managements
yesterday to post an armed guard at each boarding
point beginning February.
The notification followed failure of legal moves
to stave off the requirement.
The guards will replace the U.S. deputy marshals
and customs officers now employed to provide
assistance, as needed, to airline employees screening
boarding passengers and inspecting hand luggage.
The Airport Operators Council International
AOCI, which had won a court postponement of an
earlier FAA deadline, said it was polling airports to
find out the likely degree of compliance to the
order setting the new effective date.
"The situation is very confused," said J.J.
Corbett, AOCI vice president of federal affairs.
"Some airports already have complied even
though no regulation was in effect.
"Boston is okay because it will be using off-duty
state troopers at Logan International.
"Chicago couldn't spare any fully qualified
personnel so it is using police cadets who need five
more months of training.
"A lot of airports plan to use a combination of
local police and customs security officers."
Dallas Gunmen Surrender
DALLAS, Tex. — Two teen-age gunmen,
surrounded by nearly 100 police officers
throughout the night, surrendered yesterday
morning about an hour after releasing the last of 22
hostages they took more than eight hours earlier.
The ordeal began when the two, one of them an
escapee from a mental hospital, were trapped during
the attempted robbery of a bar in northeast Dallas.
They surrendered at 8:46 a.m. EST. peeping around
the door and then easing out of the bar.
They released the last six hostages at 7:25 a.m.
EST after a police detective told them: "I give you
my word we are not going to raid the place."
The two were arraigned before a municipal
magistrate who set bond at $50,000 each and sent

them to the city jail pending filing of formal
charges.
Late yesterday, a police department spokesman
said the two young gunmen were charged on one
count each of armed robbery in connection with the
recovery of several hundred dollars taken from the
bar and from customers.
Other charges, he emphasized, were pending.
The gunmen had demanded a car, a tankful of
gas and a plane waiting at Love Field to make their
getaway.
Before the surrender, authorities had said they
were waiting for the arrival of the father of one of
the boys, Milton Allen Frank 18, who was en route
from Las Vegas to talk to his son.
Ellsberg Authority Shown
LOS ANGELES — Daniel Ellsberg's attorney,
disputing charges that Ellsberg stole the Pentagon
Papers, showed yesterday that he not only had
"authorized possession" but also had control over
letting others see some of the top-secret papers.
In cross-examination of a Rand Corp. security
officer, attorney Leonard Boudin established that
Ellsberg's approval was needed for persons including
the president of Rand to see some of the
documents.
A Rand processing card introduced in evidence
by the defense showed a special requirement for
looking at one volume of the papers. It said,
"Ellsberg verbal approval required."
The defense attorneys also tried to show Rand
Corp. never had a contract with the Department of
Defense regarding the Pentagon Papers. Rather, they
claim, three officials leaving government deposited
the Pentagon study with Rand for storage.
Boudin entered in evidence a 1968 letter to Rand
from the then assistant secretary of defense for
international security affairs, Paul C. Warnke, which
told Rand how the Pentagon study was to be
guarded.
Warnke said distribution of the papers would be
controlled by himself and two other men involved
in creating the Pentagon Papers — Leslie H. Gelb,
who directed the project, and Morton H. Halperin,
then a deputy assistant secretary of defense for
international security affairs. Halperin was Gelb's
superior and is now a consultant to the
Ellsberg-Russo defense team.
Nixon To Speak At Noon
WASHINGTON — President Nixon asked yesterday
for network radio time to make a noon hour
broadcast today on natural resources and the
environment — the subject of the next in his series
of State of the Union messages.
Press secretary Ronald L. Ziegler, in making the
announcement, said the President has decided "to
give radio speeches from time to time" on the
messages he is sending to Capitol Hill as "part of his
effort to report to the people."
The speech will be broadcast live after the
conclusion of the noon news programs, Ziegler said.
Today's Weather
Rain continuing on and off today. Chance of
showers tonight then partly cloudy tomorrow. Lows
tonight in the upper 30s to 40s. Highs both days in
the 50s to low 60s. Chance of rain 80 percent today
and 40 percent tonight.
