# Aid Cuts May Force Students To Drop Out
## 
### 
BERKELEY (AP) — Many university
students may be forced to drop out of
school because of budget cuts
proposed by President Nixon,
University of California Chancellor
Albert H. Bowker said yesterday.
"I am afraid many undergraduates
and graduate students will decide
against continuing their education
rather than incurring thousands of
dollars in debts before the completion
of their studies," Bowker said in a
statement released at the Berkeley
campus.
In addition to cuts in student loan
and aid programs, Bowker said the
Berkeley campus alone will lose $3
million a year in federal assistance if
the proposed Nixon budget is
approved by Congress.
"Students are in danger of
becoming the unwilling victims of the
battle between the President and
Congress over federal support for
education," the chancellor said. "The
uncertainties about future federal

grants and loans, the reduction of
research opportunities and the rising
costs in education may force many to
consider ending their studies."
Bowker said Berkeley officials
believe "irreparable damage" will be
done by proposed cuts for the public
health and foreign language
departments.
