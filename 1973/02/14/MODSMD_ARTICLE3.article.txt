### Associated Press 
CLARK AIR FORCE BASE,
Philippines — The first two
ex-prisoners of war to reach the
United States arrived dramatically in
San Diego last night.
Officials here said most of the 141
other treed POWs will reach California
by the end of the week.
The plane carrying the first two
returning POWs developed flap trouble
as it prepared to land last night and
circled over Miramar Naval Air Station
near San Diego before finally landing
safely.
The Air Force Cl4l medical
evacuation transport bringing the two
from the Philippines touched down at
Miramar at 9:28 p.m. PST after
circling the field for about an hour.
20 Return Today
Official sources said about 20 more
prisoners will fly to the United States
this afternoon after completing their
processing and medical examinations.
The sources said the group was
scheduled to leave Clark at 1 a.m. PST
— on a Cl4l for Travis Air Force Base
about 40 miles north of San Francisco.
The 15'/2-hour trip will - include a
refueling stop at Hickam Air Force
Base in Hawaii. They are due to reach
Travis about 4 p.m. today.
It will be the first regular flight
home for the 143 POWs released in
Hanoi and South Vietnam on Monday.
The two men who left vesterdav were

rushed through processing because of
illnesses in their families.
Two More Groups
Another group of 20 was expected
to leave at 7 p.m. PST today and a
third group at 1 a.m. PST tomorrow.
One source said plans were for
about 20 men to be in the first group,
"but hopefully it will be more than
that. It all depends on the tests and
how fast we can pump these guys
out."
The two who reached San Diego
last night were Navy Cmdr. Brian D.
Woods of San Diego, and Air Force
Maj. Glendon W. Perkins of Orlando,
Fla.
Leukemia
A car waited on the airfield tu take
Woods to Coronado Hospital in the
suburban community of Coronado,
where his 70-year-old mother is
seriously ill with leukemia complicated
by heart and kidney disease.
After visiting with her, he was to be
taken to the U.S. Naval Hospital in
San Diego, one of the hospitals around
the country that will be giving tests
and treatment to returning POWs.
Perkins and his wife were to fly to
Duluth, Minn., and then go to Cross
Lake, Minn., where his mother is
reported critically ill.
Shackles
One of the 27 Americans freed
Monday by the Viet Cong reported he
spent much of his five years' c aptivity

in shackles and solitary confinement.
"I have spoken more since I was
freed yesterday than in all the five
years I was a prisoner," Michael Hugh
Kjome, a civilian from Decorah, lowa,
told staff at the hospital here.
A contract employee with the
Agency for International
Development, he was captured in
Saigon during the 1968 Tet offensive.
Beatings
A few other Americans reportedly
told of beatings and ill treatment, such
as salt rubbed on wounds by their
captors. Their comments were relayed
by military spokesmen and others at
the hospital. Tight security prevented
newsmen from talking directly with
the returned prisoneis.
Doctors reported a few ex-POWs
asked to remain here for plastic
surgery on wounds before going home.
The plastic surgery they will
undergo is for wounds that require
further repair.
"It's less cosmetic than practical,"
said a hospital staff member. "Some of
these men have bad scars on their arms
from being bound for a long time with
wire. In others their war wounds
healed badly."
President Nixon yesterday ordered
that all flags be raised full staff today
to honor returning prisoners of war
and all American casualties in
Vietnam.
