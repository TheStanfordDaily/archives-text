# Students Released From Jail
## 
### 
Two students here who were
arrested Monday for grand theft have
been released from jail on their own
recognizance pending arraignment on
Thursday, Mar. 1.
Stanford Public Safety Chief
Marvin L. Herrington and Capi. Frank
Benaderet, both reserve Santa Clara
County Sheriffs deputies, arrested
juniors Eric Braun Test and Lee
Christian Spieller. Test and Spieller
were about to drive away from the
University Stores Department on
Pampas Lane with about $400 in
merchandise allegedly requisitioned
illegally.
County Sheriff's Sgt. Jon Svilich
said yesterday that he and Benaderet
would go to the county district
attorney this morning "to discuss
grand theft, conspiracy and forgery"
complaints against Test and Spieller.
Svilich added that "the final
decision (on the complaints) will be up
to the District Attorney."
University Presidential aide Gerald
M. Halligan said yesterday that "I
want to double check some of the
facts" in the case. He added that "if
things turn up as I expect them to, I
will file charges" against Test and
Spieller for violation of the
University's Fundamental Standard.
The Fundamental Standard requires
students "to show both within and
without the University such respect
for order, morality, personal honor,
and the rights of others as is demanded
of good citizens."
Alleged violators of the
Fundamental Standard are tried before
the Campus Judicial Panel (CJP),
which is composed of three students,
three faculty members and a chairman
from the law school. An outside
hearing officer determines the facts in
each case and then turns over his
findings to the CJP.
