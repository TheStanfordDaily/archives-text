# President To Request Authority To Increase Import Tariff Rates
## 
### Associated Press 
WASHINGTON — President Nixon
said yesterday he will ask Congress for
authority to increase tariffs if
necessary to follow up devaluation of
the dollar.
He told Secretary of the Treasury
George P. Shultz that "devaluation of
the dollar is at best only a temporary
solution of the problem."
"That is why trade legislation must
follow," Nixon said. "Only by getting
trade legislation and changing or
reducing the huge deficit can the huge

pressure on the dollar be taken off."
Signaling a tougher stance, Nixon
said that as part of an effort "to get a
fair deal and a fair shake for American
products abroad," he would ask
Congress "for the right for our
negotiators to go up or down" with
tariffs in trade talks with other
countries.
"We have gone into too many
negotiations abroad in which all we
have done is to negotiate down
whereas others have negotiated up,"
the President said.
European governments praised the
United States yesterday for swiftly
and decisively bringing to an end the
crisis of confidence in the dollar.
The surprise American decision to
devalue the dollar for the second time
in 14 months, and this time by an
unexpectedly large 10 percent, was
seen in Europe as almost certain to
stop the unprecedented selling wave of
dollars on world money markets.
But fears were voiced at the same
time that what has largely been a
dollar crisis may now turn to
speculation against other currencies
and a fresh round of monetary turmoil
sooner cr later.

Adding to the confusion was the
fact that five financially important
countries are now allowing their
currencies to float outside fixed
exchange rates.
Italy was the latest to join this
group yesterday. The others are
Britain, Canada, Switzerland and
Japan.
Furthermore all the new exchange
rates — in effect, changes in the price
of money — were bound to affect
world trade by revising export prices.
Reporters who were allowed to
overhear a portion of Nixon's
conversation with Shultz heard the
President say "other nations must get
away from their discriminatory
[tariff] policies and we must be in a
position to bargain harder."
Nixon singled out Japan and
Europe when he talked of threats to
U.S. businesses, saying:
"The United States being the best
market in the world — and this is not
criticism of our Japanese and
European friends — they are loading it
into this market and they can drive
U.S. businesses out of
existence .. . and lose Americans their
jobs."

The President gave no further
specifics on the legislation and his
aides said they did not know when it
would be sent to Congress.
Meanwhile, the State Department
said the other major trading nations of
the world have been too slow in
eliminating the trading and monetary
surpluses that have thrown the
American international economic
position out of equilibrium.
Department spokesman Charles W.
Bray said, "the time has come for
action across wide and complementary
fronts" to solve the international
economic problems.
Bray's statement came as State
Department officials warned these
trading powers, particularly Japan and
the European Common Market, that
they must work quickly to restore
balances or face severe reaction by the
United States in the form of U.S.
restrictions.
Bray said the American
announcement is "designed to move us
further along the path" toward a
balanced system of monetary reform
and a more equitable world trading
system.

President say "other nations must get
away from their discriminatory
[tariff] policies and we must be in a
position to bargain harder."
Nixon singled out Japan and
Europe when he talked of threats to
U.S. businesses, saying:
"The United States being the best
market in the world — and this is not
criticism of our Japanese and
European friends — they are loading it
into this market and they can drive
U.S. businesses out of
existence .. . and lose Americans their
jobs."

The President gave no further
specifics on the legislation and his
aides said they did not know when it
would be sent to Congress.
Meanwhile, the State Department
said the other major trading nations of
the world have been too slow in
eliminating the trading and monetary
surpluses that have thrown the
American international economic
position out of equilibrium.
Department spokesman Charles W.
Bray said, "the time has come for
action across wide and complementary
fronts" to solve the international
economic problems.
Bray's statement came as State
Department officials warned these
trading powers, particularly Japan and
the European Common Market, that
they must work quickly to restore
balances or face severe reaction by the
United States in the form of U.S.
restrictions.
Bray said the American
announcement is "designed to move us
further along the path" toward a
balanced system of monetary reform
and a more equitable world trading
system.
WASHINGTON — President Nixon
said yesterday he will ask Congress for
authority to increase tariffs if
necessary to follow up devaluation of
the dollar.
He told Secretary of the Treasury
George P. Shultz that "devaluation of
the dollar is at best only a temporary
solution of the problem."
"That is why trade legislation must
follow," Nixon said. "Only by getting
trade legislation and changing or
reducing the huge deficit can the huge

pressure on the dollar be taken off."
Signaling a tougher stance, Nixon
said that as part of an effort "to get a
fair deal and a fair shake for American
products abroad," he would ask
Congress "for the right for our
negotiators to go up or down" with
tariffs in trade talks with other
countries.
"We have gone into too many
negotiations abroad in which all we
have done is to negotiate down
whereas others have negotiated up,"
the President said.
European governments praised the
United States yesterday for swiftly
and decisively bringing to an end the
crisis of confidence in the dollar.
The surprise American decision to
devalue the dollar for the second time
in 14 months, and this time by an
unexpectedly large 10 percent, was
seen in Europe as almost certain to
stop the unprecedented selling wave of
dollars on world money markets.
But fears were voiced at the same
time that what has largely been a
dollar crisis may now turn to
speculation against other currencies
and a fresh round of monetary turmoil
sooner cr later.

Adding to the confusion was the
fact that five financially important
countries are now allowing their
currencies to float outside fixed
exchange rates.
Italy was the latest to join this
group yesterday. The others are
Britain, Canada, Switzerland and
Japan.
Furthermore all the new exchange
rates — in effect, changes in the price
of money — were bound to affect
world trade by revising export prices.
Reporters who were allowed to
overhear a portion of Nixon's
conversation with Shultz heard the
President say "other nations must get
away from their discriminatory
[tariff] policies and we must be in a
position to bargain harder."
