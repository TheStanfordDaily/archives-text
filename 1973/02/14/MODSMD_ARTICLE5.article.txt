# Cancer Research, Phone System
## Trustees Approve New Buildings 
### ROBERT BACON 
University Trustees yesterday approved plans for two
new buildings — one for cancer research and the other to
house a new telephone system.
Medical Center officials said the cancer research facility
might become the first of a cluster of modular research
structures near the Medical Center.
The $733,000 building will house the Lymphoma
Virology Program of the Radiology Department. It will be
located on an eight-acre site near Governor's Lane west of
(uphill from) the Medical School parking lots and the
psychiatry clinic building.
It will be of modular design, adaptable to classroom or
laboratory use, and able to be remodeled to accommodate
new research programs.
Flexibility Lacking
Medical Center officials pointed out the lack of
flexibility in the present building. "It's all concrete," one
said.
University officials envision that other, similar
buildings will be built adjoining the one announced
yesterday, to provide easily-adaptable space for short-term
research projects.
They stressed, however, that "no other immediate
needs have been identified. There are no plans for another
building there now. Later, perhaps."
Telephone Exchange
The Trustees also authorized construction of a new
telephone exchange building between the Police-Fire
Station and the Plant Services offices on Bonair Siding.
The building will enable the University to switch to a
Centrex direct-dialing telephone system early in 1974. It
will contain automated facilities to replace the main
University, Hansen Labs, Stanford Electronics
Laboratories, and Medical Center switchboards.
The new structure will cost about $718,000. The
automated systems will reduce the University's $2 million
annual telephone bill by more than $140,000, according
to Plant Services officials.
Construction of the JO,OOO square foot building will
begin at once.
Dial Directly
In a Centrex system, outside callers will directly dial
University extensions without having their calls handled

by an operator. Calls from University telephones will be
made in the same way as before.
Information and operator assistance services will not be
cut.
The present switchboard is operating at peak capacity.
University officials had previously considered short-term
expansion of the system capacity by using the "491"
equipment, which served residence hall telephones from
1970-72. But they have decided instead to opt for new
permanent facilities.
Panama Street
The present switchboard is located across Panama St.
from the Old Union. The "491" apparatus is in a small
building between the Women's Gymnasium and the
Storke Publications building.
The latter site is being considered for a major building
project, possibly an engineering structure. Hcnce officials
chose not to commit the site to telephone facilities.
Lymphoma
The lymphoma program in the new medical building,
under the direction of Radiology Prof. Henry S. Kaplan,
will investigate cancers of the lymphatic system, including
Hodgkin's disease. The work will emphasize the role of
viruses in causing such cancers. The new laboratory will
devise methods for studying the cells of cancer patients.
The modular cancer research structure will be similar in
appearance to the psychiatric clinic building adjoining the
Medical School.
Completion of the 10,000 square foot building is
forecast for March 1974. The National Cancer Institute
will provide most of the funds for the building and its
research equipment.
The Trustees also approved the academic program to
be housed in the Sherman Fairchild Center tor
Neurosciences at the Medical Center. Plans for the
neurosciences center, to be funded by a $7.5 million gift
from the Fairchild Foundation, were announced last
month.
The Fairchild Center will house the departments of
anatomy and physiology, and will also provide facilities
for interdisciplinary studies of the central nervous system,
involving departments both within and outside the
Medical School, according to Medical School Dean
Clayton Rich.

DEBT OF GRATITUDE — Law student Mick Goldstein, who has been arrested
in Arizona and indicted by a Grand Jury on four felony counts in connection
with the Chino Prison escape case, spoke at a meeting held last night in Serra
lounge to organize fund-raising efforts for his defense. Most of the 12 people at
the meeting were connected with the April 21 Defense Collective, an effort
Goldstein helped to coordinate last year. The group plans a pot luck fund-raising
dinner for March 2, and hopes to solicit support for Goldstein from those he
helned through the collective.
