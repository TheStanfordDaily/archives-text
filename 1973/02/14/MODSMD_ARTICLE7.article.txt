# Research And Grocery Bills
## Thesis Topics, DoD And Otherwise 
### 
Stan Glantz

This quarter and next quarter
many engineering and science
graduate students will select
advisors and thesis research areas.
In doing so, they will also be
selecting the agency that will
support their research and grocery
bills.
Last year, under the auspices
of SWOPSI, I worked with a
group of (mostly engineering
graduates) students to study DoD
research at Stanford.
The two-volume report, DoD
Sponsored Research at Stanford,
contains descriptions of all the
DoD projects at Stanford as of
two years ago from both the
investigators' and the DoD's point
of view, and an analysis of how
n A * •» *■ » A m

this research affects the
University. Most of these
contracts are still active today.
The report is available at
SWOPSI, and in the Main, Meyer,
Aero-Astro, and possibly other
libraries.
We found that the DoD selects
which proposals to fund for
university research and
development on the basis of their
projected military needs in
specific areas very intelligently.
Furthermore, we found that doing
DoD supported thesis research
greatly increases the probability
that a student will eventually
work for the military or one of its
contractors (or be supported by
them in another university).

Should you find this situation
inconsistent with your personal
values and ambitions, I urge you
to consider these facts when
selecting an advisor and thesis
topic.
Wide Range
Many DoD-supported faculty
members point out that their
work could be applied to a wide
range of problems in addition to
military ones. This statement is,
to varying degrees, true. But, the
important questions are: Where is
it most likely to be used? Who has
a compelling enough need in this
area to spend money and hire
people to fulfill it? Consider these
statements by DoD research
managers (included in full in the

SWOPSI report):
(1) The Department of Defense
makes a very thorough effort to
insure funding only research
projects directly relevant to the
military's technological needs.
Not only is there direct pressure
from the Congress to get the best
possible return on every dollar
spent, there is a sufficiently large
number of research proposals
received so that the funding
agencies can afford to choose only
those most nearly matching their
goals. The ratio of proposals
received to those accepted is
anywhere from four-to-one to
ten-to-one, varying from one
research agency to another.
(2) The DoD is not simply

accepting scientific and
technological products coming
from a random pattern of
independent research activities in
the universities. Rather DoD
interest in some particular area
can stimulate growth and
development planned to fill
specific short-term and/or general
long-term technological gaps in
the military's capability. Thus,
given the large amount of funds
involved, and the large percentage
of all engineering research these
funds account for, the DoD plays
a powerful role in shaping the
profile of engineering research at
Stanford and many other
universities. This effect can be
either quantitative or qualitative.
In the absence of DoD interest,
laser physics would not enjoy the
level of support it now receives at
Stanford; funding by another
agency, such as the National
Science Foundation, would
probably be allocated to different
types of projects. Theoretical
statistics would not have
developed in the same areas it has
over the past decade.
Statements Confirmed
Our examination of all the
DoD contracts at Stanford, one at
a time, confirmed these
statements.
In today's tight market
employers can generally find
someone trained to do precisely
what they want done.
I urge you to consider your
personal values and ambitions; if
you wish to serve the civilian,
rather than military, sector in
your future research, you can
avoid many later problems by
selecting an advisor and thesis
topic (and supporting agency)
that deals with civilian problems.

This quarter and next quarter
many engineering and science
graduate students will select
advisors and thesis research areas.
In doing so, they will also be
selecting the agency that will
support their research and grocery
bills.
Last year, under the auspices
of SWOPSI, I worked with a
group of (mostly engineering
graduates) students to study DoD
research at Stanford.
The two-volume report, DoD
Sponsored Research at Stanford,
contains descriptions of all the
DoD projects at Stanford as of
two years ago from both the
investigators' and the DoD's point
of view, and an analysis of how
n A * •» *■ » A m

this research affects the
University. Most of these
contracts are still active today.
The report is available at
SWOPSI, and in the Main, Meyer,
Aero-Astro, and possibly other
libraries.
We found that the DoD selects
which proposals to fund for
university research and
development on the basis of their
projected military needs in
specific areas very intelligently.
Furthermore, we found that doing
DoD supported thesis research
greatly increases the probability
that a student will eventually
work for the military or one of its
contractors (or be supported by
them in another university).

Should you find this situation
inconsistent with your personal
values and ambitions, I urge you
to consider these facts when
selecting an advisor and thesis
topic.
Wide Range
Many DoD-supported faculty
members point out that their
work could be applied to a wide
range of problems in addition to
military ones. This statement is,
to varying degrees, true. But, the
important questions are: Where is
it most likely to be used? Who has
a compelling enough need in this
area to spend money and hire
people to fulfill it? Consider these
statements by DoD research
managers (included in full in the

SWOPSI report):
(1) The Department of Defense
makes a very thorough effort to
insure funding only research
projects directly relevant to the
military's technological needs.
Not only is there direct pressure
from the Congress to get the best
possible return on every dollar
spent, there is a sufficiently large
number of research proposals
received so that the funding
agencies can afford to choose only
those most nearly matching their
goals. The ratio of proposals
received to those accepted is
anywhere from four-to-one to
ten-to-one, varying from one
research agency to another.
(2) The DoD is not simply

accepting scientific and
technological products coming
from a random pattern of
independent research activities in
the universities. Rather DoD
interest in some particular area
can stimulate growth and
development planned to fill
specific short-term and/or general
long-term technological gaps in
the military's capability. Thus,
given the large amount of funds
involved, and the large percentage
of all engineering research these
funds account for, the DoD plays
a powerful role in shaping the
profile of engineering research at
Stanford and many other
universities. This effect can be
either quantitative or qualitative.
In the absence of DoD interest,
laser physics would not enjoy the
level of support it now receives at
Stanford; funding by another
agency, such as the National
Science Foundation, would
probably be allocated to different
types of projects. Theoretical
statistics would not have
developed in the same areas it has
over the past decade.
Statements Confirmed
Our examination of all the
DoD contracts at Stanford, one at
a time, confirmed these
statements.
In today's tight market
employers can generally find
someone trained to do precisely
what they want done.
I urge you to consider your
personal values and ambitions; if
you wish to serve the civilian,
rather than military, sector in
your future research, you can
avoid many later problems by
selecting an advisor and thesis
topic (and supporting agency)
that deals with civilian problems.
