# Sickle-Cell Anemia
## 'Attack Policy, Not Research' 
### 
:Ned Groth

The column by Cedric X on
science and sickle-cell research
(Daily, Feb. 8) voiced a legitimate
concern over the potential
political uses of such research, a
concern which undoubtedly
deserves more attention from
both blacks and whites than it
has yet received. However, I feel
Dr. X was unduly harsh in his
indictment of government
research in this field. Would he
condemn such studies if they were
planned and conducted entirely
by blacks?
Research, in and of itself,
contains no policy judgements.
The gathering of data on the
frequency and severity of
sickle-cell anemia, and the
development of programs for the
simple detection of the condition,
do have positive social value.
Clearly, when it is known that
children may be born with a
genetic "defect," whether it is
sickle-cell, hemophilia,
color-blindness, or any
other condition which is genetic in
origin and the occurrence of
which can be accurately
predicted, the decision on
whether to marry and whether to
have children is one which must
be made by the individuals
involved. People faced with such a
choice need to have ail the facts,
free from propaganda, which can
be made available; and if research
will help make those facts
available, the research is valuable.
Not Enough
But facts aren't enough.
Prospective parents must make
their own value judgements as to
how serious the potential
"defect" is, and whether they are
willing to accept such a condition
in their offspring. This is a
decision which cannot be made
for the community as a whole, not
by Cedric X, not by me, and most
assuredly not by the government.
Whatever interest the government

may legitimately have in
protecting the health of citizens,
it does not extend into the realm
of control over procreation—
especially when, as Dr. X points
out, the government is white and
the potential regulated parties are
black.
The government may, however,
be legitimately involved in the
pursuit and distribution of
information which will help
people make an intelligent choice.
It seems fairly clear to me that
many (if not most) black people
want such information. (My
personal impression of Bobby
Seale and the other black
community leaders who are
supporting sickle-cell programs is
not that they are "A lot of
ignorant, money-hustling black
people," as Professor X has
characterized them.) And, when it
comes to digging up facts,
$5,000,000 won't buy a hell of a
lot of research, even it is 100
times as much as was being spent
in 1968.
Still, there was a very chilling
possibility raised by Dr. X's
column. There may well be
people —even so-called
"scientists"—with misguided ideas
of eugenics, who would raise a
falsely exaggerated specter of
sickle-cell "disease" in a
scare-propaganda effort to try to
persuade blacks not to reproduce.
There might even be some who
might advocate the passage of
laws to restrict the breeding of
"genetically disadvantaged"
blacks.
Indeed, my first reaction to Dr.
X's column was to diagnose his
condition as a mild case of
paranoia brought on by
overexposure to William
Shockley. Upon reflection,
however, I realized that the appeal
that the "It's for their own good"
argument holds for many who
can't or won't admit to

underlying racist motivations calls
for serious consideration of
Professor X's warning, improbable
as it sounds.
But the real potential for
danger in this area lies not in
research, but in policy. If I were
Dr. X, I'd go over the National
Sickle-Cell Anemia Control Act
with a microscope, looking for
even the vaguest hint of
potentially coercive "incentives"
to limit births along racial lines.
Legislation must be carefully
watched, just in case the
government should take it into its
head to go beyond educating.
Attacks on research on
sickle-cell anemia are aimed at the
wrong target. Research is a
two-edged sword; it can be used
to fight repressive legislation, just
as easily as it might be used by
some future Shockley in an
attempt to justify such measures.
In fact, if the severity and
occurrence of the condition are
anything like what Dr. X has
described, possession of complete
facts on the subject by the public
should make it virtually
impossible for the sort of scare
campaign Dr. X warns of to
succeed. The slight possibility that
research might produce biased
results designed to support
genocidal policies can be averted
if blacks maintain an active
involvement in the conduct and
interpretation of such studies.
Opposition Misdirected
In short, opposition to the
gathering of additonal facts on the
problem through research is
misdirected, and potentially
counter-productive. If a battle
over racially-oriented "eugenics"
comes, it will take place in the
political arena, where blacks and
their allies will need all the
scientific facts they can muster, as
wel! as political skill and strength.
Meanwhile, the possibility that
such facts may persuade some

blacks not to risk having
children—a choice they can make
of their own rational free will, not
because they are "duped" by
white racist propaganda—is a
possibility that Professor X should
accept. Tests that will enable
people to find out whether they
carry the sickle-cell gene should
be supported.
The assumption that anything
which reduces black birth rates is
in the long-run detrimental to the
black community is highly
debatable at best, and cannot
justify opposition to sickle-cell
research—especially when the
actual impact of such research on
black birth patterns has not to my
knowledge yet been
demonstrated.

$5,000,000 won't buy a hell of a
lot of research, even it is 100
times as much as was being spent
in 1968.
Still, there was a very chilling
possibility raised by Dr. X's
column. There may well be
people —even so-called
"scientists"—with misguided ideas
of eugenics, who would raise a
falsely exaggerated specter of
sickle-cell "disease" in a
scare-propaganda effort to try to
persuade blacks not to reproduce.
There might even be some who
might advocate the passage of
laws to restrict the breeding of
"genetically disadvantaged"
blacks.
Indeed, my first reaction to Dr.
X's column was to diagnose his
condition as a mild case of
paranoia brought on by
overexposure to William
Shockley. Upon reflection,
however, I realized that the appeal
that the "It's for their own good"
argument holds for many who
can't or won't admit to

underlying racist motivations calls
for serious consideration of
Professor X's warning, improbable
as it sounds.
But the real potential for
danger in this area lies not in
research, but in policy. If I were
Dr. X, I'd go over the National
Sickle-Cell Anemia Control Act
with a microscope, looking for
even the vaguest hint of
potentially coercive "incentives"
to limit births along racial lines.
Legislation must be carefully
watched, just in case the
government should take it into its
head to go beyond educating.
Attacks on research on
sickle-cell anemia are aimed at the
wrong target. Research is a
two-edged sword; it can be used
to fight repressive legislation, just
as easily as it might be used by
some future Shockley in an
attempt to justify such measures.
In fact, if the severity and
occurrence of the condition are
anything like what Dr. X has
described, possession of complete
facts on the subject by the public
should make it virtually
impossible for the sort of scare
campaign Dr. X warns of to
succeed. The slight possibility that
research might produce biased
results designed to support
genocidal policies can be averted
if blacks maintain an active
involvement in the conduct and
interpretation of such studies.
Opposition Misdirected
In short, opposition to the
gathering of additonal facts on the
problem through research is
misdirected, and potentially
counter-productive. If a battle
over racially-oriented "eugenics"
comes, it will take place in the
political arena, where blacks and
their allies will need all the
scientific facts they can muster, as
wel! as political skill and strength.
Meanwhile, the possibility that
such facts may persuade some

blacks not to risk having
children—a choice they can make
of their own rational free will, not
because they are "duped" by
white racist propaganda—is a
possibility that Professor X should
accept. Tests that will enable
people to find out whether they
carry the sickle-cell gene should
be supported.
The assumption that anything
which reduces black birth rates is
in the long-run detrimental to the
black community is highly
debatable at best, and cannot
justify opposition to sickle-cell
research—especially when the
actual impact of such research on
black birth patterns has not to my
knowledge yet been
demonstrated.

The column by Cedric X on
science and sickle-cell research
(Daily, Feb. 8) voiced a legitimate
concern over the potential
political uses of such research, a
concern which undoubtedly
deserves more attention from
both blacks and whites than it
has yet received. However, I feel
Dr. X was unduly harsh in his
indictment of government
research in this field. Would he
condemn such studies if they were
planned and conducted entirely
by blacks?
Research, in and of itself,
contains no policy judgements.
The gathering of data on the
frequency and severity of
sickle-cell anemia, and the
development of programs for the
simple detection of the condition,
do have positive social value.
Clearly, when it is known that
children may be born with a
genetic "defect," whether it is
sickle-cell, hemophilia,
color-blindness, or any
other condition which is genetic in
origin and the occurrence of
which can be accurately
predicted, the decision on
whether to marry and whether to
have children is one which must
be made by the individuals
involved. People faced with such a
choice need to have ail the facts,
free from propaganda, which can
be made available; and if research
will help make those facts
available, the research is valuable.
Not Enough
But facts aren't enough.
Prospective parents must make
their own value judgements as to
how serious the potential
"defect" is, and whether they are
willing to accept such a condition
in their offspring. This is a
decision which cannot be made
for the community as a whole, not
by Cedric X, not by me, and most
assuredly not by the government.
Whatever interest the government

may legitimately have in
protecting the health of citizens,
it does not extend into the realm
of control over procreation—
especially when, as Dr. X points
out, the government is white and
the potential regulated parties are
black.
The government may, however,
be legitimately involved in the
pursuit and distribution of
information which will help
people make an intelligent choice.
It seems fairly clear to me that
many (if not most) black people
want such information. (My
personal impression of Bobby
Seale and the other black
community leaders who are
supporting sickle-cell programs is
not that they are "A lot of
ignorant, money-hustling black
people," as Professor X has
characterized them.) And, when it

comes, it will take place in the
political arena, where blacks and
their allies will need all the
scientific facts they can muster, as
wel! as political skill and strength.
Meanwhile, the possibility that
such facts may persuade some

blacks not to risk having
children—a choice they can make
of their own rational free will, not
because they are "duped" by
white racist propaganda—is a
possibility that Professor X should
accept. Tests that will enable
people to find out whether they
carry the sickle-cell gene should
be supported.
The assumption that anything
which reduces black birth rates is
in the long-run detrimental to the
black community is highly
debatable at best, and cannot
justify opposition to sickle-cell
research—especially when the
actual impact of such research on
black birth patterns has not to my
knowledge yet been
demonstrated.

The column by Cedric X on
science and sickle-cell research
(Daily, Feb. 8) voiced a legitimate
concern over the potential
political uses of such research, a
concern which undoubtedly
deserves more attention from
both blacks and whites than it
has yet received. However, I feel
Dr. X was unduly harsh in his
indictment of government
research in this field. Would he
condemn such studies if they were
planned and conducted entirely
by blacks?
Research, in and of itself,
contains no policy judgements.
The gathering of data on the
frequency and severity of
sickle-cell anemia, and the
development of programs for the
simple detection of the condition,
do have positive social value.
Clearly, when it is known that
children may be born with a
genetic "defect," whether it is
sickle-cell, hemophilia,
color-blindness, or any
other condition which is genetic in
origin and the occurrence of
which can be accurately
predicted, the decision on
whether to marry and whether to
have children is one which must
be made by the individuals
involved. People faced with such a
choice need to have ail the facts,
free from propaganda, which can
be made available; and if research
will help make those facts
available, the research is valuable.
Not Enough
But facts aren't enough.
Prospective parents must make
their own value judgements as to
how serious the potential
"defect" is, and whether they are
willing to accept such a condition
in their offspring. This is a
decision which cannot be made
for the community as a whole, not
by Cedric X, not by me, and most
assuredly not by the government.
Whatever interest the government

may legitimately have in
protecting the health of citizens,
it does not extend into the realm
of control over procreation—
especially when, as Dr. X points
out, the government is white and
the potential regulated parties are
black.
The government may, however,
be legitimately involved in the
pursuit and distribution of
information which will help
people make an intelligent choice.
It seems fairly clear to me that
many (if not most) black people
want such information. (My
personal impression of Bobby
Seale and the other black
community leaders who are
supporting sickle-cell programs is
not that they are "A lot of
ignorant, money-hustling black
people," as Professor X has
characterized them.) And, when it
comes to digging up facts,
$5,000,000 won't buy a hell of a
lot of research, even it is 100
times as much as was being spent
in 1968.
Still, there was a very chilling
possibility raised by Dr. X's
column. There may well be
people —even so-called
"scientists"—with misguided ideas
of eugenics, who would raise a
falsely exaggerated specter of
sickle-cell "disease" in a
scare-propaganda effort to try to
persuade blacks not to reproduce.
There might even be some who
might advocate the passage of
laws to restrict the breeding of
"genetically disadvantaged"
blacks.
Indeed, my first reaction to Dr.
X's column was to diagnose his
condition as a mild case of
paranoia brought on by
overexposure to William
Shockley. Upon reflection,
however, I realized that the appeal
that the "It's for their own good"
argument holds for many who
can't or won't admit to

underlying racist motivations calls
for serious consideration of
Professor X's warning, improbable
as it sounds.
But the real potential for
danger in this area lies not in
research, but in policy. If I were
Dr. X, I'd go over the National
Sickle-Cell Anemia Control Act
with a microscope, looking for
even the vaguest hint of
potentially coercive "incentives"
to limit births along racial lines.
Legislation must be carefully
watched, just in case the
government should take it into its
head to go beyond educating.
Attacks on research on
sickle-cell anemia are aimed at the
wrong target. Research is a
two-edged sword; it can be used
to fight repressive legislation, just
as easily as it might be used by
some future Shockley in an
attempt to justify such measures.
In fact, if the severity and
occurrence of the condition are
anything like what Dr. X has
described, possession of complete
facts on the subject by the public
should make it virtually
impossible for the sort of scare
campaign Dr. X warns of to
succeed. The slight possibility that
research might produce biased
results designed to support
genocidal policies can be averted
if blacks maintain an active
involvement in the conduct and
interpretation of such studies.
Opposition Misdirected
In short, opposition to the
gathering of additonal facts on the
problem through research is
misdirected, and potentially
counter-productive. If a battle

political arena, where blacks and
