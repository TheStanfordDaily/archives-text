# Panel Will Study Plan To Save Vienna Campus
## 
### DAN BRENNER 
A proposal to salvage the
Stanford-in-Austria Vienna campus
will be submitted to the Committee on
Foreign Study Programs today, the
Daily has learned. The proposal,
already approved by the
Subcommittee on Austria of the
Overseas Campuses program, is
designed to prevent the shut-down of
the metropolitan facility scheduled for
September.
German Prof. Walter Lohnes, the
Subcommittee member who composed
the proposal, said that the plan
preserves the campus at its present
location, but cuts occupancy from two
floors to one, leaving housing space for
30 students. Participants in the
program would be given the choice of
living at the downtown building or in

private homes.
Lohnes believes this arrangement
would be in line with the
recommendations of the Presidential
Commission on Overseas Campuses,
which reported its findings last month.
The Commission indicated no
compelling academic reason to
continue the Vienna program in its
present form, but left open the option
of an experimental program. The
Faculty Senate unanimously voted to
close down the present
Stanford-in-Austria campus last
month.
According to Lohnes, the proposed
program would include a five-week,
intensive language program at the start
of each group's residency. The
curriculum for each group would be
structured around specific study areas:
the fall-winter group would
concentrate on contemporary Austria,
while the spring-summer group would
center on Eastern Europe. Lohnes
believes this subject-intensive approach
would accord "flexibility and
academic strength" to the Austrian
program.
Wait-And-See
While the Committee on Foreign
Study Programs deliberates the future
of the Austrian program this
afternoon, the Overseas Campuses

office is taking a wait-and-see attitude
on budgets at all five campuses in the
aftermath of President Nixon's ten
percent devaluation of the dollar.
Patricia Clark, financial assistant to
the Overseas Campuses Office, said
yesterday that there is "no way of
telling what the extent of change will
be" for budgets at the Hve European
campuses.
When the dollar was last floated —
in August, 1971 — and finally
devalued 12 percent four months later,
the result was not much different from
what had been anticipated, she said.
The gradual nature of long term
changes in the money market,
suggested Clark, has delayed any
reading of how the devaluation will
affect budgets overseas.
She added that so far, the price of
the British pound has increased by
only a few cents.
The Committee on Foreign Study
Programs has formed a search
committee for the new Director of the
Overseas Campuses Program. Faculty,
students, and staff interested in the
position, as well as those who wish to
recommend others, are encouraged to
contact, or send a statement to Prof.
Clark Reynolds, Room 306, Food
Research Institute, or telephone him
at ext. 3096 by next Monday.

LAST LEG? — Stanford-in-Austria, apparently destined to close, may yet be salvaged. A proposal to continue the
program on an experimental basis will be submitted to the Committee on Foreign Study Programs today.
