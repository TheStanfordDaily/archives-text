# Fiscal Sobriety
## Spending Ourselves To Oblivion 
### 
John J. Rhodes

There can be no question that
our nation faces numerous
problems, each staggering in scope
and complexity. However, I am
certain that the single greatest
area where attention must be
focused and solutions must be
formulated, is the area of our
national economy. Fiscal sobriety
must take hold on Capitol Hill.
In a misguided effort to
constantly convince the American
public of its imaginative powers,
Congress has for years been
constructing broad, costly
programs, each designed to be a
cure-all for a particular problem
area. Unfortunately, in the race to
impress the voters of the country
that Congress recognizes national

needs, and is determined to meet
them, we have created a fiscal
crisis—one that will be very
difficult to curtail, even with the
best national effort.
The fact is that Congress
seldom even attempts to
contemplate this country's
far-ranging economic problems
and limitations.
While not intending to sound
like an alarmist, I must point out
that no government, no matter
how rich, can continue to
over-spend, or undertax, by
multi-billions of dollars nearly
every year and still avoid financial
disaster indefinitely.
National deficits are becoming
an historical habit and none of us
appear to be contemplating the
long-range consequences.
Fiscal Realities
There simply are not enough
dollars to pay for all the programs
that we might all agree are
worthwhile and necessary when
considered independently of the
fiscal realities.
I need not discuss the
demonstrated need for more
money for education, cancer
research, manpower programs or
for many other vital programs.
The fact cannot be escaped that
present spending patterns do not
just lead to some vague editorial
disappointment about red ink.
The continued and growing debt
of this country suggests the dismal
picture of a great Nation spending
itself to oblivion.
The comforting gtuation of
being able to design new programs
and expand old ones to meet
legitimate and distressing
problems of our fellow citizens is
a luxury; a luxury this Nation
cannot afford. We must equate
federal programs with the
willingness of the American
people to pay the bill.
'Pork Barrel' Legislation
For far too long "pork barrel"
legislation has been accepted as a
way to get things done. This
pattern has sent each major
interest group to Washington to
attempt to get its share of the
economic pie through the political
process rather than through the
market place. And, as a result, as
the market economy declines in
relative importance, the allocation
of resources is increasingly
accomplished through the
political process, with far too
little attention paid the Nation's
fiscal health.
Originally the basic
Congressional appropriations
process was designed to provide
the elected representatives of the
people with an opportunity to
scrutinize carefully the programs
which require the citizen's money.
However, over the years a
number of legislative procedures
have developed which allow a
great many programs to
circumvent the time-tested
procedure of the annual
Congressional review of demands
on our Treasury. As a result,
billions of dollars now flow
through the backdoors and
sidedoors of our Treasury,

avoiding Congressional review.
Nearly 70 percent of our national
expenditures are not categorized
as "uncontrollable."
Who Knows?
These expenditures, therefore,
are not readily influenced by the
changes in the national economy,
or the possible changes of the
national needs. And even more
important, under this diffused
practice not even the Members of
Congress, the Senators, or the
American people can know just
what is being done with every
taxpayer's dollar.
I feel our economy can be
adequate, if our political system is
disciplined.
The point has been made many
times by many people that no
democracy can avoid collapse if it
ignores what is undeniably strong
medicine—national discipline and
restraint.
And once the economic
situation is understood, we must
be restrained and reasoned in the
financing of public programs. It is

the taxpayer whose money is
being spent—programs should not
be funded beyond the American
people's willingness to foot the
bill.
Luckily it appears that
sensitivity toward this perplexing
problem is developing in Congress.
Of course it would be a mistake to
assume that the federal spending
binge of the last few years is
over—obligations have already
been made. But perhaps we are
getting near the end of the era of
casual disdain, and sometimes
outright contempt for the limits
of federal resources.
The 93rd Congress is a
Congress that must learn
discipline and restraint. This is
going to be a hard lesson for
Congress to learn, it is the biggest
problem to be faced and one that
must be met.
