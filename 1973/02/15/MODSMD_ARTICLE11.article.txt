Safely Tucked Away
Editor:
After reading that Alain C.
Enthoven, former head of the
Pentagon's office of systems
analysis, will become a professor
at Stanford, I shuddered to think
that hotheads on campus might
object and begin shouting "war
criminal!" This would be unwise
as well as unmannerly.
According to Mr. Enthoven,
quoted in Bill Evers' Daily article,
the work of the systems analysis
office after June 1965 was "aimed
at improving the management of
the war effort." Mr. Enthoven and
his colleagues produced some epic
statistics: 53,771 dead Americans;
more than 900,000 dead
Vietnamese and nearly a million
wounded; 285,000 orphans; four
million refugees in South Vietnam
alone, and five million acres of
crop land and forests destroyed.
All this at a costofslls billion
dollars and the use of 27 billion
pounds of explosives.
I don't know what Mr.
Enthoven's long run goals were
when he started improving the
U.S. war effort in Vietnam, but
the only accomplishment to date
of all his work is the tightest and
cruelest little dictatorship the
world has seen in a long time.
Thanks to the Pentagon and its
analysts, South Vietnam is a
country of slums and wasteland,
of refugee camps and empty ruins,
a country with 300,000 special
policemen and 200,000 political
prisoners.
So when Professor Rowen of

the Business School says he is
"wildly enthusiastic" about Mr.
Enthoven's appointment I
cheerfully agree. And smaller
nations all over the world will
probably offer up prayers of
thankfulness when they hear the
news. For it is infinitely better to
have Mr. Enthoven safely tucked
away on the Stanford campus,
where the worst harm he can do is
to short-circuit a computer, than
to have him helping to run the
United States government.

VanPetten Unconvincing
Editor:
In his letter of Feb. 13, ASSU
Vice-President Peter Van Petten
seriously misconstrues the point
of the opinion column entitled
"Politics and the Grateful Dead."
The column was not meant to
malign the management of the
ASSU Special Events program;
indeed, no mention of the
program was even made. The
purpose of the column was
instead to question the propriety
of Mr. Van Petten's using
advertising for the concert as
publicity for his impending
campaign for the ASSU
presidency.
Mr. Van Petten's denial of
political motivation in his peculiar
method of advertising is not
convincing. If one of the
handout's intentions was to

defend the ASSU, as Mr.
Van Petten claims, why didn't it
mention all four members of the
Council of Presidents?
The only member of the
council mentioned on the
concert's advertisement is Mr.
Van Petten, and the only member
running for re-election is Mr.
Van Petten. Is this correlation
merely coincidental? After seeing
the handout, a discerning observer
would not think so.

The recent article "Quake
Could Quash Quad Quickly"
(Daily, Feb. 13) may serve the
purpose of "ocusing attention on
earthquake hazards at Stanford —
but does little to leave one with
any comforting feeling that
significant progress in
understanding the causes and
effects of earthquakes is being
made.
On the contrary, great progress
has been made in the past 5 years
and it may well be true that we
will leam to control earthquakes
before we can predict them. One
promising discovery is that water
plays an important role in
earthquake processes. It has been
demonstrated that water can act
as a lubricant along potential
earthquake faults so that injection
of water may provide a safe means
of earthquake control. The
movement of subsurface ground
water may also provide the
explanation for the occurrence of
earthquake aftershocks.
The need for increased
interdisciplinary studies between
geophysicists and engineers on
earthquake effects cannot be
overemphasized. Statements
about 'earthquake proof
buildings must be viewed critically
because engineers are hampered
by the lack of near-field ground
acceleration data for a "design
earthquake." Moreover, economic
considerations balanced against
hazards will always tend to limit
the degree to which construction
can be made earthquake resistant.
And basic knowledge of quake
hazards is far from complete. The
highest ground acceleration ever
recorded was near the moderate
magnitude 6.4 San Fernando,
California, shock of Feb. 9,1971.
There remain considerable
problems in extrapolating ground
motion effects to larger
magnitude earthquakes, such as
the 1906 San Francisco shock.
These and other fundamental
studies of earthquake effects on
man's environment are becoming
a significant direction of research
here at Stanford.

VanPetten Unconvincing
Editor:
In his letter of Feb. 13, ASSU
Vice-President Peter Van Petten
seriously misconstrues the point
of the opinion column entitled
"Politics and the Grateful Dead."
The column was not meant to
malign the management of the
ASSU Special Events program;
indeed, no mention of the
program was even made. The
purpose of the column was
instead to question the propriety
of Mr. Van Petten's using
advertising for the concert as
publicity for his impending
campaign for the ASSU
presidency.
Mr. Van Petten's denial of
political motivation in his peculiar
method of advertising is not
convincing. If one of the
handout's intentions was to

defend the ASSU, as Mr.
Van Petten claims, why didn't it
mention all four members of the
Council of Presidents?
The only member of the
council mentioned on the
concert's advertisement is Mr.
Van Petten, and the only member
running for re-election is Mr.
Van Petten. Is this correlation
merely coincidental? After seeing
the handout, a discerning observer
would not think so.

The recent article "Quake
Could Quash Quad Quickly"
(Daily, Feb. 13) may serve the
purpose of "ocusing attention on
earthquake hazards at Stanford —
but does little to leave one with
any comforting feeling that
significant progress in
understanding the causes and
effects of earthquakes is being
made.
On the contrary, great progress
has been made in the past 5 years
and it may well be true that we
will leam to control earthquakes
before we can predict them. One
promising discovery is that water
plays an important role in
earthquake processes. It has been
demonstrated that water can act
as a lubricant along potential
earthquake faults so that injection
of water may provide a safe means
of earthquake control. The
movement of subsurface ground
water may also provide the
explanation for the occurrence of
earthquake aftershocks.
The need for increased
interdisciplinary studies between
geophysicists and engineers on
earthquake effects cannot be
overemphasized. Statements
about 'earthquake proof
buildings must be viewed critically
because engineers are hampered
by the lack of near-field ground
acceleration data for a "design
earthquake." Moreover, economic
considerations balanced against
hazards will always tend to limit
the degree to which construction
can be made earthquake resistant.
And basic knowledge of quake
hazards is far from complete. The
highest ground acceleration ever
recorded was near the moderate
magnitude 6.4 San Fernando,
California, shock of Feb. 9,1971.
There remain considerable
problems in extrapolating ground
motion effects to larger
magnitude earthquakes, such as
the 1906 San Francisco shock.
These and other fundamental
studies of earthquake effects on
man's environment are becoming
a significant direction of research
here at Stanford.

After reading that Alain C.
Enthoven, former head of the
Pentagon's office of systems
analysis, will become a professor
at Stanford, I shuddered to think
that hotheads on campus might
object and begin shouting "war
criminal!" This would be unwise
as well as unmannerly.
According to Mr. Enthoven,
quoted in Bill Evers' Daily article,
the work of the systems analysis
office after June 1965 was "aimed
at improving the management of
the war effort." Mr. Enthoven and
his colleagues produced some epic
statistics: 53,771 dead Americans;
more than 900,000 dead
Vietnamese and nearly a million
wounded; 285,000 orphans; four
million refugees in South Vietnam
alone, and five million acres of
crop land and forests destroyed.
All this at a costofslls billion
dollars and the use of 27 billion
pounds of explosives.
I don't know what Mr.
Enthoven's long run goals were
when he started improving the
U.S. war effort in Vietnam, but
the only accomplishment to date
of all his work is the tightest and
cruelest little dictatorship the
world has seen in a long time.
Thanks to the Pentagon and its
analysts, South Vietnam is a
country of slums and wasteland,
of refugee camps and empty ruins,
a country with 300,000 special
policemen and 200,000 political
prisoners.

The only member of the
council mentioned on the
concert's advertisement is Mr.
Van Petten, and the only member
running for re-election is Mr.
Van Petten. Is this correlation
merely coincidental? After seeing
the handout, a discerning observer
would not think so.

Quake Quackery

The recent article "Quake
Could Quash Quad Quickly"
(Daily, Feb. 13) may serve the
purpose of "ocusing attention on
earthquake hazards at Stanford —
but does little to leave one with
any comforting feeling that
significant progress in
understanding the causes and
effects of earthquakes is being
made.
On the contrary, great progress
has been made in the past 5 years
and it may well be true that we
will leam to control earthquakes
before we can predict them. One
promising discovery is that water
plays an important role in
earthquake processes. It has been
demonstrated that water can act
as a lubricant along potential
earthquake faults so that injection
of water may provide a safe means
of earthquake control. The
movement of subsurface ground
water may also provide the
explanation for the occurrence of
earthquake aftershocks.
The need for increased
interdisciplinary studies between
geophysicists and engineers on
earthquake effects cannot be
overemphasized. Statements
about 'earthquake proof
buildings must be viewed critically
because engineers are hampered
by the lack of near-field ground
acceleration data for a "design
earthquake." Moreover, economic
considerations balanced against
hazards will always tend to limit
the degree to which construction
can be made earthquake resistant.
And basic knowledge of quake
hazards is far from complete. The
highest ground acceleration ever
recorded was near the moderate
magnitude 6.4 San Fernando,
California, shock of Feb. 9,1971.
There remain considerable
problems in extrapolating ground
motion effects to larger
magnitude earthquakes, such as
the 1906 San Francisco shock.
These and other fundamental
studies of earthquake effects on
man's environment are becoming
a significant direction of research
here at Stanford.

Safely Tucked Away
Editor:
After reading that Alain C.
Enthoven, former head of the
Pentagon's office of systems
analysis, will become a professor
at Stanford, I shuddered to think
that hotheads on campus might
object and begin shouting "war
criminal!" This would be unwise
as well as unmannerly.
According to Mr. Enthoven,
quoted in Bill Evers' Daily article,
the work of the systems analysis
office after June 1965 was "aimed
at improving the management of
the war effort." Mr. Enthoven and
his colleagues produced some epic
statistics: 53,771 dead Americans;
more than 900,000 dead
Vietnamese and nearly a million
wounded; 285,000 orphans; four
million refugees in South Vietnam
alone, and five million acres of
crop land and forests destroyed.
All this at a costofslls billion
dollars and the use of 27 billion
pounds of explosives.
I don't know what Mr.
Enthoven's long run goals were
when he started improving the
U.S. war effort in Vietnam, but
the only accomplishment to date
of all his work is the tightest and
cruelest little dictatorship the
world has seen in a long time.
Thanks to the Pentagon and its
analysts, South Vietnam is a
country of slums and wasteland,
of refugee camps and empty ruins,
a country with 300,000 special
policemen and 200,000 political
prisoners.
So when Professor Rowen of

the Business School says he is
"wildly enthusiastic" about Mr.
Enthoven's appointment I
cheerfully agree. And smaller
nations all over the world will
probably offer up prayers of
thankfulness when they hear the
news. For it is infinitely better to
have Mr. Enthoven safely tucked
away on the Stanford campus,
where the worst harm he can do is
to short-circuit a computer, than
to have him helping to run the
United States government.

VanPetten Unconvincing
Editor:
In his letter of Feb. 13, ASSU
Vice-President Peter Van Petten
seriously misconstrues the point
of the opinion column entitled
"Politics and the Grateful Dead."
The column was not meant to
malign the management of the
ASSU Special Events program;
indeed, no mention of the
program was even made. The
purpose of the column was
instead to question the propriety
of Mr. Van Petten's using
advertising for the concert as
publicity for his impending
campaign for the ASSU
presidency.
Mr. Van Petten's denial of
political motivation in his peculiar
method of advertising is not
convincing. If one of the
handout's intentions was to

defend the ASSU, as Mr.
Van Petten claims, why didn't it
mention all four members of the
Council of Presidents?
The only member of the
council mentioned on the
concert's advertisement is Mr.
Van Petten, and the only member
running for re-election is Mr.
Van Petten. Is this correlation
merely coincidental? After seeing
the handout, a discerning observer
would not think so.
