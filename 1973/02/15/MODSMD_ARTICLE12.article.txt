# 'Danger To Press Freedom'
## Against Shield Laws 
### 
EverB And Kohn

We believe that Sen. Cranston
(Daily, Feb. 14) is misguided in
thinking that shield laws will
protect freedom of the press. In
fact, the logic behind shield laws
constitutes a very real danger to
press freedom.
Freedom of the press in the
United States is founded upon the
prohibition against government
interference written into the First
Amendment to the Constitution.
This basic Bill of Rights
protection is extended to cover all
facets of the government by the
Fourteenth Amendment.
It is precisely in turning away
from taking a stand upon the firm
rock of the language of the First
Amendment that newsmen,
editors and misguided Senators
depart from their best grounds for
defense.
A Fundamental Right
As the late Supreme Court
Justice Hugo Black said: "Some
people regard the prohibitions of
the Constitution, even its most
unequivocal commands, as mere
admonitions which Congress need
not always observe ... I cannot
accept this approach to the Bill of
Rights. It is my belief that there
are 'absolutes' in our Bill of
Rights, and that they were put
there on purpose by men who
knew what words meant, and
meant their prohibitions to be
'absolutes.' "
Sen. Cranston speaks of a law
granting newsmen total immunity
in protecting news sources. He
says this will work.
In fact, Sen. Cranston chose his
words well when he termed a
shield law a "grant." What the
government "grants," the
government can take away. Free

journalism requires that a free
press be a fundamental right, one
irrevocably removed from state
control.
Notes
One additional point need be
raised. A newsman's notes are his
own. On Oct. 22, 1972, the New
York Times printed a perceptive
letter by John Mackay on just this
point. He noted that
governmental harassment of
newsmen is fundamentally an
attack upon "a newsman's right to
the information he has obtained."
The argument against Sen.
Cranston and others, then, has

three elements. First, we should
stick to the literal meaning of the
First Amendment — "Congress
shall make no law ... abridging
the freedom... of the press."
Second, if the legislature can pass
a shield law this easily, it can also
repeal one with the same ease.
Lastly, the government's
whimsical — or even serious —
desire to acquire information
cannot be allowed to interfere
with individual rights.

not always observe ... I cannot
accept this approach to the Bill of
Rights. It is my belief that there
are 'absolutes' in our Bill of
Rights, and that they were put
there on purpose by men who
knew what words meant, and
meant their prohibitions to be
'absolutes.' "
Sen. Cranston speaks of a law
granting newsmen total immunity
in protecting news sources. He
says this will work.
In fact, Sen. Cranston chose his
words well when he termed a
shield law a "grant." What the
government "grants," the
government can take away. Free

journalism requires that a free
press be a fundamental right, one
irrevocably removed from state
control.
Notes
One additional point need be
raised. A newsman's notes are his
own. On Oct. 22, 1972, the New
York Times printed a perceptive
letter by John Mackay on just this
point. He noted that
governmental harassment of
newsmen is fundamentally an
attack upon "a newsman's right to
the information he has obtained."
The argument against Sen.
Cranston and others, then, has

three elements. First, we should
stick to the literal meaning of the
First Amendment — "Congress
shall make no law ... abridging
the freedom... of the press."
Second, if the legislature can pass
a shield law this easily, it can also
repeal one with the same ease.
Lastly, the government's
whimsical — or even serious —
desire to acquire information
cannot be allowed to interfere
with individual rights.

We believe that Sen. Cranston
(Daily, Feb. 14) is misguided in
thinking that shield laws will
protect freedom of the press. In
fact, the logic behind shield laws
constitutes a very real danger to
press freedom.
Freedom of the press in the
United States is founded upon the
prohibition against government
interference written into the First
Amendment to the Constitution.
This basic Bill of Rights
protection is extended to cover all
facets of the government by the
Fourteenth Amendment.
It is precisely in turning away
from taking a stand upon the firm
rock of the language of the First
Amendment that newsmen,
editors and misguided Senators
depart from their best grounds for
defense.
A Fundamental Right
As the late Supreme Court
Justice Hugo Black said: "Some
people regard the prohibitions of
the Constitution, even its most
unequivocal commands, as mere
admonitions which Congress need
not always observe ... I cannot
accept this approach to the Bill of
Rights. It is my belief that there
are 'absolutes' in our Bill of
Rights, and that they were put
there on purpose by men who
knew what words meant, and
meant their prohibitions to be
'absolutes.' "
