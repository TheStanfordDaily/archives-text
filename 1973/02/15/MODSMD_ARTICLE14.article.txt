Electrical Engineering Prof.
Frederick W. Crawford, 41, has
been named director of the
Stanford Center for
Interdisciplinary Research, and
associate dean of graduate studies,
effective immediately, Provost
William F. Miller has announced.
"Fred Crawford brings a
unique set of talents to this area
by which, I am confident,
interdisciplinary research at
Stanford will continue to remain
important and healthy," Miller
said.
The center was established last
June, with Vice-Provost for
Research William F. Massy as

acting director, to stimulate the
development of interdisciplinary
research, particularly on societal
problems. Initially, it absorbed
the Institute for Public Policy
Analysis. Recently, it has added
programs in transportation and
telecommunications.
As an associate dean of
graduate studies, Crawford will
have responsibility for
interdisciplinary aspects of the
academic program, such as
interdepartmental Ph.D.
programs.
He came to Stanford as a
research associate in 1959,
became a senior research associate
in 1964, and joined the faculty in
1967. He holds B.S. and M.S.
degrees in mathematics and B.S.
in engineering from the University
of London, also a diploma in
education, a Ph.D., and a doctor
of engineering degree from the
University of Liverpool.
He has published extensively in
the field of plasma physics, and
will continue to direct his
experimental group in the
Stanford Institute for Plasma
Research.
He has served on numerous
University committees, including
the Provost's Ad Hoc Committee
on Interdisciplinary Research
which functioned prior to
formation of the Center, and is
currently vice-chairman of the
Faculty Senate and its Steering
Committee.
