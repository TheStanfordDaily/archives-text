# 'Relaxation' Combats Exam Fears
## 
### 
Fear of examinations, common
enough among U.S.
undergraduates, is being dealt
with at the University on a
psychological basis.
It's called "systematic
desensitization," and it combines
deep relaxation with mental
imagery.
In charge of the program this
quarter is Pam Bjorklund, master's
degree candidate in counseling
and testing, whose required
project it is.
The program will be a
one-time affair, unless someone
else takes over next quarter.
Bjorklund, a psychology major
as an undergraduate, is putting
what she learned into practice.
She intends to become a clinical
psychologist.
Her project is sponsored by the
Institute for Behavioral
Counseling in the School of
Education. So far she has eight
patients, with whom she works
individually and in groups from
two to eight.
Therapy begins after a
preliminary screening of the
subjects. Those who can be helped
are asked to lie on the floor and
practice total relaxation, first with
the help of a tape-recorded voice
and then with her coaching.
They are asked to picture in
their minds such relaxing ideas as
sunning on a tropical beach or
floating on an inner tube in a
comfortably warm swimming
pool.
This technique is applied to
thinking about tension inducing

forthcoming events, such as
mid-terms or final exams.
Preliminary results indicate the
therapy is helpful, Bjorklund
reports.
'This technique is especially
meaningful at Stanford," she says,
"where nearly everyone is a good
student. But even the best get
unnerved when fhey see a roomful
of their peers all writing, while
their own mind is a blank."
An important phase of the
treatment is for the patient to
form his own "anxiety hierarchy"
on a scale from zero to 100â€”with
100 indicating the greatest
anxiety.
Anxieties are discussed in the
therapy groups, Bjorklund
reports. One of the benefits seems

to come from discovering that
sufferers "are not alone."
