# Law Students Provide Income Tax Aid
## 
### 
Three second-year Stanford
law students have established a
low-cost income tax service to
help East Palo Alto residents
prepare their returtis.
Called Simplified Tax Service,
it's been in operation for a week
at 1493 East Bayshore Rd., just
north of University Avenue.
Hours are 3 to 9 p.m. Monday
through Friday and 10 a.m. to 5
p.m. Saturday. The phone is
322-6800.

Booker Wade got the idea for
the project when the Internal
Revenue Service publicized the
shortcomings of existing
commercial firms in this field.
"We thought that if it was true
that most middle-class Americans
didn't need expensive tax help, it
probably was especially the case
for minority people, who usually
don't have capital gains or other
complex tax matters."
At the same time, he adds,

there's often a "gut" response
against going to the IRS directly
for help. "You don't go to the
devil to ask how to beat him,"
Booker explains. "IRS may not
give you the benefit of the
doubt."
The students, all of whom are
black, felt they'd have a better
chance of relating to the
community, which has about
8000 taxpayers.
After applying unsuccessfully
for a foundation grant to
underwrite the service, they
obtained a private bank loan for
several hundred dollars and
designed their operation to break
even financially. Seven law
student volunteers will be paid
only enough to make up for funds
they might otherwise earn
through work-study programs.
They expect to do about 200
returns, with most costing $5 to
$7.50 to prepare. Some may not
be charged at all. The first person
treated this way had earnings of
$600 for the year, with $80
withheld for taxes.
In some highly commercial
operations, this individual might
have been charged a minimum $5
fee, then offered an immediate
repayment of $40 or $50 on the
estimated refund, for a net cost of
$35 or $45, Wade notes.
All three of those who
organized the project worked
with legal aid in East Palo Alto
last year. Besides Wade, they
include Tyrone Holt and Bill

Dawson.
All the students have taken
courses in tax law.
Contrary to what many people
expect, they point out that there
are no state or federal licensing
requirements for firms or

individuals in this field. One
reason licensing has not been
sought by legislatures and the IRS
is concern that this might provide
a near monopoly position to
existing commercial firms in this
field, Wade believes.
