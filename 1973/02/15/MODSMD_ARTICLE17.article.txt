# Bureau Of Economics To Headquarter Here
## 
### 
The National Bureau of
Economic Research (NBER) will
locate its western headquarters on
the Stanford campus near the
Center for Advanced Study in the
Behavioral Sciences, the New
York headquarters of the NBER
announced last Monday.
The NBER, now in its 51st
year, is an internationally known
organization for scientific
economic research. It is nonprofit,
independent, and privately
supported.
The headquarters will be
located on a jutting shelf of land
just below and northwest of the
Center for Advanced Study.
NBER's new president, John
R. Meyers, is a 45-year-old
professor of economics at Yale
University and a director of
several large corporations.
According to a recent interview
with Meyers in the New York

Times, the National Bureau is a
unique institution in American
intellectual life. It plays a vital if
indirect role in the government's
management of the economy.
Its prestige is enhanced by the
quality of its research. Among the
noted economists associated with
the Bureau are Dr. Arthur Burns,
its former president, now
chairman of the Federal Reserve
Board; and Prof. Milton Friedman
of the University of Chicago, a
member of the senior research
staff.
It has a research staff of 165,
supported by a budget of $3.5
million from grants and income
from a small endowment.
The bureau, founded in 1921,
is credited with coining the phrase
"gross national product" — the
dollar total of all goods and
services produced in the U.S.
during a year — which originated
during an assignment from
Secretary of Commerce Herbert
Hoover to correlate and analyze
the business cycle and
unemployment.
