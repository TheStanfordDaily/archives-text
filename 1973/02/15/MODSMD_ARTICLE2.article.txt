# C-15 Chooses Student Chairman
## 
### DAVID SCHWARTZ 
At its first meeting of the year last
Thursday, the Committee of 15 (C-15)
unanimously elected senior James
Anderson as its new Chairman. At
present the C-15 is charged with
recommending amendments to the
Judicial Charter.
Plagued last year by a student
faculty rift which culminated in the
walkout of all of its student members,
the C-15 will probably work more
harmoniously this year than it did
then, predicted Anderson.
"Every member of the committee
this year is approaching the task at
hand with an open mind," he
explained. He feels that his selection as
Chairman reflects a decline in the
bitterness over last year's controversy.
Committee member and ASSU
President Scott Burke called
Anderson's election "a gesture of
extreme magnanimity" on the part of
faculty members on the committee.
Agenda Indefinite
The agenda for the C-15 is as of yet
indefinite. Though theoretically
obligated to examine the proposals put
forth by the October, 1972 student
referendum, the C-15 has decided to
consider instead more general
proposals for Judicial Charter
amendment.
These proposals will be drafted by
Anderson and Burke and put before
students for signing sometime next
week.
The reason for this change,
according to Burke, is that the
October referendum was "too narrow,
giving the C-15 too little flexibility to
examine the judicial system and the
Campus Judicial Panel [CJP]."
Student Majority Issue
C-15 deliberations, according to
Anderson, will probably center around
five issues. One of the most

controversial, in the view of Law Prof.
Jack Friedenthal, a member of the
C-15, is the concept of a student
majority on a judicial panel dealing
solely with students.
When the C-15 proposed a faculty
majority last year, all six of the
student members of last year's
committee walked out.
Anderson stated, "I foresee no such
walkout this year." He views his role
as Chairman as precluding any such
action on his part. He termed last
year's walkout "counterproductive,"
noting that it left bitterness and
mistrust in its wake.
He hopes the C-15 will reach a
compromise on this issue.
Student Selection Conflict
Friedenthal noted that another
point of contention will probably be
the method of selection of students
for a judicial panel. At present, the
Faculty Senate and the President

choose faculty and administration
members for the CJP, while students
are chosen randomly.
The October referendum expressed
dissatisfaction with this method,
suggesting that faculty and
administration members be chosen by
"comparable" methods.
Other points which the C-15 will
probably discuss include limiting the
absolute power of the Chairman to
discipline student participants in
judicial hearings and developing a new
amendment system to the Judicial
Charter guaranteeing student veto,
according to Burke.
Major Topics
Anderson and Friedenthal both
emphasized, however, that the issues
of student composition and selection
will be the major topics in the C-15
deliberations.
Anderson stated that he was
hopeful of a successful compromise on

these issues. Friedenthal warned,
however, that it is "difficult to change
people's minds. Perhaps an entirely
new approach is needed."
The next C-15 meeting will take
place on Thursday, Feb. 22. Anderson
and Burke hope to have the new, more
flexible proposals signed and ready for
committee deliberation by that time.

indefinite. Though theoretically
obligated to examine the proposals put
forth by the October, 1972 student
referendum, the C-15 has decided to
consider instead more general
proposals for Judicial Charter
amendment.
These proposals will be drafted by
Anderson and Burke and put before
students for signing sometime next
week.
The reason for this change,
according to Burke, is that the
October referendum was "too narrow,
giving the C-15 too little flexibility to
examine the judicial system and the
Campus Judicial Panel [CJP]."
Student Majority Issue
C-15 deliberations, according to
Anderson, will probably center around
five issues. One of the most

controversial, in the view of Law Prof.
Jack Friedenthal, a member of the
C-15, is the concept of a student
majority on a judicial panel dealing
solely with students.
When the C-15 proposed a faculty
majority last year, all six of the
student members of last year's
committee walked out.
Anderson stated, "I foresee no such
walkout this year." He views his role
as Chairman as precluding any such
action on his part. He termed last
year's walkout "counterproductive,"
noting that it left bitterness and
mistrust in its wake.
He hopes the C-15 will reach a
compromise on this issue.
Student Selection Conflict
Friedenthal noted that another
point of contention will probably be
the method of selection of students
for a judicial panel. At present, the
Faculty Senate and the President

choose faculty and administration
members for the CJP, while students
are chosen randomly.
The October referendum expressed
dissatisfaction with this method,
suggesting that faculty and
administration members be chosen by
"comparable" methods.
Other points which the C-15 will
probably discuss include limiting the
absolute power of the Chairman to
discipline student participants in
judicial hearings and developing a new
amendment system to the Judicial
Charter guaranteeing student veto,
according to Burke.
Major Topics
Anderson and Friedenthal both
emphasized, however, that the issues
of student composition and selection
will be the major topics in the C-15
deliberations.
Anderson stated that he was
hopeful of a successful compromise on

these issues. Friedenthal warned,
however, that it is "difficult to change
people's minds. Perhaps an entirely
new approach is needed."
The next C-15 meeting will take
place on Thursday, Feb. 22. Anderson
and Burke hope to have the new, more
flexible proposals signed and ready for
committee deliberation by that time.
At its first meeting of the year last
Thursday, the Committee of 15 (C-15)
unanimously elected senior James
Anderson as its new Chairman. At
present the C-15 is charged with
recommending amendments to the
Judicial Charter.
Plagued last year by a student
faculty rift which culminated in the
walkout of all of its student members,
the C-15 will probably work more
harmoniously this year than it did
then, predicted Anderson.
"Every member of the committee
this year is approaching the task at
hand with an open mind," he
explained. He feels that his selection as
Chairman reflects a decline in the
bitterness over last year's controversy.
Committee member and ASSU
President Scott Burke called
Anderson's election "a gesture of
extreme magnanimity" on the part of
faculty members on the committee.
Agenda Indefinite
The agenda for the C-15 is as of yet
indefinite. Though theoretically
