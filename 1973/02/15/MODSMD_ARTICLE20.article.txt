# SST Cancer Threat Seen
## 
### 
A report from a panel of experts to the National
Academy of Sciences released Feb. 11, predicts that
8000 new cases of cancer could be caused annually
if high flying si personic planes should damage the
earth's thin layer of ozone in the upper atmosphere.
The 46-page report by a group of scientists
chaired by Dr. Kendric C. Smith, a University
biochemist, based its estimate from the
progressively higher incidence of skin cancers near
the equator where persons receive greater exposure
to sunlight and ultraviolet radiation.
The scientists said there was not enough
information to draw positive conclusions about the
effects of the once proposed 2000-miles-per-hour
supersonic transport (SST), but they commented:
"Sufficient knowledge is at hand to warrant utmost
concern over the possible detrimental effects on our
environment by the operation of large numbers of
supersonic aircraft."
Congress scrapped the American SST program in
1971 on grounds of noise and atmospheric
pollution, but debate on the SST effects on the
atmosphere was quite limited, Dr. Smith said.
Life on earth is partially shielded from
biologically harmful solar ultraviolate radiation by a

thin layer of ozone in the upper atmosphere.
Scientists disagree on whether operation of fleets of
SST s would alter the ozone of the stratosphere,
thus increasing the amount of solar ultraviolet
radiation reaching the earth.
But the panel said if these activities should lessen
the amount of ozone in the stratosphere, there
would be a high probability of significant harm to
humans and to other life systems.
Because of the radiation-absorbing properties of
ozone, a small decrease in ozone concentration
would result in a large increase in ultraviolet
radiation reaching the earth's surface in the
wavelength range 280-320 nanometers (billionths of
a meter). A five percent decrease in ozone
concentration, for example, would yield a 26
percent increase in the intensity of the most
biologically damaging ultraviolet radiation.
The scientists recommended gathering
information on the wavelength distribution and
intensities of ultraviolet radiation at several
locations on the earth's surface to provide a baseline
from which to evaluate possible future
environmental changes.
