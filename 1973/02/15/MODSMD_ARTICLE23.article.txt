# Nicholson Gets Off The Track In 'King Of Marvin Gardens'
## 
### DAVID H. BRENNER 
Jack Nicholson is in trouble.
The man who stole the show in
"Easy Rider" and created one of
the more memorable moments in
recent motion picture history
when he exploded in rage at Ann
Margaret in "Carnal Knowledge,"
is in danger of forever being the
lonely man in search of himself,
wandering through film after film
in an endless quest for his
cinematic soul.
Nicholson is adequate in Bob
Rafelson's "The King of Marvin
Gardens," but one can't avoid a
feeling of deja vu watching him
portray David Stabler, a mild,
philosophical radio story-teller
who is dissatisfied with his lot,
but too timid to change.
In this film David is summoned
to Atlantic City by his fast-talking
older brother, Jason, who wants
his help in planning a new resort
paradise in Hawaii. Bruce Dern
brings just the right amount of
bravado to the role of Jason, a

middle-aged con-artist with a
king-sized ego.
Two-Dimensional Character
To allay David's fears about
the venture, Jason says, "Tell me
what you're so upset about and
I'll tell you whether or not it's
real." What is, unfortunately, very
real, is the premise for the entire
film. Rafelson tries to explore an
aspect of the "human
predicament," but fails because
his characters remain
two-dimensional; it's as if they
could be peeled right off the
screen.
The ghost-like environs of the
Boardwalk in the winter are the
backdrop for this psychological
drama. Jason comes to Atlantic
City with his second wife, Sally,
and her beautiful step daughter,
Jessica. Problems arise when his
lusting gaze shifts to Jessica,
leaving Sally as the odd woman
out. David's role in all this is
vague, but the situation is resolved
in predictably tragic fashion.

Predictability and unevenness
have characterized both of
Rafelson's major films. A major
criticism of "Five Easy Pieces" is
that despite moments of
excellence it ultimately fails to
hang together as a complete
motion picture. The same charge
can be levelled at "The King of
Marvin Gardens," in which a few
brilliant scenes are lost in a
ponderous bog of excess footage.
One of the brilliant moments
occurs in the cavernous Atlantic
City convention hall, scene of the
Miss America pageant, when
Jessica's fantasy of being crowned
"the most beautiful girl in all the
world" is fulfilled before a
midnight audience of empty
chairs and wooden crates. Here
Rafelson skillfully skirts the
boundary between reality and
fantasy to create a superb instant
of subtle tension. But he breaks
the spell before the foursome ever
leaves the auditorium. Sally, very
symbolically, plays the part of the

former queen, and crowns Jessica
as the new winner.
Short-Lived Excursion
This excursion into excellence
is short-lived, for the film soon
lurches forward to a conclusion
that is as unsatisfying as the
opening was pedantic.
The film begins with David's
face filling the screen as he tapes a
story for his radio show. He is an
artist who, bidding farewell to the
written word, has adopted radio
as his medium of expression. This
episode is far too long and merely
establishes a premise for periodic
breaks in the action when David
pauses to reflect upon the
mysteries of life into a cassette
tape recorder.
Before movies could speak,
dialogue and background were
provided by cards interspersed
with the action. Dialogue in the
first "talkies" was very stiff and
wordy, partly because of technical
limitations, and in part because
audiences were enthralled with

the whole concept of "hearing" a
moving picture. Since those early
days, actors have talked to
themselves, to each other, to their
pets, their cars, and even to God;
but Jack Nicholson may be the
first to bare his soul to a tape
recorder.
Focusing on one character who
speaks, in a sense, directly to the
audience, can be a very effective
device. Mike Nichols used it in

"Carnal Knowledge" with
Nicholson and Art Garfunkel,
who took turns revealing their
innermost thoughts to one
another, and to the audience as
well. But having Nicholson sit in
the bathroom and utter deathless
phrases like "tragedy is top-40," is
little more than heavy-handed
moralizing, and adds just that
much more dead weight to this
already overburdened film.
Skin Deep
Ellen Burstyn comes to the
role of Sally fresh from her
Oscar-winning performance in
"The Last Picture Show," a fact
that Rafelson seems unable to
forget. Watching her this film is
like seeing a big-city sequel to the
small-town tragedy of "Picture
Show." She even has another

lovely daughter (albeit step) to
upstage her at every romantic
turn. Unlike Burstyn, who gives at
least an adequate performance,
Julia Ann Robinson as Jessica
appears to be some forlorn Barbie
lost in the confusion of a strange
dollhouse.
Near the end of the film, David
asks, "In the fun house, how do
you know wuv's really crazy?"
It's a good question: but
RafelsonV films have failed to
shed much light on an answer.
"The King of Marvin Gardens"
is in the end unsatisfying, because
it fails to come to grips with any
of the issues it raises. Rafelson
seems afraid, parrying and
thrusting from all angles, but
either unable or unwilling to move
in for the kill.

boundary between reality and

of subtle tension. But he breaks
the spell before the foursome ever

symbolically, plays the part of the

former queen, and crowns Jessica
as the new winner.
Short-Lived Excursion
This excursion into excellence
is short-lived, for the film soon
lurches forward to a conclusion
that is as unsatisfying as the
opening was pedantic.
The film begins with David's
face filling the screen as he tapes a
story for his radio show. He is an
artist who, bidding farewell to the
written word, has adopted radio
as his medium of expression. This
episode is far too long and merely
establishes a premise for periodic
breaks in the action when David
pauses to reflect upon the
mysteries of life into a cassette
tape recorder.
Before movies could speak,
dialogue and background were
provided by cards interspersed
with the action. Dialogue in the
first "talkies" was very stiff and
wordy, partly because of technical
limitations, and in part because
audiences were enthralled with

the whole concept of "hearing" a
moving picture. Since those early
days, actors have talked to
themselves, to each other, to their
pets, their cars, and even to God;
but Jack Nicholson may be the
first to bare his soul to a tape
recorder.
Focusing on one character who
speaks, in a sense, directly to the
audience, can be a very effective
device. Mike Nichols used it in

"Carnal Knowledge" with
Nicholson and Art Garfunkel,
who took turns revealing their
innermost thoughts to one
another, and to the audience as
well. But having Nicholson sit in
the bathroom and utter deathless
phrases like "tragedy is top-40," is
little more than heavy-handed
moralizing, and adds just that
much more dead weight to this
already overburdened film.
Skin Deep
Ellen Burstyn comes to the
role of Sally fresh from her
Oscar-winning performance in
"The Last Picture Show," a fact
that Rafelson seems unable to
forget. Watching her this film is
like seeing a big-city sequel to the
small-town tragedy of "Picture
Show." She even has another

lovely daughter (albeit step) to
upstage her at every romantic
turn. Unlike Burstyn, who gives at
least an adequate performance,
Julia Ann Robinson as Jessica
appears to be some forlorn Barbie
lost in the confusion of a strange
dollhouse.
Near the end of the film, David
asks, "In the fun house, how do
you know wuv's really crazy?"
It's a good question: but
RafelsonV films have failed to
shed much light on an answer.
"The King of Marvin Gardens"
is in the end unsatisfying, because
it fails to come to grips with any
of the issues it raises. Rafelson
seems afraid, parrying and
thrusting from all angles, but
either unable or unwilling to move
in for the kill.

ONE LAST TIME — In this scene from"The King Of Marvin Gardens," directed by Bob Rafelson, Jack
Nicholson and Bruce Dern as the Stabler brothers, try one last time to establish the rapport of their
childhood. For a review of this movie, read article at left.
Jack Nicholson is in trouble.
The man who stole the show in
"Easy Rider" and created one of
the more memorable moments in
recent motion picture history
when he exploded in rage at Ann
Margaret in "Carnal Knowledge,"
is in danger of forever being the
lonely man in search of himself,
wandering through film after film
in an endless quest for his
cinematic soul.
Nicholson is adequate in Bob
Rafelson's "The King of Marvin
Gardens," but one can't avoid a
feeling of deja vu watching him
portray David Stabler, a mild,
philosophical radio story-teller
who is dissatisfied with his lot,
but too timid to change.
In this film David is summoned
to Atlantic City by his fast-talking
older brother, Jason, who wants
his help in planning a new resort
paradise in Hawaii. Bruce Dern
brings just the right amount of
bravado to the role of Jason, a

middle-aged con-artist with a
king-sized ego.
Two-Dimensional Character
To allay David's fears about
the venture, Jason says, "Tell me
what you're so upset about and
I'll tell you whether or not it's
real." What is, unfortunately, very
real, is the premise for the entire
film. Rafelson tries to explore an
aspect of the "human
predicament," but fails because
his characters remain
two-dimensional; it's as if they
could be peeled right off the
screen.
The ghost-like environs of the
Boardwalk in the winter are the
backdrop for this psychological
drama. Jason comes to Atlantic
City with his second wife, Sally,
and her beautiful step daughter,
Jessica. Problems arise when his
lusting gaze shifts to Jessica,
leaving Sally as the odd woman
out. David's role in all this is
vague, but the situation is resolved
in predictably tragic fashion.

Predictability and unevenness
have characterized both of
Rafelson's major films. A major
criticism of "Five Easy Pieces" is
that despite moments of
excellence it ultimately fails to
hang together as a complete
motion picture. The same charge
can be levelled at "The King of
Marvin Gardens," in which a few
brilliant scenes are lost in a
ponderous bog of excess footage.
One of the brilliant moments
occurs in the cavernous Atlantic
City convention hall, scene of the
Miss America pageant, when
Jessica's fantasy of being crowned
"the most beautiful girl in all the
world" is fulfilled before a
midnight audience of empty
chairs and wooden crates. Here
Rafelson skillfully skirts the
boundary between reality and
fantasy to create a superb instant
of subtle tension. But he breaks
the spell before the foursome ever
leaves the auditorium. Sally, very
symbolically, plays the part of the

former queen, and crowns Jessica

ONE LAST TIME — In this scene from"The King Of Marvin Gardens," directed by Bob Rafelson, Jack
Nicholson and Bruce Dern as the Stabler brothers, try one last time to establish the rapport of their
childhood. For a review of this movie, read article at left.
Jack Nicholson is in trouble.
The man who stole the show in
"Easy Rider" and created one of
the more memorable moments in
recent motion picture history
when he exploded in rage at Ann
Margaret in "Carnal Knowledge,"
is in danger of forever being the
lonely man in search of himself,
wandering through film after film
in an endless quest for his
cinematic soul.
Nicholson is adequate in Bob
Rafelson's "The King of Marvin
Gardens," but one can't avoid a
feeling of deja vu watching him
portray David Stabler, a mild,
philosophical radio story-teller
who is dissatisfied with his lot,
but too timid to change.
In this film David is summoned
to Atlantic City by his fast-talking
older brother, Jason, who wants
his help in planning a new resort
paradise in Hawaii. Bruce Dern
brings just the right amount of
bravado to the role of Jason, a

middle-aged con-artist with a
king-sized ego.
Two-Dimensional Character
To allay David's fears about
the venture, Jason says, "Tell me
what you're so upset about and
I'll tell you whether or not it's
real." What is, unfortunately, very
real, is the premise for the entire
film. Rafelson tries to explore an
aspect of the "human
predicament," but fails because
his characters remain
two-dimensional; it's as if they
could be peeled right off the
screen.
The ghost-like environs of the
Boardwalk in the winter are the
backdrop for this psychological
drama. Jason comes to Atlantic
City with his second wife, Sally,
and her beautiful step daughter,
Jessica. Problems arise when his
lusting gaze shifts to Jessica,
leaving Sally as the odd woman
out. David's role in all this is
vague, but the situation is resolved
in predictably tragic fashion.

Predictability and unevenness
have characterized both of
Rafelson's major films. A major
criticism of "Five Easy Pieces" is
that despite moments of
excellence it ultimately fails to
hang together as a complete
motion picture. The same charge
can be levelled at "The King of
Marvin Gardens," in which a few
brilliant scenes are lost in a
ponderous bog of excess footage.
One of the brilliant moments
occurs in the cavernous Atlantic
City convention hall, scene of the
Miss America pageant, when
Jessica's fantasy of being crowned
"the most beautiful girl in all the
world" is fulfilled before a
midnight audience of empty
chairs and wooden crates. Here
Rafelson skillfully skirts the
boundary between reality and
fantasy to create a superb instant
of subtle tension. But he breaks
the spell before the foursome ever
leaves the auditorium. Sally, very
symbolically, plays the part of the

former queen, and crowns Jessica
as the new winner.
Short-Lived Excursion
This excursion into excellence
is short-lived, for the film soon
lurches forward to a conclusion
that is as unsatisfying as the
opening was pedantic.
The film begins with David's
face filling the screen as he tapes a
story for his radio show. He is an
artist who, bidding farewell to the
written word, has adopted radio
as his medium of expression. This
episode is far too long and merely
establishes a premise for periodic
breaks in the action when David
pauses to reflect upon the
mysteries of life into a cassette
tape recorder.
Before movies could speak,
dialogue and background were
provided by cards interspersed
with the action. Dialogue in the
first "talkies" was very stiff and
wordy, partly because of technical
limitations, and in part because
audiences were enthralled with

the whole concept of "hearing" a
moving picture. Since those early
days, actors have talked to
themselves, to each other, to their
pets, their cars, and even to God;
but Jack Nicholson may be the
first to bare his soul to a tape
recorder.
Focusing on one character who
speaks, in a sense, directly to the
audience, can be a very effective
device. Mike Nichols used it in

"Carnal Knowledge" with
Nicholson and Art Garfunkel,
who took turns revealing their
innermost thoughts to one
another, and to the audience as
well. But having Nicholson sit in
the bathroom and utter deathless
phrases like "tragedy is top-40," is
little more than heavy-handed
moralizing, and adds just that
much more dead weight to this
already overburdened film.
Skin Deep
Ellen Burstyn comes to the
role of Sally fresh from her
Oscar-winning performance in
"The Last Picture Show," a fact
that Rafelson seems unable to
forget. Watching her this film is
like seeing a big-city sequel to the
small-town tragedy of "Picture
Show." She even has another

lovely daughter (albeit step) to
upstage her at every romantic
turn. Unlike Burstyn, who gives at
least an adequate performance,
Julia Ann Robinson as Jessica
appears to be some forlorn Barbie
lost in the confusion of a strange
dollhouse.
Near the end of the film, David
asks, "In the fun house, how do
you know wuv's really crazy?"
It's a good question: but
RafelsonV films have failed to
shed much light on an answer.
"The King of Marvin Gardens"

of the issues it raises. Rafelson
