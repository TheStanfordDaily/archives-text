# Charles Weidman Dance Company Gives Mediocre S.F. Performance
## 
### CHRISTINE DOUGLAS 
On February 2 and 3, Charles
Weidman and his Theater Dance
Company performed to an
audience of about forty in a
studio-turned-theater in the
Xoregos dance compound in San
Francisco. The intimate setting
for the performance presumably
closed the gap between audience
and performer, but instead of
enhancing the effectiveness of the
show, the proximity served only
to strip the choreography of any
mystery and dramatic effect it
might have had otherwise. Errors
which might have seemed slight
when viewed from a distance
stuck out like sore thumbs.
First of all, in the opening
dance, "Opus 51," the space for
dancing was so small that the
dancers seemed inhibited in their
movement, and at times it seemed
that the effect was rather that of
shuffling than actual dancing.
Second of all, the male dancers
were rigid and extremely awkward
in their movement. In their
attitide positions, they faltered
several times, something which
simply cannot be overlooked
when they are dancing literally
under one's nose. Further, at
times their facial expressions were
so exaggerated that it was difficult
to focus attention on their actual
movement.
Third of all, there was a
preponderance of verbal

explanation on the program,
which revealed a basic insecurity
on the choreographer's part about
the success of his dance in
conveying the intended message.
This insecurity was well-founded,
for with one exception, the pieces
simply did not convey a
well-developed feeling or idea.
"Opus 51" is only the first
section of a six-part dance, and I
cannot understand why they
chose to present only the first
piece. The audience was left at the
end only with an unsatisfied
desire to see the piece
conclusively explored.
"Palms," a piece
choreographed in 1960 and
danced by Janet Towner, was
pleasant to watch, but lacked
vitality and any sense of build-up.
The choreography both
figuratively and literally never got
off the ground, and did not
adequately use the space (what
there was of it!). Towner is a fine
dancer. Too bad the choreography
did not do her justice.
In "Letter to Mrs. Bixby,"
Weidman attempts through simple
gesture to depict the burden of
guilt on Lincoln for the men
killed during the Civil War. He
cuts a very powerful figure when
the lights first come up, but from
there on in it's straight downhill.
The Lincolnesque splendor and
charisma fade quickly as the lights
brighten and the aging Weidman

approaches the audience. Again, I
was haunted by the feeling that he
was just too close to us.
There were three areas of the
performance which were without
question excellent. Weidman is
most at home in the area of mime,
and the highpoint of his time on
stage was in a representational
pantomime of the triangle theme.
He is an excellent mime, and held
the audience rapt with the
subtlety and delicacy of his facial
contortions.
Second of the performance's
three high points was a piece
called "Lynchtown,"
choreographed by Weidman in

1938. Towner as lead dancer was
powerful and fully convincing.
The choreography effectively
changed intensity and focus at
appropriate times, and used the
small theater to enhance audience
involvement without sacrificing a
professional and well-polished
execution of the movement.
The third high point was a
section of a piece called "Brahms'
Waltzes, Op. 39," dedicated by
Weidman to his wife Doris
Humphrey, because, in his words,
"it was the kind of movement she
loved and could dance so
beautifully." In this section, two
of Weidman's female dancers

perform the Humphrey movement
with a liveliness and professional
accuracy noticeably absent in
much of the performance.
The presentation as a whole
left me with the feeling that few
of the dances had been fully
worked out or explored, in terms
of both the choreography, which
often could have stood much
cutting of extraneous material and
insertion of more varied intensity
levels, as well as of the dancers'
actual performance of the
choreography. So that although it
was at times engaging, the
performance could only be
termed inconclusive.

guilt on Lincoln for the men
killed during the Civil War. He
cuts a very powerful figure when
the lights first come up, but from
there on in it's straight downhill.
The Lincolnesque splendor and
charisma fade quickly as the lights
brighten and the aging Weidman

approaches the audience. Again, I
was haunted by the feeling that he
was just too close to us.
There were three areas of the
performance which were without
question excellent. Weidman is
most at home in the area of mime,
and the highpoint of his time on
stage was in a representational
pantomime of the triangle theme.
He is an excellent mime, and held
the audience rapt with the
subtlety and delicacy of his facial
contortions.
Second of the performance's
three high points was a piece
called "Lynchtown,"
choreographed by Weidman in

1938. Towner as lead dancer was
powerful and fully convincing.
The choreography effectively
changed intensity and focus at
appropriate times, and used the
small theater to enhance audience
involvement without sacrificing a
professional and well-polished
execution of the movement.
The third high point was a
section of a piece called "Brahms'
Waltzes, Op. 39," dedicated by
Weidman to his wife Doris
Humphrey, because, in his words,
"it was the kind of movement she
loved and could dance so
beautifully." In this section, two
of Weidman's female dancers

perform the Humphrey movement
with a liveliness and professional
accuracy noticeably absent in
much of the performance.
The presentation as a whole
left me with the feeling that few
of the dances had been fully
worked out or explored, in terms
of both the choreography, which
often could have stood much
cutting of extraneous material and
insertion of more varied intensity
levels, as well as of the dancers'
actual performance of the
choreography. So that although it
was at times engaging, the
performance could only be
termed inconclusive.
On February 2 and 3, Charles
Weidman and his Theater Dance
Company performed to an
audience of about forty in a
studio-turned-theater in the
Xoregos dance compound in San
Francisco. The intimate setting
for the performance presumably
closed the gap between audience
and performer, but instead of
enhancing the effectiveness of the
show, the proximity served only
to strip the choreography of any
mystery and dramatic effect it
might have had otherwise. Errors
which might have seemed slight
when viewed from a distance
stuck out like sore thumbs.
First of all, in the opening
dance, "Opus 51," the space for
dancing was so small that the
dancers seemed inhibited in their
movement, and at times it seemed
that the effect was rather that of
shuffling than actual dancing.
Second of all, the male dancers
were rigid and extremely awkward
in their movement. In their
attitide positions, they faltered
several times, something which
simply cannot be overlooked
when they are dancing literally
under one's nose. Further, at
times their facial expressions were
so exaggerated that it was difficult
to focus attention on their actual
movement.
Third of all, there was a
preponderance of verbal

explanation on the program,
which revealed a basic insecurity
on the choreographer's part about
the success of his dance in
conveying the intended message.
This insecurity was well-founded,
for with one exception, the pieces
simply did not convey a
well-developed feeling or idea.
"Opus 51" is only the first
section of a six-part dance, and I
cannot understand why they
chose to present only the first
piece. The audience was left at the
end only with an unsatisfied
desire to see the piece
conclusively explored.
"Palms," a piece
choreographed in 1960 and
danced by Janet Towner, was
pleasant to watch, but lacked
vitality and any sense of build-up.
The choreography both
figuratively and literally never got
off the ground, and did not
adequately use the space (what
there was of it!). Towner is a fine
dancer. Too bad the choreography
did not do her justice.
In "Letter to Mrs. Bixby,"
Weidman attempts through simple
gesture to depict the burden of
guilt on Lincoln for the men
killed during the Civil War. He
cuts a very powerful figure when
the lights first come up, but from
there on in it's straight downhill.
