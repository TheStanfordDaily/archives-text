Pressure On Dollar Continues
LONDON — A selling wave hit the devalued dollar after
world money markets reopened yesterday, sending the
American currency lower than first expected. The
continued monetary uncertainty lifted the price of gold to
new all-time highs.
"Nobody wants to hold dollars yet," a London foreign
exchange dealer explained.
Even Brazil, in a rare show of economic independence,
raised the dollar value of the cruzeiro by about 3 percent.
This means Americans will probably pay a bit more for
their coffee at home, just as they will be paying more for
foreign vacations and imported goods.
Banking and other financial sources in Europe
conceded that the continued pressure on the dollar was
making money markets nervous. But they cautioned it
was too early to tell whether this meant the dollar
devaluation would fail to halt the international monetary
crisis of the past two weeks.
Most of the world's leading money markets were open
yesterday for the first time since the dollar devaluation
Monday night. But those who had bet billions on a dollar
devaluation did not move to take their profits
immediately.
The unsettled exchange rates appeared to be a factor in
a big drop in New York stock market prices. After initial
enthusiasm in the wake of devaluation Tuesday, the
market turned around and continued lower yesterday.
Vietnam Aid Commission Formed
WASHINGTON — Hanoi and Washington announced
agreement yesterday on creating a joint economic
commission that will help map out dollar aid to rebuild
war-battered North Vietnam.
The disclosure came in a joint communique outlining
nearly four days of recent talks in Hanoi by Henry A.
Kissinger, President Nixon's chief foreign policy aide.
Ronald L. Ziegler, White House press secretary, said
Kissinger and North Vietnamese officials did not discuss
the scope of potential U.S. reconstruction assistance.
Predicting the joint commission would be set up in
about a month, Ziegler said any dollar figures would first
be discussed in that forum, and would be subject to
further consultation with Congress.
The 700-word communique expressed hope the
Kissinger visit "will mark the beginning of new bilateral
relations."
It also spoke of "imperative measures" necessary to
carry out the Vietnam peace accord signed in Paris on Jan.
27. It did not elaborate.
Ziegler said in response to questions that one such item
on which Kissinger w* the North Vietnamese agreed was
the need tc « for trying to trace Americans
still listed as missing in action in Indochina.
The communique said Kissinger and Hanoi officials
"also agreed they would continue to have periodic
exchanges of views" with the aim of making sure the Paris
accords "are strictlyand scrupulously implemented."
Kissinger was en route to Peking via Hong Kong and
will leave there next Monday, making an overnight stop in
Tokyo before returning to Washington the next day.
Cease-Fire Stabilization Sought
SAIGON — A top-level State Department official joined
yesterday in efforts to stabilize the Vietnam cease-fire
that in 18 days has been riddled by violations.
At the intervention of Deputy Asst. Secretary of State
William H. Sullivan, the four-party Joint Military
Commission agreed to do something about trying to stop

the shooting in which Saigon has reported more than
13,000 Vietnamese casualties.
The senior American military representative to the
commission warned the Viet Cong meanwhile, that the
United States will not tolerate any future delays in the
release of American war prisoners in South Vietnam.
20 More POWs Released
CLARK AIR BASE, Philippines — The second large group
of released American war prisoners left the Philippines for
home this morning, just a day after they had wandered
through a U.S.-style supermarket like so many Rip Van
Winkles returned from captivity instead of sleep.
The 20 men, smiling and waving, boarded a Cl4l
Starlifter hospital plane and took off on the 15-hour
journey to Travis Air Base in California.
Twenty other former POWs left for Travis yesterday,
and two went home earlier because of family illnesses.
Another group of 20 men was scheduled to depart later
today.
Anti-hijacking Pact To Be Signed
WASHINGTON — The United States and Cuba will sign
an antihijacking agreement at 8:30 a.m. PST today, U.S.
officials say.
Secretary of State William P. Rogers will sign the
agreement at the State Department, while a Cuban official
will initial the accord simultaneously in Havana.
U.S. officials said the agreement is very satisfactory
and will serve as both a real and a psychological deterrent
to hijacking.
As outlined by these officials, Cuba and the United
States will agree to either extradite or prosecute persons
guilty of hijacking airplanes or ships.
However, the agreement does not affect the traditional
American position concerning acceptance of refugees
from the Caribbean island. This means that a Cuban who
may violate a Cuban law in escaping to the United States
but does not endanger either the crew or passengers of a
ship or aircraft would not be liable for extradition.
Such a refugee would be liable to prosecution under
existing American laws, which could lead to charges of
illegal entry. The American official said the agreement
pledges the United States to enforce such laws, including
the neutrality acts that prohibit use of American soil or
property for attacks on other nations.
Ellsberg Loses Legal Battle
LOS ANGELES — The government in the Pentagon
Papers trial won a legal battle yesterday to show jurors
two security manuals which were described in court as
"critical" evidence against Daniel Ellsberg and Anthony
Russo.
However, U.S. District Court Judge Matt Byrne said he
would rule later on which sections of the rule books may
be shown to jurors.
The government has indicated it will try to show jurors
that Ellsberg and Russo read the manuals but knowingly
violated the rules by taking and copying classified
documents — the Pentagon Papers.
Defense attorneys had argued against use of the
manuals for three days, saying the government hadn't
proven that the manuals in any way related to the
Pentagon's top-secret study of the Vietnam War.
The judge said that would be a matter of jurors to
decide.

Cease-Fire Stabilization Sought
SAIGON — A top-level State Department official joined
yesterday in efforts to stabilize the Vietnam cease-fire
that in 18 days has been riddled by violations.
At the intervention of Deputy Asst. Secretary of State
William H. Sullivan, the four-party Joint Military
Commission agreed to do something about trying to stop

the shooting in which Saigon has reported more than
13,000 Vietnamese casualties.
The senior American military representative to the
commission warned the Viet Cong meanwhile, that the
United States will not tolerate any future delays in the
release of American war prisoners in South Vietnam.
20 More POWs Released
CLARK AIR BASE, Philippines — The second large group
of released American war prisoners left the Philippines for
home this morning, just a day after they had wandered
through a U.S.-style supermarket like so many Rip Van
Winkles returned from captivity instead of sleep.
The 20 men, smiling and waving, boarded a Cl4l
Starlifter hospital plane and took off on the 15-hour
journey to Travis Air Base in California.
Twenty other former POWs left for Travis yesterday,
and two went home earlier because of family illnesses.
Another group of 20 men was scheduled to depart later
today.
Anti-hijacking Pact To Be Signed
WASHINGTON — The United States and Cuba will sign
an antihijacking agreement at 8:30 a.m. PST today, U.S.
officials say.
Secretary of State William P. Rogers will sign the
agreement at the State Department, while a Cuban official
will initial the accord simultaneously in Havana.
U.S. officials said the agreement is very satisfactory
and will serve as both a real and a psychological deterrent
to hijacking.
As outlined by these officials, Cuba and the United
States will agree to either extradite or prosecute persons
guilty of hijacking airplanes or ships.
However, the agreement does not affect the traditional
American position concerning acceptance of refugees
from the Caribbean island. This means that a Cuban who
may violate a Cuban law in escaping to the United States
but does not endanger either the crew or passengers of a
ship or aircraft would not be liable for extradition.
Such a refugee would be liable to prosecution under
existing American laws, which could lead to charges of
illegal entry. The American official said the agreement
pledges the United States to enforce such laws, including
the neutrality acts that prohibit use of American soil or
property for attacks on other nations.
Ellsberg Loses Legal Battle
LOS ANGELES — The government in the Pentagon
Papers trial won a legal battle yesterday to show jurors
two security manuals which were described in court as
"critical" evidence against Daniel Ellsberg and Anthony
Russo.
However, U.S. District Court Judge Matt Byrne said he
would rule later on which sections of the rule books may
be shown to jurors.
The government has indicated it will try to show jurors
that Ellsberg and Russo read the manuals but knowingly
violated the rules by taking and copying classified
documents — the Pentagon Papers.
Defense attorneys had argued against use of the
manuals for three days, saying the government hadn't
proven that the manuals in any way related to the
Pentagon's top-secret study of the Vietnam War.
The judge said that would be a matter of jurors to
decide.

Pressure On Dollar Continues
LONDON — A selling wave hit the devalued dollar after
world money markets reopened yesterday, sending the
American currency lower than first expected. The
continued monetary uncertainty lifted the price of gold to
new all-time highs.
"Nobody wants to hold dollars yet," a London foreign
exchange dealer explained.
Even Brazil, in a rare show of economic independence,
raised the dollar value of the cruzeiro by about 3 percent.
This means Americans will probably pay a bit more for
their coffee at home, just as they will be paying more for
foreign vacations and imported goods.
Banking and other financial sources in Europe
conceded that the continued pressure on the dollar was
making money markets nervous. But they cautioned it
was too early to tell whether this meant the dollar
devaluation would fail to halt the international monetary
crisis of the past two weeks.
Most of the world's leading money markets were open
yesterday for the first time since the dollar devaluation
Monday night. But those who had bet billions on a dollar
devaluation did not move to take their profits
immediately.
The unsettled exchange rates appeared to be a factor in
a big drop in New York stock market prices. After initial
enthusiasm in the wake of devaluation Tuesday, the
market turned around and continued lower yesterday.
Vietnam Aid Commission Formed
WASHINGTON — Hanoi and Washington announced
agreement yesterday on creating a joint economic
commission that will help map out dollar aid to rebuild
war-battered North Vietnam.
The disclosure came in a joint communique outlining
nearly four days of recent talks in Hanoi by Henry A.
Kissinger, President Nixon's chief foreign policy aide.
Ronald L. Ziegler, White House press secretary, said
Kissinger and North Vietnamese officials did not discuss
the scope of potential U.S. reconstruction assistance.
Predicting the joint commission would be set up in
about a month, Ziegler said any dollar figures would first
be discussed in that forum, and would be subject to
further consultation with Congress.
The 700-word communique expressed hope the
Kissinger visit "will mark the beginning of new bilateral
relations."
It also spoke of "imperative measures" necessary to
carry out the Vietnam peace accord signed in Paris on Jan.
27. It did not elaborate.
Ziegler said in response to questions that one such item
on which Kissinger w* the North Vietnamese agreed was
the need tc « for trying to trace Americans
still listed as missing in action in Indochina.
The communique said Kissinger and Hanoi officials
"also agreed they would continue to have periodic
exchanges of views" with the aim of making sure the Paris
accords "are strictlyand scrupulously implemented."
Kissinger was en route to Peking via Hong Kong and

existing American laws, which could lead to charges of
illegal entry. The American official said the agreement
pledges the United States to enforce such laws, including
the neutrality acts that prohibit use of American soil or
property for attacks on other nations.
Ellsberg Loses Legal Battle
LOS ANGELES — The government in the Pentagon
Papers trial won a legal battle yesterday to show jurors
two security manuals which were described in court as
"critical" evidence against Daniel Ellsberg and Anthony
Russo.
However, U.S. District Court Judge Matt Byrne said he
would rule later on which sections of the rule books may
be shown to jurors.
The government has indicated it will try to show jurors
that Ellsberg and Russo read the manuals but knowingly
violated the rules by taking and copying classified
documents — the Pentagon Papers.
Defense attorneys had argued against use of the
manuals for three days, saying the government hadn't
proven that the manuals in any way related to the
Pentagon's top-secret study of the Vietnam War.
The judge said that would be a matter of jurors to
decide.
Fair Weather, Friends
Mostly fair today through tomorrow. Low tonight in the
40s. Highs today and tomorrow in mid 50s to low 60s.
West to northwest wind 10 to 20 mph.
Pressure On Dollar Continues
LONDON — A selling wave hit the devalued dollar after
world money markets reopened yesterday, sending the
American currency lower than first expected. The
continued monetary uncertainty lifted the price of gold to
new all-time highs.
"Nobody wants to hold dollars yet," a London foreign
exchange dealer explained.
Even Brazil, in a rare show of economic independence,
raised the dollar value of the cruzeiro by about 3 percent.
This means Americans will probably pay a bit more for
their coffee at home, just as they will be paying more for
foreign vacations and imported goods.
Banking and other financial sources in Europe
conceded that the continued pressure on the dollar was
making money markets nervous. But they cautioned it
was too early to tell whether this meant the dollar
devaluation would fail to halt the international monetary
crisis of the past two weeks.
Most of the world's leading money markets were open
yesterday for the first time since the dollar devaluation
Monday night. But those who had bet billions on a dollar
devaluation did not move to take their profits
immediately.
The unsettled exchange rates appeared to be a factor in
a big drop in New York stock market prices. After initial
enthusiasm in the wake of devaluation Tuesday, the
market turned around and continued lower yesterday.
Vietnam Aid Commission Formed
WASHINGTON — Hanoi and Washington announced
agreement yesterday on creating a joint economic
commission that will help map out dollar aid to rebuild
war-battered North Vietnam.
The disclosure came in a joint communique outlining
nearly four days of recent talks in Hanoi by Henry A.
Kissinger, President Nixon's chief foreign policy aide.
Ronald L. Ziegler, White House press secretary, said
Kissinger and North Vietnamese officials did not discuss
the scope of potential U.S. reconstruction assistance.
Predicting the joint commission would be set up in
about a month, Ziegler said any dollar figures would first
be discussed in that forum, and would be subject to
further consultation with Congress.
The 700-word communique expressed hope the
Kissinger visit "will mark the beginning of new bilateral
relations."
It also spoke of "imperative measures" necessary to
carry out the Vietnam peace accord signed in Paris on Jan.
27. It did not elaborate.
Ziegler said in response to questions that one such item
on which Kissinger w* the North Vietnamese agreed was
the need tc « for trying to trace Americans
still listed as missing in action in Indochina.
The communique said Kissinger and Hanoi officials
"also agreed they would continue to have periodic
exchanges of views" with the aim of making sure the Paris
accords "are strictlyand scrupulously implemented."
Kissinger was en route to Peking via Hong Kong and
will leave there next Monday, making an overnight stop in
Tokyo before returning to Washington the next day.
Cease-Fire Stabilization Sought
SAIGON — A top-level State Department official joined
yesterday in efforts to stabilize the Vietnam cease-fire
that in 18 days has been riddled by violations.
At the intervention of Deputy Asst. Secretary of State
William H. Sullivan, the four-party Joint Military
Commission agreed to do something about trying to stop

the shooting in which Saigon has reported more than
13,000 Vietnamese casualties.
The senior American military representative to the
commission warned the Viet Cong meanwhile, that the
United States will not tolerate any future delays in the
release of American war prisoners in South Vietnam.
20 More POWs Released
CLARK AIR BASE, Philippines — The second large group
of released American war prisoners left the Philippines for
home this morning, just a day after they had wandered
through a U.S.-style supermarket like so many Rip Van
Winkles returned from captivity instead of sleep.
The 20 men, smiling and waving, boarded a Cl4l
Starlifter hospital plane and took off on the 15-hour
journey to Travis Air Base in California.
Twenty other former POWs left for Travis yesterday,
and two went home earlier because of family illnesses.
Another group of 20 men was scheduled to depart later
today.
Anti-hijacking Pact To Be Signed
WASHINGTON — The United States and Cuba will sign
an antihijacking agreement at 8:30 a.m. PST today, U.S.
officials say.
Secretary of State William P. Rogers will sign the
agreement at the State Department, while a Cuban official
will initial the accord simultaneously in Havana.
U.S. officials said the agreement is very satisfactory
and will serve as both a real and a psychological deterrent
to hijacking.
As outlined by these officials, Cuba and the United
States will agree to either extradite or prosecute persons
guilty of hijacking airplanes or ships.
However, the agreement does not affect the traditional
American position concerning acceptance of refugees
from the Caribbean island. This means that a Cuban who
may violate a Cuban law in escaping to the United States
but does not endanger either the crew or passengers of a
ship or aircraft would not be liable for extradition.
Such a refugee would be liable to prosecution under
existing American laws, which could lead to charges of
illegal entry. The American official said the agreement
pledges the United States to enforce such laws, including
the neutrality acts that prohibit use of American soil or
property for attacks on other nations.
