# Campus Crime Rate Decreases
## 
### CHESS ERWIN 
The incidence of serious crime on
campus has "leveled off' following
sharp increases the past three years,
according to Capt. William
Wullschleger of the Stanford
Department of Public Safety. For the
year ending last August, the number of
thefts, the largest category of crime,
decreased 30 percent from 1971.
The primary reason for the large
jump in reported crimes in the late
1960's was the tremendous increase in
the number of bicycle thefts on
campus, says Wullschleger.
This increase in bicycle thefts has
been countered, he adds, as a result of
the department's program of licensing
and registration.
Thefts and burglaries comprise the
vast majority of the crimes reported.
Together, they have accounted for
about 85 percent of the department's
workload during the past three years.

Besides bikes, most of the thefts
involve personal items that are easily
moved, such as stereos, typewriters,
and radios. Academic buildings and
autos have also been principal targets.
Serious crimes such as assault and
rape have declined, according to
Wullschleger. He attributed this to a
University campaign to safeguard
students by installing new lighting
systems and increasing the number of
night patrols on campus.
Scheduling of personnel at the
Public Safety department is such that
most of the staff is on duty at night
while those on day duty are primarily
concerned with traffic enforcement.
Most of the crimes reported to the
campus security office — as well as
most of those crimes investigated by
the Santa Clara County Sheriffs
department — are committed by
people not affiliated with the
University community.

With completion of the Stanford
security reorganization initiated a year
and a half ago still not in sight,
Wullschleger says that although the
department has hired a number of
officers, the number of personnel on
the force has decreased through
attrition and budgetary problems.
When the reorganization is completed,
the number of officers will increase
from the present 43 to about 60.
In the meantime, Wullschleger says
one of the best ways to protect a
person's belongings is to take
advantage of the engraving system
available at the Stanford Security
Office.
The engraver stamps the owner's
drivers license or social security
number on his belongings. Widespread
use of this system will aid in the
recovery and return of lost or stolen
articles, says Wullschleger.

workload during the past three years.

Besides bikes, most of the thefts
involve personal items that are easily
moved, such as stereos, typewriters,
and radios. Academic buildings and
autos have also been principal targets.
Serious crimes such as assault and
rape have declined, according to
Wullschleger. He attributed this to a
University campaign to safeguard
students by installing new lighting
systems and increasing the number of
night patrols on campus.
Scheduling of personnel at the
Public Safety department is such that
most of the staff is on duty at night
while those on day duty are primarily
concerned with traffic enforcement.
Most of the crimes reported to the
campus security office — as well as
most of those crimes investigated by
the Santa Clara County Sheriffs
department — are committed by
people not affiliated with the
University community.

With completion of the Stanford
security reorganization initiated a year
and a half ago still not in sight,
Wullschleger says that although the
department has hired a number of
officers, the number of personnel on
the force has decreased through
attrition and budgetary problems.
When the reorganization is completed,
the number of officers will increase
from the present 43 to about 60.
In the meantime, Wullschleger says
one of the best ways to protect a
person's belongings is to take
advantage of the engraving system
available at the Stanford Security
Office.
The engraver stamps the owner's
drivers license or social security
number on his belongings. Widespread
use of this system will aid in the
recovery and return of lost or stolen
articles, says Wullschleger.
