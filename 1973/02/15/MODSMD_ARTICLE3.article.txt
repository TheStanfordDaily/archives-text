# Fund-Seeking Groups To Man ASSU Vote
## 
### 
The ASSU Senate voted Tuesday to
hold a special fee assessment election
that will be partially paid for by the
two groups requesting assessments,
Citizens Advocates at Stanford, Inc.
and the Debate Union.
Sara Moore, ASSU Financial
Manager, was the only person present
at the meeting who voiced concern
over setting the precedent of allowing
groups to "buy" elections.
Senate Chairman Rocky Barber
admitted that allowing the two groups
to provide volunteers and pay for part
of the election could set a dangerous
precedent, but thought that it
probably would not. He said that the
ASSU Senate would never allow a
group to use the Senate's name as a
sponsor (as in an election), without
retaining some control over the
situation.
John Bradley, a member of the
Board of Directors of Citizens
Advocates, said, "We felt that the

referendum couldn't be held up until
the (regularly scheduled) April
election. We felt that if we offered
support, there would be no objection
to a referendum this quarter.
Our only purpose in suggesting that
we pay for the election was to assure
an election this quarter."
Because the Debate Union also
requested that their fee assessment
appear on the ballot, they will also
provide volunteers and help pay for
the election.
Neither Bradley nor John
Dickerson, a spokesman for the
Debate Union, were able to say
exactly how much their organizations
would be contributing toward the
election. Both agreed that they will
have to discuss arrangements with
Moore.
Citizens Advocates and the Debate
Union can have one volunteer worker
per polling place. There must be at
least one neutral worker at each voting
table.
