# Drug Abuse Board Grapples With Troubles
## 
### ED MATHENY 
Starting a drug therapy center is
not a simple job.
The members of the Palo Alto
Community Drug Abuse Board
(PACDAB) have learned this. Last
October they received funding from
the City Council for a residential
treatment center at 851 University
Ave. The center is designed to handle
15 patients, mostly heroin addicts.
Obtaining funds did not solve all
the Board's problems. They also have
had to grapple with the fact that many
of the residents surrounding 851
University Ave. aren't too happy
about having the center in their
neighborhood.
Jane Hiatt, a staff member of the

Collective, a drug treatment center
operated by PACDAB at 418 Ramona
St., explains that the surrounding
residents are mainly elderly people
"who are scared to death of heroin
addicts."
Hiatt says that the Board members
have tried a variety of means to
communicate with these people and
show them that the center is really no
danger to them. They have had coffees
in the neighborhood and community
forums, but, she concluded, the
nearby residents still don't understand
heroin addicts.

"They think they will hear
screaming from the house," she said.
But she adds, "It's not their fault —
they just believe what the movies tell
them."
Hiatt believes that these fears will
be alleviated when the center goes into
operation and the neighbors find out
that the stories about screaming
patients aren't true. She said, the
center "won't live up to their
expectations."
Criticism from future neighbors is
not the only difficulty that the Board
faces. There is also internal dissention
among the members themselves.
This problem has arisen from the
philosophical and political
considerations imposed on the hiring
of a staff to run the center. The board
originally appointed a seven-man
hiring committee to seek out
promising applicants.
Committee Split
Soon the committee was split on
the hiring criteria. Members Molly
Fox, Ed Dubos, and Kari Collins urged
hiring personnel with "third world
consciousness." Joel Davidson and Phil
Bliss favored only general
qualifications. Heated discussions and
name-calling ensued. Eventually
Davidson and Bliss resigned from the
committee.
The Board then revamped the
committee, adding five new people.
The ten committee members then split
up into five groups of two to interview
applicants for the job.
This small-group configuration was
added to enhance the selection
process. The Board hopes for a
balanced staff, as each of the groups is
seeking different qualities in their
applicants.
Balanced Staff
When selected, the staff will consist
of four men and four women; four
ex-addicts and four who are not; four
whites and four non-whites. Of the
non-whites, one is to be black, one is
to be Asian, one is to be Chicano, and

the fourth is not specified.
There have been about 200
applicants for the eight positions. Most
of whom have been white. Committee
member Molly Fox explains that
"many third world people did not
apply because they thought a white
drug center would not be serious
about hiring third world people."
But the committee claims it is
indeed serious about meeting the
needs of the third world community.
They are also set on meeting as best
they can the needs of the addicts
themselves. Toward this end, they are
looking for people who understand
drugs — where they come from, why
they are used, and the social
conditions that make them necessary
to the addict.
On Feb. 7, the hiring committee
submitted to the Board the names of
five people they felt qualified to work
at the center. With this submission,
new problems arose.
The board rejected the names
because the hiring committee had not

designated which of the people
recommended would serve as the
coordinator for the project. The
members of the committee did not
designate a coordinator because they
felt that this decision should be left to
the new staff members.
Salary Disagreement
Another disagreement concerned
the salary of the coordinator. The
by-laws of the center state that the
coordinator will draw extra pay, a
stipulation which many committee
members feel is unjust. There was also
debate on the possible phasing out of
the position of coordinator: should it
be done, and if so, how soon?
Later at the Feb. 7 meeting, it was
suggested that these items be
temporarily shelved, and that the five
applicants be approved pending a
future selection of a coordinator by
the hiring committee.
This was done, and the project
continued to roll. The other three
recommendations are expected to be
submitted soon, and the center will
come that much closer to operation.

be done, and if so, how soon?
Later at the Feb. 7 meeting, it was
suggested that these items be
temporarily shelved, and that the five
applicants be approved pending a
future selection of a coordinator by
the hiring committee.
This was done, and the project
continued to roll. The other three
recommendations are expected to be
submitted soon, and the center will
come that much closer to operation.
Starting a drug therapy center is
not a simple job.
The members of the Palo Alto
Community Drug Abuse Board
(PACDAB) have learned this. Last
October they received funding from
the City Council for a residential
treatment center at 851 University
Ave. The center is designed to handle
15 patients, mostly heroin addicts.
Obtaining funds did not solve all
the Board's problems. They also have
had to grapple with the fact that many
of the residents surrounding 851
University Ave. aren't too happy
about having the center in their
neighborhood.
Jane Hiatt, a staff member of the

Collective, a drug treatment center
operated by PACDAB at 418 Ramona
St., explains that the surrounding
residents are mainly elderly people
"who are scared to death of heroin
addicts."
Hiatt says that the Board members
have tried a variety of means to
communicate with these people and
show them that the center is really no
danger to them. They have had coffees
in the neighborhood and community
forums, but, she concluded, the
nearby residents still don't understand
heroin addicts.
Believe Movies
"They think they will hear
screaming from the house," she said.
But she adds, "It's not their fault —
they just believe what the movies tell
them."
Hiatt believes that these fears will
be alleviated when the center goes into
operation and the neighbors find out
that the stories about screaming
patients aren't true. She said, the
center "won't live up to their
expectations."
Criticism from future neighbors is
not the only difficulty that the Board
faces. There is also internal dissention
among the members themselves.
This problem has arisen from the
philosophical and political
considerations imposed on the hiring
of a staff to run the center. The board
originally appointed a seven-man
hiring committee to seek out
promising applicants.
Committee Split
Soon the committee was split on
the hiring criteria. Members Molly
Fox, Ed Dubos, and Kari Collins urged
hiring personnel with "third world
consciousness." Joel Davidson and Phil
Bliss favored only general
qualifications. Heated discussions and
name-calling ensued. Eventually
Davidson and Bliss resigned from the
committee.
The Board then revamped the
committee, adding five new people.
The ten committee members then split
up into five groups of two to interview
applicants for the job.
This small-group configuration was
added to enhance the selection
process. The Board hopes for a
balanced staff, as each of the groups is
seeking different qualities in their
applicants.
Balanced Staff
When selected, the staff will consist
of four men and four women; four
ex-addicts and four who are not; four
whites and four non-whites. Of the
non-whites, one is to be black, one is
to be Asian, one is to be Chicano, and

the fourth is not specified.
There have been about 200
applicants for the eight positions. Most
of whom have been white. Committee
member Molly Fox explains that
"many third world people did not
apply because they thought a white
drug center would not be serious
about hiring third world people."
But the committee claims it is
indeed serious about meeting the
needs of the third world community.
They are also set on meeting as best
they can the needs of the addicts
themselves. Toward this end, they are
looking for people who understand
drugs — where they come from, why
they are used, and the social
conditions that make them necessary
to the addict.
On Feb. 7, the hiring committee
submitted to the Board the names of
five people they felt qualified to work
at the center. With this submission,
new problems arose.
The board rejected the names
because the hiring committee had not

designated which of the people
recommended would serve as the
coordinator for the project. The
members of the committee did not
designate a coordinator because they
felt that this decision should be left to
the new staff members.
Salary Disagreement
Another disagreement concerned
the salary of the coordinator. The
by-laws of the center state that the
coordinator will draw extra pay, a
stipulation which many committee
members feel is unjust. There was also
debate on the possible phasing out of
the position of coordinator: should it
be done, and if so, how soon?

designate a coordinator because they
felt that this decision should be left to
the new staff members.
Salary Disagreement
Another disagreement concerned
the salary of the coordinator. The
by-laws of the center state that the
coordinator will draw extra pay, a
stipulation which many committee
members feel is unjust. There was also
debate on the possible phasing out of
the position of coordinator: should it
be done, and if so, how soon?
Later at the Feb. 7 meeting, it was
suggested that these items be
temporarily shelved, and that the five
applicants be approved pending a
future selection of a coordinator by
the hiring committee.
This was done, and the project
continued to roll. The other three
recommendations are expected to be
submitted soon, and the center will
come that much closer to operation.
