# Seven Attend Franklin, Rommo Speech
## Vet Praises N. Vietnamese 
### KATHY ALCALA DON TOLLEFSON 
Barry Rommo, a member of
Vietnam Veterans Against the War
who accompanied Joan Baez to Hanoi
in December, said last night "what
really stuck out in my mind was the
courage, energy, kindness and love of

the Vietnamese people."
Rommo and fired English Prof.
Bruce Franklin spoke in Columbae
House before a sparse audience of
seven people. Rommo said that in
North Vietnam, "the people run their
own government. They actually
control their own lives."

In contrast, he characterized South
Vietnam as a "cheap carbon copy of
American culture and American
economy."
The former Army lieutenant said
that charges that the American group
was given a "guided tour" of Hanoi
were "bullshit." He claimed he was
able to travel freely throughout Hanoi.
He said the North Vietnamese were
hostile only towards the American
government. "They knew we were
Americans and they came up to us and
shook our hands and thanked us for
being there."
Bombing Not Accidental
Rommo claimed that the American
bombing of civilian targets was not
done by accident. "You don't rebomb
an area three or four times — that's
not a mistake." He said the North
Vietnamese were "brave enough to
stand in the street and shoot at
Phantoms."
Rommo claimed that President
Nixon was forced to stop the bombing
because the North Vietnamese were
shooting down so many American
planes.
He said the cease-fire "certainly
wasn't the end of the war, but it was a
victory along the way. I think the
Vietnamese are going to settle their
problems and, having faith in the
Vietnamese, I believe Vietnam will be
reunited."
Rommo added that Americans
"aren't recognizing the fact that the
United States is keeping 10,000
soldiers in South Vietnam under the
guise of 'advisors.' They are West
Pointers who are taking the uniforms
off and putting ties on."
Franklin Speech
Franklin spoke very briefly and
echoed Rommo's conclusions.
"Because everybody thinks it's over,
nobody wants to hear it isn't. ..
"The war being waged by this
empire is not only against countries
overseas, but also against oppressed
nations here at home, especially the

black nation and the Chicano nation,"
said Franklin.
Franklin denied that the
"movement" has ended. "There has
been a real shift away from a white
campus movement to the most
oppressed communities.
Needs Leadership
"I don't think the campus
movement is going to get back to the
mass character it had before until
there is leadership from one or more
of the oppressed peoples or nations in

this country or overseas," Franklin
said.
Franklin, a .member of the
Venceremos Central Committee,
added that "making a multi-national
revolutionary organization work is no
easy matter.
"At Stanford there are
undoubtedly many people with
anti-imperialist consciousness .. . but
most people don't see at this point
what the hell they can do about it that
is practical and can change reality."

reunited."
Rommo added that Americans
"aren't recognizing the fact that the
United States is keeping 10,000
soldiers in South Vietnam under the
guise of 'advisors.' They are West
Pointers who are taking the uniforms
off and putting ties on."
Franklin Speech
Franklin spoke very briefly and
echoed Rommo's conclusions.
"Because everybody thinks it's over,
nobody wants to hear it isn't. ..
"The war being waged by this
empire is not only against countries
overseas, but also against oppressed
nations here at home, especially the

black nation and the Chicano nation,"
said Franklin.
Franklin denied that the
"movement" has ended. "There has
been a real shift away from a white
campus movement to the most
oppressed communities.
Needs Leadership
"I don't think the campus
movement is going to get back to the
mass character it had before until
there is leadership from one or more
of the oppressed peoples or nations in

this country or overseas," Franklin
said.
Franklin, a .member of the
Venceremos Central Committee,
added that "making a multi-national
revolutionary organization work is no
easy matter.
"At Stanford there are
undoubtedly many people with
anti-imperialist consciousness .. . but
most people don't see at this point
what the hell they can do about it that
is practical and can change reality."

FIRST-HAND EXPERIENCE — Veteran Against the War Barry Rommo (left) related his experiences with Joan Baez in
North Vietnam to a gathering of seven students at Columbae House last night. His opinions on the role of the United
States in post cease-fire Indochina were echoed by former English Professor H. Bruce Franklin, who also spoke briefly.
Barry Rommo, a member of
Vietnam Veterans Against the War
who accompanied Joan Baez to Hanoi
in December, said last night "what
really stuck out in my mind was the
courage, energy, kindness and love of

the Vietnamese people."
Rommo and fired English Prof.
Bruce Franklin spoke in Columbae
House before a sparse audience of
seven people. Rommo said that in
North Vietnam, "the people run their
own government. They actually
control their own lives."

In contrast, he characterized South
Vietnam as a "cheap carbon copy of
American culture and American
economy."
The former Army lieutenant said
that charges that the American group
was given a "guided tour" of Hanoi
were "bullshit." He claimed he was
able to travel freely throughout Hanoi.
He said the North Vietnamese were
hostile only towards the American
government. "They knew we were
Americans and they came up to us and
shook our hands and thanked us for
being there."
Bombing Not Accidental
Rommo claimed that the American
bombing of civilian targets was not
done by accident. "You don't rebomb
an area three or four times — that's
not a mistake." He said the North
Vietnamese were "brave enough to
stand in the street and shoot at
Phantoms."
Rommo claimed that President
Nixon was forced to stop the bombing
because the North Vietnamese were
shooting down so many American
planes.
He said the cease-fire "certainly
wasn't the end of the war, but it was a
victory along the way. I think the
Vietnamese are going to settle their
problems and, having faith in the
Vietnamese, I believe Vietnam will be
reunited."
Rommo added that Americans
"aren't recognizing the fact that the
United States is keeping 10,000
soldiers in South Vietnam under the
guise of 'advisors.' They are West
Pointers who are taking the uniforms
