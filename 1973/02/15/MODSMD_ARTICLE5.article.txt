Barry Rommo, a member of
Vietnam Veterans Against the War

the Vietnamese people."
Rommo and fired English Prof.

an area three or four times — that's
not a mistake." He said the North
Vietnamese were "brave enough to

because the North Vietnamese were
shooting down so many American
planes.
He said the cease-fire "certainly
wasn't the end of the war, but it was a
victory along the way. I think the
Vietnamese are going to settle their
problems and, having faith in the
Vietnamese, I believe Vietnam will be
reunited."
Rommo added that Americans
"aren't recognizing the fact that the
United States is keeping 10,000
soldiers in South Vietnam under the
