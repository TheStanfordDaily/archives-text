## 
### 
From The Associated Press
LONDON — Electrical Engineering Prof. William B.
Shockley said yesterday he is being denied an honorary
degree from the University of Leeds because of his
controversial views on race and intelligence.
Shockley, in London to mark the 25th anniversary of
his invention of the transistor, said he was to have
received an honorary doctor of sciences degree from the
university in May.
However, he said he was notified on Tuesday — his
63rd birthday — by Lord Boyle, the university vice
chancellor, that the degree would not be conferred.
"It was a birthday present in reverse," Shockley said.
"When Lord Boyle spoke to me I asked him: 'Would you
like me to forget the whole thing?' He replied: 'Yes, we
would like you to forget the whole thing.' "
University of Leeds spokesmen were unavailable for
comment.
Shockley, winner of the 1956 Nobel Prize for physics,
has stated he believes that blacks are genetically inferior
to whites in terms of intelligence.
He has been a target of several disruptions both on and
off campus. A scheduled lecture Jan. 25 before the
Cornell Club of Northern California in San Francisco was
cancelled after the Students for a Democratic Society
announced plans to protest Shockley's appearance.
On Jan. 23, Shockley debated his theories with
Genetics Prof. Luigi L. Cavalli-Sforza and Asst.
Psychology- Profs. Cedric X and D.P. McGee before an
overflow audience of 1800 people in Memorial
Auditorium.
Asked for his reaction to the Leeds decision not to
award him an honorary degree, Shockley said, "If life
gives you a lemon — make lemonade."
