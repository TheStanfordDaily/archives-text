# 'Academic Exploitation'
## Research Harmful To Barrios 
### 
MEChA

What makes attitude and behavior change unethical? Isn't
brainwashing synonymous with a totalitarian state?
These questions are creating controversy in the School of Medicine
and the Department of Communication. Currently, they are engaged
in a joint research project (Project SCOR) which MEChA perceives is
harmful to our barrios. Under the guidance of an inter-disciplinary
research team, a ten month media campaign in three highly populated
Chicano barrios (Tracy, Gilroy, and Watsonville) will aim at changing
four causes related to heart disease: diet, smoking, body weight, and
physical activity.
In a letter to faculty and students, Chicano communication
graduate students are contending that both the practice and research
is an infringement on individual freedom and has the potential for
abuse. The letter also points out that at a time when the health
problems for the Chicano community are coming to greater attention,
it is unfortunate that research projects such as SCOR fail to define
the causes and correct treatment for the barrio health problems.
Supposed Benefits
SCOR will supposedly benefit those barrios because its research
will help reduce heart disease among Chicanos. But it would seem
strange not to include poverty, lack of medical care, gruelling physical
work (stoop farm labor), and the anxiety and stress associated with
these living conditions as the major factors leading to Chicano health
problems.
The researchers believe: If their efforts to change people's behavior
are illegitimate, then by what means will they institute preventive
health practices, improve automobile safety, move people from
private cars to mass transit systems, increase public support for
schools, etc? ("We're not advocating that people make massive
changes in their lifestyle, just small but significant ones," said Dr.
Henry Breitrose, associate professor of Communications and a
member of the research team.)
MEChA asks, "Who are they to decide what are small changes for
Chicanos? Do they think Chicanos should stop eating tortillas or do
calisthenics before picking grapes for ten hours?" MEChA does not
disagree that heart illness among Chicanos should and can be
prevented. However, this project's main intention is to formulate a
more precise model for changing behavior thorugh campaigns in
controlled mass media.
Academic Exploitation
Chicanos, like other minority communities, have been subjected to

VD experiments, used as birth-control guinea pigs, and have only
realized the importance of these experiments after they have suffered
through them. MEChA wants to expose this project to the community
and prevent more of this academic exploitation.
At present, Chicano graduate students in Medicine and
Communications are negotiating with the research team in an attempt
to dissolve completely the Chicano component of the project. MEChA
agrees, since the negative implications of this type of research are not
only detrimental to the bay area Chicanos but to Raza throughout the
Southwest.

What makes attitude and behavior change unethical? Isn't
brainwashing synonymous with a totalitarian state?
These questions are creating controversy in the School of Medicine
and the Department of Communication. Currently, they are engaged
in a joint research project (Project SCOR) which MEChA perceives is
harmful to our barrios. Under the guidance of an inter-disciplinary
research team, a ten month media campaign in three highly populated
Chicano barrios (Tracy, Gilroy, and Watsonville) will aim at changing
four causes related to heart disease: diet, smoking, body weight, and
physical activity.
In a letter to faculty and students, Chicano communication
graduate students are contending that both the practice and research
is an infringement on individual freedom and has the potential for
abuse. The letter also points out that at a time when the health
problems for the Chicano community are coming to greater attention,
it is unfortunate that research projects such as SCOR fail to define
the causes and correct treatment for the barrio health problems.
Supposed Benefits
SCOR will supposedly benefit those barrios because its research
will help reduce heart disease among Chicanos. But it would seem
strange not to include poverty, lack of medical care, gruelling physical
work (stoop farm labor), and the anxiety and stress associated with
these living conditions as the major factors leading to Chicano health
problems.
The researchers believe: If their efforts to change people's behavior
are illegitimate, then by what means will they institute preventive
health practices, improve automobile safety, move people from
private cars to mass transit systems, increase public support for
schools, etc? ("We're not advocating that people make massive
changes in their lifestyle, just small but significant ones," said Dr.
Henry Breitrose, associate professor of Communications and a
member of the research team.)
MEChA asks, "Who are they to decide what are small changes for
Chicanos? Do they think Chicanos should stop eating tortillas or do
calisthenics before picking grapes for ten hours?" MEChA does not
disagree that heart illness among Chicanos should and can be
prevented. However, this project's main intention is to formulate a
more precise model for changing behavior thorugh campaigns in
controlled mass media.
Academic Exploitation
Chicanos, like other minority communities, have been subjected to

VD experiments, used as birth-control guinea pigs, and have only
realized the importance of these experiments after they have suffered
through them. MEChA wants to expose this project to the community
and prevent more of this academic exploitation.
At present, Chicano graduate students in Medicine and
Communications are negotiating with the research team in an attempt
to dissolve completely the Chicano component of the project. MEChA
agrees, since the negative implications of this type of research are not
only detrimental to the bay area Chicanos but to Raza throughout the
Southwest.
