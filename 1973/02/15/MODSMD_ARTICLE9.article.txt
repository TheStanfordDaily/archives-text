## On Civil Liberties

How much secret
eavesdropping goes on in America
today? Have you ever been talking
with someone on the phone and
suddenly felt that perhaps certain
topics should not be discussed,
just on the chance that "someone
was listening?" Into how many
different files has your life and
activities been entered?
The Nixon Administration is
exacerbating some serious
domestic issues, one of which is
the encroachment by government
and industry upon the privileges
accorded citizens by the Bill of
Rights. On July 1, 1972 your
bank began photostating and
storing copies of every check you
write—without your knowledge or
permission—as part of a new
Federal policy.
A Los Angeles man arrested by
mistake was denied a job because
his arrest record continued to be
circulated.
The number and interchange of

personal files between government
and commercial agencies
multiplies by leaps and bounds.
And we find that not even a
Presidential candidate is safe from
having his activities eavesdropped
upon and undermined.
Incursions
The Jan. issue of Civil
Liberties, the newsletter of the
American Civil Liberties Union,
contains a brief review of some of
the basic incursions upon civil
liberties in this country. For
example, former Cleveland Mayor
Carl Stokes had his offices'
phones tapped by the Cleveland
police department. Important
meetings were held by utilizing
rooms at different hotels, rooms
obtained just prior to the time of
the meeting, in an effort to
prevent the police from listening
in.
Senator Sam Ervin has
expressed doubts about the
Army's suspension of its civilian

surveillances, surveillances which
have even taken the form of
secretly spying on citizens at
completely lawful anti-war or
pro-ecology demonstrations.
The Electronic Industries
Association estimates that the
annual market in law enforcement
electronics will soon approach
$400 million per year.
Gossip-Mongeri ng
A computer system known as
"Lencir" (Law Enforcement
Network Central lowa Region)
now has on file some 800 to 900
people under the category of
"known criminals," although none
of them has been convicted of
anything in any court of law. This
kind of automated
gossip-mongering should clearly
be eliminated, yet it does not
seem that many voices are being
raised against these or any of the
other numerous violations of our
basic rights.
Many of us have become
accustomed to assuming that we
are overheard periodically.
Whether conditioning is to a real
or a fancied omnipresence of the
government's ear, it's quite clear
that this feeling could gradually
inhibit the timid (and the
not-so-timid) from fully exercising
their rights. Moreover, with
growing acceptance of police
espionage as a fact of life, law
enforcement authorities are
themselves conditioned to engage in
further incursions into the Bill of
Rights.
If things are so bad that the
Mayor of Cleveland is forced to
scurry around his own city so as
to meet in privacy, it's really no
wonder that a growing number of
us are becoming accustomed to
our secret police. At what point
does this custom become so
deeply ingrained that those
growing up under it just assume
it's always been that way -except
for what's said in dim and distant
history books?
