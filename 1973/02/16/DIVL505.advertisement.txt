speakers! Bring them to the Cal Hi Fi/E.P.I,
Speaker Clinic near you this week where their
performance will be graphed for you. It's
informative. It's valuable.- And it's absolutely
free.
How close do your speakers
come to the ideal?
No speaker is perfect. To be so, it would have
to radiate all frequencies in all directions
equally, without any distortion. Just the reverse
of how recording microphones 'heard' the
music to begin with. E.P.I, engineers will be
testing your speakers for these qualities: How
smooth is their response? How is their sound
dispersed into your room? How low is their -
distortion? Facts that can help you get greater
enjoyment from your system. You'll also see
how your speakers' impedance changes (and
thus how your speaker relates to your
amplifier).
You don't have to be
an audiophile!
Clinics sound technical. They're not. We want
to see a lot of you music-lovers, because you
are the people we serve. So do come in. Bring
your speakers. Compare the graphs of others. It
will be time well spent, particularly in helping
you chart the future course of your system.
