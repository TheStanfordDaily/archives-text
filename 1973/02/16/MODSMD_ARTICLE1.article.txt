# Air Force Academy Program
## Cadets Describe POW Training 
### 
Editor's note: The excellent condition of most of the American prisoners of
war released this week was surprising to many observers who remembered the
fate of this country's POW's in Korea.
This apparently remarkable ability of this war's Air Force pilots to endure
years of POW existence without cracking may be due in large part to an
extraordinary, but virtually unknown POW camp training procedure which all
Air Force pilots since the Korean war have been required to undergo prior to
combat duty.
The following interviews describe the sometimes unbelievable physical and
mental tortures which have become standard techniques at such a training
experience at the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs. The simulated POW
camp program at the academy began in 1967 and was modeled after the original
program which still exists at Fairchild Air Force Base. That program, along with
the Air Force Fighting Man's Code of Conduct, was created by the Eisenhower
administration in response to the American POW experience in Korea.
The material presented here was gathered by Daily reporter Bob Litterman
while researching a story on the military academies. Because of the timeliness of
the POW release and the extraordinary nature of these interviews, we felt they
should run by themselves at this time.
Cadets have been told in the past that information about the techniques used
in the POW camp program is classified, and to our knowledge it has until now
gone unreported. The Daily however, has contacted the Air Force Academy and
has been assured that at this time no information about the camps is classified.
The main body of material which follows comes from two former cadets,
now undergraduates here, who desribe their experiences. Each independently
responded to a classified ad appearing earlier this quarter which said that the
Daily was interested in interviewing former military academy cadets about their
experiences. The person speaking in the first half of the interview wished for
personal reasons to have his identity remain confidential. The person speaking in
the second half of the interview is Larry Geisse, a senior majoring in psychology.
The 48 hour POW compound experience described is part of a much longer
training program known as SERE: Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape.
Cadets enter the compound during the summer following their freshman year.
Academy upperclassmen play the part of the enemy, which is known as the
People's Democratic Republic (PDR).

What was the SERE program like?
"They woke us up at five o'clock in
the morning, put us in full
fatigues—combat boots and your field
jacket, which is a kind of heavy fatigue
jacket—and they took us on a five mile
run. We weren't allowed to chant, you
know, if you sing while you run it
makes things go a lot better, but we
weren't allowed to.
"Then we started really getting
scared, because if anybody stepped
out of line, or even screwed off in the
run, then some dude would come up
and punch him in the face or kick him
in the ass just like you would see in
the movies or something. So we were
all going, 'Wow, what's happening.'
They took us back and we all stood at

attention for a half hour. Then we
went in and had fifteen minutes to eat.
"Then we sat for four hours and
listened to a department of defense
lawyer tell us about all our obligations
under the fighting man's code of
conduct, and the Geneva conventions,
and all this legal stuff. You are sitting
there for four hours listening to that.
If you start to bob your head in a
lecture hall like you are going to fall
asleep, then there are these cats
walking around carrying sticks and
they hit you with the stick on the
head to wake you up.
"They also brief you. They show
you this map which looked like Korea.
There was a northern section and a
southern section. I was told that I was
a B-52 pilot flying out of another

country and that I had been shot
down over the southern section of the
PDR.
"I was told that I was taken to such
and such a POW camp. I was given
information on the base that I flew
from, on the number of B-52's there,
the size of the runway—in other words
military information that these guys
were going to try and get out of me
later.
"Then they piled us all into trucks
and they drove us for forty-five
minutes. All of a sudden there is this
ambush with blanks, but all of a
sudden you hear this gunfire and all
this stuff, and immediately all of the
people who work in the POW camp, all
those cadets, have different accents.
They all speak in an accent that
sounds foreign, yet no foreign country
that you would think of. They all have
on different uniforms, so if you ever
do get to see them you begin to
wonder, my god, what is this place.
"You all carry laundry bags with
you and for 48 hours you have a
laundry bag over your head. It's a
cloth bag, and immediately after you
are drug out of the truck, the bag is
put over your head. Then you crawl
on your belly up a bunch of stones or
something, that's all I can remember
because you can't see. I was crawling
for a while, and then I was inside a
tent.

"I was completely stripped down
naked, with a bag over my head which
is really kind of weird because you
don't know who is looking at you.
Somebody had a magic marker, and I
know I was assigned number 149, that
was my POW number and from then
on I was referred to as Piggy 149.
They call you pigs. That's all they
refer to you as, pigs. I was put into a
tent and there was about 15 or 20 of
us. You spend the whole time in stress
position, sitting in some type of stress
position.
"Then they start their
indoctrination. If you ever have to
piss, then ypu piss in your pants right
where you are sitting. If you ever have
to crap, then you crap in your pants
right where you are sitting. You chant"
things like 'We love Ho for the rice he
grow,' 'Down with USA,' 'Nixon is a

pig, Pat is a whore.' Like, you'll sit
there and everybody will be sitting
around and they'll say 'Piggy please to
chant.' Then they'll say a chant that
you are supposed to do and then of
course you go through the thing where
you say, 'No, I'm not going to chant,'
and then they come around and hit
you with sticks until you do chant.
"Then they come in and they try
and get you to chant, and of course
our tent would say, 'Oh no, we're not
going to chant. Come on, we're big
rough, tough.' So, all of a sudden, they
pick on one guy, and then you can
hear them actually beating him. But
you're sitting there thinking, 'Naw,
they're not doing that,' and then
pretty soon you hear this guy
screaming and guys actually crying. So
then the guy starts leading a chant. So
to protect him—you've got this
classmate thing you know, you're all
in this thing together—then you start
out this chant.
"You start out on a really simple
one. They started 'We love peace.' You
know anybody will chant that, and we
all did. So then they start going on
like 'We love Chairman Mao' and then
it's not so bad to say you dig the
commies, and you know 'We love Ho

POW INTERROGATION Air Force upperclassmen wearing uniforms of the

information from their First year cadet prisoner. The exercises, which involve
intense physical and mental tortures, prepare Air Force fliers for the possibility
of POW imprisonment.
for the rice he grow,' but then they
wanted us to chant, 'Down with the
USA,' and nobody would chant this.
"That is when I had my little
sojourn with the reactionary tent, my
one sojourn. I never really got inside
of it, only outside, but that is
considered a trip among cadets. They
wanted me to lead the chant in the
tent. It was 'Down with USA,' and I
said, 'No I won't,' and then they said,
'Piggy please to grab hold of stick,'
and they all carried sticks that were
about two feet long and about half of
an inch thick, just off the trees, or

whatever. So I grabbed hold of it, and
I walked outside.
"Then when I got to an area which
was clear enough they shoved me
down on the ground, and then I'm
laying on my belly and I had to grab
hold of my ankles, and they started
beating on my legs and they don't do
it hard, but they just sit there tap, tap,
tap, tap. It's kind of a tap, tap, tap,
like this. Constantly, and after about
ten or 15 minutes of that I was getting
welts on my legs and, well, I finally
decided that I would tell them that I
would lead the chant because my legs
were really hurting. So then I got up,
and you know it is kind of hard to
walk, so then I went back into the

tent, and then I wouldn't lead the
chant.
"You know, big fake, and so then
you come back out and then, when it
finally got to the point where I
couldn't walk because of what they
had been doing to my legs, well then I
decided that I would lead the chant.
That's basically what they will do,
they will physically subdue you.
"During the time there you have
two interrogations. One is friendly and
the other is unfriendly. The friendly
interrogation is where you go and the
guy is nice. He gives you water. He
doesn't touch you. He probably says
that he's a Russian and that 'You
know these people are very brutal,
but you have to understand that it's a
very small price to pay, because you
know, your bombs have killed the
guard's children, and the guard must
be amused, and it's really a very small
price to pay,' and on and on and stuff
like that. Then the other one is more
like an unfriendly interrogation where
they beat you.
"At the time I remember I was
standing out, it was the middle of the
day. I remember, because it was sunny
and I had on all my fatigues and my
fatigue jacket and then they put
blankets around me too. I was holding
about a 15 pound rock out at arms

length, and of course my knees were
bent and I was in a crouch position.
"I stayed like that while they again
were beating on my legs. This part of
your leg (the thigh above the back of
your knee) and this part of you (your
underarm) are some of the tenderest
parts of your body, and finally I
cracked. I signed a Red Cross card
saying that I was a prisoner of war, so
that they could file it in Geneva or
whatever, and that was considered
cracking.
"But in the reactionary tent itself,
they have different, what they call
tortures. I know I never got inside the
reactionary tent, and I don't regret not
having done it. I don't figure it makes
me any less of a man. They do take a
55 gallon drum and they dig a hole in
the ground and they sink it down in
there and they put ice water in there.
"It's hot during the time that you
go through it and so they will get you

in there, and they will start beating
your legs, and get you all hot and
sweaty, and then they strip you
completely naked, and then they lift
you up and put you down into this ice
water completely. And it's just, you
know, it's just, the fear that your
breath is going to go completely away,
just does it right there.
"Another one that they do is they
take a cloth bag, and they pull it tight
over your face and they'll pull your
head back. This is the water torture.
They start pouring water over it and
what happens is that—normally I got
about three drinks of water in the

whole time and I got two handfuls of
rice, that were half cooked and had
raw sardines in them, that was my
food for the 48 hours—your head's
back and then they start pouring water
on it, and immediately you start
sucking in this water because—l have
talked to some friends who went
through it—because they said, 'Wow,
this is great.' I mean you are getting
some water and then all of a sudden
the seal forms over the mouth and
nose and you can't breath. And that's
fear. Boom. You crack,
"And they have a one legged stool
in there, where you have to sit on this
one legged stool, and while you are
sitting there, they walk around you

and they'll hit you from different
sides. And it's this fear of not knowing
where it's coming from.
"Then they also have after each
interrogation you spend 45 minutes in
a three-by-three-by-three box and they
just lock you in this box, and it has
stones in it. Then they come around
every now and then and they beat on
the box, and there is this loud echoing
effect.
"They also have indoctrination
sessions where they come around and
they pick out some of the weirdest
facts of 'American history, that I never
knew about. They have some people
believing that America is not a
democracy, that it is the biggest rip-off,
totalitarian pig country in the world.
"It is so much, to the point that
one person, one of my classmates
believed it to the point that he
renounced his American citizenship,
resigned from the United States Air
Force, enlisted in the People's
Democratic Republic Army, took
commission as a major, and was
administering the punishment. See he
jumped over the line, he became one
of the beaters. One of the problems
they had with him was that he was
beating too hard. He was actually
hurting people too much.
"It came time for the situation to

be over, and no, he would not believe
it. He kept saying, 'No, PDR, PDR is
best, Yankee Imperialist Pigs, I don't
believe you.' And the only way that
they were able to get this guy back,
was they got a separate tent for this
guy and they beat him back into
America. He really flipped out.
Another former cadet who had not
gone through the POW experience, but
who was present during this interview
at this point added, "I know I heard of
a couple of guys who really lost it. "
Was anyone physically injured?
"In my class there were only a
couple of arms broken, but in '74
there was a broken skull in POW camp.
The other Cadet: "a lot of arms and
legs. I broke my foot at the same time,
and they kept dragging guys in there
all day long, just all broke to shit."
There are a lot of tent pegs around,
and if people fall or something like
that it (broken arms or legs) can
happen. There were a lot of knee

injuries because the tendons, beatings
on the tendon. Like I had black and
blue marks from here to here (inside
knee to thigh) and mine were not very
good, because I didn't get beat all that
much, because mine went away in
about—the major welts went away—in
about two days. Whereas some people
had them four and five days
afterwards."
The other cadet: "A lot of guys too I
heard about, with that bag over their
heads, hit trees. They would take off
running, and they wouldn't pull the
bag off in time. "
"You can escape if you try, but if
you do, you get beat twice as bad.
That's why I never tried to. I was one
of the first people in my tent to be
picked out to lead a chant, and I
resisted right there, so I was one of the
first people taken up to the
reactionary tent early. I got all the
crap beat out of me and so right then I
decided I don't care what's going to
happen, I don't want to get beaten any
more and that's it, I'll play the game,
the psychological game, but when they
start getting physical then I'll start
giving in.
Did you find the POW camp
valuable?
"Yes. Tremendously so. I know
more about myself. I know more
about the people I went through with,
and I know more about people in
general. I learned a lot about myself. It
is a sociological experiment in the first
degree, the first order, and you are a
participant observer. You really
wonder if it is really worth it. What is
it really worth in life? What is the
essence of living? Because for those 48
hours there was a time when I really
wished I would have died—seriously."
"Like my best friend is my best
friend, because not only did we go
through hell week together, and the
whole doolie year together, but during
the middle of the thing, he found me.
Somehow we were in the same tent.
All of a sudden I feel this hand reach
out and grab hold of my shoulder and
just kind of grip it and he says, 'Just
hang on buddy. You'll make it.' And
he got picked up and dragged out of
the tent and beaten for saying that
because they heard him and you can't
talk to your fellow prisoners.
"But just because of things like
that, you learn of the people there—l
know who I would trust with my life
and who I wouldn't, because, like
some people broke right away, but
they broke with dignity. I mean it's
hard to say. that, I mean some people
said, 'Ok, I'll sign all the papers,' like
that, and that was it.
"But then there was a person, like
there was one guy in my squadron
who went over to the other side. He
became a major, no a captain, in the
PDR and he in turn beat me. I told
him that I better not see him in a dark
alley when I was on a privilege
anytime, because I'd kill him, and
when I told him that I meant it. I
don't mean it now. If I find him in a
dark alley sometime I'll probably spit
in his face and just walk on, because
I'm just getting less violent the longer
I'm here (at Stanford). You go
through something like that, and
you've just got to know what you
want out of life. This is what can
happen to you, a fate worse than

death, so what do you want to live
for."
Why did you get out of the
academy after the POW experience?
"Because I was against the war in
Vietnam. I am against our present
system of government that allows one
man like Nixon and Kissinger to make
the decision to invade Cambodia and
Laos. I am against that, and I'm going
to be damned if I am going to
prostitute myself, and my body, to
that extent to carry out their policies.
So it was basically the war, plus I
wanted to go into a different career
field. I want to work with people, and
not with machines."
The interview with Larry Geisse begins
here.
"At Fairchild Air Force Base they
first set up this POW camp, and after
the first experiments, when they
found out how many men were
cracking under it, they made it
mandatory for all pilots who were
going to go to combat to go through it
before they become pilots. So they set
up one at the Air Force Academy for
all cadets to go through, but this was
all kind of hush, hush. Nobody knew
about it.
"It was a good experience. It was
my fear, that was a very good
experience. It was really rough, really
demanding. It pushed most of the
people I knew to their limits. You
became really aware of just how much
you could take, and how really frail
you were.
"It is jyst unbelievable how fast
you can go. You know, if you are

deprived of food and water for a little
while, and you have to go to the
bathroom and they won't let you go;
or you are isolated from all contact.
You are by yourself, and there is some
nice guy talking to you, offering you
food and water. If that doesn't work
they can beat you, and you would be
surprised how fast you can go if they
put you under the right conditions. So
you become really aware of your
limitations not only physical, but
meqlal as well.
"While I was in the compound I
realized that I was at the Air Force
Academy for about the first five or six
hours, but then I didn't know where I
was. I mean, you don't even have your
head, you don't think about it. I just
was thinking about escape, how do I
get but of here, or if I should kill this
guy. I mean you actually think 'I got
to kill this guy. I got to get out of
here.' Or, you think, 'How did I ever
get into this?' and you think back, and
you can't think back.
"This is the great thing about it, if
you want to put it in terms of the way
the experiment was set up. It was very
realistic. After the first ten hours you
are convinced that you are not at the
Air Force Academy. Especially when
some guy is sitting there beating the
shit out of you. You know, it just
doesn't seem real.
"They made you memorize a story
about how you got there and how you
got caught. You also memorize a
bunch of classified information that
you weren't supposed to give out no
matter how hard they beat you. Then
they would record how much you gave
out. It goes on your record,and they
keep it filed, but they tell you it is not
going to be used for anything. It can't
be used against you. It doesn't make
any difference if you collapse, they
won't kick you out.
"There were guys that went over to
the other side, that started beating up
their classmates. It was just really
incredible, making tapes, saying,

'Come on over to the red side, I've got
all the food and water I need.' He'd
say his name, you know, 'l'm Jim so
and so, your friend.' At the time I
thought I'd kill him. I don't know,
that's a pretty harsh word. Maybe I
would have. I guess I would have
beaten him up or something. I mean if
you can imagine, your best friend,
beating you up.
"I was doing pretty good. I was sort
of keeping to myself, which was the
idea. You were supposed to employ
psychological warfare against them. In
other words, you weren't supposed to
be a total resister, because they could
just kill you if they wanted to. The
idea was that you were supposed to
leak out a little, but not anything
critical, so they'd think you were

going along with them and they'd
think that they had you, so they
wouldn't kill you, and you could live
until you had a chance to escape.
"So I was doing pretty good. I
didn't sign anything. That's a big deal,
signing your name to some document,
because they say if you were a
prisoner in Vietnam and they forced
you to sign some document they could
transfer it to anything. So once
they've got your signature, it's a big
weapon.
"Well, I almost lasted, but I'll tell
you, the thing that got to me, that
really still gets to me today. This was
after about thirty hours. It was over a
day, and all we had for food was a
little bit of rice, no water, the only
time I had really gone to the
bathroom, I had urinated once when I
was in the hot-box, they call it, a little
box they put you in and they close
you up in there. I had managed to role
over and urinated out the bottom, so
they so it coming out, they dragged
me out and beat me up. But anyway I
got to go to the bathroom, so it was a
good deal."
What was it like to get beaten up?
"Well apparently it wasn't so bad
for our class, but in the class before
they had quite a number of people
who broke their legs and their arms. It
was sort of bad. They would always
get all these people in the hospital.
The big thing, where it really hurts is
on the back of the leg. They take a
stick and beat there, because in the
first place it doesn't usually leave any
marks. Two men beat, and it hurts like
hell, it really does. It hurts more than

someone punching you. It stings all
through your body.
"There was some guy they beat so
bad that they took him to the hospital
and they sent him home right away for
four months in the hopes that his leg
would recuperate enough to walk, it

was so bad. That was the big thing, to
really avoid those beatings. It weakens
you. You use up strength and you just
can't imagine what it is like to be
starved so that you don't even have
strength to talk. I was delerious. You
don't know what is going on.
"But anyway, they took me up to
the interrogator. They take you up
quite a few times, and I was sitting
there with this bag over my head, and
I was outside the camp, and this
interrogator comes up, sits next to me,
and tells me to take the bag off my
head. He was being really friendly to
me, he offers me a cigarette and stuff,
and puts his arm around me.
"He had a black uniform, all black

and they let them grow mustaches and
beards and they had little red scarfs.
He looked bigger than me, and really
strong and healthy. He looks mean as
shit in other words. And he had big
black boots. He looked like what you
would picture a North Vietnamese to
look like.
"So anyway, this guy sat down and
was being really friendly, and it really
does a lot for you to feel that
somebody is being friendly. He says, 'I
know how you feel. I really
sympathize with the Americans. I
don't really like the way they are
running this place. I wish there was
something I could do for you.' £.nd
then he finally gets around to the
point where he says, "You know, I
can't really do anything for you unless
you tell me what I need to know, and
then I can make conditions better for
you, and for all your friends.'
"Well, I said baloney, I know
what's going on. I said fuck you
buddy. You don't say that, you say,
'Well, comrad, sir, my American
people would lose faith in me if I told
you something.' And he says, 'Well, I
understand that,' and he talks to you
for a long time. Then he finally says,
'Well, I tried to help you, but there's
nothing I can do. The other
interrogator is going to be here, and he
has ways I don't approve of.' Well, you
know what he's talking about and you
say, 'Don't leave,' and he says, 'l'm
sorry, there's nothing else I can do for
you.'
"He leaves, and the other guy
comes in, big stick in his hand, big
rubber hose and two guys next to him.
You just think Holy Cow. And then
just as they are about to start, the
other guy comes back and says, 'No,
don't beat him up. I like this guy.' So

they say okay, but then they go back
to your tent and they bring this guy
back from your tent.
"They stand him about one
hundred yards away from you. Just far
away so you can't see him too good.
They have him out there and they

hold him up. This guy says, 'You
know, we are not going to beat you
up, but we're going to beat your
buddy up. Over there, your best
friend, one of your classmates. If you
don't talk, we're just going to beat him
until he dies.'
"You don't believe that. I thought,
'Forget it, I'm not falling for that. This
is the old North Korean trick.' So I
said, 'Well, I just can't tell you the
information.' And they say, 'Well,
your comrad is going to be beaten
because of you. How do you think he
feels. It's nothing he did. It's
something you're doing. But I said,
'l'm sorry, I really can't tell you.'
"And then they walk over there,
and they take this guy, and they leave
the bag on his head. He is dressed in
the same uniform you are, fatigues,
and they take all his clothes off. Then
this guy takes the hose, and I swear,
he just started whacking him like this
(Larry stood up and demonstrated).
Two of these guys just start beating
him like this. And the guy starts
screaming and yelling. I mean I just
can't tell you. He's screaming, 'aieee'
like this. And you hear him and he
falls to the ground. They're beating
him like this, and like this.
"So the guy walks over and he says,
'lf you tell us, we'll let your buddy go
and everything will be fine.' But
you've heard this before, there's really
a conflict in your mind. What should I
do, and then you say, well, I can't
betray the United States, because you
think well, there may be 2000 or 3000
people at your airfield would be killed
if you told them how to get there and
stuff, so you say, 'No, I can't do it.'
"So then the guy walks back and
says, 'okay.' And this guy is yelling,
'ugh, oooww' the guy is screaming.
Holy cow, they're beating him, he's
rolling on the ground trying to climb
away, and they kick him back in the
face. He falls over, and finally he
blacks out.
"So they leave him there and they
walk over to you again and they say,
'Listen, 100k... .' And by this time
you are really shaken up, and you're
almost going to say okay, don't hit
him any more, and they say, 'Tell us
what we want to know and we will let
him go.' But somehow I hang on. I
say, 'No, I'm not going to tell you.'
"So they go over and throw some
water on him and wake him up again.
Then he starts crying, this guy on the
ground, and it just kind of gets you.
To see someone your age, one of your
buddies, as strong as you are, crying.
Then they just start hitting him, and
he was crying and yelling, 'Momma,
mom, help, s-somebody help me,
somebody please help me,' and I just
said, 'Okay, I said, okay please don't
hit him anymore. I'll tell you what
you want to know.' And they said,
'Ahh, good comrad,' and they came
over and got me to sign this paper.
"So I signed this paper, and then

I was stripped down naked,
With a bag tied over my head,
Which is really kind of weird

They kept dragging guys in
All day 9 just broke to shit

So I signed this piece of paper,
I just felt like a piece of shit,
Obviously I was really a fool

It hurts on the back of the ,
They take a stick and beat
It stings all through your body

POW COMPOUND
the guy they were beating on gets up,
puts on his clothes and walks away.
Turns out it was one of their guys,
that they had been just fake beating
him up all this time, and had been
playing. I mean it was just
demoralizing. I just felt like a piece of
shit. I felt like I had betrayed my
country, that I had been duped.
Obviously I was really a fool. I said
God I wish I had the chance to do it
over again. If it's the last thing I do
I'm going to escape, get out of here
and correct my record. I really felt
bad, because here I'd held on through
thirty hours of all these beatings and
stuff, and here they'd been playing."
You said you escaped once. What
happened?
"I was sitting in this tent, I had this
bag over my head, and I finally bit a
hole—you can't move your hands too
much, because they'd spot you—but I
bit this hole in this bag and by pulling
on the bag in back I got the hole up
where I could see that it was dark
outside. So I said this is a perfect time
to escape. I watched for a while, and
the guy didn't come back. So I looked
around, and I could see that I was
about ten yards from the side of the
•tent.
"So I moved over by the side of the
tent. You know, there are pull up flaps
on the sides of these big army tents.
So I got there and picked up the side a

little. I could see that it was real easy
to pull up. It wasn't staked down or
anything.
"So I just waited for a while and
then he came back and looked around
just to make sure nobody was doing
anything. He hit some guy and kicked
somebody else, just to make sure
everybody knows he is there so they
won't try anything. Then he stepped
outside for a minute, apparently to
talk to a buddy. You know, your heart
is pounding and I said to myself,
'Okay, this is it. I'm getting out of
here.'
Did you try to get anyone to come
with you?
"You couldn't say anything to
anyone around you, because when
you've got this bag over your head you
don't know who's talking to you.
You don't know if it's your buddy
next to you, or it could be the guard,
because they did come up and
whisper, 'Hey, let's get out of here,'
and then you would say, 'okay this is
it,' and they'd beat you up. Son of
a.. ..
"Anyway, I was by the edge of this
tent, and I just said okay, it's now or
never, so I pulled off this bag off my
head, pulled up the side of the tent,
whipped out underneath in one of
those combat roles, you know, and I
was just about ready to get up and
jump over this barbell wire fence that

was just behind the tent, and I looked
up and here it is just like day outside.
They have these big spotlights shining
between the tents right where I am,
and there are about six guys standing
around just literally looking at me
kind of like laughing.
"And I thought, 'Oh no,' and got
up, pulled up the flap, jumped back
inside the tent, put the bag over my
head and sat back among these guys
who just sat there. They didn't come
in to find out who it was, they were
just happy to have scared me.
What were the tortures they used in
the reactionary tent?
"I never really got into any of the
good ones, I just heard about them
afterwards so I can't really validate
them too well. These were usually if
you are bad, if you tried to hit
somebody or something. There was
one where they take your pants off, so
you have bare knees and stuff. They
would throw little pieces of sand on
this tin pan that is pretty big, and you
would have to kneel in it in the same
position for like a half hour or so, and
all these little grains of sand are
digging into your knees. You think
you're going to die, because it hurts so
much.
"Then they have this one where
they put a towel over your face and
they pour water on it. The water
evaporates and the vapor gets in your

nose and in your mouth, so you can't
breath. It's like suffocating and they
have your hands tied behind your
back, so you can't do anything and
they can pour a little bit on and you
suffocate a little, but you are still
conscious and they hit you around a
little. Then they pour a little more
until you black out. They take you
back and you don't mess around any
more.
"They have some really good ones.
They took some guys out at night, and
it's cold out in those mountains at
night, and they made them stand out
there. They poured cold water on him,
practically froze his nuts off. Under
those situations you really think
whether it's worth it. But usually they
just beat you."
What about the mental types of
things?
"Yeah, there were some good ones.
They would have us chant, 'We love
Ho for the rice he grow.' You do that
50 times. 'We love Ho for the rice he
grow,' 'We love Ho for the rice he
grow.' You know, it gets you in the
communist mood. We had a good time
in our tent, because guys would say
'Fuck Ho for the rice he doesn't grow,'
and it really sounds stupid now, but at
the time we laughed a little and
somebody comes up and hits you, but
at least you are laughing. You keep
your sense of humor.

"They would come in and degrade
your opinion of America. They would
talk to you. They would come in and
sit everybody down, give you a little
bit of rest, and they'd talk to you.
They would say, 'We are just here to
talk a little bit about America. We've
never been there and we would like to
hear what it is like. Perhaps somebody
can tell us something that is wrong
with America so we can improve upon
it in our country.' And somebody will
raise his hand, and he'll say, just to
talk you know, just for the sake of
talking. 'Yeah, we have a real smog
problem in America,' and that will get
someone else going.
"It could be that this guy who
started it was one of their own guys.
You never really know who's talking
really. Pretty soon everybody, starts
talking about the things that are wrong
in America. Pollution, crime,
presidents, whatever it is, radicals,
apathy, Negros, anything you can
think of they would be talking about.
All of a sudden you get this feeling
that America is not such a great place.
Like it is really bad news, and then
they start talking about how good it is
in their country with Ho Chi Minh and
the boys, how the people are always so
happy, always singing songs, and you
begin to wonder, 'Wow, that sounds
okay.'
"I mean, there were people who

went all the way over to the other
side. They really try to indoctrinate
you. They do everything they can to
get you thinking anti-American and
pro-communist thoughts. That's all
they do.
Upperclassmen at the academy
played the part of the PDR. Would
you ever become one of them, or do
you think you could?
"Some of the best guys I knew,
upperclassmen I knew, from like
soccer, were some of the nicest guys,
but they really got into their roles.
They were really beating guys. You
don't really think anything about it
when you are beating someone. I think
some guys really liked it. But I don't
think that would be really hard for
anyone, once you got them there."
Was the experience valuable to
you?
"Well, for someone like me it was,
but there were some people who were
there who were permanently
damaged. There were people who just
didn't have the physical and mental
capabilities to go through something
like that, and they crack. I mean, how
would you ever live that down.
To give in,
to go over to the other side. That's
really demoralizing to both you and
them. So I thought it was okay for me,
but I wouldn't have everybody go
through it."
