## Cadets Describe POW Training 
### 
Editor's note: The excellent condition of most of the American prisoners of
war released this week was surprising to many observers who remembered the
fate of this country's POW's in Korea.
This apparently remarkable ability of this war's Air Force pilots to endure
years of POW existence without cracking may be due in large part to an
extraordinary, but virtually unknown POW camp training procedure which all
Air Force pilots since the Korean war have been required to undergo prior to
combat duty.
The following interviews describe the sometimes unbelievable physical and
mental tortures which have become standard techniques at such a training
experience at the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs. The simulated POW
camp program at the academy began in 1967 and was modeled after the original
program which still exists at Fairchild Air Force Base. That program, along with
the Air Force Fighting Man's Code of Conduct, was created by the Eisenhower
administration in response to the American POW experience in Korea.
The material presented here was gathered by Daily reporter Bob Litterman
while researching a story on the military academies. Because of the timeliness of
the POW release and the extraordinary nature of these interviews, we felt they
should run by themselves at this time.
Cadets have been told in the past that information about the techniques used
in the POW camp program is classified, and to our knowledge it has until now
gone unreported. The Daily however, has contacted the Air Force Academy and
has been assured that at this time no information about the camps is classified.
The main body of material which follows comes from two former cadets,
now undergraduates here, who desribe their experiences. Each independently
responded to a classified ad appearing earlier this quarter which said that the
Daily was interested in interviewing former military academy cadets about their
experiences. The person speaking in the first half of the interview wished for
personal reasons to have his identity remain confidential. The person speaking in
the second half of the interview is Larry Geisse, a senior majoring in psychology.
The 48 hour POW compound experience described is part of a much longer
training program known as SERE: Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape.
Cadets enter the compound during the summer following their freshman year.
Academy upperclassmen play the part of the enemy, which is known as the
People's Democratic Republic (PDR).

What was the SERE program like?
"They woke us up at five o'clock in
the morning, put us in full
fatigues—combat boots and your field
jacket, which is a kind of heavy fatigue
jacket—and they took us on a five mile
run. We weren't allowed to chant, you
know, if you sing while you run it
makes things go a lot better, but we
weren't allowed to.
"Then we started really getting
scared, because if anybody stepped
out of line, or even screwed off in the
run, then some dude would come up
and punch him in the face or kick him
in the ass just like you would see in
the movies or something. So we were
all going, 'Wow, what's happening.'
They took us back and we all stood at

attention for a half hour. Then we
went in and had fifteen minutes to eat.
"Then we sat for four hours and
listened to a department of defense
lawyer tell us about all our obligations
under the fighting man's code of
conduct, and the Geneva conventions,
and all this legal stuff. You are sitting
there for four hours listening to that.
If you start to bob your head in a
lecture hall like you are going to fall
asleep, then there are these cats
walking around carrying sticks and
they hit you with the stick on the
head to wake you up.
"They also brief you. They show
you this map which looked like Korea.
There was a northern section and a
southern section. I was told that I was
a B-52 pilot flying out of another

country and that I had been shot
down over the southern section of the
PDR.
"I was told that I was taken to such
and such a POW camp. I was given
information on the base that I flew
from, on the number of B-52's there,
the size of the runway—in other words
military information that these guys
were going to try and get out of me
later.
"Then they piled us all into trucks
and they drove us for forty-five
minutes. All of a sudden there is this
ambush with blanks, but all of a
sudden you hear this gunfire and all
this stuff, and immediately all of the
people who work in the POW camp, all
those cadets, have different accents.
They all speak in an accent that
sounds foreign, yet no foreign country
that you would think of. They all have
on different uniforms, so if you ever
do get to see them you begin to
wonder, my god, what is this place.
"You all carry laundry bags with
you and for 48 hours you have a
laundry bag over your head. It's a
cloth bag, and immediately after you
are drug out of the truck, the bag is
put over your head. Then you crawl
on your belly up a bunch of stones or
something, that's all I can remember
because you can't see. I was crawling
for a while, and then I was inside a
tent.

"I was completely stripped down
naked, with a bag over my head which
is really kind of weird because you
don't know who is looking at you.
Somebody had a magic marker, and I
know I was assigned number 149, that
was my POW number and from then
on I was referred to as Piggy 149.
They call you pigs. That's all they
refer to you as, pigs. I was put into a
tent and there was about 15 or 20 of
us. You spend the whole time in stress
position, sitting in some type of stress
position.
"Then they start their
indoctrination. If you ever have to
piss, then ypu piss in your pants right
where you are sitting. If you ever have
to crap, then you crap in your pants
right where you are sitting. You chant"
things like 'We love Ho for the rice he
grow,' 'Down with USA,' 'Nixon is a

pig, Pat is a whore.' Like, you'll sit
there and everybody will be sitting
around and they'll say 'Piggy please to
chant.' Then they'll say a chant that
you are supposed to do and then of
course you go through the thing where
you say, 'No, I'm not going to chant,'
and then they come around and hit
you with sticks until you do chant.
"Then they come in and they try
and get you to chant, and of course
our tent would say, 'Oh no, we're not
going to chant. Come on, we're big
rough, tough.' So, all of a sudden, they
pick on one guy, and then you can
hear them actually beating him. But
you're sitting there thinking, 'Naw,
they're not doing that,' and then
pretty soon you hear this guy
screaming and guys actually crying. So
then the guy starts leading a chant. So
to protect him—you've got this
classmate thing you know, you're all
in this thing together—then you start
out this chant.
"You start out on a really simple
one. They started 'We love peace.' You
know anybody will chant that, and we
all did. So then they start going on
like 'We love Chairman Mao' and then
it's not so bad to say you dig the
commies, and you know 'We love Ho

POW INTERROGATION Air Force upperclassmen wearing uniforms of the
fictitious People's Democratic Republic are shown here attempting to get
information from their First year cadet prisoner. The exercises, which involve
intense physical and mental tortures, prepare Air Force fliers for the possibility
of POW imprisonment.
