# University's Commitment Questionable
## Committee On Minority Affairs Axed 
### Henry P. Organ 
In April 1970, after eighteen
months of deliberation, the
Senate of the Academic Council
recommended to President Lyman
that a Committee on Minority
Affairs (C.0.M.A.) be established
as a standing University
committee. The charge to
C.O.M.A. stated in part that it
"... shall formulate policy
concerning the improvement of
educational and social
opportunities at Stanford
University of members of
minority groups." This step was
viewed by many as a favorable
reflection of the University's
commitment to communities and
students of color.
However, last November, after
a very brief life, the Committee
on Committees recommended
that C.O.M.A. be dissolved and an
Ad Hoc Presidential Commission

be established in its place to
review .. the University's
programs and problems with
respect to minority affairs, and
with the recommendations
pertaining thereto." Thus, the
amount of time taken to
determine if C.O.M.A. should
exist was as long as C.O.M.A.'s
actual life span.
Dissolution
In recommending dissolution
of C.0.M.A., the Committee on
Committees made the following
comments:
In the best of all possible
worlds, there should probably be
no need for such a commission;
everything within its purview
probably falls within the charge to
some other existing body. Given
the realities of human frailties,
however, the University probably
needs stimulus from time to time
of a penetrating examination of
its status with respect to minority
affairs. The most effective body
to serve this function appears to
be a Presidential Commission
charged to report within a
specified time, The idea is that a
Presidential Commission on
Minority Affairs should be
activated periodically whenever it
is found to bes needed. The
Committee on "Committees is
assuming that such a commission
is needed now.
It is difficult to understand
how these comments can sustain
the recommendation. First,
certainly some committee's charge
may overlap the charges of other
committees. Even the Committee
on Committees understood that in
phrasing the initial charge to
C.0.M.A.:
Since the concerns of the
Committee do often coincide with
those of other committees and
administrative officers, this
Committee shall consult the
chairman of other committees of
administrative officers whenever
recommendations are being
considered which would effect
their responsibilities.
Camouflage
Thus, M why should this
acknowledged effect
now be presented as an argument
for dissolution? The camouflage
being used here is the assertion
that the interests of people of
color at Stanford can now be
incorporated into the routine
standard operating procedures of
existing officers, committees, etc.
"In the best of all possible
worlds," this would be true.
However, people of color at

Stanford are not in the best of all
or any possible worlds. Moreover,
it would be scores of years before
they will ever be considered a part
of the routine life of Stanford, if
ever.
Second, opposition must be
offered to any attempt to
euphemistically portray racism as
a mere innocent frailty. In
actuality, this 'frailty' is often
used by skillful tacticians as an
effective unifying force; or
perhaps this 'frailty' is a
reflection of a lack of true
commitment. By definition, no
university has to be reminded of a
commitment.
Progress Insufficient
Third, in the charge to
C.0.M.A., the Committee on
Committees stated:
Since the Committee's
achievements should gradually
eliminate the necessity of its
operation, the Committee shall,
from time to time, consider the
propriety of its own continuance.
Again, "in the best of all
possible worlds," this would be
true. But it would be grossly in
error to state that racial equality
at Stanford has now reached a
point where C.O.M.A. can be
downgraded, dissolved, or only
required to be activated every
four or five years in the form of a
Presidential Commission. To the
contrary, if racial progress at
Stanford is to be the criterion for
determining the level of activity
required by the University, then
C.O.M.A. should not be dissolved
or downgraded, but required to
compound its efforts.
Fourth, in recommending the
disestablishment of C.0.M.A., the
Committee on Committees
recommended that "as a standing
University committee, this body
would obviously be superseded by
an occasional Presidential
Commission on Minority Affairs"
(italics added). The words
"occasional" and "Ad Hoc"
bring to mind an attitude that
seems to prevail when the status
and interests of people of color
are being considered, not only
here but throughout the country.
People of color are often
perceived as marginal, peripheral,
secondary, temporary, and not of
full or complete standing.
Insulting
Such perceptions are to be
despised and rejected, especially
by one of the nation's leading
universities. The interests of
students and people of color must
be of the same, if not greater,
importance to Stanford.
Comparatively, it is insulting that
the University can consider Public
Events, Tresidder Union, and
Athletics, Physical Education and
Recreation deserving of University
Committee standing, but not
people of color.
Fifth, the Committee on
Committees states that a
Presidential Commission would be
a more effective body to handle
minority affairs. The question can
be raised as to what a Presidential
Commission could do that a
University Committee could not.
No satisfactory answer has been
given to this question as yet.
Sixth, the Committee on
Committees suggests that
C.O.M.A. could not find a mission
for itself. With all of the problems
confronting people of color at
Stanford and at other universities,
this is unlikely. It is also an insult
to the people who served on
C.O.M.A.
C.O.M.A. did have a mission
and a major task that it adopted
late last year. That task involved
developing, implementing, and
continually monitoring
University-wide, long-range
policies and programs that pertain
to people of color. A difficult
task, but a necessary one. The
alleged failure on the part of
C.O.M.A. not to find itself should

not be viewed as a failing on
C.O.M.A.'s part, but perhaps a
failure of the Committee on
Committees to set forth in clear
and precise language C.O.M.A.'s
charge.
Lastly, although C.O.M.A. did
raise questions regarding the
clarity of its mission and the
overlapping of its responsibilities
with other committees, it did
make the following statement
regarding the continuation of
C.O.M.A.:
It appears that the University

Committee on Minority Affairs, as
presently charged, finds itself in a
great dilemma as to its role at
Stanfordâ– , University. On the one
hand, it is clear that the
University must draw attention to
the fact that it is seriously
concerned with minority affairs.
Therefore, it seems that the
establishment of a committee
specifically concerned with
minority affairs serves a useful
purpose (emphasis added).

Thus, M why should this
acknowledged effect
now be presented as an argument
for dissolution? The camouflage
being used here is the assertion
that the interests of people of
color at Stanford can now be
incorporated into the routine
standard operating procedures of
existing officers, committees, etc.
"In the best of all possible
worlds," this would be true.
However, people of color at

Stanford are not in the best of all
or any possible worlds. Moreover,
it would be scores of years before
they will ever be considered a part
of the routine life of Stanford, if
ever.
Second, opposition must be
offered to any attempt to
euphemistically portray racism as
a mere innocent frailty. In
actuality, this 'frailty' is often
used by skillful tacticians as an
effective unifying force; or
perhaps this 'frailty' is a
reflection of a lack of true
commitment. By definition, no
university has to be reminded of a
commitment.
Progress Insufficient
Third, in the charge to
C.0.M.A., the Committee on
Committees stated:
Since the Committee's
achievements should gradually
eliminate the necessity of its
operation, the Committee shall,
from time to time, consider the
propriety of its own continuance.
Again, "in the best of all
possible worlds," this would be
true. But it would be grossly in
error to state that racial equality
at Stanford has now reached a
point where C.O.M.A. can be
downgraded, dissolved, or only
required to be activated every
four or five years in the form of a
Presidential Commission. To the
contrary, if racial progress at
Stanford is to be the criterion for
determining the level of activity
required by the University, then
C.O.M.A. should not be dissolved
or downgraded, but required to
compound its efforts.
Fourth, in recommending the
disestablishment of C.0.M.A., the
Committee on Committees
recommended that "as a standing
University committee, this body
would obviously be superseded by
an occasional Presidential
Commission on Minority Affairs"
(italics added). The words
"occasional" and "Ad Hoc"
bring to mind an attitude that
seems to prevail when the status
and interests of people of color
are being considered, not only
here but throughout the country.
People of color are often
perceived as marginal, peripheral,
secondary, temporary, and not of
full or complete standing.
Insulting
Such perceptions are to be
despised and rejected, especially
by one of the nation's leading
universities. The interests of
students and people of color must
be of the same, if not greater,
importance to Stanford.
Comparatively, it is insulting that
the University can consider Public
Events, Tresidder Union, and
Athletics, Physical Education and
Recreation deserving of University
Committee standing, but not
people of color.
Fifth, the Committee on
Committees states that a
Presidential Commission would be
a more effective body to handle
minority affairs. The question can
be raised as to what a Presidential
Commission could do that a
University Committee could not.
No satisfactory answer has been
given to this question as yet.
Sixth, the Committee on
Committees suggests that
C.O.M.A. could not find a mission
for itself. With all of the problems
confronting people of color at
Stanford and at other universities,
this is unlikely. It is also an insult
to the people who served on
C.O.M.A.
C.O.M.A. did have a mission
and a major task that it adopted
late last year. That task involved
developing, implementing, and
continually monitoring
University-wide, long-range
policies and programs that pertain
to people of color. A difficult
task, but a necessary one. The
alleged failure on the part of
C.O.M.A. not to find itself should

not be viewed as a failing on
C.O.M.A.'s part, but perhaps a
failure of the Committee on
Committees to set forth in clear
and precise language C.O.M.A.'s
charge.
Lastly, although C.O.M.A. did
raise questions regarding the
clarity of its mission and the
overlapping of its responsibilities
with other committees, it did
make the following statement
regarding the continuation of
C.O.M.A.:
It appears that the University

Committee on Minority Affairs, as
presently charged, finds itself in a
great dilemma as to its role at
Stanfordâ– , University. On the one
hand, it is clear that the
University must draw attention to
the fact that it is seriously
concerned with minority affairs.
Therefore, it seems that the
establishment of a committee
specifically concerned with
minority affairs serves a useful
purpose (emphasis added).

in the General Secretary's office.)


'HOW MUCH WILL YOU GIVE ME FOR THAT? IT'S CALLED A DOLLAR, AND IT'S NOT WORTH
A DAMN THING BACK HOME?'
In April 1970, after eighteen
months of deliberation, the
Senate of the Academic Council
recommended to President Lyman
that a Committee on Minority
Affairs (C.0.M.A.) be established
as a standing University
committee. The charge to
C.O.M.A. stated in part that it
"... shall formulate policy
concerning the improvement of
educational and social
opportunities at Stanford
University of members of
minority groups." This step was
viewed by many as a favorable
reflection of the University's
commitment to communities and
students of color.
However, last November, after
a very brief life, the Committee
on Committees recommended
that C.O.M.A. be dissolved and an
Ad Hoc Presidential Commission

be established in its place to
review .. the University's
programs and problems with
respect to minority affairs, and
with the recommendations
pertaining thereto." Thus, the
amount of time taken to
determine if C.O.M.A. should
exist was as long as C.O.M.A.'s
actual life span.
Dissolution
In recommending dissolution
of C.0.M.A., the Committee on
Committees made the following
comments:
In the best of all possible
worlds, there should probably be
no need for such a commission;
everything within its purview
probably falls within the charge to
some other existing body. Given
the realities of human frailties,
however, the University probably
needs stimulus from time to time
of a penetrating examination of
its status with respect to minority
affairs. The most effective body
to serve this function appears to
be a Presidential Commission
charged to report within a
specified time, The idea is that a
Presidential Commission on
Minority Affairs should be
activated periodically whenever it
is found to bes needed. The
Committee on "Committees is
assuming that such a commission
is needed now.
It is difficult to understand
how these comments can sustain
the recommendation. First,
certainly some committee's charge
may overlap the charges of other
committees. Even the Committee
on Committees understood that in
phrasing the initial charge to
C.0.M.A.:
Since the concerns of the
Committee do often coincide with
those of other committees and
administrative officers, this
Committee shall consult the
chairman of other committees of
administrative officers whenever
recommendations are being
considered which would effect
their responsibilities.

Such perceptions are to be
despised and rejected, especially
by one of the nation's leading
universities. The interests of
students and people of color must
be of the same, if not greater,
importance to Stanford.
Comparatively, it is insulting that
the University can consider Public
Events, Tresidder Union, and
Athletics, Physical Education and
Recreation deserving of University
Committee standing, but not
people of color.
Fifth, the Committee on
Committees states that a
Presidential Commission would be
a more effective body to handle
minority affairs. The question can
be raised as to what a Presidential
Commission could do that a
University Committee could not.
No satisfactory answer has been
given to this question as yet.
Sixth, the Committee on
Committees suggests that
C.O.M.A. could not find a mission
for itself. With all of the problems
confronting people of color at
Stanford and at other universities,
this is unlikely. It is also an insult
to the people who served on
C.O.M.A.
C.O.M.A. did have a mission
and a major task that it adopted
late last year. That task involved
developing, implementing, and
continually monitoring
University-wide, long-range
policies and programs that pertain
to people of color. A difficult
task, but a necessary one. The
alleged failure on the part of
C.O.M.A. not to find itself should

not be viewed as a failing on
C.O.M.A.'s part, but perhaps a
failure of the Committee on
Committees to set forth in clear
and precise language C.O.M.A.'s
charge.
Lastly, although C.O.M.A. did
raise questions regarding the
clarity of its mission and the
overlapping of its responsibilities
with other committees, it did
make the following statement
regarding the continuation of
C.O.M.A.:
It appears that the University

Committee on Minority Affairs, as
presently charged, finds itself in a
great dilemma as to its role at
Stanfordâ– , University. On the one
hand, it is clear that the
University must draw attention to
the fact that it is seriously
concerned with minority affairs.
Therefore, it seems that the
establishment of a committee
specifically concerned with
minority affairs serves a useful
purpose (emphasis added).

'HOW MUCH WILL YOU GIVE ME FOR THAT? IT'S CALLED A DOLLAR, AND IT'S NOT WORTH
A DAMN THING BACK HOME?'
In April 1970, after eighteen
months of deliberation, the
Senate of the Academic Council
recommended to President Lyman
that a Committee on Minority
Affairs (C.0.M.A.) be established
as a standing University
committee. The charge to
C.O.M.A. stated in part that it
"... shall formulate policy
concerning the improvement of
educational and social
opportunities at Stanford
University of members of
minority groups." This step was
viewed by many as a favorable
reflection of the University's
commitment to communities and
students of color.
However, last November, after
a very brief life, the Committee
on Committees recommended
that C.O.M.A. be dissolved and an
Ad Hoc Presidential Commission

be established in its place to
review .. the University's
programs and problems with
respect to minority affairs, and
with the recommendations
pertaining thereto." Thus, the
amount of time taken to
determine if C.O.M.A. should
exist was as long as C.O.M.A.'s
actual life span.
Dissolution
In recommending dissolution
of C.0.M.A., the Committee on
Committees made the following
comments:
In the best of all possible
worlds, there should probably be
no need for such a commission;
everything within its purview
probably falls within the charge to
some other existing body. Given
the realities of human frailties,
however, the University probably
needs stimulus from time to time
of a penetrating examination of
its status with respect to minority
affairs. The most effective body
to serve this function appears to
be a Presidential Commission
charged to report within a
specified time, The idea is that a
Presidential Commission on
Minority Affairs should be
activated periodically whenever it
is found to bes needed. The
Committee on "Committees is
assuming that such a commission
is needed now.
It is difficult to understand
how these comments can sustain
the recommendation. First,
certainly some committee's charge
may overlap the charges of other
committees. Even the Committee
on Committees understood that in
phrasing the initial charge to
C.0.M.A.:
Since the concerns of the
Committee do often coincide with
those of other committees and
administrative officers, this
Committee shall consult the
chairman of other committees of
administrative officers whenever
recommendations are being
considered which would effect
their responsibilities.
Camouflage
Thus, M why should this
acknowledged effect
now be presented as an argument
for dissolution? The camouflage
being used here is the assertion
that the interests of people of
color at Stanford can now be
incorporated into the routine
standard operating procedures of
existing officers, committees, etc.
"In the best of all possible
worlds," this would be true.
However, people of color at

Stanford are not in the best of all
or any possible worlds. Moreover,
it would be scores of years before
they will ever be considered a part
of the routine life of Stanford, if
ever.
Second, opposition must be
offered to any attempt to
euphemistically portray racism as
a mere innocent frailty. In
actuality, this 'frailty' is often
used by skillful tacticians as an
effective unifying force; or
perhaps this 'frailty' is a
reflection of a lack of true
commitment. By definition, no
university has to be reminded of a
commitment.
Progress Insufficient
Third, in the charge to
C.0.M.A., the Committee on
Committees stated:
Since the Committee's
achievements should gradually
eliminate the necessity of its
operation, the Committee shall,
from time to time, consider the
propriety of its own continuance.
Again, "in the best of all
possible worlds," this would be
true. But it would be grossly in
error to state that racial equality
at Stanford has now reached a
point where C.O.M.A. can be
downgraded, dissolved, or only
required to be activated every
four or five years in the form of a
Presidential Commission. To the
contrary, if racial progress at
Stanford is to be the criterion for
determining the level of activity
required by the University, then
C.O.M.A. should not be dissolved
or downgraded, but required to
compound its efforts.
Fourth, in recommending the
disestablishment of C.0.M.A., the
Committee on Committees
recommended that "as a standing
University committee, this body
would obviously be superseded by
an occasional Presidential
Commission on Minority Affairs"
(italics added). The words
"occasional" and "Ad Hoc"
bring to mind an attitude that
seems to prevail when the status
and interests of people of color
are being considered, not only
here but throughout the country.
People of color are often
perceived as marginal, peripheral,
secondary, temporary, and not of
full or complete standing.
Insulting
Such perceptions are to be
despised and rejected, especially
by one of the nation's leading
universities. The interests of
students and people of color must
be of the same, if not greater,
importance to Stanford.

'HOW MUCH WILL YOU GIVE ME FOR THAT? IT'S CALLED A DOLLAR, AND IT'S NOT WORTH
A DAMN THING BACK HOME?'
In April 1970, after eighteen
months of deliberation, the
Senate of the Academic Council
recommended to President Lyman
that a Committee on Minority
Affairs (C.0.M.A.) be established
as a standing University
committee. The charge to
C.O.M.A. stated in part that it
"... shall formulate policy
concerning the improvement of
educational and social
opportunities at Stanford
University of members of
minority groups." This step was
viewed by many as a favorable
reflection of the University's
commitment to communities and
students of color.
However, last November, after
a very brief life, the Committee
on Committees recommended
that C.O.M.A. be dissolved and an
Ad Hoc Presidential Commission

be established in its place to
review .. the University's
programs and problems with
respect to minority affairs, and
with the recommendations
pertaining thereto." Thus, the
amount of time taken to
determine if C.O.M.A. should
exist was as long as C.O.M.A.'s
actual life span.
Dissolution
In recommending dissolution
of C.0.M.A., the Committee on
Committees made the following
comments:
In the best of all possible
worlds, there should probably be
no need for such a commission;
everything within its purview
probably falls within the charge to
some other existing body. Given
the realities of human frailties,
however, the University probably
needs stimulus from time to time
of a penetrating examination of
its status with respect to minority
affairs. The most effective body
to serve this function appears to
be a Presidential Commission
charged to report within a
specified time, The idea is that a
Presidential Commission on
Minority Affairs should be
activated periodically whenever it
is found to bes needed. The
Committee on "Committees is
assuming that such a commission
is needed now.
It is difficult to understand
how these comments can sustain
the recommendation. First,
certainly some committee's charge
may overlap the charges of other
committees. Even the Committee
on Committees understood that in
phrasing the initial charge to
C.0.M.A.:
Since the concerns of the
Committee do often coincide with
those of other committees and
administrative officers, this
Committee shall consult the
chairman of other committees of
administrative officers whenever
recommendations are being
considered which would effect
their responsibilities.
Camouflage
Thus, M why should this
acknowledged effect
now be presented as an argument
for dissolution? The camouflage
being used here is the assertion
that the interests of people of
color at Stanford can now be
incorporated into the routine
standard operating procedures of
existing officers, committees, etc.
"In the best of all possible
worlds," this would be true.
However, people of color at

Stanford are not in the best of all
or any possible worlds. Moreover,
it would be scores of years before
they will ever be considered a part
of the routine life of Stanford, if
ever.
Second, opposition must be
offered to any attempt to
euphemistically portray racism as
a mere innocent frailty. In
actuality, this 'frailty' is often
used by skillful tacticians as an
effective unifying force; or
perhaps this 'frailty' is a
reflection of a lack of true
commitment. By definition, no
university has to be reminded of a
commitment.
Progress Insufficient
Third, in the charge to
C.0.M.A., the Committee on
Committees stated:
Since the Committee's
achievements should gradually
eliminate the necessity of its
operation, the Committee shall,
from time to time, consider the
propriety of its own continuance.
Again, "in the best of all
possible worlds," this would be
true. But it would be grossly in
error to state that racial equality
at Stanford has now reached a
point where C.O.M.A. can be
downgraded, dissolved, or only
required to be activated every
four or five years in the form of a
Presidential Commission. To the
contrary, if racial progress at
Stanford is to be the criterion for
determining the level of activity
required by the University, then
C.O.M.A. should not be dissolved
or downgraded, but required to
compound its efforts.
Fourth, in recommending the
disestablishment of C.0.M.A., the
Committee on Committees
recommended that "as a standing
University committee, this body
would obviously be superseded by
an occasional Presidential
Commission on Minority Affairs"
(italics added). The words
"occasional" and "Ad Hoc"
bring to mind an attitude that
seems to prevail when the status
and interests of people of color
are being considered, not only
here but throughout the country.
People of color are often
perceived as marginal, peripheral,
secondary, temporary, and not of
full or complete standing.
Insulting
Such perceptions are to be
despised and rejected, especially
by one of the nation's leading
universities. The interests of
students and people of color must
be of the same, if not greater,
importance to Stanford.
Comparatively, it is insulting that
the University can consider Public
Events, Tresidder Union, and
Athletics, Physical Education and
Recreation deserving of University
Committee standing, but not
people of color.
Fifth, the Committee on
Committees states that a
Presidential Commission would be
a more effective body to handle
minority affairs. The question can
be raised as to what a Presidential
Commission could do that a
University Committee could not.
No satisfactory answer has been
given to this question as yet.
Sixth, the Committee on
Committees suggests that
C.O.M.A. could not find a mission
for itself. With all of the problems
confronting people of color at
Stanford and at other universities,
this is unlikely. It is also an insult
to the people who served on
C.O.M.A.
C.O.M.A. did have a mission
and a major task that it adopted
late last year. That task involved
developing, implementing, and
continually monitoring
University-wide, long-range
policies and programs that pertain
to people of color. A difficult
task, but a necessary one. The
alleged failure on the part of
C.O.M.A. not to find itself should

not be viewed as a failing on
C.O.M.A.'s part, but perhaps a
failure of the Committee on
Committees to set forth in clear
and precise language C.O.M.A.'s
charge.
Lastly, although C.O.M.A. did
raise questions regarding the
clarity of its mission and the
overlapping of its responsibilities
with other committees, it did
make the following statement
regarding the continuation of
C.O.M.A.:
It appears that the University

Committee on Minority Affairs, as
presently charged, finds itself in a
great dilemma as to its role at
Stanfordâ– , University. On the one
hand, it is clear that the
University must draw attention to
the fact that it is seriously
concerned with minority affairs.
Therefore, it seems that the
establishment of a committee
specifically concerned with
minority affairs serves a useful
purpose (emphasis added).
