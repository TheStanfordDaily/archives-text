Editor:
Chris Hocker has outdone
himself. The logic displayed in his
recent column ("The Nixon
Budget") makes Tweedledee and
Tweedledum look like Plato and
Socrates.
Hocker asserts that the "liberal
plea for retention of so-called
'social services' can be refuted by
the repeated historical evidence of
failure by the government to act
effectively as omniscient Father
for his backward children." It's
not easy to deal With all of the
holes in that pompously
pleonastic prose, but I think the
effort is necessary.
For openers, a plea cannot be
refuted. It can be honored,
snubbed, or ignored, but not
refuted. Only a logical proposition
can be refuted or proved but
then, perhaps Mr. Hocker is
unfamiliar with logic.
Hocker alleges that social
welfare programs "have no chance
to succeed because
of.. . institutional incompetence
necessarily brought on by
bureaucracy." He implies that this
justifies the elimination of those
programs. However, although he
admits that "Military
programs ... suffer their share of
waste," he does not for one

moment suggest that they too be
scrapped. In other words, "Let's
trim governmental fat as long as
it's not MY fat."
What the budget needs what
the country needs is a series of
vast reforms. What nobody needs
at all is another blast of half-vast
rhetoric.

Stanford sterility has reached
its ugliest pinnacle the
cry-babies are bringing the
dog-catchers to campus! What an
ingenious plot they've devised:
unleashed dogs will be tagged,
followed by a fee of ten dollars
slapped on the owners.
Indeed, what a serious problem
we've had with dogs! Dog feces
every 300 yards, urine on every
seventh tree, bikes falling over like
dominoes, sandwiches viciously
snatched from the hands of
Tresidder customers, rabies
running rampant. The Dogs is
Coming! Run for your life!
All seriousness aside though,
why should good dog owners be
penalized for dogs that come to
class with them, sleep at their feet
for fifty minutes, then trot
alongside their owners' bikes
enroute to the next class, where
again the dog sleeps for another
fifty minutes? Granted, the dog is
unleashed, but certainly not out
of control. Are we to tolerate
some dog-catcher ambushing us
between classes, kidnapping our
dogs to throw them into the
Tresidder playpen for the bargain
of ten dollars? Fuck no!
I've just bided my time reading
all these crucial complaints about
dogs and their threat to the order
of this University. Humbug! It's
now time to declare war! So
student harassment of dogcatchers
has been mild lately? Well, I've
ordered Gus to attack all private
parts of any body who tries to
leash him. I urge all dog owners to
resist dog-catchers, and I alert all
dogs to unite, then bite.

every 300 yards, urine on every
seventh tree, bikes falling over like
dominoes, sandwiches viciously
snatched from the hands of
Tresidder customers, rabies
running rampant. The Dogs is
Coming! Run for your life!
All seriousness aside though,
why should good dog owners be
penalized for dogs that come to
class with them, sleep at their feet
for fifty minutes, then trot
alongside their owners' bikes
enroute to the next class, where
again the dog sleeps for another
fifty minutes? Granted, the dog is
unleashed, but certainly not out
of control. Are we to tolerate
some dog-catcher ambushing us
between classes, kidnapping our
dogs to throw them into the
Tresidder playpen for the bargain
of ten dollars? Fuck no!
I've just bided my time reading
all these crucial complaints about
dogs and their threat to the order
of this University. Humbug! It's
now time to declare war! So
student harassment of dogcatchers
has been mild lately? Well, I've
ordered Gus to attack all private
parts of any body who tries to
leash him. I urge all dog owners to
resist dog-catchers, and I alert all
dogs to unite, then bite.

Chris Hocker has outdone
himself. The logic displayed in his
recent column ("The Nixon
Budget") makes Tweedledee and
Tweedledum look like Plato and
Socrates.
Hocker asserts that the "liberal
plea for retention of so-called
'social services' can be refuted by
the repeated historical evidence of
failure by the government to act
effectively as omniscient Father
for his backward children." It's
not easy to deal With all of the
holes in that pompously
pleonastic prose, but I think the
effort is necessary.
For openers, a plea cannot be
refuted. It can be honored,
snubbed, or ignored, but not
refuted. Only a logical proposition
can be refuted or proved but
then, perhaps Mr. Hocker is
unfamiliar with logic.
Hocker alleges that social
welfare programs "have no chance
to succeed because
of.. . institutional incompetence
necessarily brought on by
bureaucracy." He implies that this
justifies the elimination of those
programs. However, although he
admits that "Military
programs ... suffer their share of
waste," he does not for one

moment suggest that they too be
scrapped. In other words, "Let's
trim governmental fat as long as
it's not MY fat."
What the budget needs what
the country needs is a series of
vast reforms. What nobody needs
at all is another blast of half-vast
rhetoric.
