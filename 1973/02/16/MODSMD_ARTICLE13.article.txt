Why won't the Tresidder store enable us to order newspapers
such as the New York Times in advance? An arrangement could
be worked out by which payment could be made in advance and
the paper held toward it could be picked up. This would be to the
store's advantage since more papers would be sold. W.T.
According to William Price, a store employee, the idea was
tried three or four years ago. It was discontinued when
bookkeeping got to be too much of a hassle. People didn't pay, or
they would forget to pick up their papers.
Price said that there are two boys who deliver papers to
on-campus residents, and that if anyone is interested in having a
paper delivered, they can leave their name and phone number at
the store.
What happened to the Pizza Parlour idea for the Encina Snack
Bar? H.P.
Don't despair—the idea hasn't been dropped. It was a "lower
priority item," according to Jerry Philpot, Acting Food Manager
for Tresidder. He says that the idea will be discussed in a few
weeks.
Gordon Starr, Financial Director of Tresidder, said that after
the idea is discussed a market survey must be made. Both he and
Philpot emphasized that it would take quite a while for a pizza
parlour to go into operation, if it ever did.
Philpot cited cost as a factor in the decision. He said that
converting Encina Snack Bar to a pizza parlour would entail
expensive and time-consuming rennovations. He said that it is
more likely that Encina will just add pizza to their menu,
although he did not rule out the possibility of total conversion.
The final decision will rest with Joe Xavier, who will become
Assistant General Manager of the Food Service on March 1.
Who selects the Sunday Flicks? M.G.
ASSU Sunday Flicks Manager Baker Terry claims full
responsibility for movie selection. He uses newspapers and
magazines such as Variety for references, taking factors such as
box office performance and distributors into consideration before
making a decision. According to Terry, his "primary
consideration is to draw large crowds. Often this takes precedence
over quality."
How much do Stanford's athletic coaches get paid? O.J.
Information on the salaries of faculty and staff members is
confidential. This reflects the University's philosophy that
individuals are entitled to a certain amount of privacy, according
to Emil J. Sarpa, Director of Personnel and Employee Relations.
Bug has gotten some questions on Daily circulation, which will
be lumped together under the general questions—does the Daily
have circulation problems? What can be done about them? Where
are Dalies delivered now?
Dean Funabiki, Daily Circulation Manager, said that there
were some problems with circulation in certain areas but they
were due to a misunderstanding between delivery workers, which
has been cleared up. The main problem now is that people take
more than their share of the Dailies that are distributed.
"We try to ration the papers in the best way we can," said
Funabiki. "We would appreciate cooperation from the
departments. It would help if they don't take more than they
need. We're even having shortages at the Daily because people
come in and take whole stacks of papers, which are supposed to
be for people in the area around the Storke Publications
Building."
Right now there are 113 drop-off-places for the Daily. The
main spots are: the Post Office, Tresidder, the Daily offices, the
Med School, math, geology, engineering and history corners of
the Quad, the Business School, Encina, and Wilbur and Stern
Halls.
Funabiki said, "Please call ext. 4630 and ask for the
Circulation Manager to report any excesses or deficiencies in
departments or drop-off points. With your cooperation we can
adjust the drop-off points to be as efficient as possible."
