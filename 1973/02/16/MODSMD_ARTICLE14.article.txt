# Dollar Devaluation May Not Help U.S.
## 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) - As the 10
percent dollar devaluation is
examined in critical detail over
the next few weeks you will hear
much speculation on why "it just
won't help improve our economic
condition."
How much truth, if any, there
is in each argument is hard to
ascertain, but for certain there is
the semblance of reason and logic
and fact—enough perhaps just to
get you into a good argument.
These are among the reasons
that will be offered:
—American customers of
foreign products will rush to buy
imports that already are
contracted for or are in stock in
hopes of beating price increases.
In so doing, they will add to
the inflationary pressures that still
exist in the economy and which
were among the factors that led to
the dollar crisis.

—Americans have enough
money so that they can afford to
ignore higher import prices,
especially if they have developed
brand loyalty, such as to Japanese
and German automobiles and
cameras.
Some imports succeed because
they are considered superior to
what is available domestically.
If Americans ignore the
higher prices—and some people
today can easily do so—the
desired effect of reducing imports
could be delayed or reduced.
—Devaluations don't help
restore a trade balance. If that was
the case, what happened to the
promised improvement in the U.S.
trade account after the
devaluation of December 1971?
The 1972 deficit didn't
decline; it jumped to $6.4 billion.
Many analysts foresee another
deficit this year, the third in a row
since 1971.
