# Quad Seeks To Publish Again
## 
### NANCI COLVERT 
Occupying space in the Storke
Publications Building, with a small
staff, a large inherited debt, two
bales of hay for a chair, and
increased motivation for
production this quarter, sit Carter
Schelling and the renovated
Stanford Quad.
"Playing it for real this time,"
Schelling hopes to produce, in
contrast to the traditional
yearbook, a soft cover volume of
quality photographs only which
will depict Stanford at a point in
time.
The first goal of the staff is to
establish a gallery in the Storke
building where professional
quality photographs can be
displayed and people can come
together for "thinking, chatting
and lounging."
And so, the straw bales, and
hopefully some plants.
According to Schelling, the
small staff was not willing last
quarter to give all else up to
produce the Quad.
Naive Approach
"We were too naive in our

approach to the gallery to attract
professionals," he said.
He attributed lack of response
to low expenditure and lack of
active recruiting. Those that did
come in gave valuable technical
advice about such things as
display technique.
If enough quality photographs
can be secured for the gallery,
publication will be considered.
No Pressure
The Quad has received a $5OO
appropriation from the
Publications Board, $4OO of
which is being held in trust. They
are under no pressure to produce
a book.
If they don't, Schelling sees the
establishment of the gallery as a
service to the community, as is
the retention of the name,
facilities, and petty cash fund of
the Quad.
He foresees a new resurgence
of yearbook interest in traditional
format sometime in the future, as
people's college experience begins
to take more traditional forms,
and wants to keep the Quad from
disbanding for this reason.
