# Faculty Couple Portrays Island Life
## 
### 
When the big white cruise ships
call at St. John's, Antigua, the
tourists who spend an afternoon
ashore rarely look beyond the
main streets and the swank hotels.
If they did, they would see
what a Stanford faculty couple
has captured and put into a book
called Antigua Black—Portrait of
an Island People.
The authors are Prof, and Mrs.
Gregson Davis. Davis, assistant
professor of classics and
comparative literature, wrote the
text. Mrs. Davis took the 66 black
and white portraits which
illustrate it.
Antigua Black tells the history
of the originally Spanish, then
French, then British island in the
Leeward group once known as the
British West Indies. It is near
Puerto Rico.
It is the same sorry story of
brutal mistreatment of black
Africans known everywhere—in
this case, slaves put to work in
the cane fields to produce the
island's then-and-now biggest cash
crop—sugar cane.
Little Social Progress
After emancipation, the blacks
still worked the cane as they do
today. The Davis' words and
pictures indicate that little social
progress has been made. The
British have left, but the island's
control still lies in the hands of
foreign capital.
Prof. Davis knows the island
well. He is a black native of St.
John's who was educated in the
island schools, was graduated
from Harvard, and holds a
doctorate in comparative
literature from UC-Berkeley.
Prof, and Mrs. Davis met and
married about five years ago at
UC, when he was a graduate
student and she was an
undergraduate majoring in French
and studying photography as a
hobby. They have an 18-month
old daughter, Anika.
They are faculty residents of

Otero House, Wilbur Hall, where
she teaches a freshman seminar in
photography. She pays tribute to
Dave Bohn of the ASUC Studio,
who helped launch her
photographic career.
She is an "adopted" native of
Antigua herself, sfye reports, since
her in-laws still live there.
Antigua Black also contains
"Ten Views of the Island of
Antigua"—copies of rare aquatints
by the English artist William
Clark, painted in 1823. They
depict the art of sugar-making in
the island at that time.
The Davis's will have to judge
the success of their book from
stateside mail. In June they will
be on their way to Europe on
sabbatical leave, after which they
will teach at the University's
Italian campus near Florence
during winter and spring quarters
of 1974.
Mrs. Davis, who attended
Bennington College before
transfering to UC-Berkeley, will
show some of her' Antiguan
photographs with the work of two
other women photographers at
the Focus Gallery, 2146 Union
St., San Francisco, from March 6
through 31.
The Davis' book evolved over
three or four years' discussion and
"six summers and one winter,"
during which Mrs. Davis took the
pictures.
Here Since 1968
Prof. Davis has been at
Stanford since 1968. He has
helped acquaint students with
some little-known Caribbean
authors—Poet Edward Brathwaite,
Novelist V.S. Naipaul, and
Playwright Derek Walcott.
Antigua, only 108 miles
square, is pronounced with a hard
"g" and with the "u" silent, Prof.
Davis explains.
"The island needs to become
more self-sufficient," he
acknowledges. "We need to grow
more of our own staples.
