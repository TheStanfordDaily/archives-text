# Student Opens Design Gallery
## Co-op Aids Craftsmen 
### 
Wendy West's discovery last
summer, when she was trying to
support herself as a craftsman,
that she was "buying retail and
selling wholesale" led her to the
founding of the Stanford Design
Co-op, which opened a gallery
in Tresidder Memorial Union on
Feb. 7.
"I, was making Batik hangings
and designing and sewing
clothing," says West, "and it was
very difficult locating the best
places to buy my materials and to
sell the finished products.
"I barely broke even for the
summer—which was all right—but
a local department store was
making a hundred percent profit
on the long skirts they bought
from me."
So when she returned to
Stanford as an English major in
the fall, West decided to try to
help other craftsmen overcome
the problems she had
encountered.
The result is the Stanford
Design Co-op, which allows artists
and craftsmen to lower the cost of
their materials by buying them in
bulk at wholesale rates, and the
Stanford Design Gallery, which
provides show space for the
products of their work.
One extra dividend of West's
work is the 11 academic credits
she earned through the Student
Center for Innovation and
Research in Education (SCIRE),

which assists students like West in
designing individual projects
suited to educational goals.
West's proposal, sponsored by
Nathan Oliveira, professor of art,
included researching the means to
establish the buying co-op and
gallery as well as reading books on
contemporary art, visual
communication, and popular art
criticism.
"I really learned a lot about
dealing with people and about
organizational problems," West
says. She found local gallery
directors remarkably helpful with
information and advice and was
delighted by the response the
project elicited from craftsmen
and artists in the University
community.
Lot of Energy
v 'Seventy people have already
contacted us even though there's
been no publicity except a few
posters and word-of-mouth.
That's what I thought—that there
is a lot of energy out there in
people isolated from each other; I
wanted to help connect them with
each other," she says.
Another important learning
experience was the process of
deciding which works could be
shown in the gallery, which is
located on the second-floor
balcony of Tresidder.
"We didn't want just to collect
candles and saficlals, and we don't
have a very large space. But

connecting theory and practice in
aesthetic judgments, when you're
face-to-face with the creator of a
particular piece, is really very
hard," she discovered.
Collected Information
In the course of her research,
West collected a lot of
information about where people
can show and sell their work and
where art and craft classes are
being offered in the area.
She is writing a handbook on
how to organize an artist's co-op
and gallery to aid other groups
with similar goals. The handbook
will be produced by SCIRE.
West is now working with three
other students and hopes to see
the buying co-op and gallery
expanded, perhaps with
workshops and a newsletter as
well.
