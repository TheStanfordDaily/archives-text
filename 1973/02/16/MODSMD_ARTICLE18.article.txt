# Profs Dilemma-Publish Or Perish
## 
### 
Most Stanford faculty members believe they've
been influenced by pressure to "publish or perish."
These findings emerge from a random sample
survey of 100 professors, conducted with support
from the University Fellows by Associate Prof.
Bradley Efron and Charlene Gay of the Department
of Statistics.
Nearly two-thirds felt that "publish or perish"
described their present or past position at Stanford
"accurately" (45%) or "very accurately" (20%). As
expected, this feeling was much more prevalent
among younger faculty without tenure than among
full professors.

"I'm up for tenure and feel I'll perish," one
commented. "I'll have to have a tremendous
amount of publications to survive."
Another observed that "a colleague of mine was
fired because even though he published a lot, it
wasn't of sufficient quality."
"Do it well or perish—and that means both
teaching and research," a third said. "These are
good criteria."
"I always did what I wanted to do and wrote
what I wanted to write, so I never was pushed by
anyone," another replied. "Life is too short to
march to someone else's tune."
