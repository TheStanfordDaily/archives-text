# Vienna Campus Ruling Delayed; Innovative Reforms Proposed
## 
### CHARLES BENNETT 
The Academic Council's Committee
on Foreign Studies has put off until
Tuesday further consideration of
proposals to continue an overseas
program in Vienna on an experimental
basis.
The committee met for about an
hour yesterday to consider a number
of ideas for reviving Stanford's Austria
program, among them a
recommendation from the Austria
subcommittee to maintain a smaller
campus in Vienna at the present
location.
Clark Reynolds, chairman of the
committee and a professor at the Food
Research Institute, told the Daily that
the committee was taking its
discussions seriously. This is going to
be "much more than a rehabilitation"
of the terminated Vienna campus,
Reynolds said.
Specifically, the chairman indicated
that the committee is working to
devise an experimental program that
will show how viable the
recommendations of the Presidential

Commission on Overseas Campuses
might be.
"This has to be regarded as a major
experimental undertaking," Reynolds
said. ,
In January, a presidential
commission chaired by Law Prof. John
Merry man recommended sweeping
reforms in the present overseas campus
system.
Included were suggestions that all
the programs be moved into major
cultural centers, and that they no
longer be enclaves of Americans, but
diversify by housing students in
various native environments in the
cities.
Reynolds stated that since Vienna
is the only urban campus at present, it
is the logical place to start an
experimental program. He noted that
the committee wants to maintain
continuity with staff and faculty at
the present campus, and that the
committee hopes to come up with an
idea designed to be implemented
starting in the fall, when the lease on
the Vienna campus building is
scheduled to die.

"This is not something that can be
done casually," said the committee
chairman. He emphasized that the
committee wanted to offer something
to the students that would be "solid,
meaty, and as exciting as it can
possibly be."
"I don't think we'll be doing
anything precipitous on this,"
Reynolds added.
Reynolds said he hopes that a
program recommendation can be made
to the Academic Senate by "the end
of the month or early March."
