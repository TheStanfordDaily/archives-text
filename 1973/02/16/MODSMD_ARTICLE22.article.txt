# THE 						FIGHTING MAN'S CODE OF CONDUCT
## 
### 
I. lam an American fighting
man. I serve in the forces which
guard my country and our way of
life. I am prepared to give my life in
their defense.
11. I will never surrender of my
own free will. If in command, I will
never surrender my men while they
still have the means to resist.
111. If I am captured, I will
continue to resist by all means
available. I will make every effort
to escape and aid others to escape. I
will accept neither parole nor
special favors from the enemy.
IV. If I become a prisoner of
war, I will keep faith with my
fellow prisoners. I will give no
information nor take part in any
action which might be harmful to
my comrades. If I am senior, I will

take command. If not, I will obey
the lawful orders of those
appointed over me and will back
them up in every way.
V. When questioned, should I
become a prisoner of war, I am
bound to give only name, rank,
service number and date of birth. I
will evade answering further
questions to the utmost of my
ability. I will make no oral or
written statements disloyal to my
country and its allies or harmful to
their cause.
VI. I will never forget that I am
an American fighting man,
responsible for my actions, and
dedicated to the principles which
made my country free. I will trust
in my God and in the United States
of America.
