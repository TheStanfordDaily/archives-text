# ‘Open College’ Considered

### 
SACRAMENTO (AP) - A
statewide "open college" system
for adult higher education has
been proposed to the legislature
by Sen. Mervyn Dymally (D-Los
Angeles).
It would be a "college without
walls" patterned after a British
system, and it would take its place
as the fourth level of state higher
education, Dymally said.
Dymally's bill would

appropriate $1 million to set up a
central administration, which
would administer classes at any
point in the state at whatever
facilities that may be available.
The college would not have its
own campus or buildings.
"It wouldn't be for high school
kids," Dymally said in an
interview, "but for adults who
have experience working in
certain fields.

"Take this young junior clerk
in the Senate for example,"
Dymally said. "He's working his
way through college. In the 'open
college' he could get credit for a
state government course because
of his experience here."
Wide use would be made of
closed-circuit television, he said,
and faculty members borrowed
from other colleges and
universities.
