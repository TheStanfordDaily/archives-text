# Student, 22, Likes Being Councilman

### 
Odia R. Chiles, at 22, might just be the
youngest municipal councilman in the
State of California.
If he isn't he has to be the only one who
is also a black Stanford undergraduate. A
political science major, he is a senior and
has hopes of going on to law school.
Last November, campaigning on a
"voice-of-youth" ticket, he won election to
the newly created East Palo Alto Municipal
Council—the only one of four candidates
to unseat an incumbent.
Since he has lived in East Palo Alto
from age four and was a graduate of
Ravenswood High School, he had a
ready-made constituency of * newly
enfranchised young voters.
They and others supported him to the
tune of more than 1700 votes, about 200
more than his nearest competitor.
"Odie," as everybody calls him, has a
great fellow feeling for his peers—"the
brothers in the streets." He came from that
milieu and he sincerely wants to see others
do as well as he has done.
Admitted to Stanford in the winter of
1969 when the number of black freshmen
doubled, he has received only one C grade
during his four years. "I've had a better
grade point average here than I ever had at
Ravenswood," he recalled the other day.
Personal Victory
He is just as pleased with his political
career so far. "It was a personal victory for
me," he said, "because I showed personally
I could do it and because I showed it could
be done." His term ends in 1974.
"If East Palo Alto is going to have a
future," he believes, "it's going to lie in its
youth."
Odie got a taste of politics two summers
ago when he served as an intern under Rep.
Don Edwards under the

Stanford-in-Washington program. Edwards,
a San Jose area Democrat, is an alumnus
and a graduate of Stanford Law School.
Odie also worked with a unique East
Palo Alto program called the Community
Youth Responsibility Program (CYRP). In
Odie's words, it "kept little brothers out of
jail" through juvenile crime prevention
programs and a court of their peers, which
meted out penalties to youthful offenders.
His entry into politics was somewhat
casual. Chatting with a group of friends,
one said to him, "Why don't you run?"
"So I thought, why not?"
Back Seat Headquarters
"I must have had the least expensive
campaign in the history of politics," Odie
recalls. "My headquarters were in the back
seat of my MG."
With the help of an old Ravenswood
buddy, Maurcie Bundy, Odie's cousin Joe
Porter, and Fred Johnson, they passed out
leaflets, talked him up wherever they got a
chance.
Following his election, he also paid
tribute to Rodney Brown, who urged him
to run, to Charles Ogletree and the Black
Student Union at Stanford for their help,
and to others "who only need their first
names," he said—"Rickey, Steve, and
Deane.
'Those already in the arena kind of
took me for granted," he said. "We made
them realize there's a youth movement out
there." Yet he was a little sad, because "of
all the people I know there, only a handful
helped."
"The only requirement," he said, "is
that you be dedicated and willing to do a
lot of leg work. Headquarters and
endorsements and all that stuff aren't
necessarily mandatory."
He still works with his peers as a kind of

missionary for youth in politics. "I try to
encourage them to indulge in this kind of
thing, I try to convince them that there is
not a great deal of expertise required to get
into the political arena and wherever
possible I try to use my appointive power
to appoint one of my colleagues.
"But it's been difficult," he said. "They
become disenchanted with the position.
But I try to explain to them that you
become competent through experience.
You have to get your head bumped, just
like all the others."
Odie knows. He has had to be his own
man since age 7. His father, a 14-year
veteran of the regular Army, died and left
his mother with six other youngsters.
It was virtually impossible to do
homework in a small East Palo Alto house
with the television on all the time and the
younger kids running through the kitchen
where he was trying to study.
Community Pressure
Then there was the pressure from the
black community itself. "On one side there
were my elders who said you're going to a
prestigious university, so get out there and
achieve something, and [hopefully] bring
it home."
"On the other hand there's my peer
group, who don't understand what I'm
trying to do, ostracizing me because I go to
a white boys' school. If I was praised in
class, they'd say to me, "what you trying
to do, be smart, get somewhere?" ',' My
philosophy about that is if you're going to
get [an education] you go to a white boys'
school, because a white boy's going to seek
self-preservation.
"If you send your son to my school,
you're going to see that he gets a good
education. If I'm sitting next to him and I
don't get it, it's because I've been

negligent.
"I've only had one C since I've been
here. I'm going to show there's a difference
between me and the brother standing on
the corner.
"All I'm saying to the brothers is: 'We
think along the same lines.' I didn't come
to Stanford to get affluent and-split and
move up on the hill.
"I hope to get rich, and I'd like to have
all the luxuries of life. If I'm going to have
a mansion I'd like to have it in East Palo
Alto. But if I have to have a barbed wire
fence around it and 200 watts of electricity
in it, I'm not coming home.
"That's my home and I love that
community, but I'm not going to let the
community destroy me," he said.
Odie has very clear views. Some of his
thoughts:
Black-white relations: For a while he
worked as a field representative for the
telephone company. He encountered
hostility from whites who found he had
come in at the same wage they had
achieved only after three or four years. "I
told them they'll have to make some
sacrifices because three or four years ago I
wouldn't have been able to get a job like
that."
He values integrity highly and feels his
white friends must be frank with him. "I
don't want passive or wishy-washy
responses in the relationship. If you can't
take me into your home, just tell me, don't
make some excuse. If you don't have
integrity, how can you call me your
partner? I say to them, don't promise me
nothin' that you can't do.' "
