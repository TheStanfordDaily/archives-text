# An Overview
## Hemingway's Life And Writings 
### DAVID BRENNER 
Jake Barnes, principal
character of Ernest Hemingway's
"The Sun Also Rises," was
reading Turgenev late one night
while drunk on brandy in Spain.
He speculated that one day
somewhere he would remember
everything, and what he had read
would seem the most real to him.
There must be a good many
readers, old and young, who
remember Hemingway
somewhere. And if he does not
seem the most real to them, at
least the memory is forever
present. It is hard to think of a
contemporary American author
who had more influence on
writing, or who reached a larger
audience, or who had more
publicity. And yet, despite all the
attention and praise, there were
sides to Hemingway's life and
obstacles to his work that the
public was unaware of.
The worst obstacle was both
physical and mental. Hemingway
was always taking risks, always
getting knocked on the head. As
Gertrude Stein said, "Ernest was
very fragile, whenever he did
anything sporting something
broke, his arm, his leg, or his
head."
Serious Wound /
In World War I he was badly
wounded in the leg at Fossalta di
Piave, hospitalized at Milan, and

decorated by the Italians. This
was the same wound which
"emasculated" Jake Barnes in
"The Sun Also Rises,"
hospitalized Lt. Henry in "A
Farewell to Arms," and left Col.
Cantwell scarred for life in
"Across the River and Into the
Trees."
During the second World War
he suffered two serious
concussions. One involved a scalp
wound which took 57 stitches to
close. He later complained to his
doctor about the after effects of
the wound: "terrible headaches,
slowness of thought and speech,
loss of verbal memory, a tendency
to write syllables backwards,
sporadic ringing of the ears, and
partial impairment of hearing."
He made a slow recovery, but
two airplane crashes in East Africa
in 1954 not only revived his old
symptoms, they also gave him
serious internal injuries from
which he never fully recovered. In
spite of all this, he returned to
Cuba and began writing once
again.
The amount of work he
accomplished there is astounding.
Besides the two novels he
published, there are also five
book-length manuscripts he left
behind. The shortest of these was
the collection of Paris sketches
which became A Moveable Feast
Three others were in such

disorganized states that they
probably will never be published.
The longest of the manuscripts,
based on his Caribbean
experiences, was the one he liked
to call his "sea novel" and which
now appears as "Islands in the
Stream."
It seems unfair to judge this
book as a whole in relation to his
other books because we have no
notion of what it might have
become if he had lived to finish it.
Unfortunately, fair or otherwise,
that is the only way it can be
judged. Furthermore, there is
evidence to indicate that
Hemingway did not consider the
book finished as it now stands.
To judge by length alone, parts
Two and Three are merely
sketched in. Part One is longer
than Parts Two and Three put
together, making the whole
structure as disproportionate as a
frog that is more head than body.
But Part Three reads much longer
than Part One. It seems likely that
Hemingway, given time, would
have corrected this and brought
the last two parts up to the level
of Part One, both in size and
quality.
Three Episodes
"Islands in the Stream"
consists of three episodes in the
life of Thomas Hudson, a painter
with three sons' by two marriages,
both of which ended in divorce.

In the first episode Hudson, living
alone on the island Bimini, is
visited by his sons. Soon after
they leave, he is notified that the
two youngest boys and their
mother have died in an
automobile accident.
The second episode takes place
in Havana, two winters after Pearl
Harbor. Here he learns that his
oldest son has been killed. He and
the boy's mother meet but quarrel
again, and Hudson leaves. "Get it
straight," he says to himself in the
obituary-terse Hemingway style,
"Your boy you lose, Love you
lose. Honor' has been gone for a
long time. Duty you do."
In the final episode Hudson
and his crew, aboard a fishing
boat armed as a decoy for
submarines, pursue a cripped
German U-boat. With a sense of
doom shared by all Hemingway
heroes, Hudson is sure he will be
the first to die when they catch
the Germans. But he stands on the
bridge, an open target, faithfully
doing his duty to the end.
Only Part
Thus, "Islands in the Stream"
is only a part of the war novel
Hemingway had planned to write.
It is not one of his major works;
the terrain from good to bad is
quite hilly and rugged. To be sure,
Part One has more summits than
canyons, while the latter sections
have some vast chasms.
In Part Two the female
character, as mother of Thomas
Hudson's oldest son, is as plastic
and unreal as the fairy-godmother
heroine of "Across the River and
Into the Trees," his worst book.
