But as overwritten as that book
was, and it left only John O'Hara
and Carlos Baker as its defenders,
it was never boring. Hemingway
made the book into self-parody,
not yawning dullness.
Part Three, however, has the
interminable and fruitless and
boring chase of the U-boat. The
whole scene smacks of the same
Rover Boys heroism that was only
barely noticeable in "For Whom
the Bell Tolls." It seems that
Hemingway would have found it
difficult to make anyone take the
chase as seriously as he appeared
to take it. Viewed from this late
date, the Pilar's (Hudson's boat)
role as submarine chaser hardly
seems a significant one, much less
the stuff from which legends are
molded.
Paris Reminiscences
But, although in places this
book reaches for some new
Hemingway lows, there is other
terrain which comes close to his
previous peaks. There are Paris
reminiscences which rival the level
of "A Moveable Feast." There is
young David Hudson's day long
fight with a giant broadbill, so
suggestive of "The Old Man and
the Sea." There is Hudson's
drinking with Honest Lil, the
queen of all the Havana whores.
But it is finally a question of
whether these highs can
overshadow the low of the chase
scene, which should be the best
sequence of all. It calls for

comparison with the bridge
dynamiting in "For Whom the
Bell Tolls," but loses by the
summons. Hudson's dismal sense
of duty seems contrived and
depthless when matched with
Robert Jordan's fierce maze of
passions.
Perhaps the weakness of the
book is the similarity of Thomas
Hudson to Hemingway. To be
sure, most of Hemingway's fiction
was autobiographical, but never
has there been less distance
between Hemingway and his hero.
Broken Discipline
Consequently, the writer was
almost completely uncritical of
him. The discipline which once
kept Hemingway from the
Self-indulgence of chronicling his
every opinion and taste has
completely broken down.
Moreover, this novel is quite
different, from, say "A Farewell
to Arms." In his early years,
Hemingway was the master of the
understatement. This allowed him
to produce apparently simple
works which were, in fact, quite
complex. The prose of "Islands in
the Stream" is more graceful and
less tense than his earlier style;
there is almost no use of
understatement. Consequently,
the feeling of urgency that
Hemingway once generated so
well is lacking.
The book hardly hints at any
deep qualities other than
Hudson's feeling of despair. This,
the author explains, is caused by
the death of Hudson's three sons.
But sensing the similarity of
Hudson and Hemingway, the
reader is likely to perceive that
the despair is based on the same
feeling in the author, and that the
sons are merely blood sacrifices to
the rhetoric of fiction.
That Hemingway could still
write masterful prose is
demonstrated by"A Moveable
Feast." That he was able to put
the material into published shape

certainly shows he could have
done the same yvith "Islands in
the Stream," given the time to
rework the second and third
sections as he must have done the
first.
Unmistakable Stamp
Nevertheless, in spite of its
flaws, this is a daring, often
funny, and swaggering book that
bears the unmistakable
Hemingway stamp. It gives one a
new respect for the efforts of his
later years. Handicapped as he was
by illness, he continued to write
almost to his untimely and tragic
end.
Whether or not he told us of
his troubles is something that
nobody can answer now. But
there was one sentence in "Indian
Camp" that, in retrospect, seems
to cast an errie glow on his end. It
was the reply that Nick's father
gave to a question about suicide:
"He couldn't stand things, I
guess."
At the very end he found that
he had been too deeply wounded
to write even a single sentence.
Maybe he couldn't stand that.
Maybe he couldn't stand not
being the champion. Or maybe,
like his own Santiago, even in
defeat he was finally victorious.
That was something he never told
anyone.
