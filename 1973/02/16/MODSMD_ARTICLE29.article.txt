# Jane Fonda's A Hooker, Again
## 
### JON R. KENNEDY 
"Jane Fonda's up to her old tricks again."
That's how Warner Bros.' publicity describes
Fonda's role in their new film, "Steel Yard
Blues," in which she plays a hooker, that is to
say, a whore.
Jane Fonda won an Academy Award once
for playing a prostitute, in "Klute," and
afterwards told someone that's the kind of
role she prefers. That puts her (appropriately,
I think) in a somewhat exceptional class.
Where many actors prostitute themselves in a
more or less professional sense, playing
anything they get paid for, Fonda refuses to
be a professional prostitute while preferring to
be a fantasy one.
It's not, I'm sure, that she had problems
relating to her father as a child or that she has
never had personal love so she craves many
lovers as in the case of real-life prostitutes (or
so we're sometimes told). Her motives are
much purer, less Freudian, and far more
political.
By playing fantasy prostitutes she can get
underneath the American Way and show it for
all she thinks it's worth. In "Steel Yard Blues"
her ranking customer is a district attorney
running for state attorney general on a
platform built around his personal,
impeccable, reputation. See kids, Jane's
getting the chance to say; see what this
country's all about? In the good old USA

everything is qualified by a price in good old
hard inflated cash. Sex? Pshaw! Even
attorneys general.
In a sense she's like the biblical prophet,
Hosea, though not as literal. God told Hosea
to marry an unfaithful wife, one who bore
him children fathered by God only knew
whom. The society which recognized Hosea as
a Prophet stood aghast to see its number one
spiritual example resorting to such a low
lifestyle. "But the point is," God is quoted as
saying in reply; "the point is physical adultery
on the level practiced by Hosea is nothing
compared with the spiritual adultery you
people who call yourselves by My Name are
into." The Hoseas and Jane Fondas are small
potatoes compared to kings and attorneys
general who fail to keep their own laws, to
carry out justice and provide for their people's
welfare.
Third-Rate
That's what Jane Fonda's hooking is all
about. And that's what "Steel Yard Blues" is
all about, which explains why an otherwise
third-rate movie attracted the talents of
Fonda, Donald Sutherland, and Peter Boyle in
the lead roles.
I say it's third rate because that's what the
critics are going to call it; after all, Warner
Bros, wasn't even going to release it, Peter
Boyle said in San Francisco last week, until
preview audiences actually laughed at it and

seemed to enjoy it.
Critics don't know what to do with a film
like "Steel Yard Blues." There is this genre
that is in a class all by itself: "Zachariah,"
"The Magic Garden of Stanley Sweetheart,"
"What's Up Doc?" are more a parody on films
and filmmaking than they are just films
themselves. "Myerson," the former
Committee director who made "Steel Yard
Blues," "doesn't know what to do with a
camera," one of the San Francisco critics told
me.
But it doesn't much matter what you do
with the camera; when you have material like
the cast and message of "Steel Yard Blues,"
people will pay to see it anyway.
The message is simple, and you get it just
by reading the film's newspaper ads: "If you
can't beat 'em, drive 'em crazy." But it's so
subtly and comically done that you have to
see it. There's no psychologizing about
mechanizing our culture, just a couple of kids
who never grew up hooked on demolition
derbies, determined to smash up a 1953
Studebaker because that's the last car made
that they've never wrecked. And there isn't
any anti-military-industrial harrangue, no
preaching against political corruption and
duplicity, just a rip-off of an air force base
and a would-be state attorney general who
can't even relate to his own brother.
So be sure to see it. Everybody else will.

A BLACK EYE That's what happens to girls like Jane Fonda in pictures like "Steel Yard Blues," the new
Warner Bros, production. She plays a hooker who falls in love with a thief and turns down the thief's
brother. Produced by Tony Bill and Michael and Julia Phillips, the movie co-stars Peter Boyle. It was
directed by Alan Myerson.

Jane Fonda won an Academy Award once
for playing a prostitute, in "Klute," and
afterwards told someone that's the kind of
role she prefers. That puts her (appropriately,
I think) in a somewhat exceptional class.
Where many actors prostitute themselves in a
more or less professional sense, playing
anything they get paid for, Fonda refuses to
be a professional prostitute while preferring to
be a fantasy one.
It's not, I'm sure, that she had problems
relating to her father as a child or that she has
never had personal love so she craves many
lovers as in the case of real-life prostitutes (or
so we're sometimes told). Her motives are
much purer, less Freudian, and far more
political.
By playing fantasy prostitutes she can get
underneath the American Way and show it for
all she thinks it's worth. In "Steel Yard Blues"
her ranking customer is a district attorney
running for state attorney general on a
platform built around his personal,
impeccable, reputation. See kids, Jane's
getting the chance to say; see what this
country's all about? In the good old USA

everything is qualified by a price in good old
hard inflated cash. Sex? Pshaw! Even
attorneys general.
In a sense she's like the biblical prophet,
Hosea, though not as literal. God told Hosea
to marry an unfaithful wife, one who bore
him children fathered by God only knew
whom. The society which recognized Hosea as
a Prophet stood aghast to see its number one
spiritual example resorting to such a low
lifestyle. "But the point is," God is quoted as
saying in reply; "the point is physical adultery
on the level practiced by Hosea is nothing
compared with the spiritual adultery you
people who call yourselves by My Name are
into." The Hoseas and Jane Fondas are small
potatoes compared to kings and attorneys
general who fail to keep their own laws, to
carry out justice and provide for their people's
welfare.
Third-Rate
That's what Jane Fonda's hooking is all
about. And that's what "Steel Yard Blues" is
all about, which explains why an otherwise
third-rate movie attracted the talents of
Fonda, Donald Sutherland, and Peter Boyle in
the lead roles.
I say it's third rate because that's what the
critics are going to call it; after all, Warner
Bros, wasn't even going to release it, Peter
Boyle said in San Francisco last week, until
preview audiences actually laughed at it and

seemed to enjoy it.
Critics don't know what to do with a film
like "Steel Yard Blues." There is this genre
that is in a class all by itself: "Zachariah,"
"The Magic Garden of Stanley Sweetheart,"
"What's Up Doc?" are more a parody on films
and filmmaking than they are just films
themselves. "Myerson," the former
Committee director who made "Steel Yard
Blues," "doesn't know what to do with a
camera," one of the San Francisco critics told
me.
But it doesn't much matter what you do
with the camera; when you have material like
the cast and message of "Steel Yard Blues,"
people will pay to see it anyway.
The message is simple, and you get it just
by reading the film's newspaper ads: "If you
can't beat 'em, drive 'em crazy." But it's so
subtly and comically done that you have to
see it. There's no psychologizing about
mechanizing our culture, just a couple of kids
who never grew up hooked on demolition
derbies, determined to smash up a 1953
Studebaker because that's the last car made
that they've never wrecked. And there isn't
any anti-military-industrial harrangue, no
preaching against political corruption and
duplicity, just a rip-off of an air force base
and a would-be state attorney general who
can't even relate to his own brother.
So be sure to see it. Everybody else will.
