# Nixon To Scuttle OEO; Opposition Anticipated
## 
### From the Associated Press 
WASHINGTON - The Nixon
administration has devised a detailed
plan that calls for dismantling the
Office of Economic Oportunity before
Congress can come to its rescue.
The elaborate strategy, listing
arguments the administration should
use to support its case, the people in
Congress it should work with and the
obstacles it can expect to face, urges
"completing the disagreeable business
as soon as possible."
"The more delay, the more
opportunity for congressional
opposition to gather and develop a
legislative counter-strategy," says the
paper, which was prepared by the
OEO's technical staff. A copy has been
made available to The Associated
Press.
Entitled "Congressional Strategy on
OEO," the paper advises against a
clash over constitutional powers with
Congress, which last year extended the
OEO and its many programs through
fiscal 1974.
President Nixon's budget for fiscal
1974 calls for ending federal support
for Community Action the main
OEO-sponsored antipoverty program
and scattering its remaining
programs among other agencies.
The paper lists the senators and
representatives who can be considered
friendly to the administration plan and
suggests that Sens. Bill Brock

(R-Tenn.), or Roman L. Hruska
(R-Neb.), lead the effort in the Senate.
The paper warns that opposition
"highly vocal, threatening and
derogatory" can be expected from
Sens. Alan Cranston (D-Calif), Jacob
K. Javits (R-N.Y.), Gaylord Nelson
(D-Wis.), Walter F. Mondale (D-Minn.),
and Robert Taft Jr. (R-Ohio).
"However," it adds, "the depth of
expressed concerns can be questioned
because primary interests lie elsewhere
now."
The administration can also expect
protest demonstrations by Community
Action workers and their supporters,
the paper says, and should begin now
to develop adverse reactions to them.
To deal with the expected criticism
from such groups and Congress, the
paper says, the administration should
portray Community Action that has

failed to help the poor in the eight
years of its existence.
"The argument would stress,
instead, a picture of agitation,
destructive unrest, diversion of federal
funds to support partisan political
activity, administrative waste, criminal
misuse of funds and a program
structure which exacerbated rather
than resolved racial problems," the
paper says.
There is one possible soft spot in
the administration's case. It is the fact
that in 1969 when Nixon first
disclosed his intention to transfer most
OEO programs to other agencies, he
praised the original purpose of OEO in
studying and combatting the problems
of the poor and promised to preserve
it.
No suggestion is offered for dealing
with that problem.
