# Local News Provides Entertainment
## 
### GEORGE DOBBINS 
We direct this column to those
who call television unintellectual,
barbaric, a waste of time and the
last resort in other words, most
Stanford students. Ah, but do not
give up all together; television has
one redeeming set of
programming the local news.
It is these productions that tell
us how our individual area relates
to the cosmic scheme of the
Universe. And, let's face it, if we
don't buy that balony, at least we
enjoy being entertained.
Entertainment seems to be a
primary goal of local news to
the point where we value the
personality of the newscaster over
his subject matter.
But the entertainment
approach in news, has proven
successful. In Honolulu, it is not
uncommon for a sportscaster to
don a fur cap, with two bull horns
eminating from the front, and
chase the anchorman around the
studio. In Los Angeles, George
Putnam, television's highest paid
local newscaster (over $350,000 a
year), has a studio audience that
asks questions.
San Francisco newsmen are not
quite as show-biz oriented, but
they too have come a long way.
We feel a need to acknowledge
their accomplishments; so,
without further explanation, our
1973 awards for achievement in
local news:
THE LAUGH A MINUTE
AWARD: to KGO, Channel 7,
"Newscene." This show is our
favorite; it manages to combine
humor with news to present "the

sights and sounds of today," as
anchorman Van Amburg puts it.
Amburg, Jerry Jensen,
sportscaster John O'Reiley and
weatherman Pete "Doc" Giddings
make up the "News Gang." And
boy are they funny particularly
Jerry, who can't control himself
and laughs at anything from
people's misfortunes to a leaf
falling. Even if he can't get
through all the news, we get the
general idea.
We commend "Action Seven"
reporter John Brian, who answers
letters of complaint sent in by
frustrated viewers, if not on
television then by mail. We also
like the idea of hiring Kama Small
as a reporter she has indeed
risen above the mere status of a
weather girl.
THE IT DOESN'T WORK
AWARD: to KPIX, Channel 5.
"Eyewitness News" used to be
our favorite until the station
management changed it to the
"Eyewitty News" and ended up
with the "Eyewitless News."
Currently, anchormen Joe
Glover, Ron Magers and Ben
Williams are an unclever trio
pretending to go far beyond their
powers of intelligence. Glover, the
best of the bunch, cannot even
extricate himself because of the
dolts surrounding him, the worst
being reviewer Rolfe Peterson, the
personification of nausea.
Barry Thompkins, alias Mr.
Adenoids, and Steve Somers, who
looks like a chipmunk, do a
decent job of sports coverage but
cannot ad lib. The remedy for this
newscast turn it into one.

THE WE TRY HARDER
AWARD: to KTVU, Channel 2.
First, it was "Deadline Ten p.m."
then the "Tuck-Fortner Report"
(don't ask how that was
mispronounced), and now, the
"Ten O'Clock News." These
people really persevere they
even use the Putnam theme song.
Unfortunately, anchormen
George Reading and Gary Park
often appear amateurish
particularly when they converse
about world affairs. In a typical
situation, George will turn to
Gary, say "What do you think?"
and watch Gary stammer and
pause only to exclaim, "We 11... I
don't know." Our advice to them
report the news; don't discuss
it.
Channel 2's reporters have
done some outstanding features
on topics ranging from
prostitution to gourmet dining.
Claude Mann is the veteran
reporter; perhaps the most
interesting is weatherman Bob
Wilkins, of "Creature Feature"
fame. His humor is most welcome
we'll never forget last fall, when
Stanford was going to play the
University of Washington in
football; he commented, "The
Bay area forecast is rain but it'll
be Sonny (Sixkiller) in' Palo
Alto."

THE LET'S GET SERIOUS
AWARD: to KRON, Channel 4,
"Newswatch." The. problem here
is well stated by anchorman Dave
Valentine, "WE don't kid around
because newsgathering is a serious
business." True, Art Brown, Phil
Wilson and Valentine are excellent
newsmen but how can such
serious reporters hope to hold our
attention? Fortunately, there is
sportscaster Eddie Alexander,
who speaks like a KFRC radio
alumnus, and weather girl Terry
Lawry, who writes backwards.
How could we live without
gimmicks?
THE WE AIN'T GOT
GIMMICKS AWARD: to KQED,
Channel 9. These people think
■■ they can survive without
gimmicks. "Newsroom" was the
first show of its kind featuring
reporters in person talking about
stories they covered. No elaborate
film footage no elaborate sets
just a discussion.
Look how everyone else has
improved that idea. True, host
Mel Wax and his crew present the
best local news, but they don't
even reveal their personalities. All
they give us is an intellectual
discussion of the news. And we
want entertainment. What other
reason is there for" watching tele
vision?
