# Introspective Arterberry Shows Potential
## 
### BILL CLASTER 
While the Stanford basketball
team's record of 9-9 represents a
slight improvement over the last
few years, many critics are stil
unsatisfied. Much of the play this
year has been erratic, and as a
result, the Cardinals have lost a
few games they should have won.
Many fans place the blame for this

inconsistency on the guard
position, as memories of Claude
Terry still linger on. Admittedly
there are no superstars in the
backcourt this year, but there
unquestionably are some solid
young ball players there.
6- 3V2 sophomore Mel
Arterberry is perhaps the brightest
of the guard prospects. A

combination of excellent
quickness, fine jumping ability,
and good court sense provide
Arterberry with the basic physical
and mental fundamentals that a
top-flight guard must have. Only
his overall shooting ability has yet
to develop, and Mel is steadily
making progress in this crucial
area.

As a senior in high school,
Arterberry was instrumental in
leading his Crenshaw team to the
Los Angeles city championship.
The second leading scorer and top
all-around player on that squad,
Mel was highly recruited all over
the nation. An honor student with
a 3.6 grade average, he narrowed
his final choices to Notre Dame,
Harvard, Nebraska, and Stanford.
He chose the latter, because in
his words, "I wanted to go to a
university with a good basketball
program and a school that put
primary emphasis on academics. It
also was important to me that I
didn't go to a huge university with
20,000 students."
Getting Around
Although Arterberry had no
trouble adjusting to college
basketball (he was the second
leading scorer and rebounder on
last year's freshman team), he was
somewhat disappointed with
Stanford in his first year. "I guess
I just expected more of it at first.
It made a big difference in that I
did not have any means of getting
around. Now that I have a car and
can get out when I want, I really
enjoy this place."
An economics major who plans
to go into accounting, Mel greatly
values his privacy. A Roble
resident, he is a quiet and highly
introspective person. He notes,
"I've always been basically the
silent type. I like to keep pretty
much to myself."
His introspective manner
becomes evident when he talks
about this season. "I've been a
little disappointed so far," he
says. "Most everybody thought
we'd be doing better. Personally
I've made far too many mistakes
on the court in terms of my

all-around play. I'd much rather
play a good all-around game than
score a lot of points. Scoring is
fun, but I almost prefer making a
good assist or playing tough
defense."
Arterberry is currently
averaging 6.7 points a game and is
shooting 42 percent from the
field. He is a superb driver who
makes spectacular driving lay-ups
seem routine. His outside
shooting, though, is another story.
Changing Style
Mel simply has not yet
developed a good outside touch.
He is a streaky line-drive shooter
who really doesn't have that much
confidence in his outside shot.
Currently Arterberry is trying to
change his style by putting more
arch in his shot.
If he does overcome this
weakness, Arterberry will have it
all. His quickness and anticipation
probably make him the Cardinal's
best defensive player. He is a good
dribbler, and like his backcourt
mate, 6-0 Mark Gilberg, has a
knack for getting the pass to the
open man.
Thus Mel is on the verge of
becoming the top-flight guard that
Stanford desperately needs.
Most of all, he has an excellent
attitude. Mel is the type of player
who is rarely satisfied. Defense,
passing, and scoring are all equally
important to him. It is essentially
this attitude which gives both
Arterberry and Stanford strong
possibilities for future success.
