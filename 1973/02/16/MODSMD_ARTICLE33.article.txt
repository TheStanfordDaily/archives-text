# 15 Free Passes
## Walks Lift Cards Past Gaels 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
Two St. Mary's pitchers had trouble locating the
plate yesterday at Sunken Diamond, and Stanford
graciously accepted 15 walks and a 7-3 victory.
St. Mary's starter Paul Gilmartin was charged
with 14 of the walks in seven and two-thirds innings.
Stanford's Mickey Aguirre and Kim Hannaford each
reached first base four times on bases on balls.
The Cards rolled to their third victory in three
outings behind the pitching of Mike Higgins, Jim
Dudley, Bob DiPietro, and Andy Bielanski. Higgins
opened the game with two perfect innings. Dudley
struggled in the next three frames, allowing two
runs three hits. Dudley left the game with a 3-2
lead, however, and was credited with the victory.
DiPietro looked sharp in his two inning stint, his
first appearance of the season. The junior
southpaw's performance was marred only by a walk
to the first batter he faced. DiPietro retired the next
six batters in order, fanning two.
Bielanski Breezes
Bielanski wrapped up the victory as he coasted
home in the final two frames. The Gaels scored once
in the ninth, but by then the issue had already been
decided.
Stanford managed only four hits in the game and
the Cards will have to improve in that department
this weekend when they host Santa Clara and

Fresno State, always two of the tougher collegiate
teams in California.
The Broncos, who will play the Cards at 2:30
this afternoon at Sunken Diamond; have won the
West Coast Athletic Conference seven years in a
row. Stanford will host Fresno State tomorrow in a
12 noon doubleheader.
Coach Ray Young will send A1 Arthur, Ken
Grolle, and Nick Peterson to the mound against
Santa Clara today, with Dan Shaw, Max Goldstein,
Higgins, and DiPietro all scheduled to pitch
tomorrow. Pitching coach Tom Dunton expects to
see Dan Grimm on the mound for Fresno State in
one of tomorrow's games. Grimm was one of two
pitchers to shutout the Cards last year.
Suicide Squeeze
Yesterday's game against the Gaels was sloppy,
but a handful of fans was treated to several exciting
plays. Stanford got on the scoreboard for the first
time in the second inning. With runners on second
and third and none out, Higgins successfully
executed a suicide squeeze play, bunting the ball
down the third base line as Mickey Aguirre came in
to score uncontested.
Later in the game Bob Reece emptied the bases
with a sharp single to right-center, scoring three
Stanford runners and icing the Card victory.
Reece, Bob Hampton, A1 O'Brien, and Glen
Johnson got the only hits for Stanford while the
Gaels managed three safeties, two charged to
Dudley and one to Bielanski.
