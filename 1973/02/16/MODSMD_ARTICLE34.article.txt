# Tennis Team Defeats Irvine Despite Absence Of Stars
## 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
Even without its top two
players, Stanford's tennis team
still managed to beat a good UC
Irvine team 6V2-2V2 here yesterday.
With Sandy Mayer and Jim
Delaney warming up for a
tournament in Salisbury, N.C.,
Rick Fisher played first singles for
the Cardinals. Fisher had his
hands full with Irvine's Bob
Chappell, who beat him 7-5, 6-4.
Fisher won his service with
much more ease than did Chappell
early in the match, but the Irvine
star, one of the nation's best
small-college players, got the first
service break of the match at 5-5
in the first set and went on from
there.
Stanford won at second at
third singles, the other matches on
the main varsity courts that a
good crowd watched. At No. 2,
Gery Groslimond topped Greg
Jablonski, while Pat DuPre,

serving strongly, won at third over
Randy Schneider, both by the
identical score of 6-2, 7-5.
At fourth singles, John
Whitlinger aced Glen Cripe, 6-0,
6-0, but at fifth, Chip Fisher lost
to Scott Canahan, 6-3, 6-7, 7-6,
the last two sets being decided by
nine-point tiebreaker. At sixth
singles, Paul Sidone beat Bob
Wright 6-4, 6-4.
Doubles Matches
In the doubles matches,
Groslimond and Rick Fisher, one
of the nation's top teams, beat
Chappell and Jablonski, 7-6, 6-4.
At second doubles, Whitlinger
and Chip Fisher beat Cripe and
Schneider an easy 6-2, 6-0. In the
third doubles match, DuPre and
Mark Mitchell split two sets with
Irvine's Carnahan and Wright, 6-4,
4-6, when the meet, held on a
beautiful sunshiny day, was called
on account of darkness, thus
producing the final split-point

score.
Today the team takes on Cal
State Bakersfield at the Varsity
Courts beginning at 2:30 p.m. An
interesting thing about this meet
is that Dennis Ralston,
Bakersfield's coach and a former
U.S. champion, is scheduled to
play first singles.
Major Tourney
After that will come the
Northern California
Intercollegiates, to be held at
Berkeley Feb. 21-24. With Mayer
and Delaney being joined by
DuPre at the Salisbury tourney,
the Cards' lineup will look like
this:
Singles: 1. Rick Fisher, 2.
Groslimond, 3. Whitlinger, 4. Chip
Fisher, 5. Sidone, 6. Mitchell.
Doubles: 1. Rick Fisher and
Groslimond, 2. Chip Fisher and
Whitlinger, 3. Jake Warde and

WHITWASH - John Whitlinger, one of Stanford's star freshman
tennis players, yesterday beat his opponent from UC Irvine 6-0, 6-0.
Whitlinger recently delighted his home-state fans by going undefeated
at the National Indoor Championships in Madison, Wis. He hails from
nearby Neenah.
Even without its top two
players, Stanford's tennis team
still managed to beat a good UC
Irvine team 6V2-2V2 here yesterday.
With Sandy Mayer and Jim
Delaney warming up for a
tournament in Salisbury, N.C.,
Rick Fisher played first singles for
the Cardinals. Fisher had his
hands full with Irvine's Bob
Chappell, who beat him 7-5, 6-4.
Fisher won his service with
much more ease than did Chappell
early in the match, but the Irvine
star, one of the nation's best
small-college players, got the first
service break of the match at 5-5
in the first set and went on from
there.
Stanford won at second at
third singles, the other matches on
the main varsity courts that a
good crowd watched. At No. 2,
Gery Groslimond topped Greg
Jablonski, while Pat DuPre,

serving strongly, won at third over
Randy Schneider, both by the
identical score of 6-2, 7-5.
At fourth singles, John
Whitlinger aced Glen Cripe, 6-0,
6-0, but at fifth, Chip Fisher lost
to Scott Canahan, 6-3, 6-7, 7-6,
the last two sets being decided by
nine-point tiebreaker. At sixth
singles, Paul Sidone beat Bob
Wright 6-4, 6-4.
Doubles Matches
In the doubles matches,
Groslimond and Rick Fisher, one
of the nation's top teams, beat
Chappell and Jablonski, 7-6, 6-4.
At second doubles, Whitlinger
and Chip Fisher beat Cripe and
Schneider an easy 6-2, 6-0. In the
third doubles match, DuPre and
Mark Mitchell split two sets with
Irvine's Carnahan and Wright, 6-4,
4-6, when the meet, held on a
beautiful sunshiny day, was called
on account of darkness, thus
producing the final split-point

score.
Today the team takes on Cal
State Bakersfield at the Varsity
Courts beginning at 2:30 p.m. An
interesting thing about this meet
is that Dennis Ralston,
Bakersfield's coach and a former
U.S. champion, is scheduled to
play first singles.
Major Tourney
After that will come the
Northern California
Intercollegiates, to be held at
Berkeley Feb. 21-24. With Mayer
and Delaney being joined by
DuPre at the Salisbury tourney,
the Cards' lineup will look like
this:
Singles: 1. Rick Fisher, 2.
Groslimond, 3. Whitlinger, 4. Chip
Fisher, 5. Sidone, 6. Mitchell.
Doubles: 1. Rick Fisher and
Groslimond, 2. Chip Fisher and
Whitlinger, 3. Jake Warde and
Craig Johnson.
