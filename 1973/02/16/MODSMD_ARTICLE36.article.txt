# Trackmen Compete In Idaho
## 
### PHIL HUBBARD 
Several members of the
Stanford track squad are flying up
to Pocatello, Idaho, this weekend
to participate in the Cards' final
Indoor meet of the season, the
Bennion Relays, at Idaho State
University.
Saturday afternoon, the
preliminary heats of the 70 yard
high hurdles will have John
Anderson and Dave Bagshaw
fighting for a chance to run in the
finals that evening at 7:35.
The hurdle finals will be
followed by the 880 relay.
Running for the Cards will be
John Kessel, John Anderson, Matt
Hogsett, and Ken Curl.
They will be followed an hour
later by the sprint medley team of
Curl, Kessel, Anderson, and
Bagshaw. Curl and Kessel will run
110 yards, Anderson 220, and
Bagshaw 440.
One of Stanford's stronger
events should be the distance
medley. Les McFadden will lead
off with a 1320, Kenny Kring will
follow with a 440, Bruce Wolfe
will run an 880, and Brian
Mittelstaedt will finish with a
mile.
Frosh sensation Tony Sandoval
will be running in the two mile,
and sprinting ace Ken Curl is
entered in the 100. The final
event is the mile relay, a race the
Cards won handily at the San
Francisco Examiner meet three
weeks ago. This week's team will
consist of Hogsett, Kessel,
Bagshaw, and Anderson.
The teams the Cards will be
facing include Brigham Young,
Utah, Colorado, Colorado State,
Montana State, Nevada (Reno),
and Idaho State.
