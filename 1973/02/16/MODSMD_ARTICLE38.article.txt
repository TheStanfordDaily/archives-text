# Stanford Seeks Revenge At Maples
## Cards Vs. OSU, Oregon—Again 
### STAN WILSON 
held every time he'll get 40 points
against Oregon."
Dallmar elaborated on the
Ducks, explaining, "Playing
Oregon requires a complete
adjustment, by players and
officials. They play a fine floor
game—they should, they're on the
floor about 60 percent of the
time. I won't take anything away
from Oregon. They're an
aggressive team that plays very
hard."
Same Lineup
Dallmar plans to start the same
lineup this weekend. Captain
Buell (6-5), who replaced the
injured Dave Frost, will start at
one forward spot, and will be
joined by 6-9 junior Mike Mann.
Kelley will man the post, while
sophs Mark Gilberg (6-0) and Me 1
Arterberry (6-3) will start at the
guard positions.
Oregon State, who Dallmar
describes as the "best shooters
we've seen all year," is led by
senior forward Sam Whitehead,
and center Neal Jurgensen. The
pair teamed up for 29 points
against Stanford. "Jurgensen is a
real fine post man," commented
Dallmar. He added that
"Whitehead has always hurt us."
Despite the two losses, Dallmar
had some positive comments. "I
would like to single out Bob Buell
this week for stepping in for
David Frost and doing a fine job.
Also, Mike Mann played much
better, especially against Oregon
on Friday night." Buell connected
on 10 of 15 shots in the two
games, recording a 25-point
weekend. Mann scored 12 points
against the Ducks.
Oregon's big guns are freshman

Hoping to avenge last
weekend's losses in the
Northwest, the Stanford Cardinals
return to the friendly confines of
Maples Pavilion to host Oregon
State tonight, and Oregon
tomorrow night.
Playing before 10,000 hostile,
screaming fans in Eugene and
Corvallis is an ordeal which can't
be described, only experienced.
Stanford's young cagers got a
rather rude initiation to this
ordeal by the Oregonians,
dropping a 62-56 decision to the
Ducks and suffering a 74-68
setback at the hands of the
Beavers.
Senior captain Bob Buell
readily admitted that the Oregon
trip was an intimidating situation
for some of the players. But the
Cards, 2-5 in the Pac-Eight after
the first round of league action,
play five of their last seven games
at home, and should improve their
record.
Physical
Both Oregon and OSU play
extremely physical basketball, and
in the loosely officiated games last
weekend the Cards were guilty of
numerous turnovers as a result.
Sophomore center Rick Kelley,
who leads Stanford in scoring and
rebounding, was quite literally
"held" down in scoring last week.
The talented seven-footer
attempted only eight shots against
the Ducks, as he spent most of the
evening carrying two or three
defenders on his back.
"Richard (Kelley) is playing so
well it's frightening," said
assistant coach Bub Bowling. If he
can operate inside without getting

guard Ron Lee, who scored 17
points against the Cards, and
senior "Cowboy" Doug Little,
who, until last weekend, was the
Pac-Eight's leading scorer. Little
scored 15 against Stanford, but
only two against Cal, and dropped
to seventh in the scoring race.

The Ducks, who wer 0-14 last
season, are now 4-3 in the
conference, and hold down fourth
place. Oregon will go with youth,
as always. Freshman Mark Barwig
(6-4) will join Lee in the
backcourt, soph Gerald Willett
(6-8) will start at center, and
junior leaper Billy Ingram (6-4)
will team with Little at the corner
spot.
Stanford is 5-2 at Maples
Pavilion this season, and 4-7 on
the road. "Our experience against
Oregon and Oregon State last
week should help us to get ready
for the games on Friday and
Saturday," Dallmar said. "And it
will be nice to get back into
action at home—we haven't
played a game in Maples in almost
a month."
