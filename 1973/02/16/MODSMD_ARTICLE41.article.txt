# JV Cagers Attempt To Reverse Trend
## 
### MARK WHITE 
Intent on breaking a trend
Stanford has followed since
January 12, the junior varsity
basketball team will try to
improve its 7-6 record with two
games this weekend at Maples
Pavilion. The Cards play the
Castle Air Force Base team Friday
evening at 6 p.m. followed by a 6
p.m. game against the UC Davis'
JV Saturday.
Since January 12, the JV's
have won and lost their last 10
games in pairs, defeating UOP and
Merritt College last weekend.
According to this trend, the Cards
should revert to losing this
weekend, but circumstances lean
towards a reversal of the six week
old cycle.
Having played and lost to
several teams Stanford has
defeated, Castle's team should be
the underdog in Friday's game.
While the airmen have done well
against other airbase teams,
recently placing fourth in the
all-SAC tournament and winning
the Vanderburg tournament, they
have fallen to several college frosh
teams.
Short But Strong
One problem the men from
Castle face is their decided lack of

height. Their tallest player, 6-4
Rich Baldwin, was an
All-American player in
high-school and averages 20 points
a game. Baldwin swings between
center and forward and is
complemented by Mike Route, a
6-2 forward who averages 24
points a game.
These two forwards comprise
the heart of the team, accounting
for nearly half of the 85 points
Castle averages a game. Castle's
strength lies in their overall
huskiness (most of the players are
built like footballers) and in their
capacity to improvise.
Davis, Again
Following the game with
Castle, the Cards face another
strong, short team whose style of
play is like Oregon's physical.
Davis too has two good, short
forwards who are the strength of
the team, although the Aggies will
look to x Jim Turner, a guard, for
scoring help. UC Davis should be
considered an underdog also,
however, for Stanford defeated
the Aggies last month, 72-54, in
one of the Cards' better efforts.
In that game the Cards got the
type of scoring attack they need
to win. Kevin Enright scored 20,
hitting on 10 of 13 shots, in
backing up 6-9 Ed Schweitzer's
usual steady performance of 24
points and 11 rebounds. Last
week's game against Merritt »was
of the same type Marty Moroski
scored 27 while Schweitzer added
17 and dominated the boards.
Bob Nicholson, who is subbing
as interim coach while Bill Jones
is scouting high school talent in
the South, explained why the
diversity of scoring is important.
"We think that a distribution of
points among several players
makes us a much better team. If
we look to Schweitzer to score all
of our points, the other team will
double up on him and make it
hard to get the ball inside."

Bob Nicholson, who is subbing
as interim coach while Bill Jones
is scouting high school talent in
the South, explained why the
diversity of scoring is important.
"We think that a distribution of
points among several players
makes us a much better team. If
we look to Schweitzer to score all
of our points, the other team will
double up on him and make it
hard to get the ball inside."

SWINGING FOR DOLLARS Tom Watson looks down the fairway at Silverado Country Club after

event, his first as a golf professional.
Intent on breaking a trend
Stanford has followed since
January 12, the junior varsity
basketball team will try to
improve its 7-6 record with two
games this weekend at Maples
Pavilion. The Cards play the
Castle Air Force Base team Friday
evening at 6 p.m. followed by a 6
p.m. game against the UC Davis'
JV Saturday.
Since January 12, the JV's
have won and lost their last 10
games in pairs, defeating UOP and
Merritt College last weekend.
According to this trend, the Cards
should revert to losing this
weekend, but circumstances lean
towards a reversal of the six week
old cycle.
Having played and lost to
several teams Stanford has
defeated, Castle's team should be
the underdog in Friday's game.
While the airmen have done well
against other airbase teams,
recently placing fourth in the
all-SAC tournament and winning
the Vanderburg tournament, they
have fallen to several college frosh
teams.
Short But Strong
One problem the men from
Castle face is their decided lack of

height. Their tallest player, 6-4
Rich Baldwin, was an
All-American player in
high-school and averages 20 points
a game. Baldwin swings between
center and forward and is
complemented by Mike Route, a
6-2 forward who averages 24
points a game.
These two forwards comprise
the heart of the team, accounting
for nearly half of the 85 points
Castle averages a game. Castle's
strength lies in their overall
huskiness (most of the players are
built like footballers) and in their
capacity to improvise.
Davis, Again
Following the game with
Castle, the Cards face another
strong, short team whose style of
play is like Oregon's physical.
Davis too has two good, short
forwards who are the strength of
the team, although the Aggies will
look to x Jim Turner, a guard, for
scoring help. UC Davis should be
considered an underdog also,
however, for Stanford defeated
the Aggies last month, 72-54, in
one of the Cards' better efforts.
In that game the Cards got the
type of scoring attack they need
to win. Kevin Enright scored 20,
hitting on 10 of 13 shots, in
backing up 6-9 Ed Schweitzer's
usual steady performance of 24
points and 11 rebounds. Last
week's game against Merritt »was
of the same type Marty Moroski
scored 27 while Schweitzer added
17 and dominated the boards.
