# Swimmers Favored Against Bears
## 
### MIKE CHASSON 
Stanford will be a heavy favorite to defeat
California tomorrow morning in a swim meet
on the Berkeley campus. The Cards hope to
continue a domination of the Bears that
extends over thirty years.
Stanford Coach Jim Gaughran and Cal
coach Pete Cutino have agreed to run the
meet using a slightly different schedule of
events than normal. Instead of a 400 medley
relay, there will be a 100 back, 100 breast,
and 100 fly. In place of the 200 IM there will
be a 400 IM.
The coaches made these changes in order
to give swimmers on both squads an
opportunity to make Pacific-Eight and NCAA
cut-off times in events only swum in
championship meets.
The Cards currently have 14 swimmers and
two divers who have qualified for the
Pacific-Eight Championships in Santa Monica
March 8-10. Gaughran is allowed to take 18
swimmers or divers, with the divers counting
as one-half.

Gaughran and assistant coach Jeff
Hammett must decide following the dual meet
season who has the best opportunity to score
points in the Pacific-Eight Championships if
more than 18 individuals qualify for the meet.
Lineup Changes
In tomorrow's meet Gaughran will make
some switches from his usual dual meet
lineup. He will shift distance swimmer Terry
Sutton out of the 1000 freestyle and into the
200 freestyle. In Sutton's place Gaughran will
use Richard Cook who normally swims the
200.
Another change will find sprinter Dean
Anderson entered in the 100 yard butterfly
instead of the 50 freestyle. Anderson will
attempt to make the cut-off time for the
Pacific-Eight Championships in this event.
Steve Strong will swim in the special 400 IM
instead of the 1000 freestyle. Joining Strong
in this event will be John Hencken and Paul
Clark.
A new addition in the 200 freestyle will be
sprinter Bruce Goodwin. Goodwin, who had

an excellent meet against USC last weekend
will attempt to earn a place on the Cards 800
freestyle relay for the league championships
and NCAA's.
Seven Prospects
Currently Gaughran and Hammett have
seven prospects for this distance relay. They
will choose among Goodwin, Cook, Sutton,
Anderson, Strong, Jack Deppe, and Ron
Longinotti.
The coaching staff can afford to make
lineup changes as Cal is very weak in the
distance freestyle events. The Bear's strength
is in the sprints with Peter Schnugg and in the
IM with Mark Croghan.
More than one heat will be run in some
events as the junior varsity swimmers will be
swimming at the same time. Hammett noted
that the entire team is working hard and he
expects to see some good swims this Saturday.
The Cards final dual meet of the season
will be against the Ladera Oaks Aquatic Club
next weekend at the Encina Pools.

Stanford Coach Jim Gaughran and Cal
coach Pete Cutino have agreed to run the
meet using a slightly different schedule of
events than normal. Instead of a 400 medley
relay, there will be a 100 back, 100 breast,
and 100 fly. In place of the 200 IM there will
be a 400 IM.
The coaches made these changes in order
to give swimmers on both squads an
opportunity to make Pacific-Eight and NCAA
cut-off times in events only swum in
championship meets.
The Cards currently have 14 swimmers and
two divers who have qualified for the
Pacific-Eight Championships in Santa Monica
March 8-10. Gaughran is allowed to take 18
swimmers or divers, with the divers counting
as one-half.

Gaughran and assistant coach Jeff
Hammett must decide following the dual meet
season who has the best opportunity to score
points in the Pacific-Eight Championships if
more than 18 individuals qualify for the meet.
Lineup Changes
In tomorrow's meet Gaughran will make
some switches from his usual dual meet
lineup. He will shift distance swimmer Terry
Sutton out of the 1000 freestyle and into the
200 freestyle. In Sutton's place Gaughran will
use Richard Cook who normally swims the
200.
Another change will find sprinter Dean
Anderson entered in the 100 yard butterfly
instead of the 50 freestyle. Anderson will
attempt to make the cut-off time for the
Pacific-Eight Championships in this event.
Steve Strong will swim in the special 400 IM
instead of the 1000 freestyle. Joining Strong
in this event will be John Hencken and Paul
Clark.
A new addition in the 200 freestyle will be
sprinter Bruce Goodwin. Goodwin, who had

an excellent meet against USC last weekend
will attempt to earn a place on the Cards 800
freestyle relay for the league championships
and NCAA's.
Seven Prospects
Currently Gaughran and Hammett have
seven prospects for this distance relay. They
will choose among Goodwin, Cook, Sutton,
Anderson, Strong, Jack Deppe, and Ron
Longinotti.
The coaching staff can afford to make
lineup changes as Cal is very weak in the
distance freestyle events. The Bear's strength
is in the sprints with Peter Schnugg and in the
IM with Mark Croghan.
More than one heat will be run in some
events as the junior varsity swimmers will be
swimming at the same time. Hammett noted
that the entire team is working hard and he
expects to see some good swims this Saturday.
The Cards final dual meet of the season
will be against the Ladera Oaks Aquatic Club
next weekend at the Encina Pools.
Stanford will be a heavy favorite to defeat
California tomorrow morning in a swim meet
on the Berkeley campus. The Cards hope to
continue a domination of the Bears that
extends over thirty years.
