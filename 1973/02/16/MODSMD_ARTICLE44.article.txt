# Watson Hits Golf Jackpot In Second Tour Year
## 
### TINA LUSKEY 
In October, 1971, Tom Watson
played in his first pro tournament,
the Kaiser International. After
two rounds, he was tied for
second. He faltered the last two
days, but still finished tied for
28th, good enough for $1,065.
The Stanford graduate's strong
performance prompted
tournament winner Billy Casper
to say: "Tom is an extremely
strong fellow. He's got a lot of
length, good iron shots, and he
putts well. All of these things put
together lead me to think he's
going to make a name for
himself."
Casper's prophecy proved true
two weeks ago at the Hawaiian
Open. After fifteen months of up
and down performances, Watson
put together rounds of 68, 65,
and 68 to lead the field by four
strokes after the third day.
Exhibiting a deadly touch on
Saturday, he snaked in birdie
putts of 20, 30, and 25 feet on
the 15th, 16th, and 17th holes
with nation-wide television
looking on.
But the $40,000 first prize
eluded him on Sunday. A poor lie
on the 13 th hole broke his
concentration, leading to a series
of missed shots and a disastrous
double-bogey seven. In the end,
his score added up to a

disappointing 75, and he was
forced to settle for third place.
Big Paycheck
Nevertheless, the 23-year-old
picked up $14,200 plus another
$l5OO for having the low round
each of two days. More
importantly, he finally got the
recognition his talents deserve and
the good feeling of knowing folks
were pulling for him. Though he
finished third, the gallery on the
18th green saved its warmest
ovation for him.
Watson has been playing sports
well all his life. A native of Kansas
City, Missouri, he was an
all-around athlete as a youngster,
and in high school he
quarterbacked the football team
besides playing golf. His interest
in the latter game was generated
by his father, an excellent golfer
in his own right.
When Tom began considering
colleges, his father encouraged
him to consider his own alma
mater, Stanford. Raymond
Watson and another Stanford
alumnus, Bud Finger, had played
golf together on the Stanford
varsity golf team during the '4o's.
Today, Bud Finger is the varsity
golf coach at Stanford, and he
admits he had the inside track in
recruiting Tom.
At Stanford, Watson continued
devoting time to golf, but other
interests attracted him. Says
former roommate and teammate
Gary Vanier, "Tom never played
really well during the school year.
He always played best at the start
of the summer, and that's when
he won most of his tournaments.
He was serious about golf, but he
could never give it one hundred
percent because of school and the
social activities that went with it."
Tom himself felt his high
school dream of turning pro was
disappearing. "Like many college
athletes, I drifted away from the
idea of becoming a pro. There
were too many other things to do
at Stanford."
Academic Drudgery
When it came to academics,
Tom plodded through his courses.
"I knew I had to do it to get
through school. But I wound up
feeling guilty a lot. My studies got
in the way of my golf game and
golf got in the way of my
studies." t one time, Tom
thought A studying for a
profession rather than playing
golf, but his interest waned. "I
really wasn't that fond of
academics. I wanted to do
something more practical than
study psychology."
Watson tried to judge campus
causes on their individual merits.

Says Vanier, "He had radical
views, but he wasn't usually the
demonstrating type. He had h
really good head, a really open
mind." When U.S. troops were
sent into Cambodia during the
spring of 1970, Watson, then a
junior, supported campus
shut-downs and even sat in to stop
"business as usual." In retrospect,
he says, "I thought that the
school should be closed down. I
felt we had a right to close it
down. It was a really good way of
showing our government how
wrong it was."
In /Spite of his non-golf
pursuits, Watson maintained a
high-calibre game throughout his
four years. He rarely won a big
tournament during the school
year, but he proved himself a solid
winner in individual matches and
an outstanding point-getter in
team competition. Out of 51
collegiate matches, he won 41,
lost 7 and tied 3.
Off And On
Watson's major problem during
his school years was consistency.
He was a streak player, on his
game for a few weeks, then off.
Occasionally, a troublesome driver
plagued his long game. His
tremendous length off the tee
made accuracy difficult. However,
in 1969, he won the NCAA
driving championship, clouting
three balls within fifteen feet of
each other, averaging 294.3 yards.
After a strong showing in the
1969 U.S. Amateur (he tied for
fifth), Watson was invited to the
1970 Masters. In his first head to
head competition with the world's
top professionals, he missed the
cut by only two shots.
A year later, after his
graduation from Stanford, golf
became more than a sideline for
Tom. It became his job, and he
discovered a lot of little
drudgeries accompanying it.
"I really wasn't used to
travelling at all," he said after six
months on the tour. "You gain
personal experience all the time,
like learning what motels to stay
at." Tom admitted feeling lonely
and to compensate, he was an avid
telephoner. Although he stayed
with other pros a few times, Tom
said, "I guess I'm pretty much of
a loner. I like to read or watch a
good show on television, but
television can get to be a bad
habit."
During the Andy Williams San
Diego Open, Tom finished reading
the Pentagon Papers and
commented, "It really showed
how a lot of people can be
fooled." Nevertheless, he insists,
"The main thing I'm doing is

playing golf. I'm only as
intellectual as I need to be."
On The Road
Tom travels around the
country by car. "It'd be great to
travel by plane, but I don't have
the bread to do that." He enjoys
the driving usually, but the longer
two- or three-day trips are
physically draining. And,
sometimes, housing arrangements
fail to materialize.
"When I was in Orlando last
year," he said, "I got a little upset
and mean. I tried to find a room,
but because the Disney World was
there, all the rooms were booked
a couple months in advance. I
ended up staying in a shack. Then,
my car broke down and I had to
go out and rent another."
In January, Watson told Vanier
at the Crosby, "Sometimes it's
really boring. After a round, it's
easy to wind up back in your
room." Says Vanier, "I doubt if
Tom's partying much," and Tom
admits he does not go out often at
night.
Of his fellow pros, Tom said,
"We're all doing the same thing."
But, it is impossible for him to
escape the fierce competition and
scramble for purse money. "A lot
of people come up to you after a

round and say, 'Man, I really hit
the ball great, but I putted lousy
and shot a 72,' or 'Man, I hit the
ball terrible but putted great and
shot 71.' Then, they wait
expectantly to hear your score.
Nobody wants to hear about how
you played. They just want to
find out your score. Eighty
percent of the people on the tour
don't care if you made an eight on
a hole, and about twenty percent
of them wish you'd made nine.
You're out there to make a buck,
except the big names. They're
shooting for the titles."
Tom's earnings last year
amounted to a little over $30,000.
Probably a third to a half was
needed to meet travel, lodging,
and equipment costs, not to
mention caddy fees.
It was a good showing for a
rookie, but with $15,000 plus
already in his pocket from just
one tournament, this year
promises to be much better for
Tom. He has got strength, the
finesse, and the temperment. And,
after coming so close, he has the
experience for next time.
When all those next times roll
around, you can bet Tom Watson
will be hungry for the titles. He
has proved himself.
