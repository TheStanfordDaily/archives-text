Rogers Asks Aid For North Vietnam
WASHINGTON Secretary of State William P. Rogers
asked yesterday for congressional approval of postwar aid
to North Vietnam and for healing of the wounds at home
caused by the long Southeast Asian conflict.
Rogers predicted that reluctant legislators will in the
end be persuaded to make an administration-sought
"small investment" in postwar reconstruction help to all
of Indochina. He portrayed this as needed for a lasting
peace.
In an emotional defense of administration policies of
refusing amnesty to draft-dodgers and deserters while
advocating reconciliation with the former enemy, Rogers
told a news conference:
"As far as the administration is concerned, we want
very much to get on with the business of peace and
reconstruction here."
With voice quavering and eyes moistening, he
continued:
"And I can't think of anything that gets us off to a
better start than to watch these returning POWs. If that
doesn't make America proud, then I don't know what
will.
"I think it is time that all of us took a little pride in
6ur country."
Rogers' 50-minute meeting with reporters preceded his
departure late next week for the Vietnam peace guarantee
conference that opens in Paris Feb. 26.
He remained optimistic about the carrying-through of
the peace accord despite repeated allegations of cease-fire
violations. He pictured current outbreaks of fighting in
parts of South Vietnam as expected "local squabbles" and
added:
"We are confident the cease-fire will be carried out and
will be effective in South Vietnam . . ."
He also said he expects and hopes that a cease-fire
agreement will be reached in neighboring Laos by the end
of next week.
Tearful POW Reunions Continue
TRAVIS AFB, Calif. Operation Homecoming poured a
steady stream of freed U.S. prisoners of war into their
homeland yesterday men who said they "lived on
loyalty" to their country during the dark days in
Communist hands.
Each craft flying back yesterday carried 20 repatriates,
as did another which returned Wednesday a total of 60.
All came 8010 miles across the Pacific from Clark Air
Force Base in the Philippines where 142 former prisoners
tasted their first freedom following their release Sunday
night, U.S. time.
At Clark AFB, officials announced that three more
Starlifter jets would fly 60 more men toward home
today. Clark also prepared to receive 20 additional
prisoners Hanoi said would be released soon, leaving 399
men in Communist hands for which an accounting has
been made.
Tears welled in the eyes of the first man back
yesterday, Navy Capt. James B. Stockdale, as he thanked
his countrymen for their loyalty to Americans held
captive for years in Vietnam.
Stockdale left the plane with a limp which he told
newsmen later he had since his capture Sept. 9, 1965
when his A4 Skyhawk was shot down during a bombing
mission over North Vietnam.
He reported his North Vietnamese captors told him of
the cease-fire agreement about Feb. 1, nine days after
President Nixon revealed the pact to the rest of the world.
"It was announced with great fanfare and so forth,
exaggerated," he said.
Stockdale didn't learn of the July 1969 landing of
Americans on the moon until last year when a newly
interned prisoner told him about it.
"I'm looking forward to seeing replays of it on
television," he said.
Stockdale declined to answer questions about prison
life, saying, "I don't think it's proper to discuss prison and

prisoner treatment at this time."
Air Force spokesmen said one of the men, Army Pvt.
Ferdinand A. Rodriguez of Brooklyn, N.Y., did not get
off the plane when it landed as has been customary with
the rest of the men. They said he told them, "I'm sorry, I
don't want to get off. I don't feel well."
Authorities at Travis declined to discuss his condition
further. Later, a Pentagon spokesman in Washington said
Rodriguez was one of three freed prisoners of war who
face possible charges of being absent without leave from
their units at the time they were captured.
Rodriguez, who was captured April 14, 1968 in South
Vietnam, remained on the plane awaiting its take-off for
the East. He is headed for Valley Forge Army Hospital in
Pennsylvania.
Dollar Steadies Overseas
LONDON The U.S. dollar steadied on Europe's money
markets yesterday for the first time since it was devalued
Monday night, suggesting that the world monetary crisis
of the past two weeks is coming to an end.
Bankers and other financial sources interviewed here
warned that a number of uncertainties remain which
could well keep money markets unsettled for the next few
days or even weeks.
But none predicted a further crisis selling wave of
dollars in the immediate future such as the one last week
which forced Washington to devalue.
Foreign exchange dealers said there were signs that
money markets were adjusting to the dollar's new
exchange rates after the 10 percent devaluation.
These rates include a permitted high or ceiling level, a
central level of parity, and a permitted low or floor level.
Most of the world's leading foreign exchange markets
were closed Monday and Tuesday. When they reopened
Wednesday, the devalued foliar started generally at the
new ceiling rates and moved more or less steadily down.
But in much of Europe yesterday the dollar began
moving back up toward the new ceiling rates.
The dollar improved in Frankfurt, London, Paris,
Amsterdam and Milan. It fell in Brussels, Zurich and
Tokyo. The generally steady pattern, however, was the
dollar's best daily performance this month.
Gold, however, hit record highs in Europe for the
second straight day.
"An ominous sign," a Frepch banker said. "Confidence
hasn't yet been fully restored."
Normally, a rapidly rising gold price is a sign of lagging
confidence in the value of paper money. In major
European centers gold jumped more than a dollar an
ounce yesterday to close at record highs of $73.37 in
Zurich, $73.62 in London and $75.28 in Paris.
A rise in gold prices, however, had been generally
expected as one result of the dollar devaluation. It
remained to be seen whether the gold market activity by
itself would touch off more monetary trouble.
Wholesale Prices Soar
WASHINGTON Wholesale prices went up sharply in
January for the second straight month, the government
said yesterday, with the price of food leading the
increases.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the
wholesale price index rose 1.3 percent on an unadjusted
basis last month and 1.1 percent on a seasonally adjusted
basis. Although the rise was smaller than that of
December, it was still a big jump in prices at the wholesale
level.
The bureau said that prices of farm products and
processed foods went up by 3.3 percent. Adjusted for
seasonal variations, the BLS figured this increase at 2.9
percent.
Today's Weather
In the San Francisco Bay area, it should be a beautiful
day: fair today through tomorrow. High today will be in
the 50s to low 60s; lows tonight in the 40s to low 50s.

Dollar Steadies Overseas
LONDON The U.S. dollar steadied on Europe's money
markets yesterday for the first time since it was devalued
Monday night, suggesting that the world monetary crisis
of the past two weeks is coming to an end.
Bankers and other financial sources interviewed here
warned that a number of uncertainties remain which
could well keep money markets unsettled for the next few
days or even weeks.
But none predicted a further crisis selling wave of
dollars in the immediate future such as the one last week
which forced Washington to devalue.
Foreign exchange dealers said there were signs that
money markets were adjusting to the dollar's new
exchange rates after the 10 percent devaluation.
These rates include a permitted high or ceiling level, a
central level of parity, and a permitted low or floor level.
Most of the world's leading foreign exchange markets
were closed Monday and Tuesday. When they reopened
Wednesday, the devalued foliar started generally at the
new ceiling rates and moved more or less steadily down.
But in much of Europe yesterday the dollar began
moving back up toward the new ceiling rates.
The dollar improved in Frankfurt, London, Paris,
Amsterdam and Milan. It fell in Brussels, Zurich and
Tokyo. The generally steady pattern, however, was the
dollar's best daily performance this month.
Gold, however, hit record highs in Europe for the
second straight day.
"An ominous sign," a Frepch banker said. "Confidence
hasn't yet been fully restored."
Normally, a rapidly rising gold price is a sign of lagging
confidence in the value of paper money. In major
European centers gold jumped more than a dollar an
ounce yesterday to close at record highs of $73.37 in
Zurich, $73.62 in London and $75.28 in Paris.
A rise in gold prices, however, had been generally
expected as one result of the dollar devaluation. It
remained to be seen whether the gold market activity by
itself would touch off more monetary trouble.
Wholesale Prices Soar
WASHINGTON Wholesale prices went up sharply in
January for the second straight month, the government
said yesterday, with the price of food leading the
increases.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the
wholesale price index rose 1.3 percent on an unadjusted
basis last month and 1.1 percent on a seasonally adjusted
basis. Although the rise was smaller than that of
December, it was still a big jump in prices at the wholesale
level.
The bureau said that prices of farm products and
processed foods went up by 3.3 percent. Adjusted for
seasonal variations, the BLS figured this increase at 2.9
percent.
Today's Weather
In the San Francisco Bay area, it should be a beautiful
day: fair today through tomorrow. High today will be in
the 50s to low 60s; lows tonight in the 40s to low 50s.
Rogers Asks Aid For North Vietnam
WASHINGTON Secretary of State William P. Rogers
asked yesterday for congressional approval of postwar aid
to North Vietnam and for healing of the wounds at home
caused by the long Southeast Asian conflict.
Rogers predicted that reluctant legislators will in the
end be persuaded to make an administration-sought
"small investment" in postwar reconstruction help to all
of Indochina. He portrayed this as needed for a lasting
peace.
In an emotional defense of administration policies of
refusing amnesty to draft-dodgers and deserters while
advocating reconciliation with the former enemy, Rogers
told a news conference:
"As far as the administration is concerned, we want
very much to get on with the business of peace and
reconstruction here."
With voice quavering and eyes moistening, he
continued:
"And I can't think of anything that gets us off to a
better start than to watch these returning POWs. If that
doesn't make America proud, then I don't know what
will.
"I think it is time that all of us took a little pride in
6ur country."
Rogers' 50-minute meeting with reporters preceded his
departure late next week for the Vietnam peace guarantee
conference that opens in Paris Feb. 26.
He remained optimistic about the carrying-through of
the peace accord despite repeated allegations of cease-fire
violations. He pictured current outbreaks of fighting in
parts of South Vietnam as expected "local squabbles" and
added:
"We are confident the cease-fire will be carried out and
will be effective in South Vietnam . . ."
He also said he expects and hopes that a cease-fire
agreement will be reached in neighboring Laos by the end
of next week.
Tearful POW Reunions Continue
TRAVIS AFB, Calif. Operation Homecoming poured a
steady stream of freed U.S. prisoners of war into their
homeland yesterday men who said they "lived on
loyalty" to their country during the dark days in
Communist hands.
Each craft flying back yesterday carried 20 repatriates,
as did another which returned Wednesday a total of 60.
All came 8010 miles across the Pacific from Clark Air
Force Base in the Philippines where 142 former prisoners
tasted their first freedom following their release Sunday
night, U.S. time.
At Clark AFB, officials announced that three more
Starlifter jets would fly 60 more men toward home
today. Clark also prepared to receive 20 additional
prisoners Hanoi said would be released soon, leaving 399
men in Communist hands for which an accounting has
been made.
Tears welled in the eyes of the first man back
yesterday, Navy Capt. James B. Stockdale, as he thanked
his countrymen for their loyalty to Americans held
captive for years in Vietnam.
Stockdale left the plane with a limp which he told
newsmen later he had since his capture Sept. 9, 1965
when his A4 Skyhawk was shot down during a bombing
mission over North Vietnam.
He reported his North Vietnamese captors told him of
the cease-fire agreement about Feb. 1, nine days after
President Nixon revealed the pact to the rest of the world.
"It was announced with great fanfare and so forth,
exaggerated," he said.
Stockdale didn't learn of the July 1969 landing of
Americans on the moon until last year when a newly
interned prisoner told him about it.
"I'm looking forward to seeing replays of it on
television," he said.
Stockdale declined to answer questions about prison
life, saying, "I don't think it's proper to discuss prison and

prisoner treatment at this time."
Air Force spokesmen said one of the men, Army Pvt.
Ferdinand A. Rodriguez of Brooklyn, N.Y., did not get
off the plane when it landed as has been customary with
the rest of the men. They said he told them, "I'm sorry, I
don't want to get off. I don't feel well."
Authorities at Travis declined to discuss his condition
further. Later, a Pentagon spokesman in Washington said
Rodriguez was one of three freed prisoners of war who
face possible charges of being absent without leave from
their units at the time they were captured.
Rodriguez, who was captured April 14, 1968 in South
Vietnam, remained on the plane awaiting its take-off for
the East. He is headed for Valley Forge Army Hospital in

violations. He pictured current outbreaks of fighting in
parts of South Vietnam as expected "local squabbles" and
added:
"We are confident the cease-fire will be carried out and
will be effective in South Vietnam . . ."
He also said he expects and hopes that a cease-fire
agreement will be reached in neighboring Laos by the end

Tearful POW Reunions Continue
TRAVIS AFB, Calif. Operation Homecoming poured a
steady stream of freed U.S. prisoners of war into their
homeland yesterday men who said they "lived on
loyalty" to their country during the dark days in
Communist hands.
Each craft flying back yesterday carried 20 repatriates,
as did another which returned Wednesday a total of 60.
All came 8010 miles across the Pacific from Clark Air
Force Base in the Philippines where 142 former prisoners
tasted their first freedom following their release Sunday
night, U.S. time.
At Clark AFB, officials announced that three more
Starlifter jets would fly 60 more men toward home
today. Clark also prepared to receive 20 additional
prisoners Hanoi said would be released soon, leaving 399
men in Communist hands for which an accounting has
been made.
Tears welled in the eyes of the first man back
yesterday, Navy Capt. James B. Stockdale, as he thanked
his countrymen for their loyalty to Americans held
captive for years in Vietnam.
Stockdale left the plane with a limp which he told
newsmen later he had since his capture Sept. 9, 1965
when his A4 Skyhawk was shot down during a bombing
mission over North Vietnam.
He reported his North Vietnamese captors told him of
the cease-fire agreement about Feb. 1, nine days after
President Nixon revealed the pact to the rest of the world.
"It was announced with great fanfare and so forth,
exaggerated," he said.
Stockdale didn't learn of the July 1969 landing of
Americans on the moon until last year when a newly
interned prisoner told him about it.
"I'm looking forward to seeing replays of it on
television," he said.
Stockdale declined to answer questions about prison
life, saying, "I don't think it's proper to discuss prison and

prisoner treatment at this time."
Air Force spokesmen said one of the men, Army Pvt.
Ferdinand A. Rodriguez of Brooklyn, N.Y., did not get
off the plane when it landed as has been customary with
the rest of the men. They said he told them, "I'm sorry, I
don't want to get off. I don't feel well."
Authorities at Travis declined to discuss his condition
further. Later, a Pentagon spokesman in Washington said
Rodriguez was one of three freed prisoners of war who
face possible charges of being absent without leave from
their units at the time they were captured.
Rodriguez, who was captured April 14, 1968 in South
Vietnam, remained on the plane awaiting its take-off for
the East. He is headed for Valley Forge Army Hospital in
Pennsylvania.
Dollar Steadies Overseas
LONDON The U.S. dollar steadied on Europe's money
markets yesterday for the first time since it was devalued
Monday night, suggesting that the world monetary crisis
of the past two weeks is coming to an end.
Bankers and other financial sources interviewed here
warned that a number of uncertainties remain which
could well keep money markets unsettled for the next few
days or even weeks.
But none predicted a further crisis selling wave of
dollars in the immediate future such as the one last week
which forced Washington to devalue.
Foreign exchange dealers said there were signs that
money markets were adjusting to the dollar's new
exchange rates after the 10 percent devaluation.
These rates include a permitted high or ceiling level, a
central level of parity, and a permitted low or floor level.
Most of the world's leading foreign exchange markets
were closed Monday and Tuesday. When they reopened
Wednesday, the devalued foliar started generally at the
new ceiling rates and moved more or less steadily down.
But in much of Europe yesterday the dollar began
moving back up toward the new ceiling rates.
The dollar improved in Frankfurt, London, Paris,
Amsterdam and Milan. It fell in Brussels, Zurich and
Tokyo. The generally steady pattern, however, was the
dollar's best daily performance this month.
Gold, however, hit record highs in Europe for the
second straight day.
"An ominous sign," a Frepch banker said. "Confidence
hasn't yet been fully restored."
Normally, a rapidly rising gold price is a sign of lagging
confidence in the value of paper money. In major
European centers gold jumped more than a dollar an
ounce yesterday to close at record highs of $73.37 in
Zurich, $73.62 in London and $75.28 in Paris.
A rise in gold prices, however, had been generally
expected as one result of the dollar devaluation. It
remained to be seen whether the gold market activity by
itself would touch off more monetary trouble.
Wholesale Prices Soar
WASHINGTON Wholesale prices went up sharply in
January for the second straight month, the government
said yesterday, with the price of food leading the
increases.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the
wholesale price index rose 1.3 percent on an unadjusted
basis last month and 1.1 percent on a seasonally adjusted
basis. Although the rise was smaller than that of
December, it was still a big jump in prices at the wholesale
level.
The bureau said that prices of farm products and
processed foods went up by 3.3 percent. Adjusted for
seasonal variations, the BLS figured this increase at 2.9
percent.
Today's Weather
In the San Francisco Bay area, it should be a beautiful
day: fair today through tomorrow. High today will be in
the 50s to low 60s; lows tonight in the 40s to low 50s.
Rogers Asks Aid For North Vietnam
WASHINGTON Secretary of State William P. Rogers
asked yesterday for congressional approval of postwar aid
to North Vietnam and for healing of the wounds at home
caused by the long Southeast Asian conflict.
Rogers predicted that reluctant legislators will in the
end be persuaded to make an administration-sought
"small investment" in postwar reconstruction help to all
of Indochina. He portrayed this as needed for a lasting
peace.
In an emotional defense of administration policies of
refusing amnesty to draft-dodgers and deserters while
advocating reconciliation with the former enemy, Rogers
told a news conference:
"As far as the administration is concerned, we want
very much to get on with the business of peace and
reconstruction here."
With voice quavering and eyes moistening, he
continued:
"And I can't think of anything that gets us off to a
better start than to watch these returning POWs. If that
doesn't make America proud, then I don't know what
will.
"I think it is time that all of us took a little pride in
6ur country."
Rogers' 50-minute meeting with reporters preceded his
departure late next week for the Vietnam peace guarantee
conference that opens in Paris Feb. 26.
He remained optimistic about the carrying-through of
the peace accord despite repeated allegations of cease-fire
violations. He pictured current outbreaks of fighting in

dollar's best daily performance this month.
Gold, however, hit record highs in Europe for the
second straight day.
"An ominous sign," a Frepch banker said. "Confidence
hasn't yet been fully restored."
Normally, a rapidly rising gold price is a sign of lagging
confidence in the value of paper money. In major
European centers gold jumped more than a dollar an
ounce yesterday to close at record highs of $73.37 in
Zurich, $73.62 in London and $75.28 in Paris.
A rise in gold prices, however, had been generally
expected as one result of the dollar devaluation. It
remained to be seen whether the gold market activity by
itself would touch off more monetary trouble.
Wholesale Prices Soar
WASHINGTON Wholesale prices went up sharply in
January for the second straight month, the government
said yesterday, with the price of food leading the
increases.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the
wholesale price index rose 1.3 percent on an unadjusted
basis last month and 1.1 percent on a seasonally adjusted
basis. Although the rise was smaller than that of
December, it was still a big jump in prices at the wholesale
level.
The bureau said that prices of farm products and
processed foods went up by 3.3 percent. Adjusted for
seasonal variations, the BLS figured this increase at 2.9
percent.
