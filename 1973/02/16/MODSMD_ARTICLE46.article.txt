# ‘Quarterly Review’ Reappears; Features Undergraduate Writing
## 
### VALERIE LEZIN 
After a year's absence, the winter
quarter edition of the "Stanford
Quarterly Review," a collection of
selected undergraduate research papers
and non-fiction essays, reappeared in
campus book and drug stores, marking
the "Review's" fourth publication.
Although intended to come out
each quarter after its initial
publication in 1971, a full year lapsed
between this and the first three
consecutive issues.
Gordon Imrie, managing editor of
the current "Review" and editor of
the upcoming spring edition, cited
several reasons for the delay. He said
"an interregnum period" which
followed the issue one year ago and "a
tremendous delay in typesetting" this

past fall accounted for the delay of the
"Review's" fourth issue.
All delays aside, the winter quarter
edition included articles from several
disciplines on campus. Among the
papers was one on Native Americans
and their association with a white
America, another on choosing the sex
of one's offspring, and still another
revealing the depth and meaning of
Celtic mythology.
Material Solicited
The "Review's" staff solicited
material for this issue from the general
student body and also from professors
and T.A.'s affiliated with
undergraduates. Posters on campus,
headed "Publish or Perish," requested
students to submit material.
The papers had to meet three

specific criteria before being
considered for print. Academic
excellence proved to be the initial
requirement for considering the paper.
Various members of the staff then
judged the papers on their prose style,
whether or not they were well-written,
and general interest value.
The organization of the "Review"
staff facilitated such judgements.
Freshmen on the staff ordinarily
collected outstanding student papers
from professors. Associate editors, two
from each of the three disciplines
humanities, social sciences, and natural
and physical sciences read those
papers from their respective fields to
judge academic excellence.
Cross-discipline readings established
whether or not the papers were of
general interest.
Final Decision
Consulting editors, three from each
discipline, made the final decisions on
the remaining selected articles. These
consulting editors involved themselves
with the "Review" only at that time in
order to bring unbiased judgement to
the writings.
The editors nearly doubled the size of
the magazine pages, but cut by
one-third the number of pages.
The magazine, unillustrated prior to
this issue, has added photography en
masse. The cover, previously plain
print, or including one framed picture,
became an entire photograph, bleeding
off the sides.

humanities, social sciences, and natural
and physical sciences read those
papers from their respective fields to
judge academic excellence.
Cross-discipline readings established
whether or not the papers were of
general interest.
Final Decision
Consulting editors, three from each
discipline, made the final decisions on
the remaining selected articles. These
consulting editors involved themselves
with the "Review" only at that time in
order to bring unbiased judgement to
the writings.
The editors nearly doubled the size of
the magazine pages, but cut by
one-third the number of pages.
The magazine, unillustrated prior to
this issue, has added photography en
masse. The cover, previously plain
print, or including one framed picture,
became an entire photograph, bleeding
off the sides.
After a year's absence, the winter
quarter edition of the "Stanford
Quarterly Review," a collection of
selected undergraduate research papers
and non-fiction essays, reappeared in
campus book and drug stores, marking
the "Review's" fourth publication.
Although intended to come out
each quarter after its initial
publication in 1971, a full year lapsed
between this and the first three
consecutive issues.
Gordon Imrie, managing editor of
the current "Review" and editor of
the upcoming spring edition, cited
several reasons for the delay. He said
"an interregnum period" which
followed the issue one year ago and "a
tremendous delay in typesetting" this

past fall accounted for the delay of the
"Review's" fourth issue.
All delays aside, the winter quarter
edition included articles from several
disciplines on campus. Among the
papers was one on Native Americans
and their association with a white
America, another on choosing the sex
of one's offspring, and still another
revealing the depth and meaning of
Celtic mythology.
Material Solicited
The "Review's" staff solicited
material for this issue from the general
student body and also from professors
and T.A.'s affiliated with
undergraduates. Posters on campus,
headed "Publish or Perish," requested
students to submit material.
The papers had to meet three

specific criteria before being
considered for print. Academic
excellence proved to be the initial
requirement for considering the paper.
Various members of the staff then
judged the papers on their prose style,
whether or not they were well-written,
and general interest value.
The organization of the "Review"
staff facilitated such judgements.
Freshmen on the staff ordinarily
collected outstanding student papers
from professors. Associate editors, two
from each of the three disciplines
humanities, social sciences, and natural
and physical sciences read those
papers from their respective fields to
judge academic excellence.
Cross-discipline readings established
whether or not the papers were of
general interest.
