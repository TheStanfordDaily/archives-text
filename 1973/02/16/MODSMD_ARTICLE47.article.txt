# Women Form Groups To Raise Awareness
## 
### CHRIS KENRICK 
A speakers bureau for women
recently was established here and will
begin presenting speakers and
sponsoring discussions in dormitories
next week.
Jointly sponsored by the ASSU, the
Committee for the Education and
Employment of Women (CEEW), and
the Stanford Women's Center, the
Bureau seeks to provide community
speakers on areas of interest to
Stanford women in an intimate
discussion atmosphere.
Representatives to the women's
speakers bureau, selected from each
Stanford living group that includes
women, are responsible for arranging
speaker discussions in their own
residences. Coordinators of the
program have provided a list of
possible topics and available speakers
with which house representatives can
work.
Suggested topics include women in
medicine, dealing with chauvinism, the
labor force and women, legal aid,
psychology of sex roles, non-sexist
child rearing, contraception, and
abortion.
"Many Stanford women, especially
freshmen, are interested in the
women's movement but they haven't
found out how to get involved in it at
Stanford," said Elaine Wong, a
coordinator of the program. "This
might be a good way to start."
Bieth Garfield, another coordinator,
emphasized that meetings would take
place in living groups, where people
know one another, to facilitate
thought and discussion.
"We see the whole program as a
service provided rather than any
attempt to push certain views on
anyone," Garfield said. "The women's

movement hasn't been very active at
Stanford because people don't really
know about it and they're scared of it.
"Women should at least be
presented with the alternatives before
they have to make decisions about
their lives," she said.
The CEEW has provided the
Speakers Bureau with a $75 budget for
the year.
