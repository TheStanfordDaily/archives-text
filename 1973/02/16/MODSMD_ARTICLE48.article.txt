# Anti-Hijacking Pact Signed
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The United
States and Cuba signed an agreement
yesterday to prosecute or extradite
future hijackers.
But the five-year accord signed
separately in Washington and Havana
retained the traditional American
policy of sheltering political refugees.
Because it was an executive
agreement and not a treaty, the
document did not require Senate
ratification and went into effect
immediately.
Secretary of State William P.
Rogers, who signed the agreement for
the United States, said it served notice
to hijackers that they will have "no
safe haven" in the United States or
Cuba.
The agreement, signed
simultaneously by Rogers in his office
here and Cuban Foreign Minister Raul
Roa in Havana, defines a hijacker as
"any person who hereafter seizes,
removes, appropriates or diverts from
its normal route or activities an
aircraft or vessel registered under the
laws of one of the parties and brings it
to the territory of the other party."
Such a person, the agreement
provides, "shall either be returned to
the party of registry ... to be tried by
the courts of that party in conformity

with its laws or be brought before the
courts of the party whose territory
was reached for trial."
Rogers told reporters later, "I
expect there will be more prosecutions
than extraditions," indicating that
hijackers can expect to serve their
sentences in foreign prisons.
Both countries pledged to try
hijackers under existing laws providing
"the most severe penalty according to
the circumstances and the seriousness
of the acts."
One possible loophole was closed
by a clause stating that extradition is
mandatory if the hijacker has not
broken the laws of the nation to which
he fled.
Regarding political asylum, the
agreement says a nation receiving a
refugee "may take into consideration
any extenuating or mitigating
circumstances in those cases in which
the persons responsible for the acts
were being sought for strictly political
reasons and were in real and imminent
danger of death without a viable
alternative for leaving the country."
This does not apply, however, if the
refugee extorted money or threatened
to harm "the members of the crew,
passengers, or other persons in
connection with the hijacking."
