# Police Discover Suicide Victim

Local police searching
unincorporated Stanford land
yesterday for a missing woman
discovered the body of a Palo Alto
man who had committed suicide.
Police said there appeared to be no
connection between the disappearance
and the suicide.
Leslie Marie Periov, 21, who
received a BA in history here in 1972,
disappeared Tuesday afternoon after
leaving work in Palo Alto to return to
her Los Altos home.
Police found Perlov's car, an orange
Chevrolet Nova, at about 10 p.m.
Tuesday on Stanford land near the
intersection of the Page Mill
Expressway and Junipero Serra
Boulevard.
Yesterday morning, detective
sergeants from the Santa Clara County
Sheriffs department and a San Mateo
County Sheriffs canine unit
conducted a ground search of the Old
Quarry in the area where Perlov's car
had been found. A San Mateo County
Sheriffs helicopter hovered overhead,

assisting in the search.
At about 10:15 a.m., sheriffs
deputies in the helicopter spotted the
body of Mark Rosvold, 25, of Palo
Alto. After the other deputies had
temporarily abandoned their ground
search for Periov, they went to
Rosvold's body, which had a sawed-off
shotgun in one hand. Rosvold died of
a point-blank shotgun wound in the
chest and the Santa Clara County
Coroner ruled his death a suicide.
Santa Clara County Sheriffs Capt.
Frank Mosunic said yesterday that
there is "no connection that we can
determine at all" between Perlov's
disappearance and Rosvold's death.
After phoning Perlov's mother,
deputies immediately suspected foul
play because the younger Periov had
done "nothing like this in the past"
and because her car "was quite
operable" when found.
Late Wednesday, Santa Clara
County Sheriffs detective sergeants
Robert Malone and Howard DeSart
interviewed a motorist who had been
in the vicinity Tuesday and saw a man

with long blond hair standing next to
Perlov's parked car. A beige auto
apparently belonging to the man was
parked nearby.
Perlov was last seen by co-workers
at the North County Law Library in
Palo Alto, where she is a legal
secretary.
The canine unit searching for Perlov
was unable to pick up the missing
woman's scent in the area where police
found her car. The watch commander
at the Santa Clara County Sheriffs
office in Palo Alto said last night that
authorities have "absolutely no idea of
(Perlov's) whereabouts."
He added that today, deputies will
"continue the search where they left
off."
Mosunic said Rosvold's car, an
older model white Cadillac, had been
found at the entrance to the Old
Quarry just off the road where Perlov's
car had been discovered. He added
that witnesses saw Rosvold's car there
Wednesday, but there was no
indication of how long the man had
been dead.
