# ASSU To Examine Financial Proposals
## 
### 
The ASSU Finance Committee will
hold hearings next week to review
1973-74 budget proposals submitted
by student groups.
Within the next two weeks, the
ASSU Senate hopes to determine
whether a refundable program fee will
be put on the presidential ballot this
spring. If the senators approve the fee,
they then will determine what
percentage will be allocated to each
student group, based on the Finance
Committee's recommendations.
Four groups submitted proposals at
Wednesday's Finance Committee
meeting: the Black Student Union,
Conservation Club, Course Review,
and Volunteers in Asia.
Finance Committee Chairman
Frank Brokaw would like to see
groups apply whose interests "take in

a large segment of the student
community."
In the spring, students will vote
whether to assess themselves for the
program fee. 1970-71 was the last year
that students voted in favor of such a
fee, although the measure has been on
the ballot for the past two years.
ASSU Financial Manager Sara
Moore has "no idea" what this year's
election outcome will be.
A student vote for zero dollars
allocates no ASSU funds to student
groups, forcing those groups to seek
money from alternate sources.
Some of the larger groups are able
to get special fee assessments on the
ballot. During the past year, the
Publications Board, the Daily, the
Speakers Bureau and Special Events
have been operating on refundable
special assessment fees. KZSU passed a
non-refundable fee before Senate
by-laws included refundable special fee
assessments.
Applications for special assessments
must either be approved by the Senate
or by 10 percent of the student body.
Smaller groups who cannot pass
special fee assessments are at a
disadvantage. They are forced to turn
to academic departments, alumni,
athletic departments and other areas
for funds.
Moore is in favor of the program
fee because it is more flexible and
allows many groups to receive student
funds, not just a few large groups.
She feels special fee assessments are
more expensive because of the cost to
the individual groups for special
elections and refunding procedures,
and to students for many individual
assessments rather than just one.
A disadvantage of the program fee
is that students cannot specify which
groups' should receive their money.
The ASSU is not affected by the
program fee. It negotiates for its
operating budget bi-annually with the
University. The ASSU's budget,
$92,710 for 1972-73; comes out of
the University's general funding.
