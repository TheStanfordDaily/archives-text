# Some Call Me Sick
## Deep Throat Strikes 
### Jerry Coleman 
As the days progressed last
week, I noticed a dramatic
upsurge in classroom absenteeism.
At the present tuition rate, people
can hardly afford to miss class and
still get their money's worth, so I
attributed the mass absences to
some deadly and debilitating
disease.
Besides, it rained almost all
week, so no one but a few
diehards were relaxing at Lake
Lag. It had to be an illness. But I
was still healthy, and shook a
defiant fist skyward on my way
home last Friday afternoon,
shouting "Nah, nah Ya missed
me with your pestilence bolts!"
Well, I had just sat down to a
roast prime rib of beef dinner at
my palatial residence when it hit
me. Whilst wiping the banana
cream pie off my face, I felt a
strange tingling in my throat.
Tomato Surprise
Something was wrong for sure,
I reasoned, if the baked Idaho
potato with creamery butter and
sour cream tasted dry and was
difficult to swallow. The pain in
my throat increased as I sat
staring blankly at my tomate
viniagrette.
"Whattsa matter? You don't
like my prime rib? I cook it rare
specially for you. You sick?"
asked M. Albert, our chef de
cuisine.
"I've got a case of deep
throat," I replied, heading for my
room. The maitre d'hotel (head
hasher) asked me if it was mono.
"Don't be ridiculous;" was my
answer. "I haven't kissed a door
knob since September."
La Nausee
As soon as I hit the bed, the
nausea began. It was a pity to
waste what little meat I'd eaten so
I fought my stomach back. Then I
read some of my roommate's Zap
and Young Lust comix, hoping to
disgust my mind more than my
stomach was already. It worked.
Before I had time to
congratulate myself, the fever
struck. I closed the window,
turned on the heater, got under

the covers, and began to shake.
"Brown Sugar" came on the
radio, and I shook in time with it
for a while.
Cocking my head sideways, I
found I could make blasts of
fever-heavy exhalations singe my
eyebrows. Far out! When "Brown
Sugar" ended and "Your Love
Gives Me The Fever" came on, I
threw the radio out the window.
Physician, Heal Thyselves
Some of my friends came in to
offer their pre-med advice. One
recommended putting a slab of
raw meat over my head. Speaking
of heads, another friend told me
his panacea: empty all the pill
bottles in the medicine cabinet
into a bowl, stir well, close your
eyes, and ingest two an hour.
I thanked them for their
concern (murderous devils!) but
stayed with my own time-trusted
remedy: one orange-flavored St.
Joseph's Aspirin For Children
every four hours while looking at
a picture of my third grade
teacher, Miss McAllister.
Three hours later, my pitiful
frame still wracked with fever, I
called Cowell, and the night nurse
said (in a husky voice that did
little for my fever) to come over.
Naturally, no doctor could be
found within the county limits,
but over the phone a paramedic
prescribed an antibiotic and a
painkiller. I had to wake up every
four hours to take the antibiotic,
which, the nurse said, might upset
my stomach a bit.
I figured I ought to call home
(in Oakland) to tell them of my
health. My mother immediately
diagnosed my condition as flu.
"But mom the doctor says
it's a throat infection and not the
flu."
"Has that doctor known you
for the last 20 years? Okay, so it's
the flu. Now do you still have that
chicken soup I gave you the last
time I visited?"
Then it was Saturday, Chef
Albert's day off, and a night when
everybody goes out for dinner. I
had to stay in bed so I told some

guys to bring back something
cheap, easy to steal, and if
possible, tasty.
Hold The Secret Sauce
Two hours later I got my
dinner: a Bonus Jack, rings, and a
choc, shake all cold. I probably
tempted the devils of disease more
by eating that feast than I would
have going out in the rain with my
friends to a restaurant.
Sunday was the turning point.
I came down to brunch feeling
much better and ordered some
blueberry pancakes. "Where you
been all weekend, Jerry?" asked
our culinary maestro.
"I was sick, A1 had a bad
sore throat and 102 degree fever
for a while. But it's oveâ€”"
"Ho boy! you do look rotten!"
