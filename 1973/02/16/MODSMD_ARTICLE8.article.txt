# Impounded Funds
## Spending And Congressâ€™ Rights 
### Paul N. McCloskey 
The first battle was fought last week in what may
be the major issue of the 93rd Congress: will
Congress re-assert its right to establish national
priorities in the expenditure of funds?
Constitutionally, Congress makes the laws; the
President is required to see that the laws are
faithfully executed.
Recently, the President has taken the position
that he will not execute certain laws; that despite
congressional appropriations for housing, water
pollution, rural electrification and open space, he
will not operate these programs as Congress has
directed. The President has said he will suspend
expenditures on many programs for 18 months.
Pollution And Conservation
In water pollution, for example, where Congress
has appropriated $ll billion for this year and next,
the President has said he will spend only $5 billion.
In the 17th district this means much needed
construction of sewage treatment plants will be
delayed.
Who has the ultimate power to decide where
money is spent and which laws will be enforced?
Congress or the President?
The first guns were fired last week in the House
of Representatives over a minor bill to continue the
Rural Environmental Assistance Act, a 35-year-old
program of subsidies to farmers for fertilizing and
conserving the soil. The average payment has been
about $287 per farmer. For several years the
President has requested $l4O million per year for
this program. Congress appropriated $225 million
for 1973, but on December 22 the President
announced that no further money would be spent
on the program.
Require Spending
The House Agriculture Committee responded by

reporting out a. bill to require the President to spend
the money. I joined with a majority of the House to
pass the bill, after voting for an amendment to cut
the expenditure to last year's figure of $l4O million.
While the bill passed by a substantial majority, 251
to 142, or 64 percent, this was slightly less than the
two-thirds majority required to override any future
presidential veto. Significantly, 52 Republicans
voted against the President's position.
This first vote thus leaves the ultimate decision in
doubt on bills the president may choose to veto and
where a two-thirds vote is hereby necessary.
However, for many programs, such as space, foreign
aid or transportation, a presidential veto will
effectively eliminate the whole program, something
the President may not want to do. Thus a majority
would be sufficient.
In re-establishing congressional power over
national priorities, however, we also have the duty
to control our own appropriation process to see that
we raise sufficient revenues to pay for whatever we
spend. This we have not done in recent years. Last
year, for example, we appropriated $261 billion,
but provided for only $225 billion in revenues.
Encouraging Signs
The President is right when he says Congress
must cut overall government spending or raise taxes
if we are to be responsible. As we finally get down
to work, there are encouraging signs that the 93rd
Congress has a new sense of purpose and obligation
to correct the procedural deficiencies and
abdications of power so noticeable in recent years.
The next few months will show whether or not we
measure up to the task. I hope we will.

to correct the procedural deficiencies and
abdications of power so noticeable in recent years.
The next few months will show whether or not we
measure up to the task. I hope we will.
(Paul N. "Pete" McCloskey Jr. is Congressman
from California 's seventeenth district.)
The first battle was fought last week in what may
be the major issue of the 93rd Congress: will
Congress re-assert its right to establish national
priorities in the expenditure of funds?
Constitutionally, Congress makes the laws; the
President is required to see that the laws are
faithfully executed.
Recently, the President has taken the position
that he will not execute certain laws; that despite
congressional appropriations for housing, water
pollution, rural electrification and open space, he
will not operate these programs as Congress has
directed. The President has said he will suspend
expenditures on many programs for 18 months.
Pollution And Conservation
In water pollution, for example, where Congress
has appropriated $ll billion for this year and next,
the President has said he will spend only $5 billion.
In the 17th district this means much needed
construction of sewage treatment plants will be
delayed.
Who has the ultimate power to decide where
money is spent and which laws will be enforced?
Congress or the President?
The first guns were fired last week in the House
of Representatives over a minor bill to continue the
Rural Environmental Assistance Act, a 35-year-old
program of subsidies to farmers for fertilizing and
conserving the soil. The average payment has been
about $287 per farmer. For several years the
President has requested $l4O million per year for
this program. Congress appropriated $225 million
for 1973, but on December 22 the President
announced that no further money would be spent
on the program.
Require Spending
The House Agriculture Committee responded by

reporting out a. bill to require the President to spend
the money. I joined with a majority of the House to
pass the bill, after voting for an amendment to cut
the expenditure to last year's figure of $l4O million.
While the bill passed by a substantial majority, 251
to 142, or 64 percent, this was slightly less than the
two-thirds majority required to override any future
presidential veto. Significantly, 52 Republicans
voted against the President's position.
This first vote thus leaves the ultimate decision in
doubt on bills the president may choose to veto and
where a two-thirds vote is hereby necessary.
However, for many programs, such as space, foreign
aid or transportation, a presidential veto will
effectively eliminate the whole program, something
the President may not want to do. Thus a majority
would be sufficient.
In re-establishing congressional power over
national priorities, however, we also have the duty
to control our own appropriation process to see that
we raise sufficient revenues to pay for whatever we
spend. This we have not done in recent years. Last
year, for example, we appropriated $261 billion,
but provided for only $225 billion in revenues.
Encouraging Signs
The President is right when he says Congress
must cut overall government spending or raise taxes
if we are to be responsible. As we finally get down
to work, there are encouraging signs that the 93rd
Congress has a new sense of purpose and obligation
to correct the procedural deficiencies and
abdications of power so noticeable in recent years.
The next few months will show whether or not we
measure up to the task. I hope we will.
