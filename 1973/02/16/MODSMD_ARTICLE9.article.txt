# Non Sequiturs
## Not Enough Bias In TV News 
### Alphonse Juilland 
I wouldn't waste your time just to tell you
that I share Professor Owen's belief that
"network news, on the whole, is biased to the
left. . (Daily, Feb. 11). But it may be
worth some of your space to dispel a couple
of non sequiturs automatically triggered by
this charge.
The conspiracy non sequitur assumes that
whoever believes that media are "liberally"
biased must also believe in the existence of
subterranean conspirators whose evil design is
to slant news to the left. The assumption is as
false as it is pervasive.
Rather than indulge in diabolism, I am
aware of certain historical fadtors (cultural,
sociological, psychological) which naturally
tilt the verbalizer's ideological scales on the
"sinister" side (etymological sense). The same
factors account for the prevailing bias in most
colleges and universities, in the big
foundations, in the educational bureaucracy.
(After the multiple exposure of the
"military-industrial complex," where is the
valiant sociologist impetuous enough to unveil
the nexus which locks in incestuous embrace
the aforesaid constituents of the "left-liberal
complex"?)

It goes without saying that the same
predisposition afflicts our own alma mater.
Which does not mean that Stanford deans,
chairmen and professors rapaciously screen
candidates and security-check their ideological
proclivities so as to keep conservatives out.
Such doctrinaire zeal is hardly necessary as
long as "la force des choses" maintains, as a
matter of inertial course, the incandescent
purity of the Stanford ethos.
The censorship non sequitur assumes that
whoever believes in network bias also itches to
suppress it by McCarthyizing liberal
newscasters and by castrating their views.
Nothing of the sort.
The complaint is not that there is too
much bias, quite the contrary: my gripe is
that there isn't enough. 1.e., enough of a
diversity of bias, by which I mean Burkean
prejudice and principled opinion. The boring
thing about network opinion is that it clusters
within such narrow ideological confines.
Messrs. Cronkite and Brinkley and Shore and
Reasoner and Sevareid and Kalb and Rather
and Schoenbrun and Chancellor and Vanocur
et al., they are all competent reporters as well
as honorable men. The trouble is that if my

natural life depended on it, I couldn't tell
them apart on ideological grounds.
Couldn't a particle of the time so profusely
aired by these gentlemen be yielded to people
whose bias is not so subservient to left-liberal
orthodoxy? Not only to men of the right, so
dear to my heart, but also why not? to
radicals of another stripe?
What can we do? The first step is for
"mediapersons" (and for "universitypersons"
too) to stop being so defensive about liberal
bias and acknowledge it openly. This would
not imply an admission of professional
impropriety: a correct analysis of the
historical impetus which moves these august
bodies would amply take care of unwarranted
feelings of guilt.
This righteous first step would prepare the
ground for a second: a modest "affirmative
action" program on behalf of ideological
minorities. It would see to it that they too
have their invidious say, however exiguous.
True, network news would be more rather
than less controversial. They would be also
more balanced and fair. And so much more
fun.

that there isn't enough. 1.e., enough of a
diversity of bias, by which I mean Burkean
prejudice and principled opinion. The boring
thing about network opinion is that it clusters
within such narrow ideological confines.
Messrs. Cronkite and Brinkley and Shore and
Reasoner and Sevareid and Kalb and Rather
and Schoenbrun and Chancellor and Vanocur
et al., they are all competent reporters as well
as honorable men. The trouble is that if my

natural life depended on it, I couldn't tell
them apart on ideological grounds.
Couldn't a particle of the time so profusely
aired by these gentlemen be yielded to people
whose bias is not so subservient to left-liberal
orthodoxy? Not only to men of the right, so
dear to my heart, but also why not? to
radicals of another stripe?
What can we do? The first step is for
"mediapersons" (and for "universitypersons"
too) to stop being so defensive about liberal
bias and acknowledge it openly. This would
not imply an admission of professional
impropriety: a correct analysis of the
historical impetus which moves these august
bodies would amply take care of unwarranted
feelings of guilt.
This righteous first step would prepare the
ground for a second: a modest "affirmative
action" program on behalf of ideological
minorities. It would see to it that they too
have their invidious say, however exiguous.
True, network news would be more rather
than less controversial. They would be also
more balanced and fair. And so much more
fun.

and Linguistics.)
I wouldn't waste your time just to tell you
that I share Professor Owen's belief that
"network news, on the whole, is biased to the
left. . (Daily, Feb. 11). But it may be
worth some of your space to dispel a couple
of non sequiturs automatically triggered by
this charge.
The conspiracy non sequitur assumes that
whoever believes that media are "liberally"
biased must also believe in the existence of
subterranean conspirators whose evil design is
to slant news to the left. The assumption is as
false as it is pervasive.
Rather than indulge in diabolism, I am
aware of certain historical fadtors (cultural,
sociological, psychological) which naturally
tilt the verbalizer's ideological scales on the
"sinister" side (etymological sense). The same
factors account for the prevailing bias in most
colleges and universities, in the big
foundations, in the educational bureaucracy.
(After the multiple exposure of the
"military-industrial complex," where is the
valiant sociologist impetuous enough to unveil
the nexus which locks in incestuous embrace
the aforesaid constituents of the "left-liberal
complex"?)

It goes without saying that the same
predisposition afflicts our own alma mater.
Which does not mean that Stanford deans,
chairmen and professors rapaciously screen
candidates and security-check their ideological
proclivities so as to keep conservatives out.
Such doctrinaire zeal is hardly necessary as
long as "la force des choses" maintains, as a
matter of inertial course, the incandescent
purity of the Stanford ethos.
The censorship non sequitur assumes that
whoever believes in network bias also itches to
suppress it by McCarthyizing liberal
newscasters and by castrating their views.
Nothing of the sort.
The complaint is not that there is too
much bias, quite the contrary: my gripe is
that there isn't enough. 1.e., enough of a
diversity of bias, by which I mean Burkean
prejudice and principled opinion. The boring
