One of the weird and nonsensical facts about our
government — at all levels — is that much of the pub
lic's business is done in the deepest, darkest secrecy.
Citizens assume that only questions of national se
curity and some aspects of criminal justice are dealt
with in secret. Little do they know! Most of the time
our public officials act as though the way they con
duct our business is none of our business.
In 1972 roughly one-third of the Senate Public
Works Committee meetings were held in secret. The
figure for the Senate Agriculture Committee was 59
percent, for the House Appropriations Committee
over 90 percent. The House Ways and Means Com
mittee, which drafts the laws governing every federal
tax dollar you and I pay, is notoriously secretive. Se
curity is so tight that even the staff assistant of a Con
gressman who is on the Committee can't attend the
closed meetings. What are they hiding?
All sessions of congressional committees — and
records of all votes taken at such sessions — should
normally be open to the public. Committees should be
allowed to close a meeting only for considerations of
national security or invasion of personal privacy, and
the procedure for closing it should be carefully pro
tected against abuse.
In the Executive Branch, virtually everyone asso
ciated with national security acknowledges that the
system of classifying documents to preserve secrecy
has been badly abused — all too often for the pur
pose of concealing bureaucratic error. And the zeal
for secrecy ex:ends to every government agency un
der the control of the Executive Branch. Regulatory
agencies often meet behind closed doors, omit public
hearings, and suppress reports the public should see.
Of course, the secrecy involved is only secret-from
the-public. The special interest lobbyists know very
well what goes on in those hush-hush meetings. Quite
often they're right in there with the decision makers.
The only one who has splinters in his nose from bump
ing against closed doors is John Q. Public.
Now there is a resolution before the Senate —
sponsored by Senators Humphrey (D., Minn.) and
Roth (R.. Del.) (plus 11 other sponsors) which would
open all Senate committee meeting? A bill (S 260) re
cently introduced in the Senate b; '.awton Chiles of
Florida and in the House (HR 4) by Dante Fascell, also
of Florida, would open all Legislative and Executive
Branch meetings except those dealing with national
security or involving personal privacy.
Information is power, and secrecy is the most con
venient means of keeping that power out of the hands
of the people. What the people don't know, they can't
object to.
It's time to change all that. And you can help. Write
your two Senators and your Congressman. Tell them
you want them to open up the system. Or join Com
mon Cause (2100 M Street NW, Washington, D.C.
20037) and ally yourself with 200,000 other members
in getting these changes made. We're going to give
this nation back to its citizens. The student member
ship rate is $7.00. Don't just stand there!

of the people. What the people don't know, they can't
object to.
It's time to change all that. And you can help. Write
your two Senators and your Congressman. Tell them
you want them to open up the system. Or join Com

One of the weird and nonsensical facts about our
government — at all levels — is that much of the pub
lic's business is done in the deepest, darkest secrecy.
Citizens assume that only questions of national se
curity and some aspects of criminal justice are dealt
with in secret. Little do they know! Most of the time
our public officials act as though the way they con
duct our business is none of our business.
In 1972 roughly one-third of the Senate Public
Works Committee meetings were held in secret. The
figure for the Senate Agriculture Committee was 59
percent, for the House Appropriations Committee
over 90 percent. The House Ways and Means Com
mittee, which drafts the laws governing every federal
tax dollar you and I pay, is notoriously secretive. Se
curity is so tight that even the staff assistant of a Con
gressman who is on the Committee can't attend the
closed meetings. What are they hiding?
All sessions of congressional committees — and
records of all votes taken at such sessions — should
normally be open to the public. Committees should be
allowed to close a meeting only for considerations of
national security or invasion of personal privacy, and
the procedure for closing it should be carefully pro
tected against abuse.
In the Executive Branch, virtually everyone asso
ciated with national security acknowledges that the
system of classifying documents to preserve secrecy
has been badly abused — all too often for the pur
pose of concealing bureaucratic error. And the zeal
for secrecy ex:ends to every government agency un
der the control of the Executive Branch. Regulatory
agencies often meet behind closed doors, omit public
hearings, and suppress reports the public should see.
Of course, the secrecy involved is only secret-from
the-public. The special interest lobbyists know very
well what goes on in those hush-hush meetings. Quite
often they're right in there with the decision makers.
The only one who has splinters in his nose from bump
ing against closed doors is John Q. Public.
Now there is a resolution before the Senate —
sponsored by Senators Humphrey (D., Minn.) and
Roth (R.. Del.) (plus 11 other sponsors) which would
open all Senate committee meeting? A bill (S 260) re
cently introduced in the Senate b; '.awton Chiles of
Florida and in the House (HR 4) by Dante Fascell, also
