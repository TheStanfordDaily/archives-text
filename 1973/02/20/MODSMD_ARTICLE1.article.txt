# Deputies Investigate On-Campus Strangling
## 
### 
A special task force of 15 Santa
Clara County Sheriffs d3puties is
investigating the strangling death of
Leslie Marie Perlov, whose body was
found Friday on unincorporated
Stanford land near the intersection of
Junipero Serra Boulevard and Stanford
Avenue.
Detectives followed up numerous
leads over the weekend, but were
unable to narrow down their
investigation of the case. Capt. Frank
Mosunic said "so far we don't have
one specific suspect or clue."
A large search party found Perlov's
body in a wooded gully about one
mile from where they had discovered
the body of Mark Rosvold, a 24-year
old former student here who had
committed suicide with a sawed-off
shotgun. Authorities refused to rule
out a possible connection between the
two deaths.
Mosunic told the Daily yesterday
afternoon that coroner's reports had
fixed Perlov's time of death late
Tuesday afternoon; Rosvold died
mid-morning Wednesday.
Perlov received a BA in history here
last year. She had been admitted to
several area law schools and worked as
a legal secretary in the North County
Law Library in Palo Alto. Co-workers
there were the last to see here alive

before she disappeared last Tuesday
afternoon.
Sheriffs deputies found Perlov's
car, an orange Chevrolet Nova,
abandoned Tuesday night on Stanford
land near the intersection of Page Mill
Road and Junipero Serra Boulevard.
They launched an intensive search for
her starting Thursday morning.
Late Wednesday, Sheriffs
detectives interviewed an off-duty Palo
Alto police officer who saw a man
with long blond hair standing next to
Perlov's car Tuesday evening. A beige
auto apparently belonging to the man
was parked nearby.
Undersheriff Tom Rosa, who heads
the Sheriff's task force investigating
the case, said the man may have been
an inquisitive passerby, and if so, he
hoped he would contact the Sheriffs
office immediately to assist their
investigation.
Deputies found Perlov with her
blue skirt pulled up to her waist and
said that she may have been sexually
molested. Her scarf was wrapped
tightly around her throat.
Investigators could find no sign of a
struggle along the path Perlov and her
murderer apparently took to the site
where her body was found. Mosunic
said "she had to walk there. She
wasn't dragged."
