# Constitution Inadequate Protection
## Shield Laws Necessary 
### 
Don Altschul

"Freedom of the press in the
United States," according to the
Evers and Kohn column, "Against
Shield Laws" (Daily, Feb. 15) is
"founded upon the prohibition
.. . written into the First
Amendment." A fine statement in
theory, but to base an argument
upon it is to become
contaminated with reality.
Evers and Kohn say that this
"basic Bill of Rights protection is
extended to cover all facets of
government by the Fourteenth

Amendment." They fail to
recognize that the Supreme Court
extended the Bill of Rights only
to acts committed directly by
state governments. They also seem
to forget the Court's decisions last
summer in Caldwell v. United
States and the related cases. The
Court interpretation of the First
Amendment may not be to Evers'
and Kohn's liking, but it's now
the law.
Their refusal to recognize the
current legal definition of the
First Amendment cripples the rest
of their argument. I agree that the
granting of a power (such as free
press) should imply permitting the
means to use it (such as keeping
sources confidential), but the
Supreme Court has decided that
the Federalist paper number 33 is
out of date. The First
Amendment, as it stands today, is
not the "firm rock" Evers and
Kohn believe it to be.
Right of Interpretation
Indeed, it would be difficult to
prove that it ever was such a rock.
Evers and Kohn quote Justice
Black, who was among the Court's
greatest advocates of civil
liberties. Perhaps they missed the
1962 interview in which Black
stated: "Nobody has ever said
that the First Amendment gives
people a right to go anywhere in
the world they want to go or say
anything in the world they want
to say."
This seems to contradict the
quotation used in the Evers-Kohn
column, and that brings in
another important point: the
Constitution is not a flat, dead set
of words, but rather a document
which is continually given life by
the men who interpret it. Though
the Burger Court's usage of
judicial review has been less

liberal-oriented than was the
Warren Court's, their right to it
cannot be denied any more than
their power can be ignored.
Given that the Constitution is
subject to the Supreme Court's
interpretation, and given that the
Court is composed of men (such
as the former railroad lawyers
who shaped interstate commerce
during the 1920's and '30's), I
must agree with Justice John
Harlan: "The Constitution is not a
panacea for every blot upon the
public welfare."
Status Quo
Clearly, the Constitution
cannot afford adequate protection
to today's journalists. If Evers and
Kohn oppose shield laws, are they
for the maintenance of the status
quo? I hope not.
Unconditional federal shield

laws are not only desirable, but
necessary. I do not share the view
that "As Congress giveth, so can
Congress take away." They don't
often reverse themselves on
legislation of sweeping
significance. At any rate, passing a
shield-law amendment to the
Constitution would, for all
pratical purposes, eliminate the
threat of revoked guarantees.
One example should resolve
any remaining doubts. A reporter
in California is protected from
most state investigations by Shield
laws. The same reporter is subject
to federal imprisonment for much
the same activities. The question
is: which position would you
rather be in?
