# Dog Rights, Fights, And Bites
## Man's Best Friend 
### 
S. R. Luckau

Recently the Stanford community has been
occupied with a discussion of dogs and Dog Rtehts.
Although both pro-dog and contra-dog statements
have appeared, one particularly sensitive facet of the
issue has not been scrutinized in sufficient detail,
due no doubt to our special loyalty for "man's best
friend." I am referring, of course, to the Love Me,
Love My Dog syndrome.
I admire my friends who cultivate a responsible
and mature relationship with beautiful animals.
Others, however, thwarted in their unwillingness or
inability to accept the reproductive responsibility,
remain in a stage generously termed "infantile
parentalism." For them, a dog is above all a PET,
i,e,. an affection sink in lieu of human relationships.
Criticism of their beast is likely to be construed
not only as an attack upon their property, but also
as an affront to their ego. The catalog of canine
virtues they read us sounds like the duodecimal
points of the Scout Law. Not only trustworthy,
loyal, helpful — dogs drive our prey, drag our sleds
and guard our camps from the tenspeed thieves.
Veritable Pseudochildren
They promote their animals to veritable
pseudochildren, dress them like man-ikins, and talk
to them in baby talk. The trustworthy
dog-relationship is so much more rewarding than
then human, more consistent than the
child-disappointing, so much more manipulable —
demanding, but not legally requiring. Some of their
best friends are human, but their pets are their
family. The wisdom of W. C. Fields' aphorism is
revealed when we find ourselves suspected of hating
both children and dogs if we demur to spoonfeed
their minions.
Since we cannot avoid pigeonshit in this vale of
tears, only a heartless or foolish person wishes to
avoid dogshit, they reason. A further function of
the pet becomes apparent when one considers the
ill-disguised hostility with which those too timid for
overt aggression regard the territorial and
eliminatory predilections of their pets — snickering
in snide glee when the shaggy companion causes a
steaming hillock of mutt-mung to be deposited in
the steps of the Great Library.
They apparently wish the public to regard the
excretory foibles of their personality-extensions
with the same tolerant eye by which one views the

soiling ot a tirst child s diaper, we need at least rear
them less than evil Dr. Negation, who threatens to
sic (or is it sick) his cropeared killer chihuahua on
those he disfavors.
An Hallowed Symbiosis
The symbiosis of man and dog is old indeed, and
"what is ancient, is hallowed." Thus the doglover
imagines that the non-petfancy of anyone who
wishes to dine without fear of the depredation
experienced by Tresidder patrons is denying a
compact made in the dawn of time, whereby the
Son of Man promises the Son of Dog a portion of
his rare cheeseburger on rye toast, in return for help
in the Hunt. However, it is a far cry from some
pleistocene of the meat manufactory. The modern
hinter, his quiver full of paper credit, wishes for a
breed that could eat beercans and shit quarters
(instead of that in which we all tread).
For many, these pooches are jolly, minor
citizens, each bearing quasihuman license. It is just
as well that there are no volitional automobiles, else
we should have a doctrine of the irrepresibility of
internal combustion. Car-owners would encourage
their possessions to spend spare hours racing on
schoolgrounds, running stopsigns, and mooching
antifreeze at Campus Shell.
Since all good Stanfordians obviously love wheels
and tolerate them extensively, how much more
must we love dogs, who are much more organic!
The time is at hand when every sincere hitch-hiker
must carry an identity-dog in his rutsack, lest his
mellowness be called into question.
Unbridled Encroachment
Who has not seen the self-righteous
bumpersticker, "Warning — I Brake for Animals"?
No one proposes the establishment of a "Humane
Society for Humans," nor of a "Hate Your Dog,
Hate You-Society," nor of a "Vigilance Committee
for the Summary Adjustment of Uppity Curs," nor
yet the election of a "Law and Order" dogcatcher.
What must be advoated is that the patrons of
these pampered, personified predators examine their
atrophied consciences and find reason to curtain
what is, in the final analysis, their own unbridled
encroachment on the rights of non-petfanciers. Not
everyone feels obligated to "Brake" for the
cynomorphic ego-bubbles of a smug, irresponsible
minority of Stanford society.

Recently the Stanford community has been
occupied with a discussion of dogs and Dog Rtehts.
Although both pro-dog and contra-dog statements
have appeared, one particularly sensitive facet of the
issue has not been scrutinized in sufficient detail,
due no doubt to our special loyalty for "man's best
friend." I am referring, of course, to the Love Me,
Love My Dog syndrome.
I admire my friends who cultivate a responsible
and mature relationship with beautiful animals.
Others, however, thwarted in their unwillingness or
inability to accept the reproductive responsibility,
remain in a stage generously termed "infantile
parentalism." For them, a dog is above all a PET,
i,e,. an affection sink in lieu of human relationships.
Criticism of their beast is likely to be construed
not only as an attack upon their property, but also
as an affront to their ego. The catalog of canine
virtues they read us sounds like the duodecimal
points of the Scout Law. Not only trustworthy,
loyal, helpful — dogs drive our prey, drag our sleds
and guard our camps from the tenspeed thieves.
Veritable Pseudochildren
They promote their animals to veritable
pseudochildren, dress them like man-ikins, and talk
to them in baby talk. The trustworthy
dog-relationship is so much more rewarding than
then human, more consistent than the
child-disappointing, so much more manipulable —
demanding, but not legally requiring. Some of their
best friends are human, but their pets are their
family. The wisdom of W. C. Fields' aphorism is
revealed when we find ourselves suspected of hating
both children and dogs if we demur to spoonfeed
their minions.
Since we cannot avoid pigeonshit in this vale of
tears, only a heartless or foolish person wishes to
avoid dogshit, they reason. A further function of
the pet becomes apparent when one considers the
ill-disguised hostility with which those too timid for
overt aggression regard the territorial and
eliminatory predilections of their pets — snickering
in snide glee when the shaggy companion causes a
steaming hillock of mutt-mung to be deposited in
the steps of the Great Library.
They apparently wish the public to regard the
excretory foibles of their personality-extensions
with the same tolerant eye by which one views the

soiling ot a tirst child s diaper, we need at least rear
them less than evil Dr. Negation, who threatens to
sic (or is it sick) his cropeared killer chihuahua on
those he disfavors.
An Hallowed Symbiosis
The symbiosis of man and dog is old indeed, and
"what is ancient, is hallowed." Thus the doglover
imagines that the non-petfancy of anyone who
wishes to dine without fear of the depredation
experienced by Tresidder patrons is denying a
compact made in the dawn of time, whereby the
Son of Man promises the Son of Dog a portion of
his rare cheeseburger on rye toast, in return for help
in the Hunt. However, it is a far cry from some
pleistocene of the meat manufactory. The modern
hinter, his quiver full of paper credit, wishes for a
breed that could eat beercans and shit quarters
(instead of that in which we all tread).
For many, these pooches are jolly, minor
citizens, each bearing quasihuman license. It is just
as well that there are no volitional automobiles, else
we should have a doctrine of the irrepresibility of
internal combustion. Car-owners would encourage
their possessions to spend spare hours racing on
schoolgrounds, running stopsigns, and mooching
antifreeze at Campus Shell.
Since all good Stanfordians obviously love wheels
and tolerate them extensively, how much more
must we love dogs, who are much more organic!
The time is at hand when every sincere hitch-hiker
must carry an identity-dog in his rutsack, lest his
mellowness be called into question.
Unbridled Encroachment
Who has not seen the self-righteous
bumpersticker, "Warning — I Brake for Animals"?
No one proposes the establishment of a "Humane
Society for Humans," nor of a "Hate Your Dog,
Hate You-Society," nor of a "Vigilance Committee
for the Summary Adjustment of Uppity Curs," nor
yet the election of a "Law and Order" dogcatcher.
What must be advoated is that the patrons of
these pampered, personified predators examine their
atrophied consciences and find reason to curtain
what is, in the final analysis, their own unbridled
encroachment on the rights of non-petfanciers. Not
everyone feels obligated to "Brake" for the
cynomorphic ego-bubbles of a smug, irresponsible
minority of Stanford society.
