A Noble Profession
Editor:
There is presently afoot among
students and others a sense of
malaise about politics. Such a
feeling depends on an
oversimplified (but
under-romanticized) vision of
what still may be called a noble
profession. For in a sense romance
and idealism lie at the heart of a
desire to achieve, and in politics it
is the need to accomplish, even to
create, that dictates the pulse of
the art.
That is the way it should be.
But very often personal antics
become equated with professional
politics. A president, for example,
can verbally be rolled into a messy
wad of scandal and blood
conveniently labeled "politics."
To be sure, presidents are
politicians, and politics means
compromise. The point missed is
that politics is not by nature
strictly what politicians do.
Essentially, politics in our land
is the attempt to combine all the
terribly varied people and
components of a situation,
struggle with them, and emerge
with a product that will be viable,
better than nothing, and perhaps
very good. Contrary to some
popular opinion, improvement is
the password. It is due to the
nature of people, however, that
such a product cannot be the
panacea some always expect.
Politics is adjustment. It is not an
easy or certain job. And its
successes are measured in the
quality of its inherently necessary
compromises.
The art of politics should not
be confused with the excesses of

some prominent politicians.
Clearly these can be serious, even
atrocious. But to indict the entire
profession is to indulge in easy,
misguided criticism.

On behalf of our friends in
Cuba who look upon the United
States as their symbol of hope, I
oppose any anti-hijacking
agree'fnent that would force us to
betray our Cuban neighbors by
making us return them to the
cruel hands of Fidel Castro.
First of all, with searches and
metal detectors, we are now able
to catch our own hijackers
without Cuba's help.
Secondly, hijackers rarely go to
Cuba anyway, anymore, since
they discovered that they can
make more money by demanding
a ransom and a parachute.
Thirdly, anyone who treasures
freedom so much that he would
risk his life to escape to get to the
United States is exactly the kind
of person that the United States
needs for citizens.
If we want to get our hijackers
back, let us buy them back with
money ($lO,OOO per hijacker,
perhaps), but let it never be said
of us that we paid to get our
hijackers back with human beings.
Let us show the world once more
that the land which flies the Stars
and Stripes is truly the land of the
free and the home of the brave.

become equated with professional
politics. A president, for example,
can verbally be rolled into a messy
wad of scandal and blood
conveniently labeled "politics."
To be sure, presidents are
politicians, and politics means
compromise. The point missed is
that politics is not by nature
strictly what politicians do.
Essentially, politics in our land
is the attempt to combine all the
terribly varied people and
components of a situation,
struggle with them, and emerge
with a product that will be viable,
better than nothing, and perhaps
very good. Contrary to some
popular opinion, improvement is
the password. It is due to the
nature of people, however, that
such a product cannot be the
panacea some always expect.
Politics is adjustment. It is not an
easy or certain job. And its
successes are measured in the
quality of its inherently necessary
compromises.
The art of politics should not
be confused with the excesses of

some prominent politicians.
Clearly these can be serious, even
atrocious. But to indict the entire
profession is to indulge in easy,
misguided criticism.

On behalf of our friends in
Cuba who look upon the United
States as their symbol of hope, I
oppose any anti-hijacking
agree'fnent that would force us to
betray our Cuban neighbors by
making us return them to the
cruel hands of Fidel Castro.
First of all, with searches and
metal detectors, we are now able
to catch our own hijackers
without Cuba's help.
Secondly, hijackers rarely go to
Cuba anyway, anymore, since
they discovered that they can
make more money by demanding
a ransom and a parachute.
Thirdly, anyone who treasures
freedom so much that he would
risk his life to escape to get to the
United States is exactly the kind
of person that the United States
needs for citizens.
If we want to get our hijackers
back, let us buy them back with
money ($lO,OOO per hijacker,
perhaps), but let it never be said
of us that we paid to get our
hijackers back with human beings.
Let us show the world once more
that the land which flies the Stars
and Stripes is truly the land of the
free and the home of the brave.

There is presently afoot among
students and others a sense of
malaise about politics. Such a
feeling depends on an
oversimplified (but
under-romanticized) vision of
what still may be called a noble
profession. For in a sense romance
and idealism lie at the heart of a
desire to achieve, and in politics it
is the need to accomplish, even to
create, that dictates the pulse of
the art.
That is the way it should be.
But very often personal antics
become equated with professional
politics. A president, for example,
can verbally be rolled into a messy
wad of scandal and blood
conveniently labeled "politics."
