# POWs Leave 'Hanoi Hilton'

SAIGON (AP) — The "Hanoi Hilton" where
American war prisoners are beginning to
check a shabby city jail nicknamed
"Hell Hole" by the Vietnamese themselves.
A member of the International
Commission for Control and Supervision who
was in Hanoi 15 years ago and toured the
facility this week described the prison
conditions as "pretty grim."
It is, he said, a block-square city jail in the
heart of Hanoi that was constructed by the
French sometime after World War II during
the days when Vietnam was their colony.
The jail has generated wide interest among
Americans who wondered where and in what
their loved ones were imprisoned. U.S. pilots,
some of whom ended up there, baptized it the
Hanoi Hilton.
Tour Outlined
The returning control commission member
outlined what he saw during his tour on
condition neither hisfiname nor his nationality
be disclosed. jj
He said the prison is called "Hoa Lo," slang
that translates to the "Hell Hole." But even
Hanoi radio picked up the name Hanoi Hilton
and used it in its broadcasts on the prisoners
and U.S. bombing.
"To an American arriving from the States

it would be a hell of a place," he added. "So I
think you would have to say that the
conditions were pretty grim for those men.
But on the other hand, they were no worse
than the conditions under which most
Vietnamese live, except the confinement."
Courtyards
Touring commission members, in Hanoi for
the first prisoner release, walked through a
gate in high walls into an area with two
courtyards. Off one were three large sleeping
rooms, each about 30 by 55 feet, he said.
He said the North Vietnamese told them
each room would accommodate about 30
men. One room had a raised platform in the
middle "which was wide enough for two men
to sleep sort of end to end — so that the men
slept in two rows along this raised platform."
A second room of the same size had a
similar cement floor but a different
arrangement.
"Sleeping platforms were along the two
walls and the sort of depression, alleyway, was
in the middle," the commission member
reported.
On the raised platforms there were
"wooden pallets which were three or four feet
wide, and there was a thin straw mat on top
of each one."

Toilet facilities, he said, were "just sort of
a hole in the floor that you squat over and
some of them had just a honey bucket
underneath which had to be emptied by hand
— the original toilet facilities of 1920 and old
France."
Shower Hoses
"There was a sort of shower arrangement
where there were three sort of brackets
coming out of the wall and they said they
simply brought hoses in and hung them over
these brackets and that's where the showers
were."
"In the courtyards — they were sort of
primitive — there were volleyball nets and
basketball hoops and checkers and sets of
chess and cards and things."
There also was a 35-bed infirmary, he said.
The tour was made by representatives of all
four members of the international commission
— the Poles, Hungarians, Indonesians and
Canadians.
The cease-fire protocol requires that
commission members be allowed to see the
place of the released prisoners' last
confinement. The commission member said
no one disputed that the Americans had been
there, but added there was no way to tell how
long they had spent in the toured area.
