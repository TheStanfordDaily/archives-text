# UC President Reveals Federal Funding Loss

LOS ANGELES (AP) â€” The University of California will lose about
$80 million in federal funds during the next 2}/i years if President
Nixon's budget proposals are not changed, says UC President Charles
J. Hitch.
Speaking at a regents' finance committee meeting here last
Thursday, Hitch said Nixon's budget would eliminate "several of our
key programs" and lead to serious cutbacks in others.
He cited medical schools and health science programs as areas
which would be affected. Also, he said, several hundred workers in
atomic energy research would lose their jobs.
Congress could amend some of the programs, he said, "but I think
overall there will be little to cheer us up."
Students would receive less financial aid under the proposal and
Nixon changes in federal student aid programs would be timed so that
money would not reach students by this fall even if the matter cleared
Congress immediately, Hitch said.
"I find it very disheartening that the deepest cuts of all should be
in the health sciences, for I thought that if we had consensus
anywhere, it was that we badly need more health practitioners," he
said.
The employee layoffs, he added, would come because of cuts in
research funds of the Atomic Energy Commission.
"I wish it were otherwise but it looked as if by the first of July we
will have to let go several hundred employees at the two Lawrence
Laboratories at Berkeley and Livermore and at the Los Alamos
Scientific Laboratory," Hitch said.
