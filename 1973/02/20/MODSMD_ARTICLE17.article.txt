# Earthquake Prediction Method Hypothesized
## 
### 
Peculiar changes in seismic
waves that occur just ahead of
earthquakes could be a way of
predicting earth tremors in a
specific area, but the experts have
been unwilling to trust an
indicator they didn't understand.
But now a geophysicist here,
Prof. Amos Nur, offers an
explanation based on laboratory
research that should make
monitoring of seismic wave
velocities one of the most exciting
new possibilities for accurate
earthquake prediction.
The odd seismic phenomenon
was first noted by Russian
geologists a few "years ago. They
studied small earthquakes near the
town of Garm in the Tadzhik
Socialist Soviet Republic.
Before every large tremor they
detected small changes in the
relative speeds of seismic
compressional (straight-line)

waves and shear (crosswise) waves.
They measured a decrease in
velocity ratio between the two of
something over 10 percent.
After a period of time the ratio
would begin to rise again,
returning to its original level or
even higher. That's when an
earthquake occurred.
The strength of the tremor was
directly related to the length of
time between changes in the ratio.
The longer the interval — days,
months, or even years — the
stronger the earthquake.
The degree of change seemed
unrelated to severity.
In laboratory experiments, Nur
had been studying the effects of
stress on seismic waves in rock for
some time. He found that when
pressure opened up tiny cracks in
the rock, both types of seismic
waves were slowed down, though
at different rates.
