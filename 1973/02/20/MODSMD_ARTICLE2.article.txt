# Holman, Burt Married In Court; Trial May Begin Later This Week
## 
### TERRY ANZUR 
Andrea Holman and Benton
Douglas Burt, charged with murder
and lynching in connection with the
October Chino prison escape of
Ronald Beaty, were married last
Thursday by their attorney, Charles
Garry.
As husband and wife, the Burts
cannot be forced to testify against one
another when their case moves into
the trial phase today in San
Bernardino County Superior Court.
Jury selection is not expected to begin
until late this week, however.
Defense attorney Garry said he did
not perform the marriage to enable his
clients to take advantage of marital
privilege in court. "That had nothing
to do with it,"he claimed. "They're
very much in love and they wanted to
get married."
Garry conducted the ceremony at a
counsel table in the courtroom during
a recess in a pretrial hearing. State law
permits any clergyman to marry two
people who have been living together,
without requiring a marriage license or
health certificate.
Garry is a minister of the Universal
Life Church. Its founder, the Rev.
Kirby J. Hensley of Modesto, claims
he has "ordained" more than 200,000
persons who mailed him an application
and a one-dollar fee.
In 1969, Hensley was found guilty
of violating state law by illegally
conferring unaccredited divinity
degrees. But last week, Hensley filed a
declaratory relief suit against the
attorney general's office, asking legal
clearance for his mail-order ministry
operation.
Judge Opposes Wedding
Judge Joseph B. Campbell, who is
hearing pre-trial motions in the
Holman-Burt case, does not approve of
the marriage. Two weeks ago, Garry
requested the court's help in obtaining
a marriage license and marrying
Holman and Burt, but the judge
refused his request.
"Marriage contemplates
togetherness, and they are incarcerated
in separate parts of the county jail,"
commented Campbell. "If they had
wanted to get married, it should have
been done before the trial."
Campbell said he was unaware the
marriage had taken place until he read
about it in a newspaper the following
morning.
Father's Reactions
The father of the bride, Medicine
Prof. Halsted Holman, called the
marriage "an alternative," the only

one available to the couple. "They've
been planning to be married for a
couple of months," he said.
Holman gave the marriage his
blessing and said he was not concerned
that the ceremony was performed by a
mail-order minister. "If they wish,
they can have a full formal wedding
with all the regalia when they get
out," he added. "We welcome Doug to
the family."
The newlyweds returned to

separate cells after the ceremony to
await the opening of their trial. Garry
intends to introduce several pre-trial
motions in court today which should
further delay the start of the jury
selection.
Venue Change Denied
The case will be heard in the San
Bernardino courtroom of Judge
Thomas Haldorsen. Defense appeals
for a change of venue in the case have
been denied in both San Bernardino

County Superior Court and the State
Court of Appeals. The State Supreme
Court rejected another appeal to move
the trial last Wednesday.
Holman and Burt are charged with
murder and lynching (removing a
prisoner from custody) in connection
with Beaty's escape from the
California Institution for Men at Chino
last Oct. 6. One prison guard was
killed and another wounded in the
incident.

degrees. But last week, Hensley filed a
declaratory relief suit against the
attorney general's office, asking legal
clearance for his mail-order ministry
operation.
Judge Opposes Wedding
Judge Joseph B. Campbell, who is
hearing pre-trial motions in the
Holman-Burt case, does not approve of
the marriage. Two weeks ago, Garry
requested the court's help in obtaining
a marriage license and marrying
Holman and Burt, but the judge
refused his request.
"Marriage contemplates
togetherness, and they are incarcerated
in separate parts of the county jail,"
commented Campbell. "If they had
wanted to get married, it should have
been done before the trial."
Campbell said he was unaware the
marriage had taken place until he read
about it in a newspaper the following
morning.
Father's Reactions
The father of the bride, Medicine
Prof. Halsted Holman, called the
marriage "an alternative," the only

one available to the couple. "They've
been planning to be married for a
couple of months," he said.
Holman gave the marriage his
blessing and said he was not concerned
that the ceremony was performed by a
mail-order minister. "If they wish,
they can have a full formal wedding
with all the regalia when they get
out," he added. "We welcome Doug to
the family."
The newlyweds returned to

separate cells after the ceremony to
await the opening of their trial. Garry
intends to introduce several pre-trial
motions in court today which should
further delay the start of the jury
selection.
Venue Change Denied
The case will be heard in the San
Bernardino courtroom of Judge
Thomas Haldorsen. Defense appeals
for a change of venue in the case have
been denied in both San Bernardino

County Superior Court and the State
Court of Appeals. The State Supreme
Court rejected another appeal to move
the trial last Wednesday.
Holman and Burt are charged with
murder and lynching (removing a
prisoner from custody) in connection
with Beaty's escape from the
California Institution for Men at Chino
last Oct. 6. One prison guard was
killed and another wounded in the
incident.
Andrea Holman and Benton
Douglas Burt, charged with murder
and lynching in connection with the
October Chino prison escape of
Ronald Beaty, were married last
Thursday by their attorney, Charles
Garry.
As husband and wife, the Burts
cannot be forced to testify against one
another when their case moves into
the trial phase today in San
Bernardino County Superior Court.
Jury selection is not expected to begin
until late this week, however.
Defense attorney Garry said he did
not perform the marriage to enable his
clients to take advantage of marital
privilege in court. "That had nothing
to do with it,"he claimed. "They're
very much in love and they wanted to
get married."
Garry conducted the ceremony at a
counsel table in the courtroom during
a recess in a pretrial hearing. State law
permits any clergyman to marry two
people who have been living together,
without requiring a marriage license or
health certificate.
Garry is a minister of the Universal
Life Church. Its founder, the Rev.
Kirby J. Hensley of Modesto, claims
he has "ordained" more than 200,000
persons who mailed him an application
and a one-dollar fee.
In 1969, Hensley was found guilty
of violating state law by illegally
conferring unaccredited divinity
degrees. But last week, Hensley filed a
declaratory relief suit against the
attorney general's office, asking legal
clearance for his mail-order ministry
operation.
