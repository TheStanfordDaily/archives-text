# Artist's Co-op To Open In Tresidder
## 
### KITTY PATTERSON 
An independent craftsman runs a heavy
risk of going broke. Unless he sets up his own
booth, he ends up buying retail and selling
wholesale. If he sets up his own booth, he
may not sell at all.
Wendy West, a Stanford senior, tried to
support herself last summer by making batik
hangings and selling them to stores. She barely
broke even.- She was lucky not to lose money.
When she returned to Stanford this fall, she
decided to help other artists overcome the
problems she had faced. With the help of a
few other students, Tresidder Union, SCIRE,
and the Dean of Students Office, she has set
up the Stanford Design Co-op.
The organization will operate a purchasing
cooperative, find workspace for artists in the
Stanford community, collect information on
other outlets in the Bay Area, and publish a
newsletter.
Membership Fee
The Co-op will charge a membership fee of
about five dollars. Members of the group will
be able to exhibit some of their work at the
organization's gallery on Tresidder's second
floor.
The purchasing co-op will help artists and
craftsmen obtain materials at reduced prices.
If an artist orders materials alone, he must
order at retail prices. If enough people place
an order simultaneously, they can get
materials at wholesale or near-wholesale
prices.
The Co-op will not stock goods. "Members

can come to us with an order," explains West.
"When we have enough orders for one item,
we'll send someone to purchase it in bulk."
Workshops
West also hopes the Co-op can initiate
workshops for crafts and find workspace for
artisans. Right now, there is no campus center
for crafts classes.
Says West, "The Art Department so
emphasizes the fine arts — painting and
sculpture — that they pretty much ignore
everything else. What's more, unless you want
to devote yourself entirely to being an artist,
its teachers don't pay much attention to
you."
Co-op members don't have to be
professional artists, just people interested in
practicing on and selling their crafts. West and
other founders are now gathering detailed
information on stores, galleries, and crafts
fairs in the area.
"Some of the galleries and fairs practically
steal artists' work," complains West. The
monthly newsletter will let artists know which
places to contact and which ones to avoid.
Center Of Business
Co-op business will center around the art
gallery. Members will go there to place their
orders.
The gallery will present the work of a few
artists at a time. Its focus may shift from
paintings one week to glass-blowing the next,
to quilting the week after that. It may even
show children's art, collected from children of
Stanford students, faculty, and staff.

Tresidder administration has stressed that
membership in the Co-op be restricted to
members of the Stanford community. The
Co-op will broaden the definition as much as
possible. It welcomes Stanford graduates, and
faculty and staff families — in short, anyone
in any way associated with the University.
All art in the gallery will be on sale. The
Co-op will take a 10 to 15 percent
commission. The artist will receive the
balance.
All Kinds Of Help
The Co-op has received help from all
directions. The Dean of Students Office has
offered $357 from its Initiative Fund as seed
money. Ron Jones of SCIRE has provided
"moral support, really good ideas" and 11
units of independent study for West.
Probably the greatest help has come from
Jean Martin. Tresidder's Community Services
Department was established last quarter, as
part of Tresidder's face-lifting campaign.
West's proposal came at the right time.
Explains Martin, "It seemed like the first step
to get student-innovated programs
started . . . Tresidder's image has been bad,
let's face it." The department is working hard
to change it.
With money, space and contacts, the Co-op
seems ready to go. The gallery will open next
week. All the group needs now are a few
volunteers to keep the gallery open several
hours a day. Anyone interested in working for
the Co-Op can contact it by writing to P.O.
