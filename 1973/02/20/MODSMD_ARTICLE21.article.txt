## TV Rock: Good News & Bad 
### 
Like premarital sex and
interracial couples, American
television has historically avoided
serious rock music. TV's regressive
attitude was epitomized when the
Stones had to change "Let's
Spend The Night Together" to
"Let's Spend The Evening
Together" before they could
perform the song on the Ed
Sullivan Show.
For many years, rock's only
exposure came in the form of
"American Bandstand,"
"Shindig," "Hullaballo" and the
other bubble gum shows. Groups
mouthed their recorded hits while
teenyboppers plodded around the
dance floor and listened intently
to ads for products like
"Hickey-Off Pimple Pads."
But recently television has
shown signs of reaching puberty.
Some previously "taboo" subjects
are now discussed, "damn" is said
more frequently and somebody
even said "bitch" on the Johnny
Carson Show the other night,
although he had to qualify it by
saying he was talking about a
female dog. Now ABC and NBC
are trying to capture the "youth
market" with late night rock
shows on Friday nights.
ABC's "In Concert" appears
twice a month while NBC's
"Midnight Special" comes on
weekly. The shows resemble each
other in some ways. Both
programs are in color and both are
90 minutes long. Other than that,
the two programs are as different
as AM and FM radio.
Good News
Being in an optimisitic mood,
I'll discuss the good news before
the bad news. "In Concert" makes
a serious attempt at presenting
good rock music. The show is
filmed at actual concerts; each of
the four groups that appear during
the show gets to play much more
than the usual AM sized cut that
is the rule on most TV shows.
Unfortunately, "In Concert" is
pock-marked by an unbelievable
numbers of ads. Luckily there are
rarely any for acne creams, but
there are plenty of typically inane
ones, including the atrocious "lot
of soap for a lot of woman"
Palmolive ad.
The quality of music on "In
Concert" is probably the best in
television history. A wide range of
groups have usually performed
well; the camera work is
outstanding. Broadcasting the
shows simultaneously on
KSFX-FM in stereo certainly aids
the success of the series.
Fine Quality
I missed the first half of last
Friday's show, but Billy Preston
and the Hollies sounded verv

good. They seemed to be
maintaining the quality of the
series. I did hear all of the
previous "In Concert" and The
Doobie Brothers, Jim Croce and
War all played admirably.
Edgar Winter wasn't very
impressive on that same show,
but, despite a few other losers in
the series, "In Concert" is an
extremely welcome addition to
what is still a terribly
underutilized medium.
Now for the bad news. I was
shocked to learn that Dick Clark
is the executive producer of "In
Concert" when "Midnight
Special" is really his kind of show.
About eight acts appear on each
"Midnight Special." They are run
on and off stage as quickly as on
AM radio. Each show features a
guest host and in the three shows
so far, Helen Reddy, Johnny
Rivers and Mac Davis have made
an already bad show almost
intolerable.
After seeing Reddy host the
debut show, I began to wonder if
she's the idiot behind that
Palmolive ad I hate so much.
Helen even told her life story by
using the names of rock groups;
that was even stupider than I
thought it would be.
The next week Johnny Rivers
said "far-out" almost as often as
Mark Spitz says "you know" in
his stomach-turning milk ads. Mac
Davis started out his evening as
host by singing his terrible hit,
"Don't Get Hooked On Me," and
the rest of his performance made
sure that people wouldn't.
A number of good groups have
appeared on "Midnight Special,",
but they have been hopelessly
constrained by the show's format.
Billy Preston did a typically fine
job last Friday; the producers
even let him play for more than
3 minutes. But this show does
most groups a definite injustice.
Billy Paul, who was responsible
for that piece of garbage, "Me and

Mrs. Jones," appeared on the last
show. He was perfect for such a
low-quality series.
The best part of "Midnight
Special" is probably the 7-Up ads.
To sum up my opinion of this
show, I'm going to tell another

good news-bad news joke. Good
news—My daughter just got
engaged to a multi-millionaire.
Bad news—his name is David
Cassidy. "In Concert" is quite
enjoyable but "Midnight Special"
is a bonafide bomb.

ABC's "In Concert" appears
twice a month while NBC's
"Midnight Special" comes on
weekly. The shows resemble each
other in some ways. Both
programs are in color and both are
90 minutes long. Other than that,
the two programs are as different
as AM and FM radio.
Good News
Being in an optimisitic mood,
I'll discuss the good news before
the bad news. "In Concert" makes
a serious attempt at presenting
good rock music. The show is
filmed at actual concerts; each of
the four groups that appear during
the show gets to play much more
than the usual AM sized cut that
is the rule on most TV shows.
Unfortunately, "In Concert" is
pock-marked by an unbelievable
numbers of ads. Luckily there are
rarely any for acne creams, but
there are plenty of typically inane
ones, including the atrocious "lot
of soap for a lot of woman"
Palmolive ad.
The quality of music on "In
Concert" is probably the best in
television history. A wide range of
groups have usually performed
well; the camera work is
outstanding. Broadcasting the
shows simultaneously on
KSFX-FM in stereo certainly aids
the success of the series.
Fine Quality
I missed the first half of last
Friday's show, but Billy Preston
and the Hollies sounded verv

good. They seemed to be
maintaining the quality of the
series. I did hear all of the
previous "In Concert" and The
Doobie Brothers, Jim Croce and
War all played admirably.
Edgar Winter wasn't very
impressive on that same show,
but, despite a few other losers in
the series, "In Concert" is an
extremely welcome addition to
what is still a terribly
underutilized medium.
Now for the bad news. I was
shocked to learn that Dick Clark
is the executive producer of "In
Concert" when "Midnight
Special" is really his kind of show.
About eight acts appear on each
"Midnight Special." They are run
on and off stage as quickly as on
AM radio. Each show features a
guest host and in the three shows
so far, Helen Reddy, Johnny
Rivers and Mac Davis have made
an already bad show almost
intolerable.
After seeing Reddy host the
debut show, I began to wonder if
she's the idiot behind that
Palmolive ad I hate so much.
Helen even told her life story by
using the names of rock groups;
that was even stupider than I
thought it would be.
The next week Johnny Rivers
said "far-out" almost as often as
Mark Spitz says "you know" in
his stomach-turning milk ads. Mac
Davis started out his evening as
host by singing his terrible hit,
"Don't Get Hooked On Me," and
the rest of his performance made
sure that people wouldn't.
A number of good groups have
appeared on "Midnight Special,",
but they have been hopelessly
constrained by the show's format.
Billy Preston did a typically fine
job last Friday; the producers
even let him play for more than
3 minutes. But this show does
most groups a definite injustice.
Billy Paul, who was responsible
for that piece of garbage, "Me and

Mrs. Jones," appeared on the last
show. He was perfect for such a
low-quality series.
The best part of "Midnight
Special" is probably the 7-Up ads.
To sum up my opinion of this
show, I'm going to tell another

good news-bad news joke. Good
news—My daughter just got
engaged to a multi-millionaire.
Bad news—his name is David
Cassidy. "In Concert" is quite
enjoyable but "Midnight Special"
is a bonafide bomb.

Like premarital sex and
interracial couples, American
television has historically avoided
serious rock music. TV's regressive
attitude was epitomized when the
Stones had to change "Let's
Spend The Night Together" to
"Let's Spend The Evening
Together" before they could
perform the song on the Ed
Sullivan Show.
For many years, rock's only
exposure came in the form of
"American Bandstand,"
"Shindig," "Hullaballo" and the
other bubble gum shows. Groups
mouthed their recorded hits while
teenyboppers plodded around the
dance floor and listened intently
to ads for products like
"Hickey-Off Pimple Pads."
But recently television has
shown signs of reaching puberty.
Some previously "taboo" subjects
are now discussed, "damn" is said
more frequently and somebody
even said "bitch" on the Johnny
Carson Show the other night,
although he had to qualify it by
saying he was talking about a
female dog. Now ABC and NBC
are trying to capture the "youth
market" with late night rock
shows on Friday nights.

shows simultaneously on
KSFX-FM in stereo certainly aids
the success of the series.
Fine Quality
I missed the first half of last
Friday's show, but Billy Preston
and the Hollies sounded verv

good. They seemed to be
maintaining the quality of the
series. I did hear all of the
previous "In Concert" and The
Doobie Brothers, Jim Croce and
War all played admirably.
Edgar Winter wasn't very
impressive on that same show,
but, despite a few other losers in
the series, "In Concert" is an
extremely welcome addition to
what is still a terribly
underutilized medium.
Now for the bad news. I was
shocked to learn that Dick Clark
is the executive producer of "In
Concert" when "Midnight
Special" is really his kind of show.
About eight acts appear on each
"Midnight Special." They are run
on and off stage as quickly as on
AM radio. Each show features a
guest host and in the three shows
so far, Helen Reddy, Johnny
Rivers and Mac Davis have made
an already bad show almost
intolerable.
After seeing Reddy host the
debut show, I began to wonder if
she's the idiot behind that
Palmolive ad I hate so much.
Helen even told her life story by
using the names of rock groups;
that was even stupider than I
thought it would be.
The next week Johnny Rivers
said "far-out" almost as often as
Mark Spitz says "you know" in
his stomach-turning milk ads. Mac
Davis started out his evening as
host by singing his terrible hit,
"Don't Get Hooked On Me," and
the rest of his performance made
sure that people wouldn't.
A number of good groups have
appeared on "Midnight Special,",
but they have been hopelessly
constrained by the show's format.
Billy Preston did a typically fine
job last Friday; the producers
even let him play for more than
3 minutes. But this show does
most groups a definite injustice.
Billy Paul, who was responsible
for that piece of garbage, "Me and

Mrs. Jones," appeared on the last
show. He was perfect for such a
low-quality series.
The best part of "Midnight
Special" is probably the 7-Up ads.
To sum up my opinion of this
show, I'm going to tell another

good news-bad news joke. Good
news—My daughter just got
engaged to a multi-millionaire.
Bad news—his name is David
Cassidy. "In Concert" is quite
enjoyable but "Midnight Special"
is a bonafide bomb.

Like premarital sex and
interracial couples, American
television has historically avoided
serious rock music. TV's regressive
attitude was epitomized when the
Stones had to change "Let's
Spend The Night Together" to
"Let's Spend The Evening
Together" before they could
perform the song on the Ed
Sullivan Show.
For many years, rock's only
exposure came in the form of
"American Bandstand,"
"Shindig," "Hullaballo" and the
other bubble gum shows. Groups
mouthed their recorded hits while
teenyboppers plodded around the
dance floor and listened intently
to ads for products like
"Hickey-Off Pimple Pads."
But recently television has
shown signs of reaching puberty.
Some previously "taboo" subjects
are now discussed, "damn" is said
more frequently and somebody
even said "bitch" on the Johnny
Carson Show the other night,
although he had to qualify it by
saying he was talking about a
female dog. Now ABC and NBC
are trying to capture the "youth
market" with late night rock
shows on Friday nights.
ABC's "In Concert" appears
twice a month while NBC's
"Midnight Special" comes on
weekly. The shows resemble each
other in some ways. Both
programs are in color and both are
90 minutes long. Other than that,
the two programs are as different
as AM and FM radio.
Good News
Being in an optimisitic mood,
I'll discuss the good news before
the bad news. "In Concert" makes
a serious attempt at presenting
good rock music. The show is
filmed at actual concerts; each of
the four groups that appear during
the show gets to play much more
than the usual AM sized cut that
is the rule on most TV shows.
Unfortunately, "In Concert" is
pock-marked by an unbelievable
numbers of ads. Luckily there are
rarely any for acne creams, but
there are plenty of typically inane
ones, including the atrocious "lot
of soap for a lot of woman"
Palmolive ad.
The quality of music on "In
Concert" is probably the best in
television history. A wide range of
groups have usually performed
well; the camera work is
outstanding. Broadcasting the
shows simultaneously on
KSFX-FM in stereo certainly aids
the success of the series.
