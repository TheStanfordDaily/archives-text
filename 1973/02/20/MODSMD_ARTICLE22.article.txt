## Akiyama & Ashkenazy Don't Mix 
### KITTY PATTERSON 
A conductor can make or
break a piece. He can also simply
beat along and lead a fine
orchestra in a dull performance. A
good pianist can turn in a
top-notch solo concerto
performance, but he can rarely
salvage the piece from a wreckage
of poor conducting.
Last Wednesday, guest
conductor Kazuyoshi Akiyama
led the symphony through bad
periods, good periods, and
excellent ones. Unfortunately, one
of the bad periods came when
Vladimir Ashkenazy performed
Beethoven's Third Piano
Concerto.
The concert began on a fine
note, with Tohru Takemitsu's
"Green for Orchestra (November
Steps No. 2)". The composition is
interesting. Takemitsu, a great
admirer of Debussy, attempted to
fulfill a "wish to enter into the
secrets of Debussy's music."
The product of Takemitsu's
labor combines the mysterious
quality often associated with
Japanese music with the
multi-colored style of Debussy.
Stunned Audience
The orchestra played
excellently. The final decrescendo
in all the instruments left the
audience stunned. The orchestra
diminished gradually from a
fortissimo to an almost inaudible,
but precise pianissimo.
Akiyama was at home in this
selection. He possessed an innate
sense for his countryman's music.
He conducted with a calculated
ferocity unparalleled since
Berns.ein performed his
acrobatics weekly. Akiyama
controlled the orchestra and
communicated back and forth
with it.
In the final offering,
Prokofieffs Seventh Symphony,
despite Akiyama's balletics and
conducting power, the woodwinds
kept this reviewer's attention
riveted. The bassoon navigated
showly and tricky passages easily.
The dialogues between it and the
oboe, especially in the third
movement, sounded both playful
and gentle.
Poor Cellos
The rest of the orchestra
almost met the woodwinds'
calibre. Occasionally, the cellos
fell apart, especially in the runs in
the first movement. It sounded as
if a few cellos were slightly
off-key and a little behind the
tempo. Yet the other strings
performed skillfully throughout.
Even the viola section, which
sometimes lacks precision, held its
own in the few passages where it
held the top line.
Except for one painful trumpet
blast in the second movement, the

horns emitted no off-key notes
and blared out in none of the
wrong places.
The disappointment of the
evening was the Beethoven
concerto. Ashkenazy performed
excellently, but Akiyama backed
him up with a painfully slow,
lackluster orchestra.
Snail's Pace
Akiyama started the first
movement at a snail's pace. Part
of the slow-down came, no doubt,
at Ashkenazy's request.
Ashkenazy often slows down
pieces so that he can milk the
expressive passages for everything
they're worth, and so that his
less-than-perfect left hand need
not work so fast on the technical
passages.
The tempo Akiyama chose,
however, lay far below
Ashkenazy's preferences. When
Ashkenazy came in, he tried to
speed up the orchestra. Many of
the orchestra's members were
probably hoping that he would
succeed. He failed. The tempo
dragged on. Luckily, the second
movement is already marked
"largo." Only in the last
movement did Ashkenazy seem
content with his tempo.
The orchestra played

technically well, on the whole,
but with no spirit. The French
horns went off key several times
in the last movement and stuck
out too much in the first
movement. Again, the cellos
sounded off pitch at times, but
the general technical quality one
would expect remained.
Brilliant Solo Performance
Ashkenazy turned in a brilliant
solo performance. He played the
expressive passages with a pathos
that defies comparison. He has a
unique way of leaning into the
notes. He does not play notes; he
strokes them.
The technical faults he made
did not outbalance the beauty he
produced in other places. He
overpedalled somewhat in the first
movement. His left hand runs,
especially low in the bass, grew
indistinct. But he usually skipped
up and down the piano gracefully.
In the brilliant passages, he played
forcefully. In the portamento
passages, he played playfully. But
in the romantic places, he played
exquisitely.
Unfortunately, Akiyama paid
little attention to Ashkenazy.
There was no communication
between performer and
conductor.
