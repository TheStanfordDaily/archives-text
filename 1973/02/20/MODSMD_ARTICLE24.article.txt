# Great Skiing Conditions Abound On Sierra Slopes
## 
### SCOTT OSWALD 
For most Bay Area residents,
this winter has been one of the
most miserable on record. Most of
us have been asking ourselves the
question, when is all this *+%!
rain going to stop. For anyone
who skis, though, the monsoon
season has produced some of the
best snow conditions in years.
The mountains have been
getting snow nearly as frequently
as we have rain, so when one
considers how much it has rained,
it is no wonder that the
mountains have accumulated a
tremendous snow base. In
addition, low temperatures have
generally prevailed, making the
quality of snow excellent. By
quality snow we are talking about
fresh, light powder snow—the best

there is. There is perhaps no
greater sensation (well, almost!)
than skiing down a slope
blanketed with two to three feet
of light, powder snow. The feeling
is somewhat analogous to floating
on a cloud (which most Stanford
students have most likely
experienced by some means or
another!). Throughout this year
there have probably been more
days with excellent conditions
than any year recently.
Hassles
Despite these prevailing great
conditions many people are
discouraged by all the "hassles"
involved with skiing. Without a
doubt, there are probably more
problems involved with skiing
than any other sport: hassles like
the four hour drive, frustration

obtaining the right equipment,
battles with the weather, broken
bones, and Ist but definitely not
least—the cost (s+s+s=!%*!).
There are, though, ways in which
one can get around these
problems, or at least make them a
bit more bearable.
As far as the four hour drive
goes you can pretty well plan on
it, unless you have a lot of money
to shell out for traffic tickets or
have your own private Lear jet.
Neither possibility is very feasible
so you should look for ways of
making the drive more pleasant.
Switching drivers is a must and
enables everyone to obtain at least
a little sleep on the way up. As a
rule getting up at 4:30 AM
Saturday morning is a drag,
especially if one was in an altered
state Friday night—so any sleep
on the way up is greatly
appreciated. Generally if you
leave campus by 4:30 AM on any
given morning, you will miss most
of the traffic both in the Bay
Area, and on Donner pass.
To obtain the right equipment,
shopping around is a must.
Getting the "right equipment
means buying in a price range you
can afford, and getting gear that
fits your style of skiing and your
body. This means skis the correct
length, poles the right height, and
most importantly boots that are
comfortable in the ski shop and
on the slope. Anyone that has
skiied in boots that do not fit just
right know what pain is.
The agony experienced by a
poor fit is often enough to ruin
your day, not to mention your

feet. Most of the better boots
today are foam fitted, so that
getting the proper fit is not such a
problem. In buyin the less
expensive non-foamed boot one
must be very careful to be sure
they are comfortable or one will
pay for it in blisters, bone spurs,
and othe;delights.
Ski length, of course, depends
on your size and your ability.
Beginners should get shorter skis
to make turning easier. As far as

poles go, the old under the armpit
rule no longer holds, as shorter
poles are now desired. Most ski
shops are very good in giving
sound, honest advice, but it is still
a good idea to bring a
knowledgeable person along when
purchasing equipment.
Unfortunately, good
equipment costs money. Getting
equipment cheaply requires a
good deal of searching. Generally
the best time to buy is at the end
of the season when distributors
want to unloadtheir old stock.
Once one purchases all the
necessary equipment, the cost
does not end. Most areas now
charge in the neighborhood of
nine dollars during the weekend
for a lift pass. At this price it is
amazing the number still skiing.

One of the best way to beat the
cost is to go up during the week.
Not only are the lifts and lodgings
cheaper (up to half price), but the
lines are usually non-existant.
Instead of getting ten runs for
nine dollars on a busy weekend,
twenty to thirty runs can be taken
for a mere five to six dollars. So
during the week you don't have to
hassle the lines, cost, or those
classes you hate.
Once you get over all the

inconviences and finally make it
to the slopes, it is stupendous.
Our own Tahoe area is one of the
most beautiful places to ski in the
country. With over twenty areas
within an hour's drive of each
other there is plenty of variety.
The following is a critical
analysis of some of the key areas
at Lake Tahoe:
Squaw Valley: This site of the
1960 Olympic Games is probably
the best all-around area at Tahoe.
With nineteen chair lifts, a
gondola, and a tram it has about
the best variety to be found
anywhere. It has excellent slopes
for all classes of skiiers. For the
beginners happiness will be found
on runs off the Links, Belmont,
Bunny Platters, and Baily Beach
chairs. For the intermediate,

Riviera, East Broadway, Emigrant,
and Cornice No. 1 chairs offer
comparitively good runs. Kcr the
expert Squaw has perhaps the best
and greatest number of difficult
slopes.
The great classic at Squaw is of
course the overwhelming KT-22.
The name originated after one of
its first skiiers took twenty-two
kicty turns (hence KT-22) to
negotiate it. Although not nearly
as bad as the title suggests, it

definitely does have a number of
challenging runs from the ton.
Any chair 5000 feet long with a
vertical drop of 1850 feet has got
to be good. Squaw also fairs quite
well in the apres-ski department,
with a number of lively night
spots. Squaws' greatest drawback
comes as a result of its
assets—crowds. If you don't mind
the crowds and nine dollar lift
ticket you will surely enjoy
Squaw.
Slide Mountain: A fairly good
area with three chairs and
generally few people. Slide serves
as training grounds for the
Incomparable Leland Stanford
Junior University Ski team
(because of the half price tickets
Slide offers the team). It is only a
few miles from Reno, so you can
practically ski to the casinos after
a day skiing.
Heavenly Valley: Located right
at South Lake Tahoe, Heavenly
Valley boats the largest ski area in
the United States. Like Squaw it
has a tremendous selection of
good runs for all types of skiiers.
Heavenly has runs in both
California and Nevada.
The Nevada side is generally
less crowded and it seems to be
the general consensus that the
runs are more enjoyable. On the

California side is the well known
Gunbarrel, Heavenly's answer to
Squaw's KT-22. The base of the
mountain is only a few minutes
from South Lake Tahoe where the
night life is always popping.
Alpine Meadows: A relatively
new resort, Alpine is known for
its excellent family atmosphere
and good skiing. Originally, with
just three chair lifts, they have
expanded to seven chairs, giving a
variety of slopes and exposures.
Built around the Summit Chair
are two excellent bowls and a
challenging face under the chair
for expert hot dogs.
Alpine is also known among
locals as excellent for kangaroo
and cliff jumping. Local expert
Mike Wood describes one jump as
the "harriest mother I've ever had
the guts to take." Night life per se
is minimal, although the crowd at
the bar between 4-6 while the
parking lot clears is usually young
and provocative.
Incline: A new resort, it is
nestled just on the Nevada side at
North Lake Tahoe. Built with the
beginner to intermediate in mind
the chairs are named by their
colors and offer medium length
runs. It is known for its wide open
slopes overlooking beautiful Lake
Tahoe.
Sugar Bowl: Owned and
operated by Walt Disney, Sugar
Bowl is a great little resort. As a
rule it is not very crowded and a
very friendly atmosphere prevails
(and no, people don't walk
around with Mickey Mouse hats
on). On a good weekend day one
rarely waits longer than five to ten
minutes in line. Sugar Bowl has
some very interesting runs for
beginners and intermediates.
Under the main chair to the
summit is a very interesting and
challenging run with rapidly
changing terrain. Being the closest
area to Stanford, the Bowl stars as
the weekday palace. Along with
being vacant of people, a weekday
ticket only costs $4.50, a bargain
at twice the price! This area has a
lot going for it and I see it
expanding in the near future.

With nineteen chair lifts, a
gondola, and a tram it has about
the best variety to be found
anywhere. It has excellent slopes
for all classes of skiiers. For the
beginners happiness will be found
on runs off the Links, Belmont,
Bunny Platters, and Baily Beach
chairs. For the intermediate,

Riviera, East Broadway, Emigrant,
and Cornice No. 1 chairs offer
comparitively good runs. Kcr the
expert Squaw has perhaps the best
and greatest number of difficult
slopes.
The great classic at Squaw is of
course the overwhelming KT-22.
The name originated after one of
its first skiiers took twenty-two
kicty turns (hence KT-22) to
negotiate it. Although not nearly
as bad as the title suggests, it

definitely does have a number of
challenging runs from the ton.
Any chair 5000 feet long with a
vertical drop of 1850 feet has got
to be good. Squaw also fairs quite
well in the apres-ski department,
with a number of lively night
spots. Squaws' greatest drawback
comes as a result of its
assets—crowds. If you don't mind
the crowds and nine dollar lift
ticket you will surely enjoy
Squaw.
Slide Mountain: A fairly good
area with three chairs and
generally few people. Slide serves
as training grounds for the
Incomparable Leland Stanford
Junior University Ski team
(because of the half price tickets
Slide offers the team). It is only a
few miles from Reno, so you can
practically ski to the casinos after
a day skiing.
Heavenly Valley: Located right
at South Lake Tahoe, Heavenly
Valley boats the largest ski area in
the United States. Like Squaw it
has a tremendous selection of
good runs for all types of skiiers.
Heavenly has runs in both
California and Nevada.
The Nevada side is generally
less crowded and it seems to be
the general consensus that the
runs are more enjoyable. On the

California side is the well known
Gunbarrel, Heavenly's answer to
Squaw's KT-22. The base of the
mountain is only a few minutes
from South Lake Tahoe where the
night life is always popping.
Alpine Meadows: A relatively
new resort, Alpine is known for
its excellent family atmosphere
and good skiing. Originally, with
just three chair lifts, they have
expanded to seven chairs, giving a
variety of slopes and exposures.
Built around the Summit Chair
are two excellent bowls and a
challenging face under the chair
for expert hot dogs.
Alpine is also known among
locals as excellent for kangaroo
and cliff jumping. Local expert
Mike Wood describes one jump as
the "harriest mother I've ever had
the guts to take." Night life per se
is minimal, although the crowd at
the bar between 4-6 while the
parking lot clears is usually young
and provocative.
Incline: A new resort, it is
nestled just on the Nevada side at
North Lake Tahoe. Built with the
beginner to intermediate in mind
the chairs are named by their
colors and offer medium length
runs. It is known for its wide open
slopes overlooking beautiful Lake
Tahoe.
Sugar Bowl: Owned and
operated by Walt Disney, Sugar
Bowl is a great little resort. As a
rule it is not very crowded and a
very friendly atmosphere prevails
(and no, people don't walk
around with Mickey Mouse hats
on). On a good weekend day one
rarely waits longer than five to ten
minutes in line. Sugar Bowl has
some very interesting runs for
beginners and intermediates.
Under the main chair to the
summit is a very interesting and
challenging run with rapidly
changing terrain. Being the closest
area to Stanford, the Bowl stars as
the weekday palace. Along with
being vacant of people, a weekday
ticket only costs $4.50, a bargain
at twice the price! This area has a
lot going for it and I see it
expanding in the near future.

For most Bay Area residents,
this winter has been one of the
most miserable on record. Most of
us have been asking ourselves the
question, when is all this *+%!
rain going to stop. For anyone
who skis, though, the monsoon
season has produced some of the
best snow conditions in years.
The mountains have been
getting snow nearly as frequently
as we have rain, so when one
considers how much it has rained,
it is no wonder that the
mountains have accumulated a
tremendous snow base. In
addition, low temperatures have
generally prevailed, making the
quality of snow excellent. By
quality snow we are talking about
fresh, light powder snow—the best

there is. There is perhaps no
greater sensation (well, almost!)
than skiing down a slope
blanketed with two to three feet
of light, powder snow. The feeling
is somewhat analogous to floating
on a cloud (which most Stanford
students have most likely
experienced by some means or
another!). Throughout this year
there have probably been more
days with excellent conditions
than any year recently.
Hassles
Despite these prevailing great
conditions many people are
discouraged by all the "hassles"
involved with skiing. Without a
doubt, there are probably more
problems involved with skiing
than any other sport: hassles like
the four hour drive, frustration

obtaining the right equipment,
battles with the weather, broken
bones, and Ist but definitely not
least—the cost (s+s+s=!%*!).
There are, though, ways in which
one can get around these
problems, or at least make them a
bit more bearable.
As far as the four hour drive
goes you can pretty well plan on
it, unless you have a lot of money
to shell out for traffic tickets or
have your own private Lear jet.
Neither possibility is very feasible
so you should look for ways of
making the drive more pleasant.
Switching drivers is a must and
enables everyone to obtain at least
a little sleep on the way up. As a
rule getting up at 4:30 AM
Saturday morning is a drag,
especially if one was in an altered
state Friday night—so any sleep
on the way up is greatly
appreciated. Generally if you
leave campus by 4:30 AM on any
given morning, you will miss most
of the traffic both in the Bay
Area, and on Donner pass.
To obtain the right equipment,
shopping around is a must.
Getting the "right equipment
means buying in a price range you
can afford, and getting gear that
fits your style of skiing and your
body. This means skis the correct
length, poles the right height, and
most importantly boots that are
comfortable in the ski shop and
on the slope. Anyone that has
skiied in boots that do not fit just
right know what pain is.
The agony experienced by a
poor fit is often enough to ruin
your day, not to mention your

feet. Most of the better boots
today are foam fitted, so that
getting the proper fit is not such a
problem. In buyin the less
expensive non-foamed boot one
must be very careful to be sure
they are comfortable or one will
pay for it in blisters, bone spurs,
and othe;delights.
Ski length, of course, depends
on your size and your ability.
Beginners should get shorter skis
to make turning easier. As far as

poles go, the old under the armpit
rule no longer holds, as shorter
poles are now desired. Most ski
shops are very good in giving
sound, honest advice, but it is still
a good idea to bring a
knowledgeable person along when
purchasing equipment.
Unfortunately, good
equipment costs money. Getting
equipment cheaply requires a
good deal of searching. Generally
the best time to buy is at the end
of the season when distributors
want to unloadtheir old stock.
Once one purchases all the
necessary equipment, the cost
does not end. Most areas now
charge in the neighborhood of
nine dollars during the weekend
for a lift pass. At this price it is
amazing the number still skiing.

One of the best way to beat the
cost is to go up during the week.
Not only are the lifts and lodgings
cheaper (up to half price), but the
lines are usually non-existant.
Instead of getting ten runs for
nine dollars on a busy weekend,
twenty to thirty runs can be taken
for a mere five to six dollars. So
during the week you don't have to
hassle the lines, cost, or those
classes you hate.
Once you get over all the

inconviences and finally make it
to the slopes, it is stupendous.
Our own Tahoe area is one of the
most beautiful places to ski in the
country. With over twenty areas
within an hour's drive of each
other there is plenty of variety.
The following is a critical

at Lake Tahoe:

days with excellent conditions
than any year recently.
Hassles
Despite these prevailing great
conditions many people are
discouraged by all the "hassles"
involved with skiing. Without a
doubt, there are probably more
problems involved with skiing
than any other sport: hassles like
the four hour drive, frustration

obtaining the right equipment,
battles with the weather, broken
bones, and Ist but definitely not
least—the cost (s+s+s=!%*!).
There are, though, ways in which
one can get around these
problems, or at least make them a
bit more bearable.
As far as the four hour drive
goes you can pretty well plan on
it, unless you have a lot of money
to shell out for traffic tickets or
have your own private Lear jet.
Neither possibility is very feasible
so you should look for ways of
making the drive more pleasant.
Switching drivers is a must and
enables everyone to obtain at least
a little sleep on the way up. As a
rule getting up at 4:30 AM
Saturday morning is a drag,
especially if one was in an altered
state Friday night—so any sleep
on the way up is greatly
appreciated. Generally if you
leave campus by 4:30 AM on any
given morning, you will miss most
of the traffic both in the Bay
Area, and on Donner pass.
To obtain the right equipment,
shopping around is a must.
Getting the "right equipment
means buying in a price range you
can afford, and getting gear that
fits your style of skiing and your
body. This means skis the correct
length, poles the right height, and
most importantly boots that are
comfortable in the ski shop and
on the slope. Anyone that has
skiied in boots that do not fit just
right know what pain is.
The agony experienced by a
poor fit is often enough to ruin
your day, not to mention your

feet. Most of the better boots
today are foam fitted, so that
getting the proper fit is not such a
problem. In buyin the less
expensive non-foamed boot one
must be very careful to be sure
they are comfortable or one will
pay for it in blisters, bone spurs,
and othe;delights.
Ski length, of course, depends
on your size and your ability.
Beginners should get shorter skis
to make turning easier. As far as

poles go, the old under the armpit
rule no longer holds, as shorter
poles are now desired. Most ski
shops are very good in giving
sound, honest advice, but it is still
a good idea to bring a
knowledgeable person along when
purchasing equipment.
Unfortunately, good
equipment costs money. Getting
equipment cheaply requires a
good deal of searching. Generally
the best time to buy is at the end
of the season when distributors
want to unloadtheir old stock.
Once one purchases all the
necessary equipment, the cost
does not end. Most areas now
charge in the neighborhood of
nine dollars during the weekend
for a lift pass. At this price it is
amazing the number still skiing.

One of the best way to beat the
cost is to go up during the week.
Not only are the lifts and lodgings
cheaper (up to half price), but the
lines are usually non-existant.
Instead of getting ten runs for
nine dollars on a busy weekend,
twenty to thirty runs can be taken
for a mere five to six dollars. So
during the week you don't have to
hassle the lines, cost, or those
classes you hate.
Once you get over all the

inconviences and finally make it
to the slopes, it is stupendous.
Our own Tahoe area is one of the
most beautiful places to ski in the
country. With over twenty areas
within an hour's drive of each
other there is plenty of variety.
The following is a critical
analysis of some of the key areas
at Lake Tahoe:
Squaw Valley: This site of the
1960 Olympic Games is probably
the best all-around area at Tahoe.
With nineteen chair lifts, a
gondola, and a tram it has about
the best variety to be found
anywhere. It has excellent slopes
for all classes of skiiers. For the
beginners happiness will be found
on runs off the Links, Belmont,
Bunny Platters, and Baily Beach
chairs. For the intermediate,

Riviera, East Broadway, Emigrant,
and Cornice No. 1 chairs offer
comparitively good runs. Kcr the
expert Squaw has perhaps the best
and greatest number of difficult
slopes.
The great classic at Squaw is of
course the overwhelming KT-22.
The name originated after one of
its first skiiers took twenty-two
kicty turns (hence KT-22) to
negotiate it. Although not nearly
as bad as the title suggests, it

definitely does have a number of
challenging runs from the ton.
Any chair 5000 feet long with a
vertical drop of 1850 feet has got
to be good. Squaw also fairs quite
well in the apres-ski department,
with a number of lively night
spots. Squaws' greatest drawback
comes as a result of its
assets—crowds. If you don't mind
the crowds and nine dollar lift
ticket you will surely enjoy
Squaw.
Slide Mountain: A fairly good
area with three chairs and
generally few people. Slide serves
as training grounds for the
Incomparable Leland Stanford
Junior University Ski team
(because of the half price tickets
Slide offers the team). It is only a
few miles from Reno, so you can
practically ski to the casinos after
a day skiing.
Heavenly Valley: Located right
at South Lake Tahoe, Heavenly
Valley boats the largest ski area in
the United States. Like Squaw it
has a tremendous selection of
good runs for all types of skiiers.
Heavenly has runs in both
California and Nevada.
The Nevada side is generally
less crowded and it seems to be
the general consensus that the
runs are more enjoyable. On the

California side is the well known
Gunbarrel, Heavenly's answer to
Squaw's KT-22. The base of the
mountain is only a few minutes
from South Lake Tahoe where the
night life is always popping.
Alpine Meadows: A relatively
new resort, Alpine is known for
its excellent family atmosphere
and good skiing. Originally, with
just three chair lifts, they have
expanded to seven chairs, giving a
variety of slopes and exposures.
Built around the Summit Chair
are two excellent bowls and a
challenging face under the chair
for expert hot dogs.
Alpine is also known among
locals as excellent for kangaroo
and cliff jumping. Local expert
Mike Wood describes one jump as
the "harriest mother I've ever had
the guts to take." Night life per se
is minimal, although the crowd at
the bar between 4-6 while the
parking lot clears is usually young
and provocative.
Incline: A new resort, it is
nestled just on the Nevada side at
North Lake Tahoe. Built with the
beginner to intermediate in mind
the chairs are named by their
colors and offer medium length
runs. It is known for its wide open
slopes overlooking beautiful Lake
Tahoe.
Sugar Bowl: Owned and
operated by Walt Disney, Sugar
Bowl is a great little resort. As a
rule it is not very crowded and a
very friendly atmosphere prevails
(and no, people don't walk
around with Mickey Mouse hats
on). On a good weekend day one
rarely waits longer than five to ten
minutes in line. Sugar Bowl has
some very interesting runs for
beginners and intermediates.
Under the main chair to the
summit is a very interesting and
challenging run with rapidly
changing terrain. Being the closest
area to Stanford, the Bowl stars as
the weekday palace. Along with
being vacant of people, a weekday
ticket only costs $4.50, a bargain
at twice the price! This area has a
lot going for it and I see it
expanding in the near future.

rain going to stop. For anyone
who skis, though, the monsoon
season has produced some of the
best snow conditions in years.
The mountains have been
getting snow nearly as frequently
as we have rain, so when one
considers how much it has rained,
it is no wonder that the
mountains have accumulated a
tremendous snow base. In
addition, low temperatures have
generally prevailed, making the
quality of snow excellent. By
quality snow we are talking about
fresh, light powder snow—the best

there is. There is perhaps no
greater sensation (well, almost!)
than skiing down a slope
blanketed with two to three feet
of light, powder snow. The feeling
is somewhat analogous to floating
on a cloud (which most Stanford
students have most likely
experienced by some means or
another!). Throughout this year
there have probably been more
days with excellent conditions

with a number of lively night
spots. Squaws' greatest drawback
comes as a result of its
assets—crowds. If you don't mind
the crowds and nine dollar lift
ticket you will surely enjoy
Squaw.
Slide Mountain: A fairly good
area with three chairs and
generally few people. Slide serves
as training grounds for the
Incomparable Leland Stanford
Junior University Ski team
(because of the half price tickets
Slide offers the team). It is only a
few miles from Reno, so you can
practically ski to the casinos after
a day skiing.
Heavenly Valley: Located right
at South Lake Tahoe, Heavenly
Valley boats the largest ski area in
the United States. Like Squaw it
has a tremendous selection of
good runs for all types of skiiers.
Heavenly has runs in both
California and Nevada.
The Nevada side is generally
less crowded and it seems to be
the general consensus that the
runs are more enjoyable. On the

California side is the well known
Gunbarrel, Heavenly's answer to
Squaw's KT-22. The base of the
mountain is only a few minutes
from South Lake Tahoe where the
night life is always popping.
Alpine Meadows: A relatively
new resort, Alpine is known for
its excellent family atmosphere
and good skiing. Originally, with
just three chair lifts, they have
expanded to seven chairs, giving a
variety of slopes and exposures.
Built around the Summit Chair
are two excellent bowls and a
challenging face under the chair
for expert hot dogs.
Alpine is also known among
locals as excellent for kangaroo
and cliff jumping. Local expert
Mike Wood describes one jump as
the "harriest mother I've ever had
the guts to take." Night life per se
is minimal, although the crowd at
the bar between 4-6 while the
parking lot clears is usually young
and provocative.
Incline: A new resort, it is
nestled just on the Nevada side at
North Lake Tahoe. Built with the
beginner to intermediate in mind
the chairs are named by their
colors and offer medium length
runs. It is known for its wide open
slopes overlooking beautiful Lake
Tahoe.
Sugar Bowl: Owned and
operated by Walt Disney, Sugar
Bowl is a great little resort. As a
rule it is not very crowded and a
very friendly atmosphere prevails
(and no, people don't walk
around with Mickey Mouse hats
on). On a good weekend day one
rarely waits longer than five to ten
minutes in line. Sugar Bowl has
some very interesting runs for
beginners and intermediates.
Under the main chair to the
summit is a very interesting and
challenging run with rapidly
changing terrain. Being the closest
area to Stanford, the Bowl stars as
the weekday palace. Along with
being vacant of people, a weekday
ticket only costs $4.50, a bargain
at twice the price! This area has a
lot going for it and I see it
expanding in the near future.

Ski Page


For most Bay Area residents,
this winter has been one of the
most miserable on record. Most of
us have been asking ourselves the
question, when is all this *+%!
rain going to stop. For anyone
who skis, though, the monsoon
season has produced some of the
best snow conditions in years.
The mountains have been
getting snow nearly as frequently
as we have rain, so when one
considers how much it has rained,
it is no wonder that the
mountains have accumulated a
tremendous snow base. In
addition, low temperatures have
generally prevailed, making the
quality of snow excellent. By
quality snow we are talking about
fresh, light powder snow—the best

there is. There is perhaps no
greater sensation (well, almost!)
than skiing down a slope
blanketed with two to three feet
of light, powder snow. The feeling
is somewhat analogous to floating
on a cloud (which most Stanford
students have most likely
experienced by some means or
another!). Throughout this year
there have probably been more
days with excellent conditions
than any year recently.
Hassles
Despite these prevailing great
conditions many people are
discouraged by all the "hassles"
involved with skiing. Without a
doubt, there are probably more
problems involved with skiing
than any other sport: hassles like
the four hour drive, frustration

obtaining the right equipment,
battles with the weather, broken
bones, and Ist but definitely not
least—the cost (s+s+s=!%*!).
There are, though, ways in which
one can get around these
problems, or at least make them a
bit more bearable.
As far as the four hour drive
goes you can pretty well plan on
it, unless you have a lot of money
to shell out for traffic tickets or
have your own private Lear jet.
Neither possibility is very feasible
so you should look for ways of
making the drive more pleasant.
Switching drivers is a must and
enables everyone to obtain at least
a little sleep on the way up. As a
rule getting up at 4:30 AM
Saturday morning is a drag,
especially if one was in an altered
state Friday night—so any sleep
on the way up is greatly
appreciated. Generally if you
leave campus by 4:30 AM on any
given morning, you will miss most
of the traffic both in the Bay
Area, and on Donner pass.
To obtain the right equipment,
shopping around is a must.
Getting the "right equipment
means buying in a price range you
can afford, and getting gear that
fits your style of skiing and your
body. This means skis the correct
length, poles the right height, and
most importantly boots that are
comfortable in the ski shop and
on the slope. Anyone that has
skiied in boots that do not fit just
right know what pain is.
The agony experienced by a
poor fit is often enough to ruin
your day, not to mention your

feet. Most of the better boots
today are foam fitted, so that
getting the proper fit is not such a
problem. In buyin the less
expensive non-foamed boot one
must be very careful to be sure
they are comfortable or one will
pay for it in blisters, bone spurs,
and othe;delights.
Ski length, of course, depends
on your size and your ability.
Beginners should get shorter skis
to make turning easier. As far as

poles go, the old under the armpit
rule no longer holds, as shorter
poles are now desired. Most ski
shops are very good in giving
sound, honest advice, but it is still
a good idea to bring a
knowledgeable person along when
purchasing equipment.
Unfortunately, good
equipment costs money. Getting
equipment cheaply requires a
good deal of searching. Generally
the best time to buy is at the end
of the season when distributors
want to unloadtheir old stock.
Once one purchases all the
necessary equipment, the cost
does not end. Most areas now
charge in the neighborhood of
nine dollars during the weekend
for a lift pass. At this price it is
amazing the number still skiing.

One of the best way to beat the
cost is to go up during the week.
Not only are the lifts and lodgings
cheaper (up to half price), but the
lines are usually non-existant.
Instead of getting ten runs for
nine dollars on a busy weekend,
twenty to thirty runs can be taken
for a mere five to six dollars. So
during the week you don't have to
hassle the lines, cost, or those
classes you hate.
Once you get over all the

inconviences and finally make it
to the slopes, it is stupendous.
Our own Tahoe area is one of the
most beautiful places to ski in the
country. With over twenty areas
within an hour's drive of each
other there is plenty of variety.
The following is a critical
analysis of some of the key areas
at Lake Tahoe:
Squaw Valley: This site of the
1960 Olympic Games is probably
the best all-around area at Tahoe.
With nineteen chair lifts, a
gondola, and a tram it has about
the best variety to be found
anywhere. It has excellent slopes
for all classes of skiiers. For the
beginners happiness will be found
on runs off the Links, Belmont,
Bunny Platters, and Baily Beach
chairs. For the intermediate,

Riviera, East Broadway, Emigrant,
and Cornice No. 1 chairs offer
comparitively good runs. Kcr the
expert Squaw has perhaps the best
and greatest number of difficult
slopes.
The great classic at Squaw is of
course the overwhelming KT-22.
The name originated after one of
its first skiiers took twenty-two
kicty turns (hence KT-22) to
negotiate it. Although not nearly
as bad as the title suggests, it

definitely does have a number of
challenging runs from the ton.
Any chair 5000 feet long with a
vertical drop of 1850 feet has got
to be good. Squaw also fairs quite
well in the apres-ski department,
with a number of lively night
spots. Squaws' greatest drawback
comes as a result of its
assets—crowds. If you don't mind
the crowds and nine dollar lift
ticket you will surely enjoy
Squaw.
