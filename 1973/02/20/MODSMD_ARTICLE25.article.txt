# Frustrating Basketball Weekend
## Ducks Make Cards Forget Friday Upset 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
Stanford defeated the 18th-ranked basketball team in
the country Friday night at Maples Pavilion, but after
the Cards blew a 10-point second half lead in Saturday
night's frustrating loss to Oregon, nobody seemed to
care about Friday's Stanford heroics.
The Cards held a 53-43 lead over the Ducks with
10:46 remaining before a phenomenal shooting
exhibition by Oregon's Doug Little ruined Stanford's
weekend. The final score was Oregon 76, Stanford 69,
enough to make even the most ardent Stanford fan
forget the previous night's impressive 81-70 victory over
Oregon State.
Little, Oregon's rugged senior forward, hit seven jump
shots in those final 10 minutes, all from outside 17 feet.
And while Little was casually firing his shots, freshman
Ron Lee destroyed the Cards in a more explosive
manner, driving in for a spectacular layup with 2:51
remaining and stealing Stanford's inbounds pass for
another score two seconds later.
At that point the Ducks led 70-63 and the issue was
decided. Oregon's victory, coupled with their overtime
win over Cal on Friday night, improved the Duck's
league record to 6-3 and their overall mark to 14-7. It
was only the second time in the history of Oregon
basketball that the Ducks had swept their two-game
series against Stanford and Cal in the Bay Area.
Kelley Outstanding
The disappointing finish unfortunately obscured a
brilliant individual effort by Stanford seven-footer Rich
Kelley. Kelley poured in 27 points, connecting on 11 of

14 field goal attempts and five of seven free throw tries.
He also grabbed 15 rebounds as he continued to
dominate the Pacific Eight rebounding statistics for
mortal players. Seemingly superhuman Bill Walton of
UCLA leads the league with over 16 rebounds a game,
but Kelley's 12.8 average is far ahead of the rest of the
conference.
Stanford coach Howie Dallmar agreed that Kelley's
performance was outstanding, but he was obviously
saddened by the final score. "It was a real tough less for
us," he said. "You have to give Oregon credit for forcing
us into mistakes — their quickness and aggressiveness
caused a lot of our turnovers."
Oregon coach Dick Harter had a similar explanation
for the Duck's victory. "We started playing a little more
aggressive defense when we got behind,"he said, "and
that gradually took its toll."
Stanford played man to man defense most of the
game, and Dallmar used that fact to explain the
mysterious absence of 6-11 freshman Tim Patterson
from the game. "Against their quickness we have trouble
defensively with Patterson in the game," Dallmar said.
"Tim can play when we're in a zone, but he has trouble
playing man for man."
Points On The Bench
Still it seemed ridiculous to have Patterson, who has
already proven himself to be one of the Cards' fastest
point-producers (he scored 22 points against UC-Santa
Barbara in only 24 minutes) sitting helplessly on the
bench when Stanford fell behind in the final minutes.
The Cards shot 57.4 percent from the field, but

attempted 14 less shots than the Ducks. Mel Arterberry
was the only Stanford player in double figures besides
Kelley, as he scored 13 points. Little finished with 26
for Oregon and Lee contributed 19.
The night before against Oregon State the mood at
Maples was quite different. In fact the only similarity in
the two nights of basketball was the identical attendance
figure of 3929 fans.
Stanford rolled to a 43-32 halftime lead and Oregon
State never seriously threatened in the second half.
Twice the Cards led by 17 points, and Stanford
eventually coasted home to an 81-70 victory.
Balanced Scoring
Dallmar's post-game comments reflected the Cards'
most balanced scoring effort of the year. "(Scott)
Trobbe did a great job coming off the bench," Dallmar
said. "Mark (Gilberg) did a fine job directing the team,
(Mike) Mann and (Mel) Arterberry played well —so did
Kelley — so we're mentioning a lot of people."
Gilberg led the scoring with 16 points, Trobbe scored
15, Mann and Kelley added 14 apiece, and Arterberry
was the fifth Cardinal in double figures with 10. No
Oregon State player managed over 14 points as Stanford
successfully stifled what had been the most productive
offensive team in the Pac-8.
This weekend the Cards will host Washington and
Washington State in a pair of league contests at Maples.
Stanford, now 3-6 in the conference and 10-10 overall,
will meet the Huskies Friday night before Saturday's
televised game against the Cougars.
