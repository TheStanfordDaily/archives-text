# Runners Set World Record

### PHIL HUBBARD 
The Stanford 880 relay team
blazed around the track Saturday
night and shattered the indoor
world record in that event with a
1:27.4 clocking at the Bennion
Relays in Pocatello, Idaho.
The team, composed of Ken
Curl, John Kessel, Matt Hogsett,
and John Anderson, took
advantage of perfect handoffs and
the fast 220 yard wood track at
Idaho State's Minidome to erase
the former world mark of 1:28.1,
set by Western Michigan in 1968.
The 880 record was the first
world record by a Stanford team
since a 39.7 440 relay mark in
1963. The splits for the 880 team
had Curl leading off at 22.4,
Kessel and Hogsett each timing
21.8, and Anderson anchoring at
21.4.
In other events, the team of
Curl, Kessel, Anderson, and Dave
Bagshaw also won the sprint
medley relay, with Bagshaw
running an outstanding 48.4 440
on the anchor leg.
The distance medley team,
with a leadoff 2:59.7 1320 by
Les McFadden managed third
place, and the mile relay of
Hogsett, Kessel, Bagshaw, and
Anderson took second. Anderson,
who according to Assistant Coach
Marshall Clark, "was looking good
all night," anchored with a 49.1
behind Bagshaw's 48.9.
In individual events, Bagshaw
was second in the 70 yard high
hurdles with an 8.4, Curl was

second in the 60 at 6.2, and
freshman Sandy Sandoval took
fifth in the two mile with a 9:11.2
clocking.
At the end of the meet,
Brigham Young was declared the
winner, and promptly walked off
with the trophy. Not long after
the presentation of the award, a
recount of points was made,
listing Colorado State first,
Stanford second, and Brigham
Young third. Clark recounted the
points and thought Stanford was

the winner. "I don't know what
point system they were using," he
said, "but by any one I'm familiar
with, we should have won by at
least two points." At press time,
the issue was still in doubt.
Whatever the final outcome of
the meet, Coach Payton Jordan
feels the experience at Pocatello
will have a very positive effect on
the squad. "When you start out
the season with a world record,
it's got to do the team a lot of
good."
