# Two Victories Raise JV Cage Record
## 
### MARK WHITE 
Although Stanford played only
one of two scheduled games over
the weekend, the Cards' junior
varsity basketball team walked
away with two victories as
Stanford won Friday evening by
forfeit when the Castle Air Force
Base team failed to appear, and
then demolished UC-Davis 72-58
Saturday night.
Although there was no visiting
team to play against Friday night,
the JV's competed by dividing
into two teams for an intra-squad
contest, which the gold-shirted
squad won 62-56.
UC-Davis might have been
better off if they too had not
shown up for their Saturday
contest against the Cards. Scoring
17 straight points in the first five
minutes of the game, Stanford
established absolute control of the
game before the contest was a
quarter over.

The short, stocky Aggies
moved the ball rather clumsily
against a Cardinal press, but Davis
did manage to get the ball inside
to their forwards. Davis could not
take advantage of this
penetration, however, as
Schweitzer and Mike Kehrli
intimidated the Aggies into
missing their first six shots.
During the initial 17-point
spurt Wohlstadter and Schweitzer
scored six points each as the Cards
broke Davis' press and the Aggie

zone defense with accurate
passing. Not one of the 17 straight
points were scored from more
than 15 feet out.
Rich Stone, Davis' best player,
finally got the visitors on the
board when he hit the first of
three long jumpers from the left
corner at the 13:05 mark.
Stanford retaliated by finding
Enright in close under the basket
from where he scored five points
in two minutes. Moroski
connected on three jumpers

during the same period.
The game was so clearly in
Stanford's hands that coach Bill
Jones replaced all his starters after
seven minutes of the second
stanza.
Davis' Stone held game scoring
honors with 20 points while
Wohlstadter and Moroski led
Stanford's balanced scoring attack
with 12 points each. The victory
was the fourth in a row for the
Cards, improving their season
record to 9-6.
