## 
### MIKE CHASSON 
Stanford's swimming team, nearing the
completion of its dual meet season, crushed an
outmanned California team, 86-37, at Berkeley
Saturday.
The Cards were sparked by Brian Job and Randy
Whitchurch as both were double winners. Job
defeated teammate John Hencken in a close race in
the 100 breast, 59.4 to 59.5 and later returned for
an easy win over two Cal swimmers in the 200
breast in 2.09.9.
Whitchurch captured the 100 back in 54.6, and
later won the 200 back by over six seconds in
1.58.9.
Hencken avenged his defeat to Job by recording
an excellent 4.15.9 clocking in the 400 IM to defeat
teammate Paul Clark's 4.20.5. Hencken completed
his day by swimming a leg on the Cards' winning
400 free relay. The team, which also included
Martin Pedley, Bruce Goodwin, and Bob Wilson
notched a three-second victory in 3.14.8.

Goodwin, who swam two great races in the 50
and 100 last weekend, proved he could swim the
200 free almost as well. He finished second on a
judges' decision in 1.46.6. This is the second fastest
time recorded by any Cardinal swimmer in the 200
this year.
The results of the 100 fly indicated that Senior
Rick Longinotti is returning to form as he won it in
53.7 with Dean Anderson, moving to this event
from the 50 free, third in 54.6.
Terry Sutton came from behind once again to
nip Steve Strong in the 500 free, recording a 4.49.5
to Strong's 4.50.1. Sutton had earlier made his bid
for a spot on the 800 free relay at the Pacific-Eight
championships by placing third in the 200 free in
1.48.4.
The Cards close out the dual meet season next
Saturday afternoon against Ladera Oaks Aquatic
Club with the primary objective being that of
qualifying more swimmers for the Pacific Eight
championships.
