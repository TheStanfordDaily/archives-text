# Safety Violations Found
## 
### CHARLES BENNETT 
University Safety and Health
Manager Jack Sidlow has revealed that
a Labor Department safety inspector
who toured the University last month
found between 300 and 400 separate
violations of the 1971 Occupational
Safety and Health Act.
The Act, administered by the
Department of Labor, provides codes
to ensure safe working conditions for
employees.
Sidlow describes the violations as
"quite extensive," although he notes
that there were in fact only 40 to 45
different violations of the codes. Many
were repeated in different locations.
Only two items were described as
"major." The most serious was an
electrical panel in the basement of
Tresidder that was situated directly
over a pool of water formed by a
leaking water tank. The inspector,
identified only as a Mrs. Roger from
the Labor Department's San Francisco
office, threatened for a while to close
the building, according to Sidlow.
The other important item was the
lack of a fence around the roof of the
Medical Center, causing a hazard to
employees who use the roof area.
Sidlow notes that the University
has not yet received any official notice
of citations or recommended changes,
but that he has sent a memorandum to
all the departments involved, asking
them to make the anticipated
corrections. Sidlow suspects that most
of the minor problems have already
been repaired.
The University safety officer adds
that he didn't mention in his memo
that the recommended changes were in
response to an official inspection,
because he "didn't want to stir up
people."
Most of the apparent violations

were "oversight things" such as
improper guarding of machines or
faulty posting and labeling of fire
extinguishers.
Sidlow says the University will have
to wait before knowing exactly what it
will be cited for, and how much the
corresponding fines may be. He doubts
that any fines will be high. It's "a
slapping-hand kind of thing," he says.

Stanford officials frankly
acknowledge many of the violations,
according to Sidlow. But the
University may ask for a hearing in
some cases, particularly that of the
Medical School roof. The health and
safety chief thinks the cost of fencing
it in would be immense, and adds, "We
don't really think it's that serious of a
situation."
