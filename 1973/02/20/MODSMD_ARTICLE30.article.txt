# Baseball Streak Snapped By USF
## 
### GLENN GARVIN 
University of San Francisco
shortstop Bill Downing ruined an
otherwise perfect weekend for the
Stanford baseball team with a
three-run homer in the ninth
yesterday that gave the Dons a 5-3
victory at USF.
The loss snapped a four-game
C rdinal winning streak (six if you

count two earlier games with the
Philadelphia Phillie rookie squad)
but Stanford will have a chance to
get revenge this afternoon at 2
p.m. when they once again take
on USF at the Sunken Diamond.
The good pitching that figured
heavily in three Stanford wins
over the weekend — against Santa
Clara and Fresno State — deserted

the Cards yesterday.
"We were behind runners and
batters and we walked a lot of
guys," said coach Ray Young. "It
was just one of those
games."Andy Bielanski gave up
the homer and was tagged with
the loss.
The Cards beat defending
WCAC champ Santa Clara 3-2
Friday afternoon when a ground
ball bounced out of Bronco
shortstop Ron Mosley's glove and
Glen Johnson dashed home with
the winning run in the 11th
inning.
Santa Clara opened the scoring
in the first when centerfielder
Russ Johnson singled, took third
on a hit and run play, and came in
on a ground ball by leftfielder
Glenn Holsclow.
Stanford took a 2-1 lead in the
bottom half of the inning when
Mike Nelson started a rally with a
sharp single to centerfield, and
Mark Lucich followed with a
walk. Catcher Ed Orizzi shot a
single up the middle to score
Nelson, and Johnson knocked in
Lucich with a slow grounder that
Bronco pitcher Walt Kaczmerak
couldn't pick up in time.
Stanford then decided to take
a break from hitting — the Cards
collected only four hits between
the first and 11th — and Santa
Clara tied it in the fifth when
Mike Denevi walked and scored
from second when O'Brien threw
the ball away on a grounder by
Anderson.
Nick Peterson came in to pitch
in the seventh and held the Broncs
to three hits the rest of the way to
pick up the victory.
Stanford took both f»ames
from Fresno State Saturday on
the strength of fine pitching. In
the seven-inning opener, Dan
Shaw handcuffed the Bees on

three hits while striking out seven
as the Cards took an easy 3-1
victory.
Stanford got all three runs in
the first. Kim led off
with a long double to right, and
Johnson smacked a single to left.
Mike Nelson walked to load the
bases, and Lucich knocked in a
run with a ground ball that
shortstop Ken Cunningham
knocked down but couldn't field.
Bob Hampton doubled in another
run, and Joe Bleck singled in the
third one moments later.
The Bees got their only run
when Card third baseman Block
let a ground ball hit by Frank
Mascaro get away from him for a
two-base error. Mascaro took
third on a wild pitch and scored
on another error by Block.
Mike Higgins and Bob DiPietro
combined to two-hit the Bees in
the 10-inning capper to the
doubleheader Saturday. DiPietro,
who picked up the win, threw five
innings of hitless relief and at one
point the two had retired 16
batters in a row.
Fresno State took the lead in
the second when Larry Prieto
opened the inning with a double
and scored on two ground outs.
Stanford tied it in the sixth
when Lucich singled, took second
on a grounder, and scored on Joe
LaMoure's single. But every other
Card threat was killed by a pick
off play — pitcher Steve Behlen
caught three men off first base,
including two in one inning.
Stanford finally turned the
pick off around in the 10th.
Hannaford walked and moved to
second on Johnson's sacrifice
bunt. With two out Behlen tried
to pick him off second and threw
the ball into centerfieid. Lucich
ended the game two pitches later
with a solid single to center.
