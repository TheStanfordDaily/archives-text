Suspect In 4 More Murders
SANTA CRUZ — Authorities said yesterday they
wiil seek four additional first-degree murder charges
against Herbert W. Mullin, a onetime college honor
student already charged with six slayings in the past
month.
Santa Cruz County Sheriff Douglas James told a
news conference that the new murder complaints
would be sought against Mullin, 25, in the killings of
four young men whose bodies were found Saturday
at a forest campsite.
Each had been shot in the head with a
small-caliber weapon.
James said he would ask District Attorney Peter
Chang to file the additional complaints as the
"result of a laboratory comparison of bullets and
shell casings found at the scene of the crime."
The four blood-spattered bodies were discovered
Saturday by Jeffery Card, 22, in a crude cabin in a
remote area of Henry Cowell Redwood State Park
less than two miles from Mullin's family home in
nearby Felton, Calif.
One of the victims was Card's brother, Brian
Scott Card, 19, of Van Nuys.
James identified the other three as David Allan
Oliker, 18, of Sherman Oaks; Mark Johnson, about
19, of Pennsylvania; and Robert Michael Spector,
18, of Van Nuys.
Judge Otto Kerner Convicted
CHICAGO — Federal Judge Otto Kerner was
convicted yesterday of accepting a bribe from
racetrack interests while he was governor of Illinois.
He is the first active judge of a U.S. Court of
Appeals to be indicted and convicted of a criminal
charge.
He and his longtime associate, Theodore J.
Isaacs, a lawyer, were convicted of conspiracy,
fraud, bribery and income tax evasion. Kemer also
was convicted of perjury and making false
statements to a federal agent.
Judge Robert L. Taylor of U.S. District Court set
no date for setnencing. Kerner and Isaacs were free
on their own recognizance.
The seven women and five men jurors who heard
the evidence of 71 witnesses in the seven-week trial
began deliberations Saturday afternoon.
They spent 16 hours in the jury room before
their verdict was returned at 12:45 p.m. EST
yesterday.
James R. Thompson, U.S. district attorney who

prosecuted the trial, told newsmen he favored
prison sentences for Kerner, 64, and Isaacs, 62.
Kerner's lawyer said he would ask Judge Taylor
for "a judgment of acquittal" and if that was
denied, he would move for a new trial.
Kerner, author of the 1968 presidential
commission report on civil disorders, faces a
maximum sentence of 83 years in prison and
$93,000 in fines. Isaacs could be sentenced to 73
years in prison and fined $73,000.
18 More POWs To Return
TRAVIS AIR FORCE BASE - Eighteen repatriated
American prisoners of war will leave for the United
States mainland this afternoon, an Air Force
spokesman said yesterday.
Estimated arrival time is 3 p.m. PST at Travis
AFB, the first piece of mainland America the
former prisoners will touch.
The men were processed quickly at Clark AFB so
they could be hurried home to loved ones they
haven't seen for at least five years. Processing was
moving rapidly because the men were in good
health, a Clark spokesman said.
Meany Supports Nixon Economics
MIAMI BEACH — President Nixon courted
AFL-CIO leaders in a 40-minute visit yesterday and
received a strong hint of labor support for his tough
new approach to stem U.S. foreign trade losses.
"Whether we go along depends on the details,"
cautioned 78-year-old AFL-CIO President George
Meany in discussing Nixon's yet-to-be-announced
trade legislation. But Meany said of Nixon's
approach, "I think the whole idea has a whole lot of
merit."
Nixon thanked the labor leaders for supporting
his efforts to achieve "peace with honor" in
Vietnam, commiserated with them over the effect
of rising food prices on workers and explained he
moved quickly to devalue the dollar last week
because there was not time to wait for Congress to
act, according to Meany and other informants in the
closed meeting.
"He presented, from the viewpoint of a trade
unionist, a very practical approach to trade" that
would involve asking Congress for the power to use
a series of options to bargain with other nations,
Meany said.
Meany said he told Nixon that "any nation that
closes the door on us, on our products, we should
turn around and close the door on them" as a

bargaining lever, and that Nixon appeared to be
moving in that direction.
Truce Force Facing Problems
SAIGON — The chairman of the international
peacekeeping body for Vietnam declared yesterday
that the warring parties have failed to make their
cease-fire work in the 23 days since they signed it.
But he said his organization will move ahead
anyway to begin policing it.
Ambassador Michel Gauvin of Canada, chairman
of the International Commission of Control and
Supervision (ICCS), said the cease-fire failure as well
as the delay of the central Joint Military
Commission in becoming fully operative, has
presented the ICCS with serious problems in
meeting its obligations."
"In spite of the unsatisfactory conditions which
exist as a result of the parties' to the Paris
agreement having failed up to now to abide by the
agreement," he continued, "the ICCS .. . has
decided to proceed to the deployment of its teams
at the subregional level, to the points of entry and
to the demilitarized zone."
Kissinger Meets Japanese Leaders
TOKYO — Henry A. Kissinger briefed Japan's
leaders yesterday on his talks in Hanoi and Peking,
dined at a geisha house and prepared to head for
home to report.
Much interest centered on the talks President
Nixon's national security adviser had Saturday in
Peking with Chairman Mao Tse-tung. Nothing was
made public here on the subject but Nixon's
director of communications, Herbert Klein,
indicated an announcement would be made on
Kissinger's return to the United States.
He is due in Washington at 12:30 p.m. PST
today.
Foreign Minister Masayoshi Ohira, who joined
Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka for an hour and 40
minutes of talks with Kissinger, said the U.S. advisor
confided in the Japanese the gist of his talks with
Mao. But Ohira said he had been asked not to make
any disclosure.

made public here on the subject but Nixon's
director of communications, Herbert Klein,
indicated an announcement would be made on
Kissinger's return to the United States.
He is due in Washington at 12:30 p.m. PST
today.
Foreign Minister Masayoshi Ohira, who joined
Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka for an hour and 40

Suspect In 4 More Murders
SANTA CRUZ — Authorities said yesterday they
wiil seek four additional first-degree murder charges
against Herbert W. Mullin, a onetime college honor
student already charged with six slayings in the past
month.
Santa Cruz County Sheriff Douglas James told a
news conference that the new murder complaints
would be sought against Mullin, 25, in the killings of
four young men whose bodies were found Saturday
at a forest campsite.
Each had been shot in the head with a
small-caliber weapon.
James said he would ask District Attorney Peter
Chang to file the additional complaints as the
"result of a laboratory comparison of bullets and
shell casings found at the scene of the crime."
The four blood-spattered bodies were discovered
Saturday by Jeffery Card, 22, in a crude cabin in a
remote area of Henry Cowell Redwood State Park
less than two miles from Mullin's family home in
nearby Felton, Calif.
One of the victims was Card's brother, Brian
Scott Card, 19, of Van Nuys.
James identified the other three as David Allan
Oliker, 18, of Sherman Oaks; Mark Johnson, about
19, of Pennsylvania; and Robert Michael Spector,
18, of Van Nuys.
Judge Otto Kerner Convicted
CHICAGO — Federal Judge Otto Kerner was
convicted yesterday of accepting a bribe from
racetrack interests while he was governor of Illinois.
He is the first active judge of a U.S. Court of
Appeals to be indicted and convicted of a criminal
charge.
He and his longtime associate, Theodore J.
Isaacs, a lawyer, were convicted of conspiracy,
fraud, bribery and income tax evasion. Kemer also
was convicted of perjury and making false
statements to a federal agent.
Judge Robert L. Taylor of U.S. District Court set
no date for setnencing. Kerner and Isaacs were free
on their own recognizance.
The seven women and five men jurors who heard
the evidence of 71 witnesses in the seven-week trial
began deliberations Saturday afternoon.
They spent 16 hours in the jury room before
their verdict was returned at 12:45 p.m. EST
yesterday.
James R. Thompson, U.S. district attorney who

prosecuted the trial, told newsmen he favored
prison sentences for Kerner, 64, and Isaacs, 62.
Kerner's lawyer said he would ask Judge Taylor
for "a judgment of acquittal" and if that was
denied, he would move for a new trial.
Kerner, author of the 1968 presidential
commission report on civil disorders, faces a
maximum sentence of 83 years in prison and
$93,000 in fines. Isaacs could be sentenced to 73
years in prison and fined $73,000.
18 More POWs To Return
TRAVIS AIR FORCE BASE - Eighteen repatriated
American prisoners of war will leave for the United
States mainland this afternoon, an Air Force
spokesman said yesterday.
Estimated arrival time is 3 p.m. PST at Travis
AFB, the first piece of mainland America the

The men were processed quickly at Clark AFB so
they could be hurried home to loved ones they
haven't seen for at least five years. Processing was
moving rapidly because the men were in good
health, a Clark spokesman said.
Meany Supports Nixon Economics
MIAMI BEACH — President Nixon courted
AFL-CIO leaders in a 40-minute visit yesterday and
received a strong hint of labor support for his tough
new approach to stem U.S. foreign trade losses.
"Whether we go along depends on the details,"
cautioned 78-year-old AFL-CIO President George
Meany in discussing Nixon's yet-to-be-announced
trade legislation. But Meany said of Nixon's
approach, "I think the whole idea has a whole lot of
merit."
Nixon thanked the labor leaders for supporting
his efforts to achieve "peace with honor" in
Vietnam, commiserated with them over the effect
of rising food prices on workers and explained he
moved quickly to devalue the dollar last week
because there was not time to wait for Congress to
act, according to Meany and other informants in the
closed meeting.
"He presented, from the viewpoint of a trade
unionist, a very practical approach to trade" that
would involve asking Congress for the power to use
a series of options to bargain with other nations,
Meany said.
Meany said he told Nixon that "any nation that
closes the door on us, on our products, we should
turn around and close the door on them" as a

bargaining lever, and that Nixon appeared to be
moving in that direction.
Truce Force Facing Problems
SAIGON — The chairman of the international
peacekeeping body for Vietnam declared yesterday
that the warring parties have failed to make their
cease-fire work in the 23 days since they signed it.
But he said his organization will move ahead
anyway to begin policing it.
Ambassador Michel Gauvin of Canada, chairman
of the International Commission of Control and
Supervision (ICCS), said the cease-fire failure as well
as the delay of the central Joint Military
Commission in becoming fully operative, has
presented the ICCS with serious problems in
meeting its obligations."
"In spite of the unsatisfactory conditions which
exist as a result of the parties' to the Paris
agreement having failed up to now to abide by the
agreement," he continued, "the ICCS .. . has
decided to proceed to the deployment of its teams
at the subregional level, to the points of entry and
to the demilitarized zone."

Truce Force Facing Problems
SAIGON — The chairman of the international
peacekeeping body for Vietnam declared yesterday
that the warring parties have failed to make their
cease-fire work in the 23 days since they signed it.
But he said his organization will move ahead
anyway to begin policing it.
Ambassador Michel Gauvin of Canada, chairman
of the International Commission of Control and
Supervision (ICCS), said the cease-fire failure as well
as the delay of the central Joint Military
Commission in becoming fully operative, has
presented the ICCS with serious problems in
meeting its obligations."
"In spite of the unsatisfactory conditions which
exist as a result of the parties' to the Paris
agreement having failed up to now to abide by the
agreement," he continued, "the ICCS .. . has
decided to proceed to the deployment of its teams
at the subregional level, to the points of entry and
to the demilitarized zone."

Suspect In 4 More Murders
SANTA CRUZ — Authorities said yesterday they
wiil seek four additional first-degree murder charges
against Herbert W. Mullin, a onetime college honor
student already charged with six slayings in the past
month.
Santa Cruz County Sheriff Douglas James told a
news conference that the new murder complaints
would be sought against Mullin, 25, in the killings of
four young men whose bodies were found Saturday
at a forest campsite.
Each had been shot in the head with a
small-caliber weapon.
James said he would ask District Attorney Peter
Chang to file the additional complaints as the
"result of a laboratory comparison of bullets and
shell casings found at the scene of the crime."
The four blood-spattered bodies were discovered
Saturday by Jeffery Card, 22, in a crude cabin in a
remote area of Henry Cowell Redwood State Park
less than two miles from Mullin's family home in
nearby Felton, Calif.
One of the victims was Card's brother, Brian
Scott Card, 19, of Van Nuys.
James identified the other three as David Allan
Oliker, 18, of Sherman Oaks; Mark Johnson, about
19, of Pennsylvania; and Robert Michael Spector,
18, of Van Nuys.
Judge Otto Kerner Convicted
CHICAGO — Federal Judge Otto Kerner was
convicted yesterday of accepting a bribe from
racetrack interests while he was governor of Illinois.
He is the first active judge of a U.S. Court of
Appeals to be indicted and convicted of a criminal
charge.
He and his longtime associate, Theodore J.
Isaacs, a lawyer, were convicted of conspiracy,
fraud, bribery and income tax evasion. Kemer also
was convicted of perjury and making false
statements to a federal agent.
Judge Robert L. Taylor of U.S. District Court set
no date for setnencing. Kerner and Isaacs were free
on their own recognizance.
The seven women and five men jurors who heard
the evidence of 71 witnesses in the seven-week trial
began deliberations Saturday afternoon.
They spent 16 hours in the jury room before
their verdict was returned at 12:45 p.m. EST
yesterday.
James R. Thompson, U.S. district attorney who

prosecuted the trial, told newsmen he favored
prison sentences for Kerner, 64, and Isaacs, 62.
Kerner's lawyer said he would ask Judge Taylor
for "a judgment of acquittal" and if that was
denied, he would move for a new trial.
Kerner, author of the 1968 presidential
commission report on civil disorders, faces a
maximum sentence of 83 years in prison and
$93,000 in fines. Isaacs could be sentenced to 73
years in prison and fined $73,000.

Meany Supports Nixon Economics
MIAMI BEACH — President Nixon courted
AFL-CIO leaders in a 40-minute visit yesterday and
received a strong hint of labor support for his tough
new approach to stem U.S. foreign trade losses.
"Whether we go along depends on the details,"
cautioned 78-year-old AFL-CIO President George
Meany in discussing Nixon's yet-to-be-announced
trade legislation. But Meany said of Nixon's
approach, "I think the whole idea has a whole lot of
merit."
Nixon thanked the labor leaders for supporting
his efforts to achieve "peace with honor" in
Vietnam, commiserated with them over the effect
of rising food prices on workers and explained he
moved quickly to devalue the dollar last week
because there was not time to wait for Congress to
act, according to Meany and other informants in the
closed meeting.
"He presented, from the viewpoint of a trade
unionist, a very practical approach to trade" that
would involve asking Congress for the power to use
a series of options to bargain with other nations,
Meany said.
Meany said he told Nixon that "any nation that
closes the door on us, on our products, we should
turn around and close the door on them" as a

bargaining lever, and that Nixon appeared to be
moving in that direction.
