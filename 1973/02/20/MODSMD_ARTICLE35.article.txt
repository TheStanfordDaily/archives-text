# Officer Refutes Professor's Wife
## 
### 
An undercover San Francisco
policeman who worked on the San
Francisco State University student
newspaper last year has contradicted
testimony from the wife of a Stanford
professor in the Marin County assault
case of Tommie Lee Walker.
Alexander Jason, 25, a former
reporter for the S.F. State Phoenix
who said he infiltrated the campus
Venceremos Study Group, testified
that Sandra Kahn had met defendant
Walker several times at group
meetings.
Kahn, wife of History Prof. Harold
Kr.hn, reportedly disappeared last
week after Marin County Dep. Dist.
Atty. Jerry Herman indicated he may
file perjury charges against her. She

had testified that she never met Walker
before a Sept. 28 incident in which he
allegedly assaulted a hitchhiker and a
Sausalito policeman.
The Phoenix, which is published
weekly by the journalism department,
confirmed in its Friday edition that
Jason had worked for the paper last
year. Phoenix officials said they were
unaware at the time that he was an
undercover officer.
In an editorial, the paper called
Jason's activities "one of the worst
breaches of academic freedom
imaginable." The editorial said his
undercover work "a totally
inexcusable violation of the
constitutional rights of every person in
the San Francisco State community."
Wrote Several Stories
Jason wrote at least four stories for
the Phoenix during his year as a
staffer. He also worked for a time as a
reporter for "Prism," a student
magazine.
Lt. Paul Lawler of the San
Francisco Police Intelligence Unit said
that more than 50 city policemen

attend classes at State, but that not all
of them are undercover agents.
While attending classes, Jason — a
journalism major — was assigned to
infiltrate left-wing campus group,
Lawler confirmed.
Jason 'A Loner'
Journalism Prof. Bernard Liebes
told newsmen that Jason had been "a
loner." But, he said, "He did good
work ... he showed promise."
State Assemblyman John J. Miller
(D-Berkeley) who sponsored
legislation two years ago that would
have made it illegal to send undercover
law enforcement agents onto college
campuses, told the San Francisco
Examiner he will reintroduce the bill
this year.
Last year, two law students made a
citizen's arrest on Nick Outin, a
photographer hired by the Stanford
Department of Public Safety, when he
identified himself as a staff member of
the San Francisco Chronicle at an
April campus demonstration.
However, no charges were ever
brought against him.

"IN THE WARM: Male and female students sunbathe together on the roof of a frat house at Stanford. Almost all the
Stanford dorms are coed, but the students are leery of media people seeking to analyze their lifestyle. 'There doesn't
seem to be any promiscuity or wild sex parties,' says photographer Jeff Cohen. 'There's just a very healthy freedom, and
they seem to be handling it very well.' " (Playboy, Sept. 1972.)
An undercover San Francisco
policeman who worked on the San
Francisco State University student
newspaper last year has contradicted
testimony from the wife of a Stanford
professor in the Marin County assault
case of Tommie Lee Walker.
Alexander Jason, 25, a former
reporter for the S.F. State Phoenix
who said he infiltrated the campus
Venceremos Study Group, testified
that Sandra Kahn had met defendant
Walker several times at group
meetings.
Kahn, wife of History Prof. Harold
Kr.hn, reportedly disappeared last
week after Marin County Dep. Dist.
Atty. Jerry Herman indicated he may
file perjury charges against her. She

had testified that she never met Walker
before a Sept. 28 incident in which he
allegedly assaulted a hitchhiker and a
Sausalito policeman.
The Phoenix, which is published
weekly by the journalism department,
confirmed in its Friday edition that
Jason had worked for the paper last
year. Phoenix officials said they were
unaware at the time that he was an
undercover officer.
In an editorial, the paper called
Jason's activities "one of the worst
breaches of academic freedom
imaginable." The editorial said his
undercover work "a totally
inexcusable violation of the
constitutional rights of every person in
the San Francisco State community."
Wrote Several Stories
Jason wrote at least four stories for
the Phoenix during his year as a
staffer. He also worked for a time as a
reporter for "Prism," a student
magazine.
Lt. Paul Lawler of the San
Francisco Police Intelligence Unit said
that more than 50 city policemen

attend classes at State, but that not all
of them are undercover agents.
While attending classes, Jason — a
journalism major — was assigned to
infiltrate left-wing campus group,
Lawler confirmed.
Jason 'A Loner'
Journalism Prof. Bernard Liebes
told newsmen that Jason had been "a
loner." But, he said, "He did good
work ... he showed promise."
State Assemblyman John J. Miller
(D-Berkeley) who sponsored
legislation two years ago that would
have made it illegal to send undercover
law enforcement agents onto college
campuses, told the San Francisco
Examiner he will reintroduce the bill
this year.
Last year, two law students made a
citizen's arrest on Nick Outin, a
photographer hired by the Stanford
Department of Public Safety, when he
identified himself as a staff member of
the San Francisco Chronicle at an
April campus demonstration.
However, no charges were ever
brought against him.
