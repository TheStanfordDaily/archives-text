### LARRY FLEECE (First in a Series) 
Hidden among the green farmlands
and grazing pastures of the Stanford
foothills sits a solitary modern
structure, known as the "Stanford
Artificial Intelligence Laboratory."
Inside the building, a staff of
bearded computer scientists labor
amidst a confusion of computer
machinery, television equipment,
piecemeal gadgetry, and electronic
buzzes and beeps.
But the confusion is only
superficial. Each piece of the awesome
jumble of equipment, each peculiar
noise and accompanying flutter of
computer print-out paper represents a
portion of the progress in the field of
Artificial Intelligence (AI).
AI is a broad, new field of research
aimed at the application of computer
technology to enhance the capabilities
and knowledge of the human
individual.
The Stanford AI Laboratory, a part
of the Department of Computer
Science, was started in 1962 by Prof.
John McCarthy from MIT. McCarthy,
who is presently director of the
Laboratory, applied in 1963 for
funding from the Defense
Department's Advanced Research
Projects Agency (ARPA), as well as
the National Science Foundation
(NSF).
Moved In 1966
By 1965, McCarthy convinced the
Defense Department that the AI
research project was worth expanding,
and so in the spring of 1966 AI moved
into its laboratory in the foothills.
Presently, the bulk of funds for the
project comes from ARPA, which
grants $1.2 million annually. Several
smaller grants bolster this sum, with
funds coming from the NSF, the
National Aeronautics and Space
Administration (NASA), the National
Institute of Mental Health, and other
agencies.
Lester Earnest, executive director
of the Laboratory', stresses that despite

federal funding, the Lab is able to
pursue its own interests. "We propose
what we want to do," said Ernest,
"and the Department of Defense or
other contributors decide what they
want to spend."
'Robotics' Research
According to Earnest, the largest
project at the Lab deals with
"hand-eye" research, or "robotics."
Poised menacingly in the Lab is a
complex mechanical "arm," designed
in 1970 by staff member Vic
Scheinman.
The arm has six basic points of
mobility, as does the human arm, and
its "hand" has tactile sensors which
can distinguish the size and weight of

specific objects. Its actions are
monitored by several television
cameras, which feed spatial
information into its computer bank.
Earnest said that although there
have been several other models and
imitations, this arm "seems to be the
best one around." The arm has
successfully been computer-pro
grammed to assemble the pieces of a
Model-T Ford water pump.
Infinite Implications
"Clearly, the applications of this
kind of general purpose automatic
assembly to industry are infinite,"
Earnest said. He explained that the
importance of the computer-pro
grammed mechanism, as opposed to

any industrial machinery, is in its
flexibility: "you can change the things
the automatic system does simply by
changing the computer program."
In response to a question about the
fear that machines are taking over the
world. Earnest said, "Our concern is in
the improvement of the quality of
human life. One need only look back
at what has happened in the past as a
result of mechanization; shorter hours,
longer vacations, less drudgery, more
humane working conditions.
"There is no point in forcing men
to do jobs that machines can do more
easily, just because those men need a
job."
Similar robotics research is being

conducted at the Stanford Research
Institute (SRI) Artificial Intelligence
Center, the younger brother of the AI
Laboratory.
Peter E. Hart, assistant director of
the AI Center at SRI, reported in a
lecture last week that one primary
concern of robotics research is giving
computers common-sense reasoning
abilities.
For example, Hart said, anyone
who enters a room knows that
light-switches are generally placed near
doorways: how is a computerized
robot to know this? The difficulty lies
in the wide variety of types of
common-sense problems, and present
research seeks to group common-sense
problems into identifiable classes, to
be served by single flexible computer
programs.
Mobile Robot
Hart presented the creation of the
AI Center at SRI, a mobile robot
named Shakey. Shakey is
pre-programmed with the abilities of
planning and learning, and travels on
rubber wheels with the aid of his
cyclopean TV-camera eye and
cat-whisker feelers.
Acting on computer-programmed
commands such as "go thru door X"
or "push box to X," Shakey can
navigate his way through an
obstacle-filled room, and interact with
his environment.
Significantly, Shakey is capable of
error recovery; that is, if he fails to
complete his assigned task, Shakey can
communicate by radio-antenna link to
his computer file, and arrange an
alternate approach to the problem.
Hart said that ironically, one of the
greatest limitations on Shakey's
abilities is a human one: the scientists'
programs for Shakey's actions are
often lengthy and complex, and
present research seeks to simplify and
condense the steps in the programs.

MAGNIFICENT CLAW — This mechanical arm is computer programmed by scientists at the Artificial Intelligence Center
in the foothills. The advantage of this type of machine is that it can be reprogrammed to perform different tasks.
