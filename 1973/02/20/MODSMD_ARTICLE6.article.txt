# Effects Of Devaluation Unknown
## 
### ED MATHENY 
The recent devaluation of the dollar
seems to have forestalled a money
crisis, for the United States at least.
But predicting what will happen next
is difficult, and economists are
reluctant to do so.
Prof. Moses Abramovitz, chairman
of the Economics Department, stresses
the difficulty of predicting the effects
of the devaluation: "It's terribly hard
to tell how long it would take for the
devaluation to begin correcting our
underlying balance of payments. And,
if it takes a very long time, there may
be a renewed crisis."
The effect of the devaluation on
other countries, Abramovitz says,
depends on whether their currencies
will be allowed to float. And, because
the speculative movement of dollars is
now so important, other countries are
reluctant to float their currencies.
Prof. Edward Shaw, also of the
Economics Department, agrees on the
difficulty of predictions. Says Shaw:
"Devaluation has been due for several
years, and whether it will come again
nobody knows. It could turn around
and go the other way, so that the next
lime it will be the mark and the yen
that will depreciate in terms of value."
