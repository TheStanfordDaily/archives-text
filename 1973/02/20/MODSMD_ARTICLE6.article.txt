# Effects Of Devaluation Unknown

### ED MATHENY 
The recent devaluation of the dollar
seems to have forestalled a money
crisis, for the United States at least.
But predicting what will happen next
is difficult, and economists are
reluctant to do so.
Prof. Moses Abramovitz, chairman
of the Economics Department, stresses
the difficulty of predicting the effects
of the devaluation: "It's terribly hard
to tell how long it would take for the
devaluation to begin correcting our
underlying balance of payments. And,
if it takes a very long time, there may
be a renewed crisis."
The effect of the devaluation on
other countries, Abramovitz says,
depends on whether their currencies
will be allowed to float. And, because
the speculative movement of dollars is
now so important, other countries are
reluctant to float their currencies.
Prof. Edward Shaw, also of the
Economics Department, agrees on the
difficulty of predictions. Says Shaw:
"Devaluation has been due for several
years, and whether it will come again
nobody knows. It could turn around
and go the other way, so that the next
lime it will be the mark and the yen
that will depreciate in terms of value."
The price of dollars, Shaw
continues, "is like any other price,
except it's too controlled. One expects
the price of meat to go up and down,
and there's no reason why the price of
dollars shouldn't, except that people
insist on controlling the price of
dollars even more than they control
the price of meat."
The devaluation, says Shaw, "is the
result of a variety of things. Americans
have been looking abroad for savings
outlets, and since their incomes have
grown they have been looking abroad
more and more for foreign consumer
goods, like travel abroad.
Our ability to pay for these things
we import with the things we export
has been cut back partly because our
productivity hasn't been rising as fast
as in some other countries," he says.
Shaw adds that another
contributing factor to the devaluation
was domestic prices, which have been
pushed up by monetary inflation. He
said that this inflation was aggravated
by the Treasury and the Federal
Reserve, who last year "spilled out too
many dollars. Money supply grew at a
rate of over 8 percent last year."
Travel Too Expensive
Because of this inflation, he
explains, foreigners find it more
expensive to travel in this country, so

they don't come here to compensate
for American travel abroad.
"Because of our lack of relative
growth of productivity, and our rise of
domestic prices, we haven't been
competing hard enough and selling
Fords abroad to offset our purchases
of Volvos and Volkswagens, and all
that sort of thing," Shaw says.
He adds that some people "have
been finding it increasingly cheap to
buy capital goods — goods they use
here in production — abroad."
No Big Tariff
As far as Nixon's proposed tariff
increase in concerned, Shaw warned
against carrying this type of activity
too far: "If we do as Hoover did back
in 1930 and really come through with
trade restrictions — then there's
trouble.
"I imagine that Nixon is asking for
more administrative authority in
reaching trade agreements, including
increases in tariffs, as sort of a
Christmas-time Hanoi bombing ploy —
a tough guy strategy. But other guys
can get tough, too. Once trade
restrictions start to build up, sadly
enough, everybody knows what's
knocking," says Shaw.
But Shaw hopes that maybe Nixon
will "try to open up trade rather than
close it down."

devaluation to begin correcting our
underlying balance of payments. And,
if it takes a very long time, there may
be a renewed crisis."
The effect of the devaluation on
other countries, Abramovitz says,
depends on whether their currencies
will be allowed to float. And, because
the speculative movement of dollars is
now so important, other countries are
reluctant to float their currencies.
Prof. Edward Shaw, also of the
Economics Department, agrees on the
difficulty of predictions. Says Shaw:
"Devaluation has been due for several
years, and whether it will come again
nobody knows. It could turn around
and go the other way, so that the next
lime it will be the mark and the yen
that will depreciate in terms of value."
The price of dollars, Shaw
continues, "is like any other price,
except it's too controlled. One expects
the price of meat to go up and down,
and there's no reason why the price of
dollars shouldn't, except that people
insist on controlling the price of
dollars even more than they control
the price of meat."
The devaluation, says Shaw, "is the
result of a variety of things. Americans
have been looking abroad for savings
outlets, and since their incomes have
grown they have been looking abroad
more and more for foreign consumer
goods, like travel abroad.
Our ability to pay for these things
we import with the things we export
has been cut back partly because our
productivity hasn't been rising as fast
as in some other countries," he says.
Shaw adds that another
contributing factor to the devaluation
was domestic prices, which have been
pushed up by monetary inflation. He
said that this inflation was aggravated
by the Treasury and the Federal
Reserve, who last year "spilled out too
many dollars. Money supply grew at a
rate of over 8 percent last year."
Travel Too Expensive
Because of this inflation, he
explains, foreigners find it more
expensive to travel in this country, so

they don't come here to compensate
for American travel abroad.
"Because of our lack of relative
growth of productivity, and our rise of
domestic prices, we haven't been
competing hard enough and selling
Fords abroad to offset our purchases
of Volvos and Volkswagens, and all
that sort of thing," Shaw says.
He adds that some people "have
been finding it increasingly cheap to
buy capital goods — goods they use
here in production — abroad."
No Big Tariff
As far as Nixon's proposed tariff
increase in concerned, Shaw warned
against carrying this type of activity
too far: "If we do as Hoover did back
in 1930 and really come through with
trade restrictions — then there's
trouble.
"I imagine that Nixon is asking for
more administrative authority in
reaching trade agreements, including
increases in tariffs, as sort of a
Christmas-time Hanoi bombing ploy —
a tough guy strategy. But other guys
can get tough, too. Once trade
restrictions start to build up, sadly
enough, everybody knows what's
knocking," says Shaw.
But Shaw hopes that maybe Nixon
will "try to open up trade rather than
close it down."
The recent devaluation of the dollar
seems to have forestalled a money
crisis, for the United States at least.
But predicting what will happen next
is difficult, and economists are
reluctant to do so.
Prof. Moses Abramovitz, chairman
of the Economics Department, stresses
the difficulty of predicting the effects
of the devaluation: "It's terribly hard
to tell how long it would take for the
devaluation to begin correcting our
underlying balance of payments. And,
if it takes a very long time, there may
be a renewed crisis."

other countries, Abramovitz says,
