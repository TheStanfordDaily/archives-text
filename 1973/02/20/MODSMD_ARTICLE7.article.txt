# Nixon As Economic Fascist
## Tariffs And Coercion 
### 
Chris Hocker

If Republicans are the party of business, why is
President Nixon, who is rumored to be a
Republican, doing all he can to undermine business
in the long run?
In the long run, we are all dead, as Lord Keynes
was supposed to have said; but Nixon's economic
policies are heading what is left of free enterprise to
an early grave. And don't start cheering yet, because
what will replace it is not socialism—but what is
known as State Capitalism, alias economic fascism
in some quarters.
The latest example of this propensity of Nixon's
is his announcement following the devaluation of
the dollar. The devaluation itself is probably long
overdue, and it per se doesn't bother me too much.
But what does is the intention to impose higher
tariffs on imported goods, for the avowed purpose
of helping American products at home and overseas.
Product Improvement
American products at home, though, need the
kind of help that American protectionism can't give
them. They need to be improved, so that they will
be more attractive to domestic and overseas buyers.
They need to have lower prices or, failing that, they
need to improve in terms of quality and
workmanship.
But the imposition of a tariff works against such
improvement. By raising the retail price of an
imported good, say a Volkswagen, Nixon allows
American substitutes for the Volkswagen, say Pintos
and Vegas, to be more attractive to the domestic
market. But the price that the Consumer pays is not
one bit less—in fact, it is higher if he still wants a
Volkswagen—and the quality of the American
product has had no incentive to improve.
Things may be great for the American corporate
giant as long as his pals in the government are taking
care of him, but the consumer gets it where it hurts.
Everybody Loses
All this takes place in the absence of a retaliatory
tariff on the part of the country whose product is
being hurt. If such a tariff is imposed, as it
inevitably will be, the American industry that is
exporting the goods into the foreign country will
itself be hurt, and have less money to spend on the
American economy, etc. In short, a tariff hurts

everyone, with the exception of the State Capitalist.
Now, faithful readers of this column are
probably wondering why such an avid exponent of
capitalism as I should be defending the poor
downtrodden consumer and attacking the big
businessman. You might even be questioning my
sincerity.
Not at all. Historically, the greatest enemy of
freedom is the State, and the State acquires power
in one of two ways: by force or by co-optation.
Force has certainly played a major role in the
erosion of American freedom over the past two
hundred years, but a similarly important role has
been taken by so-called capitalists who acquired the
exclusive sanction of the State in order to further
their ends. Their actions were essentially no
different than if a government agency had taken
over private property, or if a mugger had held you
up on the street.
False Capitalists
No defender of capitalism who understands that
capitalism only exists when it is free from State
control, whether that control be for good or ill, will
support the actions of those who would use the
monopoly powers of government for economic
benefit. And historical inquiry has shown and will
show that it is these false capitalists who are
responsible for most of what is thought of as
"progressive" economic legislation, but which are in
reality legal methods by which they may maintain
their illegitimate share of the market.
The recent Bell and Howell action, where that
company filed anti-trust action against Kodak for
failing to reveal the details of two important
advances in the field before they were introduced, is
one of countless examples of the co-operation
between the State and some industrialists which
results in a controlled economy.
And the cry for economic protection against
foreign competitors in the form of a new tariff is
merely the latest episode in the familiar struggle
between the forces of freedom and the forces of
coercion.

American products at home, though, need the
kind of help that American protectionism can't give
them. They need to be improved, so that they will
be more attractive to domestic and overseas buyers.
They need to have lower prices or, failing that, they
need to improve in terms of quality and
workmanship.
But the imposition of a tariff works against such
improvement. By raising the retail price of an
imported good, say a Volkswagen, Nixon allows
American substitutes for the Volkswagen, say Pintos
and Vegas, to be more attractive to the domestic
market. But the price that the Consumer pays is not
one bit less—in fact, it is higher if he still wants a
Volkswagen—and the quality of the American
product has had no incentive to improve.
Things may be great for the American corporate
giant as long as his pals in the government are taking
care of him, but the consumer gets it where it hurts.
Everybody Loses
All this takes place in the absence of a retaliatory
tariff on the part of the country whose product is
being hurt. If such a tariff is imposed, as it
inevitably will be, the American industry that is
exporting the goods into the foreign country will
itself be hurt, and have less money to spend on the
American economy, etc. In short, a tariff hurts

everyone, with the exception of the State Capitalist.
Now, faithful readers of this column are
probably wondering why such an avid exponent of
capitalism as I should be defending the poor
downtrodden consumer and attacking the big
businessman. You might even be questioning my
sincerity.
Not at all. Historically, the greatest enemy of
freedom is the State, and the State acquires power
in one of two ways: by force or by co-optation.
Force has certainly played a major role in the
erosion of American freedom over the past two
hundred years, but a similarly important role has
been taken by so-called capitalists who acquired the
exclusive sanction of the State in order to further
their ends. Their actions were essentially no
different than if a government agency had taken
over private property, or if a mugger had held you
up on the street.
False Capitalists
No defender of capitalism who understands that
capitalism only exists when it is free from State
control, whether that control be for good or ill, will
support the actions of those who would use the
monopoly powers of government for economic
benefit. And historical inquiry has shown and will
show that it is these false capitalists who are
responsible for most of what is thought of as
"progressive" economic legislation, but which are in
reality legal methods by which they may maintain
their illegitimate share of the market.
The recent Bell and Howell action, where that
company filed anti-trust action against Kodak for
failing to reveal the details of two important
advances in the field before they were introduced, is
one of countless examples of the co-operation
between the State and some industrialists which
results in a controlled economy.
And the cry for economic protection against
foreign competitors in the form of a new tariff is
merely the latest episode in the familiar struggle
between the forces of freedom and the forces of
coercion.

If Republicans are the party of business, why is
President Nixon, who is rumored to be a
Republican, doing all he can to undermine business
in the long run?
In the long run, we are all dead, as Lord Keynes
was supposed to have said; but Nixon's economic
policies are heading what is left of free enterprise to
an early grave. And don't start cheering yet, because
what will replace it is not socialism—but what is
known as State Capitalism, alias economic fascism
in some quarters.
The latest example of this propensity of Nixon's
is his announcement following the devaluation of
the dollar. The devaluation itself is probably long
overdue, and it per se doesn't bother me too much.
But what does is the intention to impose higher
tariffs on imported goods, for the avowed purpose
of helping American products at home and overseas.
