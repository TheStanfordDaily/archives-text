# Justice And This Generation
## Once There Was A Dream

(Editor's Note: This is the first of
two parts. The second part, which
will appear tomorrow, deals with
the need to maintain the struggle
for equality.)
What happens to a dream
deferred?
Does it dry up, like a raisin in
the sun?
or fester like a sore—and then
run?
Does it stink like rotten meat?
Or crust and sugar over—like a
syrupy sweet?
Maybe it just sags like a heavy
load—
or does it explode?
—Langston Hughes
Once not so long ago there was
a dream. It was a dream of
Americans who had become aware
of deep injustices in a society
once thought to be fair. Many
were deeply pained by these
injustices and were moved to
action, often at serious personal
risk. Their action asked and meant
nothing for themselves, only a
better, more decent life for
others.
Individual consciences touched
each other in the period of
ferment that melted an icy apathy
of the '50s. Individual acts crossed
each other, in Robert Kennedy's
words, "from a million different
centers of energy and daring." As
a dream gave breath to an anger
and a passionate hope in many
thousands of young people, so
was a movement given its breath
by that anger and hope, not only
in the awakening children of the
suburbs, but in the slums of
America, where black people,
especially, had been kept awake
by centures of oppression, and
where outrage was beginning to
replace acceptance.
The dream stirred both white
and black to action in a common
cause with a common hope. The
cause was the civil rights
movement; the hope was that
basic human rights might finally
be guaranteed to all Americans,
no matter what their color.
In that hope, white and black
marched together, sat-in together,
and got themselves arrested
together, led in their defiance by a
black man. Though the most
exquisite instruments of
repression were usually reserved
for the black population, white,
middle-class children were for the
first time exposed to the clubs
and tear gas of the ruling class,
and even the bullets of its
overzealous defenders.
Victories Achieved
Victories of a kind were
achieved in those bright and
hopeful days. Perhaps it would
not have happened without the
assasination of a President, but
public facilities were desegregated,
and discrimination in jobs and
housing and the like was, at least
in theory, outlawed.
But black people having the
right to sit at a public lunch
counter was never enough. Having

the money to buy lunch at that
counter, having the resources to
provide one's family with a
healthy diet, is just as much a
basic human right. Indeed, hunger
and malnutrition are a much more
profound affront to human
dignity than is simple
discrimination.
Poverty and hunger were also
to be attacked and outlawed, but,
alas, Lyndon Johnson's Great
Society never quite got that far.
The dream he said he shared with
us, the Administration that was to
carry us nearer to it, the President
that fancied himself another
Roosevelt—all were consumed and
destroyed by war.
Struggle Interrupted
A generation that had sought
to build a new society where
equality meant more than the
right to vote, but meant as well
decent jobs and housing and
nutrition and health care, had to
interrupt its struggle to realize a
dream in order to struggle to
terminate a nightmare. Children
who were filled with the challenge
of creation now instead had to be
mobilized, in legendary numbers,
to put a stop to destruction.
It took this new struggle to
shake white America, for it
forcibly intruded in the life of
every male between 18 and 25,
and all their parents and brothers
and sisters and lovers. It pushed us
to ask questions and make
choices.
Like the civil rights struggle, it
called forth many acts of
individual heroism that meant
prison sentences, and sometimes
beaten bodies and bloodied heads.
But on a scale unlike anything in
the previous struggle, it called
forth a violent and repressive state
vengeance that came down on
middle class white kids all over
the country, and that pushed
many of them to an anger that
was crazed in its intensity, that
twisted and distorted sensitivites
and made many protestors as ugly
as their repressors.
This nightmare of war and
protest did more than kill, cripple,
embitter and shame us; it deferred
the dream, even seemed to bury
it.
For the better half of a decade
we have used almost every
conceivable kind of tactic to try
to end the nightmare. One tactic
even ousted a war-time President.
But it has been the kind of war
that has outlasted both its
creators and its protestors.
Finally, after many spasms of
marches and rallies and walk-outs
and sit-ins and explosions and
political campaigns and
congressional votes have al! failed
to stop the madness in Indochina,
the bulk of the awakened
generation has now taken the only
course that it claims is left to it—it
has quit.
It has quit on everything, not
only on peace in the world, but
on justice in America as well. It

has retracted its feelers and
withdrawn from both the
nightmare and the dream.
Why Torture Oneself?
And why not? Why beat one's
head against a wall? There are too
many books to read, too many
guitars to play, too many grades
to win, too much money to make,
too much dope to smoke. Life is
beautiful in the palm trees and the
sun and the green rolling hills.
Why should Vietnam and Harlem
and Watts be allowed to ruin it all
for us?
We have come full circle. The
children of the '70s are dancing
back to the '50s. War and poverty
don't have to be real for us
anymore because the draft is over
and we are not poor. The ghettoes
don't have to be worried about
any more because the people who

live in them aren't burning them
down any more. Life is settling
back to normal. Dreams are for
little children.
Or so we would like to think.
The dreams of little children can
be ended or grown out of, but the
dreams of men and women are
not so ephemeral. They are not
buried, only deferred. If they are
deferred too long, they breed
frustration. If the frustration is
not met, it explodes. It is a fact of
history and of life: those who
make peaceful change impossible
make violent revolution
inevitable, as John Kennedy told
us in an appeal long since
forgotten. •
