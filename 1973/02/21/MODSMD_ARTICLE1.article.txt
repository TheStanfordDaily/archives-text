# Businessman Gives $1.4 Million To Endow Law Dean's Position
## 
### JIM WASCHER 
A Seattle businessman has
established an endowment to support
the position of Professor and Dean of
the Law School, it was announced
yesterday.
Believed to be the first chair in
academic history endowed for a dean,
it is made possible by gifts and pledges
totalling nearly $1.4 million from
Richard E. Lang, an alumnus. Normal
endowments here require a $600,000
contribution.
According to Dudley Kenworthy,
University associate general secretary,
the endowment "provides for the

dean's salary and related expenses of
his office." Kenworthy said this would
amount to an annual expenditure of
about $50,000.
Kenworthy pointed out that the
endowment fund is expected to
"produce about $85,000 a year when
it's fully operable." According to
Kenworthy, the remaining $35,000
will be "available annually to be used
at the discretion of the dean to meet
the needs of the Law School which are
not being met elsewhere."
'One Of The Greatest'
In a statement released yesterday,
Lang said: "I personally gained so
much both in living, educational and
personal experiences as well as lasting
friendships from Stanford that I feel it
is one of the greatest institutions in
the country. It is important that the
University continue as such; I hope my
support will help."
University President Richard W.
Lyman commented that "Dick Lang is
a staunch friend and supporter of
Stanford and of the Law School in
particular. Thanks to his generosity we
already have the Lang Law Library
Fund and the Lang Room â€” a
conference/seminar room in the
current Law School building. The
dean's office in the new Law School
will also bear his name.
"Both Law School Dean Thomas
Ehrlich and I are deeply appreciative
of this new and impressive

demonstration of his support," Lyman
added.
Alumnus
Lang is chairman of the board of
Lang and Co., a personal investment
firm in Seattle. He received an A.B. in
history here in 1927 and a J.D. in
1929.
The first occupant of the Lang
chair will be Ehrlich, who was
appointed dean in 1971. He recently
co-authored with the late Prof.
Herbert L. Packer a study of New
Directions in Legal Education,

sponsored by the Carnegie
Commission on Higher Education.
Ehrlich said last night that "it's
going to be some time before" the
endowment begins to produce
$85,000 annually. He added that once
funds of this amount are available,
they will be used to support faculty
research, pilot educational projects
and other programs of importance to
the Law School.
Ehrlich said these were "the kinds
of things Mr. Lang and I are
particularly interested in."
