# A 						Running Dog Gathers...
## A 						Canine Manifesto 
### 
3 Hamilcar Barker

The recent decision by the
University administration to
clamp down on the "campus dog
population" is the latest and most
blatant example of the
Administration's oppression of
Dogs, mirroring the even greater
oppression imposed upon us by
humans in general and Amerikan
society in particular. The entire
history of the Canine-human
relationship is a long story of
subjugation, exploitation, and
fucking-over that makes the
imperialistic domination of Third
World countries look like a pile of
soup bones in comparison.
For millions of years, we of the
genus Canidae have either been
harassed by humans (coyotes,
wolves, jackals), or made to serve
the oppressor's every desire (Canis
Familiaris). We have stepped and

fetched in a disgusting and
degrading manner, in return for
dry Gravy Train and a semi-soft
bed to sleep in when the human
doesn't need us. We have been
forced to hunt, guard, pull sleds
and carts, and play up to his
repulsive offspring. We have
served as guinea pigs for bizarre
medical experiments, and in the
barbaric sections of The Man's
world, as food.
While the modern "pampered"
Canine may feel far removed from
all this, he is still bound by
insidious, invisible chains. The
"master" (the very fact that the
word excites no anger in us
indicates how widely accepted the
slave mentality is!) forces the
Canine to follow his or her whims
of movement through use of the
leash, tries to break the Canine

from his cultural past by bathing
and sometimes even clothing him,
and keeps the poor bastard
separated from others of his own
kind when our natural inclination
is to run in packs.
Stanford has long been
regarded as an "enlightened"
campus in Canine circles, and a
more or less laissez-faire
atmosphere has prevailed. Leash
laws have not been enforced. Dogs
have not been washed or kept
penned up, and Canine and
human have apparently co-existed
peacefully.
Beneath this tranquility,
however, the seeds of tyranny
were growing. First we were
barred from living in dormitory
for "health" reasons, even though
not one Dog ever got sick in a
dormitory; we were kept out of
the bookstore, then Tresidder
Union and the Coffee House, the
home of "free-thinking"
intellectuals; fraternities became
more elitist and less friendly. The
Canine community did not buckle
under, but established a "Puppies'
Park" in White Plaza, reaching to
the Tresidder patio. Here we have
fearlessly continued to follow our
cultural traditions of running in
packs, smelling each other,
stealing food, biting anything that
moves, copulating constantly, and
relieving ourselves where we
damned well please.
But the human oppressor could
not stand the blossoming of the
sweet flower of our heritage, and
has now ended the illusion of
Stanford as a giant kennel by
enforcing the leash laws with
fascist storm-troopers known as
"Animal Regulation Officers."
Already many of our sisters and
brothers have been seized
(including the February
Nineteenth Nineteen) and thrown
into solitary confinement without
a trial or counsel, despite the
guarantees of the humans'
Amerikan Konstitution.
Porcinae Off Campus
The Administration may
expect us to sit on our tails and
accept all this, but the time has
come to bite the hand that feeds

us. Barking Dogs will now not
only bite, but will diligently labor
for the establishment of a
revolutionary puppies' republic
with liberty and justice for all,
Dog and human. Or Dog, at least.
Our non-negotible demands
include:
1. An end to all leash laws and
the presence of pigs on campus.
2. The release of all our
brothers and sisters in pounds,
who were imprisoned not because
of what they did, but because of
who they are.
Burgers And Eugenics
3. Reparations from Tresidder
Union in the form of free food,
not the food generally available,
but food at least up to the quality
of Gaines Burgers.
4. A public debate between
Prof. William Shockley and Gus
the Dog in which the professor
will defend his contention that he
has a higher I.Q. than Lassie.
5. Equal rights as students for
all Cano-Americans.
Off The Quick Brown Fox
We will make no threats.
Sleeping Dogs no longer lie as our
awakening spreads day by day, as
more Canines become of the place-
DOG made for us in this world,,
once we rise up from the humao's
feet.
The pampered poodle who
today eats from your hand may
tomorrow eat the hand itself*
Packs are forming for self-defense,
young puppies are being taught
our long-repressed history, and
bitches are no longer content to
bear litter after litter for the
greedy owner to sell as another
generation of slaves.
The license around our necks
has turned into a millstone. The
Administration had best become
aware of our rising power, or be
prepared to avoid the bushes and
watch where they walk in their
expensive shoes.
DOG whelps those who whelp
themselves! All power to the
Pack! Arf!
(Hamilcar Barker is, in reality,
a junior in Drama by the name of
Glenn Holland. Well, reality may
be too strong a term.)

The recent decision by the
University administration to
clamp down on the "campus dog
population" is the latest and most
blatant example of the
Administration's oppression of
Dogs, mirroring the even greater
oppression imposed upon us by
humans in general and Amerikan
society in particular. The entire
history of the Canine-human
relationship is a long story of
subjugation, exploitation, and
fucking-over that makes the
imperialistic domination of Third
World countries look like a pile of
soup bones in comparison.
For millions of years, we of the
genus Canidae have either been
harassed by humans (coyotes,
wolves, jackals), or made to serve
the oppressor's every desire (Canis
Familiaris). We have stepped and

fetched in a disgusting and
degrading manner, in return for
dry Gravy Train and a semi-soft
bed to sleep in when the human
doesn't need us. We have been
forced to hunt, guard, pull sleds
and carts, and play up to his
repulsive offspring. We have
served as guinea pigs for bizarre
medical experiments, and in the
barbaric sections of The Man's
world, as food.
While the modern "pampered"
Canine may feel far removed from
all this, he is still bound by
insidious, invisible chains. The
"master" (the very fact that the
word excites no anger in us
indicates how widely accepted the
slave mentality is!) forces the
Canine to follow his or her whims
of movement through use of the
leash, tries to break the Canine

from his cultural past by bathing
and sometimes even clothing him,
and keeps the poor bastard
separated from others of his own
kind when our natural inclination
is to run in packs.
Stanford has long been
regarded as an "enlightened"
campus in Canine circles, and a
more or less laissez-faire
atmosphere has prevailed. Leash
laws have not been enforced. Dogs
have not been washed or kept
penned up, and Canine and
human have apparently co-existed
peacefully.
Beneath this tranquility,
however, the seeds of tyranny
were growing. First we were
barred from living in dormitory
for "health" reasons, even though
not one Dog ever got sick in a
dormitory; we were kept out of
the bookstore, then Tresidder
Union and the Coffee House, the
home of "free-thinking"
intellectuals; fraternities became
more elitist and less friendly. The
Canine community did not buckle
under, but established a "Puppies'
Park" in White Plaza, reaching to
the Tresidder patio. Here we have
fearlessly continued to follow our
cultural traditions of running in
packs, smelling each other,
stealing food, biting anything that
moves, copulating constantly, and
relieving ourselves where we
damned well please.
But the human oppressor could
not stand the blossoming of the
sweet flower of our heritage, and
has now ended the illusion of
Stanford as a giant kennel by
enforcing the leash laws with
fascist storm-troopers known as
"Animal Regulation Officers."
Already many of our sisters and
brothers have been seized
(including the February
Nineteenth Nineteen) and thrown
into solitary confinement without
a trial or counsel, despite the
guarantees of the humans'
Amerikan Konstitution.
Porcinae Off Campus
The Administration may
expect us to sit on our tails and
accept all this, but the time has
come to bite the hand that feeds

us. Barking Dogs will now not
only bite, but will diligently labor
for the establishment of a
revolutionary puppies' republic
with liberty and justice for all,
Dog and human. Or Dog, at least.
Our non-negotible demands
include:
1. An end to all leash laws and
the presence of pigs on campus.
2. The release of all our
brothers and sisters in pounds,
who were imprisoned not because
of what they did, but because of
who they are.
Burgers And Eugenics
3. Reparations from Tresidder
Union in the form of free food,
not the food generally available,
but food at least up to the quality
of Gaines Burgers.
4. A public debate between
Prof. William Shockley and Gus
the Dog in which the professor
will defend his contention that he
has a higher I.Q. than Lassie.
5. Equal rights as students for
all Cano-Americans.
Off The Quick Brown Fox
We will make no threats.
Sleeping Dogs no longer lie as our
awakening spreads day by day, as
more Canines become of the place-
DOG made for us in this world,,
once we rise up from the humao's
feet.
The pampered poodle who
today eats from your hand may

The recent decision by the
University administration to
clamp down on the "campus dog
population" is the latest and most
blatant example of the
Administration's oppression of
Dogs, mirroring the even greater
oppression imposed upon us by
humans in general and Amerikan
society in particular. The entire
history of the Canine-human
relationship is a long story of
subjugation, exploitation, and
fucking-over that makes the
imperialistic domination of Third
World countries look like a pile of
soup bones in comparison.
For millions of years, we of the
genus Canidae have either been
harassed by humans (coyotes,
wolves, jackals), or made to serve
the oppressor's every desire (Canis
Familiaris). We have stepped and

fetched in a disgusting and
degrading manner, in return for
dry Gravy Train and a semi-soft
bed to sleep in when the human
doesn't need us. We have been
forced to hunt, guard, pull sleds
and carts, and play up to his
repulsive offspring. We have
served as guinea pigs for bizarre
medical experiments, and in the
barbaric sections of The Man's
world, as food.
While the modern "pampered"
Canine may feel far removed from
all this, he is still bound by
insidious, invisible chains. The
"master" (the very fact that the
word excites no anger in us
indicates how widely accepted the
slave mentality is!) forces the
Canine to follow his or her whims
of movement through use of the
leash, tries to break the Canine

from his cultural past by bathing
and sometimes even clothing him,
and keeps the poor bastard
separated from others of his own
kind when our natural inclination
is to run in packs.
Stanford has long been
regarded as an "enlightened"
campus in Canine circles, and a
more or less laissez-faire
atmosphere has prevailed. Leash
laws have not been enforced. Dogs
have not been washed or kept
penned up, and Canine and
human have apparently co-existed
peacefully.
Beneath this tranquility,
however, the seeds of tyranny
were growing. First we were
barred from living in dormitory
for "health" reasons, even though
not one Dog ever got sick in a
dormitory; we were kept out of
the bookstore, then Tresidder
Union and the Coffee House, the
home of "free-thinking"
intellectuals; fraternities became
more elitist and less friendly. The
Canine community did not buckle
under, but established a "Puppies'
Park" in White Plaza, reaching to
the Tresidder patio. Here we have
fearlessly continued to follow our
cultural traditions of running in
packs, smelling each other,
stealing food, biting anything that
moves, copulating constantly, and
relieving ourselves where we
damned well please.
But the human oppressor could
not stand the blossoming of the
sweet flower of our heritage, and
has now ended the illusion of
Stanford as a giant kennel by
enforcing the leash laws with
fascist storm-troopers known as
"Animal Regulation Officers."
Already many of our sisters and
brothers have been seized
(including the February
Nineteenth Nineteen) and thrown
into solitary confinement without
a trial or counsel, despite the
guarantees of the humans'
Amerikan Konstitution.
Porcinae Off Campus
The Administration may
expect us to sit on our tails and
accept all this, but the time has
come to bite the hand that feeds

us. Barking Dogs will now not
only bite, but will diligently labor
for the establishment of a
revolutionary puppies' republic
with liberty and justice for all,
Dog and human. Or Dog, at least.
Our non-negotible demands
include:
1. An end to all leash laws and
the presence of pigs on campus.
2. The release of all our
brothers and sisters in pounds,
who were imprisoned not because
of what they did, but because of
who they are.
Burgers And Eugenics
3. Reparations from Tresidder
Union in the form of free food,
not the food generally available,
but food at least up to the quality
of Gaines Burgers.
4. A public debate between
Prof. William Shockley and Gus
the Dog in which the professor
will defend his contention that he
has a higher I.Q. than Lassie.
5. Equal rights as students for
all Cano-Americans.
