# What Do I Do?
## Protest Ongoing War 
### 
t Gordon Firestein

I'm looking for answers to a
basic question, and in doing so
I've begun to feel like a dog
chasing its tail.
For as long as I can remember,
I've had the notion that the
society we live in is far from
perfect. I assume that most people
share this notion.
More than that, I have
developed an admittedly naive
desire to devote my energies to
trying to correct the injustices of
our society. To me, the "just
society" involves a set of ideals
that people may or may not
accept, but I think I am correct in
saying that everyone would like to
see a world free of war.
War Continues
Recently, we've been led to
believe that our American society
has been purged of the burden of
war. The hard reality of the
matter is that the war in
Indochina continues, and may
continue indefinitely, with the
support of the American
government. If anyone doubts the
veracity of this statement, the
remarks of Don Luce, a Vietnam
specialist, should be enlightening:
"As long as the United States tries
to maintain two Vietnams, there
will be war there."
The sailing of the U.S.S. Coral
Sea for Indochina on Friday, Feb.
9, is evidence of a policy designed
to perpetuate war. The Coral Sea
will join five carriers already off
Vietnam, and it carries a load of
seventy-five warplanes and six

million pounds of bombs.
Given that I recognize our
society to be unjust (specifically,
in its waging of war), and given
that I endeavor in my small way
to eliminate this injustice, what
do I do?
Defeatism
The answers to this strained
plea are complicated by the
apparent inaccessability of those
responsible for the injustice. This
idea of inaccessibility is viable
when considered in the context of
an ever-increasingly powerful
President free from the restraints
of impending elections. But when
the idea is carried to an extreme,
it becomes the defeatists'
admission of complete political
impotence.
The answers become even more
elusive because few people are
even aware of the injustice in the
first place. Many people take false
refuge in the belief that "the war
is over."
First, the war is not over, and
won't be for a long time. Second,
to believe that we have no
influence in the direction of our
government is to surrender any
chance of achieving that
influence.
Protest
What do I do?
I have decided, though I be
powerless without your help, to
protest as an individual. I protest
by the very expression of these
words. 1 protest by imploring my
congressmen and senators to help.

I protest by joining those already
active, by lending them the trivial
aid of my moral support, by
standing by their side in
demonstration of our protest.
I do this in the knowledge that
I will succeed only if others do
the same. You have done it
before. It is time to do it again,
for otherwise there are no
answers.
