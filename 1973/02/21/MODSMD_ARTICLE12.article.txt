Van Petten's Crimes
Editor:
Recent articles and letters in
the Daily authored by Messrs.
Richard Peers and Eric Hemel
have condemned my colleague,
ASSU Co-President Peter Van
Petten, for a host of shocking
transgressions, the most important
of which include blatantly linking
his own and Special Events
Director Ron Shannon's names to
a concert which owed its
existence to them; daring to take
"special notice of their success" in
arranging the Grateful Dead
appearances; and having the
unspeakable temerity to thank the
students for authorizing a
refundable Special Events fee
assessment which he had
sponsored and campaigned for.
May God forgive my poor,
benighted colleague!
In spite of the gravity of these
charges, which would have left a
lesser man tight-lipped and
scurrying to his lawyer, Mr. Van
Petten demonstrated admirable
courage when he responded to the
opening salvo of the Peers-Hemel
onslaught by pointing out the
reasons why his actions were
justified.
Alas, his attempts to explain
his conduct this irrepressible duo
of fault-finders were to no avail,
for no sooner had his reply been
printed than the dauntless Mr.
Hemel fired back, accusing my
colleague of an even more heinous
crime, that of failing to mention
all four members of the Council
of Presidents in a Special Events
advertising sheet.
I must confess that this
question occurred to me as I read
the publicity sheet in question.
However, my deep concern over
the omission of my own name
disappeared when I recalled that
Peter Van Petten was the only
member of the Council of
Presidents whose area of
responsibility includes Special
Events. Indeed, the only ASSU
Co-President who has expended
any time, energy or effort in this
area is none other than Mr.. Van
Petten! I do hope Mr. Hemel will
forgive those of u§.who have done
nothing in area of
.fctt not demanding
equal credit with those who
brought the Grateful Dead to
Stanford. 1 •'' }5 '
't also Ndpe that this disclosure
Will nbt greatly shock Messrs.
Peers and Hemel, nor that it will
discourage them from continuing
their momentous search for truth
and; justice in ASSU publicity
sheets.
Given the gravity of the
charges they have already leveled,
I Avould suggest that any future
qrimes <jf similar importance they
uncover might best be brought
before the International Court of
Justice, the P6pe, the United
Nations Security Ctoujicil, or at
least a special investigatory
sub-committee"' Of the second
floor-east wing corridor council of
the Menlo Park Nursery School.

Editor:
This is the breeding season,
again, for household pets. Every
un-spayed female cat and dog is a
potential "assembly-line"
producer of offspring, doomed to
death, or worse, before they have
even lived. The decision to put a
halt to promiscuous breeding is
the responsibility of the owner of
the pets.
For too long, spaying has been
a luxury too few people could
afford. However, United
Humanitarians, Inc. offers
reasonably priced neutering and
innoculations. There is no
residency requirement imposed to
qualify for our services. The
hospital is located in San Jose,
and is under the supervision of a
state-licensed veterinarian and a
very competent staff. To date
they have neutered 3,060 cats and
dogs—males as well as females.
For more detailed information,
call 327-2633 any weekday.
