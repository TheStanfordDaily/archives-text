In all of my lecture classes which have permanent chairs I find that
I am terribly cramped and that there isn't enough leg room. This
includes rooms 040, 041, the art auditorium, etc. Why can't the
University put in at least a few rows of seats farther apart, and give a
little more leg room for bigger people ? R.B.
Usually additional seats can't be put into a lecture hall because
there isn't enough room for them. They might block existing
aisleways or make the seating even more crowded than it is now.
Another alternative is to remove the next-to-last row of seats, so
that the last row provides more leg room. Operations manager Bruce
Wiggins said that Plant Service workmen would remove a row of seats
if requested to do so by the department in charge of the room and the
departments that use the room. The department would also have to
provide money (about $200 to remove 14 chairs) to have the chairs
taken out.
Bug will be calling different departments to find out how they feel
about having chairs removed from their lecture halls to provide more
leg room.

Is there a Young Republican organization at Stanford? If so, how
many members are in it? What are their activities? Who's the
president? T.T.
The Stanford Area Young Republicans do exist. According to
secretary-treasurer Ben Brink, there are about 30 dues-paying
members, but outside people help with particular causes.
During elections the Young Republicans work for Republican
candidates, and the rest of the time they usually work on non-campus
political activities. According to Brink, the group was revived just last
year and is in the process of rebuilding, so the members have "nothing
very definite" in the way of plans for this year. The Young
Republicans are considering the idea of running a slate of candidates
for the ASSU Senate next fall, and of setting up a society to bring
conservative speakers to Stanford.
President of the Stanford Area Young Republicans is Sonny Tuel.

Will the Stanford Band and dollies perform at any time in the
future (publicly, that is)? H.D.
The Band and dollies will be performing at the remaining home
basketball games and the games against USC and UCLA in Los
Angeles. Those are the only appearances that are definitely planned.
Most of the other Band performances are planned "about a day in
advance," according to Band manager Doug Peterson. "The main stuff
is spontaneous."
Peterson said that most of the Band's appearances will be in the
spring. He mentioned TGIF (Thank God It's Friday) concerts at
Tresidder, rallies at the beach, and appearances at weekend athletic
events as possibilities during spring quarter.

I have heard that there are lab sessions with Human Sex but that
they're always filled before the first class. Since I plan to take the
course next year, and I want (and need) these practice sessions, can
you tell me how to sign up for them ? J.D. W.
Sorry to disappoint all of you red hots, but there are no lab
sessions for Human Sexuality.
