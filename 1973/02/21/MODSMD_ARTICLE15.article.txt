## Opera Presents Sublime 'Passion' 
### DOUG SMITH 
'The Passion According to Saint
Matthew' by Johann Sebastian
Bach has the loftiest subject and
most sublime music of any
musical drama ever composed,
and the San Francisco Spring
Opera Theater took a great risk in
staging it.
Bach conveys emotion so
intensely in the score that an
attempt to express it further in
dramatic action on stage is very
likely to amount to artistic
overkill at best, or at worst
degenerate into maudlin
melodrama. That the performance
steered successfully between
Scylla and Charybdis is a tribute
to the extraordinary gifts of
director and producer Gerald
Freedman.
Freedman placed the Evangelist,
dressed in 18th century clerical
garb, in a pulpit on the wall at the
left of the stage. The soprano,
alto, tenor and bass soloists, to
whom Bach gives music describing
contemporary reflection on
Christ's Passion, were clad in
today's styles (the bass in a
priest's frock).
They were placed at an altar
downstage right, and at times they
mingled with the ancient
characters. Christ, his disciples,
priests and other Biblical figures
appeared in ancient garb.'
Religious Paintings
A fourth dimension of time
conceived by Freedman was the
recurrent representation of
religious paintings by medieval
and baroque masters, both on
stage and on a scrim (a thin
curtain, transparent when
backlit).
The double chorus was dressed
in gold tunics and turbans,
straight out of a familiar
Rembrandt (which one I can't
recall); the soloists and Christ
formed a pieta scene modelled
after the medieval Avignon Pieta
in the beginning, middle and end
of the work; a number of times at
crucial points in the drama details
from old oils appeared on the
scrim.
By and large the periods
blended very successfully and
served to underline the
timelessness of the music and the
theme. The projections on the
scrim did approach overkill at
times, however.
The performance began while
the audience was still filing into

the Curran Theater. The curtain
rose, revealing a mottled gold
scrim with a medieval icon of
Christ on the cross. Since the
walls of the theater are decorated
in gold, the visual effect was
powerful.
Appropriate Tempi
Fortunately, the musical

performance equalled the
dramatic and visual conception.
Conductor Abraham Kaplan held
the double orchestra, double
chorus, San Francisco Boys
Chorus and all the soloists
together admirably. His tempi
were always appropriate, and his
control of dynamics from
pianissimo to fortissimo was
extremely good.
Above and beyond this, he has
a real affinity for high baroque
style. He knows a sarabande when
he hears one, and his emphasis of
the many dance rhythms in the
orchestra added an element of

lightness and serenity to the heavy
and tragic theme.
The orchestra (which,
incidentally, included two
Stanford students, violist Denise
Chevalier and oboist Bill
Benjamin) played magnificently.
Solos in both woodwind and
string sections were consistently

lovely, so that Bach's exalted
music was free to transport the
audience into a timeless region
above all earthly imperfection.
Good Vocal Soloists
The vocal soloists were
predominantly very good. Douglas
Lawrence as Jesus gave a noble
and convincing performance.
Soprano Carmen Balthrop, tenor
William Harness and bass Philip
Booth sang their roles with
apparent ease and great beauty.
The alto, Carole Walters, has a
rather wide vibrato that
occasionally intruded, and the
Evangelist, Richard Shadley, tends

to bark breathlessly, but these
minor points did not detract
significantly from the generally
high level of vocal performance.
The chorus handled its
multiple function skillfully.
Instant transformation from a
mob shrieking "Let him be
crucified" into a serene 18th

century Protestant congregation
was accomplished simply by using
hymnals for chorales.
Only the organ was used with
cello and bass as the continuo
instrument. It was registered very
unobtrusively. At times it was
almost inaudible, so that a
harpsichord would have been a
welcome participant in recitatives.
Unintended Comic Relief
Occasionally the deeply
moving drama was interrupted by
moments of unintended comic
relief. During the bass aria after
the Evangelist has announced that
Judas hanged himself, Allen

Barker (who dances with the San
Francisco Opera Ballet) as Judas
writhed and slithered around the
stage, alternately entwining and
disentangling himself from a rope
much like a stripper with a boa
constrictor.
At the close of the aria he
flopped full length off the end of
the raked stage, arms extended
holding the rope around his neck,
into the arms of invisible
stagehands.
The pieta scene from the
beginning was again formed at the
end of the Passion. Now the
sculpture above the stage, four
levels of parallel gold tubes with
lights at their ends suggesting
stars, became symbolically a
crown hovering over the cross.
Great Art
Although those for whom the
Passion was a religious experience
found the curtain calls for cast
and conductor inappropriate, this
production was proof that Bach's
great religious art can very
successfully survive in the theater
as great art alone.
The music and the visual and
dramatic elements of this
production were all in all so
sublime that time was suspended,
and I have never been so reluctant
to leave after a three-hour
performance.

found the curtain calls for cast
and conductor inappropriate, this
production was proof that Bach's
great religious art can very
successfully survive in the theater
as great art alone.
The music and the visual and
dramatic elements of this
production were all in all so
sublime that time was suspended,
and I have never been so reluctant
to leave after a three-hour
performance.
'The Passion According to Saint
Matthew' by Johann Sebastian
Bach has the loftiest subject and
most sublime music of any
musical drama ever composed,
and the San Francisco Spring
Opera Theater took a great risk in
staging it.
Bach conveys emotion so
intensely in the score that an
attempt to express it further in
dramatic action on stage is very
likely to amount to artistic
overkill at best, or at worst
degenerate into maudlin
melodrama. That the performance
steered successfully between
Scylla and Charybdis is a tribute
to the extraordinary gifts of
director and producer Gerald
Freedman.
Freedman placed the Evangelist,
dressed in 18th century clerical
garb, in a pulpit on the wall at the
left of the stage. The soprano,
alto, tenor and bass soloists, to
whom Bach gives music describing
contemporary reflection on
Christ's Passion, were clad in
today's styles (the bass in a
priest's frock).
They were placed at an altar
downstage right, and at times they
mingled with the ancient
characters. Christ, his disciples,
priests and other Biblical figures
appeared in ancient garb.'
Religious Paintings
A fourth dimension of time
conceived by Freedman was the
recurrent representation of
religious paintings by medieval
and baroque masters, both on
stage and on a scrim (a thin
curtain, transparent when
backlit).
The double chorus was dressed
in gold tunics and turbans,
straight out of a familiar
Rembrandt (which one I can't
recall); the soloists and Christ
formed a pieta scene modelled
after the medieval Avignon Pieta
in the beginning, middle and end
of the work; a number of times at
crucial points in the drama details
from old oils appeared on the
scrim.
By and large the periods
blended very successfully and
served to underline the
timelessness of the music and the
theme. The projections on the
scrim did approach overkill at
times, however.
The performance began while
the audience was still filing into

the Curran Theater. The curtain
rose, revealing a mottled gold
scrim with a medieval icon of
Christ on the cross. Since the
walls of the theater are decorated
in gold, the visual effect was
powerful.
Appropriate Tempi
Fortunately, the musical

performance equalled the
dramatic and visual conception.
Conductor Abraham Kaplan held
the double orchestra, double
chorus, San Francisco Boys
Chorus and all the soloists
together admirably. His tempi
were always appropriate, and his
control of dynamics from
pianissimo to fortissimo was
extremely good.
Above and beyond this, he has
a real affinity for high baroque
style. He knows a sarabande when
he hears one, and his emphasis of
the many dance rhythms in the
orchestra added an element of

lightness and serenity to the heavy
and tragic theme.
The orchestra (which,
incidentally, included two
Stanford students, violist Denise
Chevalier and oboist Bill
Benjamin) played magnificently.
Solos in both woodwind and
string sections were consistently

lovely, so that Bach's exalted
music was free to transport the
audience into a timeless region
above all earthly imperfection.
Good Vocal Soloists
The vocal soloists were
predominantly very good. Douglas
Lawrence as Jesus gave a noble
and convincing performance.
Soprano Carmen Balthrop, tenor
William Harness and bass Philip
Booth sang their roles with
apparent ease and great beauty.
The alto, Carole Walters, has a
rather wide vibrato that
occasionally intruded, and the
Evangelist, Richard Shadley, tends

to bark breathlessly, but these
minor points did not detract
significantly from the generally
high level of vocal performance.
The chorus handled its
multiple function skillfully.
Instant transformation from a
mob shrieking "Let him be
crucified" into a serene 18th

century Protestant congregation
was accomplished simply by using
hymnals for chorales.
Only the organ was used with
cello and bass as the continuo
instrument. It was registered very
unobtrusively. At times it was
almost inaudible, so that a
harpsichord would have been a
welcome participant in recitatives.
Unintended Comic Relief
Occasionally the deeply
moving drama was interrupted by
moments of unintended comic
relief. During the bass aria after
the Evangelist has announced that
Judas hanged himself, Allen

Barker (who dances with the San
Francisco Opera Ballet) as Judas
writhed and slithered around the
stage, alternately entwining and
disentangling himself from a rope
much like a stripper with a boa
constrictor.
At the close of the aria he
flopped full length off the end of
the raked stage, arms extended
holding the rope around his neck,
into the arms of invisible
stagehands.
The pieta scene from the
beginning was again formed at the
end of the Passion. Now the
sculpture above the stage, four
levels of parallel gold tubes with
lights at their ends suggesting
stars, became symbolically a
crown hovering over the cross.

The pieta scene from the
beginning was again formed at the
end of the Passion. Now the
sculpture above the stage, four
levels of parallel gold tubes with
lights at their ends suggesting
stars, became symbolically a
crown hovering over the cross.
Great Art
Although those for whom the
Passion was a religious experience
found the curtain calls for cast
and conductor inappropriate, this
production was proof that Bach's
great religious art can very
successfully survive in the theater
as great art alone.
The music and the visual and
dramatic elements of this
production were all in all so
sublime that time was suspended,
and I have never been so reluctant
to leave after a three-hour
performance.
'The Passion According to Saint
Matthew' by Johann Sebastian
Bach has the loftiest subject and
most sublime music of any
musical drama ever composed,
and the San Francisco Spring
Opera Theater took a great risk in
staging it.
Bach conveys emotion so
intensely in the score that an
attempt to express it further in
dramatic action on stage is very
likely to amount to artistic
overkill at best, or at worst
degenerate into maudlin
melodrama. That the performance
steered successfully between
Scylla and Charybdis is a tribute
to the extraordinary gifts of
director and producer Gerald
Freedman.
Freedman placed the Evangelist,
dressed in 18th century clerical
garb, in a pulpit on the wall at the
left of the stage. The soprano,
alto, tenor and bass soloists, to
whom Bach gives music describing
contemporary reflection on
Christ's Passion, were clad in
today's styles (the bass in a
priest's frock).
They were placed at an altar
downstage right, and at times they
mingled with the ancient
characters. Christ, his disciples,
priests and other Biblical figures
appeared in ancient garb.'
Religious Paintings
A fourth dimension of time
conceived by Freedman was the
recurrent representation of
religious paintings by medieval
and baroque masters, both on
stage and on a scrim (a thin
curtain, transparent when
backlit).
The double chorus was dressed
in gold tunics and turbans,
straight out of a familiar
Rembrandt (which one I can't
recall); the soloists and Christ
formed a pieta scene modelled
after the medieval Avignon Pieta
in the beginning, middle and end
of the work; a number of times at
crucial points in the drama details
from old oils appeared on the
scrim.
By and large the periods
blended very successfully and
served to underline the
timelessness of the music and the
theme. The projections on the
scrim did approach overkill at
times, however.
The performance began while
the audience was still filing into

the Curran Theater. The curtain
rose, revealing a mottled gold
scrim with a medieval icon of
Christ on the cross. Since the
walls of the theater are decorated
in gold, the visual effect was
powerful.
Appropriate Tempi
Fortunately, the musical

performance equalled the
dramatic and visual conception.
Conductor Abraham Kaplan held
the double orchestra, double
chorus, San Francisco Boys
Chorus and all the soloists
together admirably. His tempi
were always appropriate, and his
control of dynamics from
pianissimo to fortissimo was
extremely good.
Above and beyond this, he has
a real affinity for high baroque
style. He knows a sarabande when
he hears one, and his emphasis of
the many dance rhythms in the
orchestra added an element of

lightness and serenity to the heavy
and tragic theme.
The orchestra (which,
incidentally, included two
Stanford students, violist Denise
Chevalier and oboist Bill
Benjamin) played magnificently.
Solos in both woodwind and
string sections were consistently

lovely, so that Bach's exalted
music was free to transport the
audience into a timeless region
above all earthly imperfection.
Good Vocal Soloists
The vocal soloists were
predominantly very good. Douglas
Lawrence as Jesus gave a noble
and convincing performance.
Soprano Carmen Balthrop, tenor
William Harness and bass Philip
Booth sang their roles with
apparent ease and great beauty.
The alto, Carole Walters, has a
rather wide vibrato that
occasionally intruded, and the
Evangelist, Richard Shadley, tends

to bark breathlessly, but these
minor points did not detract
significantly from the generally
high level of vocal performance.
The chorus handled its
multiple function skillfully.
Instant transformation from a
mob shrieking "Let him be
crucified" into a serene 18th

century Protestant congregation
was accomplished simply by using
hymnals for chorales.
Only the organ was used with
cello and bass as the continuo
instrument. It was registered very
unobtrusively. At times it was
almost inaudible, so that a
harpsichord would have been a
welcome participant in recitatives.
Unintended Comic Relief
Occasionally the deeply
moving drama was interrupted by
moments of unintended comic
relief. During the bass aria after
the Evangelist has announced that
Judas hanged himself, Allen

Barker (who dances with the San
Francisco Opera Ballet) as Judas
writhed and slithered around the
stage, alternately entwining and
disentangling himself from a rope
much like a stripper with a boa
constrictor.
At the close of the aria he
flopped full length off the end of
the raked stage, arms extended
holding the rope around his neck,
into the arms of invisible
stagehands.
The pieta scene from the
beginning was again formed at the
end of the Passion. Now the
sculpture above the stage, four
levels of parallel gold tubes with
lights at their ends suggesting
stars, became symbolically a
crown hovering over the cross.
