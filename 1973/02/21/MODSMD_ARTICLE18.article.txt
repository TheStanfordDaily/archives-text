# Volleyball Team Seeks Recognition
## 
### PETE BHATIA 
One of the most popular
viewing sports in the 1972 Munich
Olympics was volleyball. The
American invented game,
although traditionally dominated
by the oriental nations, has grown
immensely in popularity of late in
the United States.
Southern California is the
volleyball capital of the world
with almost every school of any
size fielding an intercollegiate
team. At Stanford, however,
volleyball remains a club sport
with little money, no adequate
facility, and no coaching.
Last year Stanford fielded an
outstanding team which garnered
second place in the National
Collegiate College Division
Tournament behind Santa Monica
City College and fourth in the
NCAA Western Regionals. Four
players returned from that team
this year, but three of them
defected to a funded and coached
San Jose independent team. This
is an unfortunate reflection on the
Stanford situation.
Stanford player Willie Mannon
commented "Stanford wants to
be diversified in its intercollegiate
sports but the University doesn't
get away from football,
basketball, and baseball. The
Athletic Department is slow in
recognition of a new range of
interest. Not everyone is
interested in the major sports.
No Encouragement
"There has been a tremendous
reluctance at Stanford to establish
new sports and thus there is no
encouragement for the good
players to play," Mannon
continued. "Volleyball is an
inexpensive sport so it would cost
very little to fund."
The program now consists of
open competition under the
auspices of the United States

Volleyball Association (USVBA).
Leagues are formed by area from
which a team can advance to
regional and national competition.
There is a graduate team at
Stanford now, but again all its
games must be played on the road
with no access to Maples.
The varsity volleyball team is
currently in mid-season (the
season runs from winter through
mid-spring) and the team is
preparing for its next matches this
weekend against San Bernadino
Valley College and UC-Riverside
in Los Angeles.
Stanford has competed in four
major USVBA tournaments so far,
and finished third twice in fields
of about 10 teams.
San Bernadino boasts Gene
Selznick, "the grand old man of
volleyball" as a player-coach.
Selznick has returned to school
after many years and is rated one
of the top players in the game.
Stanford has received many
offers to travel to play other
schools such as Cal Poly-San Luis
Obispo. Mannon pointed out it
was due to the teams past
successes and added "UCLA,
UCSB, San Diego State, and the
other top schools make money in
volleyball. San Bernardino
promised us a sellout crowd, and
there really is no reason Stanford
couldn't attract large crowds."
Perhaps the biggest trouble for
the volley bailers is the lack of
practice time available. They can't
hold winter matches due to
intramural basketball and
practices must be scheduled
around Stanford's basketball
team. Volleyball practices are
allowed in Maples Pavilion an
average of once a week.
Mannon proposed employing a
shifting varsity status among the
most minor sports such as
wrestling, rugby, and volleyball.

STATISTICAL LEADERS - Stanford's Rich Kelley and UCLA's Bill
Walton dominate the Pacific Eight basketball statistics released
yesterday. Walton leads in three of the four individual categories
(scoring, rebounding, and field goal percentage) while Kelley is the
only Pac-8 player in the top 10 in all four categories. The talented
seven-footer is second in rebounding and field goal percentage,
seventh in scoring, and ninth in free throw percentage.
