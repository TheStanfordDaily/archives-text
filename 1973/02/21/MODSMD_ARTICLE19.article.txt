# Tolly's Follies
## McKay Tries To Change Tune 
### Don Tollefson 
Guess who's coming to In case you
missed the news, John McKay will be the featured
speaker at the Stanford Senior Athletes Dinner next
month. To me, that's sort of like inviting Anwar
Sadat to speak at a meeting of the Jewish Defense
League.
Most people remember John McKay for taking
his Trojans through an undefeated season which
included a Rose Bowl whipping of Woody Hayes'
Ohio State Buckeyes. But for many Stanford
people, McKay's names evokes memories not of the
season or of USC's victory over Stanford, but of
what McKay said after his team beat the Cards last
October.
After one of the most powerful teams in
collegiate football history had beaten Stanford
30-21, Coach McKay went on a verbal tirade any
small child could have been proud of. McKay
sounded like the five year old kid who starts
screaming and crying because the neighbor's two
year old stepped on his toe.
Many Stanford people remember what he said
vividly. "They're the worst winners I've ever come
up against. I'd like to beat them by 2,000
points .... Why is it when we play these hot-shots
there are no penalties called both ways? . . . They've
shown no class against us." Maybe John-John's
mommy forgot to give him his Maypo that morning.
The above babblings were in the worst immature
tradition of sports crybabies who always come up
with some excuse for losing, never admitting that
they might have been the inferior participant. Such
immaturity is even worse in a winner.
But McKay went beyond his now famous verbal
blasts. When Stanford Athletic Director Joe Ruetz
came into the Trojan locker room to congratulate
him, McKay was cold and cocky and very
begrudging in his acceptance of Ruetz' praise.
Attempted Apologies
But now that he has been invited to speak by the
school he recently called the "Radcliffe of the
West," McKay is trying very hard to explain his
anger of four months ago and is vigorously denying
he made some of those infamous statements.
San Francisco Chronicle golf writer Art Spander
interviewed McKay recently at the Bob Hope Desert
Classic in Palm Springs and John seems to have
changed his tune. He claims his anger was caused by

a crowd of fans which "started moving in around"
the SC bench at the end of the game. McKay claims
that someone in the crowd "said something about
the blacks on our team." He added that "we
practically had to fight our way off the field."
First of all, I have trouble envisioning anyone
trying to stop McKay's gigantic players from leaving
the field. But more seriously, even if some fans did
give McKay a bad verbal treatment, how can he
blame the Stanford team and athletic program for
it? No coach is so naive as to believe that a team can
always control its fans. And John, my ears seem to
remember innumerable choice comments from
Trojan rooters during many past contests.
The stupidity of blaming an athletic team for the
actions of some of its fans should be pretty obvious.
No, John, I think you said those things because it
was hard for you to believe you could have gotten
beaten for two years in a row by a team which
puts academics ahead of athletics.
Bad Winner
Accepting losses is something which comes with
growing up and the only thing more juvenile than a
bad loser is a bad winner. But McKay's lack of class
goes beyond this problem. Another part of maturity
involves standing by what you've said. We all say
things we know we shouldn't have, but mature
people apologize for what they said rather than
denying they ever said it. This part of the
maturation process also seems to have escaped
McKay.
McKay now claims that "some young guy, I
think he was from the Stanford paper, asked me
about the pass on the last play of the game. He said
something like, 'Did you want to beat Stanford
2000 to nothing?' And I was still so mad, I
mumbled, 'Yeah, 2000 to nothing.' "
I'm sorry John, but you're the one who said, "I'd
like to beat them by 2000 points" in response to a
very general question about your last second
strategy. The now famous phrase "2000 points"
came out of your mouth and nobody else's.
There's not much more to say. We know the
truth hurts, John, but real winners stand by what
they say and what they believe in. Trying to pull
back in words you once said doesn't really set a very
good example for your players. Grow up, Coach.

Many Stanford people remember what he said
vividly. "They're the worst winners I've ever come
up against. I'd like to beat them by 2,000
points .... Why is it when we play these hot-shots
there are no penalties called both ways? . . . They've
shown no class against us." Maybe John-John's
mommy forgot to give him his Maypo that morning.
The above babblings were in the worst immature
tradition of sports crybabies who always come up
with some excuse for losing, never admitting that
they might have been the inferior participant. Such
immaturity is even worse in a winner.
But McKay went beyond his now famous verbal
blasts. When Stanford Athletic Director Joe Ruetz
came into the Trojan locker room to congratulate
him, McKay was cold and cocky and very
begrudging in his acceptance of Ruetz' praise.
Attempted Apologies
But now that he has been invited to speak by the
school he recently called the "Radcliffe of the
West," McKay is trying very hard to explain his
anger of four months ago and is vigorously denying
he made some of those infamous statements.
San Francisco Chronicle golf writer Art Spander
interviewed McKay recently at the Bob Hope Desert
Classic in Palm Springs and John seems to have
changed his tune. He claims his anger was caused by

a crowd of fans which "started moving in around"
the SC bench at the end of the game. McKay claims
that someone in the crowd "said something about
the blacks on our team." He added that "we
practically had to fight our way off the field."
First of all, I have trouble envisioning anyone
trying to stop McKay's gigantic players from leaving
the field. But more seriously, even if some fans did
give McKay a bad verbal treatment, how can he
blame the Stanford team and athletic program for
it? No coach is so naive as to believe that a team can
always control its fans. And John, my ears seem to
remember innumerable choice comments from
Trojan rooters during many past contests.
The stupidity of blaming an athletic team for the
actions of some of its fans should be pretty obvious.
No, John, I think you said those things because it
was hard for you to believe you could have gotten
beaten for two years in a row by a team which
puts academics ahead of athletics.
Bad Winner
Accepting losses is something which comes with
growing up and the only thing more juvenile than a
bad loser is a bad winner. But McKay's lack of class
goes beyond this problem. Another part of maturity
involves standing by what you've said. We all say
things we know we shouldn't have, but mature
people apologize for what they said rather than
denying they ever said it. This part of the
maturation process also seems to have escaped
McKay.
McKay now claims that "some young guy, I
think he was from the Stanford paper, asked me
about the pass on the last play of the game. He said
something like, 'Did you want to beat Stanford
2000 to nothing?' And I was still so mad, I
mumbled, 'Yeah, 2000 to nothing.' "
I'm sorry John, but you're the one who said, "I'd
like to beat them by 2000 points" in response to a
very general question about your last second
strategy. The now famous phrase "2000 points"
came out of your mouth and nobody else's.
There's not much more to say. We know the
truth hurts, John, but real winners stand by what
they say and what they believe in. Trying to pull
back in words you once said doesn't really set a very
good example for your players. Grow up, Coach.
Guess who's coming to In case you
missed the news, John McKay will be the featured
speaker at the Stanford Senior Athletes Dinner next
month. To me, that's sort of like inviting Anwar
Sadat to speak at a meeting of the Jewish Defense
League.
Most people remember John McKay for taking
his Trojans through an undefeated season which
included a Rose Bowl whipping of Woody Hayes'
Ohio State Buckeyes. But for many Stanford
people, McKay's names evokes memories not of the
season or of USC's victory over Stanford, but of
what McKay said after his team beat the Cards last
October.
After one of the most powerful teams in
collegiate football history had beaten Stanford
30-21, Coach McKay went on a verbal tirade any
small child could have been proud of. McKay
sounded like the five year old kid who starts
screaming and crying because the neighbor's two
year old stepped on his toe.

vividly. "They're the worst winners I've ever come
