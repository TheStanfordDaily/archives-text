# Computer Helps Autistic Children
## Lab Assists Various Fields 
### LARRY FLEECE (Second in a Series) 
Beyond the important robotics
research being carried on at Stanford
Artificial Intelligence (AI) Laboratory,
a number of projects in progress apply
computer technology to such varied
fields of interest as psychiatry, space
exploration, music, and language
understanding and translation.
The AI Laboratory operates one of
the largest time-sharing computer
systems in the world. Its highly diverse
staff employs the system to pursue a
number of research projects,
supported by funds from federal
agencies and private corporations.
Recently, the Laboratory has
developed significant applications of
its computer technology to psychiatric
care. Working under a grant from the
National Institute of Mental Health,
Dr. Ken Colby of the AI staff has
found that placing an autistic child in

front of a computer terminal can be
effective in getting the child to
communicate.
"Autistic children withdraw from
the real world, and turn off to
people," explained Lester Earnest,
executive director of the AI
Laboratory. "Perhaps they think of
themselves as machines — and so, they
can respond to machines."
Encouragement
The computer keyboard is set up so
that any key the child punches will
bring animated pictures to the
computer screen, accompanied by a
sound track. The child is simply
encouraged to play with the fancy toy,
and can eventually work up to
interactive word games with the
computer. And, in many cases, the
child breaks out of his shell and
becomes willing to respond to the real
world around him.
Computer work has also brought to

scientists a clearer understanding of
the nature of mental disturbances. A
verbal computer program simulating
psychological paranoia has been
developed which is indistinguishable
from the responses of an actual human
paranoid patient: even a trained
psychiatrist cannot choose the "real"
paranoia.
By constructing such computer
models of mental disturbance,
scientists hope to be better able to
identify and deal with the illnesses.
Another major project at the
Laboratory has been the processing
and analysis of the photographs of
Mars taken by the last Mariner
satellite. The NASA-funded computer
analysis, only recently completed,
reveals a series of transformations in
the photographic images, indicating
atmospheric changes on the surface of
Mars.
