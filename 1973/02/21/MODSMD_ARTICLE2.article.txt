# Computer Helps Autistic Children
## Lab Assists Various Fields 
### LARRY FLEECE (Second in a Series) 
Beyond the important robotics
research being carried on at Stanford
Artificial Intelligence (AI) Laboratory,
a number of projects in progress apply
computer technology to such varied
fields of interest as psychiatry, space
exploration, music, and language
understanding and translation.
The AI Laboratory operates one of
the largest time-sharing computer
systems in the world. Its highly diverse
staff employs the system to pursue a
number of research projects,
supported by funds from federal
agencies and private corporations.
Recently, the Laboratory has
developed significant applications of
its computer technology to psychiatric
care. Working under a grant from the
National Institute of Mental Health,
Dr. Ken Colby of the AI staff has
found that placing an autistic child in

front of a computer terminal can be
effective in getting the child to
communicate.
"Autistic children withdraw from
the real world, and turn off to
people," explained Lester Earnest,
executive director of the AI
Laboratory. "Perhaps they think of
themselves as machines — and so, they
can respond to machines."
Encouragement
The computer keyboard is set up so
that any key the child punches will
bring animated pictures to the
computer screen, accompanied by a
sound track. The child is simply
encouraged to play with the fancy toy,
and can eventually work up to
interactive word games with the
computer. And, in many cases, the
child breaks out of his shell and
becomes willing to respond to the real
world around him.
Computer work has also brought to

scientists a clearer understanding of
the nature of mental disturbances. A
verbal computer program simulating
psychological paranoia has been
developed which is indistinguishable
from the responses of an actual human
paranoid patient: even a trained
psychiatrist cannot choose the "real"
paranoia.
By constructing such computer
models of mental disturbance,
scientists hope to be better able to
identify and deal with the illnesses.
Another major project at the
Laboratory has been the processing
and analysis of the photographs of
Mars taken by the last Mariner
satellite. The NASA-funded computer
analysis, only recently completed,
reveals a series of transformations in
the photographic images, indicating
atmospheric changes on the surface of
Mars.
In connection with future space
exploration, a few years ago the
Laboratory developed a
computer-programmed mobile vehicle,
equipped with TV-camera vision and
four-wheel electric drive.
The vehicle, which operates on a
series of computer commands, would
be ideal for planetary exploration,
particularly on Mars, where presently
the feasibility of sending a human
being seems slim.
But with the recent federal cutback
in space spending and temporary halt
on space exploration, interest at the
Lab in the usefulness of the vehicle has
declined. "No one has played with it
for awhile," confessed Executive
Director Earnest.
Language Study
A long and often frustrating area of
interest for AI researchers has been in
language learning and translation. For
over a decade computer experts have
attempted to program their machines
to understand the difficult grammar
rules, syntax, and elements of the
human language.
But due to the complex structure
of language, and peculiar grammar
rules which often defy logic, their
success was minimal. Five years ago
most scientists were willing to give up
the project.
Only two years ago, however, the
project was readopted at the
Laboratory, with emphasis now placed
on the semantic, rather than syntactic,

properties of language. Although the
work is still in progress, the results
have been promising. Presently on file
in the Laboratory computer system
are several language translation
programs (e.g. English-French) which,
though they need "debugging," will
ultimately be able to provide
automatic translation.
Computer Music
Another major project at the
Laboratory has been the development
of the potential of computer
programmed music. Headed by Profs.
John Chowning and Leland Smith of
the Music Department, the project
uses quadrophonic sound equipment
and enlists the services of the
computer as assistant composer and
musician in its music.
Earnest explained that by
programming the computer with
numbers corresponding to the
frequencies of various sound waves,
the computer can simulate any
instrument, invent sounds of its own,
and potentially "create any sound
hearable by the human ear."
Beyond that, Earnest said,
computer-emitted sound can control
the acoustic effects of a room, as well
as the spatial position and direction of
the sound. "The qther day I visited the
music project* fend got 'run over' by
of a Mac truck," Earnest
said.

future.)

staff employs the system to pursue a
number of research projects,
supported by funds from federal
agencies and private corporations.
Recently, the Laboratory has
developed significant applications of
its computer technology to psychiatric
care. Working under a grant from the
National Institute of Mental Health,
Dr. Ken Colby of the AI staff has
found that placing an autistic child in

front of a computer terminal can be
effective in getting the child to
communicate.
"Autistic children withdraw from
the real world, and turn off to
people," explained Lester Earnest,
executive director of the AI
Laboratory. "Perhaps they think of
themselves as machines — and so, they
can respond to machines."
Encouragement
The computer keyboard is set up so
that any key the child punches will
bring animated pictures to the
computer screen, accompanied by a
sound track. The child is simply
encouraged to play with the fancy toy,
and can eventually work up to
interactive word games with the
computer. And, in many cases, the
child breaks out of his shell and
becomes willing to respond to the real
world around him.
Computer work has also brought to

scientists a clearer understanding of
the nature of mental disturbances. A
verbal computer program simulating
psychological paranoia has been
developed which is indistinguishable
from the responses of an actual human
paranoid patient: even a trained
psychiatrist cannot choose the "real"
paranoia.
By constructing such computer
models of mental disturbance,
scientists hope to be better able to
identify and deal with the illnesses.
Another major project at the
Laboratory has been the processing
and analysis of the photographs of
Mars taken by the last Mariner
satellite. The NASA-funded computer
analysis, only recently completed,
reveals a series of transformations in
the photographic images, indicating
atmospheric changes on the surface of
Mars.
In connection with future space
exploration, a few years ago the
Laboratory developed a
computer-programmed mobile vehicle,
equipped with TV-camera vision and
four-wheel electric drive.
The vehicle, which operates on a
series of computer commands, would
be ideal for planetary exploration,
particularly on Mars, where presently
the feasibility of sending a human
being seems slim.
But with the recent federal cutback
in space spending and temporary halt
on space exploration, interest at the
Lab in the usefulness of the vehicle has
declined. "No one has played with it
for awhile," confessed Executive
Director Earnest.
Language Study
A long and often frustrating area of
interest for AI researchers has been in
language learning and translation. For
over a decade computer experts have
attempted to program their machines
to understand the difficult grammar
rules, syntax, and elements of the
human language.
But due to the complex structure
of language, and peculiar grammar
rules which often defy logic, their
success was minimal. Five years ago
most scientists were willing to give up
the project.
Only two years ago, however, the
project was readopted at the
Laboratory, with emphasis now placed
on the semantic, rather than syntactic,

properties of language. Although the
work is still in progress, the results
have been promising. Presently on file
in the Laboratory computer system
are several language translation
programs (e.g. English-French) which,
though they need "debugging," will
ultimately be able to provide
automatic translation.
Computer Music
Another major project at the
Laboratory has been the development
of the potential of computer
programmed music. Headed by Profs.
John Chowning and Leland Smith of
the Music Department, the project
uses quadrophonic sound equipment
and enlists the services of the
computer as assistant composer and
musician in its music.
Earnest explained that by
programming the computer with
numbers corresponding to the
frequencies of various sound waves,
the computer can simulate any
instrument, invent sounds of its own,
and potentially "create any sound
hearable by the human ear."
Beyond that, Earnest said,
computer-emitted sound can control
the acoustic effects of a room, as well
as the spatial position and direction of
the sound. "The qther day I visited the
music project* fend got 'run over' by
of a Mac truck," Earnest
said.
(Tomorrow: A proposal for the
future.)
