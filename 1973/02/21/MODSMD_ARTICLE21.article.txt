# Nor. Cal. Tennis Opens
## 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
Stanford's tennis team is
favored to win the Northern
California Intercollegiate
tournament, which begins today
at Berkeley.
The tournament includes
representatives from most of the
major colleges in Northern
California. The host Cal team and
San Jose State are among the
schools Coach Dick Gould feels
will offer his Cardinals the best
competition.
The "NorCals" are run as an
individual team tournament. Each
of the six singles players and three
doubles teams each team is
allowed to enter will play
individual matches until defeated.
A player who wins scores one
point for his team.
Thus, a situation could arise
where the later rounds of the
tournament, which runs until
Saturday, could feature players
from one school playing against
each other.
"We can use the matches in
this tournament to help decide
our order â€” if someone is playing
well he can move up," Gould said.
Alex "Sandy" Mayer, Jim
Delaney, and Pat DuPre, who have
played first, second, and fifth

singles for the team thus far in the
year, are all currently playing at
the National Indoor Tournament
in Salisbury, Maryland. Thus,
Stanford's lineup is somewhat
different than the one with which
they won the NCAA Indoor
Championships in Madison, Wis.
earlier this month.
Gould has seeded Rick Eisher
first among Stanford players. He
is followed by Gery Groslimond,
John Whitlinger, Chip Fisher, Paul
Sidone, and Mark Mitchell.
First doubles team Rick Fisher
and Groslimond is the odds-on
favorite to win at Berkeley. Also
competing for the Cards will be
Chip Fisher and Whitlinger,

seeded second, and freshmen Jake
Ward and Craig Johnson.
Mayer, second-seeded behind
Jimmy Connors at the National
Indoor Championships, defeated
Milan Holocek of Czechoslovakia,
3-6, 6-1, 6-4 in first round play
Monday in Maryland
In a dual meet here Monday,
Stanford easily defeated Cal Poly,
San Luis Obispo, 7-2 for the
Cards' fourth victory in as many
matches. Whitlinger, both Fishers,
Sidone, Mitchell, Warde, and
Johnson led the way with singles
victories. Cal Poly picked up its
two points in the second and third
doubles matches.
