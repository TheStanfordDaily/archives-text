Thousands Protest OEO Opening
WASHINGTON - Thousands rallied at the Capitol
yesterday after a day of protests against cuts in
antipoverty funds and the closing of the Office of
Economic Opportunity.
Many had spent the day lobbying in
congressional offices against the cutbacks.
Rep. Bella Abzug (D-N.Y.), told the crowd at the
rally on the Capitol grounds to mobilize "against
the horror budget" submitted to Congress by
President Nixon.
"Your presence here today is a statement that
this country belongs to all the people, not just
millionaires who get subsidies even for their
mistakes," she said.
Among the protesters was a group of mayors
seeking to prevent a big reduction in federal grants
to the cities. Mayor Moon Landrieu of New Orleans,
representing the U.S. Conference of Mayors, said
reductions should be made in federal spending.
"But the battle shouldn't be fought on the sweat,
on the backs of the poor who live in the cities," he
said.
While the protesters gathered, two administration
officials appeared before the Senate Appropriations
Committee to defend budget cuts. Treasury
Secretary George P. Shultz and Roy L. Ash, head of
the Office of Management and Budget, said
Congress voted so much money last year that Nixon
was left with no alternative but to make cuts.
The crowd at the rally on the Capitol grounds
was peaceful and attentive.
Capt. L.H. Ballard of the Capitol police
estimated it at eight to ten thousand long before the
steps and walks became jammed with people.
Laos Cease-Fire Signed
VIENTIENE, Laos — The royal Laotian government
and the Communist Pathet Lao signed a cease-fire
agreement today to the popping of champagne
corks and shouts of "bravo" from assembled
diplomats.
The agreement to call a halt to more than a
decade of fighting in the land-locked Indochinese
kingdom was signed at the green-and-white villa of
Prince Souvanna Phouma, the 72-year-old premier
of the Vientiane government. It also means the end
of U.S. bombing in Laos, which has continued since
the Vietnam cease-fire.
No text of the agreement, which was written in
Lao, was made available after the short signing
ceremony. But Pheng told newsmen it contains four
provisions:
— A cease-fire to come into effect throughout
Laos at midday tomorrow, or 9 p.m. tonight PST.
— The formation of the provisional government
of national union representing the opposing factions
in equal part within 30 days.
— The formation of a mixed political council to
organize elections.
— The exchange of all prisoners and withdrawal
of all foreign troops within 90 days.
Among the prisoners are seven U.S. servicemen
and two American civilians, according to
information supplied by the Nofth Vietnamese.
Some 300 pilots shot down 'over Laos are listed
as missing.
Nixon Predicts Viet Pact Success
COLUMBIA, S.C. — President Nixon predicted

yesterday history will prove that America was right
when "we stuck it out" in Vietnam and said the
settlement there brightens prospects for lasting
world peace.
Addressing the South Carolina General
Assembly, the first state legislature to adopt a
resolution hailing the Vietnam peace accord, Nixon
said the United States ended its role in the war with
honor and with the respect of allies and adversaries
alike.
"Because of what we did in Vietnam it is my
firm conviction that the United States can now
exercise more effective leadership in the cause of
world peace," the President said.
It was the chief executive's first full-fledged
public address in the nearly four weeks since the
Vietnam accord was signed, and White House aides
arranged for him to give it in a state that Gov. John
West called "the heart of American patriotism."
Court Rebuffs Nader, Sirhan
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court yesterday
turned back a move by consumer crusader Ralph
Nader to reopen a government antitrust suit against
International Telephone and Telegraph Co.
In an 8-1 ruling the justices agreed with a federal
district court in Connecticut that the government
did not have to reveal why it had decided to reach a
settlement with ITT.
Nader's appeal represented an effort to give the
public a greater opportunity to participate in
antitrust actions against large business. Only Justice
William 0. Douglas voted to grant him a hearing.
The 1971 agreement permitted ITT to keep the
Hartford Insurance Co. but called for divestiture of
three other firms with annual sales of more than $1
billion.
Nader and an associate Reuben B. Robertson 111,
said the government's reason, which they said was
to spare ITT and its stockholders great financial
hardship, surfaced only because the suit became an
issue during Senate hearings on the nomination of
Atty. Gen. Richard G. Kleindienst.
The Supreme Court in another action declined to
review the conviction of Sirhan Bishara Sirhan for
the murder of Sen. Robert F. Kennedy in Los
Angeles in 1968.
Sirhan's lawyers claimed in an appeal that police
had searched his mother's home unconstitutionally
after the shooting and there was new evidence that
he did not fire the fatal bullet.
Jet Noise Case Appealed
WASHINGTON — Cities and states must limit jet
flights in and out of local airports if that is
necessary to protect residents from undue noise, the
Supreme Court was told yesterday.
"Noise pollution invades the right of
privacy . .. interfering with family life and sleep,"
Assistant City Atty. Richard L. Sieg of Burbank,
Calif., told the court.
Arguing that a 1970 Burbank ordinance banning
jets from the Hollywood-Burbank Airport between
11 p.m. and 7 a.m. is not pre-empted by federal
regulation of air travel, Sieg said:
"A declaration of pre-emption is impermissible
when it leaves unprotected fundamental rights."
Ervin Doubts News Bill Passage
WASHINGTON - Sen. Sam J. Ervin Jr., chairman

of the Senate subcommittee investigating freedom
of the press, predicted yesterday that Congress
would refuse to give newsmen unqualified immunity
from prosecution.
"I don't believe Congress will pass an unqualified
privilege bill," Ervin said after hearing widely
divergent views on whether legislation should be
passed to protect newsmen against disclosure of
confidential sources. '
The North Carolina Democrat emphasized at the
outset of his Constitutional Rights subcomn tee
that "to write legislation balancing the two great
public interests of a free press and the seeking of
justice is no easy task."
Ervin, considered by many to be the Senate's
leading authority on constitutional law, also took a
strong stand against any federal legislation applying
to proceedings in state and local courts.
"Many senators who are favorable to protective
legislation, like myself, might well oppose legislation
which tried to cover the states," he said.
Ervin disclosed that he was introducing a bill,
with Sens. Henry M. Jackson (D-Wash.), and James
Pearson (R-Kan.), as cosponsors, that would give
newsmen protection against disclosing confidential
information in federal court or grand jury
proceedings unless it affirmatively appeared they
had knowledge tending to prove or disprove the
commission of a crime.
Ervin's qualified privilege bill also provides that a
newsman may not be forced to disclose his notes,
tapes or other documentary evidence unless they
tended to corroborate or contradict the newsman's
testimony in court or before a grand jury.
