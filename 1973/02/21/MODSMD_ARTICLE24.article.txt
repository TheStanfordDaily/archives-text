# Kahn Perjury Charge Decision Forthcoming
## 
### 
A Marin County prosecutor said yesterday that a
decision may soon be reached on whether to seek
perjury charges against Sandra Kahn, wife of
History Prof. Harold Kahn.
Dep. Dist. Atty. Jerry Herman said the case "is
under investigation" by his office now, but would
not specify any details of the investigation "for fear
of prejudicing our case."
Kahn, 34, had testified in the case of Tommie
Lee Walker, accused of assaulting a police officer
and a hitchhiker in Sausalito last Sept. 28. She had
stated that she had never met Walker before that
date.
However, Herman produced four letters he said
Kahn had written to a Folsom Prison inmate prior
to the incident which made mention of Walker.
A prosecution witness at the trial, San Francisco
policeman Alexander Jason, said he had infiltrated a
San Francisco State University Venceremos study
group of which he said Kahn was a member. It was
disclosed last week that while at State, Jason
worked for the Phoenix, the weekly student
newspaper.
Walker was convicted late last week, Herman
said. Sentencing is slated for March 8.
