# Bach Mai Initiative Court Test Possible
## 
### 
Peace groups have filed additional
signatures for the controversial Bach
Mai Hospital initiative petitions in Palo
Alto, and a pre-election court test of
the measure looms likely.
The petitioners seek to place on the
May 8 municipal ballot the question of
donating $50,000 in city funds to help
rebuild the bombed Bach Mai Hospital
in Hanoi.
Mary Luce of Venceremos handed
City Clerk Ann Tanner petitions
containing "about 400" signatures
yesterday afternoon. An effort earlier
this month collected 1543 valid
names, 103 short of the required
number.
County elections officials expect to
finish checking the new petitions for
validity this morning. It is very likely
that the necessary 103 valid names will
be found.
Assuming the petitions contain

sufficient signatures, the city council
will decide whether to place the
matter on the ballot, probably at their
meeting next Monday, Feb. 26.
City Attorney Peter Stone strongly
hinted last week that he will
recommend that the council not place
the question on the ballot. He called
the measure "patently invalid," and
said that therefore, paying the
expenses of an election might be a
misuse of public funds.
Luce said that the petitioners
believe the council has no authority to
exclude the issue from the ballot if
enough signatures are obtained.
"People will be at the council
meeting Monday," she said. "If they
[the council members] turn it down,
we will go to court within a week" to
seek to have the issue placed before
the voters. "We're going to get it on
the ballot one way or the other."
