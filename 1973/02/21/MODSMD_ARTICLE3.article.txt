# Kurds, Rupert Attack Intimidation Of Press
## 
### CHRISTY WISE 
"There is a major attack underway"
on the civil liberties of the people of
the United States according to both
Paul Rupert and Bill Kurtis, opening
speakers in a series of four lectures
discussing "Might v. Right in
America."
Speaking last night at Cubberley
Auditorium to a crowd of about 250
people, Paul Rupert of the Military
Law Project and Bill Kurtis from CBS
network news, agreed that during the
next four years the United States will
experience "a massive attack" on civil
liberties, "especially on the press,"
said Kurtis.
Kurtis, presently assigned to the
Pentagon Papers trial of Daniel
Ellsberg and Anthony J. Russo, feels
the Pentagon Papers incident was "one
of the first indications that we were
involved in an unprecedented
situation. It was the first time in
history the Supreme Court imposed
prior restraint."
Kurtis cited the CBS News
production "The Sfrlling of the
Pentagon" as another indication of
encroachment on civil liberties. "The
door is now closed to CBS News" in
covering many government matters,
according to Kurtis.
Lasting Effects
"We're still really living with 'The
Selling of the Pentagon.'" he
continued.
Kurtis sees a thrust on the part of
government to return to the 1900's
when there was a lack of dissemination
of information. He feels the criticism
of the press by Spiro Agnew and Clay
Whitehead contribute to public
opinion that the press is "no longer
reputable."
The news, according to Kurtis, soon
won't be effective or independent in
reporting government actions.
Subpoenas, he feels, are used "as a
government tool to soften up news
media and reporters."

"Is there a chilling effect?" Kurtis
answered his own question by relating
an incident during the Pentagon Papers
trial where some lawyers requested
that newsmen not ask certain
questions.
Sources Close Up
"A news source is closing up,"
stated Kurtis. He added, "We may not
know the whole effect because of
self-censorship . . . There are stories
that may not ever be covered."
He urged resistence to this chilling

effect, admitting, "We are terribly bad
in not fighting for our freedoms. We
pass up a lot of opportunities."
Kurtis concluded that the job of a
newsman is not to make the job of
government easier, "not to be popular
with the people or the government,
but honest with both. The more
people know, the better off they will
be."
Rupert, currently working with the
National Lawyers' Guild Military Law
Office in San Francisco, feels there is

"no way to change this country
without a lot of struggle... We
cannot survive in the kind of America
Nixon has planned."
Silencing Groups
Comparing Richard Nixon's actions
of attacking various groups until
gradually all were silenced, with those
of the Nazis, Rupert said, "Our
responsibility is to see that,
understand it, and begin fighting it
before it continues further in this
country."
Rupert outlined the history of the
attack on civil liberties, focusing on his
personal involvement. He came to
Stanford in 1963 and like most
students at that time, believed that the
United States was "the best country
that had ever been and ever could be."
As civil rights movements, and an
awareness of Vietnam developed, so
did "a whole different notion of
America and American foreign
policy." He noted that the University
and national government were still
relatively tolerant of protests and
sit-ins until 1968 when students
decided to cripple local war
contributors because people in
Washington wouldn't listen.
Initial Target
The movement against Stanford
war research was the first
"confrontation with the institution
itself," Rupert said.
The ensuing battle between
students and the University created,
according to Rupert, a "coordinated
attack on civil liberties," both on the
national and local level.
Rupert himself was convicted of
draft evasion and given probation and
exile from Santa Clara County for five
years. He feels it was a mistake to
accept exile and not recognize that "if
we are to mount a serious assault, if
we are to win a war, if we are to
change the country, there are prices to
be paid ... It won't be easy all the
time."
