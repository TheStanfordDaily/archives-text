# Hoffa Calls Chavez 'Incompetent'
## 
### NANCI COLVERT 
Jimmy Hoffa, former Teamster
Union president and ex-convict who is
now touring the country, "speaking
out" on prison reform, made a pitstop
appearance here last night. He talked
about his future plans in the union,
and called United Farm Workers leader
Cesar Chavez "incompetent."
Hoffa was released from Lewisburg
Federal Penitentiary by presidential
commutation in December, 1971,
after having served 58 months of a
13-year sentence for fraud and jury
tampering.
As a condition of his parole, Hoffa
is barred from engaging in union

activities until March 6, 1980.
He denied that his release had any
connection to the Teamsters'
subsequent support of President Nixon
in the November election.
Nixon Support
"I have supported Richard Nixon
ever since he first went into politics,"
he said.
In his speech, Hoffa condemned the
dehumanizing conditions present in
today's prisons. He blamed
homosexuality, which he says prison
authorities condone, for causing most
prison violence.
But it was not his prepared
comments on prison conditions and
reform which provoked the most
reaction from the audience.
Chavez 'Incompetent'
In the question and answer period
which followed his speech, Hoffa was
hissed when he called Chavez
"incompetent."
Hoffa stated, "Chavez doesn't have
the money or the staff to fight the
large employers and get for the
farmworkers what they want.
"We're not going to give up to
another union what is under our
jurisdiction. We'll fight Chavez, just
like we fight employers, until we win,
and we will win."
Depersonalization
Later, to the accompaniment of
much applause, an audience member
asked Hoffa whether he thought his
belief in Teamster power, and lack of
self-determination for farmworkers
directly contradicted his concern for
the depersonalization of people in
prisons.
He responded that it was a different
situation because the union doesn't
take away personal needs and a man's
right to decide where he wants to
work.
Hoffa's ability to speak for
prisoners was challenged by a former

San Quentin inmate who said, "You
know as well as I do that there's a
difference between convicts with
money and convicts without — there's
an awful lot you can buy."
'A Real Man'
Hoffa subsequently denied having
received any special treatment in
prison and had his honor defended by
an audience member, claiming to have
been in Lewisburg with him, who
stated, "Jimmy's a real man."
In an earlier exclusive Daily
interview, Hoffa stated that he plans
to return to labor management
activities as soon as possible, and that
he is hoping for a presidential pardon
or clarification of the 1980 restriction.
"I think the time restriction
exceeds the usual sentence for the
offense, and is therefore
unconstitutional," he said.
Law Firms
Hoffa currently has three law firms
working on the case, which he intends
to take to court in March if a pardon
isn't granted.
"After spending 40 years of my life
in the labor movement, its only
natural that I would want to go back,"
he said.
He reiterated that he would not
push out current president Frank E.

Fitzsimmons, "a friend of mine who I
recommended for the job," but noted
that when his five-year term is up in
1976, Fitzsimmons will be 69 years
old.
'Personal Decision'
"He may not want to run again.
It'll be his personal decision. But I'm
going to run if I'm eligible," he said.
Hoffa celebrated his 60th birthday
on Valentine's Day.
In reference to Robert F.
Kennedy's book, The Enemy Within,
which exposes many incidents of
alleged corruption concerning his
Teamster dealings, Hoffa stated, "A
lot of that is false or taken out of
context.
"It was just a springboard for
Kennedy to propagandize in his own
name," he said.
When asked if he thought the book
had affected his credibility, he
responded, "You just ask those men
(Teamsters) if they don't want Jimmy
Hoffa back leading them again."
Hoffa began his career in the labor
movement at the age of 16 when he
worked in a warehouse for 36 cents an
hour. He was involved in his first
successful strike for better working
conditions in 1932, the height of the
Depression.

natural that I would want to go back,"
he said.
He reiterated that he would not
push out current president Frank E.

Fitzsimmons, "a friend of mine who I
recommended for the job," but noted
that when his five-year term is up in
1976, Fitzsimmons will be 69 years
old.
'Personal Decision'
"He may not want to run again.
It'll be his personal decision. But I'm
going to run if I'm eligible," he said.
Hoffa celebrated his 60th birthday
on Valentine's Day.
In reference to Robert F.
Kennedy's book, The Enemy Within,
which exposes many incidents of
alleged corruption concerning his
Teamster dealings, Hoffa stated, "A
lot of that is false or taken out of
context.
"It was just a springboard for
Kennedy to propagandize in his own
name," he said.
When asked if he thought the book
had affected his credibility, he
responded, "You just ask those men
(Teamsters) if they don't want Jimmy
Hoffa back leading them again."
Hoffa began his career in the labor
movement at the age of 16 when he
worked in a warehouse for 36 cents an
hour. He was involved in his first
successful strike for better working
conditions in 1932, the height of the
Depression.

HOFFA RETURNS — In a speech last night at Annenberg Auditorium, Jimmy
Hoffa augmented his prepared remarks on prison reform with a lively discussion
of Teamster activities and relations with the United Farmworkers.
Jimmy Hoffa, former Teamster
Union president and ex-convict who is
now touring the country, "speaking
out" on prison reform, made a pitstop
appearance here last night. He talked
about his future plans in the union,
and called United Farm Workers leader
Cesar Chavez "incompetent."
Hoffa was released from Lewisburg
Federal Penitentiary by presidential
commutation in December, 1971,
after having served 58 months of a
13-year sentence for fraud and jury
tampering.
As a condition of his parole, Hoffa
is barred from engaging in union

activities until March 6, 1980.
He denied that his release had any
connection to the Teamsters'
subsequent support of President Nixon
in the November election.
Nixon Support
"I have supported Richard Nixon
ever since he first went into politics,"
he said.
In his speech, Hoffa condemned the
dehumanizing conditions present in
today's prisons. He blamed
homosexuality, which he says prison
authorities condone, for causing most
prison violence.
But it was not his prepared
comments on prison conditions and
reform which provoked the most
reaction from the audience.
Chavez 'Incompetent'
In the question and answer period
which followed his speech, Hoffa was
hissed when he called Chavez
"incompetent."
Hoffa stated, "Chavez doesn't have
the money or the staff to fight the
large employers and get for the
farmworkers what they want.
"We're not going to give up to
another union what is under our
jurisdiction. We'll fight Chavez, just
like we fight employers, until we win,
and we will win."
Depersonalization
Later, to the accompaniment of
much applause, an audience member
asked Hoffa whether he thought his
belief in Teamster power, and lack of
self-determination for farmworkers
directly contradicted his concern for
the depersonalization of people in
prisons.
He responded that it was a different
situation because the union doesn't
take away personal needs and a man's
right to decide where he wants to
work.
Hoffa's ability to speak for
prisoners was challenged by a former

San Quentin inmate who said, "You
know as well as I do that there's a
difference between convicts with
money and convicts without — there's
an awful lot you can buy."
'A Real Man'
Hoffa subsequently denied having
received any special treatment in
prison and had his honor defended by
an audience member, claiming to have
been in Lewisburg with him, who
stated, "Jimmy's a real man."
In an earlier exclusive Daily
interview, Hoffa stated that he plans
to return to labor management
activities as soon as possible, and that
he is hoping for a presidential pardon
or clarification of the 1980 restriction.
"I think the time restriction
exceeds the usual sentence for the
offense, and is therefore
unconstitutional," he said.
Law Firms
Hoffa currently has three law firms
working on the case, which he intends
to take to court in March if a pardon
isn't granted.
"After spending 40 years of my life
in the labor movement, its only
natural that I would want to go back,"
he said.
He reiterated that he would not
push out current president Frank E.

jurisdiction. We'll fight Chavez, just
like we fight employers, until we win,
and we will win."
Depersonalization
Later, to the accompaniment of
much applause, an audience member
asked Hoffa whether he thought his
belief in Teamster power, and lack of
self-determination for farmworkers
directly contradicted his concern for
the depersonalization of people in
prisons.
He responded that it was a different
situation because the union doesn't
take away personal needs and a man's
right to decide where he wants to
work.
Hoffa's ability to speak for
prisoners was challenged by a former

San Quentin inmate who said, "You
know as well as I do that there's a
difference between convicts with
money and convicts without — there's
an awful lot you can buy."
'A Real Man'
Hoffa subsequently denied having
received any special treatment in
prison and had his honor defended by
an audience member, claiming to have
been in Lewisburg with him, who
stated, "Jimmy's a real man."
In an earlier exclusive Daily
interview, Hoffa stated that he plans
to return to labor management
activities as soon as possible, and that
he is hoping for a presidential pardon
or clarification of the 1980 restriction.
"I think the time restriction
exceeds the usual sentence for the
offense, and is therefore
unconstitutional," he said.
Law Firms
Hoffa currently has three law firms
working on the case, which he intends
to take to court in March if a pardon
isn't granted.
"After spending 40 years of my life
in the labor movement, its only
natural that I would want to go back,"
he said.
He reiterated that he would not
push out current president Frank E.

Fitzsimmons, "a friend of mine who I
recommended for the job," but noted
that when his five-year term is up in
1976, Fitzsimmons will be 69 years
old.
'Personal Decision'
"He may not want to run again.
It'll be his personal decision. But I'm
going to run if I'm eligible," he said.
Hoffa celebrated his 60th birthday
on Valentine's Day.
In reference to Robert F.
Kennedy's book, The Enemy Within,
which exposes many incidents of
alleged corruption concerning his
Teamster dealings, Hoffa stated, "A
lot of that is false or taken out of
context.
"It was just a springboard for
Kennedy to propagandize in his own
name," he said.
When asked if he thought the book
had affected his credibility, he
responded, "You just ask those men
(Teamsters) if they don't want Jimmy
Hoffa back leading them again."
Hoffa began his career in the labor
movement at the age of 16 when he
worked in a warehouse for 36 cents an
hour. He was involved in his first
successful strike for better working
conditions in 1932, the height of the
Depression.

Hoffa augmented his prepared remarks on prison reform with a lively discussion
of Teamster activities and relations with the United Farmworkers.
