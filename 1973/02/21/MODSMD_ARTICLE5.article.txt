# Motions Delay Start In Holman-Burt Trial
## 
### TERRY ANZUR 
Arguments over pre-trial motions
continued to delay jury selection in
the trial of Andrea Holman and
Benton Douglas Burt in San
Bernardino County Superior Court
yesterday.
Holman and Burt are charged with
murder and lynching (removal of a
prisoner from lawful custody) in
connection with Ronald Beaty's Oct. 6
escape from the California Institution
for Men in Chino, in which one prison
guard was killed and another
wounded.
Yesterday morning the prosecution
introduced a motion to try former
Venceremos members Jean Hobson
and Robert Seabock concurrently with
Holman and Burt. Hobson, who was
arrested with Beaty Dec. 11, and
Seabock, the accused "trigger man" in
the escape, face the same charges as
Holman and Burt.
Attorney Charles Garry,
representing Holman and Burt,
opposed the joint trial motion. "The
prosecution wants to prejudice our
case by trying all four defendants
together," Garry charged. "We have
enough problems without the
consideration of additional
defendants."
Defense Motion
A defense motion to suppress
evidence gathered by the FBI in excess
of search warrant provisions was also
considered in court yesterday. The
motion refers to three specific
warrants for a search of Holman and
Burt's Hayward apartment Oct. 12,
and later searches of the Hobson and

Seabock homes. Letters written by
Holman and a diary describing her trip
to Cuba are among the evidence in
question.
Judge Joseph B. Campbell heard
the motions yesterday and scheduled
arguments for today's session,
beginning at 10 a.m.
Garry plans to introduce a motion
to quash the San Bernardino County
Grand Jury that indicted his clients,
charging that its members were
"hand-picked."
Like all grand juries in the state, the
San Bernardino County panel was
chosen by the county's Superior Court
judges, not by the random process
through which trial jury panels are
selected.
Trial Delay
The series of pre-trial motions
delaying jury selection and actual trial
proceedings in the case, is reminiscent
of similar delays in the Angela Davis
case two years ago.
However, Garry maintained, "It is
not a strategy on our part. The
motions were introduced three months
ago." Arguments on the motions cause
the delay, he explained.
"We have been ready for trial since
January 8," Garry continued. The
prosecution motion for a joint trial
would postpone proceedings until Mar.
28, when Hobson and Seabock's case
is scheduled for trial.
Should the motion to include
Hobson and Seabock in the
Holman-Burt trial be denied, Garry
predicts jury selection will begin
sometime next week.
