## Consumerism 
### 
Last fail the Daily established a primitive form of a Consumer
Affairs department with the introduction of "Bug Me" and "Big
Daddy." The favorable responses "Bug Me" has received indicate that
it is serving a valuable campus function, but the limitations of its short
question-answer format has finally prompted the Daily to establish a
full-time Consumer Affairs department.
The news media have become an important force in educating the
public in consumer issues and the options available in making
consumer decisions. Through its new status, the Daily Consumer
Affairs department hopes to become an active source of consumer
information and to do more in-depth reporting on issues of student
interest.
Although establishing this new department is a long needed first
step, its success is not guaranteed. It is only through an increased
number of people willing to do the research and reporting that
Consumer Affairs can become a viable force on campus.
Approaches
Reports on consumer legislation are one approach to consumer
reporting. Many are unaware that California state law requires all auto
repair shops to put all cost estimates in writing and clearly state when
rebuilt parts are used. The California Bureau of Auto Repairs was the
first of its kind in the nation and its toll free number must be
prominently posted in all such shops.
Price and quality comparisons and standards for food, food stores,
clothes, over-the-counter and prescription drugs are only a few
subjects covered in consumer reporting. Others include insurance,
health care, credit buying, automobile and bicycle sales and repairs
and checking advertising claims.
Daily reporters are presently working on articles on housing and
rents in the Palo Alto area, the food service, comparative prices of
records in the area, and local restaurant reviews. The possibilities for
future articles are numerous and need only willing students to explore
them.
Rip-Offs
In a community such as Stanford, where most students must deal
with local merchants, it is important to be informed of legal rights and
the best prices and biggest rip-offs in the area.
The Consumer Affairs department is offering a unique opportunity
for students of all disciplines to contribute to the consumer awareness
of the student body. Deadline pressures will not be as intense for the
sake of thorough investigative coverage.
Consumer affairs are matters in which we are all experienced. Ours
is a consumer oriented society and we are constantly faced with
consumer decisions. The Daily is finally offering a chance to channel
these experiences into the in-depth objective reporting which will
hopefully become an important educative force for the student and
business community as well. I hope that more students will recognize
the merits of this endeavor and come to the Daily to help the
Consumer Affairs department reach its full potential.
