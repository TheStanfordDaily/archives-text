# What Happens To A Dream Deferred?
## The
						Most Important Struggle 
### 
Larry Diamond

(Editor's Note: This is the
second of two parts. The first
part, which appeared yesterday,
dealt with the return to apathy in
the civil rights movement.)
Frustration exploded violently
in Watts in 1965, in Detroit in
1967, and so on. Money poured
forth in federal programs with
dazzling new names like "Head
Start" and "Model Cities." In no
case was it ever enough money to
seriously attack poverty or urban
decay, but at least it was a start.
And now, in one of the great fits
of cruelty from an American
President, Richard Nixon is trying
to starve the programs and erase
the start; and almost nobody is
paying any attention.
In many of America's slums,
conditions are worse than when
they exploded in the mid-19605.
It would be hard to find a single
pocket of urban poverty in this
country that is substantially
better off now than it was five
years ago.
In any city in the country, plot
the points where the crime rate,
the drug addiction rate, and the
unemployment rate are the
highest; where the average
income, the average level of
education, and the average
number of doctors and medical
clinics is the lowest; plot the
points where the schools are most
rapidly falling apart, where the
residents are most frequently
harassed by the police, where the
housing is the most dilapidated
and the rents the most unjust, and
where the children are dying from
heroin, and from guns and knives
turned on each other—plot all
these points, as Ramsey Clark has
told us, and we find them all in
the same place. It is the place
where the bulk of the non-white
population lives—the Chicanos
and blacks in Los Angeles, the
Puerto Ricans and blacks in New
York, the American Indians in the
rural Southwest, and so on.
Change Imperative
These kinds of realities will not
disappear because we pretend
they don't exist. Their victims will
not remain passive if change does
not come soon. For those who are

oppressed every day by the
injustices of ghetto life, by the
misfortune of being born with
skin that is not white, the dream
has not died. Hie struggle for it is
alive and determined.
It takes many forms. Blacks
have won sweeping electoral
victories in many cities and
municipalities. In Oakland, the
founder of the Black Panther
party, bound in chains and gagged
in a courtroom only three years
ago, is now running a serious
campaign for Mayor. And all over,
the Black Panthers have laid aside
their guns for breakfast programs
and medical clinics and the like.
They are not alone. Black
community organizations and
black businesses are working to
erase the social and economic
injustices of ghetto life without
waiting for white America to do it
for them. They aren't asking for a
handout, only a hand.
A White Slap
But the hand isn't coming from
white America, not even from its
government, unless in the form of
a slap.
White racism, manifested
increasingly in an apthy that is in
some ways more perverse than
blatant discrimination, remains
the most destructive social
influence in this country; poverty
and hunger and urban rot remain
the most urgent, and needless,
domestic crises we face.
Given the extent and the
persistence of these conditions,
we should feel fortunate that the
cities have not yet blown up
again. But they surely will if we
sit back and allow things to stay
the same, allow the very, very,
rich to accumulate and control
the nation's wealth in their own
very few hands, allow the
Pentagon to spend dollars on
frivolous weapons that should
have been spent on houses and
schools.
Easy Not To Care
It is very easy for whites who
are economically comfortable to
not care about non-whites who
are not. If the War in Indochina
ever ends, it will be even easier for
us all not to care about anything
beyond our own personal

horizons (though even now, Asian
deaths are concerning hardly any
of us at all).
Such an egoism is more than
immoral, it is self-destructive. It is
just such an egoism that has
ruined both nations and men. If
we do not reclaim our stake in the
dream, if we do not resume the
struggle that was so cruelly halted
by this awful war, if we do not
join hands and share hearts with
the Panthers and the farmworkers
and the sharecroppers, the
minority businesses, day care
centers, training centers, and
community organizations, the
dream will explode all over again,
worse than before.
The struggle for this dream is
going to be the most important
struggle in America. It is going to
demand an activism that is
tougher and more mature than the
spasms of involvement that have
swept this generation whenever a
new electorial messiah emerged or
a new crisis in the war erupted (as
if the whole war was not a crisis)
and have gone when the messiah
lost the election, or when
whatever particular tactic we
chose for the month didn't work.
Lifelong Activism
It will demand activism over
the entire course of our lives, and
in many different forms: in
electoral politics, in community
politics, in legal protest, in
extra-legal protest; never in
violence, but always in a
determination that communicates
to the power structure that we are
not going to quit even if we lose
the present battle; sometimes in
massive orgasms of work and
protest, sometimes in small quiet,
constant projects, but always with
a deep sense of urgency, that time
is running out.
The forces of reaction are
gaining strength in America. In
fear and confusion, a growing
number of Americans are
accepting the demagogic answers
to the problems of social unrest
that arc offered by such men as
Spiro Agnew and George Wallace.
It is possible that another round
of riots in the cities could cause
this democracy to be disfigured in
ways we dare not even imagine.
If it is not to come to that, we
must pick up where Vietnam
forced us to leave off. We must
resume the human rights
movement and start talking again
about its message: that democracy
and social injustice will not much
longer survive side by side in this
country.
Outlasting 'Establishment'
Such a movement will succeed
if it will add to the courage and
imagination of the anti-war
movement a quality it sorely
lacked—the patience and tenacity

to outlast the establishment.
Such a movement can reorder
the economic structure of the
country in a way that will finally
give meaning to the popular
illusion that everyone in America
has an equal chance.
Such a movement can insure
that no child will go hungry in
America. t
And such a movement can even
move this country to a very
different world rule, in which we
cease robbing and draining an
underdeveloped world
increasingly less resigned to a fate
of famine and mass misery, and
offer to non-white peoples
everywhere a share in the world's
wealth, before that fair share is
seized violently on the
international scene as well.
