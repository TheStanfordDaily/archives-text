# Ramsey Clark Observes 'Time Of Fear' In U.S.
## 
### JIM WASCHER 
Former U.S. Attorney General
Ramsey Clark last night told an
audience of 700 people in Memorial
Auditorium that this is "a time of
fear" in the United States.
Clark explained that many
Americans "think there is some
contest between safety and freedom."
He emphasized that "the only way to
enlarge either is to enlarge both."
Assoc. Law Prof. Barbara Babcock
joined Clark in the second of a series
of four programs on "Might v. Right in
America." The Stanford Committee
On Political Education (SCOPE) is
sponsoring the four-day symposium.
The former Attorney General said
"the desperate, imperative need of the
American people is what Earl Warren
called a political conception of
compassion. We can and must be both
gentle and strong."
Supreme Court
Clark devoted most of his speech to
the U.S. Supreme Court, which he
called "the most conservative
institution in American government."
He said that while Warren was Chief
Justice, the Court "detected the basic
needs of American society in that
epoch, confronted them and tried to
solve them."
According to Clark, "the Warren
Court believed that there was a spirit
of the Constitution" which ought to
be enforced as rigorously as is its
specific provisions. He added that "the
idea of strict construction of the
Constitution is metaphysical."
Clark praised the Warren Court for
its 1954 decision requiring
desegregation of public schools,
pointing out that "racism is intolerable
to human dignity." However, Clark
cautioned that "the courts can't solve
that problem. They can't blow a
whistle and say 'All you people skate
the other way!' "
Discussing the Warren Court's
rulings on legislative reapportionment,
Clark said they were "an effective
human problem solver which liberated
the institutions of government from
the 18th and 19th centuries." He
added that "when it is dealing with
government institutions, the Court can
make some difference."
In contrast, Clark said "the police
paid essentially no attention to the
Miranda decision," which requires that

a criminal suspect be informed of his
legal rights immediately upon arrest.
Clark said the Warren Court
"provided moral leadership — it said
'This is what we stand for, this is what
we believe in, this is the spirit of the
Constitution.' "
Babcock, who joined the faculty
here last year after serving as Director
of the District of Columbia Public
Defender Service, said "public
defenders are overwhelmed by too
many cases for too few lawyers."
She cited a study conducted in
1969-70 which found that the 22
public defenders in San Francisco
represented a total of 34,920
defendants during that year at an
average cost to the city of six dollars
per case.
According to Babcock, many public
defenders suffer from a sense of
"insecurity and uncertainty" caused
by their "lack of skill and training."
She stated that "the neophyte public
defender finds himself in court
virtually from the first day on the
job."
Babcock said she blames trial judges
for allowing defendants to be tried and
often convicted after receiving
"inadequate assistance from counsel."
She criticized appellate courts for not
reversing these convictions and lashed
out at the trial lawyers themselves for
not insisting that they be given time to
"investigate each case thoroughly."
Society's Pariahs
The law professor added that "the
resources for the poor accused are not
there because we, the American
people, do not want them there." She
said poor defendants are "the pariahs
of our society."
Babcock concluded that "access to
counsel is the index to class structure
in the United States."

During an interview prior to his
speech, Clark said he opposes
wire-tapping "under all conditions,"
adding that it is "wholly foreign to my
sense of what the Constitution's all
about."
The SCOPE symposium continues
today at 8 p.m. in Cubberley
Auditorium with speeches on "Patsies,
Provocateurs and Power." American
Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) attorney
Paul Halvonik and Frank Donner, who
directs the ACLU's political
surveillance research project, will
participate.
Tomorrow at 8 p.m. in Memorial
Church, "Pentagon Papers" defendant
Daniel Ellsberg and Ramparts Press
editor Steve Weissman will discuss
"Why Is Nixon Doing What He's
Doing?"
