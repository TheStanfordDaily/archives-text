# The 						Subsidy State
## Class Struggle And The Budget 
### 
Bill Evers

The "battle of the budget"
continues in Washington, D.C.,
with President Nixon, his
Congressional opponents, and all
the special interest groups rushing
around hacking away at each
other. Indeed, the blood and
thunder of the current budget
preparation provides an
instructive lesson as to the form
that class struggle takes in the
United States today: fighting over
control of the budget.
What we are witnessing is a
struggle between (1) the
President's Office of Management
and Budget, representing certain

business interests who desire a
planned, coordinated economy
geared to their nation-wide and
international activity and (2)
members of Congress representing
small, regional, and local business
interests.
All of this is taking place
within the constraints set up by
an expanding and grasping
bureaucracy on one side and an
increasingly militant and
self-conscious taxpayers' revolt on
the other.
Taxation Is Theft
Looking closely at the
budgetary process can only make
us acutely aware that taxation is
theft and that the budgetary
process is a struggle among thieves
over the spoils. But by looking
closely at the budget we can
identify who are the robbers and
who are the despoiled.
In the end, we discover that, in
the words of economist James
O'Connor, "the problem of
financing the budget ... reduces
itself to the problem of increasing
taxes, specifically, the problem of
intensifying tax exploitation of
the working class, owners of small
businesses, and self-employed
professionals. The issue of taxes
has always been a class issue."
To see just how the Subsidy
State works in practice, let's look
briefly at three programs:
socialized medicine, urban
renewal, and federal college
housing loans. While these
programs, like all other budget
items in recent years, serve a
multiplicity of interest groups, it is
possible to discover the essence of
how the programs work.
Poverty Billionaires
The medical care industry is
big business amounting to $85
billion per annum now. The
political economy of medical care
in America is evolving, under
Nixon as under his Democratic
predecessors, into an integrated
system.
When this is completed, the
delivery system managers (Kaiser,
Blue Cross), the medical products
ma n u facturers (from the

pharmaceutical companies to
Litton Industries), and the
medical technicians (grouped into
the doctors' guild known as the
American Medical Association),
all will be organized and
subsidized by the government.
The losers in this process will
be the taxpayers, patients, and
independent doctors. The winners
will be men like Ross Perot, the
"poverty billionaire." According
to James Ridgeway, writing in the
Village Voice of October 12,
1972, Perot's fortune was
estimated in 1970 at more than
$1 billion. It is derived from his
computer company, Electronic
Data Systems Corporation. The
bulk of the company's revenues
come from Medicare computer
contracts, contracts which Perot
was given because of his political
contacts.
Urban Nonrenewal
While it has been known for
some time that urban renewal
programs threw the poor out of
their homes, diminished the
amount of low-income housing,
and fattened the bankers, building
contractors, and real estate
interests, an excellent illustration
has just appeared in the story of
the West Philadelphia federal
office building constructed by
close friends of Senator Hugh
Scott.
The Feb. 18 New York Times
speaks of "the ability of friends
and associates of . . . Scott,
Republican of Pennsylvania, the
Senate minority floor leader, to
win for a real estate developer a
Federal contract worth up to $78
million even though the bid was
higher than the others and did
not, according to a report of the
General Accounting Office, meet
legal requirements."
According to the Times, the
real estate developer has been a
friend of Scott for 25 years and
was a contributor to his 1970
re-election campaign. The legal
negotiations were handled by a
lawyer who is the developer's
nephew, is a member of Scott's
law firm, and was treasurer of The

Friends of Hugh Scott (an
election finance group). The two
government bureaucrats most
directly responsible for awarding
the contract were also proteges of
Scott.
College Housing Loans
The case of the federal college
housing loan program provides a
third example of who is doing
something to whom through the
channels of the Subsidy State.
Commenting upon a 1972
study of college housing,
economist Yale Brozen writes:
"The average family income of
college students living away from
home exceeds median family
income in the United States by a
considerable margin . . . .
Professor [John J.] Agria finds
that the colleges whose
enrollments include comparatively
large numbers of low income
students, such as junior colleges,
receive no subsidy, since normally
these colleges do not provide
housing. Much if not most of the
subsidy provided under the
college housing program goes to
students from above the median
income families. But the less
affluent families share the tax
burden which provides the
subsidy."
Professor Brozen goes on to
argue: "It would seem appropriate
that college students themselves
bear the cost of their education,
whether they come from low or
high income families. ... Since
the college student's investment in
his education produces a
handsome return—an income 70
percent higher than that of a high
school graduate—it hardly seems
necessary to give him any part of
the investment."
These are the cold hard facts of
the Subsidy State. It is over
benefits like these that various
groups struggle in the making of
the budget. No wonder the
victims in the whole process—the
net taxpayers—are in revolt.

will be men like Ross Perot, the
"poverty billionaire." According
to James Ridgeway, writing in the
Village Voice of October 12,
1972, Perot's fortune was
estimated in 1970 at more than
$1 billion. It is derived from his
computer company, Electronic
Data Systems Corporation. The
bulk of the company's revenues
come from Medicare computer
contracts, contracts which Perot
was given because of his political
contacts.
Urban Nonrenewal
While it has been known for
some time that urban renewal
programs threw the poor out of
their homes, diminished the
amount of low-income housing,
and fattened the bankers, building
contractors, and real estate
interests, an excellent illustration
has just appeared in the story of
the West Philadelphia federal
office building constructed by
close friends of Senator Hugh
Scott.
The Feb. 18 New York Times
speaks of "the ability of friends
and associates of . . . Scott,
Republican of Pennsylvania, the
Senate minority floor leader, to
win for a real estate developer a
Federal contract worth up to $78
million even though the bid was
higher than the others and did
not, according to a report of the
General Accounting Office, meet
legal requirements."
According to the Times, the
real estate developer has been a
friend of Scott for 25 years and
was a contributor to his 1970
re-election campaign. The legal
negotiations were handled by a
lawyer who is the developer's
nephew, is a member of Scott's
law firm, and was treasurer of The

Friends of Hugh Scott (an
election finance group). The two
government bureaucrats most
directly responsible for awarding
the contract were also proteges of
Scott.
College Housing Loans
The case of the federal college
housing loan program provides a
third example of who is doing
something to whom through the
channels of the Subsidy State.
Commenting upon a 1972
study of college housing,
economist Yale Brozen writes:
"The average family income of
college students living away from
home exceeds median family
income in the United States by a
considerable margin . . . .
Professor [John J.] Agria finds
that the colleges whose
enrollments include comparatively
large numbers of low income
students, such as junior colleges,
receive no subsidy, since normally
these colleges do not provide
housing. Much if not most of the
subsidy provided under the
college housing program goes to
students from above the median
income families. But the less
affluent families share the tax
burden which provides the
subsidy."
Professor Brozen goes on to
argue: "It would seem appropriate
that college students themselves
bear the cost of their education,
whether they come from low or
high income families. ... Since
the college student's investment in
his education produces a
handsome return—an income 70
percent higher than that of a high
school graduate—it hardly seems
necessary to give him any part of
the investment."
These are the cold hard facts of
the Subsidy State. It is over
benefits like these that various
groups struggle in the making of
the budget. No wonder the
victims in the whole process—the
net taxpayers—are in revolt.

The "battle of the budget"
continues in Washington, D.C.,
with President Nixon, his
Congressional opponents, and all
the special interest groups rushing
around hacking away at each
other. Indeed, the blood and
thunder of the current budget
preparation provides an
instructive lesson as to the form
that class struggle takes in the
United States today: fighting over
control of the budget.
What we are witnessing is a
struggle between (1) the
President's Office of Management
and Budget, representing certain

business interests who desire a
planned, coordinated economy
geared to their nation-wide and
international activity and (2)
members of Congress representing
small, regional, and local business
interests.
All of this is taking place
within the constraints set up by
an expanding and grasping
bureaucracy on one side and an
increasingly militant and
self-conscious taxpayers' revolt on
the other.
Taxation Is Theft
Looking closely at the
budgetary process can only make
us acutely aware that taxation is
theft and that the budgetary
process is a struggle among thieves
over the spoils. But by looking
closely at the budget we can
identify who are the robbers and
who are the despoiled.
In the end, we discover that, in
the words of economist James
O'Connor, "the problem of
financing the budget ... reduces
itself to the problem of increasing
taxes, specifically, the problem of
intensifying tax exploitation of
the working class, owners of small
businesses, and self-employed
professionals. The issue of taxes
has always been a class issue."
To see just how the Subsidy
State works in practice, let's look
briefly at three programs:
socialized medicine, urban
renewal, and federal college
housing loans. While these
programs, like all other budget
items in recent years, serve a
multiplicity of interest groups, it is
possible to discover the essence of
how the programs work.
Poverty Billionaires
The medical care industry is
big business amounting to $85
billion per annum now. The
political economy of medical care
in America is evolving, under
Nixon as under his Democratic
predecessors, into an integrated
system.
When this is completed, the
delivery system managers (Kaiser,
Blue Cross), the medical products
ma n u facturers (from the

pharmaceutical companies to
Litton Industries), and the
medical technicians (grouped into
the doctors' guild known as the
American Medical Association),
all will be organized and
subsidized by the government.
The losers in this process will
be the taxpayers, patients, and
independent doctors. The winners
will be men like Ross Perot, the

subsidy."
Professor Brozen goes on to
argue: "It would seem appropriate
that college students themselves
bear the cost of their education,
whether they come from low or
high income families. ... Since
the college student's investment in
his education produces a
handsome return—an income 70
percent higher than that of a high
school graduate—it hardly seems
necessary to give him any part of
the investment."
These are the cold hard facts of
the Subsidy State. It is over
benefits like these that various
groups struggle in the making of
the budget. No wonder the
victims in the whole process—the
net taxpayers—are in revolt.

The "battle of the budget"
continues in Washington, D.C.,
with President Nixon, his
Congressional opponents, and all
the special interest groups rushing
around hacking away at each
other. Indeed, the blood and
thunder of the current budget
preparation provides an
instructive lesson as to the form
that class struggle takes in the
United States today: fighting over
control of the budget.
What we are witnessing is a
struggle between (1) the
President's Office of Management
and Budget, representing certain

business interests who desire a
planned, coordinated economy
geared to their nation-wide and
international activity and (2)
members of Congress representing
small, regional, and local business
interests.
All of this is taking place
within the constraints set up by
an expanding and grasping
bureaucracy on one side and an
increasingly militant and
self-conscious taxpayers' revolt on
the other.
Taxation Is Theft
Looking closely at the
budgetary process can only make
us acutely aware that taxation is
theft and that the budgetary
process is a struggle among thieves
over the spoils. But by looking
closely at the budget we can
identify who are the robbers and
who are the despoiled.
In the end, we discover that, in
the words of economist James
O'Connor, "the problem of
financing the budget ... reduces
itself to the problem of increasing
taxes, specifically, the problem of
intensifying tax exploitation of
the working class, owners of small
businesses, and self-employed
professionals. The issue of taxes
has always been a class issue."
To see just how the Subsidy
State works in practice, let's look
briefly at three programs:
socialized medicine, urban
renewal, and federal college
housing loans. While these
programs, like all other budget
items in recent years, serve a
multiplicity of interest groups, it is
possible to discover the essence of
how the programs work.
Poverty Billionaires
The medical care industry is
big business amounting to $85
billion per annum now. The
political economy of medical care
in America is evolving, under
Nixon as under his Democratic
predecessors, into an integrated
system.
When this is completed, the
delivery system managers (Kaiser,
Blue Cross), the medical products
ma n u facturers (from the

pharmaceutical companies to
Litton Industries), and the
medical technicians (grouped into
the doctors' guild known as the
American Medical Association),
all will be organized and
subsidized by the government.
The losers in this process will
be the taxpayers, patients, and
independent doctors. The winners
will be men like Ross Perot, the
"poverty billionaire." According
to James Ridgeway, writing in the
Village Voice of October 12,
1972, Perot's fortune was
estimated in 1970 at more than
$1 billion. It is derived from his
computer company, Electronic
Data Systems Corporation. The
bulk of the company's revenues
come from Medicare computer
contracts, contracts which Perot
was given because of his political
contacts.
Urban Nonrenewal
While it has been known for
some time that urban renewal
programs threw the poor out of
their homes, diminished the
amount of low-income housing,
and fattened the bankers, building
contractors, and real estate
interests, an excellent illustration
has just appeared in the story of
the West Philadelphia federal
office building constructed by
close friends of Senator Hugh
Scott.
The Feb. 18 New York Times
speaks of "the ability of friends
and associates of . . . Scott,
Republican of Pennsylvania, the
Senate minority floor leader, to
win for a real estate developer a
Federal contract worth up to $78
million even though the bid was
higher than the others and did
not, according to a report of the
General Accounting Office, meet
legal requirements."
According to the Times, the
real estate developer has been a
friend of Scott for 25 years and
was a contributor to his 1970
re-election campaign. The legal
negotiations were handled by a
lawyer who is the developer's
nephew, is a member of Scott's
law firm, and was treasurer of The

Friends of Hugh Scott (an
election finance group). The two
government bureaucrats most
directly responsible for awarding
the contract were also proteges of
Scott.
College Housing Loans
The case of the federal college
housing loan program provides a
third example of who is doing
something to whom through the
channels of the Subsidy State.
Commenting upon a 1972
study of college housing,
economist Yale Brozen writes:
"The average family income of
college students living away from
home exceeds median family
income in the United States by a
considerable margin . . . .
Professor [John J.] Agria finds
that the colleges whose
enrollments include comparatively
large numbers of low income
students, such as junior colleges,
receive no subsidy, since normally
these colleges do not provide
housing. Much if not most of the
subsidy provided under the
college housing program goes to
students from above the median
income families. But the less
affluent families share the tax
burden which provides the
subsidy."
Professor Brozen goes on to
argue: "It would seem appropriate
that college students themselves
bear the cost of their education,
whether they come from low or
high income families. ... Since
the college student's investment in
his education produces a
handsome return—an income 70
percent higher than that of a high
school graduate—it hardly seems
necessary to give him any part of
the investment."
