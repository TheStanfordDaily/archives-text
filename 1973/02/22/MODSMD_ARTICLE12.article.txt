# We Can Do Better
## Move Out Of Beutelsbach 
### 
Peter Shaffer

The letter (Daily, Feb. 14)
written in favor of keeping the
Germany campus in Beutelsbaeh
was interesting. One could not
disagree with the contention that
the program there has been well
developed considering the
resources of the locality. I speak
in particular of the family
program, which offers students
the really valuable personal
experience among Europeans that
any program should include.
However, the question that
comes to mind is whether or not
we can do better. There is no
reason to believe that by moving
to a large German city (Munich,
perhaps, or Cologne) Stanford
would have to abandon a
workable family program. I
understand the 'urban' campus in
Vienna now offers a very good
urban family program.
Admittedly, the establishment
of 'family ties' in Munich or
elsewhere would take a great deal
of work and patience. However,
when one looks at all the really
important advantages that
studying in a major European
cultural center offers, the
temporary problems of moving
begin to seem worth bearing.
Cultural Base Shifted
I appreciate somewhat the
argument put forth that much of
German culture historically has its
roots in the small village. This,
undoubtedly, can be said to be

true of most industrialized
nations, including the United
States.
The Germany of today,
however, and even the Germany
of this century (as with America)
has shifted its base of culture and
society significantly to the cities.
We might ask ourselves (to
change our perspective) whether,
if we were Europeans establishing
an American campus, we would
choose to locate in San Francisco
or Gilroy. Perhaps in the rural
environment we might better
appreciate the world of Steinbeck,
but what can we say is more
important? An involving
experience in an active, vital
center, I would think.
Furthermore, the present
campus is not even located in the
town of Beutelsbach, but rather
on top of a nearby hill. How
many students really go into
Beutelsbach more than two or
three times a week? How many
students take advantage of the
great cultural offerings of
Stuttgart more than once a
month? How many students
spend their weekends in
Beutelsbach instead of cruising off
to Italy or Holland?
Admittedly, we cannot change
students. We can change the
environment in which they study,
and give them real opportunities.
You simply give up the idyllic
existence in the green

countryside, give up the volleyball
courts and the apple trees, and
instead give students a chance to
involve themselves more fully in
all aspects of a foreign culture,
give them great cultural events
(nearby, so that they will be taken
advantage of, instead of being a
minor expedition to get to), the
resources of great local
Universities and institutions and
local students close at hand and
easily accessable, a richness and
blend of history and society that
can only be found in a major
center.
Rural Experience
This kind of involvement
cannot be achieved in an isolated
American compound on top of
some esthetically pleasing hill.
This is not to say that the mere
existence of an urban
environment will insure greater
learning and involvement. Any
urban program must be well
planned and organized,
incorporating many of the ideas
of the Merryman Commission,
and designed to insure meaningful
contact and appreciation of the
urban situation.
Does this mean that we must
forget the rural experience? I
don't think so. A campus in
Munich could conceivably
maintain a relationship with the
town of Beutelsbach or with other
rural communities scattered over

southern Germany, where
students could spend long
weekends (or longer) with families
in such towns. I understand
something along these lines have
been incorporated into the
Austria program.
