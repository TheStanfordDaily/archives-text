Dangers of Research
Editor:
The Stanford Artificial
Intelligence Laboratory, described
by Larry Fleece (Daily, Feb. 20),
is certainly a fascinating place,
and the possible products of the
work conducted there do tantalize
the imagination.
But with every exciting new
technological innovation, I'm
concerned that the gung-ho,
"can-implies-ought" attitude of
the developers may cause them to
overlook the social implications of
their pet project. And such
oversights are usually sugar-coated
by ideal intentions. The statement
by Lester Earnest, executive
director of the Artificial
Intelligence Laboratory, is a case
in point:
"Our concern is in the
improvement of the quality of
human life. One need only look
back at what has happened in the
past as a result of mechanization;
shorter hours, longer vacations,
less drudgery, more humane
working conditions. There is no
point in forcing men to do jobs
that machines can do more easily,
just because those men need a
job."
What else has mechanization
done for us? It has destroyed the
artisan, inundated our society
with mass-produced look-alike
devices that we don't need,
accelerated the pace of living,
promoted "efficiency" as an
ultimate value, thus impairing the
depth of human relationships, and
contributed to the psychopathic
condition of our over-hurried,
over-worried society.
The leisure time created by
machines is a major problem in
itself.
Finally, while no one should be
forced to do a job that a machine
can do more easily, no one should
ever be forced to not do a job that
is a creative experience because a
machine can do it more easily and
economically.

Special ASSU Budget
Editor:
Over the last two years groups
that have wanted money from the
student body have requested one
dollar for one or more quarters (in
a special referendum). This
represents $10,000 at one time,
and hence only groups with a
large need have attempted to get
special fee assessments passed. But
the majority of groups do not
need $10,000. Most need $300,
$500, or maybe $1,000; but since
the abolition of the Program Fee
two years ago, most have had to
reduce their programs and seek
funds elsewhere.
This year the ASSU Senate is
putting together a budget to
benefit these groups. It includes
all kinds of student
activitiesâ€”from common interest
groups that want to have a series
of speakers or put on a
convocation to theatrical groups
that need subsidies to put on
shows. Also included are all
divisional associations such as law
students, history students,
engineering students, etc. These
groups used to get money from
the division association fund,
which has been eliminated, so the
groups are included in the
program fee.
The ASSU Senate Finance
Committee is accepting budgets
for consideration until Friday,
February 23. They will put
together a master budget which
will be approved by the Senate
and then submitted to the student
body for approval in the second
week of Spring Quarter. Both the
individual budget allocation for
each group and the total amount
of the fee assessment per student
will be on the ballot, so that
students will know exactly where
their money is going in advance.
