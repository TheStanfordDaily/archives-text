# Nureyev Augments Canadian Ballet
## 
### RUST EDDIE 
History has decreed "The
Sleeping Beauty" to have been
Petipa's greatest ballet, as it was
Tchaikovsky's. To date, it is
Nureyev's.
By re-awakening after thirteen
years, his first role following his
defection from the Kirov,
Nureyev pays homage to
Tchaikovsky, Petipa, and the
Marquis de Cuevas, the first
western empresario to employ
Nureyev.
Nureyev starred in 1960 as
Prince Florimund in the Marquis'
"La Belle au Bois Dormant," the
first full-length "Beauty"
produced in Paris. Like
Diaghilev's, "Sleeping Princess,"
designed by Bakst and presented
in London in 1921, de Cuevas'
"Beauty," designed by Raymunde
de Larrain and choreographed by
Nyinska and Sir Robert
Helpmann, is based on Petipa's
1890 Maryinsky (Kirov)
production.
Nureyev starred again as Prince
Florimund in the 1966
production he mounted at La
Scala, "La Bella Addormentata,"
with sets by Nickolas Georgiadis.
Like all other productions of
"Beauty," this one was based on
Petipa's.
Remounted with new sets by
Georgiadis for the National Ballet
of Canada, Nureyev's production
of "The Sleeping Beauty" could
be seen on television during the
Christmas holidays, or again last
week at the San Francisco Opera
House.
Simple Story
The story is simple: Princess
Aurora pricks her finger on her
sixteenth birthday and falls asleep
for one hundred years to be
awakened by a prince's kiss. The
ballet is divided into three parts:
The Christening and Aurora's
sixteenth birthday party at which
Catalabutte, the Master of
Ceremonies' oversight in
neglecting to invite the Fairy
Carabosse prompts the Lilac Fairy
to mitigate Carabosse's curse that
one day the princess will prick her
finger with a spindle and die; the
Hunt one hundred years later,
during which Prince Florimund
has a vision of Aurora and is lead
by the Lilac Fairy to where she

lies sleeping and awakens her with
a kiss; and the Wedding of
Florimund and Aurora.
Nureyev's "Beauty," after
Petipa's, is drawn from Perrault's
"Mother Goose Tales" (1697),
primarily "The Fairies," though
conflated by Vsevolozhsky,
director of the Imperial Theatres
under the Czar Alexander 111,
with elements of "The Sleeping
Beauty," "Little Red Riding
Hood," "Bluebeard,"
"Puss-in-Boots," "Cinderella,"
"Ruckey with the Tuft (in
another version: 'Beauty and the
Beast')," "Hop o' My Thumb,"
"Donkey-skin (in the 'Cinderella'
genre)," "The Ridiculous Wishes"
and "Patient Griselda."
"Sleeping Beauty" is taken
from a very ancient concept:
Spring (a new Dawn), awakened
by the kiss of the Sun. In his best
ballet score, Opus 66a, as Nureyev
said on television, Tchaikovsky
expressed in "Beauty," as in all
his work, a theme of the struggle
between light and darkness, good
and evil, and the Triumph of life
over death. Conductor Bowman's
highly professional orchestrations
Tuesday evening were so
memorable as to be all but
uncritici zable.
Heavy Sets
Because Nureyev's new
production of "Sleeping Beauty"
featuring his additional
choreography requires such heavy
sets, the ballet was performed
only at the Opera House during
Nureyev's thirteen Bay-Area
appearances. Dwarfing
performers, Georgiadis' opulent
washed-gold sets and deer trophy
look as if they were inspired
alternatively by Louis XlV's court
or Chanel's living room.
Nureyev's vermeil blueprint for
the ballet is secondary, however,
to his Prince. In what was
formerly Aurora Ballet (it had
previously been her christening,
her birthday party, her
awakening, her wedding), Prince
Florimund eclipses Princess
Aurora. Nureyev has changed the
Prince; his Florimund has an
active part in the dance and is an
intrinsic character in the ballet.
Nureyev's choreography for
the Prince is, of course, the most
arresting feature of his "Beauty."

Nureyev, who abhors straight
lines, has set the ballet in
diagonals, giving an oblique
setting to the corps and
prominence to himself. Contrary
to the Kirov's version, Nureyev's
Prince does not lift Aurora in the
Vision.
Terre-A-Terre
In fact, this Prince never lifts
Aurora, other than in a little
preparatory hitch in the Grand
Adagio. Justly remaining largely
"terre-a-terre" himself in his own
production, Nureyev none the less
refrains from subordinating
himself to his Aurora.
Nureyev also makes fairly short
work of the Awakening. Executed

in the dark with a spotlight
chasing him as he dashes here and
there seeking the sleeping beauty,
Nureyev gives her a very discreet
kiss, just like he might drop one
more inconsequental Valentine in
the mailbox. Nureyev's presence is
Canada's gain, though, and his
production is golden.
Note: Principals who alternated in
the San Francisco productions of
"The Sleeping Beauty" were Celia
Franca and Victoria Bertram as
Carabosse, Kris tine Soleri as the
Lilac Fairy, Veronica Tennant,
* T anessa Harwood and Karen Kain
as Princess Aurora, Karen Kain,
Mary Jago and Nadia Potts as
Princess Florine.

expressed in "Beauty," as in all
his work, a theme of the struggle
between light and darkness, good
and evil, and the Triumph of life
over death. Conductor Bowman's
highly professional orchestrations
Tuesday evening were so
memorable as to be all but
uncritici zable.
Heavy Sets
Because Nureyev's new
production of "Sleeping Beauty"
featuring his additional
choreography requires such heavy
sets, the ballet was performed
only at the Opera House during
Nureyev's thirteen Bay-Area
appearances. Dwarfing
performers, Georgiadis' opulent
washed-gold sets and deer trophy
look as if they were inspired
alternatively by Louis XlV's court
or Chanel's living room.
Nureyev's vermeil blueprint for
the ballet is secondary, however,
to his Prince. In what was
formerly Aurora Ballet (it had
previously been her christening,
her birthday party, her
awakening, her wedding), Prince
Florimund eclipses Princess
Aurora. Nureyev has changed the
Prince; his Florimund has an
active part in the dance and is an
intrinsic character in the ballet.
Nureyev's choreography for
the Prince is, of course, the most
arresting feature of his "Beauty."

Nureyev, who abhors straight
lines, has set the ballet in
diagonals, giving an oblique
setting to the corps and
prominence to himself. Contrary
to the Kirov's version, Nureyev's
Prince does not lift Aurora in the
Vision.
Terre-A-Terre
In fact, this Prince never lifts
Aurora, other than in a little
preparatory hitch in the Grand
Adagio. Justly remaining largely
"terre-a-terre" himself in his own
production, Nureyev none the less
refrains from subordinating
himself to his Aurora.
Nureyev also makes fairly short
work of the Awakening. Executed

in the dark with a spotlight
chasing him as he dashes here and
there seeking the sleeping beauty,
Nureyev gives her a very discreet
kiss, just like he might drop one
more inconsequental Valentine in
the mailbox. Nureyev's presence is
Canada's gain, though, and his
production is golden.
Note: Principals who alternated in
the San Francisco productions of
"The Sleeping Beauty" were Celia
Franca and Victoria Bertram as
Carabosse, Kris tine Soleri as the
Lilac Fairy, Veronica Tennant,
* T anessa Harwood and Karen Kain
as Princess Aurora, Karen Kain,
Mary Jago and Nadia Potts as
Princess Florine.
History has decreed "The
Sleeping Beauty" to have been
Petipa's greatest ballet, as it was
Tchaikovsky's. To date, it is
Nureyev's.
By re-awakening after thirteen
years, his first role following his
defection from the Kirov,
Nureyev pays homage to
Tchaikovsky, Petipa, and the
Marquis de Cuevas, the first
western empresario to employ
Nureyev.
Nureyev starred in 1960 as
Prince Florimund in the Marquis'
"La Belle au Bois Dormant," the
first full-length "Beauty"
produced in Paris. Like
Diaghilev's, "Sleeping Princess,"
designed by Bakst and presented
in London in 1921, de Cuevas'
"Beauty," designed by Raymunde
de Larrain and choreographed by
Nyinska and Sir Robert
Helpmann, is based on Petipa's
1890 Maryinsky (Kirov)
production.
Nureyev starred again as Prince
Florimund in the 1966
production he mounted at La
Scala, "La Bella Addormentata,"
with sets by Nickolas Georgiadis.
Like all other productions of
"Beauty," this one was based on
Petipa's.
Remounted with new sets by
Georgiadis for the National Ballet
of Canada, Nureyev's production
of "The Sleeping Beauty" could
be seen on television during the
Christmas holidays, or again last
week at the San Francisco Opera
House.
Simple Story
The story is simple: Princess
Aurora pricks her finger on her
sixteenth birthday and falls asleep
for one hundred years to be
awakened by a prince's kiss. The
ballet is divided into three parts:
The Christening and Aurora's
sixteenth birthday party at which
Catalabutte, the Master of
Ceremonies' oversight in
neglecting to invite the Fairy
Carabosse prompts the Lilac Fairy
to mitigate Carabosse's curse that
one day the princess will prick her
finger with a spindle and die; the
Hunt one hundred years later,
during which Prince Florimund
has a vision of Aurora and is lead
by the Lilac Fairy to where she

lies sleeping and awakens her with
a kiss; and the Wedding of
Florimund and Aurora.
Nureyev's "Beauty," after
Petipa's, is drawn from Perrault's
"Mother Goose Tales" (1697),
primarily "The Fairies," though
conflated by Vsevolozhsky,
director of the Imperial Theatres
under the Czar Alexander 111,
with elements of "The Sleeping
Beauty," "Little Red Riding
Hood," "Bluebeard,"
"Puss-in-Boots," "Cinderella,"
"Ruckey with the Tuft (in
another version: 'Beauty and the
Beast')," "Hop o' My Thumb,"
"Donkey-skin (in the 'Cinderella'
genre)," "The Ridiculous Wishes"
and "Patient Griselda."
"Sleeping Beauty" is taken
from a very ancient concept:
Spring (a new Dawn), awakened
by the kiss of the Sun. In his best

Diaghilev's, "Sleeping Princess,"
designed by Bakst and presented
in London in 1921, de Cuevas'
"Beauty," designed by Raymunde
de Larrain and choreographed by
Nyinska and Sir Robert
Helpmann, is based on Petipa's
1890 Maryinsky (Kirov)
production.
Nureyev starred again as Prince
Florimund in the 1966
production he mounted at La
Scala, "La Bella Addormentata,"
with sets by Nickolas Georgiadis.
Like all other productions of
"Beauty," this one was based on
Petipa's.
Remounted with new sets by
Georgiadis for the National Ballet
of Canada, Nureyev's production
of "The Sleeping Beauty" could
be seen on television during the
Christmas holidays, or again last
week at the San Francisco Opera
House.
Simple Story
The story is simple: Princess
Aurora pricks her finger on her
sixteenth birthday and falls asleep
for one hundred years to be
awakened by a prince's kiss. The
ballet is divided into three parts:
The Christening and Aurora's
sixteenth birthday party at which
Catalabutte, the Master of
Ceremonies' oversight in
neglecting to invite the Fairy
Carabosse prompts the Lilac Fairy
to mitigate Carabosse's curse that
one day the princess will prick her
finger with a spindle and die; the
Hunt one hundred years later,
during which Prince Florimund
has a vision of Aurora and is lead
by the Lilac Fairy to where she

lies sleeping and awakens her with
a kiss; and the Wedding of
Florimund and Aurora.
Nureyev's "Beauty," after
Petipa's, is drawn from Perrault's
"Mother Goose Tales" (1697),
primarily "The Fairies," though
conflated by Vsevolozhsky,
director of the Imperial Theatres
under the Czar Alexander 111,
with elements of "The Sleeping
Beauty," "Little Red Riding
Hood," "Bluebeard,"
"Puss-in-Boots," "Cinderella,"
"Ruckey with the Tuft (in
another version: 'Beauty and the
Beast')," "Hop o' My Thumb,"
"Donkey-skin (in the 'Cinderella'
genre)," "The Ridiculous Wishes"
and "Patient Griselda."
"Sleeping Beauty" is taken
from a very ancient concept:
Spring (a new Dawn), awakened
by the kiss of the Sun. In his best
ballet score, Opus 66a, as Nureyev
said on television, Tchaikovsky
expressed in "Beauty," as in all
his work, a theme of the struggle
between light and darkness, good
and evil, and the Triumph of life
over death. Conductor Bowman's
highly professional orchestrations
Tuesday evening were so
memorable as to be all but
uncritici zable.
Heavy Sets
Because Nureyev's new
production of "Sleeping Beauty"
featuring his additional
choreography requires such heavy
sets, the ballet was performed
only at the Opera House during
Nureyev's thirteen Bay-Area
appearances. Dwarfing
performers, Georgiadis' opulent
washed-gold sets and deer trophy
look as if they were inspired
alternatively by Louis XlV's court
or Chanel's living room.
Nureyev's vermeil blueprint for
the ballet is secondary, however,
to his Prince. In what was
formerly Aurora Ballet (it had
previously been her christening,
her birthday party, her
awakening, her wedding), Prince
Florimund eclipses Princess
Aurora. Nureyev has changed the
Prince; his Florimund has an
active part in the dance and is an
intrinsic character in the ballet.
Nureyev's choreography for
the Prince is, of course, the most
arresting feature of his "Beauty."

Nureyev, who abhors straight
lines, has set the ballet in
diagonals, giving an oblique
setting to the corps and
prominence to himself. Contrary
to the Kirov's version, Nureyev's
Prince does not lift Aurora in the
Vision.
Terre-A-Terre
In fact, this Prince never lifts
Aurora, other than in a little
preparatory hitch in the Grand
Adagio. Justly remaining largely
"terre-a-terre" himself in his own
production, Nureyev none the less
refrains from subordinating
himself to his Aurora.
Nureyev also makes fairly short
work of the Awakening. Executed

in the dark with a spotlight
chasing him as he dashes here and
there seeking the sleeping beauty,
Nureyev gives her a very discreet
kiss, just like he might drop one
more inconsequental Valentine in
the mailbox. Nureyev's presence is
Canada's gain, though, and his
production is golden.
Note: Principals who alternated in
the San Francisco productions of
"The Sleeping Beauty" were Celia
Franca and Victoria Bertram as
Carabosse, Kris tine Soleri as the
Lilac Fairy, Veronica Tennant,
* T anessa Harwood and Karen Kain
as Princess Aurora, Karen Kain,
Mary Jago and Nadia Potts as
Princess Florine.
History has decreed "The
Sleeping Beauty" to have been
Petipa's greatest ballet, as it was
Tchaikovsky's. To date, it is
Nureyev's.
By re-awakening after thirteen
years, his first role following his
defection from the Kirov,
Nureyev pays homage to
Tchaikovsky, Petipa, and the
Marquis de Cuevas, the first
western empresario to employ
Nureyev.
Nureyev starred in 1960 as
Prince Florimund in the Marquis'
"La Belle au Bois Dormant," the
first full-length "Beauty"
produced in Paris. Like
Diaghilev's, "Sleeping Princess,"
designed by Bakst and presented
in London in 1921, de Cuevas'
"Beauty," designed by Raymunde
de Larrain and choreographed by
Nyinska and Sir Robert
Helpmann, is based on Petipa's
