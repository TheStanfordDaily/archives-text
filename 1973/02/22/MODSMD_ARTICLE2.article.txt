# Lab Seeks New Computer Uses
## Home Terminal Grant Requested 
### LARRY FLEECE (Last in a Series) 
Prof. John McCarthy, director of
the Stanford Artificial Intelligence
(AI) Laboratory, submitted a proposal
to the National Science Foundation
(NSF) last week requesting a grant of
$622,709 to enable the AI Laboratory
to "carry out research aimed at the
development of home computer
terminals."
If the proposal is approved and

funded by the NSF, work on the
research project would begin July 1,
1973, and would run for three years.
Contained in the proposal is a
detailed analysis of the potential
strengths of a home computer system,
as well as the obstacles toward its
realization which must be overcome.
The proposal suggests a set of possible
applications of the home terminal, and
raises a number of questions which
must be answered by further research.

Ideally, an effective home
computer terminal system will provide
wide public access to a powerful
means of communication. The
proposal indicates that "anyone can
create a file and make it publicly
available," and McCarthy terms this
public origination of programming
"fundamentally desirable."
Four Uses Of Grant
If the proposal is approved, the AI
Laboratory will:
—Acquire a number of remote
display terminals and attach them to
the Laboratory's time-sharing system.
Some terminals will be placed in users'
homes, and some will be placed in
public places on the Stanford campus.
—Develop a package of applications
and place them in the computer
system.
—Study the problems involved in
developing these highly interactive
programs.
—Study the problem of making the
application programs usable in a
uniform and easily learnable way.
Instant News Service
The first application of a home
terminal which the proposal suggests is
access to an up-to-date news service.
Martin Frost, a graduate student at the
AI Laboratory, has successfully
programmed a news service based on
the Associated Press news wire into
the computer system. As an example,
a user may enter the keyword 'Nixon'
into the terminal, and receive all the
day's stories concerning Nixon.
Another suggested application is
simply reading. The computer file
could contain a veritable library of
literature to be made available to the
user.
A third application could be an
updated local information system,
containing more information than the
local newspapers.
Fourth, connection to institutional
computer systems would be possible.
A user could make airline reservations
or buy theater tickets from his home.
Many Other Applications

a system already in use in many
schools, could easily be transplanted
into the home system. Beyond this,
countless other applications are
possible: amusements and games, the
best route for driving to a given
address, a want-ad service,
computerized editing of written copy,
mathematical calculation, etc.
Presently, there are a number of
large computer time-sharing service
bureaus across the nation, which could
be linked into a large network of
competitive programmers for home
service.
The largest computer service bureau
in the Bay Area, and one of the largest
in the world, is Tym-Share, located in
Sunnyvale.
As the NSF proposal indicates,
computer technology has advanced far
enough to provide home terminal
service. The major obstacle to the
installation of a home terminal system
is the high cost to the user.

"The cost of the system will
continue to decrease, along with the
steady decrease in the cost of
electronics," said McCarthy. "The
question is when the cost figure will
reach a level that people think can be
justified by the usefulness of the
system."
McCarthy said that in five years, a
home terminal system would cost
about $75 a month per user for "the
whole works"; that is, for the use of
both machinery and computer time in
the time-sharing system.
McCarthy stressed that there is a
two-level structure of the home
terminal cost, since ownership of the
computer system is distinct from
ownership of each program on the
computer file. When a user calls on
any program in the computer index,
he is assessed a fee by the particular
program owner, which is tallied by the
computer system and put on the user's
bill.
The nature of the home terminal

itself could be anything from a simple
keyboard and linear display terminal
without sound or animation to a
television-like display screen
incorporating sound, color, and
animation, depending on the cost the
user is willing to pay.
According to McCarthy, the AI
Laboratory's experimental terminals
will be more expensive models, in
order to most effectively test the
technological potential of the system.
But he anticipates the hardware in the
earlier home systems to be simpler and
less expensive.
One problem requiring research is
the development of a simpler
computer language, one which the
common user can master in order to
operate his terminal.
"I don't doubt that children will be
able to operate the terminal
keyboard," McCarthy said. "Some
initial knowledge will be required, but
not a great deal."
