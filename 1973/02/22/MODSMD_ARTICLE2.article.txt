# Lab Seeks New Computer Uses
## Home Terminal Grant Requested 
### LARRY FLEECE (Last in a Series) 
Prof. John McCarthy, director of
the Stanford Artificial Intelligence
(AI) Laboratory, submitted a proposal
to the National Science Foundation
(NSF) last week requesting a grant of
$622,709 to enable the AI Laboratory
to "carry out research aimed at the
development of home computer
terminals."
If the proposal is approved and

funded by the NSF, work on the
research project would begin July 1,
1973, and would run for three years.
Contained in the proposal is a
detailed analysis of the potential
strengths of a home computer system,
as well as the obstacles toward its
realization which must be overcome.
The proposal suggests a set of possible
applications of the home terminal, and
raises a number of questions which
must be answered by further research.

Ideally, an effective home
computer terminal system will provide
wide public access to a powerful
means of communication. The
proposal indicates that "anyone can
create a file and make it publicly
available," and McCarthy terms this
public origination of programming
"fundamentally desirable."
Four Uses Of Grant
If the proposal is approved, the AI
Laboratory will:
—Acquire a number of remote
display terminals and attach them to
the Laboratory's time-sharing system.
Some terminals will be placed in users'
homes, and some will be placed in
public places on the Stanford campus.
—Develop a package of applications
and place them in the computer
system.
—Study the problems involved in
developing these highly interactive
programs.
—Study the problem of making the
application programs usable in a
uniform and easily learnable way.
Instant News Service
The first application of a home
terminal which the proposal suggests is
access to an up-to-date news service.
Martin Frost, a graduate student at the
AI Laboratory, has successfully
programmed a news service based on
the Associated Press news wire into
the computer system. As an example,
a user may enter the keyword 'Nixon'
into the terminal, and receive all the
day's stories concerning Nixon.
Another suggested application is
simply reading. The computer file
could contain a veritable library of
literature to be made available to the
user.
A third application could be an
updated local information system,
containing more information than the
local newspapers.
Fourth, connection to institutional
computer systems would be possible.
A user could make airline reservations
or buy theater tickets from his home.

NEW TEN-SPEED? — No, not really. Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory
developed this computer-programmed mobile vehicle for future space
exploration. Designed to operate without a human passenger, the vehicle is
equipped with a TV camera, radio antenna and four-wheel electric drive.
