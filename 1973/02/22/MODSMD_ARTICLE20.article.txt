# Play Ball!
## Stanford 6-USF 3 
### 
Although a possible player strike may once again delay
the start of major league spring training, Stanford's baseball
season is well underway. On Monday Coach Ray Young's
Cards used three home runs and solid pitching by Al Arthur,
Ken Grolle, and Nick Peterson to record a 6-3 victory over
USF at Sunken Diamond.
Arthur, Glen Johnson, and Mickey Aguirre belted the
home runs. Arthur was also credited with the victory,
although Grolle was the most impressive Card hurler,
fanning five in three hitless innings.

congratulated after his home run, Bob Hampton connecting
for a single to left field, and an unidentified Cardinal
enjoying a slight breeze caused by an inside pitch.
Yesterday Stanford lost to University of Pacific 5-2 at
Sunken Diamond. Hampton's home run was the only
offensive highlight for the Cards, whose record dropped to
5-2 (7-2 if you include two victories over the Philadelphia
Rookies which are not counted by the NCAA).
