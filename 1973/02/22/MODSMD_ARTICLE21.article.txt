LOS ANGELES — A rolling earthquake shook the
Southern California coast yesterday morning, cracking
plaster, shattering windows, starting several fires and
inflicting some major property damage.
The structural damage, mainly to older buildings, was
heaviest in Oxnard, a coastal city of 78,000 persons, 50
miles northwest of Los Angeles. Estimates by the state
Office of Emergency Preparedness placed damage there at
up to $1 million, mostly in cracked walls, broken
windows and collapsed roofs.
Several minor injuries were reported.
California Institute of Technology seismologists
measured the intensity of the quake at roughly 5.75 on
the Richter scale and said it was centered in the ocean off
Pt. Mugu, near Oxnard.
Jolting sleeping residents at 6:46 a.m. and lasting about
20 seconds, the quake recalled the 6.5 temblor of Feb. 9,
1971, in which 64 persons died. That quake, centered in
the San Fernando Valley north of here, struck at 6:01
a.m.
Israelis Down Arab Airliner
TEL AVIV — Israeli warplanes fired on a Libyan jetliner
that refused to heed warnings yesterday and forced it to
crash-land on the occupied Sinai Desert, the military
command reported.
The official casualty toll was given as at least 74
persons dead and nine seriously injured.
The command said the airline pilot acknowledged
repeated warnings that he was violating Israeli-held
territory, but did not comply. The government said the
plane had intruded into a "highly-sensitive military area"
and "behaved in a way thai rroused suspicion and concern
regarding its intentions."
Libyan radio said the plane was brought down in "an
aggressive attack by the Zionist enemy," and Cairo radio
vowed that Israel will "pay dearly at the hand of the
Arabs for this crime."
President Houari Boumedienne of Algeria called the
incident "... a violation of the most elementary human
principles."
Premier Golda Meir expressed the Israeli government's
"deep sorrow at the loss of life resulting from the Libyan
crash in Sinai and regrets that the Libyan pilot did not
heed the repeated warnings which were given him in
accordance with international procedures."
Laotian Ceasefire Signed
VIENTIANE, Laos — The divided Laotians signed
yesterday a cease-fire designed to end a decade of sporadic
warfare fought with U.S. and North Vietnamese help
along the fringes of the Vietnam conflict next door.
The cease-fire called for fighting to end at noon
Thursday in Laos, which was 9 p.m. PST last night. It gave
a strengthened political hand to the Communist-led Pathet
Lao rebels who have fought for years to take over the
small Indochinese kingdom.
Its signing meant that in principle Cambodia remains
the only country still fighting on the Indochinese
peninsula which has known off-and-on conflict since
World War 11.
The agreement provided for withdrawal of all foreign
troops, release of war prisoners within 90 days and an end
to U.S. bombing against the Pathet Lao and their
estimated 65,000 North Vietnamese allies in the country.
It bars introduction of other foreign troops and arms

and calls for a government of national unity to be set up
within 30 days.
Woman Admits 'Papers' Tie-In
LOS ANGELES — Anthony Russo's former girlfriend, an
unindicted coconspirator in the Pentagon Papers trial,
testified reluctantly yesterday that she helped Russo and
Daniel Ellsberg copy top-secret documents in 1969.
Lynda Sinay Resnick, 30, said Ellsberg's teen-aged son
Robert also helped, cutting "top secret" markings off the
copied documents.
Handed a volume of the Pentagon Papers, Mrs. Resnick
said it resembled the documents with "baby blue covers"
which were reproduced on her copying machine.
The short, brown-haired Mrs. Resnick told how the
Papers were copied during the nights of 10 to 18 days,
confirmed that police arrived during one of the copying
sessions after someone accidentally triggered a silent
burglar alarm. She said that Ellsberg told her not to read
the top-secret papers —presumably the Pentagon's study
of the Vietnam war.
Sino-U.S. Communique Expected
WASHINGTON — The United States and Communist
China will issue a joint communique today that is
expected to report new strides in relations between the
two nations.
The communique is the outgrowth of Henry A.
Kissinger's lengthy talks with Chinese leaders in Peking,
including Chairman Mao Tse-tung.
The White House said it will be made public in Peking
and Washington at 8 a.m. PST today.
Kissinger, who has reported to Nixon since his return
from Asia Tuesday, will hold a news conference at the
White House to discuss the communique and details of his
visit to both Peking and Hanoi.
Kissinger's talks in Hanoi resulted in establishment of a
joint economic commission to consider postwar
reconstruction aid for North Vietnam.
While the White House has declined to give any details
on the forthcoming China communique, it is expected to
provide for improved trade relations, possibly the
establishment of trade missions in the two countries.
U.S. Asks POW Return Speedup
SAIGON — The United States asked the Communists
yesterday to free the next group of American prisoners as
soon as possible and to move its field teams to subregional
truce sites "to dampen major hostilities."
At a meeting of chief delegates of the United States,
North and South Vietnam, and the Viet Cong to the Joint
Military Commission, the United States expressed concern
that the Communist side is not moving its teams into the
field. The United States and South Vietnam teams are at
24 of the 26 sites, North Vietnam at five and the Viet
Cong at none.
Despite this, teams of the International Commission of
Control and Supervision began their move to 14 of the
subregional sites yesterday.
Today's Weather
Partly cloudy through today with slight chance of a
shower late today. Mostly fair tonight and tomorrow but
occasional high cloudiness. Continued mild temperatures.
Low nights in mid 40s to mid 50s. High today and

Laotian Ceasefire Signed
VIENTIANE, Laos — The divided Laotians signed
yesterday a cease-fire designed to end a decade of sporadic
warfare fought with U.S. and North Vietnamese help
along the fringes of the Vietnam conflict next door.
The cease-fire called for fighting to end at noon
Thursday in Laos, which was 9 p.m. PST last night. It gave
a strengthened political hand to the Communist-led Pathet
Lao rebels who have fought for years to take over the
small Indochinese kingdom.
Its signing meant that in principle Cambodia remains
the only country still fighting on the Indochinese
peninsula which has known off-and-on conflict since
World War 11.
The agreement provided for withdrawal of all foreign
troops, release of war prisoners within 90 days and an end
to U.S. bombing against the Pathet Lao and their
estimated 65,000 North Vietnamese allies in the country.
It bars introduction of other foreign troops and arms

and calls for a government of national unity to be set up
within 30 days.
Woman Admits 'Papers' Tie-In
LOS ANGELES — Anthony Russo's former girlfriend, an
unindicted coconspirator in the Pentagon Papers trial,
testified reluctantly yesterday that she helped Russo and
Daniel Ellsberg copy top-secret documents in 1969.
Lynda Sinay Resnick, 30, said Ellsberg's teen-aged son
Robert also helped, cutting "top secret" markings off the
copied documents.
Handed a volume of the Pentagon Papers, Mrs. Resnick
said it resembled the documents with "baby blue covers"
which were reproduced on her copying machine.
The short, brown-haired Mrs. Resnick told how the
Papers were copied during the nights of 10 to 18 days,
confirmed that police arrived during one of the copying
sessions after someone accidentally triggered a silent
burglar alarm. She said that Ellsberg told her not to read
the top-secret papers —presumably the Pentagon's study
of the Vietnam war.
Sino-U.S. Communique Expected
WASHINGTON — The United States and Communist
China will issue a joint communique today that is
expected to report new strides in relations between the
two nations.
The communique is the outgrowth of Henry A.
Kissinger's lengthy talks with Chinese leaders in Peking,
including Chairman Mao Tse-tung.
The White House said it will be made public in Peking
and Washington at 8 a.m. PST today.
Kissinger, who has reported to Nixon since his return
from Asia Tuesday, will hold a news conference at the
White House to discuss the communique and details of his
visit to both Peking and Hanoi.
Kissinger's talks in Hanoi resulted in establishment of a
joint economic commission to consider postwar
reconstruction aid for North Vietnam.
While the White House has declined to give any details
on the forthcoming China communique, it is expected to
provide for improved trade relations, possibly the
establishment of trade missions in the two countries.
U.S. Asks POW Return Speedup
SAIGON — The United States asked the Communists
yesterday to free the next group of American prisoners as
soon as possible and to move its field teams to subregional
truce sites "to dampen major hostilities."
At a meeting of chief delegates of the United States,
North and South Vietnam, and the Viet Cong to the Joint
Military Commission, the United States expressed concern
that the Communist side is not moving its teams into the
field. The United States and South Vietnam teams are at
24 of the 26 sites, North Vietnam at five and the Viet
Cong at none.
Despite this, teams of the International Commission of
Control and Supervision began their move to 14 of the
subregional sites yesterday.

Earthquake.Hits §. California
LOS ANGELES — A rolling earthquake shook the
Southern California coast yesterday morning, cracking
plaster, shattering windows, starting several fires and
inflicting some major property damage.
The structural damage, mainly to older buildings, was
heaviest in Oxnard, a coastal city of 78,000 persons, 50
miles northwest of Los Angeles. Estimates by the state
Office of Emergency Preparedness placed damage there at
up to $1 million, mostly in cracked walls, broken
windows and collapsed roofs.
Several minor injuries were reported.
California Institute of Technology seismologists
measured the intensity of the quake at roughly 5.75 on
the Richter scale and said it was centered in the ocean off
Pt. Mugu, near Oxnard.
Jolting sleeping residents at 6:46 a.m. and lasting about
20 seconds, the quake recalled the 6.5 temblor of Feb. 9,
1971, in which 64 persons died. That quake, centered in
the San Fernando Valley north of here, struck at 6:01
a.m.
Israelis Down Arab Airliner
TEL AVIV — Israeli warplanes fired on a Libyan jetliner
that refused to heed warnings yesterday and forced it to
crash-land on the occupied Sinai Desert, the military
command reported.
The official casualty toll was given as at least 74
persons dead and nine seriously injured.
The command said the airline pilot acknowledged
repeated warnings that he was violating Israeli-held
territory, but did not comply. The government said the
plane had intruded into a "highly-sensitive military area"
and "behaved in a way thai rroused suspicion and concern
regarding its intentions."
Libyan radio said the plane was brought down in "an
aggressive attack by the Zionist enemy," and Cairo radio
vowed that Israel will "pay dearly at the hand of the
Arabs for this crime."
President Houari Boumedienne of Algeria called the
incident "... a violation of the most elementary human
principles."
Premier Golda Meir expressed the Israeli government's
"deep sorrow at the loss of life resulting from the Libyan
crash in Sinai and regrets that the Libyan pilot did not
heed the repeated warnings which were given him in

WASHINGTON — The United States and Communist
China will issue a joint communique today that is
expected to report new strides in relations between the
two nations.
The communique is the outgrowth of Henry A.
Kissinger's lengthy talks with Chinese leaders in Peking,
including Chairman Mao Tse-tung.
The White House said it will be made public in Peking
and Washington at 8 a.m. PST today.
Kissinger, who has reported to Nixon since his return
from Asia Tuesday, will hold a news conference at the
White House to discuss the communique and details of his
visit to both Peking and Hanoi.
Kissinger's talks in Hanoi resulted in establishment of a
joint economic commission to consider postwar
reconstruction aid for North Vietnam.
While the White House has declined to give any details
on the forthcoming China communique, it is expected to
provide for improved trade relations, possibly the
establishment of trade missions in the two countries.
U.S. Asks POW Return Speedup
SAIGON — The United States asked the Communists
yesterday to free the next group of American prisoners as
soon as possible and to move its field teams to subregional
truce sites "to dampen major hostilities."
At a meeting of chief delegates of the United States,
North and South Vietnam, and the Viet Cong to the Joint
Military Commission, the United States expressed concern
that the Communist side is not moving its teams into the
field. The United States and South Vietnam teams are at
24 of the 26 sites, North Vietnam at five and the Viet
Cong at none.
Despite this, teams of the International Commission of
Control and Supervision began their move to 14 of the
subregional sites yesterday.
Today's Weather
Partly cloudy through today with slight chance of a
shower late today. Mostly fair tonight and tomorrow but
occasional high cloudiness. Continued mild temperatures.
Low nights in mid 40s to mid 50s. High today and
tomorrow in 60s. Light winds. Chance of rain 20 percent
today.
Earthquake.Hits §. California
LOS ANGELES — A rolling earthquake shook the
Southern California coast yesterday morning, cracking
plaster, shattering windows, starting several fires and
inflicting some major property damage.
The structural damage, mainly to older buildings, was
heaviest in Oxnard, a coastal city of 78,000 persons, 50
miles northwest of Los Angeles. Estimates by the state
Office of Emergency Preparedness placed damage there at
up to $1 million, mostly in cracked walls, broken
windows and collapsed roofs.
Several minor injuries were reported.
California Institute of Technology seismologists
measured the intensity of the quake at roughly 5.75 on
the Richter scale and said it was centered in the ocean off
Pt. Mugu, near Oxnard.
Jolting sleeping residents at 6:46 a.m. and lasting about
20 seconds, the quake recalled the 6.5 temblor of Feb. 9,
1971, in which 64 persons died. That quake, centered in
the San Fernando Valley north of here, struck at 6:01
a.m.
Israelis Down Arab Airliner
TEL AVIV — Israeli warplanes fired on a Libyan jetliner
that refused to heed warnings yesterday and forced it to
crash-land on the occupied Sinai Desert, the military
command reported.
The official casualty toll was given as at least 74
persons dead and nine seriously injured.
The command said the airline pilot acknowledged
repeated warnings that he was violating Israeli-held
territory, but did not comply. The government said the
plane had intruded into a "highly-sensitive military area"
and "behaved in a way thai rroused suspicion and concern
regarding its intentions."
Libyan radio said the plane was brought down in "an
aggressive attack by the Zionist enemy," and Cairo radio
vowed that Israel will "pay dearly at the hand of the
Arabs for this crime."
President Houari Boumedienne of Algeria called the
incident "... a violation of the most elementary human
principles."
Premier Golda Meir expressed the Israeli government's
"deep sorrow at the loss of life resulting from the Libyan
crash in Sinai and regrets that the Libyan pilot did not
heed the repeated warnings which were given him in
accordance with international procedures."
Laotian Ceasefire Signed
VIENTIANE, Laos — The divided Laotians signed
yesterday a cease-fire designed to end a decade of sporadic
warfare fought with U.S. and North Vietnamese help
along the fringes of the Vietnam conflict next door.
The cease-fire called for fighting to end at noon
Thursday in Laos, which was 9 p.m. PST last night. It gave
a strengthened political hand to the Communist-led Pathet
Lao rebels who have fought for years to take over the
small Indochinese kingdom.
Its signing meant that in principle Cambodia remains
the only country still fighting on the Indochinese
peninsula which has known off-and-on conflict since
World War 11.
The agreement provided for withdrawal of all foreign
troops, release of war prisoners within 90 days and an end
to U.S. bombing against the Pathet Lao and their
estimated 65,000 North Vietnamese allies in the country.
It bars introduction of other foreign troops and arms

and calls for a government of national unity to be set up
within 30 days.
Woman Admits 'Papers' Tie-In
LOS ANGELES — Anthony Russo's former girlfriend, an
unindicted coconspirator in the Pentagon Papers trial,
testified reluctantly yesterday that she helped Russo and
Daniel Ellsberg copy top-secret documents in 1969.
Lynda Sinay Resnick, 30, said Ellsberg's teen-aged son
Robert also helped, cutting "top secret" markings off the
copied documents.
Handed a volume of the Pentagon Papers, Mrs. Resnick
said it resembled the documents with "baby blue covers"
which were reproduced on her copying machine.
The short, brown-haired Mrs. Resnick told how the
Papers were copied during the nights of 10 to 18 days,
confirmed that police arrived during one of the copying
sessions after someone accidentally triggered a silent
burglar alarm. She said that Ellsberg told her not to read
the top-secret papers —presumably the Pentagon's study
of the Vietnam war.
