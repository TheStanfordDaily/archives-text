# Petitioned Bach Mai Fund Vote May Not Reach Palo Alto Ballot
## 
### 
Although proponents have
collected enough petition signatures,
the controversial $50,000 Bach Mai
Hospital donation initiative is not yet
assured of a place on the Palo Alto
municipal ballot.
Election officials confirmed
yesterday that the petitions circulated
by peace groups carried more than the
1646 signatures required to put before
city voters the question of a gift of
$50,000 in city funds to help rebuild
the bombed Bach Mai Hospital in
Hanoi, North Vietnam.
But next Monday night the City
Council will consider whether to put
the question on the ballot for the May
8 municipal election, and it appears

probable that they will refuse to do so.
Proponents have said that they will
go to court, should that occur.
City Attorney Peter Stone claims
that the council is not required to put
the question before the voters, since
such a donation is not within the city's
powers.
His office will recommend a course
of action to the council. Although the
recommendation will not be made
public until this afternoon, Stone has
strongly hinted that he will urge that
the question not be put before the
voters.
Sponsors of the controversial
measure say that the council is
obligated to offer the voters a chance

to vote on the issue. They do not
concur with Stone that the donation
would be impermissible.
Mayor Kirke Comstock has said he
will accept Stone's recommendation,
even if it is to exclude the measure
from the ballot. It is extremely
unlikely that the council, which
unanimously refused even to consider
authorizing such a gift itself, would
authorize an election on the measure
against Stone's advice.
Douglas Mattern of the Palo Alto
Peace Union, a leader of the initiative
campaign, expressed hopes that the
council would put the measure on the
ballot, but said that the proponents
would challenge in court a decision to
exclude the question from the ballot.
