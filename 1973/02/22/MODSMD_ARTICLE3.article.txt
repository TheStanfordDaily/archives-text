# Dean Requests Dorm 'Hot Lines'
## 
### CHARLES BENNETT 
Stanford's Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons has called for a special
red "hot line" in every dormitory
connected to a special switchboard, to
provide rapid aid in case of
emergencies.
In a letter sent yesterday to
Housing Manager Ed Scoles, Lyons
asked for examination of two
alternative proposals to improve
emergency communication in the
dorms.
"Each University residence or unit
should be equipped with special
equipment beyond that apparently
required by Santa Clara County
ordinance," Lyons' letter reads.
Direct Line
"It seems to us that... the best

way to do this would be a special,
direct phone line connected to the
emergency switchboard at the
police-fire complex, with a direct
secondary connection to Cowell.
"This phone could only be used for
this purpose," the letter goes on, "and
logically would be prominently
displayed ... in a public area of the
residence."
If this system doesn't prove
feasible, Lyons suggests as an
alternative a free, dial telephone
restricted to local calls. It would be
unlisted to prevent incoming calls and
would have emergency telephone
numbers printed on it.
Less Desirable
"This system is less desirable
because of the possibility of

non-emergency use of the phones,"
Lyons declares.
The move to install emergency
telephone service follows reports that
some dormitories are complaining
because Stanford has removed
University extensions from the
hallways of all the houses. Previously,
emergency calls could be made in
almost every dorm from these
telephones, which were restricted to
local service.
Because there could be a delay in
setting up the proposed emergency
phone system, Lyons has asked Scoles
to study the possibility of converting
dormitory pay phones to free
emergency access "as an efficient
stopgap measure." The telephone
company can adjust phones to allow

the caller to dial "0" without inserting
a dime.
However, pay-telephone conversion
would not serve well in the long run
according to Lyons, because the
telephones would not have direct
access to the Stanford emergency
switchboard.
"I'm sure you agree," writes Lyons,
"that we have an obligation to our
students, not only to meet the fire
codes, but to have the most
reasonable, safe, efficient and feasible
equipment possible in case of an
emergency.
"I hope we can move on this as
quickly as possible," the letter
concludes.
Lyons explained that "quickly"
meant "quicker than what things
usually take" to get done. "Pretty
darn soon," he emphasized.
Feasibility
Lyons and Scoles will now have to
examine the proposals for feasibility
before making a final decision to
implement one. Lyons said factors to
be considered include cost of the
system and how many phones should
be installed in what locations.
If both systems prove too
expensive, Lyons said the University
will have to examine the possibility of
phasing the service in over a period of
time.
Lyons' proposal was originally
supported by Stanford Police Services
Director Marvin Herrington and
Cowell Director Dr. James
McClenahan, but opposed by Stanford
Fire Chief Frank Jurian. Jurian has
said he prefers an automatic box alarm
for all the emergency services, since
phone callers are often hysterical in
emergencies.
Jurian's idea was rejected because
all the dorms will soon have internal
"box" fire alarms, and it was felt that
ambulance and police services cannot
respond without knowing details that
can only be gathered over the
telephone.
