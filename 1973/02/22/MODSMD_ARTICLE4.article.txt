# Police Say Perlov Not Sexually Assaulted
## 
### 
Leslie Marie Perlov, the Palo Alto
law clerk whose strangled body was
discovered last Friday in the foothills
behind the campus, was apparently
not sexually assaulted as was
previously believed, a Santa Clara
County Sheriff's investigator said
yesterday.
Capt. Frank Mosunic said that

"indications are that she was not
sexually assaulted" before she was
murdered last Tuesday night.
Her body was found by searchers
Friday morning. Her skirt had been
pulled up around her waist, and her
pantyhose had been stuffed into her
mouth.
In a statement issued by Sheriff

James M. Geary, the authorities
appealed to "anyone seeing persons or
vehicles in the vicinity of the quarry
gate on Old Page Mill Road" after 3
p.m. on Tuesday, Feb. 13 to contact
the office at 299-3844 during business
hours or 299-3902 after 5 p.m.
Mosunic said yesterday that the
Sheriff's office is also trying to locate
members of a Stanford class that may
have met near the quarry site late
Tuesday afternoon. He said a passer-by
had seen several persons there who
may have been Stanford students.
The University Registrar's office
said yesterday that it would be almost
impossible to find out what course
might have met there, since it was
unlikely that was its regular meeting
place.
Mosunic said yesterday that there
are "still no new leads" in the case,
despite the fact that 15 Sheriff's
officers have been assigned full-time to
the case. He estimates that the officers
have already put in "well over 1300"
man-hours on the investigation.
Officers spent several days after

Perlov's body was discovered gathering
physical evidence from the site. This
material has been sent to the state
crime lab in Sacramento for analysis,
but Mosunic said it will be "some
time" before the results of the analysis
are known.
Meanwhile, authorities are still
checking previous leads in the case,
including any possible connection
between Perlov and Mark Rosvold, 25,
of Palo Alto, whose body was found in
the foothills last week by officers
searching for Perlov. Rosvold was an
apparent suicide, and the county
coroner fixed his time of death the
morning after Perlov was slain.
Perlov's car, an orange Chevrolet,
was first spotted parked at the gate
Tuesday afternoon by a passing
off-duty Palo Alto policeman, who
said he saw her talking to a young man
with long blond hair. A beige auto was
parked nearby.
Mosunic asked that anyone who
saw either of the vehicles contact the
Sheriffs office immediately.
