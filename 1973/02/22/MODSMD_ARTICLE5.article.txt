# Imeros—For The Lonely
## Project Seeks To Match Students 
### JOANNE JACOBS 
Imeros: a Greek word meaning "the longing for
someone or something."
"Imeros has the stigma of computer dating or a Lonely
Hearts Club,"says Jonathan Hansen, Imeros coordinator.
He prefers to describe the project as a matching service for
students of similar interests.
"Are you tired of staying alone in the dorm?" Imeros
ads ask. "Straight or gay, freak or square, whether you are
looking for a platonic or sexual relationship there is for
sure a kindred spirit out there you could get together
with."
Imeros is a project of the Bridge, a campus "drop-in
center" at 634 Campus Dr., staffed by student volunteers
trained as peer counselors. Nancy Hendrick, a counselor at
the Bridge, describes the procedure for applicants. "They
fill out a questionnaire on how they look at themselves as
a person and what they're interested in."
Applicants also designate the sex, age, race or other
characteristics of a preferred match. One student asked
for a "foxy lady."
Personal Interview
The questionnaire is followed by a personal interview
with the counselor on duty, "to check out what they're
really looking for and to see if they're weird or straight,"
Hendrick explains.
All information is confidential. Hansen and counselor
Ron Long sift the questionnaires and try to match
interests and, if possible, similar political views.
"We just spread them out all over the floor and read
through them," Hansen declares. "Computer dating is a
myth. It's an intuitive process. Pretty much a matter of
luck."
Imeros gives each half of a match the others' phone
number and lets them take it from there. So far, the
project has brought together twenty couples out of its

pool of forty male and fifteen female students. Some of
the girls have been matched with more than one male.
Little Feedback
Hansen has heard little feedback from the participants.
Of the four couples he has talked to, two reported that
the match didn't work out, while the other two pairs still
see each other occasionally.
Imeros got off to a slow start when it began last spring,
but now it is advertising to attract a larger pool of
students, especially women. "You need a large enough
group of people so you can get good matches," Hansen
said. "With that few people you don't get the variety."
Every applicant is not necessarily looking for a sexual
partner. Many want a companion; others are interested in
a serious relationship. Hansen explains, "Some people
want someone to go bicycling or backpacking with; some
are looking for a husband or wife."
Social Atmosphere
"Generally this campus doesn't provide too much of a
social atmosphere," he observes.
"A lot of the people who sign up for Imeros live off
campus or live in dorms that are sociaHy isolating."
Undergraduates have a relatively easier time making
contacts. "There tend to be a higher ratio of graduate
students and foreign students due to their own peculiar
social handicaps," Hansen says.
According to Hendrick, "There's a lot of people who
are really lonely. Unquestionably its our major
complaint." But she feels that many students are
unwilling to admit that they have a problem or fear that
Imeros will set them up for rejection.
Loneliness Stigma
"Being lonely has a social stigma," Hansen says.
"Imeros has to fight this. How can this be a socially
acceptable thing to do?"
