## Press Infiltration 
### 
The attack on the freedom of the press has taken a new
and frightening turn with the recent revelation that
Alexander Jason, a San Francisco undercover police officer,
worked on the San Francisco State Phoenix, the student
newspaper, while infiltrating left-wing campus groups last
year.
In the past year, repression of the press has taken the
form of jailing reporters who refuse to reveal confidential
sources and information. The ever-present danger of a court
subpoena has adversely affected a reporter's ability to obtain
and disseminate important news. Now, a news source cannot
even be sure if he is talking to a reporter or a cop.
Aside from the threat he posed to the freedom of the
press, Jason's presence on campus further represents a blow
to academic freedom. State Assemblyman John J. Miller
(D-Berkeley) has said he will re-introduce legislation this
year that would make it illegal for police agents to operate
on college campuses.
Miller first introduced the legislation in 1971 after a gun
slipped out of the pocket of an undercover agent in a class at
Sacramento State College, and discharged, wounding several
students. The bill was killed in the Criminal Justice
Committee. It is imperative that the legislation be passed
this time.
The use of undercover police agents on campus at all is
outrageous. But to use a newspaper as a "cover" for such
activities is truly ominous. The San Francisco Police
Department is to be condemned for its blatant disregard of
the rights of the San Francisco State community.
