# Department Coordinators

ASSU Course Review

The ASSU Course Review is
looking for competent, interested
Stanford students to serve as
department coordinators. The job
is not overwhelming and could be
a lot of fun.
Each academic department in
the University to be surveyed by
the Course Review must be under
the supervision of a department
coordinator. Each coordinator is
responsible for circulating
questionnaires in classes taught in
his or her department. After
questionnaires are circulated and
collected, department
coordinators are responsible for
seeing that an essay is written
about each course surveyed.
Needless to say, all of this is a
lot of work for one person, but it
is usually quite easy to recruit
volunteers in each department
who are interested in one or more
specific courses, and who are
willing to survey and write about
them. The workload is balanced
by ; department in that larger
departments require more work to
coordinate, but also have a larger
number of volunteers. The
department coordinator will, of
course, have first choice as to
which essays he or she writes, and
can allocate the rest of the essays
to volunteers.
Overwhelming Benefits
In addition, coordinators have
the advantage of being able to talk
with professors in their
departments, since advance
arrangements must usually be
made to distribute questionnaires
in class. Thus coordinators will
have the opportunity to meet
their professors in a situation
other than the classroom.
More important, however,
coordinators will be an integral
part of a service which Stanford
students have sought for quite
some time. Last year's ASSU

Guerilla was a valiant start, but
the hasty way in which it was put
together led to a generally limited
and incomplete publication. By
beginning early and by expanding
the scope of the Course Review,
we hope to eliminate those
problems this year.
We would prefer department
coordinators to work within their
major fields, although this is not a
necessity. So far, we only have
coordinators for English, history,
economics, physics, biology and
political science, so coordinators
in all other departments are
needed immediately—by this
coming Monday since the
questionnaires for this quarter will
be circulated next week.
Why A Course Review?
Some students still doubt the
value of a student-run Course
Review. We see many reasons why
such a review is needed.
Too often, students have no
notion whatever about the
content of the courses they enroll
in or the quality of the
instructors. Although students can
sample classes during the first
couple of weeks of a quarter, it
would certainly be helpful if they
could benefit from the knowledge
of those who have taken these
courses before. This knowledge
would make course selection less
like roulette and more like the
serious academic process it should
be.
The question has also risen as
to why courses required for
certain majors should be reviewed
in the Course Review—since
students in those majors must
take those courses regardless of
their quality. As we see it, the
Course Review is not only for
students, but is for faculty and
administrators as well. Hopefully
instructors will look at comments
about their courses and attempt

to incorporate student
recommendations in order to
improve.
Aux Armes
We can only make this Course
Review successful if the students
who have wanted it are willing to
work on it. The job of a
department coordinator is not a
strenuous job, yet it is perhaps the
most important job on the Course
Review. Without department
coordinators, the Course Review
cannot exist. And it is obviously
in the best interests of Stanford
education to make this Course
Review as informative as possible.
Anyone interested in being a
department coordinator or a
department volunteer should leave
his or her name and telephone
number with Brent Appel at the
ASSU office (extension 4331), or
contact Course Review co-editors
Steve Carter (327-9595), Melody
Broadbent (329-1479), or Kevin
Smith (326-2268) by Monday.
Please help.
