# ACLU Project Director Fears Student Informers
## 
### JAMES LOBSENZ 
Frank Donner, the director of the
American Civil Liberties Union
(ACLU) research project on political
surveillance, believes that "college
campuses are rife with informers."
Donner addressed an audience of
about 150 people in Cubberley
Auditorium last night. He was joined
by Paul Halvonik, former Legal
Director of the Northern California
branch of the ACLU in the third of a
series of four programs on "Might vs.
Right in America." The four day
conference is being sponsored by the
Stanford Committee On Political
Education (SCOPE) and by the
Stanford chapter of the National
Lawyers Guild.
Donner told the audience that
police found college campuses "a
fertile ground for recruiting
informers," for a number of reasons.
Need No Cover
"First, student recruited informers
need no instruction on cover. They
already possess the necessary sartorial
outfit, and the appropriately
inconspicuous life style.
"Second, there are plenty of
students who regard the job as an easy
way to make a buck.
"Third, if he is an avid right-winger,
the student informer may regard his
occupation as a civic duty, like giving
blood to the Red Cross.
"And finally, fourth, the
adventurous student may take on the
job just for a lark. He'll try it for a
while just to see what it's like."
Political Surveillance
Donner defined political

surveillance as "the gathering of
political intelligence, which is
unrelated to law enforcement, for one
of two reasons. Either the gathering is
an end in itself, designed to intimidate
its targets, or it's for use later at the
day of 'deferred reckoning'—a day
which may come when the people in
power will want to know who the
dissidents are."
Donner described several
techniques used in political
surveillance including physical
shadowing, the widespread use of
photography, wiretapping, the
interrogation of third parties and the
use of informers.
Donner denounced society's
toleration of the practice of political
surveillance, maintaining that it
"violates the First Amendment
freedom of free association, raises
serious questions concerning the
invasion of Fourth Amendment rights,
and it violates the ethical norms of a
Judeo-Christian society that condemns
betrayal. It enormously exaggerates
the dangers and evils in our society,
and it results in equating dissent with
something evil."
He categorized informers as either
"plants" or "defectors" and held that
the police forces and the FBI were
mostly reliant upon "plants." The
main motivation of informers is
money, said Donner. Although "some
are ideologically motivated, they
believe that subversion has it hands on
the throat of the nation."
First Amendment Rights
Halvonik spoke on the subject of
First Amendment rights and the

distinction between constitutionally
protected speech and unprotected
speech that contains incitement to
unlawful action.
Halvonik reviewed the case of fired
English Prof. H. Bruce Franklin and
concluded that "hardly anything
Franklin ever said was liable to incite
something. He made speeches in
situations that were tense. But we
must decide whether or not there was
a lack of opportunity for reflection
after his speeches, and this was never
the case."
Halvonik found that in Franklin's
situations "there was always
opportunity for reflection, there was
often debate, sometimes votes on
proposed action, and often speeches
made after Franklin's."
The fourth and final meeting of the
four day conference tonight will
feature "Pentagon Papers" defendant
Daniel Ellsberg and Ramparts Press
editor Steve Weissman. The program
will be held in Memorial Church at 8
p.m.
