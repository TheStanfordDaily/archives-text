# Wrinkles In The Technology Of Increase
## The 						Coming World Food Crisis 
### 
sRichard Burke

Gluttons of the world's energy
resources must be stopped. This
means our "developed" world, the
U.S., San Francisco Bay industry,
Stanford, and you. In any case,
they all will be, for the highly
concentrated distribution of
material wealth and the
desecration of land and sane
minds which accompany it, are
not stable enough situations to
increase like they have for a
hundred years, let alone forever. I
believe we should humble
ourselves now, daily, to rectify
the current state, and I shall
comment on one aspect of how to
do so in this article.
Food is life's primary energy
resource. Almost all man's food
derives directly from the
"life-giver," sun. We have
multiplied enough and arranged
the food chains enough so that a
fifth of the land's photosynthesis
and a seventh of the ocean's are
needed to supply what we eat.

And our own numbers will double
in 25 years!
It is true, food production is
increasing at 2.5 percent a year,
but this translated to a 1.5
percent increase per person in the
developed countries and a -.2
percent for the undeveloped ones,
where most of the multiplying is
going on.
Depleted Resources
Bear in mind, too, that the
present methods used for
increasing available food involves
greater and greater depletion of
non-renewable reservoirs of
energy: fossil fuels, water, metals
for all the machines, fertilizers,
and water works of today's food
technology. I propose an
alternative way to live with food.
I have no doubt something like it
will occur; the physics of the
situation demands it. But what we
need is some politics (or religion?)
to get us there smoothly. First,
what is being done now?
There are basically two ways to
increase food production: by
utilizing more space or by
increasing the yield within the
present space. Of the world's 32
billion land acres, a fourth may be
suitable for crops, a third for
grazing, and the rest, tundra,
mountains, ice, and desert, are not
usable at all. Less than half of the
possible cropland is presently used
but all the best lands have already
been taken, so the rest are of little
likely help in the future. What is
left is (1) low fertility tropic land
where excessive rainfall causes
nutrients to leech (sink below
root level), and the high iron
content often present in the soils
hardens it like rock when natural
cover is stripped, and (2) semi-arid
areas where it is just not
economical, in terms of power
supply and material needs, to
begin large irrigation projects in
low yielding areas of low
population, compared to working
to make sure high yield areas are
consistently sufficiently
furnished.
Both cases show the
inapplicability of present
agri-technological methods, but in
addition, population conditions
are such that any increase of food
supply in the first case would be
immediately used up, and in the
second case hardly used at all.
Suburban Rip Off
Incredibly, more fertile lands
are being destroyed by the dense
populations which live on them. A
hundred acres go for every
Inter-state mile. San Jose suburbs
rip off beautiful orchards. I bet
we even needn't wait long before
our own Escondido garden gets
wiped out by advances of the
nearby high-rises.
The sea is no solution; or if it
is, it is, at best, an unpleasant one
to swallow. Four-fifths of the
total fish catch is harvested in
only 10 percent of the ocean
watersâ€”those of the continental
shelves, but taking into account
the much larger food chains
needed to support animal life in
the sea, compared to the land, it is
not likely that our present 70
million tons reap of the sea will
ever more than double in the
future.
Most of the world's people
depend on cereals, rice, wheat,
and corn, for their protein and
calories. The best technological
advances we could make, then,
would be to increase the yield of
this group of foods, but problems
are generated which won't yield
to any amount of advancing.
Desalinization Problems
There are essentially no unused
conventional water sources in the
U.S. (U.S. Geological Survey).
Desalinization plants entail huge
salt disposal problems (35 tons are
removed from water needed to
support production of a ton of
milk!) to say nothing of the

fantastic wastes of atomic power
generators these plants imply.
Although mineral supply for
fertilizer is adequate, its
manufacturing needs are no less
power hungry: a ton takes 15 tons
of oil to make. Chemicals
developed for pest control, weed
control, fungus control are
famous for their side effects. New
genetic varieties will certainly
help, but they are usually selected
to grow best only when all the
other technologically fancy inputs
are added, too. Hybrids developed
for more complete protein
properties will be invaluable, but
their different taste has limited
their acceptance.
Hold on to your spatulas, big
daddies, there is no future in
meat. There never was or will be
one for two-thirds of the world's
population, but soon even the rest
must come to understand it is a
waste. Cattle use 21 pounds of
protein for every one they make
usable. Meat is valuable in small
amounts for its complete protein,
but it is just not needed and will
not be suppliable, at rates
Americans presently consume it.
Those futurists who have faith
in such things as algae don't know
beans. These organisms are too
tough to harvest economically.
They need well-controlled inputs
of minerals, precious oil, water,
and constant sun. To top it off,
the finished product, though 50
percent protein, lacks it in the
correct amino acid proportions.
Thus we have seen present
attempts at increased food
production a) may not apply to
areas where it is needed b) cannot
keep up with increases of
population and percapita
consumption demand, and c)
damage the environment and

drain it of its energy sources. This
doesn't mean all these attempts
have been failures or that present
techniques of research into and
application of methods to increase
yields should be stopped. But I do
say alternative ways of looking at
the world and acting with it must
get going now.
Back Methods
Perhaps we could learn from
the methods of other cultures,
think of that! The bush fallow
methods (waiting many years
before re-using tropic cropland)
may be the best way to "use" this
land. Here at home, voluntary or
legislated reduction of population
and consumption will help.
Reduction of meat and junk foods
are necessary, but good foods
must be substituted. Support for
organic gardening is needed.
The more we can live with
what else lives, rather than trying
to stamp them out, the better.
People should learn to control
their own support systems by
growing food in local communes,
backyards, and city parks. In
general, it should be a maxim that
each person tune in to what she or
he and other people really need
for food and act to supply those
needs.
The food crises is not without
parallel ones in the global society.
Population puts pressure on
energies of all kinds. Natural gas,
oil, and many minerals will be
reaching acute scarcity just when
their per capita consumption is at
its highest .for the developed
countries and also at a time
(hopefully by then) when the
under-developed countries have
acheived power enough to be able
to back up demands for a fair
share. Somebody's got to give.

and a seventh of the ocean's are
needed to supply what we eat.

And our own numbers will double
in 25 years!
It is true, food production is
increasing at 2.5 percent a year,
but this translated to a 1.5
percent increase per person in the
developed countries and a -.2
percent for the undeveloped ones,
where most of the multiplying is
going on.
Depleted Resources
Bear in mind, too, that the
present methods used for
increasing available food involves
greater and greater depletion of
non-renewable reservoirs of
energy: fossil fuels, water, metals
for all the machines, fertilizers,
and water works of today's food
technology. I propose an
alternative way to live with food.
I have no doubt something like it
will occur; the physics of the
situation demands it. But what we
need is some politics (or religion?)
to get us there smoothly. First,
what is being done now?
There are basically two ways to
increase food production: by
utilizing more space or by
increasing the yield within the
present space. Of the world's 32
billion land acres, a fourth may be
suitable for crops, a third for
grazing, and the rest, tundra,
mountains, ice, and desert, are not
usable at all. Less than half of the
possible cropland is presently used
but all the best lands have already
been taken, so the rest are of little
likely help in the future. What is
left is (1) low fertility tropic land
where excessive rainfall causes
nutrients to leech (sink below
root level), and the high iron
content often present in the soils
hardens it like rock when natural
cover is stripped, and (2) semi-arid
areas where it is just not
economical, in terms of power
supply and material needs, to
begin large irrigation projects in
low yielding areas of low
population, compared to working
to make sure high yield areas are
consistently sufficiently
furnished.
Both cases show the
inapplicability of present
agri-technological methods, but in
addition, population conditions
are such that any increase of food
supply in the first case would be
immediately used up, and in the
second case hardly used at all.
Suburban Rip Off
Incredibly, more fertile lands
are being destroyed by the dense
populations which live on them. A
hundred acres go for every
Inter-state mile. San Jose suburbs
rip off beautiful orchards. I bet
we even needn't wait long before
our own Escondido garden gets
wiped out by advances of the
nearby high-rises.
The sea is no solution; or if it
is, it is, at best, an unpleasant one
to swallow. Four-fifths of the
total fish catch is harvested in
only 10 percent of the ocean
watersâ€”those of the continental
shelves, but taking into account
the much larger food chains
needed to support animal life in
the sea, compared to the land, it is
not likely that our present 70
million tons reap of the sea will
ever more than double in the
future.
Most of the world's people
depend on cereals, rice, wheat,
and corn, for their protein and
calories. The best technological
advances we could make, then,
would be to increase the yield of
this group of foods, but problems
are generated which won't yield
to any amount of advancing.
Desalinization Problems
There are essentially no unused
conventional water sources in the
U.S. (U.S. Geological Survey).
Desalinization plants entail huge
salt disposal problems (35 tons are
removed from water needed to
support production of a ton of
milk!) to say nothing of the

fantastic wastes of atomic power
generators these plants imply.
Although mineral supply for
fertilizer is adequate, its
manufacturing needs are no less
power hungry: a ton takes 15 tons
of oil to make. Chemicals
developed for pest control, weed
control, fungus control are
famous for their side effects. New
genetic varieties will certainly
help, but they are usually selected
to grow best only when all the
other technologically fancy inputs
are added, too. Hybrids developed
for more complete protein
properties will be invaluable, but
their different taste has limited
their acceptance.
Hold on to your spatulas, big
daddies, there is no future in
meat. There never was or will be
one for two-thirds of the world's
population, but soon even the rest
must come to understand it is a
waste. Cattle use 21 pounds of
protein for every one they make
usable. Meat is valuable in small
amounts for its complete protein,
but it is just not needed and will
not be suppliable, at rates
Americans presently consume it.
Those futurists who have faith
in such things as algae don't know
beans. These organisms are too
tough to harvest economically.
They need well-controlled inputs
of minerals, precious oil, water,
and constant sun. To top it off,
the finished product, though 50
percent protein, lacks it in the
correct amino acid proportions.
Thus we have seen present
attempts at increased food
production a) may not apply to
areas where it is needed b) cannot
keep up with increases of
population and percapita
consumption demand, and c)
damage the environment and

drain it of its energy sources. This
doesn't mean all these attempts
have been failures or that present
techniques of research into and
application of methods to increase
yields should be stopped. But I do
say alternative ways of looking at
the world and acting with it must
get going now.
Back Methods
Perhaps we could learn from
the methods of other cultures,
think of that! The bush fallow
methods (waiting many years
before re-using tropic cropland)
may be the best way to "use" this
land. Here at home, voluntary or
legislated reduction of population
and consumption will help.
Reduction of meat and junk foods
are necessary, but good foods
must be substituted. Support for
organic gardening is needed.
The more we can live with
what else lives, rather than trying
to stamp them out, the better.
People should learn to control
their own support systems by
growing food in local communes,
backyards, and city parks. In
general, it should be a maxim that
each person tune in to what she or
he and other people really need
for food and act to supply those
needs.
The food crises is not without
parallel ones in the global society.
Population puts pressure on
energies of all kinds. Natural gas,
oil, and many minerals will be
reaching acute scarcity just when
their per capita consumption is at
its highest .for the developed
countries and also at a time
(hopefully by then) when the
under-developed countries have
acheived power enough to be able
to back up demands for a fair
share. Somebody's got to give.

to get us there smoothly. First,
what is being done now?
There are basically two ways to
increase food production: by
utilizing more space or by
increasing the yield within the
present space. Of the world's 32
billion land acres, a fourth may be
suitable for crops, a third for
grazing, and the rest, tundra,
mountains, ice, and desert, are not
usable at all. Less than half of the
possible cropland is presently used
but all the best lands have already
been taken, so the rest are of little
likely help in the future. What is
left is (1) low fertility tropic land
where excessive rainfall causes
nutrients to leech (sink below
root level), and the high iron
content often present in the soils
hardens it like rock when natural
cover is stripped, and (2) semi-arid
areas where it is just not
economical, in terms of power
supply and material needs, to
begin large irrigation projects in
low yielding areas of low
population, compared to working
to make sure high yield areas are
consistently sufficiently
furnished.
Both cases show the
inapplicability of present
agri-technological methods, but in
addition, population conditions
are such that any increase of food
supply in the first case would be
immediately used up, and in the
second case hardly used at all.
Suburban Rip Off
Incredibly, more fertile lands
are being destroyed by the dense
populations which live on them. A
hundred acres go for every
Inter-state mile. San Jose suburbs
rip off beautiful orchards. I bet
we even needn't wait long before
our own Escondido garden gets
wiped out by advances of the
nearby high-rises.
The sea is no solution; or if it
is, it is, at best, an unpleasant one
to swallow. Four-fifths of the
total fish catch is harvested in
only 10 percent of the ocean
watersâ€”those of the continental
shelves, but taking into account
the much larger food chains
needed to support animal life in
the sea, compared to the land, it is
not likely that our present 70
million tons reap of the sea will
ever more than double in the
future.
Most of the world's people
depend on cereals, rice, wheat,
and corn, for their protein and
calories. The best technological
advances we could make, then,
would be to increase the yield of
this group of foods, but problems
are generated which won't yield
to any amount of advancing.
Desalinization Problems
There are essentially no unused
conventional water sources in the
U.S. (U.S. Geological Survey).
Desalinization plants entail huge
salt disposal problems (35 tons are
removed from water needed to
support production of a ton of
milk!) to say nothing of the

fantastic wastes of atomic power
generators these plants imply.
Although mineral supply for
fertilizer is adequate, its
manufacturing needs are no less
power hungry: a ton takes 15 tons
of oil to make. Chemicals
developed for pest control, weed
control, fungus control are
famous for their side effects. New
genetic varieties will certainly
help, but they are usually selected
to grow best only when all the
other technologically fancy inputs
are added, too. Hybrids developed
for more complete protein
properties will be invaluable, but
their different taste has limited
their acceptance.
Hold on to your spatulas, big
daddies, there is no future in
meat. There never was or will be
one for two-thirds of the world's
population, but soon even the rest
must come to understand it is a
waste. Cattle use 21 pounds of
protein for every one they make
usable. Meat is valuable in small
amounts for its complete protein,
but it is just not needed and will
not be suppliable, at rates
Americans presently consume it.
Those futurists who have faith
in such things as algae don't know
beans. These organisms are too
tough to harvest economically.
They need well-controlled inputs
of minerals, precious oil, water,
and constant sun. To top it off,
the finished product, though 50
percent protein, lacks it in the
correct amino acid proportions.
Thus we have seen present
attempts at increased food
production a) may not apply to
areas where it is needed b) cannot
keep up with increases of
population and percapita
consumption demand, and c)
damage the environment and

drain it of its energy sources. This
doesn't mean all these attempts
have been failures or that present
techniques of research into and
application of methods to increase
yields should be stopped. But I do
say alternative ways of looking at
the world and acting with it must
get going now.
Back Methods
Perhaps we could learn from
the methods of other cultures,
think of that! The bush fallow
methods (waiting many years
before re-using tropic cropland)
may be the best way to "use" this
land. Here at home, voluntary or
legislated reduction of population
and consumption will help.
Reduction of meat and junk foods
are necessary, but good foods
must be substituted. Support for
organic gardening is needed.
The more we can live with
what else lives, rather than trying
to stamp them out, the better.
People should learn to control
their own support systems by
growing food in local communes,
backyards, and city parks. In
general, it should be a maxim that
each person tune in to what she or
he and other people really need
for food and act to supply those
needs.
The food crises is not without
parallel ones in the global society.
Population puts pressure on
energies of all kinds. Natural gas,
oil, and many minerals will be
reaching acute scarcity just when
their per capita consumption is at
its highest .for the developed
countries and also at a time
(hopefully by then) when the
under-developed countries have
acheived power enough to be able
to back up demands for a fair
share. Somebody's got to give.

Gluttons of the world's energy
resources must be stopped. This
means our "developed" world, the
U.S., San Francisco Bay industry,
Stanford, and you. In any case,
they all will be, for the highly
concentrated distribution of
material wealth and the
desecration of land and sane
minds which accompany it, are
not stable enough situations to
increase like they have for a
hundred years, let alone forever. I
believe we should humble
ourselves now, daily, to rectify
the current state, and I shall
comment on one aspect of how to

Food is life's primary energy
resource. Almost all man's food
derives directly from the
"life-giver," sun. We have
multiplied enough and arranged
the food chains enough so that a
fifth of the land's photosynthesis
and a seventh of the ocean's are
needed to supply what we eat.

And our own numbers will double
in 25 years!
It is true, food production is
increasing at 2.5 percent a year,
but this translated to a 1.5
percent increase per person in the
developed countries and a -.2
percent for the undeveloped ones,
where most of the multiplying is
going on.
Depleted Resources
Bear in mind, too, that the
present methods used for
increasing available food involves
greater and greater depletion of
non-renewable reservoirs of
energy: fossil fuels, water, metals
for all the machines, fertilizers,
and water works of today's food
technology. I propose an
alternative way to live with food.
I have no doubt something like it

supply and material needs, to
begin large irrigation projects in
low yielding areas of low
population, compared to working
to make sure high yield areas are
consistently sufficiently
furnished.
Both cases show the
inapplicability of present
agri-technological methods, but in
addition, population conditions
are such that any increase of food
supply in the first case would be
immediately used up, and in the
second case hardly used at all.
Suburban Rip Off
Incredibly, more fertile lands
are being destroyed by the dense
populations which live on them. A
hundred acres go for every
Inter-state mile. San Jose suburbs
rip off beautiful orchards. I bet
we even needn't wait long before
our own Escondido garden gets
wiped out by advances of the
nearby high-rises.
The sea is no solution; or if it
is, it is, at best, an unpleasant one
to swallow. Four-fifths of the
total fish catch is harvested in
only 10 percent of the ocean
watersâ€”those of the continental
shelves, but taking into account
the much larger food chains
needed to support animal life in
the sea, compared to the land, it is
not likely that our present 70
million tons reap of the sea will
ever more than double in the
future.
Most of the world's people
depend on cereals, rice, wheat,
and corn, for their protein and
calories. The best technological
advances we could make, then,
would be to increase the yield of
this group of foods, but problems
are generated which won't yield
to any amount of advancing.
Desalinization Problems
There are essentially no unused
conventional water sources in the
U.S. (U.S. Geological Survey).
Desalinization plants entail huge
salt disposal problems (35 tons are
removed from water needed to
support production of a ton of
milk!) to say nothing of the

fantastic wastes of atomic power
generators these plants imply.
Although mineral supply for
fertilizer is adequate, its
manufacturing needs are no less
power hungry: a ton takes 15 tons
of oil to make. Chemicals
developed for pest control, weed
control, fungus control are
famous for their side effects. New
genetic varieties will certainly
help, but they are usually selected
to grow best only when all the
other technologically fancy inputs
are added, too. Hybrids developed
for more complete protein
properties will be invaluable, but
their different taste has limited
their acceptance.
Hold on to your spatulas, big
daddies, there is no future in
meat. There never was or will be
one for two-thirds of the world's
population, but soon even the rest
must come to understand it is a
waste. Cattle use 21 pounds of
protein for every one they make
usable. Meat is valuable in small
amounts for its complete protein,
but it is just not needed and will
not be suppliable, at rates
Americans presently consume it.
Those futurists who have faith
in such things as algae don't know
beans. These organisms are too
tough to harvest economically.
They need well-controlled inputs
of minerals, precious oil, water,
and constant sun. To top it off,
the finished product, though 50
percent protein, lacks it in the
correct amino acid proportions.
Thus we have seen present
attempts at increased food
production a) may not apply to
areas where it is needed b) cannot
keep up with increases of
population and percapita
consumption demand, and c)
damage the environment and

drain it of its energy sources. This
doesn't mean all these attempts
have been failures or that present
techniques of research into and
application of methods to increase
yields should be stopped. But I do
say alternative ways of looking at
the world and acting with it must
get going now.
Back Methods
Perhaps we could learn from
the methods of other cultures,
think of that! The bush fallow
methods (waiting many years
before re-using tropic cropland)
may be the best way to "use" this
land. Here at home, voluntary or
legislated reduction of population
and consumption will help.
Reduction of meat and junk foods
are necessary, but good foods
must be substituted. Support for
organic gardening is needed.
The more we can live with
what else lives, rather than trying
to stamp them out, the better.
People should learn to control
their own support systems by
growing food in local communes,
backyards, and city parks. In
general, it should be a maxim that
each person tune in to what she or
he and other people really need
for food and act to supply those
needs.
The food crises is not without
parallel ones in the global society.
Population puts pressure on
energies of all kinds. Natural gas,
oil, and many minerals will be
reaching acute scarcity just when
their per capita consumption is at
its highest .for the developed
countries and also at a time
(hopefully by then) when the
under-developed countries have
acheived power enough to be able
to back up demands for a fair
share. Somebody's got to give.

Gluttons of the world's energy
resources must be stopped. This
means our "developed" world, the
U.S., San Francisco Bay industry,
Stanford, and you. In any case,
they all will be, for the highly
concentrated distribution of
material wealth and the
desecration of land and sane
minds which accompany it, are
not stable enough situations to
increase like they have for a
hundred years, let alone forever. I
believe we should humble
ourselves now, daily, to rectify
the current state, and I shall
comment on one aspect of how to
do so in this article.
Food is life's primary energy
resource. Almost all man's food
derives directly from the
"life-giver," sun. We have
multiplied enough and arranged
the food chains enough so that a
fifth of the land's photosynthesis
and a seventh of the ocean's are
needed to supply what we eat.

And our own numbers will double
in 25 years!
It is true, food production is
increasing at 2.5 percent a year,
but this translated to a 1.5
percent increase per person in the
developed countries and a -.2
percent for the undeveloped ones,
where most of the multiplying is
going on.
Depleted Resources
Bear in mind, too, that the
present methods used for
increasing available food involves
greater and greater depletion of
non-renewable reservoirs of
energy: fossil fuels, water, metals
for all the machines, fertilizers,
and water works of today's food
technology. I propose an
alternative way to live with food.
I have no doubt something like it
will occur; the physics of the
situation demands it. But what we
need is some politics (or religion?)
to get us there smoothly. First,
what is being done now?
There are basically two ways to
increase food production: by
utilizing more space or by
increasing the yield within the
present space. Of the world's 32
billion land acres, a fourth may be
suitable for crops, a third for
grazing, and the rest, tundra,
mountains, ice, and desert, are not
usable at all. Less than half of the
possible cropland is presently used
but all the best lands have already
been taken, so the rest are of little
likely help in the future. What is
left is (1) low fertility tropic land
where excessive rainfall causes
nutrients to leech (sink below
root level), and the high iron
content often present in the soils
hardens it like rock when natural
cover is stripped, and (2) semi-arid
areas where it is just not
economical, in terms of power
supply and material needs, to
begin large irrigation projects in
low yielding areas of low
population, compared to working
to make sure high yield areas are
consistently sufficiently
furnished.
Both cases show the
inapplicability of present
agri-technological methods, but in
addition, population conditions
are such that any increase of food
supply in the first case would be
immediately used up, and in the
second case hardly used at all.
