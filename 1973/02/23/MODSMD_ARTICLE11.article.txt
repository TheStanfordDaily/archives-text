Kicking A Dead Issue
Editor:
The whole Grateful Dead issue
has been carried to ridiculous
extremes, and I think most of us
would agree it is now a "dead"
issue. Yet it might be interesting
to note a few things in review.
Mr. Richard Peers originally
complained that he had received a
leaflet, paid for in part by an
endorsed presidential candidate,
which perported to be a thank
you note to us all for passing a
referendum last year. Peers
questioned the political intentions
of it and its authors, Messrs. Van
Petten and Shannon, and
requested clarification.
In response, the Daily printed a
character attack of Peers by a Ms.
Staar, which in its triteness
answered none of his questions,
and added nothing to the
resolution of the question. This
was followed by a somber
response by Van Petten, asking
sympathy for his action and
justifying the leaflet through
references to the numerous
attacks on the A.S.S.U. as a
whole. Again, no response was
made to Peers' question of
political intent, but justification
was given by Van Petten in the
sense that he claimed he was
trying to clear the A.S.S.U.'s
name.
This letter was followed by an
article by Mr. Eric Hemel,
pointing out that this justification
by Van Petten was of
questionable value, as of all the
four Presidents of the A.S.S.U.
only Van Petten was mentioned.
The last installment of this saga
was a letter by our illustrious
President Scott Burke (a man who
thinks it important enough to call
press conferences to announce he
will not seek re-election, and
follows this with an endorsement
of Van Petten), who attacked
Peers and Hemel for their
pettiness. He ended his letter by
claiming that he had not wished
his name on the pamphlet, and
that Hemel and Peers should refer
such charges to the Menlo Park
Nursery School.
It's interesting to note that
through this all, the original
question raised by Peers was never
answered — and I guess we will
have to wait until spring to get
such an answer.
I find it interesting too that
Mr. Burke and company respond
to attacks in the traditional Spiro
Agnew method — i.e., don't
answer the charges but try instead
to assassinate characters
(remember those effete snobs?). It
looks like Mr. Burke, like Mr.
Agnew, prefers this method over
others; and this is one student
who thinks that it's too bad that
politics here at Stanford can't be
more respectable than our
"leaders" here make them.
Indeed, the issue in question
has been overworked and is
"gratefully dead." But I dare say
it has shown some of the true
colors of our "leaders," and of
those hoping to remain so at
Stanford.

Kicking A Dead Issue
Editor:
The whole Grateful Dead issue
has been carried to ridiculous
extremes, and I think most of us
would agree it is now a "dead"
issue. Yet it might be interesting
to note a few things in review.
Mr. Richard Peers originally
complained that he had received a
leaflet, paid for in part by an
endorsed presidential candidate,
which perported to be a thank
you note to us all for passing a
referendum last year. Peers
questioned the political intentions
of it and its authors, Messrs. Van
Petten and Shannon, and
requested clarification.
In response, the Daily printed a
character attack of Peers by a Ms.
Staar, which in its triteness
answered none of his questions,
and added nothing to the
resolution of the question. This
was followed by a somber
response by Van Petten, asking
sympathy for his action and
justifying the leaflet through
references to the numerous
attacks on the A.S.S.U. as a
whole. Again, no response was
made to Peers' question of
political intent, but justification
was given by Van Petten in the
sense that he claimed he was
trying to clear the A.S.S.U.'s
name.
This letter was followed by an
article by Mr. Eric Hemel,
pointing out that this justification
by Van Petten was of
questionable value, as of all the
four Presidents of the A.S.S.U.
only Van Petten was mentioned.
The last installment of this saga
was a letter by our illustrious
President Scott Burke (a man who
thinks it important enough to call
press conferences to announce he
will not seek re-election, and
follows this with an endorsement
of Van Petten), who attacked
Peers and Hemel for their
pettiness. He ended his letter by
claiming that he had not wished
his name on the pamphlet, and
that Hemel and Peers should refer
such charges to the Menlo Park
Nursery School.
It's interesting to note that
through this all, the original
question raised by Peers was never
answered — and I guess we will
have to wait until spring to get
such an answer.
I find it interesting too that
Mr. Burke and company respond
to attacks in the traditional Spiro
Agnew method — i.e., don't
answer the charges but try instead
to assassinate characters
(remember those effete snobs?). It
looks like Mr. Burke, like Mr.
Agnew, prefers this method over
others; and this is one student
who thinks that it's too bad that
politics here at Stanford can't be
more respectable than our
"leaders" here make them.
Indeed, the issue in question
has been overworked and is
"gratefully dead." But I dare say
it has shown some of the true
colors of our "leaders," and of
those hoping to remain so at
Stanford.
