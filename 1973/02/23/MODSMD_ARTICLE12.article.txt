# Free The Stanford Dog
## Canine Catastrophe 
### 
Doyne Farmer

The senior class has seen many
traditions die in the past four
years at Stanford. The noon rallies
at White Plaza to protest war and
oppression have dwindled to
nothing; the Tresidder ice cream
cone for a dime now costs 15
cents. Now another time honored
tradition is on the verge of
extinction: The Stanford Dog is
soon to disappear.
What heinous crimes have these
beasts committed? The principal
one seems to be the mere act of
existence â€” eating, excreting, and
procreating. Sitting outside at
Tresidder during lunch, one
witnesses The Dogs doing all sorts
of revolting things. With ravenous
appetites they dispose of food
that otherwise goes completely to
waste and spread their germs onto
trays that get sterilized anyway.
They disrupt the boredom of
lunch by playing, wagging their
tails, and letting people pet them.
They bark at the Jesus freaks and
101 l in the grass with the street
vendors. They make eating lunch
unpleasant by making it
interesting.
Aerial Menace
Certainly they make it
unpleasant for someone. There
have allegedly been 400 "formal"
complaints about dogs in the past
five years.
1 would like to point out that
there is another menace at
Tresidder that has been
overlooked by these people. Just a
few days ago I was eating lunch at
the Tresidder patio when I felt
something wet and warm splat
onto my head. I put my hand to it
and found it covered with white,
stickv bird shit.

I also noticed these revolting
creatures picking food off of the
trays and slobbering all over them.
I don't recommend that moral
Tresidder lunch eaters be present
for the pornographic circus that
will ensue when bird mating
season comes around.
The Final Solution
Seriously, I know The Stanford
Dog is a nuisance in many ways.
There's no bummer like stepping
on a fece made from nutritious
Tresidder food. But then dogs shit
when they're on a leash just as
much as when they're running
free. As anybody who ever owned
a dog that weighed over forty
pounds knows, when your pooch
decides that dinner is coming out,
you only have a minimal amount
of control over where it lands.
According to last Wednesday's
Daily article, five dozen incidents
of dog bites have been recorded in
the last five years. But were these
caused by strays or by True
Stanford Dogs?

I think a better solution to the
dog problem would be for the dog
catchers to be instructed to leave
licensed Stanford Dogs alone, but
to pick up strays. I don't think it
fair that a noble Stanford Dog
such as Gus, Oscar, or Justice
should be forced onto a leash
because a stray from San Jose gets
the hots for someone's
hamburger.
What can be done to give The
Stanford Dog his freedom back?
Today I registered my
countercom plaint with the
University Ombudsman. If a
petition circulates I'll sign it, and
if I get the time I may even start
one. If I'm eating lunch at
Tresidder and see a dog I know
being hassled by the dog catcher, I
doubt he'll get caught. And I
figure if The Stanford Dog is
going to have to boycott
Tresidder, I may as well do the
same.
