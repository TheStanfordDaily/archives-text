# Opinions Page Policy
## 
### 
Once again, dear friends, the Daily opinions page, in its
perennial aspiration to the lively exchange of significant ideas, is
soliciting articles. Put down this newspaper, leap to your
typewriter, and have at it. We encourage your submission of
letters, articles, and cartoons of every description; everybody
wins a prize.
Technical notes: all letters and articles must be typewritten
and double-spaced on a 62-space line. Space limitations
effectively prevent the publication of letters or articles exceeding
90 typewritten lines; besides, brevity is the soul of wit.
Submissions may be delivered in person or mailed to the Daily,
Storke Student Publications Building, Stanford, California 94305.
