What's going to happen to the bookstore parking lot after the
new Imiv School is completed? I mean, a thirty-car parking lot is
going to look just plain ugly in the middle of this magnificent
new quadrangle the master planners have in mind. D.D. McM.
Master planner Oscar Nelson says that the parking lot was
included in the plans for the new Law School, so the lot will fit
right in on the edge of the plaza created by the Law School,
Meyer Library, and the Stanford Center for Research &
Development in Teaching.
Nelson also said that although the parking lot will not be
eliminated when the Law School is built, the bookstore may use
the parking lot space for expansion purposes.
At this time, plans for expansion of the bookstore are
indefinite, but the bookstore will have to grow eventually.

More information on last Wednesday's question about the
cramped seating in some lecture classrooms:
There are some lecture rooms (for example, Bishop
Auditorium in the Business School) with more space between
rows than the 33" minimum allowed for conventional seating,
according to Principal Projects Planner Gene Kershner. This
arrangement, called continental seating, has a distance of between
18" and 22" from the front of the chairs in one row to the back
of the chairs in the next row, depending on the number of chairs
. in the row. The wider spacing of continental seating increases the
efficient use of space in a large lecture room because the middle
aisle can be eliminated. For this reason, Kershner says that large
lecture halls now being planned, such as the Law School lecture
room and auditorium, will have continental seating.
He says that smaller classrooms will probably continue to be
planned for conventional seating because smaller rooms don't
have center aisles anyway, so space would be used most
efficiently if the chairs were close together.
Venetia Gleason of the Central Room Scheduling office said
that she would "tend to vigorously oppose removing seats (to
provide more leg room) because we have more large classes than
we have rooms for." However, she went on to say that if many
students complained that seating was cramped, something would
have to be done to solve the problem.
In order to find out just how widespread the problem of
cramped seating is, Bug would like you to call if you think a
classroom doesn't have enough room between seats. Phone ext.
4632 and leave your initials, height, and the rooms that you find
crowded.
