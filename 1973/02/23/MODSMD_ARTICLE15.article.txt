# Number Of Undecided Students Rising
## What Are They Doing Here? 
### RICHARD LIPPA 
College educators are becoming
increasingly concerned over the
problem of undecided students.
Many students are spinning
aimlessly through four years of
school and beyond, not sure what
they're doing or where they're
going.
Freshmen find themselves
going to college for all the wrong
reasons; sophomores can't decide
on majors. Seniors aren't prepared
for jobs, and graduate students
doggedly plod on doing what they
know best—going to school.
"Here are these gifted people
who aren't sure what to do with
themselves," says Dr. David
Dorosin, Director of Stanford's
Counseling and Psychological
Services.
The phenomenon is not limited
to Stanford. In a section entitled
"Indecision" the report
Harvard-Radcliffe, The Class of
1972 states: "Perhaps the most
striking trend to emerge from a
year-by-year comparison of the
post-college plans of Harvard
seniors is the considerable
increase, in recent years, in the
number who are undecided about
their future. Five years
ago .. . fewer than eight percent
professed to be uncertain. In the
class of 1972 this uncertainty was
expressed by over 30 percent of
the class."
And even this estimate is
conservative for there were
"hidden undecideds" classified as
looking for employment or going
to graduate or professional
schools. The report later states,

"It is striking . .. that while a
large portion of the seniors are
uncertain of their eventual
vocation, they nevertheless intend
to go on to graduate school."
B.A. Not Terminal
"The depreciation of the
baccalaureate as a terminal
degree" is one of the problems
faced by today's graduates,
according to Dorosin. Liberal arts
graduates who can't find decent
jobs with a B.A. often go on to
graduate and professional schools,
though they are vocationally
uncommitted. Many students are
applying to law school "by
default," Dorosin says.
The Harvard report supports
him: "The volume of applications
to «law schools and medical
schools vastly overstates the
number of students actually

committed to careers in these
fields. Increasing applications have
not been matched by a significant
increase in vocational interest in
these fields."
"The expectancies people have
of themselves" are part of the
problem in a community like
Stanford, contends Dorosin. He
relates a recent joke: "What do
you call a Stanford dropout."
Answer: "A Master's."
Students here have been "told
by family and school that they're
special people," and so there is
often a conflict between what
family and society tell a student
he should be and what he really
wants to be.
Excitement Or Security?
The conflict is heightened
when what a student wants to be
is risky but exciting, while what

he "should be" is secure but dull.
Marion Bairos, a counselor at
Huston House feels that her role is
to "try to help the person look at
himself."
Sometimes, she says, it's useful
to play the devil's advocate when
a student comes down too hard in
favor of either security or risk.
