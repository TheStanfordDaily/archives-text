# FBI Criminal List Set At 10
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The FBl's
list of most wanted fugitives has
leveled off at 10, with more than
half of them political
revolutionaries, and there is no
indication it will be expanded in
the near future.
But there is no reason why it
couldn't, should the need arrive.
"We're not wedded to the
number 10," said Jack E.
Herington, the FBI spokesman.
"We would like to keep it at 10. If
it's necessary, we'll add names to
the list."
The 23-year-old 10 Most
Wanted Fugitives program first
went over 10 in 1961 when
hatchet-killer Richard Marquette
was put on the list. He was
arrested the following day.
In late 1970, however, the FBI
list reached a record high with 16
people, nine of them sought for
such crimes as sabotage and
terrorist acts.
Seven 'Revolutionaries'
The current list, which was
reduced to 10 last summer,
contains the names of seven
so-called political revolutionaries.
Herington said that the
political fugitives have caused the
investigative agency some
problems because they may have
fled the country to a sanctuary
where the U.S. has no jurisdiction,
such as Algeria.
Another problem, he said, is
that the political fugitive doesn't
travel in the same circles as the

traditional bank robber or
murderer whose apprehension
built the reputation of
accomplishment for the FBI.
Different Culture
"They move in a different
culture," he said. "The political
fugitive does not move in the
normal underground system. It
makes it more difficult for us."
On Feb. 17, 1972, Karleton
Lewis Armstrong, one of four
men wanted in connection with a
fatal bombing on the University
of Wisconsin campus, was
captured by Canadian police in
Toronto.
Only one other person on the
then-list of 12 was apprehended
during the year—Byron J. Rice
who had been charged with the
murder of an armored car guard.
He surrendered to FBI agents in
Chicago last Aug. 1.
The newest addition to the
Top 10 list is Mace Brown, a
convicted hired assassin who
participated in an escape from the
District of Columbia jail last fall.
He was put on last Oct. 20.
Charles Lee Herron, one of five
men allegedly involved in the
slaying of one police officer and
the critical wounding of another
in Nashville, Tenn., on Jan. 16,
1968, was placed on the list on
Feb. 9, 1968, and has been on the
longest.
The others are Benjamin H.

Paddock, who escaped from a
federal prison in Texas while
serving a 20-year sentence;
Cameron D. Bishop, charged with
sabotage in the dynamiting of
Colorado power transmission
towers; also, Dwight A.
Armstrong, Leo Burt and David
Fine, all wanted in the Uniersity
of Wisconsin bombing; Bernardine
Dohrn, a self-described
revolutionary Communist and
leader of the Weatherman; and
Susan E. Saxe and Katherine Ann
Power, reputed members of a
radical, revolutionary group
dedicated to attacking the United
States military system and
undermining police powers.

WASHINGTON (AP) - The FBl's
list of most wanted fugitives has
leveled off at 10, with more than
half of them political
revolutionaries, and there is no
indication it will be expanded in
the near future.
But there is no reason why it
couldn't, should the need arrive.
"We're not wedded to the
number 10," said Jack E.
Herington, the FBI spokesman.
"We would like to keep it at 10. If
it's necessary, we'll add names to
the list."
The 23-year-old 10 Most
Wanted Fugitives program first
went over 10 in 1961 when
hatchet-killer Richard Marquette
was put on the list. He was
arrested the following day.
In late 1970, however, the FBI
list reached a record high with 16
people, nine of them sought for
such crimes as sabotage and
terrorist acts.
Seven 'Revolutionaries'
The current list, which was
reduced to 10 last summer,
contains the names of seven
so-called political revolutionaries.
Herington said that the
political fugitives have caused the
investigative agency some
problems because they may have
fled the country to a sanctuary
where the U.S. has no jurisdiction,
such as Algeria.
Another problem, he said, is
that the political fugitive doesn't
travel in the same circles as the

traditional bank robber or
murderer whose apprehension
built the reputation of
accomplishment for the FBI.
Different Culture
"They move in a different
culture," he said. "The political
fugitive does not move in the
normal underground system. It
makes it more difficult for us."
On Feb. 17, 1972, Karleton
Lewis Armstrong, one of four
men wanted in connection with a
fatal bombing on the University
of Wisconsin campus, was
captured by Canadian police in
Toronto.
Only one other person on the
then-list of 12 was apprehended
during the year—Byron J. Rice
who had been charged with the
murder of an armored car guard.
He surrendered to FBI agents in
Chicago last Aug. 1.
The newest addition to the
Top 10 list is Mace Brown, a
convicted hired assassin who
participated in an escape from the
District of Columbia jail last fall.
He was put on last Oct. 20.
Charles Lee Herron, one of five
men allegedly involved in the
slaying of one police officer and
the critical wounding of another
in Nashville, Tenn., on Jan. 16,
1968, was placed on the list on
Feb. 9, 1968, and has been on the
longest.
The others are Benjamin H.

Paddock, who escaped from a
federal prison in Texas while
serving a 20-year sentence;
Cameron D. Bishop, charged with
sabotage in the dynamiting of
Colorado power transmission
towers; also, Dwight A.
Armstrong, Leo Burt and David
Fine, all wanted in the Uniersity
of Wisconsin bombing; Bernardine
Dohrn, a self-described
revolutionary Communist and
leader of the Weatherman; and
Susan E. Saxe and Katherine Ann
Power, reputed members of a
radical, revolutionary group
dedicated to attacking the United
States military system and
undermining police powers.
