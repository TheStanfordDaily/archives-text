# Faculty Senate Resolution Sets Women Hiring Goal
## 
### MARK SIMONIAN 
The Faculty Senate yesterday
adopted a substitute resolution on
affirmative action in graduate studies
programs that provides a "proximal
goal" for the number of women
among new faculty appointees.
The resolution, introduced by
Psychology Prof. Eleanor Maccoby ,
sets the goal as "the current
proportionate representation of
women among new appointees to the
faculty." During a previous Senate
session, Provost William Miller
announced that of 90 new faculty
hired last year, 22 were women,
approximately 30 percent.
Other provisions of the bills include
an annual report of the Faculty
Affirmative Action Officer to the
Senate. The officer will be required to
present the numbers of women faculty
members newly hired and also of those
promoted during the preceding year.
Even though the issue of definite
goals for the number of women
faculty members had been a major
center of controversy in previous
Senate meetings, the Maccoby bill
passed with little opposition.
No Quotas
During yesterday's discussion of the
proposal, Maccoby stressed that her
resolution did not set up a quota for
the University to meet each year, only
a general reference point. She added
that "to get the best people in every
particular instance in each
department," any affirmative action
resolution needed a "degree of
flexibility."
After the meeting, she said that she

was "very pleased" that the Senate
had adopted her resolution, that "it
received a lot of support from the
good people in the Senate."
"Women are still very seriously
underrepresented on the faculty," she
said.
"We can see this from the fact that
there are only two women on the
[Faculty] Senate. I think that the
passage of the resolution means that
the University will continue to be
serious about affirmative action."
Vice Provost for Faculty Affairs
Arthur Bienenstock, the Faculty
Affirmative Action Officer, was also
pleased that the faculty took action.
'Faculty Commitment'
He stated that the adoption of the
Maccoby bill represented "a faculty
commitment" to increasing the
number of women in the faculty, and
that his annual reports to the Senate
will help keep faculty members
involved with affirmative action issues.
Bienenstock also cited public
advertising for faculty positions as a
possible side-effect of today's Senate
vote.
In other Senate business, faculty
representatives reviewed the budget
guidelines for the 1973-74 academic
year. Provost Miller, Vice President for
Business and Finance Robert
Augsburger, and Vice Provost for
Budget and Planning Raymond
Bacchetti introduced the new budget
and answered questions about effects
on the University. Specific budget
figures will be released after the Board
of Trustees considers them at its
March meeting.
