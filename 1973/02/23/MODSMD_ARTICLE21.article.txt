# Bill To Decriminalize Marijuana Introduced

### 
SACRAMENTO (AP) - The
growth and use of marijuana—but
not its sale—would be legalized in
California under a bill introduced
by a Los Angeles legislator.
Assemblyman Henry A.
Waxman, D—Los Angeles, said his
bill, introduced yesterday, was
virtually identical to Prop. 19,
voted down by a 2-1 margin last
November. It would, said
Waxman, "remove from state law
all penalties for possession and
personal use of marijuana."
It would not, however, affect
federal law which also bars the use

and possession of marijuana.
Presumably, however, federal
agencies would not be able to
provide general enforcement of
those laws without the
participation of state and local
agencies.
Waxman acknowledged that
most voters had opposed
the measure but said he introduced
the bill so that "the process of
educating Californians about the
realities as opposed to the myths
of marijuana, would continue in
the legislature." The bill is AB
376.
