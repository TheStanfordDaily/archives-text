## RDT Approaches New Nadir 
### RUST EDDIE 
Despite Richard Watts, Jr.'s
contention that "It's always a
mistake for a reviewer to state
flatly that something or other
represents the lowest point in his
theatregoing experience because
he can't know what horrors the
immediate future holds for him,"
Utah Repertory Dance Theater
recklessly approached the nadir
Friday evening at Stanford's
Memorial Auditorium.
Some companies arrive with a
bang, some with a whisper and
some, often the best of them,
offer a hope. Offering applications
for seven different '73 workshops
but little hope, R.D.T.
unabashedly states in their
program that they are the ideal
company to represent American
dance throughout the nation and
the world. Poor America.

Perhaps the company has
extended theatrics beyond the
stage, for as a repertory company
with no director (members make
decisions by consensus) and first
(in 1966) to be in permanent
residence at a university (with
seven dancers holding MFA or
BFA degrees in dance), R.D.T.
further individualized by camping
outside the New York area.
In its first of two Stanford
appearances, the company began
Friday's program with Tim
Wengerd's "Chant," a pas-de-six
pastiche of Martha Graham,
Yuriko, Viola Farber and Merce
Cunningham's styles. The score,
for bells and rattles, was by John
Cage, a Cunningham regular.
Less Than Enthusiastic
Three chiaroscurist couples in
pale and muted vertically striped
tights plumbed the plastic

properties of the human body.
Timed push, pull, stretch, and
bend movements served as
dancing. I noted some innovation
in "Chant," but fell short of
jumping through any roof in
enthusiasm.
Kay Clark's "Footprint"
required three dancers set to a
violin and piano score composed
by Morton Feldman. Danced
before a dappled backdrop of
Lennon's "Imagine" album cover,
the ethereal theme was repeated
in the costumes.
Miss Clark, striving to
overcome the tie-dyed camouflage
handicap, used a wide vocabulary
of movement which draws
alternately on Farber or
Cunningham for inspiration.
"The Brood," by one time
Martha Graham solist, Richard
Kuch, was one of the evenings

stronger offerings. The theme
originates in Brecht's "Mother
Courage," with choreographer
Kuch postdating the action some
15 years. The story is dark to the
point of overcast: Mother
Courage, still drawing her wagon

in pursuit of war, is haunted by
ghosts of her three children.
Farber's "Passengers" was
essentially in the Cunningham
mold, de-totalized with a
modicum of sets: No scenery, no
score. Following a time sequence
from stopwatches offstage, the
dancers are allowed to juggle the
independent variables; energy,
timing, and space within 19
sections which can be arranged
differently.
Performer-choreographer Bill
Evans contributed the final, and
perhaps, most inventive work,
"Tin-Tal." The piece has a score

for tabla, sarod and tamboura by
Mahapurush Misra and sculpture
by Barrell.
As do many young
choreographers, Evans clings to
the music with the brashness of a
drowning man regarding his last

straw.
However, once having accepted
that his musical approach is less
than subtle, you can see in this
plotless work a considerable and
very happy competence. Evans
knows the way dancers move, and
this is an art that not every
choreographer possesses.
'Tin-Tal" is lithely and
blithely danced, a credit to any
repertory, but the company's
total repertoire is not, however,
one which puts down roots into
dance history. Yet R.D.T. can
take heart—their evening of toil
was not unentertaining.
