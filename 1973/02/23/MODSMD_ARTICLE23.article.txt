### JEFFREY GREENWALD LISA WEGER 
Gene Barry, after his
performance Thursday night as
Tevye in "Fiddler on the Roof" at
the Circle Star Theatre, returned
to the round stage to assail the
critics of the San Francisco
Chronicle and the Palo Alto Times
who reviewed the past two night
performances.
Barry shouted, "You can't say
the lights were bad, the sound was
bad. The important thing was that
the people loved it. We performed
to people the first and second
nights who gave us standing

ovations."
Barry remarked in an interview
after the play that the company
had had only six days to rehearse
and memorize their lines because
of certain union rules.
"The reviewers are out to get
me," he confided, "they only like
big acts like Sammy Davis Jr.
They (the critics) treat us like a
national repertory theatre. We only
had six days to rehearse this play.
I have always wanted to be Tevye
ever since "Fiddler" came on
Broadway ten years ago, I would
have done it for nothing if they
had asked me."

Barry, understandably angered
by the critical reviews, gave a
sparkling performance with his
real-life wife Betty Barry, as
Golde. The story of a poor
dairyman, his wife, and their five
daughters was portrayed skillfully,
bringing out passionate feelings
and emotions that the movie
"Fiddler on the Roof" did not
convey. Outstanding performance
by Honey Sanders, as the
Matchmaker, and Alfred DeSio, as
Motel the tailor, added to the
genuiness of the production.
The colorful crowd scenes,
with excellent choreography
which was adapted especially to
the round stage, were magnificent.
The final scene of the Jews leaving
their Russian village of Anatevka
climaxed a most enjoyable
presentation.
Even if you have seen the
movie, go see the play "Fiddler on
the Roof" in San Carlos. It
continues through the 25th of
February.
