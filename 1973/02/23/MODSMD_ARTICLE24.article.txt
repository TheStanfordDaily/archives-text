# 'Albert Herring' Opens
## 
### 
The departments of music and
drama are cooperating in the
production of Benjamin Britten's
"Albert Herring," to be presented
at 8 tonight, tomorrow and March
1-3 in Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
John Barnett, the director of
the Los Angeles Guild Opera
Company, is the production's
music director, John
Olon-Scrymgeour of the Drama
Department is stage director, and
Stanford's principal voice teacher,
Marie Gibson, is in charge of vocal
preparation.
Heading the cast are Nile
Norton as Albert Herring; Lorna
Castaneda and Carole Klein
alternating as Nancy, the girl from

the bakery; Anthony Antolini as
Sid the butcher boy; Michele
Miland and Gail Wilson as the
moral watchdog, Lady Billows;
and Robert Bernard as
Superintendent Budd. All except
one of the performers are
Stanford students.
"Albert Herring" shares the
theme of chastity with its musical
companion piece, Britten's "The
Rape of Lucretia." In "Albert,"
however, the theme is turned to
comic effect, as this witty opera
pokes fun at the mores of a small
East Suffolk market town at the
turn of the century.
Tickets are $1.50-$3.50, with
50 cents off for students.
