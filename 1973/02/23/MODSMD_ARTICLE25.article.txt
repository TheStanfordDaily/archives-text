# Chilkat Dancers To Perform
## 
### 
The Chilkat Dancers, a Tlingit Indian group from Alaska, will
perform in Memorial Auditorium at 8 p.m. tomorrow.
The Chilkat group's dances tell stories from the tribe's history.
They feature artifacts such as drums, rattles, masks and native dress,
some of them replicas of originals now in the Smithsonian Institute.
Two Stanford students, both Tlingits, will dance with them in
tribal rituals and story-telling dances. A narrator will explain each.
The students are Carl Smith, a senior from Haines, Alaska, and
Cathy See, a freshman from Hoonah. Both villages are near Juneau.
Smith's purpose in presenting the dancers at Stanford is to show
other native Americans and the general public some samples of the
Alaskan Indian culture.
Tickets are $2 general, $1 for students.
