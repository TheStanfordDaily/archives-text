## Hamada's Insights, Enthusiasm Guide Gymnasts 
### PHIL HUBBARD 
Last spring, Stanford
gymnastics coach Dan Millman
quietly packed his bags and
moved to a new position at
Oberlin College in Ohio. His
sudden departure left the athletic
department in a dilemma. There
were few coaches available
qualified to replace him, and the
excellent team he had built up
over the last four years was in
contention for the Pac-8 and
NCAA titles, if only the right
mentor could be found to lead it.
On Acting Athletic Director
Bob Young's shoulders fell the
responsibility of Gnding a new
head coach over the summer, and
with a limited budget, he had
little to offer except the prestige
of the position. According to
Millman, who stayed around a few
extra weeks to help Young choose
his successor, they looked around
and compiled a list of 10 or so
possibilities. "We finally narrowed
the list down to three individuals
who were definitely interested
and highly skilled Paul Ziert
from Illinois, Yoshi Hayasaki
from Indiana, and Sadao Hamada
of Kent State."
Hamada had a short interview
with Young early in the summer,
but didn't think Stanford was that
interested in him, so he flew back
to Kent. "I got a phone call one

evening from Mr. Young," Sadao
remembers, "and he told me if I
was still interested in the job, I'd
better get back to Stanford—fast.
I was on the plane the next
morning." Within a week,
Stanford had a new gymnastics
coach.
Packed Solid
Sadao Hamada is 5-7 and 145
lbs., packed solid with the muscle
of over ten years of continuous
gymnastics competition. His mild
accent recalls the fact that he
spent his first 22 years in his
homeland of Japan.
Mayasuki Watanabe, a friend
and former coach from his
hometown, now an assistant
coach at Berkeley, said of him,
"Sadao tries to be happy in
everything he does. He approaches
everything in a positive way,
always confident that everything
will turn out all right in the end."
Sadao's interest in athletics
began long before he took his first
swing on a high bar. He was born
in Kochi, Japan, 26 years ago, and
grew up in a family with two
sisters. He was quite active even as
a child, and because he had no
brothers to play with, went into
organized sports early.
In elementary school, Sadao
was primarily a swimmer. In
junior high, his interest shifted to
volleyball, and he competed a

couple of years for his school
team before an untimely knee
injury forced him into early
retirement.
With his injured knee, Hamada
felt he could no longer play a
good game of volleyball, so he
began looking around for another
sport to try in high school. A
cousin of his who was four years
older had gotten into gymnastics
and become rather good. Sadao
talked to him, watched him, and
finally decided to try the sport.
Mistake
Hamada figured the stretching
and more controlled movements
of gymnastics would help his knee
recover faster. "That was a
mistake," he said later. "There
was a lot of tumbling and I had to
run everyday."
Eventually, though, the knee
healed, and throughout his high
school years, he continued to
build himself into a respectable
gymnast. By the time graduation
came around, he had decided on a
career in gymnastics. He applied
to Nippon College of Health and
Physical Education at Tokyo, and
after passing an academic and
rigorous physical skill test, was
accepted for the fall of 1965.
Nippon College is a true "jock"
school that makes U.S. football
factories appear like ivory towers
in comparison. There are 5,000
students—all of whom are physical
education major. Nearly 500 of
these are gymnasts, only nine of
whom are allowed to compete on
the school's team.
"I would get up at 5:00 a.m.
and do some heavy stretching
before breakfast. During the day I
worked five or six, occasionally
even seven or eight hours on the
apparatus,," Sadao said of his
days at Nippon. "Many of us went
to class in our sweats or gym
shorts. In between classes, even if
I had only five minutes or so, I
would rush down to the gym and
take a few swings on the high bar
or something."
Interpreter
During his final year at
Nippon, when Sadao finally made
the top nine, an American high
school gymnast was visiting the
campus to learn about Japanese
gymnastics, and Sadao, who knew
a little English at the time, acted
as his interpreter. The visitor
talked to Sadao about the
possibility of coming over to Kent
State for graduate work in
gymnastics. Sadao applied and
was accepted as a "special
student," meaning he had to take
courses in English for foreign
students and pass a comprehensive
exam before being admitted on a
regular basis.
Hamada and his friend,
Watanabe, came over the U.S. in
the spring of 1969. In April they

participated in two competitions,
the Pasadena City College and
Long Beach Invitational Meets. In
the Long Beach meet, Sadao was
second in the all-around to a high
school star named Steve Hug, now
Stanford's number one performer.
Sadao's first year at Kent was
spent learning the American
language firsthand to supplement
the "school-book English" he had
learned in high school and college.
He worked in the cafeteria and
picked up American slang from
the girls there. "They said I was
'obnoxious' and called me a 'sexy
little devil,' " he said, grinning.
Painful Injury
In the fall of 1971, Sadao
suffered a setback when he
injured his achilles tendon during
a routine.
Although the injury was severe,
Sadao refused to let it get him
down. He continued to work out,
ignoring the pain. In the spring of
'72, after only eight months of
recuperation, he managed to take
third in the AAU and U.S.
Gymnastics Federation all-around
competitions. The previous two
years he had been second in the
AAU all-around.
After leaving Kent State last
spring, Sadao came to the Bay
Area to teach summer physical
education to a group of girls at
Tamalpias High School in Marin
County. He brought with him a
high school star from Ohio he had
been coaching for the past year or
so, who he hopes can come to
Stanford next year. The two were
working out at Berkeley, when
they ran into Millman and Ted
Miyamoto, a member of the
Stanford team. They talked for
awhile, and Millman later
suggested to Bob Young that he
consider Sadao for the coaching
position.
Young And Talented
Sadao had the unique
opportunity to take over a team
that was young and already very
talented. Through heavy
recruiting the past few years,
Millman had managed to grab a
good deal of the gymnastic talent
that was coming out of American
high schools, including two-time
Olympian Steve Hug, two-time
AAU sidehorse champion Ted
Marcy, and 1971 all-around leader
in high school Bob Anderson.
So far this year, Stanford has
beaten Cal State Fullerton, Chico
State, and UCLA for dual meets
and came in second behind 1972
NCAA champion Southern Illinois
in a quadrangular competition,
losing by less than a point. That
alone is an excellent record for a
first year coach, but Sadao feels
the team could go all the way.
"We weren't ready for SIU. I
don't look on the regular season
meets as being that important.

We're looking forward to the
Pac-8 and NCAA."
Although Sadao is coaching
full time, here during the day and
at Burlingame in the evening, he
still tries to stay in shape by
working out and stretching an
hour or so each day. He
tentatively plans to enter the
AAU meet again this year after

the regular season is over. "I like
to perform myself," he said. "It's
easier for me—coaching is much
more difficult."
The fact that Hamada, like
Millman, is young and still a top
level performer seems to have a
positive effect on the team.
Shawn Skerrett, a junior vaulting
specialist who also competes in
several other events, believes that
"young coaches are better than
older ones. The sport has changed
so rapidly in the past few years
that you have to be a performer
to be able to feel what's
happening."
'He Guides Us'
Ted Marcy, who was Hamada's
roommate at the AAU meet last

year, and defeated his coach on
the side horse, commented, "He
knows gymnastics better than
anyone else on the team because
he's studied it, both as a
performer and as a coach. The
coach I had in high school was a
real hard driver, but Sadao doesn't
force us, he guides us."
Steve Hug agreed Hamada was

similar to Millman in that respect.
"Both Sadao and Dan place less
emphasis on winning and more on
learning. They don't want to be
authority figures."
As well as winning the respect
of his team, Sadao also seems to
have won their friendship in the
past few months. Having just
gotten out of school, he
understands contemporary college
life better than most coaches do.
Unlike Millman, who had a wife
and daughter, Hamada is a
bachelor, who lives alone in an
apartment in Palo Alto. He is
much closer to the team outside
the gym than most coaches. "He
goes out to dinner with us," said
Skerrett, "and he'll drop by

people's rooms now and then just
to see what's happening."
Sadao's coaching philosophy is
basically traditional Japanese,
interspersed with ideas and
techniques he has picked up over
here. He explained his feelings as
he leaned back in a chair in his
office. "Gymnastics should be
fun, but it is also hard work. It
involves hours and hours of
training—sprained finger, ripped
hand, sore aching body. We work
so hard to make it look so easy.
The best way to become a
champion is to work slowly, over
several years, but most Americans
are too impatient for that. They
put together a technically good
routine and specialize, so they can
score high early.
'Typical American athletes
seem a little lazy to me. When the
season ends and it gets warm
outside, I don't know how many
of the guys will keep coming to
the gym. I'd like to think they'll
all be there. If they work out and
stretch in the spring, there won't
be injuries next winter. Personally
I want to make Olympians or at
least international class gymnasts
out of these guys.'
The only thing definite about
Sadao's plans for the future is that
they will revolve around the sport
he loves. "My life will be coaching
gymnastics," he said. "I don't
have a goal just yet, but I always
think my responsibility is to make
the best gymnasts possible."

'He Guides Us'
Ted Marcy, who was Hamada's
roommate at the AAU meet last

year, and defeated his coach on
the side horse, commented, "He
knows gymnastics better than
anyone else on the team because
he's studied it, both as a
performer and as a coach. The
coach I had in high school was a
real hard driver, but Sadao doesn't
force us, he guides us."
Steve Hug agreed Hamada was

similar to Millman in that respect.
"Both Sadao and Dan place less
emphasis on winning and more on
learning. They don't want to be
authority figures."
As well as winning the respect
of his team, Sadao also seems to
have won their friendship in the
past few months. Having just
gotten out of school, he
understands contemporary college
life better than most coaches do.
Unlike Millman, who had a wife
and daughter, Hamada is a
bachelor, who lives alone in an
apartment in Palo Alto. He is
much closer to the team outside
the gym than most coaches. "He
goes out to dinner with us," said
Skerrett, "and he'll drop by

people's rooms now and then just
to see what's happening."
Sadao's coaching philosophy is
basically traditional Japanese,
interspersed with ideas and
techniques he has picked up over
here. He explained his feelings as
he leaned back in a chair in his
office. "Gymnastics should be
fun, but it is also hard work. It
involves hours and hours of
training—sprained finger, ripped
hand, sore aching body. We work
so hard to make it look so easy.
The best way to become a
champion is to work slowly, over
several years, but most Americans
are too impatient for that. They
put together a technically good
routine and specialize, so they can
score high early.
'Typical American athletes
seem a little lazy to me. When the
season ends and it gets warm
outside, I don't know how many
of the guys will keep coming to
the gym. I'd like to think they'll
all be there. If they work out and
stretch in the spring, there won't
be injuries next winter. Personally
I want to make Olympians or at
least international class gymnasts
out of these guys.'
The only thing definite about
Sadao's plans for the future is that
they will revolve around the sport
he loves. "My life will be coaching
gymnastics," he said. "I don't
have a goal just yet, but I always
think my responsibility is to make
the best gymnasts possible."

THE COACH PERFORMS—First year gymnastics coach Sadao
Hamada performs an exhibition on the paralel bars during Stanford's
meet against UCLA. Hamada has twice finished second in the national
AAU all-around competition.
Last spring, Stanford
gymnastics coach Dan Millman
quietly packed his bags and
moved to a new position at
Oberlin College in Ohio. His
sudden departure left the athletic
department in a dilemma. There
were few coaches available
qualified to replace him, and the
excellent team he had built up
over the last four years was in
contention for the Pac-8 and
NCAA titles, if only the right
mentor could be found to lead it.
On Acting Athletic Director
Bob Young's shoulders fell the
responsibility of Gnding a new
head coach over the summer, and
with a limited budget, he had
little to offer except the prestige
of the position. According to
Millman, who stayed around a few
extra weeks to help Young choose
his successor, they looked around
and compiled a list of 10 or so
possibilities. "We finally narrowed
the list down to three individuals
who were definitely interested
and highly skilled Paul Ziert
from Illinois, Yoshi Hayasaki
from Indiana, and Sadao Hamada
of Kent State."
Hamada had a short interview
with Young early in the summer,
but didn't think Stanford was that
interested in him, so he flew back
to Kent. "I got a phone call one

evening from Mr. Young," Sadao
remembers, "and he told me if I
was still interested in the job, I'd
better get back to Stanford—fast.
I was on the plane the next
morning." Within a week,
Stanford had a new gymnastics
coach.
Packed Solid
Sadao Hamada is 5-7 and 145
lbs., packed solid with the muscle
of over ten years of continuous
gymnastics competition. His mild
accent recalls the fact that he
spent his first 22 years in his
homeland of Japan.
Mayasuki Watanabe, a friend
and former coach from his
hometown, now an assistant
coach at Berkeley, said of him,
"Sadao tries to be happy in
everything he does. He approaches
everything in a positive way,
always confident that everything
will turn out all right in the end."
Sadao's interest in athletics
began long before he took his first
swing on a high bar. He was born
in Kochi, Japan, 26 years ago, and
grew up in a family with two
sisters. He was quite active even as
a child, and because he had no
brothers to play with, went into
organized sports early.
In elementary school, Sadao
was primarily a swimmer. In
junior high, his interest shifted to
volleyball, and he competed a

couple of years for his school
team before an untimely knee
injury forced him into early
retirement.
With his injured knee, Hamada
felt he could no longer play a
good game of volleyball, so he
began looking around for another
sport to try in high school. A
cousin of his who was four years
older had gotten into gymnastics
and become rather good. Sadao
talked to him, watched him, and
finally decided to try the sport.
Mistake
Hamada figured the stretching
and more controlled movements
of gymnastics would help his knee
recover faster. "That was a
mistake," he said later. "There
was a lot of tumbling and I had to
run everyday."
Eventually, though, the knee
healed, and throughout his high
school years, he continued to
build himself into a respectable
gymnast. By the time graduation
came around, he had decided on a
career in gymnastics. He applied
to Nippon College of Health and
Physical Education at Tokyo, and
after passing an academic and
rigorous physical skill test, was
accepted for the fall of 1965.
Nippon College is a true "jock"
school that makes U.S. football
factories appear like ivory towers
in comparison. There are 5,000
students—all of whom are physical
education major. Nearly 500 of
these are gymnasts, only nine of
whom are allowed to compete on
the school's team.
"I would get up at 5:00 a.m.
and do some heavy stretching
before breakfast. During the day I
worked five or six, occasionally
even seven or eight hours on the
apparatus,," Sadao said of his
days at Nippon. "Many of us went
to class in our sweats or gym
shorts. In between classes, even if
I had only five minutes or so, I
would rush down to the gym and
take a few swings on the high bar
or something."
Interpreter
During his final year at
Nippon, when Sadao finally made
the top nine, an American high
school gymnast was visiting the
campus to learn about Japanese
gymnastics, and Sadao, who knew
a little English at the time, acted
as his interpreter. The visitor
talked to Sadao about the
possibility of coming over to Kent
State for graduate work in
gymnastics. Sadao applied and
was accepted as a "special
student," meaning he had to take
courses in English for foreign
students and pass a comprehensive
exam before being admitted on a
regular basis.
Hamada and his friend,
Watanabe, came over the U.S. in
the spring of 1969. In April they

participated in two competitions,
the Pasadena City College and
Long Beach Invitational Meets. In
the Long Beach meet, Sadao was
second in the all-around to a high
school star named Steve Hug, now
Stanford's number one performer.
Sadao's first year at Kent was
spent learning the American
language firsthand to supplement
the "school-book English" he had
learned in high school and college.
He worked in the cafeteria and
picked up American slang from
the girls there. "They said I was
'obnoxious' and called me a 'sexy
little devil,' " he said, grinning.
Painful Injury
In the fall of 1971, Sadao
suffered a setback when he
injured his achilles tendon during
a routine.
Although the injury was severe,
Sadao refused to let it get him
down. He continued to work out,
ignoring the pain. In the spring of
'72, after only eight months of
recuperation, he managed to take
third in the AAU and U.S.
Gymnastics Federation all-around
competitions. The previous two
years he had been second in the
AAU all-around.
After leaving Kent State last
spring, Sadao came to the Bay
Area to teach summer physical
education to a group of girls at
Tamalpias High School in Marin
County. He brought with him a
high school star from Ohio he had
been coaching for the past year or
so, who he hopes can come to
Stanford next year. The two were
working out at Berkeley, when
they ran into Millman and Ted
Miyamoto, a member of the
Stanford team. They talked for
awhile, and Millman later
suggested to Bob Young that he
consider Sadao for the coaching
position.
Young And Talented
Sadao had the unique
opportunity to take over a team
that was young and already very
talented. Through heavy
recruiting the past few years,
Millman had managed to grab a
good deal of the gymnastic talent
that was coming out of American
high schools, including two-time
Olympian Steve Hug, two-time
AAU sidehorse champion Ted
Marcy, and 1971 all-around leader
in high school Bob Anderson.
So far this year, Stanford has
beaten Cal State Fullerton, Chico
State, and UCLA for dual meets
and came in second behind 1972
NCAA champion Southern Illinois
in a quadrangular competition,
losing by less than a point. That
alone is an excellent record for a
first year coach, but Sadao feels
the team could go all the way.
"We weren't ready for SIU. I
don't look on the regular season
meets as being that important.

We're looking forward to the
Pac-8 and NCAA."
Although Sadao is coaching
full time, here during the day and
at Burlingame in the evening, he
still tries to stay in shape by
working out and stretching an
hour or so each day. He
tentatively plans to enter the
AAU meet again this year after

the regular season is over. "I like
to perform myself," he said. "It's
easier for me—coaching is much
more difficult."
The fact that Hamada, like
Millman, is young and still a top
level performer seems to have a
positive effect on the team.
Shawn Skerrett, a junior vaulting
specialist who also competes in
several other events, believes that
"young coaches are better than
older ones. The sport has changed
so rapidly in the past few years
that you have to be a performer
to be able to feel what's
happening."
'He Guides Us'
Ted Marcy, who was Hamada's

Sadao refused to let it get him
down. He continued to work out,
ignoring the pain. In the spring of
'72, after only eight months of
recuperation, he managed to take
third in the AAU and U.S.
Gymnastics Federation all-around
competitions. The previous two
years he had been second in the
AAU all-around.
After leaving Kent State last
spring, Sadao came to the Bay
Area to teach summer physical
education to a group of girls at
Tamalpias High School in Marin
County. He brought with him a
high school star from Ohio he had
been coaching for the past year or
so, who he hopes can come to
Stanford next year. The two were
working out at Berkeley, when
they ran into Millman and Ted
Miyamoto, a member of the
Stanford team. They talked for
awhile, and Millman later
suggested to Bob Young that he
consider Sadao for the coaching
position.
Young And Talented
Sadao had the unique
opportunity to take over a team
that was young and already very
talented. Through heavy
recruiting the past few years,
Millman had managed to grab a
good deal of the gymnastic talent
that was coming out of American
high schools, including two-time
Olympian Steve Hug, two-time
AAU sidehorse champion Ted
Marcy, and 1971 all-around leader
in high school Bob Anderson.
So far this year, Stanford has
beaten Cal State Fullerton, Chico
State, and UCLA for dual meets
and came in second behind 1972
NCAA champion Southern Illinois
in a quadrangular competition,
losing by less than a point. That
alone is an excellent record for a
first year coach, but Sadao feels
the team could go all the way.
"We weren't ready for SIU. I
don't look on the regular season
meets as being that important.

We're looking forward to the
Pac-8 and NCAA."
Although Sadao is coaching
full time, here during the day and
at Burlingame in the evening, he
still tries to stay in shape by
working out and stretching an
hour or so each day. He
tentatively plans to enter the
AAU meet again this year after

the regular season is over. "I like
to perform myself," he said. "It's
easier for me—coaching is much
more difficult."
The fact that Hamada, like
Millman, is young and still a top
level performer seems to have a
positive effect on the team.
Shawn Skerrett, a junior vaulting
specialist who also competes in
several other events, believes that
"young coaches are better than
older ones. The sport has changed
so rapidly in the past few years
that you have to be a performer
to be able to feel what's
happening."
'He Guides Us'
Ted Marcy, who was Hamada's
roommate at the AAU meet last

year, and defeated his coach on
the side horse, commented, "He
knows gymnastics better than
anyone else on the team because
he's studied it, both as a
performer and as a coach. The
coach I had in high school was a
real hard driver, but Sadao doesn't
force us, he guides us."
Steve Hug agreed Hamada was

similar to Millman in that respect.
"Both Sadao and Dan place less
emphasis on winning and more on
learning. They don't want to be
authority figures."
As well as winning the respect
of his team, Sadao also seems to
have won their friendship in the
past few months. Having just
gotten out of school, he
understands contemporary college
life better than most coaches do.
Unlike Millman, who had a wife
and daughter, Hamada is a
bachelor, who lives alone in an
apartment in Palo Alto. He is
much closer to the team outside
the gym than most coaches. "He
goes out to dinner with us," said
Skerrett, "and he'll drop by

people's rooms now and then just
to see what's happening."
Sadao's coaching philosophy is
basically traditional Japanese,
interspersed with ideas and
techniques he has picked up over
here. He explained his feelings as
he leaned back in a chair in his
office. "Gymnastics should be
fun, but it is also hard work. It
involves hours and hours of
training—sprained finger, ripped
hand, sore aching body. We work
so hard to make it look so easy.
The best way to become a
champion is to work slowly, over
several years, but most Americans
are too impatient for that. They
put together a technically good
routine and specialize, so they can
score high early.
'Typical American athletes
seem a little lazy to me. When the
season ends and it gets warm
outside, I don't know how many
of the guys will keep coming to
the gym. I'd like to think they'll
all be there. If they work out and
stretch in the spring, there won't
be injuries next winter. Personally
I want to make Olympians or at
least international class gymnasts
out of these guys.'
The only thing definite about
Sadao's plans for the future is that
they will revolve around the sport
he loves. "My life will be coaching
gymnastics," he said. "I don't
have a goal just yet, but I always
think my responsibility is to make
the best gymnasts possible."

THE COACH PERFORMS—First year gymnastics coach Sadao
Hamada performs an exhibition on the paralel bars during Stanford's
meet against UCLA. Hamada has twice finished second in the national
AAU all-around competition.
Last spring, Stanford
gymnastics coach Dan Millman
quietly packed his bags and
moved to a new position at
Oberlin College in Ohio. His
sudden departure left the athletic
department in a dilemma. There
were few coaches available
qualified to replace him, and the
excellent team he had built up
over the last four years was in
contention for the Pac-8 and
NCAA titles, if only the right
mentor could be found to lead it.
On Acting Athletic Director
Bob Young's shoulders fell the
responsibility of Gnding a new
head coach over the summer, and
with a limited budget, he had
little to offer except the prestige
of the position. According to
Millman, who stayed around a few
extra weeks to help Young choose
his successor, they looked around
and compiled a list of 10 or so
possibilities. "We finally narrowed
the list down to three individuals
who were definitely interested
and highly skilled Paul Ziert
from Illinois, Yoshi Hayasaki
from Indiana, and Sadao Hamada
of Kent State."
Hamada had a short interview
with Young early in the summer,
but didn't think Stanford was that
interested in him, so he flew back
to Kent. "I got a phone call one

evening from Mr. Young," Sadao
remembers, "and he told me if I
was still interested in the job, I'd
better get back to Stanford—fast.
I was on the plane the next
morning." Within a week,
Stanford had a new gymnastics
coach.
Packed Solid
Sadao Hamada is 5-7 and 145
lbs., packed solid with the muscle
of over ten years of continuous
gymnastics competition. His mild
accent recalls the fact that he
spent his first 22 years in his
homeland of Japan.
Mayasuki Watanabe, a friend
and former coach from his
hometown, now an assistant
coach at Berkeley, said of him,
"Sadao tries to be happy in
everything he does. He approaches
everything in a positive way,
always confident that everything
will turn out all right in the end."
Sadao's interest in athletics
began long before he took his first
swing on a high bar. He was born
in Kochi, Japan, 26 years ago, and
grew up in a family with two
sisters. He was quite active even as
a child, and because he had no
brothers to play with, went into
organized sports early.
In elementary school, Sadao
was primarily a swimmer. In
junior high, his interest shifted to
volleyball, and he competed a

couple of years for his school
team before an untimely knee
injury forced him into early
retirement.
With his injured knee, Hamada
felt he could no longer play a
good game of volleyball, so he
began looking around for another
sport to try in high school. A
cousin of his who was four years
older had gotten into gymnastics
and become rather good. Sadao
talked to him, watched him, and
finally decided to try the sport.
Mistake
Hamada figured the stretching
and more controlled movements
of gymnastics would help his knee
recover faster. "That was a
mistake," he said later. "There
was a lot of tumbling and I had to
run everyday."
Eventually, though, the knee
healed, and throughout his high
school years, he continued to
build himself into a respectable
gymnast. By the time graduation
came around, he had decided on a
career in gymnastics. He applied
to Nippon College of Health and
Physical Education at Tokyo, and
after passing an academic and
rigorous physical skill test, was
accepted for the fall of 1965.
Nippon College is a true "jock"
school that makes U.S. football
factories appear like ivory towers
in comparison. There are 5,000
students—all of whom are physical
education major. Nearly 500 of
these are gymnasts, only nine of
whom are allowed to compete on
the school's team.
"I would get up at 5:00 a.m.
and do some heavy stretching
before breakfast. During the day I
worked five or six, occasionally
even seven or eight hours on the
apparatus,," Sadao said of his
days at Nippon. "Many of us went
to class in our sweats or gym
shorts. In between classes, even if
I had only five minutes or so, I
would rush down to the gym and
take a few swings on the high bar
or something."
Interpreter
During his final year at
Nippon, when Sadao finally made
the top nine, an American high
school gymnast was visiting the
campus to learn about Japanese
gymnastics, and Sadao, who knew
a little English at the time, acted
as his interpreter. The visitor
talked to Sadao about the
possibility of coming over to Kent
State for graduate work in
gymnastics. Sadao applied and
was accepted as a "special
student," meaning he had to take
courses in English for foreign
students and pass a comprehensive
exam before being admitted on a
regular basis.
Hamada and his friend,
Watanabe, came over the U.S. in
the spring of 1969. In April they

participated in two competitions,
the Pasadena City College and
Long Beach Invitational Meets. In
the Long Beach meet, Sadao was
second in the all-around to a high
school star named Steve Hug, now
Stanford's number one performer.
Sadao's first year at Kent was
spent learning the American
language firsthand to supplement
the "school-book English" he had
learned in high school and college.
He worked in the cafeteria and
picked up American slang from
the girls there. "They said I was
'obnoxious' and called me a 'sexy
little devil,' " he said, grinning.
Painful Injury
In the fall of 1971, Sadao
suffered a setback when he
injured his achilles tendon during
a routine.
Although the injury was severe,
Sadao refused to let it get him
down. He continued to work out,
ignoring the pain. In the spring of
'72, after only eight months of
recuperation, he managed to take
third in the AAU and U.S.
Gymnastics Federation all-around
competitions. The previous two
years he had been second in the
AAU all-around.

was a lot of tumbling and I had to
run everyday."
Eventually, though, the knee
healed, and throughout his high
school years, he continued to
build himself into a respectable
gymnast. By the time graduation
came around, he had decided on a
career in gymnastics. He applied
to Nippon College of Health and
Physical Education at Tokyo, and
after passing an academic and
rigorous physical skill test, was
accepted for the fall of 1965.
Nippon College is a true "jock"
school that makes U.S. football
factories appear like ivory towers
in comparison. There are 5,000
students—all of whom are physical
education major. Nearly 500 of
these are gymnasts, only nine of
whom are allowed to compete on
the school's team.
"I would get up at 5:00 a.m.
and do some heavy stretching
before breakfast. During the day I
worked five or six, occasionally
even seven or eight hours on the
apparatus,," Sadao said of his
days at Nippon. "Many of us went
to class in our sweats or gym
shorts. In between classes, even if
I had only five minutes or so, I
would rush down to the gym and
take a few swings on the high bar
or something."
Interpreter
During his final year at
Nippon, when Sadao finally made
the top nine, an American high
school gymnast was visiting the
campus to learn about Japanese
gymnastics, and Sadao, who knew
a little English at the time, acted
as his interpreter. The visitor
talked to Sadao about the
possibility of coming over to Kent
State for graduate work in
gymnastics. Sadao applied and
was accepted as a "special
student," meaning he had to take
courses in English for foreign
students and pass a comprehensive
exam before being admitted on a
regular basis.
Hamada and his friend,
Watanabe, came over the U.S. in
the spring of 1969. In April they

participated in two competitions,
the Pasadena City College and
Long Beach Invitational Meets. In
the Long Beach meet, Sadao was
second in the all-around to a high
school star named Steve Hug, now
Stanford's number one performer.
Sadao's first year at Kent was
spent learning the American
language firsthand to supplement
the "school-book English" he had
learned in high school and college.
He worked in the cafeteria and
picked up American slang from
the girls there. "They said I was
'obnoxious' and called me a 'sexy
little devil,' " he said, grinning.
Painful Injury
In the fall of 1971, Sadao
suffered a setback when he
injured his achilles tendon during
a routine.
Although the injury was severe,
Sadao refused to let it get him
down. He continued to work out,
ignoring the pain. In the spring of
'72, after only eight months of
recuperation, he managed to take
third in the AAU and U.S.
Gymnastics Federation all-around
competitions. The previous two
years he had been second in the
AAU all-around.
After leaving Kent State last
spring, Sadao came to the Bay
Area to teach summer physical
education to a group of girls at
Tamalpias High School in Marin
County. He brought with him a
high school star from Ohio he had
been coaching for the past year or
so, who he hopes can come to
Stanford next year. The two were
working out at Berkeley, when
they ran into Millman and Ted
Miyamoto, a member of the
Stanford team. They talked for
awhile, and Millman later
suggested to Bob Young that he
consider Sadao for the coaching
position.
Young And Talented
Sadao had the unique
opportunity to take over a team
that was young and already very
talented. Through heavy
recruiting the past few years,
Millman had managed to grab a
good deal of the gymnastic talent
that was coming out of American
high schools, including two-time
Olympian Steve Hug, two-time
AAU sidehorse champion Ted
Marcy, and 1971 all-around leader
in high school Bob Anderson.
So far this year, Stanford has
beaten Cal State Fullerton, Chico
State, and UCLA for dual meets
and came in second behind 1972
NCAA champion Southern Illinois
in a quadrangular competition,
losing by less than a point. That
alone is an excellent record for a
first year coach, but Sadao feels
the team could go all the way.
"We weren't ready for SIU. I
don't look on the regular season
meets as being that important.

We're looking forward to the
Pac-8 and NCAA."
Although Sadao is coaching
full time, here during the day and
at Burlingame in the evening, he
still tries to stay in shape by
working out and stretching an
hour or so each day. He
tentatively plans to enter the
AAU meet again this year after

the regular season is over. "I like
to perform myself," he said. "It's
easier for me—coaching is much
more difficult."
The fact that Hamada, like
Millman, is young and still a top
level performer seems to have a
positive effect on the team.
Shawn Skerrett, a junior vaulting
specialist who also competes in
several other events, believes that
"young coaches are better than
older ones. The sport has changed
so rapidly in the past few years
that you have to be a performer
to be able to feel what's
happening."
'He Guides Us'
Ted Marcy, who was Hamada's
roommate at the AAU meet last

year, and defeated his coach on
the side horse, commented, "He
knows gymnastics better than
anyone else on the team because
he's studied it, both as a
performer and as a coach. The
coach I had in high school was a
real hard driver, but Sadao doesn't
force us, he guides us."
Steve Hug agreed Hamada was

similar to Millman in that respect.
"Both Sadao and Dan place less
emphasis on winning and more on
learning. They don't want to be
authority figures."
As well as winning the respect
of his team, Sadao also seems to
have won their friendship in the
past few months. Having just
gotten out of school, he
understands contemporary college
life better than most coaches do.
Unlike Millman, who had a wife
and daughter, Hamada is a
bachelor, who lives alone in an
apartment in Palo Alto. He is
much closer to the team outside
the gym than most coaches. "He
goes out to dinner with us," said
Skerrett, "and he'll drop by

people's rooms now and then just
to see what's happening."
Sadao's coaching philosophy is
basically traditional Japanese,
interspersed with ideas and
techniques he has picked up over
here. He explained his feelings as
he leaned back in a chair in his
office. "Gymnastics should be
fun, but it is also hard work. It
involves hours and hours of
training—sprained finger, ripped
hand, sore aching body. We work
so hard to make it look so easy.
The best way to become a
champion is to work slowly, over
several years, but most Americans
are too impatient for that. They
put together a technically good
routine and specialize, so they can
score high early.
'Typical American athletes
seem a little lazy to me. When the
season ends and it gets warm
outside, I don't know how many
of the guys will keep coming to
the gym. I'd like to think they'll
all be there. If they work out and
stretch in the spring, there won't
be injuries next winter. Personally
I want to make Olympians or at
least international class gymnasts
out of these guys.'
The only thing definite about
Sadao's plans for the future is that
they will revolve around the sport
he loves. "My life will be coaching
gymnastics," he said. "I don't
have a goal just yet, but I always
think my responsibility is to make
the best gymnasts possible."

THE COACH PERFORMS—First year gymnastics coach Sadao
Hamada performs an exhibition on the paralel bars during Stanford's
meet against UCLA. Hamada has twice finished second in the national
AAU all-around competition.
Last spring, Stanford
gymnastics coach Dan Millman
quietly packed his bags and
moved to a new position at
Oberlin College in Ohio. His
sudden departure left the athletic
department in a dilemma. There
were few coaches available
qualified to replace him, and the
excellent team he had built up
over the last four years was in
contention for the Pac-8 and
NCAA titles, if only the right
mentor could be found to lead it.
On Acting Athletic Director
Bob Young's shoulders fell the
responsibility of Gnding a new
head coach over the summer, and
with a limited budget, he had
little to offer except the prestige
of the position. According to
Millman, who stayed around a few
extra weeks to help Young choose
his successor, they looked around
and compiled a list of 10 or so
possibilities. "We finally narrowed
the list down to three individuals
who were definitely interested
and highly skilled Paul Ziert
from Illinois, Yoshi Hayasaki
from Indiana, and Sadao Hamada
of Kent State."
Hamada had a short interview
with Young early in the summer,
but didn't think Stanford was that
interested in him, so he flew back
to Kent. "I got a phone call one

evening from Mr. Young," Sadao
remembers, "and he told me if I
was still interested in the job, I'd
better get back to Stanford—fast.
I was on the plane the next
morning." Within a week,
Stanford had a new gymnastics
coach.
Packed Solid
Sadao Hamada is 5-7 and 145
lbs., packed solid with the muscle
of over ten years of continuous
gymnastics competition. His mild
accent recalls the fact that he
spent his first 22 years in his
homeland of Japan.
Mayasuki Watanabe, a friend
and former coach from his
hometown, now an assistant
coach at Berkeley, said of him,
"Sadao tries to be happy in
everything he does. He approaches
everything in a positive way,
always confident that everything
will turn out all right in the end."
Sadao's interest in athletics
began long before he took his first
swing on a high bar. He was born
in Kochi, Japan, 26 years ago, and
grew up in a family with two
sisters. He was quite active even as
a child, and because he had no
brothers to play with, went into
organized sports early.
In elementary school, Sadao
was primarily a swimmer. In
junior high, his interest shifted to
volleyball, and he competed a

couple of years for his school
team before an untimely knee
injury forced him into early
retirement.
With his injured knee, Hamada
felt he could no longer play a
good game of volleyball, so he
began looking around for another
sport to try in high school. A
cousin of his who was four years
older had gotten into gymnastics
and become rather good. Sadao
talked to him, watched him, and
finally decided to try the sport.
Mistake
Hamada figured the stretching
and more controlled movements
of gymnastics would help his knee
recover faster. "That was a
mistake," he said later. "There
was a lot of tumbling and I had to
run everyday."
Eventually, though, the knee
healed, and throughout his high
school years, he continued to
build himself into a respectable
gymnast. By the time graduation
came around, he had decided on a

contention for the Pac-8 and
NCAA titles, if only the right
mentor could be found to lead it.
On Acting Athletic Director
Bob Young's shoulders fell the
responsibility of Gnding a new
head coach over the summer, and
with a limited budget, he had
little to offer except the prestige
of the position. According to
Millman, who stayed around a few
extra weeks to help Young choose
his successor, they looked around
and compiled a list of 10 or so
possibilities. "We finally narrowed
the list down to three individuals
who were definitely interested
and highly skilled Paul Ziert
from Illinois, Yoshi Hayasaki
from Indiana, and Sadao Hamada
of Kent State."
Hamada had a short interview
with Young early in the summer,
but didn't think Stanford was that
interested in him, so he flew back
to Kent. "I got a phone call one

evening from Mr. Young," Sadao
remembers, "and he told me if I
was still interested in the job, I'd
better get back to Stanford—fast.
I was on the plane the next
morning." Within a week,
Stanford had a new gymnastics
coach.
Packed Solid
Sadao Hamada is 5-7 and 145
lbs., packed solid with the muscle
of over ten years of continuous
gymnastics competition. His mild
accent recalls the fact that he
spent his first 22 years in his
homeland of Japan.
Mayasuki Watanabe, a friend
and former coach from his
hometown, now an assistant
coach at Berkeley, said of him,
"Sadao tries to be happy in
everything he does. He approaches
everything in a positive way,
always confident that everything
will turn out all right in the end."
Sadao's interest in athletics
began long before he took his first
swing on a high bar. He was born
in Kochi, Japan, 26 years ago, and
grew up in a family with two
sisters. He was quite active even as
a child, and because he had no
brothers to play with, went into
organized sports early.
In elementary school, Sadao
was primarily a swimmer. In
junior high, his interest shifted to
volleyball, and he competed a

couple of years for his school
team before an untimely knee
injury forced him into early
retirement.
With his injured knee, Hamada
felt he could no longer play a
good game of volleyball, so he
began looking around for another
sport to try in high school. A
cousin of his who was four years
older had gotten into gymnastics
and become rather good. Sadao
talked to him, watched him, and
finally decided to try the sport.
Mistake
Hamada figured the stretching
and more controlled movements
of gymnastics would help his knee
recover faster. "That was a
mistake," he said later. "There
was a lot of tumbling and I had to
run everyday."
Eventually, though, the knee
healed, and throughout his high
school years, he continued to
build himself into a respectable
gymnast. By the time graduation
came around, he had decided on a
career in gymnastics. He applied
to Nippon College of Health and
Physical Education at Tokyo, and
after passing an academic and
rigorous physical skill test, was
accepted for the fall of 1965.
Nippon College is a true "jock"
school that makes U.S. football
factories appear like ivory towers
in comparison. There are 5,000
students—all of whom are physical
education major. Nearly 500 of
these are gymnasts, only nine of
whom are allowed to compete on
the school's team.
"I would get up at 5:00 a.m.
and do some heavy stretching
before breakfast. During the day I
worked five or six, occasionally
even seven or eight hours on the
apparatus,," Sadao said of his
days at Nippon. "Many of us went
to class in our sweats or gym
shorts. In between classes, even if
I had only five minutes or so, I
would rush down to the gym and
take a few swings on the high bar
or something."
Interpreter
During his final year at
Nippon, when Sadao finally made
the top nine, an American high
school gymnast was visiting the
campus to learn about Japanese
gymnastics, and Sadao, who knew
a little English at the time, acted
as his interpreter. The visitor
talked to Sadao about the
possibility of coming over to Kent
State for graduate work in
gymnastics. Sadao applied and
was accepted as a "special
student," meaning he had to take
courses in English for foreign
students and pass a comprehensive
exam before being admitted on a
regular basis.
Hamada and his friend,
Watanabe, came over the U.S. in
the spring of 1969. In April they

participated in two competitions,
the Pasadena City College and
Long Beach Invitational Meets. In
the Long Beach meet, Sadao was
second in the all-around to a high
school star named Steve Hug, now
Stanford's number one performer.
Sadao's first year at Kent was
spent learning the American
language firsthand to supplement
the "school-book English" he had
learned in high school and college.
He worked in the cafeteria and
picked up American slang from
the girls there. "They said I was
'obnoxious' and called me a 'sexy
little devil,' " he said, grinning.
Painful Injury
In the fall of 1971, Sadao
suffered a setback when he
injured his achilles tendon during
a routine.
Although the injury was severe,
Sadao refused to let it get him
down. He continued to work out,
ignoring the pain. In the spring of
'72, after only eight months of
recuperation, he managed to take
third in the AAU and U.S.
Gymnastics Federation all-around
competitions. The previous two
years he had been second in the
AAU all-around.
After leaving Kent State last
spring, Sadao came to the Bay
Area to teach summer physical
education to a group of girls at
Tamalpias High School in Marin
County. He brought with him a
high school star from Ohio he had
been coaching for the past year or
so, who he hopes can come to
Stanford next year. The two were
working out at Berkeley, when
they ran into Millman and Ted
Miyamoto, a member of the
Stanford team. They talked for
awhile, and Millman later
suggested to Bob Young that he
consider Sadao for the coaching
position.
Young And Talented
Sadao had the unique
opportunity to take over a team
that was young and already very
talented. Through heavy
recruiting the past few years,
Millman had managed to grab a
good deal of the gymnastic talent
that was coming out of American
high schools, including two-time
Olympian Steve Hug, two-time
AAU sidehorse champion Ted
Marcy, and 1971 all-around leader
in high school Bob Anderson.
So far this year, Stanford has
beaten Cal State Fullerton, Chico
State, and UCLA for dual meets
and came in second behind 1972
NCAA champion Southern Illinois
in a quadrangular competition,
losing by less than a point. That
alone is an excellent record for a
first year coach, but Sadao feels
the team could go all the way.
"We weren't ready for SIU. I
don't look on the regular season
meets as being that important.

We're looking forward to the
Pac-8 and NCAA."
Although Sadao is coaching
full time, here during the day and
at Burlingame in the evening, he
still tries to stay in shape by
working out and stretching an
hour or so each day. He
tentatively plans to enter the
AAU meet again this year after

the regular season is over. "I like
to perform myself," he said. "It's
easier for me—coaching is much
more difficult."
The fact that Hamada, like
Millman, is young and still a top
level performer seems to have a
positive effect on the team.
Shawn Skerrett, a junior vaulting
specialist who also competes in
several other events, believes that
"young coaches are better than
older ones. The sport has changed
so rapidly in the past few years
that you have to be a performer
to be able to feel what's
happening."
'He Guides Us'
Ted Marcy, who was Hamada's
roommate at the AAU meet last

year, and defeated his coach on
the side horse, commented, "He
knows gymnastics better than
anyone else on the team because
he's studied it, both as a
performer and as a coach. The
coach I had in high school was a
real hard driver, but Sadao doesn't
force us, he guides us."
Steve Hug agreed Hamada was

similar to Millman in that respect.
"Both Sadao and Dan place less
emphasis on winning and more on
learning. They don't want to be
authority figures."
As well as winning the respect
of his team, Sadao also seems to
have won their friendship in the
past few months. Having just
gotten out of school, he
understands contemporary college
life better than most coaches do.
Unlike Millman, who had a wife
and daughter, Hamada is a
bachelor, who lives alone in an
apartment in Palo Alto. He is
much closer to the team outside
the gym than most coaches. "He
goes out to dinner with us," said
Skerrett, "and he'll drop by

people's rooms now and then just
to see what's happening."
Sadao's coaching philosophy is
basically traditional Japanese,
interspersed with ideas and
techniques he has picked up over
here. He explained his feelings as
he leaned back in a chair in his
office. "Gymnastics should be
fun, but it is also hard work. It
involves hours and hours of
training—sprained finger, ripped
hand, sore aching body. We work
so hard to make it look so easy.
The best way to become a
champion is to work slowly, over
several years, but most Americans
are too impatient for that. They
put together a technically good
routine and specialize, so they can
score high early.
'Typical American athletes
seem a little lazy to me. When the
season ends and it gets warm
outside, I don't know how many
of the guys will keep coming to
the gym. I'd like to think they'll
all be there. If they work out and
stretch in the spring, there won't
be injuries next winter. Personally
I want to make Olympians or at
least international class gymnasts
out of these guys.'
The only thing definite about
Sadao's plans for the future is that
they will revolve around the sport
he loves. "My life will be coaching
gymnastics," he said. "I don't
have a goal just yet, but I always
think my responsibility is to make
the best gymnasts possible."

THE COACH PERFORMS—First year gymnastics coach Sadao
Hamada performs an exhibition on the paralel bars during Stanford's
meet against UCLA. Hamada has twice finished second in the national
AAU all-around competition.
Last spring, Stanford
gymnastics coach Dan Millman
quietly packed his bags and
moved to a new position at
Oberlin College in Ohio. His
sudden departure left the athletic
department in a dilemma. There
were few coaches available
qualified to replace him, and the
excellent team he had built up
over the last four years was in

real hard driver, but Sadao doesn't
force us, he guides us."
Steve Hug agreed Hamada was

similar to Millman in that respect.
"Both Sadao and Dan place less
emphasis on winning and more on
learning. They don't want to be
authority figures."
As well as winning the respect
of his team, Sadao also seems to
have won their friendship in the
past few months. Having just
gotten out of school, he
understands contemporary college
life better than most coaches do.
Unlike Millman, who had a wife
and daughter, Hamada is a
bachelor, who lives alone in an
apartment in Palo Alto. He is
much closer to the team outside
the gym than most coaches. "He
goes out to dinner with us," said
Skerrett, "and he'll drop by

people's rooms now and then just
to see what's happening."
Sadao's coaching philosophy is
basically traditional Japanese,
interspersed with ideas and
techniques he has picked up over
here. He explained his feelings as
he leaned back in a chair in his
office. "Gymnastics should be
fun, but it is also hard work. It
involves hours and hours of
training—sprained finger, ripped
hand, sore aching body. We work
so hard to make it look so easy.
The best way to become a
champion is to work slowly, over
several years, but most Americans
are too impatient for that. They
put together a technically good
routine and specialize, so they can
score high early.
'Typical American athletes
seem a little lazy to me. When the
season ends and it gets warm
outside, I don't know how many
of the guys will keep coming to
the gym. I'd like to think they'll
all be there. If they work out and
stretch in the spring, there won't
be injuries next winter. Personally
I want to make Olympians or at
least international class gymnasts
out of these guys.'
The only thing definite about
Sadao's plans for the future is that
they will revolve around the sport
he loves. "My life will be coaching
gymnastics," he said. "I don't
have a goal just yet, but I always
think my responsibility is to make
the best gymnasts possible."
