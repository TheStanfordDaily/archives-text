# Improving JV's Face Big Weekend
## 
### MARK WHITE 
After winning its last four
games, Stanford's junior varsity
basketball team risks its best
record of the season, nine wins
and six losses, when the Cards
play UC Santa Cruz tonight and
USF tomorrow afternoon at
Maples Pavilion.
Having won their last four
straight and six of their last eight
games, the JV's have
systematically solved several
problems that plagued them early
in the season. Since the first game,
which the Cards lost to the team
they face Saturday, USF, the JV's
have cut down on the number of
turnovers per contest, increased
general movement, controlled
rebounding to a larger extent,
passed the ball better, and
distributed the scoring more
evenly.
Turnovers killed the Cards in
the first six games, but since the
contest with Menlo College, the
Cards have caused more mistakes
than they have committed. While
Ed Schweitzer still does a yeoman
job on the boards, the other big
men are picking up the slack and
it is no coincidence that in its last
six victories the team has
out-rebounded opponents by an
average of nine caroms a contest.
Better Passing
Increased ball control has been
supplemented by more accurate,
patient passing. Where they once
would rush a shot before setting
up offensively, Cardinal guards
and forwards have passed the ball
to the player with the open shot.
This has opened up the middle,
frustrating opponent
double-teaming of Schweitzer and
has led to better scoring
distribution. While it appears
Schweitzer can still score at will if
need be, Marty Moroski, Kevin
Enright, and Rich Wohlstadter
have carried the scoring burden in
recent games.
While Stanford's fortunes have
gradually risen throughout the

season, USF's have taken a marked
downturn. Convincingly beating
Stanford in its first outing of the
year in December, USF's record
has fallen to an 8-12 season due to
injuries and the promotion of star
forward Howard Smith to the
varsity. Once a fast breaking,
quick, pesky team, the Dons now
use a deliberate offense since they
now are considerably slower.
In the earlier game USF was
led by 6-6 forward Richard Smith
who scored 24 and rebounded 10.
But Smith has a broken hand now
and has been replaced by junior
Larry Deal who is averaging 17
points a game. While Deal is said
to be doing an excellent job, the
Dons are considerably weaker
without Smith or Johnson.
Stanford will face a stiff test in
USF, but the Cards should win.
Hot UCSC
The game against UCSC Friday
will be of a different sort. Santa
Cruz does not have an
intercollegiate athletic program
and the team travelling here is
described by Rich Kitchens, SC
player-coach, as "a bunch of guys
who get together one hour a week
and mess around with a
basketball."
Santa Cruz's 16-6 record belies
any implication that the club is a
pushover, but their flashy,
hot-shot style does set them apart
from most teams. Stanford varsity
center Rich Kelley reported that
in a game between Santa Cruz and
College of Notre Dame, the men
from UCSC perfectly executed a
three on one fast break with two
consecutive behind-the-back
passes. Such performances should
not beat the Cards, but should
provide for an entertaining
contest.
The Santa Cruz game will be
played at 6 p.m. tonight with
tomorrow's contest against the
Dons scheduled for 4 p.m.,
immediately following the varsity
game.
