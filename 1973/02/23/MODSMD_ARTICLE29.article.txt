# Thoughts From The Bench
## A 						Male Dollie? Maybe... 
### Stan Wilson 
Last fall, for the first time in its history, the
Leland Stanford Junior University Marching Band
allowed women into its ranks, drawing scorn from
traditionalists, and inspiring accolade's from the
Farm's "liberated" elements. Recently the NCAA
ruled to allow women to participate in a previously
all-male sport—crew—and this season women
coxswains can be seen guiding the oarsmen.
I was curious to see from where the assault on
traditional sex roles would come next, but I didn't
have to wait too long. I must confess, however, that
I was more than a little surprised when I learned
that Jim Rosskopf, a sophomore from Pasadena,
had decided to challenge for a position in one of
Stanford's most cherished institutions—the
dollies—songleaders who until now had been all
female.
"I just take it as a colossal joke," said current
dollie Irene Balcar, a senior. "Any Stanford male
has the right to attend clinics and go through with
tryouts," she explained, but added that she believed
Rosskopfs attempt to become a dollie to be a
"publicity stunt."
"I wanted to see what tryouts were like,"
Rosskopf said, assuring me that he planned to "go
through with the trials." "I was really curious to see
how people would react to me."
But he'll have to find out alone. The original
number of males aspiring to be dollies was five, but
the other four have given up the idea. Charmaine
Berry, presently a dollie, informed him that he was
breaking an "unwritten rule" by trying out,
according to Rosskopf.
His unique goal leaves him open to the inevitable

barrage of jokes, but Rosskopf handles them pretty
well. "I don't feel embarassed any more," he said.
But he admitted that he gets "sick of a few jokes,
even when they're made infun."
The current dollies are responsible for handling
the clinic sessions and teaching the routines, and on
one occasion I witnessed an instructor attempting to
dissuade Rosskopf from trying out. But everyone
seems to be getting used to the idea, and he
described Berry as "helpful" and "friendly" now,
Kerry McGuinn, another dollie, made it no secret
that she was opposed to Rosskopf's decision to try
out, at least in the beginning. But she's changed her
tune somewhat, and had a veiled compliment for
Rosskopf. According to the aspiring male dollie,
McGuinn told him, 'You sure can kick high—for a
guy.'
Originally Rosskopf and his friends had wanted
to become yell leaders, but there was no official
position at Stanford, and apparently, no interest. "I
think you have to have some kind of yell leaders,"
he said, and added that he may look into the
possibility—"lf I lose."
It may be interesting to speculate what will
happen to the dollies' image if Rosskopf manages to
join the elite dancing corps. "I think the dollies are
great," he stated, presumably talking about their
dancing skill.
What are his chances of winning? "A lot has to
do with the Band," he said. He feels that the band
will vote as a bloc—either for him, as a joke, or
against him, to retain the all-female group. But pom
pon girl Balcar was considerably more sure of the
outcome. "He doesn't stand a chance," she said.
