# U.S.-China Liaison Offices Set Up As Step Toward Full Relations
## 
### Associated Press 
WASHINGTON - The United
States and China took a major step
toward full diplomatic relations with
the establishment of liaison offices in.
each nation's capital.
The development was announced in
a communique released simultaneously
in Washington and Peking to reflect
"the progress that has been made"
since President Nixon visited the
mainland a year ago.
Presidential adviser Henry A.
Kissinger told newsmen the agreement
worked out in his recent trip to Peking
is an important step toward
normalization of relations with the
Communist regime.
And he said the President's China

trip started the two nations toward a
better understanding.
"After the end of the war in
Vietnam, and in these discussions in
Peking, we were able to begin to travel
some of these roads, and to move from
the attempt to eliminate the
obstructions and the mistrust to some
more concrete and positive
achievements," he said.
Major Topics Discussed
Kissinger said his discussions with
Chairman Mao Tse-tung and Premier
Chou En-lai in Peking this week
covered four major areas:
—"The desirability of normalization
of relations
—"The desirability of reducing the
danger of military conflict.
—"The affirmation by both sides
that neither would seek hegemony in
the Pacific area.
—"And each of them opposed the
attempt of anyone else to achieve it,
and that the relations between China
and the United States would never be
directed against any third country."
Because of the progress toward
better relations, Kissinger said, it was
decided "that the existing channel in
Paris, the designated relations, was
inadequate and that, therefore, each
side would establish a liaison office in
the capital of the other."
Diplomatic Immunity
This office falls short of embassy or
mission status, but its personnel will
have diplomatic immunity and
privileges, including the right to send
coded private messages to its
government.
Kissinger said the offices "would
handle trade as well as all other
matters, except the strictly formal
diplomatic aspects of the
relationship."
The announcement was hailed by
Senate Democratic Leader Mike
Mansfield, D—Mont., as "an
accomplishment which really astounds
me" but Sen. Edward M. Kennedy,
D—Mass., asked "Why must we be
content with progress that is too little
and too slow?" Kennedy said progress
is being hampered by "the foolish
fiction we continue to maintain, that
somehow the government of Chiang
Kai-Shek on Taiwan is the government

of China on the mainland."
As a sign of the good will generated
by Kissinger's nearly 20 hours of talks
with Chinese leaders in Peking, the
mainland government agreed to release
within the next two months two U.S.
military prisoners: Navy Lt. Cmdr.
Robert J. Flynn and Air Force Maj.
Philip F. Smith.
Smith was shot down in 1965 while
flying a Vietnam-related mission, while
Flynn was captured during a similar
flight in 1967.

Kissinger reaffirmed the diplomatic
alliance maintained withtheNationalist
Chinese government on Taiwan and he
said the "level of our troops on
Taiwan is not the subject of
negotiation .... There exists no
immediate plan for any withdrawal."
However, there will be periodic
review of the status of the 8,000 U.S.
troops on the island, he said, and their
ultimate disposition "will be governed
by the general considerations of the
Nixon Doctrine with respect to danger
in the area."
