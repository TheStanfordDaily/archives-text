# Oddsmaker's Nightmare
## Unpredictable Cards Host Huskies, WSU 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
With five games remaining in
which to turn a mediocre season
into a moderately successful one,
Stanford hosts Washington and
Washington State this weekend in
a pair of Pacific Eight games at
Maples Pavilion.
The Cards, now 10-10 on the
season and 3-6 in the conference,
had a typically unpredictable
weekend against Oregon State and
Oregon a week ago. Coach Howie
Dallmar's cagers played nearly
flawless basketball on Friday
night, defeating the 18th ranked
Beavers 81-70.
But 24 hours later Stanford
blew a 10 point second half lead
as the Cards dropped a frustrating
76-69 decision to Oregon.
Those two games and
Stanford's earlier split with the

Washington schools in the
Northwest (the Cards lost to WSU
61-49 and defeated Washington
76-55) combine to make this
weekend's contests an
oddsmaker's nightmare.
Huskies Hot
Tonight's 8 p.m. game is
particularly hard to predict.
Stanford destroyed Washington in
Seattle, but last Saturday the
Huskies upset USC 73-70 while
the Cards were floundering against
Oregon.
"Thro is just no way to explain
this game sometimes," Dal 1 mar
said. "Washington will be all the
tougher now with that win behind
them, and I'm sure they'll come in
against us with a world of
confidence. We beat them pretty
easily in Seattle earlier, but you
can forget that after seeing the
way they played in the Sports
Arena last weekend."
Washington, also 3-6 in the
league but 13-9 overall, boasts one
of the hottest players in the
league in 6-7 forward Ray Price.
Price scored 25 points in the first
half last week against USC and
finished the game with a career
high of 34. Guard Louie Nelson
contributed 20 points against the
Trojans, two under his impressive
22 point season average.
Tall Starters
Price and Nelson currently
rank 2-3 on the Pac-8 scoring list.
They will be joined by 6-10
freshman center Lars Hansen, 6-8
forward Reggie Ball, and 6-2
guard Ron Williams in the Huskie
starting lineup. That quintet
averages 6-6, one of the few teams
that matches Stanford's height
average.
Stanford, of course, will once
again rely on seven-foot
sophomore Rich Kelley to supply
most of the scoring and
rebounding punch. After scoring
41 points and grabbing 31
rebounds last weekend, Kelley
raised his season averages to 17.5
points and 13.1 rebounds.
In Pacific Eight play, Kelley is
the only player in the league who

ranks in the top 10 in all four
statistical categories. He is second
in rebounding and field goal
percentage, seventh in scoring,
and ninth in free throw
percentage.
Saturday's Washington State
game will be played at 2:40 p.m.
as the Cards make their third
appearance of the year on the
Pac-8 TV game of the week.
The Cougars have struggled to
a 5-16 season record and are 1-8
in the conference, but that single
league victory came against
Stanford on Jan. 6 in Pullman.

WSU's 6-9 center Mike Dolven
destroyed the Cards with 28
points in that game and he
continues to lead the Cougars
with a 15.4 scoring average and an
8.7 rebounding mark.
Other probable WSU starters
include forwards Rich Steele (6-7)
and Edgar Jefries (6-4) and guards
Brad Jackson (5-11) and Sandy
Miller (6-3), a freshman who is the
nephew of NBA star Calvin
Murphy.
Stanford's lineup will be
slightly different as Bob Buell
replaces Dave Frost on the injured

list and Frost replaces Buell in the
starting five. The left side of
Buell's face is stili numb from a
freak collision in Saturday's game
but he plans to suit up tonight
despite missing two days of
practice this week.
Frost, who suffered a muscle
spasm in his back against Cal three
weeks ago and played only a few
minutes the lost two weekends,
seems to be in top shape again.
Frost will be joined by Kelley,
Mike Mann, Mel Arterberry, and
Mark Gilberg in tonight's starting
lineup.

Saturday's Washington State
game will be played at 2:40 p.m.
as the Cards make their third
appearance of the year on the
Pac-8 TV game of the week.
The Cougars have struggled to
a 5-16 season record and are 1-8
in the conference, but that single
league victory came against
Stanford on Jan. 6 in Pullman.

WSU's 6-9 center Mike Dolven
destroyed the Cards with 28
points in that game and he
continues to lead the Cougars
with a 15.4 scoring average and an
8.7 rebounding mark.
Other probable WSU starters
include forwards Rich Steele (6-7)
and Edgar Jefries (6-4) and guards
Brad Jackson (5-11) and Sandy
Miller (6-3), a freshman who is the
nephew of NBA star Calvin
Murphy.
Stanford's lineup will be
slightly different as Bob Buell
replaces Dave Frost on the injured

list and Frost replaces Buell in the
starting five. The left side of
Buell's face is stili numb from a
freak collision in Saturday's game
but he plans to suit up tonight
despite missing two days of
practice this week.
Frost, who suffered a muscle
spasm in his back against Cal three
weeks ago and played only a few
minutes the lost two weekends,
seems to be in top shape again.
Frost will be joined by Kelley,
Mike Mann, Mel Arterberry, and
Mark Gilberg in tonight's starting
lineup.

MEL ON THE MOVE—Sophomore guard Mel Arterberry brings the ball upcourt against Oregon's Ron Lee
in last week's 76-69 loss to the Ducks. Arterberry scored 13 points in the game, but Lee's 19 points and
explosive floor play were key factors in the Oregon victory.
With five games remaining in
which to turn a mediocre season
into a moderately successful one,
Stanford hosts Washington and
Washington State this weekend in
a pair of Pacific Eight games at
Maples Pavilion.
The Cards, now 10-10 on the
season and 3-6 in the conference,
had a typically unpredictable
weekend against Oregon State and
Oregon a week ago. Coach Howie
Dallmar's cagers played nearly
flawless basketball on Friday
night, defeating the 18th ranked
Beavers 81-70.
But 24 hours later Stanford
blew a 10 point second half lead
as the Cards dropped a frustrating
76-69 decision to Oregon.
Those two games and
Stanford's earlier split with the

Washington schools in the
Northwest (the Cards lost to WSU
61-49 and defeated Washington
76-55) combine to make this
weekend's contests an
oddsmaker's nightmare.
Huskies Hot
Tonight's 8 p.m. game is
particularly hard to predict.
Stanford destroyed Washington in
Seattle, but last Saturday the
Huskies upset USC 73-70 while
the Cards were floundering against
Oregon.
"Thro is just no way to explain
this game sometimes," Dal 1 mar
said. "Washington will be all the
tougher now with that win behind
them, and I'm sure they'll come in
against us with a world of
confidence. We beat them pretty
easily in Seattle earlier, but you
can forget that after seeing the
way they played in the Sports
Arena last weekend."
Washington, also 3-6 in the
league but 13-9 overall, boasts one
of the hottest players in the
league in 6-7 forward Ray Price.
Price scored 25 points in the first
half last week against USC and
finished the game with a career
high of 34. Guard Louie Nelson
contributed 20 points against the
Trojans, two under his impressive
22 point season average.
Tall Starters
Price and Nelson currently
rank 2-3 on the Pac-8 scoring list.
They will be joined by 6-10
freshman center Lars Hansen, 6-8
forward Reggie Ball, and 6-2
guard Ron Williams in the Huskie
starting lineup. That quintet
averages 6-6, one of the few teams
that matches Stanford's height
average.
Stanford, of course, will once
again rely on seven-foot
sophomore Rich Kelley to supply
most of the scoring and
rebounding punch. After scoring
41 points and grabbing 31
rebounds last weekend, Kelley
raised his season averages to 17.5
points and 13.1 rebounds.
In Pacific Eight play, Kelley is
the only player in the league who

ranks in the top 10 in all four
statistical categories. He is second
in rebounding and field goal
percentage, seventh in scoring,
and ninth in free throw
percentage.

"Thro is just no way to explain
this game sometimes," Dal 1 mar
said. "Washington will be all the
tougher now with that win behind
them, and I'm sure they'll come in
against us with a world of
confidence. We beat them pretty
easily in Seattle earlier, but you
can forget that after seeing the
way they played in the Sports
Arena last weekend."
Washington, also 3-6 in the
league but 13-9 overall, boasts one
of the hottest players in the
league in 6-7 forward Ray Price.
Price scored 25 points in the first
half last week against USC and
finished the game with a career
high of 34. Guard Louie Nelson
contributed 20 points against the
Trojans, two under his impressive
22 point season average.
Tall Starters
Price and Nelson currently
rank 2-3 on the Pac-8 scoring list.
They will be joined by 6-10
freshman center Lars Hansen, 6-8
forward Reggie Ball, and 6-2
guard Ron Williams in the Huskie
starting lineup. That quintet
averages 6-6, one of the few teams
that matches Stanford's height
average.
Stanford, of course, will once
again rely on seven-foot
sophomore Rich Kelley to supply
most of the scoring and
rebounding punch. After scoring
41 points and grabbing 31
rebounds last weekend, Kelley
raised his season averages to 17.5
points and 13.1 rebounds.
In Pacific Eight play, Kelley is
the only player in the league who

ranks in the top 10 in all four
statistical categories. He is second
in rebounding and field goal
percentage, seventh in scoring,
and ninth in free throw
percentage.
Saturday's Washington State
game will be played at 2:40 p.m.
as the Cards make their third
appearance of the year on the
Pac-8 TV game of the week.
The Cougars have struggled to
a 5-16 season record and are 1-8
in the conference, but that single
league victory came against
Stanford on Jan. 6 in Pullman.

WSU's 6-9 center Mike Dolven
destroyed the Cards with 28
points in that game and he
continues to lead the Cougars
with a 15.4 scoring average and an
8.7 rebounding mark.
Other probable WSU starters
include forwards Rich Steele (6-7)
and Edgar Jefries (6-4) and guards
Brad Jackson (5-11) and Sandy
Miller (6-3), a freshman who is the
nephew of NBA star Calvin
Murphy.
Stanford's lineup will be
slightly different as Bob Buell
replaces Dave Frost on the injured

list and Frost replaces Buell in the
starting five. The left side of
Buell's face is stili numb from a
freak collision in Saturday's game
but he plans to suit up tonight
despite missing two days of
practice this week.
Frost, who suffered a muscle
spasm in his back against Cal three
weeks ago and played only a few
minutes the lost two weekends,
seems to be in top shape again.
Frost will be joined by Kelley,
Mike Mann, Mel Arterberry, and
Mark Gilberg in tonight's starting
lineup.

MEL ON THE MOVE—Sophomore guard Mel Arterberry brings the ball upcourt against Oregon's Ron Lee
in last week's 76-69 loss to the Ducks. Arterberry scored 13 points in the game, but Lee's 19 points and
explosive floor play were key factors in the Oregon victory.
