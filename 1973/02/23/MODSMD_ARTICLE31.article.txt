# Lola Predicts
## 
### 
Tragedy has struck the
Daily sports office, and
indeed, the entire Stanford
Community must suffer
together in this hour of loss.
After suffering a disastrous
weekend, the Daily's
marvelous mystic, Lola, is no
longer with us. She managed
only four correct picks in
eight games (a coin toss
would have been as accurate)
and could not stand the
shame, taking her own life.
But Lola, true to the end,
left us her predictions for the
final weeks. A coke bottle
with a sheet of paper rolled
tightly inside, was found
floating in the San Francisco
Bay, with these predictions
scrawled in blood:
Stanford 75—Washington 68
Stanford 78-WSU6B
Washington 72—Cat 70
Cat 79—WSU 67
USC 79—OSU 72
Oregon 69—USC 66
UCLA 85—OSU 75
UCLA 91-Oregon 74
