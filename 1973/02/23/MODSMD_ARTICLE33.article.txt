# Wrestlers Prepare For Pac-8 Championships
## 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
Their dual meet season behind
them, Stanford's wrestlers face a
new challenge this weekend at the
Pac-8 conference meet at Oregon
State.
Last year, only blind Bobby
Sweetman was able to score
points for Stanford in the Pac-8
meet, perennially dominated by
the northern teams. However, this
season the Cardinals should have
several individuals score points.
Leading the way is
150-pounder Chris Horpel, the
favorite in his division. Horpel has
been beaten only once this year,
and is rated the best hope for a
first place trophy.
Last season, Horpel was moved
down to 142 pounds for this
meet, a weight loss which hurt his
strength, and he failed to place.
Coach Joe DeMeo also expects
several of his other wrestlers to
finish high. Four wrestlers from
the Pac-8 in each of the 10 weight
divisions will qualify for the
NCAA championships, to be held
March 8-10 at Washington.
Ken Krebs, who has been
wrestling at 142 pounds all year,
has been moved down to 134 in
hopes of bettering his chances to
place. Last weekend, Krebs

pinned his opponent from
Claremont in his first trial at the
new weight.
The lowering of Krebs one
weight division has forced Danny
Mueller down to 126. However,
he too seems to have benefitted
from the move, as DeMeo said of
his performance in last weekend's
36-12 win over the Claremont
team, "It was his best of the year.
He pinned a real good kid."
Other Stanford hopefuls
include Sweetman (118), who has
also had to lose weight to
compete, Emmett Stanton (158),
John Govea (177), Marc Feinstein
(167), Mark Frelier (190), and Art
Estrada (Hwt.)
Feinstein, a sophomore who
won his first match of the year
against Claremont, has now gone
down two weight divisions - a loss
of 23 pounds.
Although the young Stanford
team should place at least one and
possibly as many as five
individuals, there is not much
hope of a high team finish.
Oregon and Washington, the
perennial league champions, the
host Oregon State team, and
California all look strong.
Stanford's final dual meet
record was 5-7.

SEXIST? Can you see sophomore Jim Rosskoph as a "dollie" next
year? Rosskoph insists that he will try out for a spot, and with the
support of the Band and a few friends, Stanford may have its first
male "dollie," in time for football season in the fall.
