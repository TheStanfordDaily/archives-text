# Cards Host UCLA
## Rugby Team Seeks Seventh Victory 
### PETE BRATIA 
The Stanford Rugby Team
faces one of the season's toughest
opponents tomorrow at 1:30 p.m.
when the Cards meet the UCLA
Bruins on the Stanford Rugby
Field. UCLA, the defending
NCAA champions, has lost only
twice this year-once to Cal and
once to the Bay Area Touring
Side (BATS).
Stanford Coach Pete Kmetovic
said the Bruins field a very
experienced team and pointed out

that their team is a combination
of good foreign and domestic
players. Their top player, Charles
Williams is Welsh, and the team
sports players from New Zealand
as well.
Kmetovic added that Stanford
is rated "an underdog and we will
have to put together a good game
to beat UCLA."
Last weekend the Cards rolled
over USC 30-9 in Los Angeles.
This victory, which improved
Stanford's season record to 6-2,
followed the Bears 7-6 upset over
the UCLAns.
Stanford's scoring was led by

Chris Spieller and Craig Zaltosky.
Spieller scored ten points on a try
and three conversion kicks.
Zaltosky recorded eight points on
a pair of tries. Zaltosky's two
scores came on 15 and ten yard
runs following pitches from Pat
Moore and Tom Klein. Bill
Conway, Joe Martin, and John
Snider all recorded tries in the
Stanford runaway.
Kmetovic commented, "we
played well generally. SC is still
not very strong since they are just
getting back into it after a couple
of years absence. They really
didn't have much size."
