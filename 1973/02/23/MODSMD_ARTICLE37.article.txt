# Gymnasts Compete After Long Layoff
## 
### PHIL HuBBARD 
The Stanford gymnastics squad
flies north this weekend to take
on Washington and Oregon teams
in an attempt to prove they are
ready to assume Pac-8 leadership
in the sport. Tonight the Cards
will face Oregon at Eugene, and
Saturday evening they will go
against Washington and
Washington State at Seattle.
Stanford hasn't competed since
the Cards finished second to a
quadrangular meet in Los Angeles
two weeks ago. In that event the
gymnasts finished second behind
Southern Illinois, losing to the
defendingNCAAchampionsby less
than a point.
The two week layoff has
permitted the gymnasts to
improve theiroptionaJroutines and
to work on the compulsories in
anticipation of the Pacific Eight
Championships next month.
Strongest Ever
Oregon has perhaps one of its
strongest teams ever, and has
already scored over 158 points in
a meet this season. The Cards have
yet to break that mark.
Although Washington State
should pose "no problem"
according to Coach Hamada. the
Huskies from Washington may.
They edged Stanford out of the
Pac-8 title by less than one tenth
of a point last year, and have

scored over 157 points in one
meet this year.
The all-around men for
Stanford will be Bob Anderson
and Ted Miyamoto. Steve Hug
will probably go all-around in one
meet, and Hector Neff, who is
recuperating well from his
hamstring injury, may go in the
other.
Usual Lineup
In individual events, the Cards
will go with their usual lineup.
Ted Marcy and John White will go
on the side horse, Howard Bessen
and George Negrete on the rings,
and Shawn Skerrett and Leo
Hollberg on parallel bars, vaulting,
and high bar, in addition to the
all-around performers.
"Both Oregon and Washington
should be very tough this
weekend," said Hamada. "They
should be very close meets, but I
think we can win. Hector (Neff)
has gotten a lot stronger —
everybody has improved since the
Southern Illinois meet."
This is the first year that
Stanford has competed in dual
meet competition against the
northern schools. Previously the
only time northern and southern
division Pac-8 teams met was in
the annual league championships.
