# Swimmers Conclude Dual Meet Season
## 
### MIKE CHASSON 
The swimming team closes out
its dual meet season tomorrow
afternoon against the Ladera Oaks
Aquatic Club at 2 p.m. in the
Encina Pools.
Like last weekend's meet
against California, this one will
provide an opportunity to make
Pacific-Eight and NCAA time
standards. Fifteen swimmers and
two divers have qualified for the
conference championships next
week in Santa Monica.
Coach Jim Gaughran has two
more spots open on the squad
that will travel to Southern
California. Four swimmers have a
good shot at those two places. In
the event more than two make the
standards, Gaughran will take the
swimmers that have the best
chance to place.
Tom Crema will attempt to
qualify in the distance events,
while John Stalker, Rick Lambert
and Pete Snyder will try to make
the trip in the 200 butterfly.

Paul Clark and Martin Pedley
will attempt to make NCAA
cut-off times, with Clark
swimming the 400 IM and Pedley
the 50 free. Both are just tenths
of a second away from qualifying
to make the trip to Tennessee.
Gaughran will also use the
meet to help him decide who will
be swimming in the 400 medley,
400 free, and 800 free relays at
the conference championships. He
has various combinations to
choose from, especially on the
800 free relay.
Ladera is led by John Nabor,
who is one of the top high school
prospects in the country. Nabor
has recorded times this season in
the 500 free, 1650 free, 100 back,
and 200 back, that would have
placed him high in the finals in
last year's NCAA championships.
He is being actively recruited by
Stanford, Indiana, UCLA, and
USC with the high school senior
still undecided.
