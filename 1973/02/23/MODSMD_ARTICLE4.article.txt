# SWOPSI Panel Asks Post-War Aid Policy
## 
### TERRY ANZUR 
Members of a SWOPSI workshop
on reconstruction in Indochina
yesterday released a statement urging
the United States to minimize its
manipulative military, political, and
administrative roles in the channeling
of post-ceasefire aid for the rebuilding
of Indochina.
The workshop, which includes two
Southeast Asians and several
Americans with a total of 26 years
residence in the region, offered the
following recommendations in
connection with the Feb. 26 Paris
Conference on Indochina:
—Substantial quantities of aid
should be provided to alleviate human
suffering caused by the war in North
and South Vietnam, Cambodia, and
Laos. The report claims "Most of the
aid should come from the U.S."
because "most of the damage was
caused by U.S. military action."
—"The American role in channeling
such aid should be minimized," the
SWOPSI report states. It advocates
Sen. Fullbright's recommendation for
multilateral distribution of aid through
the United Nations and specialized
agencies such as the Joint Economic
Commission agreed upon by Henry
Kissinger and Le Due Tho.
Human Need
—Governmental entities should play
no part in the dissemination of aid; it

should be governed by human need.
The report emphasizes, "People in
need should be helped whether they
live under a Communist or
non-Communist regime." The
international agency administering aid
should settle disagreements between
governmental entities in Indochina as
to how much aid each should receive.
—The International agency for
administering aid to Indochina should
include representatives of various
countries participating in the Paris
Conference. Those countries are the
Peoples' Republic of China, France,
the Soviet Union, Britain, Poland,
Hungary, Indonesia, Canada, the
United States, North and South
Vietnam, the Viet Cong and the
Secretary General of the United
Nations.
—The report urges the conference
to do whatever is feasible to
de-politicize aid to Indochina, and to
guarantee access to all parts of
Indochina for journalists who wish to
investigate the administration of
external aid.

The statement also recommends,
'The presence of American CIA agents
provocateur in Indochina should cease
forthwith," adding that they should be
banned by the U.S. government from
returning to Indochina for several
