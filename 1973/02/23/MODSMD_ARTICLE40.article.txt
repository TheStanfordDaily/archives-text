# City Golf Qualifying Opens Tomorrow
## 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
Several Stanford golfers will be
among the favorites tomorrow
when qualifying begins in the
"World's Largest Golf
Tournament," the San Francisco
City Championships. Over 300
golfers will tee it up at Harding
Park and Lincoln Park in this
weekend's 36 hole qualifying,
including 13 Stanford hopefuls.
Sophomore Bruce Robertson,
who was runnerup in last year's
tourney, leads the ' Cardinal
contingent. A missed five foot
putt on the first extra hole cost

Robertson the title last year, as he
finally succumbed to John
Cranston on the 38th hole of the
scheduled 36 hole final match.
The year before Robertson
reached the semifinals while still a
senior in high school. If this
progression continues, 1973
should be the year he comes out
on top.
After this weekend's
qualifying, the low 64 will
advance to match play, which will
be held on successive weekends
beginning next Saturday and
ending with the final match on
March 17. Most of the Stanford
players estimate that a 36 hole
score of 152 or 153 will be
needed to survive the cut.
In last year's qualifying
Robertson and teammate
TomKeelin tied for medalist
honors with 141 totals. Keelin is

entered again this year, as is Dave
Baskins. a quaterfinalist in last
year's tourney. Conrad Nilmeier,
who reached the second round
before losing last year, is another
Stanford hopeful.
Aly Trompas missed qualifying
by a shot last year, but the
sophomore from San Diego is
considered one of the tournament
favorites this time around.
Trompas' game seems to be in top
shape and the match play format
suits his highly competitive style
of play. He won the 1969 U.S.
Junior, also a match play
tournament.
Other Card golfers expected to
challenge the favorites include
Denny Colvin, Bob Chapman, and
George Pettinger. Bob Harrington,
Bob Conway, Mike Mcßride, Mark
Mcßride, and Lowry Fenton are
also entered.

Coach Bud Finger's golfers
won't compete in another
intercollegiate event until the Cal
State Hay ward tournament on
March 6th at Silverado.
Robertson, Trompas, Nilmeier,
Baskins, Chapman, and Colvin
currently occupy the top six spots
on the Card ladder with Pettinger
the nearest challenger for a
starting berth.
In a freshman match yesterday
at the Stanford course, the Card
frosh team tied West Valley
College 27-27. Bob Steele fired a
three over par 74 to lead the
Cards, but Wade Nonnenberg was
the only other Stanford player to
break 80 as he shot 78. The frosh
now have a 1-0-1 record.

favorites in the San Francisco City Golf Championships which begin
tomorrow. Robertson reached the semifinals two years ago and lost
on the 38th hole of last year's final match. The talented sophomore
will match his skills against the world's greatest golfers this April when
he competes in the Masters in Augusta, Georgia.
Several Stanford golfers will be
among the favorites tomorrow
when qualifying begins in the
"World's Largest Golf
Tournament," the San Francisco
City Championships. Over 300
golfers will tee it up at Harding
Park and Lincoln Park in this
weekend's 36 hole qualifying,
including 13 Stanford hopefuls.
Sophomore Bruce Robertson,
who was runnerup in last year's
tourney, leads the ' Cardinal
contingent. A missed five foot
putt on the first extra hole cost

Robertson the title last year, as he
finally succumbed to John
Cranston on the 38th hole of the
scheduled 36 hole final match.
The year before Robertson
reached the semifinals while still a
senior in high school. If this
progression continues, 1973
should be the year he comes out
on top.
After this weekend's
qualifying, the low 64 will
advance to match play, which will
be held on successive weekends
beginning next Saturday and
ending with the final match on
March 17. Most of the Stanford
players estimate that a 36 hole
score of 152 or 153 will be
needed to survive the cut.
In last year's qualifying
Robertson and teammate
TomKeelin tied for medalist
honors with 141 totals. Keelin is

entered again this year, as is Dave
Baskins. a quaterfinalist in last
year's tourney. Conrad Nilmeier,
who reached the second round
before losing last year, is another
Stanford hopeful.
Aly Trompas missed qualifying
by a shot last year, but the
sophomore from San Diego is
considered one of the tournament
favorites this time around.
Trompas' game seems to be in top
shape and the match play format
suits his highly competitive style
of play. He won the 1969 U.S.
Junior, also a match play
tournament.
Other Card golfers expected to
challenge the favorites include
Denny Colvin, Bob Chapman, and
George Pettinger. Bob Harrington,
Bob Conway, Mike Mcßride, Mark
Mcßride, and Lowry Fenton are
also entered.

Coach Bud Finger's golfers
won't compete in another
intercollegiate event until the Cal
State Hay ward tournament on
March 6th at Silverado.
Robertson, Trompas, Nilmeier,
Baskins, Chapman, and Colvin
currently occupy the top six spots
on the Card ladder with Pettinger
the nearest challenger for a
starting berth.
In a freshman match yesterday
at the Stanford course, the Card
frosh team tied West Valley
College 27-27. Bob Steele fired a
three over par 74 to lead the
Cards, but Wade Nonnenberg was
the only other Stanford player to
break 80 as he shot 78. The frosh
now have a 1-0-1 record.
