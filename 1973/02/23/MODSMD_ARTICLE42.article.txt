Stanford has so completely
dominated singles play at the
Northern California
Intercollegiate Tournament in
Berkeley that, v., uund .o
go, the Cardinals have no one left
but themselves to beat.
Four players remain alive after
the completion of the first three
rounds—all from Stanford.
With 20 points compared to
second-place Cal's 10, the
Cardinals have easily clinched first
place.
In today's semifinals at 1 p.m.
at the Berkeley Tennis Club,
top-seeded Rick Fisher is matched
against fourth-seeded John
Whitlinger, while third seeded
Gery Groslimond takes on
unseeded Mark Mitchell.
The play of Mitchell, a
freshman who came to the
tourney as Stanford's sixth and
last man, has been especially
good. Wednesday, Mitchell
shocked Cal's top player, Peter
Campbell, who was second-seeded
in the toumey, 4-6, 6-3, 6-3.
Less than one hour later,
Mitchell beat San Jose State's
Chris Fitzpatrick, 6-7, 7-5, 6-3,
while in the quarterfinals
yesterday, he edged Cal's Larry
Belinsky, 1-6, 6-4, 6-4.
Thus all three rounds, Mitchell
has come back from first set losses

to win his matches. "He's doing
an awfully good job, considering
all the pressure on him. He's
surprising everyone." said coach
Dick Gould.
In other quarter final action
yesterday, Rick Fish r beat Cal's
John Stefanki, 3-i 6-4, 6-4.
Whitlinger topped i J aul Sidone,
Stanford's fifth player, 6-4, 4-6,
6-2, while Groslimond beat Chip
Fisher, the Cards' fourth man,
6-0, 6-2.
In doubles play, two of the
semifinal teams are from
Stanford. Yesterday, Rick Fisher
and Groslimond, first seeded, beat
Ron Louie and Ron Tong (USF)
6-1, 6-1, while second seeds
Whitlinger and Chip Fisher topped
Tom Rodgers and Fitzpatrick
(SJS), 6-0, 6-4.
However, the third Cardinal
doubles team of Jake Warde and

Craig Johnson was beaten by
Campbell and Stefanki (Cal) 6-2,
6-2, thus far the only Stanford
loss to an outside team in the
tourney.
The wins are even more
impressive because three of
Stanford's top players are away,
playing at the National Indoor
Championships in Salisbury,
Maryland. In that event, Sandy
Mayer, second-seeded among U.S.
players, advanced to the
quarterfinals by beating Onny
Parrum of New Zealand 7-6, 6-1
Wednesday.
The other two Cardinal
entrants were beaten, however, in
matches on Tuesday. Jim Delaney
lost to Hungary's Szabolcs
Baranyi, 7-6, 1-6, 6-4, while Pat
DuPre played well against U.S.
Open Champion Hie Nastase of
Rumania, but still lost 6-4, 6-3.
