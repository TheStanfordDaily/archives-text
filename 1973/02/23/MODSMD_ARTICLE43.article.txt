### MARK WHITE 
Using home runs in the first and fourth innings,
Stanford's junior varsity baseball team outslugged
California, in winning 8-5 yesterday and took the
first step towards a championship in the Bay Area
Collegiate Baseball Tourney which Stanford is
hosting this weekend.
The game started ominously for Stanford when
pitcher Bernie Hitner's first pitch was hit sharply
down the left field line by Cal's lead-off man. Card
third baseman Keith Pershall appeared to have an
easy play, but the ball took a crazy hop and struck
Pershall in the chest, for an infield hit. The bad hop
single was erased on the next play, however, as
second baseman Gary Bei fielded a ground ball up
the middle and converted it into a double play.
Hitner struck out the next Bear on three pitches to
retire the side.
Bei opened the bottom of the first with an
infield single of his own off the Bear third baseman
and one out later Ray Anderson added a bad
bounce single to left which moved Bei to second.
Catcher Dave Baker forced Bei at third with a
broken-bat grounder and with two down, men on
first and second. Card short stop Steve Davis came
to bat. Davis went to a 3-2 count before walloping a
fastball over the left-center field fence for a three

run homer.
Bruce Robinson drove in Pershall during the next
inning to give Stanford a 4-0 lead. Cal came back in
the third and fourth innings to trim the Card lead to
one run as J. Dittoe's looping single to center led to
two runs that culminated the three run Bear rally.
Having seen a four run lead dwindle to one,
Stanford went to the long ball to put the game
away. Card first baseman Ron Allegrotti led off the
fourth with a single to right and one out later Ray
Robinson drove in his third run of the game with a
homer to right.
Winning the game was Bernie Hitner, who
pitched all seven innings. The leading hitter was
Davis, who went two for three with two runs and
three RBl's.
Stanford will have a chance to improve on its 5-1
record when the Cards take on Chabot College
today at 3 p.m. in the semifinals. Chabot advanced
to today's round by beating USF 14-0 yesterday.
In the upper bracket of the eight team
tournament San Joaquin Delta was defeated by San
Jose State 10-7, while Santa Clara nipped Foothill
5-4. The winner of the Santa Clara-SJS contest will
meet the winner of Stanford's game for the
championship Saturday at 3 p.m.

Having seen a four run lead dwindle to one,
Stanford went to the long ball to put the game
away. Card first baseman Ron Allegrotti led off the
fourth with a single to right and one out later Ray
Robinson drove in his third run of the game with a
homer to right.
Winning the game was Bernie Hitner, who
pitched all seven innings. The leading hitter was
Davis, who went two for three with two runs and
three RBl's.
Stanford will have a chance to improve on its 5-1

Using home runs in the first and fourth innings,
Stanford's junior varsity baseball team outslugged
California, in winning 8-5 yesterday and took the
first step towards a championship in the Bay Area
Collegiate Baseball Tourney which Stanford is
hosting this weekend.
The game started ominously for Stanford when
pitcher Bernie Hitner's first pitch was hit sharply
down the left field line by Cal's lead-off man. Card
third baseman Keith Pershall appeared to have an
easy play, but the ball took a crazy hop and struck
Pershall in the chest, for an infield hit. The bad hop
single was erased on the next play, however, as
second baseman Gary Bei fielded a ground ball up
the middle and converted it into a double play.
Hitner struck out the next Bear on three pitches to
retire the side.
Bei opened the bottom of the first with an
infield single of his own off the Bear third baseman
and one out later Ray Anderson added a bad
bounce single to left which moved Bei to second.
Catcher Dave Baker forced Bei at third with a
broken-bat grounder and with two down, men on
first and second. Card short stop Steve Davis came
to bat. Davis went to a 3-2 count before walloping a
fastball over the left-center field fence for a three

run homer.
Bruce Robinson drove in Pershall during the next
inning to give Stanford a 4-0 lead. Cal came back in
the third and fourth innings to trim the Card lead to
one run as J. Dittoe's looping single to center led to
two runs that culminated the three run Bear rally.
