# Solid Pitching Staff Sparks Fast Baseball Start
## 
### SCOTT DAILEY 
When a college coach is asked about the strength
of his pitching staff, he is likely to respond by
mentioning the names of a couple of starters who
can put the ball over the plate with some regularity.
Stanford coach Ray Young rattles off six.
"Dan Shaw, Bob DiPietro, Ken Grolle, A 1
Arthur, Nick Peterson and Mike Higgins—they're all
outstanding," said Coach Young yesterday. "Our
first six guys have done an excellent job."
Three members of the staff—Shaw, DiPietro, and
Grolle—have perfect earned run averages of 0.00.
Peterson, Arthur, and Max Goldstein all have ERAs
of under 2.00.
The Cardinal pitching staff takes its sparkling
2.09 ERA on the road this weekend, playing San
Francisco State in an away game this afternoon at 2
p.m. and travelling to Santa Clara tomorrow for a
12 noon doubleheader.
Standing next to the batting cage on the practice
field behind Sunken Diamond, Coach Young
watched infielder A 1 O'Brien hit line drives and
talked about his pitchers.
Need Defense, Too
"Our strength right now is the pitching, but we
need the defense to back it up. Our pitchers aren't
the kind who strike out a lot of people; they get the
hitters to hit the ball in play somewhere. Probably
our only strikeout pitcher is Grolle."
So far this season, Grolle has 11 strikeouts in
nine innings to complement his perfect ERA.
The freshman righthander from Los Altos
possesses a quick fastball which he uses to set up
opposing hitters for his baffling changeup. Of
course, he can always shoot his fastball past the
batter, making him look twice at a called third
strike.
His windup flows smoothly, free of hesitation or
waste motion. Grolle is 6'3", and when he delivers
the ball straight overhand, batters may believe they
are facing some kind of whirling catapult.
"Grolle and Al Arthur are the kids who are going
to make this staff outstanding," Coach Young

predicted. "I'm very pleased with Arthur."
Only a sophomore, Arthur can throw hard and
he has a deceiving change of pace. His 6'4" frame
gives him an advantage over the hitter similar to
Grolle's. Arthur is 1-0 for the year.
The only man on the staff with two victories this
season is senior Dan Shaw. Smooth, strong, and fast,
the righthander from Eugene, Ore. works quickly,
never pausing, never giving the hitter time to dig in
and set a bearing on the pitch.
He is effective. Now in his fourth season of
varsity baseball, Shaw has compiled a 21-8 varsity
record and a career ERA of 2.09. He has yet to give
up an earned run this season.
Junior Bob DiPietro, the third member of the
staff with a 0.00 ERA, threw four shutouts last year
and in displaying his excellent form again this
season.
Against UOP on Wednesday, he fanned the first
three men he faced and gave up just two hits during
his three innning appearance.
Deceptive
His motion is deceptive. He starts up slowly,
deliberately, almost hesitantly. Then he suddenly
unleases 180 pounds of power in a swift
culmination of his windup that sends the ball
rocketing toward the plate. DiPietro uses his sneaky
changeup to fool anxious batters who find
themselves swinging almost before he releases the
ball.
Like DiPietro, Higgins takes his time and
concentrates on the hitter. His windup, though, is
smooth and quick. He fires the ball.
Although Higgins was burned against UOP, giving
all five of the Tigers' runs, including a three run
homer. Young is confident of his player's
talents.
"Higgins just got a little wild and got into
trouble," explained Young, adding that he
wasn't worried about Higgin's performance. "It's
still early for us, and we're still making some
mistakes. We just have to work on eliminating the
mistakes," Young said.

When a college coach is asked about the strength
of his pitching staff, he is likely to respond by
mentioning the names of a couple of starters who
can put the ball over the plate with some regularity.
Stanford coach Ray Young rattles off six.
"Dan Shaw, Bob DiPietro, Ken Grolle, A 1
Arthur, Nick Peterson and Mike Higgins—they're all
outstanding," said Coach Young yesterday. "Our
first six guys have done an excellent job."
Three members of the staff—Shaw, DiPietro, and
Grolle—have perfect earned run averages of 0.00.
Peterson, Arthur, and Max Goldstein all have ERAs
of under 2.00.
The Cardinal pitching staff takes its sparkling
2.09 ERA on the road this weekend, playing San
Francisco State in an away game this afternoon at 2
p.m. and travelling to Santa Clara tomorrow for a
12 noon doubleheader.
Standing next to the batting cage on the practice
field behind Sunken Diamond, Coach Young
watched infielder A 1 O'Brien hit line drives and
talked about his pitchers.
Need Defense, Too
"Our strength right now is the pitching, but we
need the defense to back it up. Our pitchers aren't
the kind who strike out a lot of people; they get the
hitters to hit the ball in play somewhere. Probably
our only strikeout pitcher is Grolle."
So far this season, Grolle has 11 strikeouts in
nine innings to complement his perfect ERA.
The freshman righthander from Los Altos
possesses a quick fastball which he uses to set up
opposing hitters for his baffling changeup. Of
course, he can always shoot his fastball past the
batter, making him look twice at a called third
strike.
His windup flows smoothly, free of hesitation or
waste motion. Grolle is 6'3", and when he delivers
the ball straight overhand, batters may believe they
are facing some kind of whirling catapult.
"Grolle and Al Arthur are the kids who are going
to make this staff outstanding," Coach Young

predicted. "I'm very pleased with Arthur."
Only a sophomore, Arthur can throw hard and
he has a deceiving change of pace. His 6'4" frame
gives him an advantage over the hitter similar to
Grolle's. Arthur is 1-0 for the year.
The only man on the staff with two victories this
season is senior Dan Shaw. Smooth, strong, and fast,
the righthander from Eugene, Ore. works quickly,
never pausing, never giving the hitter time to dig in
and set a bearing on the pitch.
He is effective. Now in his fourth season of
varsity baseball, Shaw has compiled a 21-8 varsity
record and a career ERA of 2.09. He has yet to give
up an earned run this season.
Junior Bob DiPietro, the third member of the
staff with a 0.00 ERA, threw four shutouts last year
and in displaying his excellent form again this
season.
Against UOP on Wednesday, he fanned the first
three men he faced and gave up just two hits during
his three innning appearance.
Deceptive
His motion is deceptive. He starts up slowly,
deliberately, almost hesitantly. Then he suddenly
unleases 180 pounds of power in a swift
culmination of his windup that sends the ball
rocketing toward the plate. DiPietro uses his sneaky
changeup to fool anxious batters who find
themselves swinging almost before he releases the
ball.
Like DiPietro, Higgins takes his time and
concentrates on the hitter. His windup, though, is
smooth and quick. He fires the ball.
Although Higgins was burned against UOP, giving
all five of the Tigers' runs, including a three run
homer. Young is confident of his player's
talents.
"Higgins just got a little wild and got into
trouble," explained Young, adding that he
wasn't worried about Higgin's performance. "It's
still early for us, and we're still making some
mistakes. We just have to work on eliminating the
mistakes," Young said.
