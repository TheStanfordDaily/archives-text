Israel Defends Plane Attack
TEL AVIV — Israel's air force chief and the fighter
pilots who shot down a Libyan airliner said
yesterday that the pilots were only trying to force
the plane to land but it resisted and seemed to be
trying to escape.
Defense Minister Moshe Dayan told newsmen the
Israeli decisions in the incident were taken through
normal military channels below the government
level and had "no political significance whatsoever."
The Soviet Union, which backs the Arab
countries in the Middle East conflict, declared
through official news media that Israel was
attempting to wreck a settlement.
Apparently 105 persons died in the crash
Wednesday of the Libyan Airlines Boeing 727 jet in
the Israeli-occupied Sinai Desert. Libyan officials
said the three-jet plane had 112 aboard. Israel
reported nine survivors were pulled from the
wreckage but two of these, both women, later died.
"We tried desperately to force it down, not to
shoot it down" the air force chief, Maj. Gen.
Mordechai Hod, told reporters. He added: "The
more the pilot objected and the more he tried to get
away, the more suspect he became."
Israeli pilots said that before firing they
confronted the French captain of the airliner face to
face at less than 15 feet and tried in vain with hand
signals and wing-wagging to get him to land.
But in Cairo, the plane's intended destination,
officials said a recording of the pilot's last
conversation with Egyptian controllers showed that
he had lost course, was unaware he was over hostile
territory and might have thought the fighters were
friendly Egyptian MIGs.
Cairo officials said the pilot's last words were:
"We are now shot. We are shot by a fighter. We are
shot by a fighter."
Laotian Cease-Fire Violated
VIENTIANE — War-torn Laos yesterday officially
entered a declared cease-fire, but reliable sources
reported what appeared to be a general offensive
spearheaded by about 65,000 North Vietnamese
troops.
The North Vietnamese shelled towns and
government positions in northern and southern
Laos, the sources said, and moved into areas never
before held by their allies, the Pathet Lao guerrilla
forces.
Two government towns fell to the Vietcong and
another, Khonh Sedone in the south, was
threatened. Government troops were retreating in
several areas.
In Vientiane, Premier Souvanna Phouma charged
today that the Pathet Lao and North Vietnamese
had committed 29 major violations of the cease-fire.
He said he would ask for renewed U.S. air cover
if the violations continued. U.S. air strikes ended at
midday yesterday when the truce officially took
effect.
"We have been tricked," Prince Souvanna said at
a news conference. "We knew of the possibility of
this happening. But we had faith in the good will of
the other side."
Military and other sources reported massive
violations by the Communist side of the noon

cease-fire deadline fixed by the armistice agreement
signed on Wednesday.
Cost Of Living Rises
WASHINGTON — The average worker's buying
power was clobbered last month by the highest rise
in grocery prices in a generation and by steep new
social security taxes.
As January's cost of living rose 0.3 percent the
average worker's buying power declined 1.1 percent,
the Labor Department reported yesterday.
It was the third straight monthly decline in
purchasing power and the biggest monthly drop in
2 x h years. It canceled much of the wage gains made
in the last year.
Last month's 0.3 percent rise in the cost of living
is larger when adjusted for the fact that prices
usually go down in January. The Bureau of Labor
Statistics said the seasonally adjusted increase was
0.5 percent.
Most of the increase is concentrated in grocery
prices, which consumers feel most keenly. These
went up 2.5 percent, or 2.3 percent seasonally
adjusted. This was the biggest monthly jump since
the BLS began keeping separate figures on grocery
prices in 1952.
Nixon To Submit Tax Program
WASHINGTON — Ending doubts about his plans,
President Nixon told Congress yesterday that he will
submit a tax-reform bill this year.
In his State of the Union message on the
economy, Nixon dealt with the subject in only one
sentence: "I shall recommend a tax program that
builds further reforms on those we achieved in 1969
and 1971."
In both 1969 and 1971, Congress approved
reform legislation that cut taxes substantially. Now,
the focus in Congress is on closing so-called
loopholes in the tax code.
Nixon also said he would send bills to provide
property tax relief for the elderly, provide an
income tax credit for tuition paid to private
elementary and secondary schools, and to give him
more power to change tariffs.
He said bills would be submitted to improve the
nation's private pension system, the unemployment
compensation law, minimum wage laws and"the
manner in which we deal with our transportation
system."
In each instance Nixon held back the details.
But he was expansive on a key
recommendation-holding back growth of the federal
budget. He urged adoption of an annual spending
ceiling by Congress—s269 billion in fiscal 1974 and
$288 billion in fiscal 1975.
Ellsberg Prosecution Rests Case
LOS ANGELES — The government conditionally
rested its case against Daniel Ellsberg and Anthony
Russo yesterday but said it would present
last-minute testimony next Tuesday about
fingerprints flown here from Saigon.
U.S. District Court Judge Matt Byrne allowed the
unusual move to reserve last testimony. He told the
jurors "other than the reservation just stated, the
government has rested its case."

The government called only 10 witnesses in four
weeks of testimony trying to prove espionage,
conspiracy and theft charges against Ellsberg and
Russo in connection with the leak of the
government's top secret war study.
Their witnesses included high ranking generals
who claimed the Pentagon study could have aided
an enemy if released publicly.
However, throughout the entire case the
prosecutor never sought to show that either
defendant intended any harm to the United States
when they copied the Pentagon study.
The judge has indicated in pretrial remarks that
the question of "intent" is an important point in
proving espionage.
The government has disagreed with this, saying it
need not show such intentions. Its case was
considered a unique interpretation of espionage laws
which specifically state the "intent" requirement.
Winthrop Rockefeller Dies
PALM SPRINGS — Winthrop Rockefeller, the
millionaire's son who brought widespread reform to
Arkansas as its first Republican governor in nearly a
century, died yesterday. He was 60.
A family spokesman said Rockefeller died of
cancer at 8:30 a.m. PST. Once a robust 200-pound
6-footer, he had been weakened by an illness
discovered during surgery last year and was
hospitalized a week ago with a chest ailment.
