## 
### 
During the first two days of dog leash-law
enforcement on campus not a single loose or
unlicensed dog has been caught according to the
Stanford Public Safety Department.
Two blue Santa Clara County Animal Control
trucks have been observed patrolling the campus,
but Stanford Captain Frank Benaderet said
yesterday through a Public Safety Department
spokeswoman that no dogs have been picked up as
yet.
Roger Thacker, Community Affairs Director for
Tresidder Union, said that a special crew delivered
about 120 warning notices last week by attaching
them to the collars of dogs found wandering
untended around the Union. The county leash laws
designate that dogs must be kept penned or on a
leash not more than six feet long.
Reporters surveying the Tresidder area yesterday
at noon observed only one loose dog, confirming
Thacker's belief that the collar warnings were
working.
