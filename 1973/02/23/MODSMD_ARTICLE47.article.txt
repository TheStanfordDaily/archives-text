# City Attorney Opposes Ballot For Bach Mai
## 
### ROBERT BACON 
As expected, Palo Alto City
Attorney Peter Stone yesterday
recommended that the City Council
not place the controversial Bach Mai
initiative on the May 8 municipal
ballot.
If the council follows his advice at
its meeting Monday night, a court test
of the issue is virtually assured.
Stone's opinion reiterated his
earlier statement that the city could
not lawfully donate $50,000 in public
funds to help rebuild the bombed
Bach Mai Hospital in North Vietnam.
When the council Jan. 22 refused to
even consider making such a gift,
peace groups circulated an initiative
petition to place the question before
the voters.
Patently Illegal
Stone concluded that, since the
measure is "clearly and patently
illegal," the council is under no
obligation to put it on the ballot.
The council will probably follow
his recommendation. At the Jan. 22
meeting, they unanimously accepted
Stone's opinion that a gift to North
Vietnam was impermissible.
Mayor Kirke Comstock said several
weeks ago that he would vote to keep
the measure off the ballot should
Stone so recommend.
Lawsuit Promised
The measure's proponents claim
that the council is obligated to put the
issue on the ballot, and promise that
they will file suit to compel the city to

do so if the council declines to take
that action.
Stone's two-page opinion expressed
confidence that, in a court test, the
measure would be held invalid and the
city's position vindicated.
He said that the law does not
permit the city to make an outright
gift of public funds. Furthermore, he
indicated, an appropriation may be
made only by the council—not by the
voters in an initiative.
Since the measure is invalid, the
opinion continued, to hold an election
on it would be "a waste of taxpayers'
funds" and "a futile and idle act."
Unconvinced
Proponents of the measure are
unconvinced that what they propose is
unlawful. Attorney Robin Yeamans of
the Law Commune in Menlo Park told
the council Jan. 22 that she could find
no law which forbade a gift to Bach
Mai.
She intimated that if the council
members favored the gift, they would
have found it legally permissible.
Douglas Mattern of the Palo Alto
Peace Union, a leader of the initiative
drive, said this week that he was
hopeful that the council would put the
question before the voters, but
promised prompt court action should
they refuse to do so.
Supporters of the initiative are
expected to attend Monday night's
council meeting in large numbers to
urge that the question be put on the
ballot.

Mayor Kirke Comstock said several
weeks ago that he would vote to keep
the measure off the ballot should
Stone so recommend.
Lawsuit Promised
The measure's proponents claim
that the council is obligated to put the
issue on the ballot, and promise that
they will file suit to compel the city to

do so if the council declines to take
that action.
Stone's two-page opinion expressed
confidence that, in a court test, the
measure would be held invalid and the
city's position vindicated.
He said that the law does not
permit the city to make an outright
gift of public funds. Furthermore, he
indicated, an appropriation may be
made only by the council—not by the
voters in an initiative.
Since the measure is invalid, the
opinion continued, to hold an election
on it would be "a waste of taxpayers'
funds" and "a futile and idle act."
Unconvinced
Proponents of the measure are
unconvinced that what they propose is
unlawful. Attorney Robin Yeamans of
the Law Commune in Menlo Park told
the council Jan. 22 that she could find
no law which forbade a gift to Bach
Mai.
She intimated that if the council
members favored the gift, they would
have found it legally permissible.
Douglas Mattern of the Palo Alto
Peace Union, a leader of the initiative
drive, said this week that he was
hopeful that the council would put the
question before the voters, but
promised prompt court action should
they refuse to do so.
Supporters of the initiative are
expected to attend Monday night's
council meeting in large numbers to
urge that the question be put on the
ballot.
As expected, Palo Alto City
Attorney Peter Stone yesterday
recommended that the City Council
not place the controversial Bach Mai
initiative on the May 8 municipal
ballot.
If the council follows his advice at
its meeting Monday night, a court test
of the issue is virtually assured.
Stone's opinion reiterated his
earlier statement that the city could
not lawfully donate $50,000 in public
funds to help rebuild the bombed
Bach Mai Hospital in North Vietnam.
When the council Jan. 22 refused to
even consider making such a gift,
peace groups circulated an initiative
petition to place the question before
the voters.
Patently Illegal
Stone concluded that, since the
measure is "clearly and patently
illegal," the council is under no
obligation to put it on the ballot.
The council will probably follow
his recommendation. At the Jan. 22
meeting, they unanimously accepted
Stone's opinion that a gift to North
Vietnam was impermissible.
