# Indian Culture Of Alaska
## Students To Perform In Tlingit Dances 
### MELODY BROADBENT 
A taste of the Tlingit Indian culture
of Alaska will be given in Memorial
Auditorium tomorrow at 8 p.m.
The performance contains the
efforts of two students here, Carl
Smith and Cathy See, both affiliated
with the Tlingits (pronounced like
Klingit). See's village, Hoonah, is 98
percent Tlingit, while Haines, Smith's
home is 30 percent Tlingit. Both
places are near Juneau in southeast
Alaska. They estimated the Tlingit
population there to be roughly ten
thousand.
With a declaration of the desire to
share their culture rather than the
attempt to preserve it, See and Smith
wish to generate interest in their
unique cultural experience.
The Chilkat Dancers, a Tlingit
group also from Alaska, will
demonstrate tribal dances which
reflect a rich cultural heritage. Their
original costumes are highlighted by
masks with moveable eyes and jaws
and such craft-objects as drums and
rattles.
Natives Unique
According to Smith, Native peoples
of Alaska are "unique" in comparison
to other Native American groups, and
"our dances represent this
uniqueness." Comparing Tlingit art to
that of the Incas and Mayas, Smith
stressed the "very highly developed
form which art has taken in Tlingit
culture.
The sponsor of this non-profit
group is Carl Heinmiller, a white
Alaskan who has spent many years in
the restoration of Tlingit arts.
Admission to his group's performance
is two dollars general and one dollar
for students. Funds are channelled
into similar events staged by the
Chilkat Dancers.
Heinmiller formed the dance group
when they were youngsters, and last
year was voted Alaska's Man of the
Year for his work with the Tlingit.
Began With Scouts
Heinmiller began his work on
Tlingit cultural preservation with the
Boy Scouts in the 19505. Through
discovery and then through teaching
native ways to young people, the
transference of traditional ways has

successfully occurred.
The disruption of traditional Tlingit
culture was pinpointed by Smith and
See to have occurred at the turn of the
century with the influx of missionaries
and missions.
Sighting stories from her father's
past, See said that students were
whipped in school for speaking Tlingit
rather than English. From this point
on, the maintenance of pure Tlingit
culture became difficult.
Though both stressed the slow pace
of cultural destruction, the effects are
nonetheless visible. People gained
greater chances for mobility and some
occupations became incompatible with
traditional ways.
'Move Into Town'
As Smith stated it, "People tended
to move into town where the money

was." This was in spite of the fact that
material advantages are not necessarily
prestigious in Tlingit cultural terms.
Another major effect of contact
with white culture was the prevalent
incorporation of Christianity into folk
religious practices. According to Smith
and See, the tribe whole-heartedly
took up Christianity. "I've never seen
a more religious people" added See.
One mitigating factor to this slow
process of cultural disassimilation is
the geographic isolation of the Tlingit
tribe. Surrounded by mountains, this
isolation tends to be a "perpetuating
element" of the traditional culture and
probably will remain that way. The
major occupation of the tribe is
fishing, as it always has been.
Sample of Culture
Smith and See deny the possibility
or intense desire of trying to preserve

Tlingit culture through dance
performances. Rather they wish to
expose students here to a sample of a
different world—the Alaskan Indian
culture. The dancers are being
presented with the cooperation of the
Office of Public Events and the
Stanford American Indian
Organization.
Following this debut performance
in the Bay Area the group will also
appear at the Alaskan Trade Fair at
Mayfield Mall from Feb. 23 to March
3. In the attempt "to get an accurate
picture of native peoples," arts and
skills will be demonstrated at the Fair,
including native dress, silversmithing,
and wood carving.
The Tlingits are known for their
wood carving skill in the form of a 132
foot tall totem pole, the largest in the
world.
