## May Election 
### 
Important questions about the future of the entire Midpeninsula,
including Stanford, are the issues in the upcoming Palo Alto City
Council election. Therefore, it behooves members of the Stanford
community — even those who don't live in Palo Alto and so can't vote
— to pay heed.
On May 8, Palo Altans will choose six city council members — five
for four-year terms and one to fill a vacancy in a two-year term. Since
the council consists of nine members, the election affords the
opportunity to fundamentally remake its composition.
The council doesn't have jurisdiction over the central campus or
the student/faculty housing, of course, but Palo Alto and Stanford
interrelate in myriad ways.
Cooperation
Will the Palm Drive potholes be filled? Only with the cooperation
of both Stanford and Palo Alto.
Will Willow Road become a through street across El Camino? Only
with the cooperation of Stanford, Palo Alto, and several other
jurisdictions.
Will Stanford develop more of its lands for industry? For retail
stores? For low-income housing? Not unless the Palo Alto City
Council agrees.
What Palo Alto does affects Stanford, and affects those who live on
the Stanford campus.
Vital Division
The Palo Alto City Council currently splits 5-4 on a sizeable
percentage of important issues. Ideological labels often confuse more
than they clarify, but the five-member group has been labeled
"liberal" or "residentialist." The four-man minority has been called
"conservative," "establishment," or "commercial-industrial."
The division between, on a very gross level, those who want Palo
Alto to be principally residential in character and those who want to
continue to seek new industrial and commercial establishments for the
city, is over a decade old. Election after election has been fought over
that issue — in choosing council members as well as directly on
proposed developments in initiatives and referenda.
In the last few years, a third faction has come into prominence,
outflanking the liberals on the left. While these radical groups have
not yet elected a member to the council, they have been in the
forefront of several initiative and referendum campaigns, and regularly
make their views known at council meetings.
Balance
Against this background, Palo Alto now prepares for yet another
municipal election. The terms of all four "establishment" council
members expire. One of the "liberals" must also seek another full
term, and a second "liberal" is an appointee who must face the voters
for the remaining two years of the term.
So depending on the outcome, the council could become all
"liberal" or 6-3 in favor of the "establishment," which dominated for
several years until the 1971 election.
Filing closes March 1, after which there will be slightly over two
months to assess the candidates. It appears that each of the three
factions will promote a full slate of candidates, and there will be
independent candidates as well.
Do It
If you live in Palo Alto, register, take part in the campaign, and
vote.
If you don't live in Palo Alto, the election is still important to your
future and that of Stanford. The candidates can still use your help.
Local government often isn't as exciting as its big brothers in
Sacramento and Washington. But it can often be more important to
the individual citizen — even to the one who doesn't live within its
borders.
