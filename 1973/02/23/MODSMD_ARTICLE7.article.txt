# Fraternity Follies
## Destroy Thy Neighbor 
### 
Jerry Coleman

Good morning, collegians! The
question probably on your minds
right now as you gobble down
that Cream of Wheat is "What
University institution is this
column going to poke fun at
today? Who is Coleman going to
parody, lampoon, exaggerate,
grossify, and generally give a bad
name to this time?"
The subject for today is
fraternities. And let there be no
accusations of fratricidal bias, for
I live in one myself. Just to be on
the safe side, I'll keep all names
anonymous, or made up: I Eta Pi,
What's Nu?, or Rho Rho Rho.
It seems the whole world loves
a prankster, but nobody loves a
prankster more than fraternities
do. Take the frat that drove a
firetruck into Lake Lag some
years back ... or the one that
gave a housewarming- for its new
residence by burning the old one
to the ground.
State Of Siege
And note the more recent
example of the frat scavenger
hunt where some gentlemen were
arrested in the act of heisting a
life-size statue of Colonel Sanders
from the front window of one of
the Colonel's Chicken Palaces.
Any dorm resident can fondly
remember occasional water
balloon skirmishes with a
neighboring dorm. But among
some adjoining fraternities there
exists a constant state of siege.
Nighttime raids, property damage,
and dumping garbage on each
other's volleyball courts are not

uncommon.
Fortunately, where I live, there
is only one nearby frat, up the hill
behind some trees. In the past
when these Dingleberry Pi's made
much trouble, we invoked the full
wrath of the CJP (then SJC) upon
them. All their hands were red
from being slapped so much.
True Frat Fun
Last year was quiet, meaning
that there were no beer bottles
thrown through our dining room
windows. But this year, the
nightmare began again during the
Fall Quarter freezing spell.
Remember the night it
snowed? Well, we all piled out
onto the front porch to see this
miracle, as did the jokers in the
house above. One of them
shouted rather intelligently, "Hey
— it's snowing!"
In the spirit of true fun, one of
us yelled back, "Yeah — so what
else is new?" Came their reply:
"We're gonna break your windows
— that's what's new!" Within
minutes, our dining room floor
had tasted its first snow.
Mai de Siecle
Last weekend they were up to
their tricks again, blocking the
street with abandoned cars,
committing unmentionable acts
upon our front door, and partying
noisily late into the night with a
band whose favorite song was
"Gloria."
I had to get away; my nerves,
you know. So I took off over the
three day weekend to visit a
friend in Berkeley. We had a

relaxed dinner, then he invited me
over to his campus residence.
Upon arrival there, I discovered
that he not only lives in a Cal frat,
but is the president of the place.
Fraternities and sororities crowd
each other on both sides of the
street my friend lives on.
Foreign Exchange
"That frat across the way
there," he said pointing, "is now
Hebrew House or something. And
up the block at International
House are a lot of Egyptian
students this quarter. I hear
they're all going to have a picnic
together in the street next week.
"This sorority on the left of
my house is full of women who
stand next to their cars and tell
the men who pass by, 'Don't
touch me unless you plan to
marry me,' " he added.
Just then, a guy in my friend's
frat leaned out of his third floor
window and shouted, in response
to some noise from the sorority
next door, "Shaddup, you
whores!"
Executive Privilege
We entered my friend's house
and were immediately confronted
by a group of loyal brothers.
"You're the president," someone
said: "So check out the party at
the frat next door." (He spoke of
the house to the right.)
My friend rushed out a side
door, and began to climb a fire
escape on the neighboring
building. Two flights up was an
opened window spewing forth the
noise of an out-of-tune guitar.
Motioning me to be very quiet,
he whispered that this frat was
"the enemy." He reached the
window, looked in, yelled "Eat
me you weenies!" then raced
down the metal ladder and into
the sanctuary of his own house.
Our Hero Chickens
That was too much for me; not
wanting to get caught in a battle
zone, I started to leave. As I got
into my car I heard voices from
the porch of my friend's house:
"It's a real formal affair next
door — suits and ties."
"Far out! Should we use the
hose on them?"
"We did that last time. How
about fire crackers?"
Yes — let's kick off this year's
rush with a bang!
(Jerry Coleman's column, like
death and taxes, is inevitable. It
does, however, have the advantage
of regularity — more than one can
say for Jerry — every Friday on
this very page.)

Jerry Coleman

Good morning, collegians! The
question probably on your minds
right now as you gobble down
that Cream of Wheat is "What
University institution is this
column going to poke fun at
today? Who is Coleman going to
parody, lampoon, exaggerate,
grossify, and generally give a bad
name to this time?"
The subject for today is
fraternities. And let there be no
accusations of fratricidal bias, for
I live in one myself. Just to be on
the safe side, I'll keep all names
anonymous, or made up: I Eta Pi,
What's Nu?, or Rho Rho Rho.
It seems the whole world loves
a prankster, but nobody loves a
prankster more than fraternities
do. Take the frat that drove a
firetruck into Lake Lag some
years back ... or the one that
gave a housewarming- for its new
residence by burning the old one
to the ground.
State Of Siege
And note the more recent
example of the frat scavenger
hunt where some gentlemen were
arrested in the act of heisting a
life-size statue of Colonel Sanders
from the front window of one of
the Colonel's Chicken Palaces.
Any dorm resident can fondly
remember occasional water
balloon skirmishes with a
neighboring dorm. But among
some adjoining fraternities there
exists a constant state of siege.
Nighttime raids, property damage,
and dumping garbage on each
other's volleyball courts are not

uncommon.
Fortunately, where I live, there
is only one nearby frat, up the hill
behind some trees. In the past
when these Dingleberry Pi's made
much trouble, we invoked the full
wrath of the CJP (then SJC) upon
them. All their hands were red
from being slapped so much.
True Frat Fun
Last year was quiet, meaning
that there were no beer bottles
thrown through our dining room
windows. But this year, the
nightmare began again during the
Fall Quarter freezing spell.
Remember the night it
snowed? Well, we all piled out
onto the front porch to see this
miracle, as did the jokers in the
house above. One of them
shouted rather intelligently, "Hey
— it's snowing!"
In the spirit of true fun, one of
us yelled back, "Yeah — so what
else is new?" Came their reply:
"We're gonna break your windows
— that's what's new!" Within
minutes, our dining room floor
had tasted its first snow.
Mai de Siecle
Last weekend they were up to
their tricks again, blocking the
street with abandoned cars,
committing unmentionable acts
upon our front door, and partying
noisily late into the night with a
band whose favorite song was
"Gloria."
I had to get away; my nerves,
you know. So I took off over the
three day weekend to visit a
friend in Berkeley. We had a

relaxed dinner, then he invited me
over to his campus residence.
Upon arrival there, I discovered
that he not only lives in a Cal frat,
but is the president of the place.
Fraternities and sororities crowd
each other on both sides of the
street my friend lives on.
Foreign Exchange
"That frat across the way
there," he said pointing, "is now
Hebrew House or something. And
up the block at International
House are a lot of Egyptian
students this quarter. I hear
they're all going to have a picnic
together in the street next week.
"This sorority on the left of
my house is full of women who
stand next to their cars and tell
the men who pass by, 'Don't
touch me unless you plan to
marry me,' " he added.
Just then, a guy in my friend's
frat leaned out of his third floor
window and shouted, in response
to some noise from the sorority
next door, "Shaddup, you
whores!"
Executive Privilege
We entered my friend's house
and were immediately confronted
by a group of loyal brothers.
"You're the president," someone
said: "So check out the party at
the frat next door." (He spoke of
the house to the right.)
My friend rushed out a side
door, and began to climb a fire
escape on the neighboring
building. Two flights up was an
opened window spewing forth the
noise of an out-of-tune guitar.
Motioning me to be very quiet,
he whispered that this frat was
"the enemy." He reached the
window, looked in, yelled "Eat
me you weenies!" then raced
down the metal ladder and into
the sanctuary of his own house.
Our Hero Chickens
That was too much for me; not
wanting to get caught in a battle
zone, I started to leave. As I got
into my car I heard voices from
the porch of my friend's house:
"It's a real formal affair next
door — suits and ties."
"Far out! Should we use the
hose on them?"
"We did that last time. How
about fire crackers?"
Yes — let's kick off this year's
rush with a bang!

Yes — let's kick off this year's
rush with a bang!
(Jerry Coleman's column, like
death and taxes, is inevitable. It
does, however, have the advantage
of regularity — more than one can
say for Jerry — every Friday on

Jerry Coleman

Good morning, collegians! The
question probably on your minds
right now as you gobble down
that Cream of Wheat is "What
University institution is this
column going to poke fun at
today? Who is Coleman going to
parody, lampoon, exaggerate,
grossify, and generally give a bad
name to this time?"
The subject for today is
fraternities. And let there be no
accusations of fratricidal bias, for
I live in one myself. Just to be on
the safe side, I'll keep all names
anonymous, or made up: I Eta Pi,
What's Nu?, or Rho Rho Rho.
It seems the whole world loves
a prankster, but nobody loves a
prankster more than fraternities
do. Take the frat that drove a
firetruck into Lake Lag some
years back ... or the one that
gave a housewarming- for its new
residence by burning the old one
to the ground.
State Of Siege
And note the more recent
example of the frat scavenger
hunt where some gentlemen were
arrested in the act of heisting a
life-size statue of Colonel Sanders
from the front window of one of
the Colonel's Chicken Palaces.
Any dorm resident can fondly
remember occasional water
balloon skirmishes with a
neighboring dorm. But among
some adjoining fraternities there
exists a constant state of siege.
Nighttime raids, property damage,
and dumping garbage on each
other's volleyball courts are not

uncommon.
Fortunately, where I live, there
is only one nearby frat, up the hill
behind some trees. In the past
when these Dingleberry Pi's made
much trouble, we invoked the full
wrath of the CJP (then SJC) upon
them. All their hands were red
from being slapped so much.
True Frat Fun
Last year was quiet, meaning
that there were no beer bottles
thrown through our dining room
windows. But this year, the
nightmare began again during the
Fall Quarter freezing spell.
Remember the night it
snowed? Well, we all piled out
onto the front porch to see this
miracle, as did the jokers in the
house above. One of them
shouted rather intelligently, "Hey
— it's snowing!"
In the spirit of true fun, one of
us yelled back, "Yeah — so what
else is new?" Came their reply:
"We're gonna break your windows
— that's what's new!" Within
minutes, our dining room floor
had tasted its first snow.
Mai de Siecle
Last weekend they were up to
their tricks again, blocking the
street with abandoned cars,
committing unmentionable acts
upon our front door, and partying
noisily late into the night with a
band whose favorite song was
"Gloria."
I had to get away; my nerves,
you know. So I took off over the
three day weekend to visit a
friend in Berkeley. We had a

relaxed dinner, then he invited me
over to his campus residence.
Upon arrival there, I discovered
that he not only lives in a Cal frat,
but is the president of the place.
Fraternities and sororities crowd
each other on both sides of the
street my friend lives on.
Foreign Exchange
"That frat across the way
there," he said pointing, "is now
Hebrew House or something. And
up the block at International
House are a lot of Egyptian
students this quarter. I hear
they're all going to have a picnic
together in the street next week.
"This sorority on the left of
my house is full of women who
stand next to their cars and tell
the men who pass by, 'Don't
touch me unless you plan to
marry me,' " he added.
Just then, a guy in my friend's
frat leaned out of his third floor
window and shouted, in response
to some noise from the sorority
next door, "Shaddup, you
whores!"
Executive Privilege
We entered my friend's house
and were immediately confronted
by a group of loyal brothers.
"You're the president," someone
said: "So check out the party at
the frat next door." (He spoke of
the house to the right.)
My friend rushed out a side
door, and began to climb a fire
escape on the neighboring
building. Two flights up was an
opened window spewing forth the
noise of an out-of-tune guitar.
Motioning me to be very quiet,
he whispered that this frat was
"the enemy." He reached the
window, looked in, yelled "Eat
me you weenies!" then raced
down the metal ladder and into
the sanctuary of his own house.
Our Hero Chickens
That was too much for me; not
wanting to get caught in a battle
zone, I started to leave. As I got
into my car I heard voices from
the porch of my friend's house:
"It's a real formal affair next
door — suits and ties."
"Far out! Should we use the
hose on them?"
"We did that last time. How
about fire crackers?"
Yes — let's kick off this year's
rush with a bang!
