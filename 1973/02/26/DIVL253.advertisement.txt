POWDERED EGGS by Charles Simmons is a bawdy, hilarious
yet poignant novel about a recent fugitive from college...
twenty-one years old and much involved —with girls, the
Catholic Church, jobs, an apartment, a sports car, writing a
novel, a crazy Spaniard named Jose, an affair with an older
woman, and the outer reaches of his own imagination. William
Saroyan called it: "Great —a masterpiece." $1.25
...plus all these other
important new Penguins
