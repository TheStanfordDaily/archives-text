# Ellsberg Claims His Conviction Would Mean Censorship System
## 
### ED KOHN 
"Pentagon Papers" defendant
Daniel Ellsberg told the final session of
a civil liberties conference here Friday
night that his conviction on charges of
duplicating and releasing the top-secret
study "would produce an airtight
system of censorship ... rri effect, an
official secrets act."
Lashing out hard at the Nixon
administration, the former Rand Corp.
analyst told the crowd of 1200 at
Memorial Church that the American
government now resembles an "elected
monarchy" with virtually no restraints
on the powers of the presidency.
"In this country, we've had rule by
a single branch, unbalanced and
unchecked for 25 years," he said.

"When you have elections
determined by information controlled
by the boss," Ellsberg said, referring to
President Nixon, "the fact of elections
differentiates you from a monarchy a
lot less than the concentration of
power makes for similarity."
He charged that "every choice of
presidential candidates in the past 12
years has been almost totally
meaningless because of false
information put out by the incumbent
president." This, he said, has lowered
the potential credibility of others
running for the office, including Sen.
George McGovern (D S.D.).
Examples Cited
Ellsberg cited several examples:
—ln 1960, candidate Nixon said it

would be illegal to invade Cuba at the
same time he knew planning was
underway for the Bay of Pigs invasion.
—ln 1964, candidate Lyndon
Johnson promised he would not bomb
Vietnam but his advisers were
studying bombing options on election
day.
—ln 1968, Nixon touted his "secret
peace plan" when in fact there was no
such plan.
—ln 1972, presidential adviser
Henry A. Kissinger's pre-election
statement that "peace is at hand" was
followed by 12 days of intensive
post-election bombing of North
Vietnam.
Monarchial Control
"Nixon wants to drop the facade of
a real congressional role in foreign
affairs," the Harvard-trained former
Marine said. "The real reason he is
attacking civil liberties is because he
wants to extend monarchial control
over domestic affairs."
Ellsberg, who is currently on trial in
Los Angeles on charges of conspiracy,
espionage and theft of government
property arising out of the release of
the study of U.S. involvement in
Vietnam, said that the "Papers" prove
"the degree to which we have given up
self-government in this country."
Ellsberg charged that his trial
represents an attack on press freedom

"because this is the first prosecution
of a news source. To prosecute a news
source," he said, "is to have the same
effect on the flow of information as
prosecuting a newsman."
Speaking with Ellsberg at the
conference, entitled "Might vs. Right
in America," was Steve Weissman, a
writer and editor who was one of the
founders of the Pacific Studies Center.
Sharply Critical
Weissman, like Ellsberg, a sharp
critic of the Nixon administration's
foreign and domestic policies, charged
that the United States plans to use
continued foreign aid to Southeast
Asia "to pursue the same aims they've
been following all along," which he
termed "anti-subversive."
He said domestic programs such as
the Great Society "didn't work ... on
the other hand, the programs were
never intended to work .. . there was
no consideration of providing jobs,
only job training." He termed the War
on Poverty "a containment exercise."
"Civil rights aren't enough," he
said. "We have to realize every
movement for redress in the United
States has had to step on the free
speech... or due process of the
people who stood on top.
"Beyond the Bill of Rights is the
right to rebel," he concluded.

LASHING OUT-"Pentagon Papers" defendant Daniel Ellsberg, left with
moderator Kevin Smith, addressed the final session of a conference on "Might
vs. Right in America" Friday night before some 1200 people in Memorial
Church.
"Pentagon Papers" defendant
Daniel Ellsberg told the final session of
a civil liberties conference here Friday
night that his conviction on charges of
duplicating and releasing the top-secret
study "would produce an airtight
system of censorship ... rri effect, an
official secrets act."
Lashing out hard at the Nixon
administration, the former Rand Corp.
analyst told the crowd of 1200 at
Memorial Church that the American
government now resembles an "elected
monarchy" with virtually no restraints
on the powers of the presidency.
"In this country, we've had rule by
a single branch, unbalanced and
unchecked for 25 years," he said.

"When you have elections
determined by information controlled
by the boss," Ellsberg said, referring to
President Nixon, "the fact of elections
differentiates you from a monarchy a
lot less than the concentration of
power makes for similarity."
He charged that "every choice of
presidential candidates in the past 12
years has been almost totally
meaningless because of false
information put out by the incumbent
president." This, he said, has lowered
the potential credibility of others
running for the office, including Sen.
George McGovern (D S.D.).
Examples Cited
Ellsberg cited several examples:
—ln 1960, candidate Nixon said it

would be illegal to invade Cuba at the
same time he knew planning was
underway for the Bay of Pigs invasion.
—ln 1964, candidate Lyndon
Johnson promised he would not bomb
Vietnam but his advisers were
studying bombing options on election
day.
—ln 1968, Nixon touted his "secret
peace plan" when in fact there was no
such plan.
—ln 1972, presidential adviser
Henry A. Kissinger's pre-election
statement that "peace is at hand" was
followed by 12 days of intensive
post-election bombing of North
Vietnam.
Monarchial Control
"Nixon wants to drop the facade of
a real congressional role in foreign
affairs," the Harvard-trained former
Marine said. "The real reason he is
attacking civil liberties is because he
wants to extend monarchial control
over domestic affairs."
Ellsberg, who is currently on trial in
Los Angeles on charges of conspiracy,
espionage and theft of government
property arising out of the release of
the study of U.S. involvement in
Vietnam, said that the "Papers" prove
"the degree to which we have given up
self-government in this country."
Ellsberg charged that his trial
represents an attack on press freedom

"because this is the first prosecution
of a news source. To prosecute a news
source," he said, "is to have the same
effect on the flow of information as
prosecuting a newsman."
Speaking with Ellsberg at the
conference, entitled "Might vs. Right
in America," was Steve Weissman, a
writer and editor who was one of the
founders of the Pacific Studies Center.
Sharply Critical
Weissman, like Ellsberg, a sharp
critic of the Nixon administration's
foreign and domestic policies, charged
that the United States plans to use
continued foreign aid to Southeast
Asia "to pursue the same aims they've
been following all along," which he
termed "anti-subversive."
He said domestic programs such as
the Great Society "didn't work ... on
the other hand, the programs were
never intended to work .. . there was
no consideration of providing jobs,
only job training." He termed the War
on Poverty "a containment exercise."
"Civil rights aren't enough," he
said. "We have to realize every
movement for redress in the United
States has had to step on the free
speech... or due process of the
people who stood on top.
"Beyond the Bill of Rights is the
right to rebel," he concluded.
