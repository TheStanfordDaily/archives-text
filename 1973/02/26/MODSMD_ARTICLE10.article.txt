# Executive Privilege And Truth
## Secrecy In Government 
### Paul N. McCloskey 
As the93rd Congress gets down to business, one
major issue is beginning to overshadow all others.
This is the constitutional readjustment of power
between the Executive and Legislative branches of
government in two areas, the setting of budget
priorities and the ascertainment of the truth.
In the second area, truth in (and about)
government, my own subcommittee on Foreign
Operations and Government Information has begun
hearings which may turn out to be as challenging
and exciting as any bill in Congress this year.
Secrecy
Last week the second Democrats and five
Republicans on the subcommittee unanimously
agreed that our top priority should be the revision
of the present laws relating to excessive secrecy on
the part of government and protection of the right
of privacy of the individual. With respect to the
secrecy question we will be confronting head on a
body of executive branch policies of secrecy which
has steadily increased under the administrations of
both 'parties since World War 11.
Chief among these policies has been the claim of
"executive privilege." First used by President
George Washington, the doctrine of executive
privilege has been tremendously expanded under the
Johnson and Nixon administrations.
Time and again, personnel from the executive
branch have declined to testify before congressional
committees on the basis of this claim of privilege.
Historically, executive privilege is supposed to be
claimed only when the national security would be
threatened, and only when release of the
information in question night jeopardize the
President's ability to get sound competent [Advice
from his subordinates.
Understandably, the Secretary of State, for
example, might be less than candid in advising the
President as to his options in delicate foreign
negotiations if he thought he would have to reveal
such advice to an antagonistic Congress the next
week.
Of late, however, Presidents and a whole range of

their advisers have been claiming executive privilege
on such a wide variety of matters that it now
appears any fact which might be embarrassing to an
Administration will be claimed to fall within the
privilege. Liast year, then-Deputy Attorney General
William Rehnquist (L.L.B.- Stanford, 1952) went so
far as to refuse to provide our committee with the
so-called Garwin Report adverse to the SST at the
same time that the Administration was asking for
Congressional approval of over $1 billion for the
SST.
Clearly, Congress cannot meet its constitutional
responsibilities on such matters without truthful
information. Thus it is that the hearings that we now
commence may well play a major part in resolving
whether or not Congress is going to meet its
avowed intention to again become a co-equal branch
of government.
Watergate and lITT
All five Republicans on the subcommittee have
agreed to sponsor a bill to limit future claims of
executive privilege solely to matters of advice to the
President affecting national security. In this, we will
be on a square collision course with present White
House practices. Should the bill be enacted into law,
for example, ex-Attorney General Mitchell would
have to testify about the Watergate scandal. The
refusal of Presidential aides €harles Colson and
Peter Flannigan to discuss the ITT affair could
hardly be defended on the basis that the President
required confidential advice on this subject.
Hopefully a compromise can be worked out
which would permit the White House to operate
effectively and to permit Congress to get all the
truth which can be told without endangering the
national security. The hearings should be extremely
interesting and will probably last through June.
If any reader knows of a specific example of
excessive government secret or improper invasion of
privacy which the committee should consider I
would appreciate hearing from you.

and exciting as any bill in Congress this year.
Secrecy
Last week the second Democrats and five
Republicans on the subcommittee unanimously
agreed that our top priority should be the revision
of the present laws relating to excessive secrecy on
the part of government and protection of the right
of privacy of the individual. With respect to the
secrecy question we will be confronting head on a
body of executive branch policies of secrecy which
has steadily increased under the administrations of
both 'parties since World War 11.
Chief among these policies has been the claim of
"executive privilege." First used by President
George Washington, the doctrine of executive
privilege has been tremendously expanded under the
Johnson and Nixon administrations.
Time and again, personnel from the executive
branch have declined to testify before congressional
committees on the basis of this claim of privilege.
Historically, executive privilege is supposed to be
claimed only when the national security would be
threatened, and only when release of the
information in question night jeopardize the
President's ability to get sound competent [Advice
from his subordinates.
Understandably, the Secretary of State, for
example, might be less than candid in advising the
President as to his options in delicate foreign
negotiations if he thought he would have to reveal
such advice to an antagonistic Congress the next
week.
Of late, however, Presidents and a whole range of

their advisers have been claiming executive privilege
on such a wide variety of matters that it now
appears any fact which might be embarrassing to an
Administration will be claimed to fall within the
privilege. Liast year, then-Deputy Attorney General
William Rehnquist (L.L.B.- Stanford, 1952) went so
far as to refuse to provide our committee with the
so-called Garwin Report adverse to the SST at the
same time that the Administration was asking for
Congressional approval of over $1 billion for the
SST.
Clearly, Congress cannot meet its constitutional
responsibilities on such matters without truthful
information. Thus it is that the hearings that we now
commence may well play a major part in resolving
whether or not Congress is going to meet its
avowed intention to again become a co-equal branch
of government.
Watergate and lITT
All five Republicans on the subcommittee have
agreed to sponsor a bill to limit future claims of
executive privilege solely to matters of advice to the
President affecting national security. In this, we will
be on a square collision course with present White
House practices. Should the bill be enacted into law,
for example, ex-Attorney General Mitchell would
have to testify about the Watergate scandal. The
refusal of Presidential aides €harles Colson and
Peter Flannigan to discuss the ITT affair could
hardly be defended on the basis that the President
required confidential advice on this subject.
Hopefully a compromise can be worked out
which would permit the White House to operate
effectively and to permit Congress to get all the
truth which can be told without endangering the
national security. The hearings should be extremely
interesting and will probably last through June.
If any reader knows of a specific example of
excessive government secret or improper invasion of
privacy which the committee should consider I
would appreciate hearing from you.
(Paul N. "Pete" McCloskey Jr. is Congressman
from California's seventeenth district.)
As the93rd Congress gets down to business, one
major issue is beginning to overshadow all others.
This is the constitutional readjustment of power
between the Executive and Legislative branches of
government in two areas, the setting of budget
priorities and the ascertainment of the truth.
In the second area, truth in (and about)
government, my own subcommittee on Foreign
Operations and Government Information has begun
hearings which may turn out to be as challenging
and exciting as any bill in Congress this year.
