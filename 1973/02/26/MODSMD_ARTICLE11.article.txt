Empathy for McKay
Editor:
I think it's time to beat our
swords into plowshares on the
charges and countercharges of
what happened after last year's
USC game. I talked at length with
John McKay in the presence of all
Pac-Eight athletic directors last
December and learned of several
incidents that happened before
and after last year's game. I have
no intention of making them
public, but I do have some
empathy for what he went
through.
Frankly, I'm pleased that John
has accepted our invitation to talk
to our graduating seniors. He
represents a sister private
institution that I learned to know
and respect academically and
athletically during the seven
years I spent in Stanford's Los
Angeles Office. John was named
Coach of the Year by his peers.
He is a fine speaker and he is as
interested in the academic and
athletic welfare of the young men
who play for him as we are of our
own student-athletes.
While John and I have
disagreed on occasion ... I admire
and respect his frankness as I
believe he does mine. I believe it is

important that a start be made on
"defusing" the vendetta syndrome
that appears to be building
between the two schools fueled
by charges and countercharges in[
the press. I find this vendetta
attitude much more prevalent
among some of the avid fans and
alumni of the two schools than I
do among the coaching staffs and
players.

I am attempting to accumulate
some meaningful data for a
serious study on American
communes. To that end, I wish to
reach as many communes as
possible by mail and in some cases
for personal interviews, if
agreeable.
I will be grateful if students,
graduate and undergraduate, who
are living in communal situations,
will write me indicating
willingness to receive a
questionnnaire. Size of commune
is unimportant.
