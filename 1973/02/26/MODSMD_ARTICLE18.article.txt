# Shuffling The Cards
## New Coach Finds Life Tough 
### Dave Robinson 
First year Washington State coach George
Raveling spent most of the past weekend ranting,
raving, and screaming at referees as his team
absorbed two solid thrashings against Stanford and
California. But Saturday afternoon, 15 hours after
the Cougars were humiliated by Cal 98-57 and an
hour before WSU's 59-44 loss to Stanford, Raveling
was calm and philisophical as he reflected on his
first year as a Pacific-Eight head caoch
"It takes time to build a quality basketball
program," Raveling said. "We're like a small child
learning to walk—first you learn to crawl, then walk,
and finally run."
Raveling's team currently occupies the Pac-8
cellar with a 1-10 league record. The Cougars are
5-17 overall. "We're basically a young team,"
Raveling said. "We're the most inexperienced team
in the Pac-B—possibly the most inexperienced Pac-8
team in the last 10 years. We'll be young again next
year and it will probably be two or three years
before we can make any serious inroads into the
league."
Coached Under Driesell
As the first black head coach in the conference,
Raveling has already made serious inroads himself.
After serving as an assistant coach under Jack Kraft
at Villanova for seven years and under Lefty Driesell
at Maryland the past three years, Raveling was hired
last fall to rejuvenate Washington State's
floundering basketball program.
"George wasn't hired because he's black," said
Max Shapiro, a former scout for the NBA's San
Diego Rockets and close friend of Raveling's. "It
wasn't a case of 'Let's find the best black coach."
Washington State just took the best man available,
and that man was George Raveling."
Raveling brought enthusiasm and a unique
coaching philosophy to Pullman. "A lot of coaches
look at coaching as an impersonal thing," Raveling
said, "but I can't be that way. I try to be honest
with my kids. I don't bullshit my players—l try to
treat them like my sons. When they're happy, I'm
happy.

"At the end of four years, I want my players to
feel they're a little better person because they
rubbed shoulders with George Raveling."
The strongest impression most fans and officials
have of Raveling concerns his animated behavior on
the bench during games. After just six minutes of
his first game as a Pac-8 coach, Raveling was charged
with a technical foul. "It's just my nature," he said.
"I just couldn't sit on the bench and roll up a
program and sit there calm and collected. I agree
with A1 McGuire—a team should be an extension of
its coach's personality. I guess if I had guys like
Walton and Wilkes I might be able to stay calm,
though."
Raveling's courtside behavior may be slightly
volatile, but an extremely sensitive George Raveling
is evident when he discusses racial issues and his role
as a black coach. "I think there will be more black
coaches in the near future," he says, emphasizing
that "black coaches should be and want to be
judged by their individual merits."
'Conquered Race Issue
Raveling has found his relationship with the WSU
players to be a revealing experience. "I think young'
people have the most mature attitude toward the
race issue in the history of the country.
"Young kids just want to know if 'you can do
the job for me or not," Raveling says of his
experience with high school recruits, and points out
that his best recruiting receptions have ironically
come from white parents.
Washington State's disappointing season hasn't
dulled Raveling's enthusiasm to any extent. "People
forget that John Wooden has coached 24 years at
UCLA. Through patience and organization he built
his program into the greatest one of all time."
There is certainly no evidence of Wooden's
dynasty crumbling in the near future, but if it's at
all possible for someone to stay in Pullman for 24
years, George Raveling may have Pac-8 fans looking
northward for basketball superiority in 1996.

"Young kids just want to know if 'you can do
the job for me or not," Raveling says of his
experience with high school recruits, and points out
that his best recruiting receptions have ironically
come from white parents.
Washington State's disappointing season hasn't
dulled Raveling's enthusiasm to any extent. "People
forget that John Wooden has coached 24 years at
UCLA. Through patience and organization he built
his program into the greatest one of all time."
There is certainly no evidence of Wooden's
dynasty crumbling in the near future, but if it's at
all possible for someone to stay in Pullman for 24
years, George Raveling may have Pac-8 fans looking
northward for basketball superiority in 1996.
First year Washington State coach George
Raveling spent most of the past weekend ranting,
raving, and screaming at referees as his team
absorbed two solid thrashings against Stanford and
California. But Saturday afternoon, 15 hours after
the Cougars were humiliated by Cal 98-57 and an
hour before WSU's 59-44 loss to Stanford, Raveling
was calm and philisophical as he reflected on his
first year as a Pacific-Eight head caoch
"It takes time to build a quality basketball
program," Raveling said. "We're like a small child
learning to walk—first you learn to crawl, then walk,
and finally run."
Raveling's team currently occupies the Pac-8
cellar with a 1-10 league record. The Cougars are
5-17 overall. "We're basically a young team,"
Raveling said. "We're the most inexperienced team
in the Pac-B—possibly the most inexperienced Pac-8
team in the last 10 years. We'll be young again next
year and it will probably be two or three years
before we can make any serious inroads into the
league."
Coached Under Driesell
As the first black head coach in the conference,
Raveling has already made serious inroads himself.
After serving as an assistant coach under Jack Kraft
at Villanova for seven years and under Lefty Driesell
at Maryland the past three years, Raveling was hired
last fall to rejuvenate Washington State's
floundering basketball program.
"George wasn't hired because he's black," said
Max Shapiro, a former scout for the NBA's San
Diego Rockets and close friend of Raveling's. "It
wasn't a case of 'Let's find the best black coach."
Washington State just took the best man available,
and that man was George Raveling."
Raveling brought enthusiasm and a unique
coaching philosophy to Pullman. "A lot of coaches
look at coaching as an impersonal thing," Raveling
said, "but I can't be that way. I try to be honest
with my kids. I don't bullshit my players—l try to
treat them like my sons. When they're happy, I'm
happy.

"At the end of four years, I want my players to
feel they're a little better person because they
rubbed shoulders with George Raveling."
The strongest impression most fans and officials
have of Raveling concerns his animated behavior on
the bench during games. After just six minutes of
his first game as a Pac-8 coach, Raveling was charged
with a technical foul. "It's just my nature," he said.
"I just couldn't sit on the bench and roll up a
program and sit there calm and collected. I agree
with A1 McGuire—a team should be an extension of
its coach's personality. I guess if I had guys like
Walton and Wilkes I might be able to stay calm,
though."
Raveling's courtside behavior may be slightly
volatile, but an extremely sensitive George Raveling
is evident when he discusses racial issues and his role
as a black coach. "I think there will be more black
coaches in the near future," he says, emphasizing
that "black coaches should be and want to be
judged by their individual merits."
'Conquered Race Issue
Raveling has found his relationship with the WSU
players to be a revealing experience. "I think young'
people have the most mature attitude toward the
race issue in the history of the country.
"Young kids just want to know if 'you can do
the job for me or not," Raveling says of his
experience with high school recruits, and points out
that his best recruiting receptions have ironically
come from white parents.
