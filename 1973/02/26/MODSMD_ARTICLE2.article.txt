# Security Officers Reach Accord
## 
### CHARLES BENNETT 
After nearly a year of haggling and
delays, the Stanford Public Safety
Department Officers Association and
the University have reached a tentative
agreement on their first contract,
according to University legal counsel
Douglas Barton.
Details of the accord are being
withheld pending ratification which is
expected to take place today. But Vice
President for Business and Finance
Robert Augsburger said there has been
compromise on both sides.
Two previous series of negotiations
have collapsed because the union
would not agree to the University's
demand that the new departmental
reorganization plan include the
demotion or dismissal of some of the
officers currently on the force.
Union President Albert King has
said in the past he would appeal any
such attempt by the University
directly to the National Labor
Relations Board.
It is not known how the tentative
contract resolves this issue. Augsburger
told the Daily last night that the
agreement was being drawn up in final

written form over the weekend, and
that he could not comment until
today.
But Public Safety Department
Director Marvin Herrington said last
night that some men would be hired
from outside the University to fill
patrol officer positions.
The lengthy dispute is known to
have frustrated Herrington in his
efforts to reform the department. The
major change contemplated for the
force is deputizing all the mobile
patrol officers as reserves in the Santa
Clara County Sheriff's Department. At
present, Stanford officers have no
more legal power than ordinary
citizens.
The reorganization also calls for
dividing the force to provide for an
unarmed community service division.
This step has already been taken, but
the present mobile patrol staff is
worried that some officers may be
demoted to community service status
at a loss in pay or even fired in favor
of men from outside who have been to
college. Herrington has said he prefers
men with college degrees for the
mobile division.

Officers have complained that all
this internal squabbling, added to
contempt at the hands of student
demonstrators last. year, has taken its
toll in department morale. Whether
the present agreement will improve
that may depend to a large degree on
how many of the present officers are
eventually deputized.
Security chief Herrington said last
night he is hoping to complete the
reorganization by next September,
although he says he has learned not to
make predictions.
Plans to deputize part of the force
grew out of a presidential commission
report in October, 1971. There was
hope for a while that the department
might gain legal "peace officer" status
through a special act of the legislature,
but that move died.
Then last February, the department
was forced to remove all references to
"police" .from its vehicles and
uniforms, including the removal of red
lights and sirens, when a Daily
investigation turned up evidence that
the department was acting illegally in
representing itself as a "police"
department unless it was deputized by

the county or state.
This was a blow to departmental
status, and further propelled
Herrington in his efforts to work out a
deputization agreement with the
Sheriff's department, which he did in
March, 1972.
But the union was formed at about
the same time, and the lack of a
contract has thwarted reorganization
ever since.
