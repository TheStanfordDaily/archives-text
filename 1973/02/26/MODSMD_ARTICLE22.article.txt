# Kelley, Mann Lead Weekend Sweep
## 
### STAN WILSON 
Sophomore center Rich Kelley
scored 39 points and grabbed 30
rebounds while forward Mike
Mann played as well as he's played
since the early season as the pair
led Stanford to a weekend sweep
over Washington and Washington
State at Maples Pavilion.
Kelley scored a game-high 28
points as the Cards downed the
Huskies 76-66 on Friday night.
On Saturday afternoon he pulled
down 18 rebounds and Mann
grabbed 17 more, as Stanford
defeated WSU 59-44 in the
Pac-Eight TV game of the week.
Kelley's 39 points leaves him
only 11 short of the mythical
"400 Point Club." Only 14 other
Stanford cagers have achieved that
distinction. Claude Terry tops the
list with 544 points in his 1971
season.
Stanford's two victories mark
the first time this season that the
Cards have recorded a weekend
sweep over Pac-Eight opponents.
The taller Cards outrebounded
both the Huskies and the Cougars,
pulling down 108 rebounds to the
opposition's 78 for the weekend.
On Friday night Stanford
turned in one of its better
performances as the Cards jumped
to a 10-0 lead only three minutes
into the game. Stanford led by 10
points three times in the first half,
but Huskie frosh Lars Hansen
kept the game close with some
fine shooting. The Cards were
ahead 38-35 at the intermission
on the strength of Kelley's 10
points. Guard Mark Gilberg added
eight more on bombs from the
23-foot range.
Washington Battles Back
Washington harrassed the Cards
with a press in the second half,
and this defense seemed to bother
Stanford somewhat. The Cardinals
were guilty of 10 turnovers after
the intermission, as Washington
battled back to take a 55-54 lead
with 10:59 to go in the game. It
looked as though a replay of the
Oregon disaster a week earlier
might be in the making.
Stanford head coach Howie
Dallmar explained that the Cards
were a little "too anxious" in
bringing the ball up against the
press. But Gilberg, who played the
entire game, did a fine • job
handling the ball.

Hansen, a 6-10 center, and
senior guard Louie Nelson led
the Huskie comeback try, as the
pair scored a string of 20 points
for Washington during an 11
minute stretch in the second
period. But Kelley countered with
18 points in the half, and a cold
spell from the free throw line
(6-14) doomed the Huskies.
Hansen, who went 9-15 from
the floor, and Nelson, who
connected on nine of 20 shots, led
Washington with 20 points apiece.
But the Huskies shot only 43
percent from the line and an
identical percentage from the
floor. With Kelley hitting 10 of
13 shots, Stanford hit 53 percent
from the field, and a mediocre 58
percent (14 of 24) from the line.
Saturday afternoon's low
scoring battle may have put the
TV audience to sleep, if the yawns
from 2600 fans present were any
indication. The highlight of the
afternoon was probably the
band's singing rendition of the
national anthem.
'Superior Size'
Still, Stanford played well
enough to win, avenging an earlier
loss to the Huskies in Pullman.
Dallmar explained that the Cards'
"superior size" was definitely the
deciding factor.
Cougar center Mike Dolven,
who scored 28 points in the first
encounter, managed only nine
points and six rebounds on
Saturday afternoon, after injuring
his ankle in Friday nights' loss to
Cal.
Washington State slowed the
Cards with a combination of zone
defenses, and Stanford connected
on only 25 of 70 shots for a
dismal 36 percent. But the shorter
Cougars were worse, managing to
make only 33 percent of their
shots, scoring 44 points in a
display that would make most
high school coaches shudder.
Junior guard Jim Montague
came off the bench to spell
Gilberg, who "lacked confidence"
in his shooting according to
Dallmar. "Jim did a great job
directing the club," Dallmar said
of the junior guard, who finished
with nine points. Dallmar also
singled out Mel Arterberry, who
showed some flashy moves while
scoring three important buckets in
the second half.

But the Huskies shot only 43
percent from the line and an
identical percentage from the
floor. With Kelley hitting 10 of
13 shots, Stanford hit 53 percent
from the field, and a mediocre 58
percent (14 of 24) from the line.
Saturday afternoon's low
scoring battle may have put the
TV audience to sleep, if the yawns
from 2600 fans present were any
indication. The highlight of the
afternoon was probably the
band's singing rendition of the
national anthem.
'Superior Size'
Still, Stanford played well
enough to win, avenging an earlier
loss to the Huskies in Pullman.
Dallmar explained that the Cards'
"superior size" was definitely the
deciding factor.
Cougar center Mike Dolven,
who scored 28 points in the first
encounter, managed only nine
points and six rebounds on
Saturday afternoon, after injuring
his ankle in Friday nights' loss to
Cal.
Washington State slowed the
Cards with a combination of zone
defenses, and Stanford connected
on only 25 of 70 shots for a
dismal 36 percent. But the shorter
Cougars were worse, managing to
make only 33 percent of their
shots, scoring 44 points in a
display that would make most
high school coaches shudder.
Junior guard Jim Montague
came off the bench to spell
Gilberg, who "lacked confidence"
in his shooting according to
Dallmar. "Jim did a great job
directing the club," Dallmar said
of the junior guard, who finished
with nine points. Dallmar also
singled out Mel Arterberry, who
showed some flashy moves while
scoring three important buckets in
the second half.

CONTROLLING THE BOARDS-Stanford's Scott Trobbe (43) and
Mike Mann (15), battle for a rebound during Saturday's victory over
Washington State. The Cards outrebounded Washington and
Washington State 108-78 over the weekend.
Sophomore center Rich Kelley
scored 39 points and grabbed 30
rebounds while forward Mike
Mann played as well as he's played
since the early season as the pair
led Stanford to a weekend sweep
over Washington and Washington
State at Maples Pavilion.
Kelley scored a game-high 28
points as the Cards downed the
Huskies 76-66 on Friday night.
On Saturday afternoon he pulled
down 18 rebounds and Mann
grabbed 17 more, as Stanford
defeated WSU 59-44 in the
Pac-Eight TV game of the week.
Kelley's 39 points leaves him
only 11 short of the mythical
"400 Point Club." Only 14 other
Stanford cagers have achieved that
distinction. Claude Terry tops the
list with 544 points in his 1971
season.
Stanford's two victories mark
the first time this season that the
Cards have recorded a weekend
sweep over Pac-Eight opponents.
The taller Cards outrebounded
both the Huskies and the Cougars,
pulling down 108 rebounds to the
opposition's 78 for the weekend.
On Friday night Stanford
turned in one of its better
performances as the Cards jumped
to a 10-0 lead only three minutes
into the game. Stanford led by 10
points three times in the first half,
but Huskie frosh Lars Hansen
kept the game close with some
fine shooting. The Cards were
ahead 38-35 at the intermission
on the strength of Kelley's 10
points. Guard Mark Gilberg added
eight more on bombs from the
23-foot range.
Washington Battles Back
Washington harrassed the Cards
with a press in the second half,
and this defense seemed to bother
Stanford somewhat. The Cardinals
were guilty of 10 turnovers after
the intermission, as Washington
battled back to take a 55-54 lead
with 10:59 to go in the game. It
looked as though a replay of the
Oregon disaster a week earlier
might be in the making.
Stanford head coach Howie
Dallmar explained that the Cards
were a little "too anxious" in
bringing the ball up against the
press. But Gilberg, who played the
entire game, did a fine • job
handling the ball.

Hansen, a 6-10 center, and
senior guard Louie Nelson led
the Huskie comeback try, as the
pair scored a string of 20 points
for Washington during an 11
minute stretch in the second
period. But Kelley countered with
18 points in the half, and a cold
spell from the free throw line
(6-14) doomed the Huskies.
Hansen, who went 9-15 from
the floor, and Nelson, who
connected on nine of 20 shots, led
Washington with 20 points apiece.

Stanford's two victories mark
the first time this season that the
Cards have recorded a weekend
sweep over Pac-Eight opponents.
The taller Cards outrebounded
both the Huskies and the Cougars,
pulling down 108 rebounds to the
opposition's 78 for the weekend.
On Friday night Stanford
turned in one of its better
performances as the Cards jumped
to a 10-0 lead only three minutes
into the game. Stanford led by 10
points three times in the first half,
but Huskie frosh Lars Hansen
kept the game close with some
fine shooting. The Cards were
ahead 38-35 at the intermission
on the strength of Kelley's 10
points. Guard Mark Gilberg added
eight more on bombs from the
23-foot range.
Washington Battles Back
Washington harrassed the Cards
with a press in the second half,
and this defense seemed to bother
Stanford somewhat. The Cardinals
were guilty of 10 turnovers after
the intermission, as Washington
battled back to take a 55-54 lead
with 10:59 to go in the game. It
looked as though a replay of the
Oregon disaster a week earlier
might be in the making.
Stanford head coach Howie
Dallmar explained that the Cards
were a little "too anxious" in
bringing the ball up against the
press. But Gilberg, who played the
entire game, did a fine • job
handling the ball.

Hansen, a 6-10 center, and
senior guard Louie Nelson led
the Huskie comeback try, as the
pair scored a string of 20 points
for Washington during an 11
minute stretch in the second
period. But Kelley countered with
18 points in the half, and a cold
spell from the free throw line
(6-14) doomed the Huskies.
Hansen, who went 9-15 from
the floor, and Nelson, who
connected on nine of 20 shots, led
Washington with 20 points apiece.
But the Huskies shot only 43
percent from the line and an
identical percentage from the
floor. With Kelley hitting 10 of
13 shots, Stanford hit 53 percent
from the field, and a mediocre 58
percent (14 of 24) from the line.
Saturday afternoon's low
scoring battle may have put the
TV audience to sleep, if the yawns
from 2600 fans present were any
indication. The highlight of the
afternoon was probably the
band's singing rendition of the
national anthem.
'Superior Size'
Still, Stanford played well
enough to win, avenging an earlier
loss to the Huskies in Pullman.
Dallmar explained that the Cards'
"superior size" was definitely the
deciding factor.
Cougar center Mike Dolven,
who scored 28 points in the first
encounter, managed only nine
points and six rebounds on
Saturday afternoon, after injuring
his ankle in Friday nights' loss to
Cal.
Washington State slowed the
Cards with a combination of zone
defenses, and Stanford connected
on only 25 of 70 shots for a
dismal 36 percent. But the shorter
Cougars were worse, managing to
make only 33 percent of their
shots, scoring 44 points in a
display that would make most
high school coaches shudder.
Junior guard Jim Montague
came off the bench to spell
Gilberg, who "lacked confidence"
in his shooting according to
Dallmar. "Jim did a great job
directing the club," Dallmar said
of the junior guard, who finished
with nine points. Dallmar also
singled out Mel Arterberry, who
showed some flashy moves while
scoring three important buckets in
the second half.
