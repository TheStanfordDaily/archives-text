Saigon Charges Missle Violations
SAIGON The South Vietnamese delegation to the
four-party Joint Military Commission charged today that
North Vietnam moved Soviet-built SAM 2 missile batteries
into Quang Tri Province after the cease-fire began, in
violation of the peace agreement. The province is just
below the demilitarized zone that divides the two
Vietnams.
The South Vietnamese side raised the issue at this
morning's meeting of the chief delegates of the four
parties, which also include the United States, North
Vietnam and the Viet Cong.
"The government of South Vietnam expressed concern
about the positioning of SAM 2 missile sites in the Khe
Sanh area," said a source close to the Joint Military
Commission.
He said the Saigon government charged that
intelligence showed the Communists had set up three
surface-to-air missile sites in the Khe Sanh area, which has
been under the control of the North Vietnamese for more
than a year.
At the meeting, the South Vietnamese side said the
sites had been established within the past two weeks,
calling this "a grave violation of the cease-fire" that went
into effect Jan. 28.
Bangladesh Proposes Civilian Swap
NATORE, Bangledesh Prime Minister Mujibur Rahman
proposed yesterday that Bangladesh and Pakistan
immediately swap hundreds of thousands of unwanted
civilians. He indicated that if Pakistan doesn't agree, he
might dump 300,000 non-Bengali Moslems in the lap of
the world community.
Mujib said Bangladesh has no room for the members of
the Urdu-speaking Bihari minority who have told his
Bengali government they would rather live in Pakistan.
If Pakistan rejects them, he said, "the world
community should purchase an island for them."
Mujib's exchange proposal envisions trade of the
dissatisfied Biharis, still living in refugee camps 15 months
after Bangladesh was born of what was East Pakistan in
the 1971 India-Pakistan war, for as many as 400,000
Bengalis stranded in Pakistan by the war.
The offer went beyond a proposal already under
consideration by India, Pakistan and Bangladesh to
repatriate about 6,000 Pakistani women and children held
in India in exchange for 10,000 Bengali dependents in
Pakistan.
Mujib said the offer would not apply to 70,000
Pakistani military prisoners held in India, although he
refused to rule out the possibility that the 20,000 civilian
and paramilitary internees might be involved.
Some of the military men, he said, sitting under a
mango tree and looking relaxed after a day of
campaigning for next week's general elections, will be put
on trial on war crimes charges "very soon." He did not
specify when or how many.

Israelis Claim Pilot Unqualified
TEL AVIV The Israelis said yesterday they found the
license of the French pilot who flew the Libyan jetliner
downed last week in the Sinai Desert, and the license did
not qualify him as a pilot for that type of aircraft.
The government also said it would offer payment to
families of victims in the air tragedy—but as a gesture of
kindness, not as admission of Israeli guilt.
A government press office statement said the pilot,
Capt. Jacques Bourges, was qualified only as a copilot for
the French Caravelle jetliner and several propeller-driven
craft.
The Libyan craft was a trijet Boeing 727 which, the
Israelis claimed, was not listed on Bourges' flying permit.
Israeli warplanes fired on the Libyan jetliner last
Wednesday, forcing it to crash land after the airliner
strayed off course and flew over Israeli military positions
along the Suez Canal. Of the 113 persons aboard, 106
died. Bourges was among the victims.
A communique from the weekly Israeli Cabinet session
said: "In deference to humanitarian considerations, the
government resolves its readiness to effect ex-gratia
payments to the families of the victims."
A spokesman said the word "compensation" was
deliberately not used because it would imply "Israeli guilt
for the incident."
No U.S. POW Releases Scheduled
SAIGON The Communist side failed yesterday to give
the United States a list of the American prisoners
scheduled for release this week in North and South
Vietnam or to fix a specific day, time and place to hand
them over U.S. spokesmen said.
There was no official reason given. But the Communist
side was embittered by rock-throwing, banner-waving,
shouting mobs of South Vietnamese numbering in the
hundreds who attacked North Vietnamese compounds in
the northern cities of Hue and Da Nang. The
demonstrations apparently were tacitly sanctioned by the
Saigon government, but got out of hand.
Seven North Vietnamese delegates to the four-party
Joint Military Commission and two South Vietnamese
policemen were reported injured. The chief spokesman for
the North Vietnamese delegation, Bui Tin, said four of the
Communist delegates were seriously wounded in the Hue
demonstration.
The U.S. Command announced today that the
withdrawal of American forces from Vietnam was slightly
more than 50 percent completed at the halfway mark of
the 60-day deadline set for withdrawal and prisoner
release.
Today's Weather
Rain at times early today, then becoming partly cloudy
with chance of showers. Rain likely again tonight and
tomorrow. Little temperature change. Lows both nights in
mid 40s to low 50s. High today in upper 50s to low 60s.
Chance of rain 80 percent today and 70 percent tonight.

Vietnam and the Viet Cong.
"The government of South Vietnam expressed concern
about the positioning of SAM 2 missile sites in the Khe
Sanh area," said a source close to the Joint Military
Commission.
He said the Saigon government charged that
intelligence showed the Communists had set up three
surface-to-air missile sites in the Khe Sanh area, which has
been under the control of the North Vietnamese for more
than a year.
At the meeting, the South Vietnamese side said the
sites had been established within the past two weeks,
calling this "a grave violation of the cease-fire" that went
into effect Jan. 28.
Bangladesh Proposes Civilian Swap
NATORE, Bangledesh Prime Minister Mujibur Rahman
proposed yesterday that Bangladesh and Pakistan
immediately swap hundreds of thousands of unwanted
civilians. He indicated that if Pakistan doesn't agree, he
might dump 300,000 non-Bengali Moslems in the lap of
the world community.
Mujib said Bangladesh has no room for the members of
the Urdu-speaking Bihari minority who have told his
Bengali government they would rather live in Pakistan.
If Pakistan rejects them, he said, "the world
community should purchase an island for them."
Mujib's exchange proposal envisions trade of the
dissatisfied Biharis, still living in refugee camps 15 months
after Bangladesh was born of what was East Pakistan in
the 1971 India-Pakistan war, for as many as 400,000
Bengalis stranded in Pakistan by the war.
The offer went beyond a proposal already under
consideration by India, Pakistan and Bangladesh to
repatriate about 6,000 Pakistani women and children held
in India in exchange for 10,000 Bengali dependents in
Pakistan.
Mujib said the offer would not apply to 70,000
Pakistani military prisoners held in India, although he
refused to rule out the possibility that the 20,000 civilian
and paramilitary internees might be involved.
Some of the military men, he said, sitting under a
mango tree and looking relaxed after a day of
campaigning for next week's general elections, will be put
on trial on war crimes charges "very soon." He did not
specify when or how many.

Israelis Claim Pilot Unqualified
TEL AVIV The Israelis said yesterday they found the
license of the French pilot who flew the Libyan jetliner
downed last week in the Sinai Desert, and the license did
not qualify him as a pilot for that type of aircraft.
The government also said it would offer payment to
families of victims in the air tragedy—but as a gesture of
kindness, not as admission of Israeli guilt.
A government press office statement said the pilot,
Capt. Jacques Bourges, was qualified only as a copilot for
the French Caravelle jetliner and several propeller-driven
craft.
The Libyan craft was a trijet Boeing 727 which, the
Israelis claimed, was not listed on Bourges' flying permit.
Israeli warplanes fired on the Libyan jetliner last
Wednesday, forcing it to crash land after the airliner
strayed off course and flew over Israeli military positions
along the Suez Canal. Of the 113 persons aboard, 106
died. Bourges was among the victims.
A communique from the weekly Israeli Cabinet session
said: "In deference to humanitarian considerations, the
government resolves its readiness to effect ex-gratia
payments to the families of the victims."
A spokesman said the word "compensation" was
deliberately not used because it would imply "Israeli guilt
for the incident."
No U.S. POW Releases Scheduled
SAIGON The Communist side failed yesterday to give
the United States a list of the American prisoners
scheduled for release this week in North and South
Vietnam or to fix a specific day, time and place to hand
them over U.S. spokesmen said.
There was no official reason given. But the Communist
side was embittered by rock-throwing, banner-waving,
shouting mobs of South Vietnamese numbering in the
hundreds who attacked North Vietnamese compounds in
the northern cities of Hue and Da Nang. The
demonstrations apparently were tacitly sanctioned by the
Saigon government, but got out of hand.
Seven North Vietnamese delegates to the four-party
Joint Military Commission and two South Vietnamese
policemen were reported injured. The chief spokesman for
the North Vietnamese delegation, Bui Tin, said four of the
Communist delegates were seriously wounded in the Hue
demonstration.
The U.S. Command announced today that the
withdrawal of American forces from Vietnam was slightly
more than 50 percent completed at the halfway mark of
the 60-day deadline set for withdrawal and prisoner
release.
Today's Weather
Rain at times early today, then becoming partly cloudy
with chance of showers. Rain likely again tonight and
tomorrow. Little temperature change. Lows both nights in
mid 40s to low 50s. High today in upper 50s to low 60s.
Chance of rain 80 percent today and 70 percent tonight.
Saigon Charges Missle Violations
SAIGON The South Vietnamese delegation to the
four-party Joint Military Commission charged today that
North Vietnam moved Soviet-built SAM 2 missile batteries
into Quang Tri Province after the cease-fire began, in
violation of the peace agreement. The province is just
below the demilitarized zone that divides the two
Vietnams.
The South Vietnamese side raised the issue at this

sites had been established within the past two weeks,
calling this "a grave violation of the cease-fire" that went
into effect Jan. 28.
Bangladesh Proposes Civilian Swap
NATORE, Bangledesh Prime Minister Mujibur Rahman
proposed yesterday that Bangladesh and Pakistan
immediately swap hundreds of thousands of unwanted
civilians. He indicated that if Pakistan doesn't agree, he
might dump 300,000 non-Bengali Moslems in the lap of
the world community.
Mujib said Bangladesh has no room for the members of
the Urdu-speaking Bihari minority who have told his
Bengali government they would rather live in Pakistan.
If Pakistan rejects them, he said, "the world
community should purchase an island for them."
Mujib's exchange proposal envisions trade of the
dissatisfied Biharis, still living in refugee camps 15 months
after Bangladesh was born of what was East Pakistan in
the 1971 India-Pakistan war, for as many as 400,000
Bengalis stranded in Pakistan by the war.
The offer went beyond a proposal already under
consideration by India, Pakistan and Bangladesh to
repatriate about 6,000 Pakistani women and children held
in India in exchange for 10,000 Bengali dependents in
Pakistan.
Mujib said the offer would not apply to 70,000
Pakistani military prisoners held in India, although he
refused to rule out the possibility that the 20,000 civilian
and paramilitary internees might be involved.
Some of the military men, he said, sitting under a
mango tree and looking relaxed after a day of
campaigning for next week's general elections, will be put
on trial on war crimes charges "very soon." He did not
specify when or how many.

Israelis Claim Pilot Unqualified
TEL AVIV The Israelis said yesterday they found the
license of the French pilot who flew the Libyan jetliner
downed last week in the Sinai Desert, and the license did
not qualify him as a pilot for that type of aircraft.
The government also said it would offer payment to
families of victims in the air tragedy—but as a gesture of
kindness, not as admission of Israeli guilt.
A government press office statement said the pilot,
Capt. Jacques Bourges, was qualified only as a copilot for
the French Caravelle jetliner and several propeller-driven
craft.
The Libyan craft was a trijet Boeing 727 which, the
Israelis claimed, was not listed on Bourges' flying permit.
Israeli warplanes fired on the Libyan jetliner last
Wednesday, forcing it to crash land after the airliner
strayed off course and flew over Israeli military positions
along the Suez Canal. Of the 113 persons aboard, 106
died. Bourges was among the victims.
A communique from the weekly Israeli Cabinet session
said: "In deference to humanitarian considerations, the
government resolves its readiness to effect ex-gratia
payments to the families of the victims."
A spokesman said the word "compensation" was
deliberately not used because it would imply "Israeli guilt
for the incident."
No U.S. POW Releases Scheduled
SAIGON The Communist side failed yesterday to give
the United States a list of the American prisoners
scheduled for release this week in North and South
Vietnam or to fix a specific day, time and place to hand
them over U.S. spokesmen said.
There was no official reason given. But the Communist
side was embittered by rock-throwing, banner-waving,
shouting mobs of South Vietnamese numbering in the
hundreds who attacked North Vietnamese compounds in
the northern cities of Hue and Da Nang. The
demonstrations apparently were tacitly sanctioned by the
Saigon government, but got out of hand.
Seven North Vietnamese delegates to the four-party
Joint Military Commission and two South Vietnamese
policemen were reported injured. The chief spokesman for
the North Vietnamese delegation, Bui Tin, said four of the
Communist delegates were seriously wounded in the Hue
demonstration.
The U.S. Command announced today that the
withdrawal of American forces from Vietnam was slightly
more than 50 percent completed at the halfway mark of
the 60-day deadline set for withdrawal and prisoner
release.
Today's Weather
Rain at times early today, then becoming partly cloudy
with chance of showers. Rain likely again tonight and
tomorrow. Little temperature change. Lows both nights in
mid 40s to low 50s. High today in upper 50s to low 60s.
Chance of rain 80 percent today and 70 percent tonight.
Saigon Charges Missle Violations
SAIGON The South Vietnamese delegation to the
four-party Joint Military Commission charged today that
North Vietnam moved Soviet-built SAM 2 missile batteries
into Quang Tri Province after the cease-fire began, in
violation of the peace agreement. The province is just
below the demilitarized zone that divides the two
Vietnams.
The South Vietnamese side raised the issue at this
morning's meeting of the chief delegates of the four
parties, which also include the United States, North
Vietnam and the Viet Cong.
"The government of South Vietnam expressed concern
about the positioning of SAM 2 missile sites in the Khe
Sanh area," said a source close to the Joint Military
Commission.
He said the Saigon government charged that
intelligence showed the Communists had set up three
surface-to-air missile sites in the Khe Sanh area, which has
been under the control of the North Vietnamese for more
than a year.
At the meeting, the South Vietnamese side said the
sites had been established within the past two weeks,
calling this "a grave violation of the cease-fire" that went
into effect Jan. 28.
