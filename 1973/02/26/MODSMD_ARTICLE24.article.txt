# Statement Of Rights Urged For University Community
## 
### 
By BRUCE KADDEN
Members of the Stanford
Committee On Political Education
(SCOPE) and the Faculty Political
Action Group (FPAG) are circulating
petitions urging University President
Richard Lyman to "immediately
prepare and promulgate a 'Statement
of Rights guaranteed to Stanford
University students, faculty and
staff.'"
The petition sets three guidelines
for the "Statement of Rights:" that it
should include all "rights guaranteed
by the Bill of Rights of the U.S.
Constitution;" that it include all
"rights guaranteed by the Constitution
and Laws of the State of California,"
and that it include "special rights
essential to the conduct of a
university."
The petition defines the last
guideline to include the rights "to
freely associate with others without
surveillance" and "to confidentiality
of records."
'Restoration of Rights'
Brent Appel, ASSU vice president,
explained the "historical background"
of the petition. "The student
[legislative and] Judicial Charter of
1968 guaranteed students extensive
rights, but it was suspended in 1971
when the Campus Judicial Panel was
formed. What we're really doing is

asking for a restoration of rights."
The petition explains that "in a
time of increasing power of the
institution over the individual, it is
becoming increasingly important for
all government and other authority to
recognize and guarantee these rights.
"Continuation of the current trend
in the nation (exemplified by the
recent attack on the news media) gives
good reason to fear that the basic
traditions necessary for the survival of
a democracy may be destroyed.
"If we are to prevent this from
occurring, it is essential that we take
action at both local and national levels
to declare overtly our adherence to
these traditions and our intention to
defend them," the petition states.

SCOPE was formed last fall by
people who supported Sen. George
McGovern (D—S.D.) for President, and
who saw the need for an ongoing
organization to plan and coordinate
projects here related to the issues of
the McGovern campaign.
Appel said several hundred
signatures have been gathered, but did
not state a specific goal. "When we
feel we've done a good enough job we
will present them to Lyman," he said.
When contacted Friday, William
Stone, Assistant to the President, said
that Lyman had not had a chance to
see the petition and "would not want
to comment on it until he's read it
thoroughly."

university."
The petition defines the last
guideline to include the rights "to
freely associate with others without
surveillance" and "to confidentiality
of records."
'Restoration of Rights'
Brent Appel, ASSU vice president,
explained the "historical background"
of the petition. "The student
[legislative and] Judicial Charter of
1968 guaranteed students extensive
rights, but it was suspended in 1971
when the Campus Judicial Panel was
formed. What we're really doing is

asking for a restoration of rights."
The petition explains that "in a
time of increasing power of the
institution over the individual, it is
becoming increasingly important for
all government and other authority to
recognize and guarantee these rights.
"Continuation of the current trend
in the nation (exemplified by the
recent attack on the news media) gives
good reason to fear that the basic
traditions necessary for the survival of
a democracy may be destroyed.
"If we are to prevent this from
occurring, it is essential that we take
action at both local and national levels
to declare overtly our adherence to
these traditions and our intention to
defend them," the petition states.

SCOPE was formed last fall by
people who supported Sen. George
McGovern (D—S.D.) for President, and
who saw the need for an ongoing
organization to plan and coordinate
projects here related to the issues of
the McGovern campaign.
Appel said several hundred
signatures have been gathered, but did
not state a specific goal. "When we
feel we've done a good enough job we
will present them to Lyman," he said.
When contacted Friday, William
Stone, Assistant to the President, said
that Lyman had not had a chance to
see the petition and "would not want
to comment on it until he's read it
thoroughly."
