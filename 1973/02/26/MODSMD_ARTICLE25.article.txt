# Presidential Adviser Returns To Teaching
## 
### 
Ezra Solomon, a member of
President Nixon's Council of
Economic Advisers (CEA), will return
to his professorship here spring
quarter.
Solomon, who is on leave from the
Dean Witter chair of finance in the

Graduate School of Business (GSB),
confirmed last week in Washington
that he will shortly resign from the
government post.
He joined the CEA in September
1971, taking an 18-month leave of
absence from the University.
An expert in international finance
and corporate financial management,
Solomon has directed governmental
economic forecasting activity while on
the CEA.
He will visit the campus Wednesday
to address the 1972 Stanford Business
Conference sponsored by the GSB
alumni association. At that time, he will
speak on domestic implications of the
recently-released 1973 Economic
Report of the President.
Solomon has attracted less public
attention than have his two colleagues
on the Council, Herbert Stein and
Marina V. Whitman. Their
responsibilities include international
monetary policy and inflation.
He has, however, received high
praise from economists for his
economic forecasting work.
