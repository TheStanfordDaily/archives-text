# Yale Chaplain Says Objectifying Knowledge Has Hurt University-Religion Relationship
## 
### CHESS ERWIN 
Yale University Chaplain William
Sloane Coffin, Jr. said in a sermon at
Memorial Church yesterday that the
relationship between universities,
religion, and men had been damaged
by what he termed "an intense desire
to objectify all knowledge at the
expense of love and humility."
Speaking before a large audience at
the University Public Worship service,
Coffin based his remarks on a book by
Theodore Rozak titled End of the
Wasteland. The book deals with the
nature of the relationship between
universities and the church, as well as
dealing with certain aspects of
ecology.
The principal cause of the split
between universities and the church
lies in the approach that universities

take to knowledge in general, Coffin
explained. "Chaplain's offices
throughout the country are filled with
students that are alienated from the
universities because the approach of
these institutions toward education
has deadened them."
"Man in his quest to master Nature
has plundered it strictly for his own
benefit and in so doing he has robbed
himself of the power of love and
communion with his fellow man and
with Nature," Coffin told his
audience.
Domination of knowledge through
science requires that whatever is being
studied be completely dissected. In so
doing, man is completing the supreme
act of alienation. Time and again, man
has made the same mistake and human
values themselves have been worn out.

Amplifying his earlier remarks,
Coffin went on to add that social
scientists and "teachers of the faith
alike" have been guilty of relying too
heavily on science for their standards
of objectivity. As before, this can
amount to nothing more than another
act of senseless alienation.
"Hardness and toughness of mind
and thought have overwhelmed human
tenderness as values that Americans, in
particular, hold in high regard.
Everything in our society must be
controlled and objectified."
Drawing on the philosophy of the
Enlightened era in Europe, Coffin
drew a picture of the historical
framework on which many of these
ideas were based. Americans, however,
have corrupted these philosophical
ideals to suit their own ends.

Referring again to the situation in
the nation's universities, Coffin went
on to say that in their quest to master
what surrounds them, these
institutions of higher learning have
"sacrificed splendor at the expense of
order." "Above all, the mind should
be the servant of the heart," because
in so doing all that man holds dear will
not be sacrificed at the expense of
rationality.
Ecology is of increasing importance
to us all in that the study of our
environment reveals to us repeatedly
the dichotomy man has created
between Nature and Nature's god. "If
this separation continues, all order will
eventually collapse," said Coffin.
"Bridging this gap and gaining more
knowledge requires above all else,
more love and humility by us all."

controlled and objectified."
Drawing on the philosophy of the
Enlightened era in Europe, Coffin
drew a picture of the historical
framework on which many of these
ideas were based. Americans, however,
have corrupted these philosophical
ideals to suit their own ends.

Referring again to the situation in
the nation's universities, Coffin went
on to say that in their quest to master
what surrounds them, these
institutions of higher learning have
"sacrificed splendor at the expense of
order." "Above all, the mind should
be the servant of the heart," because
in so doing all that man holds dear will
not be sacrificed at the expense of
rationality.
Ecology is of increasing importance
to us all in that the study of our
environment reveals to us repeatedly
the dichotomy man has created
between Nature and Nature's god. "If
this separation continues, all order will
eventually collapse," said Coffin.
"Bridging this gap and gaining more
knowledge requires above all else,
more love and humility by us all."
Yale University Chaplain William
Sloane Coffin, Jr. said in a sermon at
Memorial Church yesterday that the
relationship between universities,
religion, and men had been damaged
by what he termed "an intense desire
to objectify all knowledge at the
expense of love and humility."
Speaking before a large audience at
the University Public Worship service,
Coffin based his remarks on a book by
Theodore Rozak titled End of the
Wasteland. The book deals with the
nature of the relationship between
universities and the church, as well as
dealing with certain aspects of
ecology.
The principal cause of the split
between universities and the church
lies in the approach that universities

take to knowledge in general, Coffin
explained. "Chaplain's offices
throughout the country are filled with
students that are alienated from the
universities because the approach of
these institutions toward education
has deadened them."
"Man in his quest to master Nature
has plundered it strictly for his own
benefit and in so doing he has robbed
himself of the power of love and
communion with his fellow man and
with Nature," Coffin told his
audience.
Domination of knowledge through
science requires that whatever is being
studied be completely dissected. In so
doing, man is completing the supreme
act of alienation. Time and again, man
has made the same mistake and human
values themselves have been worn out.

Amplifying his earlier remarks,
Coffin went on to add that social
scientists and "teachers of the faith
alike" have been guilty of relying too
heavily on science for their standards
of objectivity. As before, this can
amount to nothing more than another
act of senseless alienation.
"Hardness and toughness of mind
and thought have overwhelmed human
tenderness as values that Americans, in
particular, hold in high regard.
Everything in our society must be
controlled and objectified."
