# Special Election Wednesday
## Law Firm Requests Funding 
### NANCI COLVERT 
Citizens Advocates at Stanford,
Inc., a public interest law firm, is
asking students to support a
refundable fee assessment in the ASSU
special election Wednesday, an
election they helped finance.
The group is asking for $1 per
quarter, for three quarters to fund its
operations—the "study, negotiation,

representation, and litigation of
problems affecting the general public,"
according to its flier.
The measure needs a simple
majority to pass.
Two specific areas in which the
group has considered taking action are
discrimination against women in
prisons, and welfare reform, according
to Conway Collis, law student and one
of Citizen's Advocates' organizers.
The final decision on which areas
will be pursued would be made by a
board of directors, created with a
student majority.
SWOPSI Course
A SWOPSI course would be
established to study each area, and
legal litigation of the case would be
the final result of the research done,
Collis said.
He stated that Citizens Advocates
would not act as a legal aid society to
deal with individual student problems,
but rather, with the types of
non-political and "social interests that
have interested students in the past."
Collis cited four benefits of the
group to Stanford students: giving
them a chance to receive credit,
through SWOPSI and independent
study, for social research; providing an
outlet for social involvement; giving
students interested in the legal
profession a chance to participate in it
first hand; and providing a means for
students to fulfill social obligations to
society through their involvement and
financial support.
A similar organization and

assessment was proposed last year but
failed to receive sufficient support.
Collis attributed this failure to lack of
adequate planning and other serious
flaws which he feels have been
corrected.
There would now be a student
majority on the Board which would
consist of five students at-large, and
two law students to be chosen in a
student body election, one law
professor, one non-law faculty
member, the SWOPSI director, and
three community members.
The corporation's by-laws stipulate
that two of the community members
must be members of the California Bar
Association, and that all non-student
members will be appointed by the
current board of directors.
Budget Cut
In addition, the proposed budget
for one year has been cut to
approximately $32,000, one third of
what was proposed last year, Collis
stated.
Only one attorney and one
para-legal assistant would be hired,
with more dependence on student
research.
According to Collis, the group's
current organizers, four law students
and four undergraduates, are not the
same as last year's.
"We're pretty much a separate
group, who thought that it was a good
idea but had a lot of problems," he
said.
"We kept the same articles of
