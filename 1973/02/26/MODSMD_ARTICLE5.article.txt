# Santa Cruz Students Don't Panic Despite Recent Killings

SANTA CRUZ—Like many of the 4800 students at
the University of California at Santa Cruz, Alice Liu
and Rosalind Thorpe were frequent hitchhikers. The
wooded UCSC campus is located three miles from
downtown Santa Cruz and students are assessed
$3.50 a quarter for bus service, but at peak hours
the system is plagued by overcrowding and there is a
half-hour wait between buses.
For many of the 2400 students who live off
campus, hitchhiking has been an everyday activity.
Thorpe and Liu hitchhiked for the last time in their
lives three weeks ago tonight. On Thursday, Feb.
15, their decapitated and mutilated bodies were
found in a remote canyon near Castro Valley, more
than 50 miles from Santa Cruz.
The bodies of two other women from Cabrillo
Junior College in nearby Aptos, who had last been
seen while hitchhiking, have also been found in
recent weeks in the Santa Cruz area. At least 11
female hitchhikers have reported rapes to the Santa
Cruz Police Department in the last four months.
Santa Cruz authorities have charged a 25 year old
former honor student, Herbert Mullin, with 10
recent murders' in the area, most of which appear to
have been drug-related. The district attorney has
labeled this coastal community of 31,000 "the
murder capital of the world." Mullin is not
considered to be connected with the murders and
rapes of hitchhikers.
Minimal Fear
Despite this ugly string of killings, Santa Cruz has
not become the city of fear one might expert. When
a leading Santa Cruz optometrist and his family

were murdered in their home in 1970, a wave of
fear did strike this resort area. Gun sales
skyrocketed as people feared a series of motiveless
murders.
But because most of the murders Mullin is
charged with involve drugs, community residents
don't feel as threatened as they did three years ago.
Gun dealers report only minor increases in sales and
one dealer even reported a decrease. Another dealer
attributed the increase to "50 year old women who
are going to protect their honor. Wishful thinking!"
One visible result of the killings of the four coeds
is a very noticeable reduction in hitchhiking. There
were very few hitchhikers at UC-Santa Cruz on
Friday and all were male.
Campus Reaction
People at the campus are obviously saddened by
the killings, but there is really no.intense fear there.
One student termed it the "typical UC-Santa Cruz
lack of reaction," but Tom O'Leary of the
University Relations office seemed to sum up the
prevailing feeling best when he said, "people have
intelligent concern, but there is no panic, fear or
uptightness. The campus is the safest place you
could be."
Sgt. John Durcan, acting campus police chief,
reiterated the obvious when he said, "at least going
off campus, hitchhiking is way down. It's really
knocked off." Despite attempts that are being made
to improve bus service and organize carpools to
remote areas, most students and Durcan are
skeptical about a permanent drop in hitchhiking.
Asked if the apprehension about hitching will

probably fade away, Durcan said, "yeah, it always
has in the past."
Mary Beth Libbey, editor of the campus
newspaper, said "I certainly won't hitchhike again,
ever." She admitted that she couldn't tell if most
female students would be as permanent in their
attitude change.
Women's Attitudes
A more typical attitude came from Connie
Maring, a senior studying Spanish Literature. Maring
said she had previously, hitchhiked, but like most
women on campus, she wasn't doing so any more.
When asked about the permanence of her attitude
she said, "I will keep it up for a month. I don't
know about after that."
A University staff member expressed concern
that women would start hitchhiking as soon as the
person(s) who committed these rapes and murders is
captured, "as if they would prevent someone else
from doing it." The next two women I spoke to
illustrated her fears.
"I probably will start again. But I will wait until
this guy is captured."
"If they catch that crazy dude, I might start
again."
Remorse and a dramatic drop in hitchhiking are
the main reactions to the deaths of Thorpe and Liu.
But most everyone is skeptical about a permanent
drop in hitching. Cindy Thornton, a UC—Riverside
student who was visiting Santa Cruz Friday summed
up the basis for that skepticism. Talking about
students at UCR, she said, "They are looking
around at Santa Cruz and saying 'Oh, my God!' But
most are still doing it."

TEMARIOUS THUMBER—Since police disclosed the most recent killings in a
string of Santa Cruz murders, the number of hitchhikers has dropped markedly,
and like one pictured last Friday, they were exclusively male.
