# Pre-Reg: The Rites Of Spring
## The 						Old Union Papers 
### Daniel Brenner 
As pre-registration for next
quarter blossoms soon, the typical
Stanford student realizes that he
hasn't even bought the
three-by-fives for his term paper,
let alone started the research.
Nevertheless it is time to plan for
the future, even though the
present quarter may be as Firmly
grasped as a slice of cheese-oozing
pizza.
Pre-reg has a bureaucratic
charm all its own. Akin to
ordering next quarter's supply of
brain food, the process calls for
fitting round quarters into square
holes. And since most students
perfer to shop before buying
anyway, the scribbles on the
pre-reg card bear only an
incidental resemblance to reality.
Speaking of incidental
resemblances to reality, a secret
copy of the "REJECTED
COURSES, SPRING QUARTER"
list recently was delivered to the
Daily in a lurid envelope marked,
"If your number appears on the
enclosed list, you've won a year's
subscription to The Stanford
Arena!"
The list contains those courses
which were suggested but never
made the Time Schedule. As a
public service, the Daily now
publishes the most provocative of
those courses:
PHYSICS 300: Eggs and
Acceleration (3). Properties of
dropping large grade AA eggs
from high altitudes. Students will
design systems for dropping eggs
from selected University
buildings. Prerequisite: Food
Research 21: Omelettes in Urban

Fiction in Politics (3-4). A survey
course covering the role of
half-truth in politics. Extra unit

Pentagon documents.
Overwhelming Relevance
ENGLISH 2348: The Oral
Tradition in Politics (3). A
research seminar devoted to
studying the methodology of
politicians in defining "truth,"
"honor," "guilt," and "benign
neglect." Political doubletalk will
be emphasized, and then again,
maybe it won't.
FRENCH 493: Advanced
Seminar on Franco-American
Cognates (2). Study of such

English terms as "le French toast"
and "le French dressing." The role
of Franco-American spaghetti on
linguistic patterns of American

of Chef Boy-ar-dee.

COMPUTER SCIENCE 370:
Social Uses of High Speed
Computer Print-outs (1-4). How
to make use of the reams of paper

required.
