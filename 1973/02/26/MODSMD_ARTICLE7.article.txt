# Intelligence As Survival
## Threats To Black Race 
### Cedric X 
The most important reason
why the IQ test is not a good test
of human intelligence is because it
occupies a theoretical vacuum in
terms of its ability to reflect an
adequate constitutive definition.
In plain language, the test is
irrelevant to what any reasonable
person would term intelligent
behavior.
There are many scientists who,
by this criterion, can be
considered "reasonable." These
scientists, most of whom are not
psychologists, define intelligence
as "the ability of a species (or
race) to survive." This is their
theoretical or "constitutive"
definition of intelligence.
It is a far better definition than
that sometimes given by
psychology textbooks, viz.
"intelligence is what IQ tests
measure." This latter definition is
circular and avoids answering the
basic questions.
Demonstrated Ability
Thus, when we begin to look at
within species, or between racial,
differences in intelligence, we
must make our judgments with
respect to that race's
demonstrated ability to survive,
not its score on cultural-specific
IQ tests.
The question, then, is: Has the
Black race demonstrated its
ability to survive, or hasn't it?
Like any other socially significant
question, the answer one gives
depends on where one is looking.
It is easy to marshall evidence
showing either (a) the Black race
is surviving and, therefore,
intelligent -or (b) the Black race is
not surviving and, therefore, is
unintelligent.
Because either answer can be
supported, it is instructive for us
to focus our attention on trends,
rather than on a particular state of
affairs. The question becomes,
then, is the Black race today more
or less intelligent that it was say,
a generation ago? Or, in other
words, is the Black race
overcoming threats to the survival
as well today as it has in the past?
Pessimism
The acute observer of recent
trends cannot help but give a
pessimistic answer to this
question. That this is so can be
readily appreciated when one
accepts the observation that the
main threat to th* 1 survival of the

Black race has been the actions of
the white race against them.
Historically, these
survival-threatening actions by
whites have taken the form of
lynchings, military conscription,
mob and police attacks.
Currently, however, the attacks
are less visible, and for that reason
more difficult to guard against.
Instead of wearing uniforms and
badges, the Government
sponsored oppressive forces now
wear laboratory uniforms and
business suits. They are the
official overseers of "research"
programs in psycho-surgery,
genetic engineering, and a host of
other health-related activities.
Some of them are busy trying to
concoct a bio-chemical formula
which will produce a better breed
of man. They select as their
population of experimental
subjects those people who are
incarcerated in Government run
prisons, stockades, hospitals, and
drug-treatment centers.
Most of these people are, of
course, Black. The official line has
gone out from the National
Institute of Health, the center of
government-defined social
problems: "The Negro is deviant
because he has bad genes or some
chemical imbalance in the brain."
Kerner and Conscience
In order to fully sanction this
official line, the Government has
had to erase from the minds of
the American public the memory
of the Kerner Commission's chief
finding that "white racism is the
major cause of Negro violence." It
accomplished this, with the full
splendor of the ancient myth of a
beheaded messenger of bad news,
by convicting the author of the
Kerner Commission of a variety of
Federal crimes, including mail
fraud, income tax evasion, and
bribery.
Having erased the Kerner
Commission from its conscience,
the Washington regime can now
begin to shift Federal monies
from anti-poverty projects to
those medical and scientific arenas
which reflect "bad gene"
philosophy.
In order to make this shift in
emphases scientifically (as well as
politically) legitimate, the
Government has called upon the
country's Nobel prize winners to
"raise questions" concerning

over-breeding, genetic "diseases,"
and the genetic basis of Black
intelligence.
How Black people will respond
to this latest, and final threat to
the race's survival, will be the acid
test of our intelligence.
