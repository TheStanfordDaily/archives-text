# Institutional Ethics Revisited
## Investment Responsibility: Another View 
### Hal Hemingway 
In this essay I will retell the
events surrounding the
anti-weaponry proposal from the
viewpoint of the Commission on
Investment Responsibility, and I
will suggest several outstanding
issues which are in need of further
clarification if the Stanford
community is to have a full
accounting of the facts.
In October, 1971 I received
notice of my appointment to the
Commission on Investment
Responsibility. At that time I was
informed of the responsibilities
assigned to the Commission.
Among them:
(1) To receive from the
University community proposals
concerning investment
responsibility where attention
appears to be justified under the
stated policy guidelines; and
(2) To advise the vice president
on those issues which are of
sufficient import and broad
general applicability as to warrant
consideration by the Board of
Trustees.
Until May 15, 1972 the first
responsibility was irrelevant to the

Commission because no member
or group of the Stanford
community had shown any
interest in suggesting ways in
which management of the
Stanford portfolio might be made
more socially responsible.
On that day we received from
Professor David Abernethy a
proposal which suggested the
following:
(1) The University should not
knowingly invest new funds in a
company that is a prime
contractor for the production of
anti-personnel weapons.
(2) If University funds are
currently invested in such a
company, the appropriate
University officials should make
every efforl to pursuade company
officials to cancel the relevant
contracts and to state publicly
that no such contracts will be
accepted in the future.
(3) If, after a certain length of
time for example three or four
months it is reasonably clear to
the vice president for business and
finance that the company is not
able or willing to change its
practices and general policies in
the very near future, the
University will commit itself to
dispose of the stock at the earliest
opportunity.
After some discussion the
Commission voted unanimously
to recommend the proposal to
Vice President Robert Augsburger
and then adjourned for the
summer.
At the first meeting of the
reconstituted Commission (five
new members were appointed to
replace old members) in
November we were presented with
a letter from Mr. Augsburger
stating that he did not believe
there was adequate ground for
taking the porposal to the
Trustees for a number of reasons.

Professor Abernethy, we also
discovered, had used the summer
to modify, clarify, and
operational ize his original
proposal in light of criticisms
which had been raised. As a result
of these new developments, Mr.
Augsburger asked us to reassess
the new proposal and to pay
special attention as to whether the
proposal met the Trustees'
Statment on Investment
Responsibility. In order for the
Trustees to take independent
action on the anti-personnel
weaponry proposal the following
Guidelines had to be satisfied:
(1) The undesirable social,
economic, political acts of the
company involved had to be
direct and substantial.
(2) A substantial consensus in
the University community as to
the undesirability of the acts or
effects had to exist.
(3) The economic costs to the
University of taking action had to
be commensurate with the
probable effects of the action.
After considerable discussion
in several meetings the
Commission voted on each of the
three guidelines. The results (with
four members absent) were split.
With respect to the question of
whether the acts were direct and
substantial, three members voted
in the affirmative, two in the
negative. With respect to the
existence of a substantial
consensus two said it did exist,
two said it did not, and one
abstained. With respect to the
economic costs being
commensurate with the probable
effects, three members voted that
the benefits did in fact outweigh
the costs and two members voted
that they did not.
Given the divided opinions
within the Commission on
Investment Responsibility and for

other reasons, Vice President
Augsburger concluded the
anti-personnel weaponry proposal
should not be presented to the
Trustees.
In his articles of Feb. 12 and
13, Mr. Augsburger explained his
thinking and actions. Yet a
number of questions concerning
the grounds for rejection deserve
further explication.
The anti-personnel weaponry
proposal has provided an excellent
test case for delimiting the general
applicability of the Trustees'
Statement on Investment
Responsibility. In order for the
Stanford community (and the
Commission on Investment
Responsibility) to understand
how the Guidelines will (should
be) applied in the future the
following questions should be
answered.
First, what kids of criteria are
to be applied in determining
whether the acts of a company are
direct and substantial ? Does direct
mean that the undesirable acts
have to be performed directly by
personnel employed by the
company, or does it mean that the
company must play a direct role
in supplying the means for the
promulgation of the undesirable
acts, or both? Is substantiality to
be measured in terms of the
effects of the undesirable acts on
the quality of life, or in terms of
the relative size of the corporate
revenues generated by such acts?
By stating that the contracts
accepted by Martin Marietta
Corp., Sperry Rand Corp., and E.
I. duPont de Nemours & Co. are

"legitimately in response to
contracts placed by the Federal
government," is Mr. Augusburger
implying that the criteria for
knowing whether an act is
undesirable >is determined' by the
legality or illegality of the act?
Second, is the assumption to
be that a consensus exists until
proven otherwise, or alternatively
that a consensus does not exist
until the supporters of a particular
proposal demonstrate the
contrary? If the latter, what
means should be employed in
proving that a consensus does
exist? If the measure of a
consensus is to be the degree to
which the proposal is debated in
campus publication, as implied in
Mr. Augsburger's article, who
should promote the debate and at
what step in the consideration
process is such debate
appropriate?
Third, and most critically, if
"the use of Stanford's
stockholdings, but whatever
means, is not likely to have any
effect upon the particular
companies' willingness to provide
goods or services to the Federal
government" isn't it also likely
that the use of Stanford's
stockholdings, by whatever
means, will have no effect on any
corporate action whatever? And,
if that is the case, of what value is
the Statement on Investment
Responsibility (or the
Commission, for that matter)?

implying that the criteria for

legality or illegality of the act?
Second, is the assumption to
be that a consensus exists until
proven otherwise, or alternatively
that a consensus does not exist
until the supporters of a particular
proposal demonstrate the
contrary? If the latter, what

appropriate?
Third, and most critically, if
"the use of Stanford's

effect upon the particular
companies' willingness to provide
goods or services to the Federal

that the use of Stanford's
stockholdings, by whatever
means, will have no effect on any
corporate action whatever? And,
if that is the case, of what value is
the Statement on Investment
Responsibility (or the
Commission, for that matter)?

a member of the Commission on
Investment Responsibility.)
In this essay I will retell the
events surrounding the
anti-weaponry proposal from the
viewpoint of the Commission on
Investment Responsibility, and I
will suggest several outstanding
issues which are in need of further
clarification if the Stanford
community is to have a full
accounting of the facts.
In October, 1971 I received
notice of my appointment to the
Commission on Investment
Responsibility. At that time I was
informed of the responsibilities
assigned to the Commission.
Among them:
(1) To receive from the
University community proposals
concerning investment
responsibility where attention
appears to be justified under the
stated policy guidelines; and
(2) To advise the vice president
on those issues which are of
sufficient import and broad
general applicability as to warrant
consideration by the Board of
Trustees.
Until May 15, 1972 the first
responsibility was irrelevant to the

Commission because no member
or group of the Stanford
community had shown any
interest in suggesting ways in
which management of the
Stanford portfolio might be made
more socially responsible.
On that day we received from
Professor David Abernethy a
proposal which suggested the
following:
(1) The University should not
knowingly invest new funds in a
company that is a prime
contractor for the production of
anti-personnel weapons.
(2) If University funds are
currently invested in such a
company, the appropriate
University officials should make
every efforl to pursuade company
officials to cancel the relevant
contracts and to state publicly
that no such contracts will be
accepted in the future.
(3) If, after a certain length of
time for example three or four
months it is reasonably clear to
the vice president for business and
finance that the company is not
able or willing to change its
practices and general policies in
the very near future, the
University will commit itself to
dispose of the stock at the earliest
opportunity.
After some discussion the
Commission voted unanimously
to recommend the proposal to
Vice President Robert Augsburger
and then adjourned for the
summer.
At the first meeting of the
reconstituted Commission (five
new members were appointed to
replace old members) in
November we were presented with
a letter from Mr. Augsburger
stating that he did not believe
there was adequate ground for
taking the porposal to the
Trustees for a number of reasons.

Professor Abernethy, we also
discovered, had used the summer
to modify, clarify, and
operational ize his original
proposal in light of criticisms
which had been raised. As a result
of these new developments, Mr.
Augsburger asked us to reassess
the new proposal and to pay
special attention as to whether the
proposal met the Trustees'
Statment on Investment
Responsibility. In order for the
Trustees to take independent
action on the anti-personnel
weaponry proposal the following
Guidelines had to be satisfied:
(1) The undesirable social,
economic, political acts of the
company involved had to be
direct and substantial.
(2) A substantial consensus in
the University community as to
the undesirability of the acts or
effects had to exist.
(3) The economic costs to the
University of taking action had to
be commensurate with the
probable effects of the action.
After considerable discussion
in several meetings the
Commission voted on each of the
three guidelines. The results (with
four members absent) were split.
With respect to the question of
whether the acts were direct and
substantial, three members voted
in the affirmative, two in the
negative. With respect to the
existence of a substantial
consensus two said it did exist,
two said it did not, and one
abstained. With respect to the
economic costs being
commensurate with the probable
effects, three members voted that
the benefits did in fact outweigh
the costs and two members voted
that they did not.
Given the divided opinions
within the Commission on
Investment Responsibility and for

other reasons, Vice President
Augsburger concluded the
anti-personnel weaponry proposal
should not be presented to the
Trustees.
In his articles of Feb. 12 and
13, Mr. Augsburger explained his
thinking and actions. Yet a
number of questions concerning
the grounds for rejection deserve
further explication.
The anti-personnel weaponry
proposal has provided an excellent
test case for delimiting the general
applicability of the Trustees'
Statement on Investment
Responsibility. In order for the
Stanford community (and the
Commission on Investment
Responsibility) to understand
how the Guidelines will (should
be) applied in the future the
following questions should be
answered.
First, what kids of criteria are
to be applied in determining
whether the acts of a company are
direct and substantial ? Does direct
mean that the undesirable acts
have to be performed directly by
personnel employed by the
company, or does it mean that the
company must play a direct role
in supplying the means for the
promulgation of the undesirable
acts, or both? Is substantiality to
be measured in terms of the
effects of the undesirable acts on
the quality of life, or in terms of
the relative size of the corporate
revenues generated by such acts?
By stating that the contracts
accepted by Martin Marietta
Corp., Sperry Rand Corp., and E.
I. duPont de Nemours & Co. are

"legitimately in response to
contracts placed by the Federal
government," is Mr. Augusburger
implying that the criteria for

that they did not.
Given the divided opinions
within the Commission on
Investment Responsibility and for

other reasons, Vice President
Augsburger concluded the
anti-personnel weaponry proposal
should not be presented to the
Trustees.
In his articles of Feb. 12 and
13, Mr. Augsburger explained his
thinking and actions. Yet a
number of questions concerning
the grounds for rejection deserve
further explication.
The anti-personnel weaponry
proposal has provided an excellent
test case for delimiting the general
applicability of the Trustees'
Statement on Investment
Responsibility. In order for the
Stanford community (and the
Commission on Investment
Responsibility) to understand
how the Guidelines will (should
be) applied in the future the
following questions should be
answered.
First, what kids of criteria are
to be applied in determining
whether the acts of a company are
direct and substantial ? Does direct
mean that the undesirable acts
have to be performed directly by
personnel employed by the
company, or does it mean that the
company must play a direct role
in supplying the means for the
promulgation of the undesirable
acts, or both? Is substantiality to
be measured in terms of the
effects of the undesirable acts on
the quality of life, or in terms of
the relative size of the corporate
revenues generated by such acts?
By stating that the contracts
accepted by Martin Marietta
Corp., Sperry Rand Corp., and E.
I. duPont de Nemours & Co. are

"legitimately in response to
contracts placed by the Federal
government," is Mr. Augusburger
implying that the criteria for
knowing whether an act is
undesirable >is determined' by the
legality or illegality of the act?
Second, is the assumption to
be that a consensus exists until
proven otherwise, or alternatively
that a consensus does not exist
until the supporters of a particular
proposal demonstrate the
contrary? If the latter, what
means should be employed in
proving that a consensus does
exist? If the measure of a
consensus is to be the degree to
which the proposal is debated in
campus publication, as implied in
Mr. Augsburger's article, who
should promote the debate and at
what step in the consideration
process is such debate
appropriate?
Third, and most critically, if
"the use of Stanford's
stockholdings, but whatever
means, is not likely to have any
effect upon the particular
companies' willingness to provide
goods or services to the Federal
government" isn't it also likely
that the use of Stanford's
stockholdings, by whatever
means, will have no effect on any
corporate action whatever? And,
if that is the case, of what value is
the Statement on Investment
Responsibility (or the
Commission, for that matter)?

a member of the Commission on
Investment Responsibility.)
In this essay I will retell the
events surrounding the
anti-weaponry proposal from the
viewpoint of the Commission on
Investment Responsibility, and I
will suggest several outstanding
issues which are in need of further
clarification if the Stanford
community is to have a full
accounting of the facts.
In October, 1971 I received
notice of my appointment to the
Commission on Investment
Responsibility. At that time I was
informed of the responsibilities
assigned to the Commission.
Among them:
(1) To receive from the
University community proposals
concerning investment
responsibility where attention
appears to be justified under the
stated policy guidelines; and
(2) To advise the vice president
on those issues which are of
sufficient import and broad
general applicability as to warrant
consideration by the Board of
Trustees.
Until May 15, 1972 the first
responsibility was irrelevant to the

Commission because no member
or group of the Stanford
community had shown any
interest in suggesting ways in
which management of the
Stanford portfolio might be made
more socially responsible.
On that day we received from
Professor David Abernethy a
proposal which suggested the
following:
(1) The University should not
knowingly invest new funds in a
company that is a prime
contractor for the production of
anti-personnel weapons.
(2) If University funds are
currently invested in such a
company, the appropriate
University officials should make
every efforl to pursuade company
officials to cancel the relevant
contracts and to state publicly
that no such contracts will be
accepted in the future.
(3) If, after a certain length of
time for example three or four
months it is reasonably clear to
the vice president for business and
finance that the company is not
able or willing to change its
practices and general policies in
the very near future, the
University will commit itself to
dispose of the stock at the earliest
opportunity.
After some discussion the
Commission voted unanimously
to recommend the proposal to
Vice President Robert Augsburger
and then adjourned for the
summer.
At the first meeting of the
reconstituted Commission (five
new members were appointed to
replace old members) in
November we were presented with
a letter from Mr. Augsburger
stating that he did not believe
there was adequate ground for
taking the porposal to the
Trustees for a number of reasons.

Professor Abernethy, we also
discovered, had used the summer
to modify, clarify, and
operational ize his original
proposal in light of criticisms
which had been raised. As a result
of these new developments, Mr.
Augsburger asked us to reassess
the new proposal and to pay
special attention as to whether the
proposal met the Trustees'
Statment on Investment
Responsibility. In order for the
Trustees to take independent
action on the anti-personnel
weaponry proposal the following
Guidelines had to be satisfied:
(1) The undesirable social,
economic, political acts of the
company involved had to be
direct and substantial.
(2) A substantial consensus in
the University community as to
the undesirability of the acts or
effects had to exist.
(3) The economic costs to the
University of taking action had to
be commensurate with the
probable effects of the action.
After considerable discussion
in several meetings the
Commission voted on each of the
three guidelines. The results (with
four members absent) were split.
With respect to the question of
whether the acts were direct and
substantial, three members voted
in the affirmative, two in the
negative. With respect to the
existence of a substantial
consensus two said it did exist,
two said it did not, and one
abstained. With respect to the
economic costs being
commensurate with the probable
effects, three members voted that
the benefits did in fact outweigh
the costs and two members voted
that they did not.
