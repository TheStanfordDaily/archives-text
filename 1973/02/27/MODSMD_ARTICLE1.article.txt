# P.A. City Council Rejects Bach Mai Fund Initiative
## 
### ROBERT BACON 
The Palo Alto City Council last
night voted to keep the controversial
Bach Mai initiative off the May 8
municipal ballot, but sponsors of the
measure promised a quick court test.
Moments after the council voted
6-3 against a resolution putting the
question before the voters, the
initiative's sponsors shouted "See you
in court" to the council, then huddled
in the rear of the chamber with their
attorneys.
The proposed initiative would
donate $50,000 in city funds to help
rebuild the bombed Bach Mai Hospital
in Hanoi, North Vietnam.
'Patently Invalid*
At the opening of the debate last
night, City Attorney Peter Stone told
the council that the measure was
"patently invalid" and "clearly and
without question beyond the power of
the city to accomplish." He
recommended that the measure not be
placed on the ballot.
Eight speakers tried to impress on
the council a contrary viewpoint,
claiming that the measure's legality
should be litigated only after the city's
voters consider the issue.
The lineup on the final vote was
unusual. Favoring submitting the
question to the voters were the most
liberal council member, Enid Pearson,
and the two most conservative
councilmen, John V. Beahrs and John
J. Berwald.
Beahrs and Berwald both made
clear their opposition to the measure,
but said they felt the council ought
not to interfere with the right of
initiative.
Voters' Decision
Pearson did not state her position
on the merits of the issue, saying only
that the voters should be permitted to
decide the question.
Voting to uphold Stone's
recommendation were Mayor Kirke
Comstock, Vice Mayor Stanley
Norton, and council members Sylvia
Seman, Alan Henderson, Richard
Rosenbaum, and William H. Clark.
Rosenbaum called the Bach Mai
proposal "a very fundamental misuse
of the initiative." Seman concurred by
referring to it as "an abuse of the right
of initiative," conceding that the

council was taking an extraordinary
step in keeping an initiative off the
ballot.
'Public Purpose'
Stone told the council that the
Bach Mai donation did not constitute
a "publicpurpose" forwhich tax funds
might be used, and also that an
appropriation can be voted only by
the council, not in an initiative.
The initiative campaign, which
collected about 2600 signatures, was
begun after on Jan. 22 the council
declined to even consider authorizing a
$50,000 donation itself.
As on Jan. 22, the council chamber
was filled last night, with the majority
of the audience apparently supporting
the initiative.
Relevant Law
Several of the members of the
audience who spoke argued that they
read the relevant law differently than
did Stone, and reached the conclusion
that the measure ought to be put
before the voters.
Stanford graduate student John
Philo, who yesterday announced his
candidacy for the council, asked the
council members last night, "What are
you afraid of? Are you afraid we will
win?"

French Prof. Raymond Giraud said
that, by putting the measure on the
ballot, "you can keep alive whatever
shreds, however tattered, of
democracy remain in this city."
Will File Suit
After the meeting Jeffrey
Youdelman of Venceremos, one of the
leaders of the initiative campaign, said
that suit would be filed either
Thursday or Friday in Superior Court
to seek to compel city officials to put
the measure on the ballot.
Youdelman said that the American
Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) would
become involved in the case.
