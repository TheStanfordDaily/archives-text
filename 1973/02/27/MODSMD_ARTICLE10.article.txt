# The 						Bicentennial Conflict
## About The Next War 
### 
2 Stu Beattie

As the Viet Nam skirmish gradually passes from
the consciences of thoughtful Americans, those with
concern for the future and remembrance of the
past will soon be asking themselves:
"What about the next War?" (The "W" in "War"
is capitalized so as not to step on any military toes.)
The "What about" really means "when?" and
"where?" and perhaps to a few isolated individuals
"why?"
Other admirers of the Military-Industrial
Complex (note caps) may wonder how we can
possibly keep our economy at fever pitch unless a
major portion of its production is being regularly
destroyed. Even the well-meaning television news
media will soon become itchy as their ratings
plummet. Knowing that the probability of viewing
severed limbs or bombs in flight is minimal, many
Americans will beging switching their sets in search
of some violent alternative. A Bonnie and Clyde
serial might take up some slack.
Well, back to the hardcore problem which is,
"How can we mobilize enthusiasm for and justify
participation in a War of significant size and
duration?"
Several complications immediately intrude their
ugly heads into our problem.
A good War requires an opponent or opponents
who will fight to the bitter end regardless of
casualties. In this regard the North Vietnamese have
been somewhat disappointing although they were
probably the best available alternative at the time.
Obtaining determined opponents may become an
increasingly difficult requirement as even we come
to perceive that foreigners place a certain value on

their lives.
Another complication is how to regenerate
enthusiasm out of almost total apathy. It can be
persuasively argued, however, that an
Administration which can de-Americanize a War
successfully can easily Americanize a War simply by
reversing the process.
"Where" can be a complication. "Where" is
obviously not "Here." It is probably not in Europe
either because we have become civilized beyond the
point of bombing another Caucasian culture. That
leaves a tired Asia, Africa, and possibly South
America or Mexico, depending upon the success of
our public relations program. All things considered I
would select Africa as perhaps the safest and most
satisfying alternative.
"When" becomes the next question. I would be
extremely surprised if this Administration, in spite
of its obvious talents, could generate the necessary
enthusiasm for American involvement much before
the April 15th tax deadline although April 1st is a
mild possibility. It does seem obvious, however, that
if the administration is to maintain its hold on the
American electorate it must have a major,
interesting War in full swing at least by the 1976
Bi-Centennial. (What better way to celebrate?)
What are the risks to such a celebration? Only
one, I think: that some day all the young men of
the world may stand together and say to their
respected leaders, "Fight your own damn war!"
