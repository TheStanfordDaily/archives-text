# An Ill-Contrived Prescription
## Pros And Cons Of Beutelsbach 
### 
Mark Van Brussel

I applaud Peter Shaffer's
aggressive, if somewhat
unsubstantiated and ill-contrived,
prescription for the
Stanford-in-Germany campus
(Daily, Feb. 22). The arguments
presented in this article provide
for the knowledgeable reader an
insight into the misguided
rationale of the Merryman
Commission in its re-evaluation of
the overseas campus program.
In weighing the pros and cons
of moving the German campus,
three features of Landgut Burg are
consistently focused upon: (1)
The Family program, (2) The
surrounding rural community of
Beutelsbach, and (3) The relative
isolation of the campus. The
assumption of those who are in
favor of moving the campus is
that the rural community and
isolation are negative peculiarities
and that the family program, if it
is so successful, can easily be
continued in another location.
Perhaps the family program
could be renewed in another
area—with much work, patience,
and frustration; but why
experiment with an already

satisfying program as it exists in
Beutelsbach? Mr. Shaffer
"understands that the 'urban'
campus in Vienna offers a very
good urban family program," yet
he fails to understand that the
Vienna campus is slowly dying.
There is no reason to subject
Stanford-in-Germany to the same
possible fate by moving it from its
present sight to a metropolitan
center.
Uniqueness
Many fail to recognize that
Landgut Burg's uniqueness is the
reason for its success.
Stanford-in-Germany has the
strongest and most popular
program, and the rural area of
Beutelsbach and the relative
isolation of the campus are
integral to its success.
The seclusion of the campus
compels the students within each
group to become enculturated
into the community and there is a
unity and cohesiveness within the
group which was visibly lacking in
the more urban oriented campuses
of Vienna and Florence. Close
contact both with fellow students
and with the inhabitants of
Beutelsbach resulted in lasting
relationships.
Over the years Landgut Burg
and the Stanford students have
gained a reputation not only in
Beutelsbach but numerous other
communities as well.
Nothing could be less true than
the accusation that interaction
between the students and
Beutelsbachers is minimal. The
community and the students are
constantly making efforts to meet
and entertain each other.
Kuchen and Buchen
Within a few weeks of our
arrival at the campus, students
were already participating in
gymnastics, swimming, basketball,
and soccer Vereins: singing in the
church choir as well as
participating in the service; baking
Kuchen with their families, taking
saunas at the Schwimmhalle,
going to parties put on by the
German faculty, and even
attending classes at the local
gymnasium with German brothers
and sisters. Many weekend trips
were foregone in order to spend
time with the families and

Beutelsbach quickly became a
true home.
Suppose Stanford was located
in a metropolitan center, like
Munich for instance (um Gott es
willen). True, such a metropolitan
center would contain many
advantages that you can't get in a
rural community like Beutelsbach.
The author of "Move Out of
Beutelsbach" stated that we
should give up the "idyllic
existence" at Landgut Burg and
give students a chance to involve
themselves more fully in all
aspects of a foreign
culture . .. using the term loosely.
Cities like Berlin and Munich
hardly deserve the label "foreign"
when compared to communities
like Beutelsbach. How often has
anyone walked into the
Hofbrauhaus in Munich without
meeting 400 other Americans?
How can anyone truly embrace a
foreign culture when all your
various inquiries of the inhabitants
merely elicit the response, "Speak
English, please." Everyone visiting
Europe is likely to see Paris,
London, Munich, and American

tourists ad nauseam, but few
people will ever have enough time
and foreknowledge to discover
and experience communities like
Beutelsbach.
More Credit
In view of the above
arguments, and despite Mr.
Shaffer's "understanding" of the
situation in Beutelsbach, I would
hesitate to give Stanford students
so little credit by assuming that
they are attracted to Landgut
Burg because of "apple trees,
volleyball, and an aesthetically
pleasing hill."
This letter is the result of
numerous discussions with the
students of past German groups.
It would be impressive, but hardly
feasible, to include the signatures
of all 83 students from Germany
Group XXVIII, or to say that
they concur with my viewpoints
100 percent. But I have not yet
found one past student of
Stanford-in-Germany who thinks
"we can do better" by moving out
of Beutelsbach.

were already participating in
gymnastics, swimming, basketball,
and soccer Vereins: singing in the
church choir as well as
participating in the service; baking
Kuchen with their families, taking
saunas at the Schwimmhalle,
going to parties put on by the
German faculty, and even
attending classes at the local
gymnasium with German brothers
and sisters. Many weekend trips
were foregone in order to spend
time with the families and

Beutelsbach quickly became a
true home.
Suppose Stanford was located
in a metropolitan center, like
Munich for instance (um Gott es
willen). True, such a metropolitan
center would contain many
advantages that you can't get in a
rural community like Beutelsbach.
The author of "Move Out of
Beutelsbach" stated that we
should give up the "idyllic
existence" at Landgut Burg and
give students a chance to involve
themselves more fully in all
aspects of a foreign
culture . .. using the term loosely.
Cities like Berlin and Munich
hardly deserve the label "foreign"
when compared to communities
like Beutelsbach. How often has
anyone walked into the
Hofbrauhaus in Munich without
meeting 400 other Americans?
How can anyone truly embrace a
foreign culture when all your
various inquiries of the inhabitants
merely elicit the response, "Speak
English, please." Everyone visiting
Europe is likely to see Paris,
London, Munich, and American

tourists ad nauseam, but few
people will ever have enough time
and foreknowledge to discover
and experience communities like
Beutelsbach.
More Credit
In view of the above
arguments, and despite Mr.
Shaffer's "understanding" of the
situation in Beutelsbach, I would
hesitate to give Stanford students
so little credit by assuming that
they are attracted to Landgut
Burg because of "apple trees,
volleyball, and an aesthetically
pleasing hill."
This letter is the result of
numerous discussions with the
students of past German groups.
It would be impressive, but hardly
feasible, to include the signatures
of all 83 students from Germany
Group XXVIII, or to say that
they concur with my viewpoints
100 percent. But I have not yet
found one past student of
Stanford-in-Germany who thinks
"we can do better" by moving out
of Beutelsbach.

I applaud Peter Shaffer's
aggressive, if somewhat
unsubstantiated and ill-contrived,
prescription for the
Stanford-in-Germany campus
(Daily, Feb. 22). The arguments
presented in this article provide
for the knowledgeable reader an
insight into the misguided
rationale of the Merryman
Commission in its re-evaluation of
the overseas campus program.
In weighing the pros and cons
of moving the German campus,
three features of Landgut Burg are
consistently focused upon: (1)
The Family program, (2) The
surrounding rural community of
Beutelsbach, and (3) The relative
isolation of the campus. The
assumption of those who are in
favor of moving the campus is
that the rural community and
isolation are negative peculiarities
and that the family program, if it
is so successful, can easily be
continued in another location.
Perhaps the family program
could be renewed in another
area—with much work, patience,
and frustration; but why
experiment with an already

satisfying program as it exists in
Beutelsbach? Mr. Shaffer
"understands that the 'urban'
campus in Vienna offers a very
good urban family program," yet
he fails to understand that the
Vienna campus is slowly dying.
There is no reason to subject
Stanford-in-Germany to the same
possible fate by moving it from its
present sight to a metropolitan
center.
Uniqueness
Many fail to recognize that
Landgut Burg's uniqueness is the
reason for its success.
Stanford-in-Germany has the
strongest and most popular
program, and the rural area of
Beutelsbach and the relative
isolation of the campus are
integral to its success.
The seclusion of the campus
compels the students within each
group to become enculturated
into the community and there is a
unity and cohesiveness within the
group which was visibly lacking in
the more urban oriented campuses
of Vienna and Florence. Close
contact both with fellow students
and with the inhabitants of
Beutelsbach resulted in lasting
relationships.
Over the years Landgut Burg
and the Stanford students have
gained a reputation not only in
Beutelsbach but numerous other
communities as well.
Nothing could be less true than
the accusation that interaction
between the students and
Beutelsbachers is minimal. The
community and the students are
constantly making efforts to meet
and entertain each other.

unsubstantiated and ill-contrived,
prescription for the
Stanford-in-Germany campus
(Daily, Feb. 22). The arguments
presented in this article provide
for the knowledgeable reader an
insight into the misguided
rationale of the Merryman
Commission in its re-evaluation of
the overseas campus program.
In weighing the pros and cons
of moving the German campus,
three features of Landgut Burg are
consistently focused upon: (1)
The Family program, (2) The
surrounding rural community of
Beutelsbach, and (3) The relative
isolation of the campus. The
assumption of those who are in
favor of moving the campus is
that the rural community and
isolation are negative peculiarities
and that the family program, if it
is so successful, can easily be
continued in another location.
Perhaps the family program
could be renewed in another
area—with much work, patience,
and frustration; but why
experiment with an already

satisfying program as it exists in
Beutelsbach? Mr. Shaffer
"understands that the 'urban'
campus in Vienna offers a very
good urban family program," yet
he fails to understand that the
Vienna campus is slowly dying.
There is no reason to subject
Stanford-in-Germany to the same
possible fate by moving it from its
present sight to a metropolitan
center.
Uniqueness
Many fail to recognize that
Landgut Burg's uniqueness is the
reason for its success.
Stanford-in-Germany has the
strongest and most popular
program, and the rural area of
Beutelsbach and the relative
isolation of the campus are
integral to its success.
The seclusion of the campus
compels the students within each
group to become enculturated
into the community and there is a
unity and cohesiveness within the
group which was visibly lacking in
the more urban oriented campuses
of Vienna and Florence. Close
contact both with fellow students
and with the inhabitants of
Beutelsbach resulted in lasting
relationships.
Over the years Landgut Burg
and the Stanford students have
gained a reputation not only in
Beutelsbach but numerous other
communities as well.
Nothing could be less true than
the accusation that interaction
between the students and
Beutelsbachers is minimal. The
community and the students are
constantly making efforts to meet
and entertain each other.
Kuchen and Buchen
Within a few weeks of our
arrival at the campus, students
were already participating in
gymnastics, swimming, basketball,
and soccer Vereins: singing in the
church choir as well as
participating in the service; baking
Kuchen with their families, taking
saunas at the Schwimmhalle,
going to parties put on by the
German faculty, and even
attending classes at the local
gymnasium with German brothers
and sisters. Many weekend trips
were foregone in order to spend
time with the families and

Beutelsbach quickly became a
true home.
Suppose Stanford was located
in a metropolitan center, like
Munich for instance (um Gott es
willen). True, such a metropolitan
center would contain many
advantages that you can't get in a
rural community like Beutelsbach.
The author of "Move Out of
Beutelsbach" stated that we
should give up the "idyllic
existence" at Landgut Burg and
give students a chance to involve
themselves more fully in all
aspects of a foreign
culture . .. using the term loosely.
Cities like Berlin and Munich
hardly deserve the label "foreign"
when compared to communities
like Beutelsbach. How often has
anyone walked into the
Hofbrauhaus in Munich without
meeting 400 other Americans?
How can anyone truly embrace a
foreign culture when all your
various inquiries of the inhabitants
merely elicit the response, "Speak
English, please." Everyone visiting
Europe is likely to see Paris,
London, Munich, and American

tourists ad nauseam, but few
people will ever have enough time
and foreknowledge to discover
and experience communities like
Beutelsbach.
More Credit
In view of the above
arguments, and despite Mr.
Shaffer's "understanding" of the
situation in Beutelsbach, I would
hesitate to give Stanford students
so little credit by assuming that
they are attracted to Landgut
Burg because of "apple trees,
volleyball, and an aesthetically
pleasing hill."
This letter is the result of
numerous discussions with the
students of past German groups.
It would be impressive, but hardly
feasible, to include the signatures
of all 83 students from Germany
Group XXVIII, or to say that
they concur with my viewpoints
100 percent. But I have not yet
found one past student of
Stanford-in-Germany who thinks
"we can do better" by moving out
of Beutelsbach.

English and was president of
Germany Group XXVIII.)
