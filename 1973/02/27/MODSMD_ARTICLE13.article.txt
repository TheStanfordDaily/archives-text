Beutelsbach And Culture
Editor:
In his recent article, "Move out
of Beutelsbach," Mr. Peter Shaffer
expressed the opinion that the
Stanford campus in Beutelsbach
isolates the students from German
society and that more could be
achieved by moving to one of the
large urban cultural centers. But
can we really do better by moving
from Beutelsbach?
Mr. Shaffer mentioned the
many cultural events that a large
city would offer. While it is
certainly true that a city like
Munich would offer more of such
events, how much about being
German can one learn from
listening to a concert? It is only
by being in a German home that
one can really learn German and
experience what German culture
is.
One reason for the success of
the German program is that it is a
rural area; the pace of life is
slower and the Germans have
more time to spend with the
American students. In addition,
the location of the campus on top
of a hill, in the green country side
amongst the apple trees, proves to
be an asset rather than a liability
for the family program. Precisely
because of this location, the
campus is overrun by Germans
every Sunday as families come up
on the hill to go for walks and
enjoy the view.
Finally, Mr. Shaffer's
comparison of Beutelsbach to
Gilroy was simply untrue.
Beutelsbach is not a sleepy little
farming village located at the "end
of the line."
Beutelsbach and the
surrounding areas are the most
densely populated rural areas
anywhere in the world. Presently,
Beutelsbach offers some very
interesting contrasts between the
old and new Germany. There are
poor wine growing families living
in houses that are 450 years old,
living next to people who
commute daily to Stuttgart, live
in new homes and have two cars.
In Beutelsbach one can see how
important the traditional life of
wine growing has been in southern
Germany. But one can also see
two distinct cultures and gain a
good understanding of both. An
urban area simply does not offer
this contrast.
