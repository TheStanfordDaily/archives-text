# Rowf Nadir Speaks
## Our Canine Minority 
### 
: Chris Hocker

For the benefit of you who tire
of seeing my column week after
week, I have decided not to write
this time but, instead, to turn my
space over to a guest columnist.
He is Mr. Rowf Nadir, the noted
consumer advocate, who will
write about the most pressing
problem facing Stanford today.
*****
The overriding concern for
those of us seeking to solve the
problem of dogs at Stanford
University is not whether or not
dogs may be allowed to roam
unleashed, but, rather, what is in
the Public Interest. As is so often
the case, debate over the question
has been centered upon the
specific issue, instead of the
generality that underlies it. This
approach is a mistake we feel
called upon to correct.
What, then, is the Public
Interest? How is it to be defined?
Ignoring the extraneous
i r relevancies of those
questions—we will return to them
some day, maybe—let us consider
the problem at hand, or, if you
will, at foot.
The case has been advanced by
the University establishment and
its allies, through the channels of
the Office of Public Safety and
the Stanford Daily, that dogs,
roaming unchecked throughout
the campus, are a nuisance. It is
said that these creatures—who,
after all, did not ask to be put
here in our midst—eat food
intended for human consumption,
disrupt normal University
business, and leave identifying
substances at odd places.
Dignity and Eats
Such an approach is typical of
corporate attitudes in the United
States today, for it leaves out the
vital question of—you guessed
it—the Public Interest. Our
investigation has uncovered
incontrovertible evidence that
Stanford University has defaulted
on its social responsibility. The
following specific points were
noted:
1. Inadequate eating facilities
were made available for those
unfortunate members of the
Stanford community who are
incapable of holding a paying job
with dignity. Instead, these
societal rejects have been forced
to partake of the spoils left by the
more fortunate, and even, in some

cases, to resort to theft and even
violence in order to sustain what
should be thought of as a basic
right, the right to eat anything
you want, any time you want.
2. Inadequate toilet facilities
have been provided for those of
the canine race, and segregation
according to the hirsuteness of
one's skin is thereby encouraged.
At this time, nothing more
dignified than a flat, hard patch of
concrete is available, and no
running water except that of the
dog involved.
Greed Strikes Again
3. Inadequate educational
facilities exist for those in the
community with special learning
difficulties or language barriers.
Dissatisfaction with Stanford
classes among the canine
population is manifested in
irregular attendance, disinterest,
and occasional anti-social
behavior.
There were other details or
deprivation attributable to
corporate greed which are too
numerous to mention here.
To those who may claim that
there is a distinction between the
rights of dogs and the rights of
humans, we refer you to the

Declaration of Rights for Animate
Objects, written in 1952 at the
famous Mt. Whitney Conference,
and signed by Eleanor Roosevelt
and Leon Trotsky (those of you
who persist in spreading the
vicious myth that Trotsky is dead
are not working in the Public
Interest). In the milestone
document, rights pertaining to
Humans, dogs, guppies, windmills,
perpetual motion machines, and,
yes, even Republicans, were
spelled out in detail.
Aux Barricades
Therefore, our investigations
have shown that a drastic reversal
on the part of Stanford University
away from profits and in the
direction of universal rights must
be undertaken—by force if
necessary. The dogs of this
campus and of the world must be
allowed to live in the dignity
which is their due and which, we
might add, would work in—all
together now—the Public Interest.
No longer may the bastions of
corporate immorality be allowed
to promulgate those policies that
we have determined to be unsafe
at any breed!

Dissatisfaction with Stanford
classes among the canine

there is a distinction between the
rights of dogs and the rights of

Objects, written in 1952 at the

and Leon Trotsky (those of you

vicious myth that Trotsky is dead
are not working in the Public
Interest). In the milestone
document, rights pertaining to
Humans, dogs, guppies, windmills,
perpetual motion machines, and,
yes, even Republicans, were
spelled out in detail.
Aux Barricades
Therefore, our investigations
have shown that a drastic reversal
on the part of Stanford University
away from profits and in the
direction of universal rights must
be undertaken—by force if
necessary. The dogs of this
campus and of the world must be
allowed to live in the dignity
which is their due and which, we
might add, would work in—all
together now—the Public Interest.
No longer may the bastions of
corporate immorality be allowed
to promulgate those policies that
we have determined to be unsafe
at any breed!

For the benefit of you who tire
of seeing my column week after
week, I have decided not to write
this time but, instead, to turn my
space over to a guest columnist.
He is Mr. Rowf Nadir, the noted
consumer advocate, who will
write about the most pressing
problem facing Stanford today.
*****
The overriding concern for
those of us seeking to solve the
problem of dogs at Stanford
University is not whether or not
dogs may be allowed to roam
unleashed, but, rather, what is in
the Public Interest. As is so often
the case, debate over the question
has been centered upon the
specific issue, instead of the
generality that underlies it. This
approach is a mistake we feel
called upon to correct.
What, then, is the Public
Interest? How is it to be defined?
Ignoring the extraneous
i r relevancies of those
questions—we will return to them
some day, maybe—let us consider
the problem at hand, or, if you
will, at foot.
The case has been advanced by
the University establishment and
its allies, through the channels of
the Office of Public Safety and
the Stanford Daily, that dogs,
roaming unchecked throughout
the campus, are a nuisance. It is
said that these creatures—who,
after all, did not ask to be put
here in our midst—eat food
intended for human consumption,
disrupt normal University
business, and leave identifying
substances at odd places.
Dignity and Eats
Such an approach is typical of
corporate attitudes in the United
States today, for it leaves out the
vital question of—you guessed
it—the Public Interest. Our
investigation has uncovered
incontrovertible evidence that
Stanford University has defaulted
on its social responsibility. The
following specific points were
noted:
1. Inadequate eating facilities
were made available for those
unfortunate members of the
Stanford community who are
incapable of holding a paying job
with dignity. Instead, these
societal rejects have been forced
to partake of the spoils left by the
more fortunate, and even, in some

cases, to resort to theft and even
violence in order to sustain what
should be thought of as a basic
right, the right to eat anything
you want, any time you want.
2. Inadequate toilet facilities
have been provided for those of
the canine race, and segregation
according to the hirsuteness of
one's skin is thereby encouraged.
At this time, nothing more
dignified than a flat, hard patch of
concrete is available, and no
running water except that of the
dog involved.
Greed Strikes Again
3. Inadequate educational
facilities exist for those in the
community with special learning
difficulties or language barriers.
Dissatisfaction with Stanford
classes among the canine
population is manifested in
irregular attendance, disinterest,
and occasional anti-social
behavior.
There were other details or
deprivation attributable to
corporate greed which are too
