Is there a place on campus where one can register to vote? M.S.
No, there is not. The closest place for voter registration is the fire
station at 301 Alma Street in Palo Alto. Hours for registration are
from 4-5 p.m. and 6-8 p.m. seven days a week.

How come the Main Library closes at 10 p.m.â€”when the Meyer
Library is utterly inadequate for research? The library people may tell
you that too few people use it between 10 and midnight, but can they
supply the hard figures, and do they have an estimate on how much it
would cost to keep the library open. It seems to me that three or four
low-paid student workers, two hours a night, would hardly kill their
budget. D.D.McM.
The Main Library closes at 10 p.m. because it is too expensive to
keep it open for the number of people that use it after that time.
Last spring surveys were conducted on the third, sixth, and ninth
weeks of the quarter to determine the number of students using the
Main Library after 10 p.m. The average number of students in the
library at 10:30 p.m. was 31 in the first survey, 45 in the second, and
46 in the third.
It would cost $15,342 to have the library open past 10 p.m.,
according to John Heyeck, Financial & Planning Officer for University
Libraries. This amount would provide only minimal service for 33
weeks, or three quarters.

Will the new swimming pool be open to women as well as men?

Donald Tobin, Assistant to the Athletic Director. He also said that
there will be changing facilities for both men and women.
