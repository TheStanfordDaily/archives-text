# Need For Pill Increases
## 
### 
Chemistry Prof. Carl Djerassi called for the
increased use of contraceptives to stem population
growth Thursday night. Speaking before a crowd of
200 in the main Chemistry building, Djerassi
identified the explosive growth of the world's
population as dangerous.
"It is perfectly obvious that people cannot breed
at this rate," he said. Djerassi explained that the
underdeveloped countries' populations were
increasing at a far higher rate than in developing
countries, jeopardizing the standards of living in the
poorer countries.
The chemist identified the two most important
forms of birth control as abortion and
contraceptives. Characterizing abortion as
therapeutic, he said, "abortion is more like a cure
for a disease; contraception is analagous to
preventive medication like a vaccine."
The expert on contraceptives stated that several
promising methods of research were in stages of
development but glumly reported that success of
such a pill was at least 10 years distant.
For this reason, the chemist said "abortions are

here to stay." While most Americans were against
"abortion on demand," Djerassi said that abortions
were used commonly throughout the world and that
in Rumania there were four abortions for every
birth.
Djerassi noted that illegal abortions were very
common in Catholic countries which banned
abortions and that of the 500 million fertile women
in the world, 40 million abortions were committed
each year. The reason for this he stated was that
most people "wait until they get pregnant before
they do something about it."
"As more people become more sophisticated,"
he noted, "the use of contraceptives increases. It is
the people who have little education who are the
ones who are most adamantly against it."
Questioned about a male contraceptive pill,
Djerassi responded, "I think it's pointless." He said
that it was the woman who got pregnantâ€”not the
man, and hence the man has less responsibility to
take the pill. As he put it,"the ultimate
emancipation of a woman is when she is in control
of her fertility."
