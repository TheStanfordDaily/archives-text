# P.A. City Council Candidates Named
## 
### ROBERT BACON 
A Stanford faculty member
and student are among those
named to slates of candidates for
the May 8 Palo Alto City Council
election.
Law Prof. Byron D. Sher, a
councilman from 1965 to 1967,
was endorsed Sunday by the
liberal Association for a Balanced
Community (ABC).
John Philo, a doctoral student
in physics and a member of the
Trustee Committee on Land and
Buildings, was named yesterday to

the radical Palo Alto Community
Coalition ticket.
Filing for five four-year terms
and one two-year seat closes at
noon Thursday. As of yesterday
noon, 16 candidates had taken
out nomination papers, although
only one had formally filed by
returning his papers.
In addition to Philo, PACC
named Jeffrey Youdelman of
Venceremos, Carol Peterson of
Child Care Now, and Douglas
Mattern of the Palo Alto Peace
Union.

Philo, an active member of the
Palo Alto Tenants Union and a
persistent critic of University land
development policy, said
yesterday that if elected he "will
seek ways to force Stanford to use
its lands for housing."
In addition to Sher, ABC
endorsements, made by mail
ballot of the association's 900
members, went to Mayor Kirke
Comstock; Councilwoman Sylvia
Seman; Dr. Allen Seid, a
psychiatrist active in the city's
drug abuse program; Emily

Renzel, a staff member at
Stanford Research Institute and
veteran conservationist; and
Thomas O. Passell, a scientist
employed in Lockheed's Palo Alto
research laboratory.
Recalled
Sher, one of four liberal
"residentialist" council members
removed from office in the
stormy May 1967 recall election,
has served as Chairman of the
University Human Relations
Commission, and was a member
of grievance committees which
investigated the firing of five
University employees following
the April 1971 Stanford Hospital
sit-in.
A third slate of council
candidates, announced two weeks
ago, represents "Palo Alto '73,"
successor to the conservative
"establishment" groups of the
past decade.
That slate includes Vice Mayor
Stanley Norton, Councilmen John
V. Beahrs and John J. Berwald,
architect Elvia Garwood, and Roy
Clay, operator of an executive
placement firm.
Independents
Several independent
candidates, not affiliated with any
slate, are expected to file. The
only candidate who has formally

filed to date, John D. Snow, long
active in veterans' organizations, is
an independent.
Most candidates have not yet
chosen whether to seek the
two-year term or one of the
four-year terms. They must make
that decision by noon Thursday.
The five four-year seats will be
voted on at large, but the
two-year position will be filled in
a separate contest. Seman, who
was appointed to fill a vacancy, is
the incumbent for the two-year
post, but has not yet stated
whether she will seek it or a full
term.

veteran conservationist; and
Thomas O. Passell, a scientist
employed in Lockheed's Palo Alto
research laboratory.
Recalled
Sher, one of four liberal
"residentialist" council members
removed from office in the
stormy May 1967 recall election,
has served as Chairman of the
University Human Relations
Commission, and was a member
of grievance committees which
investigated the firing of five
University employees following
the April 1971 Stanford Hospital
sit-in.
A third slate of council
candidates, announced two weeks
ago, represents "Palo Alto '73,"
successor to the conservative
"establishment" groups of the
past decade.
That slate includes Vice Mayor
Stanley Norton, Councilmen John
V. Beahrs and John J. Berwald,
architect Elvia Garwood, and Roy
Clay, operator of an executive
placement firm.
Independents
Several independent
candidates, not affiliated with any
slate, are expected to file. The
only candidate who has formally

filed to date, John D. Snow, long
active in veterans' organizations, is
an independent.
Most candidates have not yet
chosen whether to seek the
two-year term or one of the
four-year terms. They must make
that decision by noon Thursday.
The five four-year seats will be
voted on at large, but the
two-year position will be filled in
a separate contest. Seman, who
was appointed to fill a vacancy, is
the incumbent for the two-year
post, but has not yet stated
whether she will seek it or a full
term.
A Stanford faculty member
and student are among those
named to slates of candidates for
the May 8 Palo Alto City Council
election.
Law Prof. Byron D. Sher, a
councilman from 1965 to 1967,
was endorsed Sunday by the
liberal Association for a Balanced
Community (ABC).
John Philo, a doctoral student
in physics and a member of the
Trustee Committee on Land and
Buildings, was named yesterday to

the radical Palo Alto Community
Coalition ticket.
Filing for five four-year terms
and one two-year seat closes at
noon Thursday. As of yesterday
noon, 16 candidates had taken
out nomination papers, although
only one had formally filed by
returning his papers.
In addition to Philo, PACC
named Jeffrey Youdelman of
Venceremos, Carol Peterson of
Child Care Now, and Douglas
Mattern of the Palo Alto Peace
Union.

Philo, an active member of the
Palo Alto Tenants Union and a
persistent critic of University land
development policy, said
yesterday that if elected he "will
seek ways to force Stanford to use
its lands for housing."
In addition to Sher, ABC
endorsements, made by mail
ballot of the association's 900
members, went to Mayor Kirke
Comstock; Councilwoman Sylvia
Seman; Dr. Allen Seid, a
psychiatrist active in the city's
drug abuse program; Emily

Renzel, a staff member at
Stanford Research Institute and
veteran conservationist; and
Thomas O. Passell, a scientist
employed in Lockheed's Palo Alto
research laboratory.
