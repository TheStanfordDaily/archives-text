### C.C. MINICLIER News Analysis 
CAIRO (AP) — As Egypt moved
on several fronts toward peace last
week, Israel attacked a Lebanese
refugee camp 112 miles from her
border and downed a commercial
airliner, killing 106 persons from
eight countries.
The combination of events
shattered Israel's carefully

developed stance as the
peace-loving little country amid
hostile enemies, as world public
opinion condemned thfe attacks
shortly before premier Golda Meir
goes to Washington in quest of
new American arms.
"Israel proved to the whole
world that it does not want
peace," an Egyptian newspaper
said Sunday.
The Soviet press said earlier
that the plane incident was
designed to hinder efforts toward
a peace settlement.

The downing of the plane over
Egyptian Sinai—occupied by
Israeli troops in total disregard of
repeated U.N. resolutions since
1967—raises the question of the
Israeli occupation once more, A 1
Ahram said Sunday.
Egyptians have contended that
it is Israel which benefits from the
continued state of no war, no
peace, being able to unite an
otherwise multifaced nation.
