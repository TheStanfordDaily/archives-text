# Criticizes Sex Education
## Psychoanalyst Discusses Sex 
### JANET SANDERS 
"A child should learn about sex
when he is ready and not when the
teacher has it on his schedule," said
Dr. Ernest van den Haag to an
audience of 300 in his speech last
night on "Sex, Love and Utopia" at
Memorial Auditorium.
Van den Haag, an adjunct professor
of social philosophy at New York
University and a practicing
psychoanalyst, also contended that
emotional attitudes toward sex cannot
be formed in school. "Emotional
misconditioning cannot be cured by
giving the person the right
information," he said.
"The problem is not
misinformation or lack of information
about sex but the individual's failure
to utilize available knowledge," van
den Haag said. Thus, he explained,

girls get pregnant, not because of their
ignorance of contraceptives, but
because "they have not been willing to
face the fact that they need them."
Technological Cure
Van den Haag labelled the trend
toward sexual education as our
society's tendency to deal with social
and emotional problems by
technological means. "What is
important is not technical competence
but emotional attitudes which cannot
be formed in school," he said.
"Sex manuals are written by
physicians as if sex is some form of
disease," van den Haag said. "And the
few parts of us which have been
private are made public by sex
education."
"I see no reason at all for replacing
the apprenticeship system of sexual
education," said van den Haag.

claiming that it has worked
sufficiently in the past. "Those things
which cannot be learned by practice
should be taught in school, and sex is
not one of them," he added.
No Evidence
Van den Haag also pointed out that
there is no evidence that teachers
know about sex better than anyone
else. "It is not reasonable to compel
parents to send children to school
where sexual views are taught that
they do not agree with."
"There is no scientific evidence for
any sexual attitude being right or
wrong," van den Haag said. "Thus,
there is no right scientific idea about
sex which teachers can promulgate to
children."
The professor agreed that there is a
need for more information about sex
among low-income groups, but he did
not believe that Stanford students
needed sexual education.
"The sexual problems of Stanford
students are psychological and not due
to lack of information," van den Haag
said. He called University courses such
as Human Sexuality "a waste of time."
Social Benefits
By his research, van den Haag has
concluded that the social benefits
attributed to sexual education, such as
reduction in venereal disease,
unwanted pregnancy and sexual
deviation, are unsupported. "There is
not one scintilla of evidence that sex
education has any effect," he said.
Van den Haag could only see one
good effect of sex education.
"Since schools have a great ability
to make any subject dull and
unattractive, it is possible that sex
education will lessen people's interest
in sex and solve the population
explosion," he said jokingly.
A panel composed of Dr. Harvey
Caplan, sex educator and therapist
with Planned Parenthood; Dr. Donald
Lunde of the Department of
Psychiatry; and Mrs. Pat Miller,
President of Family Planning
Alternative, questioned the professor's
controversial views.
Van den Haag's speech is the first in
a series of lectures railed "The
Conservative Persuasion" sponsored by
the Stanford Conservative Komm.

'SEX, LOVE, AND UTOPIA' — Psychoanalyst and adjunct professor of social
philosophy at New York University Ernest van den Haag stated that emotional
attitudes toward sex cannot be formed in school. Van den Haag criticized
University courses such as Human Sexuality as "a waste of time."
"A child should learn about sex
when he is ready and not when the
teacher has it on his schedule," said
Dr. Ernest van den Haag to an
audience of 300 in his speech last
night on "Sex, Love and Utopia" at
Memorial Auditorium.
Van den Haag, an adjunct professor
of social philosophy at New York
University and a practicing
psychoanalyst, also contended that
emotional attitudes toward sex cannot
be formed in school. "Emotional
misconditioning cannot be cured by
giving the person the right
information," he said.
"The problem is not
misinformation or lack of information
about sex but the individual's failure
to utilize available knowledge," van
den Haag said. Thus, he explained,

girls get pregnant, not because of their
ignorance of contraceptives, but
because "they have not been willing to
face the fact that they need them."
Technological Cure
Van den Haag labelled the trend
toward sexual education as our
society's tendency to deal with social
and emotional problems by
technological means. "What is
important is not technical competence
but emotional attitudes which cannot
be formed in school," he said.
"Sex manuals are written by
physicians as if sex is some form of
disease," van den Haag said. "And the
few parts of us which have been
private are made public by sex
education."
"I see no reason at all for replacing
the apprenticeship system of sexual
education," said van den Haag.

claiming that it has worked
sufficiently in the past. "Those things
which cannot be learned by practice
should be taught in school, and sex is
not one of them," he added.
No Evidence
Van den Haag also pointed out that
there is no evidence that teachers
know about sex better than anyone
else. "It is not reasonable to compel
parents to send children to school
where sexual views are taught that
they do not agree with."
"There is no scientific evidence for
any sexual attitude being right or
wrong," van den Haag said. "Thus,
there is no right scientific idea about
sex which teachers can promulgate to
children."
The professor agreed that there is a
need for more information about sex
among low-income groups, but he did
not believe that Stanford students
needed sexual education.
"The sexual problems of Stanford
students are psychological and not due
to lack of information," van den Haag
said. He called University courses such
as Human Sexuality "a waste of time."
Social Benefits
By his research, van den Haag has
concluded that the social benefits
attributed to sexual education, such as
reduction in venereal disease,
unwanted pregnancy and sexual
deviation, are unsupported. "There is
not one scintilla of evidence that sex
education has any effect," he said.
Van den Haag could only see one
good effect of sex education.
"Since schools have a great ability
to make any subject dull and
unattractive, it is possible that sex
education will lessen people's interest
in sex and solve the population
explosion," he said jokingly.
