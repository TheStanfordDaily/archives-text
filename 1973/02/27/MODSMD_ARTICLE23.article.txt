# Impressive 'Buck White' Probes Relevant Issues
## 
### DANIEL BRENNER 
At a time when, as Julian Bond
has said, being black is no longer
chic, the Drama Department's
"Big Time Buck White" on the
Nitery stage successfully accords a
meaningful and fresh forum to the
issues dividing Black and White
America.
This play is about tension
between the confines of theater
and the desire for an engage
spectator; tension over the
changing self-image of the black
man; and tension between the
view of "Big Time's" message for
the white spectator and for the
black spectator. What is
understood by the individual in
the dramatic environment the
play places him in depends, in my
opinion, on notions about race
matters held before penetrating
the theater entrance of glass
beads.
A self-help poverty program in
Watts has staged a dance the night
before. Five paid program
coordinators, led by Jive
(Reginald Turner), who arrives
last, enter the program
meetinghall on ramps in about
seven-minute intervals and discuss
Jive's control. A power struggle
weaves throughout the first half as
Jive's underlings toy with the
notion of taking over his job.
Weasel, convincingly and
enthusiastically played by
Jonathan Ray Ivy, represents the
unreconstructed black man who
views the program as another
scheme to make a fast buck. He
offers the Superflyish Rubber
Band (Cedric Thomas), dashikied
Hunter (Larry La Mont Terry),
and Jive's black Barney Fife,
Honey Man (Billy Walker) money
for their votes. Weasel could have
been played as an ice-cool
manipulator, but wasn't, and
therefore brings a psychologically
disturbing touch to the role.
Gut Issues
The action swings between

near-violent name-calling among
the coordinators—during which
nearly every obscenity ever
cooked up about blacks by
Whitey is uttered—and gimme-five
reconciliations. The dramatic
interest is held during these
human taffy-pulls because some
very gut issues are dealt with,
issues which whites scarcely
understand, let alone feel right
about asking. The vanity of
Hunter ("Don't touch my
dashiki... It's my thing"), the
kid gloves of Honey Man, the
unattributable anger of Rubber
Band—these represent the
touchiest imperfections of the
emerging black identity, from a
white person's viewpoint.
But because "Big Time Buck
White" was written by a Watts
playwright, Joseph Tuotti (as part
of the community artists's
program started by author Budd
Schulberg in the aftermath of the
Watts riots), these kinds of
problems—human and not only
black problems—are dealt with
and dealt with from an insider's
perspective.
Thus when Hunter reminds his
feuding brothers that "We're
s'pposed to be t'gether, man," the
white spectator understands it as
less an expression of pat black
power unity and more an
injunction to halt self-destruction
lest it uproot an already tenuous
base of cooperation.
Halfway through the play, Big
Time Buck White (Reggie Ishman)
enters, dressed in a flowing white
robe. Reminiscent in speech of
Rev. Ike, Ishman is powerful on
stage—his voice nearly sings during
his black power speech, which is
being recorded on a tape recorder.
Just as Rev. Ike preaches the
gospel of the joys of money, Big
Time venerates black power,
drawing upon the slavery of his
ancestors. The tape recorder, the
sweeping generalities, and a photo
of Big Time and the coordinators

"for Washington," appear to be
intentional parody of Big Time's
message.
Serious Message
But if the mode of
presentation is spoof, the message
is not. For Big Time wants to
"buck white," to establish his
identity independent of Whitey.
Big Time's address, "What's What
With Watts," manifests a tension
between the often ridiculous and
unsuccessful efforts to aid the
ghetto and the rising expectations
of blacks.
When Big Time invites
questions from the spectators,
theatrical tension arises. For in
providing for an engaged
audience, the illusory conventions
that define theater are suspended.
The propriety of such a
suspension of irreality was
established by Giraudoux in
"Electre" over 35 years ago; yet
the effect is still arresting,
particularly when the white
spectator is faced with a stage full
of militant blacks.
At Saturday night's
performance, some of the
questions were undramatic, and so
the participation technique
hampered the tension level. Also,
there was much ad libbing by
other players, adding a touch of
low-brow comedy to what was
rather serious dialogue.
Nevertheless, by the time
Big-Time answered the que-line
question and the scripted part of
the play resumed, a more intimate
relationship between spectators
and actors had been established,
and some very meaningful debate
had taken place.
Some Technical Faults
A few technical matters marred
this spirited production. The
"tape recorder" looked very much
like a photograph from my seat.
And the references to both Watts
and Stanford, did little to create
credibility of the players as real
people. Either the play is taking

place in Watts or Stanford—at
least during the scripted portions.
John Cochran's direction took
full advantage of a most ingenious
set, although the raised-fist stance
by the coordinators on the four
ramps seemed too stiff.
Particularly impressive were the
players' close-up stares of the
spectators. The opening scene
could have used the steam that
was pouring out by the middle of
the play, however.
"Big Time Buck White" packs
a psychological wallop that keeps
spectators entertained—and some
of them, frightened—during the
scripted portions. The
participation portion can drag (it
did a little Saturday night), but or
balance it works. This is
impressive, relevant theater which
crosses the wires of an
increasingly separatist society.

view of "Big Time's" message for
the white spectator and for the
black spectator. What is
understood by the individual in
the dramatic environment the
play places him in depends, in my
opinion, on notions about race
matters held before penetrating
the theater entrance of glass
beads.
A self-help poverty program in
Watts has staged a dance the night
before. Five paid program
coordinators, led by Jive
(Reginald Turner), who arrives
last, enter the program
meetinghall on ramps in about
seven-minute intervals and discuss
Jive's control. A power struggle
weaves throughout the first half as
Jive's underlings toy with the
notion of taking over his job.
Weasel, convincingly and
enthusiastically played by
Jonathan Ray Ivy, represents the
unreconstructed black man who
views the program as another
scheme to make a fast buck. He
offers the Superflyish Rubber
Band (Cedric Thomas), dashikied
Hunter (Larry La Mont Terry),
and Jive's black Barney Fife,
Honey Man (Billy Walker) money
for their votes. Weasel could have
been played as an ice-cool
manipulator, but wasn't, and
therefore brings a psychologically
disturbing touch to the role.
Gut Issues
The action swings between

near-violent name-calling among
the coordinators—during which
nearly every obscenity ever
cooked up about blacks by
Whitey is uttered—and gimme-five
reconciliations. The dramatic
interest is held during these
human taffy-pulls because some
very gut issues are dealt with,
issues which whites scarcely
understand, let alone feel right
about asking. The vanity of
Hunter ("Don't touch my
dashiki... It's my thing"), the
kid gloves of Honey Man, the
unattributable anger of Rubber
Band—these represent the
touchiest imperfections of the
emerging black identity, from a
white person's viewpoint.
But because "Big Time Buck
White" was written by a Watts
playwright, Joseph Tuotti (as part
of the community artists's
program started by author Budd
Schulberg in the aftermath of the
Watts riots), these kinds of
problems—human and not only
black problems—are dealt with
and dealt with from an insider's
perspective.
Thus when Hunter reminds his
feuding brothers that "We're
s'pposed to be t'gether, man," the
white spectator understands it as
less an expression of pat black
power unity and more an
injunction to halt self-destruction
lest it uproot an already tenuous
base of cooperation.
Halfway through the play, Big
Time Buck White (Reggie Ishman)
enters, dressed in a flowing white
robe. Reminiscent in speech of
Rev. Ike, Ishman is powerful on
stage—his voice nearly sings during
his black power speech, which is
being recorded on a tape recorder.
Just as Rev. Ike preaches the
gospel of the joys of money, Big
Time venerates black power,
drawing upon the slavery of his
ancestors. The tape recorder, the
sweeping generalities, and a photo
of Big Time and the coordinators

"for Washington," appear to be
intentional parody of Big Time's
message.
Serious Message
But if the mode of
presentation is spoof, the message
is not. For Big Time wants to
"buck white," to establish his
identity independent of Whitey.
Big Time's address, "What's What
With Watts," manifests a tension
between the often ridiculous and
unsuccessful efforts to aid the
ghetto and the rising expectations
of blacks.
When Big Time invites
questions from the spectators,
theatrical tension arises. For in
providing for an engaged
audience, the illusory conventions
that define theater are suspended.
The propriety of such a
suspension of irreality was
established by Giraudoux in
"Electre" over 35 years ago; yet
the effect is still arresting,
particularly when the white
spectator is faced with a stage full
of militant blacks.
At Saturday night's
performance, some of the
questions were undramatic, and so
the participation technique
hampered the tension level. Also,
there was much ad libbing by
other players, adding a touch of
low-brow comedy to what was
rather serious dialogue.
Nevertheless, by the time
Big-Time answered the que-line
question and the scripted part of
the play resumed, a more intimate
relationship between spectators
and actors had been established,
and some very meaningful debate
had taken place.
Some Technical Faults
A few technical matters marred
this spirited production. The
"tape recorder" looked very much
like a photograph from my seat.
And the references to both Watts
and Stanford, did little to create
credibility of the players as real
people. Either the play is taking

place in Watts or Stanford—at
least during the scripted portions.
John Cochran's direction took
full advantage of a most ingenious
set, although the raised-fist stance
by the coordinators on the four
ramps seemed too stiff.
Particularly impressive were the
players' close-up stares of the
spectators. The opening scene
could have used the steam that
was pouring out by the middle of
the play, however.
"Big Time Buck White" packs
a psychological wallop that keeps
spectators entertained—and some
of them, frightened—during the
scripted portions. The
participation portion can drag (it
did a little Saturday night), but or
balance it works. This is
impressive, relevant theater which
crosses the wires of an
increasingly separatist society.

last, enter the program
meetinghall on ramps in about
seven-minute intervals and discuss
Jive's control. A power struggle
weaves throughout the first half as
Jive's underlings toy with the
notion of taking over his job.
Weasel, convincingly and
enthusiastically played by
Jonathan Ray Ivy, represents the
unreconstructed black man who
views the program as another
scheme to make a fast buck. He
offers the Superflyish Rubber
Band (Cedric Thomas), dashikied
Hunter (Larry La Mont Terry),
and Jive's black Barney Fife,
Honey Man (Billy Walker) money
for their votes. Weasel could have
been played as an ice-cool
manipulator, but wasn't, and
therefore brings a psychologically
disturbing touch to the role.
Gut Issues
The action swings between

near-violent name-calling among
the coordinators—during which
nearly every obscenity ever
cooked up about blacks by
Whitey is uttered—and gimme-five
reconciliations. The dramatic
interest is held during these
human taffy-pulls because some
very gut issues are dealt with,
issues which whites scarcely
understand, let alone feel right
about asking. The vanity of
Hunter ("Don't touch my
dashiki... It's my thing"), the
kid gloves of Honey Man, the
unattributable anger of Rubber
Band—these represent the
touchiest imperfections of the
emerging black identity, from a
white person's viewpoint.
But because "Big Time Buck
White" was written by a Watts
playwright, Joseph Tuotti (as part
of the community artists's
program started by author Budd
Schulberg in the aftermath of the
Watts riots), these kinds of
problems—human and not only
black problems—are dealt with
and dealt with from an insider's
perspective.
Thus when Hunter reminds his
feuding brothers that "We're
s'pposed to be t'gether, man," the
white spectator understands it as
less an expression of pat black
power unity and more an
injunction to halt self-destruction
lest it uproot an already tenuous
base of cooperation.
Halfway through the play, Big
Time Buck White (Reggie Ishman)
enters, dressed in a flowing white
robe. Reminiscent in speech of
Rev. Ike, Ishman is powerful on
stage—his voice nearly sings during
his black power speech, which is
being recorded on a tape recorder.
Just as Rev. Ike preaches the
gospel of the joys of money, Big
Time venerates black power,
drawing upon the slavery of his
ancestors. The tape recorder, the
sweeping generalities, and a photo
of Big Time and the coordinators

"for Washington," appear to be
intentional parody of Big Time's
message.
Serious Message
But if the mode of
presentation is spoof, the message
is not. For Big Time wants to
"buck white," to establish his
identity independent of Whitey.
Big Time's address, "What's What
With Watts," manifests a tension
between the often ridiculous and
unsuccessful efforts to aid the
ghetto and the rising expectations
of blacks.
When Big Time invites
questions from the spectators,
theatrical tension arises. For in
providing for an engaged
audience, the illusory conventions
that define theater are suspended.
The propriety of such a
suspension of irreality was
established by Giraudoux in
"Electre" over 35 years ago; yet
the effect is still arresting,
particularly when the white
spectator is faced with a stage full
of militant blacks.
At Saturday night's
performance, some of the
questions were undramatic, and so
the participation technique
hampered the tension level. Also,
there was much ad libbing by
other players, adding a touch of
low-brow comedy to what was
rather serious dialogue.
Nevertheless, by the time
Big-Time answered the que-line
question and the scripted part of
the play resumed, a more intimate
relationship between spectators
and actors had been established,
and some very meaningful debate
had taken place.
Some Technical Faults
A few technical matters marred
this spirited production. The
"tape recorder" looked very much
like a photograph from my seat.
And the references to both Watts
and Stanford, did little to create
credibility of the players as real
people. Either the play is taking

place in Watts or Stanford—at
least during the scripted portions.
John Cochran's direction took
full advantage of a most ingenious
set, although the raised-fist stance
by the coordinators on the four
ramps seemed too stiff.
Particularly impressive were the
players' close-up stares of the
spectators. The opening scene
could have used the steam that
was pouring out by the middle of
the play, however.
"Big Time Buck White" packs
a psychological wallop that keeps
spectators entertained—and some
of them, frightened—during the
scripted portions. The
participation portion can drag (it
did a little Saturday night), but or
balance it works. This is
impressive, relevant theater which
crosses the wires of an
increasingly separatist society.

CONFRONTATION — Larry Lamont as The Hunter (left), Billy Walker as Honey Man and Jonathan Ray
Ivy as Weasel (right) fight it out in the Drama Department's production of "Big Time Buck White" now
playing at the Nitery. For a review of the play, see Dan Brenner's article on this page.
At a time when, as Julian Bond
has said, being black is no longer
chic, the Drama Department's
"Big Time Buck White" on the
Nitery stage successfully accords a
meaningful and fresh forum to the
issues dividing Black and White
America.
This play is about tension
between the confines of theater
and the desire for an engage
spectator; tension over the
changing self-image of the black
man; and tension between the
view of "Big Time's" message for
the white spectator and for the
black spectator. What is
understood by the individual in
the dramatic environment the
play places him in depends, in my
opinion, on notions about race
matters held before penetrating
the theater entrance of glass
beads.
A self-help poverty program in
Watts has staged a dance the night
before. Five paid program
coordinators, led by Jive
(Reginald Turner), who arrives
last, enter the program
meetinghall on ramps in about
seven-minute intervals and discuss
Jive's control. A power struggle
weaves throughout the first half as
Jive's underlings toy with the
notion of taking over his job.
Weasel, convincingly and

unreconstructed black man who
