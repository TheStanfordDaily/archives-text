# 'P.D.Q. Bach' Proves Disastrous
## 
### DOUG SMITH 
Professor Peter Schickele,
director of the motley Semi-Pro
Musica Antiqua and the world's
acknowledged expert on the
music of P.D.Q. Bach, gave a
disastrous lecture-recital at
Memorial Auditorium last Friday.
The portly, bearded professor
appears to have not a trace of
respect for the hallowed traditions
and conventions either of
academe or of classical music
performance, two fields in which
he moves with equal ineptness.
His late entrance was
characteristic of the entire
undignified evening. The stage
manager searched all over the
stage for him, then finally
explained to the bewildered
audience that Schickele had gone
for dinner at Tresidder and was
apparently taken ill.
Finally, with a boisterous
banging on a balcony exit door,
the professor burst into the
auditorium, sprang over the
balcony rail, slid down a pipe,
galloped twenty-five yards and
catapulted head first onto the
stage. !
After dusting himself off,
Schickele began with a brief,
general lecture on the last and
least of J.S. Bach's children. He
seemed utterly unperturbed by
the fact that the audience laughed
continuously and contemptuously
at his scholarly discoveries.
Appalling First Impression
If his initial impression was
appalling, it became even more so
when he performed on the
keyboard. He left the stage
briefly, marched out again
pompously, bowed, and then
shaded his eyes and peered out
into the audience, presumably
searching for miniskirts in the
front row. His piano technique is
competent, but his musical
interpretations lack coherence and
his bare legs were showing above
his socks. Schickele will never
make it as a serious pianist.
The little-known "Notebook
for Betty-Sue Bach" is justifiably
obscure. The movement "oh!

courante" features a spun-out
baroque line in the right hand
with a boogie bass in the left. A
Japanese equivalent of the
corrente is the "corrate," in which
Schickele repeatedly shouted
"Hai!" and other garbled phrases,
delivered several chops to the
keyboard and finished with a kick
to the piano's ivory teeth.
During further lecturing he
attempted to endear himself to
the audience with the worst
possible puns. He referred to the
way of dating P.D.Q. Bach's
manuscripts by analysis of the
beer stein marks on them (they
were composed in taverns) as the
"stein way." And he revealed that
P.D.Q. Bach had drunk from
Beethoven's fifth in Bonn. When
the audience protested with
hissing, he declared defiantly: "I
want to assure you right now that
I can take a lot more of this than
you can."
Poor Intonation
Schickele's performance of the
infamous "Erotica Variations" for
banned instruments and piano
(Schickele Number 36EE) was no
better than the "Notebook." He
produced a tone from the
windbreaker, a large Pan pipe,
rather like the sound of wind
breaking; his intonation on the
slide whistle was poor; and he
used a fake plastic lasso instead of
a genuine 18th-century lasso
d'amore to whirl above his head in
the fourth variation.
In the "Toot Suite in C
Minor," the professor performed
on an ornate baroque steam
calliope together with his
accomplice, David Oei. The first
piece, "preloud," sounded
suspiciously like the first little
Prelude of J.S. Bach disguised
with a high tonic pedal point and
a periodic toot on a small steam
whistle. P.D.Q. : , that scurvy
plagiarist, attempted to further
mask his theft by moving to B
major with a thud at the end of
the piece, but no lovers of good
music were fooled.
The "O.K. chorale" and "fuga
vulgaria" from the same suite

featured more plagiarisms. The
familiar auf" organ
chorale sounded against "Swing
Low, Sweet Chariot," and the
fugue theme was borrowed from
the "Volga Boatman."
P.D.Q. Bach's patent medicine
show gave some welcome relief.
Bargain counter tenor John
Ferrante has mastered young
Bach's heretical style so well that
his chromatic evocation of the
lines "Do you suffer?" was as
painful as the keyboard pieces.
But it was worth this torture to
see Ferrante's transfigured
countenance when he lit up a
P.D.Q. brand cigarette.
Further evidence of the
abysmally low level of Schickele's
competence was his decision to
present one of the prime examples
of man's inhumanity to man, a
slide show. He showed color slides
of a barn (the University of
Southern North Dakota at
Hoople), of P.D.Q. Bach's
adopted city Wein am Rhein, and
of some relatives of the least
talented Bach (including J.S.'s
second son, Zwei Bach).
The dirtiest, most low-down
point of the evening was reached
with P.D.Q's "Hansel and Gretel
and Ted and Alice," an opera in
one unnatural act. The plethora of
characters, subplots and role
changes amounted to a story
almost as ridiculous as those in
Milton Cross' "Stories of the
Great Operas."
These three hoodlums
apparently take great music no
more seriously than the Marx
Brothers did. The musical drivel
they have dredged up is nothing
more than a cheap thrill. When
responsible persons in the classical
music community find out about
Schickele, they will certainly
unite to hound him out of
musicology and banish him
from the concert hall forever.
