# 'Albert Herring' Combines Fine Music, Skillful Song
## 
### PETER PESIC 
In producing Benjamin
Britten's Comic opera "Albert
Herring," the Stanford Opera
Theater has chosen a very
demanding undertaking. The
individual vocal roles are difficult
to sing, the orchestral part is
virtuosic, but even harder is
combining all these components
in the complicated ensembles. So
the fact that such an excellent and
hilariously funny production has
resulted is especially
praiseworthy. It is also good that
a fine modern opera, infrequently
heard, here receives performance.
The story, taken by Eric
Crozier from a story of de
Maupassant, seems easily told.
The potentates of a little Suffolk
town in 1900, led by the
imperious Lady Billows are
alarmed by the clear signs of
moral decay in the town's young
people and have decided to revive
the ancient custom of crowning a
May Queen as an example to all of
chastity and virtue.
Finding to their chagrin that
no girl can be found of
sufficiently pure habits, they hit
upon crowning as May King the
meek and chaste Albert Herring, a
greengrocer, as exemplar of clean
living. Albert, however, is not at
all sure he likes this and is torn
between his obedience to his
overbearing mother and the
attraction of the liberated lives of
his amorous young firiends Sid and
Nancy. The rest of the plot
concerns how Albert decides, with
the aid of some spiked lemonade,
to escape his Mum's apron strings
and experience the sins he'd
avoided.
Rich Comedy
This bare summary, though,
does not do justice to the rich
comedy of the opera. Britten's
sophisticated use of the chamber
orchestra is very witty, a worthy
foil and complement to the stage
action. The piano is used to
accompany the recitatives, as the
harpsichord was in the eighteenth
century, but with a modern twist.
These recitatives are both freer
and more complex than their
older counterparts.
Britten also uses a variety of
musical forms, some of them
"learned," to underline the
action; one thinks of the pompous

Handelian fugue "We've made our
own investigations," the delicious
harmonization of "Albert the
Good," or the nine-part threnody
"In the midst of life is death."
There is another dimension to
the comedy beyond this. It is not
simply the story of a docile
bumpkin raising hell for the first
time. Albert realizes clearly and
painfully his inhibitions and
shyness; he speaks of doubts and
terrors in a modern, almost
Freudian, sense.

This is one among several
undercurrents of pathos in the
opera. Britten includes a brooding
duet for alto flute and bass
clarinet (which, unfortunately,
tended to get lost in the noise of
scene changing) as a musical
counterpart to Albert's fears.
Time Theme
At several points in the opera
the theme of Time appears, with a
characteristic orchestral motive,
blandly interrupting Lady Billows'
meeting, devouring the lovers'
hours, and forcing Albert to
decide which road he will take.
Finally, the threnody over the
"dead" Albert in the last act
teeters between humor, as Mrs.
Herring abandons herself
luxuriously to grief, and a quiet
sense of universal mortality:
"Death awaits us one and all/
Death attends our smallest step."
One of the best aspects of Nile
Norton's interpretation of Albert
is this splendid combination of
funny and pathetic elements.
Norton is perfectly cast in the
role, combining a very fine tenor

voice with skillful acting.
Anthony Antolini played Sid with
fine verve; Lorna Castaneda and
Carole Klein were very good as
Nancy.
Michele Miland and Gail Wilson
gave excellent performances as
Lady Billows; both achieved the
commanding vocal sound
demanded by the role of the
elderly autocrat. Sheridan
Schroeter, as milady's
housekeeper, complemented her
mistress' priggishness well.

The audience was greatly
tickled by Mark Clemens'
portrayal of the unctuous vicar,
which relied upon his fine voice
and acting. Gerald Chappell did a
good job as the mayor; Jan
Shapiro and Pamela Erickson
twittered finely as the school
teacher, though at times Shapiro's

diction in the upper register was
unclear.
Robert Bernard was admirable
as the officious but good-hearted
Superintendent; his resonant low
notes were a delight. Jeanne
Cosmas and Jane Seaman were
good as Mrs. Herring, though
both have some diction problems.
Finally, Erickson, Shapiro, Diana
Haneke, and Christopher Madsen
were appropriately annoying as
the village urchins.
A large measure of praise must
go to John Barnett, the
conductor, for holding the show
together and coordinating very
well orchestra and singers. In such
a complicated score slight slip-ups
are inevitable, and it must be the
conductor's quick thinking that
makes the several performers
mesh together.
Barnett throughout kept a fast
pace; however, sometimes in
ensembles there seemed some
difference in opinion between
singers and conductor on the
tempi. The orchestra did an
admirable job with the difficult
score. John Olon-Scrymgeour's
stage direction was imaginative
and served the opera well.
The major criticism I must
offer of this production, however,
refers to its audience. This fine
show played to shockingly empty
houses its first two nights. It
deserves to be sold out for its last
performances on March 1-3. It is
not often one has a chance to see
such a combination of fine music,
excellent singing, and good fun. :
