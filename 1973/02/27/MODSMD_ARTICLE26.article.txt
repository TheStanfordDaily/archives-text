Vietnam Peace Parley Start Clouded
PARIS — East-West differences clouded the start of the
Vietnam peace parley yesterday. The Vietnamese
Communists resisted key U.S. proposals for the postwar
era.
But clashes of principle and procedure among the 13
participants seemed capable of compromise and the
confident forecast of delegates was that the parties
involved will sign a "hands-off-Vietnam" promise Friday.
Secretary of State William P. Rogers told the opening
session: "If each party around this table makes a total and
unrestrained commitment to playing a responsible role in
carrying out this agreement, then peace will be
guaranteed."
He was referring to the cease-fire agreement signed in
the same room just a month ago by the United States,
North and South Vietnam and the Viet Cong.
The tone of conciliation that marked Rogers' speech
brought few echos when Mrs. Bguyen Thi Binh, foreign
minister of the Viet Cong's Provisional Revolutionary
Government, delivered her address.
She spoke of her people winning "the most brutal war
of aggression in history." She charged the Saigon
government is torturing, ill-treating, murdering "hundreds
of thousands of patriots." She accused the United States
of pursuing a "policy against peace and national
concord."
These exchanges came after the conference had swiftly
adopted a set of rules for itself. They provided for U.S.
and North Vietnamese experts to produce the first draft
of a declaration which the conference as a whole will
present as its final act.
The realities of peacekeeping were thrust before the 13
delegations almost as they sat down.
Mitchell Sharp, foreign secretary of Canada, whose
country is one of four supervising the cease-fire, laid down
a virtual ultimatum.
Canada, he said, would quit the International
Commission of Control and Supervision on April 30
unless some system could be agreed for dealing with
violations of the cease-fire.
He urged a definite role for U.N. Secretary-General
Kurt Waldheim — a role empowering him to reconvene the
conference in certain circumstances.
The Canadian demand won immediate backing from
Rogers — but in quick succession Chinese, North
Vietnamese and Viet Cong spokesmen turned it down.
Essentially their objection is that the United Nations
should stay out of the Indochinese scene.
As they see it, the problem of peacekeeping should be
settled by the parties to the war themselves.
New North Viet Air Base Reported
SAIGON — U.S. sources reported yesterday that
American reconnaissance planes have turned up evidence
that North Vietnam is preparing its first air base in South
Vietnam with a battery of Soviet-built missiles to protect
it.
The Saigon government presented U.S. aerial
photographs purporting to show SAM 2 missile sites built
after the Jan. 28 cease-fire around Khe Sanh in the
northern quarter of South Vietnam. Saigon's
representatives asked the International Commission of
Control and Supervision for an immediate investigation.
They said Communist delegations to the four-party
Joint Military Commission refused to send a team to
investigate what they called a "blatant" cease-fire
violation.
U.S. sources said North Vietnamese engineers are

rebuilding a 4000-foot air strip at Khe Sanh that was first
constructed by American engineers in the late 19605.
The sources said it was not clear how North Vietnam
would use the air base, in Quang Tri Province about 15
miles below the demilitarized zone and six miles from the
Laotian border.
In a letter to the International Commission of Control
and Supervision, Lt. Gen. Du Quoc Dong, chief of the
South Vietnamese military delegation, declared:
"We believe that the introduction of SAM 2 missiles
into South Vietnam after the cease-fire, as well as the
overt establishment of missile sites at Khe Sanh, are
actions which may well ignite the fuse of resurgent war in
the near future."
Senior U.S. military sources said the U.S.
photo-reconnaissance backed up Saigon's charge that the
missiles were carried into South Vietnam after the
cease-fire.
But the chief North Vietnamese spokesman in Saigon,
Bui Tin, denied they were moved down after the
cease-fire, saying the Viet Cong have had SAM batteries in
Quang Tri Province for some time.
Phase 2 Wage Standard Retained
WASHINGTON — The Nixon administration said
yesterday it will retain the 5.5 percent guideline for wages
increases during Phase 3. But at the same time it signaled
some loosening of the pay standard.
Confusion and contradiction cloaked the major
economic policy announcements.
The confusion developed when President Nixon's chief
economic spokesman said that Phase 2's basic wage
standard would remain in effect. At the same time, the
administration embraced a broadly worded policy
statement which skirted any mention of the 5.5 percent
standard.
The statement said "no single standard or settlement
can be equally applicable at one time to all parties in an
economy so large, decentralized and dynamic."
Nixon's decision to make the rigid guidelines more
flexible appeared to be a major concession to labor.
Public and private statements of administration
officials indicated the move was an attempt to win labor's
backing for Nixon's revamped economic program.
AFL-CIO President George Meany has opposed the 5.5
percent standard as too low.
Nixon announced last month that he was ending Phase
2's mandatory wage-price controls for all but the food,
health and construction industries.
He named a labor-management advisory committee to
recommend a Phase 3 policy for wage increases, and that
committee's statement was released by the White House
yesterday.
Of its nine points, ranking administration officials
singled out this paragraph as "the basic guide" for Phase 3
wage increases:
"Considering the economy as a whole, responsible
wage behavior requires continuing stabilization in the
average rate of wage and benefit increase totai
compensation per man-hour in 1973 compared to 1972 so
as to be consistent with the goal set by the President of
getting the rate of inflation down to 2.5 percent or less by
the end of the year."

New North Viet Air Base Reported
SAIGON — U.S. sources reported yesterday that
American reconnaissance planes have turned up evidence
that North Vietnam is preparing its first air base in South
Vietnam with a battery of Soviet-built missiles to protect
it.
The Saigon government presented U.S. aerial
photographs purporting to show SAM 2 missile sites built
after the Jan. 28 cease-fire around Khe Sanh in the
northern quarter of South Vietnam. Saigon's
representatives asked the International Commission of
Control and Supervision for an immediate investigation.
They said Communist delegations to the four-party
Joint Military Commission refused to send a team to
investigate what they called a "blatant" cease-fire
violation.
U.S. sources said North Vietnamese engineers are

rebuilding a 4000-foot air strip at Khe Sanh that was first
constructed by American engineers in the late 19605.
The sources said it was not clear how North Vietnam
would use the air base, in Quang Tri Province about 15
miles below the demilitarized zone and six miles from the
Laotian border.
In a letter to the International Commission of Control
and Supervision, Lt. Gen. Du Quoc Dong, chief of the
South Vietnamese military delegation, declared:
"We believe that the introduction of SAM 2 missiles
into South Vietnam after the cease-fire, as well as the
overt establishment of missile sites at Khe Sanh, are
actions which may well ignite the fuse of resurgent war in
the near future."
Senior U.S. military sources said the U.S.
photo-reconnaissance backed up Saigon's charge that the
missiles were carried into South Vietnam after the
cease-fire.
But the chief North Vietnamese spokesman in Saigon,
Bui Tin, denied they were moved down after the
cease-fire, saying the Viet Cong have had SAM batteries in
Quang Tri Province for some time.
Phase 2 Wage Standard Retained
WASHINGTON — The Nixon administration said
yesterday it will retain the 5.5 percent guideline for wages
increases during Phase 3. But at the same time it signaled
some loosening of the pay standard.
Confusion and contradiction cloaked the major
economic policy announcements.
The confusion developed when President Nixon's chief
economic spokesman said that Phase 2's basic wage
standard would remain in effect. At the same time, the
administration embraced a broadly worded policy
statement which skirted any mention of the 5.5 percent
standard.
The statement said "no single standard or settlement
can be equally applicable at one time to all parties in an
economy so large, decentralized and dynamic."
Nixon's decision to make the rigid guidelines more
flexible appeared to be a major concession to labor.
Public and private statements of administration
officials indicated the move was an attempt to win labor's
backing for Nixon's revamped economic program.
AFL-CIO President George Meany has opposed the 5.5
percent standard as too low.
Nixon announced last month that he was ending Phase
2's mandatory wage-price controls for all but the food,
health and construction industries.
He named a labor-management advisory committee to
recommend a Phase 3 policy for wage increases, and that
committee's statement was released by the White House
yesterday.
Of its nine points, ranking administration officials
singled out this paragraph as "the basic guide" for Phase 3
wage increases:
"Considering the economy as a whole, responsible
wage behavior requires continuing stabilization in the
average rate of wage and benefit increase totai
compensation per man-hour in 1973 compared to 1972 so
as to be consistent with the goal set by the President of
getting the rate of inflation down to 2.5 percent or less by
the end of the year."

Vietnam Peace Parley Start Clouded
PARIS — East-West differences clouded the start of the
Vietnam peace parley yesterday. The Vietnamese
Communists resisted key U.S. proposals for the postwar
era.
But clashes of principle and procedure among the 13
participants seemed capable of compromise and the
confident forecast of delegates was that the parties
involved will sign a "hands-off-Vietnam" promise Friday.
Secretary of State William P. Rogers told the opening
session: "If each party around this table makes a total and
unrestrained commitment to playing a responsible role in
carrying out this agreement, then peace will be
guaranteed."
He was referring to the cease-fire agreement signed in
the same room just a month ago by the United States,
North and South Vietnam and the Viet Cong.
The tone of conciliation that marked Rogers' speech
brought few echos when Mrs. Bguyen Thi Binh, foreign
minister of the Viet Cong's Provisional Revolutionary
Government, delivered her address.
She spoke of her people winning "the most brutal war
of aggression in history." She charged the Saigon
government is torturing, ill-treating, murdering "hundreds
of thousands of patriots." She accused the United States
of pursuing a "policy against peace and national
concord."
These exchanges came after the conference had swiftly
adopted a set of rules for itself. They provided for U.S.
and North Vietnamese experts to produce the first draft
of a declaration which the conference as a whole will
present as its final act.

They said Communist delegations to the four-party
Joint Military Commission refused to send a team to
investigate what they called a "blatant" cease-fire
violation.
U.S. sources said North Vietnamese engineers are

rebuilding a 4000-foot air strip at Khe Sanh that was first
constructed by American engineers in the late 19605.
The sources said it was not clear how North Vietnam
would use the air base, in Quang Tri Province about 15
miles below the demilitarized zone and six miles from the
Laotian border.
In a letter to the International Commission of Control
and Supervision, Lt. Gen. Du Quoc Dong, chief of the
South Vietnamese military delegation, declared:
"We believe that the introduction of SAM 2 missiles
into South Vietnam after the cease-fire, as well as the
overt establishment of missile sites at Khe Sanh, are
actions which may well ignite the fuse of resurgent war in
the near future."
Senior U.S. military sources said the U.S.
photo-reconnaissance backed up Saigon's charge that the
missiles were carried into South Vietnam after the
cease-fire.
But the chief North Vietnamese spokesman in Saigon,
Bui Tin, denied they were moved down after the
cease-fire, saying the Viet Cong have had SAM batteries in
Quang Tri Province for some time.
Phase 2 Wage Standard Retained
WASHINGTON — The Nixon administration said
yesterday it will retain the 5.5 percent guideline for wages
increases during Phase 3. But at the same time it signaled
some loosening of the pay standard.
Confusion and contradiction cloaked the major
economic policy announcements.
The confusion developed when President Nixon's chief
economic spokesman said that Phase 2's basic wage
standard would remain in effect. At the same time, the
administration embraced a broadly worded policy
statement which skirted any mention of the 5.5 percent
standard.
The statement said "no single standard or settlement
can be equally applicable at one time to all parties in an
economy so large, decentralized and dynamic."
Nixon's decision to make the rigid guidelines more
flexible appeared to be a major concession to labor.
Public and private statements of administration
officials indicated the move was an attempt to win labor's
backing for Nixon's revamped economic program.
AFL-CIO President George Meany has opposed the 5.5
percent standard as too low.
Nixon announced last month that he was ending Phase
2's mandatory wage-price controls for all but the food,
health and construction industries.
He named a labor-management advisory committee to
recommend a Phase 3 policy for wage increases, and that
committee's statement was released by the White House
yesterday.
Of its nine points, ranking administration officials
singled out this paragraph as "the basic guide" for Phase 3
wage increases:
"Considering the economy as a whole, responsible
wage behavior requires continuing stabilization in the
average rate of wage and benefit increase totai
compensation per man-hour in 1973 compared to 1972 so
as to be consistent with the goal set by the President of
getting the rate of inflation down to 2.5 percent or less by
the end of the year."
Today's Weather
Rain today continuing at times through tonight turning to
showers tomorrow. Little cooler tomorrow. Low nights in
mid 40s to mid 50s. High today in upper 50s to low 60s
and tomorrow in 50s. Chance of rain 80 percent today
and 80 percent tonight.
Vietnam Peace Parley Start Clouded
PARIS — East-West differences clouded the start of the
Vietnam peace parley yesterday. The Vietnamese
Communists resisted key U.S. proposals for the postwar
era.
But clashes of principle and procedure among the 13
participants seemed capable of compromise and the
confident forecast of delegates was that the parties
involved will sign a "hands-off-Vietnam" promise Friday.
Secretary of State William P. Rogers told the opening
session: "If each party around this table makes a total and
unrestrained commitment to playing a responsible role in
carrying out this agreement, then peace will be
guaranteed."
He was referring to the cease-fire agreement signed in
the same room just a month ago by the United States,
North and South Vietnam and the Viet Cong.
The tone of conciliation that marked Rogers' speech
brought few echos when Mrs. Bguyen Thi Binh, foreign
minister of the Viet Cong's Provisional Revolutionary
Government, delivered her address.
She spoke of her people winning "the most brutal war
of aggression in history." She charged the Saigon
government is torturing, ill-treating, murdering "hundreds
of thousands of patriots." She accused the United States
of pursuing a "policy against peace and national
concord."
These exchanges came after the conference had swiftly
adopted a set of rules for itself. They provided for U.S.
and North Vietnamese experts to produce the first draft
of a declaration which the conference as a whole will
present as its final act.
The realities of peacekeeping were thrust before the 13
delegations almost as they sat down.
Mitchell Sharp, foreign secretary of Canada, whose
country is one of four supervising the cease-fire, laid down
a virtual ultimatum.
Canada, he said, would quit the International
Commission of Control and Supervision on April 30
unless some system could be agreed for dealing with
violations of the cease-fire.
He urged a definite role for U.N. Secretary-General
Kurt Waldheim — a role empowering him to reconvene the
conference in certain circumstances.
The Canadian demand won immediate backing from
Rogers — but in quick succession Chinese, North
Vietnamese and Viet Cong spokesmen turned it down.
Essentially their objection is that the United Nations
should stay out of the Indochinese scene.
As they see it, the problem of peacekeeping should be
settled by the parties to the war themselves.
New North Viet Air Base Reported
SAIGON — U.S. sources reported yesterday that
American reconnaissance planes have turned up evidence
that North Vietnam is preparing its first air base in South
Vietnam with a battery of Soviet-built missiles to protect
it.
The Saigon government presented U.S. aerial
photographs purporting to show SAM 2 missile sites built
after the Jan. 28 cease-fire around Khe Sanh in the
northern quarter of South Vietnam. Saigon's
representatives asked the International Commission of
Control and Supervision for an immediate investigation.

Joint Military Commission refused to send a team to
investigate what they called a "blatant" cease-fire
