# Hanoi Halts POW Releases, Claims U.S. Violated Truce

From the Associated Press
SAIGON — The chief spokesman for
the North Vietnamese delegation said
today there will be no further release
of American prisoners of war until
several other points in the Vietnam
peace agreement are honored.
"The United States is responsible
for the total application of the
agreement," Hanoi spokesman Bui Tin
declared.
He said authorities in Hanoi and
officials of the Viet Cong's Provisional
Revolutionary Government had
ordered a freeze on the release of
American prisoners in both North and
South Vietnam.

He characterized the situation as
"critical."
Just before Tin's announcement,
American military sources at Clark Air
Base in the Philippines said North
Vietnam was expected to hand over in
Saigon tomorrow a list of POWs to be
freed the following day.
Tin said three critical points must
be resolved before the next group of
American prisoners will be released:
—Strict application of the
cease-fire.
—Simulataneous return of civilian
and military prisoners.
—A guarantee of improved working
conditions for the four-party Joint

Military Commission.
Tin said the Hanoi government
understands very well the feelings of
the families of the American prisoners
and all Americans who wait for them
to come home.
"But we must also think of the
families of Vietnamese prisoners and
of the millions of Vietnamese who are
hoping for peace that they expect to
come through the strict application of
the Paris peace agreement."
He charged that the U.S. delegation
"has shown bad faith and has shown
only interest in getting U.S. prisoners
back."
There was no immediate comment
from the U.S. delegation.
A subcommission on captured
persons convened again this morning
in efforts to resolve the differences.
The United States had said earlier it
would press the Communist delegation
for a list and timetable of the next
group of American prisoners to be
released.
A total of 163 American POWs
have been released so far. According to
North Vietnamese figures, 407
American servicem an and 15 American
civilians are still to be released.
Homecoming officials at Clark Air
Base pointed out the peace agreement
says only: "The return of all captured
persons ... shall be completed within
60 days after the signing of the
agreement at a rate no slower than the
rate of withdrawal from South
Vietnam of United States forces and
those of other foreign countries."
The U.S. Command reported that
more than 50 percent of the American
force level at the time of the cease-fire
has been withdrawn from Vietnam and
fewer than 12,000 troops remain.
With this in mind U.S. officials
pointed out that as of yesterday the
Communist side had released a little
more than one-fourth of the 585
American prisoners it held.
The North Vietnamese have
repeatedly charged the Saigon
government has harrassed and
provoked their representatives and has
sanctioned demonstrations that have
led to violence against members of the
Hanoi delegation.
At least seven North Vietnamese
delegates were injured by mobs of
rock-throwing demonstrators in the
northern cities of Hue and Da Nang on
Sunday, according to Tin.
Tin said if the harrassment,
provocation and lack of security and
adequate accommodations continued,
the Joint Military Commission could
not function.
