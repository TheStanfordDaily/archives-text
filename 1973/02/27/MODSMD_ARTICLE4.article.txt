# Debaters Seek Support Through Fee Assessment
## 
### 
"If given the opportunity to attend
tournaments regularly, we would have
one of the top three debate squads in
the nation," asserts Ken Oliver, a
member of Stanford's Debate Union.
In order to participate in more
tournaments, the Debate Union is
asking for a fee assessment of $1 in
tomorrow's ASSU election. The
money will be used to pay the
expenses of entering tournaments,
held in colleges throughout the nation.
According to Oliver, the money will
serve two objectives: more people will
be encouraged to participate in debate,
and Stanford will be able to enter
more national tournaments, where the
teams can compete against
higher-calibre schools.
At present, Stanford has only six
debaters, three debate teams.
Until spring quarter of 1971,
debate was included in the Speech and
Drama Department. Then, the budget
was cut and speech and debate were

dropped from the regular curriculum.
Since then, interested individuals
have reorganized on their own and
have continued debating. They found
a sponsor in Gary Roberts, a student
in the Stanford Law School. Since
debate is no longer offered as a course,
all research and practice must be done
during the students' spare time.
Oliver feels that debating is
comparable to athletics in that it is
competition against other schools
which involves long hours of work and
practice before the actual
confrontation. "This school attracts
the top talent of high school debate,"
he says.
Besides asking for a fee assessment
from the ASSU, the Debate Union is
also trying to secure funds from
alumni organizations.
Squad members say that they may
attempt to make the ASSU fee
assessment a regular, annual portion of
the budget, so that they can continue
to attend national debates.
