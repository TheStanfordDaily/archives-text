# Safety Officers' Accord Released
## 
### CHARLES BENNETT 
University Public Safety
Department officers who feel they
have been unfairly denied deputization
will have recourse to binding
arbitration under the new contract
negotiated by the Officers Association
and the University.
Details of the accord were released

yesterday afternoon by University
legal counsel Douglas Barton. The pact
has been ratified by both parties, and
will be signed today at 4 p.m.
The contract also calls for the
establishment of an "agency shop,"
under which employees of the
department must either join the
association or pay a sum equal to

union dues, as compensation for the
services the union provides.
Arbiter's Background
Union President Albert King said
last night that if an officer should ask
for arbitration, the University has
informally agreed that the arbiter will
be someone "with a law enforcement
background."
"It's not going to be a psychology
professor, it's not going to be some
Ph.D." said King. "It's going to be a
man in law enforcement. He knows
the problems, he knows what's
happening in the field, and that's the
sort of arbitrator we're going to have."
The Public Safety Department is
presently divided into an armed
Mobile Patrol division, and an
unarmed, plainclothes Community
Service division. None of the officers
are "peace officers" in the legal sense,
meaning they have no more power
than an ordinary citizen.
The University has been planning to
reorganize the department for over a
year, but has been stymied by inability
to reach any agreement with the
union.
Stumbling Block
The major stumbling block to the
reorganization was removed last March

when Santa Clara County Sheriff
James Geary agreed to swear into the
Sheriffs reserves any officer who
could meet state "peace officer"
standards.
Public Safety Department Director
Marvin Herrington has planned to
promote some mobile patrol officers
under that agreement, hire some men
from outside for deputization, and
denote the rest of the mobile
division to community service status.
The Sheriff retains the right to refuse
deputization of anyone he feels to be
unqualified.
Barton said that if Herrington
should refuse to recommend one of
the present mobile patrol officers for
deputization in the reserves, and if
under the contract an arbiter should
find that Herrington's decision was
"arbitrary and capricious," then the
man's name would be sent to the
Sheriff regardless of Herrington's
objections.
Major Issue
This has been the major issue of
controversy throughout the long
negotiation process, and the solution
reflects compromise on both sides,
according to Barton.
