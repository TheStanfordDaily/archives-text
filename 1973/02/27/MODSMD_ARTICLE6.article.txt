# Judge Won't Dismiss Papers Indictment
## 
### ED KOHN Special to the Daily 
LOS ANGELES â€” U.S. District Court
Judge Matt Byrne Jr. yesterday
refused to dismiss all 15 counts of the
indictment against "Pentagon Papers"
defendants Daniel Ellsberg and
Anthony Russo Jr.
However, Byrne did dismiss two
espionage counts, one against each
defendant.
Ellsberg and Russo now face a total
of 13 counts of conspiracy, theft of
government property and espionage
for allegedly duplicating and
distributing copies of the top secret,
7000-page study of American
involvement in Vietnam between 1945
and 1967. After yesterday's brief
hearing, Russo termed Byrne's ruling
"a real victory." However, most of
those seated at the defense table
looked disappointed.
Ellsberg now faces a possible
maximum sentence of 105 years, while

Russo could be sentenced to a 30-year
term.
In making his ruling yesterday,
Byrne told the court: "There are
questions of constitutionality of some
of the statutes in this case, but they
can best be judged and considered
when all the evidence is in."
Byrne said that at this point in the
trial he is required to view the
evidence presented so far "in the light
most favorable to the government."
During a day-long session Friday,
the defense argued that the
prosecution did not produce enough
evidence to prove that either
defendant "intended to achieve any
unlawful objective" by removing and
copying the documents in 1969.
Attorney Charles Nesson argued
that, at most, evidence presented so
far showed an agreement to copy a
small number of documents over a
short period of time. He also argued
that, at the time of indictment in
1971, the details of the Vietnam War
contained in the "Papers" no longer
bore any relation to the national
defense.
Nesson also asked Byrne to discuss
or to separate the two-part conspiracy
charge into two counts, but the judge
refused. "I find no authority for a
judgment of acquittal or to sever
different parts or items of a count,"
Byrne said during yesterday's
10-minute session.
Byrne also ruled that despite the
exculpatory material the prosecution
was ordered to tum over to the
defense, Ellsberg's attorney may not
make supplemental opening remarks
to the jurors, who were excused for
one week while defense attorneys
successfully argued that they should
be given the material.
However, Russo's attorneys chose
not to make an opening statement
when the trial began five weeks ago, so
attorney Leonard Weinglass will make
Russo's opening statement today after
the completion of the government's
case. The government's tenth and final
witness, a retired FBI fingerprint
analyst, is expected to complete his
testimony this morning.
Defense lawyers have said they
expect to call at least 30 witnesses and
that their portion of the trial will last
six weeks.
