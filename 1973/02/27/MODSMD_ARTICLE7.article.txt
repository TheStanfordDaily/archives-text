## No On Law Firm 
### 
We urge students to vote no on the proposed fee
assessment of one dollar per quarter for three quarters
requested by Citizens Advocates of Stanford, Inc.
Citizens Advocates "will engage in study, negotiation,
representation and litigation of problems affecting the
general public." The "public interest law firm" plans to
begin with one full-time attorney, a para-legal assistant and a
staff of student researchers who would receive credit
through SWOPSI. Welfare reform and sexual discrimination
in prison are proposed areas of investigation.
Citizens Advocates will not be a legal aid society and it
will not deal specifically with student problems or student
rights.
The firm plans to exist for the first year on funds from
the fee assessment, then hopes to attract funds from
foundations, alumni and private law firms. However,
Citizens Advocates has not ruled out the possibility that it
will ask for more student money next year.
We believe that Citizens Advocates is potentially a very
worthwhile project, but it should not be funded by a levy on
the student body. Public interest law is a good cause, it
deserves our money as much as the Heart Fund or ZPG or
the ACLU. Students can contribute to the good causes of
their choice. We urge those concerned with public interest
law to contribute to Citizens Advocates-but they should
not be coerced into contributing to any particular good
cause. !
Proponents of the assessment insist that the money is
refundable, but in practice this means that students have to
go to a great deal of time and trouble to get back what was
their money in the first place.
While good and just laws benefit us all ultimately, the
only immediate benefit to students from Citizens Advocates
comes in the form of legal experience for pre-law students.
We urge the law school to seriously consider funding
Citizens Advocates for the first year and helping it to attract
outside support. It would be logical and appropriate for the
law school to back a venture in public interest law and legal
education.
Our logic is similar in advising students to reject the $1
assessment for the Debate Union. A victim of budget cuts in
the Speech and Drama department, the Debate Union wants
money to pay a coach and to cover travel expenses. However
the money would be funneled from too many to too few;
only a handful of students participate in debate. We urge the
University to maintain a debate program here by supporting
the Debate Union financially.
