# 'Short-Sighted Penny-Pinching'
## Support The Advocates 
### 
Edit Board Minority

We believe the decision by a
majority of our fellow editorial
board members not to endorse the
Stanford Advocate fee proposition
is improvident, both practically
and philosophically.
The refundable fee assessment
of $1 per quarter for three
quarters would provide for an
experienced attorney, legal
secretary, and office expenses
with which litigation on major
social issues could be advanced.
The majority of the board agreed
with the goals of such a program.
But they believe that the law
school should pay for the
program.
This reasoning represents
unnecessary penny-pinching. The
law school is in no position to
provide start-up funds for a
program as admittedly
action-oriented as Stanford
Advocates.
Beneficiaries
True, Stanford law students
would be major beneficiaries of
the program. But so would
undergraduates, who would be
able to get a taste of real legal
research under the supervision of
law students. Academic credit
would be awarded for such work
as well.
To dismiss the possibility of a
student-supported public interest
law practice by tossing the
financing ball into the University's
court is akin to saying, "We want
the fruits of public interest
litigation as long as we don't have
to foot the bill."
Students would benefit from
the formation of Stanford
Advocates in the short and long
run. In the short run, with a
student majority on the board of
directors of the organization, the
cases students believe are of
paramount interest would be
taken by the organization. In the
long run, students and society in
general would enjoy the benefits
by having lawyers use the law for
the public good.
Short-Sigh ted
Should we be so short-sighted
as to forget the crying social and
legal inequities articulated in the
sixties, now that we have a
competent means of doing
something about them? Stanford
Advocates, in asking for start-up
funding, is trying to provide a
meaningful and workable program

to addresssome of those inequities,
Anthony Amsterdam, the
noted law professor, has
enthusiastically endorsed the
Stanford Advocates initiative.
More than any member of the
editorial board, Amsterdam
knows how hard it is to gain
funding from University or law
school sources.
Moreover, student bodies at
the University of Oregon, the
University of Minnesota, Berkeley
and elsewhere have supported a
public interest law organization.
Finally, to believe that funding
can be found in a budget already
as tight as the University's is
wishful thinking by the board
majority.
The fact is. no one but the

student body can provide the
start-up money for Stanford
Advocates. With matching
foundation grants and court
awards, Stanford Advocates
should become a self-supporting
organization.
It seems clear that if we want
to go beyond lipservice to righting
social wrongs, we have to put our
money where our rhetoric is. And
considering that the request is
modest—as well as refundable—we
feel that the majority position
reflects a victory of purse-strings
over conscience. Accordingly, we
urge support of the Stanford
Advocates assessment.

Edit Board Minority

We believe the decision by a
majority of our fellow editorial
board members not to endorse the
Stanford Advocate fee proposition
is improvident, both practically
and philosophically.
The refundable fee assessment
of $1 per quarter for three
quarters would provide for an
experienced attorney, legal
secretary, and office expenses
with which litigation on major
social issues could be advanced.
The majority of the board agreed
with the goals of such a program.
But they believe that the law
school should pay for the
program.
This reasoning represents
unnecessary penny-pinching. The
law school is in no position to
provide start-up funds for a
program as admittedly
action-oriented as Stanford
Advocates.
Beneficiaries
True, Stanford law students
would be major beneficiaries of
the program. But so would
undergraduates, who would be
able to get a taste of real legal
research under the supervision of
law students. Academic credit
would be awarded for such work
as well.
To dismiss the possibility of a
student-supported public interest
law practice by tossing the
financing ball into the University's
court is akin to saying, "We want
the fruits of public interest
litigation as long as we don't have
to foot the bill."
Students would benefit from
the formation of Stanford
Advocates in the short and long
run. In the short run, with a
student majority on the board of
directors of the organization, the
cases students believe are of
paramount interest would be
taken by the organization. In the
long run, students and society in
general would enjoy the benefits
by having lawyers use the law for
the public good.
Short-Sigh ted
Should we be so short-sighted
as to forget the crying social and
legal inequities articulated in the
sixties, now that we have a
competent means of doing
something about them? Stanford
Advocates, in asking for start-up
funding, is trying to provide a
meaningful and workable program

to addresssome of those inequities,
Anthony Amsterdam, the
noted law professor, has
enthusiastically endorsed the
Stanford Advocates initiative.
More than any member of the
editorial board, Amsterdam
knows how hard it is to gain
funding from University or law
school sources.
Moreover, student bodies at
the University of Oregon, the
University of Minnesota, Berkeley
and elsewhere have supported a
public interest law organization.
Finally, to believe that funding
can be found in a budget already
as tight as the University's is
wishful thinking by the board
majority.
The fact is. no one but the

student body can provide the
start-up money for Stanford
Advocates. With matching
foundation grants and court
awards, Stanford Advocates
should become a self-supporting
organization.
It seems clear that if we want
to go beyond lipservice to righting
social wrongs, we have to put our
money where our rhetoric is. And
considering that the request is
modest—as well as refundable—we
feel that the majority position
reflects a victory of purse-strings
over conscience. Accordingly, we
urge support of the Stanford
Advocates assessment.
