# Safety Director Lauds Stanford-Officer Accord
## 
### CHESS ERWIN 
Stanford Department of Public
Safety Director Marvin Herrington said
last evening that the agreement
reached between the Public Safety
Officers' Association and the
University will have a "positive effect"
on his department and that the
association and the department were
satisfied with the compromise
agreement.
Interviewed on KZSU's Campus
Conference, Herrington discussed the
effect the new agreement will have on
the plans of his department to secure
reserve deputy status from the Santa
Clara County Sheriff's Department for
the department's mobile patrol
officers.
Herrington stated that, although his
department had no immediate plans or
timetable for the proposed
deputization , he and his staff would
begin immediately to formulate the
steps necessary to recruit, select and
train reserve deputies.
However, he said the present
mobile patrol officers would be
considered separately for deputization
and that provisions would be made
later for recruitment of men from
outside the University.
Before any further action can be
taken on this issue, the University
must approve the agreement between
the Department of Public Safety and
the Sheriffs office concerning any
deputization arrangements.
Questioned about the status of the
Stanford community service officers,
Herrington explained that they will
continue to remain unarmed and will
serve the same functions as they do
now. These consist primarily of traffic

and parking enforcement during the
day and seeing to it that buildings and
other private property on campus are
secure at night.
Arbitration of disputes between the
Safety Officer's Association and the
department will be handled by an
outside arbiter, experienced in the
problems of law enforcement,
according to Herrington. This had
been one of the thornier problems of
the recent negotiations, but the
University conceded to the
Association's demands for outside

arbitration.
Herrington said it is hoped that
completion of the Public Safety
Department reorganization will be
possible by the start of Fall quarter,
1973. Future plans call for a total of
60-65 officers in the department with
equal numbers being divided between
the community officer status and the
mobile patrol-reserve deputy class. The
University will continue to pay the
officers' salaries. The question of the
officers'uniforms and patrol cars is still
unsettled.
