# Opponents 'Stupid Or Warped'
## Debate Benefits All 
### 
i Gary Roberts

The logic of those who oppose the $1 Debate
Union fee assessment, including the Daily, is less
than brilliant. None of them deny any of the
impeccable arguments which lend support to the
assessment. All they say is that too few people
benefit. I make two responses to this bullshit.
First, the statement is untrue. It is true we had
only a few students this year, but the team had only
pennies to work with and would not support more
than a few. In addition, most students were not
even aware of the program since we just rejuvenated
it this fall. I talked with many students who wanted
to participate in debate this year but couldn't
because (a) they heard about it too late, and (b) our
budget could not allow them to go to any
tournaments.
Three years ago, over 200 students were on the
debate team, and with a proper budget there is no
reason that number will not be involved again.
Benefits All
In addition, a strong and acknowledged debate
team benefits the whole University community, not
just debaters. The value of a Stanford education
increases as the University increases in academic
prestige, and a strong debate program is a
tremendous source of such prestige.
It's absurd to have the schools we like to
compare Stanford with winning national
tournaments weekly while we go occasionally to
Hayward State. In addition, many brilliant high
school grads go elsewhere in order to pursue debate
which they can't get here. Clearly, we all benefit
from a strong national debate program.
Second, even if only a few benefited (which is
untrue), it is no reason for not funding the program.
Few people benefit from the band or the rugby
team or numerous other groups such as these. In

each case, a large number of people funnel money
into a program benefiting only a few.
Nonsense
True, these are funded through tuition, but the
principle is the same. Why not call for cessation of
all funding for programs in which only a few
participate? The answer is obviously because such
logic is stupid, and it is stupid when applied to the
debate team. Just because Stanford has singled out
debate and speech to be cut from tuition funded
groups is no warrant for saying debate alone should
not be funded because only "a few benefit." By
that thinking, the federal government should not
fund scholarships or loans for students. After all,
only a few benefit. What nonsense!
Consider, in addition, that Stanford has no
speech program of any kind. A Stanford student
who needs even minimal speech experience must
look to extracurricular activities for it. Amazingly
enough, debate is the only such activity available. If
it gets no funds, the students here who want or need
such experience are totally denied. What a tragedy
at a school like Stanford.
In short, all students should ask themselves two
questions: (1) is debate a program worthy of
funding (which nobody denies it is), and (2) is the
fee assessment reasonable (keeping in mind it's the
only available method)? The $1 refundable burden
on each student is clearly not a burden which is
unwarranted by the indirect benefit all of us receive,
plus the great and essential benefit all students in
need of speech experience receive. Anyone who
thinks otherwise is either stupid or has terribly
warped values.

The logic of those who oppose the $1 Debate
Union fee assessment, including the Daily, is less
than brilliant. None of them deny any of the
impeccable arguments which lend support to the
assessment. All they say is that too few people
benefit. I make two responses to this bullshit.
First, the statement is untrue. It is true we had
only a few students this year, but the team had only
pennies to work with and would not support more
than a few. In addition, most students were not
even aware of the program since we just rejuvenated
it this fall. I talked with many students who wanted
to participate in debate this year but couldn't
because (a) they heard about it too late, and (b) our
budget could not allow them to go to any
tournaments.
Three years ago, over 200 students were on the
debate team, and with a proper budget there is no
reason that number will not be involved again.
Benefits All
In addition, a strong and acknowledged debate
team benefits the whole University community, not
just debaters. The value of a Stanford education
increases as the University increases in academic
prestige, and a strong debate program is a
tremendous source of such prestige.
It's absurd to have the schools we like to
compare Stanford with winning national
tournaments weekly while we go occasionally to
Hayward State. In addition, many brilliant high
school grads go elsewhere in order to pursue debate
which they can't get here. Clearly, we all benefit
from a strong national debate program.
Second, even if only a few benefited (which is
untrue), it is no reason for not funding the program.
Few people benefit from the band or the rugby
team or numerous other groups such as these. In

each case, a large number of people funnel money
into a program benefiting only a few.
Nonsense
True, these are funded through tuition, but the
principle is the same. Why not call for cessation of
all funding for programs in which only a few
participate? The answer is obviously because such
logic is stupid, and it is stupid when applied to the
debate team. Just because Stanford has singled out
debate and speech to be cut from tuition funded
groups is no warrant for saying debate alone should
not be funded because only "a few benefit." By
that thinking, the federal government should not
fund scholarships or loans for students. After all,
only a few benefit. What nonsense!
Consider, in addition, that Stanford has no
speech program of any kind. A Stanford student
who needs even minimal speech experience must
look to extracurricular activities for it. Amazingly
enough, debate is the only such activity available. If
it gets no funds, the students here who want or need
such experience are totally denied. What a tragedy
at a school like Stanford.
In short, all students should ask themselves two
questions: (1) is debate a program worthy of
funding (which nobody denies it is), and (2) is the
fee assessment reasonable (keeping in mind it's the
only available method)? The $1 refundable burden
on each student is clearly not a burden which is
unwarranted by the indirect benefit all of us receive,
plus the great and essential benefit all students in
need of speech experience receive. Anyone who
thinks otherwise is either stupid or has terribly
warped values.
