# How To Take Action
## Vietnam: An Effective Response 
### 
Michael Thorman

Gordon Firestein ("Protest
Ongoing War," Daily, Feb. 21)
presents the dilemma that many
in the anti-war movement now
face when they realize that,
contrary to the claims of the
administration, the war in
Vietnam is not over. But while
Firestein quite correctly asserts
that we must take action, his
narrow definition of the problem
has assured the inefficacy of our
response. Only by considering the
war in the context of U.S.
imperialism can we hope to devise
an effective course of action.
First, we must see the U.S.
involvement in Vietnam for what
it is. Since growth is essential to
the U.S. economic system,
exploitation of the third world by
U.S. economic interests long ago
became a necessary condition for
continued profits.
Third world countries offer an
inexpensive supply of raw
materials, an inexpensive supply
of labor, and markets for U.S.
goods. To ensure the existence of
these foreign markets, the U.S.

needs governments that will
acquiesce to this exploitation.
Movements of national liberation
directly conflict with imperialist
exploitation.
Exploitation
The war in Vietnam has been a
flagrant and obvious example of
an attempt by U.S. economic
interests to keep an open market
for exploitation. The government
was never interested in
self-determination for the
Vietnamese people; rather, it was
interested in maintaining a puppet
regime that would accept
economic exploitation. Southeast
Asia offers a wealth of natural
resources (including oil), has
already shown itself to be a
market for U.S. goods, and can be
a valuable source of cheap labor
to industrialists.
In this context, we can see that
Nixon has not been trying to end
the war (except on terms
consistent with economic
exploitation) but to reduce the
visibility of the war to a point
where it becomes politically
acceptable. Despite the truce, the
government will continue to fight
for an exploitable Vietnam, albeit
in a less visible manner.
But Vietnam must be seen as
merely one example of economic
exploitation. Others abound.
Foot In Door
The United States continues to
support repressive regimes in the
Philippines, South Africa, South
and Central America, Spain, and
Greece. The nature of U.S.
economic and military interests in
these areas requires the
maintenance of regimes that are
friendly to the United States. This
is the "foot in the door" that is
essential to economic imperialism.
Exploitation is not) limited to
foreign peoples. The interests of
big business continue to support
agribusiness against Chicano farm
workers and management against
labor struggles.
The history of the labor
movement throughout the world
is the story of the attempts by
management to increase their
profits at the expense of workers'
basic rights to humane working

conditions and a decent wage.
Although this right has been won
by some workers (mostly white)
in the larger, more powerful
unions, workers with weak unions
and workers with no unions at all
continue to struggle to resist this
form of exploitation. And it is no
mere coincidence that the
majority of this country's
exploited workers are third world
people.
Domestic Repression
Repression in the form of
grand juries, denial of rights of
prisoners and minorities, and
political dragnets (including
electronic surveillance, no-knock
laws, preventive detention, and
political trials) are just some of
the means by which the
government tries to maintain its
hold on the power to exploit
people.
Repression achieves this effect
in at least two ways. First, by
stifling and intimidating effective
dissent, the government hopes to
achieve a citizenry that will
passively accept the rule of the
few for their own benefit. And
second, by dividing the people
among themselves—whites against
third world, intellectuals against
working people, rich against
poor—the government * prevents
people from uniting against
exploitation.
By failing to see the war as an
example of exploitation, we are
allowing the same war to continue
on other fronts. The fighting in
Vietnam may one day cease, but
the nature of the attitudes that

bred that conflict—and hence the
continued existence of various
forms of exploitation—will not
have changed.
What To Do
In this context, Firestein's
dilemma of deciding what to do
becomes easier. Dealing with
Vietnam means dealing with
repression and exploitation on all
fronts. It means supporting labor
struggles by boycotting, picketing,
and organizing. It means resisting
repression with all the political,
financial, and legal means
available. It means supporting the
demands of minorities for equal
right and pol itical
self-determination. All these
struggles are going on right now at
Stanford and in the Bay Area and
they need support.
I don't mean to denigrate the
concern over the continuing war
in Vietnam; it is very important
that we be aware, and make other
people aware, of the real nature of
Nixon's "peace." But
strategically, we must recognize
that because of the low visibility
of the war, our ability to affect its
course is at a new all-time low.
When the only course of action
available is to write to Congress, it
should become clear that it's time
to turn to other forms of the same
issue. It is now time for the
members of the anti-war
movement to direct their energies
toward the other continuing
struggles against repression and
exploitation in the world today.
