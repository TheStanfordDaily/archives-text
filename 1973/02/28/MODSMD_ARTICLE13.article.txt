Reactions Wanted
Editor:
The Merryman Commission's
report on the Overseas Campuses
has been released for a month
with what seems to be very little
student reaction.
The present concept of the
overseas campus has been
challenged with alternative
program ideas. But without
student response it is impossible
to implement plans that will
increase the usefulness and
popularity of the overseas
program.
In addition, the Search
Committee for a new Director
needs student input.
We urge all those interested to
obtain a copy of the report in the
Overseas Campuses office and
then write to the Office of the
President with your reactions.

Rick Rolandi, Chairman
Citizens' Advocates
and SWOPSI
Editor:
SWOPSI Workshops have
action orientations. That means
that they are supposed to make a
difference. What you learn should
be used to create a better society.
In the past this action
orientation has usually meant
written reports on specific issues.
The effectiveness of these reports
has varied considerably.
Information although important
to change is not usually the
sufficient condition for creating
change.
Much of the early SWOPSI
action was based on the notion
that "if only the King knew, then
he would punish the evil tax
collector." Not only is the
collector the King's
brother-in-law, but those
collections keep the King in
power. Thus, knowledge is not
enough. More leverage must be
applied if change is to occur.
Citizens' Advocates at Stanford
offers the SWOPSI program a new
way to have an input into society.
A public interest law firm is
the natural partner for a student
initiated action program. SWOPSI
will do the research and make
recommendations and Citizens'
Advocates will follow through
with the appropriate legal action.
Thus, Stanford students will be
able to put some real muscle
behind the recommendation they
come up with in the workshops.
In short, the combination of
Citizens' Advocates and SWOPSI
will give the Stanford student
body both the research and legal
capabilities necessary for bringing
about constructive social change.

Director, SWOPSI
