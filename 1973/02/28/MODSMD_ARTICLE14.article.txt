# Students Must Demonstrate Interest
## For Citizens' Advocates 
### 
John Bradley

As students vote today and
tomorrow in the ASSU Special
Referendum election to determine
the future of Citizens' Advocates
at Stanford, several points should
be kept in mind.
The first is simply that without
student support a public interest
law firm will not exist here.
Students must demonstrate their
interest before any outside
financial support will be given.
Foundations, law firms and
alumni all can be expected to
assist materially, but students will
make it work. A "yes" vote for
Citizens' Advocates will clearly
indicate this concern for social
issues.
Second, Citizens' Advocates at
Stanford was conceived with the
intention of utilizing all of the
technical knowledge available
here. Combining the technical
expertise provided by the
Stanford community with the
legal ability of an established
lawyer will yield a result which is
greater than the sum of the parts.
A public interest law firm based in
San Francisco would not be able
to maintain the intimate contact
with student researchers and
faculty experts that Citizens'
Advocates intends. Students
working on projects which were
once likely to end up on a shelf
somewhere will be presented with
the opportunity to use the results
of their effort to spur needed
improvement.
Student Control
A further distinguishing feature
of Citizens' Advocates at Stanford
is the student control written into
the Articles of Incorporation and
submitted to the State of
California. Seven students sit on
the thirteen member Board of
Directors; these are elected by the
student body. The director of
Swopsi is also a voting member of
the Board of Directors, ex officio.

To object to the voluntary fee
referendum as "coercive" as was
done in yesterday's Daily is
indicative of a lack of historical
perspective. The original proposal
of Citizens' Advocates was a
voluntary fee assessment which
would be refunded by mail.
The sole effort required of a
student to obtain his refund
would have been to check off the
appropriate box on his
registration material. Then-ASSU
Financial Manager Tom Huseby
decided that this would be
inordinately expensive (23 cents
per refund) for Citizens'
Advocates and recommended to
the ASSU Senate that the present
system be instituted. The Senate,
approving of the innovative
"voluntary" nature of the
proposal, accepted Mr. Huseby's
recommendation. Accordingly,
Citizens' Advocates has complied
with that form of refund
structure, as did the Daily in
requesting its fee assessment last
spring.

The questions involved in the
referendum come down to the
following: Is Citizens' Advocates
at Stanford, Inc. a desirable
organization that should be
available to the interests of the
Stanford community? (The
answer to similar questions on
other campuses has been a
resounding "YES" â€”leading to
the establishment of thirty-three
Public Interest Research Groups
nationwide.) And is there enough
student interest to sustain such a
group? This is the more difficult
of the two questions.
Too often students have
supported projects until it was
time to "Give a Dollar." Should
control of "Public Interest"
groups remain exclusively in the
hands of large financial gods?
Vote "yes" for Citizens'
Advocates at Stanford. Without
the approval of Stanford students
it cannot survive.
