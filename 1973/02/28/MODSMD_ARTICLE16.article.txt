# 'That Championship Season' Opens
## 
### STU ALLEN 
"That Championship Season,"
introduced to ACT's repertory
last Tuesday, is drama's answer to
"All in the Family": the show is a
comic presentation of the
perversion to America's neurotic
love affair with status, success,
and the ego.
The show's resemblance to
television comedy is an invitation
to complacency on the part of the
audience, yet fine acting
performances drive the reality of
each character's strengths and
weaknesses home to the
audience's consciousness. The
result is an interesting play that
works on many levels.
The situation is the twentieth
reunion of the 1952 Pennsylvania
State Championship Basketball
Team at the home of its coach.
On one level the chief problem is
the upcoming mayoral race, and
whether Romano, a strip mine
owner, is going to lend critically
needed support to Sikowski, an
obvious incompetent; and
whether Sikowski is going to
accept that help once he learns
that Romano is balling Mrs.
Sikowski. As you might sense, the
chief problem on another level is
the failure of these men to create
new fulfillment in their lives as
the glow of that youthful success
died out.
Same Routine
Now that they are forty, they
face thirty more years of the same
flaccid routine they have known
for so long. Compounding their
gradual decline to emptiness is
that they have no experience
behind them to help them

comprehend and grow in the same
environment they have known all
their lives.
The main vehicle of this play is
the Coach. The men were "his,"
he says, and he developed them
into champions. Yet under his
control they never developed the
imagination to create meaning and
satisfaction for themselves. All of
them are slaves to the silver
trophy that is the largest
landmark of meaning in their

lives.
The characters are not
didactically uneven, however.
Tom, now an alcoholic, has built
his life around "cheap cynicism
and booze," but he is also the
only character to consistently
recognize and voice the truth
about himself and the others.
We learn from him, for
example, that the championship
itself is tainted with fraud, and
the all-important trophy with

deceit, when he explains how the
ribs of the opposing team's star
were shattered after the coach
gave the word to "get" him.
The situation of the play is
riddled with irony, and so
contemporary (the strip mine is
the key issue in the mayoral race),
that one is remSpded of the time
that Sammy Davis, Jr. dropped in
on Archie Bunker and made him
look like a racist.
This play has audience appeal,

it especially can draw from the
well-to-do, more liberal
theater-going populace. The
elements of its popularity—in
particular its frank treatment of
the failure of America's success
ethic—constitute the play's major
weakness, its capacity for
melodrama and for triteness.
The new ACT production
avoids the pitfall of triviality
because the acting is generally
outstanding. Dana Elcar, as the
coach, controls the show. He is
always shifting tactics, even
contradicting himself, but he is
still coercing the others, even
now, twenty years later. Mr. Elcar
appeared to have been born a
coach in the mold of Theodore
Roosevelt, and only his shedding
of the role in the curtain call and
in backstage congratulations
convinced this reviewer otherwise.
The others, Ray Reinhardt as
George Sikowski, Ramon Bieri as
Phil Romano, and Ed Flanders as
James Daley, handle their
subordinate roles with equal
aplomb. Only Paul Shenar as Tom
Daley, the alcoholic, weakens the
show with an exaggerated leer
that unbalances the more
carefully drawn characterizations
of the other four.
What is showing at the Geary
Theater is excellent ensemble
acting that makes "That
Championship Season" a most
believable, and most enjoyable
show. The lighting, the set, and
the costumes, by Fred Kopp,
Ralph Funicello, and J. Allen
High fill respectively, all
contribute to the atmosphere of
faded and irrelevant success.
