# Tolly's Follies
## TV Programming Ignores Reality 
### Don Tollefson 
Picture yourself behind the
wheel of a big black and white car
with a badge on your shirt and a
gun and a pair of handcuffs on
your belt. A known drug user
wanted for questioning in
connection with the shooting of a
policeman has just entered the
corner gym where he hangs out
with his cronies and other assorted
hoods.
The chances that any
intelligent person would go into
that gym alone in pursuit of the
suspect are slim. But if you're one
of "The Rookies," you not only
go into the gym alone, but you
walk right into an obvious trap
and proceed to get the crap
kicked out of you before your
partner finally arrives and saves
your skin.
Welcome to the world of the
television police show. A world
where the cop always gets his
man and always remembers to
advise him of his rights. A world
where police brutality is as rare as
a communist at an American
Legion meeting. A world where
the cop's badge is hidden under
his cape next to the big S.
If television isn't the total
fantasyland some critics claim it
is, you can't blame it on the
police shows. TV presents a
picture of criminal justice which is

almost as distorted as its picture
of sex. TV people never go to bed
and TV criminals very rarely get
away. Oh mommy, please read me
another fairy tale.
Influenced Perception
By some miracle, most
Americans seem to have
discovered that there is more to
sex than meets the TV-viewing
eye. Unfortunately, it seems that
many people haven't been
similarly educated in the realities
of criminal justice. Although we
all deny it, television undoubtedly
shapes our perception of reality to
some extent. Is it any wonder that
our criminal justice system
remains as unjust as it is when TV
cops can do no wrong?
For the past few weeks I've
watched a steady stream of TV
police shows. The list is endless
but among the programs I've
endured are "The Rookies," "The
Streets of San Francisco," "The
Mod Squad," "The FBI," "Hawaii
Five-O," "Mannix," "Barnaby
Jones," "Ironside" and "Adam
12." I've even watched a few
reruns of that oldie-goldie,
"Dragnet." I don't wish a similar
fate on my friends.
Admittedly the escape factor is
a necessary part of entertainment.
After a long day of fighting their
own problems and the world's

problems, most people don't want
a night filled with nothing but
"relevant" shows. But when
escapist, distorted shows
dominate to the almost exclusion
of reality, problems set in. Such is
the case with TV police shows.
I am not saying that all cops
are brutal sons-of-bitches who
love beating up people and
putting them away unfairly. I
know some policemen who are
concerned, idealistic people and I
respect them. But I also know
some who are overgrown babies
filled with sadism. And when the
latter type of cop is almost totally
missing from the TV screen,
everyone suffers.
Myth Breakdown
Hiding reality does not
eliminate it. It is time that
someone produced a TV show
about police that is frank and
truthful like the movie, "The New
Centurions." Such a show could
begin to break down some of the
myths television has created
which tend to perpetuate many of
the problems of our criminal
justice system.
Some of these shows are
entertaining. Last Thursday I
watched "The Mod Squad,"
"Ironside" and"The Streets of
San Francisco," and all three

shows were suspenseful and
enjoyable. Unfortunately none
were realistic.
On 'The Mod Squad," a police
captain's uncle steals a number of
his paintings from art galleries
because an unscrupulous dealer
has forged a famous painter's
signature to them for obvious
reasons. Despite his motives, such
acts still constitute grand theft,
but as you might expect, the guy
gets off without any penalty.
On "Ironside," a wealthy
author is almost murdered by a
greedy relative who the police had
ruled out as a "suspect" in
previous attempts. And on "The
Streets of San Francisco," a police
lieutenant enters a building by
himself in pursuit of a group of
murder suspects.
No Surprises
Needless to say, he is captured
by the murderers who hold him
hostage and try to negotiate a
trade for their jailed gang leader.
In case you couldn't figure it out,
the lieutenant's partner saves him
moments before he is executed.
Surprise, surprise.
"The FBI," "The Streets of
San Francisco" and "Barnaby
Jones" are all produced by the
same man, Quinn Martin, and
Martin should be commended for

the high level of acting and
suspense in these programs. But in
terms of reality, these shows
aren't much better than the rest.
If the FBI was as successful
against organized crime as it is on
the show, we'd be living in a much
safer society.
Maybe I'm being unrealistic.
Maybe people are getting the kind
of TV shows they want. We all
remember the Lowest Common
Denominator Theory of
television. I'm probably very
naive, but I still think that
television someday may become
the major educational force it
could be.
Even a few realistic police
shows might help educate people
about the problems of criminal
justice in this country. But Jack
Webb is still calling the shots, so I
won't hold my breath. 10-4 Sgt.
Friday. Over and out.
