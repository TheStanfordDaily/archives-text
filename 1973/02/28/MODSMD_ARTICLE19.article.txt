# Poetry Reading
## 
### KITTY PATTERSON 
Like all aspiring artists, writers can work all their lives without
being noticed. Shy authors hide their compositions in secret places.
Even outgoing authors may never read their work aloud if they don't
know where to read it.
A reading group introduces writers to other artists. It gives them a
chance to develop a style that sounds as good as it reads.
Mark Anderson, a Stanford senior in Creative Writing, recognized
the need aspiring writers have to interact with each other. With help
from the Chimaera Bookstore, he is setting up a reading group. The
first session will be this Saturday at 8 p.m.
All the writers will read their own works. Explains Anderson,
"Reading poetry and hearing read poetry is almost as important as
writing it. Sound is primogenital in it; poetry was originally meant to
be spoken. To ignore that is to ignore part of the power you have as a
poet."
Recognized Need
For a long time, Stanford overlooked the need for writers to read
as well as write. Last quarter, some one in the Creative Writing
Department finally recognized it. Anderson and Richard Price,
another student, initiated reading sessions on Thursday afternoons in
the Creative Writing Building.
The experiment worked. Students responded eagerly. "The
readings showed us," says Anderson, "that there were a lot of people
writing who just needed an outlet that hadn't been provided."
Feeling restricted under the eye of the Creative Writing
Department, Price and Anderson branched out. They convinced the
manager of the Chimaera Bookstore to let them hold a reading in the
store's poetry room.
Tight Fit
So many people showed up at the first reading that they could
barely fit in the room. Most of them were student writers not
affiliated with the Creative Writing Department.
When Price left Stanford this quarter, Anderson decided to set up a
program on his own at the Chimaera Bookstore. The store agreed to
provide its poetry room free every other Saturday night from eight
o'clock on.
Anderson describes the program as "geared to people who are
really dedicated to writing but who lack a sense of community with
other writers." Readers can establish contacts within a writers' circle;
listeners can learn "what's going on in poetry."
Flexible Format
The format of the program is flexible. Ideally, Anderson wants a
combination forum and show with audience feedback.
To read at the first session, he has contacted five locally known
writers. From then on, he has no one scheduled. He is hoping that
writers who want to read will contact him.
Among the authors scheduled to read next Saturday are two
Stanford students: Autumn Stanley and Anderson. Stanley is an
editor of Stonecloud and the Stanford Press. She plans to read some
of her prose. Anderson has published in Stonecloud and the Sequoia.
He has a book of poetry, Nineteen Fathers, coming out soon.
Anyone interested in reading his or her work in future sessions may
contact Anderson either through the Creative Writing Department or
the Chimaera Bookstore.

When Price left Stanford this quarter, Anderson decided to set up a
program on his own at the Chimaera Bookstore. The store agreed to
provide its poetry room free every other Saturday night from eight
o'clock on.
Anderson describes the program as "geared to people who are
really dedicated to writing but who lack a sense of community with
other writers." Readers can establish contacts within a writers' circle;
listeners can learn "what's going on in poetry."
Flexible Format
The format of the program is flexible. Ideally, Anderson wants a
combination forum and show with audience feedback.
To read at the first session, he has contacted five locally known
writers. From then on, he has no one scheduled. He is hoping that
writers who want to read will contact him.
Among the authors scheduled to read next Saturday are two
Stanford students: Autumn Stanley and Anderson. Stanley is an
editor of Stonecloud and the Stanford Press. She plans to read some
of her prose. Anderson has published in Stonecloud and the Sequoia.
He has a book of poetry, Nineteen Fathers, coming out soon.
Anyone interested in reading his or her work in future sessions may
contact Anderson either through the Creative Writing Department or
the Chimaera Bookstore.
Like all aspiring artists, writers can work all their lives without
being noticed. Shy authors hide their compositions in secret places.
Even outgoing authors may never read their work aloud if they don't
know where to read it.
A reading group introduces writers to other artists. It gives them a
chance to develop a style that sounds as good as it reads.
Mark Anderson, a Stanford senior in Creative Writing, recognized
the need aspiring writers have to interact with each other. With help
from the Chimaera Bookstore, he is setting up a reading group. The
first session will be this Saturday at 8 p.m.
All the writers will read their own works. Explains Anderson,
"Reading poetry and hearing read poetry is almost as important as
writing it. Sound is primogenital in it; poetry was originally meant to
be spoken. To ignore that is to ignore part of the power you have as a
poet."
Recognized Need
For a long time, Stanford overlooked the need for writers to read
as well as write. Last quarter, some one in the Creative Writing
Department finally recognized it. Anderson and Richard Price,
another student, initiated reading sessions on Thursday afternoons in
the Creative Writing Building.
The experiment worked. Students responded eagerly. "The
readings showed us," says Anderson, "that there were a lot of people
writing who just needed an outlet that hadn't been provided."
Feeling restricted under the eye of the Creative Writing
Department, Price and Anderson branched out. They convinced the
manager of the Chimaera Bookstore to let them hold a reading in the
store's poetry room.
Tight Fit
So many people showed up at the first reading that they could
barely fit in the room. Most of them were student writers not
affiliated with the Creative Writing Department.
