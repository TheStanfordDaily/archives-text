# Arguments Delay Opening Of Burts' Jury Selection
## 
### MARK SIMONIAN 
Arguments over pre-trial evidence
disclosure again delayed jury selection
in the murder-lynching trial of Benton
Douglas Burt and Andrea Holman Burt
in San Bernardino County Superior
Court yesterday.
The long-delayed trial probably will
not begin until Monday, according to a
court clerk. Jury selection had been
set to begin during today's court
session.
The clerk indicated that Judge
Joseph B. Campbell will hear evidence
motions for a "couple more days" and
that Campbell had made no significant
rulings yesterday.
Under California state law, both
defense and prosecution must disclose
their evidence to each other before the
trial officially commences.
Commenting on the delays in the
trial, defense attorney Charles Garry
stated, "The District Attorney is doing
everything in his power to stop us
from going to trial. It's just one sham
after another."
Garry accused District Attorney
Joseph Canty of using delaying tactics
to allow time for the prosecution to
join the Burts' trial with that of
former Venceremos members Jean
Hobson and Robert Seabock. The
defense attorney claimed that trying
all four defendants together would
prejudice his case for Benton and
Andrea Burt.
Last Friday afternoon, Campbell

for a fourth time denied Canty's
motion to reconsolidate the two
murder trials. An appelate court
yesterday upheld Campbell's decision.
All the defendants are charged with
murder and lynching (removal of a
prisoner from lawful custody) in
connection with the ambush escape
last Oct. 6 of Ronald Wayne Beaty, a
Chino State prison inmate who had
joined Venceremos.
Since his capture Dec. 11 with
Hobson, Beaty has given details of his
escape and has been denounced by
Venceremos. Seabock is the alleged
"trigger man" in the escape.
Medicine Prof. Halsted Holman,
Andrea Burt's father, called
yesterday's court action "another step
in a long series of delays and
harrassment."
He criticized the prosecution for
"making it necessary to argue and
make motions on virtually every
point" in the pre-trial procedure,
making it "exceedingly difficult to get
a speedy trial."
Holman said that his daughter and
son-in-law were in good spirits and
that they were looking forward to the
beginning of the trial.
"They have been anxious for some
time to have the trial begin," he said,
"especially since they have been
denied normal prison rights such as
talking to other prisoners." The Burts
have been held in maximum security
confinement without bail since early
last December.
