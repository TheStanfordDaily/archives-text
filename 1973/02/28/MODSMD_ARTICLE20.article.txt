# JV Cagers Host Santa Clara Tonight
## 
### MARK WHITE 
Coming off its best weekend of
the season, Stanford's junior
varsity basketball team goes after
its seventh victory in a row
tonight when the Cards play Santa
Clara in a 7 p.m. game at Maples
Pavilion.
Four weeks ago the Cards took
a 5-5 record to Santa Clara and
left with a 5-6 standing, losing a
close 65-70 game which coach Bill
Jones felt they should have won.
"Santa Clara showed us an

excellent man to man defense the
last time we played them,"
explained Jones, "and when they
were pressuring us, we rushed our
play and threw the ball away a
lot. We expect the same kind of
game tonight, but if we take care
of the ball, we should win."
Best Play
In fact, if the Cards come close
to duplicating last weekend's
performances, they should come
out on top. In the most one-sided
contest of the year, Stanford

demolished UC Santa Cruz 89-43
Friday night. The Cards came
back Saturday to smash a good
USF team, 113-90.
It was a combination of
Stanford's best defense and the
ineptness of Santa Cruz that
powered the Cards to victory
Friday. Jumping off to a quick
29-3 lead in the first nine minutes
of the game, the Cards used a full
court press to demoralize UCSC
to the point where they threw the
ball away six times in a row in the

middle of the first half.
Rich Wohlstadter twisted and
turned through the lane for a
game high 14 points and Ed
Schweitzer hit all six of his shots
for 12 points. Combining to hit
17 of 22 shots, Wohlstadter,
Schweitzer, and Kevin Enright led
Stanford to a 51-18 halftime
advantage before the subs
expanded that lead to the final
margin of 46 points.
Kherli Outstanding
The Cards had an even better
shooting performance Saturday
when the JV's hit an incredible 67
percent from the field to slay
USF. Mike Kherli led Stanford to
an early 18-5 lead by scoring six
points and when USF had reeled
off 15 straight points late in the
half to take their only lead of the
game at 31-30, Kherli poured in
nine more to give Stanford
control of the game and a 50-42
halftime advantage.
By consistently breaking USF's
full-court press Stanford drew out
to a 25 point lead in the second
half and coasted the last third of
the game to the 113-90 win.
Kherli and Enright had their best
games of the season, scoring 26
and 25 points respectively. The
Cardinal guards had good games
also, Wohlstadter accounting for
24 points and Steve Kristovitch
adding 18.
