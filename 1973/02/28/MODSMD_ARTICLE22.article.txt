Championships at Santa Monica
High School.
The Cards, list year's third
place finisher behind (JSC and
UCLA, will hope*to move by the
Bruins and capture second place
in this year's meet.
USC is the pre-meet favorite as
the Trojan's depth is unmatched
by any team in wie country with
the exception of Indiana.
Stanford, Washington
are all given a good shot at second
behind the Trojans.
"We think we can beat
Washington for sure, but we're
going to need some heavy
sprinting," explained assistant
coach Jeff Hammett. "There is
always the possibility of streaking

into second if everything goes
well."
Job Leads
Leading the Cardinals will be
senior Brian Job defending
champion in the 100 and 200
breastroke. Besides swimming his
breastroke events, Job will go the
butterfly leg on the 400 medley
relay.
Job will find his toughest
competition coming from
teammate John Hencken.
Hencken will battle Job in both
breastroke events, swim the
breastroke leg on the medley
relay, and swim the 200 individu.il
medley.
Most of Stanford's depth is in
the sprints where Hammett hopes
to place as many as four
swimmers in the 50 free and three
in the 100 free.
Hammett is counting on Dean
Anderson, Martin Pedley, Steve
Carey, and frosh sensation Bruce
Goodwin to make the sprint
finals as well as Anderson, Pedley,
and Goodwin sparking the 400
free relay.
Anderson Tough
"Somebody is going to really
have to go to beat Anderson in
the 50 and 100," states Hammett
in discussing the talents of the
junior sprinter. Anderson will also
anchor the 400 medley relay.
Terry Sutton is Stanford's top
hope in the 500 and 1650
freestyles, as well as the lone hope
in the 200 fly. Sutton's work is

cut-out for him in the 1650 as he
will face four USC swimmers in
his heat of the event.
Backing up Sutton in the
distance events are Richard Cook,
Steve Strong, Paul Chirk, and Ron
Longinotti in the 500 free. In the
1650 it will be Strong, Clark and
Longinotti.
"Whether or not we are able to
take second place will depend a
lot on the distance swimmers,"
states Hammett.

defending champion in the 200
backstroke, will try to make it

two in a row in year's meet, as
well as score points in the 100
back.

Hammett is counting on Dean
Anderson, Martin Pedley, Steve
Carey, and frosh sensation Bruce
Goodwin to make the sprint
finals as well as Anderson, Pedley,
