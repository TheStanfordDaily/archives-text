Court Attacks Segregation
WASHINGTON — Hitting at segregation in private
recreation facilities, the Supreme Court yesterday denied
a whites-only policy to a suburban swim club that gave
preferred status to nearby residents.
The unanimous decision expanded a 1969 ruling that a
black family that buys or rents a home in a subdivision
must be allowed to use recreational facilities that come
with the property.
Membership in the Wheaton-Haven Recreation
Association — subject of yesterday's ruling — was not
automatically conferred upon neighborhood residents but,
the court noted, residents within a three-quarter mile
radius were given preference in membership and this
conveyed a valuable property right to whites that was
denied blacks.
The association's swimming pool is located in
well-to-do Montgomery County, Md., a suburb of
Washington. Dr. Henry C. Press, a radiologist at Howard
University Medical School here, and his wife were denied
membership because of their race even though they lived
within the preference area.
Also, in 1968, a white couple with membership in the
association, Mr. and Mrs. Murray Tillman, was prevented
from bringing a Negro guest, Mrs. Grace Rosner, to the
pool.
They joined in a suit against the association seeking a
total of $30,000 in damages. The status of their attack on
the guest policy of the association remains less clear than
that of the membership.
U.N. To Probe Airline Downing
UNITED NATIONS, N.Y. — The U.N. aviation agency
agreed yesterday to look into Israel's shooting down of a
Libyan airliner last week, and Arab delegates proposed a
resolution condemning Israeli action in the tragedy.
Egypt's call for a debate won quick agreement at the
opening session of a four-day assembly of the
International Civil Aviation Organization.
One hundred and six persons perished when the jetliner
was downed by Israeli warplanes Feb. 21 in the occupied
Sinai Desert.
Arab delegates circulated a draft resolution in which
the worldwide air traffic agency would condemn Israel for
the shooting and at the same time order an immediate
fact-finding investigation.
Israel agreed to a "calm and sober" investigation. But
controversy was expected over condemnation of Israel
when the issue is debated today.
The United States and several other Western countries
were trying to temper the wording on condemnation to
avoid further aggravating the Middle East conflict. But
countries critical of Israel have a commanding majority in
the assembly.
Officials said 110 of the agency's 125 member nations
were participating in the assembly.
Investigation rather than condemnation was stressed in
a decision on the crash by another organization, the
International Federation of Airline Pilots Associations.
The London-based group asked the U.N. agency to make
an impartial investigation aimed at recommending ways to
avert future disasters.
In Jerusalem, Foreign Minister Abba Eban of Israel said
the pilot group had adopted "a constructive
resolution . . . with no hostile implications for Israel."
Eban told Israel's parliament that foreign comment and
editorials, initially hostile toward Israel, were turning
toward proposals to prevent similar incidents. He said
Israel still hopes Arab governments will agree on
establishing a "hot line" with Israel, a proposal Egypt has
rejected.

Democrats Criticize Nixon Budget
WASHINGTON — Showing more harmony than they have
enjoyed in years, Democratic governors and senators
yesterday accused President Nixon of destroying his own
revenue-sharing program and state and local budgets.
Georgia Gov. Jimmy Carter disclosed his state is
considering a Supreme Court challenge to Nixon's
impoundment of federal funds intended for state and
local projects.
Sen. Walter F. Mondale (D-Minn.), testifying before the
Senate Intergovernmental Relations subcommittee,
suggested that Congress respond with a
counter-impoundment of the money Nixon does want to
spend.
"If they won't obey the law for the farm programs,"
Mondale said, "then I think we ought to impound the
money for the Defense Department."
The President has impounded more than $8 billion
appropriated by Congress for assistance to the states for
social programs. He is holding up — by refusing to use
contract authority — another $6 billion.
Democrats were virtually unanimous in their objection
to the loss of federal grant money to the quickness with
which it is being cut off in testimony before the
subcommittee.
"What you've built up over forty years, you're
expecting us to pick up in four months," said Kentucky
Gov. Wendell Ford.
The governors complained that the withdrawal of
federal money is going to make it difficult to meet their
own state budgets and will force rises in state taxes.
Ford said the President's argument that his budget
seeks to avoid a tax increase is "perhaps the most
deceptive of the states objectives of a proposed budget."
Ford said Nixon "is shifting the federal deficit to states
while increasing the costs of states to subsidize the rest of
his budget."

Israel still hopes Arab governments will agree on

Democrats Criticize Nixon Budget
WASHINGTON — Showing more harmony than they have
enjoyed in years, Democratic governors and senators
yesterday accused President Nixon of destroying his own
revenue-sharing program and state and local budgets.
Georgia Gov. Jimmy Carter disclosed his state is
considering a Supreme Court challenge to Nixon's
impoundment of federal funds intended for state and
local projects.
Sen. Walter F. Mondale (D-Minn.), testifying before the
Senate Intergovernmental Relations subcommittee,
suggested that Congress respond with a
counter-impoundment of the money Nixon does want to
spend.
"If they won't obey the law for the farm programs,"
Mondale said, "then I think we ought to impound the
money for the Defense Department."
The President has impounded more than $8 billion
appropriated by Congress for assistance to the states for
social programs. He is holding up — by refusing to use
contract authority — another $6 billion.
Democrats were virtually unanimous in their objection
to the loss of federal grant money to the quickness with
which it is being cut off in testimony before the
subcommittee.
"What you've built up over forty years, you're
expecting us to pick up in four months," said Kentucky
Gov. Wendell Ford.
The governors complained that the withdrawal of
federal money is going to make it difficult to meet their
own state budgets and will force rises in state taxes.
Ford said the President's argument that his budget
seeks to avoid a tax increase is "perhaps the most
deceptive of the states objectives of a proposed budget."
Ford said Nixon "is shifting the federal deficit to states
while increasing the costs of states to subsidize the rest of
his budget."
Today's Weather
Partly cloudy this afternoon through tomorrow. Cooler
tonight. Low tonight in 40s. High today and tomorrow in
mid 50s to low 60s. Chance of
rain 60 percent today.
Court Attacks Segregation
WASHINGTON — Hitting at segregation in private
recreation facilities, the Supreme Court yesterday denied
a whites-only policy to a suburban swim club that gave
preferred status to nearby residents.
The unanimous decision expanded a 1969 ruling that a
black family that buys or rents a home in a subdivision
must be allowed to use recreational facilities that come
with the property.
Membership in the Wheaton-Haven Recreation
Association — subject of yesterday's ruling — was not
automatically conferred upon neighborhood residents but,
the court noted, residents within a three-quarter mile
radius were given preference in membership and this
conveyed a valuable property right to whites that was
denied blacks.
The association's swimming pool is located in
well-to-do Montgomery County, Md., a suburb of
Washington. Dr. Henry C. Press, a radiologist at Howard
University Medical School here, and his wife were denied
membership because of their race even though they lived
within the preference area.
Also, in 1968, a white couple with membership in the
association, Mr. and Mrs. Murray Tillman, was prevented
from bringing a Negro guest, Mrs. Grace Rosner, to the
pool.
They joined in a suit against the association seeking a
total of $30,000 in damages. The status of their attack on
the guest policy of the association remains less clear than
that of the membership.
U.N. To Probe Airline Downing
UNITED NATIONS, N.Y. — The U.N. aviation agency
agreed yesterday to look into Israel's shooting down of a
Libyan airliner last week, and Arab delegates proposed a
resolution condemning Israeli action in the tragedy.
Egypt's call for a debate won quick agreement at the
opening session of a four-day assembly of the
International Civil Aviation Organization.
One hundred and six persons perished when the jetliner
was downed by Israeli warplanes Feb. 21 in the occupied
Sinai Desert.
Arab delegates circulated a draft resolution in which
the worldwide air traffic agency would condemn Israel for
the shooting and at the same time order an immediate
fact-finding investigation.
Israel agreed to a "calm and sober" investigation. But
controversy was expected over condemnation of Israel
when the issue is debated today.
The United States and several other Western countries
were trying to temper the wording on condemnation to
avoid further aggravating the Middle East conflict. But
countries critical of Israel have a commanding majority in
the assembly.
Officials said 110 of the agency's 125 member nations
were participating in the assembly.
Investigation rather than condemnation was stressed in
a decision on the crash by another organization, the
International Federation of Airline Pilots Associations.
The London-based group asked the U.N. agency to make
an impartial investigation aimed at recommending ways to
avert future disasters.
In Jerusalem, Foreign Minister Abba Eban of Israel said
the pilot group had adopted "a constructive
resolution . . . with no hostile implications for Israel."
Eban told Israel's parliament that foreign comment and
editorials, initially hostile toward Israel, were turning
toward proposals to prevent similar incidents. He said

Washington. Dr. Henry C. Press, a radiologist at Howard
University Medical School here, and his wife were denied
membership because of their race even though they lived
within the preference area.
Also, in 1968, a white couple with membership in the
association, Mr. and Mrs. Murray Tillman, was prevented
from bringing a Negro guest, Mrs. Grace Rosner, to the
pool.
They joined in a suit against the association seeking a
total of $30,000 in damages. The status of their attack on
the guest policy of the association remains less clear than
that of the membership.
U.N. To Probe Airline Downing
UNITED NATIONS, N.Y. — The U.N. aviation agency
agreed yesterday to look into Israel's shooting down of a
Libyan airliner last week, and Arab delegates proposed a
resolution condemning Israeli action in the tragedy.
Egypt's call for a debate won quick agreement at the
opening session of a four-day assembly of the
International Civil Aviation Organization.
One hundred and six persons perished when the jetliner
was downed by Israeli warplanes Feb. 21 in the occupied
Sinai Desert.
Arab delegates circulated a draft resolution in which
the worldwide air traffic agency would condemn Israel for
the shooting and at the same time order an immediate
fact-finding investigation.
Israel agreed to a "calm and sober" investigation. But
controversy was expected over condemnation of Israel
when the issue is debated today.
The United States and several other Western countries
were trying to temper the wording on condemnation to
avoid further aggravating the Middle East conflict. But
countries critical of Israel have a commanding majority in
the assembly.
Officials said 110 of the agency's 125 member nations
were participating in the assembly.
Investigation rather than condemnation was stressed in
a decision on the crash by another organization, the
International Federation of Airline Pilots Associations.
The London-based group asked the U.N. agency to make
an impartial investigation aimed at recommending ways to
avert future disasters.
In Jerusalem, Foreign Minister Abba Eban of Israel said
the pilot group had adopted "a constructive
resolution . . . with no hostile implications for Israel."
Eban told Israel's parliament that foreign comment and
editorials, initially hostile toward Israel, were turning
toward proposals to prevent similar incidents. He said
Israel still hopes Arab governments will agree on
establishing a "hot line" with Israel, a proposal Egypt has
rejected.

Democrats Criticize Nixon Budget
WASHINGTON — Showing more harmony than they have
enjoyed in years, Democratic governors and senators
yesterday accused President Nixon of destroying his own
revenue-sharing program and state and local budgets.
Georgia Gov. Jimmy Carter disclosed his state is
considering a Supreme Court challenge to Nixon's
impoundment of federal funds intended for state and
local projects.
Sen. Walter F. Mondale (D-Minn.), testifying before the
Senate Intergovernmental Relations subcommittee,
suggested that Congress respond with a
counter-impoundment of the money Nixon does want to
spend.
"If they won't obey the law for the farm programs,"
Mondale said, "then I think we ought to impound the
money for the Defense Department."
The President has impounded more than $8 billion
appropriated by Congress for assistance to the states for
social programs. He is holding up — by refusing to use
contract authority — another $6 billion.
Democrats were virtually unanimous in their objection
to the loss of federal grant money to the quickness with
which it is being cut off in testimony before the
subcommittee.
"What you've built up over forty years, you're
expecting us to pick up in four months," said Kentucky
Gov. Wendell Ford.
The governors complained that the withdrawal of
federal money is going to make it difficult to meet their
own state budgets and will force rises in state taxes.
Ford said the President's argument that his budget
seeks to avoid a tax increase is "perhaps the most
deceptive of the states objectives of a proposed budget."
Ford said Nixon "is shifting the federal deficit to states
while increasing the costs of states to subsidize the rest of
his budget."
