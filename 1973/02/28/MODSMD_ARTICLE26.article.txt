# Banking Project Seeks ASSU Support
## 
### 
The director of the Alternative
Banking Project (ABP), a group
comprised of students from six Bay
Area universities, last night asked the
student Senate to commit ASSU funds
to a "socially responsible" bank
chosen by the ABP.
The Senate referred the proposal to
the Finance Committee, which will
recommend a course of action at the
first Senate meeting of spring quarter.
If the proposal is accepted,
Stanford would join other schools in
pooling funds for deposit in a bank
that has "socially responsible" banking
policies.

In other business, Finance
Committee Chairman Frank Brokaw
announced that 16 budgets have come
in to the committee for funding
consideration under the proposed
Program fee.
The deadline for submitting
budgets has been extended to this
Friday because about eight more
groups are needed before a Program
fee assessment can be placed on the
April ballot. Because each group gets a
percentage of the assessment, each
would get too much money if there
were only sixteen groups sharing the
assessment, according to Student

Financial Manager Sara Moore.
Moore said that more groups should
take advantage of the Program fee
because that would cut down on the
number of special fee assessments for
individual groups.
In a report to the Senate, a
spokesman for the ASSU Travel
Service discussed two current projects,
a travel guide and a service to book car
purchase, lease and rental in Europe
for the Stanford community.
According to Russ McAusland,
ASSU Travel Service manager, the
travel guide will be unique because it
will be a calendar of events rather than
just a guide to restaurants and hotels.
