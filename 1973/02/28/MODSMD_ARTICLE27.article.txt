# North County Official Wants University Police Deputized
## 
### ROBERT BACON 
"I certainly don't get involved in
the day-to-day business of Stanford.
But when they need county services, I
hear from them."
Victor J. Calvo represents the north
county, including Stanford, on the
Santa Clara County Board of
Supervisors, but most campus
residents probably don't know it —
despite the fact that it is the county
and not the city of Palo Alto which
has jurisdiction over the central
campus.
Discussing north county issues with
the Daily last week, he noted that
whereas Palo Alto and Stanford are
next-door neighbors, "the county
offices are 15 miles away — but
they're as close as any phone."
San Jose
Calvo's principal office is in San
Jose, where the five-member Board of
Supervisors transacts its business. He —
or an aide— occupies his small office in
the North County Office Building in
Palo Alto only on Fridays.
He conceded that "the only time
there's constant awareness of county
government on the campus is when
there's a disturbance and Sheriff's
deputies are there in force."
Discussing law enforcement at
Stanford, Calvo expressed hope and
confidence that University
Department of Public Safety officers
would soon be deputized.
Home Rule
"It would give Stanford greater
control. It provides for more home
rule. There's less dependency on an
outside force having to move in. A
local force is better able to handle"
most situations, he explained.
Calvo listed civil disorders as one of
the circumstances in which he
maintains contact with University
administrators "in determining how
best to proceed."
He was among the county officials
to whom Stanford officials expressed
concern over the location of the
Angela Davis trial last year. Davis was
incarcerated for three months in Palo
Alto, and there was speculation that
she would be tried there.
University administrators made
known their concern that the trial
might make Stanford a rallying point
for Davis' supporters. For this and
other reasons the trial was held in San
Jose.
Low-Income Housing
Turning to other issues, Calvo, a
member of the Stanford-Midpeninsula
Urban Coalition and a University
alumnus, praised Stanford for its
initiatives in providing
low/moderate-income housing.
However, he explained, intensive
urban development — industrial,
commercial, or residential — must be
carried on within city limits; hence
considerations relating to Stanford
land development are primarily city
and not county matters.
All developed University lands
except the academic campus and
student and faculty housing are
annexed to adjoining cities.
Frenchman's Terrace
Therefore, Calvo said, he was not
involved in the search for funding for
the proposed Frenchman's Terrace
low/moderate-income housing project,
Stanford's only effort to date in
mixed-income housing. That project is
now shelved due to a moratorium on
federal housing funds.

"The county isn't directly involved
in Stanford land use planning," Calvo
said, "but we encourage less dense use
and retention of open space wherever
we can."
He stressed his support of the
newly-created Midpeninsula Regional
Park District, but pointed out that
"they are underfunded, and they are
basically just an acquisition and
holding district. They must be
cautious at first."
The District was established at the
November 1972 election to help
preserve open space in the foothills
between Stanford and Los Gatos south
of San Jose.
Transit District
Calvo serves as Chairman of the
new Santa Clara County Transit
District, which took over operation of
the Palo Alto city bus system last
month.
Asked about the prospects for
improved or expanded bus service in
the Palo Alto-Stanford community,
and a transit system connecting the
north county with San Jose, he
outlined problems of inter-community
coordination.

"We'll be wrestling with political
questions over the next three months
— deciding how many buses and what
kind of interconnecting system we will
have.
"For the time being, service will
continue at the same levels as before in
Palo Alto and San Jose, which were
the only cities in the county with bus
lines," he said.
Sales-Tax Revenue
The transit district will receive
between $7.5 million and $8 million
per year in state sales tax revenues.
One-quarter cent of the five-cent sales
tax is earmarked for transit, he
explained.
"We're setting aside some money
for planning and to match federal
grants. The whole $8 million won't go
for bus service."
Transit, open space, housing, police
— despite the fact that he deals with
these most important Midpeninsula
political issues, and that he represents
the campus in the agency that has
primary jurisdiction over Stanford,
Victor J. Calvo remains largely
unknown on the campus — apparently
by choice.

for Davis' supporters. For this and
other reasons the trial was held in San
Jose.
Low-Income Housing
Turning to other issues, Calvo, a
member of the Stanford-Midpeninsula
Urban Coalition and a University
alumnus, praised Stanford for its
initiatives in providing
low/moderate-income housing.
However, he explained, intensive
urban development — industrial,
commercial, or residential — must be
carried on within city limits; hence
considerations relating to Stanford
land development are primarily city
and not county matters.
All developed University lands
except the academic campus and
student and faculty housing are
annexed to adjoining cities.
Frenchman's Terrace
Therefore, Calvo said, he was not
involved in the search for funding for
the proposed Frenchman's Terrace
low/moderate-income housing project,
Stanford's only effort to date in
mixed-income housing. That project is
now shelved due to a moratorium on
federal housing funds.

"The county isn't directly involved
in Stanford land use planning," Calvo
said, "but we encourage less dense use
and retention of open space wherever
we can."
He stressed his support of the
newly-created Midpeninsula Regional
Park District, but pointed out that
"they are underfunded, and they are
basically just an acquisition and
holding district. They must be
cautious at first."
The District was established at the
November 1972 election to help
preserve open space in the foothills
between Stanford and Los Gatos south
of San Jose.
Transit District
Calvo serves as Chairman of the
new Santa Clara County Transit
District, which took over operation of
the Palo Alto city bus system last
month.
Asked about the prospects for
improved or expanded bus service in
the Palo Alto-Stanford community,
and a transit system connecting the
north county with San Jose, he
outlined problems of inter-community
coordination.

"We'll be wrestling with political
questions over the next three months
— deciding how many buses and what
kind of interconnecting system we will
have.
"For the time being, service will
continue at the same levels as before in
Palo Alto and San Jose, which were
the only cities in the county with bus
lines," he said.
Sales-Tax Revenue
The transit district will receive
between $7.5 million and $8 million
per year in state sales tax revenues.
One-quarter cent of the five-cent sales
tax is earmarked for transit, he
explained.
"We're setting aside some money
for planning and to match federal
grants. The whole $8 million won't go
for bus service."
Transit, open space, housing, police
— despite the fact that he deals with
these most important Midpeninsula
political issues, and that he represents
the campus in the agency that has
primary jurisdiction over Stanford,
Victor J. Calvo remains largely
unknown on the campus — apparently
by choice.

CAMPUS REPRESENTATIVE — Santa Clara County means more to Stanford
than Sheriff's deputies. Victor J. Calvo represents the campus on the County
Board of Supervisors, which has legal jurisdiction over Stanford's central
campus.
"I certainly don't get involved in
the day-to-day business of Stanford.
But when they need county services, I
hear from them."
Victor J. Calvo represents the north
county, including Stanford, on the
Santa Clara County Board of
Supervisors, but most campus
residents probably don't know it —
despite the fact that it is the county
and not the city of Palo Alto which
has jurisdiction over the central
campus.
Discussing north county issues with
the Daily last week, he noted that
whereas Palo Alto and Stanford are
next-door neighbors, "the county
offices are 15 miles away — but
they're as close as any phone."
San Jose
Calvo's principal office is in San
Jose, where the five-member Board of
Supervisors transacts its business. He —
or an aide— occupies his small office in
the North County Office Building in
Palo Alto only on Fridays.
He conceded that "the only time
there's constant awareness of county
government on the campus is when
there's a disturbance and Sheriff's
deputies are there in force."
Discussing law enforcement at
Stanford, Calvo expressed hope and
confidence that University
Department of Public Safety officers
would soon be deputized.
Home Rule
"It would give Stanford greater
control. It provides for more home
rule. There's less dependency on an
outside force having to move in. A
local force is better able to handle"
most situations, he explained.
Calvo listed civil disorders as one of
the circumstances in which he
maintains contact with University
administrators "in determining how
best to proceed."
He was among the county officials
to whom Stanford officials expressed
concern over the location of the
Angela Davis trial last year. Davis was
incarcerated for three months in Palo
Alto, and there was speculation that
she would be tried there.
University administrators made
known their concern that the trial
might make Stanford a rallying point
for Davis' supporters. For this and

— deciding how many buses and what
kind of interconnecting system we will
have.
"For the time being, service will
continue at the same levels as before in
Palo Alto and San Jose, which were
the only cities in the county with bus
lines," he said.
Sales-Tax Revenue
The transit district will receive
between $7.5 million and $8 million
per year in state sales tax revenues.
One-quarter cent of the five-cent sales
tax is earmarked for transit, he
explained.
"We're setting aside some money
for planning and to match federal
grants. The whole $8 million won't go
for bus service."
Transit, open space, housing, police
— despite the fact that he deals with
these most important Midpeninsula
political issues, and that he represents
the campus in the agency that has
primary jurisdiction over Stanford,
Victor J. Calvo remains largely
unknown on the campus — apparently
by choice.

CAMPUS REPRESENTATIVE — Santa Clara County means more to Stanford
than Sheriff's deputies. Victor J. Calvo represents the campus on the County
Board of Supervisors, which has legal jurisdiction over Stanford's central
campus.
"I certainly don't get involved in
the day-to-day business of Stanford.
But when they need county services, I
hear from them."
Victor J. Calvo represents the north
county, including Stanford, on the
Santa Clara County Board of
Supervisors, but most campus
residents probably don't know it —
despite the fact that it is the county
and not the city of Palo Alto which
has jurisdiction over the central
campus.
Discussing north county issues with
the Daily last week, he noted that
whereas Palo Alto and Stanford are
next-door neighbors, "the county
offices are 15 miles away — but
they're as close as any phone."
San Jose
Calvo's principal office is in San
Jose, where the five-member Board of
Supervisors transacts its business. He —
or an aide— occupies his small office in
the North County Office Building in
Palo Alto only on Fridays.
He conceded that "the only time
there's constant awareness of county
government on the campus is when
there's a disturbance and Sheriff's
deputies are there in force."
Discussing law enforcement at
Stanford, Calvo expressed hope and
confidence that University
Department of Public Safety officers
would soon be deputized.
Home Rule
"It would give Stanford greater
control. It provides for more home
rule. There's less dependency on an
outside force having to move in. A
local force is better able to handle"
most situations, he explained.
Calvo listed civil disorders as one of
the circumstances in which he
maintains contact with University
administrators "in determining how
best to proceed."
He was among the county officials
to whom Stanford officials expressed
concern over the location of the
Angela Davis trial last year. Davis was
incarcerated for three months in Palo
Alto, and there was speculation that
she would be tried there.
University administrators made
known their concern that the trial
might make Stanford a rallying point
for Davis' supporters. For this and
other reasons the trial was held in San
Jose.
Low-Income Housing
Turning to other issues, Calvo, a
member of the Stanford-Midpeninsula
Urban Coalition and a University
alumnus, praised Stanford for its
initiatives in providing
low/moderate-income housing.
However, he explained, intensive
urban development — industrial,
commercial, or residential — must be
carried on within city limits; hence
considerations relating to Stanford
land development are primarily city
and not county matters.
All developed University lands
except the academic campus and
student and faculty housing are
annexed to adjoining cities.
Frenchman's Terrace
Therefore, Calvo said, he was not
involved in the search for funding for
the proposed Frenchman's Terrace
low/moderate-income housing project,
Stanford's only effort to date in
mixed-income housing. That project is
now shelved due to a moratorium on
federal housing funds.

"The county isn't directly involved
in Stanford land use planning," Calvo
said, "but we encourage less dense use
and retention of open space wherever
we can."
He stressed his support of the
newly-created Midpeninsula Regional
Park District, but pointed out that
"they are underfunded, and they are
basically just an acquisition and
holding district. They must be
cautious at first."
The District was established at the
November 1972 election to help
preserve open space in the foothills
between Stanford and Los Gatos south
of San Jose.
Transit District
Calvo serves as Chairman of the
new Santa Clara County Transit
District, which took over operation of
the Palo Alto city bus system last
month.
Asked about the prospects for
improved or expanded bus service in
the Palo Alto-Stanford community,
and a transit system connecting the
north county with San Jose, he
outlined problems of inter-community
coordination.

"We'll be wrestling with political
questions over the next three months
— deciding how many buses and what
kind of interconnecting system we will
have.
"For the time being, service will
continue at the same levels as before in
Palo Alto and San Jose, which were
the only cities in the county with bus
lines," he said.

The transit district will receive
between $7.5 million and $8 million
per year in state sales tax revenues.

explained.
