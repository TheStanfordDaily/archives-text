# First Witness Testifies
## Ellsberg-Russo Defense Begins 
### ED KOHN 
Special to the Daily
LOS ANGELES — The defense in the
"Pentagon Papers" case began its
presentation yesterday by covering
much of the same material introduced
by prosecution witnesses at the
opening of the trial six weeks ago.
The first defense witness, retired
Navy Rear Adm. Gene Laßocque,
testified that the release of the
top-secret "Wheeler Report" did not
harm the national interest nor would it
have been of advantage to a foreign
nation.
The "Wheeler Report" is a post-Tet
offensive assessment of allied military
operations in Vietnam. Defendants
Daniel Ellsberg and Anthony J. Russo
Jr. are charged with duplicating and
leaking eight pages of the "Wheeler
Report" as well as 18 other documents

to the press.
On Jan. 18, Army Lt. Gen. William
DePuy, a prosecution witness, testified
that the release of the "Wheeler
Report" "proved useful" to North
Vietnam in planning its April, 1972
offensive.
DePuy, one of the authors of the
report, told the court that "this might
be the best piece of information they
[the North Vietnamese] ever had." He
said that releasing the report is "telling
the North Vietnamese what action
they could take that would be the
most damaging to the American army
and its allies."
Laßocque testified yesterday that
most of the material in the report
"could have been put together by the
North Vietnamese from reports by
their field commanders" except for
Gen. William C. Westmoreland's
request for an additional 206,000
troops.
Troop Request Figure
The troop request figure, Laßocque
testified, surfaced in a New York
Times article published Mar. 9, 1968,
less than three weeks after the
"Wheeler Report" was completed.
Laßocque, who is now the director
of the Center for Defense Information,
a private group that studies the
Defense Department, termed the
information in the "Wheeler Report"
"very temporary.
"The situation was very fluid," he
said.
Department Analyst
Laßocque, who served as a Defense
Department strategic analyst for seven
years, retired Apr. 1, 1972 after 31
years' service.
Prior to Laßocque's testimony, the
government rested its case after calling
10 witnesses in 21 days and defense
attorney Leonard Weinglass made a
short opening statement on behalf of
Russo.
The government's final witness,
retired FBI fingerprint analyst Deemer
E. Hippensteel, testified that he
located 10 fingerprints on eight pages
of one volume of the "Papers" that he
said were those of Vu Van Thai,
former South Vietnamese ambassador
to the United States.
No Dispute
The defense did not dispute his
finding.
Weinglass, who did not make an
opening statement at the start of the
trial, told the jurors that neither
defendant violated or conspired to
violate Federal law.
"Our case will be that no violation
of Federal law occurred," Weinglass
told the jurors. He said that the
"Papers" were copied so that they

could be given to Congress.
"We will show that the government
is bending the law ... to cover acts
that the government does not approve
of.
"We intend to call before this jury
the largest assemblage of experts that
have ever been called by a defense in
the history of the United States to
explain to a jury the meaning of the
words 'national defense' and how
information that was generated by the
government was not a military secret
but a hidden history."

"Papers" were copied so that they

could be given to Congress.
"We will show that the government
is bending the law ... to cover acts
that the government does not approve
of.
"We intend to call before this jury
the largest assemblage of experts that
have ever been called by a defense in
the history of the United States to
explain to a jury the meaning of the
words 'national defense' and how
information that was generated by the
government was not a military secret
but a hidden history."
Special to the Daily
LOS ANGELES — The defense in the
"Pentagon Papers" case began its
presentation yesterday by covering
much of the same material introduced
by prosecution witnesses at the
opening of the trial six weeks ago.
The first defense witness, retired
Navy Rear Adm. Gene Laßocque,
testified that the release of the
top-secret "Wheeler Report" did not
harm the national interest nor would it
have been of advantage to a foreign
nation.
The "Wheeler Report" is a post-Tet
offensive assessment of allied military
operations in Vietnam. Defendants
Daniel Ellsberg and Anthony J. Russo
Jr. are charged with duplicating and
leaking eight pages of the "Wheeler
Report" as well as 18 other documents

to the press.
On Jan. 18, Army Lt. Gen. William
DePuy, a prosecution witness, testified
that the release of the "Wheeler
Report" "proved useful" to North
Vietnam in planning its April, 1972
offensive.
DePuy, one of the authors of the
report, told the court that "this might
be the best piece of information they
[the North Vietnamese] ever had." He
said that releasing the report is "telling
the North Vietnamese what action
they could take that would be the
most damaging to the American army
and its allies."
Laßocque testified yesterday that
most of the material in the report
"could have been put together by the
North Vietnamese from reports by
their field commanders" except for
Gen. William C. Westmoreland's
request for an additional 206,000
troops.
Troop Request Figure
The troop request figure, Laßocque
testified, surfaced in a New York
Times article published Mar. 9, 1968,
less than three weeks after the
"Wheeler Report" was completed.
Laßocque, who is now the director
of the Center for Defense Information,
a private group that studies the
Defense Department, termed the
information in the "Wheeler Report"
"very temporary.
"The situation was very fluid," he
said.
Department Analyst
Laßocque, who served as a Defense
Department strategic analyst for seven
years, retired Apr. 1, 1972 after 31
years' service.
Prior to Laßocque's testimony, the
government rested its case after calling
10 witnesses in 21 days and defense
attorney Leonard Weinglass made a
short opening statement on behalf of
Russo.
The government's final witness,
retired FBI fingerprint analyst Deemer
E. Hippensteel, testified that he
located 10 fingerprints on eight pages
of one volume of the "Papers" that he
said were those of Vu Van Thai,
former South Vietnamese ambassador
to the United States.
No Dispute
The defense did not dispute his
finding.
Weinglass, who did not make an
opening statement at the start of the
trial, told the jurors that neither
defendant violated or conspired to
violate Federal law.
"Our case will be that no violation
of Federal law occurred," Weinglass
told the jurors. He said that the
"Papers" were copied so that they

could be given to Congress.
"We will show that the government
is bending the law ... to cover acts
that the government does not approve
of.
