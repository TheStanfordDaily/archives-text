# U.S. Slows Viet Troop Withdrawal Following Hall In POW Releases
## 
### 
From the Associated Press
The United States slowed down the
withdrawal of its remaining forces
from Vietnam today and may halt it
altogether unless North Vietnam
resumes the release of American
prisoners of war, high-ranking U.S.
authorities reported.
The source said no troop flights left
Vietnam today (local time), as they
have every day since the cease-fire
began Jan. 28. The United States has
been withdrawing about 400 troops a
day.
The U.S. Command in Saigon
would neither confirm nor deny the
report.
Meanwhile, in Paris, disputes over
North Vietnam's halt in the release of
American war prisoners imperiled the
international Vietnam peace

conference yesterday. Secretary of
State William P. Rogers suspended all
his conference activities.
The disputes broke out after a
morning in which the United States
and Hanoi reported they had reached
agreement on one important aspect of
the 13-party meeting here to seal the
Vietnam peace agreements signed a
month ago.
At the same time the work of
conference drafting experts also came
to a halt because of a refusal of
Communist delegates to sit down with
representatives of the United Nations.
These developments came as North
Vietnam and the United States traded
bitter charges over breaches of the
uneasy cease-fire deal signed in Paris
on Jan. 27.
Meeting Sought
Rogers sought an urgent meeting
with Foreign Minister Nguyen Duy
Trinh of North Vietnam in order to
have the intentions of the Hanoi
government clarified over the prisoner
release program.
Rogers was under President Nixon's
orders to shelve all other conference
business until the issue is resolved with
Trinh.
In Saigon earlier the North
Vietnamese and Viet Cong authorities
on the Joint Military Commission
announced their governments' decision
to quit freeing the prisoners.
At once this injected an atmosphere
of concern, if not of crisis, into the
conference proceedings here.
U.S. Presses Demand
The United States pressed its
demand today for the immediate
release of more American prisoners of
war and told North Vietnam to
dismantle missile sites below the
demilitarized zone or face action

Washington "deems appropriate."
Maj. Gen. Gilbert H. Woodward,
the senior U.S. delegate to the
four-party Joint Military Commission,
called on the Communist side in a
stormy commission meeting for
"clarification on an urgent basis" of
the POW dispute, in which Hanoi has
stalled release of a group of prisoners
expected to be freed early this week.
He said failure of North Vietnam
and the Viet Cong to release POWs at
the time indicated by the Jan. 27 Paris
peace agreement "is a clear violation
of the agreement and all that the
agreement is about."
Missile Installation
Woodward also said the installation
of missiles in northern South Vietnam
by Hanoi was a "clear and direct
violation of the agreement."
"We consider the construction of
the missile base at Khe Sanh since Jan.
28 not only a violation of the

agreement but a provocation to the
U.S. government," he said.
He warned the Communists that if
they refuse to withdraw the missiles
and dismantle the base, "my
government reserves the right with its
allies to take such actions as it deems
appropriate."
It was the first time Woodward
assailed the Communist side for
installation of the Soviet-built
surface-to-air missiles, which had been
reported by U.S. sources and the
Saigon government.
Deputy En Route
As today's meeting of the
four-party Joint Military Commission
got under way, Western diplomats
reported that Col. Hoang Hoa, a top
deputy in the North Vietnamese
delegation, was en route back from
Hanoi to Saigon with "new
instructions" and possibly a list of
American POWs to be released.

Maj. Gen. Gilbert H. Woodward,
the senior U.S. delegate to the
four-party Joint Military Commission,
called on the Communist side in a
stormy commission meeting for
"clarification on an urgent basis" of
the POW dispute, in which Hanoi has
stalled release of a group of prisoners
expected to be freed early this week.
He said failure of North Vietnam
and the Viet Cong to release POWs at
the time indicated by the Jan. 27 Paris
peace agreement "is a clear violation
of the agreement and all that the
agreement is about."
Missile Installation
Woodward also said the installation
of missiles in northern South Vietnam
by Hanoi was a "clear and direct
violation of the agreement."
"We consider the construction of
the missile base at Khe Sanh since Jan.
28 not only a violation of the

agreement but a provocation to the
U.S. government," he said.
He warned the Communists that if
they refuse to withdraw the missiles
and dismantle the base, "my
government reserves the right with its
allies to take such actions as it deems
appropriate."
It was the first time Woodward
assailed the Communist side for
installation of the Soviet-built
surface-to-air missiles, which had been
reported by U.S. sources and the
Saigon government.
Deputy En Route
As today's meeting of the
four-party Joint Military Commission
got under way, Western diplomats
reported that Col. Hoang Hoa, a top
deputy in the North Vietnamese
delegation, was en route back from
Hanoi to Saigon with "new
instructions" and possibly a list of
American POWs to be released.
From the Associated Press
The United States slowed down the
withdrawal of its remaining forces
from Vietnam today and may halt it
altogether unless North Vietnam
resumes the release of American
prisoners of war, high-ranking U.S.
authorities reported.
The source said no troop flights left
Vietnam today (local time), as they
have every day since the cease-fire
began Jan. 28. The United States has
been withdrawing about 400 troops a
day.
The U.S. Command in Saigon
would neither confirm nor deny the
report.
Meanwhile, in Paris, disputes over
North Vietnam's halt in the release of
American war prisoners imperiled the
international Vietnam peace

conference yesterday. Secretary of
State William P. Rogers suspended all
his conference activities.
The disputes broke out after a
morning in which the United States
and Hanoi reported they had reached
agreement on one important aspect of
the 13-party meeting here to seal the
Vietnam peace agreements signed a
month ago.
At the same time the work of
conference drafting experts also came
to a halt because of a refusal of
Communist delegates to sit down with
representatives of the United Nations.
These developments came as North
Vietnam and the United States traded
bitter charges over breaches of the
uneasy cease-fire deal signed in Paris
on Jan. 27.
Meeting Sought
Rogers sought an urgent meeting
with Foreign Minister Nguyen Duy
Trinh of North Vietnam in order to
have the intentions of the Hanoi
government clarified over the prisoner
release program.
Rogers was under President Nixon's
orders to shelve all other conference
business until the issue is resolved with
Trinh.
In Saigon earlier the North
Vietnamese and Viet Cong authorities
on the Joint Military Commission
announced their governments' decision
to quit freeing the prisoners.
At once this injected an atmosphere
of concern, if not of crisis, into the
conference proceedings here.
U.S. Presses Demand
The United States pressed its
demand today for the immediate
release of more American prisoners of
war and told North Vietnam to
dismantle missile sites below the
demilitarized zone or face action

Washington "deems appropriate."
