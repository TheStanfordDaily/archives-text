# Groups Won't Fund ASSU Referendum
## 
### SUE KING 
Citizens Advocates at Stanford, Inc.
and the Debate Union will not be
financing today's and tomorrow's
special fee assessment referendum,
which they requested, according to
ASSU Elections Commissioner Mike
Nilsson.
"It's not a buying off of the
ASSU," said Nilsson, because there
was "no actual cash transaction
between these groups and the ASSU."
Instead, Citizens Advocates has hired
half of the student police for each day
of the election. They will also provide
one worker for each polling place
today. The Debate Union will provide
workers tomorrow. Student police
officers hired by Nilsson will provide
the rest of the help.
Voting tables will be set up at the
Post Office and the Engineering
Corner of the Quad from 10 a.m. until
4 p.m. today and tomorrow. Tables at
the Physics Tank, and at the Law,
Business and Medical schools will be
open from 10 a.m. until 2 p.m.
In past years voter turnout for
ASSU elections has been light. Nilsson
feels that this election will not be an
exception. "I just don't think it's
something that the students are
interested in. I may be wrong,
though," he said.

Citizens Advocates requests a $1
assessment for three quarters,
beginning with spring quarter of this
year. The money would be used to
fund its operations, the "study,
negotiation, representation, and
litigation of problems affecting the
general public," according to the
group's flier. Stanford undergraduates
would become involved with the group
either through membership on the
Board of Directors or by doing
background research for litigation.
The Debate Union asks for a single
$1 assessment to pay the expenses of
entering debate tournaments and to
provide money to hire a debate coach.
A third measure on the ballot calls
for the ASSU Senate to spend $50
from the Senate Discretionary Fund to
publicize ways in which students can
donate money to rebuild Bach Mai
Hospital.
Preliminary results will be in by
tomorrow night, according to Nilsson.
Election results will not be official
until ballots from overseas campuses
have been tallied. Nilsson said that he
does not know when the overseas
ballots will be returned.
Both undergraduates and graduates
can vote in this election.
Current fee assessments exist for
KZSU, the Daily, the Speakers Bureau,
and Special Events.
