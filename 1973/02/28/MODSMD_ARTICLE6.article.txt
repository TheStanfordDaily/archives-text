# Publisher Regrets Shield Laws
## 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
Ralph Davidson, president of the
Alumni Association and publisher of
Time magazine, said yesterday that
despite the recent jailings of newsmen,
he is still "a great supporter of the
Constitution," who is "lukewarm on
shield laws," which protect newsmen
from disclosing confidential sources.
Davidson, who will address the
Stanford Business Conference this
afternoon, made his remarks on the
taping of a KZSU "Campus
Conference" program which will be
aired on March 13.
The 1950 Stanford graduate said
that despite his hesitancy, Time Inc.
officials are "probably going to have
to come out in support of a limited,
but strong shield law." Davidson
added that "I regret that. I happen to
believe that the Constitution and the
First Amendment have stood the test
of time."
The publisher admitted that some
news sources have dried up as a result
of recent court decisions, but he said
this is "an old problem.
Harassment
"Harassment of newsmen is not
something the current administration
dreamed up by itself." But he added
that "certainly in Washington today,
the kind of conversations we've had
over the past haven't taken place with
as much frequency recently."
Davidson said the "crux of the
problem" comes when an investigative
reporter is "intimidated and fearful of
going after news when sources fear
that they might be disclosed." He
attacked governmental actions which
create such problems and said "let the
public make up their minds. If they
don't like what we're publishing, we're
not going to survive."
But Davidson also said that "you
have to look at the subpoena in a
couple of ways, . . I don't believe that
there are no circumstance* under

which a newsman can be subpoenaed.
And who is a 'newsman'?"
Freelancers
He said that the grey area of
freelancers is a special problem when
dealing with shield laws. "To have a
shield law that absolutely protects the
pursuit of news may open up an area
legitimate newsmen do not want."
Davidson does not agree with a
recent proposal that publishers go to
jail with or in place of their reporters
who have been sentenced for not
disclosing sources. "It doesn't prove
anything if a publisher goes to jail with

or in place of a reporter. What proves a
point is if the publisher is willing to
stand up and fight for the rights of his
reporters."
He mentioned legal aid and
Congressional lobbying as two means
by which publishers can help protect
the reporter's rights.
Strong Words
Davidson, who became president of
the Alumni Association last year, had
strong words for the New Founders
League, a conservative alumni group
which has criticized the abolition of

of Business.
both the Indian athletic symbol and
ROTC.
"The New Founders League is a
negative force. They just sit back and
criticize everything that's going
on .. . They are using the art of the
half-truth and the quote taken out of
context to make things on campus
appear much worse than they are." He
said the League tries to portray
trashing as "a daily occurrence."
He denied that the Alumni
Association through its publication,
the Alumni Almanac, has tried to
"whitewash" campus problems as
some critics have charged. "I don't
think the Alumni Association is setting
out to whitewash anything," he said.
Association's Role
Commenting on the Association's
role, Davidson said, "we try to act as a
sounding board for alumni and we try
when necessary, when we think it's a
good idea, to talk to the University
and to the Trustees . . . The University

looks to its alumni for financial
support, advice and counsel, but the
University has to maintain its
academic freedom. Alumni can only
tell the University how to run its
affairs so far until you reach the point
where it's the province of the
University and not the alumni."
Davidson will speak today on
"Business Opportunity and Challenge
— A Publisher's Perspective," at the
all-day conference at the Graduate
School of Business (GSB) which will
focus on "economic and social forces
at work and their implications for
management."
Ezra Solomon, a member of the
President's Council on Economic
Advisers who will return to teaching
here spring quarter, will speak on the
domestic implications of President
Nixon's economic report. A number of
other professors will speak at the event
and 350 people, primarily GSB
alumni, are expected to pay $35 each
to attend the conference.

half-truth and the quote taken out of
context to make things on campus
appear much worse than they are." He
said the League tries to portray
trashing as "a daily occurrence."
He denied that the Alumni
Association through its publication,
the Alumni Almanac, has tried to
"whitewash" campus problems as
some critics have charged. "I don't
think the Alumni Association is setting
out to whitewash anything," he said.
Association's Role
Commenting on the Association's
role, Davidson said, "we try to act as a
sounding board for alumni and we try
when necessary, when we think it's a
good idea, to talk to the University
and to the Trustees . . . The University

looks to its alumni for financial
support, advice and counsel, but the
University has to maintain its
academic freedom. Alumni can only
tell the University how to run its
affairs so far until you reach the point
where it's the province of the
University and not the alumni."
Davidson will speak today on
"Business Opportunity and Challenge
— A Publisher's Perspective," at the
all-day conference at the Graduate
School of Business (GSB) which will
focus on "economic and social forces
at work and their implications for
management."
Ezra Solomon, a member of the
President's Council on Economic
Advisers who will return to teaching
here spring quarter, will speak on the
domestic implications of President
Nixon's economic report. A number of
other professors will speak at the event
and 350 people, primarily GSB
alumni, are expected to pay $35 each
to attend the conference.
Ralph Davidson, president of the
Alumni Association and publisher of
Time magazine, said yesterday that
despite the recent jailings of newsmen,
he is still "a great supporter of the
Constitution," who is "lukewarm on
shield laws," which protect newsmen
from disclosing confidential sources.
Davidson, who will address the
Stanford Business Conference this
afternoon, made his remarks on the
taping of a KZSU "Campus
Conference" program which will be
aired on March 13.
The 1950 Stanford graduate said
that despite his hesitancy, Time Inc.
officials are "probably going to have
to come out in support of a limited,
but strong shield law." Davidson
added that "I regret that. I happen to
believe that the Constitution and the
First Amendment have stood the test
of time."
The publisher admitted that some
news sources have dried up as a result
of recent court decisions, but he said
this is "an old problem.
Harassment
"Harassment of newsmen is not
something the current administration
dreamed up by itself." But he added
that "certainly in Washington today,
the kind of conversations we've had
over the past haven't taken place with
as much frequency recently."
Davidson said the "crux of the
problem" comes when an investigative
reporter is "intimidated and fearful of
going after news when sources fear
that they might be disclosed." He
attacked governmental actions which
create such problems and said "let the
public make up their minds. If they
don't like what we're publishing, we're
not going to survive."
But Davidson also said that "you
have to look at the subpoena in a
couple of ways, . . I don't believe that
there are no circumstance* under

which a newsman can be subpoenaed.
And who is a 'newsman'?"
Freelancers
He said that the grey area of
freelancers is a special problem when
dealing with shield laws. "To have a
shield law that absolutely protects the
pursuit of news may open up an area
legitimate newsmen do not want."
Davidson does not agree with a
recent proposal that publishers go to
jail with or in place of their reporters
who have been sentenced for not
disclosing sources. "It doesn't prove
anything if a publisher goes to jail with

or in place of a reporter. What proves a
point is if the publisher is willing to
stand up and fight for the rights of his
reporters."
He mentioned legal aid and
Congressional lobbying as two means
by which publishers can help protect
the reporter's rights.

the Alumni Association last year, had
strong words for the New Founders
League, a conservative alumni group
which has criticized the abolition of

have to look at the subpoena in a
couple of ways, . . I don't believe that
there are no circumstance* under

which a newsman can be subpoenaed.
And who is a 'newsman'?"
Freelancers
He said that the grey area of
freelancers is a special problem when
dealing with shield laws. "To have a
shield law that absolutely protects the
pursuit of news may open up an area
legitimate newsmen do not want."
Davidson does not agree with a
recent proposal that publishers go to
jail with or in place of their reporters
who have been sentenced for not
disclosing sources. "It doesn't prove
anything if a publisher goes to jail with

or in place of a reporter. What proves a
point is if the publisher is willing to
stand up and fight for the rights of his
reporters."
He mentioned legal aid and
Congressional lobbying as two means
by which publishers can help protect
the reporter's rights.
Strong Words
Davidson, who became president of
the Alumni Association last year, had
strong words for the New Founders
League, a conservative alumni group
which has criticized the abolition of

TIME FOR SHIELD LAW? — Ralph Davidson, president of the Alumni
Association and publisher of Time magazine, said that publication may be forced
to support a shield law protecting reporters from having to disclose confidential
news sources. Davidson will speak today at a conference in the Graduate School
of Business.
both the Indian athletic symbol and
ROTC.
"The New Founders League is a
negative force. They just sit back and
criticize everything that's going
on .. . They are using the art of the
half-truth and the quote taken out of
context to make things on campus
appear much worse than they are." He
said the League tries to portray
trashing as "a daily occurrence."
He denied that the Alumni
Association through its publication,
the Alumni Almanac, has tried to
"whitewash" campus problems as
some critics have charged. "I don't
think the Alumni Association is setting
out to whitewash anything," he said.
Association's Role
Commenting on the Association's
role, Davidson said, "we try to act as a
sounding board for alumni and we try
when necessary, when we think it's a
good idea, to talk to the University
and to the Trustees . . . The University

looks to its alumni for financial
support, advice and counsel, but the
University has to maintain its
academic freedom. Alumni can only
tell the University how to run its
affairs so far until you reach the point
where it's the province of the
University and not the alumni."
Davidson will speak today on
"Business Opportunity and Challenge
— A Publisher's Perspective," at the
all-day conference at the Graduate
School of Business (GSB) which will
focus on "economic and social forces
at work and their implications for
management."
Ezra Solomon, a member of the
President's Council on Economic
Advisers who will return to teaching
here spring quarter, will speak on the
domestic implications of President
Nixon's economic report. A number of
other professors will speak at the event
and 350 people, primarily GSB
alumni, are expected to pay $35 each
to attend the conference.
