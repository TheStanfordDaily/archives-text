## Minorities 
### 
There is an adage in journalism that if a paper manages to
encourage the wrath of both the political left and right, then it must
be doing something right. To be sure, the Daily receives its share of
contempt from nearly every frequency of the political spectrum. But I
am not so sure that this means we're doing the right job.
An institution is only as good as its components and the
interaction of components allow. The fact is, the Daily staff—from
reporters to editors to business staffers—lacks adequate representation
from many campus minorities. Like so many other institutions,
themajority of employees on this paper are white and male.
This is not to suggest that this is of anybody's wrongdoing. Anyone
who wants to work on this formidable daily can; one only needs to
walk through the door and ask for an assignment. But by and large,
black, chicano, Asian, and women students don't apply. While this
isn't a wrongdoing of this paper, it is a shortcoming.
Awareness
This shortcoming often crops up when the paper does a story or
review or editorial concerning these groups. The special awareness that
a person vitally involved with a special interest group can bring to a
story, or to the editorial board's understanding, is missing.
Occasionally this missing awareness shows, when a story mistates facts
or an editorial misses target.
I do not believe that inherently one race is incapable of reporting
about another, that one sex is incompetent when it comes to issues
regarding the other sex. But I do believe that it is possible for a
minority reporter or editor to be more sensitive to certain aspects of
an issue regarding that minority than a white-male newsperson. And
when the Daily receives strident criticism about its reporting of an
event pertaining to a minority, it may well reflect the shortcomings of
a staff that unwittingly is missing the point.
What this comes down to is: if the Stanford Daily is to be a true
community paper, then it needs input from people sensitive to various
parts of the community. While one cannot expect every special
interest group to be represented on a paper's staff—which would be
the epitome of tokenism—large segments of the Stanford community
remain beyond the sensitivity reach of the present staff.
Community
The Daily need not be viewed as a competitor with special interest
publications like the Real News or Chicanismo. As the only morning
daily paper for this area, it is the only source of day-to-day
information. As such, it needs to supply day-to-day information for
all the community, and this includes minority groups as well. Of
course, it cannot be a pulp sheet for every special project on campus,
but this should not prevent it from doing more for minority interests.
It is fair comment and criticism for outsiders to castigate a
newspaper when it remains stubbornly unwilling to multiply the
talents with which it can serve the total community. In order to
correct this shortcoming, I think we need to say clearly that the Daily
needs a staff representative of the community.

review or editorial concerning these groups. The special awareness that
a person vitally involved with a special interest group can bring to a
story, or to the editorial board's understanding, is missing.
Occasionally this missing awareness shows, when a story mistates facts
or an editorial misses target.
I do not believe that inherently one race is incapable of reporting
about another, that one sex is incompetent when it comes to issues
regarding the other sex. But I do believe that it is possible for a
minority reporter or editor to be more sensitive to certain aspects of
an issue regarding that minority than a white-male newsperson. And
when the Daily receives strident criticism about its reporting of an
event pertaining to a minority, it may well reflect the shortcomings of
a staff that unwittingly is missing the point.
What this comes down to is: if the Stanford Daily is to be a true
community paper, then it needs input from people sensitive to various
parts of the community. While one cannot expect every special
interest group to be represented on a paper's staff—which would be
the epitome of tokenism—large segments of the Stanford community
remain beyond the sensitivity reach of the present staff.
Community
The Daily need not be viewed as a competitor with special interest
publications like the Real News or Chicanismo. As the only morning
daily paper for this area, it is the only source of day-to-day
information. As such, it needs to supply day-to-day information for
all the community, and this includes minority groups as well. Of
course, it cannot be a pulp sheet for every special project on campus,
but this should not prevent it from doing more for minority interests.
It is fair comment and criticism for outsiders to castigate a
newspaper when it remains stubbornly unwilling to multiply the
talents with which it can serve the total community. In order to
correct this shortcoming, I think we need to say clearly that the Daily
needs a staff representative of the community.

There is an adage in journalism that if a paper manages to
encourage the wrath of both the political left and right, then it must
be doing something right. To be sure, the Daily receives its share of
contempt from nearly every frequency of the political spectrum. But I
am not so sure that this means we're doing the right job.
An institution is only as good as its components and the
interaction of components allow. The fact is, the Daily staff—from
reporters to editors to business staffers—lacks adequate representation
from many campus minorities. Like so many other institutions,
themajority of employees on this paper are white and male.
This is not to suggest that this is of anybody's wrongdoing. Anyone
who wants to work on this formidable daily can; one only needs to
walk through the door and ask for an assignment. But by and large,
black, chicano, Asian, and women students don't apply. While this
isn't a wrongdoing of this paper, it is a shortcoming.

This shortcoming often crops up when the paper does a story or
review or editorial concerning these groups. The special awareness that
