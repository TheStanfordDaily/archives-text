# The 						$50 Resolutions
## ASSU And Bach Mai 
### 
Brent Appel

In the upcoming ASSU
election, a resolution will appear
on the ballot to transfer $50 from
the ASSU Senate's Discretionary
Account in order to provide
information to the Stanford
community on how they can
contribute to rebuilding Bach Mai
Hospital in Hanoi.
The amount of money involved
is insignificant, and whether or
not the resolution passes is not
important. But this minor issue
does provide the opportunity to
examine central questions
concerning the character of the
ASSU and the University.
Some have maintained that the
ASSU ought not involve itself in
issues which are "political," and
this resolution surely falls into
that category. Others counter that
the ASSU, like the University, is
inevitably political, and that
"neutrality," or the refusal to
take positions on the
government's involvement in the
University, is an endorsement of
the status quo.
When the current members of
the ASSU Council of Presidents
were ASSU Senators last year, we
took the latter position. On Feb.
17, 1972, Scott Burke, Peter Van
Petten, and I voted for a
resolution criticizing the
University for allowing its
facilities to be used for war
research, military recruiting, and
war production in Stanford's
industrial park. On April 13,
1972, Scott, Peter, and I
reaffirmed our position by voting
in the ASSU Senate to endorse
the Committee on Student
Services recommendation that
military recruiters be barred from
using campus placement facilities.
War Research
With this history in mind, it is
not surprising that the current
Council of Presidents' platform
specifically pointed to the
problem of war research, an issue
which I have raised with the
Committee on Research of the
Academic Council. In a similar
vein, the ASSU Council of
Presidents condemned President
Nixon's mining of Haiphong
harbor in the spring, and called a
meeting of the student body in
White Plaza to discuss the
developments in Indochina. We
subsequently organized a Peace
Center in Memorial Court which
received publicity in the regional
press.

Apparently the Indochina war
is entering a new stage, one which
may evolve into a struggle more
political than military. For the
sake of the region's inhabitants I
certainly hope so. But this change
does not resurrect the war dead,
nor does it absolve American
responsibility for the war of the
last two decades. Likewise,
Stanford remains responsible, for
instance, for the millions of
dollars of highly political
counter-insurgency research
conducted at its own research
institute, SRlâ€”research which was
designed to render politically
impotent those who dared to
challenge American hegemony in
Indochina.

For these reasons, I introduced
a resolution in the ASSU Senate
to contribute to the Bach Mai
fund: that resolution was
defeated. At the next meeting, I
proposed that the present
resolution in question be placed
on the ballot: this was done by a
vote of 14-8. By passing this
resolution, the ASSU will help
Stanford students extend a
humanitarian hand to the victims
of American bombs that have
resulted from a war policy which
the University, through its
research and recruitment policies
among others, has implicitly
supported.
