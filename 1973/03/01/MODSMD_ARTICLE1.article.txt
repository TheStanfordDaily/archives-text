# Committees Argue Over New Ideas For Vienna
## 
### CHARLES BENNETT News Analysis 
"Things are very confused, and
you can quote me," says Electrical
Engineering Prof. Ralph Smith.
That is the only point on which
everyone seems to agree in the often
obscure negotiations that are leading
to a formal proposal to revive an
overseas program in Vienna, Austria.
The Committee on Foreign
Studies Programs has responsibility for
devising a replacement for the
soon-defunct Vienna campus. The
committee has explicit instructions
from Provost William Miller that
whatever new ideas it comes up with
must conform to the general
recommendations of the Merryman
Commission report.
That presidential commission has
urged sweeping changes in the overseas
campus system. These include a
rigorous academic program, housing of
students in native environments
instead of the present American
dormitories, moving all the overseas
programs into major cities, and giving
the system a nine-month instead of a
six-month base.
Deliberations Vital
The present deliberations are a vital
part of the future of the overseas
campuses. If a new proposal for
Vienna is instituted, its success or
failure may mean success or failure for
the entire set of Merryman
recommendations.

The committee originally called on
its Austria subcommittee to come up
with a new proposal for Vienna, to
replace the financially troubled
campus there now. The subcommittee
submitted a proposal about two weeks
ago.
When the parent committee met on
Monday of last week to discuss the
new Vienna idea, it emerged after two
hours having voted to refer the
proposal back to the subcommittee for
more details. The vote was five in
favor, four abstaining.
Why the abstentions?
An investigation to discover the
answer to that question reveals that
many committee members see the
development of a new Austria program
very differently from others, and the
resultant confusion has left some
members not even sure what the
committee voted to do or why.
One committee member asked me
to explain the vote to him if I ever
figured it out.
Discussion with several members of
the committee turns up considerable
evidence that the meeting was
confusing because there was no
agreement on even the general
direction a new program should take.
Some members liked the
subcommittee's proposal, others
thought it was badly thought out and
not innovative enough to conform to
the Merryman commission's
recommendations.

The subcommittee suggests a
program retaining half of the present
Vienna building, to house about 30
students, the rest to be placed in
Austrian homes or dormitories. The
academic system would be divided
into two 6-month segments, one
concentrating on Austrian and German
culture, the other on East European
studies.
The proposal was deliberately vague
when it reached the full committee,
because the subcommittee thought it
was told to make its suggestion
general.
The subcommittee also tried to
prepare the new Vienna plan as
quickly as possible. It had been told
that the building in Vienna must be
saved at all costs, because finding
another building downtown would be
extremely difficult if the lease were
allowed to drop on this one.
Caution Urged
The full committee was apparently

dismayed by this speed, fearing that if
a new proposal were rushed into,
mistakes might be made that would
ruin the program. It told the
subcommittee to go slowly.
When Provost Miller learned of
the problem, he sent a memorandum
to the committee urging caution. He
pointed out that a new director for the
overseas campus system is about to be
chosen, and no action should be taken
that would limit his opportunities to
mold the system.
The prospect for the future seems
to be that a new director will be
selected for the overseas campuses
within the next two weeks.
The Austria subcommittee will
report out a new, more detailed
proposal for a Vienna program at
about the same time, and the new
director will be able to sit in on, and
virtually control, the Foreign Studies
Committee meeting that approves or
votes down the recommendation.

If the new director agrees with the
committee minority that the
subcommittee idea is too much like
the present system, the proposal will
undoubtedly be killed, and it could be
months before another is devised.
If, however, the new director
strongly supports the
recommendation, or feels that an
experimental program should be
instituted as soon as possible, the
present Vienna building might be
retained. Who the director will be is a
significant political issue, in and out of
committee meetings.
The University has already decided
to keep three of the Vienna staff
members on the payroll for the next
year, whether or not a new program is
put in right away. Administrators feel
this is justifiable insurance to simplify
setting up a new program as soon as
one is settled on.
Trouble Brewing
In the meantime, trouble is brewing

at the German campus in Beutelsbach.
Present Overseas Campus Director
Robert Walker allegedly reports that
enrollment is so low for the upcoming
summer-fall group that there is cause
for serious concern.
Speculation about how to solve this
problem has led some to say that
Stanford should not have two
German-speaking overseas programs
until interest picks up. There is a lease
on the Beutelsbach campus for the
next three years or more, according to
one committee member. That lease is
too expensive to buy out.
Does that mean that there won't be
a revival of the Austria program after
all? Not necessarily. Dr. Walker is said
to be investigating ways to increase
enrollment in Germany. And so much
effort has been put into a new Vienna
program that few participants in the
discussions will want to drop it now.
