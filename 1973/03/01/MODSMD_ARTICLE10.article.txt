# Governmental Kidnapping
## The Politics Of Child Care
### 
' Bill Evers

There are three important
political aspects to the
federally-financed child
development programs that have
been proposed in recent years.
The first is that such a program
promises to be a boon monetarily
for psychologists and child
development contractors at the
expense of the middle and lower
classes. Secondly, a governmental
child-rearing program would be an
attempt to influence directly the
political and social values of
children. Finally, the effort to
establish a child development
program has a place in the current

controversy over compulsory
education.
Setting up comprehensive
child-rearing centers sponsored by
the government can be a
financially rewarding project. But
the money has been taken from
the American taxpayer. In the
November 197 2-February 1973
issue of Social Policy, Katherine
Ellis and Rosalind Petchesky note
that the provision of child
development will exacerbate the
fiscal crisis of the government and
that increasing taxes "means
placing virtually the whole fiscal
burden on the lower and middle
classes."
Ellis and Petchesky, in their
incisive and radical analysis,
recognize that "as happened in
the health empire, the field of
early childhood education appears
to be already opening up a vast
arena for exploitation by a
'partnership' of government and
corporate profit-seekers."
Living Off Taxes
What we can recognize as
already at work in child care is the
structure the late Lyle Spencer of
IBM dubbed the "social-industrial
complex." It is parallel to the
military-industrial complex,
similar in that its revenues are
taken from the taxpayer, but
different in that it works the
welfare side of the American
system. Ellis and Petchesy
describe a number of companies
in the day-care field that are living
off of tax money or actively

seeking it.
Furthermore, as Ellis and
Petchesky point out, for some
industries "day-care services have
been set up as 'a necessary service'
in order to recruit women
workers." Companies in these
industries are only too happy to
use funds from the government
budget to pay their production
costs. For them, it is a welcome
subsidy.
Human Events (in its Oct. 30,
1971 issue) also makes an
economic analysis of child
development: "While some critics
oppose the idea on the grounds
that they feel there is no earthly
reason for the federal government
to be involved in enriching
contractors by building lavish day
care centers for the kiddies, others
base their opposition on mounting
evidence that the proposed
centers have a more sinister
purpose: to remove the education
and training of children from the
home and the church and turn it
over to federally subsidized liberal
sociology and psychology
majors."
Mussolini and Javits
The essence of child
development programs, as Patricia
Gerald Bourne has shown in the
New Republic, is their potential
for supplanting parental
child-rearing responsibility.
The increased power of the
government under such
circumstances was well described
by Battleline newsletter: " 'Child

development,' as formulated by
its congressional backers, means
the provision by a government
agency, outside the family, for a
child's mental, emotional, and
physical needs. ... It includes
mental, dental, physical,
psychological, educational, and
social diagnosis, identification,
and treatment of children by the
'child development' center. In
order that these programs be
carried out, the child is to be
placed under the continuous
tutelege of government
functionaries."
Some proponents of
governmental child-rearing have
gone far in admitting that children
should be the property of
government officials. Echoing
Benito Mussolini on the subject of
children, Sen. Jacob K. Javits
(Râ€”N.Y.) claims: "We have
recognized that the child is a care
of the State."
Kidnapping
Opponents of governmental
kidnapping are afraid, for good
reason, that child development
programs will necessarily
influence the moral values held by
children. A resolution of the
White House Conference on
Children states: "Day care is a
powerful institution .... A day
care program that ministers to a
child from six months to six years
of age has over 8000 hours to
teach him values, fears, beliefs,
and behaviors." The opponents of
child development reply that they

know that the child developers
want to instill values, but that
they do not believe that the values
that would be instilled in federal
kindergartens would be the
correct ones.
The zeal and fervor with which
the child developers desire "early
intervention" in children's lives
should give us pause. Increased
dissatisfaction with compulsory
public education has led some in
desperation to turn to even more
and even earlier control over
children as the only solution.
Patricia Bourne recognizes that
"John Birchers on the right and
radicals on the left don't want the
public sector at any level to have
anything to do with [day care
because it would be an usurpation
of individual freedom." Maybe
there is something to the similar
analyses offered by these groups
with otherwise differing
ideologies.
John Holt, Paul Goodman, and
Ivan Illich have in recent years
given us strong arguments against
compulsory education. The call
for "universal pre-school public
education" is a proposal for more
of the same destruction of liberty,
incorrect moral influence, and
poor educational approach; and it
will mean taking more from the
taxpayers. Let's stop Leviathan
from swallowing children, at the
very least.
