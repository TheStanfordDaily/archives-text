# About Those Tunnels...
## On Athletic Finances 
### 
Joseph H. Ruetz

President Lyman's comments
on KZSU and his letters to
concerned individuals have been
as informative and succinct as

anything I might write on the
question of the allocation for the
stadium tunnels. But perhaps I
can elaborate on the points to be
raised.
The two stadium tunnels and
associated crosswalk and
restrooms are being funded from
Department reserves and from a
recent bequest to Stanford
restricted to major improvements
to and/or construction of new
facilities for the Department.
A substantial allocation from
the same bequest has already been
authorized to complete the
funding of the new swimming
pool/handball/squash complex
scheduled for completion in early
fall—it should be stated that the
major funding for that complex
came from gifts of alumni and
friends interested in Stanford
athletics.
Revenue and Reserves
Income from intercollegiate
sports—mainly football and its
associated radio, TV, Rose Bowl
receipts—furnishes approximately
70 percent of the annual income
on which this department
operates.
These funds support not only
the costs of intercollegiate
football, but the full costs of our
eleven other intercollegiate sports
and a substantial portion of men's
physical education classes,
intramurals, club sports, and
student/faculty/staff recreation.
They also pay for the operation
and maintenance of the large
indoor and outdoor plant which
falls under the operational
jurisdiction of this Department.
In some years, through a
combination of fortunate
circumstances and good
management—unbudgeted TV
games, Rose Bowl, exciting teams
and opponents—we end the year
with a surplus. These funds are
placed in Department reserves and
are designated for Master Plan
building projects or major
renovations. Major transfers from

these reserves require Board of
Trustee approval.
A Business Decision
The stadium tunnels are not
the only things ever built at
Stanford from surplus income
from football. Branner Hall, the
Women's Gymnasium and pool,
and the Stanford golf course are
three facilities so funded years
ago. More recently,
$1,223,068.18 from reserves was
advanced to complete the funding
of Maples Pavilion, which was also
financed in the main by gifts of
alumni and friends interested in
Stanford athletics. In 1970,
$37,000 plus was expended to
resurface the tennis courts and
$40,000 expended for shower
renovation in the old Encina
Gym.
Now, as to the tunnels! The
willingness of spectators to follow
Stanford's intercollegiate fortunes
has been responsible for the fact
that we have a reserve at all. In
the Bay Area the spectator has
many options available for
allocating his leisure dollars.
The stadium is our prime
income producing facility. It was
built in the 1920'5. It has had few
major improvements—some
replacement of worn out seats and
a new Press Box. The restroom
facilities —as many will attest—are
just this side of atrocious, as is
ease of access to the stands and
restrooms because of congestion.
Access to the stands in case of

emergency illness is particularly
bad. So ... the decision to build
the tunnels was purely a business
decision based on our belief it will
help sustain and improve
attendance—all other factors being
equal.
A Proud Tradition
Before closing, I don't want
this exposition of the reasons for
the tunnel decision to obscure the
most important point of all.
Intercollegiate athletics at
Stanford has had a proud
tradition and, in my experience, it
has been conducted without
violating Stanford's academic or
athletic integrity.
Partly by reasons of geography,
but mainly by choice, Stanford
participates in one of the toughest
intercollegiate conferences in the
country. Our intercollegiate
program is conducted with
substantially fewer athletic grants
than most of our opponents.
There are no easy academic
majors for any Stanford
student—much less an athlete to
retreat to.
For information on Athletes
and Scholarship, I would refer
you to the article by that title in
the June 1972 Stanford Observer.
The figures listed there are the
best measure I know of the
academic integrity by which our
program has been conducted in a
distinguished private university.

these reserves require Board of
Trustee approval.
A Business Decision
The stadium tunnels are not
the only things ever built at
Stanford from surplus income
from football. Branner Hall, the
Women's Gymnasium and pool,
and the Stanford golf course are
three facilities so funded years
ago. More recently,
$1,223,068.18 from reserves was
advanced to complete the funding
of Maples Pavilion, which was also
financed in the main by gifts of
alumni and friends interested in
Stanford athletics. In 1970,
$37,000 plus was expended to
resurface the tennis courts and
$40,000 expended for shower
renovation in the old Encina
Gym.
Now, as to the tunnels! The
willingness of spectators to follow
Stanford's intercollegiate fortunes
has been responsible for the fact
that we have a reserve at all. In
the Bay Area the spectator has
many options available for
allocating his leisure dollars.
The stadium is our prime
income producing facility. It was
built in the 1920'5. It has had few
major improvements—some
replacement of worn out seats and
a new Press Box. The restroom
facilities —as many will attest—are
just this side of atrocious, as is
ease of access to the stands and
restrooms because of congestion.
Access to the stands in case of

emergency illness is particularly
bad. So ... the decision to build
the tunnels was purely a business
decision based on our belief it will
help sustain and improve
attendance—all other factors being
equal.
A Proud Tradition
Before closing, I don't want
this exposition of the reasons for
the tunnel decision to obscure the
most important point of all.
Intercollegiate athletics at
Stanford has had a proud
tradition and, in my experience, it
has been conducted without
violating Stanford's academic or
athletic integrity.
Partly by reasons of geography,
but mainly by choice, Stanford
participates in one of the toughest
intercollegiate conferences in the
country. Our intercollegiate
program is conducted with
substantially fewer athletic grants
than most of our opponents.
There are no easy academic
majors for any Stanford
student—much less an athlete to
retreat to.
For information on Athletes
and Scholarship, I would refer
you to the article by that title in
the June 1972 Stanford Observer.
The figures listed there are the
best measure I know of the
academic integrity by which our
program has been conducted in a
distinguished private university.

President Lyman's comments
on KZSU and his letters to
concerned individuals have been
as informative and succinct as

anything I might write on the
question of the allocation for the
stadium tunnels. But perhaps I
can elaborate on the points to be
raised.
The two stadium tunnels and
associated crosswalk and
restrooms are being funded from
Department reserves and from a
recent bequest to Stanford
restricted to major improvements
to and/or construction of new
facilities for the Department.
A substantial allocation from
the same bequest has already been
authorized to complete the
funding of the new swimming
pool/handball/squash complex
scheduled for completion in early
fall—it should be stated that the
major funding for that complex
came from gifts of alumni and
friends interested in Stanford
athletics.
Revenue and Reserves
Income from intercollegiate
sports—mainly football and its
associated radio, TV, Rose Bowl
receipts—furnishes approximately
70 percent of the annual income
on which this department
operates.
These funds support not only
the costs of intercollegiate
football, but the full costs of our
eleven other intercollegiate sports
and a substantial portion of men's
physical education classes,
intramurals, club sports, and
student/faculty/staff recreation.
They also pay for the operation
and maintenance of the large
indoor and outdoor plant which
falls under the operational
jurisdiction of this Department.
In some years, through a
combination of fortunate
circumstances and good
management—unbudgeted TV
games, Rose Bowl, exciting teams
and opponents—we end the year
with a surplus. These funds are
placed in Department reserves and
are designated for Master Plan
building projects or major
renovations. Major transfers from

these reserves require Board of
Trustee approval.
