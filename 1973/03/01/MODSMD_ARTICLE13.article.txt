# 'Modern Thought' Provides Home For Displaced Students
## 
### ALISON ANDERSON 
Sensing a growing trend away from intellectual
classification, the University has created an
inter-disciplinary program called "Modern Thought
and Literature." Currently in its fourth year, the
graduate program is providing what David
Halliburton, professor of English and acting
chairman of the program, calls a "home for students
who in the past would have been intellectually
displaced persons."
The program was created by Albert Guerard, for
students who plan to teach "modern" literature —
meaning from the Enlightenment to the present.
Students focus on developing an in-depth
knowledge of one literature in the past 200 years.
While literature is their primary concern, the
students coordinate this with an area of
interdisciplinary study, which could be history,
social science, religion, the arts, or any other aspect
of modern culture.
Mark Frieman, the first student to complete the
program and look for a job, has been offered a
teaching position at Trinity College in
Massachusetts. Socially and politically oriented,
Frieman focused his studies on naturalism in
American literature.
Unusual Program Feature
An unusual feature of the Modern Thought and
Literature program is that creative writing can be
counted for credit toward the degree. The creative
writing department is the only other discipline that
allows this.
Several students in the program have had their
work published. Joan Dassin has published an article
in Centennial Review, and Linda Coolidge has
published a book of poetry.
Richard Keller Simon is presenting two lectures
on rock music and pop culture here. The first,
entitled "Come and Get These Memories: the
Messages of Rock Music," deals with the themes in
rock music from the fifties and early sixties.

The second, scheduled for Tuesday, March 6 at 8
p.m. in Jordan 041, he calls "Growing Old with Bob
Dylan: Dreams, Nightmares, Halucinations." Simon,
now in his second year in the Modern Thought and
Literature program, originally wrote the lectures
when he was teaching in Michigan, because he
realized that the music was of great importance to
his students.
Selective Admissions
Admission to the program is extremely selective.
One in twenty applicants is admitted. The high
academic caliber of the ten students currently in the
program is revealed by the fact that several have
held national or traveling fellowships. One student,
for example, is spending this year on a Fulbright
fellowship studying Brazilian literature in Sao Paulo,
Brazil.
Both faculty members and students have
experienced feelings of intellectual comradeship in
the program. Colloquia, typically organized by
graduate students, have promoted discussion
between students and professors of different
disciplines who share common interests.
In November, 1972, the Committee on Modern
Thought and Literature sponsored a conference
called "Myth, Symbol, and Culture," which was
attended by 2200 people.
'Constellation of Symposia'
The 1973 conference will host three principal
speakers, one of whom will be Stanley Cavell, a
philosopher of aesthetics at Harvard University. The
Committee also hopes to have a painter and a
novelist speak. Complementing the speakers will be
a "constellation of workshops, panels, and
symposia," which Halliburton sees as an exciting
part of the program.
Currently Modern Thought and Literature is a
graduate program. Because of financial and
administrative problems, Halliburton sees little
chance that an undergraduate component will be
created in the near future.

'Constellation of Symposia'
The 1973 conference will host three principal
speakers, one of whom will be Stanley Cavell, a
philosopher of aesthetics at Harvard University. The
Committee also hopes to have a painter and a
novelist speak. Complementing the speakers will be
a "constellation of workshops, panels, and
symposia," which Halliburton sees as an exciting
part of the program.
Currently Modern Thought and Literature is a
graduate program. Because of financial and
administrative problems, Halliburton sees little
chance that an undergraduate component will be
created in the near future.
Sensing a growing trend away from intellectual
classification, the University has created an
inter-disciplinary program called "Modern Thought
and Literature." Currently in its fourth year, the
graduate program is providing what David
Halliburton, professor of English and acting
chairman of the program, calls a "home for students
who in the past would have been intellectually
displaced persons."
The program was created by Albert Guerard, for
students who plan to teach "modern" literature —
meaning from the Enlightenment to the present.
Students focus on developing an in-depth
knowledge of one literature in the past 200 years.
While literature is their primary concern, the
students coordinate this with an area of
interdisciplinary study, which could be history,
social science, religion, the arts, or any other aspect
of modern culture.
Mark Frieman, the first student to complete the
program and look for a job, has been offered a
teaching position at Trinity College in
Massachusetts. Socially and politically oriented,
Frieman focused his studies on naturalism in
American literature.
Unusual Program Feature
An unusual feature of the Modern Thought and
Literature program is that creative writing can be
counted for credit toward the degree. The creative
writing department is the only other discipline that
allows this.
Several students in the program have had their
work published. Joan Dassin has published an article
in Centennial Review, and Linda Coolidge has
published a book of poetry.
Richard Keller Simon is presenting two lectures
on rock music and pop culture here. The first,
entitled "Come and Get These Memories: the
Messages of Rock Music," deals with the themes in
rock music from the fifties and early sixties.

The second, scheduled for Tuesday, March 6 at 8
p.m. in Jordan 041, he calls "Growing Old with Bob
Dylan: Dreams, Nightmares, Halucinations." Simon,
now in his second year in the Modern Thought and
Literature program, originally wrote the lectures
when he was teaching in Michigan, because he
realized that the music was of great importance to
his students.
Selective Admissions
Admission to the program is extremely selective.
One in twenty applicants is admitted. The high
academic caliber of the ten students currently in the
program is revealed by the fact that several have
held national or traveling fellowships. One student,
for example, is spending this year on a Fulbright
fellowship studying Brazilian literature in Sao Paulo,
Brazil.
Both faculty members and students have
experienced feelings of intellectual comradeship in
the program. Colloquia, typically organized by
graduate students, have promoted discussion
between students and professors of different
disciplines who share common interests.
In November, 1972, the Committee on Modern
Thought and Literature sponsored a conference
called "Myth, Symbol, and Culture," which was
attended by 2200 people.
