# Improved Peking-U.S. Ties Laid To Moscow Rivalry
## 
### Associated Press 
WASHINGTON - Peking
apparently is making a big
concession in agreeing to
exchange official liaison offices
with Washington, and a major
reason probably is China's rivalry
with Moscow.
The Nixon administration,
which wants to avoid offending
either of the two Communist
giants, is keeping mum about this
aspect of the surprise speed in the

normalizing of U.S.-Chinese
relations.
Just after the Nixon summit a
year ago, the Shanghai
communique said "The Chinese
government firmly opposes any
activities which aim at the
creation of 'one China, one
Taiwan,' 'one-China, two
governments,' 'two Chinas,' an
'independent Taiwan,' or advocate
that 'the status of Taiwan remains
to be determined."

But the Washington-Peking
communique issued one week ago,
announcing the liaison-offices
agreement, made no mention of
any concession by the United
States in its support of Nationalist
China.
And presidential adviser Henry
A. Kissinger told newsmen the
United States will continue
diplomatic relations with Taiwan
and will not at this time pull out
any of the 9000 U.S. troops
stationed there.
Peking's price to countries
seeking formal diplomatic
relations has been abandonment
of such relations with Taiwan.
The Communist Chinese say theirs
is the sole legal government of all
China, including Taiwan.
The liaison-office formula falls
short of a full exchange of
embassies between Washington
and Peking, which may be years
away. But the potential for
embassy-like operations has been
set, to begin within a month or so.
Kissinger said the Chinese
office here and the U.S. office in
Peking would "cover the whole
gamut of relationships" except
strictly formal diplomatic aspects.
The government officials
manning the offices are to get
diplomatic privileges. They will,
like full-fledged diplomats, be
allowed to communicate with
their capitals by coHe. National
flag-flying by the missions is being
considered.
