# Cronkite Blasts Nixon

### Associated Press 
ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. -
Television newscaster Walter
Cronkite accused the Nixon
administration last Sunday of
manipulating public opinion so
that "to stand up and defend
freedom of speech and press is to
appear anti-Nixon."
Cronkite made the charge in a
speech before the 105th annual
convention of the American
Association of School
Administrators.
The CBS-TV News anchorman
said the Nixon administration was
trying to raise its own credibility
"by dragging down that of the
press."
Cronkite also referred to the
government's recently announced
proposal to hold local stations
responsible for the contents of
network news. "The
administration seeks to bring the
network news programs to heel by

making them responsive to the
local stations, where it has
licensing authority, and thus can
bring political and financial
pressures to bear," he said.
"It is strange that they cannot
see that the power with which
they would invest themselves
today, they might have to pass on
to another political party
tomorrow. Or, perhaps, do they
believe that with such power over
a cowed and intimidated press,
that is not a serious possibility?"
asked Cronkite.
"It is sad, and a mystery, that
the administration should dull its
considerable accomplishments
with such petty and churlish
tactics. Churlish, perhaps, but
dangerous," Cronkite said.
He said the Supreme Court had
stripped the press of "the privilege
to protect its sources, and without
such protection, a free press
cannot survive."
