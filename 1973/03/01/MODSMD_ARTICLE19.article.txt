When will the squash courts be finished? How many will there be?
Can you give some general information about them? R.B.
Barring weather delays and unforeseen happenings, the courts will
be finished on Sept. 1, according to Donald Tobin, Assistant to the
Athletic Director.
There will be four squash courts and four handball courts.
Wesley Ruff of the Athletic Department is working on a set of
regulations governing the use of the courts. He and a student, Steve
Fury, have come up with some tentative rules that are still subject to
revision.
The main rules are:
1. Reservations can be made a day in advance for 45-minute time
periods.
2. One handball and one squash court are reserved for challenge
games.
3. Participants must be on the court within five minutes of the
time they had reserved, and must be prepared to show a Stanford ID
card, which will be checked hourly.
4. Guests are allowed but discouraged.
5. No consecutive reservations are allowed.
6. Players are not to use metal frame racquets.
The courts are scheduled to be open from 8 a.m. until 10:15 p.m.
on weekdays and 8 a.m. until 5:45 p.m. on Saturdays.

Driving at night on the Embarcadero Road area running parallel to
the Stanford football stadium is hazardous due to poorly marked road
lines. It is almost impossible to distinguish the pavement from the
shoulder of the road. Curves in the road are also difficult to anticipate
because of vague line markings. Is there any chance that these median
and shoulder lines will be repainted in the near future? S.G.
Perry Hackett, Roads & Grounds Manager, said that the lines on
Galvez Street, which turns into Embarcadero after passing the
stadium, will be repainted in the spring. He explained that the lines in
that area have worn off faster than usual because dirt from the trucks
that use the road to get to and from the site of the new swimming
pool complex grind the lines off.

The fact that the inner half of the Quad in front of Memorial
Church is an asphalt-covered parade ground really bugs me, especially
since the Quad would be such a beautiful place without this eyesore.
Has anyone seriously considered planting grass there? No doubt it
would be expensive, but after all the University has allowed grass to
grow in other parts of the campus. Why anyone would put an acre of
asphat in the middle of the Quad escapes me. J.B.
"That question comes up constantly," said Dan Roks, a landscape
architect in the Planning office, "but mostly from people who are not
from California."
The main reason cited by Rolfs for leaving the inner Quad paved
was that grass is "not part of the design," which calls for a
Mediterranean courtyard. Other reasons include the cost of planting
and maintaining the grass, and the fact that grass could not bear the
traffic that passes through the inner Quad.
Master Planner Oscar Nelson said that people who are not from
California don't realize that grass is "not natural in this Mediterranean
climate.
"We have a basically semi-arid climate," he explained, "although
you'd never know it from the rain we've had!"
Rolf mentioned that the most likely possibility is that the inner
Quad will be repaved and borders of "rich paving" (cobblestones,
brick, or concrete with color) installed. Nelson said that the result
would be "maintenance free, handsome and architecturally
'sympatico.'" (This idea depends on the Planning office getting
enough money to make the plan financially feasible.)

"We have a basically semi-arid climate," he explained, "although
you'd never know it from the rain we've had!"
Rolf mentioned that the most likely possibility is that the inner
Quad will be repaved and borders of "rich paving" (cobblestones,
brick, or concrete with color) installed. Nelson said that the result
would be "maintenance free, handsome and architecturally
'sympatico.'" (This idea depends on the Planning office getting
enough money to make the plan financially feasible.)

When will the squash courts be finished? How many will there be?
Can you give some general information about them? R.B.
Barring weather delays and unforeseen happenings, the courts will
be finished on Sept. 1, according to Donald Tobin, Assistant to the
Athletic Director.
There will be four squash courts and four handball courts.
Wesley Ruff of the Athletic Department is working on a set of
regulations governing the use of the courts. He and a student, Steve
Fury, have come up with some tentative rules that are still subject to
revision.
The main rules are:
1. Reservations can be made a day in advance for 45-minute time
periods.
2. One handball and one squash court are reserved for challenge
games.
3. Participants must be on the court within five minutes of the
time they had reserved, and must be prepared to show a Stanford ID
card, which will be checked hourly.
4. Guests are allowed but discouraged.
5. No consecutive reservations are allowed.
6. Players are not to use metal frame racquets.
The courts are scheduled to be open from 8 a.m. until 10:15 p.m.
on weekdays and 8 a.m. until 5:45 p.m. on Saturdays.

Driving at night on the Embarcadero Road area running parallel to
the Stanford football stadium is hazardous due to poorly marked road
lines. It is almost impossible to distinguish the pavement from the
shoulder of the road. Curves in the road are also difficult to anticipate
because of vague line markings. Is there any chance that these median
and shoulder lines will be repainted in the near future? S.G.
Perry Hackett, Roads & Grounds Manager, said that the lines on
Galvez Street, which turns into Embarcadero after passing the
stadium, will be repainted in the spring. He explained that the lines in
that area have worn off faster than usual because dirt from the trucks
that use the road to get to and from the site of the new swimming
pool complex grind the lines off.

The fact that the inner half of the Quad in front of Memorial
Church is an asphalt-covered parade ground really bugs me, especially
since the Quad would be such a beautiful place without this eyesore.
Has anyone seriously considered planting grass there? No doubt it
would be expensive, but after all the University has allowed grass to
grow in other parts of the campus. Why anyone would put an acre of
asphat in the middle of the Quad escapes me. J.B.
"That question comes up constantly," said Dan Roks, a landscape
architect in the Planning office, "but mostly from people who are not
from California."
The main reason cited by Rolfs for leaving the inner Quad paved
was that grass is "not part of the design," which calls for a
Mediterranean courtyard. Other reasons include the cost of planting
and maintaining the grass, and the fact that grass could not bear the
traffic that passes through the inner Quad.
Master Planner Oscar Nelson said that people who are not from
California don't realize that grass is "not natural in this Mediterranean
climate.
