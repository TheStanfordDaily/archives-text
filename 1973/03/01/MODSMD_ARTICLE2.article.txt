# Pleased By Economic Council's Effect
## Adviser Praises Nixon's Stabilization Plan 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
Ezra Solomon, a member of the
President's Council of Economic
Advisers (CEA) who will return to
teaching here spring quarter, said
yesterday that he is "pleasantly
surprised" at the effect the council has
had on President Nixon's economic
policies.
Solomon, who joined the CEA in
September 1971, said he was
"skeptical" when he first went to
Washington."I am surprised about
how sizable the effect has been." He
claimed that a large part of the advice
the council gives is "listened to and
acted on." Solomon said that the three
member CEA has been given a
"progressively larger scope of
responsibility."
Solomon spoke on the domestic
implications of the recently released
1973 Economic Report of the
President during a panel discussion at
the all-day Stanford Business
Conference and he predicted an
optimistic future for the nation's
economy.
"The probability of a recession is
extremely small. We don't see a
recession in 1973 ... We expect
continuation of rapid growth, but at a
rate which will abate towards a long
term level of a 4-4'/2 percent
increase... in terms of real Gross
National Product (GNP)."
Praised Stabilization
Solomon praised the President's
stabilization program and said that "a
policeman had to step in because the
private sector was not behaving as well
as it normally does." He said that
"1972 . . . produced, by and large,
what we wanted with the exception of

the behavior of food prices." He called
the increases in food prices "a serious
snag."
He said that in the last six months
there has been a nine percent increase
in food prices compared to a 2.6
percent increase in non-food prices.
But he predicted that "by the end
of the year we ought to be down to a
2V4 percent rate of inflation on the
consumer price index." The total rate
for the last six months has been 3'/2
percent, according to Solomon.
"The experience of the last five or
seven years has made inflation a
serious problem," which has become
as important as "reasonable full
employment. The unemployment
problem is not as serious as it once
was." Solomon said that the United
States is undergoing a period of the
"largest dose of peacetime inflation
we've had in a long time." But he adds
that "something ought to be done
about the youth unemployment
problem."
Expensive War
Solomon traced the roots of
current inflation back to the mid-60's
and said that a "very expensive war"
and"the biggest expansion of welfare
programs in our history" led to
"rip-roaring inflation." He said that
devaluation of the dollar was an
inevitable result of such inflation.
Commenting on President Nixon's
recent proposals for welfare and other
social programs, Solomon said "I'm
not sure all the programs started in the
60's were efficient... We needed to
step off the fiscal accelerator." He
claimed that the President's proposals
are "fiscally required" and said that
"there has not been a cutback, but the

rate of increase has been slowed for
most programs."
Solomon does not feel that current
energy shortages constitute a
long-range problem. He admitted that
"we are moving into a decade or two
when there will be a shortage of
supplies we once thought were so
abundant we had to burn them." But
he added that "market sources will
bring forth all sorts of alternative
means of energy."
Energy Crisis Not Serious
The panel discussion also included a
speech by Economics Prof. James
Howell who spoke on the international
implications of the President's report.
Howell also claimed that the energy
crisis is a "short term problem."
Howell said there is "plenty" of
available oil and mentioned Alaska as
one major source of such oil. "When
you have a choice between
safeguarding the elk and heating your
home, you might change your set of
values .. . There isn't as much of a
crisis as it appears on the surface."
Howell said that "technology can
solve most of the energy problems."
Economics Prof. G.L. Bach, who
moderated the panel discussion, said
that predictions about the large
amount of power Middle East
countries will have due to oil sales are
"nonsense." "The developing world
needs advanced countries every bit as
much as we need them."
Ralph Davidson, president of the
Alumni Association and publisher of
Time magazine, spoke on "the role of
the press in our society" as part of the
conference's afternoon session and
said that "freedom of the press is
unfortunately shrinking throughout

the world."
Davidson said that in America
today, "the government seems to be
getting more entwined and involved in
our lives." He said that the press has
an "enormous role" today. "The press
must report with more sensibility,
more reliability and more courage than
ever before." More than 300 persons,
primarily Graduate School of Business
alumni, paid $35 each to attend the
conference.
