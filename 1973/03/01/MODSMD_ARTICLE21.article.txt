# Eye On East-West Rapprochement
## 
### WILLIAM L. RYAN AP Special Correspondent 
Funny things are happening on
the road to communism.
Those responsible for the
purity of Marxism-Leninism are
standing theory on its head but
insisting all the while that nothing
of the sort could ever possibly
happen.
Leaders who shrilly denounced
Western and American bankers
eagerly welcome a friend from
Chase Manhattan now.
Leaders who painted U.S.
industry as the image of
devil-imperialist incarnate are
bringing their own people into the
Pepsi generation.
Leaders who solemnly warned
former colonial countries of the
perils of Western investment are
straining for ways to lure Western
money to their own lands.
Western Capitalists Welcome
Economic officials shuttle
between Communist and Western
worlds looking for likely capitalist
techniques to apply to their own
economies. Their countries
welcome a flock of capitalists
from the West sounding out trade
prospects.
In terms of deference, highly
placed Russian Communists quote
from such unlikely sources as the
Morgan Guaranty Trust Co.
reports, the analyses of Business
Week and various U.S. capitalists'
remarks.
Where, in fact, can the faithful
look today for a truly untainted
proletarian leadership?
To China? The Peking leaders
not only are competing, but are
taking positions that would have
been unthinkable ideological sins
a short time ago: for example,
supporting the idea that the
European Common Market is a
positive and necessary
development.
To Albania? Not so. Remote
and hostile as it has long been, foe
of the "Soviet social imperialists"
as well as the West, Albania is
softening.. It is even making
gestures to its longtime enemy,
Greece, and the right-wing
government there, mending
relations to the extent of
concluding a new trade
agreement.
Tito Turnabout
Responding to Stalin's baton,
the whole Communist world once
chorused denunciation of Tito's
Yugoslavia as a deviant from

Moscow's notions of acceptable
Leninsism.
Today not one of them says a
word publicly against the
spectacle of Yugoslavia signing
contracts right and left with
private businessmen in the West,

agreeing to U.S. protection of
American private investment in
Yugoslavia, liberalizing laws to
lure foreign money, even
suggesting they might bend the
Yugoslav constitution in the
matter of foreign ownership.

Once a mere mention of the
Rockefeller name sent the party
rushing to defend the ramparts.
Today, David Rockefeller,
chairman of the Chase Manhattan
Bank, talks business head to head
with Hungarian and Yugoslav

Communists in Belgrade.
There was a time when a Soviet
bloc regime would never overlook
an opportunity to lambaste all
West European systems, and most
particularly West Germany's,
which by Communist definition
represented a dire threat to
European and world peace.
Today, Soviet and East
European regimes think nothing
of dickering with West Germany
in the hope of invigorating an
East-West trade.
Czechoslovakia, under one of
the most regressive and repressive
regimes in the Soviet bloc, throws
out hints about its willingness to
import U.S. consumer technology.
Bulgaria, long the little echo of
big Russia, recently sent its
foreign minister to the United
States to talk of how nice it
would be for Bulgaria to have the
status of a most-favored nation in
trade with Americans. The Greek
colonels' regime no longer looks
so bad to the Bulgarians who, like
other bloc regimes, are moving to
mend relations there.
Romania, the pioneer in 1969
by receiving President Nixon on a
state visit, has been free-wheeling
for a long time and was the first in
the bloc to make friends with
Germany, Greece and other
countries on the Communist
taboo list.
Puritanically Leninist on the
home front, the Romanian regime
became the only Soviet bloc
nation to be a member of the
International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development
and of the International Monetary
Fund. It has been angling for
special treatment in the Common
Market, while throwing out lures
to attract Western investment
money.
Moscow's Incredible Deals
If all that was heresy, Moscow
could hardly complain. The
Kremlin has been making
incredible deals, including one for
bottling and distributing
Pepsi-Cola in the U.S.S.R.
Moscow offers concessions for
development of Soviet resources.
It displays eagerness to get hold of
Western consumer technologies.
All this obviously is aimed at
putting some zip into a drab
consumer economy.
At the same time the Kremlin
seems to detect danger of
contamination. It wants security
— not so much military security as
safety from outside influences as
it imports outside goods and
methods. It wants to keep its
public safe from "harmful
bourgeois influences."
This explains Moscow's
performance at the talks that are
supposed to lead to a European
Security Conference. The West
has said that any security
arrangement should include free
flow of persons, ideas and
information across borders. The
idea is unthinkable in Moscow,
but the Kremlin has found a
response.
As Moscow Pravda put it,
Moscow is perfectly willing to
accept anything but
"misanthropic ideas, anticulture,
propaganda of fascism, racism or
enmity among peoples, slander
and pornography."
As for the West, it said,
"welcome." But there would be
no rest. Those categories can
cover the widest range of ideas
and make it certain nothing but
Soviet-approved ideas penetrates
the bloc.

arrangement should include free
flow of persons, ideas and
information across borders. The
idea is unthinkable in Moscow,
but the Kremlin has found a
response.
As Moscow Pravda put it,
Moscow is perfectly willing to
accept anything but
"misanthropic ideas, anticulture,
propaganda of fascism, racism or
enmity among peoples, slander
and pornography."
As for the West, it said,
"welcome." But there would be
no rest. Those categories can
cover the widest range of ideas
and make it certain nothing but
Soviet-approved ideas penetrates
the bloc.
Funny things are happening on
the road to communism.
Those responsible for the
purity of Marxism-Leninism are
standing theory on its head but
insisting all the while that nothing
of the sort could ever possibly
happen.
Leaders who shrilly denounced
Western and American bankers
eagerly welcome a friend from
Chase Manhattan now.
Leaders who painted U.S.
industry as the image of
devil-imperialist incarnate are

Leaders who solemnly warned

Western Capitalists Welcome
Economic officials shuttle

welcome a flock of capitalists

Week and various U.S. capitalists'
remarks.
Where, in fact, can the faithful
look today for a truly untainted
proletarian leadership?
To China? The Peking leaders
not only are competing, but are
taking positions that would have
been unthinkable ideological sins
a short time ago: for example,
supporting the idea that the
European Common Market is a
positive and necessary
development.
To Albania? Not so. Remote
and hostile as it has long been, foe
of the "Soviet social imperialists"
as well as the West, Albania is
softening.. It is even making
gestures to its longtime enemy,
Greece, and the right-wing
government there, mending
relations to the extent of
concluding a new trade
agreement.
Tito Turnabout
Responding to Stalin's baton,
the whole Communist world once
chorused denunciation of Tito's
Yugoslavia as a deviant from

Moscow's notions of acceptable
Leninsism.
Today not one of them says a
word publicly against the
spectacle of Yugoslavia signing
contracts right and left with
private businessmen in the West,

agreeing to U.S. protection of
American private investment in
Yugoslavia, liberalizing laws to
lure foreign money, even
suggesting they might bend the
Yugoslav constitution in the
matter of foreign ownership.

Once a mere mention of the
Rockefeller name sent the party
rushing to defend the ramparts.
Today, David Rockefeller,
chairman of the Chase Manhattan
Bank, talks business head to head
with Hungarian and Yugoslav

Communists in Belgrade.
There was a time when a Soviet
bloc regime would never overlook
an opportunity to lambaste all
West European systems, and most
particularly West Germany's,
which by Communist definition
represented a dire threat to
European and world peace.
Today, Soviet and East
European regimes think nothing
of dickering with West Germany
in the hope of invigorating an
East-West trade.
Czechoslovakia, under one of
the most regressive and repressive
regimes in the Soviet bloc, throws
out hints about its willingness to
import U.S. consumer technology.
Bulgaria, long the little echo of
big Russia, recently sent its
foreign minister to the United
States to talk of how nice it
would be for Bulgaria to have the
status of a most-favored nation in
trade with Americans. The Greek
colonels' regime no longer looks
so bad to the Bulgarians who, like
other bloc regimes, are moving to
mend relations there.
Romania, the pioneer in 1969
by receiving President Nixon on a
state visit, has been free-wheeling
for a long time and was the first in
the bloc to make friends with
Germany, Greece and other
countries on the Communist
taboo list.
Puritanically Leninist on the
home front, the Romanian regime
became the only Soviet bloc
nation to be a member of the
International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development
and of the International Monetary
Fund. It has been angling for
special treatment in the Common
Market, while throwing out lures
to attract Western investment
money.
Moscow's Incredible Deals
If all that was heresy, Moscow
could hardly complain. The
Kremlin has been making
incredible deals, including one for
bottling and distributing
Pepsi-Cola in the U.S.S.R.
Moscow offers concessions for
development of Soviet resources.
It displays eagerness to get hold of
Western consumer technologies.
All this obviously is aimed at
putting some zip into a drab
consumer economy.
At the same time the Kremlin
seems to detect danger of
contamination. It wants security
— not so much military security as
safety from outside influences as
it imports outside goods and
methods. It wants to keep its
public safe from "harmful
bourgeois influences."
This explains Moscow's
performance at the talks that are
supposed to lead to a European
Security Conference. The West

It displays eagerness to get hold of
Western consumer technologies.
All this obviously is aimed at
putting some zip into a drab
consumer economy.
At the same time the Kremlin
seems to detect danger of
contamination. It wants security
— not so much military security as
safety from outside influences as
it imports outside goods and
methods. It wants to keep its
public safe from "harmful
bourgeois influences."
This explains Moscow's
performance at the talks that are
supposed to lead to a European
Security Conference. The West
has said that any security
arrangement should include free
flow of persons, ideas and
information across borders. The
idea is unthinkable in Moscow,
but the Kremlin has found a
response.
As Moscow Pravda put it,
Moscow is perfectly willing to
accept anything but
"misanthropic ideas, anticulture,
propaganda of fascism, racism or
enmity among peoples, slander
and pornography."
As for the West, it said,
"welcome." But there would be
no rest. Those categories can
cover the widest range of ideas
and make it certain nothing but
Soviet-approved ideas penetrates
the bloc.
Funny things are happening on
the road to communism.
Those responsible for the
purity of Marxism-Leninism are
standing theory on its head but
insisting all the while that nothing
of the sort could ever possibly
happen.
Leaders who shrilly denounced
Western and American bankers
eagerly welcome a friend from
Chase Manhattan now.
Leaders who painted U.S.
industry as the image of
devil-imperialist incarnate are
bringing their own people into the
Pepsi generation.
Leaders who solemnly warned
former colonial countries of the
perils of Western investment are
straining for ways to lure Western
money to their own lands.
Western Capitalists Welcome
Economic officials shuttle
between Communist and Western
worlds looking for likely capitalist
techniques to apply to their own
economies. Their countries
welcome a flock of capitalists
from the West sounding out trade
prospects.
In terms of deference, highly
placed Russian Communists quote
from such unlikely sources as the
Morgan Guaranty Trust Co.
reports, the analyses of Business
Week and various U.S. capitalists'
remarks.
Where, in fact, can the faithful
look today for a truly untainted
proletarian leadership?
To China? The Peking leaders
not only are competing, but are
taking positions that would have
been unthinkable ideological sins
a short time ago: for example,
supporting the idea that the
European Common Market is a
positive and necessary
development.
To Albania? Not so. Remote
and hostile as it has long been, foe
of the "Soviet social imperialists"
as well as the West, Albania is
softening.. It is even making
gestures to its longtime enemy,
Greece, and the right-wing
government there, mending
relations to the extent of
concluding a new trade
agreement.
Tito Turnabout
Responding to Stalin's baton,
the whole Communist world once
chorused denunciation of Tito's
Yugoslavia as a deviant from

Moscow's notions of acceptable
Leninsism.
Today not one of them says a
word publicly against the
spectacle of Yugoslavia signing
contracts right and left with
private businessmen in the West,

agreeing to U.S. protection of
American private investment in
Yugoslavia, liberalizing laws to
lure foreign money, even
suggesting they might bend the
Yugoslav constitution in the
matter of foreign ownership.

Once a mere mention of the
Rockefeller name sent the party
rushing to defend the ramparts.
Today, David Rockefeller,
chairman of the Chase Manhattan
Bank, talks business head to head
with Hungarian and Yugoslav

Communists in Belgrade.
There was a time when a Soviet
bloc regime would never overlook
an opportunity to lambaste all
West European systems, and most
particularly West Germany's,
which by Communist definition
represented a dire threat to
European and world peace.
Today, Soviet and East
European regimes think nothing
of dickering with West Germany
in the hope of invigorating an
East-West trade.
Czechoslovakia, under one of
the most regressive and repressive
regimes in the Soviet bloc, throws
out hints about its willingness to
import U.S. consumer technology.
Bulgaria, long the little echo of
big Russia, recently sent its
foreign minister to the United
States to talk of how nice it
would be for Bulgaria to have the
status of a most-favored nation in
trade with Americans. The Greek
colonels' regime no longer looks
so bad to the Bulgarians who, like
other bloc regimes, are moving to
mend relations there.
Romania, the pioneer in 1969
by receiving President Nixon on a
state visit, has been free-wheeling
for a long time and was the first in
the bloc to make friends with
Germany, Greece and other
countries on the Communist
taboo list.
Puritanically Leninist on the
home front, the Romanian regime
became the only Soviet bloc
nation to be a member of the
International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development
and of the International Monetary
Fund. It has been angling for
special treatment in the Common
Market, while throwing out lures
to attract Western investment
money.
Moscow's Incredible Deals
If all that was heresy, Moscow
could hardly complain. The
Kremlin has been making
incredible deals, including one for
bottling and distributing
Pepsi-Cola in the U.S.S.R.
