# Spirits Stir In San Jose?

SAN JOSE — It looks like Disneyland gone
awry — the Cinderella castle with a manic
touch.
Containing 160 rooms, covering six acres,
the Winchester Mystery House is a massive
monument to the spirit-haunted eccentric,
Sarah L. Winchester.
Now the house is faded — a grey jumble of
Victorian cupolas and gables. Ten thousand
windows stare bleakly at the surrounding urban
sprawl and watch as curious tourists approach
to pay $1.75 for a guided tour through the
labyrinth within.
But still an eerie aura remains.
Looking Back
To understand the Mystery House, the visitor
must understand the troubled mind of its long
dead former owner. A widow of the Winchester
Rifle manufacturer's son, Sarah L. Winchester
claimed to have contact with both good and
evil spirits — the good were those of her
deceased husband and child; the evil belonged
to all the victims of the Winchester repeating
automatic rifle.
To confuse the avenging evil spirits, Sarah
had a crew of carpenters construct doors that
opened to blank walls, stairs that lead to
nowhere. All posts and columns in her house
were inverted, in accordance with ancient
Egyptian custom, to ward off unfriendly spirits.
Sarah believed thirteen to be her lucky
number, so rooms had thirteen windows,
ceilings thirteen panels. Thirteen bathrooms
were spaced through the house each containing
a basin with thirteen drain holes. Chandeliers
displayed thirteen lights; staircases rose thirteen
steps.
Trap doors and secret passageways cut

through the house — their purpose remains
unknown.
Looking Beyond
Although Sarah Winchester claimed direct
knowledge of a world beyond, she hoped never
to enter that world. A spiritualist informed her
that as long as she kept a building project going
she would not die. And so for thirty-six years
carpenters worked busily on the Winchester
House making it perhaps the largest private
home in the world. The costs of building
materials alone came to one million dollars.
Sarah Winchester used every room in her
gargantuan house. Choosing from among forty
bedrooms, she slept in a different location each
night and made a point of not telling her
servants which room she had chosen. Perhaps
she felt her secrecy gave added protection
against invading spirits.
Despite the continuous construction of new
additions to the house, Sarah Winchester died
half a century ago at the age of 85. She left her
bizarre mansion to a niece, who auctioned off
its furniture and sold what remained to a local
corporation. To empty the immense house of
its contents, 46 truckloads of furnishings were
carted away each day for six and one half
weeks.
Under the corporation's control the house
was opened to the public, and it remains that
way today.
Wallpaper peels from its walls; clumps of
plaster fall to the floor. Glowing dully, light
filters through doors of Tiffany glass. Many
rooms are unfinished, remaining in the same
state they were in when the hammers stopped
beating some 50 years ago.
It looks like a haunted house.
And maybe it is. If so, surely the ghost of
Sarah Winchester wanders there.
