# Trinitarian Fathers Recruit In 'Rolling Stone'
## 
### Associated Press 
GARRISON, Md. - The
Trinitarian Fathers, who had
notable success in recruiting
candidates for the priesthood
from the world of swingers, now
are turning their search to
devotees of rock.
The Trinitarians once
advertised for potential priests in
Playboy magazine. Now the order

has taken an advertisement in
Rolling Stone, a biweekly journal
that concerns itself primarily with
the world of rock music.
The Rev. Joseph Lupo,
director of vocations for the
Trinitarians, an eight-century old
Roman Catholic order, said he
was pleased with the response to
the Playboy ad.
"But Rolling Stone is
cheaper," he said in an interview.
Thousand Letters Received
Father Lupo said the January
1971 Playboy ad brought about a
thousand letters.
"About 700 were bona fide
inquiries. And of them, I still
correspond with about 200 with

still more potential," he said.
The advertisement, he said,
"provided the best year we ever
had, the biggest year we ever
had."
Father Lupo said 27 men
recruited by the Playboy ad are
now studying for the priesthood.
Recruiting six novitiates a year is
considered good by the order,
which has chaplains in prisons,
hospitals and orphanages and also
teaches in some high schools.
It is still too early to judge the
Rolling Stone response, he said,
since the newspaper has been on
the newsstands for only two
weeks.

"I really believe, really and
truly, that a lot of people, not just
young kids, will commit
themselves to a life of sacrifice if
they believe in the commitment,"
he said.
"If I want to talk to them, I
have to go where they are," he
said.
Father Lupo said he has
advertised "in every Catholic
magazine and newspaper in the
country, every college newspaper
except the very small ones and
where there are more girls than
boys, servicemen's magazines like
the Navy Times, Newswell, Time
and Life.
"I put a half-page ad in the

Philadelphia area edition of Life
and all I got to write to me was a
62-year old minister," he said.
Many non-Catholics responded
to the Playboy ad and promising
candidates were directed to
seminaries of their own religions
â€” including one Jew who is now
studying to be a rabbi, Father
Lupo said.
He said so many United
Church of Christ members were
sent along to their own church
that 17 United Church of Christ
leaders came to the Trinitarian
monastery for a one-day
conference on recruiting
techniques.
