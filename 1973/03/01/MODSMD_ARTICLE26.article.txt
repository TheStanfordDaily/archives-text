Editor:
There are two errors in the
passage referring to me in your
Entertainment Section article
entitled "Poetry Reading" in
today's issue. Those of us who are
doing the reading appreciate the
Daily coverage — and in these lean
days for University publishing, the
Stanford Press appreciates all the
free publicity it can get — but I do
think the facts should be straight
and would be grateful if you
would print the following
clarification — or my letter:
1) I did attend Stanford at one
time (M.A., 1967), but am not
now a student.
2) Instead I work as an editor

at the Stanford University Press,
which is not a publication as the
holdfast treatment in the article
would indicate, but a publisher.
I am the Stanford editor and
this year's over-all editor for a
new review of literature and the
arts called Stonecloud, as the
article indicated, and would like
to invite all members of the
Stanford community to see and
buy it at the Stanford Bookstore
and other local bookstores.
Stonecloud No. 2 will be coming
out in March.
Sincerely yours,
Autumn Stanley
Assistant Editor
