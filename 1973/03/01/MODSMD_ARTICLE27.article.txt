# Stanford Museum Presents Neoclassicism Exhibit
## 
### HELEN BOYER 
The Stanford Museum is
presenting a show of Recent
Acquisitions. The exhibit
concentrates on a group of works
of the neoclassical era in 18th
century Europe. Also represented,
however, is art from other
cultures and times; Greek art,
German Expressionism of the
early 20th century, and
Pre-Columbian pottery, mainly
from Peru. In addition is a lively
circle of 16th and 17th century
Italian paintings.
Sound like a potpourri? Visit
the gallery, walk through it
slowly, and feel the air in the
room. The arrangement of the
exhibit creates a composition of
converging styles and cultural
attitudes, illustrating with great
finesse a particular view of the
way in which culture flows from
place to place and from time to
time. In this way, the gallery as a
whole is as much a work of art as
any of the individual expressions
it displays.
Neoclassicism is the focus of
the show, both physically and
intellectually. From a large
portrait of Lady Hamilton as
Hebe by Gavin Hamilton, an
important English artist of the
18th century, radiate streams of
neoclassical sentiment, which
pinpoint and reflect off various
works throughout the room.
Lived In Rome
Hamilton spent a great deal of
his life in Rome, and played a
pivotal role in the spread of
Neoclassicism to England. His
painting portrays a famous beauty
of the time in the pose of Hebe, a
Greek water-goddess. Lady
Hamilton was a sort of actress,
whose specialty was assuming
classical gestures called "poses
plastiques." She would present
these in a kind of dance at elegant
affairs in Italy.
Her performances were roughly
analogous to mime, or a highly

cultured version of charades. For
intellectuals of the late 18th
century, her poses represented the
most exemplary forms human
beauty could take; she staged the
Ideal. Many artists, in fact, made
active use of books filled with
illustrations of Lady Hamilton's
classical poses as a tool in
composing neoclassical paintings.
One such book is exhibited next
to Hamilton's work.
That Lady Hamilton later fell
into disrepute for her promiscuity
does not seem to have lessened
the importance of such
publications in furthering the
development of Neo-classicism.
"It was a way of communicating
ideas," said museum curator Dr.
Francois Forster-Hahn, "at a time
when there were no televisions,
movies, or photographs."
Reflections
Grouped around the Hamilton
painting are works of the same
period by John Flaxman, Thomas
Stothard, and Henry Fuseli, in
which the strings of Romanticism
are touched. Across the room
hangs another large English
neoclassical painting by William
Hamilton (no relation to Gavin)
Lavinia and Her Mother. This
painting was done as an
illustration for a book which is
shown with it, James Thomson's
The Seasons. This edition, which
used to belong to General
Cornwallis, represents one of the
major works of 18th century
book illustration.
Also exhibited is a sensitive
Portrait of a Young Artist by
Swiss painter Felix Maria Diogg
(1769-1834). Behind the young
artist stand casts of Greek statues
from which art students drew.
Across, a young lady, painted in
cameo profile by Frenchman
L o u is-Leopold Boilly
(1761-1845), sits reading in a
delicate pastoral landscape; and
two Grecian-robed women and a
child gather round a set of

columns in a dramatic pencil and
wash sketch by Swiss artist,
Jean-Pierre Saint Ours
(1752-1809).
All these works reflect off the
case at one end of the room,
which contains ancient coins and
several Greek pots. Around that
end of the room also revolve a
group of Italian works, including

two magnificent Caravagesque
paintings and an important
drawing by 17th century master
Annibale Carracci.
19th and 20th Centuries
There is a number of
impressive prints and drawings
from 19th century France,
featuring a humorous drawing of
Hercules by caricaturist Honore

Daumier (1808-1879), and
important lithographs by
Gericault (1791-1824) and
Rudolphe Bresden (1825-1885).
Leading into the 20th century is a
small portrait head by Auguste
Rodin (1840-19 1 7).
A small but excellent group of
works by early 20th century
German Expressionists Emil
Nolde, Wassily Kandinsky, Max
Berkmann, and Oskar Kokoschka
are shown at the entrance to the
gallery. The interest these artists
had in the primitive arts is
reflected in a case of Penivian and
Mexican pottery, dating from as
far back as 600 B.C.
Upstairs in the contemporary
gallery are several' new works,
including a looming chrome Cross
by sculptor Kenneth Snelson, and
prints by Robert Indiana, Sam
Francis, and Frank Stella.
Careful Selection
The exhibit is praiseworthy in
its careful selection and
arrangement, which builds a
delicate and intricate web among
all these works. A presentation of
recent acquisitions is a
particularly difficult one to
organize coherently, and often
ends up as a hodgepodge. This
show has been visited and praised
by curators from major
institutions throughout the world.
It is a remarkable achievement for
a university museum, especially
one which works from an
extremely limited budget.
It is for financial reasons that
the Stanford Museum collection
focuses on prints and drawings.
All the money for the purchase of
these works was raised through
the strenuous efforts of the

Committee for Art at Stanford,
headed by Dr. Lorenz Eitner.
Visible, however, through this
focus is the thrill of collecting
works of truly fine quality, rather
than simply assembling mediocre
specimens of various styles, as
many university museums do.
"We're a study museum," as Dr.
Eitner sees it,"and in the belief
that only true works of art can
teach about art," his collecting of
the past eight or nine years has
been aimed at "having a museum

in which the objects are the best
of their kind."
Go visit this show. The energy
put into the collection and
arrangement of these works has
made it a delightful visual and
intellectual experience. The aims
of the museum staff are directed
toward students — and we are
foolish if we do not take
advantage of this offering. The
show lasts until May 15; the
Museum is open Tuesday-Friday
10-5 and Saturday and Sunday
1-5.

neoclassical painting by William
Hamilton (no relation to Gavin)
Lavinia and Her Mother. This
painting was done as an
illustration for a book which is
shown with it, James Thomson's
The Seasons. This edition, which
used to belong to General
Cornwallis, represents one of the
major works of 18th century
book illustration.
Also exhibited is a sensitive
Portrait of a Young Artist by
Swiss painter Felix Maria Diogg
(1769-1834). Behind the young
artist stand casts of Greek statues
from which art students drew.
Across, a young lady, painted in
cameo profile by Frenchman
L o u is-Leopold Boilly
(1761-1845), sits reading in a
delicate pastoral landscape; and
two Grecian-robed women and a
child gather round a set of

columns in a dramatic pencil and
wash sketch by Swiss artist,
Jean-Pierre Saint Ours
(1752-1809).
All these works reflect off the
case at one end of the room,
which contains ancient coins and
several Greek pots. Around that
end of the room also revolve a
group of Italian works, including

two magnificent Caravagesque
paintings and an important
drawing by 17th century master
Annibale Carracci.
19th and 20th Centuries
There is a number of
impressive prints and drawings
from 19th century France,
featuring a humorous drawing of
Hercules by caricaturist Honore

Daumier (1808-1879), and
important lithographs by
Gericault (1791-1824) and
Rudolphe Bresden (1825-1885).
Leading into the 20th century is a
small portrait head by Auguste
Rodin (1840-19 1 7).
A small but excellent group of
works by early 20th century
German Expressionists Emil
Nolde, Wassily Kandinsky, Max
Berkmann, and Oskar Kokoschka
are shown at the entrance to the
gallery. The interest these artists
had in the primitive arts is
reflected in a case of Penivian and
Mexican pottery, dating from as
far back as 600 B.C.
Upstairs in the contemporary
gallery are several' new works,
including a looming chrome Cross
by sculptor Kenneth Snelson, and
prints by Robert Indiana, Sam
Francis, and Frank Stella.
Careful Selection
The exhibit is praiseworthy in
its careful selection and
arrangement, which builds a
delicate and intricate web among
all these works. A presentation of
recent acquisitions is a
particularly difficult one to
organize coherently, and often
ends up as a hodgepodge. This
show has been visited and praised
by curators from major
institutions throughout the world.
It is a remarkable achievement for
a university museum, especially
one which works from an
extremely limited budget.
It is for financial reasons that
the Stanford Museum collection
focuses on prints and drawings.
All the money for the purchase of
these works was raised through
the strenuous efforts of the

Committee for Art at Stanford,
headed by Dr. Lorenz Eitner.
Visible, however, through this
focus is the thrill of collecting
works of truly fine quality, rather
than simply assembling mediocre
specimens of various styles, as
many university museums do.
"We're a study museum," as Dr.
Eitner sees it,"and in the belief
that only true works of art can
teach about art," his collecting of
the past eight or nine years has
been aimed at "having a museum

in which the objects are the best
of their kind."
Go visit this show. The energy
put into the collection and
arrangement of these works has
made it a delightful visual and
intellectual experience. The aims
of the museum staff are directed
toward students — and we are
foolish if we do not take
advantage of this offering. The
show lasts until May 15; the
Museum is open Tuesday-Friday
10-5 and Saturday and Sunday
1-5.

NEW EXHIBIT PIECE — Lady Hamilton as Hebe by English artist

Europe, will run until May 15.

BOILLY OIL PAINTING — "Young Lady Reading in a Landscape,"
painted in cameo profile by Louis-Leopold Boilly (1761-1845), is one
of the pieces now on exhibition in the Stanford Museum's show of
"Recent Acquisitions."
The Stanford Museum is
presenting a show of Recent
Acquisitions. The exhibit
concentrates on a group of works
of the neoclassical era in 18th
century Europe. Also represented,
however, is art from other
cultures and times; Greek art,
German Expressionism of the
early 20th century, and
Pre-Columbian pottery, mainly
from Peru. In addition is a lively
circle of 16th and 17th century
Italian paintings.
Sound like a potpourri? Visit
the gallery, walk through it
slowly, and feel the air in the
room. The arrangement of the
exhibit creates a composition of
converging styles and cultural
attitudes, illustrating with great
finesse a particular view of the
way in which culture flows from
place to place and from time to
time. In this way, the gallery as a
whole is as much a work of art as
any of the individual expressions
it displays.
Neoclassicism is the focus of
the show, both physically and
intellectually. From a large
portrait of Lady Hamilton as
Hebe by Gavin Hamilton, an
important English artist of the
18th century, radiate streams of
neoclassical sentiment, which
pinpoint and reflect off various
works throughout the room.
Lived In Rome
Hamilton spent a great deal of
his life in Rome, and played a
pivotal role in the spread of
Neoclassicism to England. His
painting portrays a famous beauty
of the time in the pose of Hebe, a
Greek water-goddess. Lady
Hamilton was a sort of actress,
whose specialty was assuming
classical gestures called "poses
plastiques." She would present
these in a kind of dance at elegant
affairs in Italy.
Her performances were roughly
analogous to mime, or a highly

cultured version of charades. For
intellectuals of the late 18th
century, her poses represented the
most exemplary forms human
beauty could take; she staged the
Ideal. Many artists, in fact, made
active use of books filled with
illustrations of Lady Hamilton's
classical poses as a tool in
composing neoclassical paintings.
One such book is exhibited next
to Hamilton's work.
That Lady Hamilton later fell
into disrepute for her promiscuity
does not seem to have lessened
the importance of such
publications in furthering the
development of Neo-classicism.
"It was a way of communicating
ideas," said museum curator Dr.
Francois Forster-Hahn, "at a time
when there were no televisions,
movies, or photographs."
Reflections
Grouped around the Hamilton
painting are works of the same
period by John Flaxman, Thomas
Stothard, and Henry Fuseli, in
which the strings of Romanticism
are touched. Across the room
hangs another large English
neoclassical painting by William
Hamilton (no relation to Gavin)
Lavinia and Her Mother. This
painting was done as an
illustration for a book which is
shown with it, James Thomson's

show has been visited and praised
by curators from major
institutions throughout the world.
It is a remarkable achievement for
a university museum, especially
one which works from an
extremely limited budget.
It is for financial reasons that
the Stanford Museum collection
focuses on prints and drawings.
All the money for the purchase of
these works was raised through
the strenuous efforts of the

Committee for Art at Stanford,
headed by Dr. Lorenz Eitner.
Visible, however, through this
focus is the thrill of collecting
works of truly fine quality, rather
than simply assembling mediocre
specimens of various styles, as
many university museums do.
"We're a study museum," as Dr.
Eitner sees it,"and in the belief
that only true works of art can
teach about art," his collecting of
the past eight or nine years has
been aimed at "having a museum

in which the objects are the best
of their kind."
Go visit this show. The energy
put into the collection and
arrangement of these works has
made it a delightful visual and
intellectual experience. The aims
of the museum staff are directed
toward students — and we are
foolish if we do not take
advantage of this offering. The
show lasts until May 15; the
Museum is open Tuesday-Friday
10-5 and Saturday and Sunday
1-5.

NEW EXHIBIT PIECE — Lady Hamilton as Hebe by English artist
Gavin Hamilton is now on view at the Stanford Museum of Art. The
new exhibit, concentrating on the neoclassical era in 18th century
Europe, will run until May 15.

BOILLY OIL PAINTING — "Young Lady Reading in a Landscape,"
painted in cameo profile by Louis-Leopold Boilly (1761-1845), is one
of the pieces now on exhibition in the Stanford Museum's show of
"Recent Acquisitions."
The Stanford Museum is
presenting a show of Recent
Acquisitions. The exhibit
concentrates on a group of works
of the neoclassical era in 18th
century Europe. Also represented,
however, is art from other
cultures and times; Greek art,
German Expressionism of the
early 20th century, and
Pre-Columbian pottery, mainly
from Peru. In addition is a lively
circle of 16th and 17th century
Italian paintings.
Sound like a potpourri? Visit
the gallery, walk through it
slowly, and feel the air in the
room. The arrangement of the
exhibit creates a composition of
converging styles and cultural
attitudes, illustrating with great
finesse a particular view of the
way in which culture flows from
place to place and from time to
time. In this way, the gallery as a
whole is as much a work of art as
any of the individual expressions
it displays.
Neoclassicism is the focus of
the show, both physically and
intellectually. From a large
portrait of Lady Hamilton as
Hebe by Gavin Hamilton, an
important English artist of the
18th century, radiate streams of
neoclassical sentiment, which
pinpoint and reflect off various
works throughout the room.
Lived In Rome
Hamilton spent a great deal of
his life in Rome, and played a
pivotal role in the spread of
Neoclassicism to England. His
painting portrays a famous beauty
of the time in the pose of Hebe, a
Greek water-goddess. Lady
Hamilton was a sort of actress,
whose specialty was assuming
classical gestures called "poses
plastiques." She would present
these in a kind of dance at elegant
affairs in Italy.
Her performances were roughly
analogous to mime, or a highly

cultured version of charades. For
intellectuals of the late 18th
century, her poses represented the
most exemplary forms human
beauty could take; she staged the
Ideal. Many artists, in fact, made
active use of books filled with
illustrations of Lady Hamilton's
classical poses as a tool in
composing neoclassical paintings.
One such book is exhibited next
to Hamilton's work.
That Lady Hamilton later fell
into disrepute for her promiscuity
does not seem to have lessened
the importance of such
publications in furthering the
development of Neo-classicism.
"It was a way of communicating
ideas," said museum curator Dr.
Francois Forster-Hahn, "at a time
when there were no televisions,
movies, or photographs."
Reflections
Grouped around the Hamilton
painting are works of the same
period by John Flaxman, Thomas
Stothard, and Henry Fuseli, in
which the strings of Romanticism
are touched. Across the room
hangs another large English
neoclassical painting by William
Hamilton (no relation to Gavin)
Lavinia and Her Mother. This
painting was done as an
illustration for a book which is
shown with it, James Thomson's
The Seasons. This edition, which
used to belong to General
Cornwallis, represents one of the
major works of 18th century
book illustration.
Also exhibited is a sensitive
Portrait of a Young Artist by
Swiss painter Felix Maria Diogg
(1769-1834). Behind the young
artist stand casts of Greek statues
from which art students drew.
Across, a young lady, painted in
cameo profile by Frenchman
L o u is-Leopold Boilly
(1761-1845), sits reading in a
delicate pastoral landscape; and
two Grecian-robed women and a
child gather round a set of

columns in a dramatic pencil and
wash sketch by Swiss artist,
Jean-Pierre Saint Ours
(1752-1809).
All these works reflect off the
case at one end of the room,
which contains ancient coins and
several Greek pots. Around that
end of the room also revolve a
group of Italian works, including

two magnificent Caravagesque
paintings and an important
drawing by 17th century master
Annibale Carracci.
19th and 20th Centuries
There is a number of
impressive prints and drawings
from 19th century France,
featuring a humorous drawing of
Hercules by caricaturist Honore

Daumier (1808-1879), and
important lithographs by
Gericault (1791-1824) and
Rudolphe Bresden (1825-1885).
Leading into the 20th century is a
small portrait head by Auguste
Rodin (1840-19 1 7).
A small but excellent group of
works by early 20th century
German Expressionists Emil
Nolde, Wassily Kandinsky, Max
Berkmann, and Oskar Kokoschka
are shown at the entrance to the
gallery. The interest these artists
had in the primitive arts is
reflected in a case of Penivian and
Mexican pottery, dating from as
far back as 600 B.C.
Upstairs in the contemporary
gallery are several' new works,
including a looming chrome Cross
by sculptor Kenneth Snelson, and
prints by Robert Indiana, Sam
Francis, and Frank Stella.
Careful Selection
The exhibit is praiseworthy in
its careful selection and
arrangement, which builds a
delicate and intricate web among
all these works. A presentation of
recent acquisitions is a
particularly difficult one to
organize coherently, and often
ends up as a hodgepodge. This
show has been visited and praised
by curators from major
institutions throughout the world.

whole is as much a work of art as
any of the individual expressions
it displays.
Neoclassicism is the focus of
the show, both physically and
intellectually. From a large
portrait of Lady Hamilton as
Hebe by Gavin Hamilton, an
important English artist of the
18th century, radiate streams of
neoclassical sentiment, which
pinpoint and reflect off various
works throughout the room.
Lived In Rome
Hamilton spent a great deal of
his life in Rome, and played a
pivotal role in the spread of
Neoclassicism to England. His
painting portrays a famous beauty
of the time in the pose of Hebe, a
Greek water-goddess. Lady
Hamilton was a sort of actress,
whose specialty was assuming
classical gestures called "poses
plastiques." She would present
these in a kind of dance at elegant
affairs in Italy.
Her performances were roughly
analogous to mime, or a highly

cultured version of charades. For
intellectuals of the late 18th
century, her poses represented the
most exemplary forms human
beauty could take; she staged the
Ideal. Many artists, in fact, made
active use of books filled with
illustrations of Lady Hamilton's
classical poses as a tool in
composing neoclassical paintings.
One such book is exhibited next
to Hamilton's work.
That Lady Hamilton later fell
into disrepute for her promiscuity
does not seem to have lessened
the importance of such
publications in furthering the
development of Neo-classicism.
"It was a way of communicating
ideas," said museum curator Dr.
Francois Forster-Hahn, "at a time
when there were no televisions,
movies, or photographs."
Reflections
Grouped around the Hamilton
painting are works of the same
period by John Flaxman, Thomas
Stothard, and Henry Fuseli, in
which the strings of Romanticism
are touched. Across the room
hangs another large English
neoclassical painting by William
Hamilton (no relation to Gavin)
Lavinia and Her Mother. This
painting was done as an
illustration for a book which is
shown with it, James Thomson's
The Seasons. This edition, which
used to belong to General
Cornwallis, represents one of the
major works of 18th century
book illustration.
Also exhibited is a sensitive
Portrait of a Young Artist by
Swiss painter Felix Maria Diogg
(1769-1834). Behind the young
artist stand casts of Greek statues
from which art students drew.
Across, a young lady, painted in
cameo profile by Frenchman
L o u is-Leopold Boilly
(1761-1845), sits reading in a
delicate pastoral landscape; and
two Grecian-robed women and a
child gather round a set of

columns in a dramatic pencil and
wash sketch by Swiss artist,
Jean-Pierre Saint Ours
(1752-1809).
All these works reflect off the
case at one end of the room,
which contains ancient coins and
several Greek pots. Around that
end of the room also revolve a
group of Italian works, including

two magnificent Caravagesque
paintings and an important
drawing by 17th century master
Annibale Carracci.
19th and 20th Centuries
There is a number of
impressive prints and drawings
from 19th century France,
featuring a humorous drawing of
Hercules by caricaturist Honore

Daumier (1808-1879), and
important lithographs by
Gericault (1791-1824) and
Rudolphe Bresden (1825-1885).
Leading into the 20th century is a
small portrait head by Auguste
Rodin (1840-19 1 7).
A small but excellent group of
works by early 20th century
German Expressionists Emil
Nolde, Wassily Kandinsky, Max
Berkmann, and Oskar Kokoschka
are shown at the entrance to the
gallery. The interest these artists
had in the primitive arts is
reflected in a case of Penivian and
Mexican pottery, dating from as
far back as 600 B.C.
Upstairs in the contemporary
gallery are several' new works,
including a looming chrome Cross
by sculptor Kenneth Snelson, and
prints by Robert Indiana, Sam
Francis, and Frank Stella.
Careful Selection
The exhibit is praiseworthy in
its careful selection and
arrangement, which builds a
delicate and intricate web among
all these works. A presentation of
recent acquisitions is a
particularly difficult one to
organize coherently, and often
ends up as a hodgepodge. This
show has been visited and praised
by curators from major
institutions throughout the world.
It is a remarkable achievement for
a university museum, especially
one which works from an
extremely limited budget.
It is for financial reasons that
the Stanford Museum collection
focuses on prints and drawings.
All the money for the purchase of
these works was raised through
the strenuous efforts of the

Committee for Art at Stanford,
headed by Dr. Lorenz Eitner.
Visible, however, through this
focus is the thrill of collecting
works of truly fine quality, rather
than simply assembling mediocre
specimens of various styles, as
many university museums do.
"We're a study museum," as Dr.
Eitner sees it,"and in the belief
that only true works of art can
teach about art," his collecting of
the past eight or nine years has
been aimed at "having a museum

in which the objects are the best
of their kind."
Go visit this show. The energy
put into the collection and
arrangement of these works has
made it a delightful visual and
intellectual experience. The aims
of the museum staff are directed
toward students — and we are
foolish if we do not take
advantage of this offering. The
show lasts until May 15; the
Museum is open Tuesday-Friday
10-5 and Saturday and Sunday
1-5.
