# Slick And False Production
## 'Heartbreak Kid' Proves Shallow 
### ELLEN KENESHEA 
"The Heartbreak Kid" is a film that wears
its emotions on its sleeve; it's "Love Story"
written by a sentimentalist gone sour. Though
the movie is slick and cute, its technical
facility cannot disguise its barren core.
"Heartbreak Kid" is brutal because it does
violence to the human psyche. Its characters
do not exist as people, but as selfish images or
thin reflections.
Neil Simon's screenplay details the
emotional vacuity of a young New Yorker
(Charles Grodin). He is first glimpsed
murmuring a sexual "hello there" to himself
in a mirror, followed by an immediate cut to a
bar where he breathes the same line at a
nearby girl (Jeannie Berlin).
She falls for it, and they get married.
Honeymooning in Miami Beach a few days
after their marriage, his bride abed with an
acute sunburn, Grodin discovers the girl of his
dreams (Cybill Shepherd) and decides to get a
divorce and get re-married, this time to the
right girl.
Slim Thread
Simon builds on this slim thread through a
series of vignettes which do not fill out his
characters, making them more understandable
and perhaps sympathetic, but rather
manipulate the audience into the proper
attitude at the right moment.

This works to a degree because Elaine May
directs with skill, moving her actors through
their paces without a break. It works also
because Berlin, and Eddie Albert and Audra
Lindley as Shepherd's parents respond
credibly and with humor to their situations.
But as a whole the film doesn't work because
its premises are insufficiently justified — there
isn't any way to care about what happens to
the characters one way or the other.
Berlin, who is May's daughter in real life,
gives an accomplished performance as a nice
Jewish girl who vacillates between being
childishly annoying and goadingly mothering.
She is made to seem absurd from the moment
she's married, so that her husband's desertion
comes as a relief.
She keeps turning up with her face smeared
with goo — food, cream — clodding about
like something out of Hicksville, and the only
thing that isn't clear about her relationship
with her husband is why he should ever have
married her in the first place. It is much to
Berlin's credit that she manages to maintain a
modicum of respectability in spite of this.
Adds Feeling
Grodin himself plays the young husband
with something less than style and wit. Berlin
adds feeling to her part, but he reduces what
little nuance might be in his role to less than
that. He plays the husband as a youth who
spends his life posing without any reasons for

taking any one pose, or for changing it.
In the film, Shepherd is promised as reason
enough for a change — a sparkling Minnesota
blonde bunny with only a slight tendency to
bitchiness. Shepherd is convincing, but dull.
As her parents, Albert and Lindley add
spunk and life to the film. Lindley reacts to
each crisis in a beautifully comic, low-keyed
way.
Albert plays Father with gusto, coarseness
and sagacity to make a gruff man who ought
to be able to cope with anything. It comes as
a surprise that he loses out to Grodin finally,
since it is out of keeping with both their
characters.
But "Heartbreak Kid" works on
contrivances not characters. There is a scene
in the film in which Shepherd proposes a
game to Grodin to test his honorableness.
They will, she says strip and then get as close
to each other as they can without touching.
They do and he doesn't touch, so she declares
him to be an honorable man.
This is the same perverse view to which
"The Heartbreak Kid" itself subscribes, its
people exposing themselves not just
physically, but emotionally and intellectually
in a continual game only to prove that it
doesn't matter. There is no longer any relation
between the parts that make up the whole,
and nothing to hide or show that would make
any difference.
