Indians Hold Ten Hostages
WOUNDED KNEE, S.D. - Indians holding 10 hostages
and demanding to see two U.S. senators exchanged
gunfire briefly with federal marshals yesterday, a Bureau
of Indian Affairs official said.
There were no reports of injuries and an Indian
spokesman repeated earlier assurances that the hostages
would not be harmed by the demonstrators who had
control of this tiny community.
The BIA official said the shots came when a car
carrying several Indians from Wounded Knee stopped
about half a mile from a roadblock set up by the marshals.
He said the Indians — whose leaders said they were well
armed — emerged from the car firing rifles at the officers,
and the marshals returned the fire.
Indian leaders said there was other gunfire when
Indians warned off cars that came too close to the village.
Federal officers at the scene refused to discuss the shots
and say whether they were returned. Another BIA official
said only the Indians fired.
Spokesmen for the Indians said the occupying force
had grown from 200 when the trouble started to 400 by
yesterday afternoon. They also said a cease-fire had been
arranged with the FBI.
The Indians — including members of AIM and of the
Oglala Sioux tribe — held nine members of one family and
a Roman Catholic priest. They demanded that Sens.
Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts and J.W. Fulbright
of Arkansas, both Democrats, come to the
2500-square-mile Pine Ridge Reservation to discuss the
Indians' grievances.
Neither Kennedy nor Fulbright could be reached
immediately for comment.
The trouble allegedly started when the Indians broke
into a trading post in the town 140 miles southeast of
Rapid City and armed themselves with weapons and
supplies. Their demands included an investigation of the
dealings of the Department of the Interior and the Bureau
of Indian Affairs with the Oglala Sioux. They also sought
an ouster of the current leaders, including tribal chairman
Richard Wilson who has feuded with AIM members in the
past.

Heavy Turnout In Irish Vote
DUBLIN — The Irish turned out in heavy numbers under
a bright sun yesterday to decide whether to keep Jack
Lynch as prime minister for at least another five years.
The large turnout could spell danger for him.
The result won't be known until today, when the
tabulations start.
Party organizers forecast a near-record turnout of
perhaps 80 percent.
That, most Irish commentators believe, would be an
advantage for the opposition, a national coalition led by
52-year-old attorney Liam Cosgrave.
Lynch, 55, voted in Dublin, then sped to help his party
organization in Cork, where he fights his personal battle
for a place in the 144-seat Dail — Ireland's lower house.
He leads Fianna Fail, or Soldiers of Destiny, a party of
big business, farmers and workers which has held power
the past 16 years. He will return as prime minister if his
party wins a majority in the house.
In the 1969 election, Lynch's party won 75 seats,
including the nonvoting speaker, against 50 for Cosgrave's
middle-road Fine Gael, 18 for Labor and one
independent.
This time Fine Gael and Labor fought in coalition.
Their concentration on shopping-basket issues clearly
dented a government campaign first pitched on national
security and Lynch's record in keeping Northern Ireland's
troubles remote from the republic.
Ireland votes by a complicated system of proportional
representation and counting in some of the 42 multiseat
districts could take 48 hours or longer.
Witness Says Papers Not Harmful
LOS ANGELES — Holding a volume of the Pentagon
Papers in his hands, a retired Navy admiral told jurors at
the trial of Daniel Ellsberg and Anthony Russo: "It would
not injure the United States if this were in the hands of a
foreign government in 1969."
Retired Rear Adm. Gene Larocque, a former military
strategic planner, gave this assessment of three volumes of
the top-secret Pentagon study. His testimony was offered
as a direct attack on key government testimony by an
Army general during the prosecution case.
The government has sought to prove that Ellsberg and
Russo endangered the United States by copying the
Pentagon Papers in 1969. They are charged with
espionage, conspiracy and theft in connection with the
later release of the papers to news media.
But Larocque, the first defense witness, said the
possibility of harm to the country from the release of
three volumes was nil. Most of the information, he said,
was "hopelessly out of date by 1969 and utterly useless."
Shockley Loses Civil Court Case
REDWOOD CITY — Stanford University Prof. William
Shockley, controversial for his theory that blacks are
genetically inferior to whites, has lost a civil court case to
a black attorney.
The case, heard Tuesday in San Mateo County
Municipal Court here, involved $4500 charged to
Shockley for repair of his 33-foot sailboat by the Palo
Alto Boat Works.
The firm, represented by attorney W. James Ware of
Palo Alto, won the full amount it asked plus court costs
from Shockley.
Shockley contended the boat repair work was too
expensive and took too long.
