# Employees Question Pay Hikes
## 
### LARRY FLEECE 
The proposed faculty and staff salary increases
included in the $74 million University operating budget
presented by Provost William F. Miller have come under
question by members of the United Stanford Employees
(USE).
In his presentation to the Faculty Senate last week.
Miller said that the proposed budget includes average
increases of five and one-fourth percent in salaries for
faculty and so called "exempt" staff members — mainly
those in supervisory and professional positions — and an
average increase of six percent for nonexempt staff
members.
But to USE members, these pay increases seem peculiar
in light of several recent personnel layoffs, most notably,
the proposed layoff of 80 employees at Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center (SLAC).
USE President Glenda Jones said yesterday that the
apparent contradiction between employee layoffs and

proposed salary increases was discussed in a general USE
membership meeting.
"We are now in the process of forming a delegation of
USE members to approach appropriate University officials
and discuss this discrepancy," Jones said. "Our goal is to
offer alternate proposals to employee layoffs."
Question Of Priorities
Mrs. Julia Harvey, USE member and a research
assistant at the Stanford Hospital who has been laid off
effective March 31, said that "it's simply a question of
University priorities."
"If the University has enough funds for general salary
increases, why can't it establish a fund to guard against
employee layoffs?" Harvey asked.
"We would like to see more innovative solutions to
these financial problems," said Harvey. "It's too simple to
just throw people out of their jobs."
But Emil Sarpa, University Director of
Personnel-Employee Relations, said that the situation is in
fact "tremendously complex." Sarpa explained that there
are essentially two separate University funds:
— The general operating fund, fed by tuition and some
investment earnings, which University officers can decide
how to spend; and
— The grant fund, fed by federal and privatecontracts
and grants, the money in which is donated for the
financing of specific research projects.
Sarpa emphasized that the recent employee layoffs
have occurred due to financial changes in the grant fund.
Although the total grant fund has increased over last year,
Sarpa said, each grant is bound for a specific purpose, and
when any one grant is not renewed, the project being
financed by that grant loses its funds.
Changing Priorities
"What's happening at the present time," said Sarpa, "is
a situation where many federal government priorities have
been changing.
"The University officials who administer the grant
fund must answer to government auditors, and must make
sure that grant funds are applied to the specific projects
for which they are intended," Sarpa said.
Sarpa explained that money from every grant fund is

placed under the individual University department for
which the research is intended. The department then uses
these funds to salary those personnel involved in the
project.
Specialized Staff
But when the funds run out, the department is faced
with the problem of a highly-specialized staff which it
must try to find work for. If the department cannot
shuffle its personnel into new positions, it contacts the
University personnel office.
Sarpa confessed that "we can't promise anything" in
the way of job security under grant-funded projects, but
he said that "we are doing all we can to help the
individual employee."
First, he said, the University tries to give employees as
much advance notice as possible if funds for their salaries
have expired.
Second, University employees who have been laid off
are given the highest priority for new suitable job
openings.
Finally, Sarpa's personnel office has begun a program
which actively solicits iob offers from private corporations
in the Stanford area.
"We are trying very hard to maintain stable
employment," said Sarpa.

Second, University employees who have been laid off
are given the highest priority for new suitable job
openings.

employment," said Sarpa.
The proposed faculty and staff salary increases
included in the $74 million University operating budget
presented by Provost William F. Miller have come under
question by members of the United Stanford Employees
(USE).
In his presentation to the Faculty Senate last week.
Miller said that the proposed budget includes average
increases of five and one-fourth percent in salaries for
faculty and so called "exempt" staff members — mainly
those in supervisory and professional positions — and an
average increase of six percent for nonexempt staff
members.
But to USE members, these pay increases seem peculiar
in light of several recent personnel layoffs, most notably,
the proposed layoff of 80 employees at Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center (SLAC).
USE President Glenda Jones said yesterday that the
apparent contradiction between employee layoffs and

proposed salary increases was discussed in a general USE
membership meeting.
"We are now in the process of forming a delegation of
USE members to approach appropriate University officials
and discuss this discrepancy," Jones said. "Our goal is to
offer alternate proposals to employee layoffs."
Question Of Priorities
Mrs. Julia Harvey, USE member and a research
assistant at the Stanford Hospital who has been laid off
effective March 31, said that "it's simply a question of
University priorities."
"If the University has enough funds for general salary
increases, why can't it establish a fund to guard against
employee layoffs?" Harvey asked.
"We would like to see more innovative solutions to
these financial problems," said Harvey. "It's too simple to
just throw people out of their jobs."
But Emil Sarpa, University Director of
Personnel-Employee Relations, said that the situation is in
fact "tremendously complex." Sarpa explained that there
are essentially two separate University funds:
— The general operating fund, fed by tuition and some
investment earnings, which University officers can decide
how to spend; and
— The grant fund, fed by federal and privatecontracts
and grants, the money in which is donated for the
financing of specific research projects.
Sarpa emphasized that the recent employee layoffs
have occurred due to financial changes in the grant fund.
Although the total grant fund has increased over last year,
Sarpa said, each grant is bound for a specific purpose, and
when any one grant is not renewed, the project being
financed by that grant loses its funds.
Changing Priorities
"What's happening at the present time," said Sarpa, "is
a situation where many federal government priorities have
been changing.
"The University officials who administer the grant
fund must answer to government auditors, and must make
sure that grant funds are applied to the specific projects
for which they are intended," Sarpa said.
Sarpa explained that money from every grant fund is

placed under the individual University department for
which the research is intended. The department then uses
these funds to salary those personnel involved in the
project.
Specialized Staff
But when the funds run out, the department is faced
with the problem of a highly-specialized staff which it
must try to find work for. If the department cannot
shuffle its personnel into new positions, it contacts the
University personnel office.
Sarpa confessed that "we can't promise anything" in
the way of job security under grant-funded projects, but
he said that "we are doing all we can to help the
individual employee."
First, he said, the University tries to give employees as
much advance notice as possible if funds for their salaries
have expired.
