# Pair Arraigned Today
## 
### 
Juniors Eric Braun Test and Lee Christian Spielier will
be arraigned today at the Palo Alto Municipal Court, on
charges of grand theft, forgery, conspiracy, and petty
theft. Charges before the Campus Judicial Panel (CJP) will
also be filed against the two in the near future, according
to prosecutor Jerry Halligan.
The pair, arrested Feb. 12 outside the Stores
Department building on campus, allegedly used
requisition forms stolen from the office of Manager of
Residences and Fraternities, Alan A. Cummings, to order
merchandise in the name of several fraternities.
Test and Spielier allegedly sold the merchandise after it
was forwarded from the University Stores Department.
Stanford Public Safety officers have turned the case
over to Santa Clara County investigators who are still
attempting to determine the total worth of merchandise
taken.
Although the figure is not yet known, one unofficial
estimate ran at $1000. Investigators are checking with
fraternities and other living groups for any additional bills
for unreceived merchandise.
Stolen articles include tools, toilet items, and electric
fans.
Three of the four criminal charges against Test and
Spielier are felonies and may have penalties of over one
year in state prison, according to Sgt. Jon Svilich of the
Santa Clara County Sheriff's Office.
CJP charges against Test and Spielier have been drawn
up by Halligan, but have not yet been officially filed with
CJP Chairman William Cohen.
