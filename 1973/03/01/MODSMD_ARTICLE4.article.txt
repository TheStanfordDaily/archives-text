# U.S., North Vietnamese Discuss Resumption Of POW Releases
## 
### 
SAIGON (AP)—The United States and
North Vietnam met today to discuss
the delayed release of American
prisoners of war, and the chief
Communist spokesman said U.S. POWs
would be released "perhaps soon, in a
few days."
No meeting of the four-party Joint
Military Commission had been
scheduled for today, but both the
United States and North Vietnam
convened a special emergency session.
The Communists demanded
security for their delegations, other
privileges and freedom of movement.
They also asked for liaison flights
between Saigon and Hanoi on a
regularly scheduled basis.
Sources close to the commission
said South Vietnam offered the
Communist side a C 47 on a regular
basis, but there was no immediate
response.

The chief Communist spokesman,
Bui Tin, said the North Vietnamese
delegation has been ordered by Hanoi
"to discuss urgent questions, including
the POW release issue."
Tin said Col. Hoang Hoa, a deputy
chief of the North Vietnamese
delegation, brought new instructions
from Hanoi. Hoa had been in Hanoi
for nine days, but returned to Saigon
yesterday afternoon and met with the
North Vietnamese delegation.
Tin said he thinks the POW
questions can be solved "if the other
side [United States] shows good
faith."
U.S. Pulls Mine Sweepers
Yesterday the United States pulled
a Navy mine sweeping force away
from Haiphong and suspended troop
withdrawals from South Vietnam in
moves to force the Communist side to
resume releasing U.S. prisoners.

The actions were taken hours
before the White House announced
"every expectation" that Hanoi would
release more than 120 additional
prisoners sometime this week —
apparently based on assurances
obtained by Secretary of State William
P. Rogers at the Vietnam conference
in Paris.
They came as the international
body policing the Vietnam cease-fire
showed the first signs of a major split
over an American request to look into
alleged truce violations by Hanoi.
Charges Strain Agreement
A spokesman for the U.S.
delegation to the four-party Joint
Military Commission said the charges
of cease-fire violations and the stall in
prisoner releases put "serious strain"
on the peace agreement.
Underscoring the souring
atmosphere, the chief U.S. delegate
issued what was interpreted as a threat
of air attacks against Communist
missile sites that the United States
charges have been set up in violation
of the cease-fire.
Maj. Gen. Gilbert N. Woodward
warned that the United States
"reserves the right with its allies to
take such actions as it deems
appropriate" if the North Vietnamese
refuse to dismantle them.
Missiles Sendings Denied
North Vietnam has denied the
missiles came down from the North
since the cease-fire, saying the Viet
Cong have had SAM 2 missiles in the
far northern area for some time.
But the United States claimed its
photo reconnaisance showed that

Hanoi slipped the Soviet-made missiles
into the South after the Jan. 28 truce
date. It asked the International
Commission of Control and
Supervision to investigate.
Canada and Indonesia, the U.S.
allies on the international body, voted
to respond and send an investigating
team to Khe Sanh, the former Marine
combat base below the demilitarized
zone where U.S. authorities said the
missiles were installed.
New POW List Set
The chief North Vietnamese
spokesman in Saigon, Bui Tin, told
newsmen his delegation has a list of
the next group of U.S. war prisoners
to be released but will not turn it over
pending "new instructions" from
Hanoi.
U.S. officials pressed the North
Vietnamese in Saigon and Paris to
resume the prisoner release
immediately. They claimed Hanoi
already is behind schedule and also has
violated the peace agreement by not
maintaining the prisoner releases at a
rate equal to the rate of U.S. troop
withdrawals.
Secretary of State William P.
Rogers, in Paris for the international
Vietnam conference, urgently
demanded more releases in a meeting
with the North Vietnamese foreign
minister, Nguyen Duy Trinh. It was
soon after this meeting that the White
House expressed confidence more
prisoners will be out this week.
Hanoi and the Viet Cong have
released 163 U.S. prisoners, but 422
remain captive in North Vietnam,
South Vietnam and Laos.

Missiles Sendings Denied
North Vietnam has denied the
missiles came down from the North
since the cease-fire, saying the Viet
Cong have had SAM 2 missiles in the
far northern area for some time.
But the United States claimed its
photo reconnaisance showed that

Hanoi slipped the Soviet-made missiles
into the South after the Jan. 28 truce
date. It asked the International
Commission of Control and
Supervision to investigate.
Canada and Indonesia, the U.S.
allies on the international body, voted
to respond and send an investigating
team to Khe Sanh, the former Marine
combat base below the demilitarized
zone where U.S. authorities said the
missiles were installed.
New POW List Set
The chief North Vietnamese
spokesman in Saigon, Bui Tin, told
newsmen his delegation has a list of
the next group of U.S. war prisoners
to be released but will not turn it over
pending "new instructions" from
Hanoi.
U.S. officials pressed the North
Vietnamese in Saigon and Paris to
resume the prisoner release
immediately. They claimed Hanoi
already is behind schedule and also has
violated the peace agreement by not
maintaining the prisoner releases at a
rate equal to the rate of U.S. troop
withdrawals.
Secretary of State William P.
Rogers, in Paris for the international
Vietnam conference, urgently
demanded more releases in a meeting
with the North Vietnamese foreign
minister, Nguyen Duy Trinh. It was
soon after this meeting that the White
House expressed confidence more
prisoners will be out this week.
Hanoi and the Viet Cong have
released 163 U.S. prisoners, but 422
remain captive in North Vietnam,
South Vietnam and Laos.
SAIGON (AP)—The United States and
North Vietnam met today to discuss
the delayed release of American
prisoners of war, and the chief
Communist spokesman said U.S. POWs
would be released "perhaps soon, in a
few days."
No meeting of the four-party Joint
Military Commission had been
scheduled for today, but both the
United States and North Vietnam
convened a special emergency session.
The Communists demanded
security for their delegations, other
privileges and freedom of movement.
They also asked for liaison flights
between Saigon and Hanoi on a
regularly scheduled basis.
Sources close to the commission
said South Vietnam offered the
Communist side a C 47 on a regular
basis, but there was no immediate
response.

The chief Communist spokesman,
Bui Tin, said the North Vietnamese
delegation has been ordered by Hanoi
"to discuss urgent questions, including
the POW release issue."
Tin said Col. Hoang Hoa, a deputy
chief of the North Vietnamese
delegation, brought new instructions
from Hanoi. Hoa had been in Hanoi
for nine days, but returned to Saigon
yesterday afternoon and met with the
North Vietnamese delegation.
Tin said he thinks the POW
questions can be solved "if the other
side [United States] shows good
faith."
U.S. Pulls Mine Sweepers
Yesterday the United States pulled
a Navy mine sweeping force away
from Haiphong and suspended troop
withdrawals from South Vietnam in
moves to force the Communist side to
resume releasing U.S. prisoners.

The actions were taken hours
before the White House announced
"every expectation" that Hanoi would
release more than 120 additional
prisoners sometime this week —
apparently based on assurances
obtained by Secretary of State William
P. Rogers at the Vietnam conference
in Paris.
They came as the international
body policing the Vietnam cease-fire
showed the first signs of a major split
over an American request to look into
alleged truce violations by Hanoi.
