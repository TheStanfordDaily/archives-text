# Cedric X Raps White Philosophy
## 
### BILL WEINSTEIN 
Cedric X (Clark), assistant professor
of psychology and communication,
stared intently through his
wire-rimmed glasses. "My concern is
that the western white thinkers in this
country are making genocidal kinds of
moves on a people whose thinking
they can't understand."
So began a series of verbal
fireworks from the controversial Black
Muslim scholar. In his four years here,
X has challenged Electrical
Engineering Prof. William Shockley's
views on race and intelligence,
embroiled himself in the dispute over

the dismissal of a fellow black
psychology professor, Dubois P.
McGee, and made national headlines
for an "experiment" involving
discrimination against white students
in one of his classes.
Blunt and outspoken, X attacks
Shockley's "western philosophy of
science" as a "perceived threat toward
blacks." He described this philosophy
as "solely and exclusively
materialistic," unable to recognize
emotions or the "spirit" of man.
"Western science looks at facts, but
only looks at certain facts; it doesn't
look at someone having the experience

of clairvoyance or precognition," he
says. Instead, he charges, westerners
dismiss such concepts as
"metaphysical nonsense."
Invalid Judgments
X argues that because of this
"materialistic" philosophy, Western
scientists and particularly geneticists,
have used their positions to make
invalid judgments.
"What the geneticists and what
Shockley have done is that they say,
'We have enough knowledge to counsel
people,'" he says."The knowledge
they do have is manifestly in error."

HELLO, DOLLIES — While prospective members of the Dolly squad practiced their routines in Maples Pavilion
yesterday, several residents of Adelfa House in Lagunita showed up carrying signs reading "Men's Lib" and "Off Female
Chauvinism." The reason? Adelfa resident Jim Rosskopf, who's trying out for the Dollies. Said one picketer: "We're here
for moral support ... he fßosskopf) has been taking a lot of flack.' Said another prospective Dolly of Rosskopf: "He's
got some good moves."
X received his doctorate from
Michigan State and spent two years in
Nigeria as a Peace Corps volunteer. He
looks like a sedate scholar — anything
but a militant. But the walls of his
office are covered with posters
reflecting his beliefs in black
separatism, black power, and the
teachings of the Honorable Elijah
Muhammed, leader of the Black
Muslim movement of which X intends
to become a minister.
Whites Are 'Devils'
"There has never been anything
good in science based on the atheistic
mind," X claims. Noting that the
white people make up a minority of
the world's population, he asserted
that whites are "devils" whose
"actions were some of the worst in the
history of man."
X described Shockley as a "tool" of
racist white Stanford professors and
disputed his hypothesis that whites are
more intelligent than blacks. X says he
has concluded that those with the
most black genes were the most
intelligent.
"This does not mean that a black
person will score higher on an
intelligence test; this does not mean
that he will be admitted to Stanford
University," he says. "In fact I think
some of the dumbest black people in
the country are those who come to
Stanford University."
Blacks Must Learn Skills
X admits that blacks must "learn
technological skills in order for the
black people to operate in a
technological society." But blacks in
the social sciences and humanities are
"wasting their time, wasting black
taxpayers' money, and are a detriment
to black people's advancement."
X regards his stay at Stanford as a
personal waste of time, but calls his
own position in the social sciences a
place "to articulate the issues." When
he feels he has accomplished that, he

plans to leave.
X feels that many white professors
are hostile to him, and that he may be
pressured to leave soon. "The
Psychology Department has a habit of
firing black professors; they fired
McGee because he had fewer
Caucasian genes," he charges.
Atkinson's Views
Richard Atkinson, chairman of the
Psychology Department, disagrees,
calling the fact that X was re-hired to a
second three-year term here a
"positive indicator."
"I haven't detected any hostility"
in the department, Atkinson
continues. "I feel very warm to Cedric.
Emotionally I feel very close to him."
An avowed black separatist, X
believes that "it is unintelligent for
black people to integrate into white
society."
Last year X came under attack for
alleged discrimination against white
students which caused most of them
to drop his class on race and
communications. X calls his tactics an

experiment in reverse prejudice.
Atkinson disliked the experiment,
but discounts its importance. "The
incident was blown out of
proportion," he comments.
Psychology Prof. Philip Zimbardo
says he has no objections to his
colleague's teaching methods, adding
that X's actions were needed to form a
class where black students could
associate with each other without
outside influences.
One of X's primary interests now is
critiquing western scientific thought.
"There's no moral justification for the
type of activities going on in the name
of science," he says, suggesting that
some genetic researchers be brought to
trial.
"These people [the geneticists] are
sick, their egos are so much a part of
them that I vacillate between feeling
sorry for them and getting very angry
with them."
"A fool's to be pitied, you know,
but when a fool has so much power,
he can destroy," X concludes.
