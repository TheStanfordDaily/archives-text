# Cedric X Raps White Philosophy
## 
### BILL WEINSTEIN 
Cedric X (Clark), assistant professor
of psychology and communication,
stared intently through his
wire-rimmed glasses. "My concern is
that the western white thinkers in this
country are making genocidal kinds of
moves on a people whose thinking
they can't understand."
So began a series of verbal
fireworks from the controversial Black
Muslim scholar. In his four years here,
X has challenged Electrical
Engineering Prof. William Shockley's
views on race and intelligence,
embroiled himself in the dispute over

the dismissal of a fellow black
psychology professor, Dubois P.
McGee, and made national headlines
for an "experiment" involving
discrimination against white students
in one of his classes.
Blunt and outspoken, X attacks
Shockley's "western philosophy of
science" as a "perceived threat toward
blacks." He described this philosophy
as "solely and exclusively
materialistic," unable to recognize
emotions or the "spirit" of man.
"Western science looks at facts, but
only looks at certain facts; it doesn't
look at someone having the experience

of clairvoyance or precognition," he
says. Instead, he charges, westerners
dismiss such concepts as
"metaphysical nonsense."
Invalid Judgments
X argues that because of this
"materialistic" philosophy, Western
scientists and particularly geneticists,
have used their positions to make
invalid judgments.
"What the geneticists and what
Shockley have done is that they say,
'We have enough knowledge to counsel
people,'" he says."The knowledge
they do have is manifestly in error."

HELLO, DOLLIES — While prospective members of the Dolly squad practiced their routines in Maples Pavilion
yesterday, several residents of Adelfa House in Lagunita showed up carrying signs reading "Men's Lib" and "Off Female
Chauvinism." The reason? Adelfa resident Jim Rosskopf, who's trying out for the Dollies. Said one picketer: "We're here
for moral support ... he fßosskopf) has been taking a lot of flack.' Said another prospective Dolly of Rosskopf: "He's
got some good moves."
