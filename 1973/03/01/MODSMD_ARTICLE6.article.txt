## Hitching 
### 
An admittedly unscientific survey conducted by a UC-Santa Cruz
graduate student over the past year showed that out of 68 women
interviewed, 47 had been raped, assaulted, or victims of attempted
rape while hitchhiking.
The families and friends of four Santa Cruz area women who were
recently murdered while hitchhiking wouldn't dispute the dangers
pointed up by this study. And last week in Santa Cruz, very few
women could be observed hitchhiking. But elsewhere, many women
continue to hitchhike, and the reduction seen in Santa Cruz will very
likely be short-lived.
Most surprising is the attitude of those UCSC women students who
intend to stop hitchhiking until suspects in those murders and a
number of rapes are captured. Anyone who would believe that the
capture of one or two murderers or rapists rules out the possibility of
other people committing similar crimes is incredibly naive. In fact,
most law enforcement authorities agree that one of their biggest fears
during a string of rapes or murders is that such acts may bring out
more closet psychotics.
Even Here
A few years ago, rape was becoming a fairly serious problem on
this campus. Quite a few attacks along Palm Drive were reported, but
a number of steps were taken which have eased the problem
considerably. Better lighting was installed along the drive; more
frequent police patrols were instituted; self-defense classes were
organized for women; and an education campaign was launched so
that fewer women would walk along the drive alone at night.
Self-defense courses are a good idea for everyone, but they should
not lead to overconfidence. UCSC student Alice Liu may have felt
safe hitchhiking because she knew karate, but her brutal murder
should point up the fallacy of such thinking.
Self-defense knowledge is valuable, but it will not always be
sufficient to overcome a determined, armed assailant. Liu's death
should clearly illustrate that even those women who are very well
trained in self-defense should not place themselves in the jeopardy
which comes with hitchhiking.
Chauvinism?
Advising women not to hitchhike might smack of male chauvinism
to some people. But such a knee-jerk response would probably come
only from those self-acclaimed "liberated" women who substitute
cliched rhetoric for real liberation. A truly liberated woman does not
need to prove her liberation by risking her life on the side of the road.
I consider rapists to be the most extreme product of a
male-dominated society. And any woman who willingly makes herself
extremely vulnerable to these worst of all male chauvinist pigs isn't
really liberated. She's just plain stupid.
I certainly wouldn't eat a certain brand of soup shortly after some
of my friends died from botulism due to contaminated cans of that
soup. I would think that the brutal murders of four women
hitchhikers would have a similar affect on any woman who learned of
their deaths. But I'm sure that before the week is over, I'll see many
women out hitchhiking who have heard about those killings.
