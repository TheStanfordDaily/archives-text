# Semantic Chauvinism
## Liberate Language 
###

The shady business of
conscious and unconscious,
institutionalized and free-form
discrimination, retribution and
subconstitution against women
has finally reached its
much-deserved airing in the wake
of society's recently-heightened
awareness. But one facet of this
forced subjugation which is only
now being examined is the
language barrier which has been
devilishly constructed to separate
women from equality in the real
world. 1
In this article so far, many
transgressions, though miniscule,
have no doubt passed your eye
and slipped into your murky
subconscious. Take the word
"the" for example. Next to its
innocent cohort "a," "the" is
used with more procreativity than
any other word in the entire
English language.
Let's see what is in the word
that strikes such a devastating
blow to the female psychic. Just
look at its out and out sexist
construction! The letter "t"
followed by "he." What more
need be said? Can anyone fail to
see what a different world this
would be if "the" had been
replaced by "tshe" or a more
neutral word years ago? An
accomplice to this heinous article
of crime is "this." Why not
"ther"? But no, wordtolimists
scaffle and guffort in their
pseudo-intellectuality, and despite
a feigned expression of concern, it
is all too late, for the damage is
done.
Demonic Constructitude
And why must the words
"female" and "woman" be mere
offshots of their masculine
counterparts "male" and "man"?
No shortage of letter power could
have precipitated such a demonic
constructitude. But adversely,
why must she (another truncated
offshoot) be forced into
similaritude (her dog went to see
her)? And why must the male be
loquaciously lavished upon (his
dog went to him)? Can anyone
doubt that this double use of the
female objective case hammers
home the point that a woman is
no more than an object? Refuse
her a possessivity, and you deny
her very existence!
And why must the young girl
be thrust into a world where she
must sing hymns in church each
Sunday? Can it be that the
eschelons of ecclesiastic authority
are unable to sing a note of a
hyrr? How could they have kept
us blind for so long?
Meanwhile, in our very own
country, Uncle Sam (why not
Aunt Ruth?) and the U.S.
Government back the matter by
institutionalized inter-personal
communications distributed into
your home daily in the form of
the U.S. Mail\ Why not make that

into the U.S. Femail, or Letter
Carriers Unlimited? (Some suspect
that the avoidance of uttering,
"Did the Femail come today?" is
inextricably intertwined with the
myth of the female orgasm.) Must
our children be force fed with
these matters as if it were a daily
dosage of cod liver oil?
Out of Hand
But the governmental hand is
not only seen in this service. The
Weather Bureau steps in, telling us
sporadically of the dangers
looming in a future hurricane.
And children sit before a TV set
and see the damage a hurricane
can do, while unconsciously being
told of the destructiveness of the
stormy female psyche. Why not a
himmicane named Richard? Why
always Maria, Bertha? Would you
buy a used car from that man?
Let us also mention the
complicity of the TV industry in
all this. Their insidious canned

laughter repeats the sexist message
with titterings of HEHEHE. Never
HER-HER or even HE-HER-HE.
Surely some male chauvinist
reactionary pigs will leap into
their dictionaries and compile lists
of words they feel damage their
cherished male psyche. But words
like father, mother, dinner, and
supper (instead of fathim,
mothim, dinhim, suphim) only
serve to reinforce the stereotypes
pervading the constructs of a
female role structure in a
male-dominant society.
If You're Not
Scoff if you will, but if you're
not part of the problem, you're
part of the solution. And in the
end, this struggle will be written
in the important pages of history.
(Why not herstory, why is it
always him?)
Up against the wall, Funk &
Wagnall's!
