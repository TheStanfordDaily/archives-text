# 'We Need A Union'
## Why Layoffs? 
### 
Venceremos

So Stanford just cannot find the money to keep
Julia Harvey on? Well how come, then, Stanford can
find the money to give supervisors, professionals
and faculty the 5.1 percent raise they've just
announced?
The average faculty salary here is about
$20,000/yr. How can the administration find a
million dollars to fatten these salaries and at the
same time take the livelihoods away from not only
Julia, but about 100 workers at SLAC and the Med
Center this month, all the while pleading poverty?
"We just don't have the money," Come on now.
Who's the administration trying to fool? Last
month, side by side with news reports of regrettable
belt-tightening and lay-offs were articles on a $9.1
million dollar expansion of the hospital, $7.5
million for a new Med Center faiclity, a new, more
'permanent' computer building at SLAC and
monthly federal grants averaging $4 million to $5
million a month. Side by side in a recent Campus
Report on the SLAC layoffs was an article on
$400,000 for improvements on the stadium.
Whose Belt?
No one is arguing that some belt-tightening is
needed. The question is whose. It boils down to a
matter of priorities and workers at Stanford
apparently have a very low priority.
The administration has managed to raise $79
million in gifts and pledges in less than a year. Why
hasn't it tried to raise anything for laid-off workers?
Stanford has millions in emergency and slush funds
for all sorts of things. Why hasn't an emergency
fund been set up for workers facing lay-offs?
And finally, Stanford has a 'policy' of placing
laid off workers in other jobs. Why has it not
provided the staff and money and personnel
enforcement powers necessary to implement this
policy in spite of a lot of lip-service to it?
Unionize
The reason we have these contradictions, the
reason why workers have a low priority here and

why the administration doesn't live up to its own
policies is because Stanford thinks it can get away
with it. Let's face it.... To deal with this
administration workers here need a union.
No one is saying that a union will do everything.
It won't change the fact that in this country 20
percent of the population manages to rip off almost
50 percent of family income shares, while 80
percent have to share the other half.
It has been this way for a century and unions
haven't changed that. Only a revolution will. But it's
a simple fact that those workers who are organized
in unions get better benefits and wages. Just the
threat of a union here has undoubtedly played a
large part in the 6 percent wage increases for
non-exempt employees.
Getting Worse
We need a union not only to give us collective
bargaining in power in dealing with fair job
classifications, low wages and racist and sexist
practices, but we need one to just maintain our
current living standard. If you think things are
tough now economically for workers, don't worry.
They're going to get worse.
Food prices will continue to rise, returning vets
will compete for too few jobs, and layoffs will
continue as the government cuts back health,
education and welfare projects but maintains
military, agribusiness and oil subsidies. Some
economists have predicted a recession beginning
next winter.
Those workers who are unorganized will feel the
crunch the most. That's why we need a union here
now. If we had a union Stanford would have a damn
hard time laying off a worker who had been here for
25 years.
The administration is threatening to give Julia
the axe today, March 1. We ask that her fellow
workers, and students, faculty, and community
members as well, support her. Stop layoffs.

policy in spite of a lot of lip-service to it?
Unionize
The reason we have these contradictions, the
reason why workers have a low priority here and

why the administration doesn't live up to its own
policies is because Stanford thinks it can get away
with it. Let's face it.... To deal with this
administration workers here need a union.
No one is saying that a union will do everything.
It won't change the fact that in this country 20
percent of the population manages to rip off almost
50 percent of family income shares, while 80
percent have to share the other half.
It has been this way for a century and unions
haven't changed that. Only a revolution will. But it's
a simple fact that those workers who are organized
in unions get better benefits and wages. Just the
threat of a union here has undoubtedly played a
large part in the 6 percent wage increases for
non-exempt employees.
Getting Worse
We need a union not only to give us collective
bargaining in power in dealing with fair job
classifications, low wages and racist and sexist
practices, but we need one to just maintain our
current living standard. If you think things are
tough now economically for workers, don't worry.
They're going to get worse.
Food prices will continue to rise, returning vets
will compete for too few jobs, and layoffs will
continue as the government cuts back health,
education and welfare projects but maintains
military, agribusiness and oil subsidies. Some
economists have predicted a recession beginning
next winter.
Those workers who are unorganized will feel the
crunch the most. That's why we need a union here
now. If we had a union Stanford would have a damn
hard time laying off a worker who had been here for
25 years.
The administration is threatening to give Julia
the axe today, March 1. We ask that her fellow
workers, and students, faculty, and community
members as well, support her. Stop layoffs.

So Stanford just cannot find the money to keep
Julia Harvey on? Well how come, then, Stanford can
find the money to give supervisors, professionals
and faculty the 5.1 percent raise they've just
announced?
The average faculty salary here is about
$20,000/yr. How can the administration find a
million dollars to fatten these salaries and at the
same time take the livelihoods away from not only
Julia, but about 100 workers at SLAC and the Med
Center this month, all the while pleading poverty?
"We just don't have the money," Come on now.
Who's the administration trying to fool? Last
month, side by side with news reports of regrettable
belt-tightening and lay-offs were articles on a $9.1
million dollar expansion of the hospital, $7.5
million for a new Med Center faiclity, a new, more
'permanent' computer building at SLAC and
monthly federal grants averaging $4 million to $5
million a month. Side by side in a recent Campus
Report on the SLAC layoffs was an article on
$400,000 for improvements on the stadium.
Whose Belt?
No one is arguing that some belt-tightening is
needed. The question is whose. It boils down to a
matter of priorities and workers at Stanford
apparently have a very low priority.
The administration has managed to raise $79
million in gifts and pledges in less than a year. Why
hasn't it tried to raise anything for laid-off workers?
Stanford has millions in emergency and slush funds
for all sorts of things. Why hasn't an emergency
fund been set up for workers facing lay-offs?
And finally, Stanford has a 'policy' of placing
laid off workers in other jobs. Why has it not
provided the staff and money and personnel
enforcement powers necessary to implement this
policy in spite of a lot of lip-service to it?
