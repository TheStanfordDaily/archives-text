Constitutional Rights
Editor:
Bruce Kadden's Feb. 26 Daily
article concerning the Statement
of Rights Petition being circulated
by SCOPE and FPAG members
accurately quoted me but is
nevertheless misleading.
I did say that the petition,
from the student point of view,
was in part restorative, since the
Student Judicial Charter of 1968
did have significant rights that
were consequently suspended
when the Campus Judicial System
was created without the consent
of the students. However, it is
important to point out that there
has never been a statement of
such rights for staff, and only
minimal guarantees of faculty
rights. This dearth of clearly
established Constitutional rights
in a University that through its
funding is essentially public is
indeed ironic.
