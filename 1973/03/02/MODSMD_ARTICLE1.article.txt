# U.S., North Vietnam Meet Today To Finalize POW Release Plans
## 
### 
SAIGON (AP) — U.S. and Communist
delegations are meeting today to work
out final arrangements for the
weekend release of 136 American
prisoners of war by the North
Vietnamese and Viet Cong.
Meanwhile, in Paris, the Big Five
nations yesterday joined in an
endorsement of the Washington-Hanoi
peace agreement barring all foreign
meddling in Indochina.
But the action by the United
States, the Soviet Union, China,
Britain and France, along with seven
other governments, failed to dispel
skepticism over the content and
working of the settlement.
The refusal of the Communists to
free the POWs earlier in the week had
set off the first real crisis in the
Vietnam cease-fire agreements.
Released By Tomorrow
In Paris, North Vietnamese foreign
minister, Nguyen Duy Trinh, assured
Secretary of State William P. Rogers
that the prisoners would be released
by 5 a.m. PST tomorrow.
Rogers is attending the
international conference on Vietnam
in Paris.
The Viet Cong today officially
turned over to the U.S. delegation a
list of 30 Americans captured in South
Vietnam who are scheduled to be
released this weekend, a U.S.
spokesman announced.
The North Vietnamese had turned
over a list last night of 106 Americans
to be freed in the second large group
since the cease-fire.
Hanoi
Bui Tin, the chief spokesman for
the North Vietnamese delegation to
the four-party Joint Military
Commission, said the American

prisoners held by the North would be
released at Hanoi's Gia Lam Airport
and flown in U.S. planes to Clark Air
Base in the Philippines, headquarters
of Operation Homecoming for the
repatriation of all American prisoners
in Indochina.
The Viet Cong delegation held back
last night on the release point for the
U.S. prisoners held in South Vietnam.
During the release of the first group
of 143 Americans in North and South
Vietnam on Feb. 12, those held in the
South were turned over to American
authorities at Communist headquarters
Minesweeping
In Washington, the Defense
Department said the resumption by
minesweeping operations at Haiphong
were contingent on the release by the
Communist delegation of a specific
timetable for the freeing of the 136
American POWs, and the turn over by
Viet Cong of their list to the U.S.

delegation.
The United States had temporarily
halted troop withdrawals with 11,300
servicemen remaining in South
Vietnam and had suspended the
sweeping of mines from North
Vietnamese waterways after the
Communist side failed to release the
prisoners Tuesday.
In Paris, the world's great powers,
plus the Communist and
anti-Communist contenders in
Vietnam, and the four nations
supervising the cease-fire, initialed a
nine-point declaration.
Its central purpose was to identify
the international community with the
terms of the month-old complex of
peace accords.
Anxieties
Canada, South Vietnam and
Britain, however, voiced definite
anxieties even while accepting the
document.

Foreign Secretary Mitchell Sharp of
Canada told his colleagues frankly that
the peacekeeping arrangements seem
inadequate.
South Vietnam's Tran Van Lam
tried but failed to have the conference
recognize Saigon as the only iegal
regime in the country.

nine-point declaration.
Its central purpose was to identify
the international community with the
terms of the month-old complex of
peace accords.
Anxieties
Canada, South Vietnam and
Britain, however, voiced definite
anxieties even while accepting the
document.

Foreign Secretary Mitchell Sharp of
Canada told his colleagues frankly that
the peacekeeping arrangements seem
inadequate.
South Vietnam's Tran Van Lam
tried but failed to have the conference

SAIGON (AP) — U.S. and Communist
delegations are meeting today to work
out final arrangements for the
weekend release of 136 American
prisoners of war by the North
Vietnamese and Viet Cong.
Meanwhile, in Paris, the Big Five
nations yesterday joined in an
endorsement of the Washington-Hanoi
peace agreement barring all foreign
meddling in Indochina.
But the action by the United
States, the Soviet Union, China,
Britain and France, along with seven
other governments, failed to dispel
skepticism over the content and
working of the settlement.
The refusal of the Communists to
free the POWs earlier in the week had
set off the first real crisis in the
Vietnam cease-fire agreements.
Released By Tomorrow
In Paris, North Vietnamese foreign
minister, Nguyen Duy Trinh, assured
Secretary of State William P. Rogers
that the prisoners would be released
by 5 a.m. PST tomorrow.
Rogers is attending the
international conference on Vietnam
in Paris.
The Viet Cong today officially
turned over to the U.S. delegation a
list of 30 Americans captured in South
Vietnam who are scheduled to be
released this weekend, a U.S.
spokesman announced.
The North Vietnamese had turned
over a list last night of 106 Americans
to be freed in the second large group
since the cease-fire.
Hanoi
Bui Tin, the chief spokesman for
the North Vietnamese delegation to
the four-party Joint Military
Commission, said the American

prisoners held by the North would be
released at Hanoi's Gia Lam Airport
and flown in U.S. planes to Clark Air
Base in the Philippines, headquarters
of Operation Homecoming for the
repatriation of all American prisoners
in Indochina.
The Viet Cong delegation held back
last night on the release point for the
U.S. prisoners held in South Vietnam.
During the release of the first group
of 143 Americans in North and South
Vietnam on Feb. 12, those held in the
South were turned over to American
authorities at Communist headquarters
Minesweeping
In Washington, the Defense
Department said the resumption by
minesweeping operations at Haiphong
were contingent on the release by the
Communist delegation of a specific
timetable for the freeing of the 136
American POWs, and the turn over by
Viet Cong of their list to the U.S.

delegation.
The United States had temporarily
halted troop withdrawals with 11,300
servicemen remaining in South
Vietnam and had suspended the
sweeping of mines from North
Vietnamese waterways after the
Communist side failed to release the
prisoners Tuesday.
In Paris, the world's great powers,

anti-Communist contenders in
