# 'Leave Us Alone'
## An Open Letter To President Nixon 
### 
Ron Kimberling

"Lord, how the world is given
to worshiping words! Eschew the
coarse word 'slavery,' and you can
get glad acceptance for a
condition of actual slavery."
—Albert Jay Nock
Albert Jay Nock, the crusty
old-guard liberal, a pacifist in the
first World War, was, if nothing
else, a staunch individualist. His
prophetic writings were later
seconded by men like Aldous
Huxley and George Orwell.
It's doubtful if Nock ever
thought that the term "self
reliance" would deviate far from
Emerson's concept of it. But then,
Albert Jay Nock never met
Richard M. Nixon.
By now, the self-proclaimed
theme of Nixon's second
administration is well known. The
President's inaugural address
called for more individual effort
and less dependence upon
government. Nixon noted that "in
trusting too much in government,
we have asked of it more than it
can deliver."
Noble
Very noble sentiments, Mr.
President.
Now, the question is—are you
willing to give the power of
making the essential decisions
regarding their own lives back to
the people? From my perspective,
it seems unlikely.
To begin with, you have done
more than any other chief
executive in United States history
to increase the scope and
authority of the federal
government.
I have to hand it to you. You
must have read Alvin Toffler and
discovered that almost all
Americans live lives of frustration,
uncertainty and fear.

What else is there to explain
the fact that you've managed to
broaden executive powers to an
almost dictatorial extent, increase
the national debt by one-third,
and sell your own political party
down the river by imposing on
this country an economic policy
that they have fought for years.
Opposite
You've told us we should
manage our own lives.
To some of your critics, this
reference applies to your cutbacks
in domestic anti-poverty programs
and the demise of OEO.
Perhaps this is so. And perhaps
I'm more sceptical than most. But
I think that you chose this
moment in hisotry to stress less
reliance on government and more
individual effort because
self-reliance is the opposite of
what you want.
Let's look at some figures.
—The American Bar
Association estimates there are
over 100 million laws on the
books in the U.S. That's about
one law per adult.
—The size of government has
increased so much over the years
that one out of five persons in the
labor force is a civil servant.
—The combined forces of state,
federal and local taxes eat up 35
percent of the average wage
earner's income.
I ask you if any of these
factors contributes to "individual
initiative."
Worst
But soft! I've saved the worst
part of your sham for last.
Singlehandedly, you've
destroyed the foundations of both
the liberal and conservative
political philosophies.
It's very simple. Your cabinet
appointments have revealed the
ruling economic structure of this
country for what it really is—a
gigantic cartel with government
and industry both sharing the top
positions.
As chairman of the board,
you've selected a good team.
Ex-oil executive Claude Brinegar
is your Secretary of
Transportation. Frederick Dent,
former textile company president,
is Secretary of Commerce. A
former corporate lawyer, James
Thomas Lynn, is your HUD
Secretary. And you chose Roy
Ash, the co-founder of Litton, to
direct the Office of Management
and Budget.
Nightmare
Yep. I have to hand it to you.
The five of you have succeeded in
making mincemeat of a piece of
liberal dogma that was destined
for doom anyway.
I'm referring, of course, to the
common liberal notion that
government and industry will act
as competing blocs of power, and
that the government, as the agent
of public trust, will step on the
toes of big business whenever it I
misbehaves.
From the looks of your
cabinet, Mr. President, the only
conflicts that will arise between
government and industry will
stem from sibling rivalry.
But as I mentioned, that
particular liberal argument never
held much water anyway. It was
based upon a mistrust of bigness,
upon a fear that any organization
as large as a modern corporation
could exercise too much control
on the life of he individual. Now,
it may be true that General
Motors is pretty large and pretty
powerful, but a government large
enough to tackle GM, ITT, Ford,
IBM, et al, seems a rather ominous
Frankenstein itself.
Initiative
The remarkable thing is that
you've also destroyed some
conservative myths.
. The conservative pays lip
service to the worth of the
individual, as you have done. But

he believes in separation of
powers between government and
industry. He looks with suspicion
on government regulation of the
economy, and touts the saintliness
of the corporation, which, he
thinks, would never mix company
with the"Washington
bureaucrats."
What you've just done, Mr.
Nixon, is create a conservative's
nightmare. If we go by strict
dictionary definitions, the
interlocking ties between business
and government that your new
cabinet represents
is ... SOCIALISM!
But let's leave those nasty
liberals and conservatives behind
Mr. President, and get down to
the nitty gritty.
I want to be self-reliant. I don't

want to "trust too much to the
government."
How about letting me exercise
some "individual initiative" and
raise myself up by my own
bootstraps. You can start by
giving me back all the money
you've taken in taxes.
I'm thinking about going into a
small business. Why don't you let
me be a little independent, and
rescind all those red-tape forms,
so I can have some time to work.
I'm an avid reader. How about
letting me see the rest of the
Pentagon Papers. And talk about
it on the phone without being
listened to. I confess that I didn't
support you in the last election.
So why don't you exempt me
from that great American
consensus.

I could go on, but I guess
practically every one these days
has his or her "why don't you's"
or "how about's." What we need,
perhaps, is a "why don't you"
that would sum up the wants of
just about every American.
I've got just the thing. In fact,
if you would only grant this one
"why don't you," you might even
succeed in your hopes for greater
self-reliance.
Whv don't you LEAVE US
ALONE?

and Budget.
Nightmare
Yep. I have to hand it to you.
The five of you have succeeded in
making mincemeat of a piece of
liberal dogma that was destined
for doom anyway.
I'm referring, of course, to the
common liberal notion that
government and industry will act
as competing blocs of power, and
that the government, as the agent
of public trust, will step on the
toes of big business whenever it I
misbehaves.
From the looks of your
cabinet, Mr. President, the only
conflicts that will arise between
government and industry will
stem from sibling rivalry.
But as I mentioned, that
particular liberal argument never
held much water anyway. It was
based upon a mistrust of bigness,
upon a fear that any organization
as large as a modern corporation
could exercise too much control
on the life of he individual. Now,
it may be true that General
Motors is pretty large and pretty
powerful, but a government large
enough to tackle GM, ITT, Ford,
IBM, et al, seems a rather ominous
Frankenstein itself.
Initiative
The remarkable thing is that
you've also destroyed some
conservative myths.
. The conservative pays lip
service to the worth of the
individual, as you have done. But

he believes in separation of
powers between government and
industry. He looks with suspicion
on government regulation of the
economy, and touts the saintliness
of the corporation, which, he
thinks, would never mix company
with the"Washington
bureaucrats."
What you've just done, Mr.
Nixon, is create a conservative's
nightmare. If we go by strict
dictionary definitions, the
interlocking ties between business
and government that your new
cabinet represents
is ... SOCIALISM!
But let's leave those nasty
liberals and conservatives behind
Mr. President, and get down to
the nitty gritty.
I want to be self-reliant. I don't

want to "trust too much to the
government."
How about letting me exercise
some "individual initiative" and
raise myself up by my own
bootstraps. You can start by
giving me back all the money
you've taken in taxes.
I'm thinking about going into a
small business. Why don't you let
me be a little independent, and
rescind all those red-tape forms,
so I can have some time to work.
I'm an avid reader. How about
letting me see the rest of the
Pentagon Papers. And talk about
it on the phone without being
listened to. I confess that I didn't
support you in the last election.
So why don't you exempt me
from that great American
consensus.

I could go on, but I guess
practically every one these days
has his or her "why don't you's"
or "how about's." What we need,
perhaps, is a "why don't you"
that would sum up the wants of
just about every American.
I've got just the thing. In fact,
if you would only grant this one
"why don't you," you might even
succeed in your hopes for greater
self-reliance.
Whv don't you LEAVE US
ALONE?

"Lord, how the world is given
to worshiping words! Eschew the
coarse word 'slavery,' and you can
get glad acceptance for a
condition of actual slavery."
—Albert Jay Nock
Albert Jay Nock, the crusty
old-guard liberal, a pacifist in the
first World War, was, if nothing
else, a staunch individualist. His
prophetic writings were later
seconded by men like Aldous
Huxley and George Orwell.
It's doubtful if Nock ever
thought that the term "self
reliance" would deviate far from
Emerson's concept of it. But then,
Albert Jay Nock never met
Richard M. Nixon.
By now, the self-proclaimed
theme of Nixon's second
administration is well known. The
President's inaugural address
called for more individual effort
and less dependence upon
government. Nixon noted that "in
trusting too much in government,
we have asked of it more than it
can deliver."
Noble
Very noble sentiments, Mr.
President.
Now, the question is—are you
willing to give the power of
making the essential decisions
regarding their own lives back to
the people? From my perspective,
it seems unlikely.
To begin with, you have done
more than any other chief
executive in United States history
to increase the scope and
authority of the federal
government.
I have to hand it to you. You
must have read Alvin Toffler and
discovered that almost all
Americans live lives of frustration,
uncertainty and fear.

What else is there to explain
the fact that you've managed to
broaden executive powers to an
almost dictatorial extent, increase
the national debt by one-third,
and sell your own political party
down the river by imposing on
this country an economic policy
that they have fought for years.
Opposite
You've told us we should
manage our own lives.
To some of your critics, this
reference applies to your cutbacks
in domestic anti-poverty programs
and the demise of OEO.
Perhaps this is so. And perhaps
I'm more sceptical than most. But
I think that you chose this
moment in hisotry to stress less
reliance on government and more
individual effort because
self-reliance is the opposite of
what you want.
Let's look at some figures.
—The American Bar
Association estimates there are
over 100 million laws on the
books in the U.S. That's about
one law per adult.
—The size of government has
increased so much over the years
that one out of five persons in the
labor force is a civil servant.
—The combined forces of state,
federal and local taxes eat up 35
percent of the average wage
earner's income.
I ask you if any of these
factors contributes to "individual
initiative."
Worst
But soft! I've saved the worst
part of your sham for last.
Singlehandedly, you've
destroyed the foundations of both
the liberal and conservative
political philosophies.
It's very simple. Your cabinet
appointments have revealed the
ruling economic structure of this
country for what it really is—a
gigantic cartel with government
and industry both sharing the top
positions.
As chairman of the board,
you've selected a good team.
Ex-oil executive Claude Brinegar
is your Secretary of
Transportation. Frederick Dent,
former textile company president,
is Secretary of Commerce. A
former corporate lawyer, James
Thomas Lynn, is your HUD
Secretary. And you chose Roy
Ash, the co-founder of Litton, to
direct the Office of Management
and Budget.

—Albert Jay Nock
Albert Jay Nock, the crusty
old-guard liberal, a pacifist in the
first World War, was, if nothing
else, a staunch individualist. His
prophetic writings were later
seconded by men like Aldous
Huxley and George Orwell.
It's doubtful if Nock ever
thought that the term "self
reliance" would deviate far from
Emerson's concept of it. But then,
Albert Jay Nock never met
Richard M. Nixon.
By now, the self-proclaimed
theme of Nixon's second
administration is well known. The
President's inaugural address
called for more individual effort
and less dependence upon
government. Nixon noted that "in
trusting too much in government,
we have asked of it more than it
can deliver."
Noble
Very noble sentiments, Mr.
President.
Now, the question is—are you
willing to give the power of
making the essential decisions
regarding their own lives back to
the people? From my perspective,
it seems unlikely.
To begin with, you have done
more than any other chief
executive in United States history
to increase the scope and
authority of the federal
government.
I have to hand it to you. You
must have read Alvin Toffler and
discovered that almost all
Americans live lives of frustration,
uncertainty and fear.

What else is there to explain
the fact that you've managed to
broaden executive powers to an
almost dictatorial extent, increase
the national debt by one-third,
and sell your own political party
down the river by imposing on
this country an economic policy
that they have fought for years.
Opposite
You've told us we should
manage our own lives.
To some of your critics, this
reference applies to your cutbacks
in domestic anti-poverty programs
and the demise of OEO.
Perhaps this is so. And perhaps
I'm more sceptical than most. But
I think that you chose this
moment in hisotry to stress less
reliance on government and more
individual effort because
self-reliance is the opposite of
what you want.
Let's look at some figures.
—The American Bar
Association estimates there are
over 100 million laws on the
books in the U.S. That's about
one law per adult.
—The size of government has
increased so much over the years
that one out of five persons in the
labor force is a civil servant.
—The combined forces of state,
federal and local taxes eat up 35
percent of the average wage
earner's income.
I ask you if any of these
factors contributes to "individual
initiative."
Worst
But soft! I've saved the worst
part of your sham for last.
Singlehandedly, you've
destroyed the foundations of both
the liberal and conservative
political philosophies.
It's very simple. Your cabinet
appointments have revealed the
ruling economic structure of this
country for what it really is—a
gigantic cartel with government
and industry both sharing the top
positions.
As chairman of the board,
you've selected a good team.
Ex-oil executive Claude Brinegar
is your Secretary of
Transportation. Frederick Dent,
former textile company president,
is Secretary of Commerce. A
former corporate lawyer, James
Thomas Lynn, is your HUD
Secretary. And you chose Roy
Ash, the co-founder of Litton, to
direct the Office of Management
and Budget.
Nightmare
Yep. I have to hand it to you.
The five of you have succeeded in
making mincemeat of a piece of
liberal dogma that was destined
for doom anyway.
I'm referring, of course, to the
common liberal notion that
government and industry will act
as competing blocs of power, and
that the government, as the agent
of public trust, will step on the
toes of big business whenever it I
misbehaves.
From the looks of your
cabinet, Mr. President, the only
conflicts that will arise between
government and industry will
stem from sibling rivalry.
But as I mentioned, that
particular liberal argument never
held much water anyway. It was
based upon a mistrust of bigness,
upon a fear that any organization
as large as a modern corporation
could exercise too much control
on the life of he individual. Now,
it may be true that General
Motors is pretty large and pretty
powerful, but a government large
enough to tackle GM, ITT, Ford,
IBM, et al, seems a rather ominous
Frankenstein itself.
Initiative
The remarkable thing is that
you've also destroyed some
conservative myths.
. The conservative pays lip
service to the worth of the
individual, as you have done. But

he believes in separation of
powers between government and
industry. He looks with suspicion
on government regulation of the
economy, and touts the saintliness
of the corporation, which, he
thinks, would never mix company
with the"Washington
bureaucrats."
What you've just done, Mr.
Nixon, is create a conservative's
nightmare. If we go by strict
dictionary definitions, the
interlocking ties between business
and government that your new
cabinet represents
is ... SOCIALISM!
But let's leave those nasty
liberals and conservatives behind
Mr. President, and get down to
the nitty gritty.
I want to be self-reliant. I don't

want to "trust too much to the
government."
How about letting me exercise
some "individual initiative" and
raise myself up by my own
bootstraps. You can start by
giving me back all the money
you've taken in taxes.
I'm thinking about going into a
small business. Why don't you let
me be a little independent, and
rescind all those red-tape forms,
so I can have some time to work.
I'm an avid reader. How about
letting me see the rest of the
Pentagon Papers. And talk about
it on the phone without being
listened to. I confess that I didn't
support you in the last election.
So why don't you exempt me
from that great American
consensus.

I could go on, but I guess
practically every one these days
has his or her "why don't you's"
or "how about's." What we need,
perhaps, is a "why don't you"
that would sum up the wants of
just about every American.
I've got just the thing. In fact,
if you would only grant this one
"why don't you," you might even
succeed in your hopes for greater
self-reliance.
Whv don't you LEAVE US
ALONE?

I'm referring, of course, to the
common liberal notion that
government and industry will act
as competing blocs of power, and
that the government, as the agent
of public trust, will step on the
toes of big business whenever it I
misbehaves.
From the looks of your
cabinet, Mr. President, the only
conflicts that will arise between
government and industry will
stem from sibling rivalry.
But as I mentioned, that
particular liberal argument never
held much water anyway. It was
based upon a mistrust of bigness,
upon a fear that any organization
as large as a modern corporation
could exercise too much control
on the life of he individual. Now,
it may be true that General
Motors is pretty large and pretty
powerful, but a government large
enough to tackle GM, ITT, Ford,
IBM, et al, seems a rather ominous
Frankenstein itself.
Initiative
The remarkable thing is that
you've also destroyed some
conservative myths.
. The conservative pays lip
service to the worth of the
individual, as you have done. But

he believes in separation of
powers between government and
industry. He looks with suspicion
on government regulation of the
economy, and touts the saintliness
of the corporation, which, he
thinks, would never mix company
with the"Washington
bureaucrats."
What you've just done, Mr.
Nixon, is create a conservative's
nightmare. If we go by strict
dictionary definitions, the
interlocking ties between business
and government that your new
cabinet represents
is ... SOCIALISM!
But let's leave those nasty
liberals and conservatives behind
Mr. President, and get down to
the nitty gritty.
I want to be self-reliant. I don't

want to "trust too much to the
government."
How about letting me exercise
some "individual initiative" and
raise myself up by my own
bootstraps. You can start by
giving me back all the money
you've taken in taxes.
I'm thinking about going into a
small business. Why don't you let
me be a little independent, and
rescind all those red-tape forms,
so I can have some time to work.
I'm an avid reader. How about
letting me see the rest of the
Pentagon Papers. And talk about
it on the phone without being
listened to. I confess that I didn't
support you in the last election.
So why don't you exempt me
from that great American
consensus.

I could go on, but I guess
practically every one these days
has his or her "why don't you's"
or "how about's." What we need,
perhaps, is a "why don't you"
that would sum up the wants of
just about every American.
I've got just the thing. In fact,
if you would only grant this one
"why don't you," you might even
succeed in your hopes for greater
self-reliance.
Whv don't you LEAVE US
ALONE?
