Shockley's Lemon

Editor:
When the University of Leeds
withdrew the offer of the
conferrence of an honor upon Dr.
William Shockley, his widely
published reaction was "When life
gives you a lemon, make
lemonade."
I think the reaction was rather
clever and I shall probably use it
at some time in the future myself.
However, I think that, in another
case, it could be put to use as
something more than a catchy
little jape.
As a Black man, I am
well-acquainted with Shockley's
drivel about our supposed
intellectual inferiority. It is just
the sort of hare-brained egotistical
mush that would come from a
man so impressed by his IQ that
he can live for little else than to
make everyone join his little "over
100 Club." I prefer to stay out of
it. The price of joining is too high.
I shudder to think of all the
productive and intellectual
potential that would have gone
down the drain if Shockley's
proposal's were ever put into
effect by anyone. IQ is too
arbitrary and tenuous a
designation to throw a whole
people into a celestial garbage can
and slam the lid on them because
of it.
Shockley, I believe, envisions a
society of white intellectuals such
as himself keeping tabs on the
IQ's of those around them with
the help of some "good niggers"
who possess IQ's of over 100.
(The high IQ delineating "good.")
Environment is the biggest
factor in relation to the disparity
of IQ between Blacks and whites
(if that disparity does, in fact,
exist.) Time and again, it has been
proven that this is so and that
crackpots like Shockley and
Jensen are simply looking for
inroads to barbaric euthanasia.
So if, Dr. Shockley, life has
given me a genetic lemon, let me
make lemonade. The lemonade is
richer for all its pulp and pits. The
world has not stopped its search
for knowledge simply because it
refuses to consider your
proposals; it simply knows of
better ways to spend its time.

Israeli Action Logical
Editor:
The cartoon you printed the
other day showing Israeli fighter
pilots leaving their planes as one
says "Scratch one dangerous Arab

airliner and 100 bloody
passengers" is in total disregard to
what actually happened.
If the United States were at
war with some country and a
plane from that country was seen
flying over a region of maximum
security wouldn't it be expected
that the U.S. would send up
planes to force the enemy jet to
land?
And then what would be
expected if the enemy plane did
not respond and if the windows
were all covered so that you
couldn't tell that civilians were
aboard? The Israeli Air Force
followed the only logical course
of action. After all, had it been a
spy plane, it would have had its
windows covered and wouldn't
have responded to orders.
What really was silly about that
cartoon was the comment. The
hate and paranoia in that sentence
is not indicative of the Israeli way
of thinking; even after a senseless
Arab attack on Israelis you don't
hear that kind of talk. It certainly
seems silly to financially
compensate the families if Israel
saw the passengers as "bloody
minded" warriors.

Male Contraceptive
Editor:
In your Feb. 27 issue you had
a brief article about a talk given
by me on "Abortion—An
Assessment of the Period
1950-1980." In his brief

comments on my talk, your
reporter quoted me as responding:
"I think it's pointless" to a
question about the prospects for a
male contraceptive pill, and then
stated: "He said that it was the
woman who got pregnant—not the
man, and hence the man has less
responsibility to take the pill."
I hope that this letter is printed
by you before you get flooded
with justified complaints that I
am apparently the archetype of
the male chauvinist pig. I have no
objections whatsoever to research
or the development of a male
contraceptive pill but, as I
outlined in great detail in an article
in Science [Volume 169,941
(1970)], it would take at least
until the middle of the next
decade to have such an agent
available for wide distribution and
that, therefore, alternative means
would have to be used in the
interval before the next one
billion human beings are born.
Furthermore, my statement
about the man having less
responsibility in case of pregnancy
than the woman was specifically
addressed to those situations in
which pregnancies resulted from
occasional intercourse among
partners who are unlikely to see
each other again or in countries
where illegitimacy is rampant and
may even exceed fifty percent of
the population. I have serious
doubts whether a male
contraceptive pill in such
situations will help in the long
overdue emancipation of women.
