# Industry, Congress Prepare For Showdown On FDA Law
## 
### Associated Press 
WASHINGTON — While the food and chemical
industry lobbies for softening the law prohibiting
cancer-causing substances in food, Congress is
divided with some members hoping to make it even
more rigid.
Sen. Gaylord Nelson (D—Wise.) plans to
propose again legislation to extend the Delaney
Clause to require pre-market testing of most
additives to make sure they don't cause birth
defects or genetic mutations.
Food and Drug Commissioner Charles C.
Edwards says the FDA must be "neutral, and I
mean neutral" on Delaney, but he has called
publicly for months for a privately funded
international symposium drawing together the
world's best scientific brains to wrestle with the
question.
The Nutrition Foundation and the Food and
Drug Law Institute, both industry-oriented and
supported, have joined with Consumers Union in
gathering pledges to support such a conference later
this year.
The plan is to attempt to draft a mathematical
formula proving that "safe" amounts of a known
carcinogen can be added to food without causing
cancer in man.
Hidden Time Bombs
But leading scientists including many employed
by the government, say such carcinogens can be
hidden time bombs that result in cancer 10, 20 or
30 years after exposure.
"In providing a framework for evaluating
potential hazards of these additives, the Delaney
Clause simply ratifies the prevailing expert opinion
in the National Cancer Institute and in other
professional qualified groups that there is no
practical method to determine safe dietary levels for
a carcinogen," says Dr. Samuel S. Epstein of Case

Western Reserve University.
The likely effect of Nelson's bill will be to stall,
at least temporarily, industry efforts to modify the
current law.
So it will be questions revolving around cancer,
the nation's No. 2 health menace, which will bring
Delaney to a head.
Narrow Scope
The Delaney Clause, which bars cancer-causing
additives from foods, is very narrow in scope. It
applies to fewer than 3,000 additives for which
FDA has issued regulations.
It cannot touch the roughly 600 ingredients
generally recognized as safe, which themselves are
under review for safety, nor the category of
prior-sanctioned ingredients approved by either the
Agriculture Department or FDA before 1958.
The others could be banned, however, as
"poisonous or deleterious" by the FDA under
long-standing but unwieldy legal authority.
The chemical industry says the average American
consumes about five pounds of synthetic additives a
year, and the sales volume of food chemicals is
expected to grow from $485 million in 1970 to
$750 million by 1980.
Food chemicals are used as stabilizers,
preservatives, disinfectants, antioxidents, extenders,
tenderizers, emulsifiers, growth promotors,
bleaches, sweeteners, colors and flavors, to the
advantage of either the processor or the consumer.
"Most additives are purely cosmetic. Many
involve outright deceit," contends Ralph Nader's
Health Research Group in a 28-page booklet
distributed recently to congressmen. The message is
that Delaney should not be charged.
Opponents of Delaney contend the law prevents
the exercise of scientific judgment, should scientists
develop the ability to determine a safe or no-effect
level of carcinogens in food.
