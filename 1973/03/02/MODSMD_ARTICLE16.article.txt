# Twain House Presents 'Bald Soprano'
## 
### TOM MILLS 
When one speaks of " dorm
drama" at Stanford, images of
water balloon fights, co-ed
showers, or far out parties quickly
come to mind—actual theatrical
productions do not. A play
performed by a dorm is
sufficiently rare to attract an
audience just out of curiosity.
When such a play is also well
chosen and well acted, it should
definitely be seen. The Twain
House (Stern Hall) production of
lonesco's "The Bald Soprano," to
be performed in the Twain East
lounge at 8:30 p.m. tonight and
tomorrow, is well worth anyone's
time, and money too; but the
performance is free.
Set in "a middle-class English
interior, with English armchairs,
on an English evening," the play's
one act opens on the Smiths. "Mr.
Smith, an Englishman, is wearing
English slippers, is smoking his
English pipe and reading an
English newspaper. Mrs. Smith, an
Englishwoman, is darning some
English socks. A long moment of
English silence. . ." The silence is
ruptured by the striking of the
living room clock, and Mrs. Smith
begins a discourse on dinner
which eventually brings the local

grocer to mind, a Rumanian
yogurt specialist named Popesco
Rosen 112 eld.
All the while, Mr. Smith
ignores her, engrossed in his paper
while making infantile noises by
clicking his tongue. Suddenly his
attention is given to remarks Mrs.
Smith is making about the local
doctor, and the first of the play's
innumerable dialogues of
non-sequituris underway, typified
by such remarks as, "a
conscientious doctor must die
with his patient if they can't get
well together."
Bizarre Dialogue
After a humorous conversation
about Bobby Watson, "the
1 handsomest corpse in Great
j Britain," and about his wife,
Bobby Watson, and their two
children, both named Bobby
Watson, Mary the maid enters and
recounts her "very pleasant"
afternoon spent, among other
things, drinking brandy and milk.
She then announces the Smiths'
guests, the Martins, who are
arriving only four hours late. The
Smiths exit, Mary admits the
Martins before leaving, and we are
now treated to a curious (yes, a
curious and how very bizarre!)
dialogue.

The Martins apparently do not
know each other, though Mr.
Martin is sure he has seen Mrs.
Martin somewhere before. How
curious, and what a coincidence!
The Martins establish that they
come from the same city, took
the same train, same
compartment, to London, at the
same time, live in the same
building, in the same room, and
therefore must share the same
bed. "It is perhaps there that we
have met!" Mr. Martin exclaims.
"How curious it is and what a
coincidence! It is indeed possible
that we have met there, and
perhaps even last night. But I do
not recall it dear sir!," replies Mrs.
Martin.
Finally the Martins "discover"
each other through further
deduction which is interrupted
only by the unpredictable room
clock whose chimes ring out
random hours when least
expected. The Smiths now reenter
and confront the Martins.
The play now centers on the
interaction of the Smiths and
Martins, and this interaction is
given a new dimension by the
appearance of the local Fire Chief.
He has dropped by "on official
business;" he's looking for fires.
Finding none he stays to tell
stories. Soon everyone is telling a
story in turn when Mary brazonly
rushes into the parlour to tell a
story of her own. Spying each
other with surprise, she and the
Fire Chief recognize each other
and their reunion can only be
called a shock to English
propriety. Alone again finally, the
Smiths and Martins continue
conversing; but there is something
in their tones which grates.
Tempers Rise
Line by line their tempers rise.
Growing hostility pours through
every innocuous word that is
uttered. Suddenly the mood
changes, even as the movements
of the actors accelerate. Moments
later the play ends with a final
strange and compelling irony.
"The Bald Soprano" is serious
and thought provoking and at the
same time light and humorous.
The play as a whole is consistent
with its parts. That is, it raises
contradiction to the heights.
Through repetition and
non-sequitur, lonesco not only
calls our attention to language as a
medium of expression capable of
communicating meaning through
form devoid of real content, but
he also challenges our tendency

toward linear thinking.
We are brought up short by the
play's intentional irrationality.
Common sense avails us little in
any effort to anticipate the play's
action. As a result, we are
pleasantly surprised and
entertained by the play. Like
children, we are capable of being
highly diverted by clever
nonsense.
But "The Bald Soprano" is
more than this. As a legitimate
genre of the theater it transcends
nonsense. Through a few well
chosen symbols the play presents
life at its most absurd, and from
this pessimistic starting point it
encourages us to think about what
life means.
No Meaning
Time means nothing in the play,
as the Martins' tardiness, their
amnesia for even yesterday, and
the clock reminds us. Identity is
also a non-entity; remember poor
Bobby Watson or the Martins
themselves? Thus, the past holds
no meaning as presented by the
play. For what is the past but
linear time; or identity but the
outgrowth and recall of that time?
Yet time is not linear here,
even if it could be recalled.
Devoid of a past, the present then
becomes the fleeting reality on
which life must be based. It is,
however, a reality robbed of
meaning by the absolute triviality
of subject matter and irrationality
of thought which characterizes
the play's dialogue.
Life without meaning, without
those values which come down
from the past and the passion
brought to it by personality, or
identity—this is the nihilistic state
in which society finds itself in this
play of lonesco. As their surnames
indicate, the Smiths or Martins
represent society generally; by
their social class they focus
attention on a distinct segment of
society.
"The Bald Soprano" is
performed by The Twain House
Players. Mr. Smith is very well
played by Madison Grose. His
nuances of expression and subtle
portrayal of emotions which belie
words of endearment to Mrs.
Smith add depth to his part and
humor to the play.
Tina Cooper plays Mrs. Smith
and is excellent. From accent and
gesture to slightly arthritic walk,
Miss Cooper gives us a Mrs. Smith
who, stifled by her life and
mocked by her husband, responds
with flashes of strength and
vitality which remain muffled by

frustration and English propriety.
Mr. Martin is done by Frederic
Schwartz, and done well. His
performance is particularly good
when he is nervously
"discovering" Mrs. Martin and
when he stands up to Mr. Smith,
squeaky voice and all, later in the
Play-
Susan Currier handles the part
of Mrs. Martin as it should be
done. The part itself is less
developed than Mrs. Smith's and
the stage directions actually
require that many of the Martins'
lines be delivered in monotonous
voices without nuances. Miss
Currier is faithful to the script
where it is restrictive, but she also
adds much to the enjoyment of
the play by her appearance and
understatement during the
"discovery" scene with Mr.
Martin.
Mary the maid is played by
Irma Nogales. Though a small
part, it is made memorable by her
characterization of Mary as a
servant undaunted by the usual
demands of reserve and deference
her position requires towards
social superiors. Further, Miss
Nogales' handling of Mary's
attempt to tell her story is quite
good.
The Fire Chief is done by
Kenneth Lewis as a suitably shy
and godawful boring official. He
handles his lines well and has a
particularly good voice for the
stage.
The Twain House production
of "The Bald Soprano" is directed
by fledgling director David
Brown. Although a first effort,
Director Brown brings to it the
experience he acquired while
rooming with a former Twain
House director last year. The
-esults he has gotten from this
cast are indeed impressive.
