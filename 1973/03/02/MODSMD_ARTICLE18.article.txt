# Cards Open Promising Track Campaign
## 
### PHIL HUBBARD 
The Stanford track team kicks
off its 1973 outdoor season
tomorrow as the Cards host
Fresno State in a dual meet
beginning at 1:15 in the Stanford
stadium.
The Cards come into this meet
in the wake of one of their most
rewarding indoor campaigns of
the past few years. Stanford
runners distinguished themselves
in the San Francisco Examiner
meet in late January, and won the
Bennion Relays in Idaho two
weeks ago. On the way to that
victory the Cards' 880 relay set a
world record of 1:27.4.

The team held its intersquad
meet last Friday afternoon to
determine the lineup against
Fresno. The highlight of the day
was a shot put of 56'5V4" by
freshman Terry Albritton, which
would have bettered the frosh
record by several inches if it had
been made in a regular meet.
Other fine performances last
week included 8:50.2 and 9:01
two miles times by Brian
Mittelstaedt and Tony Sandoval,
and Jim Howard's 169'11" discus
throw. Tom Long's 52.9 in the
intermediate hurdles and Dave
Bagshaw's 14.3 in the high hurdles
are also worth noting.

The Fresno team which invades
Stanford tomorrow is much
stronger than the one which was
defeated 100-63 in last year's
competition. Coach Cornelius
Warmerdam, a former world
record holder in the pole vault,
has recruited several fine freshmen
for his 1973 squad. Having won
only one of the last 25 duals
against the Cards, Fresno will be
pulling for an upset.
Stanford, too, should have a
stronger team than the 1972
squad which recorded a 3-3 mark
in dual meets last year and took
seventh in the Pac-8.
Besides Albritton in the shot,
newcomers to the Cards include
frosh standouts Sandoval, who
seems destined to break the 9:00
mark in the two mile in thenear
future, Vernell Jackson (1:53.6 in
the 880) and Matt Hogsett who
ran a leg on the record-breaking
880 relay team. Junior college
transfer Kenny Kring is an
all-around performer who has a
decathlon total of 7,243 points
and leads the Stanford pole
vaulters with a 15'1V&" leap to his
credit.
The first event of the
afternoon will be the hammer
throw at Angell Field at 1:00. Wes
Reynolds will be throwing for the
Cards trying to improve on the
131 feet he tossed the hammer in
last Friday's competition.
Several Ineligible
The pole vault, beginning at
1:15, will see Kring in a dual with
his opposite number, decathelete
Roger George. Kring will also
compete in the long jump.
Stanford's leading jumpers. Tom
Anderson and Mel Ho, may be
ineligible because of too few units
unless they make up incompletes
before Saturday.
Jim Royer in the discus may
not compete tomorrow for the
same reason. Triple jumper Rod
Utley and hurdler Tom Long are
definitely ineligible until spring

quarter. The absence of these fine
performers will undoubtedly be
felt, especially in the field events.
Even without Royer in the discus,
Howard (173'6") and Pete
Dreissigacker (167'3") should be
good for two places. Behind
Albritton in the shot, co-captain
Ralph Bakkensen will fight it out
with Fresno's Mike Giroux.
Steve Hopkins (223'3") and
Rick Larson (209'11") will be
facing Fresno's Lonnie Powell
(220'8") in the javelin. Without
Utley and perhaps Ho, the triple
jump will depend on Derek
Toliver and Mike Hall.
With Skip Grodahl sitting out
competition this year, the high
jump looks rather bleak for the
Cards. Fresno has three 6'6" or
better jumpers. Only Tom
Anderson has leaped that high for
Stanford.
Record Team Runs
Kurt Schoenrock is the current
leader in the steeplechase, the first
running event, which begins at
1:45. Following the steeplechase
is the 440 relay. The Cards will
run Ken Curl, John Kessel; Matt
Hogsett, and John Anderson, the
same team that set the 880 record
two weeks ago.
Mittelstaedt and Les McFadden

lead the Stanford milers at 4:05.3
and 4:06.9 respectively. Bagshaw
(14.2) will face Fresncf s Greg
Zulim (14.3) in the high hurdles.
In the 440, John Anderson and
John Kessel will represent the
Cards.
Ken Curl, who ran a 9.4 100 in
the Pac-8 meet last year is the
favorite in that event Saturday.
Vernell Jackson (1:53.6) may find
himself locked in a head to head
duel with Fresno's Ray Burk
(1:53.4) in the 880.
Kring will be Stanford's hope
in the intermediate hurdles in
Tom Long's absence. Curl and
Anderson will battle Ed Jeffries
of Fresno in the 220.
With Mittelstaedt in the mile, it
will be up to Sandoval and Mark
McConnell to control the two
mile for the Cards. The final
event, the mile relay, will see
Anderson, Kessel, and Hogsett
from the 880 world record team,
along with Bagshaw.
Coach Payton Jordan doesn't
feel this year's meet will be an
easy victory as it was in 1972.
"Fresno has a strong, young team.
Coach Warmerdam recruited a lot
of good performers for this year.
Competitively it should be a good
meet, and I think it could be a
close one."

only one of the last 25 duals
against the Cards, Fresno will be
pulling for an upset.
Stanford, too, should have a
stronger team than the 1972
squad which recorded a 3-3 mark
in dual meets last year and took
seventh in the Pac-8.
Besides Albritton in the shot,
newcomers to the Cards include
frosh standouts Sandoval, who
seems destined to break the 9:00
mark in the two mile in thenear
future, Vernell Jackson (1:53.6 in
the 880) and Matt Hogsett who
ran a leg on the record-breaking
880 relay team. Junior college
transfer Kenny Kring is an
all-around performer who has a
decathlon total of 7,243 points
and leads the Stanford pole
vaulters with a 15'1V&" leap to his
credit.
The first event of the
afternoon will be the hammer
throw at Angell Field at 1:00. Wes
Reynolds will be throwing for the
Cards trying to improve on the
131 feet he tossed the hammer in
last Friday's competition.
Several Ineligible
The pole vault, beginning at
1:15, will see Kring in a dual with
his opposite number, decathelete
Roger George. Kring will also
compete in the long jump.
Stanford's leading jumpers. Tom
Anderson and Mel Ho, may be
ineligible because of too few units
unless they make up incompletes
before Saturday.
Jim Royer in the discus may
not compete tomorrow for the
same reason. Triple jumper Rod
Utley and hurdler Tom Long are
definitely ineligible until spring

quarter. The absence of these fine
performers will undoubtedly be
felt, especially in the field events.
Even without Royer in the discus,
Howard (173'6") and Pete
Dreissigacker (167'3") should be
good for two places. Behind
Albritton in the shot, co-captain
Ralph Bakkensen will fight it out
with Fresno's Mike Giroux.
Steve Hopkins (223'3") and
Rick Larson (209'11") will be
facing Fresno's Lonnie Powell
(220'8") in the javelin. Without
Utley and perhaps Ho, the triple
jump will depend on Derek
Toliver and Mike Hall.
With Skip Grodahl sitting out
competition this year, the high
jump looks rather bleak for the
Cards. Fresno has three 6'6" or
better jumpers. Only Tom
Anderson has leaped that high for
Stanford.
Record Team Runs
Kurt Schoenrock is the current
leader in the steeplechase, the first
running event, which begins at
1:45. Following the steeplechase
is the 440 relay. The Cards will
run Ken Curl, John Kessel; Matt
Hogsett, and John Anderson, the
same team that set the 880 record
two weeks ago.
Mittelstaedt and Les McFadden

lead the Stanford milers at 4:05.3
and 4:06.9 respectively. Bagshaw
(14.2) will face Fresncf s Greg
Zulim (14.3) in the high hurdles.
In the 440, John Anderson and
John Kessel will represent the
Cards.
Ken Curl, who ran a 9.4 100 in
the Pac-8 meet last year is the
favorite in that event Saturday.
Vernell Jackson (1:53.6) may find
himself locked in a head to head
duel with Fresno's Ray Burk
(1:53.4) in the 880.
Kring will be Stanford's hope
in the intermediate hurdles in
Tom Long's absence. Curl and
Anderson will battle Ed Jeffries
of Fresno in the 220.
With Mittelstaedt in the mile, it
will be up to Sandoval and Mark
McConnell to control the two
mile for the Cards. The final
event, the mile relay, will see
Anderson, Kessel, and Hogsett
from the 880 world record team,
along with Bagshaw.
Coach Payton Jordan doesn't
feel this year's meet will be an
easy victory as it was in 1972.
"Fresno has a strong, young team.
Coach Warmerdam recruited a lot
of good performers for this year.

The Stanford track team kicks
off its 1973 outdoor season
tomorrow as the Cards host
Fresno State in a dual meet
beginning at 1:15 in the Stanford
stadium.
The Cards come into this meet
in the wake of one of their most
rewarding indoor campaigns of
the past few years. Stanford
runners distinguished themselves
in the San Francisco Examiner
meet in late January, and won the
Bennion Relays in Idaho two
weeks ago. On the way to that
victory the Cards' 880 relay set a
world record of 1:27.4.

The team held its intersquad
meet last Friday afternoon to
determine the lineup against
Fresno. The highlight of the day
was a shot put of 56'5V4" by
freshman Terry Albritton, which
would have bettered the frosh
record by several inches if it had
been made in a regular meet.
Other fine performances last
week included 8:50.2 and 9:01
two miles times by Brian
Mittelstaedt and Tony Sandoval,
and Jim Howard's 169'11" discus
throw. Tom Long's 52.9 in the
intermediate hurdles and Dave
Bagshaw's 14.3 in the high hurdles
are also worth noting.

The Fresno team which invades
Stanford tomorrow is much
stronger than the one which was
defeated 100-63 in last year's
competition. Coach Cornelius

Utley and hurdler Tom Long are
definitely ineligible until spring

quarter. The absence of these fine
performers will undoubtedly be
felt, especially in the field events.
Even without Royer in the discus,
Howard (173'6") and Pete
Dreissigacker (167'3") should be
good for two places. Behind
Albritton in the shot, co-captain
Ralph Bakkensen will fight it out
with Fresno's Mike Giroux.
Steve Hopkins (223'3") and
Rick Larson (209'11") will be
facing Fresno's Lonnie Powell
(220'8") in the javelin. Without
Utley and perhaps Ho, the triple
jump will depend on Derek
Toliver and Mike Hall.
With Skip Grodahl sitting out
competition this year, the high
jump looks rather bleak for the
Cards. Fresno has three 6'6" or
better jumpers. Only Tom
Anderson has leaped that high for
Stanford.
Record Team Runs
Kurt Schoenrock is the current
leader in the steeplechase, the first
running event, which begins at
1:45. Following the steeplechase
is the 440 relay. The Cards will
run Ken Curl, John Kessel; Matt
Hogsett, and John Anderson, the
same team that set the 880 record
two weeks ago.
Mittelstaedt and Les McFadden

lead the Stanford milers at 4:05.3
and 4:06.9 respectively. Bagshaw
(14.2) will face Fresncf s Greg
Zulim (14.3) in the high hurdles.
In the 440, John Anderson and
John Kessel will represent the
Cards.
Ken Curl, who ran a 9.4 100 in
the Pac-8 meet last year is the
favorite in that event Saturday.
Vernell Jackson (1:53.6) may find
himself locked in a head to head
duel with Fresno's Ray Burk
(1:53.4) in the 880.
Kring will be Stanford's hope
in the intermediate hurdles in
Tom Long's absence. Curl and
Anderson will battle Ed Jeffries
of Fresno in the 220.
With Mittelstaedt in the mile, it
will be up to Sandoval and Mark
McConnell to control the two
mile for the Cards. The final
event, the mile relay, will see
Anderson, Kessel, and Hogsett
from the 880 world record team,
along with Bagshaw.
Coach Payton Jordan doesn't
feel this year's meet will be an
easy victory as it was in 1972.
"Fresno has a strong, young team.
Coach Warmerdam recruited a lot
of good performers for this year.
Competitively it should be a good
meet, and I think it could be a
close one."
The Stanford track team kicks
off its 1973 outdoor season
tomorrow as the Cards host
Fresno State in a dual meet
beginning at 1:15 in the Stanford
stadium.
The Cards come into this meet
in the wake of one of their most
rewarding indoor campaigns of
the past few years. Stanford
runners distinguished themselves
in the San Francisco Examiner
meet in late January, and won the
Bennion Relays in Idaho two
weeks ago. On the way to that
victory the Cards' 880 relay set a
world record of 1:27.4.

The team held its intersquad
meet last Friday afternoon to
determine the lineup against
Fresno. The highlight of the day
was a shot put of 56'5V4" by
freshman Terry Albritton, which
would have bettered the frosh
record by several inches if it had
been made in a regular meet.
Other fine performances last
week included 8:50.2 and 9:01
two miles times by Brian
Mittelstaedt and Tony Sandoval,
and Jim Howard's 169'11" discus
throw. Tom Long's 52.9 in the
intermediate hurdles and Dave
Bagshaw's 14.3 in the high hurdles
are also worth noting.

The Fresno team which invades
Stanford tomorrow is much
stronger than the one which was
defeated 100-63 in last year's
competition. Coach Cornelius
Warmerdam, a former world
record holder in the pole vault,
has recruited several fine freshmen
for his 1973 squad. Having won
only one of the last 25 duals
against the Cards, Fresno will be
pulling for an upset.
Stanford, too, should have a
stronger team than the 1972
squad which recorded a 3-3 mark
in dual meets last year and took
seventh in the Pac-8.
Besides Albritton in the shot,
newcomers to the Cards include
frosh standouts Sandoval, who
seems destined to break the 9:00
mark in the two mile in thenear
future, Vernell Jackson (1:53.6 in
the 880) and Matt Hogsett who
ran a leg on the record-breaking
880 relay team. Junior college
transfer Kenny Kring is an
all-around performer who has a
decathlon total of 7,243 points
and leads the Stanford pole
vaulters with a 15'1V&" leap to his
credit.
The first event of the
afternoon will be the hammer
throw at Angell Field at 1:00. Wes
Reynolds will be throwing for the
Cards trying to improve on the
131 feet he tossed the hammer in
last Friday's competition.
Several Ineligible
The pole vault, beginning at
1:15, will see Kring in a dual with
his opposite number, decathelete
Roger George. Kring will also
compete in the long jump.
Stanford's leading jumpers. Tom
Anderson and Mel Ho, may be
ineligible because of too few units
unless they make up incompletes
before Saturday.
Jim Royer in the discus may
not compete tomorrow for the
same reason. Triple jumper Rod
Utley and hurdler Tom Long are
definitely ineligible until spring

quarter. The absence of these fine
performers will undoubtedly be
felt, especially in the field events.
