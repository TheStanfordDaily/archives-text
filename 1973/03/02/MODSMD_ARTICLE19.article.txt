# Jordan Seeks To 'Save Olympics'
## 
### GEORGE BERRY 
There is a new movement
underway in the sports world.
Like most movements, it has
started out slow and quietly, but
is picking up momentum and
publicity. This campaign could be
loosely termed the "Save the
Olympics Movement." Although
many have contributed to the
cause and no single person can
claim credit for its start, one of
the most important contributors
is Stanford's head track coach
Payton Jordan.
Jordan is no novice to the
sport and the Games themselves.
A former world class sprinter, the
USC grad has been active as a
coach for over 32 years. He has
directed many U.S. teams which
have competed around the world
and in 1968 served as head coach
of the U.S. Olympic team.
Jordan's deep concern for the
Olympic Games and his feelings
about what happened at Munich
were clearly illustrated in the
February issue of Letterman
magazine. In an article entitled
"Olympics Must Be Saved,"
Jordan and Stanley Wilson, also of
Stanford, outlined suggestions to
reform and improve the Games.
Minimizing Nationalism
Jordan calls for minimizing
nationalism in the Olympics. He
feels that the Games have become
too political and suggests that
instead of national anthems being
played at the awards' ceremonies,
the Olympic Anthem be played.
He would also have only the
Olympic flag be raised, rather
than those of the medal winners.
Jordan states, "This would
represent the ultimate moment of
honoring a champion who has
competed against his peers rather
than against a representative of a
specific nation." •
He feels that the host nation
should be held responsible for the
officiating. Under the present
system, member nations submit
the names of judges from their
countries to act as officials.
Jordan believes "that it would aid
in avoiding sectional evaluation
for national or political reasons if
the responsibility to be fair and
detached were placed squarely on
the shoulders of the host nation."
He would also like to see the
elimination of listing medal totals
by nation, but admits that "this
element most probably would be
difficult to control."
Even the basic format of the
Games should be changed. Under
the present methods, the
Olympics are "too large and
cumbersome for feasible, efficient
operation. And the exorbitant
expense discourages or prevents
less affluent nations from
sponsoring them."
Rotating Events
He suggests that the program
be split into four blocks of events
which would be held every four

years, but not all together. An
example of such a schedule would
be First year: Track and field,
swimming and aquatics; Second
year: Boating and sailing; Third
year: Combative and skill events
such as boxing, gymnastics, and
equestrian; Fourth year: Team
sports.
These would then rotate to
maintain the traditional four year
period between contests. If this
play were adopted, smaller
nations would have the
opportunity to host the Games,
since they would not have to
make as large an investment as is
presently needed. It would also be
advantageous to the spectator,
who is presently unable to see
much of the Games.
Jordan stated last week,
"Having been connected with the
Olympics since 1932, this [the
article] gave me a chance to put
down some of my ideas on paper.
Some critics have argued that the
Games should be done away with.
I don't go along with this. I feel
that there are still many more
good features than bad in the
Games."
He went on to say that it was
"concern; a feeling that it is a
worthwhile thing" that prompted
him to take his actions. "It's
always easier to criticize than to
offer constructive suggestions; but
that's what's needed—positive
rather than negative input."
Elicits Response
After the article was published,
Jordan wrote to several ranking
members of the government and
sports organizations. He enclosed
a copy of the article and asked for
comments. "The response was
genuine, prompt and
enthusiastic," he said. Although
not everyone agreed with all of
the proposals, they did offer
comments and suggestions.
Among those responding were
President Nixon, Lord Killanin
(President of the International
Olympic Committee), Clifford H.
Buck (president of the U.S.
Olympic Committee), AAU
president John B. Kelly, Jr.,
congressman Robert Mathias
(18th California District) and Jack
Kemp (38th N.Y. Dist.). He also
received replies from the Japanese
head coach, Mikio Oda and the
Soviet Union's head coach.
In recent weeks, much has
been written about this and
related problems. Action is
already underway. Congress is
looking into the United States
Olympic Committee (USOC),
which operates through a federal
charter. There are several bills in
the legislature concerning the
problem.
Jordan is optimistic about the
chances for reform. "By 1976,
we'll see a different picture. How
different is hard to say; but there
will be definite reforms and
improvements."
