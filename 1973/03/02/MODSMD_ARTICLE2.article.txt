# Ousted From Stanford In 1951
## Court Nominee Suspension Told 
### DAVID THIEMANN 
William P. Clark, the Stanford
alumnus Governor Ronald Reagan
nominated to the California Supreme
Court, was suspended from the
University for "academic deficiency"
and dropped out in 1951 while he was
on academic probation, the Daily
learned yesterday.
Clark, now a Los Angeles appellate
court judge, confirmed the suspension
and probation by phone yesterday."I
don't know the term for it —

disqualification or suspension — but I
was out for a while," he said.
He explained that he worked
full-time while attending Stanford,
lowering his grades.
Clark's nomination has attracted
controversy because he flunked out of
Loyola Law School in his third year,
failed to obtain a law degree, and did
not earn an undergraduate degree.
During his freshman year here, the
judicial nominee attempted 31 units —
two-thirds of the normal load — with a
D+ average, according to the "bailout"
gradesheet then printed in the student
directory.
Public Grade Average
The bailout listed the number of
units a student attempted and his
cumulative gradepoint on an A=2,
B=l, C=o, D=-l, F=-2 scale.
After three quarters' suspension,
Clark returned to the University in
spring quarter, 1951. In the next three
quarters he completed 42 more units
and raised his grade average to a C-,
but remained on academic probation.
He then transferred to the
University of Santa Clara for a
semester, completing 32 more units
for a 105 unit total before dropping
out without declaring a major.
Qualifications Hearing
California's three-member
Commission on Judicial Appointments
will hold a public hearing on Clark's
appointment today in San Francisco.
All three commission members have
a stake in the outcome of the hearing.
Supreme Court Chief Justice Donald
Wright, a Reagan appointee who has
disappointed the Governor with his
liberal performance on the bench, will
serve with Clark if he wins approval.
Chief Appeals Justice Parker Wood
will sit on the same bench with the
nominee if he fails to receive
commission approval. And Attorney
General Evelle Younger, the third
member, hopes to run for Governor in
1976 and may not wish to antagonize
Reagan on this issue.
Organized Opposition
The California Trial Lawyers
Association has vigorously opposed
the nomination. The trial lawyers
publicly asked Reagan to rescind the
appointment, and failing that asked
Clark himself to withdraw.
University of California law school
faculties at the Berkeley, San
Francisco, and Los Angeles campuses
have also opposed Clark, asserting that
"there seems to be considerable doubt
that Clark has the high qualifications
that ought to be required."
But all three California chapters of
the Association of Defense Counsels
have supported Clark, stating that
"beyond question he is eminently
qualified to serve on the State
Supreme Court."
Bar Review
Chief Justice Wright, who will
preside at the hearing today, asked the
board of governors of the State Bar to
review Clark's qualifications and
assemble relevant factual material, but
cautioned it against recommending
approval or rejection.

A spokesman for Reagan expressed
the Governor's "surprise" at Wright's
unusual request for assistance.
Commission hearings usually are
15-minute, pro forma affairs. The
group last rejected a nominee in 1942,
when it disapproved the nomination of
an alleged Communist "fellow
traveler."
Legal Experience
After flunking out of Loyola and
having a petition for readmission
denied, Clark passed the state bar
examination on his second attempt,
and entered general private practice in
Oxnard in 1958.
In 1967, he became Reagan's
executive secretary. The Governor
appointed C'ark to the San Luis
Obispo Superior Court in 1969, and
