# Match Play Begins In S.F. City Golf
## 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
It's strictly head to head
competition now in the San
Francisco City Golf
Championships, and Bruce
Robertson, Conrad Nilmeier, Dave
Baskins, and Bob Chapman are
looking forward to the challenge.
The four Stanford sophomores
were among 64 players who
survived last weekend's 36 hole
qualifying to earn a spot in
tomorrow's first round of match
play at Harding Park. Robertson
was particularly impressive in the

qualifying rounds, firing 72-73 for
a 145 total, one stroke off the
pace set by medalist Bob Sheely.
Nilmeier shot 148, Baskins
149, and Chapman 151, all
comfortably under the 153 score
needed to make the cut. Nine
Stanford players failed to qualify,
however, including last year's
co-medalist Tom Keelin and Card
number-two man Aly Trompas.
Intriguing Format
Stanford's four representatives
are glad that qualifying is behind
them so they can concentrate on
the intriguing match play format,
where cumulative scores don't
matter, only the hole by hole
scores against a single opponent.
"I enjoy match play," said
Baskins. "I like to see my
opponent and it's much easier to
play against a person than against
par."
Baskins, who reached the
quarterfinals of last year's
tourney, will face Skip Thompson
tomorrow in his first round
match.
Gamble More
Robertson, last year's runnerup
and a semifinalist two years ago,
also expressed a preference for
match play. "You don't have to
play as conservative in match
play," he said. "You can afford to
gamble a lot more." Robertson
will face Scott Hoyt in

tomorrow's first round, while
Nilmeier will go against Bruce
Pluim and Chapman is matched
against Warren Jones.
First round winners will play
again on Sunday, with the third
and fourth round matches
scheduled for next weekend and
the semifinals and finals on March
17 and 18.
Stanford will return to

intercollegiate action on Tuesday
when the cards travel to Silverado
Country Club in Napa for the 36
hole Cal State-Hay ward
tournament. Robertson, Nilmeier,
Baskins, Chapman, Aly Trompas,
and Denny Colvin will probably
represent Stanford in that event,
although George Pettinger still has
an outside chance to make the top
six.

SET FOR THE ClTY—Sophomore Conrad Nilmeier's putting stroke
has never been the strongest part of his game, but he hopes to be hot
on the greens tomorrow when match play begins in the San Francisco
City Championships. Nilmeier qualified with a 148 score last weekend
and will face Bruce Pluim tomorrow's first round.
