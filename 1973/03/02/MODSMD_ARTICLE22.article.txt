# Top High School QB Decides On Stanford
## 
### 
John Ralston came up with a
replacement for Heisman Trophy
winner Jim Plunkett; Jack
Christiansen found someone to
take over for Plunkett's successor
Don Bunce; and it looks like
Christiansen is a year ahead of
himself in finding a quarterback
to replace Mike Boryla.
Mike Cordova, Parade
magazine's first team high school
All-American quarterback,
announced this week that he will
sign a letter of intent to Stanford.
The 6-4, 215 pounder from
Seattle won't be officially
committed to Stanford until the
Pacific Eight Conference makes
letters of intent available on
March 12, but he decided to

"announce the decision now to
help get everybody off my back."
About 30 schools were after
Cordova, who was also an
All-State linebacker. "I chose
Stanford because they will allow
me to play quarterback as long as
I want. Many of the other schools
wanted me as a linebacker."
In his senior season Cordova
threw for 1900 yards, completing
61 of 115 passes. Only four of his
aerials were intercepted and he
also ran for 266 yards.
Although the admissions office
won't make its final decisions
until April 15, Cordova's football
credentials and a 3.5 academic
average would seem to insure his
admission.
