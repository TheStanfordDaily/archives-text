# Yes, There Is A Bowling Team
## Stanford Ten-Pinners Bowl'Em Over 
### LARRY FLEECE 
Did you know that Stanford
has a bowling team?
Well, it does. And a very good
one at that. The 10-man squad is
presently in second place in the
tough Northern California
Inter-collegiate Masters' (NCIM)
League, and the top five team
members boast an impressive set
of averages. 5
Team leader Dave Partridge is
high man on the ladder, with an
overall average for the year of
198. He is followed by Rueben
Casarez at 197, freshmen Terry
Fry and Mike Best at 196 and
190, and team captain Neil
Hannahs at 190.
The team has competed
regularly throughout the year in

the NCIM league, against some of
the top amateur bowlers in the
nation. After the first half of the
league, completed on Jan. 13,
Stanford was in fourth place
behind U.C. Davis and Santa
Clara. With the second half of the
league just begun, Stanford holds
second place behind Santa Clara.
U.C. Davis and San Jose State
both field two teams in the
league. Other teams in the league
are Stanford, Santa Clara, DeAnza
College, and Chico State.
No Coaching
The Stanford bowlers practice
diligently at Tresidder Union
Alleys, without the aid of a coach.
"We try to work together and
coach each other," explained
team captain Hannahs, a 4-year
veteran of the team. "We had
some problems earlier in the year
because only two of us (Hannahs
and Casarez, a 3-year veteran)
were returnees from last year. We
just didn't know each other well
enough to do a good job of
coaching each other."
But through serious daily
practice, the bowlers have begun
to function as a team. According
to Best, "most of the guys on the
team bowl an average of 15-18
games a week." Best, who before
coming to Stanford was a member
of the West Coast Amateur Tour
and was the number-one junior
bowler in La City, speaks of his
respect for his teammates. For
example, he -says, "Dave
(Partridge) is super-conscientious
about his bowling game. He's got
smooth form and can score high,
but beyond that, he's a good
leader and a great coach."
Partridge presently holds the
high single-game score in the
NCIM league competition, a 279.
To complement this, the Stanford
team also holds the high
single-game score in the league for
a five-man team, a 1075, or an
average of 215 per man. The team
fired this game in competition
held at its own Tresidder Lanes in
December of last year.
300 Game
But some of the most exciting
scores can occur during practice.
Fry, in only his second day of

practice for the team last fall,
fired a perfect 300 game, and a
735 series on the Tresidder lanes.
The 300 game was only the third
in Tresidder's history. Fry,
averaging 196, has continued to
be a top performer for the team
during the year.
Beyond its regular league
competition, the team bowled in
the Regional Championships held
in San Luis Obispo Feb. 17-18.
Although the team did not place
in the championships, in which
30-40 teams from all over
California compete, Dave
Partridge made a good showing in
the individual category, bowling
1820 for 9 games, or an average of
202 per game.
The next league competition
for the team will be on March 10
at DeAnza College. In store for
the spring quarter are several
challenge matches, with UCLA
and possibly Washington State.
But perhaps the biggest
upcoming bowling event will be
the Stanford Individual Scratch
Championships, to be held April
14-15 on the Tresidder lanes. The
tournament, initiated and
arranged by this year's bowling
team, will host teams from "as far
north as British Columbia, as far
east as Nevada, as far south as San
Diego, and as far west as Hawaii,"
according to Best.
In the more distant future for
the team next year will be its
entrance into several southern
California bowling tournaments,
as well as a trip to the prestigious
Showboat Tournament, held
annually in Las Vegas.
Lack of Funds
One of the largest problems
facing the bowling team has been
financing. As a club sport,
bowling receives a small subsidy
from the Athletic Department for
its activities. But there are some
major expenses in bowling,
particularly the cost of practice
time on the lanes, which the
athletic department funds do not
cover.
"The guys on the team have
paid for practice games and for
their uniforms out of their own
pockets," said Hannahs. He

mentioned that the problem has
been heightened by the financial
difficulties of Tresidder Union.
As a partial solution to these
financial problems, the team
members have set up a Saturday
morning junior league at Tresidder
Alleys, open to children from ages
7-16.
One area for further
development in the Stanford
bowling program is the rebuilding
of a girls' bowling team. Although
Stanford in the past had an able
and enthusiastic girls' team,
interest in the team was severely

hurt last year with the departure
of coach Shirley Shoof. The
Athletic Department was no
longer able to maintain Shoof's
salary, and since then the girls'
team has been struggling with
"four, sometimes five" girls,
according to Hannahs, often
unable to compete in tournament
play because of shortage of girls.
This year the men's team has
sought to re-enlist female
Stanford bowlers, and its efforts
should pay off. "The prospects
for a girls' team are looking much
better for spring quarter," said
Hannahs.

Fry and Mike Best at 196 and
190, and team captain Neil
Hannahs at 190.
The team has competed
regularly throughout the year in

the NCIM league, against some of
the top amateur bowlers in the
nation. After the first half of the
league, completed on Jan. 13,
Stanford was in fourth place
behind U.C. Davis and Santa
Clara. With the second half of the
league just begun, Stanford holds
second place behind Santa Clara.
U.C. Davis and San Jose State
both field two teams in the
league. Other teams in the league
are Stanford, Santa Clara, DeAnza
College, and Chico State.
No Coaching
The Stanford bowlers practice
diligently at Tresidder Union
Alleys, without the aid of a coach.
"We try to work together and
coach each other," explained
team captain Hannahs, a 4-year
veteran of the team. "We had
some problems earlier in the year
because only two of us (Hannahs
and Casarez, a 3-year veteran)
were returnees from last year. We
just didn't know each other well
enough to do a good job of
coaching each other."
But through serious daily
practice, the bowlers have begun
to function as a team. According
to Best, "most of the guys on the
team bowl an average of 15-18
games a week." Best, who before
coming to Stanford was a member
of the West Coast Amateur Tour
and was the number-one junior
bowler in La City, speaks of his
respect for his teammates. For
example, he -says, "Dave
(Partridge) is super-conscientious
about his bowling game. He's got
smooth form and can score high,
but beyond that, he's a good
leader and a great coach."
Partridge presently holds the
high single-game score in the
NCIM league competition, a 279.
To complement this, the Stanford
team also holds the high
single-game score in the league for
a five-man team, a 1075, or an
average of 215 per man. The team
fired this game in competition
held at its own Tresidder Lanes in
December of last year.
300 Game
But some of the most exciting
scores can occur during practice.
Fry, in only his second day of

practice for the team last fall,
fired a perfect 300 game, and a
735 series on the Tresidder lanes.
The 300 game was only the third
in Tresidder's history. Fry,
averaging 196, has continued to
be a top performer for the team
during the year.
Beyond its regular league
competition, the team bowled in
the Regional Championships held
in San Luis Obispo Feb. 17-18.
Although the team did not place
in the championships, in which
30-40 teams from all over
California compete, Dave
Partridge made a good showing in
the individual category, bowling
1820 for 9 games, or an average of
202 per game.
The next league competition
for the team will be on March 10
at DeAnza College. In store for
the spring quarter are several
challenge matches, with UCLA
and possibly Washington State.
But perhaps the biggest
upcoming bowling event will be
the Stanford Individual Scratch
Championships, to be held April
14-15 on the Tresidder lanes. The
tournament, initiated and
arranged by this year's bowling
team, will host teams from "as far
north as British Columbia, as far
east as Nevada, as far south as San
Diego, and as far west as Hawaii,"
according to Best.
In the more distant future for
the team next year will be its
entrance into several southern
California bowling tournaments,
as well as a trip to the prestigious
Showboat Tournament, held
annually in Las Vegas.
Lack of Funds
One of the largest problems
facing the bowling team has been
financing. As a club sport,
bowling receives a small subsidy
from the Athletic Department for
its activities. But there are some
major expenses in bowling,
particularly the cost of practice
time on the lanes, which the
athletic department funds do not
cover.
"The guys on the team have
paid for practice games and for
their uniforms out of their own
pockets," said Hannahs. He

mentioned that the problem has
been heightened by the financial
difficulties of Tresidder Union.
As a partial solution to these
financial problems, the team
members have set up a Saturday
morning junior league at Tresidder
Alleys, open to children from ages
7-16.
One area for further
development in the Stanford
bowling program is the rebuilding
of a girls' bowling team. Although
Stanford in the past had an able
and enthusiastic girls' team,
interest in the team was severely

hurt last year with the departure
of coach Shirley Shoof. The
Athletic Department was no
longer able to maintain Shoof's
salary, and since then the girls'
team has been struggling with
"four, sometimes five" girls,
according to Hannahs, often
unable to compete in tournament
play because of shortage of girls.
This year the men's team has
sought to re-enlist female
Stanford bowlers, and its efforts
should pay off. "The prospects
for a girls' team are looking much
better for spring quarter," said
Hannahs.

both field two teams in the
league. Other teams in the league
are Stanford, Santa Clara, DeAnza
College, and Chico State.
No Coaching
The Stanford bowlers practice
diligently at Tresidder Union
Alleys, without the aid of a coach.
"We try to work together and
coach each other," explained
team captain Hannahs, a 4-year
veteran of the team. "We had
some problems earlier in the year
because only two of us (Hannahs
and Casarez, a 3-year veteran)
were returnees from last year. We
just didn't know each other well
enough to do a good job of
coaching each other."
But through serious daily
practice, the bowlers have begun
to function as a team. According
to Best, "most of the guys on the
team bowl an average of 15-18
games a week." Best, who before
coming to Stanford was a member
of the West Coast Amateur Tour
and was the number-one junior
bowler in La City, speaks of his
respect for his teammates. For
example, he -says, "Dave
(Partridge) is super-conscientious
about his bowling game. He's got
smooth form and can score high,
but beyond that, he's a good
leader and a great coach."
Partridge presently holds the
high single-game score in the
NCIM league competition, a 279.
To complement this, the Stanford
team also holds the high
single-game score in the league for
a five-man team, a 1075, or an
average of 215 per man. The team
fired this game in competition
held at its own Tresidder Lanes in
December of last year.
300 Game
But some of the most exciting
scores can occur during practice.
Fry, in only his second day of

practice for the team last fall,
fired a perfect 300 game, and a
735 series on the Tresidder lanes.
The 300 game was only the third
in Tresidder's history. Fry,
averaging 196, has continued to
be a top performer for the team
during the year.
Beyond its regular league
competition, the team bowled in
the Regional Championships held
in San Luis Obispo Feb. 17-18.
Although the team did not place
in the championships, in which
30-40 teams from all over
California compete, Dave
Partridge made a good showing in
the individual category, bowling
1820 for 9 games, or an average of
202 per game.
The next league competition
for the team will be on March 10
at DeAnza College. In store for
the spring quarter are several
challenge matches, with UCLA
and possibly Washington State.
But perhaps the biggest
upcoming bowling event will be
the Stanford Individual Scratch
Championships, to be held April
14-15 on the Tresidder lanes. The
tournament, initiated and
arranged by this year's bowling
team, will host teams from "as far
north as British Columbia, as far
east as Nevada, as far south as San
Diego, and as far west as Hawaii,"
according to Best.
In the more distant future for
the team next year will be its
entrance into several southern
California bowling tournaments,
as well as a trip to the prestigious
Showboat Tournament, held
annually in Las Vegas.
Lack of Funds
One of the largest problems
facing the bowling team has been
financing. As a club sport,
bowling receives a small subsidy
from the Athletic Department for
its activities. But there are some
major expenses in bowling,
particularly the cost of practice
time on the lanes, which the
athletic department funds do not
cover.
"The guys on the team have
paid for practice games and for
their uniforms out of their own
pockets," said Hannahs. He

mentioned that the problem has
been heightened by the financial
difficulties of Tresidder Union.
As a partial solution to these
financial problems, the team
members have set up a Saturday
morning junior league at Tresidder
Alleys, open to children from ages
7-16.
One area for further
development in the Stanford
bowling program is the rebuilding
of a girls' bowling team. Although
Stanford in the past had an able
and enthusiastic girls' team,
interest in the team was severely

hurt last year with the departure
of coach Shirley Shoof. The
Athletic Department was no
longer able to maintain Shoof's
salary, and since then the girls'
team has been struggling with
"four, sometimes five" girls,
according to Hannahs, often
unable to compete in tournament
play because of shortage of girls.
This year the men's team has
sought to re-enlist female
Stanford bowlers, and its efforts
should pay off. "The prospects
for a girls' team are looking much
better for spring quarter," said
Hannahs.

lefthanded form during a practice game at the Tresidder Lanes. Best is
one of five Stanford bowlers averaging 190 or better for the season.
Did you know that Stanford
has a bowling team?
Well, it does. And a very good
one at that. The 10-man squad is
presently in second place in the
tough Northern California
Inter-collegiate Masters' (NCIM)
League, and the top five team
members boast an impressive set
of averages. 5
Team leader Dave Partridge is
high man on the ladder, with an
overall average for the year of
198. He is followed by Rueben
Casarez at 197, freshmen Terry
Fry and Mike Best at 196 and

Hannahs at 190.
The team has competed
regularly throughout the year in

the NCIM league, against some of
the top amateur bowlers in the
nation. After the first half of the
league, completed on Jan. 13,
Stanford was in fourth place
behind U.C. Davis and Santa
Clara. With the second half of the
league just begun, Stanford holds
second place behind Santa Clara.
