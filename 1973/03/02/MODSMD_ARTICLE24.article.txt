# Bruins Await Victim Number 70
## Cards Travel South To Face USC, UCLA 
### STAN WILSON 
Two things will almost
certainly happen when Stanford
travels to Los Angeles this
weekend to face USC and UCLA
— the Bruins will win their
70th-straight basketball game and
Stanford's Rich Kelley will score
his 400 th point.
UCLA can clinch its
seventh-straight conference
championship (11 in the last 12
years) tonight with a win over Cal
in Pauley Pavilion. Kelley, the
Cards' seven-foot sophomore

center, needs only 11 points to
join the "mythical" 400-point
club. He scored 39 points in last
weekend's victories over
Washington and Washington State.
The talented post man
continues to dominate Stanford
scoring and rebounding statistics
with averages of 17.7 and 13.3.
"Kelley has become an
outstanding shooter away from
the basket, and he is a more
physical player now than when we
first saw him," said Huskie coach
Marv Harshman. "Outside of (Bill)
Walton, he's the best big man we
have faced all year."
Invincible
The Bruins, seemingly
unbeatable at any time, are
unquestionably invincible at
Pauley. Still, coach John Wooden
spoke about this weekend's games
with his usual pretense of
apprehension. "Both Cal and
Stanford appear to be
considerably improved with
decisive wins over the weekend
and we must not take them for
granted because we are playing at
home."

UCLA posted a pair of "close"
wins last weekend in the hostile
Northwest, outplaying Oregon
State 73-67, and outfighting
Oregon 72-61.
"I'm hoping that we can clinch
the conference title on Friday so
as to remove all the pressure
before going into NCAA
tournament play," Wooden said.
"For the first time this season
some of our players are showing
signs of either mental, emotional,
or physical fatigue, and a few
days' respite should be beneficial
to our chances in tournament
play."
Obviously Wooden, celebrating
his silver anniversary as head
coach at Westwood, is confident
that his Bruins will represent the
Pac-8 in the NCAA tournament.
And Stanford head coach Howie
Dallmar won't argue that point.
Not Worrying
"I don't know whether anyone
should really worry about UCLA.
Let's just say we'll start thinking
about them sometime late Friday
night," Dallmar said.
Stanford forwards Dave Frost

and Bob Buell must be leading the
Pac-8 in at least one statistical
category — freak accidents. Frost,
a 6-6 junior, twisted his ankle on
Monday while shooting all by
himself, and Buell was cracked in
the face two weeks ago by an
unidentified elbow which left the
left side of his face sore and his
head ringing. The bone may be
broken.
Dallmar has indicated that
sophomore Scott Trobbe may
start in place of Buell, but the
lineup won't be determined until
tonight. "If Trobbe starts it will
mean four sophomores in the
lineup, and we haven't seen that
at Stanford in a long time."

The other three will be Kelley
and guards Mark Gilberg (6-0) and
Mel Arterberry (6-3). Junior
forward Mike Mann (6-9), who
turned in one of his best
performances last weekend, will
round out the starting five.
Tonight's 8 p.m. game against
USC will be especially significant
since the Trojans need to win two
of their three remaining games to
insure an invitation to the NIT.
USC is 8-3 in Pac-8 play and 17-7
overall.
Tomorrow night Stanford will
match its 12-10 record (5-6 in the
league) against UCLA's typically
unblemished 23-0 mark.

The Bruins, seemingly
unbeatable at any time, are
unquestionably invincible at
Pauley. Still, coach John Wooden
spoke about this weekend's games
with his usual pretense of
apprehension. "Both Cal and
Stanford appear to be
considerably improved with
decisive wins over the weekend
and we must not take them for
granted because we are playing at
home."

UCLA posted a pair of "close"
wins last weekend in the hostile
Northwest, outplaying Oregon
State 73-67, and outfighting
Oregon 72-61.
"I'm hoping that we can clinch
the conference title on Friday so
as to remove all the pressure
before going into NCAA
tournament play," Wooden said.
"For the first time this season
some of our players are showing
signs of either mental, emotional,
or physical fatigue, and a few
days' respite should be beneficial
to our chances in tournament
play."
Obviously Wooden, celebrating
his silver anniversary as head
coach at Westwood, is confident
that his Bruins will represent the
Pac-8 in the NCAA tournament.
And Stanford head coach Howie
Dallmar won't argue that point.
Not Worrying
"I don't know whether anyone
should really worry about UCLA.
Let's just say we'll start thinking
about them sometime late Friday
night," Dallmar said.
Stanford forwards Dave Frost

and Bob Buell must be leading the
Pac-8 in at least one statistical
category — freak accidents. Frost,
a 6-6 junior, twisted his ankle on
Monday while shooting all by
himself, and Buell was cracked in
the face two weeks ago by an
unidentified elbow which left the
left side of his face sore and his
head ringing. The bone may be
broken.
Dallmar has indicated that
sophomore Scott Trobbe may
start in place of Buell, but the
lineup won't be determined until
tonight. "If Trobbe starts it will
mean four sophomores in the
lineup, and we haven't seen that
at Stanford in a long time."

The other three will be Kelley
and guards Mark Gilberg (6-0) and
Mel Arterberry (6-3). Junior
forward Mike Mann (6-9), who
turned in one of his best
performances last weekend, will
round out the starting five.
Tonight's 8 p.m. game against
USC will be especially significant
since the Trojans need to win two
of their three remaining games to
insure an invitation to the NIT.
USC is 8-3 in Pac-8 play and 17-7
overall.
Tomorrow night Stanford will
match its 12-10 record (5-6 in the
league) against UCLA's typically
unblemished 23-0 mark.
Two things will almost
certainly happen when Stanford
travels to Los Angeles this
weekend to face USC and UCLA
— the Bruins will win their
70th-straight basketball game and
Stanford's Rich Kelley will score
his 400 th point.
UCLA can clinch its
seventh-straight conference
championship (11 in the last 12
years) tonight with a win over Cal
in Pauley Pavilion. Kelley, the
Cards' seven-foot sophomore

center, needs only 11 points to
join the "mythical" 400-point
club. He scored 39 points in last
weekend's victories over
Washington and Washington State.
The talented post man
continues to dominate Stanford
scoring and rebounding statistics
with averages of 17.7 and 13.3.
"Kelley has become an
outstanding shooter away from
the basket, and he is a more
physical player now than when we
first saw him," said Huskie coach
Marv Harshman. "Outside of (Bill)
Walton, he's the best big man we
have faced all year."
