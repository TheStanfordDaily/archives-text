# Cards, Bears Battle For 'Big Scrum' Axe
## 
### PETE BHATIA 
Stanford's rugby team faces perhaps its toughest opponent of the
season when the Cards meet California in the 13th session of the 'Big
Scrum Axe' rugby series tomorrow at 1:30 on the Stanford Rugby
Field.
The Bears, who are undefeated this season, were last season's
victors, but trail in the overall series 7-5. Each year the winner is
determined by the combined points in the two encounters between
the teams. The second half of this season's struggle will be next

Saturday in Berkeley.
The Cards lost their first
collegiate tilt of the season last
weekend to defending NCAA
champion UCLA 12-6, dropping
their season record to 6-3.
Stanford's other losses came
against the Bay Area Touring
Side, 32-12, and the Peninsula
Ramblers, 16-3.
The teams have had five
common adversaries in San Jose
State, USC, UCLA, UCSB, and St.
Mary's. Both sides beat all but
UCLA handily with the Bears
edging the Bruins 7-6.
Stanford coach Pete Kmetovic
said "Cal should be favored but
we're not out of it by any
means." The Bears sport speedy
inside backs in Steve Finau, Terry
Buchanan and Bill Armstrong.
Team captain for Cal is forward
Loren Toews who is a breakaway
threat comparable to Stanford
forward Tom Klein.
The Bears will outweigh the
Cards by 20 pounds per man in
the front line but Kmetovic
emphasized that Stanford's
strength is a "solid scrum."
