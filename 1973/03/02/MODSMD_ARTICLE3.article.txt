# 18 Candidates To Run For P.A. City Council
## 
### ROBERT BACON 
Palo Altans will choose six city
council members from a field of 18
candidates on May 8. Sixteen of the
hopefuls filed on Thursday morning in
the last hours before the deadline.
The liberal "residentialist"
Association for a Balanced
Community (ABC) and the more
conservative "establishment" Palo
Alto '73 each are running afullslateof
six candidates. Four hopefuls carry the
banner of the radical Palo Alto
Community Coalition. Two
independent candidates are also in the
race.
Stanford Law Prof. Byron D. Sher,
a former councilman, is on ABC's
ticket. John Philo, a physics graduate
student, is one of the Community
Coalition candidates.
Voters in Palo Alto, which does not
include the central campus or the
student and faculty housing areas, will
fill five four-year terms and one
two-year term on the council. Only
three of the nine incumbents need not
face the voters.
16 Running
Sixteen candidates are seeking the
five four-year terms. All run at-large;
the seats are not individually
numbered.
For the four-year terms, ABC has
endorsed Sher; Mayor Kirke
Comstock, a 10-year veteran of the
Council; Councilwoman Sylvia Seman,
incumbent for the short term who has
decided to seek a full term instead; Dr.
Allen Seid, a psychiatrist active in the
city drug abuse program; and Thomas
O. Passell, a research scientist who has
long been active in "residential"
political groups.
The Palo Alto '73 slate for the
four-year terms includes Vice-Mayor
Stanley Norton; Councilmen John J.
Beahrs and John V. Berwald; architect
Elvia Garwood; and Anne
Witherspoon, a rapid transit booster.
Community Coalition
The Community Coalition
candidates are veteran peace activist
Douglas Mattern; Jeffrey Youdelman
of Venceremos; Carol Peterson, an
advocate of child care services; and
Philo, who is active in the Palo Alto
Tenants Union and serves as a student

member of the Trustee Committee on
Land and Buildings.
The two independent candidates
are also seeking four-year seats. They
are John D. Snow, long active in
veterans' organizations, and Robert
Cullenbine, one-time director of the
now-defunct Midpeninsula Free
University.
Seeking the remaining two years of
the term to which Seman was
appointed are ABC candidate Emily
Renzel, a conservationist concerned
about Stanford land development
policy, and Roy Clay, operator of an
executive placement firm and member
of the Palo Alto Housing Corporation
board, the choice of Palo Alto '73.
Last Hour
All except Snow and Beahrs filed
on Thursday morning, with most
waiting until the last hour to hand
their papers to City Clerk Ann Tanner.
Sher was elected to the council in
1965, but two years later was one of
four "residentialists" removed from
office in a stormy recall election.
From 1968 to 1970, he was
chairman of the University Human
Relations Commission. In 1971 he
served on panels which examined
grievances of five University
employees fired in circumstances
related to the April 1971 Stanford
Hospital sit-in.
Land Development
Stanford land development policy
will probably be a major issue in the
campaign, as it has been in past city
elections.
Over the last decade, the principal
cleavage in Palo Alto politics has been
between "residentialists" who want to
maintain the city as principally a
residential one, and the so-called
"establishment" which has sought
additional commercial and industrial
firms for the city.
After six years in the minority, the
residentialists gained a 5-4 council
majority in December 1971 when
Seman was appointed to the council
for the remainder of the term vacated
by "establishment" councilwoman
Frances Dias, who left the city.
"Residentialists" won three of the
four seats at stake two years ago; Dias
was the only "establishment"
candidate elected in 1971.

residentialists gained a 5-4 council
majority in December 1971 when
Seman was appointed to the council
for the remainder of the term vacated
by "establishment" councilwoman
Frances Dias, who left the city.
"Residentialists" won three of the
four seats at stake two years ago; Dias
was the only "establishment"
candidate elected in 1971.
Palo Altans will choose six city
council members from a field of 18
candidates on May 8. Sixteen of the

Community (ABC) and the more
conservative "establishment" Palo
Alto '73 each are running afullslateof
six candidates. Four hopefuls carry the
banner of the radical Palo Alto
Community Coalition. Two
independent candidates are also in the
race.
Stanford Law Prof. Byron D. Sher,
a former councilman, is on ABC's
ticket. John Philo, a physics graduate
student, is one of the Community
Coalition candidates.
Voters in Palo Alto, which does not
include the central campus or the
student and faculty housing areas, will
fill five four-year terms and one
two-year term on the council. Only
three of the nine incumbents need not
face the voters.
16 Running
Sixteen candidates are seeking the
five four-year terms. All run at-large;
the seats are not individually
numbered.
For the four-year terms, ABC has
endorsed Sher; Mayor Kirke
Comstock, a 10-year veteran of the
Council; Councilwoman Sylvia Seman,
incumbent for the short term who has
decided to seek a full term instead; Dr.
Allen Seid, a psychiatrist active in the
city drug abuse program; and Thomas
O. Passell, a research scientist who has
long been active in "residential"
political groups.
The Palo Alto '73 slate for the
four-year terms includes Vice-Mayor
Stanley Norton; Councilmen John J.
Beahrs and John V. Berwald; architect
Elvia Garwood; and Anne
Witherspoon, a rapid transit booster.
Community Coalition
The Community Coalition
candidates are veteran peace activist
Douglas Mattern; Jeffrey Youdelman
of Venceremos; Carol Peterson, an
advocate of child care services; and
Philo, who is active in the Palo Alto
Tenants Union and serves as a student

member of the Trustee Committee on
Land and Buildings.
The two independent candidates
are also seeking four-year seats. They
are John D. Snow, long active in
veterans' organizations, and Robert
Cullenbine, one-time director of the
now-defunct Midpeninsula Free
University.
Seeking the remaining two years of
the term to which Seman was
appointed are ABC candidate Emily
Renzel, a conservationist concerned
about Stanford land development
policy, and Roy Clay, operator of an
executive placement firm and member
of the Palo Alto Housing Corporation
board, the choice of Palo Alto '73.
Last Hour

on Thursday morning, with most
waiting until the last hour to hand
their papers to City Clerk Ann Tanner.
Sher was elected to the council in
1965, but two years later was one of
four "residentialists" removed from
office in a stormy recall election.
From 1968 to 1970, he was
chairman of the University Human
Relations Commission. In 1971 he
served on panels which examined
grievances of five University
employees fired in circumstances
related to the April 1971 Stanford
Hospital sit-in.
Land Development
Stanford land development policy
will probably be a major issue in the
campaign, as it has been in past city
elections.
Over the last decade, the principal
cleavage in Palo Alto politics has been
between "residentialists" who want to
maintain the city as principally a
residential one, and the so-called
"establishment" which has sought
additional commercial and industrial
firms for the city.
