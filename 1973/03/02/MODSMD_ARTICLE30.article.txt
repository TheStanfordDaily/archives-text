# Face Alumni Tonight
## JV Cagers Seek Eighth Straight Win 
### MARK WHITE 
Having recorded its seventh consecutive
victory, in an 86-78 win over Santa Clara
Wednesday, Stanford's junior varsity
basketball team goes after its eighth in a row
tonight when the Cards face former Stanford
basketball greats in the annual Alumni game
at 8 p.m. in Maples Pavilion. The Cards then
travel to Moraga tomorrow for an encounter
with St. Mary's.
If the last two years are any indication,
tonight's contest may provide theJV'swith all
they can handle. Last year Mai McElwain, a
1969 graduate who stands 17th on the
all-time Stanford scoring list, led the Alumni
to a 97-74 victory by pouring in 32 points.
McElwain is slated for tonight's contest
along with several other former Stanford
greats; former Warrior player Art Harris; John
Arillaga, 14th on the all-time list; Gary
Petersmeyer; Greg Osborn, and Gary Cain.
Comeback Victory
Stanford o.vercame a tight man-to-man
defense and a seven point halftime deficit to
beat Santa Clara two days ago. The game was
a long uphill climb for the Cards as the

Broncos scored the first 12 points of the
contest and Stanford took three quarters of
the game to catch up.
Santa Clara's agile, strong postman, John
Hubbard, opened the game with two quick
buckets and with Stanford missing its first five
shots, Santa Clara established the tempo of
the game.
Stanford attempted to crack Santa Clara's
man-to-man defense by passing the ball into
Ed Schweitzer and Kevin Enright, but the big
Bronco front line repeatedly chucked the
passes away and Stanford lapsed into its early
season syndrome of turnovers and lumbering
movement.
Coach Billy Jones called a time-out at the
16 minute mark and seconds later Rich
Wohlstadter got Stanford on the board with
the first of several twisting drives to the
basket. Schweitzer got two close buckets 20
seconds later and then Wohlstadter followed
with two more careening baskets.
Stanford appeared ready to take control of
the game when the Cards trailed by only two
at the 13 minute mark, but started throwing
the ball away when Santa Clara tightened its

defense and by halftime Stanford trailed
45-38.
Schweitzer Controls
Schweitzer sparked the Cardinal comeback
when he took control of the defensive
backboard and began to go to the hoop with
14 footjumpers. In five minutes the 6-9
postman scored eight points and gradually the
Cards whittled away at Santa Clara's lead.
Wohlstadter again drove through heavy
traffic for a layup at the 13 minute mark to
pare Santa Clara's lead to one and seconds
later Steve Kristovitch followed with a drive
of his own which turned into a three point
play when he was fouled on the basket.
With their first lead of the game, 55-53, the
Cards were intent on putting Santa Clara
away. Marty Moroski and Schweitzer
combined for eight straight points and with a
nine point lead at the three quarter mark,
Stanford coasted to the 86-78 win.
Hubbard led Santa Clara with 32 points,
while Schweitzer poured in 28 for the Cards
and was backed by Enright, Wohlstadter and
Moroski who all scored in double figures.

MONTAGUE MAKES IT—Junior guard Jim Montague came off the
bench to score nine points last Saturday against Washington State,
including this 17 foot jumper. Stanford coach Howie Dallmar expects
Montague to see considerable action this weekend against (JSC and
UCLA in Los Angeles.
