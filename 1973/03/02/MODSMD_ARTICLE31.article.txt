# Santa Clara Rally Decks Cards, 4-3
## 
### 
By SCOTT DAILEY
By the seventh inning
yesterday, pitcher Dan Shaw
wasn't exactly cruising along, but
he seemed to be on his way to a
shutout over the Santa Clara
Broncos. He had given up a
scratch single in the third, and had
hit a couple of batters, but was
still smooth and enjoyed a lead as
Stanford had three runs on the
board.
Then Bronco shortstop Mike
Denevi shattered the shut-out
with a towering 410-foot blast to
left-center that cleared the home
run barrier and crashed into the
wooden fence that encloses
Sunken Diamond. Given this
dangerous encouragement, Santa
Clara chased Shaw in the eighth,
scoring three runs to win, 4-3.
The Cards will try to improve
on yesterday's less than clutch
performance this afternoon when
they host the University of
Nevada-Reno in a 2 p.m. contest
at Sunken Diamond.
Barring rain, the Cards will face
UC-Davis tomorrow in a 12 noon

double-header at home.
Then they will travel to
Candlestick Park on Sunday to
play the Nicaraguan national team
in the first game of a benefit
doubleheader to raise money for
Nicaragua's earthquake victims.
California will play the
Nicaraguans in the second game.
A 1 O'Brien somehow let Glenn
Holsclaw's grounder to third slip
through him into left field for an
error. Gene Delyon nailed a
double to right, struck out and
was thrown out of the game when
he protested a little too

vehemently, pinchhitter Phil
Convertino doubled to the
rightfield fence, driving in
Holsclaw and Delyon.
That was all for Shaw. Nick
Peterson came in and induced Jim
Wilhelm to ground out to Kim
Hannaford at short, but Mike Lee
lashed a single into left that
scored Convertino. Bob Hampton
overran the ball, and Lee scurried
to third. Further disaster was
averted when Denevi bounded out
to the shortstop.
Stanford had taken the lead in
the bottom of the sixth when

second baseman Joe Lamoure
doubled in Mark Lucich and
Mickey Aguirre.
O'Brien followed with a single
to center that scored Lamoure to
give the Cards a temporary 3-0
lead.

on second and third.
