Indians Free Hostages
WOUNDED KNEE, S.D. - The 11 persons held
hostage for two days by members of the American
Indian Movement were freed last night after the
militant Indians negotiated for more than two hours
with South Dakota's two U.S. Senators.
The freed hostages said they would stay in
Wounded Knee because it is their home, Sens.
George McGovern and James Abourezk told a news
conference.
McGovern and Abourezk said they would
continue to negotiate with AIM leaders, who had
asked to talk to the senators about Indian civil
rights and treaties.
"They are going to construct a tepee in a field
where the negotiations will be continued tonight,"
said McGovern.
McGovern and Abourezk said the hostages had
been released but were escorted about the village by
Indians and some of the houses were occupied by-
Indians.
"We saw some weapons, but they are not very
much in evidence," McGovern said.
He said the Indians wanted a full-scale Senate
hearing today at nearby Wounded Creek to discuss
their grievances.
"I said it was inappropriate," McGovern said. "I
told them we could not get all the members of the
Indian Affairs Committee here and besides we
wanted all Indians to be able to testify."
The two senators said they did not speak about
amnesty for the Indians.
"It is not in our province to deal with law
enforcement," McGovern said. "We came here to
try and avoid a hostile confrontation."
The Indians have said they want an immediate
Senate investigation of the Bureau of Indian Affairs
and Department of Interior "for their handling of
the Oglala Sioux Nation." They also asked for a
probe of what they said were violations of 371
Indian treaties.
Nixon Defends Cutbacks
WASHINGTON — President Nixon officially gave
up his long-troubled welfare reform plan yesterday
and defended cutbacks in other social programs.
Nixon also offered one of his most caustic
appraisals to date of the Great Society initiatives of
his predecessor, Lyndon B. Johnson.
"Well-intentioned as this effort may have been,"
declared the President, "the results in case after case
amounted to dismal failure."
Nixon said his rollbacks in the human resources
area had provoked "intense controversy and
considerable misunderstanding." But his proposed
expenditures of $125 billion represented "both a
generous budget and a reform budget,"he said.
Moreover, he noted, the total is "nearly twice the
amount that was being spent on such programs
when I took office in 1969."
The President said "the welfare mess cannot be
permitted to continue" and acknowledged he was
abandoning broad welfare reform "since the
legislative outlook seems to preclude passage ... in
the immediate future."
Nixon had wanted to replace categorical welfare
aid with the family assistance plan. It would have
guaranteed a minimum annual income to poor
families, while bolstering work requirements.
The President said he would follow through,
however, with vigorous steps to strengthen the
management of payments to families with
dependent children through both administrative and
unspecified legislative proposals. The system now,
he said, is "inequitable, inefficient and inadequate."
His remarks came in a 17-page document sent to
the Congress as one of a series of State of the Union
reports.
The President said that even as he is "irrevocably
committed ... to fulfilling the American dream for
all Americans," the best place to begin is "by
recognizing that by almost any measure, life is
better in 1973 than ever before in our history."

Dollar Tailspins
BONN — The dollar went into a tailspin yesterday
on European money markets left unconvinced by
President Nixon's 10 percent devaluation 17 days
ago.
The situation grew so acute that leading
European money markets, as well as Tokyo's,
decided to close today to bar all trading.
There was talk of joint action by the Common
Market countries. The British and German leaders,
Edward Heath and Willy Brandt, met. Germany's
central bank council held an 11-hour meeting.
Yesterday the European governments latched
onto a record $3'/2 billion to little avail.
West Germany's central bank bought up an
unprecedented $2.65 billion as part of the effort to
keep the dollar from falling and to keep its own
mark from rising in value.
All major European currencies, however, rose in
value against the dollar, including the British pound,
one of the weakest. The pound went above $2.50
for the first time since June.
This means Americans will have to pay even
more for European vacations and goods if the attack
on the dollar persists.
Nixon ordered the 10 percent devaluation last
month in what his administration described as a
move to make American goods less expensive to
foreigners. But to Americans it meant the price of
foreign goods went up.
The devaluation came after a rush from dollars
into West German marks and Japanese yen, regarded
as the world's strongest currencies.
Brandt called the emergency meeting of experts
soon after the arrival of Heath for two days of talks
centering on the money crisis.
Widespread belief that the two leaders would
agree on a joint float of Common Market currencies
against the dollar apparently triggered the wave of
selling.
Irish Ruling Party Loses
DUBLIN — Prime Minister Jack Lynch's ruling
party sank toward what he admitted looked like
defeat in Irish parliamentary elections, with returns
early today giving new seats to the opposition
coalition.
"It looks as though the coalition will form the
next government," Lynch said.
Counting of the votes for the 144 seats in the
lower house was adjourned early today, with 10
races still undecided. Lynch's party had won 64
seats to 68 for the coalition headed by Liam
Cosgrove. Independents held two.
Lynch admitted that his party could not hope to
win more than six of the remaining 10 seats, and
thus acknowledged he would not have a legislative
majority.
He said he will seek urgent talks with Cosgrove
on what he regards as the most pressing issue facing
Ireland — the expected British plan for Northern
Ireland, where Catholic gunmen are waging a
guerrilla war for union with this republic.
Lynch's party, the Fianne Fail, or Soldiers of
Destiny, had a slight lead over Cosgrove's coalition
in earlier returns from yesterday's election. Both
Lynch, 55, and Cosgrove, 52, held their seats in the
Dail.
The coalition consists of Cosgrove's Fine Gael —
Irish party and the union-backed Laborites. Fianna
Gael and Fianna Fail are the political heirs of the
rival sides in the Irish civil war of 1922-23.
Ex-POW Criticizes Protests
OAKLAND — Navy Lt. Cmdr. Everett Alvarez Jr.
said yesterday he thinks American antiwar protests
prolonged the Vietnam war and his imprisonment.
Although he spent BV2 years in a North
Vietnamese prison — nearly a quarter of his life and
the longest time for any American pilot — Alvarez
said the warm welcome in the United States
convinces him "It was all worth it."
Alvarez, 35, talked softly and appeared

somewhat nervous as he faced dozens of cameras
and lights at a news conference at Oak Knoll Naval
Hospital here, where he has been readjusting to
freedom since his return to the United States two
weeks ago.
"I, as most other men there, believe the effect of
the antiwar activity did prolong our stay," Alvarez
said. "To what extent I cannot say. It encouraged
the Vietnamese and gave them perhaps hope
something would develop out of it."
Alvarez said he and other POWs were aware of
U.S. antiwar activities and trips to North Vietnam
by antiwar activists Jane Fonda and former U.S.
Atty. Gen. Ramsey Clark: "We heard they were in
town. We didn't care for it at all."
Admiral Continues Testimony
LOS ANGELES — A retired Navy admiral
steadfastly denied yesterday that attorneys for
Daniel Ellsberg and Anthony Russo ever coached
him for testimony and said he made up his own
mind that the Pentagon Papers were useless to an
enemy.
Retired Rear Adm. Gene Laßocque, testifying
under crossexamination by Asst. U.S. Atty. David
Nissen, said defence team consultants asked him to
examine some volumes of the Pentagon study, but
said "they did not attempt to persuade me in either
direction."
The silver-haired Laßocque, called as the first
defense witness, noted that he had refused to testify
at the trial unless he was subpoenaed by the court,
which he was.
"I would not appear merely at the invitation of
the defendant. .said Laßocque.
Laßocque, currently director of the privately
funded Center for Defense Information in
Washington, D.C., denied Nissen's implication that
the center specializes in criticizing government
policies.
"You are wrong, sir," he witness told Nissen,
explaining that "It is a neutral information center"
which tries to "explain national defense policies and
make them understandable to the general public."
Nissen sought to challenge the credibility of
Laßocque's opinion on the Pentagon Papers
volumes by implying those opinions were formed in
contact with the defense team.
But Laßocque said that wasn't true. He said that
two defense consultants, Morton Halperin and
former U.S. Sen. Charles Goodell, sent volumes to
him by mail, then phoned to find out his opinion.
FBI Denied Mitehell Interview
WASHINGTON — The FBI wanted to interview
Martha Mitchell about the Watergate bugging case
but was denied permission by her husband, John,
the former attorney general and campaign chairman
of President Nixon, L. Patrick Gray 111 said
yesterday.
Asked by Sen. Birch Bayh (D-Ind.), if it was a
customary procedure in a criminal case for the FBI
to permit a husband to refuse permission for his
wife to be interviewed, Gray replied:
"The people in the FBI have an innate sense of
decency, of courtesy. This, man was a former
Attorney General. You can't classify it as a normal
procedure. It was a matter of decency, dignity and
courtesy."
Gray also told senators examining his credentials
to be permanent FBI director that Robert Mardian,
a top aide in the Nixon reelection committee,
refused to be interviewed by the FBI about alleged
destruction of documents at the republican
headquarters.
The 56-year-old Gray repeated again that H.R.
Haldeman, White House chief of staff, was not
interviewed by the FBI in connection with the
Watergate probe because there was no evidence that
he had anything to do with it.

"We saw some weapons, but they are not very
much in evidence," McGovern said.
He said the Indians wanted a full-scale Senate
hearing today at nearby Wounded Creek to discuss
their grievances.
"I said it was inappropriate," McGovern said. "I
told them we could not get all the members of the
Indian Affairs Committee here and besides we
wanted all Indians to be able to testify."
The two senators said they did not speak about
amnesty for the Indians.
"It is not in our province to deal with law
enforcement," McGovern said. "We came here to
try and avoid a hostile confrontation."
The Indians have said they want an immediate
Senate investigation of the Bureau of Indian Affairs
and Department of Interior "for their handling of
the Oglala Sioux Nation." They also asked for a
probe of what they said were violations of 371
Indian treaties.
Nixon Defends Cutbacks
WASHINGTON — President Nixon officially gave
up his long-troubled welfare reform plan yesterday
and defended cutbacks in other social programs.
Nixon also offered one of his most caustic
appraisals to date of the Great Society initiatives of
his predecessor, Lyndon B. Johnson.
"Well-intentioned as this effort may have been,"
declared the President, "the results in case after case
amounted to dismal failure."
Nixon said his rollbacks in the human resources
area had provoked "intense controversy and
considerable misunderstanding." But his proposed
expenditures of $125 billion represented "both a
generous budget and a reform budget,"he said.
Moreover, he noted, the total is "nearly twice the
amount that was being spent on such programs
when I took office in 1969."
The President said "the welfare mess cannot be
permitted to continue" and acknowledged he was
abandoning broad welfare reform "since the
legislative outlook seems to preclude passage ... in
the immediate future."
Nixon had wanted to replace categorical welfare
aid with the family assistance plan. It would have
guaranteed a minimum annual income to poor
families, while bolstering work requirements.
The President said he would follow through,
however, with vigorous steps to strengthen the
management of payments to families with
dependent children through both administrative and
unspecified legislative proposals. The system now,
he said, is "inequitable, inefficient and inadequate."
His remarks came in a 17-page document sent to
the Congress as one of a series of State of the Union
reports.
The President said that even as he is "irrevocably
committed ... to fulfilling the American dream for
all Americans," the best place to begin is "by
recognizing that by almost any measure, life is
better in 1973 than ever before in our history."

Dollar Tailspins
BONN — The dollar went into a tailspin yesterday
on European money markets left unconvinced by
President Nixon's 10 percent devaluation 17 days
ago.
The situation grew so acute that leading
European money markets, as well as Tokyo's,
decided to close today to bar all trading.
There was talk of joint action by the Common
Market countries. The British and German leaders,
Edward Heath and Willy Brandt, met. Germany's
central bank council held an 11-hour meeting.
Yesterday the European governments latched
onto a record $3'/2 billion to little avail.
West Germany's central bank bought up an
unprecedented $2.65 billion as part of the effort to
keep the dollar from falling and to keep its own
mark from rising in value.
All major European currencies, however, rose in
value against the dollar, including the British pound,
one of the weakest. The pound went above $2.50
for the first time since June.
This means Americans will have to pay even
more for European vacations and goods if the attack
on the dollar persists.
Nixon ordered the 10 percent devaluation last
month in what his administration described as a
move to make American goods less expensive to
foreigners. But to Americans it meant the price of
foreign goods went up.
The devaluation came after a rush from dollars
into West German marks and Japanese yen, regarded
as the world's strongest currencies.
Brandt called the emergency meeting of experts
soon after the arrival of Heath for two days of talks
centering on the money crisis.
Widespread belief that the two leaders would
agree on a joint float of Common Market currencies
against the dollar apparently triggered the wave of
selling.
Irish Ruling Party Loses
DUBLIN — Prime Minister Jack Lynch's ruling
party sank toward what he admitted looked like
defeat in Irish parliamentary elections, with returns
early today giving new seats to the opposition
coalition.
"It looks as though the coalition will form the
next government," Lynch said.
Counting of the votes for the 144 seats in the
lower house was adjourned early today, with 10
races still undecided. Lynch's party had won 64
seats to 68 for the coalition headed by Liam
Cosgrove. Independents held two.
Lynch admitted that his party could not hope to
win more than six of the remaining 10 seats, and
thus acknowledged he would not have a legislative
majority.
He said he will seek urgent talks with Cosgrove
on what he regards as the most pressing issue facing
Ireland — the expected British plan for Northern
Ireland, where Catholic gunmen are waging a
guerrilla war for union with this republic.
Lynch's party, the Fianne Fail, or Soldiers of
Destiny, had a slight lead over Cosgrove's coalition
in earlier returns from yesterday's election. Both
Lynch, 55, and Cosgrove, 52, held their seats in the
Dail.
The coalition consists of Cosgrove's Fine Gael —
Irish party and the union-backed Laborites. Fianna
Gael and Fianna Fail are the political heirs of the
rival sides in the Irish civil war of 1922-23.
Ex-POW Criticizes Protests
OAKLAND — Navy Lt. Cmdr. Everett Alvarez Jr.
said yesterday he thinks American antiwar protests
prolonged the Vietnam war and his imprisonment.
Although he spent BV2 years in a North
Vietnamese prison — nearly a quarter of his life and
the longest time for any American pilot — Alvarez
said the warm welcome in the United States
convinces him "It was all worth it."
Alvarez, 35, talked softly and appeared

somewhat nervous as he faced dozens of cameras
and lights at a news conference at Oak Knoll Naval
Hospital here, where he has been readjusting to
freedom since his return to the United States two
weeks ago.
"I, as most other men there, believe the effect of
the antiwar activity did prolong our stay," Alvarez
said. "To what extent I cannot say. It encouraged
the Vietnamese and gave them perhaps hope
something would develop out of it."
Alvarez said he and other POWs were aware of
U.S. antiwar activities and trips to North Vietnam
by antiwar activists Jane Fonda and former U.S.
Atty. Gen. Ramsey Clark: "We heard they were in
town. We didn't care for it at all."
Admiral Continues Testimony
LOS ANGELES — A retired Navy admiral
steadfastly denied yesterday that attorneys for
Daniel Ellsberg and Anthony Russo ever coached
him for testimony and said he made up his own
mind that the Pentagon Papers were useless to an
enemy.
Retired Rear Adm. Gene Laßocque, testifying
under crossexamination by Asst. U.S. Atty. David
Nissen, said defence team consultants asked him to
examine some volumes of the Pentagon study, but
said "they did not attempt to persuade me in either
direction."
The silver-haired Laßocque, called as the first
defense witness, noted that he had refused to testify
at the trial unless he was subpoenaed by the court,
which he was.
"I would not appear merely at the invitation of
the defendant. .said Laßocque.
Laßocque, currently director of the privately
funded Center for Defense Information in
Washington, D.C., denied Nissen's implication that
the center specializes in criticizing government
policies.
"You are wrong, sir," he witness told Nissen,
explaining that "It is a neutral information center"
which tries to "explain national defense policies and
make them understandable to the general public."
Nissen sought to challenge the credibility of
Laßocque's opinion on the Pentagon Papers
volumes by implying those opinions were formed in
contact with the defense team.
But Laßocque said that wasn't true. He said that
two defense consultants, Morton Halperin and
former U.S. Sen. Charles Goodell, sent volumes to
him by mail, then phoned to find out his opinion.
FBI Denied Mitehell Interview
WASHINGTON — The FBI wanted to interview
Martha Mitchell about the Watergate bugging case
but was denied permission by her husband, John,
the former attorney general and campaign chairman
of President Nixon, L. Patrick Gray 111 said
yesterday.
Asked by Sen. Birch Bayh (D-Ind.), if it was a
customary procedure in a criminal case for the FBI
to permit a husband to refuse permission for his
wife to be interviewed, Gray replied:
"The people in the FBI have an innate sense of
decency, of courtesy. This, man was a former
Attorney General. You can't classify it as a normal
procedure. It was a matter of decency, dignity and
courtesy."
Gray also told senators examining his credentials
to be permanent FBI director that Robert Mardian,
a top aide in the Nixon reelection committee,
refused to be interviewed by the FBI about alleged
destruction of documents at the republican
headquarters.
The 56-year-old Gray repeated again that H.R.
Haldeman, White House chief of staff, was not
interviewed by the FBI in connection with the
Watergate probe because there was no evidence that
he had anything to do with it.

Indians Free Hostages
WOUNDED KNEE, S.D. - The 11 persons held
hostage for two days by members of the American
Indian Movement were freed last night after the
militant Indians negotiated for more than two hours
with South Dakota's two U.S. Senators.
The freed hostages said they would stay in
Wounded Knee because it is their home, Sens.
George McGovern and James Abourezk told a news
conference.
McGovern and Abourezk said they would
continue to negotiate with AIM leaders, who had
asked to talk to the senators about Indian civil
rights and treaties.
"They are going to construct a tepee in a field
where the negotiations will be continued tonight,"
said McGovern.
McGovern and Abourezk said the hostages had
been released but were escorted about the village by
Indians and some of the houses were occupied by-
Indians.
"We saw some weapons, but they are not very
much in evidence," McGovern said.
He said the Indians wanted a full-scale Senate

WASHINGTON — President Nixon officially gave
up his long-troubled welfare reform plan yesterday
and defended cutbacks in other social programs.
Nixon also offered one of his most caustic
appraisals to date of the Great Society initiatives of
his predecessor, Lyndon B. Johnson.
"Well-intentioned as this effort may have been,"
declared the President, "the results in case after case
amounted to dismal failure."
Nixon said his rollbacks in the human resources
area had provoked "intense controversy and
considerable misunderstanding." But his proposed
expenditures of $125 billion represented "both a
generous budget and a reform budget,"he said.
Moreover, he noted, the total is "nearly twice the
amount that was being spent on such programs
when I took office in 1969."
The President said "the welfare mess cannot be
permitted to continue" and acknowledged he was
abandoning broad welfare reform "since the
legislative outlook seems to preclude passage ... in
the immediate future."
Nixon had wanted to replace categorical welfare
aid with the family assistance plan. It would have
guaranteed a minimum annual income to poor
families, while bolstering work requirements.
The President said he would follow through,
however, with vigorous steps to strengthen the
management of payments to families with
dependent children through both administrative and
unspecified legislative proposals. The system now,
he said, is "inequitable, inefficient and inadequate."
His remarks came in a 17-page document sent to
the Congress as one of a series of State of the Union
reports.
The President said that even as he is "irrevocably
committed ... to fulfilling the American dream for
all Americans," the best place to begin is "by
recognizing that by almost any measure, life is
better in 1973 than ever before in our history."

Dollar Tailspins
BONN — The dollar went into a tailspin yesterday
on European money markets left unconvinced by
President Nixon's 10 percent devaluation 17 days
ago.
The situation grew so acute that leading
European money markets, as well as Tokyo's,
decided to close today to bar all trading.
There was talk of joint action by the Common
Market countries. The British and German leaders,
Edward Heath and Willy Brandt, met. Germany's
central bank council held an 11-hour meeting.
Yesterday the European governments latched
onto a record $3'/2 billion to little avail.
West Germany's central bank bought up an
unprecedented $2.65 billion as part of the effort to
keep the dollar from falling and to keep its own
mark from rising in value.
All major European currencies, however, rose in
value against the dollar, including the British pound,
one of the weakest. The pound went above $2.50
for the first time since June.
This means Americans will have to pay even
more for European vacations and goods if the attack
on the dollar persists.
Nixon ordered the 10 percent devaluation last
month in what his administration described as a
move to make American goods less expensive to
foreigners. But to Americans it meant the price of
foreign goods went up.
The devaluation came after a rush from dollars
into West German marks and Japanese yen, regarded
as the world's strongest currencies.
Brandt called the emergency meeting of experts
soon after the arrival of Heath for two days of talks
centering on the money crisis.
Widespread belief that the two leaders would
agree on a joint float of Common Market currencies
against the dollar apparently triggered the wave of
selling.
Irish Ruling Party Loses
DUBLIN — Prime Minister Jack Lynch's ruling
party sank toward what he admitted looked like
defeat in Irish parliamentary elections, with returns
early today giving new seats to the opposition
coalition.
"It looks as though the coalition will form the
next government," Lynch said.
Counting of the votes for the 144 seats in the
lower house was adjourned early today, with 10
races still undecided. Lynch's party had won 64
seats to 68 for the coalition headed by Liam
Cosgrove. Independents held two.
Lynch admitted that his party could not hope to
win more than six of the remaining 10 seats, and
thus acknowledged he would not have a legislative
majority.
He said he will seek urgent talks with Cosgrove
on what he regards as the most pressing issue facing
Ireland — the expected British plan for Northern
Ireland, where Catholic gunmen are waging a
guerrilla war for union with this republic.
Lynch's party, the Fianne Fail, or Soldiers of
Destiny, had a slight lead over Cosgrove's coalition
in earlier returns from yesterday's election. Both
Lynch, 55, and Cosgrove, 52, held their seats in the
Dail.
The coalition consists of Cosgrove's Fine Gael —
Irish party and the union-backed Laborites. Fianna
Gael and Fianna Fail are the political heirs of the
rival sides in the Irish civil war of 1922-23.
Ex-POW Criticizes Protests
OAKLAND — Navy Lt. Cmdr. Everett Alvarez Jr.
said yesterday he thinks American antiwar protests
prolonged the Vietnam war and his imprisonment.
Although he spent BV2 years in a North
Vietnamese prison — nearly a quarter of his life and
the longest time for any American pilot — Alvarez
said the warm welcome in the United States
convinces him "It was all worth it."
Alvarez, 35, talked softly and appeared

somewhat nervous as he faced dozens of cameras
and lights at a news conference at Oak Knoll Naval
Hospital here, where he has been readjusting to
freedom since his return to the United States two
weeks ago.
"I, as most other men there, believe the effect of
the antiwar activity did prolong our stay," Alvarez
said. "To what extent I cannot say. It encouraged
the Vietnamese and gave them perhaps hope
something would develop out of it."
Alvarez said he and other POWs were aware of
U.S. antiwar activities and trips to North Vietnam
by antiwar activists Jane Fonda and former U.S.
Atty. Gen. Ramsey Clark: "We heard they were in
town. We didn't care for it at all."
Admiral Continues Testimony
LOS ANGELES — A retired Navy admiral
steadfastly denied yesterday that attorneys for
Daniel Ellsberg and Anthony Russo ever coached
him for testimony and said he made up his own
mind that the Pentagon Papers were useless to an
enemy.
Retired Rear Adm. Gene Laßocque, testifying
under crossexamination by Asst. U.S. Atty. David
Nissen, said defence team consultants asked him to
examine some volumes of the Pentagon study, but
said "they did not attempt to persuade me in either
direction."
The silver-haired Laßocque, called as the first
defense witness, noted that he had refused to testify
at the trial unless he was subpoenaed by the court,
which he was.
"I would not appear merely at the invitation of
the defendant. .said Laßocque.
Laßocque, currently director of the privately
funded Center for Defense Information in
Washington, D.C., denied Nissen's implication that
the center specializes in criticizing government
policies.
"You are wrong, sir," he witness told Nissen,
explaining that "It is a neutral information center"
which tries to "explain national defense policies and
make them understandable to the general public."
Nissen sought to challenge the credibility of
Laßocque's opinion on the Pentagon Papers
volumes by implying those opinions were formed in
contact with the defense team.
But Laßocque said that wasn't true. He said that
two defense consultants, Morton Halperin and
former U.S. Sen. Charles Goodell, sent volumes to
him by mail, then phoned to find out his opinion.
FBI Denied Mitehell Interview
WASHINGTON — The FBI wanted to interview
Martha Mitchell about the Watergate bugging case
but was denied permission by her husband, John,
the former attorney general and campaign chairman
of President Nixon, L. Patrick Gray 111 said
yesterday.
Asked by Sen. Birch Bayh (D-Ind.), if it was a
customary procedure in a criminal case for the FBI
to permit a husband to refuse permission for his
wife to be interviewed, Gray replied:
"The people in the FBI have an innate sense of
decency, of courtesy. This, man was a former
Attorney General. You can't classify it as a normal
procedure. It was a matter of decency, dignity and
courtesy."
Gray also told senators examining his credentials
to be permanent FBI director that Robert Mardian,
a top aide in the Nixon reelection committee,
refused to be interviewed by the FBI about alleged
destruction of documents at the republican
headquarters.
The 56-year-old Gray repeated again that H.R.
Haldeman, White House chief of staff, was not
interviewed by the FBI in connection with the
Watergate probe because there was no evidence that
he had anything to do with it.
Today's Weather

Indians Free Hostages
WOUNDED KNEE, S.D. - The 11 persons held
hostage for two days by members of the American
Indian Movement were freed last night after the
militant Indians negotiated for more than two hours
with South Dakota's two U.S. Senators.
The freed hostages said they would stay in
Wounded Knee because it is their home, Sens.
George McGovern and James Abourezk told a news
conference.
McGovern and Abourezk said they would
continue to negotiate with AIM leaders, who had
asked to talk to the senators about Indian civil
rights and treaties.
"They are going to construct a tepee in a field
where the negotiations will be continued tonight,"
said McGovern.
McGovern and Abourezk said the hostages had
been released but were escorted about the village by
Indians and some of the houses were occupied by-
Indians.
"We saw some weapons, but they are not very
much in evidence," McGovern said.
He said the Indians wanted a full-scale Senate
hearing today at nearby Wounded Creek to discuss
their grievances.
"I said it was inappropriate," McGovern said. "I
told them we could not get all the members of the
Indian Affairs Committee here and besides we
wanted all Indians to be able to testify."
The two senators said they did not speak about
amnesty for the Indians.
"It is not in our province to deal with law
enforcement," McGovern said. "We came here to
try and avoid a hostile confrontation."
The Indians have said they want an immediate
Senate investigation of the Bureau of Indian Affairs
and Department of Interior "for their handling of
the Oglala Sioux Nation." They also asked for a
probe of what they said were violations of 371
Indian treaties.

the immediate future."
Nixon had wanted to replace categorical welfare
aid with the family assistance plan. It would have
guaranteed a minimum annual income to poor
families, while bolstering work requirements.
The President said he would follow through,
however, with vigorous steps to strengthen the
management of payments to families with
dependent children through both administrative and
unspecified legislative proposals. The system now,
he said, is "inequitable, inefficient and inadequate."
His remarks came in a 17-page document sent to
the Congress as one of a series of State of the Union
reports.
The President said that even as he is "irrevocably
committed ... to fulfilling the American dream for
all Americans," the best place to begin is "by
recognizing that by almost any measure, life is
better in 1973 than ever before in our history."

Dollar Tailspins
BONN — The dollar went into a tailspin yesterday
on European money markets left unconvinced by
President Nixon's 10 percent devaluation 17 days
ago.
The situation grew so acute that leading
European money markets, as well as Tokyo's,
decided to close today to bar all trading.
There was talk of joint action by the Common
Market countries. The British and German leaders,
Edward Heath and Willy Brandt, met. Germany's
central bank council held an 11-hour meeting.
Yesterday the European governments latched
onto a record $3'/2 billion to little avail.
West Germany's central bank bought up an
unprecedented $2.65 billion as part of the effort to
keep the dollar from falling and to keep its own
mark from rising in value.
All major European currencies, however, rose in
value against the dollar, including the British pound,
one of the weakest. The pound went above $2.50
for the first time since June.
This means Americans will have to pay even
more for European vacations and goods if the attack
on the dollar persists.
Nixon ordered the 10 percent devaluation last
month in what his administration described as a
move to make American goods less expensive to
foreigners. But to Americans it meant the price of
foreign goods went up.
The devaluation came after a rush from dollars
into West German marks and Japanese yen, regarded
as the world's strongest currencies.
Brandt called the emergency meeting of experts
soon after the arrival of Heath for two days of talks
centering on the money crisis.
Widespread belief that the two leaders would
agree on a joint float of Common Market currencies
against the dollar apparently triggered the wave of
selling.
Irish Ruling Party Loses
DUBLIN — Prime Minister Jack Lynch's ruling
party sank toward what he admitted looked like
defeat in Irish parliamentary elections, with returns
early today giving new seats to the opposition
coalition.
"It looks as though the coalition will form the
next government," Lynch said.
Counting of the votes for the 144 seats in the
lower house was adjourned early today, with 10
races still undecided. Lynch's party had won 64
seats to 68 for the coalition headed by Liam
Cosgrove. Independents held two.
Lynch admitted that his party could not hope to
win more than six of the remaining 10 seats, and
thus acknowledged he would not have a legislative
majority.
He said he will seek urgent talks with Cosgrove
on what he regards as the most pressing issue facing
Ireland — the expected British plan for Northern
Ireland, where Catholic gunmen are waging a
guerrilla war for union with this republic.
Lynch's party, the Fianne Fail, or Soldiers of
Destiny, had a slight lead over Cosgrove's coalition
in earlier returns from yesterday's election. Both
Lynch, 55, and Cosgrove, 52, held their seats in the
Dail.
The coalition consists of Cosgrove's Fine Gael —
Irish party and the union-backed Laborites. Fianna
Gael and Fianna Fail are the political heirs of the
rival sides in the Irish civil war of 1922-23.
Ex-POW Criticizes Protests
OAKLAND — Navy Lt. Cmdr. Everett Alvarez Jr.
said yesterday he thinks American antiwar protests
prolonged the Vietnam war and his imprisonment.
Although he spent BV2 years in a North
Vietnamese prison — nearly a quarter of his life and
the longest time for any American pilot — Alvarez
said the warm welcome in the United States
convinces him "It was all worth it."
Alvarez, 35, talked softly and appeared

somewhat nervous as he faced dozens of cameras
and lights at a news conference at Oak Knoll Naval
Hospital here, where he has been readjusting to
freedom since his return to the United States two
weeks ago.
"I, as most other men there, believe the effect of
the antiwar activity did prolong our stay," Alvarez
said. "To what extent I cannot say. It encouraged
the Vietnamese and gave them perhaps hope
something would develop out of it."
Alvarez said he and other POWs were aware of
U.S. antiwar activities and trips to North Vietnam
by antiwar activists Jane Fonda and former U.S.
Atty. Gen. Ramsey Clark: "We heard they were in
town. We didn't care for it at all."
Admiral Continues Testimony
LOS ANGELES — A retired Navy admiral
steadfastly denied yesterday that attorneys for
Daniel Ellsberg and Anthony Russo ever coached
him for testimony and said he made up his own
mind that the Pentagon Papers were useless to an
enemy.
Retired Rear Adm. Gene Laßocque, testifying
under crossexamination by Asst. U.S. Atty. David
Nissen, said defence team consultants asked him to
examine some volumes of the Pentagon study, but
said "they did not attempt to persuade me in either
direction."
The silver-haired Laßocque, called as the first
defense witness, noted that he had refused to testify
at the trial unless he was subpoenaed by the court,
which he was.
"I would not appear merely at the invitation of
the defendant. .said Laßocque.
Laßocque, currently director of the privately
funded Center for Defense Information in
Washington, D.C., denied Nissen's implication that
the center specializes in criticizing government
policies.
"You are wrong, sir," he witness told Nissen,
explaining that "It is a neutral information center"
which tries to "explain national defense policies and
make them understandable to the general public."
Nissen sought to challenge the credibility of
Laßocque's opinion on the Pentagon Papers
volumes by implying those opinions were formed in
contact with the defense team.
But Laßocque said that wasn't true. He said that
two defense consultants, Morton Halperin and
former U.S. Sen. Charles Goodell, sent volumes to
him by mail, then phoned to find out his opinion.
FBI Denied Mitehell Interview
WASHINGTON — The FBI wanted to interview
Martha Mitchell about the Watergate bugging case
but was denied permission by her husband, John,
the former attorney general and campaign chairman
of President Nixon, L. Patrick Gray 111 said
yesterday.
Asked by Sen. Birch Bayh (D-Ind.), if it was a
customary procedure in a criminal case for the FBI
to permit a husband to refuse permission for his
wife to be interviewed, Gray replied:
"The people in the FBI have an innate sense of
decency, of courtesy. This, man was a former
Attorney General. You can't classify it as a normal
procedure. It was a matter of decency, dignity and
courtesy."
Gray also told senators examining his credentials
to be permanent FBI director that Robert Mardian,
a top aide in the Nixon reelection committee,
refused to be interviewed by the FBI about alleged
destruction of documents at the republican
headquarters.
The 56-year-old Gray repeated again that H.R.
Haldeman, White House chief of staff, was not
interviewed by the FBI in connection with the
Watergate probe because there was no evidence that
he had anything to do with it.
Today's Weather
Partly cloudy through today. High today in the
upper 50s to mid 60s.
Indians Free Hostages
WOUNDED KNEE, S.D. - The 11 persons held
hostage for two days by members of the American
Indian Movement were freed last night after the
militant Indians negotiated for more than two hours
with South Dakota's two U.S. Senators.
The freed hostages said they would stay in
Wounded Knee because it is their home, Sens.
George McGovern and James Abourezk told a news
conference.
McGovern and Abourezk said they would
continue to negotiate with AIM leaders, who had
asked to talk to the senators about Indian civil
rights and treaties.
"They are going to construct a tepee in a field
where the negotiations will be continued tonight,"
said McGovern.
McGovern and Abourezk said the hostages had
been released but were escorted about the village by
Indians and some of the houses were occupied by-
Indians.
"We saw some weapons, but they are not very
much in evidence," McGovern said.
He said the Indians wanted a full-scale Senate
hearing today at nearby Wounded Creek to discuss
their grievances.
"I said it was inappropriate," McGovern said. "I
told them we could not get all the members of the
Indian Affairs Committee here and besides we
wanted all Indians to be able to testify."
The two senators said they did not speak about
amnesty for the Indians.
"It is not in our province to deal with law
enforcement," McGovern said. "We came here to
try and avoid a hostile confrontation."
The Indians have said they want an immediate
Senate investigation of the Bureau of Indian Affairs
and Department of Interior "for their handling of
the Oglala Sioux Nation." They also asked for a
probe of what they said were violations of 371
Indian treaties.
Nixon Defends Cutbacks
WASHINGTON — President Nixon officially gave
up his long-troubled welfare reform plan yesterday
and defended cutbacks in other social programs.
Nixon also offered one of his most caustic
appraisals to date of the Great Society initiatives of
his predecessor, Lyndon B. Johnson.
"Well-intentioned as this effort may have been,"
declared the President, "the results in case after case
amounted to dismal failure."
Nixon said his rollbacks in the human resources
area had provoked "intense controversy and
considerable misunderstanding." But his proposed
expenditures of $125 billion represented "both a
generous budget and a reform budget,"he said.
Moreover, he noted, the total is "nearly twice the
amount that was being spent on such programs
when I took office in 1969."
The President said "the welfare mess cannot be
permitted to continue" and acknowledged he was
abandoning broad welfare reform "since the
legislative outlook seems to preclude passage ... in
the immediate future."
Nixon had wanted to replace categorical welfare
aid with the family assistance plan. It would have
guaranteed a minimum annual income to poor

BONN — The dollar went into a tailspin yesterday
on European money markets left unconvinced by
President Nixon's 10 percent devaluation 17 days
ago.
The situation grew so acute that leading
European money markets, as well as Tokyo's,
decided to close today to bar all trading.
There was talk of joint action by the Common
Market countries. The British and German leaders,
Edward Heath and Willy Brandt, met. Germany's
central bank council held an 11-hour meeting.
Yesterday the European governments latched
onto a record $3'/2 billion to little avail.
West Germany's central bank bought up an
unprecedented $2.65 billion as part of the effort to
keep the dollar from falling and to keep its own
mark from rising in value.
All major European currencies, however, rose in
value against the dollar, including the British pound,
one of the weakest. The pound went above $2.50
for the first time since June.
This means Americans will have to pay even
more for European vacations and goods if the attack
on the dollar persists.
Nixon ordered the 10 percent devaluation last
month in what his administration described as a
move to make American goods less expensive to
foreigners. But to Americans it meant the price of
foreign goods went up.
The devaluation came after a rush from dollars
into West German marks and Japanese yen, regarded
as the world's strongest currencies.
Brandt called the emergency meeting of experts
soon after the arrival of Heath for two days of talks
centering on the money crisis.
Widespread belief that the two leaders would
agree on a joint float of Common Market currencies
against the dollar apparently triggered the wave of
selling.
Irish Ruling Party Loses
DUBLIN — Prime Minister Jack Lynch's ruling
party sank toward what he admitted looked like
defeat in Irish parliamentary elections, with returns
early today giving new seats to the opposition
coalition.
"It looks as though the coalition will form the
next government," Lynch said.
Counting of the votes for the 144 seats in the
lower house was adjourned early today, with 10
races still undecided. Lynch's party had won 64
seats to 68 for the coalition headed by Liam
Cosgrove. Independents held two.
Lynch admitted that his party could not hope to
win more than six of the remaining 10 seats, and
thus acknowledged he would not have a legislative
majority.
He said he will seek urgent talks with Cosgrove
on what he regards as the most pressing issue facing
Ireland — the expected British plan for Northern
Ireland, where Catholic gunmen are waging a
guerrilla war for union with this republic.
Lynch's party, the Fianne Fail, or Soldiers of
Destiny, had a slight lead over Cosgrove's coalition
in earlier returns from yesterday's election. Both
Lynch, 55, and Cosgrove, 52, held their seats in the
Dail.
The coalition consists of Cosgrove's Fine Gael —
Irish party and the union-backed Laborites. Fianna
Gael and Fianna Fail are the political heirs of the
rival sides in the Irish civil war of 1922-23.
Ex-POW Criticizes Protests
OAKLAND — Navy Lt. Cmdr. Everett Alvarez Jr.
said yesterday he thinks American antiwar protests
prolonged the Vietnam war and his imprisonment.
Although he spent BV2 years in a North
Vietnamese prison — nearly a quarter of his life and
the longest time for any American pilot — Alvarez
said the warm welcome in the United States
convinces him "It was all worth it."
Alvarez, 35, talked softly and appeared

somewhat nervous as he faced dozens of cameras
and lights at a news conference at Oak Knoll Naval
Hospital here, where he has been readjusting to
freedom since his return to the United States two
weeks ago.
"I, as most other men there, believe the effect of
the antiwar activity did prolong our stay," Alvarez
said. "To what extent I cannot say. It encouraged
the Vietnamese and gave them perhaps hope
something would develop out of it."
Alvarez said he and other POWs were aware of
U.S. antiwar activities and trips to North Vietnam
by antiwar activists Jane Fonda and former U.S.
Atty. Gen. Ramsey Clark: "We heard they were in
town. We didn't care for it at all."
Admiral Continues Testimony
LOS ANGELES — A retired Navy admiral
steadfastly denied yesterday that attorneys for
Daniel Ellsberg and Anthony Russo ever coached
him for testimony and said he made up his own
mind that the Pentagon Papers were useless to an
enemy.
Retired Rear Adm. Gene Laßocque, testifying
under crossexamination by Asst. U.S. Atty. David
Nissen, said defence team consultants asked him to
examine some volumes of the Pentagon study, but
said "they did not attempt to persuade me in either
direction."
The silver-haired Laßocque, called as the first
defense witness, noted that he had refused to testify
at the trial unless he was subpoenaed by the court,
which he was.
"I would not appear merely at the invitation of
the defendant. .said Laßocque.
Laßocque, currently director of the privately
funded Center for Defense Information in
Washington, D.C., denied Nissen's implication that
the center specializes in criticizing government
policies.
"You are wrong, sir," he witness told Nissen,
explaining that "It is a neutral information center"
which tries to "explain national defense policies and
make them understandable to the general public."
Nissen sought to challenge the credibility of
Laßocque's opinion on the Pentagon Papers
volumes by implying those opinions were formed in
contact with the defense team.
But Laßocque said that wasn't true. He said that
two defense consultants, Morton Halperin and
former U.S. Sen. Charles Goodell, sent volumes to
him by mail, then phoned to find out his opinion.
FBI Denied Mitehell Interview
WASHINGTON — The FBI wanted to interview
Martha Mitchell about the Watergate bugging case
but was denied permission by her husband, John,
the former attorney general and campaign chairman
of President Nixon, L. Patrick Gray 111 said
yesterday.
Asked by Sen. Birch Bayh (D-Ind.), if it was a
customary procedure in a criminal case for the FBI
to permit a husband to refuse permission for his
wife to be interviewed, Gray replied:
"The people in the FBI have an innate sense of
decency, of courtesy. This, man was a former
Attorney General. You can't classify it as a normal
procedure. It was a matter of decency, dignity and
courtesy."
Gray also told senators examining his credentials
to be permanent FBI director that Robert Mardian,
a top aide in the Nixon reelection committee,
refused to be interviewed by the FBI about alleged
destruction of documents at the republican
headquarters.
The 56-year-old Gray repeated again that H.R.
Haldeman, White House chief of staff, was not
interviewed by the FBI in connection with the
Watergate probe because there was no evidence that
he had anything to do with it.
Today's Weather
Partly cloudy through today. High today in the
upper 50s to mid 60s.
Indians Free Hostages
WOUNDED KNEE, S.D. - The 11 persons held
hostage for two days by members of the American
Indian Movement were freed last night after the
militant Indians negotiated for more than two hours
with South Dakota's two U.S. Senators.
The freed hostages said they would stay in
Wounded Knee because it is their home, Sens.
George McGovern and James Abourezk told a news
conference.
McGovern and Abourezk said they would
continue to negotiate with AIM leaders, who had
asked to talk to the senators about Indian civil
rights and treaties.
"They are going to construct a tepee in a field
where the negotiations will be continued tonight,"
said McGovern.
McGovern and Abourezk said the hostages had
been released but were escorted about the village by
Indians and some of the houses were occupied by-
Indians.
"We saw some weapons, but they are not very
much in evidence," McGovern said.
He said the Indians wanted a full-scale Senate
hearing today at nearby Wounded Creek to discuss
their grievances.
"I said it was inappropriate," McGovern said. "I
told them we could not get all the members of the
Indian Affairs Committee here and besides we
wanted all Indians to be able to testify."
The two senators said they did not speak about
amnesty for the Indians.
"It is not in our province to deal with law
enforcement," McGovern said. "We came here to
try and avoid a hostile confrontation."
The Indians have said they want an immediate
Senate investigation of the Bureau of Indian Affairs
and Department of Interior "for their handling of
the Oglala Sioux Nation." They also asked for a
probe of what they said were violations of 371
Indian treaties.
Nixon Defends Cutbacks
WASHINGTON — President Nixon officially gave
up his long-troubled welfare reform plan yesterday
and defended cutbacks in other social programs.
Nixon also offered one of his most caustic
appraisals to date of the Great Society initiatives of
his predecessor, Lyndon B. Johnson.
"Well-intentioned as this effort may have been,"
declared the President, "the results in case after case
amounted to dismal failure."
Nixon said his rollbacks in the human resources
area had provoked "intense controversy and
considerable misunderstanding." But his proposed
expenditures of $125 billion represented "both a
generous budget and a reform budget,"he said.
Moreover, he noted, the total is "nearly twice the
amount that was being spent on such programs
when I took office in 1969."
The President said "the welfare mess cannot be
permitted to continue" and acknowledged he was
abandoning broad welfare reform "since the
legislative outlook seems to preclude passage ... in
the immediate future."
Nixon had wanted to replace categorical welfare
aid with the family assistance plan. It would have
guaranteed a minimum annual income to poor
families, while bolstering work requirements.
The President said he would follow through,
however, with vigorous steps to strengthen the
management of payments to families with
dependent children through both administrative and
unspecified legislative proposals. The system now,
he said, is "inequitable, inefficient and inadequate."
His remarks came in a 17-page document sent to
the Congress as one of a series of State of the Union
reports.
The President said that even as he is "irrevocably
committed ... to fulfilling the American dream for
all Americans," the best place to begin is "by
recognizing that by almost any measure, life is
better in 1973 than ever before in our history."
