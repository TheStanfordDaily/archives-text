# Suit Filed To Force Bach Mai Issue Vote
## 
### 
Proponents of the controversial
Palo Alto Bach Mai hospital initiative
yesterday asked the Santa Clara
County Superior Court to force an
election on the measure. A hearing in
the case was set for Wednesday.
The petitioners want the city to
donate $50,000 in public funds to
help rebuild the bombed Bach Mai
Hospital in Hanoi, North Vietnam.
Although they collected sufficient
signatures on initiative petitions, the
city council last Monday refused to
put the issue on the May 8 municipal
ballot.
Attorney Bob Charrow filed the
suit against the city council yesterday
morning in San Jose. A hearing was
scheduled for Wednesday, Mar. 7, at
8:45 a.m. Judge Homer B. Thompson,
presiding judge of the county Superior
Court, will hear the case in San Jose.
At that time, City Attorney Peter
Stone must show cause why the
measure should not be put on the
ballot.
Stone insists that a gift of tax funds
to Bach Mai would be "clearly and
patently illegal"; hence, he says, an
election on the question would be
meaningless and unnecessary. He had
recommended that the council not
submit the matter to the voters.
The petitioners argue that the city
charter requires the council to place
the measure before the voters.
The American Civil Liberties
Union, represented by Menlo Park
attorney Larry Sleizer, will file an
amicus curiae brief and take part in
Wednesday's arguments, urging that
the measure be put on the ballot.
Sleizer explained, "our position will
probably be that regardless of the

illegality of the measure — and it may
be illegal — the council had a duty to
put it on the ballot."
Both Stone and Stanford law
student Tom Burke, one of the
petitioners, exuded confidence
yesterday afternoon that their side
would prevail in the case.
The matter is being expedited by all
involved, since the ballots for the May
8 election must be prepared by March
16. Burke expressed cautious
optimism yesterday that the court
would rule in time to put the matter
on the ballot.
Stone said, "We're just as anxious
as anybody else to have the court
decide the matter and be over and
done with it."
