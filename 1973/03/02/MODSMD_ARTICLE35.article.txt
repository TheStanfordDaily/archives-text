# Youth Slashes Football Player

### 
A jack handle-wielding youth slashed Ron Kadziel, linebacker for the New
England Patriots and a member of Stanford's 1971 Rose Bowl-winning team,
yesterday at Maples Pavilion.
Santa Clara County Sheriff's deputies said Kadziel was playing in an informal
basketball game when one of the participants became angered at him. The
participant, identified only as a Gunn High School student, apparently retrieved
a jack handle from his car and slashed Kadziel across the chest with it.
A Stanford Hospital spokesman said that the wound took between 15 and 20
stitches to close. Kadziel was treated and released.
Deputies later arrested the alleged assailant and booked him at juvenile hall in
San Jose on a charge of assault with a deadly weapon, said Sheriffs Sgt. Jon
Svilich.
Kadziel was a fifth-round draft pick of the Dallas Cowboys in 1971.
