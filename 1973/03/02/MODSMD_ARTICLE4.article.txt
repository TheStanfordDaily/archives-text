# Guerrillas Seize U.S. Diplomat, Demand Sirhan Sirhan Release
## 
### 
BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) - Palestinian
guerrillas stormed a diplomatic
reception last night in Khartoum,
Sudan, seized the U.S. ambassador and
colleagues as hostages, then demanded
the release of Sirhan Sirhan in
California and other prisoners
elsewhere.
The British Foreign Office said its
ambassador reported that the Black
September guerrillas shot their way
into the reception, and the West
German government said a Belgian
diplomat was wounded.
An Associated Press dispatch from
Khartoum said the guerrillas
demanded the release within 24 hours
of Sirhan, the Jordanian immigrant to
the United States who was convicted

of assassinating Sen. Robert F.
Kennedy. They also sought freedom
for the leaders of an urban guerrilla
group in West Germany and Arab
prisoners held in several countries,
including all Palestinian women held
by Israel.
Plans Unknown
It was not known what the
guerrillas planned to do if their
demands were not met. The Sudan
government pledged it would do what
it could to safeguard the lives of the
hostages.
Sudan is an Arab country, south of
Egypt on the Nile.
The AP dispatch from Khartoum
said those held captive included U.S.
Ambassador Cleo A. Noel Jr., the

American charge d'affaires, the
Jordanian charge, the Belgian chargc
and the Saudi Arabian ambassador, his
wife and children.
During Tea Party
The dispatch said the raid was at
the Saudi Arabian Embassy during a
tea party for the U.S. charge d'affaires,
George Curtis Moore. He was due to
leave Khartoum March 5.
Witnesses heard six shots, the
dispatch said.
Britain's ambassador to the Sudan,
Raymond Etherington-Smith, reported
to the Foreign Ministry in London
that the terrorists, after shooting their
way in, held diplomats inside the
embassy, "which is completely
surrounded by Sudanese police."
It was not clear whether the
commandos' strike was in repirsal for
Israel's downing last week of an
airliner from Libya, a neighbor of
Sudan. The death toll in that tragedy
exceeded 100.
No Comment
In Washington, State Department
press officer Charles W. Bray refused
comment on the demand that Sirhan
be released.
Reminded of a long-standing U.S.
policy to reject blackmail attempts or
to pay ransom to terrorists, Bray
acknowledged: "That has been our
policy."
Bray said that some of the members
of the reception were released, but

there were no details.
"The party was attended by a
substantial but undetermined number
of diplomats residing in Khartoum,"
Bray said.
"At some point in the reception a
group of terrorists not otherwise
identified to us took control of the
premises for purposes not yet entirely
clear."
Neither the Sudanese radio nor
Washington had reliable information
on exactly how many persons were
seized, how many guerrillas there were
or how the raid was carried out.
However, the broadcast monitored
in Beirut said a Sudanese government
representative told the guerrillas that
the regime was concerned about the
safety of both hostages and guerrillas.
He urged the guerrillas not to kill the
diplomats.
The Sudanese president, Jaafar
Numeiry, was in telephone contact
with Saudi Arabia's King Feisal.
Black September takes its name
from the 1970 month when Jordan's
King Hussein crushed guerrillas who
were threatening him. The group killed
a Jordanian prime minister in 1971,
and last year killed 11 Israeli athletes
at the Olympics. They hijacked a
German plane to free three of their
Munich brothers who were in prison.
Their most recent exploit was a
19-hour seizure of the Israeli Embassy
in Bangkok.

However, the broadcast monitored
in Beirut said a Sudanese government
representative told the guerrillas that
the regime was concerned about the
safety of both hostages and guerrillas.
He urged the guerrillas not to kill the
diplomats.
The Sudanese president, Jaafar
Numeiry, was in telephone contact
with Saudi Arabia's King Feisal.
Black September takes its name
from the 1970 month when Jordan's
King Hussein crushed guerrillas who
were threatening him. The group killed
a Jordanian prime minister in 1971,
and last year killed 11 Israeli athletes
at the Olympics. They hijacked a
German plane to free three of their
Munich brothers who were in prison.
Their most recent exploit was a

BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) - Palestinian
guerrillas stormed a diplomatic
reception last night in Khartoum,
Sudan, seized the U.S. ambassador and
colleagues as hostages, then demanded
the release of Sirhan Sirhan in
California and other prisoners
elsewhere.
The British Foreign Office said its
ambassador reported that the Black
September guerrillas shot their way
into the reception, and the West
German government said a Belgian
diplomat was wounded.
An Associated Press dispatch from
Khartoum said the guerrillas
demanded the release within 24 hours
of Sirhan, the Jordanian immigrant to
the United States who was convicted

of assassinating Sen. Robert F.
Kennedy. They also sought freedom
for the leaders of an urban guerrilla
group in West Germany and Arab
prisoners held in several countries,
including all Palestinian women held
by Israel.
Plans Unknown
It was not known what the
guerrillas planned to do if their
demands were not met. The Sudan
government pledged it would do what
it could to safeguard the lives of the
hostages.
Sudan is an Arab country, south of
Egypt on the Nile.
The AP dispatch from Khartoum
said those held captive included U.S.
Ambassador Cleo A. Noel Jr., the

American charge d'affaires, the
Jordanian charge, the Belgian chargc
and the Saudi Arabian ambassador, his
wife and children.
During Tea Party
The dispatch said the raid was at
the Saudi Arabian Embassy during a
tea party for the U.S. charge d'affaires,
George Curtis Moore. He was due to
leave Khartoum March 5.
Witnesses heard six shots, the
dispatch said.
Britain's ambassador to the Sudan,
Raymond Etherington-Smith, reported
to the Foreign Ministry in London
that the terrorists, after shooting their
way in, held diplomats inside the
embassy, "which is completely
surrounded by Sudanese police."
It was not clear whether the
commandos' strike was in repirsal for
Israel's downing last week of an
airliner from Libya, a neighbor of
Sudan. The death toll in that tragedy
exceeded 100.
No Comment
In Washington, State Department
press officer Charles W. Bray refused
comment on the demand that Sirhan
be released.
Reminded of a long-standing U.S.
policy to reject blackmail attempts or
to pay ransom to terrorists, Bray
acknowledged: "That has been our
policy."
Bray said that some of the members
of the reception were released, but

there were no details.
"The party was attended by a
substantial but undetermined number
of diplomats residing in Khartoum,"
Bray said.
"At some point in the reception a
group of terrorists not otherwise
identified to us took control of the
premises for purposes not yet entirely
clear."
Neither the Sudanese radio nor
Washington had reliable information
on exactly how many persons were
seized, how many guerrillas there were
or how the raid was carried out.
