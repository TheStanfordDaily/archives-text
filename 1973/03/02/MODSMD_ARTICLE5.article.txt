# All ASSU Proposals Lose
## 
### SUE KING 
All three measures on the ballot
were defeated in the special ASSU
election held Wednesday and
Thursday, according to unofficial
returns released last night.
Fee assessment referenda for the
Citizens Advocates at Stanford, Inc.
and the Debate Union were voted
down 1433 to 680, and 1452 to 634,
respectively. The third measure, a

proposal to have the ASSU Senate
spend $50 from the Senate
discretionary fund to publicize ways in
which students can contribute to the
rebuilding of Bach Mai Hospital, was
defeated 1292 to 818.
Conway Collis, a spokesman for
Citizens Advocates, said that the idea
of a public interest law firm would
probably be dropped.
"This was Citizens Advocates last
chance," he said. "It's obvious that the
student body won't support a public
interest law firm." Students defeated a
similar fee assessment referendum in
April, 1972.
Grateful
John Bradley, a member of Citizens
Advocates' Board of Directors, said
last night, "We are grateful to the 680
students who took time to consider
the issue without considering their
wallets at the same time."
Bradley added that it was
"unfortunate" the opponents of the
fee assessment would "believe the lies
which were printed" on anonymous
leaflets distributed throughout the
campus.
According to Gary Roberts, coach
of the Debate Union, there are other
options for funding which are open to
the group. He mentioned fund-raising
activities, the Program Fee assessment
in the spring election, and gifts from
alumni as possibilities for raising
money.
May Be Resubmitted
"We may resubmit a fee assessment
petition next year if we can't get

enough money otherwise," he said.
In a prepared statement, ASSU
President Scott Burke said last night,
"The students have shown real wisdom
in decisively rejecting the law firm fee
assessment. Citizens Advocates was
unquestionably an unjustified rip-off
of Stanford students. For that reason,
I campaigned actively against the
proposal.
"I hope that the defeat of Citizens
Advocates will prove beyond doubt
that groups seeking assessments must
fully justify and explain their
programs and expenses. Students want
to know that such proposals directly
benefit them, in spite of the fact that
all fees are now refundable.
Alternative Program
"Those who believe in the
desireability of a bona fide legal aid
program directly benefitting Stanford
students should know that my
colleague, ASSU Co-president Peter
Van Petten, and I have been working
to establish an alternative program
designed to assist and advise students
in their legal problems.
"We will soon have a proposal to
announce for just such an
organization. In addition, Mr. Van
Petten has decided to work with the
leaders of the Debate Union to try to
arrange financing for that group."
ASSU Elections Commissioner
Mike Nilsson said that he was not
surprised at the results of the election.
"It showed a marked conservatism on
campus," he said, "a trend against
voting 'yes' on fee assessments."
