# Rosenhan Recalls His Experience As Fake Mental Hospital Patient

Prof. David Rosenhan picked up
the coat and held it out to the
audience. It is a good coat, he said, not
fancy but a good coat. He put it in a
trash can sitting next to the podium.
In the trash can, he said, the coat is a
piece of garbage.
"People are the same way," said the
eloquent, balding psychology
professor. "Somehow the contexts in
which we see people shape our
percpptions. If you see a sane person
in an insane place, you just might not
notice that he is sane."
Rosenhan was making his remarks
to an overflow crowd of 200 at the
Children's Theater last night in Palo
Alto in a series of talks jointly
sponsored by Stanford and Palo Alto.
The domenatly middle-aged crowd had
come to hear about Rosenhan's much
publicized stay in a mental hospital.
Rosenhan and seven others had
themselves admitted as patients to a
total of 12 mental hospitals during a
three year period. They described
hallucinations and "empty" feelings
and were diagnosed as paranoid
schizophrenics. As soon as they were
admitted they began acting normally
and waited for the hospital staff to
notice.
The hospital staff never did,
although many of the real patients
caught on to the fakes. Most of the
Rosenhan group were released as
schizophrenics in remission.
"That we were admitted to the
hospital," said Rosenhan, "should
surprise no one ... It is the leap from
describing hallucinations to the
diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia
that's important."
Once the diagnosis was made, said
Rosenhan, all behavior was interpreted
according to the diagnosis. "There
was, in fact, very little we could do to
convince the staff that we were sane."

For instance, the pseudo-patients
begin taking notes openly. This was
noted in their records as "Patient
engages in writing behavior."
The patients often paced the
corridors. This was because, said
Rosenhan, there was little else to do.
The staff interpreted it as evidence of
nervousness.
Rosenhan said he became unshaven
because the dull G.I. razors they were
given were painful to shave with. This
was taken as indication of patient
apathy.

"I rather assumed I must know
psychiatric hospitals . . ." said
Rosenhan, "only to find I didn't know
them at all."
He said that even concerned,
well-intentioned staff members
become immune to the notions of
what patients go through. He said that
there is a discrepancy of perspectives
between staff and patient.
"My reactions changed, instead of
describing a person as totally crazy, 1
was signaling out a behavior as
peculiar."
