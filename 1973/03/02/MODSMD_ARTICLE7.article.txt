# Guess Who's Coming To Dinner
## Frat Fracas Fixed 
### 
Jerry Coleman

Those of you who read last
week's column on fraternity
attacks may remember my
discussing in detail the house up
the hill from my own. A new
chapter has since been added to
that story which I feel obligated
to relate to you.
First let me provide a very
brief synopsis of the pertinent
parts of last week's story for those
among you who were out of town
and unable to read last Friday's
Daily.
I mentioned that my neighbors
(callously referred to as
Dingleberry Pi's) were fond of
hurling bottles through our dining
room windows. Some of their
other pranks were included in the
article to give you a complete
image of these frat fellows.
Chapter Two
Now chapter two can be told.
I'll lay all the facts out for you:
my house is Theta Xi (everybody
calls us Xi's); their house is Delta
Tau Delta (everybody calls them,
with great awe and some scorn,
the Delts). Last week I told true
events, yet presented an image of
the Delts commonly held by Xi's
but not particularly accurate.
This image is based on the
observations that many Delts are
members of the varsity football
team; that most Delts are
physically big; and that the
broken glass along the side of our
house did not fall from the skies
during recent inclement weather.
God only knows their image of us.
Last weekend at 1 a.m. two
Delts came down the hill from
their party and yelled for Jerry
Coleman. Always eager for some
pleasant social intercourse, I
opened my window and replied,
"Yeah?"
Proper Attire
"Are you the guy who wrote
the Daily article?" they asked;
and, fool that I am, I answered in
the affirmative. "We'd like to have
you up for dinner Tuesday
night—sixish."
"Alone? Can I bring my
roommate?" was my response.
After securing their permission on
this matter I asked what I should
wear.
"Casual attire," said one. As
they left, the other shouted over
his shoulder, "Doesn't matter
what you wear—you'll go home
naked."
Mounting Trepidation
Well—what did I get myself
into? As Tuesday approached, my
fellow Xi's gave me all sorts of
advice on self-defense, passive
non-resistance, finding the county
Sheriff's phone number, and how
to look good on a platter with an
apple in my mouth.
The fatal night arrived, and I
left last minute instructions with
the Xi Vice President and Warlord
to call the Delts if I didn't return
by 7 p.m. and say there was a long i
distance call for me.
The Xi Minister of Defense
replied dryly, "I'll bet they

answer with something like, 'We
don't know where Jerry is; last we
saw he was at the Lake looking
for his pants.' " I thanked him for
the moral support, and my
roommate and I headed up the
hill toward the Delt
House .. . and destiny.
A True Story
Readers, I swear to you by the
wart on my left big toe, that every
word that follows is true, and all
quotes as verbatim as memory
allows. All in all, it was an
amazing put-on.
We two Xi's were greeted at
the Delt door by a hulk of a man.
"Come with me;" he boomed.
"You must be from next door.
Which one of you is Coleman?"
"Let me show you around a
bit," he continued. "Here's a
typical room—don't let the bones
all over the floor get in your
way." Their rooms looked just
like ours, and contrary to popular
belief, they were not swimming
about in tubs of beer but reading
the paper quietly, waiting for
dinner.
Decorum
The bell rang and we moved to
the dining room. The Delt on my
right remained standing beside the
table and whispered "We don't sit
until the president enters the
room."
Later, a hasher announced that
the benches were special for the
guests; "Usually we sit on the
floor," he indicated. Another Delt
picked up his folk and exclaimed,
"Hey, we got silverware tonight!"
"Please pass the zesty steak
sauce," someone said, as another
handed me a pitcher of water.
"We normally drink blood, but
tonight we're all out," was his
comment.
Good Humor
One burly lad got up, called for
attention, then announced,
"Today we beat up four hippies."
There was wild applause,
interrupted only by the Delt
across the table from me who
confided, "They are acting so
ludicrous this evening."
My roommate and I were in
troduced, to wild cheers.
Someone's "Let's hear it for
Theta Xi" yell was also well
received. Then the social chairman
told of the coming weekend's ski
party. "And for those of you
staying here, there'll be plenty of
beer ... in bottles," he added, to
hearty and good-humored
laughter.
The meal finally over, I was
shown the porch from which all
bottles are thrown. Sensing my
amazement at the great distance
separating the two houses, one
Delt commented, "We have arm
developing exercises ' every
morning."
The Moral
I made a motion to leave, since
it was close to 7 p.m., and I didn't
want to worry the Xi's. As we
parted at the Delt door I reflected
soberly upon stereotypes and how

misleading they can be. "The next
time you guys plan to throw
bottles, call me up;" I said,
adding, "/'d like to throw some
too; it looks like fun."
And in an effort to further
normalize relations between our
houses, I invited them to dine
with the Xi's sometime soon. "Ich
bin ein Delt," I said, proudly
surveying their house, then
walked home.
Both fraternities will issue full
protocols at a press conference in
the near future. Peace is at hand!
(Indeed a strange and terrible
saga. Jerry Coleman s column,
should he survive further
interhellenic rumbles, appears
every Friday on this page. For
interested Delts, he drives a blue
Toyota.)

Those of you who read last
week's column on fraternity
attacks may remember my
discussing in detail the house up
the hill from my own. A new
chapter has since been added to
that story which I feel obligated
to relate to you.
First let me provide a very
brief synopsis of the pertinent
parts of last week's story for those
among you who were out of town
and unable to read last Friday's
Daily.
I mentioned that my neighbors
(callously referred to as
Dingleberry Pi's) were fond of
hurling bottles through our dining
room windows. Some of their
other pranks were included in the
article to give you a complete
image of these frat fellows.
Chapter Two
Now chapter two can be told.
I'll lay all the facts out for you:
my house is Theta Xi (everybody
calls us Xi's); their house is Delta
Tau Delta (everybody calls them,
with great awe and some scorn,
the Delts). Last week I told true
events, yet presented an image of
the Delts commonly held by Xi's
but not particularly accurate.
This image is based on the
observations that many Delts are
members of the varsity football
team; that most Delts are
physically big; and that the
broken glass along the side of our
house did not fall from the skies
during recent inclement weather.
God only knows their image of us.
Last weekend at 1 a.m. two
Delts came down the hill from
their party and yelled for Jerry
Coleman. Always eager for some
pleasant social intercourse, I
opened my window and replied,
"Yeah?"
Proper Attire
"Are you the guy who wrote
the Daily article?" they asked;
and, fool that I am, I answered in
the affirmative. "We'd like to have
you up for dinner Tuesday
night—sixish."
"Alone? Can I bring my
roommate?" was my response.
After securing their permission on
this matter I asked what I should
wear.
"Casual attire," said one. As
they left, the other shouted over
his shoulder, "Doesn't matter
what you wear—you'll go home
naked."
Mounting Trepidation
Well—what did I get myself
into? As Tuesday approached, my
fellow Xi's gave me all sorts of
advice on self-defense, passive
non-resistance, finding the county
Sheriff's phone number, and how
to look good on a platter with an
apple in my mouth.
The fatal night arrived, and I
left last minute instructions with
the Xi Vice President and Warlord
to call the Delts if I didn't return
by 7 p.m. and say there was a long i
distance call for me.
The Xi Minister of Defense
replied dryly, "I'll bet they

answer with something like, 'We
don't know where Jerry is; last we
saw he was at the Lake looking
for his pants.' " I thanked him for
the moral support, and my
roommate and I headed up the
hill toward the Delt
House .. . and destiny.
A True Story
Readers, I swear to you by the
wart on my left big toe, that every
word that follows is true, and all
quotes as verbatim as memory
allows. All in all, it was an
amazing put-on.
We two Xi's were greeted at
the Delt door by a hulk of a man.
"Come with me;" he boomed.
"You must be from next door.
Which one of you is Coleman?"
"Let me show you around a
bit," he continued. "Here's a
typical room—don't let the bones
all over the floor get in your
way." Their rooms looked just
like ours, and contrary to popular
belief, they were not swimming
about in tubs of beer but reading
the paper quietly, waiting for
dinner.
Decorum
The bell rang and we moved to
the dining room. The Delt on my
right remained standing beside the
table and whispered "We don't sit
until the president enters the
room."
Later, a hasher announced that
the benches were special for the
guests; "Usually we sit on the
floor," he indicated. Another Delt
picked up his folk and exclaimed,
"Hey, we got silverware tonight!"
"Please pass the zesty steak
sauce," someone said, as another
handed me a pitcher of water.
"We normally drink blood, but
tonight we're all out," was his
comment.
Good Humor
One burly lad got up, called for
attention, then announced,
"Today we beat up four hippies."
There was wild applause,
interrupted only by the Delt
across the table from me who
confided, "They are acting so
ludicrous this evening."
My roommate and I were in
troduced, to wild cheers.
Someone's "Let's hear it for
Theta Xi" yell was also well
received. Then the social chairman
told of the coming weekend's ski
party. "And for those of you
staying here, there'll be plenty of
beer ... in bottles," he added, to
hearty and good-humored
laughter.
The meal finally over, I was
shown the porch from which all
bottles are thrown. Sensing my
amazement at the great distance
separating the two houses, one
Delt commented, "We have arm
developing exercises ' every
morning."
The Moral
I made a motion to leave, since
it was close to 7 p.m., and I didn't
want to worry the Xi's. As we
parted at the Delt door I reflected
soberly upon stereotypes and how

misleading they can be. "The next
time you guys plan to throw
bottles, call me up;" I said,
adding, "/'d like to throw some
too; it looks like fun."
And in an effort to further
normalize relations between our
houses, I invited them to dine
with the Xi's sometime soon. "Ich
bin ein Delt," I said, proudly
surveying their house, then
walked home.
Both fraternities will issue full
protocols at a press conference in
the near future. Peace is at hand!

saga. Jerry Coleman s column,

Those of you who read last
week's column on fraternity
attacks may remember my
discussing in detail the house up
the hill from my own. A new
chapter has since been added to
that story which I feel obligated
to relate to you.
First let me provide a very
brief synopsis of the pertinent
parts of last week's story for those
among you who were out of town
and unable to read last Friday's
Daily.
I mentioned that my neighbors
(callously referred to as
Dingleberry Pi's) were fond of
hurling bottles through our dining
room windows. Some of their
other pranks were included in the
article to give you a complete
image of these frat fellows.
Chapter Two
Now chapter two can be told.
I'll lay all the facts out for you:
my house is Theta Xi (everybody
calls us Xi's); their house is Delta
Tau Delta (everybody calls them,
with great awe and some scorn,
the Delts). Last week I told true
events, yet presented an image of
the Delts commonly held by Xi's
but not particularly accurate.
This image is based on the
observations that many Delts are
members of the varsity football
team; that most Delts are
physically big; and that the
broken glass along the side of our
house did not fall from the skies
during recent inclement weather.
God only knows their image of us.
Last weekend at 1 a.m. two
Delts came down the hill from
their party and yelled for Jerry
Coleman. Always eager for some
pleasant social intercourse, I
opened my window and replied,
"Yeah?"
Proper Attire
"Are you the guy who wrote
the Daily article?" they asked;
and, fool that I am, I answered in
the affirmative. "We'd like to have
you up for dinner Tuesday
night—sixish."
"Alone? Can I bring my
roommate?" was my response.
After securing their permission on
this matter I asked what I should
wear.
"Casual attire," said one. As
they left, the other shouted over
his shoulder, "Doesn't matter
what you wear—you'll go home
naked."
Mounting Trepidation
Well—what did I get myself
into? As Tuesday approached, my
fellow Xi's gave me all sorts of
advice on self-defense, passive
non-resistance, finding the county
Sheriff's phone number, and how
to look good on a platter with an
apple in my mouth.
The fatal night arrived, and I
left last minute instructions with
the Xi Vice President and Warlord
to call the Delts if I didn't return
by 7 p.m. and say there was a long i
distance call for me.
The Xi Minister of Defense
replied dryly, "I'll bet they

answer with something like, 'We
don't know where Jerry is; last we
saw he was at the Lake looking
for his pants.' " I thanked him for
the moral support, and my
roommate and I headed up the
hill toward the Delt
House .. . and destiny.
A True Story
Readers, I swear to you by the
wart on my left big toe, that every
word that follows is true, and all
quotes as verbatim as memory
allows. All in all, it was an
amazing put-on.
We two Xi's were greeted at
the Delt door by a hulk of a man.
"Come with me;" he boomed.
"You must be from next door.
Which one of you is Coleman?"
"Let me show you around a
bit," he continued. "Here's a
typical room—don't let the bones
all over the floor get in your
way." Their rooms looked just
like ours, and contrary to popular
belief, they were not swimming
about in tubs of beer but reading
the paper quietly, waiting for
dinner.
Decorum
The bell rang and we moved to
the dining room. The Delt on my
right remained standing beside the
table and whispered "We don't sit
until the president enters the
room."
Later, a hasher announced that
the benches were special for the
guests; "Usually we sit on the
floor," he indicated. Another Delt
picked up his folk and exclaimed,
"Hey, we got silverware tonight!"
"Please pass the zesty steak
sauce," someone said, as another
handed me a pitcher of water.
"We normally drink blood, but
tonight we're all out," was his
comment.
Good Humor
One burly lad got up, called for
attention, then announced,
"Today we beat up four hippies."
There was wild applause,
interrupted only by the Delt
across the table from me who
confided, "They are acting so
ludicrous this evening."
My roommate and I were in
troduced, to wild cheers.
Someone's "Let's hear it for
Theta Xi" yell was also well
received. Then the social chairman
told of the coming weekend's ski
party. "And for those of you
staying here, there'll be plenty of
beer ... in bottles," he added, to
hearty and good-humored
laughter.
The meal finally over, I was
shown the porch from which all
bottles are thrown. Sensing my
amazement at the great distance
separating the two houses, one
Delt commented, "We have arm
developing exercises ' every
morning."
The Moral
I made a motion to leave, since
it was close to 7 p.m., and I didn't
want to worry the Xi's. As we
parted at the Delt door I reflected
soberly upon stereotypes and how

misleading they can be. "The next
time you guys plan to throw
bottles, call me up;" I said,
adding, "/'d like to throw some
too; it looks like fun."
And in an effort to further
normalize relations between our
houses, I invited them to dine
with the Xi's sometime soon. "Ich
bin ein Delt," I said, proudly
surveying their house, then
walked home.
Both fraternities will issue full
protocols at a press conference in
the near future. Peace is at hand!

saga. Jerry Coleman s column,

interhellenic rumbles, appears
