# Palestinian Guerrillas Surrender; Arabian Embassy Takeover Ends
## 
### 
KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) - Flashing
victory signs with their fingers, eight
Palestinian guerrillas filed out of the
blood-spattered Saudi Arabian
Embassy yesterday to end a 60-hour
takeover that cost the lives of three
diplomats.
The bodies of U.S. Ambassador
Cleo A. Noel Jr., U.S. Charge
d'Affaires G. Curtis Moore and Belgian
Charge d'Affaires Guy Eid were
brought out wrapped in burlap.
The Jordanian Charge d'Affaires,
Adley el Nasser; the Saudi Arabian
ambassador, Abdullah Malhouk, and
Malhouk's wife were released unharmed
by the Black September guerrillas who
took over the embassy with machine
guns during a reception Thursday
evening.
The diplomats were shot Friday
night in the embassy basement. The
U.S. Embassy here released the text of
a brief telephone call from Noel two
hours before his death.
Too Late
"Is there any news?" he asked.
"Are we being overheard?" replied
a U.S. Embassy officer.

"Yes," replied Noel.
"A high-ranking American official
is due to arrive tonight," said the
embassy officer.
"That will be too late," were Noel's
last words before the telephone
connection was cut off.
Pools Of Blood
A Sudanese army officer who
entered the embassy basement
yesterday morning saw large pools of
blood, spent cartridge cases and a wrist
watch lying in the blood.
President Jaefar el Numairi sent a
cable to President Nixon indicating the
Sudanese government intends to deal
firmly with the guerrillas, who are
being held at army headquarters in
Khartoum.
"What has happened here has
grieved me personally as well as my
government and countrymen," he said.
"We find the killing of these men
outrageous."
American consular officer Carol
Roehl said the bodies of the diplomats
were "almost unrecognizable," badly
mutilated with multiple bullet
wounds. She said it appeared Noel also

had been strangled, but the autopsy
results were not immediately available.
An official plane dispatched by
Nixon arrived in Khartoum with three
of the American diplomats' children
and two caskets.
John F. Noel, 21; Lucky Anne
Moore, 22, and Catherine Jane Moore,
20, joined their mothers at an embassy
home.
Embassy staffers who took turns
staying with the two women during
the ordeal said both were "bearing up
well, better than us."
Presidential Jet
The presidential jet was to leave

Khartoum with the caskets and family
members this morning.
The Sudanese army said the
guerrillas were armed with hand
grenades, four machine guns, three
long-barreled revolvers and about 100
rounds of ammunition.
The Saudi ambassador said the men
had rigged explosives on the ground
floor of the embassy building, which
were removed by Sudanese ordnance
experts yesterday morning.
The surrender was negotiated by
Vice President Mohammed el Bakir,
who gave the guerrillas a dawn
deadline with no concessions.

the ordeal said both were "bearing up
well, better than us."
Presidential Jet
The presidential jet was to leave

Khartoum with the caskets and family
members this morning.
The Sudanese army said the
guerrillas were armed with hand
grenades, four machine guns, three
long-barreled revolvers and about 100
rounds of ammunition.
The Saudi ambassador said the men
had rigged explosives on the ground
floor of the embassy building, which
were removed by Sudanese ordnance
experts yesterday morning.
The surrender was negotiated by
Vice President Mohammed el Bakir,
who gave the guerrillas a dawn
deadline with no concessions.
KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) - Flashing
victory signs with their fingers, eight
Palestinian guerrillas filed out of the
blood-spattered Saudi Arabian
Embassy yesterday to end a 60-hour
takeover that cost the lives of three
diplomats.
The bodies of U.S. Ambassador
Cleo A. Noel Jr., U.S. Charge
d'Affaires G. Curtis Moore and Belgian
Charge d'Affaires Guy Eid were
brought out wrapped in burlap.
The Jordanian Charge d'Affaires,
Adley el Nasser; the Saudi Arabian
ambassador, Abdullah Malhouk, and
Malhouk's wife were released unharmed
by the Black September guerrillas who
took over the embassy with machine
guns during a reception Thursday
evening.
The diplomats were shot Friday
night in the embassy basement. The
U.S. Embassy here released the text of
a brief telephone call from Noel two
hours before his death.
Too Late
"Is there any news?" he asked.
"Are we being overheard?" replied
a U.S. Embassy officer.

"Yes," replied Noel.
"A high-ranking American official
is due to arrive tonight," said the
embassy officer.
"That will be too late," were Noel's
last words before the telephone
connection was cut off.
Pools Of Blood
A Sudanese army officer who
entered the embassy basement
yesterday morning saw large pools of
blood, spent cartridge cases and a wrist
watch lying in the blood.
President Jaefar el Numairi sent a
cable to President Nixon indicating the
Sudanese government intends to deal
firmly with the guerrillas, who are
being held at army headquarters in
Khartoum.
"What has happened here has
grieved me personally as well as my
government and countrymen," he said.
"We find the killing of these men
outrageous."
American consular officer Carol
Roehl said the bodies of the diplomats
were "almost unrecognizable," badly
mutilated with multiple bullet
wounds. She said it appeared Noel also

had been strangled, but the autopsy
results were not immediately available.
An official plane dispatched by
Nixon arrived in Khartoum with three
of the American diplomats' children
and two caskets.
John F. Noel, 21; Lucky Anne
Moore, 22, and Catherine Jane Moore,
20, joined their mothers at an embassy
home.
Embassy staffers who took turns
staying with the two women during
the ordeal said both were "bearing up
well, better than us."
