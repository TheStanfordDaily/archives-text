# No Choice But To Raise Taxes
## Congress And The Deficit 
### 
Paul N. McCloskey

The impoundment of funds by
President Nixon is forcing
Congress to finally face up to its
own fiscal responsibilities.
Cutbacks in health, housing,
poverty programs and
environmental protection have
brought anguished cries from a
majority of the Members of
Congress.
Despite the general dismay in
Congress, however, we have only
ourselves to blame. Last year, for
example, Congress appropriated
$261 billion, $36 billion more
than was received from tax
revenues. As we neared
adjournment, we agreed that the
President should cut spending
back to $250 billion for the year
ending June 30, a slash of $11
billion. Since Congress lacked the
procedure to determine where the
cuts should be made, the decision
was inevitably left to the
President.
Now we find ourselves in
almost universal disagreement
with the decisions he has made,
such as those to phase out the
OEO Legal Ffrvices program and
medical research training grants.
Tax Raise
If Congress is to challenge the
President's power to cut monies
we have appropriated, however,
then we ourselves will have to
either cut spending or raise taxes
or both. If there is merit in a
balanced budget during periods of
peace and prosperity, as I believe
there is, there is no question but
that we will have to raise taxes.
Consider the figures: this year's
deficit, $25 billion, last year $23
billion, the year before $23
billion.
The recent devaluation of the
dollar, as well as continuing
inflation, are direct results of this
perennial federal deficit.
Balance Deficit
The balance of payments
problem shows a similar trend.
During the first eight years of the
1960'5, on a liquidity basis, U.S.
payments averaged a deficit of
$2.6 billion annually. In 1969 the
first year of the Nixon
Administration, the deficit rose to
$6.1 billion, dropped back to $3.8
billion in 1970, but rose to a
whopping $22 billion in 1971,
followed by approximately $14
billion in the year just ended.
For the first time, the export
value of merchandise abroad
dropped below the value of
imports in 1971, and for the first
nine months of 1972 imports
were exceeding exports at a rate
of nearly $10 billion per year.
Clearly, inflation in America has
increased the cost of
America-produced goods to a
point where they are neither
competitive abroad, nor in many
cases, even here at home.
We hear growing clamor to
increase tariffs in order to protect

American jobs. While devaluation
of the dollar may help to cure this
problem, the real evil is continued
excessive federal spending without
corresponding tax revenues to
match.
Experience
The President has this year
proposed a deficit of $12 billion.
(The defense budget, even with
the Vietnam war ending, is
proposed to be increased by over
$5 billion.) If past experience is
any guide, a proposed deficit of

$12 billion will end up easily over
twice that amount. This has been
the result in each of the past three
years.
Only Congress can restore
federal responsibility. From my
standpoint, it looks as if we have
no choice but to increase federal
income taxes since there seems no
way to put together the coalition
necessary to cut the defense
budget and other expenditures
sufficiently to balance the budget.
Hopefully, we can accompany

such increase with tax reform
which will make the income tax
laws both fairer and simpler.
I see no other course of action
which will permit us to end the
twin dangers of inflation and
continuing balance-of-payments
deficits. As strong as our country
is, we cannot afford to continue
any longer the deficits of the past
three years.

President Nixon is forcing
Congress to finally face up to its
own fiscal responsibilities.
Cutbacks in health, housing,
poverty programs and
environmental protection have
brought anguished cries from a
majority of the Members of
Congress.
Despite the general dismay in
Congress, however, we have only
ourselves to blame. Last year, for
example, Congress appropriated
$261 billion, $36 billion more
than was received from tax
revenues. As we neared
adjournment, we agreed that the
President should cut spending
back to $250 billion for the year
ending June 30, a slash of $11
billion. Since Congress lacked the
procedure to determine where the
cuts should be made, the decision
was inevitably left to the
President.
Now we find ourselves in
almost universal disagreement
with the decisions he has made,
such as those to phase out the
OEO Legal Ffrvices program and
medical research training grants.
Tax Raise
If Congress is to challenge the
President's power to cut monies
we have appropriated, however,
then we ourselves will have to
either cut spending or raise taxes
or both. If there is merit in a
balanced budget during periods of
peace and prosperity, as I believe
there is, there is no question but
that we will have to raise taxes.
Consider the figures: this year's
deficit, $25 billion, last year $23
billion, the year before $23
billion.
The recent devaluation of the
dollar, as well as continuing
inflation, are direct results of this
perennial federal deficit.
Balance Deficit
The balance of payments
problem shows a similar trend.
During the first eight years of the
1960'5, on a liquidity basis, U.S.
payments averaged a deficit of
$2.6 billion annually. In 1969 the
first year of the Nixon
Administration, the deficit rose to
$6.1 billion, dropped back to $3.8
billion in 1970, but rose to a
whopping $22 billion in 1971,
followed by approximately $14
billion in the year just ended.
For the first time, the export
value of merchandise abroad
dropped below the value of
imports in 1971, and for the first
nine months of 1972 imports
were exceeding exports at a rate
of nearly $10 billion per year.
Clearly, inflation in America has
increased the cost of
America-produced goods to a
point where they are neither
competitive abroad, nor in many
cases, even here at home.
We hear growing clamor to
increase tariffs in order to protect

American jobs. While devaluation
of the dollar may help to cure this
problem, the real evil is continued
excessive federal spending without
corresponding tax revenues to
match.
Experience
The President has this year
proposed a deficit of $12 billion.
(The defense budget, even with
the Vietnam war ending, is
proposed to be increased by over
$5 billion.) If past experience is
any guide, a proposed deficit of

$12 billion will end up easily over
twice that amount. This has been
the result in each of the past three
years.
Only Congress can restore
federal responsibility. From my
standpoint, it looks as if we have
no choice but to increase federal
income taxes since there seems no
way to put together the coalition
necessary to cut the defense
budget and other expenditures
sufficiently to balance the budget.
Hopefully, we can accompany

such increase with tax reform
which will make the income tax
laws both fairer and simpler.
I see no other course of action
which will permit us to end the
twin dangers of inflation and
continuing balance-of-payments
deficits. As strong as our country
is, we cannot afford to continue
any longer the deficits of the past
three years.
