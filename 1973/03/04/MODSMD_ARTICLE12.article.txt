An Outrageous Act
Editor:
Gary Koutcher's letter (Daily,
March 2) which tries to justify the
shooting up of a public jetliner
with 113 innocent passengers by
Israel's Air Force is a small
addition to the fact of how
misinformed the American public,
in general, and Mr. Koutcher, in
particular, are about what is
happening in the Middle East.
The news media are saturated
with Israeli propaganda about
how vicious and barbaric the
Arabs are and how they want to
drive the Israelis into the sea.
Unfortunately for the Israelis,
their last outrageous act of
shooting down the jetliner could
not be covered up properly by
their lies and found no one in the
world to defend their act as
usually was the case.
If Mr. Koutcher thinks that the
shooting down of the plane by
phantom jets is justified even if all
evidence shows that it has strayed
off course due to bad weather and
bad navigational equipment and
"looked" suspicious while trying
to make it back across the canal, I
really wonder if he would have
felt the same thing if he was in
that airplane with all those
innocent people?
I am sorry to say, Mr.
Koutcher, that if the cartoon
bothered you so much more than
the killing which it tried to
picture there is something
basically wrong in your way of
thinking; but maybe you are not
the one to be blamed for it.

I was overrun by your outcries
of disbelief over the inalienable,
nay, indestructible murder of
innocent civilians aboard the
Libyan commercial jetliner shot
down by the Israeli air force.
Your moral fever has never been
more delicate, nor any less
movable, at least not since the
irrepressible destruction of Bach
Mai hospital by U.S. bombers.
This was no accident; it was pure
and simple premedicated
aggression; the wounds to
humanity will never be
completely redressed. But thank
God, you are not trying.
As Senator McGovern was
quick to comment — and we share
his sensations 1000 percent —
"why should we lay down our
lives for those who don't have
enough conviction to even stand
up for themselves? Even God
helps only those who help
themselves." Strengthened by
these sufficient words, let us go
on wisely; and in the hurried and
fleeting tradition of the
once-and-al way s proud
conscription eschewer, let us elect
to be moral, for without selective

morality, how can we ever face
ourselves again?

Santa Cruz Thumbing
Editor:
Don Tollefson's "Viewpoint"
column on hitchhiking at Santa
Cruz (Daily, Mar. 1) is laudable
for its concern, but his advice and
solutions miss an important point.
To parallel Palm Drive to the
situation at Santa Cruz is
misleading. In the first place,
UCSC is physically more remote
than Stanford, up a hill which
makes bicycling impractical.
Secondly, fewer students at UCSC
have cars than at Stanford. There
is also a definite lack of sufficient
public transportation in Santa
Cruz.
At present, the city bus system
there is heavily subsidized by
student fees, yet remains
unresponsive to the needs of
students: too few buses,
overcrowding, infrequent runs.
Winter rains and the present fears
have accentuated these failings.
Santa Cruz women hitchhike
because they have to; they are not
"willingly making themselves
extremely vulnerable" to rape and
murder. They are forced to "risk
their lives on the side of the road"
because of the unresponsive
policies of the Santa Cruz
authorities, not some abstract
"liberation." This is a concrete
situation: until women can move
without fear in their community,
they are not free. The issue is not
foolishness, it is irresponsibility

on the part of the police and
government of Santa Cruz.

I commend Rod Koon for his
singular effort to "Liberate
Language" from sexism. How
many young men of Mr. Koon's
age would so unselfishly abstain
from the pleasures of social
intercourse, and instead beat away
at the diminutive human
sensitivity of their Funk &
Wagnalls? Of course there will be
those who say that Mr. Koon, by
virtue of his gender, has no right
to ejaculate an opinion on
feminist issues. But do not let the
badmouthers interruptus your
pursuit, Mr. Koon. As I am sure
you know, they are the same
unerrect minds who once said a
white man has no right to tell
nigger jokes. Prod on, Mr. Koon,

If Mr. Koutcher thinks that the
shooting down of the plane by
phantom jets is justified even if all
evidence shows that it has strayed
off course due to bad weather and
bad navigational equipment and
"looked" suspicious while trying
to make it back across the canal, I
really wonder if he would have
felt the same thing if he was in
that airplane with all those
innocent people?
I am sorry to say, Mr.
Koutcher, that if the cartoon
bothered you so much more than
the killing which it tried to
picture there is something
basically wrong in your way of
thinking; but maybe you are not
the one to be blamed for it.

I was overrun by your outcries

nay, indestructible murder of
innocent civilians aboard the
Libyan commercial jetliner shot
down by the Israeli air force.
Your moral fever has never been
more delicate, nor any less
movable, at least not since the
irrepressible destruction of Bach
Mai hospital by U.S. bombers.
This was no accident; it was pure
and simple premedicated
aggression; the wounds to
humanity will never be
completely redressed. But thank
God, you are not trying.
As Senator McGovern was

Santa Cruz Thumbing
Editor:
Don Tollefson's "Viewpoint"
column on hitchhiking at Santa
Cruz (Daily, Mar. 1) is laudable
for its concern, but his advice and
solutions miss an important point.
To parallel Palm Drive to the
situation at Santa Cruz is
misleading. In the first place,
UCSC is physically more remote
than Stanford, up a hill which
makes bicycling impractical.
Secondly, fewer students at UCSC
have cars than at Stanford. There
is also a definite lack of sufficient
public transportation in Santa
Cruz.
At present, the city bus system
there is heavily subsidized by
student fees, yet remains
unresponsive to the needs of
students: too few buses,
overcrowding, infrequent runs.
Winter rains and the present fears
have accentuated these failings.
Santa Cruz women hitchhike
because they have to; they are not
"willingly making themselves
extremely vulnerable" to rape and
murder. They are forced to "risk
their lives on the side of the road"
because of the unresponsive
policies of the Santa Cruz
authorities, not some abstract
"liberation." This is a concrete
situation: until women can move
without fear in their community,
they are not free. The issue is not
foolishness, it is irresponsibility

on the part of the police and
government of Santa Cruz.

Editor:
I was overrun by your outcries
of disbelief over the inalienable,
nay, indestructible murder of
innocent civilians aboard the
Libyan commercial jetliner shot
down by the Israeli air force.
Your moral fever has never been
more delicate, nor any less
movable, at least not since the
irrepressible destruction of Bach
Mai hospital by U.S. bombers.
This was no accident; it was pure
and simple premedicated
aggression; the wounds to
humanity will never be
completely redressed. But thank
God, you are not trying.
As Senator McGovern was
quick to comment — and we share
his sensations 1000 percent —
"why should we lay down our
lives for those who don't have
enough conviction to even stand
up for themselves? Even God
helps only those who help
themselves." Strengthened by
these sufficient words, let us go
on wisely; and in the hurried and
fleeting tradition of the
once-and-al way s proud
conscription eschewer, let us elect
to be moral, for without selective

morality, how can we ever face
ourselves again?

Santa Cruz Thumbing
Editor:
Don Tollefson's "Viewpoint"
column on hitchhiking at Santa
Cruz (Daily, Mar. 1) is laudable
for its concern, but his advice and
solutions miss an important point.
To parallel Palm Drive to the
situation at Santa Cruz is
misleading. In the first place,
UCSC is physically more remote
than Stanford, up a hill which
makes bicycling impractical.
Secondly, fewer students at UCSC
have cars than at Stanford. There
is also a definite lack of sufficient
public transportation in Santa
Cruz.
At present, the city bus system
there is heavily subsidized by
student fees, yet remains
unresponsive to the needs of
students: too few buses,
overcrowding, infrequent runs.
Winter rains and the present fears
have accentuated these failings.
Santa Cruz women hitchhike
because they have to; they are not
"willingly making themselves
extremely vulnerable" to rape and
murder. They are forced to "risk
their lives on the side of the road"
because of the unresponsive
policies of the Santa Cruz
authorities, not some abstract
"liberation." This is a concrete
situation: until women can move
without fear in their community,
they are not free. The issue is not
foolishness, it is irresponsibility

on the part of the police and
government of Santa Cruz.

Some readers of my column on
the need for a union at Stanford
(Daily, March 1) apparently
inferred either non-recognition or
criticism of United Stanford
Employees. I am a member in
good standing of U.S.E., and no
such criticism was intended.

I commend Rod Koon for his
singular effort to "Liberate
Language" from sexism. How
many young men of Mr. Koon's
age would so unselfishly abstain
from the pleasures of social
intercourse, and instead beat away
at the diminutive human
sensitivity of their Funk &
Wagnalls? Of course there will be
those who say that Mr. Koon, by
virtue of his gender, has no right
to ejaculate an opinion on
feminist issues. But do not let the
badmouthers interruptus your
pursuit, Mr. Koon. As I am sure
you know, they are the same
unerrect minds who once said a
white man has no right to tell
nigger jokes. Prod on, Mr. Koon,
prod on.

An Outrageous Act
Editor:
Gary Koutcher's letter (Daily,
March 2) which tries to justify the
shooting up of a public jetliner
with 113 innocent passengers by
Israel's Air Force is a small
addition to the fact of how
misinformed the American public,
in general, and Mr. Koutcher, in
particular, are about what is
happening in the Middle East.
The news media are saturated
with Israeli propaganda about
how vicious and barbaric the
Arabs are and how they want to
drive the Israelis into the sea.
Unfortunately for the Israelis,
their last outrageous act of
shooting down the jetliner could
not be covered up properly by
their lies and found no one in the
world to defend their act as
usually was the case.
If Mr. Koutcher thinks that the
shooting down of the plane by
phantom jets is justified even if all
evidence shows that it has strayed
off course due to bad weather and
bad navigational equipment and
"looked" suspicious while trying
to make it back across the canal, I
really wonder if he would have
felt the same thing if he was in
that airplane with all those
innocent people?
I am sorry to say, Mr.
Koutcher, that if the cartoon
bothered you so much more than
the killing which it tried to
picture there is something
basically wrong in your way of
thinking; but maybe you are not
the one to be blamed for it.
