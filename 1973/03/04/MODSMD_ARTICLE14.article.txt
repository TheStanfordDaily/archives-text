Could you list the number of foreign students from each country
enrolled in Stanford? M.M.R.
A total of 1,307 foreign students were enrolled at Stanford during
fall quarter. According to Ellen Wollenberg of the Bechtel
International Center, those figures are the most up-to-date that they
have, but that enrollment for winter quarter is generally the same as
fall quarter enrollment.
The breakdown by countries is as follows:
ASIA Lebanon 6
Hong Kong 92 Jordan 4
Taiwan 91 Iraq 3

H*7io has the key to Leland Stanford's tomb? The massive door to
the Mausoleum does have a keyhole, and, presumably, someone has
the power and authority to open it. Is there any possibility that an
eminent non-Stanford (like a University President) might be buried
there in the future? Perhaps such things are discussed in Stanford's
will. J.B.
The key to the Mausoleum is kept in the University Archives.
Every Founder's Day (March 11 this year) and Commencement Day
the marble doors to the Mausoleum are opened and people can see the
tombs of the three Stanfords.
No one has the authority to open Leland Stanford's tomb, but the
Reverend Robert M. Minto opens the Mausoleum for Founder's Day
and Commencement Day.
No one else will be buried there — the Founding Grant of the
University set aside a portion of 10 acres to be used as a cemetery, but
on Oct. 3, 1902, Mrs. Stanford overruled that decision and said that
no additional interments were to be made.

H*7io has the key to Leland Stanford's tomb? The massive door to
the Mausoleum does have a keyhole, and, presumably, someone has
the power and authority to open it. Is there any possibility that an
eminent non-Stanford (like a University President) might be buried
there in the future? Perhaps such things are discussed in Stanford's
will. J.B.
The key to the Mausoleum is kept in the University Archives.
Every Founder's Day (March 11 this year) and Commencement Day
the marble doors to the Mausoleum are opened and people can see the
tombs of the three Stanfords.
No one has the authority to open Leland Stanford's tomb, but the
Reverend Robert M. Minto opens the Mausoleum for Founder's Day
and Commencement Day.
No one else will be buried there — the Founding Grant of the
University set aside a portion of 10 acres to be used as a cemetery, but
on Oct. 3, 1902, Mrs. Stanford overruled that decision and said that
no additional interments were to be made.
Could you list the number of foreign students from each country
enrolled in Stanford? M.M.R.
A total of 1,307 foreign students were enrolled at Stanford during
fall quarter. According to Ellen Wollenberg of the Bechtel
International Center, those figures are the most up-to-date that they
have, but that enrollment for winter quarter is generally the same as
fall quarter enrollment.
