# Ellsberg Tells 'Pentagon Papers' Story
## 
### 
Dr. Daniel Ellsberg, a defendant in the
"Pentagon Papers" trial in Los Angeles, spoke
here 10 days ago at a civil liberties conference
sponsored by the Stanford Committee on
Political Education.
Ellsberg and co-defendant Anthony J. Russo
Jr. presently face a 13-count indictment on
charges of conspiracy, theft of government
property and espionage for allegedly duplicating
and distributing the top-secret study of American
»involvement in Vietnam between 1945 and 1967.
If convicted, Ellsberg, who holds a Ph.D. from
Harvard, could be sentenced to 105 years in
prison, while Russo, who holds two Master's
degrees from Princeton, could receive a 25-year
sentence. Both were employed by the Rand
Corp., a Santa Monica "think tank," at the time
of the allegedly illegal activities.
Before he returned to Los Angeles for another
week of trial — and the beginning of the defense
presentation — Ellsberg was interviewed by the
Daily's Ed Kohn and KZSU's Charles Bennett.
Here are excepts from that interview:
How would you describe your current
political views, and are you comfortable with
them after your experiences in the Marine Corps
and at Rand?
It's hard for me to describe. They're changing,
exploring. The "Pentagon Papers" and my own
experience earlier in Vietnam and in the
executive branch had gradually undermined my
confidence in the worth of most of my political
ideas. Up until that time [they] would have been
easily described as those of a Cold War
Democrat, a man who admired Truman- and
Acheson-type policies — toughness in the
international sphere and in principle liberalism at

It's clear that the people, just like Congress and executive officials, have not wanted
responsibility and have been glad to shift it to the shoulders of the President. That is
the comfort and the assurance of the institution of monarchy. You don't have the
power, but nobody accuses you of having it, so you don't bear the guilt or the
responsibilities for policies.

home although that seemed to go by the boards
often in competition with Cold War demands.
I knew where I was then pretty much, and a
lot of people in the Democratic Party are, I
think, still there, although everyone's been a
little shaken by the Vietnam War obviously. I
think that the lessons of this last decade are, in
general terms, that one has to question nearly
every received axiom and assumption, and
premise, even about fact in history, that we've
learned in college over the last generation and
more. That doesn't, of course, give you answers
as to what you should believe.
I think the "Pentagon Papers" did teach
people the rather specific lesson not to trust the
President's word on what he was doing, on what
he meant to do, or what our history had been.
Now that's painful knowledge, and people are
very reluctant to get it. I think that nothing less
than the documentary evidence of the "Pentagon
Papers" would have convinced a lot of people on
that. It's very unhappy knowledge, but it's
reality, and it's important knowledge. I think for
that reason that it was important and necessary
to put out the "Pentagon Papers."
But again, that doesn't leave you with a valid
understanding of what our reality is, or tell you
where to tum for information. I've been moving
in my thinking in a direction that I think
everyone could recognize as left, but that means
so many different things and has so many
different stopping points that it doesn't tell too
much.
In this very area, I was very interested in and
influenced by the personal example of a lot of
the people connected with the Institute for the
Study of Non-Violence or on the East Coast the
War Resisters' League, who share, I think, an
interest in Ghandian thinking, in a general way,
influenced by non-violent anarchist philosophy,
principles of decentralized power, and a great
emphasis on truth and honesty in political
relationships as well as individual relationships.
I've also increasingly in the last couple of
years been influenced by my reading of
American revolutionary and pre-revolutionary
history because I think in very many ways the
analogy is a very relevent one to us now. The
challenge facing us now is whether we wish to
continue with the way in which our government
has evolved in the last generation, and that is
toward a form of government under which
America was ruled from afar in the 1770's — in
other words, a monarchy. And although that was
not then and is not now the very worst kind of
government, instead it was one that the colonists
began to question in the 1960's and 1770'5,
rather abruptly, and concluded it was not the
way they wanted to live.
I think that's the challenge to us now — to ask
ourselves whether we really want to what
amounts to an elected monarchy in foreign
affairs and military affairs — which is what we

really do have — and whether we want it to be
extended to domestic affairs as well, which is
what I think President Nixon has in mind. I don't
think we should allow that, that would be very,
very much a change for the worse, not only for
us but for many foreign victims of our policies.
Do you think this problem, which you define
as an elected monarchy, is a problem that is
really defined in psychological terms across the
nation or in legal terms? Does it have to be
solved in psychological or legal terms?
Both, because I think that, just as it did in the
18th century, the notion of a single leader
deciding what is right, doing what is best in his
opinion for America, a man who has more
information than the rest of us, more resources
to draw on in learning the right course, and that
is the best possible way.
I think that idea has gained great acceptance
and legitimacy, in this country, the divine right
of Presidents, almost. The fact that we have the
ability to shift presidents in principle every four
years is less significant than the similarities are
signigicant. [These] similarities allow a single
leader to decide for himself to undertake action,
such as the bombing of Hanoi, without any
reference whatever to parliamentary
consultation, let alone real participation, without
any reference to written laws or the Constitution
or international laws and certainly against the
wishes of a majority of the people.
That kind of behavior, I think, was a little too
gross for most people. He overstepped, and I
think he knows that, and has stepped back from
it. Richard Nixon does learn from experience in
certain tactical ways, and he avoids political
mistakes.
The idea of checks and balances was invented
really 200 years ago. As a working institution in
this country, I think it is a very good one. I
appreciate it more and more, and I think we
should get back to it. Congres? is making noises
in that direction, but they have for some time,
and I don't think it should be taken for granted
at all that they will exercise the power that they
genuinely have through appropriations, through
appointments, through the possibility of tying up
legislation, even through the possibility of
impeachment, to influence or to check the
executive usurpation of power.
I don't think Congress will act.
Is it the executive branch that's doing the
most damage to the system of checks and
balances or is it the Supreme Court or the
Congress by its repeated failure to act during the
past couple of years?
Well, all of these, and many other
institutions in our society have one way or
another been complicit in the pursuit of this war
for so long or it couldn't have gone on. I include,
in other words, the churches, the universities, the
unions certainly, along with Congress and the
courts.
On the other hand, all of these institutions
have been, to a considerable degree, mislead —
willingly mislead, they could have learned more
than they did. They didn't want to know more.
They didn't want the responsibility. In general
terms, they approved of the policy, even if they
were worried about the scale of the costs or the
tactics. Still, the fact remains that they were
mislead, and we haven't had a full test of how
they would have acted if they had had a full

understanding of the kind of facts that werye in
the "Pentagon Papers," which is not the whole
story either by itself.
If the Supreme Court had access to the
"Pentagon Papers" do you think it would have
been more inclined to take up some of the
challenges to the Vietnam War that it never
accepted?
I of course have acted not upon the assurance
but upon the hope and with some expectation
that more conclusive evidence, more persuasive
knowledge of the directions of our policy would
have changed quite a few people and institutions.
For example, [former] Sen. (Wayne) Morse
(D.-Ore.) has stated recently that had he had the
evidence in the "Pentagon Papers" of the
provocations that were deliberately conducted
against North Vietnam in the spring of 1964
prior to the Tonkin Gulf episodes, he feels
certain that there would have been no Tonkin
Gulf resolution. Morse specifically believes that it
would never have gotten out of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee. It would certainly

I think it's wrong to believe that the President was forced by the American people to
do what he's doing and surely would have been punished if he had gotten out of the
war sooner. He likes to say that, he likes to believe that, Nixon does, because it
assures him of what he's been doing; he's following the national will, even if they
won't admit it publicly.

never have had the floor sponsorship of people
like Sen. (J. William) Fulbright (D.-Ark.). To say
the least, there would have been a debate that I
think would have changed the form of the policy
somewhat.
The courts in turn have not wanted to take up
these questions, but again, if they had known
precisely how contemptuous the executive had
been, how lying the executive had been about
that, they might have acted. Black and Douglas
always did believe that they should have acted.
Douglas, you may remember, said on television
just recently that he has believed for some time
from what he knew that the war was illegal in
international terms and unconstitutional and felt
that the Court should have dealt with it. The
Court didn't want to deal with it, but I think
with some different information it might have
been harder for them to avoid dealing with it.
Do you think that some of the people in
Congress are in any way guilty of war crimes for
their failure to act, or do you think that
responsibility lies so heavily on the executive
that it can't be pinned down on anyone in
Congress?
I think that there is a hierarchy of
responsibility, definitely. One has to approach it
from two directions. On the one hand it is true
that responsibility to some degree is shared very
widely in our society, beyond the institutions of
Congress down to the voters and newspaper
readers and others. On the other hand, to suggest
or pretend it is equally shared is not only absurd
but it's very quietistic, and amounts to saying
that no one is really responsible.
There's a great variation in the degree of
responsibility and it corresponds of course to the
degree of power that individuals and agencies had
to change the course of events, and also their
amount of information and their ability to get
more information. That starts above all with the
President. No other individual had anything like
comparable power to stop the war at any point.
No other individual had the ability to send B-52's
over Hanoi as Nixon just did. So certainly his
responsibility in this case — or his predecessor's
responsibility — is incomparably greater than any
other's.
Likewise the people closest to the President
bear particular responsibility. That also applies to
the fact that their ability to learn the history of
events, to learn information about what people
were really doing, if they wanted to know, was
much greater than anyone else. So you can say,
for example, that a congressman has a much
greater ability to find out the truth than, let's
say, an ordinary union leader, and didn't use that
responsibility, forsook it. Nevertheless, they were
lied to, more than lying. Their ability was not
that of a Secretary of Defense, and it would be
foolish it seems to me to hold them equally
responsible.

One of the foundations of your faith seems to
be a faith in the people, and if the people have
enough information this may force the President
to act one way or the other. You've mentioned
that the people opposed the bombing of North
Vietnam but by then there was nothing they
could do about it. What has been the role of the
people in our democracy in the last few years,
given that Gallop polls still show that 60 percent
of the people support the President, both in his
war policies and now in his peace policies in
Vietnam?
It's clear that the people, just like the
Congress and executive officials, have not wanted
responsibility and have been glad to shift the
information and the responsibility to the
shoulders of the President. That is the comfort
and the assurance of the institution of the
monarchy. That's why it's in many ways a
comfortable way of government to live with.
You don't have the power, but nobody accuses
you of having the power, so you don't bear the
guilt or the responsibility for policies.
I think it's wrong to believe that the President
was forced by the American people to do what
he's been doing essentially and surely would have
been punished if he had gotten out of the war
sooner. He likes to say that, he likes to believe it,
Nixon does, because it reassures him of what he's
doing; he's following the national will, even if
they won't admit it publicly.
I think the people should be encouraged to
have a greater sense of responsibility as American
citizens to recognize the responsibilities that are
implicit in the amount of real freedom that we
do have left. Not as much as there used to be in
some ways, but it's still very great, compared to
citizens of other countries. That carries with it
the power to change policies and to regard that
as comparably important to the private battles
that we have to face in our lives.
What changes have you observed in the mood
of the country since the November elections?
Specifically, what do you think that the people's
response to Nixon's second term programs is?
How do you think that people are responding to
Nixon's authoritarian treatment of them and
what do you think the people think about the
President's increasing isolation?

I think the release of the papers, along with many other things, made the difference
to the people of Indochina of hundreds of thousands of lives. The bombing didn't
start four years ago, or three years ago, or one year ago but instead was postponed
until after the election and then met such public negative reaction that it was stopped
after 12 days.

I think we are facing a real test of our political
values, and a challenge as to how we want to be
governed and are willing to be governed in the
future. Nixon has in many ways taken the wraps
off various of his own attitudes and his policies,
and presented them considerably more nakedly
than we've seen them in the past. In a sense, the
emperor has taken off his clothes in public view
here, and the question is: "are people going to
react to it or notice it?"
He has acted monarchially in the field of
foreign policy for years but he didn't begin that
by any means. We've really had it since the
Second World War and throughout the Cold War.
I think people were confronted with that very
clearly by this ultimate bombing of Hanoi where
he didn't even bother to give even a phony
explanation of what he was doing or what reason
he had to do for that.
That confronted people with the fact that
Americans at this moment had no more influence
over the policies of their government in
Indochina than the Russian citizens had over the
invasion of Czechoslovakia. I don't think that
they did like that feeling, but at the same time, it
was hard for them to understand how they could
possibly escape from that.
So I think there has been a mood of
impotence, of apathy, passivity, which reflected
not unconcern or indifference really about the
fate of Indochina or of America but really a
feeling that there was nothing they could do
about it. They had a lot of realistic reasons for
thinking that they couldn't do anything about it
after the history of the last 10 years. I think that
he is rather nakedly trying to assert the same
authority in domestic affairs right now, and to
extend this monarchial form to domestic affairs
by bypassing Congress, by ignoring the wishes of
Congress programs by impounding funds, by
really taking away the last authority that
Congress thought it had left — the control over
the budget and over appropriations. I don't sense

much confidence at any level that they know
how to change it or what to do about it.
There really are paths left to us. Nixon is
trying to silence the press, to reduce the
investigative power of the press and of Congress,
but that's a tribute to the fact that there is power
left. There is some degree of independence left.
I'm impressed as someone sitting in a courthouse
now for most of the last year and a half. I*te
learned quite a bit about that process; I've
learned that the executive influences the process
through the choice of judges and the values of
judges much more than I realized. There's less
independence of the three branches than I'd
realized. The ambition of a judge to rise from
one level to the next depends a great deal on the
executive branch and going in accordance with
them.
At the same time, it's very obvious that there
is a lot of independence left, or I'd be in jail right
now, I wouldn't be out on bail, and the many
rulings that have ultimately helped our defense
wouldn't have come about. We wouldn't have
dug information out of the Justice Department
that the Justice Department was actively trying
to conceal. So I'm certainly impressed that there
are democratic powers left to be used.
Again, in our own defense, we wouldn't be
able to make use of those rights and powers if we
didn't have the money to follow up alot of these
points, to make trips to investigate what appear
to be prosecution deceptions, to get affidavits
from people and so forth, and in turn that
money reflects our wide degree of support for
the defense. More than 15,000 people have
contributed to our defense at this point, so that's
not the ordinary case, and it's very clear to me
that someone without that degree of recognition
and support simply wouldn't have that same
chance at equal justice that we do.
Dr. Ellsberg, do you think that the release of
the "Pentagon Papers"shortened the war?
That's hard to say. It wouldn't have had to
shortened it very much to have fully justified the
effort and the individual risk involved, and I do

think undoubtedly that it had that much effect.
[The release] didn't keep him from lying and
escalating, because he did it. But on the other
hand, he delayed doing it. He delayed the
bombing of Hanoi until after the election, and I
think that that is a sign of his awareness of a
public mood that was a real constraint on his
policy. It was a mood, I think, that the
"Pentagon Papers," along with many other
things, did contribute to.
I think it made the difference to the people of
Indochina of hundreds of thousands of lives that
that bombing didn't start four years ago, or three
years ago or one year ago, but that instead it was
postponed until after the election and then met
such public negative reaction that it was stopped
after 12 days.
What would you say the single most
important effect of the "Papers" has been?
I think the effects will have to be felt over the
long run, because they never expected that 7000
pages of information would enter the public
consciousness very widely and very quickly. In
fact, there was perhaps more awareness of their
contents within the first year than 1 would have
expected and that was because of the
government's actions to supress the "Papers." It
dramatized them, and gave people more interest
in the case, so I think that it's in the longer run
that I would expect most effect.
There, I think the effect is in focusing
attention on the problem of executive
usurpation and manipulation, the way that we
have been ruled over the last 25 years, and that
can be described as arrogance, as a form of
contemptuous behavior toward the public, lack
of faith in the public, willingness to deceive and
manipulate to bypass Congress, and to
concentrate power in the executive branch.
I think that the investigations and the
discussion in the issues of war and peace are
enlightened to some degree by what people did
learn from the "Pentagon Papers."
