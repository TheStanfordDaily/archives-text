# Judge Delays Franklin Decision
## 
### 
Superior Court Judge Joseph P. Kelly Friday took under advisement
the University's motion to dismiss the reinstatement suit of fired Assoc.
English Prof. H. Bruce Franklin.
On Oct. 26 the University asked for a summary judgment — a judgment
without a full-dress trial — in its favor from the Santa Clara County
Superior Court in San Jose. Since then, a hearing on the University's
motion has been repeatedly postponed. Kelly, assigned to the case on Feb.
23, postponed the hearing until last Friday to give him time to review the
documents filed.
Postponed once again, the decision may be delayed up to 30 days,
according to the Santa Clara County Superior Court clerk.
He explained, if the court doesn't run into any legal problems bearing
further discussion or another hearing, an order will be made on the
motion, and a written memorandum of the decision will be distributed.
The lawsuit, filed last Aug. 15 by the ACLU on Franklin's behalf, seeks
Franklin's reinstatement with full back pay, court costs, and unspecified
monetary damages.
The Board of Trustees dismissed Franklin Jan. 22, 1972 in a 20-2 vote,
after an Advisory Board finding that "by urging and inciting to illegal
coercion and violence" Franklin had "repeatedly and seriously infringed
upon the rights of others in the University."
The complaint alleges that Franklin's firing resulted from his "political
action and political activity" which are "affirmatively protected by the
guarantees of freedom of speech and assembly" in the U.S. and California
constitutions.
