# Cards Rebound At St. Mary's
## Alumni Trip JV Cagers 
### MARK WHITE 
Unable to take advantage of its
decided height advantage,
Stanford's junior varsity
basketball team lost its first game
in eight outings Friday to the
crafty Alumni squad 85-78, but
came back Saturday to outshoot
St. Mary's 90-78 and bring their
record to 13-7.
Bob Nicholson, the JV interim
coach and a 1972 graduate
himself, probably best summed up
the loss to the Alums.
"With an intelligent, quick
team like the Alumni, we should
have taken control of the boards

and won. But they counteracted
our height advantage by playing
an intelligent game â€” knocking
the ball away from our big men,
controlling the tempo of the game
and using their quickness on
offense to score."
Alums Winded
Friday's game opened with
both teams employing a fast pace,
and since the JV's were in better
shape, this worked to the Cards'
advantage. Jumping off to an 11-4
lead, the JV's left the Alums
gasping for breath and threatened
to blow the grads off the court.
However, the Alums began to
screen out Ed Schweitzer and
Kevin Enright under the boards
and behind the shooting of Mai
McElwain, who was high scorer
with 25 points, the Old Guard
crept back to lead 38-36 at the
half, when Stan Dowson hit from
the corner nine seconds before the
buzzer sounded.
The Cards were cold at the
start of the second half and by the
time Mike Kehrli finally scored
their first points of the half at
16:30, the Alums had reeled off
10 straight points. Nothing went
right for the Cards for the first 10
minutes of the second half and
had it not been for Kehrli's eight
points during this period, the JV's
would have been blown off the
court.
McElwain's 23rd point of the
evening gave the Alums a 14 point
lead with five and a half minutes
to go. Enright and Marty Moroski
then combined for nine straight
Stanford points and brought the
Cards closer than they had been
since halftime. But Art Harris cut
the Card rally short, leading an
Alumni string of seven points in
reply and with only a minute left
and down by 12, the Cards
succumbed to their first loss in a
month. Enright was high scorer
for the JV's with 19, while
Schweitzer and Kehrli had 13
apiece.
Schweitzer Dominates
In what Nicholson termed "his

best all-round game of the
season," Schweitzer dominated
Saturday's win over St. Mary's by
scoring 38 points, blocking eight
shots and grabbing 20 rebounds.
Since they arrived in Moraga
only 15 minutes before the game
was to start, the Cards started
slowly against the Gaels, but shot
over 50 percent for the half and
took a 50-45 halftime lead.
Stanford's offense continued
to produce in the second period
and the Cards took a 12 point
lead at the 10 minute mark. But
Stanford's defense began to fail
and St. Mary's came back to lead
with eight minutes remaining in
the game.
Schweitzer re-exerted himself
minutes later and when Steve
Kristovitch completed a three
point play at 6:30, the Cards had
regained their lead and went on to
win 90-78. Moroski, Kehrli and
Rich Wohlstadter all scored in
double figures to complement
Schweitzer's 38 point effort.
