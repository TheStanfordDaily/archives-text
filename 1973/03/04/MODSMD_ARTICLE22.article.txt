# Stanford Fourth In Pac-8 Swimming
## 
### MIKE CHASSON 
SANTA MONICA - The Stanford
swimming team finished a
disappointing fourth in the
Pacific-Eight Championships
despite fine individual
performances by John Hencken
and Brian Job.
Southern California won top
honors for the second year in a
row with 473 1 /2 points followed
by UCLA 375, Washington 311V4,
Stanford California 183V&,
Oregon 158, Oregon State 88, and
Washington State 44.
Hencken, a freshman from
Cupertino, paced the Cardinals by
placing in three individual events
and swimming the breastroke leg
on Stanford's second place 400
medley relay.
On the first night in the 200

individual medley he placed
fourth in a very fast race which
saw the first two finishers break
the Pacific-Eight record. He
clocked 1.56.4 to the winner's
1.55.3. Later that evening he
swam on the medley relay which
finished second to USC, 3.28.0 to
3.28.8.
Conference Record
The next night in the 100
breastroke he defeated the fastest
field in Pacific-Eight history to set
a new conference record of 57.7,
breaking the old mark of 57.9 set
by Job last year. He completed his
weekend the next night by
finishing second to Job in the 200
breastroke in a lifetime best of
2.05.5.
Job, who was the defending
champion in the 100 and 200

breastroke, lost his 100 title to
Hencken but still finished second
in 58.3. In the 200 yard event he
held off his fast-closing teammate
to notch a 2.05.4 victory. Job and
Hencken still rank one-two in the
country in the breastroke events
going into the NCAA
Championships.
Sophomore Dean Anderson
and freshman Bruce Goodwin led
Stanford's scoring in the sprints.
Anderson finished third in the 50
freestyle in 21.5 and sixth in the
100 in 47.6, while Goodwin
received fourth in the 50 with a
21.6 and won the consolation
finals in the 100 to receive
seventh in 47.5.
Randy Whitchurch scored in
both backstroke events despite
suffering from a bad cold. The
talented sophomore finished fifth
in the 100 backstroke in 53.8 and
fourth in the 200 backstroke in
1.57.0. He also led off the second
place medley relay.
Junior Terry Sutton led a good
showing by the Cardinal's distance
swimmers. Sutton came close to
his lifetime best in the 500 free to
place ninth in 4.40.5, while
turning in another near lifetime
best in the 1650 free to place
seventh in 16.15.7. The field in
the 500 and 1650 was the fastest
ever with most of the point
scorers expected to score in the

NCAA championships.
In the freestyle relays Stanford
placed fifth in the 800 yard relay
with the team of Richard Cook,
Goodwin, Anderson, and Ron
Longinotti going 7.10.1 to the
winner UCLA's 6.48.8.
In the 400 yard relay the team
of Martin Pedley, Steve Carey,
Anderson, and Goodwin recorded
a season best time of 3.08.4 to
finish fourth behind Cal's 3.06.9.
Goodwin led off the relay with a
lifetime best of 47.2, while Pedley
had the fastest split with 46.5.
The meet was disappointing to
coach Jim Gaughran in the respect
he was hoping the team could
beat out Washington for third
place. He was pleased, however,
that many of the swimmers
recorded season and lifetime bests
at the meet.
The team was hampered by the
fact that numerous members were
sick to varying degrees all during
the three day meet. Many of the
swimmers who placed high in this
meet, however, should be able to
score well in the NCAA
Championships later this month.

DRIVING FOR TWO — Marty Moroski drives toward the hoop last
weekend during Stanford's junior varsity victory over UC Davis.
Moroski, who also played on the junior varsity football team this fall,
played well this weekend as Stanford lost to the Alumni on Friday
night but came back to defeat St. Mary's on Saturday.
