# Spikers Splash To Easy Opening Win
## 
### PHIL HUBBARD 
The Stanford track team
splashed its way to an impressive
128-31 victory over Fresno State
in the season opener Saturday
afternoon at Stanford stadium. A
crowd of nearly 200 braved the
cloudbursts to see the Cards take
their 21st consecutive win over
the Bulldogs.
Despite the adverse conditions,
two Stanford frosh records and
one meet record were broken.
Terry Albritton demolished the
old freshman shot put standard of
56'5". His first throw of the day,
which turned out to be the
winning toss, went 57"ll 3 /4".
Tony Sandoval couldn't quite
crack the nine minute barrier in
the two mile, but still broke the
old frosh record of 9:04.4 as he
won the event in 9:01.6.
Sophomore Kurt Schoenrock
wiped out the meet record of
9:49.2 in the steeplechase,
crossing the finish line in 9:32.6.
Dick Day also broke the old
record as he came in second at
9:45.4.

The meet got off to a good
start when Wes Reynolds won the
hammer throw at 134'7".
Decathlete Kenny Kring followed
with a 22'2 3 /4" long jump victory,
leading one of the Cards' three
sweeps in the competition.
Stanford had a strong lead in
the 440 relay, and when Fresno
dropped the baton on their last
handoff the victory was certain.
The team of Ken Curl, John
Kessel, Dave Bagshaw, and John
Anderson was timed in 41.7.
Steve Hopkins took the javelin
with a 209'6" toss despite a
slippery runway. Brian
Mittelstaedt and Les McFadden
were 1-2 in the mile at 4:14.8 and
4:14.9 respectively. Mittelstaedt
was also second in the two mile at
9:04.2 behind Sandoval. Mark
McConnell completed the sweep,
taking third at 9:13.8.
Dave Bagshaw continued his
mastery of the high hurdles as he
took the event in 14.4. Co-captain
John Anderson won the 440 in
48.6. Ken Curl took care of the
other sprints, winning the 100 in
10.0 and the 220 in 22.0.
In the intermediate hurdles,
freshman Matt Hogsett was the
winner with an excellent time of
53.0. Vemell Jackson just nosed
out teammate Bruce Wolfe in the
880 to win it for the Cards in
1:57.4.
Mike Hall triple-jumped to a
45'614" victory over Derek
Tolliver taking second at 45'4 3 /4".
In the discus, Jim Howard
managed a 165'10" toss for the
victory.
The only event the Cards lost
was the high jump. Competing in
the worst possible conditions for
that event, with standing water on
the runway, Fresno's Jeral
Richardson beat out Tom
Anderson at 6'2" on the basis of
fewer misses.
Chuck Harwood led the
Stanford vaulters at 13'0" in the
third sweep of the meet for the
Cards. In the mile relay, the final
event of the meet, the team of
John Kessel, Vernell Jackson,
Dave Bagshaw, and John
Anderson bumed the Fresno
squad 3:19.0 to 3:26.5.
Stanford will host San Jose
State in a dual meet next
Saturday in the Stanford stadium
beginning at 1:15.
