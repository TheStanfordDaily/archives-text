# Rugby Team Axed By Tough California Side
## 
### PETE BHATIA 
The Stanford Rugby Team
absorbed one of its worst defeats
of the year this weekend at the
hands of the highly touted
University of California team
18-3. The game, played on a
muddy Stanford Rugby field, was
basically all California as the Bears
opened an 8-3 margin at halftime
and coasted in from there.
The Bears scored on four tries
and a penalty kick while the only
score the Cards could muster
came on a conversion by Greg
Lichtenstein. Despite the one
sidedness of the score Stanford
coach Pete Kmetovic said, "We
played pretty well, but in crucial
situations we weren't able to
control the ball."

Kmetovic commented that
Stanford's big problem is the lack
of a confident fullback. Kmetovic
tried to make up for that
deficiency by moving Tom Klein,
the team's most experienced
player, to the fullback position
against the Bears. Next week,
however, Kmetovic said he will
return to the usual lineup with
Klein at his normal forward
position.
The two teams meet again at
California this Saturday to
determine the winner of the Big
Scrum Axe. The winner is decided
by the combined points in the
two games. Thus, if Stanford is to
win the Scrum Axe they must top
the Bears by 16 points Saturday
in Berkeley.
