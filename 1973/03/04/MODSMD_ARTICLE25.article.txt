# Cards Scare Bruins Before Losing 51-45 Thriller
## Victory Over USC Assures First Winning Record In Six Seasons 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
LOS ANGELES — For a while it looked like
Stanford might make college basketball history
Saturday night.
But when the Cards returned to the floor after
stunning UCLA with an inspired first half
performance, a frenzied Pauley Pavilion crowd and
costly Cardinal turnovers erased Stanford's 25-18
halftime lead. When it was all over the Bruins had a
51-45 victory, their 70th straight in a seemingly
endless streak.
Still, the disappointing finish couldn't tarnish
Stanford's most productive basketball weekend in
recent memory. Besides giving UCLA its biggest
scare of the "Walton Era," the Cards upset USC
50-47 Friday night, assuring Stanford of its first
winning season since 1966.
Saturday's near miss began with a first half in
which Stanford unquestionably outplayed the
nation's number one team. The Cards connected on
11 of their 22 shots while holding the Bruins to
seven field goals in 22 attempts. Rich Kelley led
Stanford to a convincing board advantage, grabbing
seven caroms as the Cards outrebounded the Bruins
19-12.
Wern't Sharp
"In the first half we just wern't sharp," said
UCLA coach John Wooden. "At least four of our
passes were off the finger tips. We only shot 30
percent whereas we're shooting over 50 percent for
the season. And I thought we were getting pretty
good shots.
Of course UCLA's uncharacteristic ineptness was
only part of the story. Stanford confused the Bruins
by alternating between man to man and a
combination of zone defenses, a tactic UCLA guard
Greg Lee called "the most intelligent defense we've
faced this year."
And the Cards executed the various defenses to
perfection, holding the Bruins to their lowest first
half point total of the season and eventually to their
lowest game output of the year.
UCLA's student body presented Wooden with a
trophy commemorating his 25th year at UCLA at
halftime and a standing ovation ignited the
previously stunned crowd of 12,489.
Responding to the deafening cheers from its
student section, UCLA scored twice in the first 30
seconds of the second half, first on Hollyfield's
layup on a pass from Walton, and then on Lee's
layup following the first of 14 second half Stanford
turnovers.
Kelley put the Cards back on top by five with a
layup 30 seconds later, but after two scores by
Walton, Coach Howie Dallmar ordered a delay game
with Stanford leading 27-26.
The strategy paid off immediately as Kelley
caught the Bruins off guard with a perfect back
door pass to Mel Arterberry for a layup.
A minute later Stanford's momentum was
crushed, however, as the referees allowed an obvious
dunk by Larry Farmer. Keith Wilkes put the Bruins
in front for the first time of the half with two free
throws at the 14:57 mark, and UCLA gradually
pulled away.
UCLA went to a 3-1-1 zone trap defense to

combat the Cards' semi-stall, the first time this year
Wooden has gone to a zone defense.
"Actually we were glad to see the zone," Dallmar
said, "but we just weren't hitting. We missed Dave
Frost (out with a sprained ankle). He's our best
outside shooter."
Walton finished the game with 23 points to lead
all scorers while Kelley paced Stanford with 15.
Kelley outrebounded Walton 15-10, however, and
held his own at both ends of the court with the
Bruin All-American.
Arterberry added 10 and Trobbe eight for the
Cards, while Farmer was the only other Bruin in
double figures with eight points. Stanford finished
with a 31-29 rebounding edge and shot 47.7 percent
to UCLA's 39.2, but the Cards were outscored 11-3
from the foul line and attempted seven less shots
than the Bruins.
The night before at the slightly bigger but less
awe-inspiring Sports Arena, Stanford used 10
straight points late in the second half to record a
50-47 victory over USC.
Stanford turned in one of its sloppier first half
performances (15 turnovers, .340 shooting
percentage) but the Cards showed exceptional poise
in the second half.
Stanford took the lead for the first time at 42-41
when Mike Mann took a perfect lob pass from
Kelley for a layup with 4:22 remaining. A tip-in by
Trobbe, two clutch free throws by Arterberry, and a
layup by Mark Gilberg put the Cards in front by
seven with 58 seconds remaining and Stanford held
on for a 50-47 victory.
Dallmar was extremely pleased with the victory,
which gave Stanford its first winning season in six
years. "We could have been blown out in the first
half," he said, "but we regrouped and played well in
the second half.
Key Blocks
"Mike's blocks were really key plays," Dallmar
added, referring to four shot rejections by the 6-9
forward, including two on one play when he
blocked a shot by 6-10 Mike Westra and then
rejected Clint Chapman's attempt on the rebound.
Mann added 12 points and nine rebounds to his
defensive heroics in one of his finest games of the
season.
Arterberry, playing before his hometown Los
Angeles fans, also had one of his best nights. The
6-3 sophomore guard grabbed 10 rebounds and
scored 11 points, including the two crucial free
throws in the final minutes.
Mann and Gilberg led the Stanford scoring with
12 points each, while Kelley was held to a season
low of five. Kelley had 14 rebounds, however, and
made up for his 1-9 shooting performance with
some key passes and defensive plays in the stretch.
Stanford is now 13-11 for the season and 6-7 in
Pac-8 play. The Cards will close out their season
Friday night at Maples Pavilion against California. It
will be the final game for seniors Bob Buell and Pat
Rusco, but it looks like just the beginning for
Stanford's tall and talented sophomores.
Just ask UCLA.

REJECTION — UCLA's Bill Walton got a hand on this shot by Rich
Kelley, but Stanford's seven-footer returned the favor later in the
game during Saturday night's classic battle between the two giants.
Walton outscored Kelley 23-15 but Kelley had a 15-10 rebounding
edge.

UNTOUCHED — Keith Wilkes, Dave Meyers, Larry Farmer and over
12,000 spectators at Pauley Pavilion watched this lay up by Mike
Mann. Mann's strong first half performance helped spark Stanford to a
25-18 halftime lead, but UCLA eventually prevailed, 51-45.
