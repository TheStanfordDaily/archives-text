# Card Players Defeated In City Golf Tourney
## 
### 
Stanford golfers dominated the 1972 San Francisco City Golf
Championships, but there are no Cardinal players left after the second
round of this year's tourney.
Bruce Robertson, Conrad Nilmeier, and Bob Chapman all suffered
first round defeats Saturday at Harding Park, while Dave Baskins
waited until Sunday's second round to make his exit. Baskins defeated
Skip Thompson four and three in his first round match but lost to
Warren Jones three and two in the second round.
Robertson's loss was particularly surprising since the sophomore
from San Mateo was last year's runnerup and reached the semifinals
the year before. Robertson absorbed a solid thrashing, however, losing
four and three to Scott Hoyt, the number-one man at UC Santa

Barbara.
Baskins was all even with Jones
after 11 holes Sunday, but he lost
the next three holes and never
really had a chance after that. The
12th hole was particularly
demoralizing for Baskins. He was
lying three, six inches away from
the hole as his opponent hit his
third shot from just off the green.
Jones' ball was headed well past
the pin, but it hit Baskins' ball
and bounced into the cup for a
birdie three.
Baskins felt that the freak shot
on 12 and his inability to judge
distances were the key factors in
the match. "I hit the ball pretty
well," he said, "but I just had
trouble judging distances.
"Since we've been playing
temporary greens at Stanford
lately because of the rain, I think
we all had trouble judging
distances when we hit to the real
greens at Harding."
The Cards will be hitting to
real, plush greens tomorrow when
Stanford competes in the 36 hole
Cal State Hayward Tournament at
Silverado. Silverado is annually
the site of the Kaiser International
Tournament and this year the,
qualifying for the PGA tour was
held there.
