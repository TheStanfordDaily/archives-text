# Controversial Reagan Nominee
## Panel Confirms Clark Nomination 
### 
The controversial nomination of Stanford alumnus
William P. Clark Jr. to the State Supreme Court was
confirmed Saturday by a three-member panel considering
his qualifications. The vote was 2-1.
Clark, currently a state appellate judge, came under fire
when it was disclosed that he did not have a college
degree, flunked out of Loyola Law School, and flunked
the state bar exam on his first attempt. In addition, the
Daily disclosed Friday that Clark had been suspended
from Stanford and had dropped out in 1951 while on
academic probation.
State Atty. Gen. Evelle Younger and Court of Appeal
Judge Parker Wood voted to confirm Clark's nomination;
Supreme Court Chief Justice Donald Wright opposed it.
Clark was Gov. Ronald Reagan's executive secretary
before being named a San Luis Obispo County Superior
Court judge in 1967. He was elevated to the appellate
bench in 1971, and Reagan nominated him to the high
court following the death of Associate Justice Raymond
Peters Jan. 2.
The investigative commission heard two days of
testimony — most of it favorable to Clark — in San
Francisco before making its decision. Among those
testifying was Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare

Caspar Weinberger, who said that opponents of Clark were
taking "a narrow and snobbish view."
Wright said of his dissenting vote, "I sincerely hope
that I will be proved to be wrong, and if such occurs, I
shall be the first to acknowledge my mistake." He
admitted that the decision was difficult "because he will
become a member of our court, [and] we will be working
together on a daily basis."
There had been charges that the investigative
commission might be loaded in favor of Clark because had
he not been confirmed, he would have remained on the
same bench with Wood. This, it was alleged, would make
it difficult for Wood to oppose him. Also, it was charged
that Younger, a Republican, might be reluctant to oppose
a Republican governor's nominee.
Opposition to the Clark nomination came from several
groups, including the California Trial Lawyers'
Association and law school faculties at University of
California campuses in Berkeley, Los Angeles, and San
Francisco.
The last high court nominee to be rejected was a
UC-Berkeley law professor in 1942 who allegedly held
communist sympathies.
