Indians To Leave Wounded Knee
WOUNDED KNEE, S.D. — The Justice Department
announced Sunday night it has agreed to allow Indians
holding Wounded Knee to leave the village without threat
of mass arrests, beginning today.
The peace proposal stipulated that the Indians
surrender their weapons, and that all males identify
themselves to federal agents as they leave the village.
The federal authorities will remove the 150 lawmen
surrounding Wounded Knee once all nonresidents of the
village have departed, said Ralph Erickson, a special
assistant to the U.S. attorney general and the senior
federal official at the Pine Ridge Reservation.
The proposal meets one of the Indian demands that no
mass arrests be made without grand jury indictments. But
the Indians also had proposed Saturday night that the
federal marshals and FBI agents withdraw prior to the
Indian evacuation.
The takeover by a group of 200 Indians occurred
Tuesday night. Eleven persons were held hostage until
noon Thursday, and there was a sporadic but persistent
exchange of gunfire from Wednesday until Saturday.
Military Panel Sessions Suspended
SAIGON — The North Vietnamese and Viet Cong
suspended future sessions of the four-party Joint Military
Commission today in a dispute over the exchange of
Vietnamese prisoners.
The Communist delegations said they would attend no
further sessions with the United States and South
Vietnam until the Saigon government raises the number of
prisoners it will release from 3000 to at least 5000 in the
second round of POW exchanges.
Meanwhile, American planes sped off to Hanoi today
to pick up 34 more prisoners of war being freed by the
Viet Cong. At Clark AFB, Philippines, 106 American
POWs and two mysterious Thais released by North
Vietnam a day earlier enjoyed their first day of freedom
in as long as seven years.
The release of this group of POWs originally had been
expected last Tuesday, but was set back nearly a week due
to a squabble over implementation of terms of the
cease-fire agreement.
Allende Impeachment Margin Fails
SANTIAGO, Chile — A massive turnout of Chilean voters
yesterday left the opposition in control of Congress but
without enough clout to threaten Marxist President
Salvador Allende with impeachment.
The opposition had hoped for a two-thirds majority in
the Senate — the necessary margin for impeachment — as
a lever to force Allende's government toward more
moderate economic policies.
With 35 percent of the vote counted, opposition
candidates had a percentage lead of 54 to 44 in the lower
House of Deputies and 57 to 41 in the Senate.
The other percentage points were accounted for by a
small party of the far left and by spoiled ballots.
Chile's economic troubles under Allende were the focal
point of the election.
Foreign Money Exchanges Close
BRUSSELS — Common Market finance ministers decided
yesterday night to close their money exchanges all week

and call a meeting of major trading nations in Paris to plan
a solution of the monetary crisis.
Closing foreign exchanges took the pressure off
European central banks that were forced to support the
dollar last week by buying up billions at the newly
devalued rate.
The moves also gave Common Market nations
additional time to solve the crisis without formally
floating their currencies — cutting them loose from the
official exchange rates in effect since President Nixon
devalued the dollar Feb. 12 by 10 percent.
A final decision may be delayed by the French
elections.
Nixon, who twice has been forced to devalue the
dollar, vowed last week there won't be a third time. But a
Common Market float, allowing European currencies to
increase their dollar value in a reflection of trade
positions, could have nearly the same effect.
Gaullists Need Coalition
PARIS — French voters apparently brought an end
yesterday to the era of absolute Gaullist rule over
parliament in the first national election since the death of
Gen. Charles de Gaulle.
A Communist-Socialist drive to capture a majority in
the new National Assembly was falling short of its mark.
However, Gaullist strength appears sufficiently weakened
to force a parliamentary coalition.
Incomplete results covering 26 million of the 30
million registered voters gave the political groups in the
government coalition 38.1 percent of the total vote, down
from the 44 percent they got in the first round of the
1968 legislative elections.
Under the French system, candidates getting a first
round absolute majority were declared elected. Where no
candidate got a majority, a second vote will be held next
Sunday with the seat going to the top man.
Nixon Presents Urban Bill
WASHINGTON — President Nixon yesterday urged
enactment of a $2.3 billion Better Communities Act to
replace urban programs that he said had failed.
The President also recommended that state and local
governments "be given the right to use a designated
portion of the highway trust fund for capital
improvements in urban public transportation, including
improvements in bus and rapid rail systems."
"In the field of housing," he said, "we must stop
programs that have been turning the federal government
into a nation-wide slumlord. One of my highest domestic
priorities this year will be the development of new policies
that eliminate waste and target aid to genuinely needy
families."
Nixon said the new federal budget would eliminate
seven urban development programs he described as
outmoded and suspend four housing programs he labeled
ineffective.
Today's Weather
Increasing cloudiness with showers likely this morning.
Partial clearing this afternoon with a chance of showers
and a chance of showers tonight and tomorrow. A little
warmer. Lows tonight in the 40s. Highs today in the
upper 50s and tomorrow into the low 60s. Chance of rain
50 percent today and 30 percent tonight.
