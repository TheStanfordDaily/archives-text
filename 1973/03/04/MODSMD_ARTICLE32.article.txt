# Biz Students Provide Tax Aid
## 
### 
Members of the Chicano Business
Students' Association at the Graduate
School of Business went out into the
East Palo Alto community this
weekend to help Spanish-speaking
families with their federal and state
income tax returns.
The group of 13 students plan to
continue their efforts for at least the
next three weekends. "Whether we
extend the project or not depends on
how many people need help," said
Robert Cano, president of the
association. The deadline for filing
income tax returns is April 15.
The idea originated last year when
Chicano students worked through the
Business School to help people with
their tax forms. "The program was
aimed primarily at aiding students,"
said Gary Andazola, director of this
year's project.
"One of the Chicano Students'
Association's goals is to do something
for the community," explained
Andazola. This year, the group of
business students is working at St.
Francis of Assisi Church on Bay Road
in East Palo Alto.
Saturday, students worked with
five Spanish speaking people at the
Church. "If we can get better
advertising through the church
newsletter, there is a good chance that
we will have a better turnout next
weekend," said Andola.

Andazola, who has worked for the
Internal Revenue service, said that the
biggest area of confusion for most
people who fill out their tax returns is
deductions. "Many of the people we
helped did not have the specific
information needed to itemize their
deductions," he explained.
From 9 am. to 1 p.m. every
Saturday and Sunday for the next

month, students will be available at
the church to help with income tax
returns. "Our target group is the
Spanish-speaking people," said Cano.
The graduate students are working
in conjunction with another
community organization called
Proyecto Ayuda (Project Help) which
sponsored a Barrio Food Drive last
year.
