# McCloskey: 'Papers' Not Harmful
## 
### ED KOHN Special to the Daily 
LOS ANGELES - Rep. Paul N.
McCloskey Jr. (R.-Portola Valley)
testified Friday at the "Pentagon
Papers" trial that the release of one
volume of the top-secret study was
embarrassing — but not injurious — to
the United States.
McCloskey, the second defense
witness, told the jury that the release
of the volume, entitled "Marine
Combat Units Go To Dan Nang In
1965," demonstrates "the blunders of
which the American military system is
capable."
"But," he added, "its release did
not damage the national interest."
Defendants Daniel Ellsberg and
Anthony J. Russo Jr. are charged with
duplicating and releasing 18 volumes
of the "Papers" and a small portion of
another top-secret study. If convicted,
each could receive a lengthy prison
sentence.
No Harmful Information
McCloskey, a former Marine,
repeatedly stated that the release of
the study would not have aided a
foreign nation. He characterized the
volume as a command decision study
that contains "nothing that was not
known to a foreign country
immediately after the troops landed."
McCloskey, who challenged
President Nixon in the New Hampshire
presidential primary last year where he

received 20 percent of the vote, was
presented by the defense as a
government classification expert. He is
chairman of the House Subcommittee
on Foreign Operations and
Government Information.
That subcommittee is presently
studying alleged abuses in the
government's security classification
system and earlier conducted hearings
on the "Pentagon Papers."
No Top Secret Clearance
Looking extremely earnest and
leaning slightly forward in his chair,
McCloskey testified that he has never
been cleared for "Top Secret" material
despite his long military career.
Nonetheless, he said he began to read
the "Papers" in May, 1971, several
weeks before excerpts began appearing
in the New York Times. He was not

asked, nor did he explain, how he was
given the studies.
A Congressman since 1967,
McCloskey recently gave up his reserve
commission as a lieutenant colonel in
the Marine Corps. McCloskey testified
that he was trained in intelligence and
served as a counter-insurgency school
instructor.

See page five for a full-page interview
with Daniel Ellsberg.

He is expected to complete his
testimony when the trial resumes ths
morning.
Laßocque Testimony
Earlier in the week, retired Navy
Rear Admiral Gene Laßocque testified
that the release of two other volumes

from the "Papers" as well as a segment
of a third top-secret study would not
have harmed the national defense in
1969, the time period specified in the
13-count indictment.
Prosecutor David Nissen spent more
than a day attempting to discredit
Laßocque's testimony, but appeared
to meet with little success.
However, presiding Judge Matt
Byrne Jr. did allow Nissen to question
Laßocque about a large binder of
notes apparently used by the defense
to prepare its witnesses. Laßocque
admitted that he had read "portions"
of the material before his testimony,
but insisted that he had formed his
opinions about the nature of the
"Papers" before he flew here to
testify.
