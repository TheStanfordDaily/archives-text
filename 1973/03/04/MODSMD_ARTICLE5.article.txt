# Former Pentagon Aide Takes New Medical Center Position
## 
### BILL EVERS 
Since Monday, Feb. 26, a new assistant vice president
for medical affairs has been on the job at the Medical
Center. Peter F. Carpenter has returned to Stanford
(where he was assistant director of the Center for
Materials Research from 1968 through 1970) after a stint
in Washington, D.C.
Carpenter brings to his new job of management and
planning at the Medical Center both an academic
background in management and organizational theory and
extensive practical administrative experience in both the
civil service of the federal government and the U.S. armed
forces.
While an officer in the Air Force, Carpenter was a part
of Project Agile, a research and development (R&D)
program administered by the Overseas Defense Research
office of the Department of Defense's Advanced Research
Projects Agency (ARPA).
Project Agile
At a 1968 hearing before the House Subcommittee on
Defense Appropriations, Director of Defense Research
and Engineering John S. Foster, Jr., described Project
Agile as:
"A broad program in applied research and development
through which ARPA examines problems of multiservice
and multigovernment interest and application in the fields
of counterinsurgency and limited conflict.
"It provides friendly nations of the developing areas
with better ways of organizing their own resources to
counter insurgent threats...
According to Michael T. Klare's 1972 book on
American military planning, "historically, Agile has
concentrated on surveillance systems and related
'electronic battlefield' devices to reduce the manpower
requirements for counterguerrilla operations in remote
areas, and on the modifications of basic infantry
equipment for use in extreme environmental situations.
"Agile has also developed specialized equipment for
non-Western troops when standard G.I. issue was
inappropriate or inadequate. In the area of behavioral

research, Agile has sponsored research on ethnic
minorities living in strategic areas (for example, the
Montagnards of South Vietnam), and on the development
of strategic doctrine . ..
Washington, Saigon Duties
When Carpenter was working on Project Agile, his duty
station was Washington, D.C., but he had liaison duties
with Project Agile's Saigon office and its Bangkok office,
called Research and Development Field Offices. Carpenter
told the Daily, in a recent interview, that typically he
would spend one month in Saigon and the next in
Washington.
In this work for the Department of Defense,
Carpenter's assignments included trying to improve the
recovery rate in rescue operations aimed at bringing back
American airmen shot down over North Vietnam, and
staying for a time with a Special Forces unit on the
Cambodian border.
Part of Carpenter's job with ARPA was attending
special summer seminars conducted in conjunction with
such agencies as the Jason Division of the Institute for
Defense Analyses. These events were an effort to include
leading American scientists in problem-solving on
Vietnam.
One such seminar is described in the New York Times'
edition of the "Pentagon papers." There scientists
evaluated the U.S. bombing program and suggested that a
form of the proposed McNamara wall across Vietnam be
set up. To detect guerrilla forces, the scientists
recommended an "electronic battlefield" triggered by
acoustic sensors.
These experiences in the management of research and
development on subjects related to Vietnam and Thailand
formed a basis for a lecture Carpenter gave in 1969, after
he had left the Air Force.
He was at that time managing the Center for Materials
Research at Stanford (then the single biggest recipient of
Defense funds at Stanford, funds granted by ARPA).
Carpenter was a guest lecturer at the Naval War College in
Rhode Island on research and development problems
associated with Vietnam.
Before joining ARPA in the office of the Secretary of
Defense, Carpenter had been with the 19th Air Force in
Goldsboro, North Carolina. This was an outfit which,
according to Carpenter, developed contingency plans for
the Air Force's role in possible conflicts overseas.
It also did operational planning for NATO war games.
Before this, Carpenter had been paid by the Air Force to
study research and development management at
University of Chicago Business School.
Before getting his master's degree at Chicago,
Carpenter was a program manager at the Air Force
Weapons Laboratory at Kirtland Air Force Base in New
Mexico. According to the DMS Market Intelligence
Report, this laboratory specializes in "research programs
in the areas of weapons effects, kill mechanisms, radiation
hazards, and delivery techniques."
For a brief period, just before he left the Air Force,
Carpenter was an Air Force aide at the White House,
working with the White House Office on Science and
Technology.
Here, according to Carpenter, his technical training (he
had chemistry as his major field as an undergraduate at

Harvard) and field experience in Southeast Asia were
useful in providing liaison with the Pentagon on military
matters being studied by the President's Scientific
Advisory Committees.
After leaving the Pentagon, Carpenter continued to be
associated with ARPA as a consultant. He also became,
over the years, a consultant to Lockheed; the Department
of Health, Education, and Welfare; and the White House
Office on Science and Technology.
From 1968 to 1970, Carpenter combined graduate
work at Stanford's Business School on organizational
behavior with administrative work at the Center for
Materials Research. Then, he became a vice-president in an
independent consulting firm.
In 1971, Carpenter re-entered government service by
joining the White House Office of Management and
Budget. According to Carpenter, his job there as director
of the Federal Assistance Review Board's management
team was to "increase the rationality of the delivery
systems" whereby federal funds were going to state and
local governments.
Then, in 1972, Carpenter was named deputy executive
director of the Price Commission. In this capacity, he
assisted in supervising the day-to-day activities of the
600-person staff of the price control component of
Nixon's economic controls apparatus.
