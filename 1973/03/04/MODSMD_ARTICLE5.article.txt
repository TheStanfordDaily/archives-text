# Former Pentagon Aide Takes New Medical Center Position
## 
### BILL EVERS 
Since Monday, Feb. 26, a new assistant vice president
for medical affairs has been on the job at the Medical
Center. Peter F. Carpenter has returned to Stanford
(where he was assistant director of the Center for
Materials Research from 1968 through 1970) after a stint
in Washington, D.C.
Carpenter brings to his new job of management and
planning at the Medical Center both an academic
background in management and organizational theory and
extensive practical administrative experience in both the
civil service of the federal government and the U.S. armed
forces.
While an officer in the Air Force, Carpenter was a part
of Project Agile, a research and development (R&D)
program administered by the Overseas Defense Research
office of the Department of Defense's Advanced Research
Projects Agency (ARPA).
Project Agile
At a 1968 hearing before the House Subcommittee on
Defense Appropriations, Director of Defense Research
and Engineering John S. Foster, Jr., described Project
Agile as:
"A broad program in applied research and development
through which ARPA examines problems of multiservice
and multigovernment interest and application in the fields
of counterinsurgency and limited conflict.
"It provides friendly nations of the developing areas
with better ways of organizing their own resources to
counter insurgent threats...
According to Michael T. Klare's 1972 book on
American military planning, "historically, Agile has
concentrated on surveillance systems and related
'electronic battlefield' devices to reduce the manpower
requirements for counterguerrilla operations in remote
areas, and on the modifications of basic infantry
equipment for use in extreme environmental situations.
"Agile has also developed specialized equipment for
non-Western troops when standard G.I. issue was
inappropriate or inadequate. In the area of behavioral

research, Agile has sponsored research on ethnic
minorities living in strategic areas (for example, the
Montagnards of South Vietnam), and on the development
of strategic doctrine . ..
Washington, Saigon Duties
When Carpenter was working on Project Agile, his duty
station was Washington, D.C., but he had liaison duties
with Project Agile's Saigon office and its Bangkok office,
called Research and Development Field Offices. Carpenter
told the Daily, in a recent interview, that typically he
would spend one month in Saigon and the next in
Washington.
In this work for the Department of Defense,
Carpenter's assignments included trying to improve the
recovery rate in rescue operations aimed at bringing back
American airmen shot down over North Vietnam, and
staying for a time with a Special Forces unit on the
Cambodian border.
Part of Carpenter's job with ARPA was attending
special summer seminars conducted in conjunction with
such agencies as the Jason Division of the Institute for
Defense Analyses. These events were an effort to include
leading American scientists in problem-solving on
Vietnam.
One such seminar is described in the New York Times'
edition of the "Pentagon papers." There scientists
evaluated the U.S. bombing program and suggested that a
form of the proposed McNamara wall across Vietnam be
set up. To detect guerrilla forces, the scientists
recommended an "electronic battlefield" triggered by
acoustic sensors.
These experiences in the management of research and
development on subjects related to Vietnam and Thailand
formed a basis for a lecture Carpenter gave in 1969, after
he had left the Air Force.
He was at that time managing the Center for Materials
Research at Stanford (then the single biggest recipient of
Defense funds at Stanford, funds granted by ARPA).
Carpenter was a guest lecturer at the Naval War College in
