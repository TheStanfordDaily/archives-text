See how they run.
Almost as soon as the lackluster
1972 Presidential election was over,
state politicos of both parties began
sizing up their prospects for the 1974
state races. Although all statewide
offices and one U.S. Senate seat are up
for re-election, the race attracting the
most interest — as well as the most
participants — will be for the
governorship.
Already, no fewer than 10 members
of both parties have expressed interest
in the chair being vacated by
Republican Gov. Ronald Reagan, who
has said he will not be a candidate for
a third term. Among the Republicans,
the main contenders appear to be
former Lt. Gov. Robert Finch, state
Controller Houston I. Flournoy, Lt.
Gov. Ed Reinecke, and state Atty.
Gen. Evelie J. Younger.
Finch, 47, may well be the
frontrunner at this early stage of the

race. He is the only prospective GOP
candidate with a national reputation,
gained as Richard Nixon's 1960
campaign manager, and later as
secretary of Health, Education and
Welfare and as a Cabinet-level
counsellor to the President.
When the Republicans swept all but
one statewide office in 1966, Finch
defeated incumbent Lt. Gov. Glenn M.
Anderson. He resigned in 1969 to take
over HEW, but when he left
Washington at the end of Nixon's first
term, it was with the announced
intention of running for office here.
The question for Finch is what
office to run for. Gov. Reagan has
indicated he may — or may not —
challenge Democratic Sen. Alan
Cranston next year. Should Reagan
not run, Finch is considered a possible
Cranston opponent. At the moment,
though, he is rumored to be leaning
towards the statehouse, and will likely
make his final plans when Reagan
announces his intentions within two
weeks.

While Finch is a moderate who is
not totally unacceptable to any wing
of the state GOP, Flournoy, 43, is
anathema to conservatives. The former
college professor, who beat the
incumbent Cranston for the
controller's job in 1966, is the most
liberal of the four candidates vying for
the Republican nomination, and his
occasional criticism of even Reagan
has earned him a reputation as a
maverick.
It is a label Floumoy has not found
a handicap. In 1970, he was re-elected
with the largest margin of any
statewide candidate, and almost
immediately began laying the
groundwork for a possible
gubernatorial bid.
However, Flournoy is facing several
handicaps. Conservatives — in
California as elsewhere — tend to be
the men with the money. With a few
exceptions, the GOP money men have
not been receptive to liberal
candidates, and Flournoy will need
extensive financial support in a

primary battle.
In addition, Flournoy may lack
name recognition. He has not made his
office — which handles the state's
fiscal affairs — the forum that one
Democratic aspirant, Secretary of
State Edmund G. Brown Jr., has. To
add to confusion, Brown's 1970
opponent was a black Los Angeles
attorney named James Flournoy —
and some polls indicated that many
people were not even aware that there
were two Flournoys on the ballot.
Outspoken Conservative
Reinecke, meanwhile, is located on
the other end of the political
spectrum. An outspoken conservative,
Reinecke was appointed by Reagan to
succeed Finch in 1968, and the former
Congressman easily won election on
his own in 1970.
Reinecke, 49, is the closest to
declaring officially for the
gubernatorial race. Since his 1970
election, he has been carefully
cultivating party leaders, and last year
campaigned extensively for GOP state

Senate and Assembly candidates. His
activities met with mixed results — the
Senate deadlocked 19-19 while the
Assembly went 51-29 Democratic —
but Reinecke increased his popularity
with many Republicans, and was the
undisputed star of the recent
Republican State Central Committee
convention.
Apparently the most ambivalent
potential candidate is Younger, the
former Los Angeles County district
attorney who will be completing his
first term in Sacramento. Reports have
had him running for governor, running
for re-election, and undecided. His
most recent public statement attacked
other potential candidates who he said
havy been circulating rumors that he
might not run for governor.
Seeks Publicity
Younger, 54, has managed to keep
his name in the headlines consistently
since his election. He was strongly
identified with the initiative proposal
last November to reinstate the death


ROBERT FINCH
penalty in California, and has received
substantial publicity during the
false-advertising prosecution of
right-wing cosmetics manufacturer
William Penn Patrick of San Rafael.
Not all the publicity in the Patrick
case has been favorable, though —
several executives of Patrick's Holiday
Magic, Inc. recently took out full-page
ads in several newspapers accusing
Younger of using the case to make
political hay.
With so many top-level Republicans
eyeing the governor's mansion,
California GOP leaders — including the
one who resides at 1600 Pennsylvania
Ave. — must be remembering the 1958
gubernatorial election with a shudder.
That year, a bitter intra-party feud
broke into the open when U.S. Sen.
William Knowland, the Senate

Republican leader, filed in the primary
against incumbent GOP Gov. Goodwin
J. Knight.
After Knowland and Knight had
bitterly denounced each other, a
hasty, last-minute compromise was
engineered, in part by then-Vice
President Nixon, which had Knight
running (unhappily) for Knowland's
Senate seat. In the November election,
both lost — Knowland to Atty. Gen.
Edmund G. Brown Sr., and Knight to
Rep. Clair Engel. With candidates from
every wing of the party likely to run in
1974, Republicans will have to pay
special attention to the so-called 11th
Commandment of the GOP: "thou
shalt not speak ill of another
Republican."

scramble.)
