# Things That Come In The Mail
## Dear Aunt Apathee 
### 
Dan Brenner

The typical college newspaper
or radio station receives its share
of "Feature Type" packages from
press syndicates, gag writers, or
the average Madison Ave. schlock
entertainment outfit. The
packages offer entertaining
columns, cartoons, and puzzles
(or interview features for radio),
some of which are good.
However, there is a steady
stream of gimmicks which are
either thrown away or tacked up
on the Daily bulletin boards as a
kind of threat: "Look What May
Become of You, You OATQ
Hack!" In a month's mail, the
syndicates might be selling
columns like "Funky-Groovy
Organic Recipe File," "Ask Dr.
Sex," "Like, Hey Man, What's
Happenin' Baby," and"The
Under 30 Top 20's."
These columns answer
questions from acronymic sorts
like "Ms. G.G., Hollywood Beauty
College, Hollywood, Florida."
Not suitable for the sophisticated
tastes of Daily readers, these
columns never see their way into
print.
Fair Play
So in fair play to the
syndication houses in New York,
excerpts from one of these feature
columns, "Ask Aunt Apathee,"
follows.
DEAR AUNT APATHEE, I am
a co-ed sophomore at a rural state
college. While everyone in high
school thought I was a regular
princess, since I've been here, I
haven't had a single date. I'm
beginning to lose my
self-confidence. Do you think I
should transfer schools? —
Lonely, Bethany Bible School for
Men
DEAR LONELY, Don't rush
to a hasty judgment. When I went
to college, I didn't get my first
date until senior year; and even
then, I had to ask my father three
times before he'd take me to the
prom.

DEAR AUNT APATHEE, I've
been playing around with a lot of
chicks lately, but gosh darn it, I'm
really stuck on this tall brunette
in my political science class. I've

tried everything — rides home,
lunches, evening dates, the works
- but nothing goes. What should I
do? — Maybe Stupid
DEAR MAYBE, First, don't
panic; you've got plenty of time
to make time with Miss
Smartypants. But if she's the girl
for you, then go to your
bookstore and ask for the Aunt
Apathee Vocabulary Builder Flash
Cards and Home Test Set. You'll
learn word after impressive word
with this kit. You'll floor the
book brat w.ih words like
"vociferate," "pecuniary," and
"laxative."
Then, she'll come crawling to
you, and you can play
stand-offish.

DEAR AUNT APATHEE, I
was a little afraid to write to you,
but you're my last resort. When I
came here, I thought I was, well,
pretty smart. Now that I've been
here two quarters, I'm on the
Dean's suspended activity list, I'm
flunking English one, and I don't
even have the energy to go see my
teachers. Maybe I should just quit
school and work for a while or
travel around. What do you
suggest? — Having A Rotten Time
DEAR ROTTEN, Are you
kidding, boopie? Quit now, just
when things are just about to get
interesting? If I were you, I'd join
three or four clubs, get on some
sports teams, and take a part-time
job. I mean, if you're going to get
out of school, you might as well
do it in grand fashion; then, you
can blame the fact that you
flunked out of school on your job
or your activities. Besides, why
quit? Have you got something
better to do?

DEAR AUNT APATHEE, This
isn't a question, but I thought
some of your readers would
appreciate knowing this little
story. I have several pets in my
dorm room, and my roommate
just can't stand them. Well, one
afternoon, a group of us in the
dorm decided to play a little trick
on this spoiled sport.
Bruce, my pet eel, has a craving
for warm water. He just goes wild

when the temperature starts
rising. One cold night last month,
we stuck Bruce in my intolerant
roomie's waterbed. When she
turned up the heater, Bruce went
crazy, splishing and splashing
every which way until the vinyl
bed broke.
I don't have to tell you that
everyone was in stitches. What a
riot! When we finally could hold
our laughter, I remembered that
poor Brucie was out of the water.
I looked for him on the floor but
couldn't find him. Finally, there
was Bruce, tucked away on the
plastic turtle island, acting very
strange with Ginger, my
roommate's only pet.
This week, to our surprise,
Ginger was pregnant. When we
called in the vet, he looked at me
in disbelief. Now, my roommate
has slapped me with a paternity
suit on her turtle. And they call
this justice ...Last Laugh

DEAR AUNT APATHEE, I am
getting sick and tired of these
political activists butting into my
affairs. I've got it pretty tough
here at college, what with the job
market being so tight, and I didn't
come here to be gloomy. When I
have free time, the accent is on
one very important word, F-U-N.
So what if I don't eat Farm
Workers Lettuce, or if I don't care
to know about political problems.
If these punko activists want to
get frizzled, let 'em. As far as I'm
concerned, the only off-campus
problem I'm worried about is
whether they're goinf to card me
when I buy beer. Tell these
do-gooders to lay off, will ya? —
Roll Out The Barrel
DEAR ROLL, You are so
right. It's time these tear-jerking
milktoasts get on the high horses
and ride off campus. Why should
you care about farmworkers or
prisoners or kids who need a
couple hours a week of aid? Your
two hours in front of the tube or
playing pool are more important
for you, so relax: nobody's going
to force you to do anything.
