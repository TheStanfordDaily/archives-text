# Judicial Panel Observes Charter
## On Student's Rights 
### 
James V. Sienna

In a letter in the March 1, 1973 Daily ASSU
Co-President Brent Appel asserts that . . the
Student Judicial Charter of 1968 did have
significant rights that were consequently suspended
when the Campus Judicial System was created . .
This is not the case. The Campus Judicial Panel
operates in a system which observes all of the
significant rights given students under the 1968
Charter.
Nor is it the case that the petition being
circulated by SCOPE and FPAG members would in
any way expand the rights of students, faculty or
staff. The constitutional rights which public
educational institutions must observe, and which
the petitioners apparently believe we do not now
observe, are fewer than those already a part of the
Stanford disciplinary systems.
Examination of the Bill of Rights, for example,
reveals that those rights which might be thought
apposite to a campus disciplinary proceeding are
guaranteed only in criminal proceedings, which our
proceedings (and those of the public educational
institutions) are not. Thus, merely acknowledging
the Bill of Rights as binding does not lead you
anywhere.
Where We Stand
The petition gives a "partial list" of the rights
which, in the view of its supporters, would be
incorporated in our disciplinary systems if we were
to "adopt" the Bill of Rights of the U.S.
Constitution and Laws of the State of California.
Herewith a summary of where we now stand in
regard to those rights in our student and faculty
disciplinary systems:
(a) "To be informed of the charge and of the
alleged act upon which the charge is based": This is
provided for by both systems.
(b) "To be allowed a reasonable time to prepare
a defense": This is provided for in both systems.
(c) "To hear all evidence upon which the charge
is based and to answer this evidence through
rebuttal": This is provided for in both systems.

(d) "To call witnesses before the hearing body
and to confront witnesses in front of the body":
This is provided for in both systems.
(e) "To have an open hearing at the request of
the party being disciplined": This is provided for in
both systems.
(112) "To be disciplined on the basis of direct
evidence and not on the basis of hearsay": This is
not provided for in either system. Hearsay evidence
is admissable, and that is clearly constitutional. The
question is whether the burden of proof necessary
to a conviction could be met with hearsay evidence
alone. That would seem very unlikely.
(g) "To request that any member of the hearing
body may be disqualified after questioning or
evidence reveals prejudice": This is provided for in
both systems.
Challenge
(h) "To have no person presenting evidence sit in
judgment": This would be a variation of the
"challenge for cause" provision, (g) above, and is
therefore provided for in each system.
(i) "To be considered innocent until proven
guilty beyond a reasonable doubt": The buiden of
proof in student cases is "beyond a reasonable
doubt." In faculty cases the charges must be
sustained by "highly persuasive evidence." The
faculty discussed but did not adopt the "beyond a
reasonable doubt standard." (Constitutionally it is
required only in criminal cases.)
(j) "To have the assistance of counsel": This is
provided for in both systems.
Not Bereft
In an effort to be brief I have not raised a
number of other problems which the petition and
Mr. Appel's letter present. In due course those
should be addressed. But at the moment it is most
important to put to rest the assertion that Stanford
students are bereft of rights which once were theirs.
That simply is not so.
