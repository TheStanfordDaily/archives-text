# Democratic Hopefuls Want To Regain Statehouse
## 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY News Analysis (Second of Two Parts) 
While the four prospective 1974
Republican candidates for governor of
California mull their chances of either
succeeding Gov. Ronald Reagan or
challenging Democratic Sen. Alan
Cranston, no fewer than six Democrats
have started unofficial campaigns for
the top state job.
San Francisco Mayor Joseph
Alioto, Secretary of State Edmund G.
Brown Jr., Assembly Speaker Robert
Moretti, state Senate majority leader
George Moscone, millionaire financier
William Matson Roth, and U.S. Rep.
Jerome Waldie have been none too
subtle about their gubernatorial
ambitions.
All but Roth have already been
touring the state for several weeks as
part of a "road show" of potential
candidates; Waldie, from Antioch in
Contra Costa County, has already
officially declared his candidacy; and
Roth, a University of California
regent, has hired a campaign
consulting firm to bolster his image.
If Alioto, 56, wins the
governorship, it will mark perhaps the
greatest political resurrection since

Richard Nixon's. Only two years ago,
the former labor lawyer's fortunes
were at low ebb: a Look magazine
article purported to link him with the
Mafia, he was defendant in civil and
criminal cases stemming from an
alleged fee-splitting incident involving
the former attorney general of
Washington, and he was facing stiff
opposition in his 1971 bid for
re-election.
Problems Vanished
But all those problems appear to
have vanished. Alioto has been cleared
of the Washington charges; a jury
found the Look charges against him
false and defamatory; and he won a
convincing re-election victory. Now he
appears ready to take up where he left

off in 1970, when he was poised to
run until sidetracked by his series of
misfortunes.
There is no telling at this point, of
course, how much of a stigma Alioto's
legal woes have left him with. He has
claimed that his court victories make
him "the only candidate certified
honest," but this may be like Sen.
Thomas Eagleton declaring he was the
only candidate certified sane in 1972.
Brown, 34, has avoided any
Alioto-like "misfortunes"; his rise to
the top of the Democratic heap has
been smooth and carefully
orchestrated.
In 1969, Brown — son of the
two-term governor defeated by Reagan
in 1966 — was perhaps the best-known

junior college trustee in the nation,
and in 1970, he defeated a black Los
Angeles attorney named James
Flournoy to become the only
Democrat elected to state
constitutional office that year.
Political Base
Since then, Brown has converted
the secretaryship into a political base,
keeping his name in the headlines
through his vigorous enforcement of
election laws. And he does have name
identification: there has been an
Edmund G. Brown on the ballot in
every state election since 1954.
Several other Democratic
candidates have already tabbed Brown
as the frontrunner, but because of his
youth and relative inexperience he

may be a vulnerable frontrunner.
Although some polls have shown him
currently leading, with a traditional
Democratic free-for-all in the works
his nomination is far from certain.
Moretti, should he run," will be
forced to give up his current post as
the most powerful Democrat in the
legislature. A protege of former
Speaker Jess Unruh, Moretti took over
from his mentor after Unruh's defeat
in the 1970 gubernatorial race.
The 36-year-old Van Nuys
legislator, was instrumental in the
passage of property tax and welfare
reform bills supported by Reagan, and
his name, with Reagan's, is attached to
the 1972 tax reform-school financing
bill.

He admits that he accepts campaign
contributions from special interest
groups, which gives him a big
advantage over most of the other
candidates. "I don't run and hide
when I get a contribution from this
special interest or the other," he
recently told the Los Angeles Times.
"But anyone looking around
Sacramento knows that special
interests just are not running the state
Assembly." Moretti can also count on
support from assemblymen and other
party leaders, for whom he
campaigned vigorously last year.
Moscone, 44, another San
Franciscan, has been discussing
running for governor since 1970, but
has been rumored at various times to
be considering dropping his candidacy
this year. One recent report —
vociferously denied — had him
supporting Alioto in 1974 in return
for Alioto's backing for mayor in
1975. A final decision on his plans is
due soon.
Moscone, the Senate's
second-ranking Democrat, has an extra
consideration should he run for
governor: like Moretti, Waldie, and
Brown, his current term of office
expires in 1974.
Virtually all the Democratic
contenders describe themselves as
liberals — but of varying degrees.
Moscone supported Sen. George
McGovern for the Democratic
Presidential nomination last year, as
did Brown, Waldie, and Moretti (who
switched from Sen. Edmund Muskie).
Alioto, however, backed Sen. Hubert
Humphrey, although he supported
McGovern after the convention.
Roth, a 56-year-old party
fundraiser who was Muskie's San
Francisco campaign chairman, is the
mystery man of the Democratic race.
He is reportedly hoping that a
"non-political" image will appeal to
the state's voters. Coming from the
less-populated northern part of the
state, and not well-known, Roth is at
best a dark horse.
Less of a dark horse, but still a
longshot, is Waldie, the only declared
candidate thus far. A former state
assemblyman, the 48-year-old Waldie
was re-elected to Congress in 1972
despite the fact that he told his
constituency during the campaign that
he would be running for governor in
1974. He has already reportedly
gathered some $125,000 from the Bay
area for his gubernatorial bid.

Waldie has already made several
campaign swings through the state,
including an appearance at Stanford
last month and a recent stopover in
San Jose.
Although not well-known in the
southern part of the state, he has long
been a foe of the California Water
Plan, by which water is taken from the
north of the state to the south. Waldie,
who says this will encourage further
overdevelopment in the south, hopes
that his pitch will appeal to
growth-weary residents.
In the spirit of the fractious and
feuding Democratic Party, several
other candidates may run besides the
six already active. Foremost is Los
Angeles Mayor Sam Yorty, the
63-year-old maverick currently
fighting his own re-election battle.
Yorty — oft-defeated for governor,
senator, and President — opposed Jess
Unruh for the nomination in 1970,
and if he wins a fourth term in L.A.
may try again — or he may run for
governor even if he loses.
Another potential candidate is
Unruh himself, now also running for
L.A. mayor who is known to have
long-standing gubernatorial ambitions.
State Sen. James Mills of San Diego,
the Senate's president pro tem, has
reportedly dropped his ambitions after
taking soundings last year.
