# Poor Families Benefit
## Need For Child Care Urgent 
### 
Maccoby And Greenfield

Mr. Evers' article on "The
Politics of Child Care" (Daily,
March 1) seems to have been
based on a number of
misapprehensions. He regards
federally-financed child care as a
financial burden upon middle and
lower-income people and as a
boon to "liberal sociology and
psychology majors" who could
presumably get jobs in such
centers if they were funded.
It is true, of course, that any
federally financed program is a
financial burden upon taxpayers.
Some programs, however, return
more to poor families than they
take away, and child care services
are a good case in point.
The primary beneficiaries of
federally-financed child care are
poor families where the mother
works, and where total family
income is not sufficient to cover
the cost of adequate private care.
The personnel of federally
financed centers have been largely
drawn from the local communities
they serve, and have provided a
very large number of jobs to
Blacks and Chicanos (particularly
women) who would otherwise
have had to take menial,
lower-paying jobs. The federal

Office of Child Development has
recently established a training
program for a new kind of child
care worker, the "Child
Development Associate." College
education is not a requirement for
the trainees, who are drawn
largely from minority people in
impoverished areas.
Fund-Cutting
The program was set in motion
at a time when an expansion of
child care services was planned.
The current wave of fund-cutting
in child care services of all kinds
may mean that there will be few
jobs for the trainees to go into
when their training is completed,
but the need for their services
remains.
Mr. Evers warns of the
potential partnership "between
government and corporate
profit-seekers" in the child-care
field. It is true that some private,
profit-making corporations have
recently entered the child care
field. So far they have not been
financially very successful; child
care is not a profitable field,
because the people who need it
most have so little money to pay
for it.
If large amounts of Federal
money became available,
presumably the federal
policy-makers would have a
choice between channelling the
money into the hands of private
contractors, state and local
governments, or non-profit
community organizations. If
Federal money were to go to
private profit-making contractors,
there would presumably have to
be some federal standards and
supervision to prevent the
contractors from lowering quality
and exploiting the children in
their programs. There is much to
be said for choosing the
non-profit channels, but the risks
in the private-contractor system
do not justify eliminating federal
support for all child care
programs, both public and private,
as Mr. Evers seems to recommend.
Sinister Purpose?
He says that there is
"mounting evidence" that the
proposed child care centers have
the "sinister purpose" of
removing the education and
training of children from the
home and church, and turning the
children over to professionals who
would "attempt to influence
directly the social and political
values of the children." Mr. Evers
should realize that the advocates
of federal financing for child care
are not talking about taking
children out of the home. The
children are already out of the
home. The mothers already work,
by necessity. Many of their
children are now receiving very
poor care, or none at all.
There are instances at present,
for example, where 15 or 20
two-year-olds are in the care of a
single adult, and spend the day
tied to a chair or cot, with the
only distraction offered being a
TV set. Without Federal or State
financial help, this is the only
kind of child care many mothers
can afford. What solution does
Mr. Evers propose? Does he
consider the existing situation
satisfactory? Or is he simply
unaware of it?
For many poor families, the
choice is not between a
federally-financed child care
center and loving, skillful,
individual care by the child's
mother in his own home. The
choice is between reasonably good
federally-financed care, and
inadequately financed (sometimes
injurious) private care during the
mother's working hours. The
availability of a good child-care
center has sometimes meant that a
divorced, widowed or unmarried
mother can keep her family

together when she would
otherwise have had to give the
children up for adoption or
institutional care, so that child care
centers frequently represent
support for family life, not
interference.
It has been found possible to
maintain a considerable degree of
community control over child
care centers, even when they
receive Federal funds. Project
"Headstart," for example, has a
built-in requirement that there
must be a Policy Advisory
Council, with parent
representation, for every center
that receives Headstart funds.
These Councils have a voice in the

selection of teachers and the
choice of the kind of teaching and
recreation to be offered. So long
as parents have such a voice, there
seems little danger of their
children being brainwashed by
alien values in child-care centers.
We suggest that Mr. Evers (and
the rest of us!) direct our political
energies toward keeping
community participation alive as a
feature of any federally funded
child care system that is adopted.
But we believe that the need for
some such system is urgent.
