I am a member of the Entering
Students committee, a
subcommittee of the Committee
of Undergraduate Studies.
Because of this 1 have received
two publications recently.
The first, put out by the Dean
of Undergraduate Studies, gives a
report of the priorities of his
office for 1971-72. It cost
twenty-four cents to mail this
report to my post-office box. The
second publication was from the
University financial
administration office and gave the
University budget for the past
year. It cost forty cents to mail
this item.
My committee is limited to
aspects of the freshman year,
particularly orientation, as the
title "Entering Students"
indicates. Therefore, facts like the
breakdown of the $346 million's
worth of endowment assets are
interesting, but entirely irrelevant
to my committee. Who decided
that I should be sent a copy of the
budget report and why? It
consists of twenty-four pages of
charts, photographs, and
commentary that must have cost
the University a small sum to
print. I was just one among at
least a dozen students in Wilbur
Hall who received a copy.
To some this complaint may
seem an insignificant quibble
dealing with a maximum potential
savings of under fifty dollars. Yet
the one thing I did observe in
reading the annual financial report
was that the University does not
have any excess money to waste. I
am not complaining about
receiving these materials in
themselves, since both reports
were very revealing looks at
University structure and
financing. However, I wonder if a
stricter policy regarding those
who receive University mailings
couldn't save a few dollars for a
real need.
