# On Freedom, Economic And Political
## Two Libertarians 
### 
Chris Hocker

Those of you who watch the
CBS Sunday night program "60
Minutes" know that one of its
regular features is a short segment
called "Point-Counterpoint."
Here, two nationally-syndicated
columnists, Nicholas Von
Hoffman and James Jackson
Kilpatrick, representing the left
and the right respectively,
exchange views on a topic
particularly salient that week.
Each of them only gets to
speak for about a minute—not
long enough to develop what they
are saying, or even to present a
really clear view of the issue to
the viewing public. Two minutes
of surface exchange is evidently
CBS's idea of serving "the public
interest" and presenting a
"balanced program."
If Von Hoffman and Kilpatrick
were ever allowed to discuss their
topic more fully, though, they
would probably find that they are
in basic agreement with each
other on those issues which
concern the government and its
relationship to the individual.
Libertarians
John Hospers, Dean of the
Philosophy Department at USC
and the Libertarian Party's
candidate for president in the last
election, has said, in effect:
conservatives stress economic
freedom and de-emphasize
political freedom; liberals stress
political freedom and
de-emphasize economic freedom;
libertarians emphasize both.
The Von Hoffman-Kilpatrick
duo represents a blending of the
two aspects of freedom, economic
and political. Kilpatrick is as
surely a conservative as Von
Hoffman is a liberal, but each is
the most consistently libertarian
of what both segments of the
spectrum have to offer.
Von Hoffman's last two
columns (carried in the "Sunday
Punch" section of the San
Francisco Chronicle) have dealt
with crucial libertarian issues. The
first one discussed the
implementation in a limited
degree of the voucher system in
education, notably in the Alum
Rock School District, a poorer
section of San Jose.
Vouchers
(The voucher system is a
proposal that would, in effect,
allow the parents of school
children to choose the form of
education that they
desire—essentially, returning the
business of education to the free
market. The number of people
around Stanford who have heard
of the system or are aware that it
is being applied only twenty miles
away—hardly anyone that I have
talked to—almost leads me to

believe that some sort of
Conspiracy of Silence is being
perpetrated by educators who see
their jobs threatened if the old,
compulsory educational operation
is done away with.)
Last Sunday's column by Von
Hoffman told of a group of men
in Southern California who have
been convicted of conspiracy
because of their opposition to
government policy.
Their opposition was not to
the war, or to the police—it was to
the manner in which the Internal
Revenue Service seized the
property of a businessman who
was behind in his taxes. The men
formed a picket line outside the
warehouse where the IRS agents
were taking over, a warehouse
that was the property of the
delinquent taxpayer. When a
scuffle broke out, the men were
arrested for conspiracy against the
government.
Von Hoffman sees this as an
example of the growing Tax
Revolt, a movement that is being
led for the most part by people on
the right who are as incensed as
the most radical leftist at such

manifestations of government
power as the 35 percent or so that
is taken from the average
paycheck in taxes, and at such
blatant examples of unfairness as
the Lockheed loan, by which a
Tailing corporation was supported
by money stolen from the
taxpayers.
Self-perpetuation
Such laws as the one against
conspiracy, long referred to by
the left as a repressive tool of the
right, is now being used against
the right as well. Such
governmental measures are not a
product of the left or the right as
such, but of the State itself,
whose only ideology is its own
self-perpetuation.
Liberals and conservatives such
as Von Hoffman and Kilpatrick
realize the source of the greatest
danger to all individuals to be Big
Government. To the extent that
this viewpoint is consistently
applied, both economic and
political freedom will grow and
the libertarian movement away
from State control will continue.

education that they
desire—essentially, returning the
business of education to the free
market. The number of people
around Stanford who have heard
of the system or are aware that it
is being applied only twenty miles
away—hardly anyone that I have
talked to—almost leads me to

believe that some sort of
Conspiracy of Silence is being
perpetrated by educators who see
their jobs threatened if the old,
compulsory educational operation
is done away with.)
Last Sunday's column by Von
Hoffman told of a group of men
in Southern California who have
been convicted of conspiracy
because of their opposition to
government policy.
Their opposition was not to
the war, or to the police—it was to
the manner in which the Internal
Revenue Service seized the
property of a businessman who
was behind in his taxes. The men
formed a picket line outside the
warehouse where the IRS agents
were taking over, a warehouse
that was the property of the
delinquent taxpayer. When a
scuffle broke out, the men were
arrested for conspiracy against the
government.
Von Hoffman sees this as an
example of the growing Tax
Revolt, a movement that is being
led for the most part by people on
the right who are as incensed as
the most radical leftist at such

manifestations of government
power as the 35 percent or so that
is taken from the average
paycheck in taxes, and at such
blatant examples of unfairness as
the Lockheed loan, by which a
Tailing corporation was supported
by money stolen from the
taxpayers.
Self-perpetuation
Such laws as the one against
conspiracy, long referred to by
the left as a repressive tool of the
right, is now being used against
the right as well. Such
governmental measures are not a
product of the left or the right as
such, but of the State itself,
whose only ideology is its own
self-perpetuation.
Liberals and conservatives such
as Von Hoffman and Kilpatrick
realize the source of the greatest
danger to all individuals to be Big
Government. To the extent that
this viewpoint is consistently
applied, both economic and
political freedom will grow and
the libertarian movement away
from State control will continue.

Those of you who watch the
CBS Sunday night program "60
Minutes" know that one of its
regular features is a short segment
called "Point-Counterpoint."
Here, two nationally-syndicated
columnists, Nicholas Von
Hoffman and James Jackson
Kilpatrick, representing the left
and the right respectively,
exchange views on a topic
particularly salient that week.
Each of them only gets to
speak for about a minute—not
long enough to develop what they
are saying, or even to present a
really clear view of the issue to
the viewing public. Two minutes
of surface exchange is evidently
CBS's idea of serving "the public
interest" and presenting a
"balanced program."
If Von Hoffman and Kilpatrick
were ever allowed to discuss their
topic more fully, though, they
would probably find that they are
in basic agreement with each
other on those issues which
concern the government and its
relationship to the individual.
Libertarians
John Hospers, Dean of the
Philosophy Department at USC
and the Libertarian Party's
candidate for president in the last
election, has said, in effect:
conservatives stress economic
freedom and de-emphasize
political freedom; liberals stress
political freedom and
de-emphasize economic freedom;
libertarians emphasize both.
The Von Hoffman-Kilpatrick
duo represents a blending of the
two aspects of freedom, economic
and political. Kilpatrick is as
surely a conservative as Von
Hoffman is a liberal, but each is
the most consistently libertarian
of what both segments of the
spectrum have to offer.
Von Hoffman's last two
columns (carried in the "Sunday
Punch" section of the San
Francisco Chronicle) have dealt
with crucial libertarian issues. The
first one discussed the
implementation in a limited
degree of the voucher system in
education, notably in the Alum
Rock School District, a poorer
section of San Jose.
Vouchers
(The voucher system is a
proposal that would, in effect,
allow the parents of school
children to choose the form of
education that they
desire—essentially, returning the
business of education to the free
market. The number of people
around Stanford who have heard
of the system or are aware that it
is being applied only twenty miles
