# Students Rate TV Dumb Relief
## 
### GEORGE DOBBINS 
It is a cold, rainy Friday night
on the Stanford campus—a time
to stay inside. But most students
have deserted their dormitories
for movies, lectures and sporting
events. A few loyalists watch
television—a very few. They are
disobeying the University's
implied commandment: thou
shalt not watch television for ye
shall destroy your mind.
In a Toyon eating club, one girl
watches because "It's a nice
relief." In Crothers Memorial Hall,
three graduate students watch a
basketball game on the set. In a
large lounge of Stern Hall, two
students view a movie made for
television because of a "lack of
something to do."
And this is the solution to a
paradox at Stanford—students
look down on television as
unintellectual and dumb, but it
frequently provides a way to pass
the time, last resort or not.
Mental Doily
What Marshall McLuhan has
labeled the most powerful weapon
of the visual age and Mason
Williams says renders a pattern of
ideas analogous to a "doily for
your mind," Stanford students
call "nothing," "emptiness,"
"mental chewing gum" and
"escape."
In a random sample poll of 50
students (20 graduates, 30
undergraduates), only six said
they never watch; 21 watch
television seldom (less than once a
week); and 23 are regular weekly
viewers. Proportionally, the
graduate students interviewed
watch more television than the
undergraduates, particularly the
regular viewers.
The programs getting the most
votes (24) were movies, all kinds.
Even the Saturday night Channel
2 series, "Creature Features,"
received a nomination.
The news programs ranked
second, with Walter Cronkite
leading the way. (Note that CBS
news did not get a vote, but
Walter received eleven.) Harry
Reasoner followed Cronkite, then
Channel Seven (local) and NBC
received one mention. "Meet the
Press" was also nominated.
High Local Ratings
It is rare for an individual local
station to receive as many votes as

Channel Nine's programming did
(13) to place third. "Masterpiece
Theater," the show that featured
the "Queen Elizabeth" series,
ranked highest. The station itself
received four votes, "Newsroom,"
two, and film series, such as the
Ingmar Bergman festival, two.
Sporting events are fourth in
line, according to viewers
polled—football, tennis, basketball
and hockey received a combined
total of 12 votes. Outdoor specials
such as "National Geographic" or
Jacques Cousteau received six
votes.
Individual television series
combined totalled 37 votes. The
highest vote getter was "All in the
Family" (8), followed closely by
"Mary Tyler Moore" (s)—two
comedies. The "NBC Mystery
Movie" ranked next (four votes)
followed by Alistaire Cook's
"America,""The Odd Couple"
and "Mannix," with two votes
each.
Programs individually
mentioned were: "Search,"
"Mission: Impossible," "Hawaii
Five-O," "Maude," "Doctor in the
House," "Adam 12," "Cannon,"
"Ironside," "Carol Burnett,"
"Paul Lynde" and "Bob
Newhart."
Two daytime series each
received two votes—the soap
opera, "All My Children" because,
as one viewer said, "I'm hooked
on it,"and a game show, "Split
Second." Reruns nominated were
(in order): "Wild Wild West,"
"Hogan's Heroes," "Dragnet,"
"That Girl" and"I Love Lucy."
And Johnny Carson and Dick
Cavett received one vote each.
Why Watch?
What reason could Stanford
students possibly have for
watching? Three justifications
were prevalent in the poll: (in
order) distraction, amusement,
and news and information.
Nineteen people said they watch
television solely because it is a
distraction. "I don't feel like
doing my housework most of the
time," one student commented,
"It's just great to remove myself
from the pressures at Stanford. It
relieves my boredom."
Nine watch television for
amusement. As one put it,
"Entertainment comes first and
education comes second on

television. What other way could
it be?"
Those seven who watch for
news and information see another
way. "Television gives us a bit of
history," one commented.
Another praised educational
televison: "Public TV is the only
thing worth watching; I even
subscribe as a member." A third
student reflected, "The news is
great to watch at dinner time—it
gives you a place to look other
than at the food." Other reasons
given for watching television
incuded: fun, exitement and
laziness.
Those who don't watch
television, and even those who do,
were asked why they don't watch
more. Thirty-Five said they had
better things to do. Typical
comments were: "A lot of lives
are wasted that way ... it's all so
crummy—those serials and
comedies ... I detest
commercials... it rots your
mind—bad for the eyes ... you
can turn into a vegetable."
Children Discouraged
One graduate student, a
mother of three, stated, "I
discourage my children every
chance I get—it inhibits their
desire to ever pick up a book." A
number of other students pointed
out that they watch more
television at home.
A factor of time also
discourages television watching
here. "I'm a law student—law
students don't watch TV; free
time is inconceivable and I
probably wouldn't watch if I
could," one adamant non-viewer
stated.
Out of 29 students who had no
time, only 14 said they would
watch if more time were available.

Several pointed out that they
would only concentrate on
educational television and movies.
Six students said they had no
access to a television set. Two of
these also stated they would
watch if they could find a set.
One fraternity viewer said he had
access to a set and it did him no
good: "In order to get a good seat
in our TV room, you have to eat
quickly and I don't."
Half Own Sets
Alan Cummings, manager of
fraternities and residences, claims
that at least half of the University
residences have television sets. He
also points out, "A lot of kids
own televisions." Cummings says
that a number of dormitories,
particularly those in the Wilbur
complex, don't have televisions
because they have been stolen.
"The major detriment to
buying more is the rip off
rate-even when they are bolted
down and chained, it does no
good." He says the houses
themselves purchase the sets, not
the University. "A few years ago,
ASSU used to make loans
available to houses, but before the
loan was payed off, the TV would
get ripped off."
Currently, many of those
televisions remaining are
unsecured. Often, the chains are
layed on top of the sets where
they do no good. One viewer in a
dormitory commented," We
protect the stereo; but who would
want the television?"
Cummings says he can't
estimate how many students
would want to watch television,
but emphasizes, "The number of
sets would indicate that some
people are interested."

Ingmar Bergman festival, two.
Sporting events are fourth in
line, according to viewers
polled—football, tennis, basketball
and hockey received a combined
total of 12 votes. Outdoor specials
such as "National Geographic" or
Jacques Cousteau received six
votes.
Individual television series
combined totalled 37 votes. The
highest vote getter was "All in the
Family" (8), followed closely by
"Mary Tyler Moore" (s)—two
comedies. The "NBC Mystery
Movie" ranked next (four votes)
followed by Alistaire Cook's
"America,""The Odd Couple"
and "Mannix," with two votes
each.
Programs individually
mentioned were: "Search,"
"Mission: Impossible," "Hawaii
Five-O," "Maude," "Doctor in the
House," "Adam 12," "Cannon,"
"Ironside," "Carol Burnett,"
"Paul Lynde" and "Bob
Newhart."
Two daytime series each
received two votes—the soap
opera, "All My Children" because,
as one viewer said, "I'm hooked
on it,"and a game show, "Split
Second." Reruns nominated were
(in order): "Wild Wild West,"
"Hogan's Heroes," "Dragnet,"
"That Girl" and"I Love Lucy."
And Johnny Carson and Dick
Cavett received one vote each.
Why Watch?
What reason could Stanford
students possibly have for
watching? Three justifications
were prevalent in the poll: (in
order) distraction, amusement,
and news and information.
Nineteen people said they watch
television solely because it is a
distraction. "I don't feel like
doing my housework most of the
time," one student commented,
"It's just great to remove myself
from the pressures at Stanford. It
relieves my boredom."
Nine watch television for
amusement. As one put it,
"Entertainment comes first and
education comes second on

television. What other way could
it be?"
Those seven who watch for
news and information see another
way. "Television gives us a bit of
history," one commented.
Another praised educational
televison: "Public TV is the only
thing worth watching; I even
subscribe as a member." A third
student reflected, "The news is
great to watch at dinner time—it
gives you a place to look other
than at the food." Other reasons
given for watching television
incuded: fun, exitement and
laziness.
Those who don't watch
television, and even those who do,
were asked why they don't watch
more. Thirty-Five said they had
better things to do. Typical
comments were: "A lot of lives
are wasted that way ... it's all so
crummy—those serials and
comedies ... I detest
commercials... it rots your
mind—bad for the eyes ... you
can turn into a vegetable."
Children Discouraged
One graduate student, a
mother of three, stated, "I
discourage my children every
chance I get—it inhibits their
desire to ever pick up a book." A
number of other students pointed
out that they watch more
television at home.
A factor of time also
discourages television watching
here. "I'm a law student—law
students don't watch TV; free
time is inconceivable and I
probably wouldn't watch if I
could," one adamant non-viewer
stated.
Out of 29 students who had no
time, only 14 said they would
watch if more time were available.

Several pointed out that they
would only concentrate on
educational television and movies.
Six students said they had no
access to a television set. Two of
these also stated they would
watch if they could find a set.
One fraternity viewer said he had
access to a set and it did him no
good: "In order to get a good seat
in our TV room, you have to eat
quickly and I don't."
Half Own Sets
Alan Cummings, manager of
fraternities and residences, claims
that at least half of the University
residences have television sets. He
also points out, "A lot of kids
own televisions." Cummings says
that a number of dormitories,
particularly those in the Wilbur
complex, don't have televisions
because they have been stolen.
"The major detriment to
buying more is the rip off
rate-even when they are bolted
down and chained, it does no
good." He says the houses
themselves purchase the sets, not
the University. "A few years ago,
ASSU used to make loans
available to houses, but before the
loan was payed off, the TV would
get ripped off."
Currently, many of those
televisions remaining are
unsecured. Often, the chains are
layed on top of the sets where
they do no good. One viewer in a
dormitory commented," We
protect the stereo; but who would
want the television?"
Cummings says he can't
estimate how many students
would want to watch television,
but emphasizes, "The number of
sets would indicate that some
people are interested."
It is a cold, rainy Friday night
on the Stanford campus—a time
to stay inside. But most students
have deserted their dormitories
for movies, lectures and sporting
events. A few loyalists watch
television—a very few. They are
disobeying the University's
implied commandment: thou
shalt not watch television for ye
shall destroy your mind.
In a Toyon eating club, one girl
watches because "It's a nice
relief." In Crothers Memorial Hall,
three graduate students watch a
basketball game on the set. In a
large lounge of Stern Hall, two
students view a movie made for
television because of a "lack of
something to do."
And this is the solution to a
paradox at Stanford—students
look down on television as
unintellectual and dumb, but it
frequently provides a way to pass
the time, last resort or not.
Mental Doily
What Marshall McLuhan has
labeled the most powerful weapon
of the visual age and Mason
Williams says renders a pattern of
ideas analogous to a "doily for
your mind," Stanford students
call "nothing," "emptiness,"
"mental chewing gum" and
"escape."
In a random sample poll of 50
students (20 graduates, 30
undergraduates), only six said
they never watch; 21 watch
television seldom (less than once a
week); and 23 are regular weekly
viewers. Proportionally, the
graduate students interviewed
watch more television than the
undergraduates, particularly the
regular viewers.
The programs getting the most
votes (24) were movies, all kinds.
Even the Saturday night Channel
2 series, "Creature Features,"
received a nomination.
The news programs ranked
second, with Walter Cronkite
leading the way. (Note that CBS
news did not get a vote, but
Walter received eleven.) Harry
Reasoner followed Cronkite, then
Channel Seven (local) and NBC
received one mention. "Meet the
Press" was also nominated.
High Local Ratings
It is rare for an individual local
station to receive as many votes as

Channel Nine's programming did
(13) to place third. "Masterpiece
Theater," the show that featured
the "Queen Elizabeth" series,
ranked highest. The station itself
received four votes, "Newsroom,"
two, and film series, such as the
Ingmar Bergman festival, two.

than at the food." Other reasons
given for watching television
incuded: fun, exitement and
laziness.
Those who don't watch
television, and even those who do,
were asked why they don't watch
more. Thirty-Five said they had
better things to do. Typical
comments were: "A lot of lives
are wasted that way ... it's all so
crummy—those serials and
comedies ... I detest
commercials... it rots your
mind—bad for the eyes ... you
can turn into a vegetable."
Children Discouraged
One graduate student, a
mother of three, stated, "I
discourage my children every
chance I get—it inhibits their
desire to ever pick up a book." A
number of other students pointed
out that they watch more
television at home.
A factor of time also
discourages television watching
here. "I'm a law student—law
students don't watch TV; free
time is inconceivable and I
probably wouldn't watch if I
could," one adamant non-viewer
stated.
Out of 29 students who had no
time, only 14 said they would
watch if more time were available.

Several pointed out that they
would only concentrate on
educational television and movies.
Six students said they had no
access to a television set. Two of
these also stated they would
watch if they could find a set.
One fraternity viewer said he had
access to a set and it did him no
good: "In order to get a good seat
in our TV room, you have to eat
quickly and I don't."
Half Own Sets
Alan Cummings, manager of
fraternities and residences, claims
that at least half of the University
residences have television sets. He
also points out, "A lot of kids
own televisions." Cummings says
that a number of dormitories,
particularly those in the Wilbur
complex, don't have televisions
because they have been stolen.
"The major detriment to
buying more is the rip off
rate-even when they are bolted
down and chained, it does no
good." He says the houses
themselves purchase the sets, not
the University. "A few years ago,
ASSU used to make loans
available to houses, but before the
loan was payed off, the TV would
get ripped off."
Currently, many of those
televisions remaining are
unsecured. Often, the chains are
layed on top of the sets where
they do no good. One viewer in a
dormitory commented," We
protect the stereo; but who would
want the television?"
Cummings says he can't
estimate how many students
would want to watch television,
but emphasizes, "The number of
sets would indicate that some
people are interested."
It is a cold, rainy Friday night
on the Stanford campus—a time
to stay inside. But most students
have deserted their dormitories
for movies, lectures and sporting
events. A few loyalists watch
television—a very few. They are
disobeying the University's
implied commandment: thou
shalt not watch television for ye
shall destroy your mind.
In a Toyon eating club, one girl
watches because "It's a nice
relief." In Crothers Memorial Hall,
three graduate students watch a
basketball game on the set. In a
large lounge of Stern Hall, two
students view a movie made for
television because of a "lack of
something to do."
And this is the solution to a
paradox at Stanford—students
look down on television as
unintellectual and dumb, but it
frequently provides a way to pass
the time, last resort or not.
Mental Doily
What Marshall McLuhan has
labeled the most powerful weapon
of the visual age and Mason
Williams says renders a pattern of
ideas analogous to a "doily for
your mind," Stanford students
call "nothing," "emptiness,"
"mental chewing gum" and
"escape."
In a random sample poll of 50
students (20 graduates, 30
undergraduates), only six said
they never watch; 21 watch
television seldom (less than once a
week); and 23 are regular weekly
viewers. Proportionally, the
graduate students interviewed
watch more television than the
undergraduates, particularly the
regular viewers.
The programs getting the most
votes (24) were movies, all kinds.
Even the Saturday night Channel
2 series, "Creature Features,"
received a nomination.
The news programs ranked
second, with Walter Cronkite
leading the way. (Note that CBS
news did not get a vote, but
Walter received eleven.) Harry
Reasoner followed Cronkite, then
Channel Seven (local) and NBC
received one mention. "Meet the
Press" was also nominated.
High Local Ratings
It is rare for an individual local
station to receive as many votes as

Channel Nine's programming did
(13) to place third. "Masterpiece
Theater," the show that featured
the "Queen Elizabeth" series,
ranked highest. The station itself
received four votes, "Newsroom,"
two, and film series, such as the
Ingmar Bergman festival, two.
Sporting events are fourth in
line, according to viewers
polled—football, tennis, basketball
and hockey received a combined
total of 12 votes. Outdoor specials
such as "National Geographic" or
Jacques Cousteau received six
votes.
Individual television series
combined totalled 37 votes. The
highest vote getter was "All in the
Family" (8), followed closely by
"Mary Tyler Moore" (s)—two
comedies. The "NBC Mystery
Movie" ranked next (four votes)
followed by Alistaire Cook's
"America,""The Odd Couple"
and "Mannix," with two votes
each.
Programs individually
mentioned were: "Search,"
"Mission: Impossible," "Hawaii
Five-O," "Maude," "Doctor in the
House," "Adam 12," "Cannon,"
"Ironside," "Carol Burnett,"
"Paul Lynde" and "Bob
Newhart."
Two daytime series each
received two votes—the soap
opera, "All My Children" because,
as one viewer said, "I'm hooked
on it,"and a game show, "Split
Second." Reruns nominated were
(in order): "Wild Wild West,"
"Hogan's Heroes," "Dragnet,"
"That Girl" and"I Love Lucy."
And Johnny Carson and Dick
Cavett received one vote each.
Why Watch?
What reason could Stanford
students possibly have for
watching? Three justifications
were prevalent in the poll: (in
order) distraction, amusement,
and news and information.
Nineteen people said they watch
television solely because it is a
distraction. "I don't feel like
doing my housework most of the
time," one student commented,
"It's just great to remove myself
from the pressures at Stanford. It
relieves my boredom."
Nine watch television for
amusement. As one put it,
"Entertainment comes first and
education comes second on

television. What other way could
it be?"
Those seven who watch for
news and information see another
way. "Television gives us a bit of
history," one commented.
Another praised educational
televison: "Public TV is the only
thing worth watching; I even
subscribe as a member." A third
student reflected, "The news is
great to watch at dinner time—it
gives you a place to look other
than at the food." Other reasons
given for watching television
incuded: fun, exitement and
laziness.

unsecured. Often, the chains are
layed on top of the sets where
they do no good. One viewer in a
dormitory commented," We
protect the stereo; but who would
want the television?"
Cummings says he can't
estimate how many students
would want to watch television,
but emphasizes, "The number of
sets would indicate that some
people are interested."
It is a cold, rainy Friday night
on the Stanford campus—a time
to stay inside. But most students
have deserted their dormitories
for movies, lectures and sporting
events. A few loyalists watch
television—a very few. They are
disobeying the University's
implied commandment: thou
shalt not watch television for ye
shall destroy your mind.
In a Toyon eating club, one girl
watches because "It's a nice
relief." In Crothers Memorial Hall,
three graduate students watch a
basketball game on the set. In a
large lounge of Stern Hall, two
students view a movie made for
television because of a "lack of
something to do."
And this is the solution to a
paradox at Stanford—students
look down on television as
unintellectual and dumb, but it
frequently provides a way to pass
the time, last resort or not.
Mental Doily
What Marshall McLuhan has
labeled the most powerful weapon
of the visual age and Mason
Williams says renders a pattern of
ideas analogous to a "doily for
your mind," Stanford students
call "nothing," "emptiness,"
"mental chewing gum" and
"escape."
In a random sample poll of 50
students (20 graduates, 30
undergraduates), only six said
they never watch; 21 watch
television seldom (less than once a
week); and 23 are regular weekly
viewers. Proportionally, the
graduate students interviewed
watch more television than the
undergraduates, particularly the
regular viewers.
The programs getting the most
votes (24) were movies, all kinds.
Even the Saturday night Channel
2 series, "Creature Features,"
received a nomination.
The news programs ranked
second, with Walter Cronkite
leading the way. (Note that CBS
news did not get a vote, but
Walter received eleven.) Harry
Reasoner followed Cronkite, then
Channel Seven (local) and NBC
received one mention. "Meet the
Press" was also nominated.
High Local Ratings
It is rare for an individual local
station to receive as many votes as

Channel Nine's programming did
(13) to place third. "Masterpiece
Theater," the show that featured
the "Queen Elizabeth" series,
ranked highest. The station itself
received four votes, "Newsroom,"
two, and film series, such as the
Ingmar Bergman festival, two.
Sporting events are fourth in
line, according to viewers
polled—football, tennis, basketball
and hockey received a combined
total of 12 votes. Outdoor specials
such as "National Geographic" or
Jacques Cousteau received six
votes.
Individual television series
combined totalled 37 votes. The
highest vote getter was "All in the
Family" (8), followed closely by
"Mary Tyler Moore" (s)—two
comedies. The "NBC Mystery
Movie" ranked next (four votes)
followed by Alistaire Cook's
"America,""The Odd Couple"
and "Mannix," with two votes
each.
Programs individually
mentioned were: "Search,"
"Mission: Impossible," "Hawaii
Five-O," "Maude," "Doctor in the
House," "Adam 12," "Cannon,"
"Ironside," "Carol Burnett,"
"Paul Lynde" and "Bob
Newhart."
Two daytime series each
received two votes—the soap
opera, "All My Children" because,
as one viewer said, "I'm hooked
on it,"and a game show, "Split
Second." Reruns nominated were
(in order): "Wild Wild West,"
"Hogan's Heroes," "Dragnet,"
"That Girl" and"I Love Lucy."
And Johnny Carson and Dick
Cavett received one vote each.
Why Watch?
What reason could Stanford
students possibly have for
watching? Three justifications
were prevalent in the poll: (in
order) distraction, amusement,
and news and information.
Nineteen people said they watch
television solely because it is a
distraction. "I don't feel like
doing my housework most of the
time," one student commented,
"It's just great to remove myself
from the pressures at Stanford. It
relieves my boredom."
Nine watch television for
amusement. As one put it,
"Entertainment comes first and
education comes second on

television. What other way could
it be?"
Those seven who watch for
news and information see another
way. "Television gives us a bit of
history," one commented.
Another praised educational
televison: "Public TV is the only
thing worth watching; I even
subscribe as a member." A third
student reflected, "The news is
great to watch at dinner time—it
gives you a place to look other
than at the food." Other reasons
given for watching television
incuded: fun, exitement and
laziness.
Those who don't watch
television, and even those who do,
were asked why they don't watch
more. Thirty-Five said they had
better things to do. Typical
comments were: "A lot of lives
are wasted that way ... it's all so
crummy—those serials and
comedies ... I detest
commercials... it rots your
mind—bad for the eyes ... you
can turn into a vegetable."
Children Discouraged
One graduate student, a
mother of three, stated, "I
discourage my children every
chance I get—it inhibits their
desire to ever pick up a book." A
number of other students pointed
out that they watch more
television at home.
A factor of time also
discourages television watching
here. "I'm a law student—law
students don't watch TV; free
time is inconceivable and I
probably wouldn't watch if I
could," one adamant non-viewer
stated.
Out of 29 students who had no
time, only 14 said they would
watch if more time were available.

Several pointed out that they
would only concentrate on
educational television and movies.
Six students said they had no
access to a television set. Two of
these also stated they would
watch if they could find a set.
One fraternity viewer said he had
access to a set and it did him no
good: "In order to get a good seat
in our TV room, you have to eat
quickly and I don't."
Half Own Sets
Alan Cummings, manager of
fraternities and residences, claims
that at least half of the University
residences have television sets. He
also points out, "A lot of kids
own televisions." Cummings says
that a number of dormitories,
particularly those in the Wilbur
complex, don't have televisions
because they have been stolen.
"The major detriment to
buying more is the rip off
rate-even when they are bolted
down and chained, it does no
good." He says the houses
themselves purchase the sets, not
the University. "A few years ago,
ASSU used to make loans
available to houses, but before the
loan was payed off, the TV would
get ripped off."
Currently, many of those
televisions remaining are
unsecured. Often, the chains are
layed on top of the sets where
they do no good. One viewer in a
dormitory commented," We
protect the stereo; but who would
want the television?"
Cummings says he can't
estimate how many students
would want to watch television,
but emphasizes, "The number of
sets would indicate that some
people are interested."
