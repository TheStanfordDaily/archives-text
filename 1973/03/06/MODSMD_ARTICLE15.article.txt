# 'Medical Care, Cure' Offers Solutions

### 
Providing health care for all
Americans now requires a
universally available funding
system.
Whether developed exclusively
by the government or through a
combination of private and public
means, this insurance program
must include effective cost
controls and strong incentives for
changing the present system of
delivering health services.
Otherwise it will simply
stimulate higher costs like those
which have followed the
introduction of Medicaid and
Medicare.
Provision of health care
services should remain primarily
within the private sector with
greater public accountability.
Wherever possible individuals
should have a right to choose

among varied systems of health
care.
Until an effective system of
national health insurance with
cost controls becomes operative,
wage and price controls will be a
needed element in governmental
actions about health services.
These conclusions are reached
in a new book on Medical Care
and Medical Cure, edited by
Spyros Andreapoulas, information
officer at the Stanford Medical
Center.
Published by the Sun Valley
Forum on National Health and
the Millbank Memorial Fund, it
reflects the views of 33 experts
participating in last summer's
forum and includes six invited
papers on this topic.
Participants for the most part
were professors and health care
specialists. But they also came
from related professions, such as
sociology, economics, labor, and
insurance.
While recommending top
priority for a progam of national
health insurance, they emphasized
the need to preserve pluralism in
providing services mainly through
the private sector and to achieve
far-reaching changes within the
entire health care delivery system.
"If social policy is to concern
itself with financing health
services alone, and if doctors
continue to go along with the
public demand for curing the
incurable, they could bankrupt
the nation and succeed only in
supplying a constantly
deteriorating quality of service,"
Andreopoulos said.
The medical care industry now
involves between $80 and $85
billion annually, accounting for

about 7.7 percent of the gross
national product (GNP).
Projections by the Social
Security Administration indicate
costs are climbing at 10 to 15
percent annually, a trend which
would require 9.8 percent of the
GNP by 1980. '
"The resources devoted to
health services cannot be
unlimited," the symposium
participants agreed. : "These
resources must therefore be
organized and administered
effectively."
Present health care is
characterized by a high level of
scientific knowledge and
technological skill and health
professionals with a strong
commitment to high-caliber,
individual service.
But the system within which
physicians and others now operate
to provide care is "inefficient,
inequitable, and often
ineffective," the participants said.
"The quality of care rendered
varies widely and costs are rising
rapidly."
As government involvement in
the payment of medical care has
progressively deepened, demands
for public acountability have
increased under a growing vocal,
consumer movement.
"Because physicians dominate
the marketplace for medical
care . .. generally free of the
normal constraints imposed by
consumer demand, the sum of
their individual decisions, as to
type of specialty and site of
practice, very largely determines
the allocation of all health
resources," the symposium
agreed.
"This largely unconstructed

process has resulted in serious
maldistribution and misallocation
of resources. Sources of primary
or family care have been shrinking
even as the demand for personal
health care services has been
rising.
"In medical schools there has
been a heavy emphasis on medical
specialization and biomedical
research and little attention to
health services researchâ€”or how
American families can be assisted
to find points of entry and
guidance through the health
delivery system," the symposium
concluded.
