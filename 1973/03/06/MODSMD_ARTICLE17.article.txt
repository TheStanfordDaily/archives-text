# Black September Terrorists Could Escape Punishment
## 
### Associated Press 
BEIRUT, Lebanon â€” If Black
September runs true to form, the
guerrilla killers of three foreign
diplomats in Khartoum have a
better than even chance of
escaping punishment.
In a statement published in

Beirut, the Black September
organization said their eight-man
Khartoum squad surrendered to
Sudanese authorities "because of
the high esteem we hold" for
President Jaafar el Numairi of
Sudan.
"We leave them in trust in his

hands," the statement said. "We
are confident they will be treated
as true revolutionary fighters."
While expecting that the killers
of U.S. Ambassador Cleo A. Noel
Jr., U.S. Charge d'Affaires G.
Curtis Moore and Belgian
diplomat Guy Eid might go on
trial in Sudan, Palestinian sources
believe the courts will be lenient.
Nunairi has condemned the
slayings as a "vile deed," but the
guerrillas' surrender poses an ugly
dilemma for him.
American opinion obviously
will be troubled if he is soft on
the gunmen. But he takes a tough
line, he risks anger and perhaps
further violence from the
Palestinian guerrilla movement
and his Arab neighbors.
Numairi's relations with Egypt
already have been strained by his
dismissal last year of pro-Egyptian
ministers in his Cabinet. His
dealings with Libya likewise were
toubled by his opposition to Col.
Muammar Kadafi's attempt to
intervene in Uganda, on Sudan's
southern border.
