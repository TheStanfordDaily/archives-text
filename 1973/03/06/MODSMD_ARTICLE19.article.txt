# San Francisco Symphony
## Gifted Fruehbeck Returns 
### DOUG SMITH 
San Francisco Symphony audiences were
treated to an unusual evening last week as
Raphael Fruehbeck de Burgos conducted,
together with a Haydn symphony, the
complete opera "La Vida Breve" by de Falla.
Maestro Fruehbeck (a Spaniard of German
parentage) was well received in his San
Francisco debut last year and has made a
triumphant return with this program.
The latest in the series of Haydn
symphonies performed here this season is
number 44, the "mourning" symphony. One of
the few that Haydn composed in the minor
mode, its somber character is aptly described
by its name. Especially the Adagio (third
movement!) is an exercise in nobly restrained
grief.
The orchestra responded very well to
Fruehbeck's precise conducting. He has an
annoying tendency to make very angular
motions, as though (as a colleague of mine
suggested) he were conducting under a strobe
light, but this was not reflected in the flow of
the music.
Manuel de Falla's seldom-heard opera "La
Vida Breve" was the real highlight of the
evening. In its brevity, its tragic theme and in
some of the vocal lines it is reminiscent of the
Italian "verismo" operas, but it also has many
very Spanish elements. The work was
presented in concert version, with only the

I
flamenco dancer in costume.
The libretto by Carlos Fernandez Shaw
concerns an Andalusian gypsy girl, Salud,
whose rich lover, Paco, leaves her to marry a
woman of his own class. Musically, the opera
is Salud's, with all the other figures having
little more than bit parts.
Sensational Gulin
Angeles Gulin was sensational in the
leading role, singing powerfully, both in
volume and expression. She was especially
adept with the Moorish ornaments which still
linger in Spanish folk music.
Donna Petersen as Salud's grandmother
and James Tippey as her Uncle Salvador were
fine. Anastasios Vrenios as Paco, particularly
when singing opposite Miss Gulin, was rather
outclassed. The chorus, at least on opening
night, was a bit ill at ease.
The opera is conceived as a drama in two
acts with two orchestral tableaux. In the
tableaux the orchestra paints impressionistic
pictures of the Spanish countryside and its
people in sound. ' Fruehbeck, who has
recorded the only currently available version
of this opera, conducted skillfully and was
more relaxed than in the Haydn. He was
obviously very much in his own element.
The beginning of the second act, the
wedding party at the house of Paco's bride,
features a flamenco singer with guitarist and a
dancer. Perico Sevilla gave a very intense

rendition of the singer's part, but the guitarist,
James Shryock, was uninspired.
Fiery Dancing
Lucera Tena virtually stole the show from
Miss Gulin with her fiery dancing. She is very
attractive, a virtuoso with castanets, and
dances so passionately that the stamping of
her feet can be heard well back in the concert
hall above the loudest orchestral passages. In a
staged version of the opera she would have
stood out less, but the score calls up so much
color that her bright red dress and flashy style
proved a welcome visual manifestation of it.
San Franciscans seem to be particularly
hospitable to visiting conductors, for they
rewarded Fruehbeck (and the singers and
dancer, of course) with a standing ovation.
The last time I heard a guest conductor here
(Kertesz), he received one as well. It seems to
me that a standing ovation is an acclaim to be
reserved for legendary performances and
ought not be awarded to every good
performance of a nationalist piece by a
national conductor. (Pop music audiences are
much less discriminating, commonly standing
and applauding any musician they have heard
of who leaves New York to come sing for
them.)
However, this minor objection aside, the
evening of music was thoroughly enjoyable.
Fruehbeck is a very talented conductor and I
hope he is asked back again next year.

the music.
Manuel de Falla's seldom-heard opera "La
Vida Breve" was the real highlight of the
evening. In its brevity, its tragic theme and in
some of the vocal lines it is reminiscent of the
Italian "verismo" operas, but it also has many
very Spanish elements. The work was
presented in concert version, with only the

I
flamenco dancer in costume.
The libretto by Carlos Fernandez Shaw
concerns an Andalusian gypsy girl, Salud,
whose rich lover, Paco, leaves her to marry a
woman of his own class. Musically, the opera
is Salud's, with all the other figures having
little more than bit parts.
Sensational Gulin
Angeles Gulin was sensational in the
leading role, singing powerfully, both in
volume and expression. She was especially
adept with the Moorish ornaments which still
linger in Spanish folk music.
Donna Petersen as Salud's grandmother
and James Tippey as her Uncle Salvador were
fine. Anastasios Vrenios as Paco, particularly
when singing opposite Miss Gulin, was rather
outclassed. The chorus, at least on opening
night, was a bit ill at ease.
The opera is conceived as a drama in two
acts with two orchestral tableaux. In the
tableaux the orchestra paints impressionistic
pictures of the Spanish countryside and its
people in sound. ' Fruehbeck, who has
recorded the only currently available version
of this opera, conducted skillfully and was
more relaxed than in the Haydn. He was
obviously very much in his own element.
The beginning of the second act, the
wedding party at the house of Paco's bride,
features a flamenco singer with guitarist and a
dancer. Perico Sevilla gave a very intense

rendition of the singer's part, but the guitarist,
James Shryock, was uninspired.
Fiery Dancing
Lucera Tena virtually stole the show from
Miss Gulin with her fiery dancing. She is very
attractive, a virtuoso with castanets, and
dances so passionately that the stamping of
her feet can be heard well back in the concert
hall above the loudest orchestral passages. In a
staged version of the opera she would have
stood out less, but the score calls up so much
color that her bright red dress and flashy style
proved a welcome visual manifestation of it.
San Franciscans seem to be particularly
hospitable to visiting conductors, for they
rewarded Fruehbeck (and the singers and
dancer, of course) with a standing ovation.
The last time I heard a guest conductor here
(Kertesz), he received one as well. It seems to
me that a standing ovation is an acclaim to be
reserved for legendary performances and
ought not be awarded to every good
performance of a nationalist piece by a
national conductor. (Pop music audiences are
much less discriminating, commonly standing
and applauding any musician they have heard
of who leaves New York to come sing for
them.)
However, this minor objection aside, the
evening of music was thoroughly enjoyable.
Fruehbeck is a very talented conductor and I
hope he is asked back again next year.
San Francisco Symphony audiences were
treated to an unusual evening last week as
Raphael Fruehbeck de Burgos conducted,
together with a Haydn symphony, the
complete opera "La Vida Breve" by de Falla.
Maestro Fruehbeck (a Spaniard of German
parentage) was well received in his San
Francisco debut last year and has made a
triumphant return with this program.
The latest in the series of Haydn
symphonies performed here this season is
number 44, the "mourning" symphony. One of
the few that Haydn composed in the minor
mode, its somber character is aptly described
by its name. Especially the Adagio (third
movement!) is an exercise in nobly restrained
grief.
The orchestra responded very well to
Fruehbeck's precise conducting. He has an
annoying tendency to make very angular
motions, as though (as a colleague of mine
suggested) he were conducting under a strobe
light, but this was not reflected in the flow of
the music.
