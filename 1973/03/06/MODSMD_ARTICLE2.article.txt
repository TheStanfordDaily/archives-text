# McCloskey Forbidden To Testify On Document Classification Policy
## 
### ED KOHN Special to the Daily 
LOS ANGELES â€” The presiding judge
in the "Pentagon Papers" trial
yesterday refused to permit Rep. Paul
N. McCloskey Jr. (R.-Portola Valley)
to testify about government document
classification policies.
Presiding Judge Matt Byme Jr.
rejected defense attorney Charles
Nesson's argument that he be allowed
to question McCloskey about
classification as part of a "defense of
justification."
By refusing to allow Nesson to
persue that line of questioning, Byrne
may have precluded further defense
efforts to show that Daniel Ellsberg
and Anthony J. Russo Jr. copied the
documents specifically to give them to
Congress. The defense contends that
the pair acted lawfully in attempting

to bring the studies to Congress'
attention.
In an unusual hand-written "offer
of proof," which Byrne rejected,
McCloskey argued that "the right of
Congress to know and receive
information from the executive branch
is not affected by classification of
information within the executive
branch ... Such classification is
created only by executive order and
applies only to the executive branch of
government."
McCloskey's request to be heard
continued by alleging that the Defense
Department's refusal to send copies of
the "Papers" to Congress "endangered
the security of the United States by
preventing Congress from knowing the
truth."
'Reasonable Steps'
He concluded that "a person

coming into possession of the
'Pentagon Papers'.. . was entitled to
take reasonable steps to accomplish
the delivery of information to the
Congress.... The delivery of such
information to Sen. William Fulbright
in his capacity as Chairman of the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee
was such a reasonable step."
A former Marine who gave up his
reserve commission only months ago,
McCloskey is one of the strongest
Republican opponents of the
Indochinese war in the House of
Representatives. He ran against
President Nixon in the New Hampshire
primary last spring and received 20
percent of the vote.
The defense had intended to
present McCloskey as a classification
expert because of his position as
Chairman of the House Subcommittee

on Foreign Operations and
Government Information. That
subcommittee conducted lengthy
hearings into the "Pentagon Papers"
and presently is engaged in an
extensive review of government
classification policies and procedures.
However, Byrne limited
McCloskey's testimony to matters
other than classification policies.
Friday, McCloskey testified that
the release of one volume of the
"Papers" did not damage the national
defense and could not have been "of
advantage" to a foreign nation.
Testimony Stricken
Yesterday, McCloskey told the
stunned court,"I think it is prejudicial
to the interest of the United States
that the Department of Defense did
not make the document public in
1969." Byme immediately stopped
McCloskey's answer and ordered that
it be stricken from the record.
Most of yesterday's session was
devoted to a lengthy cross
examination by chief prosecutor David
Nissen. Over strenuous defense
objections, Nissen recapitulated
McCloskey's military experiences
several times, but seemed unable to
shake the Congressman's previous
testimony. After his cross
examiniation was complete,
McCloskey stepped out of the witness
chair and shook Nissen's hand.
