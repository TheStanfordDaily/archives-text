# Renata Tebaldi:
## All Frosting And No Cake 
### BRUCE LAMOTT 
Soprano Renata Tebaldi gave
little evidence of the artistry
associated with her name in a solo
recital in the Opera House
Thursday night. A singer with
almost legendary reputation, "the
Queen of Italian Opera" (thus
titled by her recording company)

sang a trivial program redeemed
neither by exceptional musicality
nor captivating dramatic presence.
Though credited with
recordings of no less than
twenty-one operas, she virtually
ignored this repertoire in favor of
deservingly little-heard works by
Bellini, Donizetti, and Verdi as

well as less notable Italian
composers. Most of the literature
was more appropriate to the
teaching studio than the concert
stage.
Faltering intonation marked
"O cessate di piagarmi" by A.
Scarlatti, a languid composition
poorly chosen to open the recital.

Unfortunately, the Classic and
"bel canto" selections which
followed also showed the mark of
a declining vocal technique. It
would have been far more
advantageous to the artist if the
programming had not been
chronological.
In both "O del mio dolce
ardor" by Gluck and Pergolesi's
"Se tu m'ami," Tebaldi's
unmodulated vocal registers
resulted in an undesirable dialogue
of timbres. Her tone quality was
much more dependent on its place
in her range than on a deliberate
"orchestration" of the voice for
musical or dramatic effect.
Distorted Flow
The upper voice is tight,
throaty and strident in contrast to
the loveliness of her flexible
middle range. A heavy chest voice
also distorted the flow of the
melodic line in lower registers.
Breathy articulations of
passage-work further evidenced a
technical decline.
One might expect that her
dramatic capabilities might
compensate for these musical
losses, but this certainly was not
the case with the Beethoven "Ah!
Perfido." Singing this scene and
aria with fixed gaze and deliberate
stylized gesture which negated the
passionate intensity of the text,
she seemed preoccupied with
unmet musical demands. Perhaps
it was wishful thinking which
brought on premature applause
between sections of this work.
Traces of the Tebaldi reknown
were evidenced by the delicate
Puccini song, "E L'uccellino."
Here the fluid lyricism of her
middle register captured the ear,
complemented by the sensitive
accompaniment of pianist Marvin
Katz. Unhappily, it was the only
Puccini selection on the program.
Mascagni's aria, "Flammen,
perdonami" demonstrated an
unparalleled dramatic intensity,
merging vocal technique, gesture,
and declamation into a
long-awaited cohesion. This
suggested her mastery of the
operatic repertoire, which her
listeners were undoubtedly
applauding more than this
performance.
"Serenata Veneziana" by
Arturo Buzzi-Peccia allowed Miss
Tebaldi a good joke with the
audience, but his concluding
"Serenata Spagnola" is a colorless,
banal piece. Followed by a few
equally nondescript encores, one
was left with the taste of all
frosting and no cake.

the loveliness of her flexible
middle range. A heavy chest voice
also distorted the flow of the
melodic line in lower registers.
Breathy articulations of
passage-work further evidenced a
technical decline.
One might expect that her
dramatic capabilities might
compensate for these musical
losses, but this certainly was not
the case with the Beethoven "Ah!
Perfido." Singing this scene and
aria with fixed gaze and deliberate
stylized gesture which negated the
passionate intensity of the text,
she seemed preoccupied with
unmet musical demands. Perhaps
it was wishful thinking which
brought on premature applause
between sections of this work.
Traces of the Tebaldi reknown
were evidenced by the delicate
Puccini song, "E L'uccellino."
Here the fluid lyricism of her
middle register captured the ear,
complemented by the sensitive
accompaniment of pianist Marvin
Katz. Unhappily, it was the only
Puccini selection on the program.
Mascagni's aria, "Flammen,
perdonami" demonstrated an
unparalleled dramatic intensity,
merging vocal technique, gesture,
and declamation into a
long-awaited cohesion. This
suggested her mastery of the
operatic repertoire, which her
listeners were undoubtedly
applauding more than this
performance.
"Serenata Veneziana" by
Arturo Buzzi-Peccia allowed Miss
Tebaldi a good joke with the
audience, but his concluding
"Serenata Spagnola" is a colorless,
banal piece. Followed by a few
equally nondescript encores, one
was left with the taste of all
frosting and no cake.
Soprano Renata Tebaldi gave
little evidence of the artistry
associated with her name in a solo
recital in the Opera House
Thursday night. A singer with
almost legendary reputation, "the
Queen of Italian Opera" (thus
titled by her recording company)

sang a trivial program redeemed
neither by exceptional musicality
nor captivating dramatic presence.
Though credited with
recordings of no less than
twenty-one operas, she virtually
ignored this repertoire in favor of
deservingly little-heard works by
Bellini, Donizetti, and Verdi as

well as less notable Italian
composers. Most of the literature
was more appropriate to the
teaching studio than the concert
stage.
Faltering intonation marked
"O cessate di piagarmi" by A.
Scarlatti, a languid composition
poorly chosen to open the recital.

Unfortunately, the Classic and
"bel canto" selections which
followed also showed the mark of
a declining vocal technique. It
would have been far more
advantageous to the artist if the
programming had not been
chronological.
In both "O del mio dolce
ardor" by Gluck and Pergolesi's
"Se tu m'ami," Tebaldi's
unmodulated vocal registers
resulted in an undesirable dialogue
of timbres. Her tone quality was
much more dependent on its place
in her range than on a deliberate
"orchestration" of the voice for
musical or dramatic effect.
Distorted Flow
The upper voice is tight,
throaty and strident in contrast to
the loveliness of her flexible
middle range. A heavy chest voice
also distorted the flow of the
melodic line in lower registers.
Breathy articulations of
passage-work further evidenced a
technical decline.
