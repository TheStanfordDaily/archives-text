# Alea II Performs Tonight
## 
### 
Alea 11, Stanford's new music ensemble, with
guest artists Margaret Fabrizio, harpsichord, Julie
Steinberg, piano, and Joseph Kubera, organ, will
present a concert tonight in Memorial Church.
Martin Bresnick and Michael Andrews, both
members of the Stanford music faculty, are the
codirectors of Alea 11.
The program includes "Sederunt" (1198), by
Magister Perotinus; "Mass for the Poor" (1895), by
Erik Satie; "Vingt Regards sur L'Enfant Jesuit'
(1944), by Oliver Messiaen; "Armistice" (1965), by
Sydney Hodkinson, and "Fusion" (1973), by Jason
Paras.
Miss Fabrizio is featured with Paras in his work
for harpsichord and guitar. A member of the
Stanford music faculty, Fabrizio is also a
widely-known performer of both baroque and
contemporary keyboard music.
Paras, a Stanford senior, studied composition
here with Theodore Antoniou and Leland Smith.
His "Pinnacle" for alto saxophone won the Music
Department's undergraduate composition prize in
1972.

Hodkinson's "Armistice," subtitled "a truce for
dancers and musicians," was choreographed by Alea
II member Martha Dee. Jason Klein will conduct.
The composer is a faculty member and conductor of
the Contemporary Directions Ensemble at the
University of Michigan.
"Mass for the Poor" is mostly for organ alone.
Guest organist Joseph Kubera is well known locally
for his performances of new music, particularly the
works of Satie.
The medieval work "Sederunt," by Perotin, was
"new music" in its time being a four-part organum
composed for performance in the newly-constructed
Notre Dame cathedral. Perotin wrote the only two
surviving examples of four-part organum, the form
that represented a high point in early polyphonic
music.
Miss Steinberg is a Stanford doctoral candidate in
contemporary performance practice.
The performance begins at 8 p.m. Admission is
free.

(1944), by Oliver Messiaen; "Armistice" (1965), by
Sydney Hodkinson, and "Fusion" (1973), by Jason
Paras.
Miss Fabrizio is featured with Paras in his work
for harpsichord and guitar. A member of the
Stanford music faculty, Fabrizio is also a
widely-known performer of both baroque and
contemporary keyboard music.
Paras, a Stanford senior, studied composition
here with Theodore Antoniou and Leland Smith.
His "Pinnacle" for alto saxophone won the Music
Department's undergraduate composition prize in
1972.

Hodkinson's "Armistice," subtitled "a truce for
dancers and musicians," was choreographed by Alea
II member Martha Dee. Jason Klein will conduct.
The composer is a faculty member and conductor of
the Contemporary Directions Ensemble at the
University of Michigan.
"Mass for the Poor" is mostly for organ alone.
Guest organist Joseph Kubera is well known locally
for his performances of new music, particularly the
works of Satie.
The medieval work "Sederunt," by Perotin, was
"new music" in its time being a four-part organum
composed for performance in the newly-constructed
Notre Dame cathedral. Perotin wrote the only two
surviving examples of four-part organum, the form
that represented a high point in early polyphonic
music.
Miss Steinberg is a Stanford doctoral candidate in
contemporary performance practice.
The performance begins at 8 p.m. Admission is
free.
