Indians Ignore Federal Offer
WOUNDED KNEE, S.D. - The Indians holding
Wounded Knee ignored a government offer to
evacuate the village yesterday, but said they were
"holding the offer in abeyance."
A scheduled parley in a Sioux tepee near
Wounded Knee was delayed several hours while the
Indians, who took over the village last Tuesday,
drew up new counterproposals.
Attorney William Kunstler, who is working with
American Indian Movement leaders in Wounded
Knee, said the new demands included an option to
purchase the 40-acre site of a historic battle in
1890.
AIM leaders also amended their previous demand
that the scores of federal agents surrounding the
village withdraw before the Indians leave. The
Indians said the marshals and FBI men may stay or
leave, but the Indians want protection from Richard
Wilson, president of the 13,000-member Oglala
Sioux tribe, most of whom reside in the Pine Ridge
Reservation. Wounded Knee is located on the
reservation.
The federal offer provided that Indians quit the
village without their weapons, the males identifying
themselves as they passed through federal lines, but
that no mass arrests would be made until a special
grand jury investigation. The Indians burned the
written offer late Sunday.
Carter Camp, an AIM leader, said the Indians
would not consider abandoning Wounded Knee
until negotiations were settled on their allegations
of corruption in Wilson's administration, the Bureau
of Indian Affairs and fiscal affairs at Pine Ridge.
Bodies Returned To U.S.
WASHINGTON - The bodies of two murdered
American diplomats were returned yesterday to a
rainswept capitol aboard a presidential jet that
carried them from Khartoum.
A military honor guard and a 19-gun salute lent
high drama to the brief ceremony attended by
Secretary of State William P. Rogers and about 500
state department colleagues.
The diplomats, Ambassador Cleo A. Noel Jr., 54,
and his deputy, G. Curtis Moore, 50, were slain
Friday by Black September Palestinian guerrillas in
the Saudi Arabian Embassy in Khartoum, the
Sudanese capitol.
The assassins are in the hands of Sudanese
authorities, with their ultimate fate still to be
resolved.
At Khartoum, a band softly played Auld Lang
Syne as the coffins of the two diplomats were lifted
aboard the plane.
President Jaafar el Numairi assigned the minister
of reform to accompany the two American bodies
to Washington. The president was not present for
the departure, made without ceremony under a
Sudanese flag hanging over the airport at half staff.

Numairi has indicated the guerrillas will be dealt
with severely. But reluctance to break Arab
solidarity against Israel may pose problems in
handling their case.
34 More POWs Freed
CLARK AIR BASE, Philippines - Thirty-four
cautiously smiling war prisoners, including a
German nurse, arrived to a cheering welcome here
yesterday after being released by the Viet Cong in
Hanoi.
Another 106 American POWs freed Sunday by
North Vietnam were speeding through medical
checks heading toward a possible flight home
tomorrow to the United States.
The chalky-faced prisoners released by the Viet
Cong were in noticeably poorer shape. One was
hauled in a litter from the plane that ferried them in
from Hanoi. Another hobbled off on crutches. The
left arm of a third appeared to dangle limply at his
side.
But their joy was evident as they joined those
released Sunday in enjoying the small pleasures of
life denied them in prison. They gobbled down
steak and eggs, telephoned their families back home
and tinkered with their hospital television sets.
The latest POWs included 27 Marine and Army
men, 3 U.S. civilians, a German nurse and medical
student captured at a charity mission and two
Filipino employees of the Voice of America.
All were captured by guerrillas in South Vietnam
and this was believed to account for the difference
in their condition.
Coeds 1 Remains Identified
PACIFICA — A skull and two jawbones found near
the ocean were identified yesterday as remains of
two slain coeds from the University of California at
Santa Cruz whose headless bodies were discovered
25 miles away, a coroner said.
Dental charts showed the skull was that of
Rosalind Thorpe, 24, of Carmel, and the jawbones
were those of Alice Liu, 21, Torrance, the San
Mateo County coroner's office said.
The girls' bodies, one nude and one clothed, were
found near a roadbed in Castro Valley on Feb. 15,
about 10 days after they disappeared from the
Santa Cruz campus. Authorities have not
determined how the girls were killed.
The skull and jawbones were found Sunday by
two boys on an outing in the Devil's Slide area.
French Leftists Launch Drive
PARIS — French Communists and Socialists,
maintaining tight discipline, launched an all-out
attack yesterday to wrest control of the National
Assembly from the Gaullists in next Sunday's
decisive round of voting.
Communist chieftain Georges Marchais and
Francois Mitterrand, leader of the Socialists, met to
assess results of Sunday's first stage voting. With

them was Robert Fabre, radical leftist leader who is
their minor ally in the leftist coalition.
They decided to maintain their pre-election
pledge to throw their combined weight in the
second round behind whichever of their candidates
was leading in the first.
Of 490 seats in the new Assembly, only 59 were
filled on Sunday. The Gaullist coalition won 50, far
below their first round total of 144 in the 1968
elections.
The leftists got nine, slightly better than their
showing of six seats last time.
This meant that while many Frenchmen were
disenchanted with the government, they had not yet
made up their mind to put the leftists in power.
One additional reason for the seemingly poor
showing of the left was that the three allies were
running candidates separately, each party seeking to
get as many seats for itself as possible. The
Communists won eight, the Socialists one.
In the runoff the leading leftist candidate in each
district will be supported by the other parties.
Next POW Releases: No Delays
SAIGON — The Viet Cong delegation said yesterday
an impasse in the exchange of Vietnamese prisoners
would not hold up the next release of American
POWs, although it threatens to delay the
peace-keeping efforts of the four-party Joint
Military Commission, which expires in less than a
month.
Asked if a threatened boycott of the commission
would affect release of American prisoners, Capt.
Phuong Nam, press attache of the Viet Cong
delegation, said: "No, the two questions are
different. The release of Vietnamese POWs has not
made any progress but the release of U.S. and allied
military and civilian prisoners is working. I see no
problem on the next release."
A U.S. delegation spokesman also foresaw no
complications.
The U.S. spokesman said that the North
Vietnamese foreign minister, Nguyen Duy Trinh,
had assured Secretary of State William P. Rogers in
Paris last week that all American prisoners would be
released by the specified deadline, March 28.
He said there need not be formal meetings of the
commission to arrange for the release of the 286
American prisoners still in Communist hands. North
Vietnam and the Viet Cong have released 299
American prisoners in the first two batches, and
there are two more scheduled.
Today's Weather
Chance of a little rain this morning becoming partly
cloudy this afternoon and tonight. Increasing clouds
tomorrow with chance of rain again. Little
temperature change. Low tonight in the 40s. Highs
today in the 50s. Variable wind 5 to 15 mph
becoming westerly today. Chance of rain 40 percent
today.

President Jaafar el Numairi assigned the minister
of reform to accompany the two American bodies
to Washington. The president was not present for
the departure, made without ceremony under a
Sudanese flag hanging over the airport at half staff.

Numairi has indicated the guerrillas will be dealt
with severely. But reluctance to break Arab
solidarity against Israel may pose problems in
handling their case.
34 More POWs Freed
CLARK AIR BASE, Philippines - Thirty-four
cautiously smiling war prisoners, including a
German nurse, arrived to a cheering welcome here
yesterday after being released by the Viet Cong in
Hanoi.
Another 106 American POWs freed Sunday by
North Vietnam were speeding through medical
checks heading toward a possible flight home
tomorrow to the United States.
The chalky-faced prisoners released by the Viet
Cong were in noticeably poorer shape. One was
hauled in a litter from the plane that ferried them in
from Hanoi. Another hobbled off on crutches. The
left arm of a third appeared to dangle limply at his
side.
But their joy was evident as they joined those
released Sunday in enjoying the small pleasures of
life denied them in prison. They gobbled down
steak and eggs, telephoned their families back home
and tinkered with their hospital television sets.
The latest POWs included 27 Marine and Army
men, 3 U.S. civilians, a German nurse and medical
student captured at a charity mission and two
Filipino employees of the Voice of America.
All were captured by guerrillas in South Vietnam
and this was believed to account for the difference
in their condition.
Coeds 1 Remains Identified
PACIFICA — A skull and two jawbones found near
the ocean were identified yesterday as remains of
two slain coeds from the University of California at
Santa Cruz whose headless bodies were discovered
25 miles away, a coroner said.
Dental charts showed the skull was that of
Rosalind Thorpe, 24, of Carmel, and the jawbones
were those of Alice Liu, 21, Torrance, the San
Mateo County coroner's office said.
The girls' bodies, one nude and one clothed, were
found near a roadbed in Castro Valley on Feb. 15,
about 10 days after they disappeared from the
Santa Cruz campus. Authorities have not
determined how the girls were killed.
The skull and jawbones were found Sunday by
two boys on an outing in the Devil's Slide area.
French Leftists Launch Drive
PARIS — French Communists and Socialists,
maintaining tight discipline, launched an all-out
attack yesterday to wrest control of the National
Assembly from the Gaullists in next Sunday's
decisive round of voting.
Communist chieftain Georges Marchais and
Francois Mitterrand, leader of the Socialists, met to
assess results of Sunday's first stage voting. With

them was Robert Fabre, radical leftist leader who is
their minor ally in the leftist coalition.
They decided to maintain their pre-election
pledge to throw their combined weight in the
second round behind whichever of their candidates
was leading in the first.
Of 490 seats in the new Assembly, only 59 were
filled on Sunday. The Gaullist coalition won 50, far
below their first round total of 144 in the 1968
elections.
The leftists got nine, slightly better than their
showing of six seats last time.
This meant that while many Frenchmen were
disenchanted with the government, they had not yet
made up their mind to put the leftists in power.
One additional reason for the seemingly poor
showing of the left was that the three allies were
running candidates separately, each party seeking to
get as many seats for itself as possible. The
Communists won eight, the Socialists one.
In the runoff the leading leftist candidate in each
district will be supported by the other parties.
Next POW Releases: No Delays
SAIGON — The Viet Cong delegation said yesterday
an impasse in the exchange of Vietnamese prisoners
would not hold up the next release of American
POWs, although it threatens to delay the
peace-keeping efforts of the four-party Joint
Military Commission, which expires in less than a
month.
Asked if a threatened boycott of the commission
would affect release of American prisoners, Capt.
Phuong Nam, press attache of the Viet Cong
delegation, said: "No, the two questions are
different. The release of Vietnamese POWs has not
made any progress but the release of U.S. and allied
military and civilian prisoners is working. I see no
problem on the next release."
A U.S. delegation spokesman also foresaw no
complications.
The U.S. spokesman said that the North
Vietnamese foreign minister, Nguyen Duy Trinh,
had assured Secretary of State William P. Rogers in
Paris last week that all American prisoners would be
released by the specified deadline, March 28.
He said there need not be formal meetings of the
commission to arrange for the release of the 286
American prisoners still in Communist hands. North
Vietnam and the Viet Cong have released 299
American prisoners in the first two batches, and
there are two more scheduled.
Today's Weather
Chance of a little rain this morning becoming partly
cloudy this afternoon and tonight. Increasing clouds

becoming westerly today. Chance of rain 40 percent
today.
Indians Ignore Federal Offer
WOUNDED KNEE, S.D. - The Indians holding
Wounded Knee ignored a government offer to
evacuate the village yesterday, but said they were
"holding the offer in abeyance."
A scheduled parley in a Sioux tepee near
Wounded Knee was delayed several hours while the
Indians, who took over the village last Tuesday,
drew up new counterproposals.
Attorney William Kunstler, who is working with
American Indian Movement leaders in Wounded
Knee, said the new demands included an option to
purchase the 40-acre site of a historic battle in
1890.
AIM leaders also amended their previous demand
that the scores of federal agents surrounding the
village withdraw before the Indians leave. The
Indians said the marshals and FBI men may stay or
leave, but the Indians want protection from Richard
Wilson, president of the 13,000-member Oglala
Sioux tribe, most of whom reside in the Pine Ridge
Reservation. Wounded Knee is located on the
reservation.
The federal offer provided that Indians quit the
village without their weapons, the males identifying
themselves as they passed through federal lines, but
that no mass arrests would be made until a special
grand jury investigation. The Indians burned the
written offer late Sunday.
Carter Camp, an AIM leader, said the Indians
would not consider abandoning Wounded Knee
until negotiations were settled on their allegations
of corruption in Wilson's administration, the Bureau
of Indian Affairs and fiscal affairs at Pine Ridge.
Bodies Returned To U.S.
WASHINGTON - The bodies of two murdered
American diplomats were returned yesterday to a
rainswept capitol aboard a presidential jet that
carried them from Khartoum.
A military honor guard and a 19-gun salute lent
high drama to the brief ceremony attended by
Secretary of State William P. Rogers and about 500
state department colleagues.
The diplomats, Ambassador Cleo A. Noel Jr., 54,
and his deputy, G. Curtis Moore, 50, were slain
Friday by Black September Palestinian guerrillas in
the Saudi Arabian Embassy in Khartoum, the
Sudanese capitol.
The assassins are in the hands of Sudanese
authorities, with their ultimate fate still to be
resolved.
At Khartoum, a band softly played Auld Lang
Syne as the coffins of the two diplomats were lifted
aboard the plane.
President Jaafar el Numairi assigned the minister
of reform to accompany the two American bodies
to Washington. The president was not present for

French Leftists Launch Drive
PARIS — French Communists and Socialists,
maintaining tight discipline, launched an all-out
attack yesterday to wrest control of the National
Assembly from the Gaullists in next Sunday's
decisive round of voting.
Communist chieftain Georges Marchais and
Francois Mitterrand, leader of the Socialists, met to
assess results of Sunday's first stage voting. With

them was Robert Fabre, radical leftist leader who is
their minor ally in the leftist coalition.
They decided to maintain their pre-election
pledge to throw their combined weight in the
second round behind whichever of their candidates
was leading in the first.
Of 490 seats in the new Assembly, only 59 were
filled on Sunday. The Gaullist coalition won 50, far
below their first round total of 144 in the 1968
elections.
The leftists got nine, slightly better than their
showing of six seats last time.
This meant that while many Frenchmen were
disenchanted with the government, they had not yet
made up their mind to put the leftists in power.
One additional reason for the seemingly poor
showing of the left was that the three allies were
running candidates separately, each party seeking to
get as many seats for itself as possible. The
Communists won eight, the Socialists one.
In the runoff the leading leftist candidate in each
district will be supported by the other parties.
Next POW Releases: No Delays
SAIGON — The Viet Cong delegation said yesterday
an impasse in the exchange of Vietnamese prisoners
would not hold up the next release of American
POWs, although it threatens to delay the
peace-keeping efforts of the four-party Joint
Military Commission, which expires in less than a
month.
Asked if a threatened boycott of the commission
would affect release of American prisoners, Capt.
Phuong Nam, press attache of the Viet Cong
delegation, said: "No, the two questions are
different. The release of Vietnamese POWs has not
made any progress but the release of U.S. and allied
military and civilian prisoners is working. I see no
problem on the next release."
A U.S. delegation spokesman also foresaw no
complications.
The U.S. spokesman said that the North
Vietnamese foreign minister, Nguyen Duy Trinh,
had assured Secretary of State William P. Rogers in
Paris last week that all American prisoners would be
released by the specified deadline, March 28.
He said there need not be formal meetings of the
commission to arrange for the release of the 286
American prisoners still in Communist hands. North
Vietnam and the Viet Cong have released 299
American prisoners in the first two batches, and
there are two more scheduled.
Today's Weather
Chance of a little rain this morning becoming partly
cloudy this afternoon and tonight. Increasing clouds
tomorrow with chance of rain again. Little
temperature change. Low tonight in the 40s. Highs
today in the 50s. Variable wind 5 to 15 mph
becoming westerly today. Chance of rain 40 percent
today.
Indians Ignore Federal Offer
WOUNDED KNEE, S.D. - The Indians holding
Wounded Knee ignored a government offer to
evacuate the village yesterday, but said they were
"holding the offer in abeyance."
A scheduled parley in a Sioux tepee near
Wounded Knee was delayed several hours while the
Indians, who took over the village last Tuesday,
drew up new counterproposals.
Attorney William Kunstler, who is working with
American Indian Movement leaders in Wounded
Knee, said the new demands included an option to
purchase the 40-acre site of a historic battle in
1890.
AIM leaders also amended their previous demand
that the scores of federal agents surrounding the
village withdraw before the Indians leave. The
Indians said the marshals and FBI men may stay or
leave, but the Indians want protection from Richard
Wilson, president of the 13,000-member Oglala
Sioux tribe, most of whom reside in the Pine Ridge
Reservation. Wounded Knee is located on the
reservation.
The federal offer provided that Indians quit the
village without their weapons, the males identifying
themselves as they passed through federal lines, but
that no mass arrests would be made until a special
grand jury investigation. The Indians burned the
written offer late Sunday.
Carter Camp, an AIM leader, said the Indians
would not consider abandoning Wounded Knee
until negotiations were settled on their allegations
of corruption in Wilson's administration, the Bureau
of Indian Affairs and fiscal affairs at Pine Ridge.
Bodies Returned To U.S.
WASHINGTON - The bodies of two murdered
American diplomats were returned yesterday to a
rainswept capitol aboard a presidential jet that
carried them from Khartoum.
A military honor guard and a 19-gun salute lent
high drama to the brief ceremony attended by
Secretary of State William P. Rogers and about 500
state department colleagues.
The diplomats, Ambassador Cleo A. Noel Jr., 54,
and his deputy, G. Curtis Moore, 50, were slain
Friday by Black September Palestinian guerrillas in
the Saudi Arabian Embassy in Khartoum, the
Sudanese capitol.
The assassins are in the hands of Sudanese
authorities, with their ultimate fate still to be
resolved.
At Khartoum, a band softly played Auld Lang
Syne as the coffins of the two diplomats were lifted
aboard the plane.
President Jaafar el Numairi assigned the minister
of reform to accompany the two American bodies
to Washington. The president was not present for
the departure, made without ceremony under a
Sudanese flag hanging over the airport at half staff.

Numairi has indicated the guerrillas will be dealt
with severely. But reluctance to break Arab
solidarity against Israel may pose problems in
handling their case.
34 More POWs Freed
CLARK AIR BASE, Philippines - Thirty-four
cautiously smiling war prisoners, including a
German nurse, arrived to a cheering welcome here
yesterday after being released by the Viet Cong in
Hanoi.
Another 106 American POWs freed Sunday by
North Vietnam were speeding through medical
checks heading toward a possible flight home
tomorrow to the United States.
The chalky-faced prisoners released by the Viet
Cong were in noticeably poorer shape. One was
hauled in a litter from the plane that ferried them in
from Hanoi. Another hobbled off on crutches. The
left arm of a third appeared to dangle limply at his
side.
But their joy was evident as they joined those
released Sunday in enjoying the small pleasures of
life denied them in prison. They gobbled down
steak and eggs, telephoned their families back home
and tinkered with their hospital television sets.
The latest POWs included 27 Marine and Army
men, 3 U.S. civilians, a German nurse and medical
student captured at a charity mission and two
Filipino employees of the Voice of America.
All were captured by guerrillas in South Vietnam
and this was believed to account for the difference
in their condition.
Coeds 1 Remains Identified
PACIFICA — A skull and two jawbones found near
the ocean were identified yesterday as remains of
two slain coeds from the University of California at
Santa Cruz whose headless bodies were discovered
25 miles away, a coroner said.
Dental charts showed the skull was that of
Rosalind Thorpe, 24, of Carmel, and the jawbones
were those of Alice Liu, 21, Torrance, the San
Mateo County coroner's office said.
The girls' bodies, one nude and one clothed, were
found near a roadbed in Castro Valley on Feb. 15,
about 10 days after they disappeared from the
Santa Cruz campus. Authorities have not
determined how the girls were killed.
The skull and jawbones were found Sunday by
two boys on an outing in the Devil's Slide area.

had assured Secretary of State William P. Rogers in
Paris last week that all American prisoners would be
released by the specified deadline, March 28.
He said there need not be formal meetings of the
commission to arrange for the release of the 286
American prisoners still in Communist hands. North
Vietnam and the Viet Cong have released 299
American prisoners in the first two batches, and
there are two more scheduled.

Indians Ignore Federal Offer
WOUNDED KNEE, S.D. - The Indians holding
Wounded Knee ignored a government offer to
evacuate the village yesterday, but said they were
"holding the offer in abeyance."
A scheduled parley in a Sioux tepee near
Wounded Knee was delayed several hours while the
Indians, who took over the village last Tuesday,
drew up new counterproposals.
Attorney William Kunstler, who is working with
American Indian Movement leaders in Wounded
Knee, said the new demands included an option to
purchase the 40-acre site of a historic battle in
1890.
AIM leaders also amended their previous demand
that the scores of federal agents surrounding the
village withdraw before the Indians leave. The
Indians said the marshals and FBI men may stay or
leave, but the Indians want protection from Richard
Wilson, president of the 13,000-member Oglala
Sioux tribe, most of whom reside in the Pine Ridge
Reservation. Wounded Knee is located on the
reservation.
The federal offer provided that Indians quit the
village without their weapons, the males identifying
themselves as they passed through federal lines, but
that no mass arrests would be made until a special
grand jury investigation. The Indians burned the
written offer late Sunday.
Carter Camp, an AIM leader, said the Indians
would not consider abandoning Wounded Knee
until negotiations were settled on their allegations
of corruption in Wilson's administration, the Bureau
of Indian Affairs and fiscal affairs at Pine Ridge.
Bodies Returned To U.S.
WASHINGTON - The bodies of two murdered
American diplomats were returned yesterday to a
rainswept capitol aboard a presidential jet that
carried them from Khartoum.
A military honor guard and a 19-gun salute lent
high drama to the brief ceremony attended by
Secretary of State William P. Rogers and about 500
state department colleagues.
The diplomats, Ambassador Cleo A. Noel Jr., 54,
and his deputy, G. Curtis Moore, 50, were slain
Friday by Black September Palestinian guerrillas in
the Saudi Arabian Embassy in Khartoum, the
Sudanese capitol.
The assassins are in the hands of Sudanese
authorities, with their ultimate fate still to be
resolved.
At Khartoum, a band softly played Auld Lang
Syne as the coffins of the two diplomats were lifted
aboard the plane.
President Jaafar el Numairi assigned the minister
of reform to accompany the two American bodies
to Washington. The president was not present for
the departure, made without ceremony under a
Sudanese flag hanging over the airport at half staff.

Numairi has indicated the guerrillas will be dealt
with severely. But reluctance to break Arab
solidarity against Israel may pose problems in
handling their case.
34 More POWs Freed
CLARK AIR BASE, Philippines - Thirty-four
cautiously smiling war prisoners, including a
German nurse, arrived to a cheering welcome here
yesterday after being released by the Viet Cong in
Hanoi.
Another 106 American POWs freed Sunday by
North Vietnam were speeding through medical
checks heading toward a possible flight home
tomorrow to the United States.
The chalky-faced prisoners released by the Viet
Cong were in noticeably poorer shape. One was
hauled in a litter from the plane that ferried them in
from Hanoi. Another hobbled off on crutches. The
left arm of a third appeared to dangle limply at his
side.
But their joy was evident as they joined those
released Sunday in enjoying the small pleasures of
life denied them in prison. They gobbled down
steak and eggs, telephoned their families back home
and tinkered with their hospital television sets.
The latest POWs included 27 Marine and Army
men, 3 U.S. civilians, a German nurse and medical
student captured at a charity mission and two
Filipino employees of the Voice of America.
All were captured by guerrillas in South Vietnam
and this was believed to account for the difference
in their condition.
Coeds 1 Remains Identified
PACIFICA — A skull and two jawbones found near
the ocean were identified yesterday as remains of
two slain coeds from the University of California at
Santa Cruz whose headless bodies were discovered
25 miles away, a coroner said.
Dental charts showed the skull was that of
Rosalind Thorpe, 24, of Carmel, and the jawbones
were those of Alice Liu, 21, Torrance, the San
Mateo County coroner's office said.
The girls' bodies, one nude and one clothed, were
found near a roadbed in Castro Valley on Feb. 15,
about 10 days after they disappeared from the
Santa Cruz campus. Authorities have not
determined how the girls were killed.
The skull and jawbones were found Sunday by
two boys on an outing in the Devil's Slide area.
French Leftists Launch Drive
PARIS — French Communists and Socialists,
maintaining tight discipline, launched an all-out
attack yesterday to wrest control of the National
Assembly from the Gaullists in next Sunday's
decisive round of voting.
Communist chieftain Georges Marchais and
Francois Mitterrand, leader of the Socialists, met to
assess results of Sunday's first stage voting. With

them was Robert Fabre, radical leftist leader who is
their minor ally in the leftist coalition.
They decided to maintain their pre-election
pledge to throw their combined weight in the
second round behind whichever of their candidates
was leading in the first.
Of 490 seats in the new Assembly, only 59 were
filled on Sunday. The Gaullist coalition won 50, far
below their first round total of 144 in the 1968
elections.
The leftists got nine, slightly better than their
showing of six seats last time.
This meant that while many Frenchmen were
disenchanted with the government, they had not yet
made up their mind to put the leftists in power.
One additional reason for the seemingly poor
showing of the left was that the three allies were
running candidates separately, each party seeking to
get as many seats for itself as possible. The
Communists won eight, the Socialists one.
In the runoff the leading leftist candidate in each
district will be supported by the other parties.
Next POW Releases: No Delays
SAIGON — The Viet Cong delegation said yesterday
an impasse in the exchange of Vietnamese prisoners
would not hold up the next release of American
POWs, although it threatens to delay the
peace-keeping efforts of the four-party Joint
Military Commission, which expires in less than a
month.
Asked if a threatened boycott of the commission
would affect release of American prisoners, Capt.
Phuong Nam, press attache of the Viet Cong
delegation, said: "No, the two questions are
different. The release of Vietnamese POWs has not
made any progress but the release of U.S. and allied
military and civilian prisoners is working. I see no
problem on the next release."
A U.S. delegation spokesman also foresaw no
complications.
The U.S. spokesman said that the North
Vietnamese foreign minister, Nguyen Duy Trinh,
had assured Secretary of State William P. Rogers in
Paris last week that all American prisoners would be
released by the specified deadline, March 28.
He said there need not be formal meetings of the
commission to arrange for the release of the 286
American prisoners still in Communist hands. North
Vietnam and the Viet Cong have released 299
American prisoners in the first two batches, and
there are two more scheduled.
