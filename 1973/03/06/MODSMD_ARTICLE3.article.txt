# University Fellows Vehicle For Change
## Program Promotes Innovation 
### DAN BRENNER 
The University Fellows Program is
one of many sources for innovative
change and growth on campus. During
the four years of its existence, the
program has provided seed money for
numerous educational activities and
partial salary for 12 Fellows.
Formulated by the late Law Prof.
Herbert Packer during his term as
assistant provost, the University
Fellows Program has operated on a $1
million grant from the Ford
Foundation and $200,000 in matching
grants.
The program, due to run out in
1974, promotes innovative thinking
through two types of funding. The
Innovative Fund sponsors
experimentation and research into new
educational models. Beneficiaries of
money from the Innovative fund
include SWOPSI ($13,200), SCIRE
($18,346), the community coffee
house ($5,000), and two $2,487
Soledad Education projects, begun last
summer.
Research Supported
Research into the process of
education at Stanford has also been
supported by the Fellows program. An
unreleased study of the undergraduate
major is being completed by Religion
Prof. Edwin Good under the financial
umbrella of the Fellows. Assoc.
History Prof. Mark Mancall's design
for a social thought and social theory
curriculum, due next month, was
supported with a $30,000 grant from
the project.
Mathematics Prof. Karel de Leeuw
used a Fellows' grant to begin a
teacher training program for doctoral
students. The popular Undergraduate
math seminars taught by graduate
students also came from Fellows'
funding.
And the faculty surveys on student
course evaluations and career opinions
released last month by Assoc.
Statistics Prof. Brad Efron were made
using Fellows' money.
Ray Calvera, administrator of the
University Fellows Program, believes
that the projects of the program have
long-range value. "These are likely to
have a continuing effect at Stanford
and at possibly other universities," he
said.
Funding Faculty
The other activity of the program is
selecting and funding faculty members
who serve one-, two- or three-year
terms. As University Fellows,
professors are relieved of half their
usual teaching responsibilities with
their time spent investigating some
aspect of the university's
administrative or educational
activities.
The only regular obligation of
Fellows is to attend bi-monthly
meetings of the executive committee,

consisting of the Fellows and five
administrators. The committee
approves Innovative Fund projects and
participates in dialogues with key
University administrators and
professors.
"There is real openness and
frankness in these meetings," Calvera
says. The meetings provide the Fellows
with the opportunity to better
understand what other segments of the
campus are doing he believes.
Three Appointed
Last fall three new Fellows were
appointed: Assoc. Communication
Prof. Henry Breitrose, Assoc.
Radiology Prof. William Northway,
and Asst. English Prof. Nancy Packer.
Breitrose plans to use his
time-allotment to look into the role of
performing arts education at Stanford.
"I want to look at those departments
which have courses in both the
theoretical and practical aspects of
their discipline," Breitrose
commented. He will be preparing a
series of memoranda to be filed
whenever "I find out things which I
think are interesting and useful" about
the performing arts program.
Assoc. Political Science Prof. David
Abernethy, who is on sabbatical, has
spent the last two years as a Fellow
and will complete his term next year.
Abernethy's tenure has led to work
with SWOPSI and SCIRE and on ways
to connect student research with
alumni professional interests.

Recently he has been studying the
role of investment policy and has
submitted suggestions to the
Presidential Commission on
Investment Responsibility. Although
his proposals were not accepted, he
believes his position as Fellow
provided him with an understanding of
University decision-making.
Northway is using his Fellows'
position to work on the steering
committee of the Study of Medical
Education at Stanford commissioned
by Med School Dean Clayton Rich. He
also intends to establish closer
communication between the medical
school and the rest of the University
community. "Many people don't
know what a medical professor does,"
Northway believes.
Because of the high-caliber of the
Fellows and their exposure to the

governing functions of the University,
the program bears some resemblance
to the "Baby Deans" program at Yale,
in which top faculty are groomed for
administrative assignment.
Vice-Provost Arthur Bienenstock was a
Fellow prior to entering
administration, as was Associate
Graduate Studies Dean J. Merrill
Carlsmith,whose Fellows' project was a
comprehensive study of graduate
education.

governing functions of the University,
the program bears some resemblance
to the "Baby Deans" program at Yale,
in which top faculty are groomed for
administrative assignment.
Vice-Provost Arthur Bienenstock was a
Fellow prior to entering
administration, as was Associate
Graduate Studies Dean J. Merrill
Carlsmith,whose Fellows' project was a
comprehensive study of graduate
education.
The University Fellows Program is
one of many sources for innovative
change and growth on campus. During
the four years of its existence, the
program has provided seed money for
numerous educational activities and
partial salary for 12 Fellows.
Formulated by the late Law Prof.
Herbert Packer during his term as
assistant provost, the University
Fellows Program has operated on a $1
million grant from the Ford
Foundation and $200,000 in matching
grants.
The program, due to run out in
1974, promotes innovative thinking
through two types of funding. The
Innovative Fund sponsors
experimentation and research into new
educational models. Beneficiaries of
money from the Innovative fund
include SWOPSI ($13,200), SCIRE
($18,346), the community coffee
house ($5,000), and two $2,487
Soledad Education projects, begun last
summer.
Research Supported
Research into the process of
education at Stanford has also been
supported by the Fellows program. An
unreleased study of the undergraduate
major is being completed by Religion
Prof. Edwin Good under the financial
umbrella of the Fellows. Assoc.
History Prof. Mark Mancall's design
for a social thought and social theory
curriculum, due next month, was
supported with a $30,000 grant from
the project.
Mathematics Prof. Karel de Leeuw
used a Fellows' grant to begin a
teacher training program for doctoral
students. The popular Undergraduate
math seminars taught by graduate
students also came from Fellows'
funding.
And the faculty surveys on student
course evaluations and career opinions
released last month by Assoc.
Statistics Prof. Brad Efron were made
using Fellows' money.
Ray Calvera, administrator of the
University Fellows Program, believes
that the projects of the program have
long-range value. "These are likely to
have a continuing effect at Stanford
and at possibly other universities," he
said.
Funding Faculty
The other activity of the program is
selecting and funding faculty members
who serve one-, two- or three-year
terms. As University Fellows,
professors are relieved of half their
usual teaching responsibilities with
their time spent investigating some
aspect of the university's
administrative or educational
activities.
The only regular obligation of
Fellows is to attend bi-monthly
meetings of the executive committee,

consisting of the Fellows and five
administrators. The committee
approves Innovative Fund projects and
participates in dialogues with key
University administrators and
professors.
"There is real openness and
frankness in these meetings," Calvera
says. The meetings provide the Fellows
with the opportunity to better
understand what other segments of the
campus are doing he believes.
Three Appointed
Last fall three new Fellows were
appointed: Assoc. Communication
Prof. Henry Breitrose, Assoc.
Radiology Prof. William Northway,
and Asst. English Prof. Nancy Packer.
Breitrose plans to use his
time-allotment to look into the role of
performing arts education at Stanford.
"I want to look at those departments
which have courses in both the
theoretical and practical aspects of
their discipline," Breitrose
commented. He will be preparing a
series of memoranda to be filed
whenever "I find out things which I
think are interesting and useful" about
the performing arts program.
Assoc. Political Science Prof. David
Abernethy, who is on sabbatical, has
spent the last two years as a Fellow
and will complete his term next year.
Abernethy's tenure has led to work
with SWOPSI and SCIRE and on ways
to connect student research with
alumni professional interests.

Recently he has been studying the
role of investment policy and has
submitted suggestions to the
Presidential Commission on
Investment Responsibility. Although
his proposals were not accepted, he
believes his position as Fellow
provided him with an understanding of
University decision-making.
Northway is using his Fellows'
position to work on the steering
committee of the Study of Medical
Education at Stanford commissioned
by Med School Dean Clayton Rich. He
also intends to establish closer
communication between the medical
school and the rest of the University
community. "Many people don't
know what a medical professor does,"
Northway believes.

committee of the Study of Medical
Education at Stanford commissioned
by Med School Dean Clayton Rich. He
also intends to establish closer
communication between the medical
school and the rest of the University
community. "Many people don't
know what a medical professor does,"
Northway believes.
Because of the high-caliber of the
Fellows and their exposure to the

governing functions of the University,
the program bears some resemblance
to the "Baby Deans" program at Yale,
in which top faculty are groomed for
administrative assignment.
Vice-Provost Arthur Bienenstock was a
Fellow prior to entering
administration, as was Associate
Graduate Studies Dean J. Merrill
Carlsmith,whose Fellows' project was a
comprehensive study of graduate
education.
