# Sex Change Surgery Arranged As Part Of Med Center Project
## 
### Associated Press 
Patients learn how to set their hair
and sit and walk like members of the
opposite sex as part of a Stanford
University Medical Center sex change
program.
"Rehabilitation is the main focus of
the program," says program
coordinator Pat Gandy. "Surgery may
or may not be part of an individual's
rehabilitative progress.
"However, if we're going to do this
surgery, we want the individual to be
able to fit the social norms, to fit into
society as normal males or females."
Since Stanford began performing
sex change operations in 1967, some
500 candidates have approached the
hospital but only about 10 percent
actually underwent surgery, Gandy
said.
Only Program
Stanford offers the only such

program on the West Coast and is
among about 10 nationwide, he added.
Potential candidates undergo
extensive physical and mental testing
and are evaluated by a team of
doctors, psychiatrists, psychologists
and former patients, Gandy said.
He said the evaluators look for
motivation and physical resemblance
to the opposite sex. They must be
physically capable of undergoing the
surgery and must have no history of
psychosis.
'Feel Comfortable'
"For the 10 percent who have
surgery, it is not done for at least 12
months, when we feel comfortable and
the patient feels comfortable with the
decision," Gandy said in an interview.
"People who would not be
candidates may enjoy the role of the
opposite sex but don't necessarily
desire the surgical change."

During the year wait, he said,
patients receive comprehensive
counseling as well as hormone
treatment. Before and after surgery,
they remain in an extensive
rehabilitative program which includes
a social and physical grooming clinic.
Blend Into Public
"We want the individuals who come
to our program to be able to blend
into the public," Gandy said. "They
learn how to walk, sit and handle
themselves like the opposite sex."
He said professional models give the
grooming sessions which cover hand
movements, dressing and general body
carriage.
The operations are not actually
performed at Stanford, but at an
undisclosed county hospital in
Northern California. The medical team
is headed by plastic surgeon Dr.
Donald Laub, who preferred not to
speak with the press until the findings
of a sex change symposium held at
Stanford in early February are
published this spring.
'50 Percent Better'
"In general, among the former
patients that have been interviewed,
they are probably functioning about
50 percent better than prior to
surgery," Gandy said. "There is an
overall improvement in economic
status, self satisfaction and
relationships with others."
He said Stanford helps participants
find jobs and there usually is no need
to mention the operation to employers
because most patients legally go back
and change their gender on birth
certificates and other documents.
"Of the 35 I've contacted, all were
much happier than they had been
previously," Gandy said.
Physicians Disapprove
However, Gandy said some
physicians still disapprove of
sex-change operations.
They say this is not the answer and
it is not a complete answer to the
gender identity problem, he said.
"This problem is quite old and the
first surgery was done about 20 years
ago in Denmark, but only since about
1967 have programs been developed to
deal with this problem in the United
States."

Only Program
Stanford offers the only such

program on the West Coast and is
among about 10 nationwide, he added.
Potential candidates undergo
extensive physical and mental testing
and are evaluated by a team of
doctors, psychiatrists, psychologists
and former patients, Gandy said.
He said the evaluators look for
motivation and physical resemblance
to the opposite sex. They must be
physically capable of undergoing the
surgery and must have no history of
psychosis.
'Feel Comfortable'
"For the 10 percent who have
surgery, it is not done for at least 12
months, when we feel comfortable and
the patient feels comfortable with the
decision," Gandy said in an interview.
"People who would not be
candidates may enjoy the role of the
opposite sex but don't necessarily
desire the surgical change."

During the year wait, he said,
patients receive comprehensive
counseling as well as hormone
treatment. Before and after surgery,
they remain in an extensive
rehabilitative program which includes
a social and physical grooming clinic.
Blend Into Public
"We want the individuals who come
to our program to be able to blend
into the public," Gandy said. "They
learn how to walk, sit and handle
themselves like the opposite sex."
He said professional models give the
grooming sessions which cover hand
movements, dressing and general body
carriage.
The operations are not actually
performed at Stanford, but at an
undisclosed county hospital in
Northern California. The medical team
is headed by plastic surgeon Dr.
Donald Laub, who preferred not to
speak with the press until the findings
of a sex change symposium held at
Stanford in early February are
published this spring.
'50 Percent Better'
"In general, among the former
patients that have been interviewed,
they are probably functioning about
50 percent better than prior to
surgery," Gandy said. "There is an
overall improvement in economic
status, self satisfaction and
relationships with others."
He said Stanford helps participants
find jobs and there usually is no need
to mention the operation to employers
because most patients legally go back
and change their gender on birth
certificates and other documents.
"Of the 35 I've contacted, all were
much happier than they had been
previously," Gandy said.
Physicians Disapprove
However, Gandy said some
physicians still disapprove of
sex-change operations.
They say this is not the answer and
it is not a complete answer to the
gender identity problem, he said.
"This problem is quite old and the
first surgery was done about 20 years
ago in Denmark, but only since about
1967 have programs been developed to
deal with this problem in the United
States."

DOLLY-DALLYING — Prospective pompon Dollies awaited their first test at yesterday's try outs in Maples Pavilion. TTie
10 finalists are Terry Anzur, Sherrie Chadwick, Marcella Deffke, Linda Jenkes, Stephanie Jubina, Jackie Nelson, Maria
Stark, Linda Thomas, Mary Ann Toman, and Jeeni Wong. The prospective Dolly who attracted the most attention —
sophomore Jim Rosskopf — didn't make it. The final five who will be the 1973-74 Dollies will be chosen today.
Patients learn how to set their hair
and sit and walk like members of the
opposite sex as part of a Stanford
University Medical Center sex change
program.
"Rehabilitation is the main focus of
the program," says program
coordinator Pat Gandy. "Surgery may
or may not be part of an individual's
rehabilitative progress.
"However, if we're going to do this
surgery, we want the individual to be
able to fit the social norms, to fit into
society as normal males or females."
Since Stanford began performing
sex change operations in 1967, some
500 candidates have approached the
hospital but only about 10 percent
actually underwent surgery, Gandy
said.
