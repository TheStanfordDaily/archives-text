# Law Prof Criticizes Loss Of Press Rights

### 
The effect of the Supreme Court's
decision in the Caldwell case last year,
"has been to leave newsmen almost
totally unprotected by the First
Amendment" in lower court cases,
said Law Prof. Anthony Amsterdam in
an 88-page statement submitted to the
subcommittee on Constitutional
Rights of the U.S. Senate Committee
on the Judiciary.
Amsterdam predicted that "if and
when the Supreme Court hears further
cases on a case-by-case basis, it will

generally or invariably hold that
newsmen must testify," unless
Congress acts.
"Subpoenaing newsmen is the
easiest thing in the world. Anybody
old enough to practice law, and some
who are not, can do it. There are no
brakes on the process, no procedural
screens, and no costs of consequence
to the subpoenaing party."
Newsmen can fight their cases all
the way to the Supreme Court, he
said. "But this costs more money than
most reporters have" and is very heavy
for employers who underwrite the
costs, he said.
There are no costs of consequence
to the subpoenaing party, Amsterdam
stated.
The "most obvious and doubtless
most destructive impact of subpoenas
is on the newsman's confidential
relationships with his sources," he
said. Information gained from these
sources is "the backbone of a press
that strives to be at once inquiring and
reliable, without it reporters could do
little but broadcast unanalyzed press
releases and unchecked rumors,"
Amsterdam continued.
Due in part to the Supreme Court
decision, "the pressures are very heavy
today to issue subpoenas where they
are merely convenient, not necessary,
without the slightest concern for their
damaging effects upon the freedom of
the press ... I doubt there are many
subjects on which Congress, for
instance, could not inform itself
sufficiently to legislate without
newsmen," the law professor
remarked.
Amsterdam asserted that newsmen
need a well considered testimonial
"privilege" — a right to refuse to
answer certain questions, but "the
most essential safeguard is a
requirement that the decision to issue
a press subpoena be made at a
responsible level of authority."
With court subpoenas the decision
should be made by the judge. In
legislative and administrative
subpoenas the decision should be
made by the legislative committee or
the administrative agency, not by the
subordinate investigating staff, he said.
Amsterdam outlined three criteria
that should be met before a press
subpoena is issued:
— "Whether there is reasonable
ground to believe that the newsman
has any material, unprivileged evidence
to give;
— "Whether there exists some
factual basis for the investigation or
the claim of the subpoenaing party in
a court case;
— "Whether the evidence sought
from newsmen cannot be equally well
obtained from nonnews sources."
"The ultimate objective of all
legislation, after all," he commented,
"is not to protect one or another
newsman — or even all newsmen — for
their own sake. It is to protect the
processes of the press, so that the
public shall be fully and intelligently
informed."
