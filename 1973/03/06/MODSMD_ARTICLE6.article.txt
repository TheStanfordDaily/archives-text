## Two Cents 
### 
Was the recent ASSU election worth two cents to you?
The ASSU paid about 2/3 of the cost of its election last
week, about $225. This is about two cents per student. The
remaining third came from the Debate Union and Citizens'
Advocates, the groups unsuccessfully asking for fee
assessments, in the form of labor at the polling places.
There have been three elections already this year. There
will be an election for ASSU Council of Presidents in the
second or third week of April. But Elections Commissioner
Mike Nilsson says that there will probably be yet another
election later spring quarter to ask for fee assessments for
groups who will not be ready to mount a campaign by
mid-April.
This steady drain on our pennies can be blamed on the
ASSU constitution, which provides that any group which
can get 10 percent of the student body to sign a petition can
have its own election, although the ASSU president can
delay the vote if it comes at the end of a quarter.
Alternately, if the Senate approves the election, there can be
no delay.
The ASSU argues that it's not really the students' money.
It falls from the sky, in this case the University. If a group
could not provide money or labor to underwrite an election,
the Dean of Students Office would always pick up the bill,
Nilsson assures us. But ultimately these pennies come from
our tuition dollar.
There are several possible solutions to the problem of
special elections. One is to pass a program fund for the
ASSU, something which students have rejected for two years
in a row. The ASSU program fund formerly gave money to a
variety of groups, many of them asking $200 or $300, too
little to need even a $1 fee assessment. This would cut down
somewhat on the number of fee assessments to vote on. But
the program fund was also the ccnter of ASSU politicing.
The immortal sandbox in which budding student politicians
played with other people's money.
In our opinion the Senate has proved itself unable to
administrate anything, especially money.
Another possibility, forcing groups to pay the total cost
of special elections in either money or labor, is far too
dangerous. No group should be able to buy its own election;
the possibilities for corruption are obvious.
The third and most promising solution is to amend the
constitution to fix a maximum of one election per quarter.
Any group could get on the ballot by petition or vote of the
Senate, sharing the ballot in fall with the Senate and in
spring with the Council of Presidents. This would force
groups to plan ahead. Fewer elections might mean that those
that were held would excite more student interest and more
voter turnout.
A timely election is worth a lot of money to certain
groups but it is doubtful if any ASSU election is worth two
cents to the students of Stanford.

voter turnout.
A timely election is worth a lot of money to certain
groups but it is doubtful if any ASSU election is worth two
cents to the students of Stanford.
Was the recent ASSU election worth two cents to you?
The ASSU paid about 2/3 of the cost of its election last
week, about $225. This is about two cents per student. The
remaining third came from the Debate Union and Citizens'
Advocates, the groups unsuccessfully asking for fee
assessments, in the form of labor at the polling places.
There have been three elections already this year. There
will be an election for ASSU Council of Presidents in the
second or third week of April. But Elections Commissioner
Mike Nilsson says that there will probably be yet another
election later spring quarter to ask for fee assessments for
groups who will not be ready to mount a campaign by
mid-April.
This steady drain on our pennies can be blamed on the
ASSU constitution, which provides that any group which
can get 10 percent of the student body to sign a petition can
have its own election, although the ASSU president can
delay the vote if it comes at the end of a quarter.
Alternately, if the Senate approves the election, there can be
no delay.
The ASSU argues that it's not really the students' money.
It falls from the sky, in this case the University. If a group
could not provide money or labor to underwrite an election,
the Dean of Students Office would always pick up the bill,
Nilsson assures us. But ultimately these pennies come from
our tuition dollar.
There are several possible solutions to the problem of
special elections. One is to pass a program fund for the
ASSU, something which students have rejected for two years
in a row. The ASSU program fund formerly gave money to a
variety of groups, many of them asking $200 or $300, too
little to need even a $1 fee assessment. This would cut down
somewhat on the number of fee assessments to vote on. But
the program fund was also the ccnter of ASSU politicing.
The immortal sandbox in which budding student politicians
played with other people's money.
In our opinion the Senate has proved itself unable to
administrate anything, especially money.
Another possibility, forcing groups to pay the total cost
of special elections in either money or labor, is far too
dangerous. No group should be able to buy its own election;
the possibilities for corruption are obvious.
The third and most promising solution is to amend the
constitution to fix a maximum of one election per quarter.
Any group could get on the ballot by petition or vote of the
Senate, sharing the ballot in fall with the Senate and in
spring with the Council of Presidents. This would force
groups to plan ahead. Fewer elections might mean that those
that were held would excite more student interest and more
voter turnout.
