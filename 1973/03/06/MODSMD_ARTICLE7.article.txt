## On Unions And Layoffs 
### 
Dexter Francis

On March 1 the Daily ran an
article by Linda Crouse
concerning the unionization of
workers at Stanford. In the article
Ms. Crouse made some sweeping
generalizations and outright false
statements concerning the
University Administration's
position in the laying off of
workers at SLAC and the Med
Center. I am not familiar enough
with the situation at the Med
Center to comment on it; but as a
past SLAC employee I feel that I
must make some comment
concerning the issues.
To begin with, SLAC is not
funded by the University. It is run
under contract of the Atomic
Energy Commission. Salaries etc.,
for SLAC come out of funds
appropriated to the AEC by
Congress. In fact less than ten
percent of the funds provided

SLAC come from Stanford. These
are for the few University
employees working on the site.
Of the 80-odd workers affected
by the layoffs, approximately 25
have been employed there for six
months or less. These workers are
being cut first, in favor of workers
who have been employed for
longer periods.
Rehirings
Workers holding positions
which need to be refilled
immediately will be rehired to
their old positions. So in effect
they will not lose any pay or
benefits. Those employees being
laid off are given opportunities to
fill positions in lower
classifications, and if they cannot
be accommodated on sight are
aided in locating jobs on campus
or with other firms.
As for the "more permanent

buildings" of the Computation
Center; the SLAC Computation
Center is overloaded and a plan to
expand it to ease the excess
includes a building to house the
two new IBM 370 168's which are
being installed for that purpose.
The present SLAC computer (an
IBM 360 - 91) will be hooked up
with the two 168's providing a
three way system with at least
two to three times the capacity of
the present single 360 - 91.
The advantages to this type of
system are numerous, but as I am
not selling computers there is no
need to discuss them here. The
building itself will be three stories
high and provide space for the
computers, staff, and associated
systems. The three million dollar
cost works out to less than the
$24 per square foot average for
most office buildings. All of this is
precluded by the fact that the
AEC will be paying for the
building, not the University.
Unionization
Concerning Unionization: last
year SLAC employees were given
an opportunity to decide whether
or not they wanted union
representation. They voted two to
one against the proposal.
Finally, in regards to the
University policy on layoffs: I
suggest reading the section on
Staff Benefits in the 1971-72
Proposed Budget. The total
benefits in the Unemployment
Insurance, Pensions, and disability
Insurance exceed 13 million
dollars. Further, I question Ms.
Crouse's evaluation of "slush
funds." Again I suggest reading
the University Budget. One of
these funds provides more than
seven million dollars in tuition
waivers, another gives over ten
million dollars to Student Aid.
Last year the University just
broke even in total expenses. This
would not have been possible
without the gifts, pledges and
grants from large foundations.
In short, Venceremos, how do
you expect us to believe what you
say if you don't research it before
you have the nerve to waste space
in the Daily with it?

these funds provides more than
seven million dollars in tuition
waivers, another gives over ten
million dollars to Student Aid.
Last year the University just
broke even in total expenses. This
would not have been possible
without the gifts, pledges and
grants from large foundations.
In short, Venceremos, how do
you expect us to believe what you
say if you don't research it before
you have the nerve to waste space
in the Daily with it?

On March 1 the Daily ran an
article by Linda Crouse
concerning the unionization of
workers at Stanford. In the article
Ms. Crouse made some sweeping
generalizations and outright false
statements concerning the
University Administration's
position in the laying off of
workers at SLAC and the Med
Center. I am not familiar enough
with the situation at the Med
Center to comment on it; but as a
past SLAC employee I feel that I
must make some comment
concerning the issues.
To begin with, SLAC is not
funded by the University. It is run
under contract of the Atomic
Energy Commission. Salaries etc.,
for SLAC come out of funds
appropriated to the AEC by
Congress. In fact less than ten
percent of the funds provided

SLAC come from Stanford. These
are for the few University
employees working on the site.
Of the 80-odd workers affected
by the layoffs, approximately 25
have been employed there for six
months or less. These workers are
being cut first, in favor of workers
who have been employed for
longer periods.
Rehirings
Workers holding positions
which need to be refilled
immediately will be rehired to
their old positions. So in effect
they will not lose any pay or
benefits. Those employees being
laid off are given opportunities to
fill positions in lower
classifications, and if they cannot
be accommodated on sight are
aided in locating jobs on campus
or with other firms.
As for the "more permanent

buildings" of the Computation
Center; the SLAC Computation
Center is overloaded and a plan to
expand it to ease the excess
includes a building to house the
two new IBM 370 168's which are
being installed for that purpose.
The present SLAC computer (an
IBM 360 - 91) will be hooked up
with the two 168's providing a
three way system with at least
two to three times the capacity of
the present single 360 - 91.
The advantages to this type of
system are numerous, but as I am
not selling computers there is no
need to discuss them here. The
building itself will be three stories
high and provide space for the
computers, staff, and associated
systems. The three million dollar
cost works out to less than the
$24 per square foot average for
most office buildings. All of this is
precluded by the fact that the
AEC will be paying for the
building, not the University.
Unionization
Concerning Unionization: last
year SLAC employees were given
an opportunity to decide whether
or not they wanted union
representation. They voted two to
one against the proposal.
Finally, in regards to the
University policy on layoffs: I
suggest reading the section on
Staff Benefits in the 1971-72
Proposed Budget. The total
benefits in the Unemployment
Insurance, Pensions, and disability
Insurance exceed 13 million
dollars. Further, I question Ms.
Crouse's evaluation of "slush
funds." Again I suggest reading
the University Budget. One of
these funds provides more than
seven million dollars in tuition
waivers, another gives over ten
million dollars to Student Aid.
Last year the University just
broke even in total expenses. This
would not have been possible
without the gifts, pledges and
grants from large foundations.
