# Monday POW Release Includes Former 'Daily' Editor-in-Chief
## 
### JIM WASCHER 
A former Daily editor-in-chief held as a prisoner
of war by the Viet Cong since May 9, 1968 was
among the 34 POWs who arrived at Clark Air Force
Base in the Philippines from Hanoi Monday.
Army Capt. Stephen R. Leopold, 28, of
Milwaukee, Wise., was the senior military man in the
group and so led the others in disembarking from
the plane.
Leopold graduated in 1966, magna cum laude
with a degree in history and political science after
serving as Daily editor from Sept. 1965 to Jan.
1966. After his student deferment expired, he
enlisted rather than waiting to be drafted.
Leopold turned down a Woodrow Wilson
Fellowship for postgraduate work at Harvard in
order to enlist.
'Good To Be Free'
The Special Forces officer spoke for his
comrades on their arrival at Clark. "My God, you
don't know how good it is to be free, how good it is
to be home," he said.
"When I was told on the airplane that I might
make a short speech," Leopold continued, "the first
thing I thought of was to add up the years of
captivity that the men in this group had served. I

stopped counting at 150. It's over that.
"One hundred and fifty years for 34 people is a
long time. But there is no sorrow in this group
today, none whatsoever. I think right now that this
is the happiest group of men in the United States or
anywhere else in the world."
Units of the Viet Cong captured Leopold in
South Vietnam's central highlands only two months
after he went into combat.
Nancy Keane, a San Francisco attorney and a
friend of Leopold's, told the San Francisco
Examiner Monday that; "Nobody knew whether he
was alive or dead. He was wounded and carried
off . . . during a battle for one of those hills where
we lost so many men and then decided we didn't
really want them."
Keane added that Leopold "went to Officer
Candidate School at Fort Bragg, N.C., was
commissioned as a lieutenant in the Special Forces
— the Green Berets. They told him he was going to
do 'some kind of Vietnamese social work.'"
However, he was sent to Vietnam in a combat unit.
Important Phone Call
Contacted in Milwaukee last night, Leopold's
mother said she and her husband were first notified
of their son's release "last Thursday night about 11

o'clock [CST] when a family assistance officer who
is our liaison" called.
She said "we talked to him last night" (Monday)
and added that he was in good health and good
spirits. "We saw him in the morning on television,
too," his mother said.
According to Mrs. Leopold, her son will be taken
to Fitzsimmons General Army Hospital in Denver
after leaving the Philippines. There, he will be
released from the Army since "his term of
enlistment is up."
"We will hear from our liaison officer when he is
notified by Clark field. Then we will go to
Fitzsimmons to meet him — we'll be there when he
arrives." She said expenses for the trip to Denver
were "all taken care of" by the Department of
Defense.
Leopold's mother said "we've never had any
letter or communication of or from him" in the five
years that he has been a prisoner. "We've written
and sent packages and some came back and some
didn't." Officially, Leopold had been missing in
action until the negotiation of the Vietnam
cease-fire in January.

the plane.
Leopold graduated in 1966, magna cum laude
with a degree in history and political science after
serving as Daily editor from Sept. 1965 to Jan.
1966. After his student deferment expired, he
enlisted rather than waiting to be drafted.
Leopold turned down a Woodrow Wilson
Fellowship for postgraduate work at Harvard in
order to enlist.
'Good To Be Free'
The Special Forces officer spoke for his
comrades on their arrival at Clark. "My God, you
don't know how good it is to be free, how good it is
to be home," he said.
"When I was told on the airplane that I might
make a short speech," Leopold continued, "the first
thing I thought of was to add up the years of
captivity that the men in this group had served. I

stopped counting at 150. It's over that.
"One hundred and fifty years for 34 people is a
long time. But there is no sorrow in this group
today, none whatsoever. I think right now that this
is the happiest group of men in the United States or
anywhere else in the world."
Units of the Viet Cong captured Leopold in
South Vietnam's central highlands only two months
after he went into combat.
Nancy Keane, a San Francisco attorney and a
friend of Leopold's, told the San Francisco
Examiner Monday that; "Nobody knew whether he
was alive or dead. He was wounded and carried
off . . . during a battle for one of those hills where
we lost so many men and then decided we didn't
really want them."
Keane added that Leopold "went to Officer
Candidate School at Fort Bragg, N.C., was
commissioned as a lieutenant in the Special Forces
— the Green Berets. They told him he was going to
do 'some kind of Vietnamese social work.'"
However, he was sent to Vietnam in a combat unit.
Important Phone Call
Contacted in Milwaukee last night, Leopold's
mother said she and her husband were first notified
of their son's release "last Thursday night about 11

o'clock [CST] when a family assistance officer who
is our liaison" called.
She said "we talked to him last night" (Monday)
and added that he was in good health and good
spirits. "We saw him in the morning on television,
too," his mother said.
According to Mrs. Leopold, her son will be taken
to Fitzsimmons General Army Hospital in Denver
after leaving the Philippines. There, he will be
released from the Army since "his term of
enlistment is up."
"We will hear from our liaison officer when he is
notified by Clark field. Then we will go to
Fitzsimmons to meet him — we'll be there when he
arrives." She said expenses for the trip to Denver
were "all taken care of" by the Department of
Defense.
Leopold's mother said "we've never had any
letter or communication of or from him" in the five
years that he has been a prisoner. "We've written
and sent packages and some came back and some
didn't." Officially, Leopold had been missing in
action until the negotiation of the Vietnam
cease-fire in January.
