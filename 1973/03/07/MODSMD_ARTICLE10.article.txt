# Peace Treaty's Survival At Stake
## Congress And Aid To North Vietnam 
### 
W. Duncan Waterman Jr.

Quite obviously the President's
proposed economic aid to North
Vietnam is not as much a
responsible gesture of American
generosity as it is an inducement
to Hanoi to abide by the Paris
settlement or "to be less
ostentatious about its efforts on
behalf of the Viet Cong (NLF)."
(Editorial—Christian Science
Monitor, Feb. 24, 1973). Henry
Kissinger has commented on this
idea: "We are asking for support
of such a program not on
economic grounds, and not even
on humanitarian grounds
primarily, but on the grounds of
attempting to build peace in
Indochina." (Time, March 5,
1973). According to Newsweek

(Feb. 26, 1973), Nixon has made
economic aid to North Vietnam
"one of the building blocks of his
Paris truce."
It is a fair assumption that the
President, not noted for his
compassion and good will towards
North Vietnam, would not
include a U.S. committment to
rebuild that country unless it were
expedient to the implementation
of the treaty. Nixon is certainly
not advocating a moral obligation
for such a project.
Congressional Animosity
Economic aid to North
Vietnam is part of the Paris Peace
Agreement (Chapter 8, Article
21). Under normal procedures,
the Nixon administration would
request Congress to appropriate a
specific sum of money to aid
North Vietnam. However, in an
appearance before the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee,
Secretary of State William P.
Rogers refused to rule out flatly
the possibility that the
Administration might circumvent
this procedure by diverting funds
from existing programs. (Christian
Science Monitor, Feb. 24, 1973).
Rogers' comment is due to
Congressional belligerence to this
expected bill. Many Senate
liberals and Democrats such as
Frank Church, Hubert Humphrey
and John O. Pastore cannot
justify spending funds on
rebuilding North Vietnam while
the Nixon budget reduces funds
for several domestic programs.
Opposition is also coming from
some conservatives who supported
Nixon's policies during the
Vietnam War. For example, Barry
Goldwater says he might lead a
Senate fight against aid to North
Vietnam.
Some of the more outspoken
anti-war senators, such as George
McGovern, Charles Percy and J.W.
Ful bright have indicated
conditional support for the
President's policy; depending on
the outcome of the budget
squabble. Most "Nixon"
Republicans in Congress,
traditionally opposed to economic
aid programs, let alone aid to
Communist nations, are
conspicuously behind their leader.
No doubt their concern for
securing Kissinger's negotiated
peace has eclipsed both precedent
and ideology.
Backing
Once this issue is thought out
carefully, Congress will likely
back the President's
committment. Objections based
on Nixon's domestic budget
cutbacks, on the principle of
assisting Communism,
disillusionment with foreign aid
generally or a desire to extricate
the U.S. from Vietnam forever,
will ultimately give way to the
primary concern of achieving a
lasting peace in Vietnam.
Since Nixon's promise of
economic aid does appear to be a
key foundation to the success of
the Paris truce, the last thing
Congress wants is to be
responsible for upsetting that
truce and possibly reopening the
war. Senate Democratic leader,
Mike Mansfield who has expressed
some reservations about aid to
Hanoi, said he will back President
Nixon's proposal because it
probably was a key factor in
getting a settlement. (S.F.
Chronicle, Feb. 21, 1973).
Secretary Rogers concedes that
obtaining Congressional passage
would be difficult but he says he
would expect Congress to act
' ' responsibly.'' The
Administration's case is
"reasonably compelling when it is
argued that aid is necessary to
promote long-term stability."
(Time, March 5, 1973).
Alternate Mehns
Even if Congress dared to

withhold aid, the Administration
would not jeopardize its own
peace agreement—an alternate
means of fulfilling its bargain with
Hanoi would be found. One
source mentions that the
Pentagon budget was purposely
rejiggered this year to include
large pockets of fat that could be
diverted into such aid funds, and
some Administration aides
maintain that the President could
divert them by executive fiat even
if Congress balks. (Newsweek,
Feb. 26, 1973).
This not so subtle usurpation
of Congressional power might
mean another major battle
between the President and Capitol
Hill—one which Congress would
undoubtedly lose. On the one
hand, Congress is not willing to
send funds overseas to help revive
North Vietnam while the new
budget cuts into programs at
home.
This would signify a symbolic,
if not real, loss of power. On the
other hand, a refusal to allot such
aid might cause the
Administration to bypass
Congressional consent by going to

its inflated defense budget—a
perhaps more painful snub.
This situation is not dissimilar
from the bitter anti-war protests
heard from Congress in the past
several years. Legislation was
introduced then to cut off
funding for the war and to
overturn the President's legal
authority to conduct the war. The
Senate Foreign Relations
Committee has approved a bill,
sponsored by Chairman Fulbright,
which would withhold foreign aid
funds after April 30 unless the
President releases 4.5 billion
dollars in domestic money
appropriated by Congress for
housing, education, transportation
and welfare—Senator Clifford
Case has added to this a bill to
prohibit any aid to North
Vietnam without specific
Congressional approval. And after
June 30 there would be a ban on
any aid to South Vietnam, Laos,
Cambodia without Congressional
sanction. (Christian Science
Monitor, March 1, 1973).
Just as "end the war"
amendments failed and the repeal
of the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution

was ignored by the Chief
Executive, it would not be
unassuming to expect a similar
decision in this new struggle
between President and Congress.
The Fulbright and Case bills
(which cover only Fiscal Year
1973) have virtually no chance of
becoming law, observers say, since
Nixon would veto them even if
Congress managed compromised
versions. A bitter fight is
anticipated on the Senate floor
with efforts by some legislators to
knock out the impoundment
measure and other provisions.
(Christian Science Monitor, March
1, 1973).
For those not involved in the
bargaining process between
President and Congress, it should
be pointed out that the real issue
here is the survival of the peace
treaty. Without the political
leverage, this economic aid would
exert on Hanoi to comply with
the treaty, all could be lost.

large pockets of fat that could be
diverted into such aid funds, and
some Administration aides
maintain that the President could
divert them by executive fiat even
if Congress balks. (Newsweek,
Feb. 26, 1973).
This not so subtle usurpation
of Congressional power might
mean another major battle
between the President and Capitol
Hill—one which Congress would
undoubtedly lose. On the one
hand, Congress is not willing to
send funds overseas to help revive
North Vietnam while the new
budget cuts into programs at
home.
This would signify a symbolic,
if not real, loss of power. On the
other hand, a refusal to allot such
aid might cause the
Administration to bypass
Congressional consent by going to

its inflated defense budget—a
perhaps more painful snub.
This situation is not dissimilar
from the bitter anti-war protests
heard from Congress in the past
several years. Legislation was
introduced then to cut off
funding for the war and to
overturn the President's legal
authority to conduct the war. The
Senate Foreign Relations
Committee has approved a bill,
sponsored by Chairman Fulbright,
which would withhold foreign aid
funds after April 30 unless the
President releases 4.5 billion
dollars in domestic money
appropriated by Congress for
housing, education, transportation
and welfare—Senator Clifford
Case has added to this a bill to
prohibit any aid to North
Vietnam without specific
Congressional approval. And after
June 30 there would be a ban on
any aid to South Vietnam, Laos,
Cambodia without Congressional
sanction. (Christian Science
Monitor, March 1, 1973).
Just as "end the war"
amendments failed and the repeal
of the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution

was ignored by the Chief
Executive, it would not be
unassuming to expect a similar
decision in this new struggle
between President and Congress.
The Fulbright and Case bills
(which cover only Fiscal Year
1973) have virtually no chance of
becoming law, observers say, since
Nixon would veto them even if
Congress managed compromised
versions. A bitter fight is
anticipated on the Senate floor
with efforts by some legislators to
knock out the impoundment
measure and other provisions.
(Christian Science Monitor, March
1, 1973).
For those not involved in the
bargaining process between
President and Congress, it should
be pointed out that the real issue
here is the survival of the peace
treaty. Without the political
leverage, this economic aid would
exert on Hanoi to comply with
the treaty, all could be lost.

Quite obviously the President's
proposed economic aid to North
Vietnam is not as much a
responsible gesture of American
generosity as it is an inducement
to Hanoi to abide by the Paris
settlement or "to be less
ostentatious about its efforts on
behalf of the Viet Cong (NLF)."
(Editorial—Christian Science
Monitor, Feb. 24, 1973). Henry
Kissinger has commented on this
idea: "We are asking for support
of such a program not on
economic grounds, and not even
on humanitarian grounds
primarily, but on the grounds of
attempting to build peace in
Indochina." (Time, March 5,
1973). According to Newsweek

(Feb. 26, 1973), Nixon has made
economic aid to North Vietnam
"one of the building blocks of his
Paris truce."
It is a fair assumption that the
President, not noted for his
compassion and good will towards
North Vietnam, would not
include a U.S. committment to
rebuild that country unless it were
expedient to the implementation
of the treaty. Nixon is certainly
not advocating a moral obligation
for such a project.
Congressional Animosity
Economic aid to North
Vietnam is part of the Paris Peace
Agreement (Chapter 8, Article
21). Under normal procedures,
the Nixon administration would
request Congress to appropriate a
specific sum of money to aid
North Vietnam. However, in an
appearance before the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee,
Secretary of State William P.
Rogers refused to rule out flatly
the possibility that the
Administration might circumvent
this procedure by diverting funds
from existing programs. (Christian
Science Monitor, Feb. 24, 1973).
Rogers' comment is due to
Congressional belligerence to this
expected bill. Many Senate
liberals and Democrats such as
Frank Church, Hubert Humphrey
and John O. Pastore cannot
justify spending funds on
rebuilding North Vietnam while
the Nixon budget reduces funds
for several domestic programs.
Opposition is also coming from
some conservatives who supported
Nixon's policies during the
Vietnam War. For example, Barry
Goldwater says he might lead a
Senate fight against aid to North
Vietnam.
Some of the more outspoken
anti-war senators, such as George
McGovern, Charles Percy and J.W.
Ful bright have indicated
conditional support for the
President's policy; depending on
the outcome of the budget
squabble. Most "Nixon"
Republicans in Congress,
traditionally opposed to economic
aid programs, let alone aid to
Communist nations, are
conspicuously behind their leader.
No doubt their concern for
securing Kissinger's negotiated
peace has eclipsed both precedent
and ideology.
Backing
Once this issue is thought out
carefully, Congress will likely
back the President's
committment. Objections based
on Nixon's domestic budget
cutbacks, on the principle of
assisting Communism,
disillusionment with foreign aid
generally or a desire to extricate
the U.S. from Vietnam forever,
will ultimately give way to the
primary concern of achieving a
lasting peace in Vietnam.
Since Nixon's promise of
economic aid does appear to be a
key foundation to the success of
the Paris truce, the last thing
Congress wants is to be
responsible for upsetting that
truce and possibly reopening the
war. Senate Democratic leader,
Mike Mansfield who has expressed
some reservations about aid to
Hanoi, said he will back President
Nixon's proposal because it
probably was a key factor in
getting a settlement. (S.F.
Chronicle, Feb. 21, 1973).
Secretary Rogers concedes that
obtaining Congressional passage
would be difficult but he says he
would expect Congress to act
' ' responsibly.'' The
Administration's case is
"reasonably compelling when it is
argued that aid is necessary to
promote long-term stability."
(Time, March 5, 1973).
Alternate Mehns
Even if Congress dared to

withhold aid, the Administration
would not jeopardize its own
peace agreement—an alternate
means of fulfilling its bargain with
Hanoi would be found. One
source mentions that the
Pentagon budget was purposely
rejiggered this year to include
large pockets of fat that could be
diverted into such aid funds, and
some Administration aides
maintain that the President could
divert them by executive fiat even
if Congress balks. (Newsweek,

Rogers refused to rule out flatly
the possibility that the
Administration might circumvent
this procedure by diverting funds
from existing programs. (Christian
Science Monitor, Feb. 24, 1973).
Rogers' comment is due to
Congressional belligerence to this
expected bill. Many Senate
liberals and Democrats such as
Frank Church, Hubert Humphrey
and John O. Pastore cannot
justify spending funds on
rebuilding North Vietnam while
the Nixon budget reduces funds
for several domestic programs.
Opposition is also coming from
some conservatives who supported
Nixon's policies during the
Vietnam War. For example, Barry
Goldwater says he might lead a
Senate fight against aid to North
Vietnam.
Some of the more outspoken
anti-war senators, such as George
McGovern, Charles Percy and J.W.
Ful bright have indicated
conditional support for the
President's policy; depending on
the outcome of the budget
squabble. Most "Nixon"
Republicans in Congress,
traditionally opposed to economic
aid programs, let alone aid to
Communist nations, are
conspicuously behind their leader.
No doubt their concern for
securing Kissinger's negotiated
peace has eclipsed both precedent
and ideology.
Backing
Once this issue is thought out
carefully, Congress will likely
back the President's
committment. Objections based
on Nixon's domestic budget
cutbacks, on the principle of
assisting Communism,
disillusionment with foreign aid
generally or a desire to extricate
the U.S. from Vietnam forever,
will ultimately give way to the
primary concern of achieving a
lasting peace in Vietnam.
Since Nixon's promise of
economic aid does appear to be a
key foundation to the success of
the Paris truce, the last thing
Congress wants is to be
responsible for upsetting that
truce and possibly reopening the
war. Senate Democratic leader,
Mike Mansfield who has expressed
some reservations about aid to
Hanoi, said he will back President
Nixon's proposal because it
probably was a key factor in
getting a settlement. (S.F.
Chronicle, Feb. 21, 1973).
Secretary Rogers concedes that
obtaining Congressional passage
would be difficult but he says he
would expect Congress to act
' ' responsibly.'' The
Administration's case is
"reasonably compelling when it is
argued that aid is necessary to
promote long-term stability."
(Time, March 5, 1973).
Alternate Mehns
Even if Congress dared to

withhold aid, the Administration
would not jeopardize its own
peace agreement—an alternate
means of fulfilling its bargain with
Hanoi would be found. One
source mentions that the
Pentagon budget was purposely
rejiggered this year to include
large pockets of fat that could be
diverted into such aid funds, and
some Administration aides
maintain that the President could
divert them by executive fiat even
if Congress balks. (Newsweek,
Feb. 26, 1973).
This not so subtle usurpation
of Congressional power might
mean another major battle
between the President and Capitol
Hill—one which Congress would
undoubtedly lose. On the one
hand, Congress is not willing to
send funds overseas to help revive
North Vietnam while the new
budget cuts into programs at
home.
This would signify a symbolic,
if not real, loss of power. On the
other hand, a refusal to allot such
aid might cause the
Administration to bypass
Congressional consent by going to

its inflated defense budget—a
perhaps more painful snub.
This situation is not dissimilar
from the bitter anti-war protests
heard from Congress in the past
several years. Legislation was
introduced then to cut off
funding for the war and to
overturn the President's legal
authority to conduct the war. The
Senate Foreign Relations
Committee has approved a bill,
sponsored by Chairman Fulbright,
which would withhold foreign aid
funds after April 30 unless the
President releases 4.5 billion
dollars in domestic money
appropriated by Congress for
housing, education, transportation
and welfare—Senator Clifford
Case has added to this a bill to
prohibit any aid to North
Vietnam without specific
Congressional approval. And after
June 30 there would be a ban on
any aid to South Vietnam, Laos,
Cambodia without Congressional
sanction. (Christian Science
Monitor, March 1, 1973).
Just as "end the war"
amendments failed and the repeal
of the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution

was ignored by the Chief
Executive, it would not be
unassuming to expect a similar
decision in this new struggle
between President and Congress.
The Fulbright and Case bills
(which cover only Fiscal Year
1973) have virtually no chance of
becoming law, observers say, since
Nixon would veto them even if
Congress managed compromised
versions. A bitter fight is
anticipated on the Senate floor
with efforts by some legislators to
knock out the impoundment
measure and other provisions.
(Christian Science Monitor, March
1, 1973).
For those not involved in the
bargaining process between
President and Congress, it should
be pointed out that the real issue
here is the survival of the peace
treaty. Without the political
leverage, this economic aid would
exert on Hanoi to comply with
the treaty, all could be lost.
(W. Duncan Waterman, Jr. is a

Quite obviously the President's
proposed economic aid to North
Vietnam is not as much a
responsible gesture of American
generosity as it is an inducement
to Hanoi to abide by the Paris
settlement or "to be less
ostentatious about its efforts on
behalf of the Viet Cong (NLF)."
(Editorial—Christian Science
Monitor, Feb. 24, 1973). Henry
Kissinger has commented on this
idea: "We are asking for support
of such a program not on
economic grounds, and not even
on humanitarian grounds
primarily, but on the grounds of
attempting to build peace in
Indochina." (Time, March 5,
1973). According to Newsweek

(Feb. 26, 1973), Nixon has made
economic aid to North Vietnam
"one of the building blocks of his
Paris truce."
It is a fair assumption that the
President, not noted for his
compassion and good will towards
North Vietnam, would not
include a U.S. committment to
rebuild that country unless it were
expedient to the implementation
of the treaty. Nixon is certainly
not advocating a moral obligation
for such a project.
Congressional Animosity
Economic aid to North
Vietnam is part of the Paris Peace
Agreement (Chapter 8, Article
21). Under normal procedures,
the Nixon administration would
request Congress to appropriate a
specific sum of money to aid
North Vietnam. However, in an

Foreign Relations Committee,

Monitor, March 1, 1973).
Just as "end the war"
amendments failed and the repeal
of the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution

was ignored by the Chief
Executive, it would not be
unassuming to expect a similar
decision in this new struggle
between President and Congress.
The Fulbright and Case bills
(which cover only Fiscal Year
1973) have virtually no chance of
becoming law, observers say, since
Nixon would veto them even if
Congress managed compromised
versions. A bitter fight is
anticipated on the Senate floor
with efforts by some legislators to
knock out the impoundment
measure and other provisions.
(Christian Science Monitor, March
1, 1973).
For those not involved in the
bargaining process between
President and Congress, it should
be pointed out that the real issue
here is the survival of the peace
treaty. Without the political
leverage, this economic aid would
exert on Hanoi to comply with
the treaty, all could be lost.
