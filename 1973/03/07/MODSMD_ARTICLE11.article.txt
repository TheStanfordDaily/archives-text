Off In The Bleachers
Editor:
It's always interesting to read
the libertarian views of Messrs.
Evers and know, sort
of an escape from reality, like a
Buster Keaton flick or an evening
watching commerical television.
Why is it that two of the Daily's
four regular columnists are off in
the bleachers in right field while
most of us are trying to
understand the real problems of
society and economy?
I have nothing against theorists
(which is exactly what libertarians
are) so long as they remain in
their ivory towers. If Milton
Friedman went about his work
objectively instead of trying to
develop theories that support his
preconceived political ideals,
perhaps his brilliance as an
'academic' would be of some use.
Come on, Bill and Chris, I'm
tired of hearing rhetoric. Stop
trying to view every issue in
idyllic libertarian terms. We do
not live in a libertarian society nor
economy and libertarian ideals
simply do not apply to the
practical questions we do face.
When, of course, the
"Libertarian Revolution" comes,
perhaps some of your inane
comments about present
economic problems will make
better sense. But until that
happens your comments remain
just that—inane, and absurd as
applied to our present economic
structure.
Wayne Ullman
Junior, Economics
(Mr. Evers replies:)
Mr. Ullman's letter is a
combination of ad hominem
arguments, logical mistakes, and
errors of fact.
First, I consider myself
politically of the left. I am an
anarchist.
The designations left and right
are derived historically from the
seating in an assembly where the
supporters of the French
Revolution sat on the left and the
opponents on the right. I believe
that the French Revolution was
on balance a good thing. If Mr.
Ullman has some special meaning
of left and right, he should make
this clear.
It is illogical to maintain, as

Mr. Ullman does, (1) that
theorists and their theories should
remain in ivory towers divorced
from reality, and at the same time
(2) that theorists should come
down from their ivory towers,
face reality, and try to devise
theories that aid us in grasping
reality.
In addition, Mr. Ullman asks in
his last two paragraphs that we
not take principles seriously. He
says, in effect, since we do not
live in a libertarian society, I
should not measure the present
society against tough libertarian
standards of justice and freedom.
The answer, Mr. Ullman, is that I
do not believe that whatever is, is
right, and therefore I try to
analyze the concrete events in the
news and concrete social problems
in the light of radical libertarian
principles. I choose such concrete
subjects (and not the flight from
reality and idylls that Mr. Ullman
speaks of) because I believe that
correct theories should provide
answers to practical problems
(i.e., a unity of theory and
practice).
Finally, I do not speak for
Milton Friedman or Chris Hocker.
I disagree with each of them on
some issues and agree with them
on others, as Mr. Ullman himself
probably does.
Since Mr. Ullman's arguments
do not seem to make much sense,

one cannot be sure exactly why
he resents libertarian critiques of
the government. Perhaps a direct
attack on his own interests is the
source of his discomfort. Mr.
Ullman's father is Rep. A 1 Ullman
(D—Ore.), the second-ranking
member on the House Ways and
Means Committee.
Bill Evers
'Daily' Columnist
(And Mr. Hocker replies:)
Beside offering a second to the
sentiments expressed by Bill
Evers, I would like to add a few
observations of my own.
Limitations of space and time
prevent me from listing, in
chronological order, the number
of people in history who have
successfully defied "reality" as
defined by their opponents. The
nature and wording of Mr.
Ullman's complaint suggest that
he is upset because libertarians fail
to agree with him, or accept his
notions of reality. He would
rather we went away and left him
alone, and not annoy him with
such distractions as principles and
ideals.
In response to his specific
question asking why the Daily
runs two libertarian columnists:
You're just lucky, I guess.

just that—inane, and absurd as

Wayne Ullman
Junior, Economics
(Mr. Evers replies:)
Mr. Ullman's letter is a
combination of ad hominem
arguments, logical mistakes, and
errors of fact.
First, I consider myself
politically of the left. I am an
anarchist.
The designations left and right
are derived historically from the
seating in an assembly where the
supporters of the French
Revolution sat on the left and the
opponents on the right. I believe
that the French Revolution was
on balance a good thing. If Mr.
Ullman has some special meaning
of left and right, he should make
this clear.
It is illogical to maintain, as

Mr. Ullman does, (1) that
theorists and their theories should
remain in ivory towers divorced
from reality, and at the same time
(2) that theorists should come
down from their ivory towers,
face reality, and try to devise
theories that aid us in grasping
reality.
In addition, Mr. Ullman asks in
his last two paragraphs that we
not take principles seriously. He
says, in effect, since we do not
live in a libertarian society, I
should not measure the present
society against tough libertarian
standards of justice and freedom.
The answer, Mr. Ullman, is that I
do not believe that whatever is, is
right, and therefore I try to
analyze the concrete events in the
news and concrete social problems
in the light of radical libertarian
principles. I choose such concrete
subjects (and not the flight from
reality and idylls that Mr. Ullman
speaks of) because I believe that
correct theories should provide
answers to practical problems
(i.e., a unity of theory and
practice).
Finally, I do not speak for
Milton Friedman or Chris Hocker.
I disagree with each of them on
some issues and agree with them
on others, as Mr. Ullman himself
probably does.
Since Mr. Ullman's arguments
do not seem to make much sense,

one cannot be sure exactly why
he resents libertarian critiques of
the government. Perhaps a direct
attack on his own interests is the
source of his discomfort. Mr.
Ullman's father is Rep. A 1 Ullman
(D—Ore.), the second-ranking
member on the House Ways and
Means Committee.
Bill Evers
'Daily' Columnist
(And Mr. Hocker replies:)
Beside offering a second to the
sentiments expressed by Bill
Evers, I would like to add a few
observations of my own.
Limitations of space and time
prevent me from listing, in
chronological order, the number
of people in history who have
successfully defied "reality" as
defined by their opponents. The
nature and wording of Mr.
Ullman's complaint suggest that
he is upset because libertarians fail
to agree with him, or accept his
notions of reality. He would
rather we went away and left him
alone, and not annoy him with
such distractions as principles and
ideals.
In response to his specific
question asking why the Daily
runs two libertarian columnists:
You're just lucky, I guess.
Chris Hocker
'Daily' columnist
Off In The Bleachers
Editor:
It's always interesting to read
the libertarian views of Messrs.
Evers and know, sort
of an escape from reality, like a
Buster Keaton flick or an evening
watching commerical television.
Why is it that two of the Daily's
four regular columnists are off in
the bleachers in right field while
most of us are trying to
understand the real problems of
society and economy?
I have nothing against theorists
(which is exactly what libertarians
are) so long as they remain in
their ivory towers. If Milton
Friedman went about his work
objectively instead of trying to
develop theories that support his
preconceived political ideals,
perhaps his brilliance as an
'academic' would be of some use.
Come on, Bill and Chris, I'm
tired of hearing rhetoric. Stop
trying to view every issue in
idyllic libertarian terms. We do
not live in a libertarian society nor
economy and libertarian ideals
simply do not apply to the
practical questions we do face.

"Libertarian Revolution" comes,

comments about present
