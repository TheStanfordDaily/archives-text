# Ljubljana Troupe Performs
## 
### HOWARD BOOSTER 
A study in contrast was the
order of the evening as the Singers
and Dancers of Ljubljana
presented a truly thrilling
performance at Zellerbach
Auditorium on March 2. The
troupe consists of two separate

groups: the France Marolt
Dancers and the Tone Tomsic
Choir, each showing true
virtuosity in their own mediums.
The dancers and the choir
alternated sections of the
evening's program.
The evening began with a suite
of dances from Slovenia. The
scene was a small village square
where the peasants have gathered
to celebrate the good harvest. One
of the young men throws some
money to the musicians and thus
buys the right to lead the dance.
At one point, one of the men is

left without a partner and the
others console him by giving him
a broom to dance with. To the
great amusement of his friends, he
expresses a great love for his new
found "girlfriend" and proceeds
to dance with her. Then suddenly
he turns and chases everyone off

stage with the broom.
As the house lights come up
slightly, the choir, dressed in
traditional black and white, march
onto the stage. After the spirit of
the dancers this was somewhat of
a shock.
The choir sang a number of
choral arrangements of the
traditional folksongs of
Jugoslavia. While the songs had
definitely lost their folk flavor in
the process of arrangement for
full choir, the singers sang so well
that the audience didn't care and
responded with great enthusiasm.

One of the singers evidently liked
his audience too, as at one point
he pulled out a camera and
flashed a picture of the astonished
faces.
This writer was particularly
amused by the choice of songs of
this somber and austere group.

"Moj ocka so me Rekli" is a song
in which a young village boy
sings: "My father has asked me to
marry. But what girl should 1
take? If I take a big one she will
throw me out of the house. If I
take a small one she'll get lost in
my bed. If I take a fat one, she
can melt in the sun. If I take a
young one — when shall I sleep!
Yet I'll take the young one: I'll
love her during the night and
work in the fields during the
day."
Difficult Dance
The most popular dance of the
evening was "Sopsko Oro." This is
a dance of the Macedonian
herdsmen where they depict the
prancing and pawing steps of their
horses. The dancers try to outdo
each other in the complexity and

speed of their variations of the
basic step.
This was by far the most
technically difficult dance and
was done with the perfect
precision and style that
characterized the entire show.
It was very refreshing to see a
group that has not stylized their
dances for stage so much that
they lose their vital folk feeling.
Mirko Ramovs choreographed the
suites so that the dances flowed
together and the total staging was
appealing, but each dance retained
its identity.
Thus the performance was one
such as you might see in the
villages of Jugoslavia, and not a
modern dance routine with a few
folk dance steps thrown in, as so
often happens with groups lately.

herdsmen where they depict the
prancing and pawing steps of their
horses. The dancers try to outdo
each other in the complexity and

speed of their variations of the
basic step.
This was by far the most
technically difficult dance and
was done with the perfect
precision and style that
characterized the entire show.
It was very refreshing to see a
group that has not stylized their
dances for stage so much that
they lose their vital folk feeling.
Mirko Ramovs choreographed the
suites so that the dances flowed
together and the total staging was
appealing, but each dance retained
its identity.
Thus the performance was one
such as you might see in the
villages of Jugoslavia, and not a
modern dance routine with a few
folk dance steps thrown in, as so
often happens with groups lately.

ARTHUR BARNES — is director of the Stanford Wind Ensemble,
which will present a free concert of 20th century music tonight at 8 in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium. Barnes, leader of the ensemble, is a senior
lecturer on the Stanford music faculty and the University's band
director. He is also the conductor of the Livermore Symphony,
musical director of the Palo Alto Unitarian Church, and a frequent
guest conductor of community orchestras.
A study in contrast was the
order of the evening as the Singers
and Dancers of Ljubljana
presented a truly thrilling
performance at Zellerbach
Auditorium on March 2. The
troupe consists of two separate

groups: the France Marolt
Dancers and the Tone Tomsic
Choir, each showing true
virtuosity in their own mediums.
The dancers and the choir
alternated sections of the
evening's program.
The evening began with a suite
of dances from Slovenia. The
scene was a small village square
where the peasants have gathered
to celebrate the good harvest. One
of the young men throws some
money to the musicians and thus
buys the right to lead the dance.
At one point, one of the men is

left without a partner and the
others console him by giving him
a broom to dance with. To the
great amusement of his friends, he
expresses a great love for his new
found "girlfriend" and proceeds
to dance with her. Then suddenly
he turns and chases everyone off

stage with the broom.
As the house lights come up
slightly, the choir, dressed in
traditional black and white, march
onto the stage. After the spirit of
the dancers this was somewhat of
a shock.
The choir sang a number of
choral arrangements of the
traditional folksongs of
Jugoslavia. While the songs had
definitely lost their folk flavor in
the process of arrangement for
full choir, the singers sang so well
that the audience didn't care and
responded with great enthusiasm.

One of the singers evidently liked
his audience too, as at one point
he pulled out a camera and
flashed a picture of the astonished
faces.
This writer was particularly
amused by the choice of songs of
this somber and austere group.

"Moj ocka so me Rekli" is a song
in which a young village boy
sings: "My father has asked me to
marry. But what girl should 1
take? If I take a big one she will
throw me out of the house. If I
take a small one she'll get lost in
my bed. If I take a fat one, she
can melt in the sun. If I take a
young one — when shall I sleep!
Yet I'll take the young one: I'll
love her during the night and
work in the fields during the
day."
Difficult Dance
The most popular dance of the
evening was "Sopsko Oro." This is
a dance of the Macedonian
herdsmen where they depict the
prancing and pawing steps of their
horses. The dancers try to outdo
each other in the complexity and

speed of their variations of the
basic step.
This was by far the most
technically difficult dance and
