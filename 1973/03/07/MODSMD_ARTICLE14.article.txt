# Theta Delts Face KA's For IM Title
## 
### 
The field has been narrowed
from 180 teams to just four, as
the 1973 intramural basketball
season draws to a close tonight
with both the A and B division
championships.
Undefeated Theta Delata Chi,

who entered the playoffs seeded
only fifth, challenges Kappa
Alpha tonight at 8 p.m. for the A
championship. The Theta Delts
won the title last year, and with
6-6 forward Dan Broderick
leading the way, they may win it

all again. The rugged junior
supplies much of the scoring and
rebounding punch for the Theta
Delts.
Senior guard Mark Wilson (6-0)
is the team's floor leader.
Backcourt mates C.J. Martin
(6-o)and Rob Sweeney (5-11) add
outside scoring punch for the
Theta Delts. Leaping forward Jim
Bishop (6-2) will start alongside
Broderick, and Terry Windsor
(6-6) will man the post position.
Marc Allyn (6-2) and Willie
"Bufu" Mannon give the Theta
Delts needed depth for their
fast-paced game.
The KA's are led by swingman
Bruce Menser, an excellent
outside shooter and fine
all-around player. Other front-line
starters for the KA's will be Bill
Wiley (6-4) and Randy "Railroad"
Barnes.
Former footballer Steve
Murray (6-1) and A 1 Christoff
(6-1) will start at the guards. The
KA's defeated the Zeegs in
overtime, and beat SAE last night
to advance to the playoffs.
Monday night the Theta Delts
shut off Max Goldstein and the
No Names 58-33, and last night
they upset the tournament's
number-one seed, Nickel Bag, to
advance to the championship.
In the B division, Rinconada
'69 upset number-one seeded Porf
A's 39-24 in last night's semifinal
action. The unseeded Daily
continued their domination with a
50-31 win over Larkin West. The
Daily used a balanced attack to
record its seventh straight win,
with 16 points being the closest
margin.
Guard Stan Wilson (6-0) and
forward John Vercelli (6-6) are
each averaging around twenty

points a game. Post man Charlie
Hoffman (6-7) aids in the Daily's
domination of the boards, while
Guard Buz Battle (6-1) and
forward Don Tollefson (6-1) add
scoring punch. The B
championship is scheduled for 7
p.m. The Daily beat number-two
seeded Roble 64-35 on Monday
night to advance to tonight's
championship.

all-around player. Other front-line
starters for the KA's will be Bill
Wiley (6-4) and Randy "Railroad"
Barnes.
Former footballer Steve
Murray (6-1) and A 1 Christoff
(6-1) will start at the guards. The
KA's defeated the Zeegs in
overtime, and beat SAE last night

they upset the tournament's
number-one seed, Nickel Bag, to
advance to the championship.
In the B division, Rinconada
'69 upset number-one seeded Porf
A's 39-24 in last night's semifinal
action. The unseeded Daily
continued their domination with a
50-31 win over Larkin West. The
Daily used a balanced attack to
record its seventh straight win,
with 16 points being the closest
margin.
Guard Stan Wilson (6-0) and
forward John Vercelli (6-6) are
each averaging around twenty

points a game. Post man Charlie
Hoffman (6-7) aids in the Daily's
domination of the boards, while
Guard Buz Battle (6-1) and
forward Don Tollefson (6-1) add
scoring punch. The B
championship is scheduled for 7

FINAL FRAME — Bruce Menser will lead the Kappa Alpha basketball
contingent into tonight's intramural A division championships against
the Theta Delts at 8 p.m. in Maples Pavilion. The B finals matches
Rinconada '69 and the Daily at 7 p.m.
The field has been narrowed
from 180 teams to just four, as
the 1973 intramural basketball
season draws to a close tonight
with both the A and B division
championships.
Undefeated Theta Delata Chi,

who entered the playoffs seeded
only fifth, challenges Kappa
Alpha tonight at 8 p.m. for the A
championship. The Theta Delts
won the title last year, and with
6-6 forward Dan Broderick
leading the way, they may win it

all again. The rugged junior
supplies much of the scoring and
rebounding punch for the Theta
Delts.
Senior guard Mark Wilson (6-0)
is the team's floor leader.
Backcourt mates C.J. Martin
(6-o)and Rob Sweeney (5-11) add
outside scoring punch for the
Theta Delts. Leaping forward Jim
Bishop (6-2) will start alongside
Broderick, and Terry Windsor
(6-6) will man the post position.
Marc Allyn (6-2) and Willie
"Bufu" Mannon give the Theta
Delts needed depth for their
fast-paced game.
The KA's are led by swingman
Bruce Menser, an excellent
