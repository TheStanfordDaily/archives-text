# Cal State Hayward Tourney
## Golfers Tied By San Jose...Again 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
It seems like every time Stanford meets San Jose
State on a golf course, the match isn't decided until
the final hole. And every time the competition is
dragged out over 36 holes, the Cards and Spartans
end up in a tie.
Yesterday Silverado Country Club was the scene
of this familiar finish between the two golf powers.
After 36 holes of competition, Stanford and San
Jose State each finished with 590 strokes, tying for
first in the Cal State Hayward tournament.
California finished a distant third at 614,
Sacramento State was fourth at 626, host Hayward
State fifth at 636, and University of Pacific rounded
out the six team field with a 642 total.
Yesterday's finish was strikingly similar to a dual
match between the two teams last year at the
Stanford course. In that match Stanford's Conrad
Nilmeier had an opportunity to win the match on
the final green with a three foot par putt. Nilmeier
missed, however, and the 36 hole match ended in a
27-27 tie.
This time it was San Jose's Mark Lye who had a
chance to determine the outcome on the final green.
Lye needed to get down in two from just in front of
the green for a Spartan victory, but he chipped 10
feet short of the hole and missed his birdie putt.

Stanford and San Jose also dominated the
individual competition. The Spartans' Jim Knoll
fired a brilliant six under par 66 in the morning and
coasted home with a 74 in the afternoon for a five
shot victory over Cardinal sophomore Aly Trompas.
Trompas had rounds of 74-71 for a one over par
145 total.
Stanford players also occupied the next three
places, as Denny Colvin was third with 148 (71-77),
Bruce Robertson fourth at 149 (73-76), and
Nilmeier fifth with 150 (71-79).
Stanford's other two entrants, Bob Chapman and
Dave Baskins, also finished in the top 10. Chapman
tied for eighth with 152 (75-77) and Baskins fired
rounds of 75-78 to tie for 10th at 153.
The team scores were determined by adding the
low four scores from each 18 hole round instead of
the usual procedure of counting the low four 36
hole totals. That fact explains how Stanford could
dominate the individual standings without recording
a team victory.
Ironically the afternoon scores on Silverado's
shorter South course were higher than the morning
scores on the long, tough North layout.
Both Silverado courses are annually used for the
Kaiser International Golf tournament and this year
served as the site of the qualifying for the PGA tour.
