# Wrestlers Set For Nationals

### VLAE KERSHNER 
Two Stanford wrestlers, Chris
Horpel and Emmett Stanton, will
compete in the National
Collegiate Athletic Association's
wrestling tourney, to be held
tomorrow through Saturday at
the University of Washington.

Horpel, a 150-pounder, is
considered Stanford's best hope
for points in the tourney. He
finished second in the Pac-8 meet
two weeks ago, thus securing a
qualifying spot. Horpel has lost
only twice in over 20 matches this
season.

Horpel's leading competition
should come from Jarrett
Hubbard of Michigan State, who
finished second last year, Big-8
champ Pete Galea, an lowa State
freshman, and Mike Fitzpatrick of
the host Huskies, who won the
Pac-8 meet by defeating Horpel
8-4 in a match closer than that
until the final seconds.
Stanton, at 158, is considered a
darkhorse for any national
honors, and indeed was somewhat
a surprise in finishing fourth in
the Pac-8 meet at Oregon. Wade
Scholles of Clarion State is the
favorite in this division.
The two-man contingent
represents the largest
entry Stanford has had in
the NCAA final in years,
according to Coach Joe DeMeo,
whose young team finished 5-7
against strong competition this
year. The Cards placed seventh in
the Pac-8 meet.
lowa State, the defending
national champion, was defeated
by Oklahoma State in the Big-8
meet this year. These two schools
are the only ones which have
qualified full 10-man contingents
for the finals and thus are
considered the favorites.
The host Washington team has
nine qualifiers, as does Penn State.
Ohio University and Pac-8
champion Oregon State have
qualified eight men each.
Other pre-tourney favorites
include Navy, East Carolina,
Michigan, lowa, Wisconsin, and
Oregon, each of whom have seven
wrestlers in the finals.
