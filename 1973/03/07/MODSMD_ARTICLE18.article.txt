# Freestyler Bruce Goodwin
## Hypnosis Aids Freshman Swimming Star 
### MIKE CHASSON 
An athletic program can be
considered fortunate when it is
able to lure outstanding athletes
to its campus without the aid of
scholarships.
The swimming team is such an
example. Since it only has a
couple scholarships a year, the
team must rely on some swimmers
coming to Stanford without the
promise of financial reward.
Bruce Goodwin, a tall
freshman from Deerfield
Academy in Massachusetts, is such
a non-scholarship athlete.
Goodwin, though a prep school
All-American in the 50 and 100
freestyles, was not offered a "free
ride" at Stanford.
Bruce's introduction to
collegiate swimming was rather
rough as he had a swimming
background that could be best
termed sparse when compared to
most swimmers in the Pacific
Eight. "I was just a mess last fall,"
explained the lanky architecture
major. "It was really tough
keeping up with the rest of the
team."
Slow Start
Bruce didn't start training
every day until his sophomore
year at Deerfield. His training
consisted of 3,000-4,000 yards a
day during a four month season,
with the hardest day ever
consisting of 5,300 yards in a two
hour session.
At Stanford he started
swimming in the fall and found
the going rough because most of

those who turned out for the
team had trained during the
summer while he hadn't worked
out since March.
It wasn't until the team
travelled to Hawaii over Christmas
vacation that Bruce felt he could
keep up with the rest of the team.
He then started winter quarter
with twice a day workouts for
two days, going 13,000 yards each
day.
"I thought it was tough at
Deerfield," stated Goodwin who
now trains on 5,000-6,000 yards a
day under the direction of
assistant coach Jeff Hammett.
"But at Stanford we do twice as
much in the same time."
Continuous Improvement
Goodwin's rise to stardom on
the Stanford team was marked by
continuous improvement over the
dual meet season. He came into
his own in the dual meet with
Southern California where he
upset the Trojans and his fellow
teammates to win the 50 free in a
lifetime best of 21.4 and finish
second in the 100 in another
lifetime best of 47.5.
Much of Bruce's success can be
attributed to his serious approach
to workouts. While many sprinters
pick and choose what they work
in a training session Goodwin goes
hard on almost everything.
"I decided in prep school I
might as well go all out in practice
because if I was going to spend
two hours in the water I wasn't
going to waste my time."
"I just got tired of dying on

the last lap of a race," explained
Goodwin. "I didn't want to feel as
if I had a gang of gorillas on my
back when I was swimming."
Hypnosis
Goodwin has caused a minor
sensation among the team this
year by hypnotizing himself
before all of the big dual meets.
Using techniques learned in a
self-hypnosis course taught at The
Bridge on weekends, he makes
himself become more relaxed and
better able to concentrate on his
races.
Before his races he counts
himself into a hypnosis state in a

secluded location. He then
employes what he terms "a
yoga-tyr "<>' to totally relax
his body. He concentrated on
each muscle in his body starting at
the feet and working up to the
head. The ritual involves among
other things a phase where Bruce
goes over the race in his mind and
makes suggestions to himself to
swim fast.
"I am completely aware of
what I am doing before each race,
and am not in any type of trance.
I consider it no different from any
other type of psyching-up method
before a race."

His worst meet of the season
was in the Northwest against
Washington and Oregon where he
didn't hypnotize himself. Against
Indiana and UCLA he did
hypnotize himself before the race,
but counted himself out of the
hypnotic state before the start of
the race. In the meet against USC
he remained the hypnotic state
and swam his best meet of the
season.
"I consider it more superstition
than anything else now. I was just
in better shape later in the season
than against Washington." He
emphasizes that it does not
eliminate pain and he still hurts
on the last 25 of the 100 free.
"Supposedly we are going to learn
how to subvert pain later in the
course, but I don't plan to rely on
it to swim my races."
Goodwin tuned up for the
most important meet of his young
career, the NCAA Championships,
by placing fourth in the 50 free
and seventh in the 100 free at the
Pacific Eight Championships last
weekend. He also led off the
Cardinals fourth place 400 yard
free relay with a lifetime best of
47.2.
One can only observe that if
Stanford is to rise to the top of
the national swimming picture
once again with its limited
available scholarships, more
swimmers such as Bruce Goodwin
will have to come "on their own."
Or maybe Coach Gaughran will
just have to make hypnosis
mandatory.

NO MORE SUNSHlNE—Stanford's varsity baseball game was rained
out again yesterday, leaving the Cardinal record at 10 wins, 3 losses,
and 9 rainouts. Bob Hampton (shown here bunting in an earlier
victory over USF) and his teammates will try again this afternoon
when the Cards travel to San Jose for a 2 p.m. game against San Jose
State. Thursday Stanford plays Santa Clara at Santa Clara with
another game against the Broncos slated for Sunken Diamond on
Friday.
