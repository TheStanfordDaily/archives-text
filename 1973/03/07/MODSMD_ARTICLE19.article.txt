# Shuffling The Cards
## Kelley Deserves All-League 
### Dave Robinson 
The Pacific Eight All-League team will be
announced a week from today and this year there is
considerable suspense concerning the four players
who will join UCLA's Bill Walton on the 1973
squad.
Washington guard Louie Nelson, the league's
leading scorer, seems to be a likely choice, especially
after two superb efforts last weekend in the
Huskies' victories over Oregon and Oregon State.
Consistent UCLA forward Keith Wilkes should also
poll enough votes from the league's coaches.
The final two spots are up for grabs, however,
and Stanford's Rich Kelley should be one of the
leading contenders. Kelley has won almost universal
praise from coaches and players during an
outstanding sophomore season. He is currently
averaging 17.0 points and 13.4 rebounds a game,
while shooting at a 52.1 percent clip and connecting
on 70.2 percent of his free throw tries.
In Pac-8 play, the talented seven-footer is the
only player in the conference to rank among the
league leaders in all four statistical categories. He is
fifth in scoring with a 16.6 average, second in
rebounding with 13.4 rebounds a game, third in
field goal percentage with a .532 mark, and 12th in
free throw shooting at .735.
Harsh man Impressed
Washington coach MarvHarshman watched Kelley
demolish his Huskies with 24 points in Seattle and
then with 28 points in Stanford's second victory
over Washington at Maples Pavilion.
"Kelley has become an outstanding shooter away
from the basket, and he is a more physical player
now than when we first say him," Harshman said
after Stanford's 76-66 victory at Maples. "Outside
of Walton, he is the best big man we've faced all
year."
Stanford coach Howie Dallmar expected Kelley
to have a big impact on the Card basketball
program, but Kelley's play has been even more
outstanding than Dallmar predicted. Last weekend
he scored his 400 th point of the season, becoming
the seventh sophomore in Stanford history to break

into the mythical "400 Point Club."
After Kelley scored 41 points and grabbed 31
rebounds in a weekend split against the Oregon
schools, Dallmar said, "We have come to expect one
good performance after another from Rich, and he
never seems to disappoint us. He's still finding out
how good he can really be at this game, and I'm
really pleased with the way he's come along."
Versatility
Kelley had one of his worst statistical weekends
last week in Los Angeles but he displayed amazing
versatility in the Cards' victory over USC and near
miss against UCLA. Against the Trojans on Friday
night, he was held to a season low of five points, but
his rebounding and play at the "point" in Stanford's
delay game secured the Cardinal victory.
The next night at Pauley Pavilion Kelley played
Walton one-on-one for most of the game, a task that
would make most centers wilt with stage fright. But
Kelley played confident, aggressive basketball
against the Bruin All-American, outrebounding
Walton 15-10 while losing the scoring battle 23-15.
It was a remarkable performance for Kelley, who
has had to live with the words "outside of Walton"
tagged on to every statement about him all year.
Next week, since the Pac-8 All-League team is
not chosen by position (the coaches simply vote for
the five best players), Kelley has a chance to be
included as an equal in the same sentence with
Walton.
He deserves it.
*****
Friday night at the Sports Arena, Mike Mann
made a revelation that would make most coaches
shudder. "I don't screen out anymore," he said,
explaining his recent rebounding improvement.
"When I screen out I always get hit and never get to
the board. Now I just go for the ball and don't
worry about blocking out my man."
Mann grabbed nine rebounds against the Trojans
and picked off 17 the week before against
Washington State. His theory is unconventional, but
it sure seems to be working.
