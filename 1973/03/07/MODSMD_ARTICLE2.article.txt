# No NLRB Election, Lyman Tells Press
## 
### GLENN GARVIN 
President Richard Lyman told a
panel of student journalists last night
he didn't know of any plans to
petition the National Labor Relations
Board next month for a union election
among Stanford employees.
The last such election (to choose a
union for collective bargaining) was
held April 19, 1972. NLRB regulations
allow an election every year if a union
petitions for one, but Lyman claimed
he hadn't heard anything about it.
"I have no reason to believe so," he
told a reporter who asked if the
University had been notified of plans
to petition. At least one campus
union, United Stanford Employees, is
collecting employee signatures for an
election petition.
Union On Campus?
Lyman refused to indicate whether
he favored the presence of a union on
campus. "I don't want to enter into
that," he told the journalists on
KZSU's "Campus Conference"
program. "Stanford employees will
always be in a position to decide that
question."
"I wouldn't for a moment try to
pretend the University would be
fatally affected [by a union]," Lyman
continued. "On the other hand, the
University wouldn't be quite the same
place ever again."
In the last election, employees
voted overwhelmingly to reject the
Teamsters as a bargaining agent.
Proposed Budget
On a different subject, Lyman
denied members of the Faculty Senate
were instructed not to discuss the
University's proposed budget for next
year.
"The Senate was not asked not to
say anything in the Senate meeting.
They were simply asked not to spread
it after that," Lyman said. "To an
extent, if the proposals are all out in
front, the Trustees think they are
confronted with an established fact."
The Trustees will be asked to
approve the budget at their March 13
meeting. Lyman said a "minor crisis"
would result if they refused.

"Rubberstamp is too strong a word"
to use in reference to the Trustees,
Lyman said. But he admitted the
Trustees rarely modify budget
proposals set before them.
Lyman said that after the proposal
is made to the Trustees it will be
published and distributed throughout
the Stanford community.
He criticized a petition on student
rights being circulated by the Stanford
Committee on Political Education as
"more mischievous than helpful. It
wouldn't put us in any better position
than we are now."
Lyman claimed the portion of the
petition dealing with privacy would
prevent the University from
submitting to federal compliance
reviews of affirmative action programs.
