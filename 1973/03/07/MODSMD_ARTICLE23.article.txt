POW Tortures Reported
CLARK AIR BASE, Philippines — Most
American war prisoners who signed anti-war
statements during captivity did so under
extreme duress or because of torture, military
informants said yesterday.
The sources said one prisoner told them the
North Vietnamese frequently used a minor
grievance as an excuse to bear down on one
man in an attempt to break him.
In one case, they reported, an American
prisoner was forced to sit in a cell on a small
wooden stool for days at a time without sleep.
Others were put in stocks like Pilgrim sinners.
"After a period of time they would tell
someone anything they wanted to hear," an
official said.
The war prisoners returned to Clark this
week have discussed life in their Communist
jails. But military authorities say they do not
want any details of their story told because
they fear for the 286 Americans still in
captivity.
As a result, the scenes described by military
officers remain short on detail. The prisoners
themselves are forbidden to discuss their
captivity with newsmen except in the most
general terms.
In addition to physical abuse that included
beatings, cigarette burns and suspension from
the ceiling by the hands, the military sources
said many men spent long periods in solitary
confinement.
This included terms of 19 months to 2Vi
years. In some cases prisoners were shackled
and forced to kneel on a concrete floor, the
sources added, and those put into old-fashioned
stocks were freed only for brief periods to go to
the toilet or eat.
The sources said the POWs generally agreed
no one willingly gave antiwar statements.
"Some of the guys were actually very hostile
to the North Vietnamese," an official said.
One POW reportedly was asked by his
captors what he would do if he were released.
"I'd return to the United States, learn how
to fly and come back and bomb you bastards,"
he was reported to have replied.
S. Viet To Free POWg
SAIGON — The South Vietnamese government
agreed today to release 6300 Communist
military prisoners of war, breaking an eight-day

impasse that threatened the entire prisoner
exchange program and the U.S.-Vietnamese
military peacekeeping commission itself.
There were some indications that the Saigon
government gave in to the Communist demands
at U.S. insistence since the further release of
American POWs might also be threatened if the
impasse continued.
The South Vietnamese had been offering to
release only 3000 prisoners. The North
Vietnamese and Viet Cong delegations said they
would boycott meetings of the Joint Military
Commission and its subcommission on
prisoners until South Vietnam agreed to release
a fourth of the PQWs it still holds, or about
6300.
"The details of the releases, times and
locations will be determined by the
subcommission on prisoners," a U.S.

spokesman said after a meeting this morning of
the Joint Military Commission. The
subcommission also was meeting in the morning
and again in the afternoon.
Rogers Sees Viet Peace
WASHINGTON — Secretary of State William P.
Rogers told the House Foreign Affairs
Committee yesterday he is confident a military
peace can be maintained in Vietnam but said
prospects for a political settlement are
questionable.
Testifying about the international agreement
to support the cease-fire in Vietnam, Rogers
said: "I do not expect there will be any major
military engagements in that area. I hope I'm
right."
The secretary, under persistent questioning,
said he thought the opposing factions in
Vietnam had decided war was not going to
solve the problems of Indochina. Therefore,
Rogers continued, "there are going to be
political problems."
On this score, he described himself as
"hopeful, but realistic."
On another matter, Rogers assured the
committee that any assistance program for
North Vietnam would require prior
congressional approval.

"There will be no attempt to hide anything
from Congress," he said in the face of some
evident hostility.
One committee member, Rep. Wayne Hays
(D-Ohio), told Rogers: "I'm not going to accept
money for North Vietnam when there is no
money for housing for the elderly."
Hays also threatened to stall his
subcommittee's review of the State Department
budget and said he might sponsor an
amendment to bar any funds for Hanoi
without direct approval of Congress.
Rep. H.R. Gross (R-Iowa), said bluntly: "I
would not give North Vietnam one cockeyed
dime for reparations."
Airlines Boycott France
PARIS — Most European airlines boycotted
French skies yesterday as controversy flared

over responsibility for the disastrous collision
of two Spanish jetliners flying under French
military air traffic control.
The 68 persons aboard one of the planes, a
twin-engineDC9 of the Spanish airline Iberia,
were killed when the fuselage fell apart Monday
29,000 feet over Nantes in western France.
The other plane, a four-engine Coronado of
the Spanish charter company Spantax, landed
safely with its 99 passengers and nine crew
members. Both planes were flying over France
on the way to London during a civil air
controllers strike.
Transport Minister Robert Galley and the air
force chief of staff, Gen. Claude Grigaut called
a joint news conference and placed major blame
on the Coronado pilot. They cleared the
military traffic control of responsibility.
The French government put the nation's
entire airspace under military control two
weeks ago in response to the strike.
Indian Talks Continue
WOUNDED KNEE, S.D. — The Indian takeover
of Wounded Knee entered its second week
yesterday with more talks but no settlement.
Officials of the Justice and Interior
departments met with attorneys representing
the Indians last night and then said they have

given the Indians a final opportunity to make a
proposal for a settlement of the armed
stalemate.
The Wounded Knee Indians want the
Interior Department to intervene in their tribal
dispute with Richard Wilson, the elected
president of the Oglala Sioux. Most of the
13,000 members of the tribe live on the Pine
Ridge Reservation, where Wounded Knee is
located.
Pearl S. Buck Dies
DANBY, Vt. — Pearl S. Buck, author of "The
Good Earth" and scores of other books on a
China she knew firsthand, died yesterday. The
Nobel and Pulitzer Prize-winning author was
80.
Buck, who had been in failing health since
last summer because of pleurisy and a gall
bladder operation, died in her Danby home less
than a week after publication of her 85th book,
"All Under Heaven." The novel is about an
American diplomat forced to leave Peking after
the takeover by Mao Tse-tung.
In Washington, President Nixon described
Buck as "a human bridge between the
civilization of the East and the West."
Buck did not begin publishing until 1929,
but within two years she had won the Pulitzer
Prize for "The Good Earth," the story of a
Chinese peasant's rise to power.
In 1938 she became the first American
woman to win the Nobel Prize for Literature on
the basis of six of her works on China. The
award made special mention of two 1936
biographies of her missionary parents — "The
Exile" and "Fighting Angel."
Born Pearl Sydenstricker in Hillsboro,
W.Va., on June 26, 1892, Buck went to China
with her parents as an infant and learned to
speak Chinese before she spoke English.
She returned to America and Europe for
schooling but spent most of her first 43 years in
China, living in various villages.
