# Age Limit Quiets Sunday Flicks

### CHESS ERWIN 
The recent ban on the attendance of non-students
under age 18 at the ASSU Sunday Flicks was apparently
successful this week because no disruptions occurred,
according to Flicks Manager Baker Terry.
The official policy concerning future attendance at the
film series had been amended as a result of the continued
disturbances. "No non-Stanford students under the age of
18 will be admitted unless accompanied by a parent or a
lawful guardian."
Terry explained that the management of the Film
Series had to resort to this policy in an effort to put an
end to the activities of "a small minority" of teenagers
and others who abused the privilege of attendance at the
films by their behavior. Numerous complaints by students
and adults at the movies had prompted the restrictions, he
added.
"Ideally," he said, "we would like to be able to handle
this situation on an individual basis, but under the
circumstances that just isn't possible. Only a small group
of kids cause the difficulties we've experienced. It's too
bad that all these kids must suffer as a result of the
actions of a few, but there is nothing else that can be
done."
Attendance at the Flicks is on its way to setting an
all-time high, according to Terry. He attributed this to an
outstanding program of films as well as generally greater
student interest in the series during the wintertime.
Interest in the Flicks has been increasing all year long, but

will probably begin to trail off somewhat going into
Spring quarter as movie-goers find other ways to entertain
themselves outdoors, he added.
As a result of the great increase in popularity of the
movies, the Flicks management has been able to hold the
price of admission down to 50 cents, despite the higher
costs of presenting recent and better films. Prices of
concessions have been reduced in many cases for the same
reason.
Terry noted that four of this winter's first
presentations, including Dr. Zhivago and Lawrence of
Arabia, topped the gate performance of any film last
season. He said that attendance reaches a peak in the first
few weeks of a quarter and declines somewhat toward the
end as students prefer studying to attending the Flicks.
Looking ahead to Spring quarter, Terry said that he
had scheduled Harold and Maude as well as A Separate
Peace, and that other films under consideration include
Gone With The Wind and Nicholas and Alexandra.
Relying almost entirely on a flyer announcing the
schedule of the quarter's films in the registration packets
and on ads in the Daily, Terry noted that he was very
gratified at the support the Flicks have gotten from the
University community.
"The Flicks are run as a service to the student
community here." he concluded, "and as long as we
continue to do so well, we'll do the best we can in
providing the best possible movies at the lowest cost we
can.
