# Project SCOR Draws Criticism From Chicano Students, Faculty
## 
### CHRISTY WISE 
A research project to explore the
possibilities of changing behavior to
minimize risk factors of heart disease
has raised controversy here among
Chicano students and faculty.
Project SCOR (Scientific Center on
Research), a joint study by the School
of Medicine and the Department of
Communication, is "a campaign to
reduce heart disease," according to
Communication Prof. Nathan
Maccoby. SCOR is specifically
concerned with exploring four risk
areas related to heart disease: smoking,
diet, body weight and physical activity
or exercise.
The project involves identification
of three similar target communities of
about 10,000 population. Last fall, in
each of three communities
(Watsonville, Gilroy and Tracy), the
study was described to a random
sample of adults, ages 35-59.
Participants in the project signed
written consent forms, and were given
partial physical examinations.
'Chicano Component' Added
Upon discovering the existence in
each of the communities of a 20-30
percent Mexican-American population,
researchers after several months of
deliberation decided to add a
"Chicano component" to the study,
by implementing an independent
Spanish-language campaign and
analyzing the results separately.
Chicano students and faculty are
concerned that in studying separately
the Mexican-American population in
each of the communities, researchers
may discover effective behavior change
methods unique to Chicano
communities, which they fear might
be misused.
A 10-month mass media campaign
will be applied to communities A and
B aimed at inducing behavior change
to minimize heart disease.
Instruction Campaign
In community A, coinciding with
the media campaign, an intensive
instruction campaign will be applied,

involving a high-risk subset of 200
adults. The instruction campaign will
consist of frequent sessions of the
subset with the researchers in an
encounter group atmosphere.
In community B only the mass
media campaign will be used, and in C,
the control community, no campaigns
will be applied.
An "after-only" sample will be
given in the first two communities to
determine the effect of the media
campaign on people who were not
previously alerted to the study.
Chicanos' Aid Asked
Researchers originally sought the
help of Chicano graduate students in
communication. The students decided
that SCOR failed to meet the needs of
the Chicano community and have
since issued a statement condemning
the project.
They demand that the Chicano
component of SCOR be dissolved and
its personnel be absorbed by the
overall project, and that public
disclosure be made of the budget,
research design and data gathered for
this component.
Chicano faculty members share the
concerns of the Chicano

communication students that not all
Spanish-speaking subjects understood
the project before giving consent and
that subjects with medical problems
were not properly taken care of.
The faculty would like SCOR to
insure that researchers allow full
participation of Chicanos in making
decisions involving research done in
the Chicano communities. They also
want SCOR to allow for monitoring of
the project for adherence to these and
other stipulations.
According to Maccoby the
researchers "found some of their
concerns very well founded .... We
are more than willing to get their help
and cooperation in making sure we do
this in the best possible way."
Committee Formed
A committee of Chicano faculty,
Chicano communication students and
principle investigators has been formed
which Medicine Prof. John Farquhar
hopes "will be effective in handling
the concerns that have been raised."
Farquhar explained that "this kind
of public health is already going on"
with media spots and informational
campaigns. The researchers, he says,
are "simply taking these things and

measuring the effect."
Anthro. Prof. Renato Rosaldo Jr.,
"pessimistic" about the committee,
feels its success "depends on whether
the students want to do it. We're not
going to do it ourselves." He added,
"Everybody has to participate or else
it doesn't mean anything."
The Administrative Panel on
Human Subjects in Research ascertains
the probability of psychological and
physical risks to human subjects.
Business Prof. David Bradford, acting
chairman of the Panel, explained, "It's
not a question of risk or no risk, but
the severity of the risk and the
probability that it would occur." The
Panel must determine whether the
benefits and results of the study are
worth the risk.
First Phase Approved
The first part of the study, mainly
involving medical examinations, was
approved by the Medical
Subcommittee on the Use of Human
Subjects.
The Behavioral Subcommittee on
Use of Human Subjects subsequently
approved the media campaign for both
Spanish and English-speaking
communities. The general consensus of
the subcommittee is that the Chicano
faculty and student concerns illustrate
potential risks, but probability of
these risks is relatively low.
Investigations by the
subcommittee, though illustrating
some need for improvement, generally
satisfied the members that researchers
did a reasonably good job of getting
consent from the community members
as a whole, and from the individual
subjects.
Investigations also revealed that
researchers followed through
immediately with medical care in cases
where they found something seriously
wrong. Suggestions have been made by
the subcommittee for improvements
such as adequate medical care for less
urgent cases, and full comprehension
of the study by participants.
The subcommittee approved a
second section, allowing the
researchers to analyze the Chicano
component separately from the rest of
the study. They have also been granted
freedom to publish their findings, with
the subcommittee's suggestion that
discretion be used in considering
implications of publication.

Spanish and English-speaking
communities. The general consensus of
the subcommittee is that the Chicano
faculty and student concerns illustrate
potential risks, but probability of
these risks is relatively low.
Investigations by the
subcommittee, though illustrating
some need for improvement, generally
satisfied the members that researchers
did a reasonably good job of getting
consent from the community members
as a whole, and from the individual

Investigations also revealed that

A research project to explore the
possibilities of changing behavior to
minimize risk factors of heart disease
has raised controversy here among
Chicano students and faculty.
Project SCOR (Scientific Center on
Research), a joint study by the School
of Medicine and the Department of
Communication, is "a campaign to
reduce heart disease," according to
Communication Prof. Nathan
Maccoby. SCOR is specifically
concerned with exploring four risk
areas related to heart disease: smoking,
diet, body weight and physical activity
or exercise.
The project involves identification
of three similar target communities of
about 10,000 population. Last fall, in
each of three communities
(Watsonville, Gilroy and Tracy), the
study was described to a random
sample of adults, ages 35-59.
Participants in the project signed
written consent forms, and were given
partial physical examinations.
'Chicano Component' Added
Upon discovering the existence in
each of the communities of a 20-30
percent Mexican-American population,
researchers after several months of
deliberation decided to add a
"Chicano component" to the study,
by implementing an independent
Spanish-language campaign and
analyzing the results separately.
Chicano students and faculty are
concerned that in studying separately
the Mexican-American population in
each of the communities, researchers
may discover effective behavior change
methods unique to Chicano
communities, which they fear might
be misused.
A 10-month mass media campaign
will be applied to communities A and
B aimed at inducing behavior change
to minimize heart disease.
Instruction Campaign
In community A, coinciding with
the media campaign, an intensive
instruction campaign will be applied,

involving a high-risk subset of 200
adults. The instruction campaign will
consist of frequent sessions of the
subset with the researchers in an
encounter group atmosphere.
In community B only the mass
media campaign will be used, and in C,
the control community, no campaigns
will be applied.
An "after-only" sample will be
given in the first two communities to
determine the effect of the media
campaign on people who were not
previously alerted to the study.
Chicanos' Aid Asked
Researchers originally sought the
help of Chicano graduate students in
communication. The students decided
that SCOR failed to meet the needs of
the Chicano community and have
since issued a statement condemning
the project.
They demand that the Chicano
component of SCOR be dissolved and
its personnel be absorbed by the
overall project, and that public
disclosure be made of the budget,
research design and data gathered for
this component.
Chicano faculty members share the
concerns of the Chicano

communication students that not all
Spanish-speaking subjects understood
the project before giving consent and
that subjects with medical problems
were not properly taken care of.
The faculty would like SCOR to
insure that researchers allow full
participation of Chicanos in making
decisions involving research done in
the Chicano communities. They also
want SCOR to allow for monitoring of
the project for adherence to these and
other stipulations.
According to Maccoby the
researchers "found some of their
concerns very well founded .... We
are more than willing to get their help
and cooperation in making sure we do
this in the best possible way."
Committee Formed
A committee of Chicano faculty,
Chicano communication students and
principle investigators has been formed
which Medicine Prof. John Farquhar
hopes "will be effective in handling
the concerns that have been raised."
Farquhar explained that "this kind
of public health is already going on"
with media spots and informational
campaigns. The researchers, he says,
are "simply taking these things and

measuring the effect."
Anthro. Prof. Renato Rosaldo Jr.,
"pessimistic" about the committee,
feels its success "depends on whether
the students want to do it. We're not
going to do it ourselves." He added,
"Everybody has to participate or else
it doesn't mean anything."
The Administrative Panel on
Human Subjects in Research ascertains
the probability of psychological and
physical risks to human subjects.
Business Prof. David Bradford, acting
chairman of the Panel, explained, "It's
not a question of risk or no risk, but
the severity of the risk and the
probability that it would occur." The
Panel must determine whether the
benefits and results of the study are
worth the risk.
First Phase Approved
The first part of the study, mainly
involving medical examinations, was
approved by the Medical
Subcommittee on the Use of Human
Subjects.

"pessimistic" about the committee,
feels its success "depends on whether
the students want to do it. We're not
going to do it ourselves." He added,
"Everybody has to participate or else
it doesn't mean anything."
The Administrative Panel on
Human Subjects in Research ascertains
the probability of psychological and
physical risks to human subjects.
Business Prof. David Bradford, acting
chairman of the Panel, explained, "It's
not a question of risk or no risk, but
the severity of the risk and the
probability that it would occur." The
Panel must determine whether the
benefits and results of the study are
worth the risk.
First Phase Approved
The first part of the study, mainly
involving medical examinations, was
approved by the Medical
Subcommittee on the Use of Human
Subjects.
The Behavioral Subcommittee on
Use of Human Subjects subsequently
approved the media campaign for both
Spanish and English-speaking
communities. The general consensus of
the subcommittee is that the Chicano
faculty and student concerns illustrate
potential risks, but probability of
these risks is relatively low.
Investigations by the
subcommittee, though illustrating
some need for improvement, generally
satisfied the members that researchers
did a reasonably good job of getting
consent from the community members
as a whole, and from the individual
subjects.
Investigations also revealed that
researchers followed through
immediately with medical care in cases
where they found something seriously
wrong. Suggestions have been made by
the subcommittee for improvements
such as adequate medical care for less
urgent cases, and full comprehension
of the study by participants.
The subcommittee approved a
second section, allowing the
researchers to analyze the Chicano
component separately from the rest of
the study. They have also been granted
freedom to publish their findings, with
the subcommittee's suggestion that
discretion be used in considering
implications of publication.
A research project to explore the
possibilities of changing behavior to
minimize risk factors of heart disease
has raised controversy here among
Chicano students and faculty.
Project SCOR (Scientific Center on
Research), a joint study by the School
of Medicine and the Department of
Communication, is "a campaign to
reduce heart disease," according to
Communication Prof. Nathan
Maccoby. SCOR is specifically
concerned with exploring four risk
areas related to heart disease: smoking,
diet, body weight and physical activity
or exercise.
The project involves identification
of three similar target communities of
about 10,000 population. Last fall, in
each of three communities
(Watsonville, Gilroy and Tracy), the
study was described to a random
sample of adults, ages 35-59.
Participants in the project signed
written consent forms, and were given
partial physical examinations.
'Chicano Component' Added
Upon discovering the existence in
each of the communities of a 20-30
percent Mexican-American population,
researchers after several months of
deliberation decided to add a
"Chicano component" to the study,
by implementing an independent
Spanish-language campaign and
analyzing the results separately.
Chicano students and faculty are
concerned that in studying separately
the Mexican-American population in
each of the communities, researchers
may discover effective behavior change
methods unique to Chicano
communities, which they fear might
be misused.
A 10-month mass media campaign
will be applied to communities A and
B aimed at inducing behavior change
to minimize heart disease.
Instruction Campaign
In community A, coinciding with
the media campaign, an intensive
instruction campaign will be applied,

involving a high-risk subset of 200
adults. The instruction campaign will
consist of frequent sessions of the
subset with the researchers in an
encounter group atmosphere.
In community B only the mass
media campaign will be used, and in C,
the control community, no campaigns
will be applied.
An "after-only" sample will be
given in the first two communities to
determine the effect of the media
campaign on people who were not
previously alerted to the study.
Chicanos' Aid Asked
Researchers originally sought the
help of Chicano graduate students in
communication. The students decided
that SCOR failed to meet the needs of
the Chicano community and have
since issued a statement condemning
the project.
They demand that the Chicano
component of SCOR be dissolved and
its personnel be absorbed by the
overall project, and that public
disclosure be made of the budget,
research design and data gathered for
this component.
Chicano faculty members share the
concerns of the Chicano

communication students that not all
Spanish-speaking subjects understood
the project before giving consent and
that subjects with medical problems
were not properly taken care of.
The faculty would like SCOR to
insure that researchers allow full
participation of Chicanos in making
decisions involving research done in
the Chicano communities. They also
want SCOR to allow for monitoring of
the project for adherence to these and
other stipulations.
According to Maccoby the
researchers "found some of their
concerns very well founded .... We
are more than willing to get their help
and cooperation in making sure we do
this in the best possible way."
Committee Formed
A committee of Chicano faculty,
Chicano communication students and
principle investigators has been formed
which Medicine Prof. John Farquhar
hopes "will be effective in handling
the concerns that have been raised."
Farquhar explained that "this kind
of public health is already going on"
with media spots and informational
campaigns. The researchers, he says,
are "simply taking these things and

measuring the effect."
Anthro. Prof. Renato Rosaldo Jr.,
"pessimistic" about the committee,
feels its success "depends on whether
the students want to do it. We're not
going to do it ourselves." He added,
