# CIA Analyst Testifies In 'Papers' Trial
## U.S. Military Planners Rebuked 
### ED KOHN Special to the Daily 
LOS ANGELES - A Central
Intelligence Agency analyst charged
yesterday in the "Pentagon Papers"
trial that American military planners
"purposefully" underestimated Viet
Cong troop strength before, during
and after the January, 1968 Tet
offensive.
Samuel A. Adams, a key defense
witness, made the allegation as he
testified about a section of the
top-secret "Wheeler Report," a late

February, 1968 assessment of military
operations in Vietnam prepared by the
then-Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, Gen. Earle G. Wheeler.
The "Wheeler Report," which
contained a request for 206,000 more
troops later rejected by President
Johnson, estimated Viet Cong troop
strength at 240,000 men. Adams, who
spent six years studying Viet Cong
motivation, intelligence operations and
troop strength, testified that he
believed the figure to be close to
600,000 men.
In order to show reduced Viet Cong
troop strength, Adams asserted,
military intelligence officers deleted
several categories of "foemen," such as
poorly-armed irregular troops, from
their "orders of battle" (troop
strength estimates), and
underestimated Viet Cong strength in
other categories, including guerrilla
operatives.
'Political Reasons'
However, Presiding Judge Matt
Byrne Jr. blocked a series of defense
questions designed to establish
precisely why the United States
Military Assistance Command Vietnam
(MACV) chose not to recognize and
report the true Viet Cong troop
strength. Adams said he believed the
lower figure was used for "political
reasons" at the behest of Wheeler and
Gen. William C. Westmoreland.
Adams testified that the
information — which he termed
"extremely suspect" — in the
"Wheeler Report" would be "virtually
useless" to a foreign analyst in 1969,
the time period specified in the
13-count espionage, conspiracy and
theft indictment against defendants
Daniel Ellsberg and Anthony J. Russo
Jr.
He added that the report's
disclosure did not damage the national

interest. Last week, retired Navy Rear
Adm. Gene Laßocque offered similar
testimony.
Prosecution Witnesses
Earlier, several prosecution
witnesses, including one of the authors
of the "Report," testified that release
of the documents could have damaged
the national defense and may have
proved useful to foreign intelligence
analysts.
Lt. Gen. William DePuy, the first
prosecution witness, testified Jan. 18
that the study "proved useful in
planning" North Vietnam's
highly-successful April, 1972
offensive.
Said DePuy: "This might be the
best piece of information that they
[the North Vietnamese] ever had."
Report Preparation
DePuy, the Army's top planning
officer in MACV immediately prior to
the large-scale introduction of
American forces, was one of the eight
officers who assisted Wheeler in the
preparation of his report.
Adams, schooled at Harvard
University, made four trips to South
Vietnam during the late 1960's to
study American and North Vietnamese
intelligence operations. He concluded
that the North Vietnamese operation
was far superior to that of the
Americans.
A CIA employee for nine years,
Adams testified that South
Vietnamese intelligence operations
were heavily infiltrated and that Viet
Cong planners frequently had detailed
American battle plans two to four
weeks before the operations began.
Meanwhile, CBS News reported
that the next defense witness will be
McGeorge Bundy, a national security
affairs adviser to President Kennedy
and Johnson who is now president ot
the Ford Foundation.

Cong planners frequently had detailed
American battle plans two to four
weeks before the operations began.
Meanwhile, CBS News reported
that the next defense witness will be
McGeorge Bundy, a national security
affairs adviser to President Kennedy
and Johnson who is now president ot
the Ford Foundation.
LOS ANGELES - A Central
Intelligence Agency analyst charged
yesterday in the "Pentagon Papers"
trial that American military planners
"purposefully" underestimated Viet
Cong troop strength before, during
and after the January, 1968 Tet
offensive.
Samuel A. Adams, a key defense
witness, made the allegation as he
testified about a section of the
top-secret "Wheeler Report," a late

February, 1968 assessment of military
operations in Vietnam prepared by the
then-Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, Gen. Earle G. Wheeler.
The "Wheeler Report," which
contained a request for 206,000 more
troops later rejected by President
Johnson, estimated Viet Cong troop
strength at 240,000 men. Adams, who
spent six years studying Viet Cong
motivation, intelligence operations and
troop strength, testified that he
believed the figure to be close to
600,000 men.
In order to show reduced Viet Cong
troop strength, Adams asserted,
military intelligence officers deleted
several categories of "foemen," such as
poorly-armed irregular troops, from
their "orders of battle" (troop
strength estimates), and
underestimated Viet Cong strength in
other categories, including guerrilla
operatives.
'Political Reasons'
However, Presiding Judge Matt
Byrne Jr. blocked a series of defense
questions designed to establish
precisely why the United States
Military Assistance Command Vietnam
(MACV) chose not to recognize and
report the true Viet Cong troop
strength. Adams said he believed the
lower figure was used for "political
reasons" at the behest of Wheeler and
Gen. William C. Westmoreland.
Adams testified that the
information — which he termed
"extremely suspect" — in the
"Wheeler Report" would be "virtually
useless" to a foreign analyst in 1969,
the time period specified in the
13-count espionage, conspiracy and
theft indictment against defendants
Daniel Ellsberg and Anthony J. Russo
Jr.
He added that the report's
disclosure did not damage the national

interest. Last week, retired Navy Rear
Adm. Gene Laßocque offered similar
testimony.
Prosecution Witnesses
Earlier, several prosecution
witnesses, including one of the authors
of the "Report," testified that release
of the documents could have damaged
the national defense and may have
proved useful to foreign intelligence
analysts.
Lt. Gen. William DePuy, the first
prosecution witness, testified Jan. 18
that the study "proved useful in
planning" North Vietnam's
highly-successful April, 1972
offensive.
Said DePuy: "This might be the
best piece of information that they
[the North Vietnamese] ever had."
Report Preparation
DePuy, the Army's top planning
officer in MACV immediately prior to
the large-scale introduction of
American forces, was one of the eight
officers who assisted Wheeler in the
preparation of his report.
Adams, schooled at Harvard
University, made four trips to South
Vietnam during the late 1960's to
study American and North Vietnamese
intelligence operations. He concluded
that the North Vietnamese operation
was far superior to that of the
Americans.
A CIA employee for nine years,
Adams testified that South
Vietnamese intelligence operations
were heavily infiltrated and that Viet
Cong planners frequently had detailed
American battle plans two to four
weeks before the operations began.
Meanwhile, CBS News reported
that the next defense witness will be
McGeorge Bundy, a national security
affairs adviser to President Kennedy
