## SCOR And Tuskegee 
### 
David Martinez

Will the SCOR project become
Stanford's answer to the Tuskegee
Study? At the moment, based on
the decision of the Stanford
Administrative Sub-Panel on
Human Subjects in Research to
allow it to continue, it just might
very well be.
Because, as it stands now,
Stanford's 4.3 million dollar heart
research-behavioral change study
has the blatant potential of
disparingly causing much greater
harm than good.
As in the 1932 Tuskegee
syphilis study where Blacks were
frighteningly subjected to
inhuman, unjust treatment for the
sake of value-free research, SCOR
poses the same threats, but of a
more serious nature. Granted
SCOR isn't pressuring its subjects
into an existence based
exclusively on lies, torture, and
eventually death as Tuskegee
subjects were, but more
importantly, its dangers are of far
reaching, and thus greater nature.
Tuskegee dealt with the effect
of syphilis to 400 Blacks, while
SCOR deals with the
manipulation of 500 Chicanos in
relation to heart disease. But there
is much more to SCOR than just
playing with the minds of these
defined 500, which is bad enough
as it is. Its ramifications are
incredibly frightening.
By showing how to manipulate
these selected few, SCOR is
illustrating how to change the
behavior of the whole minority,
just as Tuskegee showed you can
kill off Blacks by not treating
them for syphilis.
Tuskegee researchers
specifically picked illiterate Blacks
as their subjects for such
deplorable but "valid" reasons as
stability, compliance, and
unquestionable acquiescence.
SCOR is drastically similar but

throws in the proximity factor of
being close to Stanford as well.
Devious
While Tuskegee researchers
maintained that they couldn't
appeal to their subjects on a
purely scientific approach,
SCOR's researchers go beyond
this by specifically referring to its
Chicano subjects as "functionally
illiterate in Spanish as well as
English."
Therefore, since neither study
could approach their subjects
scientifically, each utilized
devious and deplorable means of
enlisting their guinea pigs.
Tuskegee lured their Blacks with
free hot lunches, free medical
care, and free burial services,
while SCOR dangled their
Chicanos from lines of free
examinations and expectations of
free trips to Stanford if they were
found to be sick. Neither study
revealed that the subject would
receive only impervious scrutiny
and written findings as treatment.
The Blacks and Chicanos of
these studies are in rather similar
situations. Both are (were)
defenseless, powerless minorities
with very little control over their
own destiny. Both granted
consent to programs they didn't
completely understand, while
unknowingly jeopardizing their
only means of subsistence, namely
themselves. But the SCOR people,
and now Stanford's review board,
obviously aren't concerned with
these very real risks, these dangers
that do exist.
Concerns
What are they concerned about
then? Are the researchers selfishly
concerned more about improving
their own reputations, or
establishing a precedent? Does the
fact that all the review board that
participated in the decision are
non-tenured faculty have anything

to do with it? Or, does the matter
of Stanford receiving 46 percent
overhead from the project, about
$2 million, enter in here?
No one will answer these
assertions, but that makes no
difference. The need for those
answers has virtually slipped by
here at Stanford. One thing is for
sure, however. SCOR and
Tuskegee may be very similar, but
there is one distinguishable
difference.
Tuskegee, for all practical
purposes, was completed, but
SCOR, as it stands now, will not
be. Not a threat, not a warning,
simply a matter of fact.

inhuman, unjust treatment for the
sake of value-free research, SCOR
poses the same threats, but of a
more serious nature. Granted
SCOR isn't pressuring its subjects
into an existence based
exclusively on lies, torture, and
eventually death as Tuskegee
subjects were, but more
importantly, its dangers are of far
reaching, and thus greater nature.
Tuskegee dealt with the effect
of syphilis to 400 Blacks, while
SCOR deals with the
manipulation of 500 Chicanos in
relation to heart disease. But there
is much more to SCOR than just
playing with the minds of these
defined 500, which is bad enough
as it is. Its ramifications are
incredibly frightening.
By showing how to manipulate
these selected few, SCOR is
illustrating how to change the
behavior of the whole minority,
just as Tuskegee showed you can
kill off Blacks by not treating
them for syphilis.
Tuskegee researchers
specifically picked illiterate Blacks
as their subjects for such
deplorable but "valid" reasons as
stability, compliance, and
unquestionable acquiescence.
SCOR is drastically similar but

throws in the proximity factor of
being close to Stanford as well.
Devious
While Tuskegee researchers
maintained that they couldn't
appeal to their subjects on a
purely scientific approach,
SCOR's researchers go beyond
this by specifically referring to its
Chicano subjects as "functionally
illiterate in Spanish as well as
English."
Therefore, since neither study
could approach their subjects
scientifically, each utilized
devious and deplorable means of
enlisting their guinea pigs.
Tuskegee lured their Blacks with
free hot lunches, free medical
care, and free burial services,
while SCOR dangled their
Chicanos from lines of free
examinations and expectations of
free trips to Stanford if they were
found to be sick. Neither study
revealed that the subject would
receive only impervious scrutiny
and written findings as treatment.
The Blacks and Chicanos of
these studies are in rather similar
situations. Both are (were)
defenseless, powerless minorities
with very little control over their
own destiny. Both granted
consent to programs they didn't
completely understand, while
unknowingly jeopardizing their
only means of subsistence, namely
themselves. But the SCOR people,
and now Stanford's review board,
obviously aren't concerned with
these very real risks, these dangers
that do exist.
Concerns
What are they concerned about
then? Are the researchers selfishly
concerned more about improving
their own reputations, or
establishing a precedent? Does the
fact that all the review board that
participated in the decision are
non-tenured faculty have anything

to do with it? Or, does the matter
of Stanford receiving 46 percent
overhead from the project, about
$2 million, enter in here?
No one will answer these
assertions, but that makes no
difference. The need for those
answers has virtually slipped by
here at Stanford. One thing is for
sure, however. SCOR and
Tuskegee may be very similar, but
there is one distinguishable
difference.
Tuskegee, for all practical
purposes, was completed, but
SCOR, as it stands now, will not
be. Not a threat, not a warning,
simply a matter of fact.

Will the SCOR project become
Stanford's answer to the Tuskegee
Study? At the moment, based on
the decision of the Stanford
Administrative Sub-Panel on
Human Subjects in Research to
allow it to continue, it just might
very well be.
Because, as it stands now,
Stanford's 4.3 million dollar heart
research-behavioral change study
has the blatant potential of
disparingly causing much greater
harm than good.
