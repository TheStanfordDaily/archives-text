# Student Opinion Surveyed
## Facts On Beutelsbach 
### 
H. Rudiger Hipp

I appreciate the interest which
the author of the article "Move
Out Of Beutelsbach" (Daily,
February 22) taks in Stanford in
Germany — although he never
studied at this campus.
It is remarkable that Mr.
Shaffer's views on the best
location of the German campus
and on how "We Can Do Better"
differ not only from those which
the Stanford in Germany Faculty
expressed in their letter to the
Daily (Feburary 14), but also
from the opinion of students who
have studied, or are studying, at
the Beutelsbach campus.
In a survey which I conducted
on February 27, 1973, the
question "Should Stanford in
Germany be moved to an urban
location?" did not receive a single
affirmative answer.
Survey
There are 75 students in Group
XXX; 68 questionnaires were
returned. 53 students wrote
"No," one student was in favor of
a more rural location, seven
students were undecided, and
seven sheets showed no reply to
the question.
Mr. Shaffer writes: "How
many students really go into
Beutelsbach more than two or
three times a week?" My survey

shows that 18 students go to
Beutelsbach, Endersbach, and
other places in this area more than
three times a week. The majority
of students in Group XXX go into
Beutelsbach two or three times a
week.
I think that these students have
found the right compromise
between the requirements of the
sound academic program of this
campus (which does not have a
two-, or three-, but a four-day
academic week for every student),
and the opportunity to stay with
their German families or go to
places where they can meet
people and make friends.
Stuttgart
In addition to our very
successful family program, two of
the other meaningful contacts
with Beutelsbach are the regular
visits which a group of students
make to the Old People's Home,
and the visits to the Youth Club
whose members also pay frequent
visits to our campus, as do other
Germans.
Mr. Shaffer writes: "How
many students take advantage of
the great cultural offerings of
Stuttgart more than once a
month?" If one confronts Mr.
Shaffer's rhetorical question with
the following facts, its
sensationalist undertones should

become discernible: During the
period January 4 to February 27,
Group XXX went to Stuttgart on
a city tour which included a
reception at the town hall, to a
concert in Stuttgart, and to a
ballet performance.
Furthermore, 30 students went
to an optional concert in
Stuttgart, and 35 to an opera
performance. One scheduled
optional concert attendance and
an evening in Esslingen with
students of the Teachers Training
College has to be cancelled for
medical reasons. In addition to
these organized visits, the students
of Group XXX went to Stuttgart
on their own initiative an average
of five times during the period
January 4 to February 27. During
the same period, optional bus
trips to places of interest in
Swabia were also organized.
Cruising
Mr. Shaffer writes: "How
many students spend their
weekends in Beutelsbach instead
of cruising off to Italy or
Holland?" The answer is as
follows: On the average, the
students of Group XXX spent
three weekends on the "Burg"
and in the Beutelsbach area so far.
The favorite destinations for
weekend travel were within
Germany — Munich, Nuremberg,
Heidelberg, Rothenburg,
Ludwigsburg, Schwabisch Hall,
Hohenzollern castle, and the
Black Forest. I know that this
picture will change eventually, but
it is simply not fair to insinuate
that students are just "cruising off
to Italy or Holland."
Mr. Shaffer suggests that a
campus in Munich could
conceivably maintain a
relationship with the town of
Beutelsbach or with other rural
communities scattered over
southern Germany. It is quite
unrealistic to assume that a
meaningful relationship could be
maintained with Beutelsbach from
Munich.
Moving to a large city would
indeed mean abandoning the kind
of family program which we have
at Stanford in Germany, and it
would mean forfeiting the great
kindness, understanding, and
good-will with which people of
Beutelsbach and of this area have
met Stanford students over the
past fifteen years. The best we
could achieve in an urban location
would still be ersatz.
It is no secret that students
interested in going to a campus in
a German-speaking country had
the choice between an urban
location (Vienna) and a non-urban
location (Beutelsbach). Need I say
more?
