# University Food: Can't Live With It—Or Without It
## 
### BOB SIEGEL (First of Two Parts) 
"Not only is the taste of the food going downhill, but
the quality is bad. A few days ago, three of us had green
roast beef, inedible overcooked vegetables, and wilted
salad."
"I really can't believe how good the food is on the
Row!"
The Food Service is an institution which campus
residents often can't seem to live with — or without. It has
the thankless task of feeding 3000 mouths three times a
day in as pleasurable a manner as possible.
It is a large scale operation by anyone's definition and
falls under the general direction of the Business Office.
E.A. Scoles, director of Housing and Food Services, is
responsible for the overall management of the system and
serves as liaison to the President's Office.
The Food Service Department actually involves the
coordination of two branches: the Commissary and Food
Service. According to Scoles, "each has its own budget
and each is supposed to break even."
The commissary, managed by Sterling Silver, provides
all types of food (except dairy products) for the Food
Service, fraternities, eating clubs, the hospital, Tresidder,
and the faculty club. Though only the Food Service is
obligated to buy from the commissary, Silver currently
lists 45 accounts around campus.
Non-Profit Agent
The commissary serves as a non-profit cooperative
buying agent for many smaller purchasing units. Its
customers save money through economies of scale and
pay for their food at cost plus a 10 percent handling
charge.
Silver currently manages a $2,000,000 budget and
must administer the handling of some 120,000 cases of

groceries and 1.5 million pounds of meat, fish, and
poultry per year.
He employs four butchers who can "trim meat better
and at lower cost than contracted private butchers." Dairy
products are not handled because they sell at a fixed
price.
Used For Convenience
Fraternities and eating clubs use the commissary as
much for its convenience as for the money it saves. Gregg
Yamanaka, food manager at El Cuadro eating club says,
"It is most convenient to go to the commissary because of
the delivery schedule (three times a week) and easy
access."
According to Dave Blakely, house manager at Alpha
Sigma Phi, "The commissary is convenient and easy to
deal with."
Both felt that while Commissary meat was of good
quality, better cuts could be obtained in grocery stores —
although usually at higher prices.
Begun In 1946
The Stanford Commissary began operating in 1946
from an abandoned U.S. Army Hospital in Menlo Park on
land now occupied by Stanford Research Institute. It
moved to its present $1,000,000 home on Pampas Lane
about three years ago.
Maxine Anderson manages the food service and its
$2,250,000 budget. She holds a B.S. in foods and
management, and institution management. The individual
dorm managers have similar training.
"Service managers report to me, but can do almost
anything they want to; if it involves spending money, they
must have approval," says Anderson. "Approval is
generally given." For example, Branner Hall (with
Anderson's approval) used students to help in preparing a
special Mexican dinner last Tuesday.

YE OLDE BUTCHER SHOP — All the meat products used in the University Food Service are cut and prepared in the
butcher shop pictured above. The butcher shop has been one of the central arenas in which war has been waged against
rising meat costs.
