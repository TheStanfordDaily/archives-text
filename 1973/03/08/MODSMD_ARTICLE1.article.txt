# University Food: Can't Live With It—Or Without It
## 
### BOB SIEGEL (First of Two Parts) 
"Not only is the taste of the food going downhill, but
the quality is bad. A few days ago, three of us had green
roast beef, inedible overcooked vegetables, and wilted
salad."
"I really can't believe how good the food is on the
Row!"
The Food Service is an institution which campus
residents often can't seem to live with — or without. It has
the thankless task of feeding 3000 mouths three times a
day in as pleasurable a manner as possible.
It is a large scale operation by anyone's definition and
falls under the general direction of the Business Office.
E.A. Scoles, director of Housing and Food Services, is
responsible for the overall management of the system and
serves as liaison to the President's Office.
The Food Service Department actually involves the
coordination of two branches: the Commissary and Food
Service. According to Scoles, "each has its own budget
and each is supposed to break even."
The commissary, managed by Sterling Silver, provides
all types of food (except dairy products) for the Food
Service, fraternities, eating clubs, the hospital, Tresidder,
and the faculty club. Though only the Food Service is
obligated to buy from the commissary, Silver currently
lists 45 accounts around campus.
Non-Profit Agent
The commissary serves as a non-profit cooperative
buying agent for many smaller purchasing units. Its
customers save money through economies of scale and
pay for their food at cost plus a 10 percent handling
charge.
Silver currently manages a $2,000,000 budget and
must administer the handling of some 120,000 cases of

groceries and 1.5 million pounds of meat, fish, and
poultry per year.
He employs four butchers who can "trim meat better
and at lower cost than contracted private butchers." Dairy
products are not handled because they sell at a fixed
price.
Used For Convenience
Fraternities and eating clubs use the commissary as
much for its convenience as for the money it saves. Gregg
Yamanaka, food manager at El Cuadro eating club says,
"It is most convenient to go to the commissary because of
the delivery schedule (three times a week) and easy
access."
According to Dave Blakely, house manager at Alpha
Sigma Phi, "The commissary is convenient and easy to
deal with."
Both felt that while Commissary meat was of good
quality, better cuts could be obtained in grocery stores —
although usually at higher prices.
Begun In 1946
The Stanford Commissary began operating in 1946
from an abandoned U.S. Army Hospital in Menlo Park on
land now occupied by Stanford Research Institute. It
moved to its present $1,000,000 home on Pampas Lane
about three years ago.
Maxine Anderson manages the food service and its
$2,250,000 budget. She holds a B.S. in foods and
management, and institution management. The individual
dorm managers have similar training.
"Service managers report to me, but can do almost
anything they want to; if it involves spending money, they
must have approval," says Anderson. "Approval is
generally given." For example, Branner Hall (with
Anderson's approval) used students to help in preparing a
special Mexican dinner last Tuesday.

YE OLDE BUTCHER SHOP — All the meat products used in the University Food Service are cut and prepared in the
butcher shop pictured above. The butcher shop has been one of the central arenas in which war has been waged against
rising meat costs.
Although the menu is the same throughout the system
except on the Row, Ruth Skinner, food manager at
Florence Moore, reports that individual directors do have
flexibility to do "most little things on our own."
Recent Innovations
Innovations which have been instituted over the past
few years include orange juice machines, open meal
transfers, meal exchange with fraternities, a test kitchen
and taste panel, and unlimited servings.
In addition, attempts are being made to serve cultural
foods in theme houses. Anderson explained that at least
one soul food item is served every day at Roble "to give
them something they are used to."
Tortillas can be found every day at Stern Hall for
Chicano students from Casa Zapata, and rice is provided
for Asian students in Junipero. The Director adds that
"we haven't had any requests" from Native Americans.
Budget Division
The food service budget is divided among three major
areas: food (44 percent), labor (32 percent), and a
catch-all category which includes insurance, fire
protection, debt service, utilities and maintenance (24
percent).
In the last six years, the wage of individual kitchen
workers has increased substantially. The food service has
held the total labor outlay constant during this period
through consolidation and some service cutbacks.
For example, all baking for the food service is now
done in Wilbur Hall, where several years ago each
residence had its own bakery. Service in Branner and
Roble has been cut from seven days down to five, and
food for these dorms is now prepared in Wilbur's kitchen.
"Right now, it would be hard to cut back further,"
says Anderson. "No other cuts are now being
anticipated." She added, "Cutting back on labor would
mean cutting back on service. We don't want to do that
now."
Task Force
Meal ticket rates are based upon recommendations of
the Room and Board Task Force from the previous school
year. The task force is assembled almost every year as an

advisory group to the deputy vice president for Business
and Finance and the Dean of Students. It consists of six
University administrators and six students. Approval of its
recommendations must come from the President and the
Board of Trustees.
Last winter, the task force conducted a survey in the
dining rooms asking students to make a choice between
holding meal ticket increases to a minimum "by cutting
programs and services" or absorbing higher rate increases
to maintain or even expand current programs.
Students overwhelmingly gave the task force "a
mandate to keep costs down," said a task force report.
Food Prices
The 3.9 percent increase in room and board rates
which was introduced this academic year reflects rapidly
rising food prices. For the month of January food prices
were up 4.1 percent. Meat, poultry, and fish prices have
risen 13.9 percent since January, 1972. Silver observes
that carcass beef is up 25 percent over September prices.
Stanford students now pay $3.36/day for the basic
19-meal, seven-day meal ticket. Comparing this rate to
those found at other universities is risky because of
inconsistent accounting procedures, numbers of students,
local food prices, and services provided.
The San Jose State food service, for example, operates
only one large dining room and charges $2.75 per day. By
contrast, Mills College students eat sit-down dinners in
their own dorms and pay $4.40 per day.
Recently, many students have been asking about a
five-day meal plan. At present, only Row houses offer this
option, while people living in other dorms must choose
between two seven-day plans.
Anderson explains that expanding the five-day plan on
a University-wide basis "would make operations much
more expensive."
She continues, "People on the Row pay for the
five-day meal option. Currently the five-day, 10 meal plan
offered to the Row costs $3.77 per day while the
corresponding seven-day, 14-meal ticket costs $3.13 per
day. The five-day plan would have to be much higher if
the option were offered to all dorm residents."
