# Fauna Non Grata
## Dogs And Metaphysics 
### 
David Trollman

That you may understand my predilections, I am
a member of the "smug, irresponsible minority" of
Stanford students who are also dog owners. It is not
my purpose, however, to be vindictive or
self-righteous, as I feel that these qualities have little
bearing on the problem of dogs at Stanford but
serve only to obfuscate the issue.
Dogs, like pigeons on Pennsylvania Avenue, are
anachronistic and of no utility. They represent a
threat to a perfect world.
Primary objections include their unappetizing
presence at Tresidder, the alimentary evidence of
that presence on lawn and walkway, their disruptive
behavior in classrooms, the physical threat they
pose to the unwary bicyclist, and, for some, it
would seem, the bare fact of their existence.
Metaphysics
Arguments in favor of some canine presence at
Stanford inevitably drift off into the metaphysical
precisely because there exists no more rational
argument in their favor. Perhaps the kindest thing
that may be said about dogs is that they are a
diversion and that their very existence bespeaks a
reassuring tolerance of the irrational. In this view
the absence of canine utility becomes a virtue which
overshadows the above-mentioned objections.
The problem of dogs at Stanford stems directly
from its inconsequence in the past, so that although
free-running dogs were illegal de jure they were
permissible de facto. The problem has been
exacerbated of late by a rising crescendo of
ill-considered innuendo and asinine allegation, the
only function of which has been an acceleration of
the dialectic.
Given the caninophilic thesis and the
caninophobic antithesis (or is it the other way
around?), I suggest that a synthesis must be found
which would alleviate the righteous indignation of
both campus. I further suggest that such a solution
might consist of the following two points:

(1) Dogs should be declared fauna non grata in
and around Tresidder. This might be enforced by
the pound and even by the Stanford Police
Department, should it find no other way of
justifying its existence.
This policy is already in effect and might be
further reinforced by peer pressure on dog owners
and on all who encourage said fauna by feeding
them, which act is in fact responsible for their
presence.
(2) Dogs should be forbidden entry to all
buildings. This poli»y might be enforced by the
powers that be,-init the simplest solution would be
to a|)ply peer {fressyre on the owners who permit
the* pjtt£ sucJi .license and especially on their fellow
stuaentia who allow or 'invKje these animals to enter
the buildings.
Referendum
Such a solution would appear to benefit from the
wisdom of both groups while totally alienating
neither. Dogs would not be in evidence at Tresidder,
nor would they disrupt the educational process. The
price of their presence on campus would then be
some increased risk to the bicyclist (a point which
surely might be mooted) and some dog shit in those
areas of Stanford away from Tresidder and other
university buildings. This price would be reduced
further by the number of pets kept home by owners
discouraged by the two above-mentioned measures.
Other, more stringent measures, I think, should
be submitted to a referendum to determine the
actual support enjoyed by each camp. I am frankly
confident that the majority of those concerned
would prefer an environment with dogs to one
without, an avowedly imperfect world with some
diversion to a world striving for hygienic perfection
at the expense of something perhaps more valuable.
