Finally, A Solution
Editor:
The latest campaign launched
against the canine corps here at
Stanford is laced with good
intentions. No one can refute the
health hazard the dogs pose. And
I can think of but a few people
who would not object to having
their flesh pierced by a pair of
chomping jowls. Personally, I have
had to spontaneously navigate my
bike around or through a pack of
pedigrees to avoid an accident.
But I do not think that chaining
or impounding the total
population of dogs is the best
answer to the alleged problem.
What I propose is to organize a
corps of canine cops which will
handle complaints of individuals
who have suffered cruel and
inhuman treatment at the paws of
the dogs. If an individual is bitten
by a dog, has his personal health
indangered, or is forced into a
vehicular accident he could file a
complaint against the alleged
guilty animal. He should have his
accusation backed up by witnesses
so the canine cops can track down
the dog and impound it pending a
hearing.
If the dog is found guilty its
owner would have to pay the ten
dollar fine. If not, it should go
free. Also, if a person is found to
have aided and abetted a dog in
committing a crime, such as
feeding it from his Tresidder plate

or scaring the shit out of it, he too
should be fined the ten dollars.
Justice should not cease to
exist on levels other than the
human. Man's best friend has an
equal right to life, liberty, and the
pursuit of happiness.

Editor:
I was interested in the remarks
of Ralph Davidson, President of
the Alumni Association (Daily,
Feb. 28), in which he criticizes
the New Founders League of
Stanford, saying, "They are using
the art of the half truth and the
quote taken out of context to
make things on campus appear
much worse than they are." Such
a comment referring to half truths
and quotes out of context coming
from Mr. Davidson, himself the
publisher of Time Magazine,
makes me chuckle.
I have read the bulletin of the
New Founders League, and if
their pictures of broken windows
in the Lou Henry Hoover building
and the rock concerts inside
Memorial Church, including
students lounging on the altar, are
half truths, then please have Mr.
Davidson explain them to me.
