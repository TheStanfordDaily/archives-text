# Makarova Stars In ABT's 'Giselle'
## 
### RUST EDDIE 
Natalia Makarova, one-time pride of the
Kirov, now the toast of American Ballet
Theater, danced the title role in "Giselle"
Sunday night in one of her three San
Francisco performances this week at the
Opera House. Possessing this Giselle's ballet
slippers may be everyone's dream who has
ever witnessed Makarova's rendition of the
role considered to be the touchstone of the
ballerina's art.
Written for Carlotta Grisi by Theophile
Gautier and premiered at the Paris Opera in
1841, "Giselle" has survived by combining the
two principal facets of the romantic ballet,
through the colorful peasant scenes of the
first act and the unearthly, haunting
atmosphere of the second.
An indispensable feature of the repertoire
of almost every ballet company, certainly of
A.8.T., "Giselle's" original choreography,
wholly maintained by Ballet Theater, was by
Jean Coralli, though the role of Giselle is said

to have been staged by Grisi's husband,
Perrot.
Position Reversed
Considered throughout the years entirely
as Giselle's ballet (it was her love affair, her
betrayal, her madness, her suicide), A.B.T.
unconsciously reversed this position for two
decades by casting the world's formost
"danseur Noble," Erik Bruhn, as Count
Albrecht until Bruhn's retirement last year.
Currently tapping talent into
choreography, as could be seen over the past
three weeks in "La Sylphide" and "Swan
Lake" which Nureyev and Canada brought to
the Bay Area, Bruhn's earlier Count forfeited
the crown to Giselle with the close of Bruhn's
dance career.
Bruhn's retirement likewise ended all
dispute over who was, indeed, first dancer of
the company, and Makarova now rules
A.B.T.'s stable uncontestedly. Thirty-three
year old Makarova received her training in
Leningrad's Vagonova Ballet School where she

was nicknamed "The Giraffe" because of her
very long limbs and angular neck.
'Giselle' Solo
In 1959 she followed other Vaganova
finalists — Pavlova, Nijinsky, Ulanova — with a
solo from "Giselle" at the Korov. Joining and
remaining with the Kirov until her London
defection in 1970, she signed a contract later
that year to appear as a principal dancer with
A.B.T.
Partnered Sunday with Hungarian Ivan
Nagy, the duo provided a textbook
illustration on the fallacy of human
synergism. Vying tirelessly to overtake
Makarova's lead, Nagy's performance, though
subtracting nothing from the two act ballet,
added little to it either.
Makarova will make two more San
Francisco appearances in "Coppelia" on
Thursday, March 8, and "Swan Lake" on
Sunday evening, March 11. American Ballet
Theater will be performing in San Francisco
through Sunday, March 11.
