Two 11JS. Diplomats Buried
WASHINGTON — The two American diplomats slain in
Sudan by Arab terrorists were buried in adjacent graves
Wednesday on a rain-drenched slope of Arlington National
Cemetery.
There was no sermon, no eulogies and little pomp —
save for the solemn watch of an all-military honor guard —
as the two flag-draped coffins lay beneath a sweeping,
modernistic altar. True to the wishes of the survivors, the
state funeral included only music, prayer and a reading of
the scriptures.
The two widows, their children and other close
relatives were joined by Secretary of State William P.
Rogers, who led a large contingent of diplomatic officials.
Among them was Public Works Minister Abdal-Rahman
Abdulla of the Sudan.
The assassinations led President Jaffar el Numairi to
crack down on Palestinian guerrillas operating in Sudan,
and several Sudanese suspected collaborators were
arrested yesterday.
The government-controlled newspaper A 1 Sahafa
reported that five Sudanese men already have been
arrested on charges of conspiring with the Palestinian
guerrilla organization A 1 Fatah against the security and
sovereignty of Sudan. A sixth is being hunted, the paper
added.
Numairi said the assault — in which U.S. Ambassador
Cleo A. Noel Jr., U.S. Charge d'Affaires G. Curtis Moore
and Belgian envoy Guy Eid were killed — was part of "an
effort to destroy Sudan."
A prominent Khartoum lawyer said, however, that
although the death penalty remains in force in Sudan he
doubted the killers will be executed.
56 More POWs Return
CLARK AIR BASE, Philippines — Fifty-six released
prisoners of war were sent home to the United States
today by well-wishers who hugged, kissed and garlanded
them with flowers.
The men left on three giant Cl4l hospital planes. The
first took off with 19 men for Andrews Air Force Base,
Washington, D.C., via Hickam Air Force Base, Hawaii.
Eighteen others left aboard the second flight two hours
later for Kelly Air Force Base, Tex., and Scott Air Force
Base, 111. Nineteen were on the third plane for Travis Air
Force Base, Calif.
The 56 were all the freed prisoners who remained at
Clark, the initial processing center for returning POWs.
With the last of the most recent group of freed
prisoners winging homeward, Clark's base hospital awaited
arrival of the next contingent. Hanoi has not yet specified
a release date.
Meanwhile at Travis Air Force Base, 20 more liberated
American prisoners of war landed in California yesterday
— some of them stepping into embraces with loved ones
who waited years for them to come back.

Lindsay Won't Run Again
NEW YORK — Mayor John V. Lindsay said yesterday he
definitely will not seek a third four-year term as mayor of
the nation's biggest city. He cited "personal
considerations" for his decision.
"I believe that I could win a third term," Lindsay, 51,
told a City Hall news conference. "My love for this city
and the work still to be done have tempted me to carry
on."
With that, Lindsay's political career came to at least a
temporary halt. Although he has been reported eyeing
next year's gubernatorial or senatorial race, he said he had
"no plan at all beyond this term."
IRA Guerrillas Raid Irish Poll
BELFAST — Ulster Defense Regiment security forces
threw armed cordons around polling booths for today's
referendum in Northern Ireland, but at one a truckload of
Irish Republican Army (IRA) guerrillas swooped down on
a group of guards and made away with their weapons.
A dozen IRA men attacked yesterday on Shankill
Road, a Protestant district, scoring a bloodless victory
over members of the Ulster Defense Regiment.
The referendum is to decide whether Northern Ireland
should remain tied to Britain or link up with the Irish
Republic. Over one million electors, all citizens over 18,
will answer two questions:
"Do you want Northern Ireland to remain part of the
United Kingdom?"
"Do you want Northern Ireland to be joined with the
Republic of Ireland outside the United Kingdom?"
This is the first time the "British or Irish" question has
been put in a referendum.
Russo Angers Tapers 9 Judge
LOS ANGELES — Defendant Anthony Russo angered
U.S. District Court Judge Matt Byrne in the Pentagon
Papers trial yesterday by scrawling on a chart that was
being used in evidence and was warned such conduct
might be punished in the future.
After a court recess, the prosecutor noticed someone
had scrawled at the bottom of the list, tfThe People."
By me inquired about it and Russo stood up and declared,
"I did it. I wasn't trying to be humorous."
The prosecutor had been using a chart in connection
with cross examination of a Central Intelligence Agency
analyst on which he showed the types of persons who
made up the North Vietnamese Army — using such
classifications as regulars and guerrillas.
