# Attorneys Argue Bach Mai Vote; Judge To Decide Issue Monday
## 
### ROBERT BACON 
SAN JOSE — Superior Court Judge
Richard W. Rhodes yesterday heard
arguments on the controversial Palo
Alto Bach Mai Hospital initiative, and
promised a ruling on Monday.
He will decide whether the May 8
municipal election ballot will include
the question of giving $50,000 in city
funds to help rebuild the bombed
Bach Mai Hospital in Hanoi, North
Vietnam.
Petitioners representing a coalition
of peace groups asked Rhodes to force
an election on the question.
On Feb. 26, the city council voted
6-3 to keep the measure off the ballot,
despite the fact that enough signatures
had been collected on initiative

petitions to theoretically require an
election.
Waste of Funds
They made the decision on the
basis of an opinion by City Attorney
Peter Stone that for several reasons the
proposed donation was illegal, and
that holding an election on it would
therefore be a waste of tax funds.
Stone's senior assistant, Robert K.
Booth, yesterday urged Rhodes to
deny the petitioners' request.
He said that an appropriation of
public money could only be made by
the city council, not by an initiative.
The city charter, he said, permits
appropriations only by two-thirds vote
of the council.
Vague Entity
Furthermore, Booth said, "the Palo
Alto City Council can't give money to
the American Cancer Society or the
Girl Scouts, much less to a vaguely
described entity for aid to a foreign
country with which the United States
does not have diplomatic relations."
The law requires that city tax funds
be used only for "municipal affairs,"
according to a 38-page brief which
Booth submitted on Tuesday
afternoon. A gift to Bach Mai Hospital
"is clearly not a municipal affair," he
told the court.
Making such a donation would
inject the city government into foreign
affairs, which are properly the realm
of the federal government," he said.
The brief described the proposed
initiative as "vague, uncertain and
ambiguous... a raid on the city
treasury." It concluded that "the legal
infirmities of this measure are utterly
overwhelming."
Validity
Speaking for the proponents of the
measure, attorney Robert Charrow
asked that Rhodes not decide whether
or not the initiative would be valid if
passed.
"We are asking the court to
reaffirm the sanctity of the initiative,"
he began. "The question is whether
the court will examine the
constitutionality of the initiative. We
think it should not, due to the limited
time and the complex issues which are
involved."
The case must be decided by Mar.
16, when printers will begin to prepare
ballots for the election.
Charrow urged that the measure be
put on the ballot, and that its validity
be considered in court only if it is
approved by the voters. He said the

city charter gives the council no
discretion, but requires them to put all
initiatives before the voters.
Continuing the argument,
third-year Stanford law student Tom
Burke said that "The state
constitution gives a municipality broad

powers" and that a city has great
discretion to decide what is a
"municipal affair."
Attorneys for both sides hinted
that if Rhodes rules against them on
Monday, they will seek reversal from
the California Supreme Court.

Alto Bach Mai Hospital initiative, and
promised a ruling on Monday.
He will decide whether the May 8
municipal election ballot will include
the question of giving $50,000 in city
funds to help rebuild the bombed
Bach Mai Hospital in Hanoi, North
Vietnam.
Petitioners representing a coalition
of peace groups asked Rhodes to force
an election on the question.
On Feb. 26, the city council voted
6-3 to keep the measure off the ballot,
despite the fact that enough signatures
had been collected on initiative

petitions to theoretically require an
election.
Waste of Funds
They made the decision on the
basis of an opinion by City Attorney
Peter Stone that for several reasons the
proposed donation was illegal, and
that holding an election on it would
therefore be a waste of tax funds.
Stone's senior assistant, Robert K.
Booth, yesterday urged Rhodes to
deny the petitioners' request.
He said that an appropriation of
public money could only be made by
the city council, not by an initiative.
The city charter, he said, permits
appropriations only by two-thirds vote
of the council.
Vague Entity
Furthermore, Booth said, "the Palo
Alto City Council can't give money to
the American Cancer Society or the
Girl Scouts, much less to a vaguely
described entity for aid to a foreign
country with which the United States
does not have diplomatic relations."
The law requires that city tax funds
be used only for "municipal affairs,"
according to a 38-page brief which
Booth submitted on Tuesday
afternoon. A gift to Bach Mai Hospital
"is clearly not a municipal affair," he
told the court.
Making such a donation would
inject the city government into foreign
affairs, which are properly the realm
of the federal government," he said.
The brief described the proposed
initiative as "vague, uncertain and
ambiguous... a raid on the city
treasury." It concluded that "the legal
infirmities of this measure are utterly
overwhelming."
Validity
Speaking for the proponents of the
measure, attorney Robert Charrow
asked that Rhodes not decide whether
or not the initiative would be valid if
passed.
"We are asking the court to
reaffirm the sanctity of the initiative,"
he began. "The question is whether
the court will examine the
constitutionality of the initiative. We
think it should not, due to the limited
time and the complex issues which are
involved."
The case must be decided by Mar.
16, when printers will begin to prepare
ballots for the election.
Charrow urged that the measure be
put on the ballot, and that its validity
be considered in court only if it is
approved by the voters. He said the

city charter gives the council no
discretion, but requires them to put all
initiatives before the voters.
Continuing the argument,
third-year Stanford law student Tom
Burke said that "The state
constitution gives a municipality broad

powers" and that a city has great
discretion to decide what is a
"municipal affair."
Attorneys for both sides hinted
that if Rhodes rules against them on
Monday, they will seek reversal from
the California Supreme Court.
