# Religious Groups Gain Influence
## 
### BRUCE KADDEN 
"First protests, then drugs, now
religion. I knew it would end this way;
I just knew it," said one student in
Approaching Stanford '72.
Religion has taken on an
increasingly important role for many
students during the past few years.
And it is no surprise that there is a
wide variety of religious groups
represented here.
The first thing that comes to mind
when discussing religion is Memorial
Church, the spacious chapel located at
the heart of the Inner Quad.
Three Sunday services are held
there: a 9 a.m. communion service in
the Round Room, an 11 a.m. public
worship service, and a 5 p.m. Roman
Catholic mass.
Interdenominational
Diane Kenney, Assistant Dean of
the Chapel, described the worship
service as "interdenominational .. .
and relatively traditional with the
organ, choir, and all."
The 5 p.m. mass is sponsored by St.

Ann's Chapel of Palo Alto, which also
holds a noon mass every Wednesday in
Mem Chu. That same evening at 9:30 a
special Candlelight service, with
singing and discussion is held.
Besides Kenney, the people who
oversee the programs in Mem Chu are
Dean of the Chapel Robert McAfee
Brown, and Andrew Kille, a seminary
intern. Mem Chu was a co-sponsor of
the Glide Celebration held on campus
earlier this quarter.
Hillel Foundation
The Mem Chu services are only a
small part of the religious activities on
campus. The Hillel Foundation is the
center of activity for the Jewish
community at Stanford. Rabbi Charles
Familant said he sees the purpose of
Hillel as "to deepen the knowledge of
Jewish culture."
Hillel provides many different ways
for students to get together.
Traditional services are held every
Friday at 8 p.m. and Saturday at 9
a.m. Louis Steinberg, a student
involved with Hillel, said, "The people

who come to the services do most of
the conducting. We try to create a
type of community spirit."
Students get together each
Wednesday for a home cooked lunch
and also have a lox and bagel brunch
every other Sunday at the
International Center Patio, through
Hillel.
Purim Party
The group has sponsored special
Saturday night events twice a month.
These have included an Israeli Coffee
House and the film "Never Again."
March 17 will be a Purim Party to
celebrate the Jewish holiday which
commemorates the Jews being saved
from oppression, as described in the
Book of Esther.
Speakers, movies, undergraduate
specials and other courses related to
Jewish interests are also sponsored by
Hillel, which is supported by B'nai
B'rith an international Jewish
organization.
Marc Kay, a student involved with
Hillel, described the campus group as
an organization in transition. "We have
to locate students needs, and program
for them," he said.
One of the coming events
sponsored by Hillel is a weekend
retreat in Berkeley with Hillel groups
from San Francisco State University,
UC Santa Cruz, and UC Berkeley.
Hillel is also planning a community
seder (special dinner and service) for
Passover, which commemorates the
Exodus from Egypt of the Jewish
people following their enslavement.
Seminar '70
Every Sunday morning a group of
about 250 people gathers in the
geology corner of the Quad for
Seminar '70. The purpose, according
to Steve Zeisler, campus minister with
the Peninsula Bible Church, is "to
provide bible teaching and fellowship"
to members of the community."
Each session consists of about 45
minutes of singing, praying, and
sharing, and 45 minutes of Bible
study, Zeisler said.
He added that their program does
not conflict with the Mem Chu
services. "Seminar '70 provides more
of a biblical orientation ... it
complements what goes on in the
Chapel."
Campus Crusade For Christ
Campus Crusade for Christ (C.C.C.)
is one of the more evangelical groups
on campus. C.C.C. has four college
graduates who act as full-time staff.
They are sponsored by hometown
churches, friends, and Christian
businessmen from all over the nation,
and are sent here as a type of
missionary, according to one student.
The staff teaches classes in
leadership training and bible training,
and is currently involved in a religious
survey of the freshman class. The
leadership training class teaches people
how to lead a complete life and how
to help others gain a complete life.
The survey requests that students
discuss their religious background and
their understanding of Christianity.
Related to Seminar and C.C.C. is
the Stanford Christian Fellowship
(S.C.F.), a student-run group, which
combines the efforts of several smaller
organizations on campus, and puts
together large scale events.

Peter Payne, a student here, said
that there is no set structure for
S.C.F., but a six student committee is
responsible for planning events.
Recently, S.C.F., in conjunction
with Seminar '70, held a weekend
retreat at Mt. Herman, which included
speakers, discussions, and time for
people to meet each other.
There are many other religious
groups on campus. Representatives of

the Lutheran, Baptist, and Catholic
faithes have offices in the Clubhouse,
and serve the community in the same
way all religious leaders do.
One unusual type of religion, is
Transcendental Meditation as taught
by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. It is billed
as "an easily learned natural technique
for the development and expansion of
happiness, intelligence, and creativity,
while gaining deep physical rest."
