# Situation Critical In Wounded Knee

WOUNDED KNEE, S.D. (AP) - The
U.S. government broke off talks
yesterday with the Indians holding
Wounded Knee and asked that women
and children be evacuated from the
historic village because "the situation
has become extremely grave."
Ralph Erickson, senior Justice
Department official at the Pine Ridge
Reservation, said the position taken by
leaders of the American Indian
Movement (AIM) "amounts to nothing
more than intolerable blackmail."
Federal officials said the Indians
fired 250 rounds at marshals and FBI
agents before dawn yesterday and that
federal agents returned approximately
the same amount of fire. There were
no injuries reported.
The exchange was the most intense
between the 200 Indians who invaded
the hamlet eight days ago and the
circle of federal lawmen surrounding
Wounded Knee. At the Indian
encampment, AIM leaders called a
meeting to discuss the government's
announcement that talks were being
broken off.
"Negotiations cannot be made at a
gunpoint," Erickson said. He added
that two federal negotiators had rifles
aimed at their cars en route to
discussions.
"I cannot escape the feeling that
the leaders are bent on one of two
courses â€” total capitulation by the
U.S. government to their illegal
demands, or violence.
"It is no exaggeration to say the
situation has become extremely

grave," he said. "If the leaders are bent
on violence, that is their concern, but I
call upon them to send the women and
children out of Wounded Knee before
darkness falls Thursday."
Dennis Banks, an AIM leader, said
it will be up to the women in the
village to decide whether they will
remain past the deadline today. "The
women who came in with us said they
would lay down their lives for this
cause. If they decide to stay, we'll
accept it."
Other Indian leaders said the
government's reaction was what they
had expected. However, Clyde
Bellecourt, an AIM leader from
Minneapolis, said, "I'm not worried
about it. I think the negotiations will
reopen soon. We've got too much
national support for the government
to risk another massacre."
Negotiations ended early yesterday
after the Indians rejected the
government's last peace proposal by
insisting on three demands which
neither the Justice nor Interior
departments would concede.
The Indians want the highest
Interior official responsible for Indian
affairs to meet with them in Wounded
Knee. The second demand is that the
Oglala Sioux Tribal Council be
suspended, tribal President Richard
Wilson dismissed and new elections
held.
The final demand is that three
Indians arrested Tuesday be released
and returned to Wounded Knee.
Federal marshals said they found four
gasoline fire bombs in the Indians' car.
