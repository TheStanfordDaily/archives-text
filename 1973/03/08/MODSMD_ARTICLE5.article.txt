# University Employees Blast SLAC Layoffs
## 
### PETER ALESHIRE 
United Stanford Employees (USE)
attacked Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center (SLAC) management lay-off
notices to 80 employees — including
former USE president Jim Berk — for
"grudge settling" and "gross violations
of any concept of seniority within
skills categories."
The lay-offs come in the wake of a
$750,000 cutback in federal funds to
SLAC this year.
University policy outlines three
criteria to be taken into consideration
before laying-off an employee — past
performance, length of service with
the University, and ability to do the
remaining work.
USE spokesman, Jack B. Truher
said that management was using an
improper definition of seniority.
Seniority
SLAC employees work in groups of
from five to 40 on specific projects.
USE says that employees are being laid
off according to their seniority in
these groups rather than according to
their skills categories.
Truher said this leads to
"absurdities," and has resulted in
people with many years of service at
Stanford being laid off. He said
employees that had recently been
promoted to new work groups were
the first to be laid off.
Truher said employees with the
least seniority in a given skills category
should be the first to be laid off and
the vacencies in their work groups
could be filled by interdepartmental
transfers. This seniority should be one
of the factors considered, he said.
'Nail Activists'
USE also charges that management
took advantage of the lay-offs to "nail
certain activists whose attitudes about
labor matters did not coincide with

the management.
"The most transparent case is the
layoff notice sent to Jim Berk,
long-time labor organizer and a
founder and past-president of USE,"
the USE statement said.
Truher said that there are 41
electronic engineers at SLAC, and that
Berk was one of the top four in
seniority. Berk has 12 years of service
at Stanford and was instrumental in
thd development of a solid-state logic
system critical to the Accelerator
Center's Operation, the USE statement
said.
Politics
The assistant director of SLAC,
Douglas Dupen, emphatically denied
that Berk's politics had anything to do
with his being laid off.
Dupen also defended management
decisions on seniority. He said that
quotas were given to each work group.
This was the only way to handle the
organizational problems of the layoff,
he noted. University policy stipulates
that a job vacancy cannot be filled by
transferring a person in the
department, but must be posted as
vacant and be open to competition
within the University, Dupen said.
Dupen added that if a large number
of employees were laid off in a given
work group because they were low on
the over-all seniority poll, that work
group would be understaffed, and
there would be no way to make sure
that more senior members of
overstaffed groups would transfer to
fill the vacancies.
Truher said that Berk and several
others were going to ask for grievance
hearings. He said they had no way to
prove that Berk had been laid off for
political reasons, but that they would
base their case on Berk's competence
and seniority.
