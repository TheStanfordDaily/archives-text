# Things Are Changing
## Stanford 'Community' 
### 
Jim Talcott

There was a time when I liked
the idea of referring to the people
who spend their days at Stanford
a community.
True, it could easily seem
absurd lumping together the staff,
students, and faculty, with all
their differences, socially,
economically, and
philosophically. If there is any
fairly pervasive ideological
framework here, especially among
those with the most influence, it
is one of independence and
individuality rather than of
collectivism and community.
People come and go at a furious
pace, students scheduled to turn
over 100 percent every four years,
others at a less carefully
premeditated, but almost equal
rate.
Yet, with all that seemingly
testifying against the word's
appropriateness, I was attracted to
trying to use it. For if it were
true, then one could find in
Stanford a stable substance which
could be chiseled by its
constituents into a boldly
humanistic shape, and hold its
shape when the chisel was
temporarily laid aside. It could
prepare for and welcome a better
future.
A United Voice
There was a time when
Stanford people acted as if they
had community in their minds.
For example, a couple of years
ago the voice of a united Stanford
could be heard, and it demanded
the end of Stanford complicity
with the war research at the
Stanford Research Institute, the
removal of ROTC's continued
inculcation of the philosophy of
the inevitability of murder into
Stanford minds, and even put
together a few resolutions against
permitting war researchers to use
Stanford facilities for offering war
dollars to help students make
vocational decisions.
A true community listened to
American Indians and agreed that
the best community would not
allow one of its racial groups to
remain a light-hearted symbol in
sports page headlines against its
will, and students laid out a buck
to get a community service, the
Day Care Center on Mayfield,
back on its feet. These things and
more rose above the scuffling and
seemed to say, "We are a
community, and we want to make
of ourselves a better one."
Enough Enough
Last week at election time

Stanford students let it be known
that enough was enough. The idea
was "Look at the time, I gotta
run. You know, people to meet,
credentials to pocket, things to
learn, future to fix up. No time
now. Be gone in a couple years
anyhow."
Yeah, it's zero bucks for
Citizens Advocates, none for Bach
Mai information (and none for the
Debate Union, whatever that
means). However, students did
not have to stand totally alone in
their resolve. A week ago Tuesday
the majority of the Daily editorial
board reminded students that the
proposed Citizen's Advocates
dollar "was their money in the
first place," a responsibility which
I might have assumed included the
right to send it where they felt it
would do the most good, and the
people's voice, Scott Burke,
patted the gang on the back for
fighting back what "was
unquestionably an unjustified
rip-off of Stanford students," a
typically careful and objective
characterization of an easily
retrievable self-assessment.
The argument for both these
public service entities was
simpleâ€”the Daily pointed out that
the organization would not "deal
specifically with student
problems" and President Burke
promised to put together "a bona
fide legal aid society directly
benefitting Stanford students,"
both drawing a bold black line
between students and citizens.
Not that the difference is genetic,
merely operational, but we won't
tolerate any shittin' around trying
to make the twain meet.
Cosmology
Now I have to admit that it is
hard to fit a student government
fee assessment election into the
scheme of the cosmos, but the
significance here derives from the
atrophy of the alternatives.
For one thing, fightin's out of
style (out, out, damned body
blocking the door) and fun's
where the fair's at. It has been
established that we students aren't
going to have much direct control
over the ultimate use of the
thousand dollars or so a quarter
we chip into the kitty (although
we did have the chance to assign a
little under 0.5 cents per tuition
check to Bach Mai information).
We really should use what we've
got left before we lose it, and
aesthetic considerations alone
demand that we busy the ASSU
with reminding students again

that they can do something about
Bach Mai instead of scurrying
about making who gets credit for
the Grateful Dead concert the
burning issue of the month.
Things are going to keep
changing. In the remaining three
year, ten months, and two weeks
of Four More Years, you can bet
that a cold climate will blow some
chilly winds against the walls of
the ivory tower. But sometime the
climate will change, and when
that time comes I would like to
expect of Stanford at least a
model of a community in which
people thought of themselves in
the act of making their
community better. In the
meantime, you might say it's a
nice place to visit.
