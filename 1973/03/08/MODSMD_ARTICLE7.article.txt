# Two Cents' Worths
## The 						Election Situation 
### 
i√üocky Barber And John Milstein

The concept of an election
seems to have been a little
distorted by the Daily Editorial of
March 6.
In this past election the two
groups involved offer to help with
the running of the election. It was
decided (for some of the reasons
that the Daily outlined) that no
group should be allowed to buy
an election, but that a return to
having volunteer poll workers at
some polling places would be a
good precedent. Most groups
could supply volunteers, but few
could supply money.
The Senate simply accepted
these groups' offer to help. It was
a one-time arrangement, and no
other group is bound to do this in
the future. The burden of holding
elections and paying for them
must rest with the ASSU, if it is
to be democratic.
Smaller Groups
In the past, when larger groups
have been on the ballot, no one
has questioned the value of having
an election. Should smaller groups
be kept off just because their
interests don't superficially seem
to be as valid as others?
In that case we would never
need to have elections, if it was
clear what had the support of the
student body.
But if 1150 signatures are
collected, there must be some
interest in the issue. This is ten
percent of the student body,
California only requires five
percent for an initiative to be put
on the ballot.
By-Laws And Budget
Every effort is being made to
keep the election situation in

hand. The Student Senate is
carefully reviewing the by-laws of
the Association, including those
on elections.
Also a Program Fund Budget is
being drawn up which will
hopefully cut down on the
number of groups requesting
money in special elections. The
Senate will consider the Program
Fund Budget next Tuesday night
at its regularly scheduled meeting.
The student body will then have
to vote on the budget passed by
the Senate. The diversity and
number of the groups asking for
money, and the levels of funding
recommended will show that the
Senate this year has handled
requests for money in a
responsible fashion.
Finally, the possibility of
amending the Constitution to fix
a maximum of one election per
quarter is being actively pursued.
However, the desirability of this is
not clear. This year a total of four
elections will be held. The
probability of a fifth is quite low
since a program fund budget is
being drawn up. Making groups
get under a deadline of the third
week of the quarter as in the fall
Senate elections would mean that
groups would have to plan ahead
over the summer which is very
difficult.
Two Cents' Worth
It is well worth the two cents
which it costs each student for an
election to preserve the ability of
groups of students with a
community goal to get a fee
assessment. Just because several
fee assessments fail doesn't mean

that the voting system is at fault.
Perhaps the issues didn't have
enough support to pass. The
question must be asked: would
this editorial have been written if
both of the fee referenda had
passed?

Milstein are ASSU Senators.)
