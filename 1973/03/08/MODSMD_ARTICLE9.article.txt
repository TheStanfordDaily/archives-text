# Governmental Child-Rearing
## The 						Poor Are The Victims 
### 
Bill Evers

In their article, "Need for
Child Care Urgent" (Daily, March
6), Professors Eleanor Maccoby
and Patricia Greenfield adopt a
general approach to public policy
that is unsound. By looking onlv
at a microcosmic level at some of
day-care's effects on the family,
they never come to grips with the
larger political and ideological
issues.
In addition, some of their
assertions about the workings of
governmentally-financed
child-rearing can only give the
reader a false picture of what this
program is all about.
A false picture of governmental
child development is projected
because the goal of universal
federally-funded day-care is
obscured in their article. If one
examines the literature written by
hard-core advocates of
governmental child development,
one finds that the aim is to extend
the program to every child. Bella
Abzug's speeches, Patricia Gerald
Bourne's New Republic article,
and the language of the 1971
Office of Economic Opportunity
extension bill all speak of a
universal, tax-financed system.
Extension
Once this universal aspect of

child development plans is placed
in the forefront, we can recognize
the arogram as essentially an
extension of public education into
the earlier years of life.
Governmental schooling imprisons
(let us be plain-spoken) the young
and attempts to impose certain
(often wrong) values on them;
federal day-care centers will do
likewise.
Moreover, the empirical facts
show that the poor are in general
the victimsrof the welfare system,
including cljild-care.
First, pauper relief has
historically* been, as Piven and
Cloward recount in Regulating
the Poor, a social control device.
Whose Money
Second, as Katherine Ellis and
Rosalind Petchesky argue in
Social Policy, "most of the
health-care empire is underwritten
by ... the taxes of low-income
and lower-middle-income people."
This truth about the health-care
industry has, as Ellis and
Petchesky recognize, its parallel in
the emerging day-care system.
There is further specific
information available on the
relationship of the poor to
day-care programs.
New York State now runs a
day-care program whose effects
are well summarized in the words
of one angry mother quoted by
Sheila M. Rothman in her critique
of day-care in the winter 1973
Public Interest: "Rockefeller has
made day-care centers into
concentration camps for the
poorest black and Puerto Rican
families."
Parasitism
The current federally
sponsored Work Incentive
Program has day-care linked to it.
But this is only to transfer
parasitism from one group to
another. Under this welfare
program, subsidies that used to go
to unemployed mothers go
instead to teachers, social
workers, and psychologists.

A few poor people may end up
being subsidized by governmental
day-care. But why should an
honest, hard-working person,
whether poor, a stolid burgher, or
someone like Joan Baez, be taxed
to support it? What is wrong with
the sentiment of the current
taxpayers' revolt that there should
be no new taxes?
Maccoby and Greenfield write
that "if federal money were to go
to private profit-making
contractors, there would
presumably have to be some
federal standards and
supervision."
Standards and Profits
Yes, but we can assume that
the day-care industry probably
has already drafted the standards
for itself. Gabriel Kolko describes
in The Triumph of Conservatism
how during the Progressive Era
some big businesses devised and
used codes, standards, and
regulatory commissions to
exclude rivals, police cartel
arrangements, and preserve
market shares. I see no reason to
believe that members of the
day-care industry will not try to
maximize their profits by using
the government.
Federal standards have another
important aspect. They mean that
parental control is effectively
usurped by those running the
child-rearing system. The
paternalistic state comes into its
own as actual parental substitute.
To say that a child's own parents
will be able to give some advice
simply clouds the issue. It is as if
Johnny's parents were allowed by
a kidnapper, as the kidnapper
took Johnny away, to advise the
kidnapper about how to keep
Johnny happy.
As Rothman aptly describes it,
historically for day-care
proponents, the "biggest prize" is
the child. They have control over
the child at least during the
daylight hours.

My own conviction about
governmental day-care is that it
must be viewed in the context of
the corporate state that exists in
America today. We will be taxed
so that the head of some
privileged corporation in the
military-industrial complex will
have more thoroughly socialized
soldiers fighting on his behalf in
the next Vietnam war or have a
more docile labor force in his
factory.
What about the rights of those
opposed to the dominant school
of social psychology? What about
the injustice of taxing single
persons, childless couples, and
homosexuals in order to support
other people's having children?
What about the rights of people
having minority views on cultural,
religious, and political matters? It
is not without reason that
Christian Scientists, for example,

have strenuously objected to
governmental day-care.
It is here in the area of
taxation and individual values that
we must face the general approach
to public policy taken by
Professors Maccoby and
Greenfield. Taxation is theft, and
there exist conscientious objectors
to governmental child care, like
conscientious objectors to taxes
for warfare. These conscientious
objectors have every right to say,
"Give us back our resources," or
to refuse to hand them over in the
first place.
Finally, we must oppose
anything that smacks of Benito
Mussolini's view that "every child
is a child of the state." If we
don't, in ten years, as Rothman
suggests, we will be organizing
Committees for the Rights of
Children in Day-Care Centers.
