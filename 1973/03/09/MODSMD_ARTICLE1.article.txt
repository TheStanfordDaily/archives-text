LOS ANGELES — In his opening
argument Jan. 16, chief "Pentagon
Papers" prosecutor David Nissen told
the jurors that the government
intended to treat the matter as it
would any simple, non-political theft.
"We will present no witnesses in
evidence to litigate the [Vietnam]
War. We will not present any evidence
on the information policies of the
government or evidence on whether
the government has withheld
information about the War — withheld
too much, too little," Nissen said.
The tough prosecutor, a member of
the Justice Department's Internal
Security Division, told the 10-woman,
two-man jury that, he would not
attempt to define "national defense,"
nor would he present evidence about
the defendants' motivations, which he
said "do not excuse doing something
wrong."
The defendants in the case are
Daniel Ellsberg and Anthony J. Russo
Jr., both former Rand Corp. analysts
turned anti-war activists.
Conspiracy Charge
They are charged with conspiracy,
theft of government property and
espionage in connection with the
duplication and release of 18 volumes
of the "Papers" and eight pages of the
"Wheeler Report," a lengthy post-Tet
offensive assessment of the situation in
Vietnam. Both the "Papers" and the
"Wheeler Report" are classified "Top
Secret."
In order to prove that defendants
Ellsberg and Russo violated federal
espionage laws, Nissen had to show
that the release of the documents
damaged the national defense. He also
had to prove that the defendants
knowingly acted "against the best
interests of the United States."
In order to prove the theft charges,

Nissen had to demonstrate that the
documents "had a value in excess of
$100." Thus far, he has been unable to
do so because he has not been allowed
to introduce the payroll records of the
people who wrote the reports.
Nissen divided the government's
five-week-long presentation into two
distinct parts.
Prosecution Witnesses
Two high-ranking Army officers
were the principal prosecution
witnesses during the first phase.

Lt. Gen. William DePuy testified
that some of the information allegedly
released by the defendants "might be
the best information they [the North
Vietnamese] ever had."
DePuy, one of the authors of the
"Wheeler Report," said that the
document "proved useful in planning"
the highly-successful April, 1972
offensive. He asserted that release of
the report "is telling the North
Vietnamese command what action
