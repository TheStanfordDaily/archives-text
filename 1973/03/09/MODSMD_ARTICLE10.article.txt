# Impact Will Be Felt
## Fight The Budget Cuts 
### Young Socialists 
All across the country, the
impact of Nixon's attack on social
reforms, i.e., New Deal and Great
Society programs, is just
beginning to be felt by large
sections of working people and
youth.
This is the situation: Nixon, in
desperation, is forced to begin
destroying the living conditions
struggled for and won by the
American working class through a
period of unprecedented
prosperity. But it must be
understood that Nixon has
virtually no choice in this matter.
He now must turn upon the
working class to allow Big
Business to maintain profits
immediately threatened by the
developing trade war with
primarily Japan and Europe. The
post-war boom has ended.
Intimately related to the
intensifying trade war is the
monetary crisis. For years, U.S.
capitalism expanded through the
massive printing of paper dollars,
largely based on credit (i.e.,
empty promises). But now the
value of these nearly worthless
pieces of paper is being called into
question all over the world. By
removing the backing of gold
from the dollar on Aug. 15,1971
and the desperate back-to-back
devaluations, the whole basis of
international trade — an objective
standard of value — has been
undermined. Again, it is only
through effective wage cuts,
productivity drives, and the
vicious budget cutbacks, that
Nixon will futilely attempt to
restore value to the dollar.
Fighting Back
But the working class is not
accepting these attacks without
fighting back. Already in response
to specifically educational
cutbacks, there have been major
teacher strikes in Cleveland,
Chicago, St. Louis, and
Philadelphia. The eight-week long
strike in Philadelphia resulted in
the arrests of 800 teachers,
forcing the city's trade unions to
call for a general strike.
It is only within this national
and international perspective that
the Young Socialists are

conducting a campaign against the
budget cuts which are directly
affecting Stanford students,
particularly minorities and
working class youth.
Even before Nixon announced
the cuts, it was known that
tuition here was going to increase
10 percent, to over $3100.
Further, the inflation will increase
the basic costs of books, room and
board.
Effects
The following will be affected
by the budget cuts:
1) Work-study will be phased
out.
2) Medical School training
grants will be largely eliminated.
3) Supplementary Opportunity
Grants will be replaced by Basic
Opportunity Grants. The $622
million funding for the new
program hardly approaches the
most conservative estimate of the
$1.2 billion needed.
Loans
4) The National Defense
Student Loans (NDSL) will be
replaced with another program
with 4.5 percent higher interest
rates.
5) Graduate study will become
all but impossible for many when
only 350 graduate fellowships will
be awarded next year — compared
to 1225 four years ago.
6) Federal aid to area studies
and language training areas (e.g.,
Latin American and East Asian
Studies) will be phased out.
In this situation, students must
have a program of action to
defend the basic right of
education against the budget cuts.
The Young Socialists held a public
meeting Tuesday in which the
following perspectives and
demands were voted upon and
accepted:
Demands
1) No cuts in the work-study
program and grants programs.
2) No hikes in loan interest
rates, tuition, room and board.
3) Keep area studies and
language training programs from
being closed.
4) For the professors, students
and staff to turn to the labor
movement to help build a labor

party based on socialist policies.
And to support general strike
action if demands are not met.
The ad hoc committee which
was formed at the initial meeting
this week will present for
discussion the scheduled program
of action. Central to these
perspectives will be an immediate
meeting this coming Tuesday and
a rally scheduled for April 6. We
urge particularly that all
organizations with memberships
directly affected by these budget
cuts — such as USE, the BSU, and
MEChA — send representatives.
The mass emergency meeting
to fight against the budget cuts
will be held at 7:30 p.m. on
Tuesday, March 13, at History
Corner Room 228.
