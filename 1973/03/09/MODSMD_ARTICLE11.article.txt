Rebuttal
Editor:
In his rebuttal to the
Venceremos article about layoffs
and the need to unionize at
Stanford (Daily, March 6), Dexter
Francis accused us of not doing
our research. But we found that
several of his "facts" were the
ones in error.
First, the information in our
article was taken directly from
recent issues of Campus Report â€”
put out by the University
Administration.
Secondly, not all the workers
being laid off at SLAC have been
there for less than six months;
some workers who have been at
SLAC for as long as ten years are
being threatened.
Lastly, the majority of workers
in last year's NLRB primary
election voted for one of the three
unions on the ballot. That the
Teamsters lost the run-off which
followed does not contradict the
fact that the majority of workers
in the bargaining unit do want a
union.
