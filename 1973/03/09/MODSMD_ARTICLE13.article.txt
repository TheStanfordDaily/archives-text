Are there any University living units that cater to vegetarians? Do
any dorms offer vegetarian meals as an alternate plan? M.B.
There are several living units that offer vegetarian food.
The Breakers Coop, one of the eating clubs, is thinking of including
vegetarian dishes in its spring quarter menus. Plans have not yet been
finalized, but if you are interested in the idea call Greg Belt or Dave
Sampson at 325-3196 for more information.
According to Maxine Anderson, manager of the University Food
Service, Stern Hall is the only dorm that offers vegetarian food to
people who request it. However, Columbae, Ecology House, Synergy,
Hammarskjold (irregularly) and Beta Theta Phi all serve vegetarian
dishes. Two of the fraternities, Kappa Sigma and Sigma Alpha
Epsilon, will serve vegetarian food if one of the members really wants
it. And, of course, if you live in an apartment or trailer, you can fix
any kind of food you like.
How are the new age-limit rules for the Sunday Flicks going to be
enforced? F.F.
Baker Terry, Sunday Flicks manager, first of all clarified the "over
18 unless accompanied by parent" rule by saying that it applied to
non-Stanford students only. Anyone showing a Stanford ID card or
proof that they are over 18 may buy a ticket.
Terry said that student police officers would be standing next to
the ticket windows checking people "who look under 18." "If you
look young, be prepared to be carded," he said.
Terry "regrets having to be this restrictive" but is "convinced that
the main problem was caused by non-Stanford students under 18. We
will have to be even more restrictive if it's still noisy," he concluded.
An additional note: Terry will soon be selecting the Flicks for next
quarter, so at this week's Flick, "Sometimes a Great Notion,"
opinion polls will be passed out at both showings.
