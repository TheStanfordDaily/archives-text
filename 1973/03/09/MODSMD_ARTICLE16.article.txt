# Hotel Completion Set For August

### BILL WEINSTEIN 
The controversial Holiday Inn,
situated at the corner of El
Camino Real and University
Avenue in Palo Alto, will be
completed this August, according
to Project Director Richard Itaya
of Pacific Hotel Development
Corporation.
"Because of the weather, we've
been delayed but we're still
proceeding as fast as we can," he
said. The hotel will comprise 280
rooms and will be four stories
high.
The inn is situated on
Stanford-owned land leased to
Palo Alto over fifty years ago.
Because of the lease agreement,
Stanford has no jurisdiction in the
project, however. Project Director
Loren Snyder expected Stanford
to automatically renew the lease
when the present one expires. He
reasoned, "After all, Stanford is
not in the business of running
motels."
A debate raged last year in Palo
Alto over the hotel's construction
between business interests and
those favoring a residential zoning
of the area. The issue climaxed
with an initiative to stop the
building, but in June, 1972, Palo
Alto voters defeated the proposal.
Steve Anderson, zoning checker
for the Palo Alto Building

Department, said that the
construction had been held up by
an uncertified plumbing fixture.
He stated that the problem had
been resolved and that he
anticipated no further problems.
Anderson said that the Palo
Alto City Council recently
rezoned the immediate area
around the hotel so that the
council could, in effect, change
any features in the area to meet
the hotel's needs.
The hotel "will be comparable
to Rickey's Hyatt House," Snyder
said, and rates will start anywhere
between $2O and $3O. The project
director noted that the Inn would
be "luxurious," meaning in a
higher priced range, but would be
modeled after other Holiday Inns
in the Bay Area.
The hotel will have a luxury
restaurant, a Rolls Royce
limousine service to the airport, a
coffee shop, several meeting
rooms, a swimming pool, and a
Japanese water garden. Snyder
also said that a shuttle service
between Stanford, the Stanford
Hospital, and the hotel would be
established.
The Holiday Inn plans to serve
outpatients from the Stanford
Hospital, visiting parents of
Stanford students, foreign
dignitaries visiting Stanford,

visiting professors, and
businessmen involved with the
Stanford Industrial Park.
Questioned about further
expansion in the futu"\ Snyder
said that there was room to do so,
but he did not anticipate it.
