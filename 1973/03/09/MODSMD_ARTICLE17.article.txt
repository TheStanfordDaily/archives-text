# U.S. Energy Crisis Looms Ahead

Bundle up. Grab your wallets.
Get ready for more big price
increases for heat, light, gasoline
and everything that uses energy.
Count on occasional fuel
shortages, too. Don't expect
things to stop getting worse
before 1980, if then.
That's the general outlook for
America's energy problems.
Now for the bad news.
The possible side effects of the
energy mess are just as bad.
The possibilities include dirtier
oceans, dirtier foul air, radiation
poisoning, more stripmine gashes
in the American landscape, even
an international currency crisis.
How did the nation get into
this mess?
Who Gets The Blame?
Blame a laggard government
that has ignored warnings for at
least 20 years. Blame the drive of
major oil, gas, and coal companies
for high profits and low taxes
while demanding more economic
incentives to produce more.

Blame nature for putting more
cheap oil under Saudi Arabia than
under the United States and
Russia combined.
Blame the American consumer,
who makes up six percent of the
world's population but gobbles up
33 percent of the world's energy
supplies.
The nation's attention was
focused on the energy crisis last
fall when an early cold snap
caught fuel suppliers with their
reserves down. The result was a
fuel shortage in some areas. Seven
Denver schools closed or curtailed
their activities. A Chicago truck
stop reported 86 trucks stranded
and no diesel fuel available. lowa
bought up fuel and rationed it to
the neediest users.
Rationing Plans
The fall squeeze lasted for
various periods in different places,
roughly from September through
January. Now government
emergency planners have dusted
off standby rationing plans
because they see possible gasoline
shortages in scattered areas next
summer. Meanwhile the oil
industry is proclaiming an "energy
crisis," using $3 million worth of
television commercials to warn
that America may be running out
of oil.
That's partially true, but there
is still plenty of oil, gas and coal
in the world.
The U.S. Geological Survey
figures that enough coal has been
found in the United States alone
to last for two centuries, maybe
five. It also estimates that it will
take another 30 years to pump
out the bulk of America's
domestic oil, and another 30 years
beyond that to come close to
exhausting foreign supplies.
So why the shortages now?
Underlying Answers
A recent flurry of government
and industry reports agree on
these underlying answers:
Americans are energy
gluttons. The Interior Department
figures that Americans increased
their use of energy by an average

of 3.1 percent every year since
1947. Lately the rate has been
much higher, about 4.8 percent
between 1965 and 1970.
As energy demand soared,
the easy-to-get supplies dwindled.
For years the governments of
Texas, Louisiana and other
oil-producing states kept wells
pumping slowly to keep
production down and prices up.
But in 1970 demand had risen so
much that America's oil wells
were pumping at full tilt, and still
couldn't meet demand.
With demand outpacing
domestic supplies, President
Nixon reluctantly allowed more
and more foreign oil to flow into
the country. Since 1959 American
presidents had limited the amount
of foreign crude oil allowed into
the country to about 12.2 percent
of domestic consumption. But
imports now account for about 29
percent of consumption. And
most estimates say the Figure can
be expected to double in about a
decade.
Other factors ganged up to
strain America's home-grown
energy even further. Natural gas
producers sharply decreased their
official estimates of known gas
reserves, from a 40-year supp.y in
1941 to a 11-year supply in 1971.
Industry is clamoring for the
federal government to allow
higher gas prices to encourage
exploration. Meanwhile some
consumer groups call the
"shortage" a fraud invented to
force prices up.
These problems were
compounded by the government's
uncoordinated efforts in the
energy field. Sixty-five agencies
currently jostle each other to
form energy policy. American
refineries ran at full blast during
the summer turning out profitable
gasoline while skimping on less
profitable fuels such as home
heating oils.

President Nixon's former
energy chief, Director George
Lincoln of the Office of
Emergency Preparedness, received
constant assurances that
dwindling fuel oil reserves would
suffice for the winter.
Assurances Worthless
These assurances proved
worthless with the first cold
weather. "They just started too
damned late," Lincoln said
candidly three days before he
retired. Now that refineries have
turned to producing winter fuel
there is fear of summer gasoline
shortages and rationing. Producers
have jacked up winter fuel prices
so much the Cost of Living
Council is conducting a formal
investigation.
The Interior Department
reports that the refinery problem
is going to get worse. It takes two
or three years to build a new
refinery, and the industry is
building only two, to be
completed between now and the
end of 1975. By then it's
estimated that America will need
to import more than four million
barrels a day of refined fuels to

meet demand. That's nearly
double the present 2.2 million.
Amid all this, the industry had
a mediocre year financially in
1972. Profits of the 21 largest
firms slipped about 2 percent
while the rest of the economy
prospered. A recent survey by
Wall Street analysts predicted,
however, that oil would be the
hottest industry of 1973.
The conclusion that prices are
headed up emerges from studies
by both government and industry.
The only question appears to be
how high, how soon. There are a
number of reasons.
The oil industry, despite its
profits and advantageous
depletion allowances, says it needs
more incentive to produce more.
Foreign oil isn't so cheap any
more, either; it is only about 25
cents cheaper than domestic oil
on the East Coast, up to 50 cents
more expensive on the Gulf Coast.
The reason is that Saudi Arabia,
Venezuela, Libya, Iran and other
big oil-producing nations have
formed themselves into a
muscular international cartel that
has raised its prices.
