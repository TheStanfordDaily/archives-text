# Inmates, Students Discuss Self-Awareness
## Soledad Project Offers Classes 
### KATHY ALCALA 
One night a week Soledad inmates
are able to learn about and discuss
such subjects as black or Chicano
self-awareness, sociology, and art.
Because of the interest of a group of
Stanford students and the Soledad
inmates, classes are being held at the
Soledad Correctional Institution
through the Stanford-Soledad
Teaching Project, which will offer a
SWOPSI course spring quarter.
The project is divided into three
sections: The Black Studies Program,
the Chicano Studies Program, and the
General Education Program. Each of
these offers courses concerned with
the specific ethnic background of the
inmates, such as "African Civilization"
and"The History of the Chicano," as
well as courses of general interest,
including art and sociology.
There are currently about five
Stanford students in each of the
sections who make the 100-mile trip
to Soledad one evening a week. They
hold lecture and discussion type
classes, with the assistance and advice

of Asst. History Prof. Kennell Jackson,
Political Science Prof. Frank Bonilla
and Acting Asst. Spanish Prof.
Gustavo Valadez.
Approval Needed
All prospective participants in the
teaching project must have their names
submitted to the Solpdad
administration for approval. People
with suspected or known radical
affiliations are generally not accepted.
Most professors have also failed to be
cleared to teach, as opposed to
students. "The administration deals
from the position of total power,"
according to one of the student
teachers.
The project originated during the
winter quarter of 1971 when students
from a political science course here
called "Racism and Law
Enforcement" visited Soledad. Four
black students, motivated by what
they saw and learned, were able to
secure the help of several faculty
members and administrators in starting
an educational program the following
summer.

The summer pilot project was
geared primarily towards black
inmates and was sponsored from inside
the prison by the Black Awareness
Group of North Facility. It was taught
by Noli Price and Judy Johnson, with
supervision by Bonilla and
Anthropology Prof. St. Clair Drake.
Their experiences during the summer
of 1971 revealed a need and interest
among the inmates for an expanded
program of advanced educational
material.
Increased Interaction
The format developed during the
summer pilot project was to provide
the basis for increased
Stanford-Soledad interaction. In
December 1971, a group of students
who had been involved in prison
studies under Bonilla formulated a
plan to take courses into Soledad
prison. This plan was presented to and
approved by the prison administrators
at Soledad in January, 1972. The
students were then allowed to meet
with the inmates and plan the new
courses to be offered that winter and
spring. The result was the project
which is presently underway.
The prisoners have been very
receptive to the program. "All classes
have been on the basis of requests,"
according to Sina Morgan, a Stanford
participant. The classes provide a night
activity which allows the men to leave
their cells and attend lectures and
seminars pertaining to their special
interests. Many of them have written
letters requesting that the program be
continued and expanded, and thanking
the students for their concern.

The teaching program has also
shown long range effects. Many
inmates who have since been released
have not lost their new-found interest
in education. Some are now working
in the Pinot Community Center, an
inmate-run half-way house in San Jose,
while many others are now attending
college. A number of men have kept in
touch with their former instructors.
So far, the only problems have been
with the Soledad administration and a
shortage of funds. A member of the
administration or a guard must be
present at all of the classes, and any
revolutionary literature or rhetoric is

excluded from the curriculum. The
student participants feel that many of
the administration's decisions have
been arbitrary and enforced without
valid justification. A proposed law
course was refused approval, which
helped to increase these feelings.
"They test us to see how committed
we are," says Ray Santana, a
coordinator in the program.
The funding is presently being
managed by Sal Sanchez, Assistant to
the President. According to Sanchez,
"The project needs more
administrative and faculty support."
He has divided the financing into three
areas: the immediate need, which has
been met until the end of spring
quarter; the intermediate need, which
includes financing for the summer and
perhaps next fall; and a permanent
need, which calls for funding on a
continual basis so that the program
can be carried through in the following
years.
In the past, funds have been
provided by the University Fellows.
Sanchez is presently applying for
various grants, and has placed the
project on the University Provost's list
of programs to be considered for
funding.
