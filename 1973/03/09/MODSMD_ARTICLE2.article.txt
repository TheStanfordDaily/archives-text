# Inmates, Students Discuss Self-Awareness
## Soledad Project Offers Classes 
### KATHY ALCALA 
One night a week Soledad inmates
are able to learn about and discuss
such subjects as black or Chicano
self-awareness, sociology, and art.
Because of the interest of a group of
Stanford students and the Soledad
inmates, classes are being held at the
Soledad Correctional Institution
through the Stanford-Soledad
Teaching Project, which will offer a
SWOPSI course spring quarter.
The project is divided into three
sections: The Black Studies Program,
the Chicano Studies Program, and the
General Education Program. Each of
these offers courses concerned with
the specific ethnic background of the
inmates, such as "African Civilization"
and"The History of the Chicano," as
well as courses of general interest,
including art and sociology.
There are currently about five
Stanford students in each of the
sections who make the 100-mile trip
to Soledad one evening a week. They
hold lecture and discussion type
classes, with the assistance and advice

of Asst. History Prof. Kennell Jackson,
Political Science Prof. Frank Bonilla
and Acting Asst. Spanish Prof.
Gustavo Valadez.
Approval Needed
All prospective participants in the
teaching project must have their names
submitted to the Solpdad
administration for approval. People
with suspected or known radical
affiliations are generally not accepted.
Most professors have also failed to be
cleared to teach, as opposed to
students. "The administration deals
from the position of total power,"
according to one of the student
teachers.
The project originated during the
winter quarter of 1971 when students
from a political science course here
called "Racism and Law
Enforcement" visited Soledad. Four
black students, motivated by what
they saw and learned, were able to
secure the help of several faculty
members and administrators in starting
an educational program the following
summer.

The summer pilot project was
geared primarily towards black
inmates and was sponsored from inside
the prison by the Black Awareness
Group of North Facility. It was taught
by Noli Price and Judy Johnson, with
supervision by Bonilla and
Anthropology Prof. St. Clair Drake.
Their experiences during the summer
of 1971 revealed a need and interest
among the inmates for an expanded
program of advanced educational
material.
Increased Interaction
The format developed during the
summer pilot project was to provide
the basis for increased
Stanford-Soledad interaction. In
December 1971, a group of students
who had been involved in prison
studies under Bonilla formulated a
plan to take courses into Soledad
prison. This plan was presented to and
approved by the prison administrators
at Soledad in January, 1972. The
students were then allowed to meet
with the inmates and plan the new
