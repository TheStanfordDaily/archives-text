# 'Deathwatch' Plays In Roble
## 
### JEFFERY SEGAL 
To a casual reader the script of
"Deathwatch" by Jean Genet, which has been
produced independently and is being played
for the last time this weekend in Roble Hall,
may well seem to be just another naturalistic
prison melodrama. The script is tightly
constructed, the language is logical, and there
is a strong sense of linear time.
But a warning to that would-be reader: If
you think that the nature of the play is such,
you are wrong. Rather than have that happen,
go see this illuminating production, and find
out what the play is all about.
Genet achieved world fame for his writings
while he was in prison. How he got there,
Genet himself best describes in his book, A
Thieve's Journal, "Abandoned by my family,
I found it natural to aggravate this fact by
stealing, and stealing by crime, or the
complicity with crime. Thus I decisively
repudiated a world that had repudiated me."
Presidential Pardon
In 1948 he was pardoned by the president
of France on the petition of many great
French writers of the day, among them Gide,
Sartre, and Cocteau. His writings after his
release have served him as psychotherapy, in
that they brought him back to a gradual
reacknowledgementof the outside world that
he had renounced.
But "Deathwatch," written while he was
still in prison, affords a frightening glimpse
into the world of inverted values created by
Genet, an anti-world that, by taking its
reference from the world of so call normality,
mocks the very world of which it is a mirror
image. This is Genet's fantasy of power,
homosexuality, sado-masochism and ultimate
evil that justified his whole existence.
In a small prison cell a harsh, overhead
light falls on three criminals dressed in
"violent" colors of black and white. "The
entire play," Genet states in his stage
directions, "unfolds as in a dream." The cell is
run by Green Eyes, who has killed a girl in a
fit of passion.
The other convicts are Maurice, seventeen
and the youngest of the three, and Le Franc, a
prisoner waiting for his release in three days.
On the cell block above them lives the
never-seen boss of the priosn, Snowball.
Read On
Before reading any farther, if metaphysics
bores you skip to the end and save the
analysis of the play until just before bedtime
with a glass of warm milk. If, however, you
feel brave today, read on.
Snowball is most admired because his

crime was the most "necessary," the most
forced upon him by fate. In this value system
the most perfected criminal is apotheosized.
That is to say, Snowball's crime was the most
gratuitous, therefore the most complete unto
itself.
The point is that by a metaphysically
Christlike assumption of one's total guilt one
can transcend it to a state of Godhood. Within
his cell Green Eyes is regarded as the God
figure, although above him is Snowball, since
Snowball's crime was more unavoidable than
Eye's crime passionel.
Maurice and Le Franc both worship Green
Eyes, but in different ways. Maurice is the one
with the truest criminal nature, but he so
worships Green Eyes that he is robbed of the
initiative to commit an act himself; he lives
only through Green Eyes. Le Franc wants
even to become Green Eyes, and to perform
an act of evil which he hopes will raise him up
to Green Eye's stature.
Inevitable Surrender
Le Franc will fail to be a true criminal
though, because the crime he will commit will
be far from gratuitous, but committed for the
end of obtaining this grace of divine evil.
Grace, Le France will learn, must come as a
gift, and the crime must be no more than a
surrender to the inevitable. When "grace"
does come to Le France, it comes in a manner
that he least expected.
Both Maurice and Le Franc vie for the
affection of Green Eyes. The three engage in a
truly ritualistic series of betrayals,
degradations, and submissions which bring to
light the masculine-feminine duality in man
and the sado-masochistic nature of love in
gripping moments of homosexuality and
violence.
This production, directed by John Chioles
of the Stanford Department of Drama, makes
explicit the fantasies of these men and the
dream that is the whole play. The players
move, one or two at a time, in or out of focus,
as if one were viewing a merry-go-round
through a camera lens focused at short range,
so that one could only observe a given horse
for a brief minute as it whirls by, before it
fades into a blur in the background.
Colin Bruce as Green Eyes must be seen to
be appreciated. Hist range and depth of
control, the subtlety of his characterization,
and his ability to manipulate the audience
with the slightest nuance of expression are
spellbinding.
Deliberate Choice
Bill Mahone as Le Franc and Glenn
Thompson as Maurice fare much less well, due
to what had to be a deliberate choice on the

part of the director Chioles, that is to cast
them in the roles eactly opposite to the ones
for which they are physically suited. Whatever
the reason, it is a perversion of Genet, if such
a thing is possible, and unjustifiable because it
does not play.
Genet stresses throughout the play the
external delicacy and femininity of Maurice to
bring out the seductive, feminine part of him
and portray the sexual nature of his
submission to the powerful Le Franc's
violence.
But in what appeared to be an effort to
heighten the effect of the submission, Chioles
cast Thompson, by far the stronger, more
thickly built, and less "pretty" of the two, in
the role of Maurice. In contrast Mahone,
short, slim, and attractive, plays Le Franc.
The result is not disastrous, but certainly
embarassing. Thompson never once is able to
display the feminine delicacy necessary for
Maurice.
Huffing and Puffing
Mahone, on the other hand, has to do a lot
of huffing and puffing to try to get tough, and
the sight of him assailing Maurice looks more
silly than sensual. However, Thompson and
Malone bring a dedication and a craft to their
roles that often shines through their
impossible assignments and keeps the play
alive.
Not to go without mention, the slimy
guard was carried off with aplomb by
Anthony Piazza.
"Deathwatch" is not a play for everybody.
If an audience is willing, as does Genet, to
acknowledge the dark side of themselves, the
show can be as engrossing an escapist fantasy
and vicarious thrill as when one's righteous
side watches Doris Day solve the problems of
the world with a smile and a song and never
wrinkle her skirt.
However, those who refuse to surrender
themselves to the art of the play will probably
be shocked, worried, and possibly offended.
This play is an important work in that it
marks the beginning of Absurdist drama. But
it is neither a museum piece nor unintelligible.
This production is a bold and daring student
undertaking, and deserves the attendance of a
mature, open-minded audience of people
interested in expanding their horizons.
Most importantly one should have a chance
to draw his own conclusions, for Genet does
not answer all the questions, and if one
chooses, to throw this review in the waste
basket.
"Deathwatch" will be performed tonight
and tomorrow in Roble Hall at 8 p.m.
Admission is free.
