# Expanding Corridor
## 'Infinite Images' Exhibition 
### 
"Infinite Images," an
environmental corridor
constructed with wood, glass,
mirror, mirropane and spot lights
by Domingo Alvarez, is now on
exhibition in the Tresidder Small
Lounge.
Alvarez, a Venezuelan artist,
born in Santo Domingo in 1935,
has lived in Venezuela since 1937.
In 1959 he received his degree in
architecture from the Universidad
Central de Venezuela, and
between 1959 and 1961 he did
post-graduate work in the
Instituto Universitario de
Architettura in Venice.
In 1961 he became a professor
of design in the Taller Villanueva
of the Faculty of Architecture,
Universidad Central de Venezuela.
In addition to architecture and

urban planning, Alvarez has
created a singular body of work
fusing diverse media: painting
sculpture, theater, music, film,
and architecture.
It is with attack on the general
concept of space that Alvarez
conducts his artistic experiments
and it is from this point that the
radius of importance of his
contribution spreads. His work
contains within itself a great
potential for renewal, not only of
the forms and appearances of
today's artistic expression but
beyond that of its very basic
concepts. Still further, it contains
the possibility of the eventual
reshaping of public sensibilities.
Fundamental Element
For Alvarez space becomes not
only a new element to be utilized,

but is the fundamental element of
his experience. Alvarez states that
"In all periods of time,
architecture has been subject to
one common denominator
space." Its aim has always been to
involve life's functions with
space."
In the work of Alvarez the
focusing of attention on a vision
of space is spontaneously and
immediately apparent causing us
to reflect upon it. For this reason
the participation of the spectator
in his darkened rooms and spatial
environments is not only of a
physical and sensorial nature but
also one of mental activity.
The exhibition continues
through March 11, from 9 a.m. to
9 p.m. Admission is 50 cents
general, 25 cents for students.
