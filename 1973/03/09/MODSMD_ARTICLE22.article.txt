# 'Play It An It Lays
## Film Without Spine 
### ELLEN KENESHEA 
Director Frank Perry makes
movies that worry about people
who lack usefulness. Unable to
cope with purposeless societal
roles, his characters drop out,
fantasize, or recreate the world in
warped images. From "David and
Lisa" (1962), through "The
Swimmer" (1968), "Last
Summer" (1969), and "Diary of a
Mad Housewife" (1970), Perry's
outlook has become progressively
more bleak.

"Play It As It Lays" is Perry's
latest cheerless step in his
pessimistic descent through life.
Based on the novel of the same
name by Joan Didion, "Play It As
It Lays" concerns a Hollywood
actress, Maria (Tuesday Weld)
suffeiing from an unspecified
malaise that's filtered through Los
Angeles. Maria is not unhappy,
just restless and confused.
She yearns for something
meaningful — she wants to ask
metaphysical questions. But
making meaning is work, and she
can't think of the right questions.
So she decides in the end to adopt
an attitude of indifference to all
except daily minutia like how
sunlight looks on pottery.
"Why?" she is asked. "Why not?"
she replies.
It's an appropriate one for her,
but hardly profound or even
interesting enough to necessitate
the film.
Marriage Break-Up
Maria is married to a cultist
director, but their marriage is
breaking up simply because it
doesn't matter. She turns to a
producer friend, B.Z. (Anthony

Perkins) for solace, but he has
figured out that "all of life means
zero" and the only comfort lies in
the possibility of suicide.
The rest of the characters in
"Play It As It Lays," though not
more selfish than Maria and 8.Z.,
are less self-aware, and traipse
through their lives unconcerned
that something may be missing.
All in all, the characters in the
film are a rather depressing bunch.
They are also, to be sure, rich and
beautiful, but this has nothing to

do with their empty lives, it only
allows them to pursue
dissatisfaction in style and
comfort.
Weld is a competent, but dull
Maria. Her uneasiness is too vague,
and her attempts at self-discovery
too half-hearted to remain
interesting for very long.
As B.Z.'s wife, Tammy Grimes
adds some life, if only through a
lively cynicism, and is at least

interestingly unmotivated. She
enjoys being dissolute and frankly
disdains her husband's nihilism
"Where you are is shit," she tells
him.
Self-Satisfied Doldrums
One is tempted to agree, since
one of the most annoying things
about B.Z. is that he is so
self-satisfied in his doldrums.
Perkins makes some attempt at
warming B.Z. up, and does at least
give him a sense of humor most of
the time though he has to work
hard at it. Perkins is in fact quite
the best thing about "Play It As It
Lays," and the otherwise slow
film picks up considerably
whenever he's on-screen.
Though the film is slickly
photographed, there isn't much to
the gloss. The screenplay by
Didion and John Gregory Dunne
lacks punch, its platitudes are
pretentious, its premises facile.
"Play It As It Lays" is a soft
film as lacking in backbone as its
characters. It's also a disturbing
film, though not because of its
soul-searching or nihilism, both of
which are too glib to be troubling.
But the characters in "Play It As
It Lays" are finally so secure in
their indifferences and so smug in
their lack of feeling that one
wonders exactly why they, and
Perry, should ever have worried
about themselves at all and
suspects that they never really
did.

outlook has become progressively
more bleak.

"Play It As It Lays" is Perry's
latest cheerless step in his
pessimistic descent through life.
Based on the novel of the same
name by Joan Didion, "Play It As
It Lays" concerns a Hollywood
actress, Maria (Tuesday Weld)
suffeiing from an unspecified
malaise that's filtered through Los
Angeles. Maria is not unhappy,
just restless and confused.
She yearns for something
meaningful — she wants to ask
metaphysical questions. But
making meaning is work, and she
can't think of the right questions.
So she decides in the end to adopt
an attitude of indifference to all
except daily minutia like how
sunlight looks on pottery.
"Why?" she is asked. "Why not?"
she replies.
It's an appropriate one for her,
but hardly profound or even
interesting enough to necessitate
the film.
Marriage Break-Up
Maria is married to a cultist
director, but their marriage is
breaking up simply because it
doesn't matter. She turns to a
producer friend, B.Z. (Anthony

Perkins) for solace, but he has
figured out that "all of life means
zero" and the only comfort lies in
the possibility of suicide.
The rest of the characters in
"Play It As It Lays," though not
more selfish than Maria and 8.Z.,
are less self-aware, and traipse
through their lives unconcerned
that something may be missing.
All in all, the characters in the
film are a rather depressing bunch.
They are also, to be sure, rich and
beautiful, but this has nothing to

do with their empty lives, it only
allows them to pursue
dissatisfaction in style and
comfort.
Weld is a competent, but dull
Maria. Her uneasiness is too vague,
and her attempts at self-discovery
too half-hearted to remain
interesting for very long.
As B.Z.'s wife, Tammy Grimes
adds some life, if only through a
lively cynicism, and is at least

interestingly unmotivated. She
enjoys being dissolute and frankly
disdains her husband's nihilism
"Where you are is shit," she tells
him.
Self-Satisfied Doldrums
One is tempted to agree, since
one of the most annoying things
about B.Z. is that he is so
self-satisfied in his doldrums.
Perkins makes some attempt at
warming B.Z. up, and does at least
give him a sense of humor most of
the time though he has to work
hard at it. Perkins is in fact quite
the best thing about "Play It As It
Lays," and the otherwise slow
film picks up considerably
whenever he's on-screen.
Though the film is slickly
photographed, there isn't much to
the gloss. The screenplay by
Didion and John Gregory Dunne
lacks punch, its platitudes are
pretentious, its premises facile.
"Play It As It Lays" is a soft
film as lacking in backbone as its
characters. It's also a disturbing
film, though not because of its
soul-searching or nihilism, both of
which are too glib to be troubling.
But the characters in "Play It As
It Lays" are finally so secure in
their indifferences and so smug in
their lack of feeling that one
wonders exactly why they, and
Perry, should ever have worried
about themselves at all and
suspects that they never really
did.

Director Frank Perry makes
movies that worry about people
who lack usefulness. Unable to
cope with purposeless societal
roles, his characters drop out,
fantasize, or recreate the world in
warped images. From "David and

Summer" (1969), and "Diary of a
