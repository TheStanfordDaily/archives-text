# Pitch To College Press Fails To Acquit 'A Name For Evil'
## 
### JON KENNEDY 
Twenty- eight-year-old
filmmaker Reed Sherman wanted
the reaction of the collegiate press
to his first film, "A Name for
Evil," so after it had opened at
several Bay Area locations he and
Cinerama Releasing threw a
cocktail-party screening just for
us. Sherman was introduced,
along with his film, by an old
friend who has produced and
directed about three dozen films
in as many years, and it was
apparent they really wanted a
good reaction to this film.
"Reed put his soul in hawk for
half a million dollars to make this
film," the introduction went,
"and the people at the Examiner
just don't understand it." It had
been panned in the evening paper.
Despite the free cocktails (I
don't drink anyway) and dry
roasted peanuts, not to mention
the hype, I have to say the
Examiner's reaction, seconded
next morning by the Chronicle,
was easier to understand than "A
Name for Evil." It's a pretentious
film, and maybe even just a bomb.
In fact, from a run of the mill
mass media perspective, about the
most you can give it is what the
current Playboy allows in the
opening of its coverage:
"The best thing about 'A Name
for Evil,' a recently released film
starring Robert Culp and
Samantha Eggar, is its
scenery—breath-taking mountain
country and amply exposed
anatomies."
Putting Us On
But Playboy is putting us on,
too. There's a good deal more
anatomy exposure in their stills
from the movie than on the
screen; it may all be there, but if
so it must be one frame per

exposure. The way Playboy
represents it (and I know this only
because Cinerama reprinted their
spread for free distribution), it
would make "Last Tango in Paris"
dated before it even gets here.
My wife compared "Evil" with
"Beyond the Valley of the Dolls"
(it's not that bad), and I saw
similarities to "The Deep End,"
"The Lickerish Quartet," and
Robert Altman's current release,
"Images," but it's not that good.
We were told this was a
message film, and asked to think,
hard, about it, catching the
similarities to Truffaut and
Bergman, because 20 years from
now, they said, this is the kind of
film that will be surviving—this is
what the younger generation is
picking up on.
I don't care much whether a
film is pretentious anyway, if it
has a solid message.
What you're supposed to look
for, in this picture, is just what
the name for evil is. It could be
Communism: In a eulogy for the
lead character's brother killed in
the war, the minister says he died
fighting for the honor of his
country against the Red Menace.
But if that's what it is, the rest
of the characters must be
unknowingly caught up in the
web of subversion, too. John
Blake (Robert Culp) applauds
derisively what the minister says,
hardly the thing to do at his
brother's funeral.
It could be schizophrenia
(hence the similarity to Altman's
"Images" and Bergman's
"Personna"). John Balke is
haunted by his great-great
grandfather, whose mansion the
wealthy dropout is determined to
restore as a dream home for
himself and his wife of five years.

The ghost is John Blake's other
side emerging, drawing him away
after strange women and turning
him against the wife he seemed to
love in the beginning, and
eventually making him a
murderer.
Pursues Freedom
If you read it biblically, the
name for evil could be sin—that's
what they used to call it—or, to
word it according to more
contemporary theology, a desire
for self-autonomy (being the
creator of one's own values and
absolutes, in defiance of any
higher law). Blake does start out,
in this tale, by denoucing his work
and career to pursue his own
freedom.
Casting off his place in the
family firm and throwing the
television out his 40th floor
apartment window to smash in
the cemetery below symbolized
his rejection of the culture that
produced him. Inevitably he
would also throw his wife
(Samantha Eggar) out the
window, literally, once this
penchant for self-determination
came into full maturity.
Or, if you prefer a nihilistic
interpretation, the name for evil
could be death: a strain of
symbolism runs throughout—the
cemetery into which the TV
crashes, the great-great
grandfather's ghost and his white
horse which carries Blake to a
village hoedown which turns into
an orgy and culminates in
adultery, the loss of the
soldier-brother, and the climax of
it all in the mad murder of the
anti-hero's wife.
Undefiable Laws
I think Sherman wanted us to
get both of the latter readings. Sin

and death are inseparable. Work is
part of the same curse which
produces death; you can't defy
the laws of your own psychical
makeup (sin against your own
identity) without paying a penalty
in death. When Blake started
defying those laws, death entered
the picture: first the feeling of
death which he took for his
ancestor's ghost; the dust of death
in the old house, and the death of
his brother. But he failed to heed
its warning.
If you get that message from
"A Name for Evil," then the thing
to call it is not pretentious but
great, a brilliant first film from a
promising young filmmaker. And,
I must admit, I'm not sure the
technological inferiority in this
film and its obscurity make it
inherently inferior, in themselves,
to others similarly marked but
stamped with the brand of Svensk
Filmindustry and English
subtitles.
There's a lot missing from "A
Name for Evil,' lfeaving a lot to be
desired. The script is
unimaginative and unmoving, its
most serious flaw. There is never
enough insight to develop
intensity or character depth,
probably because the director
never decided to make the ghost
story secondary and the life and
death conflict within John Blake
primary. But still the film is worth
seeing; an audience could learn
something from it. I can only
hope it will.
I know Reed Sherman already
has.

family firm and throwing the
television out his 40th floor
apartment window to smash in
the cemetery below symbolized
his rejection of the culture that
produced him. Inevitably he
would also throw his wife
(Samantha Eggar) out the
window, literally, once this
penchant for self-determination
came into full maturity.
Or, if you prefer a nihilistic
interpretation, the name for evil
could be death: a strain of
symbolism runs throughout—the
cemetery into which the TV
crashes, the great-great
grandfather's ghost and his white
horse which carries Blake to a
village hoedown which turns into
an orgy and culminates in
adultery, the loss of the
soldier-brother, and the climax of
it all in the mad murder of the
anti-hero's wife.
Undefiable Laws
I think Sherman wanted us to
get both of the latter readings. Sin

and death are inseparable. Work is
part of the same curse which
produces death; you can't defy
the laws of your own psychical
makeup (sin against your own
identity) without paying a penalty
in death. When Blake started
defying those laws, death entered
the picture: first the feeling of
death which he took for his
ancestor's ghost; the dust of death
in the old house, and the death of
his brother. But he failed to heed
its warning.
If you get that message from
"A Name for Evil," then the thing
to call it is not pretentious but
great, a brilliant first film from a
promising young filmmaker. And,
I must admit, I'm not sure the
technological inferiority in this
film and its obscurity make it
inherently inferior, in themselves,
to others similarly marked but
stamped with the brand of Svensk
Filmindustry and English
subtitles.
There's a lot missing from "A
Name for Evil,' lfeaving a lot to be
desired. The script is
unimaginative and unmoving, its
most serious flaw. There is never
enough insight to develop
intensity or character depth,
probably because the director
never decided to make the ghost
story secondary and the life and
death conflict within John Blake
primary. But still the film is worth
seeing; an audience could learn
something from it. I can only
hope it will.
I know Reed Sherman already
has.

TV RETROSPECTIVE—Art Carney (left) and Jackie Gleason enjoy a
cup of coffee in a scene from"The Honeymooners," one of the TV
shows from the 50's to be screend tonight and tomorrow at 7 and 10
at Palo Alto High, 50 Embarcadero, just off El Camino. Admission is
$1.
Twenty- eight-year-old
filmmaker Reed Sherman wanted
the reaction of the collegiate press
to his first film, "A Name for
Evil," so after it had opened at
several Bay Area locations he and
Cinerama Releasing threw a
cocktail-party screening just for
us. Sherman was introduced,
along with his film, by an old
friend who has produced and
directed about three dozen films
in as many years, and it was
apparent they really wanted a
good reaction to this film.
"Reed put his soul in hawk for
half a million dollars to make this
film," the introduction went,
"and the people at the Examiner
just don't understand it." It had
been panned in the evening paper.
Despite the free cocktails (I
don't drink anyway) and dry
roasted peanuts, not to mention
the hype, I have to say the
Examiner's reaction, seconded
next morning by the Chronicle,
was easier to understand than "A
Name for Evil." It's a pretentious
film, and maybe even just a bomb.
In fact, from a run of the mill
mass media perspective, about the
most you can give it is what the
current Playboy allows in the
opening of its coverage:
"The best thing about 'A Name
for Evil,' a recently released film
starring Robert Culp and
Samantha Eggar, is its
scenery—breath-taking mountain
country and amply exposed
anatomies."
Putting Us On
But Playboy is putting us on,
too. There's a good deal more
anatomy exposure in their stills
from the movie than on the
screen; it may all be there, but if
so it must be one frame per

exposure. The way Playboy
represents it (and I know this only
because Cinerama reprinted their
spread for free distribution), it
would make "Last Tango in Paris"
dated before it even gets here.
My wife compared "Evil" with
"Beyond the Valley of the Dolls"
(it's not that bad), and I saw
similarities to "The Deep End,"
"The Lickerish Quartet," and
Robert Altman's current release,
"Images," but it's not that good.
We were told this was a
message film, and asked to think,
hard, about it, catching the
similarities to Truffaut and
Bergman, because 20 years from
now, they said, this is the kind of
film that will be surviving—this is
what the younger generation is
picking up on.
I don't care much whether a
film is pretentious anyway, if it
has a solid message.
What you're supposed to look
for, in this picture, is just what
the name for evil is. It could be
Communism: In a eulogy for the
lead character's brother killed in
the war, the minister says he died
fighting for the honor of his
country against the Red Menace.
But if that's what it is, the rest
of the characters must be
unknowingly caught up in the
web of subversion, too. John
Blake (Robert Culp) applauds
derisively what the minister says,
hardly the thing to do at his
brother's funeral.
It could be schizophrenia
(hence the similarity to Altman's
"Images" and Bergman's
"Personna"). John Balke is
haunted by his great-great
grandfather, whose mansion the
wealthy dropout is determined to
restore as a dream home for
himself and his wife of five years.

The ghost is John Blake's other
side emerging, drawing him away
after strange women and turning
him against the wife he seemed to
love in the beginning, and
eventually making him a
murderer.
Pursues Freedom
If you read it biblically, the
name for evil could be sin—that's
what they used to call it—or, to
word it according to more
contemporary theology, a desire
for self-autonomy (being the
creator of one's own values and
absolutes, in defiance of any
higher law). Blake does start out,
in this tale, by denoucing his work
and career to pursue his own
freedom.
Casting off his place in the
family firm and throwing the
television out his 40th floor
apartment window to smash in
the cemetery below symbolized

country and amply exposed
anatomies."
Putting Us On
But Playboy is putting us on,
too. There's a good deal more
anatomy exposure in their stills
from the movie than on the
screen; it may all be there, but if
so it must be one frame per

exposure. The way Playboy
represents it (and I know this only
because Cinerama reprinted their
spread for free distribution), it
would make "Last Tango in Paris"
dated before it even gets here.
My wife compared "Evil" with
"Beyond the Valley of the Dolls"
(it's not that bad), and I saw
similarities to "The Deep End,"
"The Lickerish Quartet," and
Robert Altman's current release,
"Images," but it's not that good.
We were told this was a
message film, and asked to think,
hard, about it, catching the
similarities to Truffaut and
Bergman, because 20 years from
now, they said, this is the kind of
film that will be surviving—this is
what the younger generation is
picking up on.
I don't care much whether a
film is pretentious anyway, if it
has a solid message.
What you're supposed to look
for, in this picture, is just what
the name for evil is. It could be
Communism: In a eulogy for the
lead character's brother killed in
the war, the minister says he died
fighting for the honor of his
country against the Red Menace.
But if that's what it is, the rest
of the characters must be
unknowingly caught up in the
web of subversion, too. John
Blake (Robert Culp) applauds
derisively what the minister says,
hardly the thing to do at his
brother's funeral.
It could be schizophrenia
(hence the similarity to Altman's
"Images" and Bergman's
"Personna"). John Balke is
haunted by his great-great
grandfather, whose mansion the
wealthy dropout is determined to
restore as a dream home for
himself and his wife of five years.

The ghost is John Blake's other
side emerging, drawing him away
after strange women and turning
him against the wife he seemed to
love in the beginning, and
eventually making him a
murderer.
Pursues Freedom
If you read it biblically, the
name for evil could be sin—that's
what they used to call it—or, to
word it according to more
contemporary theology, a desire
for self-autonomy (being the
creator of one's own values and
absolutes, in defiance of any
higher law). Blake does start out,
in this tale, by denoucing his work
and career to pursue his own
freedom.
Casting off his place in the
family firm and throwing the
television out his 40th floor
apartment window to smash in
the cemetery below symbolized
his rejection of the culture that
produced him. Inevitably he
would also throw his wife
(Samantha Eggar) out the
window, literally, once this
penchant for self-determination
came into full maturity.
Or, if you prefer a nihilistic
interpretation, the name for evil
could be death: a strain of
symbolism runs throughout—the
cemetery into which the TV
crashes, the great-great
grandfather's ghost and his white
horse which carries Blake to a
village hoedown which turns into
an orgy and culminates in
adultery, the loss of the
soldier-brother, and the climax of
it all in the mad murder of the
anti-hero's wife.
Undefiable Laws
I think Sherman wanted us to
get both of the latter readings. Sin

and death are inseparable. Work is
part of the same curse which
produces death; you can't defy
the laws of your own psychical
makeup (sin against your own
identity) without paying a penalty
in death. When Blake started
defying those laws, death entered
the picture: first the feeling of
death which he took for his
ancestor's ghost; the dust of death
in the old house, and the death of
his brother. But he failed to heed
its warning.
If you get that message from
"A Name for Evil," then the thing
to call it is not pretentious but
great, a brilliant first film from a
promising young filmmaker. And,
I must admit, I'm not sure the
technological inferiority in this
film and its obscurity make it
inherently inferior, in themselves,
to others similarly marked but
stamped with the brand of Svensk
Filmindustry and English
subtitles.
There's a lot missing from "A
Name for Evil,' lfeaving a lot to be
desired. The script is
unimaginative and unmoving, its
most serious flaw. There is never
enough insight to develop
intensity or character depth,
probably because the director
never decided to make the ghost
story secondary and the life and
death conflict within John Blake
primary. But still the film is worth
seeing; an audience could learn
something from it. I can only
hope it will.
I know Reed Sherman already
has.

TV RETROSPECTIVE—Art Carney (left) and Jackie Gleason enjoy a
cup of coffee in a scene from"The Honeymooners," one of the TV
shows from the 50's to be screend tonight and tomorrow at 7 and 10
at Palo Alto High, 50 Embarcadero, just off El Camino. Admission is
$1.
Twenty- eight-year-old
filmmaker Reed Sherman wanted
the reaction of the collegiate press
to his first film, "A Name for
Evil," so after it had opened at
several Bay Area locations he and
Cinerama Releasing threw a
cocktail-party screening just for
us. Sherman was introduced,
along with his film, by an old
friend who has produced and
directed about three dozen films
in as many years, and it was
apparent they really wanted a
good reaction to this film.
"Reed put his soul in hawk for
half a million dollars to make this
film," the introduction went,
"and the people at the Examiner
just don't understand it." It had
been panned in the evening paper.
Despite the free cocktails (I
don't drink anyway) and dry
roasted peanuts, not to mention
the hype, I have to say the
Examiner's reaction, seconded
next morning by the Chronicle,
was easier to understand than "A
Name for Evil." It's a pretentious
film, and maybe even just a bomb.
In fact, from a run of the mill
mass media perspective, about the
most you can give it is what the
current Playboy allows in the
opening of its coverage:
"The best thing about 'A Name
for Evil,' a recently released film
starring Robert Culp and
Samantha Eggar, is its
scenery—breath-taking mountain
country and amply exposed
anatomies."

"A Name for Evil," then the thing
to call it is not pretentious but
great, a brilliant first film from a
promising young filmmaker. And,
I must admit, I'm not sure the
technological inferiority in this
film and its obscurity make it
inherently inferior, in themselves,
to others similarly marked but
stamped with the brand of Svensk
Filmindustry and English
subtitles.
There's a lot missing from "A
Name for Evil,' lfeaving a lot to be
desired. The script is
unimaginative and unmoving, its
most serious flaw. There is never
enough insight to develop
intensity or character depth,
probably because the director
never decided to make the ghost
story secondary and the life and
death conflict within John Blake
primary. But still the film is worth
seeing; an audience could learn
something from it. I can only
hope it will.
I know Reed Sherman already
has.
