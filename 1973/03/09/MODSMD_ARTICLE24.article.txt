## TV Reruns Screened 
### 
It all started one year ago, in
Berkeley, when 2000 people,
attended a special retrospective
screening of old TV shows from
the 1950'5, including "Ozzie and
Harriet," "Burns and Allen,"
"Sergeant Bilko" and others.
The show later played at
Stanford. The TV Restrospective,
Part 11, is now back in Palo Alto
for a two night run at Palo Alto
High.
Since last year, Esquire
magazine has hailed the TV craze
in a major article on that bygone
era. Sid Caesar has re-released ten
of his old "Show of Shows" in
New York City, where they are
currently playing to packed
houses. There can be little doubt
that a groundswell has started,
and will peak to a crescendo of
viewer appreciation before long.
Television, the medium that so
many critics have said alienates
and fragments the American
people as they view programs in
the isolation of their own homes,
has at long-last done an about-face
and created a community of
cheering theater goers who now
see the tiny images of their
remembrances blown up to the
fantasy proportions of the silver
movie screen.
Part II Screened
This weekend, March 9 and 10,
Part II of the "Nostalgic
Retrospective of Classic
Television" will bescreenedat Palo
Alto High School Auditorium.
This is a completely new program
from that seen last year at
Stanford. Created by the people
who discovered the 1936 camp
classic, "Reefer Madness," this
three hour marathon consists of
complete episodes and selected
excerpts from television's golden
era.
Each piece of film has been
chosen as a representation of the
spontaneity and brilliant
situations characteristic of the
tube in those vanished days.
Original commercials are included
as a special part of each show and
are a commentary on recent
TODAY

American history, taste, and
mores.
The three solid hours of TV
classics includes the first episode
of the "Lone Ranger," Annette
Funicello with her Mouseketeer
ears, Betty on "Father Knows
Best" serving up those wholesome
flights of middle American
fantasies, and Jackie Gleason's
classically funny and poignant
creation centered in the Brooklyn
slums—"The Honeymooners"—
co-starring Art Carney.
Also to be seen are Liberace
saluting his brother George and
winking at the older ladies in the

country as he says good night, and
Ted Mack's most ridiculous act,
"The Teenagers," playing some
golden oldies with hair
slicked-down and saxophones
blaring a memory of malted milks
down at the sock-hop. All of these
characters and more, like Amos N'
Andy, Buffalo Bob Smith, Howdy
Doody and Art Baker ("You
Asked for It") are part of this
retrospective.
There will be complete shows
at 7 and 10 p.m. both Friday and
Saturday nights at Palo Alto High,
50 Embarcadero just off El
Camino. Admission is $1.
