# Stevie Wonder
## He's Still King Of Soul 
### DAN FORTE 
It's been quite a few years
since "The Twelve Year Old
Genius" first made the scene with
"Fingertips," but through the
years Stevie Wonder's popularity
has remained strong, and he has
matured into quite an artist. As
musician, singer, and composer,
Stevie Wonder has continually
been one of the top names in soul
music.
On Sunday, March 4, Stevie
appeared at The Berkeley
Community Theater, heading a
bill which also included Finnegan
and Wood. I find it hard to say
much about this band, mainly
because they're basically just like
most other rock bands: unoriginal,
uncreative, and uninteresting.
They started and finished with
watery versions of two old Bo
Didley songs, "I'm A Man" and
"You Can't Judge A Book By The
Cover." In between were a lot of
unoriginal originals, mostly
featuring the guitarist, Wood,
whose ambition, it seems, is to try

to sound exactly like Jimi
Hendrix. If I had to pick their
"best song" (and I may as well try
to), I'd have to say it was their
rendition of the late Mahalia
Jackson's "I Will Move On Up A
Little Higher."
Although the show got started
at about 8:15, it wasn't until 9:45
that Stevie Wonder's group,
Wonder Love, got into their first
number. Then Stevie was lead on
stage wearing a shiny gold suit
and bow tie.
Stevie Takes Over
After sitting at his electric
piano-synthesizer for a couple of
minutes (the music still going),
Stevie sort of felt his way over to
the drummer who got up and let
Stevie take over for awhile. Next,
Wonder picked up his harmonica
and played "For Once In My
Life.' By this time, a large part of
the sell-out audience was already
well on its way to going crazy.
After singing "If You Really
Love Me," Stevie did a very nice
version of Billy Paul's Grammy

winner, "Me and Mrs. Jones."
Wonder Love was excellent
throughout as a back-up band for
Stevie, but when they were
featured on their own (with Stevie
backing them up), they weren't
very impressive. This was partly
due to their material, and partly
because it's awfully difficult to
follow a Stevie Wonder song like
"Superwoman," even if Stevie
himself is playing piano for you.
The band showed how solid
and tight it was when Stevie did a
song he'd written only three
weeks ago called "I Think I'm On
The Right Track." This "newie"
was followed by one of Stevie's
oldies, "I Was Made To Love
Her," which was unfortunately
done in a new slowed-down
arrangement, which couldn't
compare to the fast original.
Stevie switched from slow to
fast almost every other song, but
seemed to lean toward the slower
stuff toward the end of the set,
doing "You Are The Sunshine Of
My Life" (fantastic), "Blowin' In
The Wind," and the beautiful "My
Cherie Amour."
Best Song
His best song of the night
(although they were all good) was
"Signed, Sealed, Delivered, I'm
Yours." On this one Stevie used
one of the strangest instruments
I've ever seen. It was sort of a
plastic tube microphone which
Stevie put inside his mouth, was
hooked up to a separate electric
keyboard, which was hooked up
to a synthesizer.
Stevie would sort of sing and
play the keyboard at the same
time, in different combinations.
Aside from the weird sound
effects it made, it was also very
musical.
Stevie closed the show with an
unbelievable version of his latest
hit "Superstition," bringing out
Buddy Miles on drums and a blind
guitarist whose name I couldn't
decipher. This really brought the
house down, partly because the
audience knew it would probably
be the last song of the night.
Stevie did everything
imaginable with this song. While
the band continued to play, Stevie
got up and was lead off stage
bouncing. Then he returned to
have a "drumming duel" with
Miles, in which, believe it or not,
Stevie won. Then he sang some
more and bounced off again,
while some guy threw souveniers

to the audience; 45s of
"Superstition," his new LP
Talking Book," photographs, and
yellow T-shirts which said "You
Are The Sunshine Of My Life."
(These only reached about the
sixth row, and I was,
unfortunately, about ten rows
from the stage.) The song lasted a
total of exactly 30 minutes!
Stevie's set was two hours long
in all, and every minute was
exciting. Besides being a great
musician, singer, and composer,
Stevie showed that he's a fantastic
all-around performer. Part of the
fun in watching Stevie Wonder on
stage is seeing how much he's
enjoying himself and what he's
doing up there. When a good artist
has this kind of attitude about
performing, the spirit almost
always carries over to the
audience.

Wonder Love was excellent
throughout as a back-up band for
Stevie, but when they were
featured on their own (with Stevie
backing them up), they weren't
very impressive. This was partly
due to their material, and partly
because it's awfully difficult to
follow a Stevie Wonder song like
"Superwoman," even if Stevie
himself is playing piano for you.
The band showed how solid
and tight it was when Stevie did a
song he'd written only three
weeks ago called "I Think I'm On
The Right Track." This "newie"
was followed by one of Stevie's
oldies, "I Was Made To Love
Her," which was unfortunately
done in a new slowed-down
arrangement, which couldn't
compare to the fast original.
Stevie switched from slow to
fast almost every other song, but
seemed to lean toward the slower
stuff toward the end of the set,
doing "You Are The Sunshine Of
My Life" (fantastic), "Blowin' In
The Wind," and the beautiful "My
Cherie Amour."
Best Song
His best song of the night
(although they were all good) was
"Signed, Sealed, Delivered, I'm
Yours." On this one Stevie used
one of the strangest instruments
I've ever seen. It was sort of a
plastic tube microphone which
Stevie put inside his mouth, was
hooked up to a separate electric
keyboard, which was hooked up
to a synthesizer.
Stevie would sort of sing and
play the keyboard at the same
time, in different combinations.
Aside from the weird sound
effects it made, it was also very
musical.
Stevie closed the show with an
unbelievable version of his latest
hit "Superstition," bringing out
Buddy Miles on drums and a blind
guitarist whose name I couldn't
decipher. This really brought the
house down, partly because the
audience knew it would probably
be the last song of the night.
Stevie did everything
imaginable with this song. While
the band continued to play, Stevie
got up and was lead off stage
bouncing. Then he returned to
have a "drumming duel" with
Miles, in which, believe it or not,
Stevie won. Then he sang some
more and bounced off again,
while some guy threw souveniers

to the audience; 45s of
"Superstition," his new LP
Talking Book," photographs, and
yellow T-shirts which said "You
Are The Sunshine Of My Life."
(These only reached about the
sixth row, and I was,
unfortunately, about ten rows
from the stage.) The song lasted a
total of exactly 30 minutes!
Stevie's set was two hours long
in all, and every minute was
exciting. Besides being a great
musician, singer, and composer,
Stevie showed that he's a fantastic
all-around performer. Part of the
fun in watching Stevie Wonder on
stage is seeing how much he's
enjoying himself and what he's
doing up there. When a good artist
has this kind of attitude about
performing, the spirit almost
always carries over to the
audience.

It's been quite a few years
since "The Twelve Year Old
Genius" first made the scene with
"Fingertips," but through the
years Stevie Wonder's popularity
has remained strong, and he has
matured into quite an artist. As
musician, singer, and composer,
Stevie Wonder has continually
been one of the top names in soul
music.
On Sunday, March 4, Stevie
appeared at The Berkeley
Community Theater, heading a
bill which also included Finnegan
and Wood. I find it hard to say
much about this band, mainly
because they're basically just like
most other rock bands: unoriginal,
uncreative, and uninteresting.
They started and finished with
watery versions of two old Bo
Didley songs, "I'm A Man" and
"You Can't Judge A Book By The
Cover." In between were a lot of
unoriginal originals, mostly
featuring the guitarist, Wood,
whose ambition, it seems, is to try

to sound exactly like Jimi
Hendrix. If I had to pick their
"best song" (and I may as well try
to), I'd have to say it was their
rendition of the late Mahalia
Jackson's "I Will Move On Up A
Little Higher."
Although the show got started
at about 8:15, it wasn't until 9:45
that Stevie Wonder's group,
Wonder Love, got into their first
number. Then Stevie was lead on
stage wearing a shiny gold suit
and bow tie.
Stevie Takes Over
After sitting at his electric
piano-synthesizer for a couple of
minutes (the music still going),
Stevie sort of felt his way over to
the drummer who got up and let
Stevie take over for awhile. Next,
Wonder picked up his harmonica
and played "For Once In My
Life.' By this time, a large part of
the sell-out audience was already
well on its way to going crazy.
After singing "If You Really
Love Me," Stevie did a very nice
version of Billy Paul's Grammy

winner, "Me and Mrs. Jones."
Wonder Love was excellent
throughout as a back-up band for
Stevie, but when they were

have a "drumming duel" with
Miles, in which, believe it or not,
Stevie won. Then he sang some
more and bounced off again,
while some guy threw souveniers

to the audience; 45s of
"Superstition," his new LP
Talking Book," photographs, and
yellow T-shirts which said "You
Are The Sunshine Of My Life."
(These only reached about the
sixth row, and I was,
unfortunately, about ten rows
from the stage.) The song lasted a
total of exactly 30 minutes!
Stevie's set was two hours long
in all, and every minute was
exciting. Besides being a great
musician, singer, and composer,
Stevie showed that he's a fantastic
all-around performer. Part of the
fun in watching Stevie Wonder on
stage is seeing how much he's
enjoying himself and what he's
doing up there. When a good artist
has this kind of attitude about
performing, the spirit almost
always carries over to the
audience.

It's been quite a few years
since "The Twelve Year Old
Genius" first made the scene with
"Fingertips," but through the
years Stevie Wonder's popularity
has remained strong, and he has
matured into quite an artist. As
musician, singer, and composer,
Stevie Wonder has continually
been one of the top names in soul
music.
On Sunday, March 4, Stevie
appeared at The Berkeley
Community Theater, heading a
bill which also included Finnegan
and Wood. I find it hard to say
much about this band, mainly
because they're basically just like
most other rock bands: unoriginal,
uncreative, and uninteresting.
They started and finished with
watery versions of two old Bo
Didley songs, "I'm A Man" and
"You Can't Judge A Book By The
Cover." In between were a lot of
unoriginal originals, mostly
featuring the guitarist, Wood,
whose ambition, it seems, is to try

to sound exactly like Jimi
Hendrix. If I had to pick their
"best song" (and I may as well try
to), I'd have to say it was their
rendition of the late Mahalia
Jackson's "I Will Move On Up A
Little Higher."
Although the show got started
at about 8:15, it wasn't until 9:45
that Stevie Wonder's group,
Wonder Love, got into their first
number. Then Stevie was lead on
stage wearing a shiny gold suit
and bow tie.
Stevie Takes Over
After sitting at his electric
piano-synthesizer for a couple of
minutes (the music still going),
Stevie sort of felt his way over to
the drummer who got up and let
Stevie take over for awhile. Next,
Wonder picked up his harmonica
and played "For Once In My
Life.' By this time, a large part of
the sell-out audience was already
well on its way to going crazy.
After singing "If You Really
Love Me," Stevie did a very nice
version of Billy Paul's Grammy

winner, "Me and Mrs. Jones."
Wonder Love was excellent
throughout as a back-up band for
Stevie, but when they were
featured on their own (with Stevie
backing them up), they weren't
very impressive. This was partly
due to their material, and partly
because it's awfully difficult to
follow a Stevie Wonder song like
"Superwoman," even if Stevie
himself is playing piano for you.
The band showed how solid
and tight it was when Stevie did a
song he'd written only three
weeks ago called "I Think I'm On
The Right Track." This "newie"
was followed by one of Stevie's
oldies, "I Was Made To Love
Her," which was unfortunately
done in a new slowed-down
arrangement, which couldn't
compare to the fast original.
Stevie switched from slow to
fast almost every other song, but
seemed to lean toward the slower
stuff toward the end of the set,
doing "You Are The Sunshine Of
My Life" (fantastic), "Blowin' In
The Wind," and the beautiful "My
Cherie Amour."
Best Song
His best song of the night
(although they were all good) was
"Signed, Sealed, Delivered, I'm
Yours." On this one Stevie used
one of the strangest instruments
I've ever seen. It was sort of a
plastic tube microphone which
Stevie put inside his mouth, was
hooked up to a separate electric
keyboard, which was hooked up
to a synthesizer.
Stevie would sort of sing and
play the keyboard at the same
time, in different combinations.
Aside from the weird sound
effects it made, it was also very
musical.
Stevie closed the show with an
unbelievable version of his latest
hit "Superstition," bringing out
Buddy Miles on drums and a blind
guitarist whose name I couldn't
decipher. This really brought the
house down, partly because the
audience knew it would probably
be the last song of the night.
Stevie did everything
imaginable with this song. While
the band continued to play, Stevie
got up and was lead off stage
bouncing. Then he returned to
have a "drumming duel" with
Miles, in which, believe it or not,
Stevie won. Then he sang some
more and bounced off again,
while some guy threw souveniers
