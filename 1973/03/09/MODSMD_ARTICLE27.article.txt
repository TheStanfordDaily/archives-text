# 'Genesis II' Gives TV Hope
## 
### BONNIE MacBIRD 
Remember those 11 p.m. dorm
gatherings every week night last year? The
gang would filter in, some in pyjamas, some
with books. Silence would fill the room, and
then - "Whooooosh .... These are the
voyages of the starship Enterprise. ..
By the end of the most popular shows,
twenty or more people would cram into the
tiny TV room, and a discussion would ensue
outlasting even Johnny Carson. Somehow
"Star Trek's" cancellation has left a void in
television, and now we don't even have the
reruns. Mr. Roddenberry please come back.
After more than two years of a
self-imposed vacation from television, Gene
Roddenberry has returned to his role of
creator—again with great ideas and great
energy. One of the ideas is "Genesis II," a
pilot for a new series, to be aired this month
on CBS.
And the energy was what it took
Roddenberry to get the show on the air. Once
again he has defied the static laws of
commercial broadcasting and succeeded in
bringing forth not only an entertaining show,
but one rich in thought content and high in
credibility. A rarity in television!

Like "Star Trek," "Genesis II" presents a
mind-stretching look into the future. But it
differs in that Roddenberry focuses now only
on planet Earth, and the world he describes
differs eerily from the optimistic picture
presented in "Star Trek."
The year is 2133 A.D. Civilization as we
know it has been all but destroyed during the
nuclear holocausts of The Great Conflict. The
great web of technology built by man has
disintegrated, fallen apart. Scattered over the
world are pockets of culture, groups of men
clinging to fragments of past traditions, wild
hordes of savages, Orwellian police states—all
sorts of lifestyles and experiments in living.
Dylan Hunt (played by Alex Cord) is a
NASA scientist of our own generation. The
subject of a suspended animation experiment
in the late 1970'5, he awakens to find that an
explosion occurred which trapped him in the
lab, and it is now 150 years later. But culture
shock isn't the only problem that Dylan has
to face.
It seems that there are two powerful
groups vying for access to Dylan's great
technical knowledge. The Tyranians are a race
of mutants—stronger, more intelligent, and
disdainful of humans, who are "crippled by

emotions."
Their chief adversary is a group called
PAX, composed of strange people in unisex
garb who hide in the secrecy of the Carlsbad
Caverns.
PAX controls the only advanced system of
transportation left—the massive, underground
"subshuttle" whose trains whiz down tunnels
bored by nuclear power at incredible speeds.
With Dylan s Appearance on the scene, the
plot takes off as fast, and the pace never lets
up. A tight script and believable characters
hold it together in true Roddenberry fashion.
But before the good and the bad guys are
completely sorted out by Dylan and the
audience, the hero must contend with no less
than a giant savage, a strange pleasure and
pain device, a slave uprising, two kidnappings,
a nuclear explosion, and a beautiful woman
with two navels, among other things. And yet
there's a point to it all, which Roddenberry
won't let you forget. "Genesis II" is the story
of the world's rebirth. The possibilities are
endless.
Sound incredible? It's all perfectly logical,
really. See for yourself. "Genesis II" will be
aired March 23, at 9:30 p.m. on CBS. There's
hope for television yet.

reruns. Mr. Roddenberry please come back.
After more than two years of a
self-imposed vacation from television, Gene
Roddenberry has returned to his role of
creator—again with great ideas and great
energy. One of the ideas is "Genesis II," a
pilot for a new series, to be aired this month
on CBS.
And the energy was what it took
Roddenberry to get the show on the air. Once
again he has defied the static laws of
commercial broadcasting and succeeded in
bringing forth not only an entertaining show,
but one rich in thought content and high in
credibility. A rarity in television!

Like "Star Trek," "Genesis II" presents a
mind-stretching look into the future. But it
differs in that Roddenberry focuses now only
on planet Earth, and the world he describes
differs eerily from the optimistic picture
presented in "Star Trek."
The year is 2133 A.D. Civilization as we
know it has been all but destroyed during the
nuclear holocausts of The Great Conflict. The
great web of technology built by man has
disintegrated, fallen apart. Scattered over the
world are pockets of culture, groups of men
clinging to fragments of past traditions, wild
hordes of savages, Orwellian police states—all
sorts of lifestyles and experiments in living.
Dylan Hunt (played by Alex Cord) is a
NASA scientist of our own generation. The
subject of a suspended animation experiment
in the late 1970'5, he awakens to find that an
explosion occurred which trapped him in the
lab, and it is now 150 years later. But culture
shock isn't the only problem that Dylan has
to face.
It seems that there are two powerful
groups vying for access to Dylan's great
technical knowledge. The Tyranians are a race
of mutants—stronger, more intelligent, and
disdainful of humans, who are "crippled by

emotions."
Their chief adversary is a group called
PAX, composed of strange people in unisex
garb who hide in the secrecy of the Carlsbad
Caverns.
PAX controls the only advanced system of
transportation left—the massive, underground
"subshuttle" whose trains whiz down tunnels
bored by nuclear power at incredible speeds.
With Dylan s Appearance on the scene, the
plot takes off as fast, and the pace never lets
up. A tight script and believable characters
hold it together in true Roddenberry fashion.
But before the good and the bad guys are
completely sorted out by Dylan and the
audience, the hero must contend with no less
than a giant savage, a strange pleasure and
pain device, a slave uprising, two kidnappings,
a nuclear explosion, and a beautiful woman
with two navels, among other things. And yet
there's a point to it all, which Roddenberry
won't let you forget. "Genesis II" is the story
of the world's rebirth. The possibilities are
endless.
Sound incredible? It's all perfectly logical,
really. See for yourself. "Genesis II" will be
aired March 23, at 9:30 p.m. on CBS. There's
hope for television yet.

Remember those 11 p.m. dorm
gatherings every week night last year? The
gang would filter in, some in pyjamas, some
with books. Silence would fill the room, and
then - "Whooooosh .... These are the
voyages of the starship Enterprise. ..
By the end of the most popular shows,
twenty or more people would cram into the
tiny TV room, and a discussion would ensue
outlasting even Johnny Carson. Somehow
"Star Trek's" cancellation has left a void in
television, and now we don't even have the
reruns. Mr. Roddenberry please come back.
