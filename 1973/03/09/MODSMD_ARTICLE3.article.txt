# Judge Amends Founding Grant; Women's Enrollment Limit Lifted
## 
### MARK SIMONIAN 
Santa Clara County Superior Court
has granted a Board of Trustees'
petition to amend the University's
Founding Grant to remove limitations
on women's enrollment and sectarian
worship on campus, President Richard
Lyman announced at yesterday's
meeting. â€¢ ,
Superior Court Judge Stanley M.
Evans said Wednesday that he would
change the Grant, deleting the
numerical restrictions on women's
admission and authorizing
denominational worship services in
Memorial Church.

The trustees noted in their petition
that "for many years Stanford has
administered its admissions policy at
the graduate as well as the
undergraduate level in a manner which
gives equal advantages in admissions to
both the sexes."
But the petition also stated that
"the continued presence" of an
"apparent restriction ... may be a
factor inhibiting a greater number of
qualified women from applying to the
undergraduate and graduate schools of
the University."
The Founding Grant, originally
established in 1885 by Leland
Stanford Sr., committed the
University to "afford equal facilities
and give equal advantages in the
University to both sexes," making it
one of the first major coeducational
universities.
However, following an early influx
of women students, Mrs. Leland
Stanford amended the Grant in May,
1899, to provide that "the number of
women attending the University as
students shall at no time ever exceed
500."
The male-female ratio steadily
climbed. In 1933, when about 2800
men and 500 women were enrolled,
the trustees adopted a resolution that
"the number of women students be
increased beyond 500, maintaining
substantially the same proportion"
that existed when Mrs. Stanford
amended the Founding Grant.

That ratio was approximately 60
percent men to 40 percent women.
In its petition, the Board of
Trustees indicated it would rescind its
1933 resolution and simply state that
"the ratio of men to women admitted
to the University shall be determined
by the nature of the applicant pool,
with due regard to specific University
strengths."
The University currently has 3317
women among its 11,374 students.
The trustees, asking for regularized
sectarian worship, pointed out that
various denominations have been
allowed to hold regularly-scheduled
services in Memorial Church since

1966 on an experimental basis in
addition to the weekly
nondenominational Sunday services.
Senate action yesterday included
approval of a recommendation from
the Committee on Academic Appraisal
and Achievement (C-AAA) on revision
of the University pass-fail grading
system.
The change provides that "+" will
denote "pass" in a class where the
student has chosen the option and that
"P" will denote "pass" when the
instructor decides that he will give no
marks except pass-fail to the entire
class.
