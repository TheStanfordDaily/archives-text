# JV Cagers Host Tough Cal Squad

### MARK WHITE 
Stanford completes its 1973
JV basketball season tonight when
the Cards take on "one of the two
best junior varsity basketball
teams in Northern California," the
California Bears, at 6 p.m. in
Maples Pavilion.
Assistant coach Bob Nicholson
had those and other kind words
for the Cal team in appraising the
Cards chances against the team
which beat them 77-62 on
February 3. "Cal gave us a lot of
trouble when we let them take
control of the game last month,"
explained Nicholson, "and to beat
them tonight we will not only
need to score, but we'll have to
play intelligently also."
In the first game Cal struggled
to a 31-26 halftime lead before
bombing Stanford with 17
straight second-half points that
put the game out of reach. Cal
guard Bob Hagler led his team
with 16 points, 7 assists, and some
harassing defense in that game.
Stocky, 6-8 postman Eric Vaaler
complimented Hagler on the
boards with 12 rebounds and
dominant play in the key.
Ed Schweitzer played his usual
strong game against the Bears in
February, scoring 24 points and
grabbing 15 rebounds, but the
Cardinal postman got little help
from the other members of the

team. Marty Moroski was the only
other Card who could hit from
outside in that game, and his eight
points weren't enough to back up
Schweitzer.
Since their last meeting with
Cal, the Cards have improved in
several aspects of their game and
this is reflected in the 8-1 record
they have chalked up since then.
Moroski, Rich Wohlstadter and
Kevin Enright have all found the
range from outside and each is
averaging nine points a game in
supplementing Schweitzer's 19
point average.
Cal will thus be facing a better
team tonight and if the Cards
shoot at their usual 52 percent
clip and manage to hold their own
on the boards, it should be an
exciting finale to a good Cardinal
season.

THE BIG HOOK â€” This hook shot by Rich Kelley against UCLA last
weekend was his first of the season. According to widely circulating
rumors, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar of the Milwaukee Bucks plans to work
on his hook so that it more closely resembles Kelley's flawless form.
