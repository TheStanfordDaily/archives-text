# Cards Seek 14th Victory
## Stanford, Cal Clash In Season Finale 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
The shape of the ball may be
different, but it will still be a "Big
Game" tonight when Stanford
closes out its most successful
basketball season in six years
against California at Maples
Pavilion.
The Cards assured themselves
of their first winning season since
1967 last weekend with a 50-47
victory over USC at the Los
Angeles Sports Arena. Stanford's
record now stands at 13-11, but
Coach Howie Dallmar's cagers
need a victory tonight to even
their Pac-8 mark at 7-7.
"As far as Cal is concerned,
ending the season with a win

means a lot to us right now,"
Dallmar said. "All but two of our
players (Bob Buell and Pat Rusco)
will be back next year, and the
way you end one season probably
has something to do with how
you start the next one."
Of course if it weren't for some
costly second half turnovers last
Saturday at Pauley Pavilion,
thoughts of next season would
never have entered Dallmar's
mind. The Cards held a 25-18
halftime lead over UCLA, but the
nation's number one team took
advantage of Stanford's second
half miscues and recorded a 51-45
victory, its 70th straight in a three
year winning streak.
Disappointing Loss
"Everyone has been praising us
for coming so close to beating the
Bruins," Dallmar said, "but it was
actually very disappointing. We
controlled the tempo in the first
half with selected shooting and we
hit 50 percent to lead by seven.
"To beat UCLA you have to
figure out some way to spend
more time on offense than
defense, and that's what we were
able to do. We got them into a
zone in the second half, but the
shooting touch left us a little
bit... and that was it."
Assistant coach Bub Bowling is
still losing sleep over referee
Charles Reed's call which allowed
an obvious dunk by Larry Farmer
early in the second half. That play
brought the Bruins within one
point and definitely swung the
momentum in UCLA's favor.
Tonight's game against Cal will
present a different set of problems
as the Cards try to improve on
their 8-3 record at Maples. Cal is
4-9 in the league and 11-14 overall
but the Bears frustrated the Cards
for 30 minutes in the first game
between the two teams before
Stanford came back for a 73-68
win at Berkeley. If the Cards win
tonight, it will be the first time
since 1965 that Stanford has

swept its two game series against
the Bears.
Walking Wounded
Forward Dave Frost is
definitely out for tonight and
Dallmar lists three other key
players as "questionable." Frost
sat out last weekend's games with
a sprained ankle and this week the
ankle was placed in a cast. Mel
Arterberry suffered a bruised hip
in the UCLA game, Scott Trobbe
pulled a leg muscle in practice
Tuesday, and Pat Rusco has been
bothered by a bad back.
Arterberry, Trobbe, and Rusco
will all dress tonight, but Dallmar
won't determine his starting
lineup until just before game time.

Center Rich Kelley, forward Mike
Mann, and guard Mark Gilberg
should start but the remaining
two spots will be determined by
the injury situation.
Cal Coach Dick Edwards lists a
tentative starting lineup of
forwards Brady Allen (6-4) and
John Coughran (6-6), center Carl
Meier (6-8), and guards Rickie
Hawthorne (6-3) and Vance
Schram (6-3). Coughran,
Hawthorne, Allen, and Meier are
all averaging in double figures.
"Cal is a muscle team inside,"
Dallmar said. "Hawthorne is an
outstanding freshman — he's very
explosive — and Allen is getting
better and better."

Kelley became the seventh
player in Stanford history to join
the mythical "400 Point Club"
with 20 points last weekend in
Los Angeles. Kelley now has 409
points for the season, and his 17.0
scoring average and 13.4
rebounding mark sit impressively
atop the Cardinal statistics.
Mann is second in both scoring
and rebounding while Frost,
Arterberry and Buell are next in
the scoring column.
Coughran leads the Bears in
scoring with a 15.1 average and
also tops the rebounding list with
over nine a game. Hawthorne is
next in scoring with a 14.5
average.
