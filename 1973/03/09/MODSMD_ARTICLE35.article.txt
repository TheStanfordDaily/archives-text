# Lola Predicts
## 
### 
Some people say that like
wine and cheese, women get
better with age. Lola is
definitely an exception to
this rule. The Daily's mystic
would have trouble predicting
the sunrise, let alone the
outcome of a Pac-8 basketball
contest. Lola started out
strong, but for the second
weekend this season managed
only four correct predictions
in eight games.
The Pac-8 conference
season draws to a dose this
weekend, and if Oregon State
can defeat Oregon in Eugene
tonight, Stanford can end the
year in a three-way tie for
third with a win over Cat.
With the aid of a coin toss
and a rabbit's foot, Lola has
issued these predictions:
Stanford 79 - Cat 66
Oregon 76 - OSU 71
Washington 69 - WSU 60
UCLA 87 - USC 71
