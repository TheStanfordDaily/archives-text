# Ruggers Need Miracle To Capture Scrum Axe
## 
### PETE BHATIA 
Stanford's rugby team meets
California again this Saturday in
Berkeley to determine the winner
of the Scrum Axe. Last weekend
the Bears bombed the Cards 18-3
and made themselves what
amounts to a fifteen point
favorite to retain the axe.
The winner is determined by
the combined score in the two
encounters. Unfortunately for the
Cards, no team has ever overcome
such a margin in the twelve year

history of the Scrum Axe series.
Both teaifcs will go with their
usual lineups Saturday with
Stanford's hopes resting on the
experience of first siders' Tom
Klein and Craig Zaltosky. The
Bears sport a powerful lineup led
by Loren Toews and Bill
Armstrong. Fourteen different
players have scored this season for
the Bears, who have yet to lose a
game in nine encounters.
In last week's game, Stanford's
only score came on a 38 yard
penalty kick by Bob Hurtenstein.
It was bad day overall for the
kickers on the muddy field,
however, as Cal's star placekicker
Terry Buchanan (he has 55 points
on the season), was held scoreless.
Cal Coach, Doc Hudson, said
every effort was being made to
keep the game in the Cal stadium
and said that only a violent storm
would necessitate a change of site.
The annual Monterey Rugby
Tournament awaits the Cards
following finals on March 24 and
25. Prior to last year, Stanford
had won the tourney four years in
a row.
