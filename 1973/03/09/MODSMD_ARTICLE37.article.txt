# Thoughts From The Bench
## Bob Buell—A Doctor's Dream 
### Stan Wilson 
Bob Buell is probably the only guy I know who
could hurt himself putting on his tennis shoes
before a game. The 6-5 senior eager, who splits his
time between the training room and the basketball
court, will close out his career tonight against Cal, a
career which has been considerably shortened by
injuries.
"I'm a 6-5 skinny man trying to play forward in
the Pac-8," Buell explained, adjusting a bandage on
his right knee. "People just try to hurt me," he said.
I asked him to list his injuries, and the list was
impressive. High school, senior year — Bob played in
only nine games, sidelined two thirds of the season
with a badly damaged knee that required surgery.
The cartilage was torn, and he has no ligaments in
his left knee.
College, freshman year — he reinjured his knee, as
well as contracting mono, allowing him to play in
only three games all season. Sophomore year — Bob
spent three weeks with his right ankle in a cast. That
summer he added a back injury to his ever-growing
list. Junior year — Bob broke his nose at the
beginning of the season, but played with a mask for
protection.
The mask made him one of the most distinctive
players in the league. At the end of the season he
hurt his knee again.
"The most disappointing thing for everyone is
that Bob has not played a full season without an
injury," said assistant coach Bub Bowling.
Almost Made It
Everyone hoped that this year might be the year,
and he nearly made it. But a couple of weeks ago
Bob was cracked in the face by an unidentified
elbow in the Oregon game. His cheek bone was
broken, but he hasn't missed any games as a result
of the accident, though his face is still numb.
The injuries definitely "slowed him down,"
according to Bowling. "But Bob has not always
been hurt," he added. "He played remarkably well
for us for three years."
Bowling cited Buell's "quickness and
anticipation, good basketball sense, and leadership,"
as liis strengths. The team also recognized his
leadership abilities, electing him captain before the

win over Cal a month ago.
"Splitting my playing time between guard and
forward has definitely hurt me," Buell said. "It's
been really hard for me to assume the team
leadership role moving from forward to guard."
Another difficulty this season has been playing with
so many sophomores. But the young team is
guaranteed its first winning season in five years with
a 13-11 record, and Bob believes that they'll be
better next year.
May Coach
He may be around next year to see just how well
they do. Though he has enough units to graduate,
the Human Biology major plans to get a teaching
credential, and would eventually like to go into
coaching.
"I was thinking about being a coach, but after
last night..." Last night Buell's 'A' team, Theta
Delta Chi, lost the intramural basketball
championship to Kappa Alpha, 46-45. Buell wasn't
too happy about the outcome, and I think it would
be fair to say that he was less than thrilled about the
officiating. Still, the three teams that Bob coached
compiled an impressive 20-4 record this season.
Buell explained that he has "mixed emotions"
about his own basketball career. "Even though I
missed out on some things, I'm glad I had the
experience of playing basketball."
His biggest cage challenge came two seasons ago
when he was forced to guard Villanova's
All-American Howard Porter. "That guy was 6-8 —
I'm 6-5 and skinny. Still, I held Howard down to 15
points over his average, around 30 points."
Stanford basketball has gone from a losing
program to a winning proposition, and I'm
convinced that a good share of the credit must go to
Buell, who has led the team despite playing with
every kind of injury imaginable.
Buell is convinced that the team's record will
improve. "But they'll miss me a lot," Bob added
with a smile.
I decided to check this out with teammate Steve
Shupe. "Bob who?" he asked. How soon they
forget.
