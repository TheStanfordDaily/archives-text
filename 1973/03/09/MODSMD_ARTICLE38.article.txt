# Sunny Skies -Maybe Greet Baseball Team

### SCOTT DAILEY 
Baseball coach Ray Young
should be delirious over today's
forecast for warm and sunny
weather. His ball club, 11-3 on the
year, has been rained out 14 times
this season.
The latest scheduling casualty
was yesterday's game at Santa
Clara, which will be made up in a
double-header today at Sunken
Diamond, starting at 1:30 p.m.
Wednesday Glen Johnson smashed
a 400-foot home run over the
leftfield fence to give the Cards a
10 inning, 1-0 victory over San
Jose State.
Coach Young is still undecided
on his starting pitchers today, but
has indicated he will probably go
with A 1 Arthur and Dan Shaw
against the Broncos, and send Ken
Grolle and either Nick Peterson or
Mike Higgins to the mount in
tomorrow's doubleheader against
Fresno State.
Instead of playing Santa Clara
yesterday, Coach Young, pitcher
Bob DiPietro, and a few of their
henchmen took on the task of
mopping up the infield at Sunken
Diamond, which seems to be
suffering from the illusion that it
is a water table for the southern
Peninsula.
Throwing towels on a wet and
muddy spot on the left side of the
infield, Coach Young pointed out
the disadvantage of the shortstop
having to gasp for air as he
surfaced from the muddy water.
Stanford's new shortstop,

freshman Steve Davis, had no
trouble with the infield
Wednesday. Filling in for Kim
Hannaford, who was moved to
third base, Davis played errorless
ball and collected a single in four
trips to the plate.
"Having Davis in the lineup
makes us a stronger defensive
team," Young said adding that
third baseman A 1 O'Brien would
see more action when his sore
shoulder begins to feel better.
"We can always use his bat in the
lineup."
The big bat Wednesday
belonged to centerfielder Johnson
who smashed a mammoth home
run to left field that sailed high
over the wooden fence around
Sunken Diamond. Johnson's
homer gave Bob DiPietro his
second win of the season.
DiPietro, who went the
distance to gain the shutout
victory, was saved in the ninth
inning by a fine double play by
Kim Hannaford. With one out and
the bases loaded, Tom Elliot hit a
ground ball to third. Hannaford
scooped it up, tagged San Jose
outfielder Dan Mays coming down
from second, and rifled the throw
to Mike Lucich at first base to nail
Elliot and end the inning.
The action today and
tomorrow could be no less
harrowing. Three weeks ago,
Stanford edged Santa Clara, 3-2,
in 11 innings, and sneaked past
Fresno State, 3-1 in the first game
of a doubleheader, and 2-1 in the
10-inning nightcap.

Fresno State, 3-1 in the first game
of a doubleheader, and 2-1 in the
10-inning nightcap.

THE MASKED MAN-Bob Buell, shown here shooting against
Houston in last year's season opener, will close out an injury-ridden
career tonight against California. The face mask in this picture
protected a broken nose, but the senior captain also has knee, ankle,
back, and cheekbone injuries to his credit in three years of varsity
basketball.
Baseball coach Ray Young
should be delirious over today's
forecast for warm and sunny
weather. His ball club, 11-3 on the
year, has been rained out 14 times
this season.
The latest scheduling casualty
was yesterday's game at Santa
Clara, which will be made up in a
double-header today at Sunken
Diamond, starting at 1:30 p.m.
Wednesday Glen Johnson smashed
a 400-foot home run over the
leftfield fence to give the Cards a
10 inning, 1-0 victory over San
Jose State.
Coach Young is still undecided
on his starting pitchers today, but
has indicated he will probably go
with A 1 Arthur and Dan Shaw
against the Broncos, and send Ken
Grolle and either Nick Peterson or
Mike Higgins to the mount in
tomorrow's doubleheader against
Fresno State.
Instead of playing Santa Clara
yesterday, Coach Young, pitcher
Bob DiPietro, and a few of their
henchmen took on the task of
mopping up the infield at Sunken
Diamond, which seems to be
suffering from the illusion that it
is a water table for the southern
Peninsula.
Throwing towels on a wet and
muddy spot on the left side of the
infield, Coach Young pointed out
the disadvantage of the shortstop
having to gasp for air as he
surfaced from the muddy water.
Stanford's new shortstop,

freshman Steve Davis, had no
trouble with the infield
Wednesday. Filling in for Kim
Hannaford, who was moved to
third base, Davis played errorless
ball and collected a single in four
trips to the plate.
"Having Davis in the lineup
makes us a stronger defensive
team," Young said adding that
third baseman A 1 O'Brien would
see more action when his sore
shoulder begins to feel better.
"We can always use his bat in the
lineup."
The big bat Wednesday
belonged to centerfielder Johnson
who smashed a mammoth home
run to left field that sailed high
over the wooden fence around
Sunken Diamond. Johnson's
homer gave Bob DiPietro his
second win of the season.
DiPietro, who went the
distance to gain the shutout
victory, was saved in the ninth
inning by a fine double play by
Kim Hannaford. With one out and
the bases loaded, Tom Elliot hit a
ground ball to third. Hannaford
scooped it up, tagged San Jose
outfielder Dan Mays coming down
from second, and rifled the throw
to Mike Lucich at first base to nail
Elliot and end the inning.
The action today and
tomorrow could be no less
harrowing. Three weeks ago,
Stanford edged Santa Clara, 3-2,
in 11 innings, and sneaked past
Fresno State, 3-1 in the first game
of a doubleheader, and 2-1 in the
10-inning nightcap.
