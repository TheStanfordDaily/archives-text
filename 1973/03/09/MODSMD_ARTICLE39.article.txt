# Hug, Anderson, Miyamoto Out
## Gymnasts Meet California 
### PHIL HUBBARD 
It was just a few weeks ago that
a young strong Stanford
gymnastics team came within a
point of upsetting Southern
Illinois, the NCAA champion in
1972. The Cards were in top
contention for the Pac-8 title
then, and were anxious for a crack
at the 1973 national
championship.
Since that time a series of
disasters has hit the squad which
has virtually destroyed its chances
for a championship of any kind
this season. "We're going to have a
lot of trouble the rest of this
year," said Coach Sadao Hamada.
His team will certainly have
trouble tonight when the Cards
meet an outstanding Cal team in
Berkeley at 8 p.m.
In the last two weeks the squad
has lost Olympian Steve Hug at
least for tonight's meet, Ted
Miyamoto for the rest of the
season, and Bob Anderson
perhaps for good. All three were
all-around performers.
Hug, whose back has been
giving him trouble for quite
awhile off and on, reinjured it to
the point where Hamada feels it
would be unwise to have him
compete this week and perhaps
worsen his condition. Miyamoto
had a severe injury to his bicep
and was in surgery last weekend.
Anderson Quits
Anderson, who had been having
an excellent season after an early
injury, decided to drop the sport
last week. "He was pushed too
hard in high school," Hamada
explained, "and never had a
chance to enjoy gymnastics. I feel
very, very sorry to lose him."
The coach expressed hope that
the young star might return," but
I'm not going to try to push him
back into the team. He won't
come back unless he really wants
to." Anderson said he left the
squad for "personal and
psychological reasons."

With the loss of those three
stars, the outlook for the meet
against Cal tonight is pretty bleak.
"There's no way we can win that
meet," Hamada said, "I don't
even have three guys to go on the
highbar." Since the top three
score in each event, that means
the Cards will be giving up about
eight points in that event alone.
Still, Hamada says he will be
going all out with the performers
he has. Hector Neff and Leo
Hollberg will be going in the
all-around, along with possibly
John White in everything but the
high bar.
Marcy Seeks Perfection
Howard Bessen and George
Negrete should score high on the
rings. Shawn Skerrett will lead the
vaulters and will also go in other
events. Ted Marcy will be trying

to get closer to a perfect 10.0 on
the side horse.
Although Cal has lost to both
Southern Illinois and Washington
this year, the Bears have been the
number one team in the
conference the past four seasons.
Their squad was made even
stronger this year with the
addition of Tom Weeden, the
nation's premier high school
gymnast in 1972.
Cal has never lost to Stanford
in gymnastics, and it looks as if
the string of victories will
continue through '73.
Nevertheless, Hamada feels that
the Cards still have an outside
shot at the Pac-8 championship
later this month. "Our specialists
are doing well, and with Steve and
Hector, and maybe Leo in the
all-around, we aren't out of it
yet."

the key performers tonight when the Cardinal gymnasts travel to
Berkeley for a meet against California. Marcy has consistently scored
in the 9.5 range on his specialty this season.

contention for the Pac-8 title
then, and were anxious for a crack
at the 1973 national
championship.
Since that time a series of
disasters has hit the squad which
has virtually destroyed its chances
for a championship of any kind
this season. "We're going to have a
lot of trouble the rest of this
year," said Coach Sadao Hamada.
His team will certainly have
trouble tonight when the Cards
meet an outstanding Cal team in
Berkeley at 8 p.m.
In the last two weeks the squad
has lost Olympian Steve Hug at
least for tonight's meet, Ted
Miyamoto for the rest of the
season, and Bob Anderson
perhaps for good. All three were
all-around performers.
Hug, whose back has been
giving him trouble for quite
awhile off and on, reinjured it to
the point where Hamada feels it
would be unwise to have him
compete this week and perhaps
worsen his condition. Miyamoto
had a severe injury to his bicep
and was in surgery last weekend.
Anderson Quits
Anderson, who had been having
an excellent season after an early
injury, decided to drop the sport
last week. "He was pushed too
hard in high school," Hamada
explained, "and never had a
chance to enjoy gymnastics. I feel
very, very sorry to lose him."
The coach expressed hope that
the young star might return," but
I'm not going to try to push him
back into the team. He won't
come back unless he really wants
to." Anderson said he left the
squad for "personal and
psychological reasons."

With the loss of those three
stars, the outlook for the meet
against Cal tonight is pretty bleak.
"There's no way we can win that
meet," Hamada said, "I don't
even have three guys to go on the
highbar." Since the top three
score in each event, that means
the Cards will be giving up about
eight points in that event alone.
Still, Hamada says he will be
going all out with the performers
he has. Hector Neff and Leo
Hollberg will be going in the
all-around, along with possibly
John White in everything but the
high bar.
Marcy Seeks Perfection
Howard Bessen and George
Negrete should score high on the
rings. Shawn Skerrett will lead the
vaulters and will also go in other
events. Ted Marcy will be trying

to get closer to a perfect 10.0 on
the side horse.
Although Cal has lost to both
Southern Illinois and Washington
this year, the Bears have been the
number one team in the
conference the past four seasons.
Their squad was made even
stronger this year with the
addition of Tom Weeden, the
nation's premier high school
gymnast in 1972.
Cal has never lost to Stanford
in gymnastics, and it looks as if
the string of victories will
continue through '73.
Nevertheless, Hamada feels that
the Cards still have an outside
shot at the Pac-8 championship
later this month. "Our specialists
are doing well, and with Steve and
Hector, and maybe Leo in the
all-around, we aren't out of it
yet."
