# SCOPE Conference Considered 'Success'
## 
### JANET SANDERS 
Members of the Stanford
Committee on Political Education
(SCOPE) all agree that their four-day
conference on "Might v. Right in
America" held two weeks ago was a
success, but a few expressed their
disappointment over the low turnout
at some of the lectures.
Through the conference, SCOPE,
formed from the remnants of the
McGovern campaign, hoped to "turn
people's attention to the war at home
as the Vietnam War ends," said Kevin
O'Grady, a SCOPE member. The
conference's speakers, including such
well-known figures as Ramsey Clark
and Daniel Ellsberg, were extensively
critical of the Nixon's administration's
stand on civil liberties.
"Overall, the conference was a
success," said Kevin Smith, another
SCOPE member. "We just did not
reach the number of people I hoped
we would reach." He said the small
audience at a couple of speeches
confirmed his suspicions of growing
student political apathy on campus.
"Last year, Memorial Auditorium
would have been packed to hear
Ramsey Clark," Smith said. Clark's
Wednesday night speech drew a crowd
of 700, less than half of the
auditorium's capacity.
All SCOPE members were
disappointed in the turnout for the
third night of the conference. Only
150 people came to hear speakers
Frank Donner and Paul Halvonik in
Cubberley Auditorium.
"I felt partially redeemed by
Ellsberg's audience of 1600 people,"
said Smith. But he still maintained his
pessimistic feeling that "nobody seems
to be terribly concerned anymore."
SCOPE member Wayne Moore
labelled frustration as the primary
cause for student apathy. "People feel
like they haven't accomplished
anything," he said.

Smith contended that "the last
vestiges of movement activity were last
year, although it might surface again."
In the meantime, he said SCOPE aims
to "wake people up and get them
excited again."
O'Grady was not as pessimistic as
Smith. Although he admitted "we're
definitely on a downward swing in
political activity, there's still a lot of
people around who care."
Although O'Grady was also slightly
disappointed in the low attendance on
some nights, he said, "It is asking quite
a bit to go to four nights of speeches."
O'Grady cited the major problem of
the conference as "a lack of follow-up
on the speeches. We should have had
more discussions and workshops
afterwards." Moore agreed that there
should have been more emphasis on
feedback from the audience.
The conference cost SCOPE $3,865.
The ASSU Speaker's Bureau,
University Lecture Committee and
private donations helped cover the
expenses, but SCOPE is still $300 in
debt. "We were and still are in
financial straits," said O'Grady.
There was no honorarium charged
for Clark's appearance, but SCOPE
helped pay for the former U.S.
Attorney General's transportation
from the East Coast. The 50-cent
admission charge at Clark's speech
partially covered this expense.
Although SCOPE has no definite
programs planned for the future,
members told of several possibilities.
SCOPE might help the ASSU with a
benefit rock concert starring Judy
Collins and Pete Seeger for the Bach
Mai Hospital fund. "We might bring in
speakers from the National Lawyer's
Guild and free clinics to talk about
careers for social change," said Moore.
"We're trying to catch students'
interest," said Smith. "To do that, we
have to try a number of things."
