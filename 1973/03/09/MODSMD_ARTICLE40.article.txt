# Netmen Face San Jose State
## 
### 
The Stanford tennis team will
play its final match of the quarter
today when it takes on San Jose
State, beginning at 2:30 in San
Jose.
Coach Dick Gould is confident
enough of a victory that he is
starting with the fifth man in his
lineup against the Spartans,
generally considered the third best
team in Northern California
behind Stanford and Cal.
Freshman Pat DuPre, just back
from a fine showing in the East,
will play first singles. He will be
followed by Chip Fisher, Paul
Sidone, Mark Mitchell, Craig
Johnson, and Jake Warde, in that
order.
Fisher and Sidone will play first
doubles, with Mitchell and DuPre
playing second and Warde and
Johnson at third.
Following today's meet, the
Cardinals will not play again until
March 31 at Santa Barbara, after
which the spring dual meet season
begins in earnest.
It is hoped that by then
Ail-American Chico Hagey will be
sufficiently recovered from his
broken ankle to rejoin the team.
Hagey, who has been working out
more and more recently, is still
having difficulties moving and a
return to his 1972 form appears
to be at least a month away.
