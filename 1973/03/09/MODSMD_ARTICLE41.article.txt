## KA's Capture IM Cage Crown 
### JIM WASCHER 
Withstanding a last-minute onslaught led by 6-6
forward Dan Broderick, Kappa Alpha edged Theta
Delta Chi 46-45 to win the A division championship
in intramural basketball Wednesday night.
A balanced offense seemed to be the key for the
KA's, who dominated the closely-fought game from
the opening tip-off. Swingman Bruce Menser, guard
Steve Murray, and forward George Giokaris each
scored 10 points for the winners.
Guard A 1 Christoff added eight and forward
Randy Raines put in six more. Scott Stillinger
scored the remaining two KA points.
Trailing 27-19 at the half, the Theta Delts
exploded when Menser got into foul trouble late in
the game. Broderick poured in 15 points during the
period and the Theta Delts took a 41-40 lead with
1:57 remaining. But the KAs recovered the lead
with 26 seconds to go and held on.
A tight Kappa Alpha defense stymied the Theta
Delts, who had scored an upset victory over
first-seeded Nickel Bag Tuesday to advance to the
finals. The KAs held post man Terry Winsor to 10
points, while Jim Bishop scored five. Marc Allyn

and Bob Sweeney rounded out the Theta Delt
scoring with three and two points, respectively.
In the B division championships, a 16 point
performance by 6-0 guard Stan Wilson led The
Stanford Daily to a 39-32, come-from-behind win
over Rinconada '69.
Although 6-7 forward Charlie Hoffman and 6-6
center John Vercelli dominated the boards, the
Daily trailed a faster Rinconada team 22-18 at the
half. Rinc play maker Jim Aimes fed Charles Hoyt
for most of Hoyt's 17 points before fouling out late
in the game.
With Wilson shooting amazingly well from
outside and Vercelli racking up 13 points, mainly
from inside, the Daily team pulled ahead to stay
with about six minutes remaining. Hoffman and
guard Buz Battle each added four points, while
forward Don Tollefson scored two.
For Rinconada, Aimes scored four, Don Hunt
put in nine, and Gordon Kritzer hit for the
remaining two points.

exploded when Menser got into foul trouble late in
the game. Broderick poured in 15 points during the
period and the Theta Delts took a 41-40 lead with
1:57 remaining. But the KAs recovered the lead
with 26 seconds to go and held on.
A tight Kappa Alpha defense stymied the Theta
Delts, who had scored an upset victory over
first-seeded Nickel Bag Tuesday to advance to the
finals. The KAs held post man Terry Winsor to 10
points, while Jim Bishop scored five. Marc Allyn

and Bob Sweeney rounded out the Theta Delt
scoring with three and two points, respectively.
In the B division championships, a 16 point
performance by 6-0 guard Stan Wilson led The
Stanford Daily to a 39-32, come-from-behind win
over Rinconada '69.
Although 6-7 forward Charlie Hoffman and 6-6
center John Vercelli dominated the boards, the
Daily trailed a faster Rinconada team 22-18 at the
half. Rinc play maker Jim Aimes fed Charles Hoyt
for most of Hoyt's 17 points before fouling out late
in the game.
With Wilson shooting amazingly well from
outside and Vercelli racking up 13 points, mainly
from inside, the Daily team pulled ahead to stay
with about six minutes remaining. Hoffman and
guard Buz Battle each added four points, while
forward Don Tollefson scored two.
For Rinconada, Aimes scored four, Don Hunt
put in nine, and Gordon Kritzer hit for the
remaining two points.
