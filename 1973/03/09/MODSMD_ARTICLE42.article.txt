# Spikers Face Talented SJS In Unpredictable Track Duel
## 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
If pre-meet records are any
indication, Saturday's
Stanford-San Jose State track
meet should be one of the most
exciting of the year.
The Cardinals will be slight
underdogs when the pole vault
and long jump begin at 1:15 p.m.
in Stanford Stadium. The gun for
the first running event will be shot
at 1:45 p.m.
According to Coach Pay ton
Jordan, "we're just hoping to get
it down to the mile relay, the last
event, with a chance to win. We'll
be giving away an awful lot of
points in some events (pole vault
and high jump) so we'll have to
work hard in others."
If Stanford is to have any
chance of winning the meet, the
first event, the 440 relay, will be
crucial. Here the Cards will enter
Ken Curl, John Kessel, Dave
Bagshaw, and John Anderson,
whose best time is 41.7, against a
Spartan team with a peak mark of
42.0. SJS has won the coin flip
for the inside lane, so a good race
should be expected.
In the two individual sprint
events, San Jose State should
dominate except for any points
Curl and possibly Anderson are
able to pick up.
Anderson has run the best time

this year in the 440 among all
entrants in the meet, but two
Spartan runners, Tom Sprink and
Dennis Maas, have better lifetime
bests, indicating a close race.
Distance Runs
The 880 should be won by
SJS's Glenn Harmatz. Stanford
star Brian Mittelstaedt should dual
SJS's Mark Schilling for the
one-mile crown, and he and Tony
Sandoval, if they both run, should
dominate the two-mile.
Sandoval, only a freshman, last
week set the school two-mile
frosh record with a 9:01.6 in
Stanford's first meet, a 128-31
win over Fresno State.
"Tony would like to break
nine minutes this weekend,"
distance Coach Marshall Clark
says."I think he'll go out a little
faster this week. Whether Brian
will run will depend on how much
effort he puts out in the one
mile."
In the non-scoring 3000 meter
steeplechase, both Kurt
Schoenrock and Dick Day will try
to improve on excellent opening
performances last week.
Hurdles Unpredictable
In the 120 yard high hurdles,
once again, the best lifetime times
are owned by SJS athletes but
Stanford's Dave Bagshaw holds
the best time of the 1973
campaign.
The 440 intermediate hurdles
should be won by the home team,
as freshman Matt Hogsett
recorded a 53.0 time last week,
good enough to qualify him for
the Pac-8 meet the first time he
ever competed in the event.
If Stanford can stay within
striking distance, the Cards should
be able to win the final event, the
mile relay, and thus capture the
meet. Hogsett, Kessel, Bagshaw,
and Anderson will probably be
the Cardinal lineup.
SJS Should Sweep
In the field events, things may
not go so well. Stanford does not
have one high jumper within four
inches of any of the Spartans' top
three in that event, and the Cards
will also be fortunate if they can
avoid being shut out in the pole
vault. ♦
However, Stanford has definite
prospects in the shot put, where

freshman Terry Albritton, who
holds the Stanford freshman
record with a lifetime best of
57' l is the heavy favorite.
The javelin throw may be won
by the Cards' Steve Hopkins, with
SJS's Rick Rhoads pushing him.
Stanford's Jim Howard will be
favored in the discus throw.
In none of these three events,
however, does a clean sweep for
the home team look likely. The
two remaining events, the long
jump and triple jump, are risky to
predict because top SJS
performers have not competed yet
this year.
Kenny Kring and Tom
Anderson are the Cards' long
jump hopes. Due to eligibility
questions, it is not quite certain
who Stanford's triple jumpers will
be.
In the series for the Santa Clara
County championship, San Jose
State leads 12-8, as this is one of
the Spartans' top sports. The last
time the two teams met, in 1971,
Stanford took an exciting 77-68
decision.
The Cards will take a two week
break for finals following
tomorrow's meet before returning
to action on March 24 at the
Easter relays in Santa Barbara.

Stanford's first meet, a 128-31
win over Fresno State.
"Tony would like to break
nine minutes this weekend,"
distance Coach Marshall Clark
says."I think he'll go out a little
faster this week. Whether Brian
will run will depend on how much
effort he puts out in the one
mile."
In the non-scoring 3000 meter
steeplechase, both Kurt
Schoenrock and Dick Day will try
to improve on excellent opening
performances last week.
Hurdles Unpredictable
In the 120 yard high hurdles,
once again, the best lifetime times
are owned by SJS athletes but
Stanford's Dave Bagshaw holds
the best time of the 1973
campaign.
The 440 intermediate hurdles
should be won by the home team,
as freshman Matt Hogsett
recorded a 53.0 time last week,
good enough to qualify him for
the Pac-8 meet the first time he
ever competed in the event.
If Stanford can stay within
striking distance, the Cards should
be able to win the final event, the
mile relay, and thus capture the
meet. Hogsett, Kessel, Bagshaw,
and Anderson will probably be
the Cardinal lineup.
SJS Should Sweep
In the field events, things may
not go so well. Stanford does not
have one high jumper within four
inches of any of the Spartans' top
three in that event, and the Cards
will also be fortunate if they can
avoid being shut out in the pole
vault. ♦
However, Stanford has definite
prospects in the shot put, where

freshman Terry Albritton, who
holds the Stanford freshman
record with a lifetime best of
57' l is the heavy favorite.
The javelin throw may be won
by the Cards' Steve Hopkins, with
SJS's Rick Rhoads pushing him.
Stanford's Jim Howard will be
favored in the discus throw.
In none of these three events,
however, does a clean sweep for
the home team look likely. The
two remaining events, the long
jump and triple jump, are risky to
predict because top SJS
performers have not competed yet
this year.
Kenny Kring and Tom
Anderson are the Cards' long
jump hopes. Due to eligibility
questions, it is not quite certain
who Stanford's triple jumpers will
be.
In the series for the Santa Clara
County championship, San Jose
State leads 12-8, as this is one of
the Spartans' top sports. The last
time the two teams met, in 1971,
Stanford took an exciting 77-68
decision.
The Cards will take a two week
break for finals following
tomorrow's meet before returning
to action on March 24 at the
Easter relays in Santa Barbara.

HIGH IN THE SKY — Stanford pole vaulter Chuck Harwood won his
event last week with a 13 foot vault in the Cards' victory over Fresno
State. Tomorrow Stanford will go against San Jose State in a 1:15
meet at Stanford Stadium.
If pre-meet records are any
indication, Saturday's
Stanford-San Jose State track
meet should be one of the most
exciting of the year.
The Cardinals will be slight
underdogs when the pole vault
and long jump begin at 1:15 p.m.
in Stanford Stadium. The gun for
the first running event will be shot
at 1:45 p.m.
According to Coach Pay ton
Jordan, "we're just hoping to get
it down to the mile relay, the last
event, with a chance to win. We'll
be giving away an awful lot of
points in some events (pole vault
and high jump) so we'll have to
work hard in others."
If Stanford is to have any
chance of winning the meet, the
first event, the 440 relay, will be
crucial. Here the Cards will enter
Ken Curl, John Kessel, Dave
Bagshaw, and John Anderson,
whose best time is 41.7, against a
Spartan team with a peak mark of
42.0. SJS has won the coin flip
for the inside lane, so a good race
should be expected.
In the two individual sprint
events, San Jose State should
dominate except for any points
Curl and possibly Anderson are
able to pick up.
Anderson has run the best time

this year in the 440 among all
entrants in the meet, but two
Spartan runners, Tom Sprink and
Dennis Maas, have better lifetime
bests, indicating a close race.
Distance Runs
The 880 should be won by
SJS's Glenn Harmatz. Stanford
star Brian Mittelstaedt should dual
SJS's Mark Schilling for the
one-mile crown, and he and Tony
Sandoval, if they both run, should
dominate the two-mile.
Sandoval, only a freshman, last
week set the school two-mile
frosh record with a 9:01.6 in
Stanford's first meet, a 128-31
win over Fresno State.

however, does a clean sweep for
the home team look likely. The
two remaining events, the long
jump and triple jump, are risky to
predict because top SJS
performers have not competed yet
this year.
Kenny Kring and Tom
Anderson are the Cards' long
jump hopes. Due to eligibility
questions, it is not quite certain
who Stanford's triple jumpers will
be.
In the series for the Santa Clara
County championship, San Jose
State leads 12-8, as this is one of
the Spartans' top sports. The last
time the two teams met, in 1971,
Stanford took an exciting 77-68
decision.
The Cards will take a two week
break for finals following
tomorrow's meet before returning
to action on March 24 at the
Easter relays in Santa Barbara.

HIGH IN THE SKY — Stanford pole vaulter Chuck Harwood won his
event last week with a 13 foot vault in the Cards' victory over Fresno
State. Tomorrow Stanford will go against San Jose State in a 1:15
meet at Stanford Stadium.
If pre-meet records are any
indication, Saturday's
Stanford-San Jose State track
meet should be one of the most
exciting of the year.
The Cardinals will be slight
underdogs when the pole vault
and long jump begin at 1:15 p.m.
in Stanford Stadium. The gun for
the first running event will be shot
at 1:45 p.m.
According to Coach Pay ton
Jordan, "we're just hoping to get
it down to the mile relay, the last
event, with a chance to win. We'll
be giving away an awful lot of
points in some events (pole vault
and high jump) so we'll have to
work hard in others."
If Stanford is to have any
chance of winning the meet, the
first event, the 440 relay, will be
crucial. Here the Cards will enter
Ken Curl, John Kessel, Dave
Bagshaw, and John Anderson,
whose best time is 41.7, against a
Spartan team with a peak mark of
42.0. SJS has won the coin flip
for the inside lane, so a good race
should be expected.
In the two individual sprint
events, San Jose State should
dominate except for any points
Curl and possibly Anderson are
able to pick up.
Anderson has run the best time

this year in the 440 among all
entrants in the meet, but two
Spartan runners, Tom Sprink and
Dennis Maas, have better lifetime
bests, indicating a close race.
Distance Runs
The 880 should be won by
SJS's Glenn Harmatz. Stanford
star Brian Mittelstaedt should dual
SJS's Mark Schilling for the
one-mile crown, and he and Tony
Sandoval, if they both run, should
dominate the two-mile.
Sandoval, only a freshman, last
week set the school two-mile
frosh record with a 9:01.6 in
Stanford's first meet, a 128-31
win over Fresno State.
"Tony would like to break
nine minutes this weekend,"
distance Coach Marshall Clark
says."I think he'll go out a little
faster this week. Whether Brian
will run will depend on how much
effort he puts out in the one
mile."
In the non-scoring 3000 meter
steeplechase, both Kurt
Schoenrock and Dick Day will try
to improve on excellent opening
performances last week.
Hurdles Unpredictable
In the 120 yard high hurdles,
once again, the best lifetime times
are owned by SJS athletes but
Stanford's Dave Bagshaw holds
the best time of the 1973
campaign.
The 440 intermediate hurdles
should be won by the home team,
as freshman Matt Hogsett
recorded a 53.0 time last week,
good enough to qualify him for
the Pac-8 meet the first time he
ever competed in the event.
If Stanford can stay within
striking distance, the Cards should
be able to win the final event, the
mile relay, and thus capture the
meet. Hogsett, Kessel, Bagshaw,
and Anderson will probably be
the Cardinal lineup.
SJS Should Sweep
In the field events, things may
not go so well. Stanford does not
have one high jumper within four
inches of any of the Spartans' top
three in that event, and the Cards
will also be fortunate if they can
avoid being shut out in the pole
vault. ♦
However, Stanford has definite
prospects in the shot put, where

freshman Terry Albritton, who
holds the Stanford freshman
record with a lifetime best of
57' l is the heavy favorite.
The javelin throw may be won
by the Cards' Steve Hopkins, with
SJS's Rick Rhoads pushing him.
Stanford's Jim Howard will be
favored in the discus throw.
In none of these three events,
however, does a clean sweep for
the home team look likely. The
two remaining events, the long
jump and triple jump, are risky to
predict because top SJS
performers have not competed yet
this year.
