# Cards Seek Golf Wins In Weekend Matches
## 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
Stanford's golf team has displayed some talent that may take the
Cards to the Pac-8 championship later this year, but one important
ingredient has been missing from Stanford's first three intercollegiate
events—an outright Cardinal victory.
That situation should be remedied this weekend, however, as
Coach Bud Finger's golfers face USF today at Olympic Club and then
return home tomorrow for a 10 a.m. match against the Stanford Golf
Club.
The Cards have competed in only one dual match so far, and lost
to the Alumni in the season opener on Jan. 20. Since then rain has
curtailed Stanford's dual match schedule, but the golfers have
managed to squeeze in two tournaments.

In both of those events the
Cards played excellent golf only
to have their efforts matched or
bettered by San Jose State.
Tuesday the two teams tied with
590 scores in the 36 hole Cal
State Hayward tournament in
Silverado, and last month the
Spartans edged the Cards 283-284
in Stanford's 18 hole tourney.
Both times Stanford and San Jose
State finished far in front of the
remaining teams.
The story should be different
this weekend since Stanford's
talent far outclasses both
opponents. The Card lineup of
Bruce Robertson, Aly Trompas,
Conrad Nilmeier, Dave Baskins,
Bob Chapman, and Denny Colvin
should have no trouble with USF
today and an expanded lineup of
16 should win most of the points
against the Stanford Golf Club
tome* row.
