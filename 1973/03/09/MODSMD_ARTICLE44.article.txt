# Lacrosse Season Underway
## 
### MARK WHITE 
After opening its season with
an 11-4 exhibition victory over
Brigham Young last Friday, the
Stanford lacrosse team goes for its
first league victory Sunday
when the Cards travel to the Polo
Grounds in San Francisco to take
on the Golden Gate Lacrosse Club
at 1 p.m.
The team, in reality a club that
operates mostly outside the realm
of the Stanford athletic
department, is a member of the
Northern California Lacrosse
Association, a group of Pac-8 and
municipal lacrosse clubs. The
Northern Association is matched
by a Southern Association
comprised of other Pac-8 schools
in Southern California.
Although Cal, Oregon, and
Washington are all members of the

Northern Association, lacrosse is
not considered a Pac-8 sport in
the same sense as football or
basketball. Paul Yuell, Stanford
all-star midfielder, explained that
until recently, lacrosse was too
rare on the West Coast for the
Pac-8 to sponsor any type of
formal competition.
Gaining Popularity
"Up until eight years ago
lacrosse was more or less ignored
among the Pac-8 schools" Yuell
pointed out, but since then the
sport has gradually grown more
popular. At Stanford, ex-prep
school students have been active
in making us a fairly strong team,
especially students from Andover
and Deerfield back east. Right
now we have 47 people on our A
and B teams, most of whom are
from prep schools."
Stanford has had strong teams
in recent years. In fact the Cards
were considered the best in the
West in 1965. Among the eight
Northern Alliance clubs thisyear,
Stanford, Palo Alto Lacrosse Club
and the Golden Gate club are
considered the strong teams. "To
come out on top of the league and
make the playoffs with the
Southern teams, you almost have
to have an undefeated record,"
Yuell said.
Traditionally described as a
sport combining aspects of
hockey and soccer, lacrosse is
played on a field roughly the size
of a football field by two teams of
10 men each. As in hockey, a
team tries to score by firing an
object, a small ball in this case,

past a goalie into a six foot by six
foot net positioned near one end
of the field.
Like Soccer
As in soccer, the responsibility
for scoring anddefendingis divided
among the 10 members of the
team. Three defensemen, whose
expertise lies in body-checking
and stopping the opponent's
offense are required to stay in the
back defensive quarter of the field
under the direction of the goalie.
Three more men run the entire
gamut of the field playing defense
and offense as the situation
dictates. These midfielders are
noted for their endurance,
although some people claim there
is nothing they do exceptionally
well and that they are merely
jacks-of-all trades.
A team usually gets its scoring
out of its attack players, three
men noted for their stick work
and quick moves who are
stationed in the offensive half of
the field. Two officials call
penalties that usually involve
illegal use of the wicket during the
four quarters that comprise the
game.
Against Golden Gate Sunday
all-star Yuell will lead Peter Fox
and Shelly Gordon at midfield,
while another 1972 all-star, Ken
Ketchan, leads the defense line of
Tom Earthman and Henry
Minner. Rob Owens and Hal
Richardson will share the goalie
duties while Buzz Haddon and
Dave Sampson join 1972 league
leading scorer and all-star Butch
Hazlett at attack-
