Bombings Terrorize London
LONDON — The car bomb terror of Northern Ireland
struck the heart of London yesterday with shattering
explosions outside Old Bailey court and in the area of
Whitehall. More than 150 persons were wounded in blasts
that left the worst scenes of destruction since the blitz of
World War 11.
One man in his 60s died of wounds.
In addition to the scores brought into hospitals many
others were treated at the scenes or elsewhere for shock,
cuts and bruises. Estimates of the total number of
casualties varied up to 200.
Scotland Yard itself and the Westminister area near the
headquarters of the Conservative and Labor parties also
were targets, but security men found the bombs before
they could go off.
Police expressed belief the bombs were planted by the
Provisional wing of the Irish Republican Army to coincide
with a referendum in Northern Ireland on whether that
British province should remain in the United Kingdom or
unite with the Irish republic in the south.
Eight men and two women were picked up for
questioning at Heathrow Airport, Scotland Yard reported.
Informants said they were about to board planes for
Ireland.
Wounded Knee Talks Resume
WOUNDED KNEE — Negotiations between militant
Indians and government officials resumed last night,
shortly after an exchange of gunfire between Indians and
federal law enforcement officers, the Justice Department
said.
The gunfire began about the time a cease-fire was to
take effect, and a clergyman said an Indian leader left a
mediation session to try to persuade his men to hold their
fire.

The shots lasted less than an hour, a Justice
Department spokesman said.
"Just before dark, there was sporadic gunfire, then it
got heavy," Jack Hushen, the spokesman, said.
"We returned the fire. To the best of our knowledge
the gunfire came from inside the village," Hushen said.
"To the best of my knowledge, there were no injuries."
The cease-fire agreement was announced at Wounded
Knee by Dennis Banks, an official of the American Indian
Movement (AIM) which led the takeover of the
reservation village 10 days ago.
The cease-fire agreement, which took effect at 4 p.m.
PST, included the provision to resume negotiations. The
two sides met last night and planned to meet again today.
Viet Cease-Fire Panel Splits
SAIGON — The split that seemed inevitable has developed
in the International Commission of Control and
Supervision, a watchdog for the Vietnam cease-fire.
An informant familiar with commission procedures
gave this outline yesterday:
— Polish and Hungarian delegates are operating on the
theory that the Communists won the war — and the
winner can claim "the fruits of victory."
— Canadians and Indonesians are operating on the
theory that there were no winners or losers in the 10-year
conflict — and therefore nobody has any claim to spoils.
The result has been an East-West standoff on virtually
all crucial issues. The commission operates on the rule of
unanimity. If there is no agreement, a delegation may
submit a minority report.
Today's Weather
Partly cloudy today and tonight. Increasing cloudiness
tomorrow with a chance of rain. Low temperature tonight
in the upper 30s to mid 40s. High today and tomorrow in
the mid 50s to low 60s with west-northwest winds 10 to
20 mph.

Whitehall. More than 150 persons were wounded in blasts
that left the worst scenes of destruction since the blitz of
World War 11.
One man in his 60s died of wounds.
In addition to the scores brought into hospitals many
others were treated at the scenes or elsewhere for shock,
cuts and bruises. Estimates of the total number of
casualties varied up to 200.
Scotland Yard itself and the Westminister area near the
headquarters of the Conservative and Labor parties also
were targets, but security men found the bombs before
they could go off.
Police expressed belief the bombs were planted by the
Provisional wing of the Irish Republican Army to coincide
with a referendum in Northern Ireland on whether that
British province should remain in the United Kingdom or
unite with the Irish republic in the south.
Eight men and two women were picked up for
questioning at Heathrow Airport, Scotland Yard reported.
Informants said they were about to board planes for
Ireland.
Wounded Knee Talks Resume
WOUNDED KNEE — Negotiations between militant
Indians and government officials resumed last night,
shortly after an exchange of gunfire between Indians and
federal law enforcement officers, the Justice Department
said.
The gunfire began about the time a cease-fire was to
take effect, and a clergyman said an Indian leader left a
mediation session to try to persuade his men to hold their
fire.

The shots lasted less than an hour, a Justice
Department spokesman said.
"Just before dark, there was sporadic gunfire, then it
got heavy," Jack Hushen, the spokesman, said.
"We returned the fire. To the best of our knowledge
the gunfire came from inside the village," Hushen said.
"To the best of my knowledge, there were no injuries."
The cease-fire agreement was announced at Wounded
Knee by Dennis Banks, an official of the American Indian
Movement (AIM) which led the takeover of the
reservation village 10 days ago.
The cease-fire agreement, which took effect at 4 p.m.
PST, included the provision to resume negotiations. The
two sides met last night and planned to meet again today.
Viet Cease-Fire Panel Splits
SAIGON — The split that seemed inevitable has developed
in the International Commission of Control and
Supervision, a watchdog for the Vietnam cease-fire.
An informant familiar with commission procedures
gave this outline yesterday:
— Polish and Hungarian delegates are operating on the
theory that the Communists won the war — and the
winner can claim "the fruits of victory."
— Canadians and Indonesians are operating on the
theory that there were no winners or losers in the 10-year
conflict — and therefore nobody has any claim to spoils.
The result has been an East-West standoff on virtually
all crucial issues. The commission operates on the rule of
unanimity. If there is no agreement, a delegation may
submit a minority report.
Today's Weather
Partly cloudy today and tonight. Increasing cloudiness
tomorrow with a chance of rain. Low temperature tonight
in the upper 30s to mid 40s. High today and tomorrow in
the mid 50s to low 60s with west-northwest winds 10 to
20 mph.
Bombings Terrorize London
LONDON — The car bomb terror of Northern Ireland
struck the heart of London yesterday with shattering
explosions outside Old Bailey court and in the area of
Whitehall. More than 150 persons were wounded in blasts
that left the worst scenes of destruction since the blitz of
World War 11.
