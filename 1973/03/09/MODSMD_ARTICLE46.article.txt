# Language Requirement For German Campus Cut
## 
### 
An experimental modification in
the language requirement and program
will allow students interested in
attending Stanford in Germany for
next Summer and Fall quarters to take
just one quarter of German before
they go overseas.
This departure from the previous
two quarter language requirement to
attend an overseas campus was
proposed by the Subcommittee on
Stanford-in-Germany and approved by
the Chairman of the Committee on
Foreign Study Programs and the

Overseas Campuses Office last week.
Students who have had one quarter
of German when they arrive in
Beutelsbach will be required to take a
new intensive German language
program at the campus overseas.
Details of the program are being
worked out with the German campus,
but the special course will
undoubtedly include a greater number
of hours in class per week, and a
greater proportion of the time
concentrated on language training.
Students will still be able to develop

the language competence that is
crucial to a valuable six months in
Germany.
Those who go overseas with one
quarter of German and who
successfully complete the new
intensive German program at Stanford
in Germany will be able to return to
California and start with German 52,
or fifth quarter German. They will be
at the same level as those students who
had two quarters of German before
going overseas and who take the
regular German classes in Beutelsbach.
