# Student Committees Seek To Improve Food Quality
## 
### BOB SIEGAL (Second of Two Parts 
Meals are planned on a five-week
cycle each quarter by Dietician Lois
Ohms. Evaluating the nutritional
caliber of dorm food, she stated, "the
basic menu more than meets
requirements of the National Food
Council." There are always two
entrees at lunch and dinner and "good
to high quality sources of poultry or
meat are served every dinner" with the
"second choice being either fish or
poultry."
Ohms must coordinate her menus
with the commissary's butcher shop —
"Pork chops are not followed by
another chopped meat," she said, and
in the kitchen there are never "two
main oven items the same night."
She continued, "We never plan
leftovers as the next lunch or dinner.
Sometimes they are used as a third."
Ohms explained that vegetables "are
selected to achieve a pleasing color
combination," and added "we try to
avoid similar shapes, size, texture, and
content."
Dessert Planning
A similar principle is used in
planning desserts. Ohms and Food
Service Director Maxine Anderson are
aware of the desire for more fresh
fruit, but Anderson claimed, "Our
fresh fruit expense has risen rapidly.
We try to put it out as often as we
can."
Relative popularity of different
foods is also a major consideration in
planning all meals. Feedback sources
include portion counts and comments
made to food managers "who are
supposed to circulate" during meals.
One additional system — whereby

the checker writes down comments on
a daily communication sheet and
passes it on to the dorm director — is
now being used in Wilbur and
Lagunita. Its use will likely spread to
other residences in the near future.
Opinion Varies
Consumer opinion of dorm food
and service varies from student to
student and also from dorm to dorm.
Tom Liolios, a student in Stern Hall,
commented, "The food is not as good
as my mother's cooking — in fact, she
got an upset stomach after eating
here."
John Stivelman, a Resident
Associate at Florence Moore who has
worked with the Food Service feels
that "most complaints here have dealt
with regularity of opening and closing
of lines and disappearance of
condiments before opening." He
added that "the food staff are
extremely responsive and bend over
backwards to accommodate
themselves to student desires and
interests."
Last week, an informal Daily
questionnaire revealed a number of
interesting points: People living on the
Row were most satisfied with their
culinary set-up. Among the larger
dorms, Lagunita students consistently
held their food and service in highest
esteem, with Florence Moore second.
Stern Hall came in a very definite last.
The way residents viewed the
willingness of their dorm food service
"to listen to suggestions and respond
to them" corresponded to their regard
for food quality and service.
Food Committee
Within the past month, students at
Lagunita have organized a food

committee which has stimulated
significant improvements in food
quality and service. John Manning, a
Resident Coordinating Fellow,
described the events which preceeded
its beginning:
"In winter quarter the food quality
declined precipitously." Student
complaints soon prompted Manning to
set up a meeting between members of
the food service and several dissatisfied
residents. He explained "the night

before the meeting, wanting to have
more data... I administered a
questionnaire ... with a tape recorder.
We got an amazing gamut of student
dissatisfaction."
Astrid Varteressian, current
chairman of the Lagunita Food
Committee said: "Things got to the
point where there might have been an
outright revolt, if nothing had been
done. Representatives from each dorm
in Lagunita were called to a meeting —

where they elected a chairman and
decided to have regular meetings every
two weeks.
"The continued interest of the
committee itself, the continued
pressure exerted, and the basic
cooperation of the food service has
made a lot of improvement possible,"
she added.
Flo Mo Committee
Students at Florence Moore have
also recently formed a food
committee. Meetings attended by
representatives from each house and
Food Service Manager Ruth Skinner
are held every other week. In a
meeting last week topics ranged from
Swiss steak "that was too tough," to
the feasibility of serving deviled eggs,
to plans for a special dinner.
At its conclusion, Skinner explained
her philosophy. "I want the students
who are living here to feel they are
part of it. We're here to please you."
Meanwhile, at Wilbur, students
living in Madera House recently
rampaged around the dining rooms
chanting a song about the chopped
steak. Food service staffer Connie
Rock commented however, that she
"didn't sense any interest on the part
of students to form a food
committee."
Mary Rider, a resident associate in
Madera observed that "People
complain a lot, but no one seems to
want to do anything about it."
No Show
Stern Hall has had a food
committee structure set up for the
past two years, but Assistant Food
Manager Ann Owen stated that "they
[the students] don't show up for the
meetings."

At the same time, the popularity of
weekend brunches (served only in
Wilbur, Florence Moore and Lagunita)
jumped noticibly among Stern
residents replying to the questionnaire.
This phenomenon was reflected in a
remark made by Lynda Helmstadter, a
resident of Serra House in Stern Hall —
"My roommate and I have been eating
at Wilbur on weekends — it's like
eating at a restaurant after Stem."
When asked for possible reasons
behind Stem's notoriety, Manager
Anderson said "I don't know." After
thinking for a moment she related that
psychological factors might be
influencing the perceived food quality.
"Stem is an ugly building while
Lagunita, for example, is a pretty, old
dorm with singles."
Equipment Upgraded
Stern's equipment has been
upgraded in recent years; this past
summer new convection ovens, and a
new steam kettle were installed.
Anderson added, "There is good
personnel at Stern and they want to
do a good job. Wilbur kitchen is much
more efficient — I will say that."
In evaluating student discontent
with dorm food, senior John Shulman
stated that, "The meals are evidently
not what all the students would like
them to be, but I think complaints —
including mine — can only be justified
within the constraints of an
institutional food service."
Anderson summed her attitude
toward feedback from dorm residents:
"Regardless of what some students
might think, we are interested in their
opinions. If they have something to
say, I wish they would please tell the
manager. We like to respond."

SOME LIKE IT HOT — Students at Wilbur wait to get their food. Dorm meals
have come under criticism from many people, and committees have been formed
to attempt to improve food quality.
