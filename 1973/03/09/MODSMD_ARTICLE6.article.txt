## CJP Abridges Rights 
### Brent Appel 
In an article in the March 5
Daily, Presidential Legal Advisor
James Siena challenged my
assertion that "the Student
Judicial Charter of 1968 did have
significant rights that were
consequently suspended when the
Campus Judicial Panel . was
created." Mr. Siena then
proceeded to catalogue the
limited rights existing in the
current student and faculty
disciplinary systems.
Having reexamined the
Stanford Judicial Council (SJC)
Charter of 1968 and the 1971
Procedures establishing the
Campus Judicial Panel (CJP) in
light of Mr. Siena's criticism, I
believe my earlier statement is
accurate â€” on the grounds that a
number of rights established by
the Stanford Judicial Charter have
been abridged in the procedures
of the CJP, and that the
environment within which rights
function before the CJP has been
so transformed from the original
SJC context as to substantially
alter their character and reduce
the protection which they
formerly provided.
The SJC Charter of 1968
established the unconditional
right to an open hearing, or, if the
defendant chose, a closed hearing.
But before the CJP, that right is
conditional, based on the
discretion of the CJP chairman,
whose decision cannot be
overruled by the Judicial Panel.
Witnesses
Students had the right to call
witnesses before the Stanford
Judicial Council and to confront
witnesses in front of that body.
Yet, students may not call
witnesses before the Campus
Judicial Panel, but only before a
hearing officer, whose
determination of "fact" is final.
In the SJC system, determination

of fact was made by a panel
whose membership, was 50
percent students. In the CJP
system, no students participate in
determination of fact.
Student members of the SJC
could move to override rulings of
the chairman by a majority vote
of the panel on issues of evidence.
There is no comparable provision
in the procedures of the CJP.
The chairman of the CJP, who
is appointed by the president, has
sweeping, unappealable powers
including the making of "all
rulings relating to the conduct of
the hearing before the Campus
Judicial Panel." The chairman of
the SJC had no such power.
Bill Of Rights
This is just the beginning, but I
should address some remarks to
Mr. Siena's statement that
"merely acknowledging the Bill of
Rights as binding does not lead
you anywhere."
Acknowledging the First
Amendment as binding on
Stanford disciplinary procedures
would be a significant step in
guaranteeing freedom of speech
on the Stanford campus. Such
action would insure that no one
could be disciplined for speech
that would be protected in state
or federal courts.
Professor H. Bruce Franklin
was fired from the University for
speech that would have been
protected had Constitutional
standards of free speech been
applied. As Paul Halvonik, a
distinguished San Francisco
attorney, recently pointed out,
there was, in each instance cited
by the Advisory Board in their
dismissal proceedings, an
opportunity for considered
reflection after Franklin spoke.
Responsibility for unlawful acts
must, therefore, pass from the

speaker who may have advocated
action to those who actually acted
in an unlawful manner. To adopt
the University's current position,
as Halvonik has pointed out, is to
say "that speech is not protected
when there is any likelihood of
action." This is but another way
of saying "that only impotent,
unconvincing speech is protected
by the First Amendment."
Finally, however, I do agree
with Mr. Siena's statement that
there are a host of issues regarding
campus judicial proceedings which
have not been adequately
explored, and I look forward to
public discussion of them.
