# What Can An American Do?
## We Are Not Impotent 
### Milton Mayer 
"We" Americans are numb
nowadays, done down by our
impotent indignation at being a
mass of mass murderers. But I am
not impotent, and you are not
impotent. There lies my power
and yours — and, incidentally, the
Republic's.
There it has always lain, in the
will to establish and maintain
what Franklin said would be "a
republic — if you can keep it."
Alone among forms of
government a republic requires
the will of its members each and
several. It was the faltering will of
the Roman, not of "the Romans,"
that brought his republic down
after a thousand years, of the
Weimar German that brought his
republic down in ten.
The slogan of the 1972
election — Reelect the President —
simply recorded the collapse of
the collective will to maintain a
republic. It was the pernicious
variant of the pernicious slogan,
Support the President. A

republican does not support a
President; himself holding the
nation's highest and only
permanent office, the office of
citizen, a republican commands a
President's support. When he fails
to get it, he has got to assert his
sovereignty.
War To Peace
So the American sovereign is
back where he was before a
President's generation of war
began. He is back asking himself
what an American man, one man,
can do.
The protests of the past decade
certainly played a role in the
empty triumph of turning
American public opinion from
war to peace. As long ago as 1968
the collective will demanded, and
got, the promise of peace. The
promise was false. After four
more years of war it again
demanded, and again got, the false
promise of peace. In the interval
public opinion had shown itself
contemptible. By last Christmas

its manipulators were able to say,
the public be damned.
The rejoinder now to the
complaint that "he has gone
beyond the bounds this time" is
"What bounds?" Is there anything
at all any more that "we" will
balk at, and if we will not balk
when the penalty is still light will
we balk when it is heavier?
Bonhoeffer
At Christmas the Christian
Commander-in-Chief sent his
eight-reindeer sleds aloft to drop
their iron Christmas gifts down
the chimneys of good little boys
and girls in Vietnam — with 36
hours off on Christmas Day to
allow Christ to be born between
crucifixions. The issue is not
whether the Commander is out of
his head, as Senator Saxbe of
Ohio says he is (and as marveling
men always say under these
circumstances). The issue is
whether he is your Commander
and mine.
A generation ago Dietrich
Bonhoeffer went back to his
native Germany and to death to
speak out for his country's defeat
and, should recompense require it,
its destruction. He could find no
other place and no other way to
inform himself that he was a man.
The American who would be
likewise informed has got to say
that this government is not his
government and that this
America, if (as it does) it tolerates
this government, is not his
America.
The alternatives are despair,
the deadliest of the sins, or that
anti-Americanism which, in so far
as his power lies, disengages him
from the genocidal "we" and
preserves his recognition of
himself as a man and not a
nodding head on a stick.
Panic
His doing so may even yet keep
this faltering Republic; nothing
misreads the future like panic, and
we are all panicky now. The War
is over; Mr. Nixon has made that
perfectly clear. In Peace, our
bombers hammer Laos and
Cambodia; in Peace, our largesse
force-feeds Thieu's power
structure; in Peace, our poverty
programs are swept clean away.
There is and should be no
peace for people who understand
nothing but force. We Americans
are that people. It is not too soon
for a man and a republican, who
happens to be an American, to say
aloud today what may be less
useful to him (and much more
expensive to him) to say
tomorrow.
