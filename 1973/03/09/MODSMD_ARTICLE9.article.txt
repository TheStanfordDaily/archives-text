# Fun While Learning
## Fear And Loathing In The Classroom 
### Jerry Coleman 
Do you like to inject action,
color, and zest into the normally
passive classroom environment?
Would you like a chance to learn
history through its re-enactment
— a chance for you to make the
very same mistakes famous
statesmen have made? Then, my
friends, you need only enroll in a
class mentioning "role-playing" in
its course abstract.
Let me tell you three thrilling
stories of role-playing courses I
have known. But first, a word of
caution: if your aim at Stanford is
to sit in a chair, sop up
knowledge, and nothing more,
then read no further: for the
following true-life accounts will
shock your sensibilities with the

numbing force of a quick jump
into a snowbank.
Now, daring ones, I present
tale number one: a Freshman
Seminar on Peacekeeping in
International Relations. Each
week a two student team
introduced a peacekeeping crisis,
while the remainder of the class
became combatants, desperately
trying to keep the peace while
gaining as much as they could for
their side.
Seminar Verite
My presentation dealt with the
French-Algerian crisis. For
realism, I wore a smart white
pseudo-military uniform,
complete with epaulettes, gold
braid, and medals. A portable fan
and loose sand falling from my
briefcase completed the picture.
A controversy still rages over
my affected French accent
(Provincial) and the faint trace of
bouillabaisse on my breath. Some
said that was really going too far;
others thought it essential to the
overall image.
The following week a classmate
and I were assigned to play the
British role in the Rhodesian
situation. We appeared in
pinstripe suits, bowler hats, and
umbrellas, carrying a Union Jack
and playing "Hail Britannia" on E
sharp kazoos.

Now I know what you're
thinking: that the above antics are
mere foolishness, antithetical to
the proper reception of quality
education, and a tiresome waste
of an important professor's
valuable time. Furthermore, they
represent to you an uncalled-for
disruption upon the true learning
ability of my fellow classmates.
Well, I find your criticisms to
be over-simplified, grossly
exaggerated, and in fact, a vicious
personal attack. In defense, I must
say that once the initial shock of
such colorful arrivals had
subsided, the class proceeded to
discuss the issue at hand quite
seriously and intelligently, myself
included.
Now that you have been
properly chastised, we will
proceed with story number two, «*
Human Biology seminar or
political processes.
Real Realism
The group of which I was a
member decided to organize a
game for the class demonstrating
tactics of lobbying. We picked an
issue, assigned the class roles,
elected three class Senators, then
proceeded to lobby there
legislators to get a favorable vote.
While all of us in the group
demonstrated certain lobbying
practices we had learned during

the quarter's lectures, I was given
the additional job of using any
underhanded tactics imaginable in
an attempt to buy votes.
I got one senator's support
with a bottle of wine and a
woman to sit in his lap (all in the
name of education, not
chauvinism); a second took my
six-pack of Coors but voted the
wrong way. More beer persuaded
some class members to urge the
third senator to vote properly,
and the professor got a cigar and a
dirty magazine for his efforts on
my behalf.
That Old Chemistry
It was an altogether satisfying
;vening, until I got home, at
which time criticism once again
reared its ugly, wart-covered head.
In an empassioned display of
oratorical eloquence, . my
roommate decried my classroom
antics:
"How come you get ta wear
stupid clothes ta class, and drink
beer and smoke cee-gars, and have
all sorts of fun for three units,
when I gotta bust my pants for
hours gettin' my hands all gooey
wit' chemicals in a dumb lab for
only two units, huh? How come?"
My last six-pack calmed him down
and put him to sleep.
The third story pertains to an
Urban Studies class on

community organizing. Playing
the part of community
representatives in a confrontation
with the Teachers' Union and the
Superintendent over community
control of schools, our group
staged a "spontaneous"
demonstration.
Broaden Horizons, Not Derrieres
Signs, banners, flags, music,
and some weird friends who came
along to chant slogans all had a
marked effect upon the
opposition. The demonstration
alienated and hardened our
opponents, but our threatening to
walk out of the bargaining session
got them in a concession-making
mood.
There you have it: three true
stories of classroom
dramatizations. Sure we portrayed
stereotypes; sure we upset the
normal order of things and left
some people flustered.
So broaden your horizons! Try
experiencing a class from
positions other than the sitting
one. Put a little fun into your
learning. Besides, I rent costumes
and props cheap and can use some
cash.
