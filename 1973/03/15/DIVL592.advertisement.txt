Today In The 'Daily'
! Today is March 15, 1973. j|
!; This is the last Daily of the quarter. Some of you may have
\ been fooled by a bogus publication that purported to be the !|
!; Official Dead Week Edition, but any resemblance to your I;
! faithful Daily is an absurdity.
! On this date in any given year, the buzzards come back to !;
!; Hinckley, Ohio. When the Daily comes back to Stanford !;
/ Tuesday, April 3 you can give our news office a buzzard at
!| 321-2300, ext. 4632 or call the biz office at 327-4150. !j
I Bob Beyers, please call your office. !|
