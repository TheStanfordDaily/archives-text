BYE! |
Yesterday's nuns led a cloistered
life. When they ventured out, it
was two-by-two. Their roles were
traditional and within church in
stitutions.
Things have changed. The world.
The Church. The roles women
play.
Yet for one order, these changes
are hardly apparent. Ever since
the Dominican Sisters of the Sick
Poor were founded in 1876, they
have been engaged in pastoral
ministry. They have always been
flexible, Always self-motivated.
Always had freedom. Why? By
the very nature of their work.
The Dominican Sisters of the Sick
Poor give free nursing care to the
needy in their own homes. They
travel alone by bus or by subway.
Or by car. Or on foot. And their
day doesn't end at five o'clock.
Each case presents a different
problem; whether it is bringing
physical or spiritual comfort,
keeping a family together, coun
seling or bridging the gap be
tween social agencies, we bring
the love and devotion of Christ.
We are in direct contact with the
people we care for.
You see, we don't have to be lib
erated. We are.
