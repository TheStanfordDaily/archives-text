# Task Force Proposes New Grad Aid Plan
## 
### 
Graduate students should receive
financial grants directly from the
government rather than through their
universities, a federal task force
headed by Stanford Director of
University Relations Frank Newman
recommended Monday.
The eight-member task force,
established by the Department of
Health, Education, and Welfare, said
the government should distribute most
fellowships "on the basis of
intellectual and creative promise,"
without tying them to particular fields
of study or institutions.
According to the Newman group,
main criteria for fellowship aid should
include evidence of "goal-oriented
aspiration to graduate study" and
"independent accomplishment in
non-classroom as well as classroom
activities."
In its already-controversial group of
reports, the task force also
recommended a program of 100,000
community service fellowships for
undergraduates.
Students would work from six
months to two years in a wide variety
of state and local programs under the
proposal, earning $100 per month in
educational credits from the federal
government.
Salary or subsistence payments, if
any, would come from the agencies
employing students.
New G.I. Bill
The task force patterned its
proposal after the G.I. Bill for military
veterans, arguing that ex-servicemen
"have proved to be better-motivated
and more-focused students than their
less-experienced counterparts."
Undergraduate fellowships would
"provide incentives and legitimacy for
young people to break out of the
academic lockstep," the task force
argues, and would reduce the
purposeless drift of many students
into higher education.
More Reports
In addition to three reports released
Monday, the Newman task force will
issue seven reports on specific subjects
and a general statement on the federal

role in higher education during the
next several months.
The current task force follows a
controversial 1971 group, also headed
by Newman, that issued a report
harshly criticizing the American
system of higher education.
Federal funding to date has
underwritten "a phenomenal
expansion of graduate education much
along the lines desired by the major
academic disciplines, independent of
national priorities," and created a
costly oversupply of Ph.D.'s in some
fields, the task force report on
graduate education stated.
But the Newman group opposes the
Nixon Administration's remedy, an
indiscriminate cut in federal support,
because it hurts graduate schools of
"acknowledged quality" more than
newer schools which do not depend as

much on federal funds.
In its report on "Data and
Decision-Making in Postsecondary
Education," the task force charged
that great gaps in available statistics
and information hamper
decision-makers.
The federal government now
collects almost no information on
proprietary and vocational schools,
students in college, and young people
who choose not to attend college, the
Newman panel said.
It recommended a new statistical
center to replace the present National
Center for Educational Statistics, a
division of the U.S. Office of
Education.
The three task force reports are
printed in a special supplement to the
March 12 issue of Chronicle of Higher
Education.
