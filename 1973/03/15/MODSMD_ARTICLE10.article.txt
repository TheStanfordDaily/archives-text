# Speaking Clearly
## Crimes Without Victims 
### 
*Bill Ever*

An article in the March 1973
issue of Harper's magazine
consists of excerpts from a
forthcoming book, The Second
Sin, by Dr. Thomas S. Szasz.
While Dr. Szasz is best known as a
psychiatrist who is resolutely
opposed to involuntary mental
hospitalization, the excerpts from
his new book show him to be a
consistent opponent of all statutes
which define as "crimes,"
activities in which there is no
criminal aggression and in which
the only victim is the victim of
government-imposed prohibition
and regulation.
The leading role of Dr. Szasz in
criticizing involuntary mental
hospitalization has long been
recognized. Nicholas N. Kittrie, a
law professor at American
University, wrote in his book The
Right to Be Different:
"The most vocal American
spokesman against therapeutic
tyranny has been Dr. Thomas
Szasz. A leading psychiatrist
concerned with the indiscriminate
expansion of the mental illness
concept as a justification for
social compulsion, Dr. Szasz is
also alarmed by the concurrent
casting of the psychiatrist in the
role of the jailer-custodian.
"He has therefore set out to
demonstrate how in modern
society moral standards have
declined in social pre-eminence,
"how health values have usurped
the place of moral values," and
how 'social engineering' has
arrived 'disguised as mental
health.' "
Babel
Dr. Szasz's format in his new
book is not his usual essay
approach, but rather a series of
aphorisms. He offers for our
consideration epigrammatic
paragraphs that in a few sentences
and with great cunning go
incisively, the core of such issues
as permissive child-rearing, the
regulation of sexual practices, the
illegality of heroin, and detention
of people on psychiatric grounds.
The title The Second Sin
comes from Dr. Szasz's
interpretation of the biblical story
of the Tower of Babel. In the
Book of Genesis, God says that
because the people have one
language and can understand one
another, "nothing that they
propose to do will now be
impossible for them." God
therefore decides to attack the
humans' ability to speak clearly to
one another.
Thus for purposes of
exposition, Dr. Szasz adds to the
"original sin" of the Garden of
Eden—the knowledge of good and
evil—a second sin which is
speaking clearly. In Dr. Szasz's
view, speaking clearly is
inherently subversive of the

government, organized religion,
and the psychiatric profession.
Confirmed In Sin
As a confirmed sinner, then,
Dr. Szasz discusses childhood,
victimless crimes, penology, drug
use, and other topics.
Concerning childhood, Dr.
Szasz writes, "To the child,
control means care and love; to
the adult, disdain and repression.
Herein lies the fundamental
dilemma and task of society: to
encourage parents to love and
control their children; and
politicians to respect their fellow
citizens and to leave them alone
(except when the latter deprive
others of life, liberty, or
property)."
But, says Dr. Szasz, "Modern
societies are well on their way to
inverting this arrangement: they
encourage parents to fake respect
for their children and thus justify
their failure to control them; and
politicians to fake love for their
fellow citizens and thus justify
their efforts to exercise unlimited
control over them."
Tyrant
According to Dr. Szasz, when
American citizens discuss so-called
victimless crime laws, their
conceptual framework and
semantic conventions provide
weapons for any potential tyrant.
"The fact that Americans speak
about 'legalizing' abortion,
gambling, marijuana and so forth
shows that they no longer look
down on their government as their
servant but look up to it as their
master. For to legalize is to
permit; and to permit implies a
relationship between a superior
and a subordinate—as when a
parent permits a child to go
swimming, stay up late, or eat
sweets after his meal."
Dr. Szasz's view includes a
theory of punishment as well as of
crime. He maintains that "there
can be no humane penology so
long as punishment masquerades
as 'correction.' No person or
group has the right to 'correct' a
human being; only God does. But
persons and groups have the right
to protect themselves through
sanctions that are, and should be
called, 'punishments,' which, of
course, may be as mild as a
scolding or a small fine, or as
severe as life imprisonment or
death."
A final matter of interest is
that Dr. Szasz plants himself
firmly in the camp of those
publicists (including the late
Herbert Packer of Stanford Law
School) who maintain that there
should be no criminal sanctions
for heroin use. Dr. Szasz takes as
his guiding rule here the principle
enunciated by John Stuart Mill:
"The only purpose for which
power can be rightfully exercised
over any member of a civilized
community, against his will, is to
prevent harm to others. His own
good, either physical or moral, is
not a sufficient warrant.. .. Over
himself, over his own body and
mind, the individual is sovereign."
Right To Take
Dr. Szasz argues that one ought
by right to have control over what
one ingests into one's body. He
notes that the statement, "I
disapprove of what you say, but I
will defend to the death your
right to say it," is attributed to
Voltaire. But, Dr. Szasz asks,
"Who will say today: *1
disapprove of what you take, but
I will defend to the death your
right to take it'?"
Dr. Szasz maintains that "the
right to take things is more
elementary than the i.ght to say
things; for taking things is less
likely to harm others than saying
them. In a free society, it is none
of the government's business what
idea a man puts into his head; it
should also be none of its business
what drug he puts into his body."

The different public policies on
controlling drug-users are also
analyzed. "Some advocate that
heroin be prohibited; others, that
it be given 'free' to 'addicts.' Both
positions reveal a shocking lack of
equity: why should heroin be
prohibited when alcohol and
nicotine are not? Why should
heroin be dispensed at the
taxpayer's expense to those who
crave it when alcoholic beverages
and cigarettes are not to those
who crave them? Furthermore, it
is revealing of our propensity for
meddling that every conceivable
intervention in the lives of

'addicts' is now seriously
advocated and widely supported,
save one: repealing all anti-drug
laws and leaving so-called addicts
alone."
In the person of Dr. Szasz we
have both a practicing and an
academic psychiatrist of wide
knowledge and experience whose
solutions to practical matters are
thoroughly liberal, in the classic
sense of freedom-loving. I look
forward to seeing the rest of The
Second Sin when it is published in
April.
