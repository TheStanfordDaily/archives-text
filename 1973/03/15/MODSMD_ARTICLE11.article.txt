Postage and Participation
Editor:
Norman Dupont, in his letter'
to the Editor (Daily, March 6),
questioned the purpose of our
office sending him a copy of our
latest annual report in his role as a
student member of the
Sub-Committee on Entering
Students. It states the priorities of
our office for 1972-73, not for
1971-72 as he indicated in his
letter.
We send our annual report to
students, faculty and
administrators in policy-making
positions so that they will
understand the directions in
which the Office of the Dean of
Undergraduate Studies is moving
and have an opportunity to
comment and share in shaping our
activities. We take student
participation in University
governance seriously and look to
those students who are appointed
to committees to make use of
documents that are important
tools for their informed
participation in decision-making.
I will concede Mr. Dupont
one point. If all student
committee members limited their
interaction with us to letters in
the Daily the cost of postage
indeed would be well spent.

Rent Control
Editor:
WE, the undersigned professors

and graduate students of the
Stanford economics department,
are opposed to the policy of rent
control now being advocated by
the Palo Alto Tenants Union.
When rents are fixed by law
below the free market level, the
demand for rental units tends to
increase, while the number of
rental units offered on the market
tends to decrease. Consequently,
the number of would-be tenants
tends to exceed the number of
spaces in rooms, apartments, and
houses for rent. A housing
shortage develops.
When rent controls are
imposed over a long period of
time, the expected profit margin
in the housing industry becomes
small or non-existent and
entrepreneurs are reluctant to
construct new housing units. The
lack of new housing units to
replace old, deteriorating housing
and to accommodate a growing
population contributes to a
long-term housing shortage. Such
is the case at present in New
York, Paris, Stockholm, and
Moscow.
We therefore maintain that
rent control is a self-defeating
proposition for tenants, and we
urge all members of the
Stanford-Palo Alto community to
defeat any rent control proposals.
