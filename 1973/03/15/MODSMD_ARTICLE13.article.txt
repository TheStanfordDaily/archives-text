# Consumer Groups Use Direct Action
## 
### MARCIA FRIEDMAN 
Consumer complaints and
questions are plentiful, yet most
of them remain unanswered
because people do not know
where to direct them.
Consumers United of Palo Alto
and San Francisco
Action were created specifically
for this purpose and both offer
direct-action help to angry and
inquisitive consumers.
Consumers United was
founded four years ago. I.N.
"Slim" Ingham, research analyst
at Lockheed, and one of the six
founding members, said that no
particular incident led to the
group's formation.
"A multitude of incidents
created a need for a group like
this," Ingham said, "and because
of my technical background, I felt
qualified to recruit people in
different areas. Our advisers
include chemists, physicists,
lawyers, automotive experts — the
list is almost endless."
Ingham is one of the main
grievance handlers and technical
adviser for the group. He writes a
regular column "Consumer's
Corner" for nine Bay Area
newspapers, which answers
grievances and questions people
write or phone in.
Consumers United offers
several services besides its
grievance telephone service and
newspaper column. It provides
qualified volunteers to help
negotiate transactions, referral

listings in different consumer
areas, information on consumer
legislation, a speakers bureau, and
assistance in small claims court
cases. It also conducts the KZSU
Consumer program on Thursday
evenings.

Ingham cited buying a car as a
prime example of what kind of
service they can provide.
"One of the prime targets is
the young and away from home.
If you want to buy a used car you
know you're going to get
burned," he said. "You call and

we assign someone to go with you
to help with the buying process.
"The salesman with the big fat
phony Baptist minister smile and
greasy handshake will try to sell
you as much as he can," he
continued. "At 15 percent

interest he says he will finance
you, which is ridiculous as you
can get a bank loan at 8 or 9
percent."
Anyone planning to buy a used
car from a dealer or private party
is advised to take it to a diagnostic
clinic. Buying from a private party

is encouraged over lots.
Roy Kiesling, chairman of
Consumers United and of another
group, Consumer Alliance, has
been working full time with
consumer issues since March of
1971. Kiesling, who once

practiced law and then became an
engineer at Lockheed, became
active in the environmental
movement and Zero Population
Growth prior to this.
"The problem is one of
consciousness," Kiesling said of
the consumer movement.
"Apparently lots of people, at
some level, knew there was a
population problem and all of a
sudden there was a group (ZPG)
and thousands responded. The
awareness was already there.
"In terms of consumer
problems, there is not that
awareness yet," he continued.
"People are not at the point of
realizing their consumer problems
aren't individual instances, but are

symptoms that show something is
drastically wrong."
San Francisco Consumer
Action is primarily concerned
with intervening on behalf of the
individual consumer, through
letter writing, phone calls, visiting,
small claims court, picketing, and
any other available legal means.
"Our main goal is to organize
the community behind the
movement," Kay Pachtner,
president of the group, said. "We
want to be a countervailing force
between industry and consumers.
The group's visibility in the
San Francisco area has increased
greatly since its founding in May
of 1971. A recent State Court of
Appeals decision overturned an
injunction the British Motor Corp.
had requested. Consumer Action
had been picketing the BMC on
behalf of a consumer whose car
broke down 45 days after the
BMC sold the car.
They run a mobile unit, a
brightly painted 1951 Ford panel
van, which distributes consumer
protection literature in 3
languages, Chinese, Spanish, and
Tagalog, for the city's minority
communities.
The group also helped make
sure that proper safety devices
were installed in recalled General
Motors cars on dealers' lots in the
Bay Area last year. When the
president of GM was in San
Francisco to receive the
Automotive Safety Man of the
Year award, they organized a
picket line in front of the St.
Francis Hotel.
According to Kiesling, who
also picketed: "Giving him that
award was like giving the Nobel
Peace Prize to Attila the Hun.
They designed their own award
for him — the Auto Engineering
Malpractice award; a hubcap
sculpture with broken parts from
defective GM cars. He wouldn't
come down and accept it, though."

individual consumer, through
letter writing, phone calls, visiting,
small claims court, picketing, and
any other available legal means.
"Our main goal is to organize
the community behind the
movement," Kay Pachtner,
president of the group, said. "We
want to be a countervailing force
between industry and consumers.
The group's visibility in the
San Francisco area has increased
greatly since its founding in May
of 1971. A recent State Court of
Appeals decision overturned an
injunction the British Motor Corp.
had requested. Consumer Action
had been picketing the BMC on
behalf of a consumer whose car
broke down 45 days after the
BMC sold the car.
They run a mobile unit, a
brightly painted 1951 Ford panel
van, which distributes consumer
protection literature in 3
languages, Chinese, Spanish, and
Tagalog, for the city's minority
communities.
The group also helped make
sure that proper safety devices
were installed in recalled General
Motors cars on dealers' lots in the
Bay Area last year. When the
president of GM was in San
Francisco to receive the
Automotive Safety Man of the
Year award, they organized a
picket line in front of the St.
Francis Hotel.
According to Kiesling, who
also picketed: "Giving him that
award was like giving the Nobel
Peace Prize to Attila the Hun.
They designed their own award
for him — the Auto Engineering
Malpractice award; a hubcap
sculpture with broken parts from
defective GM cars. He wouldn't
come down and accept it, though."

Consumer complaints and
questions are plentiful, yet most
of them remain unanswered
because people do not know
where to direct them.
Consumers United of Palo Alto
and San Francisco
Action were created specifically
for this purpose and both offer
direct-action help to angry and
inquisitive consumers.
Consumers United was
founded four years ago. I.N.
"Slim" Ingham, research analyst
at Lockheed, and one of the six
founding members, said that no
particular incident led to the
group's formation.
"A multitude of incidents
created a need for a group like
this," Ingham said, "and because
of my technical background, I felt
qualified to recruit people in
different areas. Our advisers
include chemists, physicists,
lawyers, automotive experts — the
list is almost endless."
Ingham is one of the main
grievance handlers and technical
adviser for the group. He writes a
regular column "Consumer's
Corner" for nine Bay Area
newspapers, which answers
grievances and questions people
write or phone in.
Consumers United offers
several services besides its
grievance telephone service and
newspaper column. It provides
qualified volunteers to help
negotiate transactions, referral

listings in different consumer
areas, information on consumer
legislation, a speakers bureau, and
assistance in small claims court
cases. It also conducts the KZSU
Consumer program on Thursday
evenings.

Ingham cited buying a car as a
prime example of what kind of
service they can provide.
"One of the prime targets is
the young and away from home.
If you want to buy a used car you
know you're going to get
burned," he said. "You call and

we assign someone to go with you
to help with the buying process.
"The salesman with the big fat
phony Baptist minister smile and
greasy handshake will try to sell
you as much as he can," he
continued. "At 15 percent

interest he says he will finance
you, which is ridiculous as you
can get a bank loan at 8 or 9
percent."
Anyone planning to buy a used
car from a dealer or private party
is advised to take it to a diagnostic
clinic. Buying from a private party

is encouraged over lots.
Roy Kiesling, chairman of
Consumers United and of another
group, Consumer Alliance, has
been working full time with
consumer issues since March of
1971. Kiesling, who once

practiced law and then became an
engineer at Lockheed, became
active in the environmental
movement and Zero Population
Growth prior to this.
"The problem is one of
consciousness," Kiesling said of
the consumer movement.
"Apparently lots of people, at
some level, knew there was a
population problem and all of a
sudden there was a group (ZPG)
and thousands responded. The
awareness was already there.
"In terms of consumer
problems, there is not that
awareness yet," he continued.
"People are not at the point of
realizing their consumer problems
aren't individual instances, but are

symptoms that show something is
drastically wrong."

"One of the prime targets is
the young and away from home.
If you want to buy a used car you
know you're going to get
burned," he said. "You call and

we assign someone to go with you
to help with the buying process.
"The salesman with the big fat
phony Baptist minister smile and
greasy handshake will try to sell
you as much as he can," he
continued. "At 15 percent

interest he says he will finance
you, which is ridiculous as you
can get a bank loan at 8 or 9
percent."
Anyone planning to buy a used
car from a dealer or private party
is advised to take it to a diagnostic
clinic. Buying from a private party

is encouraged over lots.
Roy Kiesling, chairman of
Consumers United and of another
group, Consumer Alliance, has
been working full time with
consumer issues since March of
1971. Kiesling, who once

practiced law and then became an
engineer at Lockheed, became
active in the environmental
movement and Zero Population
Growth prior to this.
"The problem is one of
consciousness," Kiesling said of
the consumer movement.
"Apparently lots of people, at
some level, knew there was a
population problem and all of a
sudden there was a group (ZPG)
and thousands responded. The
awareness was already there.
"In terms of consumer
problems, there is not that
awareness yet," he continued.
"People are not at the point of
realizing their consumer problems
aren't individual instances, but are

symptoms that show something is
drastically wrong."
San Francisco Consumer
Action is primarily concerned
with intervening on behalf of the
individual consumer, through
letter writing, phone calls, visiting,
small claims court, picketing, and
any other available legal means.
"Our main goal is to organize
the community behind the
movement," Kay Pachtner,
president of the group, said. "We
want to be a countervailing force
between industry and consumers.
The group's visibility in the
San Francisco area has increased
greatly since its founding in May
of 1971. A recent State Court of
Appeals decision overturned an
injunction the British Motor Corp.
had requested. Consumer Action
had been picketing the BMC on
behalf of a consumer whose car
broke down 45 days after the
BMC sold the car.
They run a mobile unit, a
brightly painted 1951 Ford panel
van, which distributes consumer
protection literature in 3
languages, Chinese, Spanish, and
Tagalog, for the city's minority
communities.
The group also helped make
sure that proper safety devices
were installed in recalled General
Motors cars on dealers' lots in the
Bay Area last year. When the
president of GM was in San
Francisco to receive the
Automotive Safety Man of the
Year award, they organized a
picket line in front of the St.
Francis Hotel.
According to Kiesling, who
also picketed: "Giving him that
award was like giving the Nobel
Peace Prize to Attila the Hun.
They designed their own award
for him — the Auto Engineering
Malpractice award; a hubcap
sculpture with broken parts from
defective GM cars. He wouldn't
come down and accept it, though."
