# Co-op Supermarkets Try To Meet Consumer Needs
## 
### LARRY FLEECE 
A consumer who enters any one of the five
Co-op supermarkets in operation around the Palo
Alto area might not be just shopping for groceries.
He might be looking to sell his car, or fix his TV,
or plan a week's meals, or receive advice on
nutrition, or even arrange a ski trip for his family.
The Co-op market chain, a cooperative
corporation which is owned and financed by some
13,700 local members, seeks to provide a wide
variety of goods and services which effectively
respond to the needs and interests of the consumer.
Officially titled the Consumers' Cooperative
Society of Palo Alto, Inc., Co-op has stores in Menlo
Park, Mountain View, Sunnyvale, and two stores in
Palo Alto (on California Ave. and Middlefield Rd.).
"Our main concern is to help the consumer in
any way we can," said Louise Toness, member of a
unique staff of Consumer Advisers employed in
each of the Co-op stores.
"Of course we try to help the shopper save
money," she said, "but beyond that, we are
prepared to give Co-op members nutritional tips,
recipes, information on broader consumer issues,
and group access to a number of useful services."
Consumer Adviser Office
The Consumer Adviser office in each of the
Co-op markets is surrounded by bulletin boards,
suggestion boxes, "price-per-pound" charts, and
huge files of recommended products and services,
which are all accessible to the shopper.
Beyond these services, several "invisible" services
are available to Co-op members. Upon application,
Co-op members can join the Palo Alto Credit Union
and the Peninsula Cooperative Health Group. They
can receive a group rate on entrance into a buyers'
service, which arranges discount purchases of cars,
furniture, and home appliances. They can even
arrange group charter airline flights and weekend ski
trips.
Toness explained the distinction between the
operation of a large private corporation, such as the
Safeway store chain, and the operation of a
cooperative. "The goal of a private corporation is to
provide maximum profit for its investors, whereas
the primary goal of a co-op is to provide desirable
goods and services for the supporting members
themselves," she said.
Corporation Shares
Co-op is financed by public purchase of two
types of corporation shares:
— A single "A" share, which costs $10 and

entitles the buyer to Co-op membership, voting and
group privileges;
— Units of equity "B" shares (common stock),
costing $10 apiece, which build Co-op's capital
reserves and can offer dividends to holders.
Since the revenues from public investment in
these stocks go toward store improvements and
consumer services, Toness said, Co-op is not bound
by the same profit-motive which guides private
corporations.
But at the same time, the local Co-op operation
does not have the large reserve fund and "buying
power" that many large private corporations have.
Toness contrasted the buying power of the five Palo
Alto Co-op stores, combined with nine affiliated
Berkeley Co-op stores, with the buying power of the
huge national Safeway chain.
For these counterbalancing reasons, Toness said,
"the price of goods, on the average, in Co-op and in
other supermarkets, is about the same."
At present, Co-op workers are waging a
wide-scale investment campaign, in an effort to
bolster Co-op's reserve fund by encouraging
members to purchase more sustaining "B" shares of
stock.
Consumer Adviser lona Reise said that the
purpose of the investment drive is threefold: "First,
we feel we have an obligation to the older Co-op
members to pay dividends and interest on their "B"
share holdings, since many are retired and need the
money. Second, we are working to repay our largest
creditor, Associated Co-op Inc. Third, we will put
the funds to use for further store improvements."
Reise said that the present drive seeks to recover
the financial losses resulting from the July, 1972
closure of the two-year-old Co-op store in East Palo
Alto.
The Co-op organization elects a Board of
Directors which appoints several standing and ad
hoc committees, in order to be more conscious and
responsive to consumer concerns.
The Consumer Protection committee, headed by
chairman Fran Gillis, examines the individual merit
of products carried by the Co-op stores, checks
advertising policy, and works in close connection
with the Santa Clara County Weights and Measures
office.
For example, Gillis' committee last year had the
"Liquid Plumber" cleaning product removed from
Co-op's shelves, since any child could open the
bottle. The product is now back on the shelves, with
the addition of a safety cap.
