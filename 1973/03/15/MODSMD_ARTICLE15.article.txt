Does the student employment office have any statistics on the
ratio of students annually wanting summer employment (and
registering through their office) and those who actually obtain it
(through their office)? What is the level of difficulty for a Stanford
student in finding a summer job in the Peninsula area? Are they scarce
or plentiful? Does the availability of summer jobs pick up during the
spring quarter? J.B.
According to Pam Evans, Acting Director of the Student
Employment Office, 1496 students registered for summer jobs
through the office. Of these students, at least 522 got jobs through
the office. (Over 600 students did not reply to a questionnaire that
the Student Employment Office sent out, so there is no way of
knowing if they got employment through the office or not.)
Evans said that it is fairly difficult for a Stanford student to get a
job in the Peninsula area because of the number of people looking for
work. However, she did say that "normally there is enough work so
that you can find a job if you just keep looking."
Summer employment possibilities "definitely" improve during
spring quarter, according to Evans. This is because "companies on
tight budgets wait until the last minute to send in their summer hiring
needs. Last year some companies waited until May or June."

About a week ago I was pleased to read in the Stanford Observer
that the Tresidder Coffee House had been a resounding financial
success, and that they were serving three times as many people as they
had ever dreamed possible, and that the profits were rolling in.
Imagine my surprise when I wandered in one lunch hour and found
that all the prices had mysteriously risen! 1 ask you, is this any way to
Serve the People? D.D. McM.
You are right about the success of the Coffee House in all but one
respect: it is not making money. According to manager Ken Brubaker,
the Coffee House is "doing well in terms of goals. We have more
customers, but the more customers we get, the more money we lose."
A leaflet passed out at the Coffee House says: "Prices at the
Stanford Coffee House have been at the present level since 1969.
During this period, our food costs have increased by 20 percent, with
the most dramatic of these increases coming in the last two months.
Consequently, we find it necessary to increase our prices."
The figures given in the Observer article may have been confusing.
According to the article, in 1972 the Coffee House had sales totaling
$173,000. Projections for this year are $206,000. If this figure is
reached, the Coffee House will be making a profit of $20,000, which
means that to break even the sales would have to reach $186,000,
which is obviously more than the $173,000 made last year.

$173,000. Projections for this year are $206,000. If this figure is
reached, the Coffee House will be making a profit of $20,000, which
means that to break even the sales would have to reach $186,000,
which is obviously more than the $173,000 made last year.

Does the student employment office have any statistics on the
ratio of students annually wanting summer employment (and
registering through their office) and those who actually obtain it
(through their office)? What is the level of difficulty for a Stanford
student in finding a summer job in the Peninsula area? Are they scarce
or plentiful? Does the availability of summer jobs pick up during the
spring quarter? J.B.
According to Pam Evans, Acting Director of the Student
Employment Office, 1496 students registered for summer jobs
through the office. Of these students, at least 522 got jobs through
the office. (Over 600 students did not reply to a questionnaire that
the Student Employment Office sent out, so there is no way of
knowing if they got employment through the office or not.)
Evans said that it is fairly difficult for a Stanford student to get a
job in the Peninsula area because of the number of people looking for
work. However, she did say that "normally there is enough work so
that you can find a job if you just keep looking."
Summer employment possibilities "definitely" improve during
spring quarter, according to Evans. This is because "companies on
tight budgets wait until the last minute to send in their summer hiring
needs. Last year some companies waited until May or June."

About a week ago I was pleased to read in the Stanford Observer
that the Tresidder Coffee House had been a resounding financial
success, and that they were serving three times as many people as they
had ever dreamed possible, and that the profits were rolling in.
Imagine my surprise when I wandered in one lunch hour and found
that all the prices had mysteriously risen! 1 ask you, is this any way to
Serve the People? D.D. McM.
You are right about the success of the Coffee House in all but one
respect: it is not making money. According to manager Ken Brubaker,
the Coffee House is "doing well in terms of goals. We have more
customers, but the more customers we get, the more money we lose."
A leaflet passed out at the Coffee House says: "Prices at the
Stanford Coffee House have been at the present level since 1969.
During this period, our food costs have increased by 20 percent, with
the most dramatic of these increases coming in the last two months.
Consequently, we find it necessary to increase our prices."
The figures given in the Observer article may have been confusing.
According to the article, in 1972 the Coffee House had sales totaling
$173,000. Projections for this year are $206,000. If this figure is
reached, the Coffee House will be making a profit of $20,000, which
means that to break even the sales would have to reach $186,000,
which is obviously more than the $173,000 made last year.
