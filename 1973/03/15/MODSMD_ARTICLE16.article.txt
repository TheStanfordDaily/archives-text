# Bookstore Faces Textbook Problems
## 
### JANET GENDLER 
When spring quarter begins, the
Stanford bookstore will once
again be crowded with students
buying textbooks and gripes
about the high price of textbooks
will fill the balcony.
Textbook manager Carolyn
McKnight is concerned about the
rapidly increasing price of
textbooks. She has seen cases
where a book that has been
reordered comes in four weeks
later and the price has gone up
fifty cents.
Bookstore manager Eldon
Speed said, however, that
textbook prices are set by the
publisher. The bookstore
discounts supplies whenever they
have margins to work with but
textbooks are money losers.
"Undoubtedly the price of
textbooks is high," Speed said.
"But when one considers their
price in relation to the total cost
of an education, they don't seem
so expensive."
As a partial answer to the high
prices the bookstore has been
selling more second hand books.
The bookstore buys books back at
half price and sells them for 75
percent of the original price.
Alpha Phi Omega, a student
service organization, acts as a
selling agent during the first few
weeks of the quarter. Students set
their own prices, sign a contract
with APO, and pay APO a ten
cent handling charge for each
book sold. APO handles around
seventy to eighty contracts per
quarter.

McKnight said that she would
like to see students selling more
used books back to the bookstore.
To encourage more students to do
so, the Bookstore has been
advertising that it will buy back
all books students bring in for this
week only.
At the end of spring quarter an
outside company is to come in
and buy back used books on a
larger basis than has ever been
done at Stanford before.
Although the bookstore is
interested in increasing its supply

of used books, it does not have
the Staff or space required to
handle such a large buyback.
During the first few days of
each quarter a common complaint
by students about the bookstore
is that there are never enough
books for their classes.

Although pre-reg is supposed
to help the bookstore in this
respect, McKnight said that it
hasn't made any difference. She
has to start ordering books for
spring quarter in January. When a
professor comes in on March 11
and tells her there are going to be
fifty instead of fifteen people in a
seminar there is no way she can
get the extra thirty-five books on
the shelf by April 4.
She added, "Every quarter is
different. Classes which are
underenrolled one year are

overenrolled the next. The
bookstore has as many problems
with extra books as it does with
running short on books. Many
publishing companies have limited
textbook returns. The bookstore
must pay for all the shipping costs
on these returns.

Speed spoke about the crowds
which swarm through the
bookstore each new quarter.
"Believe it or not the mob
during the first week of the
quarter has been improving," he
said. "When the bookstore was
located in the placement center
the lines were much longer. We're
doing all we can to keep the lines
moving during those hectic days."
Nonprofit Cooperative
The bookstore was started as a
nonprofit cooperative association
by the faculty on March 18,1887.

The association consists of thirty
members from the faculty,
administrative staff, and students.
A board of seven directors
elected from the membership
supervises the operation of the
store and votes on major policy
changes.
