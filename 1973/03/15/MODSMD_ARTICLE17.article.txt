# FTC Continues Battle Against Deceptive Advertising
## 
### DON TOLLEFSON News Analysis 
The Federal Trade Commission (FTC)
claimed Monday that manufacturers of a number
of leading aspirin products have been using false
and misleading advertising and called for
"corrective advertising" by the companies
involved.
The concept of "corrective advertising," in
which a company is required to run advertising
to counter former claims which the FTC feels
were false or deceptive, has been one of the most
notable accomplishments of an FTC which has
recently been characterized by an increasing
amount of consumer oriented activism.
But Monday's FTC complaint illustrated the
biggest question about the Commission's
futureâ€”does the recent departure of activist
chairman Miles Kilpatrick mean that President
Nixon is intent on slowing the activism of recent
years?
One component of Monday's complaint
indicates that such a possibility is strong. The
final version of the complaint is somewhat
weaker than one originally proposed a year ago,
since it would allow the companies involved to
avoid "corrective advertising," if they can
provide the FTC with a survey that shows that
consumers no longer believe their previous
advertising claims.
When Kilpatrick resigned in January, after
serving since 1970, he was replaced by Lewis A.
Engman, a former White House lawyer. Some
consumer activists then expressed grave doubts
about the FTC continuing its agressive activism,
especially in the very visible advertising area. The
weakened complaint issued Monday adds some

credibility to their skepticism, but if Engman
were totally under the control of the big-business
oriented White House, one might have expected
the whole complaint to have been shelved.
Optimistic Activists
Optimistic activists point to the fact that
much of the housecleaning which led to the
increased activity during Kilpatrick's term was
begun by his predecessor, Secretary of Health,
Education and Welfare Caspar Weinberger, a
former top aide to California Governor Ronald
Reagan.
A leading staffer at the FTC has said that "the
White House knows that consumerism is a hot
political issue. And having an activist FTC helps
to take the Naderite heat off the Republican
Party."
Many consumer activists feel that speculation
about the future of the FTC isn't terribly
important, since they have doubts about how
much the FTC can actually accomplish even with
a strong consumer-oriented chairman.
The FTC, which is responsible for regulation
of federal statutes involving antitrust, advertising,
truth-in-lending and packaging, was once
characterized by a critic as "the little old lady of
Pennsylvania Avenue." Before resigning in
January, Kilpatrick claimed that "the little old
lady has now put on tennis sneakers with cleats."
"Corrective advertising" has been almost
universally praised by consumer groups, but
another much-heralded program involving
advertising substantiation has had very poor
results.
Substantiation Program
The substantiation program was designed to
make advertisers produce documentary evidence

for their advertising claims. But as might have
been expected, many advertisers have not
submitted documentation and much of the
documentation has been useless because it is
either too vague or too full of irrelevant technical
information.
The FTC's problems can perhaps best be
illustrated by its 14-year battle with the makers
of Geritol. In late January, a New York Federal
Court judge fined the makers of Geritol
$812,000 for persistently showing commercials
which defied FTC orders.
The FTC said that the Geritol commercials
failed to make clear that most people with the
health problems cited in the ads were not
suffering from a deficiency of the irons or
vitamins Geritol could correct.
The Commission began its investigation of
Geritol in 1959 and ordered commercials off the
air in 1967 and 1968. FTC officials were elated
by the recent court decision, which included the
largest fine ever to result from an FTC action,
but the fact that the decision came long after the
ads were discontinued obviously diminishes its
importance.
FTC staff members hope that the precedent
will become a powerful weapon against deceptive
advertising, but the length of the Geritol battle
epitomizes the Commission's problems.
Advertising campaigns are usually short-lived and
there is little to prevent an unscrupulous
advertiser from running a deceptive campaign
when he knows that the time span of the internal
processes of the FTC and possible court appeals
will probably carry the dispute far beyond the
end of the campaign.
Injunctive Power
Some congressmen have proposed that the

FTC be given injunctive power to stop what they
consider deceptive advertising until the dispute
can be adjudicated, but the future of such
legislation is unclear.
As of now, the FTC does not have that
injunctive power and given the slowness of the
FTC processes, many consumer groups feel there
are more effective ways to combat deceptive
advertising.
In a number of cities, local consumer groups
and government officials have utilized the press
as a means of combatting deceptive advertising
through adverse publicity. Some groups and
officials have been at least moderately effective
by releasing reports about false advertising and
other business malpractice to local media. But
news organizations which depend on advertising
revenue for survival are often hesitant to air
criticism of their advertisers.
The Federal Communications Commission has
so far been a strong supporter of corporate
broadcasters and advertisers in their opposition
to the concept of counter advertising, by which,
for example, anti-pollution forces would be
entitled to free time to rebut auto company
commercials. Under Kilpatrick, the FTC
advocated such a proposal, but many stations
have refused to allow groups to even buy time
for counter ads. A group of television executives
claims that counter advertising would cost
television $540.4 million in annual gross revenues.
TV executives argue that advertisers wouldn't
want to spend their money on broadcast
advertising and subject themselves to such
counter advertising, when they could spend their
money in newspapers and magazines where
counter advertising, at least for now, is not
foreseen.

Despite these access problems, some consumer
groups and officials have been successful in
publicly exposing deceptive ads. Consumer
activists also feel that action by individual
consumers who challenge deceptive ads can also
be effective, in part because it is so rare. A
consumer who challenges deceptive advertisers
and who threatens to go to regulatory agencies,
can often achieve unexpected results.
In the January issue of "Consumer Bulletin,"
which is published by the Consumer Union, and
editorial outlined a position frequently
articulated by consumer activists: "Although
some of the FTC's activities have cleaned up the
most flagrant of false claims and misleading
advertising, its recent performance in dealing
with advertising purportedly based on scientific
and engineering data has left much to be desired.
"Much of the FTC's activities merely served
to put ad men on their guard to cause them to
exercise greater care in the phrasing of
advertising claims for their products.
"The widespread interest in consumer
education courses for schools, colleges and adult
groups is undoubtedly a more fruitful avenue for
bringing about an intelligent evaluation of
truthfulness of advertising and the elimination of
quackery and frauds."
While waiting to see what direction the FTC
will take during the next four years, many
consumer groups are trying to educate consumers
about alternative methods for combating false
advertising. The FTC is being praised for its
aggressive approach of recent years, but many
groups feel that even if this approach continues,
there is much more that should and can be done
by groups and individuals in the fight against
false advertising.
