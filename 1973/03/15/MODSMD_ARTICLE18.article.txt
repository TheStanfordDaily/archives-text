# Bates Excellent In 'Butley'
## 
### MARC D. KAYE 
The theatre scene on Geary
Street in San Francisco is really
hustling and bustling English
lately with the Royal Shakespeare
Company performing "A
Midsummer Night's Dream" at the
ACT's Geary Theatre. And right
next door at the Curran Theatre
Alan Bates is engaged in a tour de
force, starring in a new English
play, "Butley," by Simon Gray.
The Company was previously
in Los Angeles before coming to
San Francisco with their road
show. And Butley has come
directly from New York in a
touring company from London.
Alan Bates is bloody smashing
in the lead role of Ben Butley. He
is present on the stage during the
entire play, over two hours, to
give an idea of the energetic
demands placed on the actor. And
he is simply charming as Ben
Butley, the caustic, cajoling, gay,
punning, conniving professor.
In many ways, Bates' Butley is
a character of the ilk of Dylan
Thomas. He wields and indulges in
his bottle when he feels like it.
And does he have command over
the English language!
Lavish Language
Bates' Butley puts the language
to the test. He twists it. He turns
it. And he strains the very words
to their limits, coming up with
new syntactical structures that
underlie his wit. The new word
orders and constructions and their
accompanying new meanings are
unbelievable. It was a field day for

the ears! Butley's wit is sharpened
to a keen point with a poisoned
tip. And it's Butley, who is a
highly likable character in his own
way (for his humor), who at last
gets kicked in the butt.
"Butley" coincidentally
rhymes with "Butt me" and this
similarity is very suggestive of the
motivation of the main character.
He's just asking for it. Professor
Ben entertains people in his office
on campus and deliberately goes
to great lengths to step on their
toes. And the galling thing about
it, which becomes more evident as
the play gets on, is that he's out
to go all the way in his
destruction derby.
Getting His
But Butley gets his — from all
sides. And in one day! It isn't
exactly the run of the mill,
normal day that one would expect
a recently separated (from both
wife and infant daughter), gay,
and alcoholic English literature
professor to experience. Yet,
when Butley's out for blood, to
get the job done, he gets it done:
all the way; a twenty-four hour
screw-up of a thirty-five or so year
old life couldn't be accomplished
any better.
Bates is just beautiful in his
whimsical role of evading
professorial responsibility and
beating off the academic flack. He
is equally adept at acting out
anger at a bitchy wife, played by
Holland Taylor, whose mother
was the only monk ever to get
knocked up or some such

delightful rubbish!
And then Bates really gets into
the meat of the play, concerning
the homosexual relationships
between Butley and his young
protege Joseph Keyston, played
submissively by Hay ward Morse,
and Keyston's new love for Reg
Nuttall, a publisher and former
fighting man with the Gurkas. The
homosexual jealousy and rivalry
between Nuttall and Butley is
really enlightening and honestly
done. And the audience
responded accordingly to a
controversial topic done in good
taste.
Jealousy
Butley's jealousy, in terms of
emotions, is really no different
than if his attention had been
lavished on some woman: the
tenderness, the extreme coveting,
the jilted, letdown feeling. Gay
relationships are dealt with in a
very comical, matter-of-fact,
daily, digestible manner.
Underlying all this it seems, is the
author's attitude of "what's really
so different about these people?"
Bates handles the insecurities
and the expectations of the
middle-aging professor superbly.
He bullies and teases to pry
information out from Keyston, in
order to put the puzzle of what
has happened in the previous days
together. Bates' mannerisms and
comments are especially funny
when he is confronted by a female
student, Miss Heasman, played by
Geraldine Sherman, who keeps
demanding that he get started in

giving her the scheduled tutorial.
The scene in which she reads her
paper to the bored Butley is
classic.
The supporting actors and
actresses are all very effective in
their roles. Barbara Lester is
especially touching as Professor
Edna Shaft. She is a singularly
dedicated, spinster academic who
operates on the principles of
pride, quality in craftsmanship
and teaching, and professorial
responsibility: the opposite of
Butley.
Roger Newman plays lough as
a nut Reg Nuttall. And Davis Hall
plays Mr. Gardner, the new
prospective gay student protege,
with a red feather in his cap, who
Butley ultimately turns down in
despair.
Many Stanford academics were
evident in the audience as were
other students, gays, and married
couples. Along with myself, they
were all fittingly laughing their
butts off. Accolades to Alan
Bates, Simon Gray, and director
James Hammerstein for a fine job.

middle-aging professor superbly.
He bullies and teases to pry
information out from Keyston, in
order to put the puzzle of what
has happened in the previous days
together. Bates' mannerisms and
comments are especially funny
when he is confronted by a female
student, Miss Heasman, played by
Geraldine Sherman, who keeps
demanding that he get started in

giving her the scheduled tutorial.
The scene in which she reads her
paper to the bored Butley is
classic.
The supporting actors and
actresses are all very effective in
their roles. Barbara Lester is
especially touching as Professor
Edna Shaft. She is a singularly
dedicated, spinster academic who
operates on the principles of
pride, quality in craftsmanship
and teaching, and professorial
responsibility: the opposite of
Butley.
Roger Newman plays lough as
a nut Reg Nuttall. And Davis Hall
plays Mr. Gardner, the new
prospective gay student protege,
with a red feather in his cap, who
Butley ultimately turns down in
despair.
Many Stanford academics were
evident in the audience as were
other students, gays, and married
couples. Along with myself, they
were all fittingly laughing their
butts off. Accolades to Alan
Bates, Simon Gray, and director
James Hammerstein for a fine job.

PRINCESS IDA — Norman Roberts and Will Connolly perform with the Lamplighters in Gilbeit and
Sullivan's early spoof of Women's Lib at the Presentation Theater in S.F. from March 17 through April 14
on Fridays and Saturdays at 8:30. Tickets are on sale at Macy's and the San Francisco Ticket Center.
The theatre scene on Geary
Street in San Francisco is really
hustling and bustling English
lately with the Royal Shakespeare
Company performing "A
Midsummer Night's Dream" at the
ACT's Geary Theatre. And right
next door at the Curran Theatre
Alan Bates is engaged in a tour de
force, starring in a new English
play, "Butley," by Simon Gray.
The Company was previously
in Los Angeles before coming to
San Francisco with their road
show. And Butley has come
directly from New York in a
touring company from London.
Alan Bates is bloody smashing
in the lead role of Ben Butley. He
is present on the stage during the
entire play, over two hours, to
give an idea of the energetic
demands placed on the actor. And
he is simply charming as Ben
Butley, the caustic, cajoling, gay,
punning, conniving professor.
In many ways, Bates' Butley is
a character of the ilk of Dylan
Thomas. He wields and indulges in
his bottle when he feels like it.
And does he have command over
the English language!
Lavish Language
Bates' Butley puts the language
to the test. He twists it. He turns
it. And he strains the very words
to their limits, coming up with
new syntactical structures that
underlie his wit. The new word
orders and constructions and their
accompanying new meanings are
unbelievable. It was a field day for

the ears! Butley's wit is sharpened
to a keen point with a poisoned
tip. And it's Butley, who is a
highly likable character in his own
way (for his humor), who at last
gets kicked in the butt.
"Butley" coincidentally
rhymes with "Butt me" and this
similarity is very suggestive of the
motivation of the main character.
He's just asking for it. Professor
Ben entertains people in his office
on campus and deliberately goes
to great lengths to step on their
toes. And the galling thing about
it, which becomes more evident as
the play gets on, is that he's out
to go all the way in his
destruction derby.
Getting His
But Butley gets his — from all
sides. And in one day! It isn't
exactly the run of the mill,
normal day that one would expect
a recently separated (from both
wife and infant daughter), gay,
and alcoholic English literature
professor to experience. Yet,
when Butley's out for blood, to
get the job done, he gets it done:
all the way; a twenty-four hour
screw-up of a thirty-five or so year
old life couldn't be accomplished
any better.
Bates is just beautiful in his
whimsical role of evading
professorial responsibility and
beating off the academic flack. He
is equally adept at acting out
anger at a bitchy wife, played by
Holland Taylor, whose mother
was the only monk ever to get
knocked up or some such

delightful rubbish!
And then Bates really gets into
the meat of the play, concerning
the homosexual relationships
between Butley and his young
protege Joseph Keyston, played
submissively by Hay ward Morse,
and Keyston's new love for Reg
Nuttall, a publisher and former
fighting man with the Gurkas. The
homosexual jealousy and rivalry
between Nuttall and Butley is
really enlightening and honestly
done. And the audience
responded accordingly to a
controversial topic done in good
taste.
Jealousy
Butley's jealousy, in terms of
emotions, is really no different
than if his attention had been
lavished on some woman: the
tenderness, the extreme coveting,
the jilted, letdown feeling. Gay
relationships are dealt with in a
very comical, matter-of-fact,
daily, digestible manner.
Underlying all this it seems, is the
author's attitude of "what's really
so different about these people?"

and alcoholic English literature
professor to experience. Yet,
when Butley's out for blood, to
get the job done, he gets it done:
all the way; a twenty-four hour
screw-up of a thirty-five or so year
old life couldn't be accomplished
any better.
Bates is just beautiful in his
whimsical role of evading
professorial responsibility and
beating off the academic flack. He
is equally adept at acting out
anger at a bitchy wife, played by
Holland Taylor, whose mother
was the only monk ever to get
knocked up or some such

delightful rubbish!
And then Bates really gets into
the meat of the play, concerning
the homosexual relationships
between Butley and his young
protege Joseph Keyston, played
submissively by Hay ward Morse,
and Keyston's new love for Reg
Nuttall, a publisher and former
fighting man with the Gurkas. The
homosexual jealousy and rivalry
between Nuttall and Butley is
really enlightening and honestly
done. And the audience
responded accordingly to a
controversial topic done in good
taste.
Jealousy
Butley's jealousy, in terms of
emotions, is really no different
than if his attention had been
lavished on some woman: the
tenderness, the extreme coveting,
the jilted, letdown feeling. Gay
relationships are dealt with in a
very comical, matter-of-fact,
daily, digestible manner.
Underlying all this it seems, is the
author's attitude of "what's really
so different about these people?"
Bates handles the insecurities
and the expectations of the
middle-aging professor superbly.
He bullies and teases to pry
information out from Keyston, in
order to put the puzzle of what
has happened in the previous days
together. Bates' mannerisms and
comments are especially funny
when he is confronted by a female
student, Miss Heasman, played by
Geraldine Sherman, who keeps
demanding that he get started in

giving her the scheduled tutorial.
The scene in which she reads her
paper to the bored Butley is
classic.
The supporting actors and
actresses are all very effective in
their roles. Barbara Lester is
especially touching as Professor
Edna Shaft. She is a singularly
dedicated, spinster academic who
operates on the principles of
pride, quality in craftsmanship
and teaching, and professorial
responsibility: the opposite of
Butley.
Roger Newman plays lough as
a nut Reg Nuttall. And Davis Hall
plays Mr. Gardner, the new
prospective gay student protege,
with a red feather in his cap, who
Butley ultimately turns down in
despair.
Many Stanford academics were
evident in the audience as were
other students, gays, and married
couples. Along with myself, they
were all fittingly laughing their
butts off. Accolades to Alan
Bates, Simon Gray, and director
James Hammerstein for a fine job.

PRINCESS IDA — Norman Roberts and Will Connolly perform with the Lamplighters in Gilbeit and
Sullivan's early spoof of Women's Lib at the Presentation Theater in S.F. from March 17 through April 14
on Fridays and Saturdays at 8:30. Tickets are on sale at Macy's and the San Francisco Ticket Center.
The theatre scene on Geary
Street in San Francisco is really
hustling and bustling English
lately with the Royal Shakespeare
Company performing "A
Midsummer Night's Dream" at the
ACT's Geary Theatre. And right
next door at the Curran Theatre
Alan Bates is engaged in a tour de
force, starring in a new English
play, "Butley," by Simon Gray.
The Company was previously
in Los Angeles before coming to
San Francisco with their road
show. And Butley has come
directly from New York in a
touring company from London.
Alan Bates is bloody smashing
in the lead role of Ben Butley. He
is present on the stage during the
entire play, over two hours, to
give an idea of the energetic
demands placed on the actor. And
he is simply charming as Ben
Butley, the caustic, cajoling, gay,
punning, conniving professor.
In many ways, Bates' Butley is
a character of the ilk of Dylan
Thomas. He wields and indulges in
his bottle when he feels like it.
And does he have command over
the English language!
Lavish Language
Bates' Butley puts the language
to the test. He twists it. He turns
it. And he strains the very words
to their limits, coming up with
new syntactical structures that
underlie his wit. The new word
orders and constructions and their
accompanying new meanings are
unbelievable. It was a field day for

the ears! Butley's wit is sharpened
to a keen point with a poisoned
tip. And it's Butley, who is a
highly likable character in his own
way (for his humor), who at last
gets kicked in the butt.
"Butley" coincidentally
rhymes with "Butt me" and this
similarity is very suggestive of the
motivation of the main character.
He's just asking for it. Professor
Ben entertains people in his office
on campus and deliberately goes
to great lengths to step on their
toes. And the galling thing about
it, which becomes more evident as
the play gets on, is that he's out
to go all the way in his
destruction derby.
Getting His
But Butley gets his — from all
sides. And in one day! It isn't
exactly the run of the mill,
normal day that one would expect
a recently separated (from both
wife and infant daughter), gay,
and alcoholic English literature
professor to experience. Yet,
when Butley's out for blood, to
get the job done, he gets it done:
