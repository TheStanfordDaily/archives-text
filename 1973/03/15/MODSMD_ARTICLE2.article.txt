# Fake 'Campus Report' Enlivens Dead Week
## 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
Fired Maoist Prof. H. Bruce
Franklin will rejoin the faculty here as
a senior fellow at Hoover Institution,
startled readers of the "Campus
Report," the weekly faculty-staff
newspaper, were told yesterday.
Even more startling was the fact
that the "compromise" was arranged
during a weekend of intensive
negotiations attended by Franklin and
University officials and presided over
by Dr. Henry A. Kissinger.
The story appeared in a bogus
edition of the paper published by the
"Chaparral," the student humor
magazine. Ten thousand copies of the
eight-page parody were distributed
throughout the campus.
Perplexed readers learned that
South Vietnamese President Nguyen
Van Thieu was planning an April 6
speech on campus, that Law Prof.
Anthony Amsterdam had filed a
class-action suit on behalf of the stray
dogs who are being impounded on

campus, and that Montgomery Scott, a
character in the "Star Trek" TV series,
had been named as a professor of
aeronautics and astronautics.
Looks Like Real Thing
"We've been laughing our heads off.
This is a very sharp job," said Jeff
Littleboy of the University News
Service, which publishes the real
"Campus Report." "It looks like the
real thing, and the stories all seem to
make sense at the beginning. It's just
when you get further into the story
that you realize something's not
right."
One article about a project at the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center
(SLAC) on "spiritual energy" revealed
SLAC personnel had programmed
computers to worship Provost William
F. Miller, a former professor of
computer science.
One of the "project" researchers
was quoted: "It's ex officio, of course.
If Dr. Miller were no longer provost,
they would worship his successor,

although some of the prayers wouldn't
make sense if the provost weren't a
computer man."
Other announcements included a
scholarship grant to music majors who
have "shown the ability ' and
willingness to study the ultimate of
vocal art, the vox castrato," the use of
castration to maintain male singers'
high voices and the impending
marriage of ASSU President Scott
Burke to singer Roberta Flack.
In the classified ads was a notice of
a room for rent: "Undergraduates.
One room in attic. No water or
kitchen privileges. $275/ month. No
children, no pets, no honkies. Prof. X,
x 2098." Read another: "Will trade
house for massage parlor. Bicycling
distance from campus." Another ad
placed President Richard Lyman's
house for sale.
According to Littleboy, the News
Service first learned of the hoax when
an employee brought several copies to
work with him. The real "Campus

Report" was due out later in the day,
and the office was flooded with
dozens of phone calls about the bogus
edition.
Some Not Amused
Not all readers thought the parody
was funny, though. Armista Cook, a
supervisor in the Registrar's office,
reacted angrily to a story stating that
Acting Registrar Robert Houghton
would be named permanent registrar.
"We were all so thrilled when we
read it," she said. "Then we found out
it wasn't true. This is a dreadful thing.
There is nothing funny about it."
However, she said that Houghton, one
of several candidates for the
permanent job, was "taking it like a
good sport."
"Chaparral" staff member Alan
Wachtel said that some 20 persons
worked on the parody for about a
week. He said that, so far, there had
been no calls to the "Chaparral"
office, because few people were aware
that the magazine was responsible.

x 2098." Read another: "Will trade
house for massage parlor. Bicycling
distance from campus." Another ad
placed President Richard Lyman's
house for sale.
According to Littleboy, the News
Service first learned of the hoax when
an employee brought several copies to
work with him. The real "Campus

Report" was due out later in the day,
and the office was flooded with
dozens of phone calls about the bogus
edition.
Some Not Amused
Not all readers thought the parody
was funny, though. Armista Cook, a
supervisor in the Registrar's office,
reacted angrily to a story stating that
Acting Registrar Robert Houghton
would be named permanent registrar.
"We were all so thrilled when we
read it," she said. "Then we found out
it wasn't true. This is a dreadful thing.
There is nothing funny about it."
However, she said that Houghton, one
of several candidates for the
permanent job, was "taking it like a
good sport."
"Chaparral" staff member Alan
Wachtel said that some 20 persons
worked on the parody for about a
week. He said that, so far, there had
been no calls to the "Chaparral"
office, because few people were aware
that the magazine was responsible.
Fired Maoist Prof. H. Bruce
Franklin will rejoin the faculty here as
a senior fellow at Hoover Institution,
startled readers of the "Campus
Report," the weekly faculty-staff
newspaper, were told yesterday.
Even more startling was the fact
that the "compromise" was arranged
during a weekend of intensive
negotiations attended by Franklin and
University officials and presided over
by Dr. Henry A. Kissinger.
The story appeared in a bogus
edition of the paper published by the
"Chaparral," the student humor
magazine. Ten thousand copies of the
eight-page parody were distributed
throughout the campus.
Perplexed readers learned that
South Vietnamese President Nguyen
Van Thieu was planning an April 6
speech on campus, that Law Prof.
Anthony Amsterdam had filed a
class-action suit on behalf of the stray
dogs who are being impounded on

campus, and that Montgomery Scott, a
character in the "Star Trek" TV series,
had been named as a professor of
aeronautics and astronautics.
Looks Like Real Thing
"We've been laughing our heads off.
This is a very sharp job," said Jeff
Littleboy of the University News
Service, which publishes the real
"Campus Report." "It looks like the
real thing, and the stories all seem to
make sense at the beginning. It's just
when you get further into the story
that you realize something's not
right."
One article about a project at the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center
(SLAC) on "spiritual energy" revealed
SLAC personnel had programmed
computers to worship Provost William
F. Miller, a former professor of
computer science.
One of the "project" researchers
was quoted: "It's ex officio, of course.
If Dr. Miller were no longer provost,
they would worship his successor,

although some of the prayers wouldn't
make sense if the provost weren't a
computer man."
Other announcements included a
scholarship grant to music majors who
have "shown the ability ' and
willingness to study the ultimate of
vocal art, the vox castrato," the use of
castration to maintain male singers'
high voices and the impending
marriage of ASSU President Scott
Burke to singer Roberta Flack.
In the classified ads was a notice of
a room for rent: "Undergraduates.
One room in attic. No water or
kitchen privileges. $275/ month. No
children, no pets, no honkies. Prof. X,
x 2098." Read another: "Will trade
