# 'Swan Lake'
## ABT Ends SF Booking 
### RUST EDDIE 
Natalia Makarova closed American Ballet
Theater's week-long San Francisco engagement at
the Opera House Sunday evening. She consequently
turned ballet fiction into fact by receiving a
standing ovation for Sunday's "Swan Lake" in
addition to one for her performance in "Giselle" a
week earlier.
Save for Makarova, A.B.T.'s brightest star,
women do not dance like this even on television
specials of the sixties, movies of the fifties and
musicals of the forties. This balletic personification
of the Integral, better now than on her two past
Ballet Theater U.S. tours, may eventually forsake
A.B.T.'s lineup for another, possibly England's
Royal Ballet, sacrificing, perhaps, salary for prestige.
A gem of Makarova luster cannot remain forever
in a setting such as A.B.T. Despite compensations
from Lucia Chase, who to date has given A.B.T.
over $26,000,000, Makarova's potential, not very
promising if she remains with A.8.T., is at stake.
Still playing Queen, as a casual glance at the
prominent picture on A.B.T.'s program cover
testifies, Miss Chase fittingly appears on stage in red
velvet and ermine. Reminding her son, Prince

Siegfried, performed Sunday by Ivan Nagy, that it is
his duty to choose a bride, she augurs doom by
giving him a crossbow on his twenty-first birthday.
Eager to test his toy, Siegfried goes hunting. Left
alone, he sees a magnificent swan in flight. He takes
aim: to his astonishment, the bird transforms into
the most beautiful girl. She tells him that she is a
princess of high birth who fell under the spell of an
evil sorcerer and now is fated to be a swan. Only in
the hours of darkness may she assume human form.
This then is Odette, to whom Makarova gives
life through incomparable technique acquired with
Leningrad's Kirov Ballet. As Odile, sorcerer von
Rothbart's daughter who, disguised as Odette
becomes bethrothed to Prince Siegfried, Makarova,
as "the other half," again proves equally stunning.
United in despair at the story's close, Siegfried
follows Odile's example and hurls himself into the
very lake filled with Odile's mother's tears. Ending
their lives, the lovers thus break von Rothbart's
power who in turn dies.
In a final triumph of Good over Evil, the lovers
join in apotheosis. Ageless as "Swan Lake's"
choreography by Petipa and Ivanov is, the dancer of
our times is Makarova.

life through incomparable technique acquired with
Leningrad's Kirov Ballet. As Odile, sorcerer von
Rothbart's daughter who, disguised as Odette
becomes bethrothed to Prince Siegfried, Makarova,
as "the other half," again proves equally stunning.
United in despair at the story's close, Siegfried
follows Odile's example and hurls himself into the
very lake filled with Odile's mother's tears. Ending
their lives, the lovers thus break von Rothbart's
power who in turn dies.
In a final triumph of Good over Evil, the lovers
join in apotheosis. Ageless as "Swan Lake's"
choreography by Petipa and Ivanov is, the dancer of
our times is Makarova.
Natalia Makarova closed American Ballet
Theater's week-long San Francisco engagement at
the Opera House Sunday evening. She consequently
turned ballet fiction into fact by receiving a
standing ovation for Sunday's "Swan Lake" in
addition to one for her performance in "Giselle" a
week earlier.
Save for Makarova, A.B.T.'s brightest star,
women do not dance like this even on television
specials of the sixties, movies of the fifties and
musicals of the forties. This balletic personification
of the Integral, better now than on her two past
Ballet Theater U.S. tours, may eventually forsake
A.B.T.'s lineup for another, possibly England's
Royal Ballet, sacrificing, perhaps, salary for prestige.
A gem of Makarova luster cannot remain forever
in a setting such as A.B.T. Despite compensations
from Lucia Chase, who to date has given A.B.T.
over $26,000,000, Makarova's potential, not very
promising if she remains with A.8.T., is at stake.
Still playing Queen, as a casual glance at the
prominent picture on A.B.T.'s program cover
testifies, Miss Chase fittingly appears on stage in red
velvet and ermine. Reminding her son, Prince

Siegfried, performed Sunday by Ivan Nagy, that it is
his duty to choose a bride, she augurs doom by
giving him a crossbow on his twenty-first birthday.
Eager to test his toy, Siegfried goes hunting. Left
alone, he sees a magnificent swan in flight. He takes
aim: to his astonishment, the bird transforms into
the most beautiful girl. She tells him that she is a
princess of high birth who fell under the spell of an
evil sorcerer and now is fated to be a swan. Only in
the hours of darkness may she assume human form.
This then is Odette, to whom Makarova gives
life through incomparable technique acquired with
Leningrad's Kirov Ballet. As Odile, sorcerer von
Rothbart's daughter who, disguised as Odette
becomes bethrothed to Prince Siegfried, Makarova,
as "the other half," again proves equally stunning.
United in despair at the story's close, Siegfried
follows Odile's example and hurls himself into the
very lake filled with Odile's mother's tears. Ending
their lives, the lovers thus break von Rothbart's
power who in turn dies.
In a final triumph of Good over Evil, the lovers
join in apotheosis. Ageless as "Swan Lake's"
