# Spaghetti Factory Offers Fine Music
## 
### BRUCE LAMOTT 
In addition to good food at
reasonable prices, the Old
Spaghetti Factory in S.F.'s North
Beach offers a Sunday night
concert series which is much more
than a come-on for restaurant
business. Donald Pippin presents a
schedule of mostly local musicians
and works less likely to be heard
in the major performing arenas of
this area. In an old barroom
replete with outrageous objects
d'art, the listener forgets the
stagecraft of the concert hall and
is treated to a hearing of chamber
music where it belongs.
Music for a While, an ensemble
of versatile performers of early
music, played a program of
fourteenth century Italian and
French music as well as works of
Guillaume Dufay "(c. 1400-1474)
to a packed and enthusiastic
audience in this setting Sunday,
March 4.
Organized and directed by
LaNoue Davenport, the group —
all formerly with the New York
Pro Musica — is an accomplished
exponent of the performance of
medieval music whose mastery of
early instruments is as fine as any
conservatory ensemble.
Excellent programming caught
attention with the spirited
Istampita Ghaetta, an Italian
dance played on the lute, psaltery,
kemence (a small three-stringed
bowed instrument of Persian
origin), and drum. The startling
oriental tone color and rhythmic
complexity strongly suggest the
Eastern influence on Western

music in this earliest known genre
of instrumental repertoire.
Cohesive Ensemble
Landini's plaintive Adyou,
adyou, sung by soprano Sheila
Schonbrun to the accompaniment
of recorders and vielle (the
medieval fiddle), demonstrated
keen attention to individual
melodic lines contained within a
cohesive total ensemble.
Schonbrun, who plays portative
organ and psaltery as well, sings
with clarity and rhythmic
precision, artistically shaping the
vocal line in accordance with the
character of the text.
Davenport's recorder virtuosity
was amply displayed by the
ornamental divisions in the Solage
Tres gentil cuer. The fluidity of
his lines intertwined with the
accompanying lute and psaltery,
which, being plucked by a crow
quill, suggests an early antecedent
of the harpsichord principle.
In Calextone qui fut by the
same composer, Judith Davidoff
demonstrated the lyric capabilities
of the vielle in a piece marked by
unexpected harmonic
progressions, to the
accompaniment of lutenist Chris
Williams.
Alarme, alar me by Grimace
introduced the 'high' (loud)
instruments: sackbut (ancestral
trombone) and schawm (precursor
of the oboe), masterfully played
by Williams, with kemence. The
vigorous interplay of the vocal
part with the instrumental lines
resulted in a stirring agitation in

keeping with the text, but
rhythmically sound.
Subtle Interplay
The subtle interplay of the
ensemble was best shown in the
Dufay works. Gaude Virgo, Mater
Christi, the only sacred
composition performed, showed
fine vocal control and flawless
recorder intonation. Individia
nimica featured diminutions on
the tiny portative organ, played
by Schonbrun with the right hand
while operating the bellows with
the other.
The delicate transparency of
lute, harp, and psaltery combined
for the lament, Je me complains
displayed a heretofore unheard
tone color. All the more dramatic,
then, when the high instruments
returned for the concluding
Donnes rassault with its depiction
of military aggressiveness.
Performances of this calibre
and the low ($2) student
admission make this series well
worth plans for a Sunday night
getaway.
