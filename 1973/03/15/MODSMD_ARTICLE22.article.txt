# Bunraku Exhibits Technical Craft
## 
### RUST EDDIE 
Despite 197 3's being heralded 'The Year of Europe,"
Asia still grabs a lot of headlines and this carries over to
the entertainment pages now as well. Bunraku, the
National Puppet Theatre of Japan, closed its week-long
engagement Sunday at Nourse Auditorium in San
Francisco.
Sponsored in part by the Foreign Ministry of Japan
and the Japanese Culture Center, this almost life-size
puppet art form which influenced Kabuki was
performed by a troupe from Osaka, San Francisco's
sister city.
It is not hard to see why Nureyev, among others,
recommends seeing Bunraku, for here playing with dolls
is elevated to its highest level.
Mime Manipulators
Conforming to Shirley Booth's dictum that, "Actors
should be overheard, not listened to," Bunraku features
three mime-manipulators to each puppet: one controls
the right arm, mouth, eyes and eyebrows; another
manipulates the left arm and skirt if there is one, and a
third moves the feet. Dialogue and sound are
contributed by Joruri reciters and Samisen players off to
one side of the stage.
The stage, to borrow from Anthony Haden-Guest, the
British Tom Wolf, "looked like a tank full of Siamese
fighting fish." It is a toss-up whether color or violence is

the least important variable in Bunraku theatre. After
seeing Wednesday's evening program, though, I suspect it
is color.
A Tragedy
"The Priest In Exile," written in 1719 by
Monzaemon Chikamatsu, the Shakespeare of Japan,
concerns the tragedy on Kikai Island. Shunkan, a priest
and exile on the island along with Naritsune and
Yasuyori after leading an abortive plot against the ruling
Heike clan has, unlike Naritsune and Yasuyori who have
been granted amnesty, had his sentence commuted to
one not unlike Oedipus': he is free except to return to
the capital.
Preparing to debark from the island, Seno, the
messenger who delivered the pardons to Naritsune and
Yasuyori, stops only Chidori, a high cheek-boned
woman whom Naritsune has married during his
three-year exile on Kikai: now no one will leave the
island. Seno orders the three men on the boat,
maliciously revealing to Shunkan that his wife has been
put to death for spurning the chief of the Heike clan's
advances.
Before the sun has set, Shunkan has sawed off Seno's
head and the boat sets sail, this time with Chidori,
leaving priest Shunkan in exile.
Shunkan's proven disregard for personal comfort

coupled with his manic energy contribute to Bunraku's
well spaced comic moments.
Double Suicide
The second feature on Wednesday's program, "The
Double Suicide At Sonezaki," likewise by Chikamatsue
(1703), was better than the first though faced with a
third hour of viewing puppets, some delicate souls were
tempted, apparently, not to find out.
Tokubei, a clerk in his uncle's soy shop reveals to
Ohatsu, his love, his predicament. His uncle has arranged
for him to marry his aunt's niece. Tokubei has
discovered that his stepmother has already accepted the
girl's dowry. He has protested the marriage and
recovered the money from his stepmother but has rashly
lent it to a friend. Never to see the money again,
Tokubei and Ohatsu determine to die in each others
arms.
Unable to summon the willpower to kill Ohatsu,
Tokubei prolongs the agony of having to murder his
lover. Ohatsu, meanwhile, pleads for death. In a
dramatic pas de deux reminiscent of the one with the
bewitched shawl in Erik Bruhn's, "La Sylphide,"
Tokubei undoes Ohatsu's obi, winding her up in it, then
running her through with his sword. Following her lead,
Tokubei commits suicide to exit in Ohatsu's arms. With
all Bunraku's terrific craft, however, even fiascos can
have happy endings.

three mime-manipulators to each puppet: one controls
the right arm, mouth, eyes and eyebrows; another
manipulates the left arm and skirt if there is one, and a
third moves the feet. Dialogue and sound are
contributed by Joruri reciters and Samisen players off to
one side of the stage.
The stage, to borrow from Anthony Haden-Guest, the
British Tom Wolf, "looked like a tank full of Siamese
fighting fish." It is a toss-up whether color or violence is

the least important variable in Bunraku theatre. After
seeing Wednesday's evening program, though, I suspect it
is color.
A Tragedy
"The Priest In Exile," written in 1719 by
Monzaemon Chikamatsu, the Shakespeare of Japan,
concerns the tragedy on Kikai Island. Shunkan, a priest
and exile on the island along with Naritsune and
Yasuyori after leading an abortive plot against the ruling
Heike clan has, unlike Naritsune and Yasuyori who have
been granted amnesty, had his sentence commuted to
one not unlike Oedipus': he is free except to return to
the capital.
Preparing to debark from the island, Seno, the
messenger who delivered the pardons to Naritsune and
Yasuyori, stops only Chidori, a high cheek-boned
woman whom Naritsune has married during his
three-year exile on Kikai: now no one will leave the
island. Seno orders the three men on the boat,
maliciously revealing to Shunkan that his wife has been
put to death for spurning the chief of the Heike clan's
advances.
Before the sun has set, Shunkan has sawed off Seno's
head and the boat sets sail, this time with Chidori,
leaving priest Shunkan in exile.
Shunkan's proven disregard for personal comfort

coupled with his manic energy contribute to Bunraku's
well spaced comic moments.
Double Suicide
The second feature on Wednesday's program, "The
Double Suicide At Sonezaki," likewise by Chikamatsue
(1703), was better than the first though faced with a
third hour of viewing puppets, some delicate souls were
tempted, apparently, not to find out.
Tokubei, a clerk in his uncle's soy shop reveals to
Ohatsu, his love, his predicament. His uncle has arranged
for him to marry his aunt's niece. Tokubei has
discovered that his stepmother has already accepted the
girl's dowry. He has protested the marriage and
recovered the money from his stepmother but has rashly
lent it to a friend. Never to see the money again,
Tokubei and Ohatsu determine to die in each others
arms.
Unable to summon the willpower to kill Ohatsu,
Tokubei prolongs the agony of having to murder his
lover. Ohatsu, meanwhile, pleads for death. In a
dramatic pas de deux reminiscent of the one with the
bewitched shawl in Erik Bruhn's, "La Sylphide,"
Tokubei undoes Ohatsu's obi, winding her up in it, then
running her through with his sword. Following her lead,
Tokubei commits suicide to exit in Ohatsu's arms. With
all Bunraku's terrific craft, however, even fiascos can
have happy endings.
Despite 197 3's being heralded 'The Year of Europe,"
Asia still grabs a lot of headlines and this carries over to
the entertainment pages now as well. Bunraku, the
National Puppet Theatre of Japan, closed its week-long
engagement Sunday at Nourse Auditorium in San
Francisco.
Sponsored in part by the Foreign Ministry of Japan
and the Japanese Culture Center, this almost life-size
puppet art form which influenced Kabuki was
performed by a troupe from Osaka, San Francisco's
sister city.
It is not hard to see why Nureyev, among others,
recommends seeing Bunraku, for here playing with dolls
is elevated to its highest level.
Mime Manipulators
Conforming to Shirley Booth's dictum that, "Actors
should be overheard, not listened to," Bunraku features
three mime-manipulators to each puppet: one controls
the right arm, mouth, eyes and eyebrows; another
manipulates the left arm and skirt if there is one, and a
third moves the feet. Dialogue and sound are
