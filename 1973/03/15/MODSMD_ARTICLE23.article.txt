# Bitetti Gives Uneven Performance
## 
### DOUG SMITH 
Argentine classic guitarist
Ernesto Bitetti gave a respectable,
if uneven, performance of the
guitar's greatest hits at Flint
Center last Friday.
There is a repertory problem
which every student of the classic
guitar must face, and Bitetti did
not demonstrate in this concert
that he has solved it. Although
there exists an enormous amount
of pieces written for guitar
through the centuries, the vast
majority are slight or downright
rubbish. The few that are
substantial and please audiences are
studied by every intermediate and
advanced student and are very
often performed.
This is the case with
"Leyenda" by Albeniz (a
transcription from the piano
original), Tarrega's "Recuerdos de
la Alhambra," Sor's "Mozart
Variations," pieces from the
"Instruction" of Gaspar Sanz, and
a few others.
The solution is to turn to
transcriptions from lute and
vihuela (or other) music and to

exploring the increasing
contemporary repertoire.
However, Bitetti began with Sanz,
included the obligatory Bach
suite, and the rest was 19th and
20th century Spanish chestnuts,
except for a contemporary piece
by Leo Brouwer.
Spirited Pieces
He played eleven pieces by
Sanz (1640-1710) sensitively and
pleasantly, rendering the florid
ornaments especially well. His
Bach (transcription of the first
solo cello suite) was fluent and
spirited, but was marred by his
habit of stopping at half cadences
for unnecessarily long trills.
These ornaments, written on
one beat, were extended by the
performer sometimes to the
equivalent of two bars, and were
followed by a pause, so that the

dance came to a complete halt.
This mannerism interrupted every
dance movement except the
courante, which Bitetti played
very effectively at a daring tempo.
Bitetti tackled Fernando Sor's
virtuoso "Variations on a theme
of Mozart" at high speed and did
not drop a note. His left hand
position is the crudest I have ever
seen on a serious classic guitarist
— he tends to wrap his thumb
around the neck like a rock or
folk guitar player — but it
somehow does not hinder him.
His interpretation of the
familiar Torroba sonatina was
pensive, and the adagio
particularly could have been more
fervent. In the final allegro
Bitetti's articulation of the
recurrent principal motif, four
quick repeated notes, was sluggish

when it should have been crisp.
Special Affinity
Two other chestnuts, "Danza
No. 5" by Granados and Albeniz'
"Leyenda" demonstrated that
Bitetti's special affinity is for late
nineteenth century Spanish music.
He was especially comfortable
with "Leyenda," playing
forcefully and without overdoing
the rubato.
The concert concluded
withVilla-Lobos' "Study No. 11"
and "Elogio de la Danza" by
Brouwer, followed by two
encores.
Bitetti is a young (born in
1943) musician who is one of the
most capable guitarists now
touring. Like most classic
guitarists under the age of sixty,
he is billed by his impresario as
the heir to Segovia, which he is

not. His technique is good, but his
music is still a bit cool and
sometimes mannered. However,
he is certainly worth watching.
The most unfortunate aspect
of the evening was that this
concert took place in a very large
(2571 capacity) concert hall. An
unamplified classic guitar is
an intimate instrument suited for
auditoriums no larger than a
quarter that size. In such a
cavernous hall the guitar's subtle
nuances are swallowed up, and
even forte passages sound piano.
Another reason to use a small
hall is that guitar concerts seldom
sell out, unless Bream or Segovia
is playing. Flint Center was no
more than one fourth full, so both
the promoters and the audience
lost.

Ernesto Bitetti gave a respectable,
if uneven, performance of the
guitar's greatest hits at Flint
Center last Friday.
There is a repertory problem
which every student of the classic
guitar must face, and Bitetti did
not demonstrate in this concert
that he has solved it. Although
there exists an enormous amount
of pieces written for guitar
through the centuries, the vast
majority are slight or downright
rubbish. The few that are
substantial and please audiences are
studied by every intermediate and
advanced student and are very
often performed.
This is the case with
"Leyenda" by Albeniz (a
transcription from the piano
original), Tarrega's "Recuerdos de
la Alhambra," Sor's "Mozart
Variations," pieces from the
"Instruction" of Gaspar Sanz, and
a few others.
The solution is to turn to
transcriptions from lute and
vihuela (or other) music and to

exploring the increasing
contemporary repertoire.
However, Bitetti began with Sanz,
included the obligatory Bach
suite, and the rest was 19th and
20th century Spanish chestnuts,
except for a contemporary piece
by Leo Brouwer.
Spirited Pieces
He played eleven pieces by
Sanz (1640-1710) sensitively and
pleasantly, rendering the florid
ornaments especially well. His
Bach (transcription of the first
solo cello suite) was fluent and
spirited, but was marred by his
habit of stopping at half cadences
for unnecessarily long trills.
These ornaments, written on
one beat, were extended by the
performer sometimes to the
equivalent of two bars, and were
followed by a pause, so that the

dance came to a complete halt.
This mannerism interrupted every
dance movement except the
courante, which Bitetti played
very effectively at a daring tempo.
Bitetti tackled Fernando Sor's
virtuoso "Variations on a theme
of Mozart" at high speed and did
not drop a note. His left hand
position is the crudest I have ever
seen on a serious classic guitarist
— he tends to wrap his thumb
around the neck like a rock or
folk guitar player — but it
somehow does not hinder him.
His interpretation of the
familiar Torroba sonatina was
pensive, and the adagio
particularly could have been more
fervent. In the final allegro
Bitetti's articulation of the
recurrent principal motif, four
quick repeated notes, was sluggish

when it should have been crisp.
Special Affinity
Two other chestnuts, "Danza
No. 5" by Granados and Albeniz'
"Leyenda" demonstrated that
Bitetti's special affinity is for late
nineteenth century Spanish music.
He was especially comfortable
with "Leyenda," playing
forcefully and without overdoing
the rubato.
The concert concluded
withVilla-Lobos' "Study No. 11"
and "Elogio de la Danza" by
Brouwer, followed by two
encores.
Bitetti is a young (born in
1943) musician who is one of the
most capable guitarists now
touring. Like most classic
guitarists under the age of sixty,
he is billed by his impresario as
the heir to Segovia, which he is

not. His technique is good, but his
music is still a bit cool and
sometimes mannered. However,
he is certainly worth watching.
The most unfortunate aspect
of the evening was that this
concert took place in a very large
(2571 capacity) concert hall. An
unamplified classic guitar is
an intimate instrument suited for
auditoriums no larger than a
quarter that size. In such a
cavernous hall the guitar's subtle
nuances are swallowed up, and
even forte passages sound piano.
Another reason to use a small
hall is that guitar concerts seldom
sell out, unless Bream or Segovia
is playing. Flint Center was no
more than one fourth full, so both
the promoters and the audience
lost.
