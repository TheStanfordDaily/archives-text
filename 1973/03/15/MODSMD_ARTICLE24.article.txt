Senate 'Invitation' Rejected
WASHINGTON — Presidential Counsel John W. Dean
yesterday turned down an invitation from the Senate
Judiciary Committee to testify at its hearings on L.
Patrick Gray's nomination to be FBI director. But he said
he would answer relevant detailed questions in writing.
His letter to Chairman James O. Eastland (D-Miss.), left
the next move up to the committee, which invited Dean
to appear for questioning by a 16 to 0 vote Tuesday.
Eastland told a reporter he favored accepting Dean's
offer. "We can give it a try and see what information we
get," he said. "It's better than getting nothing."
Dean, in his letter, said that in accord with Pres.
Nixon's recent statement on executive privilege. "I must
respectfully decline the invitation of the committee to
formally appear and testify."
Nixon previously had said that no president could
allow the White House lawyer to testify before a
Congressional committee.
But Sen. John Tunney (D-Calif.) said that the White
House's consent to let Dean answer questions in writing
"is a tacit admission that his role in the Watergate case
investigation is relevant to the committee's consideration
of the Gray nomination."
Dollar Continues Comeback
BONN — The dollar soared in unofficial trading in Europe
on yesterday continuing its comeback as preparations
went ahead for further international monetary talks.
Treasury Secretary George P. Shultz flew into Bonn
from Moscow and consulted his top monetary aide on the
eve of his trade and money talks with Chancellor Willy
Brandt.
Along with the rebounding dollar, hopes rose that the
latest crisis would end when official foreign exchanges
reopen Monday after a two-week shutdown.
U.N. Opens Panama Meeting
PANAMA CITY — The U.N. Security Council is opening
its special Panama meeting today with the United States
expected to get harsh criticism from several

Latin-American nations.
The session is the council's first in Latin America and
will provide a first test for John Scali, the newly
appointed U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.
Panama invited the council to meet here so its
members can see what this country calls U.S. colonialism
in the Canal Zone. Other Latin-American countries with
anti-U.S. grievances are expected to add their complaints.
Scali and the U.S. delegation were prepared to defend
U.S. positions on at least four key points in hemisphere
relations:
—Retention of the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay
in Cuba.
—Opposition to some Latin-American nations
extending territorial rights and controlling fishing 200
miles offshore.
—A proposal that Puerto Rico be given independence.
—The activities of multinational companies, specifically
ITT and Kennecott Copper Corp., concerning Chile.
Nixon: Review Death Penalty
WASHINGTON — President Nixon asked Congress
yesterday to reimpose the death penalty for certain
federal crimes and set rigid guidelines under which it
would be applied automatically.
Calling for a massive overhaul of federal criminal laws,
Nixon sent to Capitol Hill the sixth in his series of State
of the Union reports urging that:
—Stiff minimum sentences be required for heroin
traffickers, ranging up to mandatory life imprisonment
without parole for repeated big-time drug violator.
—Tighter restrictions be placed on allowing drug
traffickers free on bail while awaiting trial or sentencing.
—The "unconscionable abuse" of the insanity defense
be eliminated by allowing it only in cases where "the
defendant did not know what he was doing."
Today's Weather
Fair today. Increasing cloudiness tonight then rain likely
at times tomorrow. Cooler tomorrow. Low temperatures
both nights in the mid 30s to mid 40s. High today in the
60s and tomorrow in the mid to upper 50s.

Senate 'Invitation' Rejected
WASHINGTON — Presidential Counsel John W. Dean
yesterday turned down an invitation from the Senate
Judiciary Committee to testify at its hearings on L.
Patrick Gray's nomination to be FBI director. But he said
he would answer relevant detailed questions in writing.
His letter to Chairman James O. Eastland (D-Miss.), left
the next move up to the committee, which invited Dean
to appear for questioning by a 16 to 0 vote Tuesday.
Eastland told a reporter he favored accepting Dean's
offer. "We can give it a try and see what information we
get," he said. "It's better than getting nothing."
Dean, in his letter, said that in accord with Pres.
Nixon's recent statement on executive privilege. "I must
respectfully decline the invitation of the committee to
formally appear and testify."
Nixon previously had said that no president could
allow the White House lawyer to testify before a
Congressional committee.
But Sen. John Tunney (D-Calif.) said that the White
House's consent to let Dean answer questions in writing
"is a tacit admission that his role in the Watergate case
investigation is relevant to the committee's consideration
of the Gray nomination."
Dollar Continues Comeback
BONN — The dollar soared in unofficial trading in Europe
on yesterday continuing its comeback as preparations
went ahead for further international monetary talks.
Treasury Secretary George P. Shultz flew into Bonn
from Moscow and consulted his top monetary aide on the
eve of his trade and money talks with Chancellor Willy
Brandt.
Along with the rebounding dollar, hopes rose that the
latest crisis would end when official foreign exchanges
reopen Monday after a two-week shutdown.
U.N. Opens Panama Meeting
PANAMA CITY — The U.N. Security Council is opening
its special Panama meeting today with the United States
expected to get harsh criticism from several

Latin-American nations.
The session is the council's first in Latin America and
will provide a first test for John Scali, the newly
appointed U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.
Panama invited the council to meet here so its
members can see what this country calls U.S. colonialism
in the Canal Zone. Other Latin-American countries with
anti-U.S. grievances are expected to add their complaints.
Scali and the U.S. delegation were prepared to defend
U.S. positions on at least four key points in hemisphere
relations:
—Retention of the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay
in Cuba.
—Opposition to some Latin-American nations
extending territorial rights and controlling fishing 200
miles offshore.
—A proposal that Puerto Rico be given independence.
—The activities of multinational companies, specifically
ITT and Kennecott Copper Corp., concerning Chile.
Nixon: Review Death Penalty
WASHINGTON — President Nixon asked Congress
yesterday to reimpose the death penalty for certain
federal crimes and set rigid guidelines under which it
would be applied automatically.
Calling for a massive overhaul of federal criminal laws,
Nixon sent to Capitol Hill the sixth in his series of State
of the Union reports urging that:
—Stiff minimum sentences be required for heroin
traffickers, ranging up to mandatory life imprisonment
without parole for repeated big-time drug violator.
—Tighter restrictions be placed on allowing drug
traffickers free on bail while awaiting trial or sentencing.
—The "unconscionable abuse" of the insanity defense
be eliminated by allowing it only in cases where "the
defendant did not know what he was doing."
Today's Weather
Fair today. Increasing cloudiness tonight then rain likely
