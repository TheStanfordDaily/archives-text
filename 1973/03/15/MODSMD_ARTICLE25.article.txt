# Morton Won't Accede To Indian Demands

### ROBERT BACON 
Interior Secretary Rogers C.B. Morton said
during a campus visit yesterday that he will not
comply with the demand of militant Indians that he
visit the village of Wounded Knee, S.D. while it is
beseiged.
But he promised a thorough Interior Department
audit of Sioux tribal affairs to see if the militants'
charges against the tribal government are accurate.
"I'm not gonna meet with anybody with a gun at
my head or a gun at a hostage's head," Morton told
KZSU news.
The secretary is undergoing radiation therapy at
Stanford Medical Center, and is conducting
department business from an office in Menlo Park.
He addressed a meeting of Stanford-in-Washington
interns at Bowman Alumni House yesterday
afternoon, then discussed the Wounded Knee
situation.

Morton said that he felt the occupation of
Wounded Knee was hurting the Indians' cause.
"They're downgrading a tribal government that has
been elected by the tribal people themselves."
He said he had no power to remove the tribal
leadership, as the militant American Indian
Movement (AIM) had demanded.
"It's a Constitutional right that they have to
elect their tribal chairman," Morton explained.
But he promised that, under his "trust
responsibility" for Indian affairs, he would "go over
the operation of that tribal government from A to
Z ... to find out if any of these charges that have
been made by these militant leaders have got any
substance to them."
Any such audit must come after "things quiet
down," Morton emphasized. "I'm not going to go
out there and audit anybody with guns at people's
heads."

Although he emphasized that he would not visit
Wounded Knee during the occupation, he did not
make clear whether he would personally go there
later to meet with Indians.
In the meantime, he said, the Wounded Knee
situation is "a Department of Justice matter" but
that Justice Department officials were in frequent
contact with him and other Interior Department
officials.
Morton said that "the door of the Department of
the Interior has been open ... to all of those [AIM]
leaders, all the time, any time they want to come.
We opened the door when they occupied the
building in Washington."
Last December a group of militant Indians
occupied Bureau of Indian Affairs headquarters for
nearly a week. The Bureau is a division of the
Interior Department.
