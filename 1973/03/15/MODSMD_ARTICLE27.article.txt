## Religion Prof Notes Polarization Brown Examines Church 
### NANCI COLVERT 
"We must not only comfort the
afflicted, but also afflict the
comfortable," Religion Prof. Robert
McAfee Brown said Tuesday night to a
group of about 160 in Memorial
Auditorium.
In his speech, "What's New in
Religion," Brown noted the current
polarization in churches between those
who are placing new emphasis on
"privatized religion and the salvation
of individual souls," and those who

feel the real task of the church is an
outward looking social orientation.
He feels the first trend is on the
rise, but termed it "private, cozy,
luxurious and finally irresponsible."
Preferring social action orientation,
the Interim Dean of the Chapel stated,
"To make a choice between the two is
to be confronted with a phony issue.
'Need of Other'
"Each dimension has need of
the other. The Bible instructs us not
only to love God with all our hearts,

but to love our neighbor as ourselves.
"It states, 'If a man says he loves
God and hates his neighbor, he is a
liar," he said.
Brown sees the churches in the
ecumenical movement as having
turned away from debating such
internal issues as the apostolic
succession and the meaning of the
Lord's Supper to combining their
resources to cope with the massive
social issues of poverty, oppression,
and war.
Turning Point
He marked the turning point in this
shift as the 1966 conference of the
World Council of Churches in Geneva
whose theme was "Christians in the
Social and Technological Revolutions
of Our Time."
It was the first time in the council's
history that Catholics and many Third
World countries participated, and that
laymen outnumbered clergy.
Third World peoples see the theme
of the Bible as not love, or
reconciliation, but liberation he said.
"For them the Exodus story is of
Yahweh freeing peoples, slaves, in a
liberation not from sin, but from
economic and political structures.
"They say, 'That's our story; God
affirms our right to liberation,' " he
stated.
College Students
Brown also cited seveval trends in
the religion of college students.
"Something that was very old is
again new—a quasi-fundamentalism
which is Biblically based, individually
centered and theologically
conservative.
Its emphasis is on individual
witnessing, and presents clear answers
to the deepest problems," he said.
Brown criticized this trend for
being "very inward."
"They [college students] have
rediscovered the Bible. I live in the
hope that they will rediscover the
world," he stated.
Eastern Religions
In reference to current interest in
Eastern religions on college campuses,
Brown stated that he feels it is due to
the failure of Judeo-Christian religions
to get through, and a desire for a
highly disciplned kind of existence.
"Today the question is not one of
atheism, but of polytheism—not, 'Do
you believe in God,' but, 'Which God
do you believe in,' " he said.
Brown also stated that religion
deals with ultimate concerns, that
whatever the heart clings to is its God.
"In this sense, communism is a religion
and its power is not recognized unless
it is viewed in this way," he said.
Brown's talk was part of the
Tuesday evening lecture series
sponsored by the Office of Public
Events.
