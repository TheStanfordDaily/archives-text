## 
### SUE KING 
After a lengthy debate, the ASSU
Senate Tuesday night defeated two
proposed resolutions from the Finance
Committee pertaining to fee
assessments, and sent a third back to
the committee for revision.
In other business, the Senate set a
date for the spring quarter ASSU
Presidential elections and certified the
results of the Feb. 28-March 1 special
fee assessment election.
Resolution 73-11, the more
important of the two defeated
resolutions according to co-author Bob
Barker, states that the Senate
recommends that the ASSU Program
Fee Assessment for 1973-74 be made
voluntary. This would be implemented
by providing a space on the Permit to
Register for the student to indicate his
willingness to pay the fee.
In the other defeated resolution,
73-10, the Senate recommends that:
—students in debt to the University
on or before March 1, 1973, for
payment of past refundable fee
assessments be released from that
debt, and
—from now on, payment of
refundable fee assessments shall not be
required past the second week of the
quarter in which the assessment is
levied.
The resolution sent back to the

Finance Committee pertains to the use
of ASSU Program funds by
organizations receiving these funds.
Since several senators felt that the
meaning of the resolution was unclear,
the Senate voted to send the
resolution back to committee for
re-wording.
Barker and Dan Fitch, co-authors
of Resolution 73-11, plan to "make an
issue of it next quarter," according to
Barker.
"We'll try bringing it to the Senate
agai.i at the first meeting of next
quarter," said Barker. "Perhaps we will
ask for a student referendum. We
would certainly encourage students
who agree with us to air their views."
The ASSU Presidential election will
be held April 18 and 19. Tuesday four
students announced their candidacy
for ASSU Council of Presidents — Jim
Friend, Beth Garfield, Charles Ogletree
and Kevin O'Grady.
Also included on the April ballot
will be the ASSU Program Fee
Assessment, which will provide
funding for 22 campus organizations.
Listed will be a breakdown of the
groups requesting funds through the
program fee, the amount of money
that they requested, the tentative
amount agreed upon by the Finance
Committee, and the percentage of the
total assessment that each group will
receive.
