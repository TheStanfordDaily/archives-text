# Trustees Approve '73-'74 Budget
## 
### MARK SIMONIAN 
University Trustees Tuesday
approved a $73.8 million operating
budget for the 1973-74 academic year
marked by increased efforts to curb
rising costs and a 10 percent rise in
tuition.
The operating budget, which
encompasses all of the University's
unrestricted funds, will represent
approximately one-third of the entire
$223 million projected expenditure
budget. Expenditures for sponsored
research, the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center (SLAC), student
housing and athletics and the
University hospital are not covered by
the operating budget.
While the operating budget includes
a $5.5 million increase in expenditures
over the current fiscal year, more than
four million dollars of that growth will
be used to cover salary increases and
cost rises in current programs. The rate

of growth in the budget was trimmed
from 9.7 percent last year to an
expected 8.1 percent.
New Funding
An additional $900,000 will be
used to provide long-term funding for
prior commitments. New programs
will receive $560,000 for permanent
funding. About 90 percent of these
new programs are in the academic
sector.
The increase in tuition, announced
last fall, will account for almost half of
operating budget revenue increases
during 1973-74. The hike from $2850
this year to $3135 next fall is
expected to net the University $2.5
million.
The tuition increases may affect
graduate students, many of whom will
lose federal financial aid. Vice Provost
for Budget and Planning Raymond F.
Bacchetti noted that the graduate
student aid issue is "in flux" and that
"further study is required to know
what assumptions are valid."
University salaries for the next
academic year will rise an average six
percent for nonacademic staff
members and 5.25 percent for faculty
and administrators. The pay boosts are
expected to move University salaries
from a position "slightly below
average" to "one solidly centered in
the market place" compared to
commercial wages in the mid-peninsula
area.
Offsetting the increase in faculty

salaries is the size of the teaching staff
which last year increased seven persons
to 1035. Next year, only "modest"
additions, mostly in the School of
Medicine, will be made to that total.
The current operating deficit of
$600,000 will be cut in half. The
1973-74 year will be the fourth in the
Budget Adjustment Program (BAP)
aimed at bringing expenditures and
income into balance by 1974-75.
Provost William F. Miller stated
Friday at a press conference that he
was "still unsure" of the effects of
federal research grant cutbacks to
SLAC and the Medical Center. He
indicated, however, that University
funds would definitely not support
SLAC, regardless of cutbacks.
Miller and Bacchetti, who
developed the basic budget guidelines
presented to the Trustees Tuesday,
termed the financial outlook u a
dynamic steady state."
The vice provost announced some
of the "important" new expenditures
for the coming year at a budget
briefing Friday:
—$75,000 to the School of
Medicine primarily for growth in
faculty;
—$55,000 for full funding of the
Learning Assistance Center and the
Writing Center;
—$33,000 to mail Courses and
Degrees to selected high schools and to
all freshmen admitted;
—$30,000 for instruction in the

new history program (replacing
Western Civilization studies);
—$25,000 to the School of
Humanities and Sciences to fund
permanently a position in
photography instruction in the art
department, and to fund an additional
assistant professorship in linguistics;
—$22,000 to the School of
Education to fund a position for a
coordinator of teacher intern
assignments and a position for a half
time instructor in the teaching of
reading;
—$20,000 in an experimental fund
for the Dean of Students to respond
on a short-term basis to changing
student interests and needs;
—and $15,000 to increase
counselling for minority students and
to support minority student recruiting.
Copies of the Operating Budget
Guidelines will be available tomorrow
for students in the Academic Planning
Office.
The Board of Trustees also
approved voluntary early retirement
for faculty members between the ages
of 60 and 65.
The experimental program, one of
the first in a major national university,
provides for retirement after 15 years
of service and for an allowance
independent of other current
retirement benefits. The allowance can
range from about $2000 to about
$10,000 annually, according to Miller.

for the Dean of Students to respond
on a short-term basis to changing
student interests and needs;
—and $15,000 to increase
counselling for minority students and

Copies of the Operating Budget
Guidelines will be available tomorrow
for students in the Academic Planning
Office.
The Board of Trustees also
approved voluntary early retirement
for faculty members between the ages
of 60 and 65.
The experimental program, one of
the first in a major national university,
provides for retirement after 15 years
of service and for an allowance
independent of other current
retirement benefits. The allowance can
range from about $2000 to about
$10,000 annually, according to Miller.
University Trustees Tuesday
approved a $73.8 million operating
budget for the 1973-74 academic year
marked by increased efforts to curb
rising costs and a 10 percent rise in
tuition.
The operating budget, which
encompasses all of the University's
unrestricted funds, will represent
approximately one-third of the entire
$223 million projected expenditure
budget. Expenditures for sponsored
research, the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center (SLAC), student
housing and athletics and the
University hospital are not covered by
the operating budget.
While the operating budget includes
a $5.5 million increase in expenditures
over the current fiscal year, more than
four million dollars of that growth will
be used to cover salary increases and
cost rises in current programs. The rate

of growth in the budget was trimmed
from 9.7 percent last year to an
expected 8.1 percent.
New Funding
An additional $900,000 will be
used to provide long-term funding for
prior commitments. New programs
will receive $560,000 for permanent
funding. About 90 percent of these
new programs are in the academic
sector.
The increase in tuition, announced
last fall, will account for almost half of
operating budget revenue increases
during 1973-74. The hike from $2850
this year to $3135 next fall is
expected to net the University $2.5
million.
The tuition increases may affect
graduate students, many of whom will
lose federal financial aid. Vice Provost
for Budget and Planning Raymond F.
Bacchetti noted that the graduate
student aid issue is "in flux" and that
"further study is required to know
what assumptions are valid."
University salaries for the next
academic year will rise an average six
percent for nonacademic staff
members and 5.25 percent for faculty
and administrators. The pay boosts are
expected to move University salaries
from a position "slightly below
average" to "one solidly centered in
the market place" compared to
commercial wages in the mid-peninsula
area.
Offsetting the increase in faculty

salaries is the size of the teaching staff
which last year increased seven persons
to 1035. Next year, only "modest"
additions, mostly in the School of
Medicine, will be made to that total.
The current operating deficit of
$600,000 will be cut in half. The
1973-74 year will be the fourth in the
Budget Adjustment Program (BAP)
aimed at bringing expenditures and
income into balance by 1974-75.
Provost William F. Miller stated
Friday at a press conference that he
was "still unsure" of the effects of
federal research grant cutbacks to
SLAC and the Medical Center. He
indicated, however, that University
funds would definitely not support
SLAC, regardless of cutbacks.
Miller and Bacchetti, who
developed the basic budget guidelines
presented to the Trustees Tuesday,
termed the financial outlook u a
dynamic steady state."
The vice provost announced some
of the "important" new expenditures
for the coming year at a budget
briefing Friday:
—$75,000 to the School of
Medicine primarily for growth in
faculty;
—$55,000 for full funding of the
Learning Assistance Center and the
Writing Center;
—$33,000 to mail Courses and
Degrees to selected high schools and to
all freshmen admitted;
—$30,000 for instruction in the

new history program (replacing

the market place" compared to
commercial wages in the mid-peninsula
area.
Offsetting the increase in faculty

salaries is the size of the teaching staff
which last year increased seven persons
to 1035. Next year, only "modest"
additions, mostly in the School of
Medicine, will be made to that total.
The current operating deficit of
$600,000 will be cut in half. The
1973-74 year will be the fourth in the
Budget Adjustment Program (BAP)
aimed at bringing expenditures and
income into balance by 1974-75.
Provost William F. Miller stated
Friday at a press conference that he
was "still unsure" of the effects of
federal research grant cutbacks to
SLAC and the Medical Center. He
indicated, however, that University
funds would definitely not support
SLAC, regardless of cutbacks.
Miller and Bacchetti, who
developed the basic budget guidelines
presented to the Trustees Tuesday,
termed the financial outlook u a
dynamic steady state."
The vice provost announced some
of the "important" new expenditures
for the coming year at a budget
briefing Friday:
—$75,000 to the School of
Medicine primarily for growth in
faculty;
—$55,000 for full funding of the
Learning Assistance Center and the
Writing Center;
—$33,000 to mail Courses and
Degrees to selected high schools and to
all freshmen admitted;
—$30,000 for instruction in the

new history program (replacing
Western Civilization studies);
—$25,000 to the School of
Humanities and Sciences to fund
permanently a position in
photography instruction in the art
department, and to fund an additional
assistant professorship in linguistics;
—$22,000 to the School of
Education to fund a position for a
coordinator of teacher intern
assignments and a position for a half
time instructor in the teaching of
reading;
—$20,000 in an experimental fund
for the Dean of Students to respond
on a short-term basis to changing
student interests and needs;
—and $15,000 to increase
counselling for minority students and
to support minority student recruiting.
Copies of the Operating Budget
Guidelines will be available tomorrow
for students in the Academic Planning
Office.
The Board of Trustees also
approved voluntary early retirement
for faculty members between the ages
of 60 and 65.
The experimental program, one of
the first in a major national university,
provides for retirement after 15 years
of service and for an allowance
independent of other current
retirement benefits. The allowance can
range from about $2000 to about
$10,000 annually, according to Miller.
