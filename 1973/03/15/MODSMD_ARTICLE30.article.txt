# 45 Overseas Students Stranded By French Air Controllers' Strike
## 
### PETER ALESHIRE 
If you've got friends coming home
from the overseas campuses this
quarter you may see them tomorrow;
but then again, you may not.
At least 45 students from the
French, German, and Italian campuses
have been stranded in France by an air
controllers' strike there.
Seventy-two students from the
three campuses were scheduled to
return on an Air France charter flight
last Thursday and Friday, but the
flight was cancelled due to the strike.
Some students have returned on
their own, but many remain in France.
French air controllers walked off
their jobs several weeks ago demanding
higher wages and the official right to
strike. Military controllers took over
directing air traffic, but after more

than 60 were killed in a mid-air
collision over southern France, the
international pilots association refused
to fly over French air-space.
Planes Grounded
Most Air France planes are
grounded, although there are several
other airlines still flying into Paris,
including TWA and Pan Am. Students
could get back to the United States on
either of these airlines, but regular
one-way fare is about $360, while the
Air France charter fare is $142.
Air France says it will have a flight
today assuming the air controllers
strike is settled. However, according to
sophomore Ken Fink, who returned
from France Sunday, the word on
when flights are leaving has been
changing constantly.
Last week Fink discovered his own

special way home. He got a package
dealâ€”a ticket from Paris to San
Francisco plus a trip from Montreal to
Reykjavik, Iceland.
'Weird Place'
"I don't know how the Iceland
thing got on there," Fink said, "it
seems like a weird place to have a
ticket to." Fink said he would now
probably try to sell his ticket through
the Daily.
Fink didn't seem too confident that
the charter flight will actually get off
the ground today. "Nobody could
keep up with what the latest word was
because by the time it had filtered
down to us it had changed half the
time," he said.
Fink said there were about 30
people left at the Tours campus on
Sunday, along with another 30

students from the Italian Campus
staying in Paris, waiting for the charter
flight out. The rest of the students he
said, had drifted off to find their own
way home.
Refunds offered
Fink said Air France offered
refunds on Saturday, and also offered
to loan spending money to student
stranded in Paris waiting for the
charter.
"Everyone timed it to run out of
money by the end of the quarter,"
Fink said, and few students had
enough to buy a ticket home.
At one point Air France announed
that they would have a flight out
Monday with a few seats on it.
Students at Tours drew lots for the
available seats, but the flight was
cancelled Monday morning.
Stay At Campus?
For a while it looked like the
students at the French campus
wouldn't be able to stay at the campus
to wait for their flight. But University
officials convinced the French campus
landlords to let the students stay, Fink
said.
He noted that University officials
overseas did a pretty good job under
the circumstances. "I was extremely
surprised at how hard the people at
Stanford-in-France worked in trying to
line up a plane," he said.
Meanwhile overseas campus
officials here are waiting also.
Assistant Director of Overseas
Campuses Corb Smith, said he wasn't
sure how many students had gotten
back so far, or how long the remaining
students would be stranded by the
strike. He said the University notified
all the parents of stuck students of
the probem on Saturday. University
officials are trying to keep up with the
confusing events, Smith said.
Students who paid for the charter
flights, and find their own way back
will apparently be able to get refunds
through the overseas campus office.
