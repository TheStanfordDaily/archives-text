# City Wins Bach Mai Vote Case; Peace Groups Appeal Decision
## 
### ROBERT BACON 
A Santa Clara County Superior Court judge Monday
refused to order an election on the controversial Palo Alto
Bach Mai initiative. Proponents: of the measure yesterday
asked an appellate court to reverse the decision.
Judge Richard W. Rhodes in San Jose ruled that the
Palo Alto City Council was within its powers when it
declined to place the initiative on the May 8 municipal
ballot, despite the fact that sufficient signatures had been
collected on initiative petitions.
The initiative would appropriate $50,000 in city funds
to help rebuild the bombed Bach Mai Hospital in Hanoi.
City Att. Peter Stone claims such a donation of tax funds
would be unlawful.
Larry Sleizer, an attorney for the American Civil
Liberties Union yesterday asked the State Court of
Appeal in San Francisco to order the election.
Deadline Tomorrow
Printers must begin to prepare the ballots tomorrow,
and it is questionable whether a court order can be
obtained by then.
Stone said yesterday afternoon that, barring action by
the appellate court, the ballots would be prepared without
the Bach Mai initiative.
Sleizer asked the appellate court to order the measure
onto the ballot, and then hold a hearing on its validity
before the election. "If they find it's invalid, the city can
just not count the votes on it,"he pointed out.
Court Costs
In dismissing the suit, Rhodes also ordered the four to
pay the costs incurred by the city in arguing against the
suit.
He did not state the reasons for his decision.
Stanford law student Tom Burke, one of the
petitioners in the suit, called the requirement that the
proponents pay the city's costs "totally unreasonable."
He expressed hope that if the Court of Appeal orders the
election, it will also relieve them of the requirement to
pay-
Stone is as yet unsure of the total costs.

The four petitioners are veteran peace activist Douglas
Mattern, Venceremos member Jeffrey Youdelman, Burke,
and Jerod Peterson.
They led a drive which collected more than 2000
signatures on initiative petitions for the measure last
month. The petitioners claim that the city council had no
choice in the matter â€” that it was required to order an
election on the initiative.
The council voted 6-3 on Feb. 26 not to put the
measure on the ballot, after Stone told them that, in his
opinion, it would be illegal.
Waste Of Money
Stone insists that for several reasons a gift of public
funds to North Vietnam is unlawful, and that therefore an
election on the question would be meaningless and awaste
of money.
Attorneys for the measure's supporters argued before
Rhodes last week that, since the issues were complex and
the time short, he should order the election. They said
that the measure's validity should be argued in court only
if the voters approved it in May.
Burke and Sleizer both said yesterday that their
principal problem now will be obtaining an order from the
appellate court in time to put the measure on the ballot.
Sleizer emphasized that if the petitioners are to win the
case, they must win before Friday. "The lack of time
makes our argument stronger," he said. It won't hurt the
city any if it's put on the ballot and then ruled invalid,"
he noted.
The ACLU did not participate in the Superior Court
proceedings. Sleizer said that since that time, the
organization's officials have examined the merits of the
initiative and found it "arguably valid. We think it's a
good case; otherwise we wouldn't take it."
Sleizer explained that, in order to save time, rather
than appealing Rhodes' decision, he was filing a new
original petition with the Court of Appeal.
Stone said yesterday, "It's difficult to see how they
can file an original petition when they're already lost in
the trial court."
