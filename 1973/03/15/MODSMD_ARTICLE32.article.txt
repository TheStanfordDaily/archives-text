# Prof Examines China's Rapid Growth
## 
### CHRISTY WISE 
Emphasizing China's rapid, widespread industrial
growth, Economics Prof. John Gurley, a recent
visitor to the People's Republic of China, Sunday
afternoon discussed Marxism and Chinese economic
development.
The Chinese, said Gurley, are serious about
moving from what he desribed as the feudal society
existing prior to 1949, "through socialism into what
they visualize as a full communist society."
What the Chinese mean by communism, Gurley
explained, "is a wealthy society."
He described this as a classless, equalitarian,
planned society which produces an ample amount
of the necessities of life for everyone: "A society in
which the means of production are not privately
owned, but owned by all the people." The goods,
continued Gurley, are distributed according to need,
not work.
'Serving the People'
Gurley, who spoke to a large group in Jordan
Hall, said the Chinese believe in "serving the
people."
Widespread industrialization in China includes
small rural industry as well as the large industry in
the city. Gurley added, "More industry comes from
the country than from the city."
In the small industries, such as small-scale
steel-making plants on communes, "they're making
whatever they can," said Gurley.
There is a merger of intellectual and manual
work in the country and the city. Gurley explained
that the Chinese visualize that 50 years from now,
the differences between the city and the
countryside will disappear.

A person raised in the country, the Chinese feel,
should get just as much education and culture as a
city-born person.
This is currently being done with a requirement
that city students spend two years working and
studying rural life and that manual laborers spend a
few hours each week in intellectual discussion
groups.
Economic "Juggling" Rejected
If a capitalistic economist were to try to suggest
a "juggling" economic plan to the Chinese such as
lowering capital input and increasing labor, their
answer, according to Gurley, would be "we'll all
work together for social goals."
"I don't think at this point there are many
people unemployed in China," said Gurley.
Twenty percent of the national income is saved
and invested for economic development. Gurley said
most of the surplus generated in a geographic region
stays in that area and the community decides what
to do with it.
Rapid Industrialization
Gurley related some of the historical background
of China's industrial and agricultural success. The
strategy following the 1949-1952 land reform—in
which the landlord class was eliminated—was to
industrialize as rapidly as possible.
A labor force was mobilized; Russian experts
helped train factory workers and socialization began
in the countryside. Agricultural production
increased, explained Gurley, until 1957, when
output reached a plateau.
The need for heavy industry to bring about
agriculture mechanization and to build up defense,
and the need for money to pay back Soviet loans

prompted the Chinese to develop a plan to
accelerate the economic growth rate.
Social Reorganization
This involved dam construction, water control
projects, small factories and industrial activity. The
plan worked until weather problems and sentiment
that social organization was being pushed too fast
created a "complete falling out" in spirits as well as
gross national product and everything else," said
Gurley.
A reordering of priorities as well as a return to
communist ideology was needed. Gurley explained
that the return of the Mao Faction helped the
Chinese develop an "exceptionally good record,"
with widespread industrialization and agriculture.
Guriey will speak tonight at the Children's
Theater Auditorium at the Palo Alto Cultural
Center (Middlefield and Melville). The eight o'clock
speech is part of a bi-weekly "Town and Gown"
lecture series.
