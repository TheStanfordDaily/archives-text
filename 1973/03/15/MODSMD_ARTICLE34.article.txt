# Law School Application Rate Decreases

### CHESS ERWIN 
Applications for admission to
the incoming Law School class of
1976 have declined "about 20
percent" from last year's total
according to preliminary figures
released by Associate Dean of
Admissions of the Law School
William Keogh.

All the applications for 1973
are not in yet, but Keogh said that
he expected to receive about 3200
applications for the upcoming
year. Figures for 1971 indicated
that the Office of Admissions in
the school had received 3800
applications. Last year slightly
over 4000 were submitted.

Keogh believes the decline
could be attributed to a number
of factors. The primary factor "is
the difficulty of admission to our
Law School itself." The mean
grade point average of applicants
who have applied so far for 1973
is approximately 3.75 compared
to 3.65 a year ago.

Law School Admissions Test
(LSAT) mean scores are also up
slightly to about 700-705 on a
scale of 800. The LSAT is a
general aptitude test used in the
law school admissions procedure
much as the Scholastic Aptitude
Test (SAT) is used at the
undergraduate level. A score of

700 puts the individual in the
upper three percent of the
students who have taken the test.
Keogh said that unlike in
previous years, those applicants
who normally would not have a
very good chance of acceptance
seem to be shying away.
The decline could also be due
to the Law School's effort to
explain the facts of admission
more fully to prospective
applicants, the dean explained.
Stanford, for example, is the
first of the "big-name" law
schools to publish a grid-profile of
its entering class in the Pre-Law
Handbook. The handbook is
published by the Educational
Testing Service, which administers
the LSAT.
Nationwide, the upward spiral
in applications has apparently
leveled off too, Keogh added.
