# PA Clinic Won't Move To Campus
## 
### ROBERT BACON 
The University has no land
close to the Medical Center to
offer for a new Palo Alto Medical
Clinic (PAMC) building, according
to University Vice President
Robert R. Augsburger.
PAMC had been negotiating
with the University for several
months over possible lease of such
land to the clinic.
In a letter to the clinic last
week, made public Tuesday,
Augsburger said that no parcel of
University land is available that
would meet PAMC's needs.
Outgrowing Facilities
The clinic, which is rapidly
outgrowing its facilities at 300
Homer Avenue in downtown Palo
Alto, will now study possible
expansion of its present facilities.
Last month, PAMC asked the
city to permit expansion of the
main clinic building from three
stories to five, in case no
agreement was reached with

Stanford.
That application has now been
withdrawn. PAMC officials say
they want to study expansion
possibilities more carefully now
that there appears to be no
alternative to augmenting the
facilities on the present site.
Hospital Vote
In June 1970, when voters
refused to permit PAMC to build
a hospital adjacent to its clinic,
opponents of the hospital said
that University land was available
for whatever facilities the clinic
might need.
Although the hospital plan was
abandoned last year, PAMC
continued its interest in a new site
for their clinic, and University
land near Stanford Medical Center
was their first choice for a site.
Last May, Clayton Rich,
University Vice President for
Medical Affairs, offered to lease
University land to PAMC. Clinic
and University officials had been

negotiating the subject since that
time.
Walking Distance
The clinic sought a site within
walking distance of Stanford
Hospital, for the convenience of
doctors and patients.
University officials describe the
land extending from the Medical
Center uphill toward the golf

course as the most important
vacant parcel of land being
reserved for future academic use.
The 45-acre vacant lot across
Willow Road is more than a
quarter mile from the Medical
Center. Also, it is much larger
than PAMC would need and
University officials are hesitant to
subdivide it.
