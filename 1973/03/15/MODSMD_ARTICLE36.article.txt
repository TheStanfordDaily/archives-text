# Stanford Loses Zoning Plea
## 
### 
The Palo Alto City Council, over University
opposition, approved agricultural zoning for four
Stanford-owned Coyote Hill industrial lots Monday
night.
The lots, between Coyote Hill and Page Mill
Road just above Foothill Expressway, are under a
scenic restriction which forbids development for 20
years on three of the lots and for 51 years on the
other.
University officials had asked for a more modest
zone change, seeking to keep the lots in industrial
designation, but to give city officials power to
review the design of any buildings which might be
built on the lots.
University Associate Staff Counsel Michael
Hudnall, told the council that, should the lots be
condemned for public use, the scenic restriction
would not apply. In that case, he said, the
University would be paid much more for the land if
it were in industrial zoning rather than agricultural

zoning.
Hudnall told the council that the scenic
restriction will cost Stanford $3 million in lease fees
because industrial tenants won't be able to build on
the land.
The council voted 6-3 for the agricultural
classification. Councilmen John V. Beahrs, John J.
Berwald, and William H. Clark supported Stanford's
position.
Supporters of the agricultural zoning pointed out
that condemnation was extremely unlikely, and
that, when the scenic restriction was about to
expire, the zoning could be re-examined and
possibly changed.
The scenic restriction was imposed in an
out-of-court settlement of a lawsuit against
development of Coyote Hill. The suit, brought in
1969 by the environmentalist Committee for Green
Foothills, was settled last fall.
