# SCIRE Course Studies Gay Culture And History
## 
### JOANNE JACOBS 
Room 200Q is one of those
basement cubicles in the History
Corner, dingy and depressing,
with lines of sagging plastic chairs.
On a recent Tuesday afternoon,
200Q was filled to overflowing.

A predominately female crowd
of sixty showed up to hear poet
Lynda Koolish and Del Martin
and Phyllis Lyon, authors of
Lesbian Women, discuss their
experiences as gay women.
It was the largest crowd that

SCTR 199, "The Myth, Culture
and History of the Homosexual"
has drawn. Most of the weekly
guest speakers have discussed male
homosexuality and have attracted
largely male audiences of 25 or
more.
It is a strange course, unique at
Stanford. "Straight" students feel
nervous about attending; some
"gay" students do not want the
course name to appear on their
study lists or transcripts.
Only seven students are
officially enrolled, as far as
instructor Joel Roberts, a local
gay activist, knows. But Roberts
believes that ten percent of the
Stanford community may be
homosexual.
Phone Calls
"I still get phone calls in the
middle of the night asking, 'where
can I meet gay people?' They're
afraid to come to GPU [Gay
People's Union] meetings, afraid
to write 'homosexual' on a class
card."
"Nobody's fucking come out
here," Koolish, a graduate student
in Modern Thought and
Literature, declared. "This is a
very scary place to come out."
Roberts comments, "Since
SCIRE has given me the
opportunity to teach a gay course,
I have had the wonderful and
disturbing experience of meeting
faculty, staff and students who
are secretly gay. I hope my course
and the gay seminar I'll offer
through SCIRE next quarter will
start to raise the consciousness of
all the Stanford community, so
that my gay sisters and brothers
can soon live more freely and
fully."
Liberating Aspects
Tuesday's speakers emphasized
the positive, liberating aspects of

homosexuality. Koolish read with
feeling from her recently
published book, Journeys on the
Living, "There is so little love in
this world/ that a merging,
however evanescent,/ of any two
people's lives/ should be a
celebration."
A student in the audience
commented, "I was a good wife
for three years in a gay
relationship which was just as
ridiculous as playing that role in a
straight relationship. A person
should be a person, not a role."
A historical perspective was
provided by Martin and Lyon,
middle-aged women who have
maintained a sexual relationship
for twenty years. They helped
found the Daughters of Bilitis in
1955 as a social club for gay
women, a means of bypassing the
"pick up scene" of the gay bar.
The Daughters of Bilitis has
become the most prominent
national organization of lesbians.
Lesbian Love Poem
The name came from the
supposed authoress of a narrative
lesbian love poem. "We were
looking for a name that would
mean something to gay women
and mean nothing at all to the
public at large," Lyon explained.
Coming out was "a very
frightening thing in the fifties,"
she recalled. "When I was going to
school I'd never heard the word
'lesbian.' " As Martin and Lyon
lecture around the country, they
still receive letters saying, "I
didn't know there was anyone else
like me."
The women went on to discuss
the role of lesbians in the
women's liberation movement.
Martin recently won election to
the board of directors of the
National Organization for Women,

whose president, Betty Friedan,
has been hostile to lesbian
involvement. Martin is pushing for
an end to discrimination on the
basis of sexual orientation as well
as sex itself.
'Give A Damn'
"We need a society
where it's possible for women to
explore their feelings. I don't
want to have to give a damn about
what a person's sexual orientation
is." Koolish added.
Martin and Lyon raised the
problems of adoption, child
raising, joint ownership of
property, and laws regulating
"moral offenses."
The women also mentioned the
gay studies program at
Sacramento State where bisexual
writer Kate Millet is currently a
visiting professor. Koolish wants
to teach at the university level,
but, "It's tough to get a job as a
lesbian feminist."
Gay Studies Program
Roberts hopes to see a gay
studies program here some day."I
wanted this class to give birth to
other courses," he explains. He
will teach next quarter and
sponsor independent study
projects. Psychology Prof. Sandra
Bern urged Roberts to teach the
class. He notes, "At every point T
expected to be stopped. But it
didn't worry me."
Roberts has studied
psychology and anthropology in
New York and California,
organized street queens and
hustlers in San Francisco's
Tenderloin, been a prostitute,
edited a "head" newspaper in
Haight-Ashbury, worked for the
poverty program.
'Gayness Is The Center'
"My gayness is the center from
which everything else grows," he

explains. Since moving to the
Peninsula, he has operated a gay
switchboard, done counseling, and
lectured at churches and high
schools. "I do it because everyone
else has to be safe," he declares.
"I have nothing to lose."
Roberts finds students here
naive, but he is pleased with the
development of his students.
"Most people had no awareness of
gay people." Now, he says, "My
students are writing more, trying
to say more. They have more
awareness of gay issues."
Student Faye Thompson feels
Roberts has slighted the historical
aspect of the course, which was
originally her main interest.
However she says,"I hope to get a
better understanding of
homosexuality, to get rid of the
stereotype of the lisping pansy. I
think I'm getting that out of it."
Course Theme
Roberts explains that the
theme of the course is expressed
in Eric Bentley's essay, "Men's
Liberation": "What is now
demanded of society is not
tolerance of a perversion,
permissiveness toward behavior
that is seen as bizarre, ludicrous,
unsavory, or immoral; but
approval of liberation,
endorsement of a positive
development in human history."
Thompson disagrees. "I think
the Bible is specific on the sin of
homosexuality. It's really not
natural." She feels that gay people
attending the class reinforce each
other. "It's good that they're
coming out, but I don't think
society should openly accept or
encourage that kind of behavior."
Confident that homosexuality
"is not what God intends," she
says,"I don't feel at all afraid to
speak up. The classes have been

really open despite the fact that
I'm the only person to come out
against homosexuality."
'Yechhh'
She asked her "really close
Christian friends" what they
thought of her taking the course.
"Most said 'yechhh.' " However,
"I found out that a close friend of
mine was homosexual."
Thompson calls the class, "The
most unusual I've taken at
Stanford — and the most
unintellectual." Course work
involves written evaluations of
readings and speakers. A final
project may be required. "It
shouldn't be given for credit and
also not to give a false view of
what the course is going to be and
not draw in politicians and
policemen."
Her feelings are mixed. "I
think almost every time I go there
I get a headache." Yet, "I'm really
glad I'm taking it."
Not Typical
Obviously, Thompson is not
one of Roberts' typical students,
although she believes it is good for
the class to hear a Christian point
of view. Roberts argues that, "The
whole culture has to learn to play
with ideas it doesn't like."
His course next quarter on
"The Homosexual: Martyr or
Liberator?" will focus on cultural
phenomena such as the "mascara
rock" of David Bowie, Alice
Cooper, and others.
"Maybe because of the drug
experience, electronic media, the
technocratic society, we're going
to have a new awareness,"
Roberts believes.
Although he says he is not
propagating homosexuality in his
course, Roberts declares, "You
validate an experience when you
teach about it."

awareness of gay issues."
Student Faye Thompson feels
Roberts has slighted the historical
aspect of the course, which was
originally her main interest.
However she says,"I hope to get a
better understanding of
homosexuality, to get rid of the
stereotype of the lisping pansy. I
think I'm getting that out of it."
Course Theme
Roberts explains that the
theme of the course is expressed
in Eric Bentley's essay, "Men's
Liberation": "What is now
demanded of society is not
tolerance of a perversion,
permissiveness toward behavior
that is seen as bizarre, ludicrous,
unsavory, or immoral; but
approval of liberation,
endorsement of a positive
development in human history."
Thompson disagrees. "I think
the Bible is specific on the sin of
homosexuality. It's really not
natural." She feels that gay people
attending the class reinforce each
other. "It's good that they're
coming out, but I don't think
society should openly accept or
encourage that kind of behavior."
Confident that homosexuality
"is not what God intends," she
says,"I don't feel at all afraid to
speak up. The classes have been

really open despite the fact that
I'm the only person to come out
against homosexuality."
'Yechhh'
She asked her "really close
Christian friends" what they
thought of her taking the course.
"Most said 'yechhh.' " However,
"I found out that a close friend of
mine was homosexual."
Thompson calls the class, "The
most unusual I've taken at
Stanford — and the most
unintellectual." Course work
involves written evaluations of
readings and speakers. A final
project may be required. "It
shouldn't be given for credit and
also not to give a false view of
what the course is going to be and
not draw in politicians and
policemen."
Her feelings are mixed. "I
think almost every time I go there
I get a headache." Yet, "I'm really
glad I'm taking it."
Not Typical
Obviously, Thompson is not
one of Roberts' typical students,
although she believes it is good for
the class to hear a Christian point
of view. Roberts argues that, "The
whole culture has to learn to play
with ideas it doesn't like."
His course next quarter on
"The Homosexual: Martyr or
Liberator?" will focus on cultural
phenomena such as the "mascara
rock" of David Bowie, Alice
Cooper, and others.

technocratic society, we're going

Roberts believes.

GAY STUDIES—Lynda Koolish, poet, photographer and artist, read
some of her poems and discussed her experiences as a Lesbian woman
to an overflew crowd at a recent meeting of "The Myth, History and
Culture of the Homosexual," a SCIRE sponsored course.
Room 200Q is one of those
basement cubicles in the History
Corner, dingy and depressing,
with lines of sagging plastic chairs.
On a recent Tuesday afternoon,
200Q was filled to overflowing.

A predominately female crowd
of sixty showed up to hear poet
Lynda Koolish and Del Martin
and Phyllis Lyon, authors of
Lesbian Women, discuss their
experiences as gay women.
It was the largest crowd that

SCTR 199, "The Myth, Culture
and History of the Homosexual"
has drawn. Most of the weekly
guest speakers have discussed male
homosexuality and have attracted
largely male audiences of 25 or
more.
It is a strange course, unique at
Stanford. "Straight" students feel
nervous about attending; some
"gay" students do not want the
course name to appear on their
study lists or transcripts.
Only seven students are
officially enrolled, as far as
instructor Joel Roberts, a local
gay activist, knows. But Roberts
believes that ten percent of the
Stanford community may be
homosexual.
Phone Calls
"I still get phone calls in the
middle of the night asking, 'where
can I meet gay people?' They're
afraid to come to GPU [Gay
People's Union] meetings, afraid
to write 'homosexual' on a class
card."
"Nobody's fucking come out
here," Koolish, a graduate student
in Modern Thought and
Literature, declared. "This is a
very scary place to come out."
Roberts comments, "Since
SCIRE has given me the
opportunity to teach a gay course,
I have had the wonderful and
disturbing experience of meeting
faculty, staff and students who
are secretly gay. I hope my course
and the gay seminar I'll offer
through SCIRE next quarter will
start to raise the consciousness of
all the Stanford community, so
that my gay sisters and brothers
can soon live more freely and
fully."
Liberating Aspects
Tuesday's speakers emphasized
the positive, liberating aspects of

homosexuality. Koolish read with
feeling from her recently
published book, Journeys on the
Living, "There is so little love in
this world/ that a merging,
however evanescent,/ of any two
people's lives/ should be a
celebration."
A student in the audience
commented, "I was a good wife
for three years in a gay
relationship which was just as
ridiculous as playing that role in a
straight relationship. A person
should be a person, not a role."
A historical perspective was
provided by Martin and Lyon,
middle-aged women who have
maintained a sexual relationship
for twenty years. They helped
found the Daughters of Bilitis in
1955 as a social club for gay
women, a means of bypassing the
"pick up scene" of the gay bar.
The Daughters of Bilitis has
become the most prominent
national organization of lesbians.
Lesbian Love Poem
The name came from the
supposed authoress of a narrative
lesbian love poem. "We were
looking for a name that would
mean something to gay women
and mean nothing at all to the
public at large," Lyon explained.
Coming out was "a very
frightening thing in the fifties,"
she recalled. "When I was going to
school I'd never heard the word
'lesbian.' " As Martin and Lyon
lecture around the country, they
still receive letters saying, "I
didn't know there was anyone else
like me."
The women went on to discuss
the role of lesbians in the
women's liberation movement.
Martin recently won election to
the board of directors of the
National Organization for Women,

whose president, Betty Friedan,
has been hostile to lesbian
involvement. Martin is pushing for
an end to discrimination on the
basis of sexual orientation as well
as sex itself.
'Give A Damn'
"We need a society
where it's possible for women to
explore their feelings. I don't
want to have to give a damn about
what a person's sexual orientation
is." Koolish added.
Martin and Lyon raised the
problems of adoption, child
raising, joint ownership of
property, and laws regulating
"moral offenses."
The women also mentioned the
gay studies program at
Sacramento State where bisexual
writer Kate Millet is currently a
visiting professor. Koolish wants
to teach at the university level,
but, "It's tough to get a job as a
lesbian feminist."
Gay Studies Program
Roberts hopes to see a gay
studies program here some day."I
wanted this class to give birth to
other courses," he explains. He
will teach next quarter and
sponsor independent study
projects. Psychology Prof. Sandra
Bern urged Roberts to teach the
class. He notes, "At every point T
expected to be stopped. But it
didn't worry me."
Roberts has studied
psychology and anthropology in
New York and California,
organized street queens and
hustlers in San Francisco's
Tenderloin, been a prostitute,
edited a "head" newspaper in
Haight-Ashbury, worked for the
poverty program.
'Gayness Is The Center'
"My gayness is the center from
which everything else grows," he

explains. Since moving to the
Peninsula, he has operated a gay
switchboard, done counseling, and
lectured at churches and high
schools. "I do it because everyone
else has to be safe," he declares.
"I have nothing to lose."
Roberts finds students here
naive, but he is pleased with the
development of his students.
"Most people had no awareness of
gay people." Now, he says, "My
students are writing more, trying
to say more. They have more
awareness of gay issues."
Student Faye Thompson feels
Roberts has slighted the historical
aspect of the course, which was
originally her main interest.

demanded of society is not
tolerance of a perversion,
permissiveness toward behavior
that is seen as bizarre, ludicrous,
unsavory, or immoral; but
approval of liberation,
endorsement of a positive
development in human history."
Thompson disagrees. "I think
the Bible is specific on the sin of
homosexuality. It's really not
natural." She feels that gay people
attending the class reinforce each
other. "It's good that they're

for twenty years. They helped
found the Daughters of Bilitis in
1955 as a social club for gay
women, a means of bypassing the
"pick up scene" of the gay bar.
The Daughters of Bilitis has
become the most prominent
national organization of lesbians.
Lesbian Love Poem
The name came from the
supposed authoress of a narrative
lesbian love poem. "We were
looking for a name that would
mean something to gay women
and mean nothing at all to the
public at large," Lyon explained.
Coming out was "a very
frightening thing in the fifties,"
she recalled. "When I was going to
school I'd never heard the word
'lesbian.' " As Martin and Lyon
lecture around the country, they
still receive letters saying, "I
didn't know there was anyone else
like me."
The women went on to discuss
the role of lesbians in the
women's liberation movement.
Martin recently won election to
the board of directors of the
National Organization for Women,

whose president, Betty Friedan,
has been hostile to lesbian
involvement. Martin is pushing for
an end to discrimination on the
basis of sexual orientation as well
as sex itself.
'Give A Damn'
"We need a society
where it's possible for women to
explore their feelings. I don't
want to have to give a damn about
what a person's sexual orientation
is." Koolish added.
Martin and Lyon raised the
problems of adoption, child
raising, joint ownership of
property, and laws regulating
"moral offenses."
The women also mentioned the
gay studies program at
Sacramento State where bisexual
writer Kate Millet is currently a
visiting professor. Koolish wants
to teach at the university level,
but, "It's tough to get a job as a
lesbian feminist."
Gay Studies Program
Roberts hopes to see a gay
studies program here some day."I
wanted this class to give birth to
other courses," he explains. He
will teach next quarter and
sponsor independent study
projects. Psychology Prof. Sandra
Bern urged Roberts to teach the
class. He notes, "At every point T
expected to be stopped. But it
didn't worry me."
Roberts has studied
psychology and anthropology in
New York and California,
organized street queens and
hustlers in San Francisco's
Tenderloin, been a prostitute,
edited a "head" newspaper in
Haight-Ashbury, worked for the
poverty program.
'Gayness Is The Center'
"My gayness is the center from
which everything else grows," he

explains. Since moving to the
Peninsula, he has operated a gay
switchboard, done counseling, and
lectured at churches and high
schools. "I do it because everyone
else has to be safe," he declares.
"I have nothing to lose."
Roberts finds students here
naive, but he is pleased with the
development of his students.
"Most people had no awareness of
gay people." Now, he says, "My
students are writing more, trying
to say more. They have more
awareness of gay issues."
Student Faye Thompson feels
Roberts has slighted the historical
aspect of the course, which was
originally her main interest.
However she says,"I hope to get a
better understanding of
homosexuality, to get rid of the
stereotype of the lisping pansy. I
think I'm getting that out of it."
Course Theme
Roberts explains that the
theme of the course is expressed
in Eric Bentley's essay, "Men's
Liberation": "What is now
demanded of society is not
tolerance of a perversion,
permissiveness toward behavior
that is seen as bizarre, ludicrous,
unsavory, or immoral; but
approval of liberation,
endorsement of a positive
development in human history."
Thompson disagrees. "I think
the Bible is specific on the sin of
homosexuality. It's really not
natural." She feels that gay people
attending the class reinforce each
other. "It's good that they're
coming out, but I don't think
society should openly accept or
encourage that kind of behavior."
Confident that homosexuality
"is not what God intends," she
says,"I don't feel at all afraid to
speak up. The classes have been

really open despite the fact that
I'm the only person to come out
against homosexuality."
'Yechhh'
She asked her "really close
Christian friends" what they
thought of her taking the course.
"Most said 'yechhh.' " However,
"I found out that a close friend of
mine was homosexual."
Thompson calls the class, "The
most unusual I've taken at
Stanford — and the most
unintellectual." Course work
involves written evaluations of
readings and speakers. A final
project may be required. "It
shouldn't be given for credit and
also not to give a false view of
what the course is going to be and
not draw in politicians and
policemen."
Her feelings are mixed. "I
think almost every time I go there
I get a headache." Yet, "I'm really
glad I'm taking it."
Not Typical
Obviously, Thompson is not
one of Roberts' typical students,
although she believes it is good for
the class to hear a Christian point
of view. Roberts argues that, "The
whole culture has to learn to play
with ideas it doesn't like."

"The Homosexual: Martyr or
Liberator?" will focus on cultural

"Maybe because of the drug

Roberts believes.
Although he says he is not
propagating homosexuality in his
course, Roberts declares, "You
validate an experience when you
teach about it."

GAY STUDIES—Lynda Koolish, poet, photographer and artist, read
some of her poems and discussed her experiences as a Lesbian woman
to an overflew crowd at a recent meeting of "The Myth, History and
Culture of the Homosexual," a SCIRE sponsored course.
Room 200Q is one of those
basement cubicles in the History
Corner, dingy and depressing,
with lines of sagging plastic chairs.
On a recent Tuesday afternoon,
200Q was filled to overflowing.

A predominately female crowd
of sixty showed up to hear poet
Lynda Koolish and Del Martin
and Phyllis Lyon, authors of
Lesbian Women, discuss their
experiences as gay women.
It was the largest crowd that

SCTR 199, "The Myth, Culture
and History of the Homosexual"
has drawn. Most of the weekly
guest speakers have discussed male
homosexuality and have attracted
largely male audiences of 25 or
more.
It is a strange course, unique at
Stanford. "Straight" students feel
nervous about attending; some
"gay" students do not want the
course name to appear on their
study lists or transcripts.
Only seven students are
officially enrolled, as far as
instructor Joel Roberts, a local
gay activist, knows. But Roberts
believes that ten percent of the
Stanford community may be
homosexual.
Phone Calls
"I still get phone calls in the
middle of the night asking, 'where
can I meet gay people?' They're
afraid to come to GPU [Gay
People's Union] meetings, afraid
to write 'homosexual' on a class
card."
"Nobody's fucking come out
here," Koolish, a graduate student
in Modern Thought and
Literature, declared. "This is a
very scary place to come out."
Roberts comments, "Since
SCIRE has given me the
opportunity to teach a gay course,
I have had the wonderful and
disturbing experience of meeting
faculty, staff and students who
are secretly gay. I hope my course
and the gay seminar I'll offer
through SCIRE next quarter will
start to raise the consciousness of
all the Stanford community, so
that my gay sisters and brothers
can soon live more freely and
fully."
Liberating Aspects
Tuesday's speakers emphasized
the positive, liberating aspects of

homosexuality. Koolish read with
feeling from her recently
published book, Journeys on the
Living, "There is so little love in
this world/ that a merging,
however evanescent,/ of any two
people's lives/ should be a
celebration."
A student in the audience
commented, "I was a good wife
for three years in a gay
relationship which was just as
ridiculous as playing that role in a
straight relationship. A person
should be a person, not a role."
A historical perspective was
provided by Martin and Lyon,
middle-aged women who have
maintained a sexual relationship
for twenty years. They helped
found the Daughters of Bilitis in
1955 as a social club for gay
women, a means of bypassing the
"pick up scene" of the gay bar.

GAY STUDIES—Lynda Koolish, poet, photographer and artist, read
some of her poems and discussed her experiences as a Lesbian woman
to an overflew crowd at a recent meeting of "The Myth, History and
Culture of the Homosexual," a SCIRE sponsored course.
Room 200Q is one of those
basement cubicles in the History
Corner, dingy and depressing,
with lines of sagging plastic chairs.
On a recent Tuesday afternoon,
200Q was filled to overflowing.

A predominately female crowd
of sixty showed up to hear poet
Lynda Koolish and Del Martin
and Phyllis Lyon, authors of
Lesbian Women, discuss their
experiences as gay women.
It was the largest crowd that

SCTR 199, "The Myth, Culture
and History of the Homosexual"
has drawn. Most of the weekly
guest speakers have discussed male
homosexuality and have attracted
largely male audiences of 25 or
more.
It is a strange course, unique at
Stanford. "Straight" students feel
nervous about attending; some
"gay" students do not want the
course name to appear on their
study lists or transcripts.
Only seven students are
officially enrolled, as far as
instructor Joel Roberts, a local
gay activist, knows. But Roberts
believes that ten percent of the
Stanford community may be
homosexual.
Phone Calls
"I still get phone calls in the
middle of the night asking, 'where
can I meet gay people?' They're
afraid to come to GPU [Gay
People's Union] meetings, afraid
to write 'homosexual' on a class
card."
"Nobody's fucking come out
here," Koolish, a graduate student
in Modern Thought and
Literature, declared. "This is a
very scary place to come out."
Roberts comments, "Since
SCIRE has given me the
opportunity to teach a gay course,
I have had the wonderful and
disturbing experience of meeting
faculty, staff and students who
are secretly gay. I hope my course
and the gay seminar I'll offer
through SCIRE next quarter will
start to raise the consciousness of
all the Stanford community, so
that my gay sisters and brothers
can soon live more freely and
fully."
Liberating Aspects
Tuesday's speakers emphasized
the positive, liberating aspects of

homosexuality. Koolish read with
feeling from her recently
published book, Journeys on the
Living, "There is so little love in
this world/ that a merging,
however evanescent,/ of any two
people's lives/ should be a
celebration."
A student in the audience
commented, "I was a good wife
for three years in a gay
relationship which was just as
ridiculous as playing that role in a
straight relationship. A person
should be a person, not a role."
A historical perspective was
provided by Martin and Lyon,
middle-aged women who have
maintained a sexual relationship
for twenty years. They helped
found the Daughters of Bilitis in
1955 as a social club for gay
women, a means of bypassing the
"pick up scene" of the gay bar.
The Daughters of Bilitis has
become the most prominent
national organization of lesbians.
Lesbian Love Poem
The name came from the
supposed authoress of a narrative
lesbian love poem. "We were
looking for a name that would
mean something to gay women
and mean nothing at all to the
public at large," Lyon explained.
Coming out was "a very
frightening thing in the fifties,"
she recalled. "When I was going to
school I'd never heard the word
'lesbian.' " As Martin and Lyon
lecture around the country, they
still receive letters saying, "I
didn't know there was anyone else
like me."
The women went on to discuss
the role of lesbians in the
women's liberation movement.
Martin recently won election to
the board of directors of the
National Organization for Women,

whose president, Betty Friedan,
has been hostile to lesbian
involvement. Martin is pushing for
an end to discrimination on the
basis of sexual orientation as well
as sex itself.
'Give A Damn'
"We need a society
where it's possible for women to
explore their feelings. I don't
want to have to give a damn about
what a person's sexual orientation
is." Koolish added.
Martin and Lyon raised the
problems of adoption, child
raising, joint ownership of
property, and laws regulating
"moral offenses."
The women also mentioned the
gay studies program at
Sacramento State where bisexual
writer Kate Millet is currently a
visiting professor. Koolish wants
to teach at the university level,
but, "It's tough to get a job as a
lesbian feminist."
Gay Studies Program
Roberts hopes to see a gay
studies program here some day."I
wanted this class to give birth to
other courses," he explains. He
will teach next quarter and
sponsor independent study
projects. Psychology Prof. Sandra
Bern urged Roberts to teach the
class. He notes, "At every point T
expected to be stopped. But it
didn't worry me."
Roberts has studied
psychology and anthropology in
New York and California,
organized street queens and
hustlers in San Francisco's
Tenderloin, been a prostitute,
edited a "head" newspaper in
Haight-Ashbury, worked for the
poverty program.
'Gayness Is The Center'
"My gayness is the center from
which everything else grows," he

explains. Since moving to the
Peninsula, he has operated a gay
switchboard, done counseling, and
lectured at churches and high
schools. "I do it because everyone
else has to be safe," he declares.
"I have nothing to lose."
Roberts finds students here
naive, but he is pleased with the
development of his students.
"Most people had no awareness of
gay people." Now, he says, "My
students are writing more, trying
to say more. They have more
awareness of gay issues."
Student Faye Thompson feels
Roberts has slighted the historical
aspect of the course, which was
originally her main interest.
However she says,"I hope to get a
better understanding of
homosexuality, to get rid of the
stereotype of the lisping pansy. I
think I'm getting that out of it."
Course Theme
Roberts explains that the
theme of the course is expressed
in Eric Bentley's essay, "Men's
Liberation": "What is now
demanded of society is not
tolerance of a perversion,
permissiveness toward behavior
that is seen as bizarre, ludicrous,
unsavory, or immoral; but
approval of liberation,
endorsement of a positive
development in human history."
Thompson disagrees. "I think
the Bible is specific on the sin of
homosexuality. It's really not
natural." She feels that gay people
attending the class reinforce each
other. "It's good that they're
coming out, but I don't think
society should openly accept or
encourage that kind of behavior."
Confident that homosexuality
"is not what God intends," she
says,"I don't feel at all afraid to
speak up. The classes have been

really open despite the fact that
I'm the only person to come out
against homosexuality."
'Yechhh'
She asked her "really close
Christian friends" what they
thought of her taking the course.
"Most said 'yechhh.' " However,
"I found out that a close friend of
mine was homosexual."
Thompson calls the class, "The
most unusual I've taken at
Stanford — and the most
unintellectual." Course work
involves written evaluations of
readings and speakers. A final
project may be required. "It
shouldn't be given for credit and
also not to give a false view of
what the course is going to be and
not draw in politicians and
policemen."
Her feelings are mixed. "I
think almost every time I go there
I get a headache." Yet, "I'm really
glad I'm taking it."
Not Typical
Obviously, Thompson is not
one of Roberts' typical students,
although she believes it is good for
the class to hear a Christian point
of view. Roberts argues that, "The
whole culture has to learn to play
with ideas it doesn't like."
His course next quarter on
"The Homosexual: Martyr or
Liberator?" will focus on cultural
phenomena such as the "mascara
rock" of David Bowie, Alice
Cooper, and others.
"Maybe because of the drug
experience, electronic media, the
technocratic society, we're going
to have a new awareness,"
Roberts believes.
Although he says he is not
propagating homosexuality in his
course, Roberts declares, "You
validate an experience when you
teach about it."
