# Victory Over Cal Caps 14-11 Basketball Campaign
## Kelley Scores Final 14 Points As Cards Outlast Bears, 70-66 
### STAN WILSON 
Graduating seniors Pat Rusco
and Bob Buell started the
fireworks, but it was dependable
sophomore center Rich Kelley
who finished the job, as Stanford
outlasted Cal 70-66 before 6652
enthusiastic fans at Maples
Pavilion last Friday night.
Buell and Rusco scored 10 of
Stanford's first 14 points before
being replaced by sophomores
Mark Gilberg and Mel Arterberry.
Kelley, determined to repeat the
one-man show he put on against
the Bears a month ago, scored the
Cards' last 14 points in the final
seven minutes of the contest.
Kelley finished the game with
24 points to lead Stanford in that
category, but steady Cal senior
John Coughran, playing as well as
he has all season, took game
honors with 25 points.
Rusco, who was a starter two
years ago as a sophomore, has
seen limited playing time this
season, but responded well to the
challenge when coach Howie
Dallmar named him as a starter
against Cal. With less than a
minute to go in the contest and
the Cards leading 65-64, Rusco
rebounded an errant shot by Cal's
Rickie Hawthorne and tipped the
ball to Gilberg. Moments later
Kelley converted a driving lay-in
into a three-point play to ice the
game for Stanford.
Crucial Steal
"Pat has had problems coming
off the bench," explained
Dallmar. "It's good to see Buell
and Rusco both play so well."

Buell scored 10 points, pulled
down four rebounds, and added
three assists. In addition, the
senior captain recorded a crucial
steal with 1:30 to go in the
contest to help insure the victory.
Both Buell and Rusco reflected
on their final season at Stanford.
"The last game has to carry
special memories," said Rusco.
"It's great to go out a winner —
especially since I got to play. All
season I thought I could do the
job, but I couldn't be upset since
the young guys were playing so
well."
"I've played with pain all these
years," Buell told a group of
teary-eyed sportswriters in the
locker room after the game. Buell
had not played an entire season
since his junior year in high

school, until this year.
Even League Record
The Cards finished with a 7-7
conference record, and were
14-11 for the season. It is
encouraging to note that the
young team won four of its last
five games, including an upset
over USC and a near upset of
number-one ranked UCLA.
"We've been getting better
each game, and this was a nice
way to end the season,"
commented Dallmar. "It would
have been my fault if we had lost
tonight. We tried all week to get
the team up for this game, but in
these traditional games you never
know. Cal really played well
tonight."
One of those who wasn't very
effective for the Bears was
freshman guard Rickie
Hawthorne, who connected on
only five of 15 shots for 10
points. "Arterberry and Rusco did
a good job on Hawthorne,"
Dallmar explained.
One of the bright spots for the
Cards on Friday night was the
performance of unpredictable
Mike Mann, a 6-9 junior forward.
"Mann did a good job on the
offensive boards," Dallmar said.
Mann, who closed out the final
weekends of the season with some
excellent performances, scored
eight of his 12 points in the
second half, including two clutch
tips in a row to put the Cards
ahead 56-54.
Poised Performance
The young team, which will
lose only Buell and Rusco,
committed 14 turnovers in the
first half, a problem which has
plagued Stanford all season. But
in the second half the Cards were
guilty of only four, and the team,
most notably Kelley, turned in a
poised performance in the hectic
final minutes.
Kelley's 10 rebounds in the
game gave him 331 for the season,
a new Stanford record. He scored
433 points for the year a mark
surpassed by only six players in
Stanford cage history.
Dallmar praised the talented
seven-footer. "He has improved so
much. The experience has made
him smarter, and he has become
an outstanding shooter."
Stanford's 7-7 record secured
fourth place in the conference, as
the Cards missed a tie for third
when Oregon downed Oregon
State 88-81 Saturday night in
Eugene. The Ducks showed
remarkable improvement this
season, finishing with an 8-6
record and third place, as
compared to a dismal 0-14 record
and the cellar spot a year ago.

MAPLES SEES A WINNER - A jubilant crowd of 6652 loved the
basketball action last Friday night at Maples Pavilion. The Cards
defeated California 70-66 for their 14th victory of the season against
11 losses, representing the first time in six seasons that Stanford
recorded a winning season. Some of the action Friday included driving
