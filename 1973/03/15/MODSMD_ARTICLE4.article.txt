# Chicano Law Students Demand Authority To Admit 30 Others
## 
### JIM WASCHER 
The 21 members of the Chicano
Law Students' Association (CLSA)
yesterday demanded that they "be
given full power to send out at least 30
faUers of acceptance to Chicano
applicants" for the 150 places
available in the Law School for this
coining autumn.
In an eight-page petition to Law
School Dean Thomas Ehrlich, the

CLSA members also insisted upon the
appointment of a full-time Chicano
dean who would supervise the
admission of Chicano law students and
"develop, coordinate and implement
all aspects of the Chicano program as
outlined" in their proposal.
Additionally, the CLSA members
demanded: the appointment of a
Chicano to the law faculty; the hiring
of "more Chicano employees at all

levels" in the Law School; sufficient
funds for the CLSA to conduct "a
viable recruitment program"; and that
Chicano law students "be guaranteed
sufficient financial assistance
according to need."
Ehrlich and Associate Dean of Law
School Admissions William T. Keogh
both said that they had not studied
the CLSA petition sufficiently to
comment upon it.
Quota Rejected
Last spring, the CLSA and other
minority student organizations
demanded the establishment of a
quota of 20 Chicanos in each entering
Law School class. Ehrlich and the law
faculty rejected this demand soon
after it was made.
In a lengthy statement which
prefaced their demands, the CLSA
members said they were "extremely
concerned with the failure of the
minority admissions and recruitment
program, the manifest disregard for
the goals set by the University in its
Affirmative Action Program adopted
in 1967, and the inadequate financial
assistance given to Chicanos."
According to the statement, there
are only 21 Chicanos in a law student
body of 450, even though "Chicanos
constitute about 18 percent of
California's total population." The
statement alleges that only one of the
Law School's 120 employees is a
Chicano and that "there are no
Chicanos ... on the administrative or
faculty level."
Indifference Charged
Regarding their demand for
increased Chicano staff hiring, the
CLSA members charged that "the Law
School's continuing failure to hire
Chicanos is but one of many
indications of its attitude of utter
indifference, if not actual hostility, to
the needs of its Chicano students as
well as to the Chicano populace at
large."
The CLSA members said only a
Chicano administrator or faculty
member "knows the special needs and
problems" of the Association.
"Despite assertions to the contrary,"
the statement continued, "only a
Chicano can represent Chicanos —
only a Chicano knows the best way to
serve Chicanos — only a Chicano
knows the needs of Chicanos — only a
Chicano knows what it is like to be a
Chicano."
According to the statement, "since
there is no Chicano professor or
administrator this precludes Chicano
student communication with those

levels."
The CLSA also charged that "there
are no 'conscious' programs for
Chicano [student] recruitment. Here,
the failure to employ present Chicano
students as a source of information
and expertise in admissions policy
decisions and coordinated recruitment
efforts demonstrates a poorly planned
program."
Additionally, the statement
complained that some of the Chicano
law students here were admitted "even
though they show no Chicano
identity, no concern for Chicano
problems, no dedication to the
Chicano people, and no intention or
desire to return to the Chicano
community after graduation."
Overall, the CLSA members said
"the Law School has shown itself to
be no different from any other
oppressor of Chicanos."

complained that some of the Chicano
law students here were admitted "even
though they show no Chicano
identity, no concern for Chicano
problems, no dedication to the
Chicano people, and no intention or
desire to return to the Chicano
community after graduation."
Overall, the CLSA members said
"the Law School has shown itself to
be no different from any other
oppressor of Chicanos."
The 21 members of the Chicano
Law Students' Association (CLSA)
yesterday demanded that they "be
given full power to send out at least 30
faUers of acceptance to Chicano
applicants" for the 150 places
available in the Law School for this
coining autumn.
In an eight-page petition to Law
School Dean Thomas Ehrlich, the

CLSA members also insisted upon the
appointment of a full-time Chicano
dean who would supervise the
admission of Chicano law students and
"develop, coordinate and implement
all aspects of the Chicano program as
outlined" in their proposal.
Additionally, the CLSA members
demanded: the appointment of a
Chicano to the law faculty; the hiring
of "more Chicano employees at all

levels" in the Law School; sufficient
funds for the CLSA to conduct "a
viable recruitment program"; and that
Chicano law students "be guaranteed
sufficient financial assistance
according to need."
Ehrlich and Associate Dean of Law
School Admissions William T. Keogh
both said that they had not studied
the CLSA petition sufficiently to
comment upon it.
Quota Rejected
Last spring, the CLSA and other
minority student organizations
demanded the establishment of a
quota of 20 Chicanos in each entering
Law School class. Ehrlich and the law
faculty rejected this demand soon
after it was made.
In a lengthy statement which
prefaced their demands, the CLSA
members said they were "extremely
concerned with the failure of the
minority admissions and recruitment
program, the manifest disregard for
the goals set by the University in its
Affirmative Action Program adopted
in 1967, and the inadequate financial
assistance given to Chicanos."
According to the statement, there
are only 21 Chicanos in a law student
body of 450, even though "Chicanos
constitute about 18 percent of
California's total population." The
statement alleges that only one of the
Law School's 120 employees is a
Chicano and that "there are no
Chicanos ... on the administrative or
faculty level."
Indifference Charged
Regarding their demand for
increased Chicano staff hiring, the
CLSA members charged that "the Law
School's continuing failure to hire
Chicanos is but one of many
indications of its attitude of utter
indifference, if not actual hostility, to
the needs of its Chicano students as
well as to the Chicano populace at
large."
The CLSA members said only a
Chicano administrator or faculty
member "knows the special needs and
problems" of the Association.
"Despite assertions to the contrary,"
the statement continued, "only a
Chicano can represent Chicanos —
only a Chicano knows the best way to
serve Chicanos — only a Chicano
knows the needs of Chicanos — only a
Chicano knows what it is like to be a
Chicano."
According to the statement, "since
there is no Chicano professor or
administrator this precludes Chicano
student communication with those

levels."
The CLSA also charged that "there
are no 'conscious' programs for
Chicano [student] recruitment. Here,
the failure to employ present Chicano
students as a source of information
and expertise in admissions policy
decisions and coordinated recruitment
efforts demonstrates a poorly planned
program."
Additionally, the statement
complained that some of the Chicano
law students here were admitted "even
though they show no Chicano
identity, no concern for Chicano
problems, no dedication to the
Chicano people, and no intention or
desire to return to the Chicano
