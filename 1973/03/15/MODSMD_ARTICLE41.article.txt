# Kelley Wins First Team All-Conference Honors
## 
### 
Stanford sophomore Rich
Kelley was named to the first
string All-Pacific Eight basketball
team announced yesterday.
Kelley, who led the Cards to a
14-11 record, finished second in
the league in rebounding, fifth in
scoring, and third in field goal
percentage.
UCLA center Bill Walton was
the only repeater from the 1972
All-League squad. Walton and
Kelley were joined by UCLA's
Keith Wilkes, Washington's Louis
Nelson, and Oregon freshman Ron
Lee on the first unit.
Cal freshman Rickie
Hawthorne was named to the
second team along with Clint
Chapman and Dan Anderson of
USC, Oregon's Doug Little, and
San Whitehead and Neal
Jurgenson of Oregon State.
Five other players received
honorable mention, including the
three remaining starters on John
Wooden's league champion UCLA
squad. Larry Holly field, Greg Lee,
and Larry Farmer were honored
along with John Coughran of
California and Washington's Ray
Price.
The first team selections
represent some impressive
statistics. Walton led the league in

rebounding with an amazing 16.3
average, Nelson led the conference
in scoring with a 21.9 average, and
Lee was runnerup in the scoring
race with a 20.6 mark. Kelly
ranked in the top 10 in three
statistical categories, averaging
17.1 points, 13.1 rebounds, and
shooting 52.5 percent from the
field.
The team was selected by the
eight conference coaches, a fact
that lends credibility to the squad
since the coaches are normally
more familiar with Pac-8 talent
than sportswriters who only see
games in their own area.
This is the second straight year
that Stanford has landed a player
on the first team. Last year
Claude Terry made the first squad
along with Walton, OSU's Freddie
Boyd. USC's Ron Riley,
Washington's Steve Hawes, and
Cal's Ansley Truitt.
Earlier in the week Kelley was
named to the second squad on the
UPI All-Pacific Coast team. The
versatile seven-footer finished the
season with 433 points and 331
rebounds. The 331 rebounds
represent an all-time Stanford
record while the 433 points place
Kelley seventh on the single
season scoring list.

shooting 52.5 percent from the
field.
The team was selected by the
eight conference coaches, a fact
that lends credibility to the squad
since the coaches are normally
more familiar with Pac-8 talent
than sportswriters who only see
games in their own area.
This is the second straight year
that Stanford has landed a player
on the first team. Last year
Claude Terry made the first squad
along with Walton, OSU's Freddie
Boyd. USC's Ron Riley,
Washington's Steve Hawes, and
Cal's Ansley Truitt.
Earlier in the week Kelley was
named to the second squad on the
UPI All-Pacific Coast team. The
versatile seven-footer finished the
season with 433 points and 331
rebounds. The 331 rebounds
represent an all-time Stanford
record while the 433 points place
Kelley seventh on the single
season scoring list.
