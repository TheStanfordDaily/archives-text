# Shuffling The Cards
## Good Things Ahead For Card Cagers 
### Dave Robinson 
With 2:29 left in last Friday night's game
against California, a crowd of 6652 set the
stage for the next three years of Stanford
basketball, years that should bring packed
houses and countless victories to Maples
Pavilion.
The score at the time was Stanford 62,
California 62, and as the Cards returned to the
floor after a timeout, the crowd erupted into
a tumultous standing ovation. The cheers were
mainly in response to the Red Vest Band's
timeout performance, but the crowd's
uncharacteristic enthusiasm left no doubts as to
the final outcome of the game.
The hopped-up Cards raced to a six point
lead in the next two minutes, and eventually
recorded a 70-66 victory, Stanford's 14th win
of the season and seventh in Pacific Eight
P la Y-
The fans who watched the Cards win nine
of 12 games at Maples en route to a 14-11
season will be back. And it looks like Friday
night's crowd of 6652 will become the rule
rather than the exception.
Young and Exciting
Coach Howie Dallmar agreed that his
cagers won some permanent fans throughout
the season and especially Friday night. "This
was an interesting group to follow," he said.
"We were young and made mistakes, but it
was an exciting group to watch."
The games were particularly exciting
during the last three weeks of the season,
when Stanford defeated four of five Pacific
Eight opponents and came within a few
turnovers of snapping UCLA's winning streak
at 69.
"The high point of the season had to be
those last five games," Dallmar said. "We
gained a lot of confidence and poise that we
lacked early in the year."

Dallmar had mixed feelings about the
Cards' final record. "When you consider that
we played so many first year men, we were
pleased, but we had some disappointing losses.
We missed a lot of free throws and made some
costly turnovers that a good team shouldn't
make."
Frustrating Losses
Missed free throws and turnovers were
especially frustrating in losses to Colorado
State, Denver, Washington State, Oregon
State, and twice against Oregon. But those
harsh defeats were offset by impressive
victories over Arizona, Fordham, Washington
twice, Cal twice, Oregon State, and USC,
victories that considerably brighten Stanford's
outlook for the future.
Everyone from this year's team will return
for the 1973-74 season except Bob Buell and
Pat Rusco. And with redshirt Mike Simons
and 6-9 freshman Ed Schweitzer moving up to
the varsity, Stanford will have exceptional
depth.
"We anticipate being much stronger next
year," Dallmar said.
Can Stanford challenge for the Pac-8 title if
Bill Walton decides to take his amazing talents
to the pros?
"You have to have the feeling that even if
Walton plays we'll be better prepared to play
them (UCLA)."
Of course the Cards will have to overcome
some of the problems that caused their
inconsistency in 1972-73. Stanford's
ridiculous average of over 18 turnovers a game
will have to be trimmed considerably, the
Card offense will have to prove itself capable
of putting the ball toward the hoop more
often (Stanford averaged only 68.7 points a
game this year and attempted 147 less shots
than its opposition), and according to

assistant coach Billy Jones, the Cards must
become "a more physical team."
Kelley Outstanding
Some of these improvements will come
simply through the valuable experience gained
during the past year. Rich Kelley should be a
legitimate candidate for All-American honors
next year after improving with every game
during an outstanding sophomore campaign.
Sophomores Mark Gilberg, Mel Arterberry,
and Scott Trobbe all showed vast potential, as
did 6-11 freshman Tim Patterson, a brilliant
outside shooter who may be destined to
become one of the premier big men in college
basketball.
Mike Mann, whose puzzling performances
over the past two years alternately elicited
disgusted groans and ecstatic cheers, seems to
have successfully harnessed his talents in the
final weeks of the season. "Mike was
outstanding the last month of the season,"
Dallmar said, referring to Mann's timely
rebounding, defense, and scoring in Stanford's
last seven games.
Dave Frost should also contribute
considerably next year if he can avoid the
injuries which have plagued him the past two
seasons. The 6-6 junior forward, who blends
finesse and a fine shooting touch with his
rugged play underneath, came up with some
outstanding efforts before he was sidelined by
back and ankle injuries. "A healthy Frost
would obviously be helpful, especially if he's
ready to play at a lighter weight."
Overall, Stanford's first winning basketball
season since 1967 featured a team that was
tall, talented, exciting, and inconsistent. And
that last adjective has shown signs of fading.
Wait 'till next year.

"You have to have the feeling that even if
Walton plays we'll be better prepared to play
them (UCLA)."
Of course the Cards will have to overcome
some of the problems that caused their
inconsistency in 1972-73. Stanford's
ridiculous average of over 18 turnovers a game
will have to be trimmed considerably, the
Card offense will have to prove itself capable
of putting the ball toward the hoop more
often (Stanford averaged only 68.7 points a
game this year and attempted 147 less shots
than its opposition), and according to

assistant coach Billy Jones, the Cards must
become "a more physical team."
Kelley Outstanding
Some of these improvements will come
simply through the valuable experience gained
during the past year. Rich Kelley should be a
legitimate candidate for All-American honors
next year after improving with every game
during an outstanding sophomore campaign.
Sophomores Mark Gilberg, Mel Arterberry,
and Scott Trobbe all showed vast potential, as
did 6-11 freshman Tim Patterson, a brilliant
outside shooter who may be destined to
become one of the premier big men in college
basketball.
Mike Mann, whose puzzling performances
over the past two years alternately elicited
disgusted groans and ecstatic cheers, seems to
have successfully harnessed his talents in the
final weeks of the season. "Mike was
outstanding the last month of the season,"
Dallmar said, referring to Mann's timely
rebounding, defense, and scoring in Stanford's
last seven games.
Dave Frost should also contribute
considerably next year if he can avoid the
injuries which have plagued him the past two
seasons. The 6-6 junior forward, who blends
finesse and a fine shooting touch with his
rugged play underneath, came up with some
outstanding efforts before he was sidelined by
back and ankle injuries. "A healthy Frost
would obviously be helpful, especially if he's
ready to play at a lighter weight."
Overall, Stanford's first winning basketball
season since 1967 featured a team that was
tall, talented, exciting, and inconsistent. And
that last adjective has shown signs of fading.
Wait 'till next year.
With 2:29 left in last Friday night's game
against California, a crowd of 6652 set the
stage for the next three years of Stanford
basketball, years that should bring packed
houses and countless victories to Maples
Pavilion.
The score at the time was Stanford 62,
California 62, and as the Cards returned to the
floor after a timeout, the crowd erupted into
a tumultous standing ovation. The cheers were
mainly in response to the Red Vest Band's
timeout performance, but the crowd's
uncharacteristic enthusiasm left no doubts as to
the final outcome of the game.
The hopped-up Cards raced to a six point
lead in the next two minutes, and eventually
recorded a 70-66 victory, Stanford's 14th win
of the season and seventh in Pacific Eight
P la Y-
The fans who watched the Cards win nine
of 12 games at Maples en route to a 14-11
season will be back. And it looks like Friday
night's crowd of 6652 will become the rule
rather than the exception.
Young and Exciting
Coach Howie Dallmar agreed that his
cagers won some permanent fans throughout
the season and especially Friday night. "This
was an interesting group to follow," he said.
"We were young and made mistakes, but it
was an exciting group to watch."
The games were particularly exciting
during the last three weeks of the season,
when Stanford defeated four of five Pacific
Eight opponents and came within a few
turnovers of snapping UCLA's winning streak
at 69.
"The high point of the season had to be
those last five games," Dallmar said. "We
gained a lot of confidence and poise that we
lacked early in the year."

Dallmar had mixed feelings about the
Cards' final record. "When you consider that
we played so many first year men, we were
pleased, but we had some disappointing losses.
We missed a lot of free throws and made some
costly turnovers that a good team shouldn't
make."
Frustrating Losses
Missed free throws and turnovers were
especially frustrating in losses to Colorado
State, Denver, Washington State, Oregon
State, and twice against Oregon. But those
harsh defeats were offset by impressive
victories over Arizona, Fordham, Washington
twice, Cal twice, Oregon State, and USC,
victories that considerably brighten Stanford's
outlook for the future.
Everyone from this year's team will return
for the 1973-74 season except Bob Buell and
Pat Rusco. And with redshirt Mike Simons
and 6-9 freshman Ed Schweitzer moving up to
the varsity, Stanford will have exceptional
depth.
"We anticipate being much stronger next
year," Dallmar said.
Can Stanford challenge for the Pac-8 title if
Bill Walton decides to take his amazing talents
to the pros?
"You have to have the feeling that even if
Walton plays we'll be better prepared to play
them (UCLA)."

recorded a 70-66 victory, Stanford's 14th win
of the season and seventh in Pacific Eight
P la Y-
The fans who watched the Cards win nine
of 12 games at Maples en route to a 14-11
season will be back. And it looks like Friday
night's crowd of 6652 will become the rule
rather than the exception.
Young and Exciting
Coach Howie Dallmar agreed that his
cagers won some permanent fans throughout
the season and especially Friday night. "This
was an interesting group to follow," he said.
"We were young and made mistakes, but it
was an exciting group to watch."
The games were particularly exciting
during the last three weeks of the season,
when Stanford defeated four of five Pacific
Eight opponents and came within a few
turnovers of snapping UCLA's winning streak
at 69.
"The high point of the season had to be
those last five games," Dallmar said. "We
gained a lot of confidence and poise that we
lacked early in the year."

Dallmar had mixed feelings about the
Cards' final record. "When you consider that
we played so many first year men, we were
pleased, but we had some disappointing losses.
We missed a lot of free throws and made some
costly turnovers that a good team shouldn't
make."
Frustrating Losses
Missed free throws and turnovers were
especially frustrating in losses to Colorado
State, Denver, Washington State, Oregon
State, and twice against Oregon. But those
harsh defeats were offset by impressive
victories over Arizona, Fordham, Washington
twice, Cal twice, Oregon State, and USC,
victories that considerably brighten Stanford's
outlook for the future.
Everyone from this year's team will return
for the 1973-74 season except Bob Buell and
Pat Rusco. And with redshirt Mike Simons
and 6-9 freshman Ed Schweitzer moving up to
the varsity, Stanford will have exceptional
depth.
"We anticipate being much stronger next
year," Dallmar said.
Can Stanford challenge for the Pac-8 title if
Bill Walton decides to take his amazing talents
to the pros?
"You have to have the feeling that even if
Walton plays we'll be better prepared to play
them (UCLA)."
Of course the Cards will have to overcome
some of the problems that caused their
inconsistency in 1972-73. Stanford's
ridiculous average of over 18 turnovers a game
will have to be trimmed considerably, the
Card offense will have to prove itself capable
of putting the ball toward the hoop more
often (Stanford averaged only 68.7 points a
game this year and attempted 147 less shots
than its opposition), and according to

assistant coach Billy Jones, the Cards must
become "a more physical team."
Kelley Outstanding
Some of these improvements will come
simply through the valuable experience gained
during the past year. Rich Kelley should be a
legitimate candidate for All-American honors
next year after improving with every game
during an outstanding sophomore campaign.
Sophomores Mark Gilberg, Mel Arterberry,
and Scott Trobbe all showed vast potential, as
did 6-11 freshman Tim Patterson, a brilliant
outside shooter who may be destined to
become one of the premier big men in college
basketball.
Mike Mann, whose puzzling performances
over the past two years alternately elicited
disgusted groans and ecstatic cheers, seems to
have successfully harnessed his talents in the
final weeks of the season. "Mike was
outstanding the last month of the season,"
Dallmar said, referring to Mann's timely
rebounding, defense, and scoring in Stanford's
last seven games.
Dave Frost should also contribute
considerably next year if he can avoid the
injuries which have plagued him the past two
seasons. The 6-6 junior forward, who blends
finesse and a fine shooting touch with his
rugged play underneath, came up with some
outstanding efforts before he was sidelined by
back and ankle injuries. "A healthy Frost
would obviously be helpful, especially if he's
ready to play at a lighter weight."
Overall, Stanford's first winning basketball
season since 1967 featured a team that was
tall, talented, exciting, and inconsistent. And
that last adjective has shown signs of fading.
Wait 'till next year.
