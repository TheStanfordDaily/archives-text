# Assistant Coaches Set Fashion Trends
## 
### 
Some extra excitement was
added to the Stanford basketball
program this year by assistant
coach Bub Bowling (left) and
Billy Jones. The youthful
members of the Cardinal coaching
staff set fashion trends for the
entire Pacific Eight conference
during the past season, and the
Daily decided to honor their
achievements.
For each home game, Daily
fashion editor Nancy Ditz rated
Bowling and Jones' outfits. The
final score for the 12 game home
season was Bowling 7—Jones 5,
including one game where
Bowling won on the strength of
his polka-dot underwear.
"I'm thrilled beyond words,"
Bowling said upon hearing of his
victory. "It's one of the greatest
honors ever bestowed upon me."
Jones was less enthusiastic
about the final results. "I've never
seen such biased judging," he said,
warning that "I pledge to be
bigger and better next year."
Head coach Howie Da 11 mar was
rumored to be interested in
entering the competition next
year, but he has flatly denied any
intentions. "There's no way / can
keep up with those guys," he said.
"I just don't throw away old
clothes."
