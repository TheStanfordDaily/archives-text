## McKay Tells Stanford 'It's Just A Game' 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
USC football coach John
McKay, who five months earlier
said he wanted to beat Stanford
"by 2000 points," told a crowd of
400 at the Stanford senior
athletes' dinner Tuesday night
that football "is just a game. I'd
like to go back to the era when
after a game the two teams met
and had dinner."
McKay received a standing
ovation when he was introduced

by athletic director Joe Ruetz,
who said he "had great respect for
what he's [McKay] done."Before
the banquet there had been
rumors that some football players
would boycott the event, but
instead the coach of USC's
undefeated national champion
Trojans was greeted warmly by the
Stanford athletes, coaches, and
alumni.
McKay explained his success at
USC by saying that "players

win—not coaches. I've been
extremely fortunate to have
outstanding football players. I
don't have any trick plays. Our
plays are Davis to the left and
Davis to the right. And if he gets
tired we bring in McNeill."
No strategy was involved in the
Trojans second half rout of Ohio
State after the two teams played
to a 7-7 halftime tie."I just told
'em, 'Gentlemen, please run
faster,' " McKay said.

McKay never directly
addressed himself to the incident
at Stanford Stadium last fall, but
made what could be called an
implied apology. "I have the
utmost respect for Stanford,"
McKay said of the school he
earlier charged "showed no class."
Only A Game
"It's only a game," he said.
"Sometimes you win—sometimes
you lose. One time I forgot that."
Later, however, he said that
"I'm not going to apologize for
what I said before. I think some
of you may realize that some of it
had some merit. But I want you
to know that I'd never hurt any
youngster who plays on any team
in the country.
"Winning is not the only thing.
It's important and we teach
winning at USC, but the number
one thing you get from college
athletics is the ability to accept
criticism. A sense of humor,
confidence, and the ability to
accept criticism are about all you
get out of athletics."
Much of the half hour address
was devoted to a series of
anecdotes about McKay's years as
the Trojan head coach. "Alabama
is a beautiful school," McKay said
of the Tuscaloosa campus he
toured with Paul (Bear) Bryant.

"Then we went to Paul's home—it
was quite a bit larger."
Hayes 'Lovable'
McKay said he has "50 or 60
assistants on my staff. I've got a
guy in charge of Tuesday." He
also spoke with tongue-in-cheek
about Woody Hayes, "one of the
nicest, most lovable guys I've ever
met."
McKay got a big laugh out of
the academically oriented
Stanford crowd when he told a
story about USC's traditional
rivalry against Notre Dame. One
year the Trojans played in South
Bend and the stadium was
decorated by endless signs and
banners. USC lost 24-7 so McKay
decided to inspire his players with
a similar display of pro-USC signs
at the Los Angeles Coliseum the
following year. "We lost 51-0," he
recalls, "and I vowed never to
recruit another player who
couldn't read."
McKay said that "Stanford has
beaten our tail two of the last
three years, which embarrasses
us."
And what about the odds for
the next meeting between the two
teams on Nov. 10? "I wouldn't
give over 1,999 points," McKay
said.

FRIENDS AGAIN?—USC Coach John McKay seemed disturbed
during this game in 1970 (Stanford's 24-14 upset over his Trojans),
and he was even angrier after USC's 30-21 victory over the Cards this
year. McKay was all smiles Tuesday night, however, when he
addressed a crowd of 400 at the senior athletes dinner at Rickey's
Hyatt House.
