# NCAA Swimming Meet Opens
## 
### MIKE CHASSON 
The swimming team will hope to improve on last
year's disappointing eighth place finish when the
NCAA Championships open a three day run a week
from today in Knoxville, Tennessee.
Leading the Cardinals will be defending NCAA
200 breastroke champion Brian Job. Job will be out
to defend his title in the 200 breastroke as well as
regain the 100 breastroke title he lost last year to
UCLA's Tom Bruce.
Job, who will be swimming in his last collegiate
meet, set two American records in last year's
championships at West Point. In winning the 200
breastroke he set the current record of 2.02.59. In
the preliminaries of the 100 breastroke he set a
record of 56.83, but lost to Bruce in the finals in a
slower time.
Pressing Job hard in both breastroke events will
be teammate John Hencken. Hencken defeated Job
in the 100 breastroke at the Pacific Eight
Championships, but lost to him in the 200 yard
event. Hencken also is a good bet to score in the
200 individual medley.
Hard to Predict
"I wouldn't want to pick a winner in the
breastroke event," states coach Jim Gaughran,
"John is always tough at the end of the yar, but if
Brian swims his usual smart race it's impossible to
say who will win."
Both Hencken and Job will swim on the 400
medley relay with Hencken swimming the
breastroke leg while Job will swim the butterfly.
Gaughran is hoping for a top three finish in that
event.
Another point scorer from last year's meet is
sophomore Randy Whitchurch. Whitchurch will lead
off the medley relay, as well as swim the 100 and
200 yard backstrokes. Whitchurch placed 11th in
the 200 backstroke last year and will hopefully score
in both backstroke events this time around.
Dean Anderson, who was a sixth place finisher in

the 50 freestyle last year, will swim the 50 and 100
freestyles as well as anchor the medley relay.
Anderson set the Stanford 50-free record of 21.1 in
last year's final.
Fellow sprinters Martin Pedley and Steve Carey
also scored in last year's 50 yard event with Pedley
10th and Carey 12th. Gaughran hopes both can
score there again, with Pedley and Anderson also
scoring in the 100.
Goodwin Tough
Joining these three in the sprints will be frosh
Bruce Goodwin, who has been a pleasant surprise
for the coaching staff this season. Anderson, Pedley,
and Goodwin will form the nucleus of the 400
freestyle relay. Gaughran hopes these three with the
help of Hencken, Carey or Richard Cook can swim a
3.03 or better which should place them near the top
at Knoxville.
Gaughran also looks to Steve Strong and Terry
Sutton to do well in the distance events. He believes
both have outside chances to score in the 500
freestyle with Sutton possibly going as fast as
4.35.0. In the 1650 he hopes to see Sutton score for
sure by becoming the first Stanford swimmer under
16.00.0.
From a team standpoint Gaughran is hoping for
fifth place behind Indiana, USC, UCLA, and
Tennessee. This means the Cardinals must beat
Washington, who nosed Stanford out for third in
the Pacific Eight meet as well as Southern Methodist
and Florida, who finished ahead of the Cards last
year.
This will be one of the smallest squads Stanford
has had in the last five years as well as one of the
youngest. Six freshmen, two sophomores, two
juniors and two seniors comprise the team.
Stanford was the last team other than Indiana to
win the NCAA title. Since the Cardinals won the
meet in 1967, the Hoosiers have won five straight
titles and are heavy favorites to win an
unprecedented sixth straight.
