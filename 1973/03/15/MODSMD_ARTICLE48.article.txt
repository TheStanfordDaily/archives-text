# BSU Basketball Tourney Opens Today
## 
### 
The varsity, junior varsity, and
intramural seasons are over, but
basketballs will still be bouncing
in Maples Pavilion this weekend in
the BSU basketball tournament.
The eight team tourney begins
tonight with first round games at
6, 7:30, 9 and 10:30 at Maples.
Second round and consolation
games will be played on Friday at
the same times with the
consolation finals scheduled for 6
p.m. Saturday and the
championship game set for 8 p.m.

According to tournament
director Archie Dean, Stanford
will enter at least three teams in
the tourney. The final brackets
weren't completed at press time,
but Skyline College, Cal State
Fullerton, and Nairobi College
will definitely field teams.
"We want to give every team a
chance to play several games,"
Dean said. "All the teams will
play at least two games since
we're going to have a consolation
round for the first round losers."
Admission for all games will be
25 cents. The proceeds will be
used for BSU funds or donated to
a suitable charity.
