# New Football Coach Hired
## 
### 
Head football coach Jack
Christiansen announced last week
that Gunther Cunningham will
join the Cardinal coaching staff
next fall. Cunningham, a 26 year
old Oregon graduate, coached at
Oregon from 1969-71 before
moving to Arkansas for the 1972
season.
"I've always admired Stanford
football and Jack Christiansen,"
Cunningham said. Some of that
admiration for the Stanford
program developed through
competition against the Cards
during Cunningham's playing days
at Oregon. In the 1966 game
between the two teams,
Cunningham missed a field goal in
the final minutes and Stanford
prevailed 17-14.
Christiansen said that
Cunningham will coach the junior
varsity team. Hudson Houck, who
guided the JV's to an undefeated
record last fall, will move up to
the varsity to coach the offensive
line.
