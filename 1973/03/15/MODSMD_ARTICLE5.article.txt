# Motion To Force Start Of Chino Trial Fails
## 
### DON TOLLEFSON TERRY ANZUR 
Plans for an appeal by the San
Bernardino County District Attorney's
office to overturn a pre-trial ruling
have caused the latest delay in the
murder trial of Benton and Andrea
Burt.
Meanwhile, the State Court of
Appeals in San Bernardino has rejected
a motion by defense attorney Charles
Garry to force the start of trial
proceedings in San Bernardino County
Superior Court.
Deputy District Attorney Joseph

Canty says his office is preparing an
appeal to challenge a ruling by
Superior Court Judge Thomas
Haldorsen which prevents some
materials seized under an "overly
broad" search warrant from being
introduced as evidence.
Haldorsen said the prosecution
would have a 30-day period following
the Feb. 22 ruling in which to file
their challenge in appellate court.
Excluded Evidence
The materials suppressed by the
ruling include political documents
taken from the home of Robert

Seabock last December. The search
warrant language authorized the taking
of anything that might bear the
fingerprints of convict Ronald Wayne
Beaty, whose Oct. 6 escape from
Chino prison left one unarmed guard
dead and another wounded.
The Burts face murder charges in
connection with the escape. Seabock,
the accused "trigger-man" in the
incident, and Jean Hobson, who was
arrested with Beaty, are each
scheduled for trial on similar murder
charges on March 28 in San
Bernardino.
Four attempts by the prosecution
to merge the Hobson-Seabock and
Burt trials have failed. The defense
wants the trial to start before further
delay increases chances for a trial
merger.
Evidence Appeal
Garry, representing the Burts,
charged that Canty is appealing
Haldorsen's evidence ruling to stall for
time and attempt to obtain
consolidation "by subterfuge." But
Canty maintains he is filing the appeal
"in good faith" to avoid losing
"significant evidence."
In an effort to avoid continuance,
Garry offered to allow the excluded
evidence to be introduced. Haldorsen
declined that offer, saying it would

deny the Burts their rights to
suppression 6f evidence. Garry then
sought a writ of mandate in appellate
court to force the start of the trial.
The court denied Garry's request.
Jury selection cannot begin until all
pre-trial motions and appeals are
resolved. Haldorsen says he will hold
regular "information sessions" in court
to check on the progress of pending
motions and appeals.
In a recent interview, defense
spokesman Kent Hutchings
characterized the general atmosphere
surrounding the trial as "lousy." He
said that San Bernardino County is
"pretty prejudiced ahead of
time ... Just compared with San
Francisco County or Santa Clara
County, there's a world of
difference .. . Most people either
support or don't question the activities
of the people who run the county."
A defense motion for a change of
venue has been denied by courts up to
and including the State Supreme
Court. Hutchings claimed that the
denial of that motion is one of many
possible grounds for an appeal of the
case. "There are about 30 or 40
different grounds for appeal. There's a
lot of stuff that's been going on that is
kind of shady."
