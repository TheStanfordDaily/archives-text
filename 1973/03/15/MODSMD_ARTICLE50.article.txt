# Gymnasts Crashed In Final Dual Meet
## 
### PHIL HUBBARD 
Stanford's gymnastics team
was soundly defeated by
California last Friday 161.75 to
129.95 in the squad's final dual
meet of the season.
The Cards were competing
without three of their top
all-around performers (Steve Hug,
Bob Anderson, and Ted
Miyamoto). Nevertheless, the
remaining team members did what
they could to keep the score as
close as possible. Going into the
last two events, Stanford was
trailing by less than IV2 points.
In both the parallel bars and
high bar events, the Cards had

only two performers, Leo
Hollberg and Hector Neff. Since
the top three for each team score
in each event, Stanford lost 16 or
more points, simply because the
Cards lacked a third man.
Lack of Depth
Coach Sadao Hamada
explained, "Our greatest problem
right now is a lack of depth. We
need at least four and preferably
five guys to go in each event." In
Friday's meet Hamada used five
men in only two events, the rings
and long horse vault.
Despite the low total, there
were some fine performances by
several of the Stanford gymnasts.
Ted Marcy continued his string of
side horse victories. He was scored
9.7, 9.6, 9.6, and 9.7 by the four
judges for a 9.65 aveage, his high
so far this year.
The rings was Stanford's
strongest event, and the only one
in which the Cards were able to
hold their own against Cal, with
both teams scoring 26.75. Howard
Bessen just missed defeating Cal's
Mark Lundy, who scored 9.2 to
Bessen's 9.15. George Negrate
turned in an excellent 9.0 for the
Cards.
Shawn Skerrett was the bright
spot in the vault for Stanford with
an 8.9, but three of the Berkeley
vaulters scored 9.0 or better, so
the Cards lost ground in this
event, too.
Pac-8 Meet Next
The squad is laying off of
competition for the next two
weeks to prepare for the Pac-8

championships March 29-30 at
UCLA's Pauley Pavilion.
Hopefully, Hug's back will be
better by then. Hector Neff's
hamstring, which was injured
early in the year, is still slowing
him down a little. Miyamoto is
still recovering from surgery on
his bicep and is definitely out for
this year.
Anderson, who announced his
decision to withdraw from the
team a couple of weeks ago,
clarified his position. "I still enjoy

gymnastics," he said, "but the
competitive aspect of it doesn't
turn me on any more." Anderson
is still working out with the team
several days a week, and according
to Hamada is "looking very
good."
Hamada is not holding out any
great hopes for an upset victory at
the conference meet. "I won't say
it's impossible for us to win," he
said, "but with the team in the
shape it is now, I think it will be
very, very difficult."

California last Friday 161.75 to
129.95 in the squad's final dual
meet of the season.
The Cards were competing
without three of their top
all-around performers (Steve Hug,
Bob Anderson, and Ted
Miyamoto). Nevertheless, the
remaining team members did what
they could to keep the score as
close as possible. Going into the
last two events, Stanford was
trailing by less than IV2 points.
In both the parallel bars and
high bar events, the Cards had

only two performers, Leo
Hollberg and Hector Neff. Since
the top three for each team score
in each event, Stanford lost 16 or
more points, simply because the
Cards lacked a third man.
Lack of Depth
Coach Sadao Hamada
explained, "Our greatest problem
right now is a lack of depth. We
need at least four and preferably
five guys to go in each event." In
Friday's meet Hamada used five
men in only two events, the rings
and long horse vault.
Despite the low total, there
were some fine performances by
several of the Stanford gymnasts.
Ted Marcy continued his string of
side horse victories. He was scored
9.7, 9.6, 9.6, and 9.7 by the four
judges for a 9.65 aveage, his high
so far this year.
The rings was Stanford's
strongest event, and the only one
in which the Cards were able to
hold their own against Cal, with
both teams scoring 26.75. Howard
Bessen just missed defeating Cal's
Mark Lundy, who scored 9.2 to
Bessen's 9.15. George Negrate
turned in an excellent 9.0 for the
Cards.
Shawn Skerrett was the bright
spot in the vault for Stanford with
an 8.9, but three of the Berkeley
vaulters scored 9.0 or better, so
the Cards lost ground in this
event, too.
Pac-8 Meet Next
The squad is laying off of
competition for the next two
weeks to prepare for the Pac-8

championships March 29-30 at
UCLA's Pauley Pavilion.
Hopefully, Hug's back will be
better by then. Hector Neff's
hamstring, which was injured
early in the year, is still slowing
him down a little. Miyamoto is
still recovering from surgery on
his bicep and is definitely out for
this year.
Anderson, who announced his
decision to withdraw from the
team a couple of weeks ago,
clarified his position. "I still enjoy

gymnastics," he said, "but the
competitive aspect of it doesn't
turn me on any more." Anderson
is still working out with the team
several days a week, and according
to Hamada is "looking very
good."
Hamada is not holding out any
great hopes for an upset victory at
the conference meet. "I won't say
it's impossible for us to win," he
said, "but with the team in the
shape it is now, I think it will be
very, very difficult."
