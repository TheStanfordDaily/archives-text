# Albritton Sets Shot Put Mark
## Spikers Defeated By San Jose State 
### PHIL HUBBARD 
The Stanford track team was
surprised by a fired-up San Jose
State squad last Saturday in its
second meet of the season.
Despite fine performances by
several of the Card spikers, the
Spartans ran away with an 87-58
victory.
The high point of the meet
came early. Frosh sensation Terry
Albritton became the first man in
Stanford history to throw the
shot beyond 60 feet, as he tossed
the iron ball 61'5W' to set a new
Stanford and meet record.
Decathlete Kenny Kring put on
a fine show, placing in all three of
the events he ran. He led off with
a lifetime best of 23'4%" to take
second in the long jump, and
followed with a second in the pole
vault at 14'6" and a third in the
intermediate hurdles at 54.2.
In the 100 and 220 Ken Curl
was nosed out of first place by

Spartan speedster Vince Breddell.
Breddell also held off John
Anderson on the anchor leg of the
440 relay, which San Jose won in
40.9.
The Cards took several other
firsts, though. Tony Sandoval and
Brian Mittelstaedt were 1-2 in the
two mile in 9:02.2 and 9:02.6
respectively. Mittelstaedt was also
second in the mile at 4:06.9.
Matt Hogsett had his second
victory in a row in the
intermediate hurdles, winning this
week in 54.1. Jim Howard led
teammates Pete Dreissigacker and
Jim Royer in the Cards' only
sweep of the meet in the discus.
Howard's winning toss of 174'2"
was a lifetime best.
Non-Scoring Victories
Two of the events Stanford
won were non-scoring in this
competition, although both were
scored in the victory over Fresno
State the week before. Wes

Reynolds won the hammer for the
second week in a row, and Kurt
Schoenrock had a lifetime best of
9:21.2 as he won the steeplechase,
also for the second week in a row.
Other highlights for Stanford
included a second place 14.4 in
the high hurdles for Dave
Bagshaw, a 221'2" javelin toss by
Steve Hopkins, also good for a
second, and a 1:55.8 lifetime best
880 for Bruce Wolfe, who also
finished second.
Coach Jordan was surprised by
the outcome of some of the
events. "They (San Jose) came
here ready to win. They ran more
inspired races than we did. We had
some fine performances but
lacked the depth we had last
week."
It should be noted that a world
record was broken in Saturday's
meet. Prof. Alphonse Juilland of
the French department won the
senior's 100 in 10.9, eclipsing the
old mark of 11.0 for the over-50
crowd.
Easter Relays Next
The team is off this weekend
to prepare for finals, but travel
down to Santa Barbara for the
Easter Relays on March 24.
Jordan will be taking individuals

who met qualifying standards in
the Fresno or San Jose meets as
well as five relay teams.
Curl will represent the Cards in
the 100. Bagshaw will be trying to
crack the 14 second barrier in the
high hurdles. Schoenrock will run
the mile, since there is no
steeplechase in this meet.
Sandoval, who has had
outstanding two mile times the
past two weeks, will be running
the three mile at Santa Barbara.
He will be joined by Mark
McConnell and Jack Bellah.
Although failing to place in last
week's meet, Bellah nevertheless
ran a lifetime best 9:11.8 two
mile.
Much of the team's strength
will be in the field events. Kring
will go in the long jump, and may
also double in the pole vault. Tom
Anderson is also a possibility in
the long jump. He has leaped over
25' and his 22'11" jump last week
is just one inch short of the
official qualifying mark.
Albritton Goes For 62
Stanford's new record holder
in the shot, Albritton, will be
aiming for 62'. Howard will be
competing in the discus, and
Hopkins will go in the javelin.

The 880 relay team of Curl,
Kessel, Hogsett, and Anderson
which set an indoor world record
in the event last month will be
going after the Stanford outdoor
record. The same personnel will
also run the 440 relay. Hogsett,
Kessel, and Anderson will team up
again for the mile relay, along
with Bagshaw.
The two mile relay will consist
of McFadden, Wolfe, Mittelstaedt,
and either Vernell Jackson or Jim
Bordoni. In the distance medley
relay, Kring will lead off with a
440, followed by Wolfe running
an 880, Mittelstaedt a 1320, and
McFadden anchoring with a mile.
The week after Santa Barbara,
the Cards will host Occidental in
their third dual of the season on
March 31. Stanford destroyed
Occidental, where Payton Jordan
coached from 1946-1956, 101-44
last year. Oxy leads the series,
however, 10-7.
Jordan said that the Stanford
team that faces Occidental will
probably be basically the same as
the lineup that went against San
Jose. "Oxy's got a lot stronger
team this season," he said. "This
year's meet should be a lot closer
than the last one."

to the Spartans, 87-58.
The Stanford track team was
surprised by a fired-up San Jose
State squad last Saturday in its
second meet of the season.
Despite fine performances by
several of the Card spikers, the
Spartans ran away with an 87-58
victory.
The high point of the meet
came early. Frosh sensation Terry
Albritton became the first man in
Stanford history to throw the
shot beyond 60 feet, as he tossed
the iron ball 61'5W' to set a new
Stanford and meet record.
Decathlete Kenny Kring put on
a fine show, placing in all three of
the events he ran. He led off with
a lifetime best of 23'4%" to take
second in the long jump, and
followed with a second in the pole
vault at 14'6" and a third in the
intermediate hurdles at 54.2.
In the 100 and 220 Ken Curl
was nosed out of first place by

Spartan speedster Vince Breddell.
Breddell also held off John
Anderson on the anchor leg of the
440 relay, which San Jose won in
40.9.
The Cards took several other
firsts, though. Tony Sandoval and
Brian Mittelstaedt were 1-2 in the
two mile in 9:02.2 and 9:02.6
respectively. Mittelstaedt was also
second in the mile at 4:06.9.
Matt Hogsett had his second
victory in a row in the
intermediate hurdles, winning this
week in 54.1. Jim Howard led
teammates Pete Dreissigacker and
Jim Royer in the Cards' only
sweep of the meet in the discus.
Howard's winning toss of 174'2"
was a lifetime best.
Non-Scoring Victories
Two of the events Stanford
won were non-scoring in this
competition, although both were
scored in the victory over Fresno
State the week before. Wes

Reynolds won the hammer for the
second week in a row, and Kurt
Schoenrock had a lifetime best of
9:21.2 as he won the steeplechase,
also for the second week in a row.
Other highlights for Stanford
included a second place 14.4 in
the high hurdles for Dave
Bagshaw, a 221'2" javelin toss by
Steve Hopkins, also good for a
second, and a 1:55.8 lifetime best
880 for Bruce Wolfe, who also
finished second.
Coach Jordan was surprised by
the outcome of some of the
events. "They (San Jose) came
here ready to win. They ran more
inspired races than we did. We had
some fine performances but
lacked the depth we had last
week."
It should be noted that a world
record was broken in Saturday's
meet. Prof. Alphonse Juilland of
the French department won the
senior's 100 in 10.9, eclipsing the
old mark of 11.0 for the over-50
crowd.
Easter Relays Next
The team is off this weekend
to prepare for finals, but travel
down to Santa Barbara for the
Easter Relays on March 24.
Jordan will be taking individuals

who met qualifying standards in
the Fresno or San Jose meets as
well as five relay teams.
Curl will represent the Cards in
the 100. Bagshaw will be trying to
crack the 14 second barrier in the
high hurdles. Schoenrock will run
the mile, since there is no
steeplechase in this meet.
Sandoval, who has had
outstanding two mile times the
past two weeks, will be running
the three mile at Santa Barbara.
He will be joined by Mark
McConnell and Jack Bellah.
Although failing to place in last
week's meet, Bellah nevertheless
ran a lifetime best 9:11.8 two
mile.
Much of the team's strength
will be in the field events. Kring
will go in the long jump, and may
also double in the pole vault. Tom
Anderson is also a possibility in
the long jump. He has leaped over
25' and his 22'11" jump last week
is just one inch short of the
official qualifying mark.
Albritton Goes For 62
Stanford's new record holder
in the shot, Albritton, will be
aiming for 62'. Howard will be
competing in the discus, and
Hopkins will go in the javelin.

The 880 relay team of Curl,
Kessel, Hogsett, and Anderson
which set an indoor world record
in the event last month will be
going after the Stanford outdoor
record. The same personnel will
also run the 440 relay. Hogsett,
Kessel, and Anderson will team up
again for the mile relay, along
with Bagshaw.
The two mile relay will consist
of McFadden, Wolfe, Mittelstaedt,
and either Vernell Jackson or Jim
Bordoni. In the distance medley
relay, Kring will lead off with a
440, followed by Wolfe running
an 880, Mittelstaedt a 1320, and
McFadden anchoring with a mile.
The week after Santa Barbara,
the Cards will host Occidental in
their third dual of the season on
March 31. Stanford destroyed
Occidental, where Payton Jordan
coached from 1946-1956, 101-44
last year. Oxy leads the series,
however, 10-7.
Jordan said that the Stanford
team that faces Occidental will
probably be basically the same as
the lineup that went against San
Jose. "Oxy's got a lot stronger
team this season," he said. "This
year's meet should be a lot closer
than the last one."

edged by San Jose State's Vince Breddell in both events. Stanford lost
to the Spartans, 87-58.
The Stanford track team was
surprised by a fired-up San Jose
State squad last Saturday in its
second meet of the season.
Despite fine performances by
several of the Card spikers, the
Spartans ran away with an 87-58
victory.
The high point of the meet
came early. Frosh sensation Terry
Albritton became the first man in
Stanford history to throw the
shot beyond 60 feet, as he tossed
the iron ball 61'5W' to set a new
Stanford and meet record.
Decathlete Kenny Kring put on
a fine show, placing in all three of
the events he ran. He led off with
a lifetime best of 23'4%" to take
second in the long jump, and
followed with a second in the pole
vault at 14'6" and a third in the
intermediate hurdles at 54.2.
In the 100 and 220 Ken Curl
was nosed out of first place by

Spartan speedster Vince Breddell.
Breddell also held off John
Anderson on the anchor leg of the
440 relay, which San Jose won in
40.9.
The Cards took several other
firsts, though. Tony Sandoval and
Brian Mittelstaedt were 1-2 in the
two mile in 9:02.2 and 9:02.6
respectively. Mittelstaedt was also
second in the mile at 4:06.9.
Matt Hogsett had his second
victory in a row in the
intermediate hurdles, winning this
week in 54.1. Jim Howard led
teammates Pete Dreissigacker and
Jim Royer in the Cards' only
sweep of the meet in the discus.
Howard's winning toss of 174'2"
was a lifetime best.
Non-Scoring Victories
Two of the events Stanford
won were non-scoring in this
competition, although both were
scored in the victory over Fresno
State the week before. Wes

Reynolds won the hammer for the
second week in a row, and Kurt
Schoenrock had a lifetime best of
9:21.2 as he won the steeplechase,
also for the second week in a row.
Other highlights for Stanford
included a second place 14.4 in
the high hurdles for Dave
Bagshaw, a 221'2" javelin toss by
Steve Hopkins, also good for a
second, and a 1:55.8 lifetime best
880 for Bruce Wolfe, who also
finished second.
Coach Jordan was surprised by
the outcome of some of the
events. "They (San Jose) came
here ready to win. They ran more
inspired races than we did. We had
some fine performances but
lacked the depth we had last
week."
It should be noted that a world
record was broken in Saturday's
meet. Prof. Alphonse Juilland of
the French department won the
senior's 100 in 10.9, eclipsing the
old mark of 11.0 for the over-50
crowd.
Easter Relays Next
The team is off this weekend
to prepare for finals, but travel
down to Santa Barbara for the
Easter Relays on March 24.
Jordan will be taking individuals

who met qualifying standards in
the Fresno or San Jose meets as
well as five relay teams.
Curl will represent the Cards in
the 100. Bagshaw will be trying to
crack the 14 second barrier in the
high hurdles. Schoenrock will run
the mile, since there is no
steeplechase in this meet.
Sandoval, who has had
outstanding two mile times the
past two weeks, will be running
the three mile at Santa Barbara.
He will be joined by Mark
McConnell and Jack Bellah.
Although failing to place in last
week's meet, Bellah nevertheless
ran a lifetime best 9:11.8 two
mile.
Much of the team's strength
will be in the field events. Kring
will go in the long jump, and may
also double in the pole vault. Tom
Anderson is also a possibility in
the long jump. He has leaped over
25' and his 22'11" jump last week
is just one inch short of the
official qualifying mark.
Albritton Goes For 62
Stanford's new record holder
in the shot, Albritton, will be
aiming for 62'. Howard will be
competing in the discus, and
Hopkins will go in the javelin.

The 880 relay team of Curl,
Kessel, Hogsett, and Anderson
which set an indoor world record
in the event last month will be
going after the Stanford outdoor
record. The same personnel will
also run the 440 relay. Hogsett,
Kessel, and Anderson will team up
again for the mile relay, along
with Bagshaw.
The two mile relay will consist
of McFadden, Wolfe, Mittelstaedt,
and either Vernell Jackson or Jim
Bordoni. In the distance medley
relay, Kring will lead off with a
440, followed by Wolfe running
an 880, Mittelstaedt a 1320, and
McFadden anchoring with a mile.
The week after Santa Barbara,
the Cards will host Occidental in
their third dual of the season on
March 31. Stanford destroyed
Occidental, where Payton Jordan
coached from 1946-1956, 101-44
last year. Oxy leads the series,
however, 10-7.
Jordan said that the Stanford
team that faces Occidental will
probably be basically the same as
the lineup that went against San
Jose. "Oxy's got a lot stronger
team this season," he said. "This
year's meet should be a lot closer
than the last one."
