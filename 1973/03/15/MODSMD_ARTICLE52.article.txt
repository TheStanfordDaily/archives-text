# Bears Top Cards In JV Cage Finale
## 
### MARK WHITE 
Cal's second half dominance of
game tempo and the poorest
officiating of the year were costly
for the Cardinal -JV's last Friday
as Stanford closed out its 1973
season by succumbing to the
Bears 89-74 at Maples Pavilion.
As had been true for most of
the year, Cardinal control of game
tempo or lack of it determined
the extent of their success. "Cal
played with intensity all through
the game, while we played most
intensely only during the first
half," said Coach Bill Jones. "We

started hurrying our shots, they
screened out Eddie (Schweitzer)
on the boards and before long we
were off balance and they were
controlling the tempo of the
game."
Stanford opened the game
plagued with ball handling
problems and fell behind 18-6 in
the first six minutes of play. Cal's
full court press caused most of the
turnovers during the Bear
offensive.
13 Point Spurt
Then at the 11:14 mark, guard
Steve Kristovitch scored on a
difficult driving play through
three Bear defenders. This single
act seemed to lift the entire team
and during the next four minutes
the Card forwards and Schweitzer
went to work. Kevin Enright,
Mike Kehrli and Schweitzer took
command of the offensive boards
and poured in 13 straight points
to pull the Cards ahead 28-24.
The two teams fought the rest
of the half evenly and Stanford
took a 38-37 lead at halftime.
Although the Cal defense forced
the Cards to take outside shots,
Stanford was connecting from
medium range and shot over 50
percent for the half.
Schweitzer, Enright and Kehrli
accounted for Stanford's 32-23
halftime rebounding edge, and
Moroski's 10 points led the well
balanced scoring. Yet for all their
statistical advantages, one had the
gnawing feeling the Cards should
have led by more than one point.
Stanford's excellent first half
play flew out the window when
Bear rebounding toughness and a
brutal full-court press combined
with poor officiating to bludgeon
the Cards in the second half.
Schweitzer Held Down
Eric Vaaler and Pat Motola of
the Bears worked in tandem to
box-up and sometimes hold
Schweitzer from getting to
rebounds or passes. Cal's front
line took control of the boards
and within five minutes of the
second period Cal outscored the
Cards 18-8.
Enright led an attempted
Cardinal comeback, but Cal's

rebounding, guard play, and the
officiating stymied the Cards'
efforts to come from behind. By
the seven minute mark, so many
fouls, illegal screens, and three
second lane violations had not
been called that the Cards were
rushing their shots, failing to set
up defensively, and simply losing
control of the game.
Jones called it"the worst
officiating performance I have
seen in a long, long time," and it
was easily the worst Maples has
witnessed all season. "Once they
started getting physical and we
couldn't counter, we lost our
tempo and things started to
snowball," said the Card coach.
Trailing by 23, it was obvious
when Jones pulled his regulars
with four minutes to go in the
game that Cal had overpowered
the Cards. While Schweitzer,
Enright, Moroski and Kehrli
scored between 12 to 16 points
each, the 36 percent shooting
average for the game spelled doom
for the Cards against Cal's tough
defense.
Successful Season
Despite the disappointing
finale, 1973 should be termed a
good year as the Cards 13-7
record would attest. A team that
started slowly, the Cards
improved in nearly every phase of
the game to become a fairly close
competitor with Cal, the best
team in the Bay Area.
"The feature of the team I was
especially pleased with was the
overall spirit," Jones said. "At
first we were not a together team,
but by the end of the year the
entire team displayed maximum
effort. I was especially pleased
with the bench, which was one of
our biggest assets.
"Kehrli, Enright and
Wohlstadter were particularly
responsible for our success in the
last part of the season. If Dave
Rompel, Seb Ficcadenti and Brad
Power had not been injured part
of the season, I think we would
have been even stronger.
"As far as players moving up to
the varsity next year, Schweitzer

is the obvious guy. He will make
an excellent rebounder and if he
can improve on his general
movement with the ball, that will
be an added plus we hadn't
counted on."
"It's doubtful too many other
players will go up to varsity since
we have so many of this year's
regulars returning. I do think that
after next year many of this year's
JV's will be useful to the varsity
squad, so I hope to have many of
this year's players return on the
JV team next year."

took a 38-37 lead at halftime.
Although the Cal defense forced
the Cards to take outside shots,
Stanford was connecting from
medium range and shot over 50
percent for the half.
Schweitzer, Enright and Kehrli
accounted for Stanford's 32-23
halftime rebounding edge, and
Moroski's 10 points led the well
balanced scoring. Yet for all their
statistical advantages, one had the
gnawing feeling the Cards should
have led by more than one point.
Stanford's excellent first half
play flew out the window when
Bear rebounding toughness and a
brutal full-court press combined
with poor officiating to bludgeon
the Cards in the second half.
Schweitzer Held Down
Eric Vaaler and Pat Motola of
the Bears worked in tandem to
box-up and sometimes hold
Schweitzer from getting to
rebounds or passes. Cal's front
line took control of the boards
and within five minutes of the
second period Cal outscored the
Cards 18-8.
Enright led an attempted
Cardinal comeback, but Cal's

rebounding, guard play, and the
officiating stymied the Cards'
efforts to come from behind. By
the seven minute mark, so many
fouls, illegal screens, and three
second lane violations had not
been called that the Cards were
rushing their shots, failing to set
up defensively, and simply losing
control of the game.
Jones called it"the worst
officiating performance I have
seen in a long, long time," and it
was easily the worst Maples has
witnessed all season. "Once they
started getting physical and we
couldn't counter, we lost our
tempo and things started to
snowball," said the Card coach.
Trailing by 23, it was obvious
when Jones pulled his regulars
with four minutes to go in the
game that Cal had overpowered
the Cards. While Schweitzer,
Enright, Moroski and Kehrli
scored between 12 to 16 points
each, the 36 percent shooting
average for the game spelled doom
for the Cards against Cal's tough
defense.
Successful Season
Despite the disappointing
finale, 1973 should be termed a
good year as the Cards 13-7
record would attest. A team that
started slowly, the Cards
improved in nearly every phase of
the game to become a fairly close
competitor with Cal, the best
team in the Bay Area.
"The feature of the team I was
especially pleased with was the
overall spirit," Jones said. "At
first we were not a together team,
but by the end of the year the
entire team displayed maximum
effort. I was especially pleased
with the bench, which was one of
our biggest assets.
"Kehrli, Enright and
Wohlstadter were particularly
responsible for our success in the
last part of the season. If Dave
Rompel, Seb Ficcadenti and Brad
Power had not been injured part
of the season, I think we would
have been even stronger.
"As far as players moving up to
the varsity next year, Schweitzer

is the obvious guy. He will make
an excellent rebounder and if he
can improve on his general
movement with the ball, that will
be an added plus we hadn't
counted on."
"It's doubtful too many other
players will go up to varsity since
we have so many of this year's
regulars returning. I do think that
after next year many of this year's
JV's will be useful to the varsity
squad, so I hope to have many of
this year's players return on the
JV team next year."
Cal's second half dominance of
game tempo and the poorest
officiating of the year were costly
for the Cardinal -JV's last Friday
as Stanford closed out its 1973
season by succumbing to the
Bears 89-74 at Maples Pavilion.
As had been true for most of
the year, Cardinal control of game
tempo or lack of it determined
the extent of their success. "Cal
played with intensity all through
the game, while we played most
intensely only during the first
half," said Coach Bill Jones. "We

started hurrying our shots, they
screened out Eddie (Schweitzer)
on the boards and before long we
were off balance and they were
controlling the tempo of the
game."
Stanford opened the game
plagued with ball handling
problems and fell behind 18-6 in
the first six minutes of play. Cal's
full court press caused most of the
turnovers during the Bear
offensive.
13 Point Spurt
Then at the 11:14 mark, guard
Steve Kristovitch scored on a
difficult driving play through
three Bear defenders. This single
act seemed to lift the entire team
and during the next four minutes
the Card forwards and Schweitzer
went to work. Kevin Enright,
Mike Kehrli and Schweitzer took
command of the offensive boards
and poured in 13 straight points
to pull the Cards ahead 28-24.

seen in a long, long time," and it
was easily the worst Maples has
witnessed all season. "Once they
started getting physical and we
couldn't counter, we lost our
tempo and things started to
snowball," said the Card coach.
Trailing by 23, it was obvious
when Jones pulled his regulars
with four minutes to go in the
game that Cal had overpowered
the Cards. While Schweitzer,
Enright, Moroski and Kehrli
scored between 12 to 16 points
each, the 36 percent shooting
average for the game spelled doom
for the Cards against Cal's tough
defense.
Successful Season
Despite the disappointing
finale, 1973 should be termed a
good year as the Cards 13-7
record would attest. A team that
started slowly, the Cards
improved in nearly every phase of
the game to become a fairly close
competitor with Cal, the best
team in the Bay Area.
"The feature of the team I was
especially pleased with was the
overall spirit," Jones said. "At
first we were not a together team,
but by the end of the year the
entire team displayed maximum
effort. I was especially pleased
with the bench, which was one of
our biggest assets.
"Kehrli, Enright and
Wohlstadter were particularly
responsible for our success in the
last part of the season. If Dave
Rompel, Seb Ficcadenti and Brad
Power had not been injured part
of the season, I think we would
have been even stronger.
"As far as players moving up to
the varsity next year, Schweitzer

is the obvious guy. He will make
an excellent rebounder and if he
can improve on his general
movement with the ball, that will
be an added plus we hadn't
counted on."
"It's doubtful too many other
players will go up to varsity since
we have so many of this year's
regulars returning. I do think that
after next year many of this year's
JV's will be useful to the varsity
squad, so I hope to have many of
this year's players return on the
JV team next year."
Cal's second half dominance of
game tempo and the poorest
officiating of the year were costly
for the Cardinal -JV's last Friday
as Stanford closed out its 1973
season by succumbing to the
Bears 89-74 at Maples Pavilion.
As had been true for most of
the year, Cardinal control of game
tempo or lack of it determined
the extent of their success. "Cal
played with intensity all through
the game, while we played most
intensely only during the first
half," said Coach Bill Jones. "We

started hurrying our shots, they
screened out Eddie (Schweitzer)
on the boards and before long we
were off balance and they were
controlling the tempo of the
game."
Stanford opened the game
plagued with ball handling
problems and fell behind 18-6 in
the first six minutes of play. Cal's
full court press caused most of the
turnovers during the Bear
offensive.
13 Point Spurt
Then at the 11:14 mark, guard
Steve Kristovitch scored on a
difficult driving play through
three Bear defenders. This single
act seemed to lift the entire team
and during the next four minutes
the Card forwards and Schweitzer
went to work. Kevin Enright,
Mike Kehrli and Schweitzer took
command of the offensive boards
and poured in 13 straight points
to pull the Cards ahead 28-24.
The two teams fought the rest
of the half evenly and Stanford
took a 38-37 lead at halftime.
Although the Cal defense forced
the Cards to take outside shots,
Stanford was connecting from
medium range and shot over 50
percent for the half.
Schweitzer, Enright and Kehrli
accounted for Stanford's 32-23
halftime rebounding edge, and
Moroski's 10 points led the well
balanced scoring. Yet for all their
statistical advantages, one had the
gnawing feeling the Cards should
have led by more than one point.
Stanford's excellent first half
play flew out the window when
Bear rebounding toughness and a
brutal full-court press combined
with poor officiating to bludgeon
the Cards in the second half.
Schweitzer Held Down
Eric Vaaler and Pat Motola of
the Bears worked in tandem to
box-up and sometimes hold
Schweitzer from getting to
rebounds or passes. Cal's front
line took control of the boards
and within five minutes of the
second period Cal outscored the
Cards 18-8.
Enright led an attempted
Cardinal comeback, but Cal's

rebounding, guard play, and the
officiating stymied the Cards'
efforts to come from behind. By
the seven minute mark, so many
fouls, illegal screens, and three
second lane violations had not
been called that the Cards were
rushing their shots, failing to set
up defensively, and simply losing
control of the game.
Jones called it"the worst
officiating performance I have
seen in a long, long time," and it
was easily the worst Maples has
witnessed all season. "Once they
started getting physical and we
couldn't counter, we lost our
tempo and things started to
