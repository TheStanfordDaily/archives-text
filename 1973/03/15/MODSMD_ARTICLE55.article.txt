# Ruggers Set For Monterey
## 
### PETE BHATIA 
The Stanford Rugby team,
like everyone else, has finals
coming up next week, and doesn't
go back into action until the
annual Monterey National Rugby
Tournament beginning March 24.
Stanford traditionally dominated
the tourney until last season,
winning the previous five
championships in a row.
The 32 team tournament
annually includes the top rugby
teams in California.
Santa Monica, a club made up
mainly of UCLA alumni is the top
seed with the Bay Area Touring

Side (BATS) ranked second and
California, the state's only
undefeated, untied side ranked
third, much to the chagrin of the
Cal coach Doc Hudson. The
Peninsula Ramblers are the fourth
seed.
Stanford is not seeded in this
year's tournament but Card coach
Pete Knetovic commented that
"we got a very good draw."
Last week the Cards lost in the
battle for the Scrum Axe as they
fell in Berkeley 15-9. Actually,
the Bears had more-or-less
clinched the axe a week earlier
when they trounced the Cards
18-3 at Stanford in the first
match of the series where the
winner is determined on total
points.
The deciding try at Berkeley
Saturday was set up on a 60 yard
run by back row man Pete
Richter. His run resulted in a
fumble which Cals' Loren Toews
scooped up inside the Stanford
five, and walked in for the try.
The try combined with Terry
Buchanan's try gave the Bears a
12-3 margin at the time. Stanfqrd
had a chance to tie the game in
the closing moment when Tom

Klein was racing in for an
apparent score only to lose
control of the ball. Kmetovic
commented, that the Cards
"played much better" the second
time around against the tough
Berkeley side.
Stanford's second team closed
out an undefeated season with a
15-0 victory over the Bears
Saturday. The Cards' third unit
was also victorious, winning 12-0
over the Bears' third team.

Stanford is not seeded in this
year's tournament but Card coach
Pete Knetovic commented that
"we got a very good draw."
Last week the Cards lost in the
battle for the Scrum Axe as they
fell in Berkeley 15-9. Actually,
the Bears had more-or-less
clinched the axe a week earlier
when they trounced the Cards
18-3 at Stanford in the first
match of the series where the
winner is determined on total
points.
The deciding try at Berkeley
Saturday was set up on a 60 yard
run by back row man Pete
Richter. His run resulted in a
fumble which Cals' Loren Toews
scooped up inside the Stanford
five, and walked in for the try.
The try combined with Terry
Buchanan's try gave the Bears a
12-3 margin at the time. Stanfqrd
had a chance to tie the game in
the closing moment when Tom

Klein was racing in for an
apparent score only to lose
control of the ball. Kmetovic
commented, that the Cards
"played much better" the second
time around against the tough
Berkeley side.
Stanford's second team closed
out an undefeated season with a
15-0 victory over the Bears
Saturday. The Cards' third unit
was also victorious, winning 12-0
over the Bears' third team.
