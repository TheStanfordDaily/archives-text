# Horpel Places Fifth In NCAA Wrestling
## 
### 
Chris Horpel finished fifth in
the NCAA wrestling tournament
at Seattle, Washington, last
weekend, to lead Stanford to a
23rd place finish among all the
collegiate teams in the U.S.
Horpel's showing came after a
back injury nearly forced Coach
Joe DeMeo to scratch him from
the meet. He lost his first round
match, which was stopped by
DeMeo so that Horpel wouldn't
be further injured, and then won
four straight matches for the fifth
place finish.
Horpel first pinned the
Southern regional champion, Tom
Marriot of East Carolina, then
topped Rich Randall of Oklahoma
State, the Big 8 champion at the
150 pound weight level.
The next day, he first beat
Eastern Intercollegiate champion

Tom More 4-0, and finally ripped
into Mike Fitzpatrick of
Washington, who earlier beat
Horpel for the Pac-8 title, and
pinned him in a quick 1:11.
"I honestly believe that if Chris
was healthy, he would have won it
all," DeMeo said. The Stanford
coach attributed Horpel's
remarkable turnabout to
injections of muscle relaxers given
him by the trianer at Washington
after the first round.
Stanford's other entry,
Emmett Stanton (158) also
wrestled well, but lost to lowa
State's John Showater 4-1. lowa
State, as usual, won the national
championship, with Oregon State
second. Stanford finished third
among Pac-8 teams behind only
Oregon State and Washington.
