# Cards Defend Tourney Title
## Riverside Next For Baseball Team 
### SCOTT DAILEY 
With sunny skies heating up
cold, soggy bats, Stanford's
baseball team is preparing to
defend its title in the Riverside
National tournament the last two
years and will be trying to make it
three in a row when they open
against Washington State March
26 at UC Riverside Field.
After playing WSU, the
Cardinals are scheduled to meet
Arizona State, Massachusetts, UC
Riverside, Hawaii, Vanderbilt, and
National Champion Southern
California.
On the way to Riverside,
Stanford will stop off at San
Fernando State to play a
doubleheader on Saturday, March
24.
Stanford's most challenging
assignment at Riverside will
probably come on Wednesday, the
28th, when the Cards face a good
UCR team and Arizona State in a
doubleheader.
Toughest Schedule
When asked about the team's
chances against USC and Arizona
State at the tourney, Coach Ray
Young commented, "There's no
question that we have the
toughest schedule of the three
teams, and I don't mean that from
an alibi point of view." Young
pointed out that Southern Cal
plays ASU in its first game, and
can use its top pitching against
the Sun Devils, who lost to the
Trojans in the College Baseball
World Series last year.
"We play our doubleheader in
the middle of the week, and we'll
have to use our regular rotation,
which means our number one
pitchers can't go against Arizona
State, and our pitchers who pitch

Wednesday won't be able to come
back on Saturday against SC. It'll
be tough to have our best people
ready.
"If the pitching stays good,
though, and we sta h lg the
ball, then wr 1

Young has brought up three
freshmen to increase the varsity
roster to 23 players. Catcher Dave
Baker and outfielders Ray
Anderson and Bruce Robinson are
expected to give some needed
depth to the ballclub.
In addition, pitchers Dave
Frost and Pat Rusco have
returned to the squad from the
basketball team. Rusco will also
see utility action.
"They'll increase our bench
strength and give us something to
work, with if we need a
pinch-hitter or a strong arm in the
outfield," said Young of the
freshmen.
23 To Travel
Young added that all 23
players would travel to Riverside.
"My philosophy right now is that
if they (Baker, Anderson, and
Robinson) help us in just one
game then that's good for the
ballclub. They've got to be happy
with that.
"They'll probably be sitting on
the bench a lot, but there's an
awful lot they can learn, and they
make us a stronger ballclub."
No games are scheduled for
this week or next week, and
Young is happy about that. For
virtually the first time in two
weeks, his team can get in some
hard workouts.
Good Practices
"These practices are a blessing.
We're getting some good hitting

and some game hitting, and
there's been tremendous
improvement. Each player has
been swinging the bat at least a
hundred times a day, and we're
hitting like we should and like we
know we can.
"I can see a tremendous
difference already with what some
of the guys are doing. We're
starting to bang the ball around a
little bit and Mike Nelson's hitting
a lot better and Glen Johnson

seems to be coming along like he
should.
"I believe in this ballclub,"
Young asserted. "They're starting
to get a purpose in mind, and
there are enough seniors who have
been on this ballclub for three
years (Johnson, Nelson, Bob
Reece, and Dan Shaw) when
we've been a good ballclub but
not a great ballclub who have a
desire to win. When we get out of
Riverside, we'll be very healthy."

No games are scheduled for

Young is happy about that. For
virtually the first time in two

hard workouts.
Good Practices
"These practices are a blessing.
We're getting some good hitting

and some game hitting, and
there's been tremendous
improvement. Each player has
been swinging the bat at least a
hundred times a day, and we're
hitting like we should and like we
know we can.

difference already with what some

starting to bang the ball around a
little bit and Mike Nelson's hitting
a lot better and Glen Johnson

Young asserted. "They're starting

The Cards, who currently sport a 13-5 record, will defend their
Riverside Tournament title during spring break.
With sunny skies heating up
cold, soggy bats, Stanford's
baseball team is preparing to
defend its title in the Riverside
National tournament the last two
years and will be trying to make it
three in a row when they open
against Washington State March
26 at UC Riverside Field.
After playing WSU, the
Cardinals are scheduled to meet
Arizona State, Massachusetts, UC
Riverside, Hawaii, Vanderbilt, and
National Champion Southern
California.
On the way to Riverside,
Stanford will stop off at San
Fernando State to play a
doubleheader on Saturday, March
24.
Stanford's most challenging
assignment at Riverside will
probably come on Wednesday, the
28th, when the Cards face a good
UCR team and Arizona State in a
doubleheader.
Toughest Schedule
When asked about the team's
chances against USC and Arizona
State at the tourney, Coach Ray
Young commented, "There's no
question that we have the
toughest schedule of the three
teams, and I don't mean that from
an alibi point of view." Young
pointed out that Southern Cal
plays ASU in its first game, and
can use its top pitching against
the Sun Devils, who lost to the
Trojans in the College Baseball
World Series last year.
"We play our doubleheader in
the middle of the week, and we'll
have to use our regular rotation,
which means our number one
pitchers can't go against Arizona
State, and our pitchers who pitch

Wednesday won't be able to come
back on Saturday against SC. It'll
be tough to have our best people
ready.
