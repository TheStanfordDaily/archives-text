# Forgotten Rick Fisher Lifts Tennis Hopes
## 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
For the past four seasons, Rick Fisher has been one
of the main reasons for the development of the Stanford
tennis team into a national power.
Week in, week out, he has won while playing high
singles positions, and also won his doubles matches. Yet,
because he's not an especially flashy player, Rick has
never gotten the attention he deserves.
"Rick makes more out of his ability than any player
I've ever seen," says Coach Dick Gould. "He has a
winning attitude that turned our whole program around
when he was a freshman. He, Roscoe (Tanner) and Gery
(Groslimond) thought they could win and they did."
Through the years, Rick's serve, which is hit with
deceptive power after a smooth, full windup, has been
his best stroke. "It definitely helps, being lefthanded.
The serve comes from a different place and spins the
opposite way."
Southpaw Advantage
Fisher's doubles partner, Groslimond, with whom he
has played in three of his four seasons here, is also
lefthanded. "Two left-handers give the other team
problems. There are very few teams like that. Doubles is
a game of reactions — you don't have time to think —
and so a lot of shots just naturally go to our high
forehands, where they shouldn't."
Thus, Fisher and Groslimond are able to hit a higher
percentage of forehand overheads, devestating shots
which win points.
The pair of senior southpaws must definitely be
ranked among the favorites for the NCAA doubles
championship this year, as they defeated Mike Machette
and Paul Ramirez of USC, generally considered the
nation's best collegiate team, at the National Indoor
Championships in Madison, Wisconsin last month.
Goals For Season
However, winning the national doubles title is only
Fisher's third main goal this year. The first goal for all
Stanford players is to win the NCAA team
championship. Rich's second goal is to win the NCAA's
individual title. "Singles always comes first," he says.
The most important singles matches Rick will play
this year will probably be those against players from
USC and UCLA, the only teams with any real chance of
stopping Stanford's national championship bid. Also, the
one opponent Rick likes to beat most is Machette, with

whom he has been competing since they were both 12
years old.
Thus, it's no wonder that one of the biggest thrills of
Fisher's career took place last season when Stanford beat
USC 9-0 and UCLA 8-1 in the first double win over the
two schools Stanford has had in 30 years. "Rick played
his best in those matches," Gould says."He plays best
when the pressure is on."

However, the event Fisher dreads most this season is
not against another school at all, rather it is the series of
challenge matches which take place over spring break.
"It's really tough, playing your best friends. We're a
really close team, and it's hard to play a blood-and-guts
match when the guy you beat may be off the team,"
Rick says.
However, the increased competition that tomes about
because Stanford has so many players vying for starting
jobs is a big help to Rick, the 47th ranked men's player
in the U.S. last season.
"The better your competition, the better you are,"
Rick says. "It's getting hard for us to keep up with
Roscoe and Sandy (Mayer) because they're playing such
good competition away from here."
Tanner, the Cards' individual star the past three years,
turned professional this season and is making loads of
money on the World Championship Tennis circuit.
"I didn't turn pro because I'm not as good as
Roscoe," Rick frankly admits. "I didn't think it was
worth not finishing my education, since I'm getting
enough (financial aid) to stay here." He is a political
science major who hopes to eventually go into business.
However, Rick definitely intends to turn professional
after this season. Thus, he is working especially hard this
spring so he will be able to compete successfully on the
pro tour.
Working On Volley
"Dick (Gould) structures practice so we can work on
singles by playing sets and also so we do drills to help
certain shots. This year I've been concentrating on my
forehand volley and also trying to raise the overall level
of my game," Fisher says.
Both Rick and his brother Chip, a sophomore who
will be vying for a starting singles position, were taught
how to play by their father. Rick went to Cubberley
High School in Palo Alto, but as Cubberley is fairly weak
in tennis, practiced a lot with the Stanford team.
Because of his hard serve, Rick plays well on the
hard-court surfaces in California, but has become
increasingly good on clay, a slower surface which
requires more than just a "serve and volley" game.
Since Fisher now hits virtually every stroke on every
surface consistently well, it looks like he has a great
future as a consistent winner in the pro tournaments
ahead of him.

lefthanded. "Two left-handers give the other team
problems. There are very few teams like that. Doubles is
a game of reactions — you don't have time to think —
and so a lot of shots just naturally go to our high
forehands, where they shouldn't."
Thus, Fisher and Groslimond are able to hit a higher
percentage of forehand overheads, devestating shots
which win points.
The pair of senior southpaws must definitely be
ranked among the favorites for the NCAA doubles
championship this year, as they defeated Mike Machette
and Paul Ramirez of USC, generally considered the
nation's best collegiate team, at the National Indoor
Championships in Madison, Wisconsin last month.
Goals For Season
However, winning the national doubles title is only
Fisher's third main goal this year. The first goal for all
Stanford players is to win the NCAA team
championship. Rich's second goal is to win the NCAA's
individual title. "Singles always comes first," he says.
The most important singles matches Rick will play
this year will probably be those against players from
USC and UCLA, the only teams with any real chance of
stopping Stanford's national championship bid. Also, the
one opponent Rick likes to beat most is Machette, with

whom he has been competing since they were both 12
years old.
Thus, it's no wonder that one of the biggest thrills of
Fisher's career took place last season when Stanford beat
USC 9-0 and UCLA 8-1 in the first double win over the
two schools Stanford has had in 30 years. "Rick played
his best in those matches," Gould says."He plays best
when the pressure is on."

However, the event Fisher dreads most this season is
not against another school at all, rather it is the series of
challenge matches which take place over spring break.
"It's really tough, playing your best friends. We're a
really close team, and it's hard to play a blood-and-guts
match when the guy you beat may be off the team,"
Rick says.
However, the increased competition that tomes about
because Stanford has so many players vying for starting
jobs is a big help to Rick, the 47th ranked men's player
in the U.S. last season.
"The better your competition, the better you are,"
Rick says. "It's getting hard for us to keep up with
Roscoe and Sandy (Mayer) because they're playing such
good competition away from here."
Tanner, the Cards' individual star the past three years,
turned professional this season and is making loads of
money on the World Championship Tennis circuit.
"I didn't turn pro because I'm not as good as
Roscoe," Rick frankly admits. "I didn't think it was
worth not finishing my education, since I'm getting
enough (financial aid) to stay here." He is a political
science major who hopes to eventually go into business.
However, Rick definitely intends to turn professional
after this season. Thus, he is working especially hard this
spring so he will be able to compete successfully on the
pro tour.
Working On Volley
"Dick (Gould) structures practice so we can work on
singles by playing sets and also so we do drills to help
certain shots. This year I've been concentrating on my
forehand volley and also trying to raise the overall level
of my game," Fisher says.
Both Rick and his brother Chip, a sophomore who
will be vying for a starting singles position, were taught
how to play by their father. Rick went to Cubberley
High School in Palo Alto, but as Cubberley is fairly weak
in tennis, practiced a lot with the Stanford team.
Because of his hard serve, Rick plays well on the
hard-court surfaces in California, but has become
increasingly good on clay, a slower surface which
requires more than just a "serve and volley" game.
Since Fisher now hits virtually every stroke on every
surface consistently well, it looks like he has a great
future as a consistent winner in the pro tournaments
ahead of him.

FlSH—Senior Rick Fisher has played outstanding tennis
at Stanford for four years, but his talents have often
gone unrecognized. In fact Fisher is so obscure that two
inept members of the Daily sports staff mistook Fisher
for freshman Pat Dupre in an earlier issue of the Daily.
For the past four seasons, Rick Fisher has been one
of the main reasons for the development of the Stanford
tennis team into a national power.
Week in, week out, he has won while playing high
singles positions, and also won his doubles matches. Yet,
because he's not an especially flashy player, Rick has
never gotten the attention he deserves.
"Rick makes more out of his ability than any player
I've ever seen," says Coach Dick Gould. "He has a
winning attitude that turned our whole program around
when he was a freshman. He, Roscoe (Tanner) and Gery
(Groslimond) thought they could win and they did."
Through the years, Rick's serve, which is hit with
deceptive power after a smooth, full windup, has been
his best stroke. "It definitely helps, being lefthanded.
The serve comes from a different place and spins the
opposite way."
Southpaw Advantage
Fisher's doubles partner, Groslimond, with whom he

this year will probably be those against players from
USC and UCLA, the only teams with any real chance of
stopping Stanford's national championship bid. Also, the
one opponent Rick likes to beat most is Machette, with

whom he has been competing since they were both 12
years old.
Thus, it's no wonder that one of the biggest thrills of
Fisher's career took place last season when Stanford beat
USC 9-0 and UCLA 8-1 in the first double win over the
two schools Stanford has had in 30 years. "Rick played
his best in those matches," Gould says."He plays best
when the pressure is on."

However, the event Fisher dreads most this season is
not against another school at all, rather it is the series of
challenge matches which take place over spring break.
"It's really tough, playing your best friends. We're a
really close team, and it's hard to play a blood-and-guts
match when the guy you beat may be off the team,"
Rick says.
However, the increased competition that tomes about
because Stanford has so many players vying for starting
jobs is a big help to Rick, the 47th ranked men's player
in the U.S. last season.
"The better your competition, the better you are,"
Rick says. "It's getting hard for us to keep up with
Roscoe and Sandy (Mayer) because they're playing such
good competition away from here."
Tanner, the Cards' individual star the past three years,
turned professional this season and is making loads of
money on the World Championship Tennis circuit.
"I didn't turn pro because I'm not as good as
Roscoe," Rick frankly admits. "I didn't think it was
worth not finishing my education, since I'm getting
enough (financial aid) to stay here." He is a political
science major who hopes to eventually go into business.
However, Rick definitely intends to turn professional
after this season. Thus, he is working especially hard this
spring so he will be able to compete successfully on the
pro tour.
Working On Volley
"Dick (Gould) structures practice so we can work on
singles by playing sets and also so we do drills to help
certain shots. This year I've been concentrating on my
forehand volley and also trying to raise the overall level
of my game," Fisher says.
Both Rick and his brother Chip, a sophomore who
will be vying for a starting singles position, were taught
how to play by their father. Rick went to Cubberley
High School in Palo Alto, but as Cubberley is fairly weak
in tennis, practiced a lot with the Stanford team.
Because of his hard serve, Rick plays well on the
hard-court surfaces in California, but has become
increasingly good on clay, a slower surface which
requires more than just a "serve and volley" game.
Since Fisher now hits virtually every stroke on every
surface consistently well, it looks like he has a great
future as a consistent winner in the pro tournaments
ahead of him.

FlSH—Senior Rick Fisher has played outstanding tennis
at Stanford for four years, but his talents have often
gone unrecognized. In fact Fisher is so obscure that two
inept members of the Daily sports staff mistook Fisher
for freshman Pat Dupre in an earlier issue of the Daily.
For the past four seasons, Rick Fisher has been one
of the main reasons for the development of the Stanford
tennis team into a national power.
Week in, week out, he has won while playing high
singles positions, and also won his doubles matches. Yet,
because he's not an especially flashy player, Rick has
never gotten the attention he deserves.
"Rick makes more out of his ability than any player
I've ever seen," says Coach Dick Gould. "He has a
winning attitude that turned our whole program around
when he was a freshman. He, Roscoe (Tanner) and Gery
(Groslimond) thought they could win and they did."
Through the years, Rick's serve, which is hit with
deceptive power after a smooth, full windup, has been
his best stroke. "It definitely helps, being lefthanded.
The serve comes from a different place and spins the
opposite way."
Southpaw Advantage
Fisher's doubles partner, Groslimond, with whom he
has played in three of his four seasons here, is also
lefthanded. "Two left-handers give the other team
problems. There are very few teams like that. Doubles is
a game of reactions — you don't have time to think —
and so a lot of shots just naturally go to our high
forehands, where they shouldn't."
Thus, Fisher and Groslimond are able to hit a higher
percentage of forehand overheads, devestating shots
which win points.
The pair of senior southpaws must definitely be
ranked among the favorites for the NCAA doubles
championship this year, as they defeated Mike Machette
and Paul Ramirez of USC, generally considered the
nation's best collegiate team, at the National Indoor
Championships in Madison, Wisconsin last month.
Goals For Season
However, winning the national doubles title is only
Fisher's third main goal this year. The first goal for all
Stanford players is to win the NCAA team
championship. Rich's second goal is to win the NCAA's
individual title. "Singles always comes first," he says.
