# A 						Community Statement
## Honeywell And Concern 
### 
St. Ann Catholic Council

The following statement made
on behalf of the St. Ann Catholic
Council has been endorsed by
several members of the Catholic
Community at Stanford. But it
would be dishonest to say that
response to this statement or to
the current Honeywell Campaign
with which it is concerned, has
been overwhelming.
Our own community, for
example, did not join in the stock
purchase plan, and this was
interpreted as a sign of weakness
by some. Nevertheless, the
Council agreed to endorse the
proposal to send representatives
to the shareholders' meeting if
only to maintain a level of
awareness and concern which is
demanded of us as a people of
God in the world.
We did decide to take positive
steps to assess how our
community can appropriately
respond to the question of
corporate responsibility, as the
statement below indicates.
Less Politics
It is becoming increasingly
apparent that manifestations of
human concern will be less
obviously political in the future,
at least by the majority. For
example, while some are actively
involved in the Honeywell
Campaign and similar joint
efforts, others are privately
tutoring the imprisoned or
ministering to the poor and
oppressed in Oakland and San
Mateo. Still others are working
with youth groups and on aid to
the old and infirm.
Often these things are done in
hiddenness and with little
apparent effect on society at

large. This is well and good so
long as human concern is indeed
manifested in a direct, concrete,
and loving manner which can
match or surpass the political in
its impact on the person.
We speak here of a level of
commitment which very probably
demands more of us than any of
the conveniences of mass political
action and political machinery. It
is much more challenging to act
alone and without the fanfare,
remembering that we contribute
to the well-being of our
communities in so doing. We
speak here of a level of activity
which will readily reveal
cowardices, evasions, and
mock-concern.
Statement
It is in this spirit of facing the
reality and tone of the current
day that we have made the
following statement:
1. We of the Stanford Catholic
Community reaffirm our
reverence for life and seek to
show consistency in this
affirmation.
2. We hold that the cease fire
in no way relieves us of our
responsibility to take every
reasonable step to insure the
reverence for life so blatantly
disregarded by our society.
3. We support the efforts of
Clergy and Laity Concerned, of
the San Francisco Archdiocesan
Commission on Social Justice, and
of the various communities at
Stanford in protesting the current
corporate policies of Honeywell,
the largest manufacturer of
anti-personnel weapons for the
United States Government.

4. We hold that as long as
corporations continue to produce
weapons designed solely to maim
or induce undue suffering, often
against the provisions of
international war accords, it is our
moral responsibility to make our
voices heard in protest, if we are
to remain consistent in our
reverence for life.
5. We look beyond the
Honeywell campaign to even more
effective uses of our human
energies, not only in the area of
corporate and moral
responsibility, but in other
spheres best suited to the
capabilities of our community.
6. We intend to cooperate with
others when appropriate in
demanding that Stanford exercise
consistent moral responsibility
with respect to its investment and
placement center policies. And we
intend to investigate as possible
the corporate investment policies
of our own Archdiocese. We will
continue to be ever more active in
seeking effective measures of
concrete action in defense of life
appropriate to our community, its
tradition, and our common moral
responsibility.
7. While these efforts against
Honeywell and in the corporate
sphere are important in meeting
the desire for consistency in
reverence for life, they must
proceed from the profound spirit
of peace found only in the
warmth of human compassion and
solid religio-ethical values.
8. We remind ourselves of the
words of Isaiah and resolve to
take them to heart: Remove the
evil of your doings from before
my eyes. (1:16) Seek justice,
correct oppression. (1:17) Beat
their swords into plowshares and
their spears into pruning
hooks. (2:4)
The St. Ann Council urges
student participation in this and
other programs sponsored by the
United Campus Ministry, and
encourages Catholic students in
particular to seek active personal
participation in the pursuit of
peace and justice in our
communities. This involves the
willingness to act in the political
realm; it involves the courage to
act unseen.

8. We remind ourselves of the
words of Isaiah and resolve to
take them to heart: Remove the
evil of your doings from before
my eyes. (1:16) Seek justice,
correct oppression. (1:17) Beat
their swords into plowshares and
their spears into pruning
hooks. (2:4)
The St. Ann Council urges
student participation in this and
other programs sponsored by the
United Campus Ministry, and
encourages Catholic students in
particular to seek active personal
participation in the pursuit of
peace and justice in our
communities. This involves the
willingness to act in the political
realm; it involves the courage to
act unseen.
(Statement of the St. Ann
Catholic Council.)
St. Ann Catholic Council

The following statement made
on behalf of the St. Ann Catholic
Council has been endorsed by
several members of the Catholic
Community at Stanford. But it
would be dishonest to say that
response to this statement or to
the current Honeywell Campaign
with which it is concerned, has
been overwhelming.
Our own community, for
example, did not join in the stock
purchase plan, and this was
interpreted as a sign of weakness
by some. Nevertheless, the
Council agreed to endorse the
proposal to send representatives
to the shareholders' meeting if
only to maintain a level of
awareness and concern which is
demanded of us as a people of
God in the world.
We did decide to take positive
steps to assess how our
community can appropriately
respond to the question of
corporate responsibility, as the
statement below indicates.
Less Politics
It is becoming increasingly
apparent that manifestations of
human concern will be less
obviously political in the future,
at least by the majority. For
example, while some are actively
involved in the Honeywell
Campaign and similar joint
efforts, others are privately
tutoring the imprisoned or
ministering to the poor and
oppressed in Oakland and San
Mateo. Still others are working
with youth groups and on aid to
the old and infirm.
Often these things are done in
hiddenness and with little
apparent effect on society at

large. This is well and good so
long as human concern is indeed
manifested in a direct, concrete,
and loving manner which can
match or surpass the political in
its impact on the person.
We speak here of a level of
commitment which very probably
demands more of us than any of
the conveniences of mass political
action and political machinery. It
is much more challenging to act
alone and without the fanfare,
remembering that we contribute
to the well-being of our
communities in so doing. We
speak here of a level of activity
which will readily reveal
cowardices, evasions, and
mock-concern.
Statement
It is in this spirit of facing the
reality and tone of the current
day that we have made the
following statement:
1. We of the Stanford Catholic
Community reaffirm our
reverence for life and seek to
show consistency in this
affirmation.
2. We hold that the cease fire
in no way relieves us of our
responsibility to take every
reasonable step to insure the
reverence for life so blatantly
disregarded by our society.
3. We support the efforts of
Clergy and Laity Concerned, of
the San Francisco Archdiocesan
Commission on Social Justice, and
of the various communities at
Stanford in protesting the current
corporate policies of Honeywell,
the largest manufacturer of
anti-personnel weapons for the
United States Government.

4. We hold that as long as
corporations continue to produce
weapons designed solely to maim
or induce undue suffering, often
against the provisions of
international war accords, it is our
moral responsibility to make our
voices heard in protest, if we are
to remain consistent in our
reverence for life.
5. We look beyond the
Honeywell campaign to even more
effective uses of our human
energies, not only in the area of
corporate and moral
responsibility, but in other
spheres best suited to the
capabilities of our community.
6. We intend to cooperate with
others when appropriate in
demanding that Stanford exercise
consistent moral responsibility
with respect to its investment and
placement center policies. And we
intend to investigate as possible
the corporate investment policies
of our own Archdiocese. We will
continue to be ever more active in
seeking effective measures of
concrete action in defense of life
appropriate to our community, its
tradition, and our common moral
responsibility.
7. While these efforts against
Honeywell and in the corporate
sphere are important in meeting
the desire for consistency in
reverence for life, they must
proceed from the profound spirit
of peace found only in the
warmth of human compassion and
solid religio-ethical values.

energies, not only in the area of
corporate and moral
responsibility, but in other
spheres best suited to the
capabilities of our community.
6. We intend to cooperate with
others when appropriate in
demanding that Stanford exercise
consistent moral responsibility
with respect to its investment and
placement center policies. And we
intend to investigate as possible
the corporate investment policies
of our own Archdiocese. We will
continue to be ever more active in
seeking effective measures of
concrete action in defense of life
appropriate to our community, its
tradition, and our common moral
responsibility.
7. While these efforts against
Honeywell and in the corporate
sphere are important in meeting
the desire for consistency in
reverence for life, they must
proceed from the profound spirit
of peace found only in the
warmth of human compassion and
solid religio-ethical values.
8. We remind ourselves of the
words of Isaiah and resolve to
take them to heart: Remove the
evil of your doings from before
my eyes. (1:16) Seek justice,
correct oppression. (1:17) Beat
their swords into plowshares and
their spears into pruning
hooks. (2:4)
The St. Ann Council urges
student participation in this and
other programs sponsored by the
United Campus Ministry, and
encourages Catholic students in
particular to seek active personal
participation in the pursuit of
peace and justice in our
communities. This involves the
willingness to act in the political
realm; it involves the courage to
act unseen.
(Statement of the St. Ann
Catholic Council.)
