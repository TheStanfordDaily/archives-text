# Impoverished, Unbureaucratic Program Places Students
## Asia Volunteers Teach English, Learn About Life 
### JOANNE JACOBS 
Shelley Metzenbaum taught English
at the Taipei YMCA to factory
workers, college students, doctors and
engineers. "The first day in Taiwan
they told me the next day I was going
to be teaching. It was a terrifying
feeling. Everything was so
ambiguous. . . . But I was surprised
how completely I got into it."
Bob Schoultz taught English to
Indonesian government employees in
health and agriculture and to English
teachers in a little town in the
mountains of West Java. "I was the
only white person in my whole town.
All of my close friends were
Indonesian."
Dale Canade taught English,
changed diapers and wrote letters to
American donors in an orphanage at a
small fishing village on a Korean
island. "A lot of the learning I did over
there was about America as well as
myself."
Earl Ruley, a pre-med, worked in a
Japanese hospital teaching
conversational English and "translating
the translations" of Japanese medical
articles into English. He also taught at
a junior high school and a cement
factory. "I enjoyed all of it."
All four students were placed by
Volunteers in Asia, a Stanford-based
group which sends thirty
undergraduates to Asia each year for
six or nine month stints, and twenty
graduates for two year periods.
Teaching English
Most undergraduates teach English;
about half work with doctors and
midwives at regional family planning
centers in Indonesia. Some graduates
teach English; others maintain a fleet
of CARE emergency relief trucks in
Bangladesh, work on regional planning
in the Philippines, or plan small
industry development with the
International Labor Organization. The
program is moving toward greater
involvement with United Nations
agencies.
The program began ten years ago
when 23 volunteers, most of them
Wilbur freshmen, spent a summer in
Hong Kong building a road to a
tuberculosis sanitorium and teaching
English. Now institutions in Indonesia,
the Philippines, Japan, Taiwan, Hong
Kong, Bangladesh and Korea have
requested volunteers. Three fourths

come from Stanford, while Pomona
and UC-Santa Cruz supply the rest.
VIA prides itself on being small,
individual and informal. Metzenbaum
argues that the organization's
insecurity is one of its strengths. "VIA
is so sensitive to its drawbacks. The
structure isn't structured."
'Little Bureaucracy'
"We try for as little bureaucracy as
possible," explains Dwight Clark, the
organization's director. A 1963
volunteer, Clark returned in December
from six months work in Indonesia.
"We get a lot of feedback. Returning
volunteers do most of the recruitment
and selection of new people." Four of
the seven board members are former
volunteers.
VIA is basically a shoestring
operation. Contributions from past
volunteers, some family foundations,
and corporations, and income from a
press and a travel service supplied
$25,000 last year. Expenses were
$31,000, but the organization hopes
to sell the "Student Guide to Asia" to
an airline to make up the deficit. The
University contributes free office
space in the Women's Clubhouse.
Six month volunteers pay their
own transportation, while the host
institution supplies room and board.
Since students can earn up to eight
units while overseas, the cost to them
is offset by savings in tuition and room
and board.
Two Year Volunteers
Two year volunteers can expect to
break even. They receive
transportation, living expenses and
health insurance as well as a yearly
vacation allowance of $75. Cost per
volunteer is about one quarter that of
the Peace Corps, although Clark points
out that the training is much different.
Clark feels that VlA's poverty and
freedom from government ties helps it
be accepted in Asia, where rich
Americans are powerful and
mistrusted. "People we work with
realize we really are cheap and this
takes away some of our power. We're
chaotic and somewhat insecure. They
don't feel as threatened by us."
The only reason for an institution
to request a volunteer is that someone
is really needed. "There aren't any
external reasons for them to say yes,"
Clark emphasizes.
As an American group primarily

teaching English, VIA is concerned
about problems of cultural
imperialism. "I went over with guilt
feelings about American imperialism,"
Metzenbaum recalls. "All VIA
people worry about it. What right do
we have teaching English?"
Many of her students were factory
workers employed by American firms
who hoped to get better jobs. She
decided that the Taiwanese could only
win better jobs and managerial
positions from Americans if they
could speak English.
"Asians see English as an
international language," Clark says.
Most technical books and almost all
journals are in English. Inter-Asian
conferences are usually held in
English.
'Culturally-Laden'
"English teaching can be a
culturally-laden activity," Grey Bryan,
associate director of VIA, admits. But
he points out that the Chinese are now
emphasizing the teaching of English.
"We try for materials that are
international, non-culture biased,"
Clark adds. Teachers often use articles
from UN publications.
Volunteers usually live with local
families. Many feel that the
opportunity for class cultural contact
is one of the most valuable assets of
the experience.
Spoke Mandarin
Metzenbaum rented a room from a
family who spoke Mandarin, but no
English. "I was completely submerged
in it. They didn't know much about
America. I stayed away from
Americans almost completely."
"I was so totally immersed in it all
of a sudden," Canade remembers.
However she felt like an observer
rather than a participant in the Korean
way of life. "I used to think when I
was walking up a little dirt road,
looking at the farmers and their wives
working in the fields: I'll never really
feel at home here."
Like most volunteers, she ran into
myths and stereotypes about
Americans. "There was a big myth
about American youth. I really didn't
like Korean men at all. You could
really tell they thought American
women were very loose. ... It was
really weird for them to see a young
American woman traveling alone."
Koreans were intensely curious

about co-ed dorms, pre-marital sex,
and student protest. Dating was a
strange concept.
"Most Americans in Korea are
either missionaries or military. Most
are very, very rude," Canade said.
"Not because they want to be, but
because they don't understand Korean
culture."
The stereotyped American is a
long-haired hippie, a G.I. or a rich
tourist. "You can just see the dollar
signs in their eyes as they welcome
you into their stores," Schoultz said.
Yet when volunteers mastered the
language and customs, they found
Asians extremely friendly and
hospitable.
'Closest Friends'
"I've made some of the closest
friends of my life," Schoultz declares.
Metzenbaum was surprised to find
that, "People there have so much
respect and admiration for America."
The VIA training program tries to
prepare volunteers to fit into a
different culture. "We try to get
people out of their ethnocentricity,"

Bryan explains. "We want to make
people aware of their American values
and assumptions."
University Resources
VIA draws heavily on the
University's resources. Most volunteers
take a miniumum of nine units of VIA
preparation courses before going
overseas. "Preparation for Learning
and Teaching in Asia," offered
through the Education School, is the
core course. Linguistics lecturer Frieda
Politzer offers "Linguistics and the
Teaching of English. "Volunteers also
earn credit for language study. VIA
now teaches Indonesian through
SCIRE and hopes to use the new
special languages program to add
Cebuano (a Philippine language) and
possibly Korean.
Volunteers help teach the
International Center's "English as a
Second Language" courses to gain
classroom experience. "We've had a
phenomenal amount of contact with
the I-Center this year," Bryan said.
"The foreign students have been very
kind in helping us out and in teaching

language courses."
Students agree that VIA provides a
valuable learning experience, but some
doubt its eeal benefit to Asians. "A lot
of volunteers are with VIA as a means
of getting into Asia, not really helping
the Asians that much," a recent
volunteer in Indonesia observes. "The
countries are paying a lot of our
funding. We're burdens in that way
and we should be reciprocating."
"We realize we're going to get a hell
of a lot more out of it than they are,"
Metzenbaum says. A Humanities
major, she is now concentrating on
Asian Studies.
Many returning volunteers continue
their interest in Asia, Clark notes. "It's
cheering to see people who come back
making long term vocational plans in
terms of Asia." The first group in
Hong Kong produced a journalist
stationed in Saigon, another in Tokyo,
an assistant professor of Japanese
language, and a student working on a
doctorate in East Asian Studies. A
large percentage of former volunteers
are in medical school.
