# Effect 'Disastrous'
## Child Care Slashed 
### 
_ Paul N. McCloskey

The first real impact of the President's
impoundment of funds has been its disastrous effect
on child care centers for working mothers.
New HEW regulations, to go into effect March
15, would slash present child care services to the
bone. Hundreds of young mothers in the Bay Area,
presently able to work only by virtue of the
availability of such child care services, will be
required to either give up their jobs and go on
welfare, or find other facilities to care for their
children.
The proposed new regulations would limit a
mother's earnings to no more than one and
one-third times what she is able to get on welfare.
For example, a mother with one child can earn no
more than $253 per month and still keep her child
in a child care center. She and her child would be
entitled to $190 on welfare. A mother with two
children can get approximately $280 per month on
welfare. The new rules provide that if she earns
more than $375 per month she would have to
remove her child from the center. Since
costs-of-living are so high, particularly on the San
Francisco peninsula, we have the absurd result that
the person who is willing to earn an income to
support herself and her children is penalized and
literally forced to stop working.
No Matching Funds
Also, the proposed new regulations would
prevent a child care center from using in-kind
contributions or privately contributed funds from
charitable organizations such as the United Fund to
qualify for federal matching funds.
During a series of constituent meetings in

Sunnyvale last week, I was given documented
personal statements by dozens of mothers who
would be affected by the new regulations and who
will become unwilling welfare recipients if existing
centers in Sunnyvale and San Jose are closed down.
I have joined with 23 California Congressmen
and both California Senators to ask HEW Secretary
Caspar Weinberger to postpone implementation of
the HEW regulations until June 30th, and to hold
public hearings on their impact prior to that time.
Our initial inquiries to HEW indicate that Secretary
Weinberger, who comes from Hillsborough, had no
idea of the drastic impact of the proposal, so there
is a chance HEW will reconsider.
Bureaucracy
The difficulty in the past has been that HEW and
other departments have been controlled by the
nameless, faceless people in the Office of
Management and Budget who are not responsible to
Congress and have little knowledge or care about
the impact of their decisions on individual human
beings.
Just recently, on March Ist, the President set
forth a very sound philosophy when he said:
"A system which penalizes a person for going to
work and rewards a person for going on welfare is
totally alien to the American tradition of
self-reliance and self-respect."
We will try to see that HEW carries out this
philosophy with respect to continuing present child
care centers.
