Times may change. The world.
The Church. Rut one thing never
changes. Our need for each other.
The sick, the poor, the despond
ent are with us still but the Do
minican Sisters of the Sick Poor
try to help... in their own way
with their own gifts.
Their mission is to nurse the
needy in their own homes. Young
and old without regard to race or
religion. To care for the children
left adrift when illness comes.To
keep families together. To bring
comfort to the sick. Peace to the
aged. And to bring Christ's love
to all.
It isn't easy to be a Dominican
Sister of the Sick Poor but the
rewards are far greater than a
patient's smile. For now, this is
reward enough.
If you feel the need of a change,
and you can accept a challenge,
why not find out more about the
worK we do?
