GERMAN STUDIES PROGRAM IN BONN
A new program is planned for Autumn and Winter quarters at the
University of Bonn, Germany. The program provides an opportunity
for graduates and undergraduates who have the necessary com
petence in German to maintain normal progress toward Stanford
degrees while pursuing academic subjects at the University of Bonn.
Simultaneously they will enhance German language proficiency and
have intensive exposure to German life and culture.
Departure from California or New York is about September 1st.
There will be intensive six-week preparation courses in German
language and civilization with an examination which all participants
must pass. This will be followed by attendance at regular classes at
the University of Bonn with the possibility of attending courses in
music, fine arts, etc., in nearby academies as well as the University of
Cologne. Normal course load is 15 units per quarter. Participants pay
regular Stanford tuition plus a surcharge of approximately $175 per
quarter (depending on unpredictable variables), and this includes
transportation from San Francisco or New York to Bonn, room and
board, and academic tuition, as well as field trips, including a one
week trip to Berlin. To apply, see Mr. Hutschneider, Department of
German Studies, or the Stanford Overseas Campuses in Old Union,
before the April 10 deadline.
