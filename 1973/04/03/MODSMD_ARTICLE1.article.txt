# Prof Announces Cold Preventive
## 
### JIM WASCHER BRUCE KADDEN 
Dr. Thomas C. Merigan Jr., a
medicine professor here, and three
British colleagues last month
announced the discovery of a
preventive remedy against the
common cold.
The doctors said they had
successfully tested the agent on human
volunteers, but one warned that
availability to the general public is still
"several years off."
The remedy, known as interferon,
is a protein secreted by human white
blood cells infected by viruses.
Normally, the white cells secrete
interferon in order to prevent the
infection of other cells by the virus.
Effective doses of interferon
produced by currently available
methods cost several thousand dollars
each. Production of each effective
d<*i!y dose now requires purification of
interferon from between 15 and 25
liters of white blood cells obtained
from human donors.
Researchers
Principals in the six-month research
project were: Merigan, professor of
medicine and chief of the division of
infectious diseases at the Stanford
University Medical School, and Drs.
Sylvia E. Reed, Thomas S. Hall and
David A.J. Tyrell, all of the Common
Cold Unit at Harvard Hospital in
Wiltshire, England. The four published
their findings in Lancet, a prestigious
British medical journal.
Their article noted: "This is the
first agent known to prevent common
cold infections in man." During a press
conference last Friday at the Medical
School, Merigan called the discovery a
"preliminary step to show that
interferon might be used in human
infections."
He said that "the practical

application of this preliminary step
will depend on real improvements in
the production of interferon in the
years to come."
Virus Prevented
Over a period of four days, Merigan
and his British colleagues administered
approximately 40 milliliters of
interferon to their volunteers in about
35 doses of nasal spray. The doctors
exposed the volunteers to cold viruses
after the interferon treatment and cold
symptoms were prevented in all 16
cases.
As a control for their experiment,
the doctors administered placebos to
16 other volunteers before exposing
them to the virus. According to the
article, 13 suffered cold symptoms
after exposure.
Merigan explained that interferon
"aborts" cold symptoms because
doctors can administer it "earlier and
in greater quantity" than is normal
when the body itself responds to viral
infection.
'Significant Progress'
He said, "In the last two years,
significant progress has been made in
producing human interferon in
acceptable tissue culture cells other
than white blood cells, and there is
every expectation that greater yields
can be produced in the near future.
"We're putting the burden of
pressure on the cell biologists and the
biochemists," according to Merigan.
Discovery of tissue culture cells which
produce interferon in greater quantity
than white blood cells would reduce
the costs of refining the agent.
Supplies of interferon for Merigan
and his colleagues' study came from
Finland, where the nation's blood
donations are received "all at one
station," allowing easy control of the
methods of collection and refinement
of the interferon.

According to Merigan, "Interferon
holds promise as a broad-spectrum
antiviral agent for respiratory diseases.
Given to people early before a
predicted epidemic or individual
infection, it could protect them
against several types of viruses,"
including influenza.
No Breakthrough
Despite the importance of the
study, Merigan would not call the
findings a breakthrough. "I'd call this
the natural product of a large amount
of work over the years," he
commented.

"We hope that our findings will
stimulate other workers to continue
efforts toward this goal [the cure of
the common cold]," Merigan added.
The British Medical Research
Council sponsored the study, which
the four doctors conducted in England
from July through December last year.
Merigan joined the project while on
sabbatical leave from here.

and his colleagues' study came from

holds promise as a broad-spectrum

predicted epidemic or individual
infection, it could protect them
against several types of viruses,"
including influenza.

COLD PREVENTIVE FOUND — Dr. Thomas C. Merigan Jr., a medicine
professor here, is among four scientists who last month announced they had
discovered a preventive remedy against the common cold. However, practical
application for the remedy is still years away.
Dr. Thomas C. Merigan Jr., a
medicine professor here, and three
British colleagues last month
announced the discovery of a
preventive remedy against the
common cold.
The doctors said they had
successfully tested the agent on human
volunteers, but one warned that
availability to the general public is still
"several years off."
The remedy, known as interferon,
is a protein secreted by human white
blood cells infected by viruses.
Normally, the white cells secrete
interferon in order to prevent the
infection of other cells by the virus.
Effective doses of interferon
produced by currently available
methods cost several thousand dollars
each. Production of each effective
d<*i!y dose now requires purification of
interferon from between 15 and 25
liters of white blood cells obtained
from human donors.
Researchers
Principals in the six-month research
project were: Merigan, professor of
medicine and chief of the division of
infectious diseases at the Stanford
University Medical School, and Drs.
Sylvia E. Reed, Thomas S. Hall and
David A.J. Tyrell, all of the Common
Cold Unit at Harvard Hospital in
Wiltshire, England. The four published
their findings in Lancet, a prestigious
British medical journal.
Their article noted: "This is the
first agent known to prevent common
cold infections in man." During a press
conference last Friday at the Medical
School, Merigan called the discovery a
"preliminary step to show that
interferon might be used in human
infections."
He said that "the practical

application of this preliminary step
will depend on real improvements in
the production of interferon in the
years to come."
Virus Prevented
Over a period of four days, Merigan
and his British colleagues administered
approximately 40 milliliters of
interferon to their volunteers in about
35 doses of nasal spray. The doctors
exposed the volunteers to cold viruses
after the interferon treatment and cold
symptoms were prevented in all 16
cases.
As a control for their experiment,
the doctors administered placebos to
16 other volunteers before exposing
them to the virus. According to the
article, 13 suffered cold symptoms
after exposure.
Merigan explained that interferon
"aborts" cold symptoms because
doctors can administer it "earlier and
in greater quantity" than is normal
when the body itself responds to viral
infection.
'Significant Progress'
He said, "In the last two years,
significant progress has been made in
producing human interferon in
acceptable tissue culture cells other
than white blood cells, and there is
every expectation that greater yields
