# University Influence Powerful
## On Neglect Of Indian History 
### 
Jon Daunt

Because Indian history and
Indian contributions to the
building of this nation are an
integral part of our national
history, Indians ask that these
facts be fully acknowledged
within the framework of our
educational programs. . ..

of Indian Affairs
Are these facts being
acknowledged within the
framework of our educational
programs? The answer is no, and
Leland Stanford Junior University
is a prime example of the
universities, high schools, and
grade schools throughout the
country that have consistently

ignored Native Americans and the
part they played in shaping
America.
Stanford University is a
powerful institution. The
influence of its policies, however
subtle that may be in some cases,
affects an area far greater than the
peninsula. In this case, Stanford's
neglect of Native American
history and culture is not
improving the staying power of
that culture in this country. The
longer Stanford and places like it
wait before they acknowledge the
historical and cultural
contributions of Native Americans
and start passing that information
on to their students, the farther
Native American culture will drift
down the road to oblivion.
About a week before I came to
Stanford last September, I started
reading Bury My Heart at
Wounded Knee. The book aroused
an interest in Native American
history, a subject to which I had
had no exposure throughout my
education. In an innocent way, I
thought it would be nice to take a
course on the subject here at
Stanford, so I blissfully picked up
Courses and Degrees to find the
course that was just right for me.
In 500 pages, I found
nothing—not just nothing for me,
but nothing at all. I then turned
to the Time Schedule and
eventually found one course, a
course offered by the Writing
Center, Stanford's newest
department. •
History
In the meantime, I paid a visit
to the Ombudsman to find out
the reason for this situation. He

simply gave me the names of some
other people to see, including a
history professor who allegedly
used to teach a course on Native
American history. I went to him
ostensibly to obtain units of
directed reading on the subject;
however, I discovered, in addition
to his inability to give me any
units because he was leaving town,
that the course he used to teach
was on the westward movement,
not on Native American history as
such.
In further discussion, in which
he recommended some books for
me to read, he let drop a few
expressions, such as "the Custer
massacre 'land "the martyrdom of
Nathan Meeker," leading me to
believe that it was just as well that
he no longer taught his course on
the westward movement.
He was perfectly content with
the history department's program
as it stood, leaving responsibility
for Native American studies
entirely to the anthropology
department. The history of the
white man is History, but the
history of the red man is
anthropology. The same thing is
true with religion. (Next year a
course on Native American
history will be offered, but by the
anthropology department.)
Colonialism
There is no way under the sun
that I can ever possibly
understand the experience of a
Native American here at Stanford
or in America or anywhere,
mainly because I'm white. I'm not
even a WASP, I'm worse.
Protestant I am, but in 1066 my
earliest known ancestor, the Earl

of Dauntre, came to England with
William the Conqueror and helped
him colonize the Anglo-Saxons
and destroy their culture. I'm a
Norman, not an Anglo-Saxon.
My father's father was a
Protestant minister in Catholic
Ireland before partition. He was
responsible for the souls of the
British colonists. My mother's
mother was born and raised (of
white parents) in South Africa.
I come from a long line of
colonizers. This background
separates me even more from the
people of the last true colonies in
the world, the American Indian
reservations.
I cannot understand the
experience of a Native American,
but I do know this: because of the
neglect of Native American
heritage in our schools, white
people are ignorant of their own
origins. Whites in America should
learn sometime that this country
was not based entirely upon noble
democratic principles. We also
have behind us four centuries of
racial conflict fed by insatiable
greed for land and prolonged by
massacres on both sides.
We are affected much more by
this deeply rooted mentality than
by the somewhat esoteric issues to
which one is exposed in many of
Stanford's academic departments,
especially those that are in a
position to remedy the situation
that I have described. I therefore
urge these departments to
acknowledge, in some way at
least, the Native American
contributions to the culture and
history of this country.

he no longer taught his course on
the westward movement.
He was perfectly content with
the history department's program
as it stood, leaving responsibility
for Native American studies
entirely to the anthropology
department. The history of the
white man is History, but the
history of the red man is
anthropology. The same thing is
true with religion. (Next year a
course on Native American
history will be offered, but by the
anthropology department.)
Colonialism
There is no way under the sun
that I can ever possibly
understand the experience of a
Native American here at Stanford
or in America or anywhere,
mainly because I'm white. I'm not
even a WASP, I'm worse.
Protestant I am, but in 1066 my
earliest known ancestor, the Earl

of Dauntre, came to England with
William the Conqueror and helped
him colonize the Anglo-Saxons
and destroy their culture. I'm a
Norman, not an Anglo-Saxon.
My father's father was a
Protestant minister in Catholic
Ireland before partition. He was
responsible for the souls of the
British colonists. My mother's
mother was born and raised (of
white parents) in South Africa.
I come from a long line of
colonizers. This background
separates me even more from the
people of the last true colonies in
the world, the American Indian
reservations.
I cannot understand the
experience of a Native American,
but I do know this: because of the
neglect of Native American
heritage in our schools, white
people are ignorant of their own
origins. Whites in America should
learn sometime that this country
was not based entirely upon noble
democratic principles. We also
have behind us four centuries of
racial conflict fed by insatiable
greed for land and prolonged by
massacres on both sides.
We are affected much more by
this deeply rooted mentality than
by the somewhat esoteric issues to
which one is exposed in many of
Stanford's academic departments,
especially those that are in a
position to remedy the situation
that I have described. I therefore
urge these departments to
acknowledge, in some way at
least, the Native American
contributions to the culture and
history of this country.

Because Indian history and
Indian contributions to the
building of this nation are an
integral part of our national
history, Indians ask that these
facts be fully acknowledged
within the framework of our
educational programs. . ..
Robert L. Bennett, Oneida
former Commissioner
of Indian Affairs
Are these facts being
acknowledged within the
framework of our educational
programs? The answer is no, and
Leland Stanford Junior University
is a prime example of the
universities, high schools, and
grade schools throughout the
country that have consistently

ignored Native Americans and the
part they played in shaping
America.
Stanford University is a
powerful institution. The
influence of its policies, however
subtle that may be in some cases,
affects an area far greater than the
peninsula. In this case, Stanford's
neglect of Native American
history and culture is not
improving the staying power of
that culture in this country. The
longer Stanford and places like it
wait before they acknowledge the
historical and cultural
contributions of Native Americans
and start passing that information
on to their students, the farther
Native American culture will drift
down the road to oblivion.
About a week before I came to
Stanford last September, I started
reading Bury My Heart at
Wounded Knee. The book aroused
an interest in Native American
history, a subject to which I had
had no exposure throughout my
education. In an innocent way, I
thought it would be nice to take a
course on the subject here at
Stanford, so I blissfully picked up
Courses and Degrees to find the
course that was just right for me.
In 500 pages, I found
nothing—not just nothing for me,
but nothing at all. I then turned
to the Time Schedule and
eventually found one course, a
course offered by the Writing
Center, Stanford's newest
department. •
History
In the meantime, I paid a visit
to the Ombudsman to find out
the reason for this situation. He

simply gave me the names of some
other people to see, including a
history professor who allegedly
used to teach a course on Native
American history. I went to him
ostensibly to obtain units of
directed reading on the subject;
however, I discovered, in addition
to his inability to give me any
units because he was leaving town,
that the course he used to teach
was on the westward movement,
not on Native American history as
such.
In further discussion, in which
he recommended some books for
me to read, he let drop a few
expressions, such as "the Custer
massacre 'land "the martyrdom of
Nathan Meeker," leading me to
believe that it was just as well that
he no longer taught his course on
the westward movement.

Leland Stanford Junior University
is a prime example of the
universities, high schools, and
grade schools throughout the
country that have consistently

ignored Native Americans and the
part they played in shaping
America.
Stanford University is a
powerful institution. The
influence of its policies, however
subtle that may be in some cases,
affects an area far greater than the
peninsula. In this case, Stanford's
neglect of Native American
history and culture is not
improving the staying power of
that culture in this country. The
longer Stanford and places like it
wait before they acknowledge the
historical and cultural
contributions of Native Americans
and start passing that information
on to their students, the farther
Native American culture will drift
down the road to oblivion.
About a week before I came to
Stanford last September, I started
reading Bury My Heart at
Wounded Knee. The book aroused
an interest in Native American
history, a subject to which I had
had no exposure throughout my
education. In an innocent way, I
thought it would be nice to take a
course on the subject here at
Stanford, so I blissfully picked up
Courses and Degrees to find the
course that was just right for me.
In 500 pages, I found
nothing—not just nothing for me,
but nothing at all. I then turned
to the Time Schedule and
eventually found one course, a
course offered by the Writing
Center, Stanford's newest
department. •
History
In the meantime, I paid a visit
to the Ombudsman to find out
the reason for this situation. He

simply gave me the names of some
other people to see, including a
history professor who allegedly
used to teach a course on Native
American history. I went to him
ostensibly to obtain units of
directed reading on the subject;
however, I discovered, in addition
to his inability to give me any
units because he was leaving town,
that the course he used to teach
was on the westward movement,
not on Native American history as
such.
In further discussion, in which
he recommended some books for
me to read, he let drop a few
expressions, such as "the Custer
massacre 'land "the martyrdom of
Nathan Meeker," leading me to
believe that it was just as well that
he no longer taught his course on
the westward movement.
He was perfectly content with
the history department's program
as it stood, leaving responsibility
for Native American studies
entirely to the anthropology
department. The history of the
white man is History, but the
history of the red man is
anthropology. The same thing is
true with religion. (Next year a
course on Native American
history will be offered, but by the
anthropology department.)
Colonialism
There is no way under the sun
that I can ever possibly
understand the experience of a
Native American here at Stanford
or in America or anywhere,
mainly because I'm white. I'm not
even a WASP, I'm worse.
Protestant I am, but in 1066 my
earliest known ancestor, the Earl

of Dauntre, came to England with
William the Conqueror and helped
him colonize the Anglo-Saxons
and destroy their culture. I'm a
Norman, not an Anglo-Saxon.
My father's father was a
Protestant minister in Catholic
Ireland before partition. He was
responsible for the souls of the
British colonists. My mother's
mother was born and raised (of
white parents) in South Africa.
I come from a long line of
colonizers. This background
separates me even more from the
people of the last true colonies in
the world, the American Indian
reservations.
I cannot understand the
experience of a Native American,
but I do know this: because of the
neglect of Native American
heritage in our schools, white
people are ignorant of their own
origins. Whites in America should
learn sometime that this country
was not based entirely upon noble
democratic principles. We also
have behind us four centuries of
racial conflict fed by insatiable
greed for land and prolonged by
massacres on both sides.
We are affected much more by
this deeply rooted mentality than
by the somewhat esoteric issues to
which one is exposed in many of
Stanford's academic departments,
especially those that are in a
position to remedy the situation
that I have described. I therefore
urge these departments to
acknowledge, in some way at
least, the Native American
contributions to the culture and
history of this country.
