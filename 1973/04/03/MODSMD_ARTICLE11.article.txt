Economists and Rent Control
Editor:
In the last Daily of winter
quarter a few Stanford economists
attacked the campaign of the Palo
Alto Tenants' Union to place a
rent control program on the ballot
next fall. Their arrogant tone
reflects that they don't suffer
daily from the problem of high
rents. From their safety in the
faculty ghetto they claim that
runaway rents don't need control.
They are crying about the coming
dent in the profits of the housing
industry when we tenants use an
elected Rent Control Board to
stop landlords from jacking up
our rents.
Palo Alto is a better city to live
in than most. So, when the
rent-gouging landlords of our city
drive out the poorer people, richer
people move in. Rent control is
designed to prevent this
intensification of economic (and
thus racial) segregation.
The economists also complain
that builders won't build housing
unless it's very profitable. Such a
complaint puts profits before
people. We have a right to shelter
at a price we can afford
regardless of whether somebody
can profit from our problem. We
don't just need housing built in
Palo Alto; we need low-rent
housing. The free market has not,
by itself, produced any of this for
the last five years because it's not
profitable. Only expensive
housing is profitable, but we don't
need any more of this on the few
acres of vacant land left in Palo
Alto for housing. The industry's
solution to the low-rent housing
problem in the U.S. has been to
build mobile homes; but this
doesn't have to be the solution.
Another scare tactic those
Stanford economists use against
holding down rents is that rent
control doesn't work in New York
City, which it doesn't. Of course
there are slums there; but rent
control didn't create them. Just
look at the slums in Washington
and St. Louis where there is no
rent control. Besides, New York
City rent control gives escape
clauses to landlords that we have
plugged up. In New York
landlords can increase their rent
by 15 percent every time there is
a change of occupancy—not so in
Palo Alto. In New York landlords
can get rent increases from the
Board without proving they are
obeying the habitability codes
requiring them to make
repairs—not so in Palo Alto. In
New York newly constructed
houses are free from rent
control" not so in Palo Alto. But
of course the Stanford economists
didn't bother to read the Palo
Alto proposal.
Once again we see our Stanford
intellectuals attacking a
progressive social movement from
their ivory towers high in the
faculty ghetto, while having
nothing in mind that will solve
our problems.

need any more of this on the few
acres of vacant land left in Palo
Alto for housing. The industry's
solution to the low-rent housing
problem in the U.S. has been to
build mobile homes; but this
doesn't have to be the solution.
Another scare tactic those
Stanford economists use against
holding down rents is that rent
control doesn't work in New York
City, which it doesn't. Of course
there are slums there; but rent
control didn't create them. Just
look at the slums in Washington
and St. Louis where there is no
rent control. Besides, New York
City rent control gives escape
clauses to landlords that we have
plugged up. In New York
landlords can increase their rent
by 15 percent every time there is
a change of occupancy—not so in
Palo Alto. In New York landlords
can get rent increases from the
Board without proving they are
obeying the habitability codes
requiring them to make
repairs—not so in Palo Alto. In
New York newly constructed
houses are free from rent
control" not so in Palo Alto. But
of course the Stanford economists
didn't bother to read the Palo
Alto proposal.
Once again we see our Stanford
intellectuals attacking a
progressive social movement from
their ivory towers high in the
faculty ghetto, while having
nothing in mind that will solve
our problems.

Editor:
In the last Daily of winter
quarter a few Stanford economists
attacked the campaign of the Palo
Alto Tenants' Union to place a
rent control program on the ballot
next fall. Their arrogant tone
reflects that they don't suffer
daily from the problem of high
rents. From their safety in the
faculty ghetto they claim that
runaway rents don't need control.
They are crying about the coming
dent in the profits of the housing
industry when we tenants use an
elected Rent Control Board to
stop landlords from jacking up
our rents.
Palo Alto is a better city to live
in than most. So, when the
rent-gouging landlords of our city
drive out the poorer people, richer
people move in. Rent control is
designed to prevent this
intensification of economic (and
thus racial) segregation.
The economists also complain
that builders won't build housing
unless it's very profitable. Such a
complaint puts profits before
people. We have a right to shelter
at a price we can afford
regardless of whether somebody
can profit from our problem. We
don't just need housing built in
Palo Alto; we need low-rent
housing. The free market has not,
by itself, produced any of this for
the last five years because it's not
profitable. Only expensive
housing is profitable, but we don't
need any more of this on the few
acres of vacant land left in Palo
Alto for housing. The industry's
solution to the low-rent housing
problem in the U.S. has been to
build mobile homes; but this
doesn't have to be the solution.
