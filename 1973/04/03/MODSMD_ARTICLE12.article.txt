## Meat And Consumer Power 
### 
Don Tollefson

This week American consumers
have an unprecedented chance to
dramatically increase the power
and effect of what has been a
fledgling consumer movement in
this country.
Despite much publicity,
consumerism in America has, up
to now, been an unfortunately
minor social force. The consumer
movement has achieved many
notable advancements in areas
including auto safety,
t r u th - i n-la be 1 in g, and
truth-in-advertising, but the ranks
of activist consumers have never
been terribly large.
But suddenly an issue has
emerged which could dramatically

aid the consumer movement.
Inflation has been a constant
reality throughout the course of
the Vietnam war, but in recent
weeks the inflation problem has
been reflected in a highly visible
way â€”through rapidly rising
meat prices.
Hamburger
The price of hamburger has
jumped from 89 cents to $1.19 a
pound at one San Francisco
supermarket within the course of
a month, and other meat price
increases have been similarly
steep. And there is growing
evidence that the American
consumer is fed up with this
situation.
Reacting in part to growing
consumer pressure, President
Nixon last week placed a ceiling
on meat prices which went into
effect yesterday, but many
consumers have echoed labor
leader George Meany's charge of
too little, too late.
As a result of price increases,
consumer groups are urging
consumers to boycott meat this
week. The exact results of a
boycott in the highly complex
economic area of meat prices are
unpredictable, but they could be
major ones.
Salt Pork
Those involved in the meat
business are making conflicting
claims of what the effect will be.
Farmers, meat packers,
wholesalers and retailers are
predicting every imaginable result
from massive layoffs to even
higher increases in the future. But
given their vested interest in the
situation, I'd take anything they
say with a healthy dose of salt
pork.

The truth is that we don't
know what will happen.
Everything is contingent on the
level of participation and the
more people who boycott, the
more visible the effects will be.
Regardless of the nature of those
effects, they will undoubtedly
force government and industry
leaders to become more aware of
consumers and consumerism.
There are mu'tiple reasons for
these price increases. But
intelligent government and
industry foresight should've been
able to prevent much of the
problem. If consumers assert
themselves now, perhaps future

problems can be prevented. It
would be patently absurd for
consumers to allow a situation to
continue because of their own
inaction.
At the very least, a meatless
week will result in some
immediate personal savings unless
the prices of rice, noodles, cheese,
Tuna Helper and poultry have
risen dramatically since the
weekend. And aren't we all a little
sick of meat anyway?
Can you remember the last
time you had a good baked
banana?
