# SRI Examines Psychic Functioning

Two Stanford Research
Institute (SRI) Scientists say they
recently conducted laboratory
experiments designed to test for
psychic or psychoenergetic
functioning—that is, the ability to
perceive or manipulate objects
without touching them.
However, the scientists, both
physicists, were quick, to point
out that their experiments,
conducted with two subjects,
represent only preliminary
research.
"We do not claim that either of
these men has psychic powers,"
said Dr. Harold E. Puthoff and

Russell Targ. "We draw no
sweeping conclusions as to the
nature of these phenomena or the
need to call them psychical. We
have observed certain phenomena
with the subjects for which we
have no scientific explanation."
Puthoff, who holds a Stanford
Ph.D., is a specialist in quantum
physics, parapsychology and
paraphysical phenomena; Targ is a
lasers and plasma research expert.
The pair announced their
experiments to a physics
colloquium a week ago at
Columbia University attended by
300 people.
Targ spent six weeks
conducting tests on Uri Geller, 25,
an Israeli whom "Time" magazine
reported as a popular night club

magician until scientists from
Hebrew University "duplicated his
feats and called him a fraud."
However, SRI spokesman
Ronald Deutsch said that Geller's
controversial history "doesn't
invalidate him as a subject for
research." He declined further
comment on the "Time" story.
During the experiments,
partially underwritten by former
astronaut Edgar D. Mitchell,
Geller was able to perceive the
face of a die enclosed in a metal
box on eight consecutive
attempts. Targ estimates the odds
against Geller's randomly guessing
the correct number on the die
face at one in one million.
During another experiment,
Geller was able to tell 12 times in

a row which of ten identical
aluminum cans contained an
object. He did not touch the cans.
Targ says the odds against this are
one in one trillion.
In another experiment, Geller
apparently was able to "perturb"
a Hanson Lab magnetometer
without touching the measuring
head of the instrument.
The scientists designed the
experiments themselves and say
they are intended to be as
"cheat-proof" as possible.
Astronaut Mitchell, one of
three sponsors of the research,
performed several extrasensory
perception experiments while
traveling to and from the moon in
1971. The other funds for the
project come from two

"non-governmental" sources,
Deutsch said. Total cost of the
project is less than $50,000.
