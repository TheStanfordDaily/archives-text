# Stores Report Meat Sales Drop In First Day Of National Boycott
## 
### LARRY FLEECE 
As the nationwide meat boycott begins to pick up
steam, Palo Alto area supermarkets have recorded mild
but noticeable decreases in meat sales.
The consumer boycott, scheduled to run through this
week, is aimed at forcing down the soaring costs of meat
products. Yesterday, an Associated Press survey showed
that many shoppers were bypassing the meat counters in
supermarkets and turning instead to such items as fish,
vegetables, and cheese.
Nationally, the newly-imposed government price
ceilings on beef, lamb, and pork appeared to have little
effect on consumers' determination to boycott high-cost
items. In response to the boycott, Secretary of Commerce
Fredrick B. Dent said yesterday that President Nixon is
seeking to increase the supplies of meat and other
foodstuffs.
Dent said that Nixon is attempting to increase imports,
discontinue export subsidies on food products, ask
Congress to suspend tariffs on incoming foodstuffs when
necessary and increase food-growing acreage allotments.
Prices Dropping
There has been some indication that the boycott is
pushing prices down. According to the Associated Press,
in the Midwest livestock market hogs were dropping as
much as $4 per hundred pounds.
Beyond the effect of the boycott on prices, markets
across the nation have reported the layoffs of scores of
meatcutters and meat packers. In San Mateo County,
secretary-treasurer Carmel Lujan of the Butchers Union
estimated the number of layoffs of union members at 70.
A 1 Francona, manager of Purity Market in the Stanford
Shopping Center, reported a seven to eight percent
decrease in this week's meat sales.
Francona said he anticipates another ten percent
decrease in meat sales as the boycott progresses, and
mentioned that consumers are buying the more
inexpensive meat products such as ground beef in place of
higher-priced sirloin.

According to Francona, the Bay Area Safeway market
chain has recorded a 15 percent decrease in meat sales,
and the Safeway meat plant in Oakland has been forced to
lay off some 80 butchers.
In response to the boycott, Francona said that Purity
Market has cut back the hours of some of its personnel,
and that the market will buy less meat to meet with the
decrease in sales.
But Francona said that although he feels the boycott is
warranted, he doubts that it can be effective. "They [the
boycotters] are hitting the wrong end of the industry."
He said that retail markets, the source of attack for the
boycott, are unable to change the supply and cost of meat
products.
At the Town and Country Market, head butcher Hogey
Svensen said that he intends to maintain a "nice, full
display" of meat products despite the boycott. Svensen
termed the boycott a "sad thing," and said he feels that
"people are getting their money's worth" in meat
purchases.
On Campus
On campus, both the Stanford Food Service and the
Tresidder Food Service are attempting to include
non-meat menu choices for students who wish to
participate in the boycott.
Maxine Anderson, manager of the Stanford Food
Service, said that fish and chicken entries were included
on yesterday's menus, and that students' selections were
observed.
"Though it's too early to tell," Anderson said, "we did
not notice a great deal of student interest in the boycott.
The meat items were chosen as they are regularly."
"However, we feel that the interest should originate
with the students. If enough students come to us with
requests for meatless days, we will be responsive to those
requests." Anderson said that the meat purchasing plans
of the University Commissary have not been altered by
the national boycott.

secretary-treasurer Carmel Lujan of the Butchers Union
estimated the number of layoffs of union members at 70.
A 1 Francona, manager of Purity Market in the Stanford
Shopping Center, reported a seven to eight percent
decrease in this week's meat sales.
Francona said he anticipates another ten percent
decrease in meat sales as the boycott progresses, and
mentioned that consumers are buying the more
inexpensive meat products such as ground beef in place of
higher-priced sirloin.

According to Francona, the Bay Area Safeway market
chain has recorded a 15 percent decrease in meat sales,
and the Safeway meat plant in Oakland has been forced to
lay off some 80 butchers.
In response to the boycott, Francona said that Purity
Market has cut back the hours of some of its personnel,
and that the market will buy less meat to meet with the
decrease in sales.
But Francona said that although he feels the boycott is
warranted, he doubts that it can be effective. "They [the
boycotters] are hitting the wrong end of the industry."
He said that retail markets, the source of attack for the
boycott, are unable to change the supply and cost of meat
products.
At the Town and Country Market, head butcher Hogey
Svensen said that he intends to maintain a "nice, full
display" of meat products despite the boycott. Svensen
termed the boycott a "sad thing," and said he feels that
"people are getting their money's worth" in meat
purchases.
On Campus
On campus, both the Stanford Food Service and the
Tresidder Food Service are attempting to include
non-meat menu choices for students who wish to
participate in the boycott.
Maxine Anderson, manager of the Stanford Food
Service, said that fish and chicken entries were included
on yesterday's menus, and that students' selections were
observed.
"Though it's too early to tell," Anderson said, "we did
not notice a great deal of student interest in the boycott.
The meat items were chosen as they are regularly."
"However, we feel that the interest should originate
with the students. If enough students come to us with
requests for meatless days, we will be responsive to those
requests." Anderson said that the meat purchasing plans
of the University Commissary have not been altered by
the national boycott.
As the nationwide meat boycott begins to pick up
steam, Palo Alto area supermarkets have recorded mild
but noticeable decreases in meat sales.
The consumer boycott, scheduled to run through this
week, is aimed at forcing down the soaring costs of meat
products. Yesterday, an Associated Press survey showed
that many shoppers were bypassing the meat counters in
supermarkets and turning instead to such items as fish,
vegetables, and cheese.
Nationally, the newly-imposed government price
ceilings on beef, lamb, and pork appeared to have little
effect on consumers' determination to boycott high-cost
items. In response to the boycott, Secretary of Commerce
Fredrick B. Dent said yesterday that President Nixon is
seeking to increase the supplies of meat and other
foodstuffs.
Dent said that Nixon is attempting to increase imports,
discontinue export subsidies on food products, ask
Congress to suspend tariffs on incoming foodstuffs when
necessary and increase food-growing acreage allotments.
Prices Dropping
There has been some indication that the boycott is
pushing prices down. According to the Associated Press,
in the Midwest livestock market hogs were dropping as
much as $4 per hundred pounds.
Beyond the effect of the boycott on prices, markets
across the nation have reported the layoffs of scores of
meatcutters and meat packers. In San Mateo County,
secretary-treasurer Carmel Lujan of the Butchers Union
estimated the number of layoffs of union members at 70.
