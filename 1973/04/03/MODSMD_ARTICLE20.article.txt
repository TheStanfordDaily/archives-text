Wertmuller, Franco Zeffirelli.
"Brother Sun, Sister Moon" is
a sumptuous version of the early
life of St. Francis of Assisi,
inspired less by St. Francis' life
than by director Franco
Zeffirelli's eye for pictorial
beauty. The film has its problems,
not the least of which is a
screenplay that manages to make
even the most profound of
thoughts sound banal, and a set of
songs written and sung by British
folksinger Donovan that intrude
anachronistically into the 13th
century story. But the sheer
profusion of rich images provides
at least a visual feast.
Zeffirelli's tale takes up at the
turning point in young Francis 1 life,
when he sets aside worldly
worries, and abjures his
possessions for the life of an

ascetic. Or, in » contemporary
terms that the film certainly
recognizes without pushing on
them too much, young Francis
decides to drop out of his
capitalist imperialist society and
become a flower child.
Francis gathers friends and
fellow-travelers about him;
together they rebuild an old
church for the poor. The real life
Francis was indeed the son of a
wealthy man and left his riches to
found the order of the
Franciscans. As in the film, a
well-born young woman of Assisi
became one of his followers and
ultimately St. Clare. For the rest,
the film is a free rendition of
Francis' life and personality.
Chooses Newcomers
As in his "Romeo and Juliet,"
Zeffirelli chose newcomers for the
lead roles in "Brother Sun, Sister
Moon." His leads, Graham
Faulkner as Francis, Judi Bowker
as Clare, and Leigh Lawson as
Bernardo, Francis' most
understanding friend, endow the
film with a winsome charm and

youthful prettiness, but they lack
backbone.
They seem too fuzzily
motivated. Francis disavows his
life of ease and comfort after
deciding that all ills spring from
the worship of wealth and
material goods. He therefore
embraces poverty and a return to
nature.
He does not protest against a
social system that allows some to
be overbearingly wealthy and
forces other to scrape at life in
sweat shop conditions. To be poor
is a blessing; the point is to be
poverty stricken in the sunshine.
His wealthy young friends need
but watch the bare-foot saint toil
at his church building to realize
the error of their ways and join
him.
But Zeffirelli fails to explain
why some should be so easily
converted and others not at all, or
why the rich leave everything to
join Francis while the poor come
only on Sundays and cling to their
old ways and work the rest of the
week.
No Indication
The actors give no indication
of why this should be so, though,
to be fair, Zeffirelli doesn't give
anyone much of a chance to
develop a many-sided character.

He seems to see his actors as props
for his settings, either
complimenting or contrasting
with the scenery, but always
forming part of the design.
Part of Zeffirelli's problem is
that his script isn't good enough
not to be swallowed up by his
compositions. His first two films,
"The Taming of the Shrew 'land
"Romeo and Juliet," were also
shot with a keen painterly feel to
them. But here the style fits
Shakespeare's rich text and full
characters. In "Brother Sun, Sister
Moon" the whipped cream
sensuality of the images engulfs
everything else.
More than this, Zeffirelli's
visual sense conflicts with his
themes. Though photographer
Ennio Guarnieri's camera captures
the intense beauty and lushness of
nature as Francis sees it, the
gorgeous paraphernalia of the
corrupt nobility gets equal play.
Francis may see the rot behind
the bejeweled statues or the mold
clinging to the gold threaded
fabrics, but Zeffirelli makes it all
gleam for us.
Wins Admiration
In a final confrontation
between Francis and Pope
Innocent 111 (played and almost
over-played by Alec Guinness),

ai lcit.
Francis wins the Pope's
admiration, but definitely loses
out to Zeffirell's reconstruction of
the pomp and circumstance of the
thirteenth century Vatican.
In spite of his superior
morality, Zeffirelli's Francis
seldom seems to be the sort of

dynamic leader he must have
been, and because the character
does not pull the film together,
"Brother Sun, Sister Moon,"
becomes episodic and lacks a
central focus.
Even the images diffuse and
blur, each existing as a separate

bit of beauty rather than as a
building block for the whole.
Perhaps, since the Saint's heart
is clearly in the right place, it
matter that what is
intended as a worshipful portrait
of a man sometimes looks more
like just lip-service to his ideology.
