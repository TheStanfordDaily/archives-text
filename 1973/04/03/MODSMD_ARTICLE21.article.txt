# Bream Gives Flawed Performance
## 
### DOUG SMITH 
English guitarist and lutenist
Julian Bream had an off night last
March 18 at Berkeley's Zellerbach
Hall. He is widely known for both
his dazzling technique and
intelligent musical interpretations,
so it was surprising to hear him
not only drop notes but to play
almost perfunctorily.
The first half of the recital
consisted of lute pieces by
Renaissance masters. A relaxed
"air de cour" was sandwiched
between two sprightly dances, a
branle and a volte, all by Jean
Baptiste Besard. These were
followed by an extraordinary
fantasia of Gregory Huwett
featuring an unusually chromatic
subject. Bream took the piece at
an exciting tempo but paid for it
by fluffing most of the cadential
ornaments.
Two ricercars, a fantasia and a
canzon by Francesco da Milano
were a welcome part of the
program. Francesco was regarded
by his contemporaries (first half
of the 16th century) as the
greatest lutenist of all time, and
he still holds first place among
Continental Renaissance lute

composers, but his considerable
output of very fine compositions
has remained largely unexplored
by today's guitarists and lutenists.
This is probably due to the fact
that his style is intimately
lutenistic and improvisatory,
which makes the music difficult
to comprehend or to perform
convincingly.
Phenomenal Technique
As he does with most lute
music, Bream tends to take
Francesco by storm. His tempi
were quick and rhythms
unflagging. In the ricercar "La
Compagna" he demonstrated his
phenomenal technique with long
strings of lightning-fast
diminutions up and down the
neck. Two pieces by William
Byrd, apparently transcriptions of
keyboard music, closed the
Renaissance half of the program.
Bream is a very impressive
master of the lute, but he is
somewhat misrepresenting the
instrument and its music. He is
fundamentally a concert guitarist
who plays a heavy, tightly-strung
lute as if it were a guitar.
The historical lutes were rather
light and consequently the style

of playing them was not so
powerful. In the Renaissance the
lute was always described as a
sweet instrument which subtly
insinuated itself upon listeners,
but Bream's manner is to
overwhelm his audience.
The guitar half of the program
opened with the Sonata in A

minor by Bach, a transcription
(no doubt Bream's own) of the G
minor solo violin sonata. The
prelude was free and
improvisatory, followed by a
tautly played fugue. Organists
know this piece as the "Fiddle
fugue," and it also exists in Bach's
own transcription for lute.
Famous Version
Bream's recorded version on
guitar is famous and he performed
it here as though it were easy.
Some in the awe-struck audience
began to applaud at its close but
were hushed by the guitarist.
A graceful siciliano made a
lovely contrast to the fugue,
relaxed, softly flowing, and with
gentle probing of the "dolce"
resources of the guitar. The finale,
a presto, does not lie well on the
guitar, and only a very
accomplished guitarist can get
through it at a moderate pace in

his practice room.
Bream sprinted through at high
speed, but it sounded difficult and
a bit rough. All in all the
performance of the Bach was
rather too carefully calculated and
automatic, and the important
element of warmth and humanity
was missing.

Early romanticism was
represented by the Overture in A,
Opus 61, by Mauro Giuliani
(1781-1840), an Italian guitarist
who made his career in Vienna.
The piece is obviously inspired by
opera overtures, and this sort of
thing sounds pretentious on the
guitar; the themes are mostly
trivial to the point of being
humorous.
Virtuoso Section
Fortunately there is a virtuoso
section to show off arpeggios and
runs on the instrument, and that
is just where Bream excels.
However, again it sounded rather
hard, another indication that he
was not having a good night.
Ordinarily Bream has little
chats with his audience between
pieces while retuning his guitar,
but this evening was a regrettable
exception. His wry humor and
British accent contribute a great

deal to the spirit of a recital, and
his remarks on the pieces are
valuable for those in the audience
(probably most of it) who are
unfamiliar with guitar and lute
repertoire.
He finally broke his verbal
silence with a brief introduction
to "Bagatelles," three short pieces
by William Walton composed
about a year ago specifically for
Bream. The arpeggiated waltz has
a persistent rhythm in the bass as
a foundation for exploration of
sonorities. "Alia Cubana" features
snatches of Caribbean melodies,
and again a steady rhythm.
Romantic Vein
The tfiird piece is in the
romantic vein, with clever writing
for artifical* harmonics. Bream's
performance of all three was
energetic, but the music seemed
nonetheless inoffensive.
The official program closed
with Joachin Turina's
"Fandanguillo, Soleares and
Rafaga." As the names suggest,
the pieces are strongly in the
flamenco tradition, but they still
sound modern. This is fine music
and it was very convincingly
played. Three encores by Bach
and Villa-Lobos followed.
The real flaw in the concert
was not a few missed notes but
rather a lack of spontaneity in the
music. There was a feeling in
many of the pieces that Bream
had carefully worked out his
interpretation months or years
ago and was merely cranking them
out for the audience without any
personal involvement.
This is not an uncommon
phenomenon among first-rank
artists who concertize ten months
a year for decades, but Bream has
to my knowledge not been guilty
of it before. In his mien and his
music he seemed bored, and thus I
was, too.

who plays a heavy, tightly-strung
lute as if it were a guitar.
The historical lutes were rather
light and consequently the style

of playing them was not so
powerful. In the Renaissance the
lute was always described as a
sweet instrument which subtly
insinuated itself upon listeners,
but Bream's manner is to
overwhelm his audience.
The guitar half of the program
opened with the Sonata in A

minor by Bach, a transcription
(no doubt Bream's own) of the G
minor solo violin sonata. The
prelude was free and
improvisatory, followed by a
tautly played fugue. Organists
know this piece as the "Fiddle
fugue," and it also exists in Bach's
own transcription for lute.
Famous Version
Bream's recorded version on
guitar is famous and he performed
it here as though it were easy.
Some in the awe-struck audience
began to applaud at its close but
were hushed by the guitarist.
A graceful siciliano made a
lovely contrast to the fugue,
relaxed, softly flowing, and with
gentle probing of the "dolce"
resources of the guitar. The finale,
a presto, does not lie well on the
guitar, and only a very
accomplished guitarist can get
through it at a moderate pace in

his practice room.
Bream sprinted through at high
speed, but it sounded difficult and
a bit rough. All in all the
performance of the Bach was
rather too carefully calculated and
automatic, and the important
element of warmth and humanity
was missing.

Early romanticism was
represented by the Overture in A,
Opus 61, by Mauro Giuliani
(1781-1840), an Italian guitarist
who made his career in Vienna.
The piece is obviously inspired by
opera overtures, and this sort of
thing sounds pretentious on the
guitar; the themes are mostly
trivial to the point of being
humorous.
Virtuoso Section
Fortunately there is a virtuoso
section to show off arpeggios and
runs on the instrument, and that
is just where Bream excels.
However, again it sounded rather
hard, another indication that he
was not having a good night.
Ordinarily Bream has little
chats with his audience between
pieces while retuning his guitar,
but this evening was a regrettable
exception. His wry humor and
British accent contribute a great

deal to the spirit of a recital, and
his remarks on the pieces are
valuable for those in the audience
(probably most of it) who are
unfamiliar with guitar and lute
repertoire.
He finally broke his verbal
silence with a brief introduction
to "Bagatelles," three short pieces
by William Walton composed
about a year ago specifically for
Bream. The arpeggiated waltz has
a persistent rhythm in the bass as
a foundation for exploration of
sonorities. "Alia Cubana" features
snatches of Caribbean melodies,
and again a steady rhythm.
Romantic Vein
The tfiird piece is in the
romantic vein, with clever writing
for artifical* harmonics. Bream's
performance of all three was
energetic, but the music seemed
nonetheless inoffensive.
The official program closed
with Joachin Turina's
"Fandanguillo, Soleares and
Rafaga." As the names suggest,
the pieces are strongly in the
flamenco tradition, but they still
sound modern. This is fine music
and it was very convincingly
played. Three encores by Bach
and Villa-Lobos followed.
The real flaw in the concert
was not a few missed notes but
rather a lack of spontaneity in the
music. There was a feeling in
many of the pieces that Bream
had carefully worked out his
interpretation months or years
ago and was merely cranking them
out for the audience without any
personal involvement.
This is not an uncommon
phenomenon among first-rank
artists who concertize ten months
a year for decades, but Bream has
to my knowledge not been guilty
of it before. In his mien and his
music he seemed bored, and thus I
was, too.

The 'Daily'
Entertainment
English guitarist and lutenist
Julian Bream had an off night last
March 18 at Berkeley's Zellerbach
Hall. He is widely known for both
his dazzling technique and
intelligent musical interpretations,
so it was surprising to hear him
not only drop notes but to play
almost perfunctorily.
The first half of the recital
consisted of lute pieces by
Renaissance masters. A relaxed
"air de cour" was sandwiched
between two sprightly dances, a
branle and a volte, all by Jean
Baptiste Besard. These were
followed by an extraordinary
fantasia of Gregory Huwett
featuring an unusually chromatic
subject. Bream took the piece at
an exciting tempo but paid for it
by fluffing most of the cadential
ornaments.
Two ricercars, a fantasia and a
canzon by Francesco da Milano
were a welcome part of the
program. Francesco was regarded
by his contemporaries (first half
of the 16th century) as the
greatest lutenist of all time, and
he still holds first place among
Continental Renaissance lute

composers, but his considerable
output of very fine compositions
has remained largely unexplored
by today's guitarists and lutenists.
This is probably due to the fact
that his style is intimately
lutenistic and improvisatory,
which makes the music difficult
to comprehend or to perform
convincingly.
Phenomenal Technique
As he does with most lute
music, Bream tends to take
Francesco by storm. His tempi
were quick and rhythms
unflagging. In the ricercar "La
Compagna" he demonstrated his
phenomenal technique with long
strings of lightning-fast
diminutions up and down the
neck. Two pieces by William
Byrd, apparently transcriptions of
keyboard music, closed the
Renaissance half of the program.

section to show off arpeggios and
runs on the instrument, and that
is just where Bream excels.
However, again it sounded rather
hard, another indication that he
was not having a good night.
Ordinarily Bream has little
chats with his audience between
pieces while retuning his guitar,
but this evening was a regrettable
exception. His wry humor and
British accent contribute a great

deal to the spirit of a recital, and
his remarks on the pieces are
valuable for those in the audience
(probably most of it) who are
unfamiliar with guitar and lute
repertoire.
He finally broke his verbal
silence with a brief introduction
to "Bagatelles," three short pieces
by William Walton composed
about a year ago specifically for
Bream. The arpeggiated waltz has
a persistent rhythm in the bass as
a foundation for exploration of
sonorities. "Alia Cubana" features
snatches of Caribbean melodies,
and again a steady rhythm.
Romantic Vein
The tfiird piece is in the
romantic vein, with clever writing
for artifical* harmonics. Bream's
performance of all three was
energetic, but the music seemed
nonetheless inoffensive.
The official program closed
with Joachin Turina's
"Fandanguillo, Soleares and
Rafaga." As the names suggest,
the pieces are strongly in the
flamenco tradition, but they still
sound modern. This is fine music
and it was very convincingly
played. Three encores by Bach
and Villa-Lobos followed.
The real flaw in the concert
was not a few missed notes but
rather a lack of spontaneity in the
music. There was a feeling in
many of the pieces that Bream
had carefully worked out his
interpretation months or years
ago and was merely cranking them
out for the audience without any
personal involvement.
This is not an uncommon
phenomenon among first-rank
artists who concertize ten months
a year for decades, but Bream has
to my knowledge not been guilty
of it before. In his mien and his
music he seemed bored, and thus I
was, too.

The 'Daily'
Entertainment
English guitarist and lutenist
Julian Bream had an off night last
March 18 at Berkeley's Zellerbach
Hall. He is widely known for both
his dazzling technique and
intelligent musical interpretations,
so it was surprising to hear him
not only drop notes but to play
almost perfunctorily.
The first half of the recital
consisted of lute pieces by
Renaissance masters. A relaxed
"air de cour" was sandwiched
between two sprightly dances, a
branle and a volte, all by Jean
Baptiste Besard. These were
followed by an extraordinary
fantasia of Gregory Huwett
featuring an unusually chromatic
subject. Bream took the piece at
an exciting tempo but paid for it
by fluffing most of the cadential
ornaments.
Two ricercars, a fantasia and a
canzon by Francesco da Milano
were a welcome part of the
program. Francesco was regarded
by his contemporaries (first half
of the 16th century) as the
greatest lutenist of all time, and
he still holds first place among
Continental Renaissance lute

composers, but his considerable
output of very fine compositions
has remained largely unexplored
by today's guitarists and lutenists.
This is probably due to the fact
that his style is intimately
lutenistic and improvisatory,
which makes the music difficult
to comprehend or to perform
convincingly.
Phenomenal Technique
As he does with most lute
music, Bream tends to take
Francesco by storm. His tempi
were quick and rhythms
unflagging. In the ricercar "La
Compagna" he demonstrated his
phenomenal technique with long
strings of lightning-fast
diminutions up and down the
neck. Two pieces by William
Byrd, apparently transcriptions of
keyboard music, closed the
Renaissance half of the program.
Bream is a very impressive
master of the lute, but he is
somewhat misrepresenting the
instrument and its music. He is
fundamentally a concert guitarist
who plays a heavy, tightly-strung
lute as if it were a guitar.
The historical lutes were rather
light and consequently the style

of playing them was not so
powerful. In the Renaissance the
lute was always described as a
sweet instrument which subtly
insinuated itself upon listeners,
but Bream's manner is to
overwhelm his audience.
The guitar half of the program
opened with the Sonata in A

minor by Bach, a transcription
(no doubt Bream's own) of the G
minor solo violin sonata. The
prelude was free and
improvisatory, followed by a
tautly played fugue. Organists
know this piece as the "Fiddle
fugue," and it also exists in Bach's
own transcription for lute.
Famous Version
Bream's recorded version on
guitar is famous and he performed
it here as though it were easy.
Some in the awe-struck audience
began to applaud at its close but
were hushed by the guitarist.
A graceful siciliano made a
lovely contrast to the fugue,
relaxed, softly flowing, and with
gentle probing of the "dolce"
resources of the guitar. The finale,
a presto, does not lie well on the
guitar, and only a very
accomplished guitarist can get
through it at a moderate pace in

his practice room.
Bream sprinted through at high
speed, but it sounded difficult and
a bit rough. All in all the
performance of the Bach was
rather too carefully calculated and
automatic, and the important
element of warmth and humanity
was missing.

Early romanticism was
represented by the Overture in A,
Opus 61, by Mauro Giuliani
(1781-1840), an Italian guitarist
who made his career in Vienna.
The piece is obviously inspired by
opera overtures, and this sort of
thing sounds pretentious on the
guitar; the themes are mostly
trivial to the point of being
humorous.

Fortunately there is a virtuoso
