# Seiji Ozawa Returns To Conduct S.F. Concerts
## 
### DEREK ALLISON MARK OREGLIA 
The concerts of March 28 to
31 marked the return of Maestro
Seiji Ozawa to the San Francisco
podium after an absence of eight
weeks The ; dienee vocally
displayed its enthusiasm at his
reappearance. The orchestra plays
best under his baton; his style is
more familiar to it and the
difference is remarkable.
The program started with
another entry from Ozawa's
Haydn survey, the last to be
performed during this season. The
Symphony No. 64 in A major,
subtitled by the composer
"Tempora Mutantur (the times
are changing)" came over with
great vigor. Ozawa chose brisk
tempi to preserve the lively spirit
so often lacking in some
performances of Haydn's
symphonies.
In some of the earlier
performances this season of
Haydn's symphonies by the
orchestra, vitality was sacrificed
for clarity. What resulted was a
perfect technical exercise, saved
from tedium only by its shortness.
It may have been because of

the faster than average tempi, but
the clarity usually preserved was
lacking. The horn section, always
the bane of the orchestra, blared
out several times where it was not
supposed to. Some of the runs in
the violin and viola sections came
across blurred, as if a few players
were playing their parts correctly
but were just a little off the pace
of the other members of the
section.
Piece Lives
Yet Ozawa made this piece
live; despite technical flaws, we
enjoyed the piece far more than
we would have if it had been a
conglomeration of excellently
executed scales played coldly.
The second selection on the
program was, like the Haydn, a
San Francisco premiere, Leonard
Bernstein wrote his "Serenade for
Violin, String Orchestra, and
Percussion* in 1954. The piece is
beautiful, similar to a violin
concerto in the prominence of the
solo violin. Stuart Canin, the San
Francisco Symphony's
concertmaster, performed the solo
part splendidly, as usual.
The work is based on Plato's
Symposium, a light dialogue

about love and its various aspects.
Plato's work takes the form of an
after-dinner conversation among
assorted Greeks.
Bernstein's Serenade conforms
to Plato's rendering of the
conversation. Phaedrus begins
with a paean to love in general,
extolling its all-encompassing
nature. Analogous to this section
of the Symposium is the opening
violin solo. It is a powerful lyric
statement of the emotional
content of the piece. The passage
entranced; it succeeded in drawing
the audience into this relatively
unfamiliar music.
Lighter Tone
The lighter tone of
Aristophanes' remarks in
parallelled by a lighter mood in
the music. Capricious love is the
subject of this movement.
Bernstein considered the
fourth movement, the Agathon
section, the most moving in the
Serenade. It is, indeed, very
emotional. Highlighting this piece
of the work is a duet between the
solo violin and a cello soloist.
Robert Sayre played the cello part
aptly and with finesse.
The first portion of the last

movement marks a change toward
more seriousness. It is
characterised by a more restrained
tone. The second part of this last
movement is rather surprising.
The it ' of the
conversa* «, in Piato's work by
the late entrance of the drunken
Alcibiades becoms even more
whimsical in Bernstein's hands
than it was in Plato's. The style
changes markedly, indeed
startlingly.
The closing section of the work
is a melange of jazz and
contemporary rhythms and
harmony, with a strong flavor of
Gershwin throughout. These
elements succeed in creating an
orgasmic ending to the dialogue.
The next featured event of the
evening was a decided let-down.
We refer to the intermission show
on the parterre. The fashion, Levi
Strauss & Co. through and
through, was dull. Even a trip to
the basement for an exclusive
interview with the Hospital lady
did not provide any interest
although it did turn up a hot-pink
satin blouse and a lavender
sweater in the buffet area.
Such a disappointing

performance must not be
repeated. Intermission reform is
called for if Symphony is to
compete with ballet and other art
forms.
Quality Restored
The quality of the evening was
restored, however, in the second
half of the musical presentation.
Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto
featured Alexis Weissenberg as the
soloist.

In certain sections of the first
movement, Weissenberg did not
come through over the orchestra,
as if he didn't realize the necessity
of his confronting a huge, rich
orchestral accompaniment. When,
however, he was audible, he
played with technical accuracy
and a good understanding of the
emotion-filled passages. He
grasped what is often referred to
as the passionate Slavic spirit of

the movement. Although we
would like to avoid using such a
cliche when talking about a well
known concerto like this one, the
description fits.
Weissenberg is not a die-hard
romanticist. He does not milk the
expressive parts tor everything
they're worth. Yet >ne cannot
play such an expressi e piece well
without a thorough understanding
of its potential. The concerto is

technically demanding for the
soloist. If he conquers the
technique, its inherent emotion
will, with a little encouragement
from the soloist, come through.
Ability Displayed
Weissenberg displayed his
interpretative ability in the second
movement, the adagio. Here he
played with as much skill as
before, and his interpretation was
incisive.

The third movement, the alia
breve, went beautifully, both for
soloist and orchestra. The
movement is divided into
distinctly separate parts, yet each
theme flowed into the next
without any artificial but
sometimes performed choppiness.
The orchestra served as a fine
compliment to Weissenberg, after
the preliminary imbalance. Ozawa
guided the orchestra with skill,

but he let Weissenberg star as
much as is possible in such a
piece.
Ozawa is above all a
performer's conductor. He treats
his performers with incredible
care, but he never ignores the
orchestra. Of all the conductors
who have performed here this
season, he still is our favorite. It's
good to have him back.

good to have him back.

The Stanford Daily
Entertainment
The concerts of March 28 to
31 marked the return of Maestro
Seiji Ozawa to the San Francisco
podium after an absence of eight
weeks The ; dienee vocally
displayed its enthusiasm at his
reappearance. The orchestra plays
best under his baton; his style is
more familiar to it and the
difference is remarkable.
The program started with
another entry from Ozawa's
Haydn survey, the last to be
performed during this season. The
Symphony No. 64 in A major,
subtitled by the composer
"Tempora Mutantur (the times
are changing)" came over with
great vigor. Ozawa chose brisk
tempi to preserve the lively spirit
so often lacking in some
performances of Haydn's
symphonies.
In some of the earlier
performances this season of
Haydn's symphonies by the
orchestra, vitality was sacrificed
for clarity. What resulted was a
perfect technical exercise, saved
from tedium only by its shortness.
It may have been because of

the faster than average tempi, but
the clarity usually preserved was
lacking. The horn section, always
the bane of the orchestra, blared
out several times where it was not
supposed to. Some of the runs in
the violin and viola sections came
across blurred, as if a few players
were playing their parts correctly
but were just a little off the pace
of the other members of the
section.
Piece Lives
Yet Ozawa made this piece
live; despite technical flaws, we
enjoyed the piece far more than
we would have if it had been a
conglomeration of excellently
executed scales played coldly.
The second selection on the
program was, like the Haydn, a
San Francisco premiere, Leonard
Bernstein wrote his "Serenade for
Violin, String Orchestra, and
Percussion* in 1954. The piece is
beautiful, similar to a violin
concerto in the prominence of the
solo violin. Stuart Canin, the San
Francisco Symphony's
concertmaster, performed the solo
part splendidly, as usual.
The work is based on Plato's
Symposium, a light dialogue

about love and its various aspects.
Plato's work takes the form of an
after-dinner conversation among
assorted Greeks.
Bernstein's Serenade conforms
to Plato's rendering of the
conversation. Phaedrus begins
with a paean to love in general,
extolling its all-encompassing
nature. Analogous to this section
of the Symposium is the opening
violin solo. It is a powerful lyric
statement of the emotional
content of the piece. The passage
entranced; it succeeded in drawing
the audience into this relatively
unfamiliar music.
Lighter Tone
The lighter tone of
Aristophanes' remarks in
parallelled by a lighter mood in
the music. Capricious love is the
subject of this movement.
Bernstein considered the
fourth movement, the Agathon
section, the most moving in the
Serenade. It is, indeed, very
emotional. Highlighting this piece
of the work is a duet between the
solo violin and a cello soloist.
Robert Sayre played the cello part
aptly and with finesse.
The first portion of the last

movement marks a change toward
more seriousness. It is
characterised by a more restrained
tone. The second part of this last
movement is rather surprising.
The it ' of the
conversa* «, in Piato's work by
the late entrance of the drunken
Alcibiades becoms even more
whimsical in Bernstein's hands
than it was in Plato's. The style
changes markedly, indeed
startlingly.
The closing section of the work
is a melange of jazz and
contemporary rhythms and
harmony, with a strong flavor of
Gershwin throughout. These
elements succeed in creating an
orgasmic ending to the dialogue.
The next featured event of the
evening was a decided let-down.
We refer to the intermission show
on the parterre. The fashion, Levi
Strauss & Co. through and
through, was dull. Even a trip to
the basement for an exclusive
interview with the Hospital lady
did not provide any interest
although it did turn up a hot-pink
satin blouse and a lavender
sweater in the buffet area.
Such a disappointing

performance must not be
repeated. Intermission reform is
called for if Symphony is to
compete with ballet and other art
forms.
Quality Restored
The quality of the evening was
restored, however, in the second
half of the musical presentation.
Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto
featured Alexis Weissenberg as the
soloist.

In certain sections of the first
movement, Weissenberg did not
come through over the orchestra,
as if he didn't realize the necessity
of his confronting a huge, rich
orchestral accompaniment. When,
however, he was audible, he
played with technical accuracy
and a good understanding of the
emotion-filled passages. He
grasped what is often referred to
as the passionate Slavic spirit of

the movement. Although we
would like to avoid using such a
cliche when talking about a well
known concerto like this one, the
description fits.
Weissenberg is not a die-hard
romanticist. He does not milk the
expressive parts tor everything
they're worth. Yet >ne cannot
play such an expressi e piece well
without a thorough understanding
of its potential. The concerto is

technically demanding for the
soloist. If he conquers the
technique, its inherent emotion
will, with a little encouragement
from the soloist, come through.
Ability Displayed
Weissenberg displayed his
interpretative ability in the second
movement, the adagio. Here he
played with as much skill as
before, and his interpretation was
incisive.

The third movement, the alia
breve, went beautifully, both for
soloist and orchestra. The
movement is divided into
distinctly separate parts, yet each
theme flowed into the next
without any artificial but
sometimes performed choppiness.
The orchestra served as a fine
compliment to Weissenberg, after
the preliminary imbalance. Ozawa
guided the orchestra with skill,

but he let Weissenberg star as
much as is possible in such a
piece.
Ozawa is above all a
performer's conductor. He treats
his performers with incredible
care, but he never ignores the
orchestra. Of all the conductors
who have performed here this
season, he still is our favorite. It's
good to have him back.

season, he still is our favorite. It's
good to have him back.

The concerts of March 28 to
31 marked the return of Maestro
Seiji Ozawa to the San Francisco
podium after an absence of eight
weeks The ; dienee vocally
displayed its enthusiasm at his
reappearance. The orchestra plays
best under his baton; his style is
more familiar to it and the
difference is remarkable.
The program started with
another entry from Ozawa's
Haydn survey, the last to be
performed during this season. The
Symphony No. 64 in A major,
subtitled by the composer
"Tempora Mutantur (the times
are changing)" came over with
great vigor. Ozawa chose brisk
tempi to preserve the lively spirit
so often lacking in some
performances of Haydn's
symphonies.
In some of the earlier
performances this season of
Haydn's symphonies by the
orchestra, vitality was sacrificed
for clarity. What resulted was a
perfect technical exercise, saved
from tedium only by its shortness.
It may have been because of

the faster than average tempi, but
the clarity usually preserved was
lacking. The horn section, always
the bane of the orchestra, blared
out several times where it was not
supposed to. Some of the runs in
the violin and viola sections came
across blurred, as if a few players
were playing their parts correctly
but were just a little off the pace
of the other members of the
section.
Piece Lives
Yet Ozawa made this piece
live; despite technical flaws, we
enjoyed the piece far more than
we would have if it had been a
conglomeration of excellently
executed scales played coldly.
The second selection on the
program was, like the Haydn, a
San Francisco premiere, Leonard
Bernstein wrote his "Serenade for
Violin, String Orchestra, and
Percussion* in 1954. The piece is
beautiful, similar to a violin
concerto in the prominence of the
solo violin. Stuart Canin, the San
Francisco Symphony's
concertmaster, performed the solo
part splendidly, as usual.
The work is based on Plato's
Symposium, a light dialogue

about love and its various aspects.
Plato's work takes the form of an
after-dinner conversation among
assorted Greeks.
Bernstein's Serenade conforms
to Plato's rendering of the
conversation. Phaedrus begins
with a paean to love in general,
extolling its all-encompassing
nature. Analogous to this section
of the Symposium is the opening
violin solo. It is a powerful lyric
statement of the emotional
content of the piece. The passage
entranced; it succeeded in drawing
the audience into this relatively
unfamiliar music.
Lighter Tone
The lighter tone of
Aristophanes' remarks in
parallelled by a lighter mood in
the music. Capricious love is the
subject of this movement.
Bernstein considered the
fourth movement, the Agathon
section, the most moving in the
Serenade. It is, indeed, very
emotional. Highlighting this piece
of the work is a duet between the
solo violin and a cello soloist.
Robert Sayre played the cello part
aptly and with finesse.
The first portion of the last

movement marks a change toward
more seriousness. It is
characterised by a more restrained
tone. The second part of this last
movement is rather surprising.
The it ' of the
conversa* «, in Piato's work by
the late entrance of the drunken
Alcibiades becoms even more
whimsical in Bernstein's hands
than it was in Plato's. The style
changes markedly, indeed
startlingly.
The closing section of the work
is a melange of jazz and
contemporary rhythms and
harmony, with a strong flavor of
Gershwin throughout. These
elements succeed in creating an
orgasmic ending to the dialogue.
The next featured event of the
evening was a decided let-down.
We refer to the intermission show
on the parterre. The fashion, Levi
Strauss & Co. through and
through, was dull. Even a trip to
the basement for an exclusive
interview with the Hospital lady
did not provide any interest
although it did turn up a hot-pink
satin blouse and a lavender
sweater in the buffet area.
Such a disappointing

performance must not be
repeated. Intermission reform is
called for if Symphony is to
compete with ballet and other art
forms.
Quality Restored
The quality of the evening was
restored, however, in the second
half of the musical presentation.
Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto
featured Alexis Weissenberg as the
soloist.

In certain sections of the first
movement, Weissenberg did not
come through over the orchestra,
as if he didn't realize the necessity
of his confronting a huge, rich
orchestral accompaniment. When,
however, he was audible, he
played with technical accuracy
and a good understanding of the
emotion-filled passages. He
grasped what is often referred to
as the passionate Slavic spirit of

the movement. Although we
would like to avoid using such a
cliche when talking about a well
known concerto like this one, the
description fits.
Weissenberg is not a die-hard
romanticist. He does not milk the
expressive parts tor everything
they're worth. Yet >ne cannot
play such an expressi e piece well
without a thorough understanding
of its potential. The concerto is

technically demanding for the
soloist. If he conquers the
technique, its inherent emotion
will, with a little encouragement
from the soloist, come through.
Ability Displayed
Weissenberg displayed his
interpretative ability in the second
movement, the adagio. Here he
played with as much skill as
before, and his interpretation was
incisive.

The third movement, the alia
breve, went beautifully, both for
soloist and orchestra. The
movement is divided into
distinctly separate parts, yet each
theme flowed into the next
without any artificial but
sometimes performed choppiness.
The orchestra served as a fine
compliment to Weissenberg, after
the preliminary imbalance. Ozawa
guided the orchestra with skill,

but he let Weissenberg star as
much as is possible in such a
piece.
Ozawa is above all a
performer's conductor. He treats
his performers with incredible
care, but he never ignores the
orchestra. Of all the conductors
who have performed here this
season, he still is our favorite. It's
good to have him back.
