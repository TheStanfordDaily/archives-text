# Gould Stars In 'Goodbye'
## 
### ELLEN KENESHEA 
United Artists
Robert Altman, director
Leigh Brackett, screenplay
Raymond Chandler once said
that if he could have picked the
actor to play his detective Philip
Marlowe, he would have chosen
Cary Grant. Seven of Chandler's
Marlowe novels have been filmed,
but Grant has yet to turn up in
the lead role.
Dick Powell became the first
screen Marlowe in 1944 in
"Murder, My Sweet," starting the
string of players that stretched
through Bogart in "The Big
Sleep" down to James Garner in
the 1969 film entitled simply
"Marlowe."
Philip Marlowe has returned to
the screen in 1973, this time in
the guise of Elliott Gould and
under the auspices of director
Robert Altman in "The Long
Goodbye." Gould is called
Marlowe throughout the film, but
bears no other resemblance to
Chandler's detective.
Chandler's Marlowe is a
romantic figure in a wasteland of
people who long ago sold their
romantic notions and their
consciences to pay for money, sex
and power—the accessible goals in
a world without standards.
Virtue Clinging
Marlowe clings to his small set
of virtues—honesty, decency,
maybe love—like a man clutching
at the sole remaining life-boat
after a shipwreck at sea. He never
stops looking for other survivors
to take on board; he never finds
any.
Gould's Marlowe is a wolf in
sheep's clothing. He mumbles his
way uncertainly through his life,
with a rapidly deteriorating sense
of morality. He's a man who can
get pushed around to a certain
point, then he might himself turn
to murder if the inclination
strikes. He isn't any better, or any

different, than the confused souls
around him, and he can't find a
lifeboat either.
Altman and Gould have
created not Marlowe and"The
Long Goodbye," but a black
parody of the same, perhaps
because this year's audiences, or
at least this year's filmmakers,
cannot deal with Chandler's hero
in any other way.
Whatever it is not, 'The Long
Goodbye" is for the most part an
exciting and often very funny
film. It's not consistently good,
and the ending adds a disturbing
note that jars too much with what
has gone before, but there is much
of interest in it.
Loose Narrative
The plot consists of an array of
murders, suicides and
double-crosses tied together by
tangled threads. Altman structures
his narrative loosely, often
focusing on characters and
situations that have no bearing on
the story, but add a note of
friendly insanity, or absurdity to
the ambience.
All of his characters seem
slightly unhinged and unable to
cope with anything in a coherent
way. But then, a confused state of
affairs is par for the course.
Photographer Vilmot
Zsigomand's constantly tracking
camera intrudes itself too much
and becomes annoying at times,
though it may be that he hoped to
parallel the ever shifting moods
and relationships in "The Long
Goodbye."
Altman uses the complex plot
of the film almost as though it
were there only to provide a
slender basis for his characters and
cameos. The actors too treat the
material in an off-handed and yet
self-conscious fashion, aware that
the history of the detective genre
and the spirit of Humphrey
Bogart bear down upon them and
that they're bound to muff his
lines.

Still "The Long Goodbye" has
a spriteliness to it, and Leigh
Brackett's screenplay wavers
between a charming idiocy and
foolishness.
As Marlowe, Gould straddles
the same fence. Mostly he has the
character in hand with a
self-deprecating ease and studied
naivete —a friendly sort with a
nasty streak. He isn't particularly
likeable, but he's often
sympathetic.
Nina van Pallandt plays the
leading lady gracefully and well.
She's more than a match for
anyone else in the film and a quiet
relief from the more antic prone
characters.
Sterling Hayden as her husband
reminds one of a blustery John
Huston. Hayden's Roger Wade is a
bear of a man, boisterous and full
of unrealizable dreams. He's an
aging writer who wants to be king
of the mountain again, but he just
can't cut it with his queen.
Character Transitions
Mark Rydell alternately plays a
chillingly calm gangster who can
suddenly turn murderously
violent, and a talkative faddist
whose speeches may at any moment
lead him off on ridiculous
tangents. Most of Rydell's
transitions are smooth and
convincing, but some of them
draw too much attention to
themselves and distract one from
the film.
But then, "The Long
Goodbye" tends itself to be a
distracted film, with Altman
pushing in too many emotional
directions at once, from the
serious to parody to self-parody.
One almost feels that Altman,
unsure of what exactly to do with
"The Long Goodbye," tried to do
as many things as poaeible hoping
that a style and attitude would
emerge on its own from his
eclectic vision.
They don't, and the film tends
to be an odd combination of the

slick and the slipshod, the very
clever and the very silly.

Robert Altman, director
Leigh Brackett, screenplay
Raymond Chandler once said
that if he could have picked the
actor to play his detective Philip
Marlowe, he would have chosen
Cary Grant. Seven of Chandler's
Marlowe novels have been filmed,
but Grant has yet to turn up in
the lead role.
Dick Powell became the first
screen Marlowe in 1944 in
"Murder, My Sweet," starting the
string of players that stretched
through Bogart in "The Big
Sleep" down to James Garner in
the 1969 film entitled simply
"Marlowe."
Philip Marlowe has returned to
the screen in 1973, this time in
the guise of Elliott Gould and
under the auspices of director
Robert Altman in "The Long
Goodbye." Gould is called
Marlowe throughout the film, but
bears no other resemblance to
Chandler's detective.
Chandler's Marlowe is a
romantic figure in a wasteland of
people who long ago sold their
romantic notions and their
consciences to pay for money, sex
and power—the accessible goals in
a world without standards.
Virtue Clinging
Marlowe clings to his small set
of virtues—honesty, decency,
maybe love—like a man clutching
at the sole remaining life-boat
after a shipwreck at sea. He never
stops looking for other survivors
to take on board; he never finds
any.
Gould's Marlowe is a wolf in
sheep's clothing. He mumbles his
way uncertainly through his life,
with a rapidly deteriorating sense
of morality. He's a man who can
get pushed around to a certain
point, then he might himself turn
to murder if the inclination
strikes. He isn't any better, or any

different, than the confused souls
around him, and he can't find a
lifeboat either.
Altman and Gould have
created not Marlowe and"The
Long Goodbye," but a black
parody of the same, perhaps
because this year's audiences, or
at least this year's filmmakers,
cannot deal with Chandler's hero
in any other way.
Whatever it is not, 'The Long
Goodbye" is for the most part an
exciting and often very funny
film. It's not consistently good,
and the ending adds a disturbing
note that jars too much with what
has gone before, but there is much
of interest in it.
Loose Narrative
The plot consists of an array of
murders, suicides and
double-crosses tied together by
tangled threads. Altman structures
his narrative loosely, often
focusing on characters and
situations that have no bearing on
the story, but add a note of
friendly insanity, or absurdity to
the ambience.
All of his characters seem
slightly unhinged and unable to
cope with anything in a coherent
way. But then, a confused state of
affairs is par for the course.
Photographer Vilmot
Zsigomand's constantly tracking
camera intrudes itself too much
and becomes annoying at times,
though it may be that he hoped to
parallel the ever shifting moods
and relationships in "The Long
Goodbye."
Altman uses the complex plot
of the film almost as though it
were there only to provide a
slender basis for his characters and
cameos. The actors too treat the
material in an off-handed and yet
self-conscious fashion, aware that
the history of the detective genre
and the spirit of Humphrey
Bogart bear down upon them and
that they're bound to muff his
lines.

Still "The Long Goodbye" has
a spriteliness to it, and Leigh
Brackett's screenplay wavers
between a charming idiocy and
foolishness.
As Marlowe, Gould straddles
the same fence. Mostly he has the
character in hand with a
self-deprecating ease and studied
naivete —a friendly sort with a
nasty streak. He isn't particularly
likeable, but he's often
sympathetic.
Nina van Pallandt plays the
leading lady gracefully and well.
She's more than a match for
anyone else in the film and a quiet
relief from the more antic prone
characters.
Sterling Hayden as her husband
reminds one of a blustery John
Huston. Hayden's Roger Wade is a
bear of a man, boisterous and full
of unrealizable dreams. He's an
aging writer who wants to be king
of the mountain again, but he just
can't cut it with his queen.
Character Transitions
Mark Rydell alternately plays a
chillingly calm gangster who can
suddenly turn murderously
violent, and a talkative faddist
whose speeches may at any moment
lead him off on ridiculous
tangents. Most of Rydell's
transitions are smooth and
convincing, but some of them
draw too much attention to
themselves and distract one from
the film.
But then, "The Long
Goodbye" tends itself to be a
distracted film, with Altman
pushing in too many emotional
directions at once, from the
serious to parody to self-parody.
One almost feels that Altman,
unsure of what exactly to do with
"The Long Goodbye," tried to do
as many things as poaeible hoping
that a style and attitude would
emerge on its own from his
eclectic vision.
They don't, and the film tends
to be an odd combination of the

slick and the slipshod, the very
clever and the very silly.

Robert Altman, director
Leigh Brackett, screenplay
Raymond Chandler once said
that if he could have picked the
actor to play his detective Philip
Marlowe, he would have chosen
Cary Grant. Seven of Chandler's
Marlowe novels have been filmed,
but Grant has yet to turn up in
the lead role.
Dick Powell became the first
screen Marlowe in 1944 in
"Murder, My Sweet," starting the
string of players that stretched
through Bogart in "The Big
Sleep" down to James Garner in
the 1969 film entitled simply
"Marlowe."
Philip Marlowe has returned to
the screen in 1973, this time in
the guise of Elliott Gould and
under the auspices of director
Robert Altman in "The Long
Goodbye." Gould is called
Marlowe throughout the film, but
bears no other resemblance to
Chandler's detective.
Chandler's Marlowe is a
romantic figure in a wasteland of
people who long ago sold their
romantic notions and their
consciences to pay for money, sex
and power—the accessible goals in
a world without standards.
Virtue Clinging
Marlowe clings to his small set
of virtues—honesty, decency,
maybe love—like a man clutching
at the sole remaining life-boat
after a shipwreck at sea. He never
stops looking for other survivors
to take on board; he never finds
any.
Gould's Marlowe is a wolf in
sheep's clothing. He mumbles his
way uncertainly through his life,
with a rapidly deteriorating sense
of morality. He's a man who can
get pushed around to a certain
point, then he might himself turn
to murder if the inclination
strikes. He isn't any better, or any

different, than the confused souls
around him, and he can't find a
lifeboat either.
Altman and Gould have
created not Marlowe and"The
Long Goodbye," but a black
parody of the same, perhaps
because this year's audiences, or
at least this year's filmmakers,
cannot deal with Chandler's hero
in any other way.
Whatever it is not, 'The Long
Goodbye" is for the most part an
exciting and often very funny
film. It's not consistently good,
and the ending adds a disturbing
note that jars too much with what
has gone before, but there is much
of interest in it.
Loose Narrative
The plot consists of an array of
murders, suicides and
double-crosses tied together by
tangled threads. Altman structures
his narrative loosely, often
focusing on characters and
situations that have no bearing on
the story, but add a note of
friendly insanity, or absurdity to
the ambience.
All of his characters seem
slightly unhinged and unable to
cope with anything in a coherent
way. But then, a confused state of
affairs is par for the course.
Photographer Vilmot
Zsigomand's constantly tracking
camera intrudes itself too much
and becomes annoying at times,
though it may be that he hoped to
parallel the ever shifting moods
and relationships in "The Long
Goodbye."
Altman uses the complex plot
of the film almost as though it
were there only to provide a
slender basis for his characters and
cameos. The actors too treat the
material in an off-handed and yet
self-conscious fashion, aware that
the history of the detective genre
and the spirit of Humphrey
Bogart bear down upon them and
that they're bound to muff his
lines.

Still "The Long Goodbye" has
a spriteliness to it, and Leigh
Brackett's screenplay wavers
between a charming idiocy and
foolishness.
As Marlowe, Gould straddles
the same fence. Mostly he has the
character in hand with a
self-deprecating ease and studied
naivete —a friendly sort with a
nasty streak. He isn't particularly
likeable, but he's often
sympathetic.
Nina van Pallandt plays the
leading lady gracefully and well.
She's more than a match for
anyone else in the film and a quiet
relief from the more antic prone
characters.
Sterling Hayden as her husband
reminds one of a blustery John
Huston. Hayden's Roger Wade is a
bear of a man, boisterous and full
of unrealizable dreams. He's an
aging writer who wants to be king
of the mountain again, but he just
can't cut it with his queen.
Character Transitions
Mark Rydell alternately plays a
chillingly calm gangster who can
suddenly turn murderously
violent, and a talkative faddist
whose speeches may at any moment
lead him off on ridiculous
tangents. Most of Rydell's
transitions are smooth and
convincing, but some of them
draw too much attention to
themselves and distract one from
the film.
But then, "The Long
Goodbye" tends itself to be a
distracted film, with Altman
pushing in too many emotional
directions at once, from the
serious to parody to self-parody.
One almost feels that Altman,
unsure of what exactly to do with
"The Long Goodbye," tried to do
as many things as poaeible hoping
that a style and attitude would
emerge on its own from his
eclectic vision.
They don't, and the film tends
to be an odd combination of the

slick and the slipshod, the very
clever and the very silly.
