Nixon Pledges To Aid Thieu
SAN CLEMENTE — President Nixon and South
Vietnamese President Nguyen Van Thieu yesterday
began discussing Saigon's plea for stepped-up U.S.
economic aid.
After the leaders completed an initial 90-minute
meeting at the Western White House, officials
indicated Nixon had pledged an infusion of U.S. aid
for postwar reconstruction of South Vietnam.
But indications were that Nixon was frowning
upon Thieu's request for a specific U.S. guarantee of
renewed military intervention if North Vietnam
blatently violates the still-fragile ceasefire
agreement.
As he gave Thieu a full military welcome, Nixon
voiced hopes their two days of summit talks would
produce "great steps forward in building the lasting
peace, the real peace that we have fought together
for .. ."
After the two leaders' opening meeting, White
House press secretary Ronald L. Ziegler said they
had reviewed the situation in Indochina and had
"stressed the importance of implementing" the
cease-fire agreement signed two months ago in Paris.
Sources reported the summit was bringing hard
bargaining on economic issues. Ziegler
acknowledged there was "substantial discussion
regarding economic assistance .. . redevelopment
assistance .. . which the United States could
continue to provide to South Vietnam as we move
into the postwar period."
Ervin Rejects White House Offer
WASHINGTON - Sen. Sam J. Ervin Jr. (D-N.C.)
yesterday rejected a White House effort to obtain
special treatment for presidential aides in the
Senate's investigation of the Watergate bugging
affair.
Ervin repeated his vow he will seek the arrests of
White House aides if they do not honor subpoenas
to testify under oath in formal private and public
sessions.
He also told a news conference he believes White
House counsel John W. Dean 111 was involved in a
"conflict of interest" because he apparently
represented key presidential advisers while trying to
learn if they were involved in sabotage and
espionage attempts.
Later yesterday, Ervin and the special Senate
investigating committee he heads were criticized by
presidential press secretary Ronald Ziegler.
The Watergate investigation, Ziegler said, has
been "plagued by irresponsible leaks of tidal wave
proportions" and Ervin should "get his own
disorganized house in order so that the investigation
can go forward in a proper atmosphere of
traditional fairness and due process."
In New York, Republican. National Committee

Chairman George Bush said the President has
nothing to hide, but his efforts to cooperate have
been "drowned in a stream of leaked innuendo and
hearsay."
Ervin had been asked earlier yesterday about
news leaks from the special committee and said
"About all you can do is to pray to the good Lord
to give some people a sense of restraint."
He said he intended to release no such
information "in the absence of concrete evidence of
wrongdoing."
Ervin also said yesterday he has accepted an
invitation by Atty. Gen. Richard G. Kleindienst to
give committee members access to the FBl's own
Watergate investigation.
He said this access includes raw FBI files which
he said would be safeguarded from public exposure
and would not themselves be placed in evidence.
Court Voids Impoundment
ST. LOUIS - The Bth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
ruled yesterday that President Nixon's
impoundment of federal highway construction
funds is illegal.
In a 2-1 decision, the federal panel ruled that
funds appropriated by Congress "are not to be
withheld from obligation for purposes totally
unrelated to the highway program."
Nixon had impounded the money on grounds
that spending it would be inflationary.
The President has impounded some $15 billion
for federal programs on housing, water pollution
control, rural conservation, highways and other
areas.
The appeals court upheld a ruling by Judge
William H. Becker of U.S. District Court in Kansas
City in connection with the impoundment of
highway funds in Missouri.
The ruling was a victory for 20 Democratic
senators, led by Sen. Sam J. Ervin (D-N.C.), who
filed a brief in the case supporting Missouri's right
to receive its highway money on a schedule
established by Congress.
Court Refuses Pipeline Case
WASHINGTON — The future of the controversial
trans-Alaska oil pipeline rested with Congress
yesterday after the Supreme Court declined to enter
the ecological and legislative tangle.
The high court, without comment or dissent,
refused to interfere with a lower court decision
blocking construction of the pipeline to bring oil
from Alaska's North Slope to the seaport of Valdez.
The 789-mile project costing hundreds of
millions of dollars faltered over the lack of a few
feet of right-of-way.
The U.S. Circuit Court here ruled in February
that the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 provided only
54-foot rights-of-way for pipelines over public land.
Since the trans-Alaska project would require
146-foot widths in some places, the circuit court
prevented the Secretary of the Interior from issuing
the necessary permits.
Roderick A. Cameron, executive director of the
Environmental Defense Fund, said, "The court's
action has the effect of putting Congress on the
spot. Congress must now decide whether merely to

amend the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 to permit
wider rights-of-way or to re-examine the specific
issue of the best way responsibly to extract Arctic
petroleum reserves."
The Environmental Defense Fund, one of four
conservation organizations which brought the suit,
favors a pipeline across Canada to the Midwest.
"The all-land route is superior from an
environmental standpoint as well as an economic
viewpoint," Cameron said in a statement.
Shultz: Nixon Would Veto Freeze
WASHINGTON — A bill to freeze prices and rents
would be counterproductive and probably subject
to a veto by President Nixon, Treasury Secretary
George P. Shultz said yesterday.
"The President is strongly opposed to it and I
wouldn't be surprised" at a veto, Shultz told the
House Banking and Currency Committee, where
there is strong backing for the legislation.
Shultz, Agriculture Secrretary Earl Butz and
John T. Dunlop, director of the Cost of Living
Council, appealed to the panel to extend the
President's broad authority to control wages and
prices for another year, without trying to write a
freeze into law.
The bill opposed by the administration would
make the freeze effective March 16. It has the
backing of about 20 members of the 40-member
panel.
"We don't think that it is necessary at this time,
nor is it desirable," Shultz said. "I believe it would
be counterproductive."
In the food area, he said, the answer lies in basic
law of supply and demand.
ITT Admits Chile Offer
WASHINGTON — International Telephone and
Telegraph board chairman Harold S. Geneen
acknowledged yesterday that the firm offered $1
million to the U.S. government to try to block the
election of Marxist Salvador Allende as president of
Chile.
Testifying before a special Senate Foreign
Relations subcommittee, Geneen said the offer to
the White House and the State Department had a
dual purpose — to defeat Allende by uniting his
political opponents or to induce Allende to permit
American firms to recover their investments in
nationalized properties.
Meanwhile, Sen. Frank Church (D-Idaho) said
Secretary of State William P. Rogers has agreed to
appear before the subcommittee.
Geneen said the government did not take him up
on the offer, which was made while Allende's 1970
election hung in the balance in the Chilean
Congress.
"Of course," the ITT chief executive said, "our
thinking was very preliminary and we had no
specific plans."
