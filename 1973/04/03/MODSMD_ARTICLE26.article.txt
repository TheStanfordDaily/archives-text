# Overseas Campuses Director Appointed
## 
### ROBERT BACON 
Mark Mancall, associate professor
of history, will become Director of
Overseas Campuses in mid-July,
succeeding Robert A. Walker.
Mancall will preside over a program
in a state of flux following a
comprehensive evaluation completed
in January. He was a member of the
Presidential Commission chaired by
Law Prof. John Merryman which
studied all the University's overseas
programs.
"The intellectual aspects of the
program ought, I think, to develop in
such a way that western culture is a
major focus but not the only one,"
Mancall stated after his appointment
was announced last week.
He expressed hope that a wider
variety of overseas programs will be
offered in the future. He suggested
that foreign study opportunities might
be offered to graduate students and
alumni as well as undergraduates.
Pluralistic And Flexible
Merryman's commission
recommended comprehensive
renovation of the overseas program to
make its offerings "pluralistic, flexible,
and experimental."

Mancall last week noted the "wide
variety of needs" which students bring
to the overseas campuses; hence, he
said, "we need many types of
programs to accommodate their
objectives."
The commission also suggested that
programs be developed outside
Western Europe.
Unique
Mancall elaborated, "In my
opinion, America is not an European
society or culture. We are
unique .. . America is a truly
international society, with historical
and contemporary interests in Asia,
Africa, and Latin America. I think our
purpose should be to construct a
program which would explore many
facets of the world community."
The Merryman group criticized the
tendency of the present overseas
campuses to become "enclaves,"
isolated from the culture of the
nations in which they are located.
Mancall concurred, saying,
"Individual programs should be such
that they expose students to many
aspects of the intellectual and social
institutions" of the country.
