# United Stanford Employees Near Affiliation With AFL-CIO Union
## 
### VLAE KEESHNER 
United Stanford Employees (USE)
is near reaching an agreement which
would affiliate itself with the Service
Employees Union International
(SEUI) of the AFL-CIO, USE official
reporter Jack Truher said yesterday.
Last week, USE filed petitions with
the National Labor Relations Board
(NLRB) asking for an election on
union representation among 1600
Stanford maintenance and service
workers.
USE contemplates affiliation before
the NLRB-sponsored election. NLRB
officials may fix the date for that
election as early as Friday.
Truher said, "We are fairly
confident that we will be submitting a
proposal to the USE membership at
the Graduate School of Business

Thursday for USE to form an
affiliation with SEUI. In my view, it is
likely that USE will be affiliated with
SEUI within two weeks."
However, Truher stressed that no
specific agreement has been reached,
and that any accord would be subject
to membership approval.
Affiliation Sought
USE members recently asked their
executive committee to negotiate an
affiliation with some national union or
group of unions using three criteria to
decide on affiliation:
— local autonomy for USE.
— University-wide jurisdiction
including the right to organize clerical,
professional, and hospital employees
on campus.
— finding a union or combination
of unions with experience in handling

a unit encompassing a wide range of
jobs.
Truher said SEUI is "particularly
sensitive to the needs of educational
and municipal employees and the
changing nature of the labor force
within the employer unit."
Autonomy Stressed
He also stressed that within the
structure of SEUI, USE would be
autonomous and could possibly form
its own local.
Glenda Jones, USE president, said,
"The negotiation committee [set up
by the executive committee] is still
working and considering several
unions." She did not confirm that an
agreement with any specific union,
such as SEUI, had been reached.
The negotiation committee hopes
to present a recomendation at the
Thursday meeting. At that time a
specific ballot presentation may be
decided upon, Jones said.
Election Next Week?
Ballots calling for USE affiliation
with some other organization would
be distributed to USE members Friday
for voting the following Thursday.
Jones emphasized the need for a
union with wide jurisdiction so most
University employees could eventually
come under one union, in contrast to
the 29 separate labor jurisdictions at
the University of California at
Berkeley.
Both USE and a Joint Council of
two AFL-CIO unions, the Operating
Engineers and the American Federal,
State, City, and Municipal Employees
have circulated petitions calling for the
election.

USE claims to have collected 604
authorization statements calling for
the election. This represents 39
percent of the NLRB-designated labor
unit, well over the 30 percent required
to hold the election.
Last year, the NLRB established a
large union classification including
maintenance workers, lab support
personnel, custodians, food service
workers, and audio visual employees
working at the main campus or the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center,
and University Press Employees not
currently members of a union.
Three groups, including USE,
Teamsters local 856, and the
California School Employees
Association and the Stanford
Employees Association (CSEA-SEA)
attempted to unionize this large
classification, but all these bids were
defeated in NLRB elections last spring.
Examiner To Arrive
According to Joseph Scroggs,
deputy director of Personnel and
Employee Campus Relations, an
NLRB examiner will arrive here Friday
to help resolve several questions
including defining the proposed
bargaining unit.
When these questions have been
resolved, an election will be held, most
likely in early May, after several weeks
of campaigning.
If USE does affiliate with SEUI and
the Joint Council collects enough
authorization statements, two
AFL-CIO-affiliated unions would
appear on the ballot, along with a "no
union" choice.

Affiliation Sought
USE members recently asked their
executive committee to negotiate an
affiliation with some national union or
group of unions using three criteria to
decide on affiliation:
— local autonomy for USE.
— University-wide jurisdiction
including the right to organize clerical,
professional, and hospital employees
on campus.
— finding a union or combination
of unions with experience in handling

a unit encompassing a wide range of
jobs.
Truher said SEUI is "particularly
sensitive to the needs of educational
and municipal employees and the
changing nature of the labor force
within the employer unit."
Autonomy Stressed
He also stressed that within the
structure of SEUI, USE would be
autonomous and could possibly form
its own local.
Glenda Jones, USE president, said,
"The negotiation committee [set up
by the executive committee] is still
working and considering several
unions." She did not confirm that an
agreement with any specific union,
such as SEUI, had been reached.
The negotiation committee hopes
to present a recomendation at the
Thursday meeting. At that time a
specific ballot presentation may be
decided upon, Jones said.
Election Next Week?
Ballots calling for USE affiliation
with some other organization would
be distributed to USE members Friday
for voting the following Thursday.
Jones emphasized the need for a
union with wide jurisdiction so most
University employees could eventually
come under one union, in contrast to
the 29 separate labor jurisdictions at
the University of California at
Berkeley.
Both USE and a Joint Council of
two AFL-CIO unions, the Operating
Engineers and the American Federal,
State, City, and Municipal Employees
have circulated petitions calling for the
election.

USE claims to have collected 604
authorization statements calling for
the election. This represents 39
percent of the NLRB-designated labor
unit, well over the 30 percent required
to hold the election.
Last year, the NLRB established a
large union classification including
maintenance workers, lab support
personnel, custodians, food service
workers, and audio visual employees
working at the main campus or the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center,
and University Press Employees not
currently members of a union.
Three groups, including USE,
Teamsters local 856, and the
California School Employees
Association and the Stanford
Employees Association (CSEA-SEA)
attempted to unionize this large
classification, but all these bids were
defeated in NLRB elections last spring.
Examiner To Arrive
According to Joseph Scroggs,
deputy director of Personnel and
Employee Campus Relations, an
NLRB examiner will arrive here Friday
to help resolve several questions
including defining the proposed
bargaining unit.
When these questions have been
resolved, an election will be held, most
likely in early May, after several weeks
of campaigning.
If USE does affiliate with SEUI and
the Joint Council collects enough
authorization statements, two
AFL-CIO-affiliated unions would
appear on the ballot, along with a "no
union" choice.
United Stanford Employees (USE)
is near reaching an agreement which
would affiliate itself with the Service
Employees Union International
(SEUI) of the AFL-CIO, USE official
reporter Jack Truher said yesterday.
Last week, USE filed petitions with
the National Labor Relations Board
(NLRB) asking for an election on
union representation among 1600
Stanford maintenance and service
workers.
USE contemplates affiliation before
the NLRB-sponsored election. NLRB
officials may fix the date for that
election as early as Friday.
Truher said, "We are fairly
confident that we will be submitting a
proposal to the USE membership at
the Graduate School of Business

Thursday for USE to form an
affiliation with SEUI. In my view, it is
likely that USE will be affiliated with
SEUI within two weeks."
However, Truher stressed that no
specific agreement has been reached,
and that any accord would be subject
to membership approval.
