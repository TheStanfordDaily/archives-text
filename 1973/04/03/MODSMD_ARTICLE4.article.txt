# Burts' Jury Selection To Begin Today
## 
### TERRY ANZUR 
Jury selection begins today in the
trial of Andrea Holman Burt and
Benton Douglas Burt, after a ruling by
San Bernardino County Superior
Court Judge Thomas Halderson
insured that their case will not be
combined with the trial of Jean
Hobson and Robert Seabock.
Hobson, Seabock, and the Burts
face murder charges in connection
with convict Ronald Wayne Beaty's
Chino prison escape last Oct. 6. One
prison guard was killed and another
wounded in the incident. Beaty was
recaptured in December.
The Burts have been jailed in San
Bernardino County since October.
Pre-trial motions and appeals have
delayed the start of the jury selection
process.
At a pre-trial hearing in the
Hobson-Seabock case last Tuesday,
Judge Joseph B. Campbell granted
Deputy District Attorney Joseph
Canty's fifth request for consolidation
of the trials.

Attorney Charles Garry,
representing the Burts, vigorously
opposed consolidation. Consolidation
would delay his clients' trial further,
because the Hobson-Seabock defense
will not be ready for trial for several
months.
Campbell combined the trials
"without prejudice" which allowed for
reconsideration of the decision. He
said he would reconsider if Canty's
appeal to allow introduction of
evidence suppressed by an earlier
pre-trial ruling was denied.

Meanwhile, the 4th District Court
of Appeal set a July 5 hearing date for
the appeal, causing an additional
three-month delay. Garry then offered
to withdraw the original defense
motion that called for suppression of
the evidence.
Motion Withdrawn
Despite Campbell's previous refusal
to allow withdrawal of the motion on
the grounds that it might deny the
defendants' rights under the fourth
amendment (unreasonable search and
seizure), the appellate court reversed

the order of suppression last
Wednesday. Thus, the prosecution's
appeal became moot because the
evidence, which includes documents
taken from the Burts' Hayward
apartment and the Seabock home,
may now be introduced.
Last Friday, Hal dorse n issued a
severance order, separating the Burt
and Hobson-Seabock trials by ruling
that any further delay in the Burts'
case would deny them their
constitutional right to a speedy trial.
