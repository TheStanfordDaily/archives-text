# Golfer Won't Play In Masters
## Robertson Loses Amateur Status 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
Stanford golf star Bruce Robertson
has lost his amateur status, the United
States Golf Association (USGA)
announced yesterday in New York.
The ruling will eliminate Robertson
from the Masters tournament which
begins Thursday at Augusta.
Robertson earned an invitation to
the prestigious Masters event by
finishing sixth in the U.S. Amateur last
September. But just prior to the

USGA declaration, Robertson wired
tournament director Clifford Roberts
in Augusta and withdrew from the
tournament.
A USGA spokesman said the
20-year-old sophomore had admitted
selling a substantial amount of golf
equipment, which is in violation of the
USGA rules governing amateur status.
Rule 1-7 prohibits amateurs from
"receiving payment or compensation,
directly or indirectly, for selling or

promoting the sale of golf
merchandise, at either wholesale or
retail."
The USGA ruled that Robertson
was clearly in violation of that
provision. He sold some of the
merchandise to Stanford students.
The declaration from New York
may also affect the entire Stanford
team, which last week won the Pacific
Coast Invitational tournament at Santa
Barbara. "Even though Roberson's
score did not figure in our winning the
Pacific Coast Invitational, we are,
nonetheless, offering to forfeit the
championship if that be the wish of
the people in Santa Barbara," Athletic
Director Joseph Ruetz said yesterday.
"If we had been advised of Bruce's
difficulty with regard to amateur
standing, he obviously would not have
been entered in that competition,"
Ruetz continued. "His problems are of
a purely private and personal nature. It
is too early to say at this time whether
or not he will be able to regain
amateur standing or intercollegiate
playing ability prior to the conclusion
of the 1973 season."
Stanford would have won the Santa
Barbara toumey even without
Robertson, since only the top four
scores from each six-man team count
toward the team total. Counting
Robertson's score, the Cards finished
three strokes ahead of defending Pac-8
champions USC. Without his score,
Stanford still had a two-stroke margin
over the Trojans and a considerable
edge over the remainder of the
18-team field.
The USGA decision will probably
terminate what promised to be a
brilliant collegiate career for
Robertson. Besides his sixth-place
finish in the U.S. Amateur, Robertson
was runnerup in last year's San
Francisco City tournament, medalist
in the 1971 Trans-Mississippi Amateur,
and medalist in the 1972 Northern
California Amateur.
He has also won several lesser
honors and was generally considered
Northern California's outstanding
amateur golfer in 1972.

INELIGIBLE — Bruce Robertson, Stanford's star golfer, has been declared
ineligible for amateur competition by the United States Golf Association.
Because of this he will not be able to compete in the Masters tournament this
weekend and his college golf career is probably over.
