## Communications 
### 
Lack of communication between administration officials
and students is one of the common problems that
universities across the nation face. Administrators moan that
they don't have enough time to yet out and tune in to
students' thinking while the students feel that their
administrators are unapproachable.
In several key areas, University programs are suffering
due to an inability to sense students desires and needs. The
Overseas Campus program and Tresidder are two of the
more obvious victims of the communication gap on campus.
The new management at Tresidder is trying to tailor its
services to meet student's needs. Idealistically, student
unions are supposed to cater # to students whims and serve as
the social and cultural center of campus. But the student is
also a consumer, and if Tresidder could supply services that
students would use, like a lat night snack bar and recreation
area, its financial condition might improve.
One of the Daily s -most important functions is to aid the
flow of ideas on campus. Our opinions page has served as a
forum for the of the community. In the past, most
discussions have centered around political and social issues
of importance to the Stanford community and the nation.
The opinions page could also be very useful, however, as a
forum for practical ideas about University programs and
services.
By writing a column suggesting a few ideas for a specific
program, and asking for input from the community in the
form of new ideas and reaction, an administrator could get
information that would help him react better to student
needs. We would try and print any letters responding to such
columns in hopes of sparking a public forum on practical
issues.
Columns and letters in the Daily are not an adequate
substitute for a face to face exchange of ideas. We feel,
however, that people of the Stanford community could
profit from an exchange of practical ideas on the Daily
opinions pages.
This happen only if people in charge of programs on
campus take time to write a column explaining their
function and program, suggesting possible changes and
seeking new ideas from the community.
Only if members of every section of the Stanford
community participate seriously in this effort can the poor
communication on this campus be improved.
