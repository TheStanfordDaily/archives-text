# A
						Vicious Myth
## Community? Humbug!

Every so often, some Stanford person—usually a
senior or someone else who can remember back four
years ago—will look up from his crunchy granola
and communicate, either verbally or in print, the
following sentiment:
"Oh dear, what has happened to the Stanford
community? We were once so active, so idealistic, so
inspired, so ... so liberal. Now we just sit around
and watch "The Dating Game" and act like we
don't care if the Republicans are still running the
country."
Granted, those may not be the exact words, but
the feeling remains that somehow we, as a
community, have lost the cutting edge of concern
that once made us a hotbed of revolution, or at least
reform. And the principal focus of the complaint is
that Stanford is no longer a community and if
you're not a community, well, nothing can be done.
Definition
At this point, it might be useful to define what is
meant by "community." In one sense, the
"Stanford community" is nothing more than several
thousand students, faculty, and staff who live and
work in the same general geographical area and
whose reason for being here, directly or indirectly,
is, at least nominally, higher education. In this
sense, the community is nothing more than a
physical fact of reality, and its basic components do
not change much. Thus, one can not really speak of
such a community being lost, or no longer in
existence.
The other sense in which the phrase "Stanford
community" is used, and the one meant by the
complainers when they say that "we" have lost our
activism, implies a collective will, a consensus
opinion expressed by the entire population, and a
"feeling" that certain things should be
accomplished.
With this definition it is possible, as was done by
someone on this page last quarter, to state in effect
that "the Stanford community" expressed its
outrage at the Cambodia invasion in 1970 by
banning ROTC from the campus. At first glance,
this seems perfectly plausible. There were large-scale
protests against ROTC, right, and ROTC was

eventually banned from campus, right, so that
means the community was against ROTC, doesn't
it?
Mental Leaps
Actually, no. It means that a large group of
people were successful in removing ROTC from
campus. It might even mean that a majority of
Stanford students, faculty, and staff were in favor
of its removal. It does not mean that the
"community" favored its removal. Yet many people
here continue to think and speak as if it did.
The same phenomenon occurred during the last
presidential campaign. Many people made the
mental leap from the demonstrable fact that
roughly 75% of those in the immediate Stanford
area favored George McGovern to the conclusion
that the "Stanford community" was for him.
Such a conclusion is at least arrogant and, at
worst, a deliberate falsehood. It is a product of the
type of reasoning which, in its extreme form,
permits all manner of abrogations of human rights
to occur for the sake of "the common good" or
because "the people will it." It is an extension of
the desire to believe that, if most people agree with
me, they all must agree with me, and those who
don't are either dangerously deviant or not worthy
of my consideration.
Vicious
At worst, it is a vicious myth perpetrated by
those who believe that might makes right, that truth
is determined by whoever has the biggest gang and
the strongest weapons, and that their goals will be
achieved by convincing people unwilling to think
for themselves that "the community"—i.e.,
everyone who matters—favors these goals, and who
are they, as insignificant individuals, to resist the
collective will?
In any sense other than that of mere physical
proximity, the entity known as "the Stanford
community" does not exist, nor has it ever existed.
It only approaches reality in the minds of people
who would lather not believe that others think and
act differently from the way they themselves do.
