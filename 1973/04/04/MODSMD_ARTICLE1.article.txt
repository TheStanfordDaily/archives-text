# Rising Tresidder Debts Force Student Job Cuts
## 
### JANET SANDERS 
Tresidder Union's operating deficit
for the 1972-73 school year may be as
high as $240,000, according to the
Union's financial manager, Gordon
Starr.
That figure is some $90,000 over
the previously-projected deficit of
$150,000, and Starr says that unless
the trend is reversed Tresidder
programs may undergo major cutbacks
within the next few years.
The major money-loser is the food
service, which operates both the
Tresidder cafeteria and the Encina Hall
snack bar, Starr told Union service
employees in a recent letter.
"We have made a lot of
improvements this year but they
simply have not been fast enough,"
Starr said yesterday.
"If we do not meet our
commitment to the University to
break even in two years, there is a very
good chance that we will have to cut
down on some services," said Starr.
"The plan we submitted last fall to
fulfill this commitment is in great
jeopardy."
"We're very hopeful that the

University will fund the deficit in full
for this year," he said. Last
September, the University paid the
$288,000 deficit for 1971-1972.
The University is now asking
whether the Union is worth funding or
not, said Dan Williams, associate dean
of student affairs. "Whether it
continues to aid Tresidder depends on
its other financial priorities."
In the meantime, Starr hopes to
trim down the projected deficit by
about $40,000 before the year ends.
In the next two or three weeks, food
prices will go up, and many student
jobs will be eliminated.
Student Labor Cutback
"One of our objectives has been to
have student labor but our financial
goal has overriden that," said Starr.
Last quarter, students contributed a
total of about 450 hours per week of
working time, but Starr plans to
reduce the number of student hours to
approximately 250.
"As far as I know, we will not have
to lay off any students," said Starr.
"There will just not be as many jobs
available for them as last quarter."
Many positions vacated by workers

who are retiring will not be filled.
Besides cutting down on labor
costs, Starr cited other possibilities for
increasing Union revenues. "We are
thinking seriously of opening up the
Encina Snack Bar for late-night
business," he said. There will also be
tighter food controls to cut down on
waste in the kitchen and more
emphasis on competitive purchasing of
goods.
"We hope to find a food service
manager in the next two to three
weeks," said Starr. After a six-month
search, Tresidder hired Joe Xavier last
December. But Xavier quit after just
four days on the job last month.
"He quit becuase he saw the
problems as too overwhelming for him
alone to handle," Starr claimed. "He
just was not willing to put forth the
large effort that was required." Xavier
is now working at UC-Santa Barbara.
Despite the many improvements
made this year, the Union is struggling
under a burden of troubles that began
four years ago. Williams pointed to a
poor image and mismanagement as
problems the current Tresidder
management inherited.

Besides cutting down on labor
costs, Starr cited other possibilities for
increasing Union revenues. "We are
thinking seriously of opening up the
Encina Snack Bar for late-night
business," he said. There will also be
tighter food controls to cut down on
waste in the kitchen and more
emphasis on competitive purchasing of
goods.
"We hope to find a food service
manager in the next two to three
weeks," said Starr. After a six-month
search, Tresidder hired Joe Xavier last
December. But Xavier quit after just
four days on the job last month.
"He quit becuase he saw the
problems as too overwhelming for him
alone to handle," Starr claimed. "He
just was not willing to put forth the
large effort that was required." Xavier
is now working at UC-Santa Barbara.
Despite the many improvements
made this year, the Union is struggling
under a burden of troubles that began
four years ago. Williams pointed to a
poor image and mismanagement as
problems the current Tresidder
management inherited.
Tresidder Union's operating deficit
for the 1972-73 school year may be as
high as $240,000, according to the
Union's financial manager, Gordon
Starr.
That figure is some $90,000 over
the previously-projected deficit of
$150,000, and Starr says that unless
the trend is reversed Tresidder
programs may undergo major cutbacks
within the next few years.
The major money-loser is the food
service, which operates both the
Tresidder cafeteria and the Encina Hall
snack bar, Starr told Union service
employees in a recent letter.
"We have made a lot of
improvements this year but they
simply have not been fast enough,"
Starr said yesterday.
"If we do not meet our
commitment to the University to
break even in two years, there is a very
good chance that we will have to cut
down on some services," said Starr.
"The plan we submitted last fall to
fulfill this commitment is in great
jeopardy."
"We're very hopeful that the

University will fund the deficit in full
for this year," he said. Last
September, the University paid the
$288,000 deficit for 1971-1972.
The University is now asking
whether the Union is worth funding or
not, said Dan Williams, associate dean
of student affairs. "Whether it
continues to aid Tresidder depends on
its other financial priorities."
In the meantime, Starr hopes to
trim down the projected deficit by
about $40,000 before the year ends.
In the next two or three weeks, food
prices will go up, and many student
jobs will be eliminated.
Student Labor Cutback
"One of our objectives has been to
have student labor but our financial
goal has overriden that," said Starr.
Last quarter, students contributed a
total of about 450 hours per week of
working time, but Starr plans to
reduce the number of student hours to
approximately 250.
"As far as I know, we will not have
to lay off any students," said Starr.
"There will just not be as many jobs
available for them as last quarter."
Many positions vacated by workers

who are retiring will not be filled.
