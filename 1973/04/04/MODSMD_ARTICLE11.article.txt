# An Apologist For Authoritarianism
## Justice Rehnquist And The Constitution 
### 
Wayne fl. Bladh

The Constitution, as we all
know, provides for a separation of
powers within the government.
More important, it guarantees the
protection of individual freedoms
embodied in the Bill of Rights.
Under the watchful eye of a
neutral judiciary guided by the
Supreme Court, this Constitution
stands as a bulwark against
overzealous majorities or
governmental agencies which can
infringe on the fundamental rights
of the people.

All this is, of course, the
theory and has rarely if ever been
the reality of our governmental
systlem. Nonetheless, the
Supreme Court now has among its
membership a man who openly
rejects even this theoretical
description of Constitutional
government. That man is William
H. Rehnquist.
When Mr. Rehnquist was
nominated to the Court, the
general view of the press was that
he had a brilliant legal mind. He

was admittedly possessed of
rather bizarre and conservative
views on political and social
questions, but would nonetheless
become a reasonable and fair
judge. What should have been
clear at the time and what is
abundantly clear from even a
cursory examination of his
performance on the Court is that
William Rehnquist cannot be
regarded as anything other than a
clever legal apologist for the
increasingly autocratic exercise of
executive power by the Nixon
Administration. He freely
contorts previous case law and
legal doctrines to achieve
whatever result is most consistent
with his reactionary political
philosophy.
Insensitivity
A brief overview of some of
the positions taken by Mr.
Rehnquist both on and off the
Court will indicate the extent of
his insensitivity, if not outright
hostility, toward the rights of the
people relative to the State and
toward the rights of oppressed
minorities relative to the "silent
majority."
Rehnquist has long been an
opponent of the black liberation
struggle in this country. In a letter
written to the Arizona Republic
in June 1964, he expressed his
complete disagreement with a
public accommodations ordinance
passed unanimously by the
Phoenix city council. He
considered the ordinance "a
drastic restriction on the property
owner" which would result in
"placing a separate indignity on
the proprietor" of private
businesses.
Three years later, he again
wrote the Arizona Republic to
express his opposition to the
attempts of the Phoenix school
superintendent to overcome de
facto segregation in the public
schools. Mr. Rehnquist saw no
need to abandon the
"neighborhood school concept"
in the interests of a "small
minority" which he regarded as
seeking "special privileges." Since
his appointment to the Court Mr.
Rehnquist has written opinions
rejecting challenges to state laws
which discriminated against racial
minorities in the granting of
liquor licenses and welfare
benefits.
Investigation and Inquisition
In the area of "law and order,"
Mr. Rehnquist has condoned
pre-trial detention without bail,
no-knock entries by police,
non-unanimous jury verdicts, and
imposition of tne death penalty.
He has frequently called for severe
limitations on the availability of
federal habeas corpus (the
procedure guaranteed in the
constitution for challenging
unlawful imprisonment). He has
written opinions expanding the
right of police to stop and fris'-'
citizens on the most flimsy of
pretexts and has written
approvingly of the "broad powers
of investigation and inquisition"
now wielded by grand juries.
During his tenure as Assistant
Attorney General, Mr. Rehnquist
exerted his renowned legal skills
to justify the mass arrests of
12,000 people in Washington. The
fact that only a handful of those
arrested were convicted of
anything did not and does not
trouble Mr. Rehnquist.
Mr. Rehnquist is equally
insensitive to the freedoms of
speech and of the press
guaranteed in the First
Amendment. He opposes a
testimonial privalege for newsmen
summoned before grand juries. He
approves of restrictions put on the
free speech of government
employees by a hypersensitive
executive on the ground that
loyalty to the Leader must be
maintained.

Perhaps most disturbing is his
position that extensive
governmental surveillance of
people exercising their right of
peaceful assembly raises no
Constitutional questions
whatever. According to Mr.
Justice Rehnquist, the judiciary
has no role in reviewing
surveillance of the population by
the executive: self-discipline by
the executive branch itself is
adequate to assure against abuses
in information-gathering.
Mr. Rehnquist's political and
judicial philosophy is best
capsulized by reference to his
frequent and virulent diatribes
against what he calls the "New
Barbarians"—those who engage in
civil disobedience, both peaceful
and otherwise. For Mr. Rehnquist,
the overriding principle here is the
"right of the majority to govern."
However, a deeper look at the
substance of Mr. Rehnquist's
philosophy as applied makes clear
that behind this facade of
"majority rule" is the reality of
authoritarianism and statism of
frightening dimensions. For Mr.
Rehnquist the real sin of his "New
Barbarians" is not the use of
violence, but the intolerable fact
of disobedience to any law, no
matter how oppressive it might
be. In fact, Mr. Rehnquist reserves
some of his venom for those
'moderates' who shirk from the

use of necessary force to compel
obedience to valid regulations or
laws."
Apologist
Mr. Rehnquist is not an
isolated phenomenon in the U.S.
today. The entire American
governmental structure is moving
toward the concentration of
economic and political power in
the Executive branch. Congress
has ceded virtually all its powers
to the President—from the
declaration of war to the
appropriation of tax funds. Police
state tactics are becoming more
pervasive in the day-to-day
operations of government at all
levels.
William Rehnquist's presence
on the Supreme Court serves to
facilitate this entire process by
putting an apologist for unbridled
executive power in the very
branch of government designed to
protect the political rights
embodied in the Constitution. Mr.
Justice Rehnquist cannot be
allowed to hide behind the myth
of judicial neutrality and
Constitutional government.
Exposing him for what he is and
what he is doing is a vital first step
toward re-evaluating the role of
the judicial system in the U.S.
today.

The Constitution, as we all
know, provides for a separation of
powers within the government.
More important, it guarantees the
protection of individual freedoms
embodied in the Bill of Rights.
Under the watchful eye of a
neutral judiciary guided by the
Supreme Court, this Constitution
stands as a bulwark against
overzealous majorities or
governmental agencies which can
infringe on the fundamental rights
of the people.

All this is, of course, the
theory and has rarely if ever been
the reality of our governmental
systlem. Nonetheless, the
Supreme Court now has among its
membership a man who openly
rejects even this theoretical
description of Constitutional
government. That man is William
H. Rehnquist.
When Mr. Rehnquist was
nominated to the Court, the
general view of the press was that
he had a brilliant legal mind. He

was admittedly possessed of
rather bizarre and conservative
views on political and social
questions, but would nonetheless
become a reasonable and fair
judge. What should have been
clear at the time and what is
abundantly clear from even a
cursory examination of his
performance on the Court is that
William Rehnquist cannot be
regarded as anything other than a
clever legal apologist for the
increasingly autocratic exercise of
executive power by the Nixon
Administration. He freely
contorts previous case law and
legal doctrines to achieve
whatever result is most consistent
with his reactionary political
philosophy.
Insensitivity
A brief overview of some of
the positions taken by Mr.
Rehnquist both on and off the
Court will indicate the extent of
his insensitivity, if not outright
hostility, toward the rights of the
people relative to the State and
toward the rights of oppressed
minorities relative to the "silent
majority."
Rehnquist has long been an
opponent of the black liberation
struggle in this country. In a letter
written to the Arizona Republic
in June 1964, he expressed his
complete disagreement with a
public accommodations ordinance
passed unanimously by the
Phoenix city council. He
considered the ordinance "a
drastic restriction on the property
owner" which would result in
"placing a separate indignity on
the proprietor" of private
businesses.
Three years later, he again
wrote the Arizona Republic to
express his opposition to the
attempts of the Phoenix school
superintendent to overcome de
facto segregation in the public
schools. Mr. Rehnquist saw no
need to abandon the
"neighborhood school concept"
in the interests of a "small
minority" which he regarded as
seeking "special privileges." Since
his appointment to the Court Mr.
Rehnquist has written opinions
rejecting challenges to state laws
which discriminated against racial
minorities in the granting of
liquor licenses and welfare
benefits.
Investigation and Inquisition
In the area of "law and order,"
Mr. Rehnquist has condoned
pre-trial detention without bail,
no-knock entries by police,
non-unanimous jury verdicts, and
imposition of tne death penalty.
He has frequently called for severe
limitations on the availability of
federal habeas corpus (the
procedure guaranteed in the
constitution for challenging
unlawful imprisonment). He has
written opinions expanding the
right of police to stop and fris'-'
citizens on the most flimsy of
pretexts and has written
approvingly of the "broad powers
of investigation and inquisition"
now wielded by grand juries.
During his tenure as Assistant
Attorney General, Mr. Rehnquist
exerted his renowned legal skills
to justify the mass arrests of
12,000 people in Washington. The
fact that only a handful of those
arrested were convicted of
anything did not and does not
trouble Mr. Rehnquist.
Mr. Rehnquist is equally
insensitive to the freedoms of
speech and of the press
guaranteed in the First
Amendment. He opposes a
testimonial privalege for newsmen
summoned before grand juries. He
approves of restrictions put on the
free speech of government
employees by a hypersensitive
executive on the ground that
loyalty to the Leader must be
maintained.

Perhaps most disturbing is his
position that extensive
governmental surveillance of
people exercising their right of
peaceful assembly raises no
Constitutional questions
whatever. According to Mr.
Justice Rehnquist, the judiciary
has no role in reviewing
surveillance of the population by
the executive: self-discipline by
the executive branch itself is
adequate to assure against abuses
in information-gathering.
Mr. Rehnquist's political and
judicial philosophy is best
capsulized by reference to his
frequent and virulent diatribes
against what he calls the "New
Barbarians"—those who engage in
civil disobedience, both peaceful
and otherwise. For Mr. Rehnquist,
the overriding principle here is the
"right of the majority to govern."
However, a deeper look at the
substance of Mr. Rehnquist's
philosophy as applied makes clear
that behind this facade of
"majority rule" is the reality of
authoritarianism and statism of
frightening dimensions. For Mr.
Rehnquist the real sin of his "New
Barbarians" is not the use of
violence, but the intolerable fact
of disobedience to any law, no
matter how oppressive it might
be. In fact, Mr. Rehnquist reserves
some of his venom for those
'moderates' who shirk from the

use of necessary force to compel
obedience to valid regulations or
laws."
Apologist
Mr. Rehnquist is not an
isolated phenomenon in the U.S.
today. The entire American
governmental structure is moving
toward the concentration of
economic and political power in
the Executive branch. Congress
has ceded virtually all its powers
to the President—from the
declaration of war to the
appropriation of tax funds. Police
state tactics are becoming more
pervasive in the day-to-day
operations of government at all
levels.
William Rehnquist's presence
on the Supreme Court serves to
facilitate this entire process by
putting an apologist for unbridled
executive power in the very
branch of government designed to
protect the political rights
embodied in the Constitution. Mr.
Justice Rehnquist cannot be
allowed to hide behind the myth
of judicial neutrality and
Constitutional government.
Exposing him for what he is and
what he is doing is a vital first step
toward re-evaluating the role of
the judicial system in the U.S.
today.

on the Supreme Court serves to
facilitate this entire process by
putting an apologist for unbridled
executive power in the very
branch of government designed to
protect the political rights

The Constitution, as we all
know, provides for a separation of
powers within the government.
More important, it guarantees the
protection of individual freedoms
embodied in the Bill of Rights.
Under the watchful eye of a
neutral judiciary guided by the
Supreme Court, this Constitution
stands as a bulwark against
overzealous majorities or
governmental agencies which can
infringe on the fundamental rights
of the people.

All this is, of course, the
theory and has rarely if ever been
the reality of our governmental
systlem. Nonetheless, the
Supreme Court now has among its
membership a man who openly
rejects even this theoretical
description of Constitutional
government. That man is William
H. Rehnquist.
When Mr. Rehnquist was
nominated to the Court, the
general view of the press was that
he had a brilliant legal mind. He

was admittedly possessed of
rather bizarre and conservative
views on political and social
questions, but would nonetheless
become a reasonable and fair
judge. What should have been
clear at the time and what is
abundantly clear from even a
cursory examination of his
performance on the Court is that
William Rehnquist cannot be
regarded as anything other than a
clever legal apologist for the
increasingly autocratic exercise of
executive power by the Nixon
Administration. He freely
contorts previous case law and
legal doctrines to achieve
whatever result is most consistent
with his reactionary political
philosophy.
Insensitivity
A brief overview of some of
the positions taken by Mr.
Rehnquist both on and off the
Court will indicate the extent of
his insensitivity, if not outright
hostility, toward the rights of the
people relative to the State and
toward the rights of oppressed
minorities relative to the "silent
majority."
Rehnquist has long been an
opponent of the black liberation
struggle in this country. In a letter
written to the Arizona Republic
in June 1964, he expressed his
complete disagreement with a
public accommodations ordinance
passed unanimously by the
Phoenix city council. He
considered the ordinance "a
drastic restriction on the property
owner" which would result in
"placing a separate indignity on
the proprietor" of private
businesses.
Three years later, he again
wrote the Arizona Republic to
express his opposition to the
attempts of the Phoenix school
superintendent to overcome de
facto segregation in the public
schools. Mr. Rehnquist saw no
need to abandon the
"neighborhood school concept"
in the interests of a "small
minority" which he regarded as
seeking "special privileges." Since
his appointment to the Court Mr.
Rehnquist has written opinions
rejecting challenges to state laws
which discriminated against racial
minorities in the granting of
liquor licenses and welfare
benefits.
Investigation and Inquisition
In the area of "law and order,"
Mr. Rehnquist has condoned
pre-trial detention without bail,
no-knock entries by police,
non-unanimous jury verdicts, and
imposition of tne death penalty.
He has frequently called for severe
limitations on the availability of
federal habeas corpus (the
procedure guaranteed in the
constitution for challenging
unlawful imprisonment). He has
written opinions expanding the
right of police to stop and fris'-'
citizens on the most flimsy of
pretexts and has written
approvingly of the "broad powers
of investigation and inquisition"
now wielded by grand juries.
During his tenure as Assistant
Attorney General, Mr. Rehnquist
exerted his renowned legal skills
to justify the mass arrests of
12,000 people in Washington. The
fact that only a handful of those
arrested were convicted of
anything did not and does not
trouble Mr. Rehnquist.
Mr. Rehnquist is equally
insensitive to the freedoms of
speech and of the press
guaranteed in the First
Amendment. He opposes a
testimonial privalege for newsmen
summoned before grand juries. He
approves of restrictions put on the
free speech of government
employees by a hypersensitive
executive on the ground that
loyalty to the Leader must be
maintained.

Perhaps most disturbing is his
position that extensive
governmental surveillance of
people exercising their right of
peaceful assembly raises no
Constitutional questions
whatever. According to Mr.
Justice Rehnquist, the judiciary
has no role in reviewing
surveillance of the population by
the executive: self-discipline by
the executive branch itself is
adequate to assure against abuses
in information-gathering.
Mr. Rehnquist's political and
judicial philosophy is best
capsulized by reference to his
frequent and virulent diatribes
against what he calls the "New
Barbarians"—those who engage in
civil disobedience, both peaceful
and otherwise. For Mr. Rehnquist,
the overriding principle here is the
"right of the majority to govern."
However, a deeper look at the
substance of Mr. Rehnquist's
philosophy as applied makes clear
that behind this facade of
"majority rule" is the reality of
authoritarianism and statism of
frightening dimensions. For Mr.
Rehnquist the real sin of his "New
Barbarians" is not the use of
violence, but the intolerable fact
of disobedience to any law, no
matter how oppressive it might
be. In fact, Mr. Rehnquist reserves
some of his venom for those
'moderates' who shirk from the

use of necessary force to compel
obedience to valid regulations or
laws."
Apologist
Mr. Rehnquist is not an
isolated phenomenon in the U.S.
today. The entire American
governmental structure is moving
toward the concentration of
economic and political power in
the Executive branch. Congress
has ceded virtually all its powers
to the President—from the
declaration of war to the
appropriation of tax funds. Police
state tactics are becoming more
pervasive in the day-to-day
operations of government at all
levels.
William Rehnquist's presence
on the Supreme Court serves to
facilitate this entire process by
putting an apologist for unbridled
executive power in the very
branch of government designed to
protect the political rights
embodied in the Constitution. Mr.
Justice Rehnquist cannot be
allowed to hide behind the myth

Constitutional government.
Exposing him for what he is and
