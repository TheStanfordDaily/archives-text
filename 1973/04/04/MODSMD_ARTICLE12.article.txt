Beutelsbach and Culture
Editor:
The question of the location of
the German Overseas Campus has
been the topic of much discussion
in Group XXX. We have for some
time now been reading Daily
letters and articles concerning
what happens in Beutelsbach and
what happens in Munich and
what's good about this and bad
about that.
Many of us have been to
Munich. All of us had good times,
but drinking beer with Americans
in the Hofbrau Haus or with
Germans in a Gasthof in the city
just isn't the same as having good
times speaking German with good
friends here in a little Gasthof or
in the Ratskeller here on the Burg.
Last night we had a Fasching
party with fifty to sixty of our
German friends. Right here on our
lonely, isolated, uncultured, and
idyllic hilltop. These were friends
we have made through mutual
friends from past groups, from the
Sparrow's Nest Youth Center in
Beutelsbach, from the Gasthofs in
town, from here on the Burg, etc.,
etc. Many were our brothers and

sisters from our German families.
Right now studying is the most
prevalent activity here. Our homes
in Beutelsbach make great places
to go take a break and be with
great people—or go study in the
quiet.
Munich has been described as a
"cultural center." There are many
different kinds of "culture" and
many "centers" in Germany.
Stuttgart, which is less than
twenty minutes away from h»
offers more culture than m<
us will be able to find time to
advantage of. It seems ther.
always a trip being planned by th>
faculty here on the Burg.
Virtually all of us have taken
advantage of the ballet, concerts,
soccer games, and the bars of
Stuttgart. Tomorrow night
another group is off to another
concert. We can't believe we
would be getting more "cultured"
in Munich.
Don't deny students in future
groups what we are now fortunate
enough to be experiencing. Don't
move our campus.
