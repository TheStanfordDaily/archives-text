# Recruiters Tell Views
## Minority Admissions Report 
### 
"Minority students think that
white universities are abandoning
their commitment to the
education of people of color,"
observes Thorn Rhue, assistant
dean of graduate studies.
Together with Maria Baeza,
assistant to the dean, Rhue's
major responsibility is the
recruitment of minority students
to Stanford's graduate programs.
Since 1968-69, the number of
black and chicano graduate
students here has increased from
77 to 400, while total graduate
enrollment has declined slightly
from 5244 to 4962. In addition,
there now are 22 native American
graduate students and about 100
Asian Americans.
"The response when I was
recruiting two years ago was
absolutely excellent; people's
expectations and hopes were
high," Rhue says. "This year
should have brought the largest
number of minority students ever,
because they are now graduating
from college in greater numbers.
Instead, the response nationally
has gotten worse."
Graduate applications from
persons of color have remained
steady at Stanford this year,
despite the markedly larger
number graduating from colleges
nationally this June.
'More Rejections'
"For whatever reason, black
students hear more often now
about rejections from prestigious
universities than they do
acceptances. Certainly there is a
retrenchment going on at the
national level, and in general
everyone is hearing less about the
importance of educating minority
students," Rhue explains.
Rhue shares this concern about
changing commitments. "After

hearing about minority problems
for four years, people may be
thinking that the problem is
solved. The faculty may be tired
of the issue. Now they're
impressed when they hear white
students saying, 'We can't get into
college because minority students
are taking our places.' "
Rhue acknowledges that there
has been progress at Stanford
since 1967. "The enrollments
have increased; the University has
made a commitment." He and
Baeza now are working with a
committee charged to study the
progress and problems of minority
education here.
Recruitment Difficult
Since she became an assistant
to the dean of graduate studies in
1970, Baeza has found
recruitment of chicano graduate
students particularly difficult
because the chicano community
has been less visible, less
numerous, and less well known
both within and outside the
University.
Baeza sees a major part of her
responsibility as the need to
educate the University about
chicanos. "I haven't really
succeeded yet in separating
chicanos from other minorities in
the minds of people here," she
says.
There are important
differences between chicanos and
other minority groups, Baeza
emphasizes. "Statistically
chicanos have less years of school
and less income than any other
group, with the possible exception
of native Americans. We are
essentially a bilingual people,
another important difference. We
see ourselves as unique, though we
recognize the uniqueness of every
minority gorup."

The message she has to stress
again and again is that "we have a
stake in this system, too. There
are 12 million chicanos in this
country who must be fed and
must be educated."
Both Rhue and Baeza see their
work as a two-way process. They
must work within their respective
communities, talking about the
educational opportunities here.
And they must educate the
Stanford community about its
relationship with and
responsibilities to minority
groups.
Neither is an easy task.
'Raise Expectations'
"The hardest part of talking to
black students is to express what
the University's commitment
actually is—to try to raise people's
expectations but not
unreasonably," says Rhue.
He spends a good deal of time
counseling potential applicants.
"I often have to convince
minority students that they
should not go to graduate school
simply to get a Ph.D. It's not
uncommon for a student to want
a Ph.D., but to be unsure about
the exact area of interest. I have
to stress that white faculty
members look very hard at the
statement of purpose, and they
are uneasy when the goals aren't
very specific.
'Bad Counseling'
"All of these problems reflect
bad counseling. People often
don't know how to approach
prestigious graduate schools,"
Rhue observes.
Both Baeza and Rhue have to
work continuously with faculty
members in interpreting
applications and evaluating
qualifications.
"I think we rely too heavily on
the Graduate Record Examination
scores—on anything that can give
a sense of objectivity," says Rhue.
He suggests that, because
Stanford's graduate applicants
tend to be so highly qualified, the
departments often demand
qualifications far beyond what is
actually required to do graduate
work.
"Beyond a certain level of
demonstrated competence
required to handle the work,
maybe universities need to
evaluate students on the basis of
additional criteria, even though
they may be less 'objective' and
more difficult to use."
Another Problem
Baeza encounters
another problem, also difficult to
resolve. "It's very hard to talk to
the University about percentage
quotas. People are very resistant
to an affirmative quota, at the
same time that they are using
unarticulated quotas.
"Every department is happy to
have two or three minority
students, but it appears some are
rather unhappy if they have more
than that."

white universities are abandoning
their commitment to the
education of people of color,"

dean of graduate studies.

He suggests that, because
Stanford's graduate applicants
tend to be so highly qualified, the
departments often demand
qualifications far beyond what is
actually required to do graduate
work.
"Beyond a certain level of
demonstrated competence
required to handle the work,
maybe universities need to
evaluate students on the basis of
additional criteria, even though
they may be less 'objective' and
more difficult to use."
Another Problem
Baeza encounters
another problem, also difficult to
resolve. "It's very hard to talk to
the University about percentage
quotas. People are very resistant
to an affirmative quota, at the
same time that they are using
unarticulated quotas.
"Every department is happy to
have two or three minority
students, but it appears some are
rather unhappy if they have more
than that."
"Minority students think that
white universities are abandoning
their commitment to the
education of people of color,"
observes Thorn Rhue, assistant
dean of graduate studies.
Together with Maria Baeza,
assistant to the dean, Rhue's
major responsibility is the
recruitment of minority students
to Stanford's graduate programs.
Since 1968-69, the number of
black and chicano graduate
students here has increased from
77 to 400, while total graduate
enrollment has declined slightly
from 5244 to 4962. In addition,
there now are 22 native American
graduate students and about 100
Asian Americans.
"The response when I was
recruiting two years ago was
absolutely excellent; people's
expectations and hopes were
high," Rhue says. "This year
should have brought the largest
number of minority students ever,
because they are now graduating
from college in greater numbers.
Instead, the response nationally
has gotten worse."
Graduate applications from
persons of color have remained
steady at Stanford this year,
despite the markedly larger
number graduating from colleges
nationally this June.
'More Rejections'
"For whatever reason, black
students hear more often now
about rejections from prestigious
universities than they do
acceptances. Certainly there is a
retrenchment going on at the
national level, and in general
everyone is hearing less about the
importance of educating minority
students," Rhue explains.
Rhue shares this concern about
changing commitments. "After

hearing about minority problems
for four years, people may be
thinking that the problem is
solved. The faculty may be tired
of the issue. Now they're
impressed when they hear white
students saying, 'We can't get into
college because minority students
are taking our places.' "
Rhue acknowledges that there
has been progress at Stanford
since 1967. "The enrollments
have increased; the University has
made a commitment." He and
Baeza now are working with a
committee charged to study the
progress and problems of minority
education here.
Recruitment Difficult
Since she became an assistant
to the dean of graduate studies in
1970, Baeza has found
recruitment of chicano graduate
students particularly difficult
because the chicano community
has been less visible, less
numerous, and less well known
both within and outside the
University.
Baeza sees a major part of her
responsibility as the need to
educate the University about
chicanos. "I haven't really
succeeded yet in separating
chicanos from other minorities in
the minds of people here," she
says.
There are important
differences between chicanos and
other minority groups, Baeza
emphasizes. "Statistically
chicanos have less years of school
and less income than any other
group, with the possible exception
of native Americans. We are
essentially a bilingual people,
another important difference. We
see ourselves as unique, though we
recognize the uniqueness of every
minority gorup."

The message she has to stress
again and again is that "we have a
stake in this system, too. There
are 12 million chicanos in this
country who must be fed and
must be educated."
Both Rhue and Baeza see their
work as a two-way process. They
must work within their respective
communities, talking about the
educational opportunities here.
And they must educate the
Stanford community about its
relationship with and
responsibilities to minority
groups.
Neither is an easy task.
'Raise Expectations'
"The hardest part of talking to
black students is to express what
the University's commitment
actually is—to try to raise people's
expectations but not
unreasonably," says Rhue.
He spends a good deal of time
counseling potential applicants.
"I often have to convince
minority students that they
should not go to graduate school
simply to get a Ph.D. It's not
uncommon for a student to want
a Ph.D., but to be unsure about
the exact area of interest. I have
to stress that white faculty
members look very hard at the
statement of purpose, and they
are uneasy when the goals aren't
very specific.
'Bad Counseling'
"All of these problems reflect
bad counseling. People often
don't know how to approach
prestigious graduate schools,"
Rhue observes.
Both Baeza and Rhue have to
work continuously with faculty
members in interpreting
applications and evaluating
qualifications.
"I think we rely too heavily on
the Graduate Record Examination
scores—on anything that can give
a sense of objectivity," says Rhue.
He suggests that, because
Stanford's graduate applicants
tend to be so highly qualified, the
departments often demand
qualifications far beyond what is

"I often have to convince
minority students that they
should not go to graduate school
simply to get a Ph.D. It's not
uncommon for a student to want
a Ph.D., but to be unsure about
the exact area of interest. I have
to stress that white faculty
members look very hard at the
statement of purpose, and they
are uneasy when the goals aren't
very specific.
'Bad Counseling'
"All of these problems reflect
bad counseling. People often
don't know how to approach
prestigious graduate schools,"
Rhue observes.
Both Baeza and Rhue have to
work continuously with faculty
members in interpreting
applications and evaluating
qualifications.
"I think we rely too heavily on
the Graduate Record Examination
scores—on anything that can give
a sense of objectivity," says Rhue.
He suggests that, because
Stanford's graduate applicants
tend to be so highly qualified, the
departments often demand
qualifications far beyond what is
actually required to do graduate
work.
"Beyond a certain level of
demonstrated competence
required to handle the work,
maybe universities need to
evaluate students on the basis of
additional criteria, even though
they may be less 'objective' and
more difficult to use."
Another Problem
Baeza encounters
another problem, also difficult to
resolve. "It's very hard to talk to
the University about percentage
quotas. People are very resistant
to an affirmative quota, at the
same time that they are using
unarticulated quotas.
"Every department is happy to
have two or three minority
students, but it appears some are
rather unhappy if they have more
than that."
"Minority students think that
white universities are abandoning
their commitment to the
education of people of color,"
observes Thorn Rhue, assistant
dean of graduate studies.
Together with Maria Baeza,
assistant to the dean, Rhue's
major responsibility is the
recruitment of minority students
to Stanford's graduate programs.
Since 1968-69, the number of
black and chicano graduate
students here has increased from
77 to 400, while total graduate
enrollment has declined slightly
from 5244 to 4962. In addition,
there now are 22 native American
graduate students and about 100
Asian Americans.
"The response when I was
recruiting two years ago was
absolutely excellent; people's
expectations and hopes were
high," Rhue says. "This year
should have brought the largest
number of minority students ever,
because they are now graduating
from college in greater numbers.
Instead, the response nationally
has gotten worse."
Graduate applications from
persons of color have remained
steady at Stanford this year,
despite the markedly larger
number graduating from colleges
nationally this June.
'More Rejections'
"For whatever reason, black
students hear more often now
about rejections from prestigious
universities than they do
acceptances. Certainly there is a
retrenchment going on at the
national level, and in general
everyone is hearing less about the
importance of educating minority
students," Rhue explains.
Rhue shares this concern about
changing commitments. "After

hearing about minority problems
for four years, people may be
thinking that the problem is
solved. The faculty may be tired
of the issue. Now they're
impressed when they hear white
students saying, 'We can't get into
college because minority students
are taking our places.' "
Rhue acknowledges that there
has been progress at Stanford
since 1967. "The enrollments
have increased; the University has
made a commitment." He and
Baeza now are working with a
committee charged to study the
progress and problems of minority
education here.
Recruitment Difficult
Since she became an assistant
to the dean of graduate studies in
1970, Baeza has found
recruitment of chicano graduate
students particularly difficult
because the chicano community
has been less visible, less
numerous, and less well known
both within and outside the
University.
Baeza sees a major part of her
responsibility as the need to
educate the University about
chicanos. "I haven't really
succeeded yet in separating
chicanos from other minorities in
the minds of people here," she
says.
There are important
differences between chicanos and
other minority groups, Baeza
emphasizes. "Statistically
chicanos have less years of school
and less income than any other
group, with the possible exception
of native Americans. We are
essentially a bilingual people,
another important difference. We
see ourselves as unique, though we
recognize the uniqueness of every
minority gorup."

The message she has to stress
again and again is that "we have a
stake in this system, too. There
are 12 million chicanos in this
country who must be fed and
must be educated."
Both Rhue and Baeza see their
work as a two-way process. They
must work within their respective
communities, talking about the
educational opportunities here.
And they must educate the
Stanford community about its
relationship with and
responsibilities to minority
groups.
Neither is an easy task.
'Raise Expectations'
"The hardest part of talking to
black students is to express what
the University's commitment
actually is—to try to raise people's
expectations but not
unreasonably," says Rhue.
He spends a good deal of time
counseling potential applicants.
"I often have to convince
minority students that they
should not go to graduate school
simply to get a Ph.D. It's not
uncommon for a student to want
a Ph.D., but to be unsure about
