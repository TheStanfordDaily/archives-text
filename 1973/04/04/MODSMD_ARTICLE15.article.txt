# New Chapel Dean To Preach Sunday
## 
### 
The Reverend Robert G.H.
Kelly, the new Dean of the
Chapel, will preach his first
sermon in Memorial Church at the
11 a.m. services Sunday.
Already settling in with his
wife and two children at 659
Salvatierra St. on campus, Kelly is
looking forward to his new duties,
which he said, "will develop as the
year moves along."
He explained he had no plans
or elaborate programs mapped out
either for Memorial Church or the
Religious Studies Program,
although he also expects to teach.
Kelly, 34, was born in South
Africa, educated at Cambridge,
England, and holds a doctorate in
theology from Union Theological
Seminary, New York. This gives
him, he says, "an indefinable
accent." He speaks Afrikaans as
well as German.
Though his mother and two
brothers still reside in three
different South African towns,
Kelly has never been back because
of South Africa's apartheid
policy.
Recent Post
His most recent post was at
McCormick Theological Seminary
in Chicago, which he left for six
months study in Munster,
Germany, on research which has
long fascinated him—the history
of Philo of Alexandria and how he
got his learning.
Philo, a brilliant Jewish
scholar, lived from 20 B.C. to 40
A.D. in Alexandria, Egypt. Kelly's
research shows that Philo's
mission was to make the Jewish
religion understandable to the
Greeks.
"He was convinced that Moses
was smarter than Plato," he said.
Kelly expects to complete a
monograph on Philo soon. His
chief goal is to find out how Philo
got his education—possibly from
the rabbis at the synagogue in
Alexandria, he theorizes, because
Philo was a contemporary of both
Jesus and the Apostle Paul.
'Books of Genesis'
"Philo wrote a commentary on
the Books of Genesis, and his
problems were contemporary
how to make an ancient religion

understandable and relevant to
the times of history," Kelly said.
Kelly was ordained as a
Methodist and is a member of the
church's Southern California
Conference. He has taught at
Scripps College and Claremont
Graduate School, where he was an
organizer of the Black Studies
Center.
He was recommended to
President Richard W. Lyman by a
student-faculty-staff search
committee headed by Prof. John
Mothershead.
Succeeds Brown
He succeeds Religion Prof.
Robert McAfee Brown as dean of
the chapel. Brown served in an
acting capacity after the Rev. B.
Davie Napier was appointed
president of the Pacific School of
Religion last year.
