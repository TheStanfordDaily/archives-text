# Committee Considers Registrar Candidates
## 
### 
Provost William F. Miller has
appointed a search committee to
identify candidates for the
position of registrar here.
Electrical Engineering Prof.
Frederick W. Crawford will serve
as chairman. Other committee
members are: Thomas Cotton,
graduate student in engineering
economic systems; M. Vernon
Johns, Jr., professor of statistics;
Mary Kiely, senior in biological
sciences; James W. Lyons, dean of
student affairs; Sally Mahoney,
associate provost; and Pamela
Straithairn associate professor of
physical education.
The registrar is a principal
agent in the academic
administration of the University.
This controls the registration
process, the official
announcement of curricula and
the assignment of the majority of
the instructional space.

The registrar's operations make
possible the generation of core
data—records of courses of
instruction and student
registration—necessary for
academic assessment and
planning.
These activities require the
management of increasingly
complex information systems and
of a large and varied staff.
"I am committed to a broad
and careful search, including
efforts to identify women and
members of ethnic minorities who
might be suitable candidates. I
expect that the consultative group
will be givorous in their efforts in
this area," Miller noted in his
letter to the search committee.
Robert O. Houghton has been
acting registrar since Harvey Hall,
who served as registrar for 22
years, was appointed University
Ombudsman last August.
