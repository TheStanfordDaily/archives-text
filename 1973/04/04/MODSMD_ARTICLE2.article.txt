# Committee Lags In Producing Report
## 
### JAMES LOBSENZ 
The Ad Hoc Committee of Five
assigned to investigate reasons given by
the Stanford Workshop on Political
and Social Issues (SWOPSI) for turning
down William Shockley's request for a
workshop on genetic factors of
intelligence has still not produced a
report.
The committee was chosen by the
Committee on Undergraduate Studies
(C-US) last October, after President
Richard Lyman personally requested
an investigation.
Political Science Prof. Hubert
Marshall, the Chairman of the Ad Hoc
Committee, maintains, "When I took
the job last fall I thought that we
would finish the job in the autumn
quarter.

"I was so busy during the winter
quarter that we didn't meet at all."
Marshall believes that the committee
will meet again about a week from
now and he estimates that the
committee's report will be released
about a month later.
Report Delay
The initial target date for the
committee's concluding report was
November 15th of last year.
Lyman wrote to Religion Prof.
Edwin Good, the Chairman of the
C-US, on March 7th and questioned
the delay. However Lyman does not
feel that there is much that he can do
other than "prod" a little.
"I can't order the faculty to work
faster," states Lyman, "but I do have
some difficulty with seeing why it is so

terribly difficult for the committee to
get the job done."
Marshall says his committee
interviewed every available member of
the SWOPSI Board, the SWOPSI
director, and Shockley last fall. But,
he says, "We have not yet reached any
final agreement."
Reasons For Rejection
The reasons given by SWOPSI for
rejecting Shockley's proposal for a
workshop on his dysgenic theories
were:
—that Shockley was not qualified
to teach such a course;
—that the course would not be
suitable for undergraduates;
—that discussion of his theories
would add more to the problem than
to the solution;

—that the workshop might be
susceptible to classroom disruptions
such as those that occured in
Shockley's engineering classes last
year.
SWOPSI Director Dan Lewis has
said he feels confident that the Ad
Hoc Committee will uphold the
decision of the SWOPSI Policy Board.
The Policy Board voted last May on
the issue, and Shockley failed by one
vote to get the necessary two-thirds
approval of the Board.
Permission Denied
Shockley previously had been
denied permission to teach a
non-credit graduate special course on
the subject. That request was turned
down by Dean of Graduate Studies
Lincoln Moses on April 25th of last
year.
The other four members of the Ad
Hoc Committee are Aerophysics Prof.
Daniel Bershader; Pharmacology Dept.
Chairman Ron Schimke; law student
Joan Gottwall; and sophomore James
Dunlop, a member of the C-US.
