# Provost Heads Search Panel For New Humanities Dean
## 
### 
Provost William F. Miller has
been named head of the search
committee for a new dean of the
School of Humanities and
Sciences at Stanford by University
President Richard W. Lyman.
Dean Albert H. Hastorf, who
has headed the School since 1970,
asked in January to be relieved of
his administrative post to return
to teaching and research in
psychology at the end of the
current academic year.
In a letter to Miller, Lyman
asked the search committee to
submit a short list of candidates,
including at least one from within
the University and at least one
from outside, together with the
strengths and weaknesses of each
person.
Members of the search
committee, besides Miler, will
include Frances Armstrong,

graduate student in law; Jay
Gellert, sophomore in urban
studies; Kennell Jackson, assistant
professor of history; Walter
Meyerhof, professor of physics;
Diane Middlebrook, assistant
professor of English; Patrick
Suppes, professor of philosophy,
statistics, education, and, by
courtesy, psychology; and
Norman Wessells, professor of
biological sciences.
