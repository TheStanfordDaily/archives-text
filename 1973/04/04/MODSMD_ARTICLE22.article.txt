# Audience Interrupts Neil Young
## 
### JAY HARLOW 
Two weeks ago, on Tuesday
night, March 20, Neil Young and
Linda Ronstadt opened a
three-night run at Winterland.
Their show was yet another in
that continuing series at
Winterland, "How to (Almost)
Ruin a Good Concert."
Linda Ronstadt started with a
good but short set, only about
forty minutes. She has a very
pleasant voice, with just enough
of the type of tone and phrasings
that tell you she's a country
singer, but without overdoing it as
so many female country/western
singers do.
On some numbers she had two
other singers backing her up,
providing very smooth,
easy-flowing harmonies. I
generally won't go out of my way
to hear female country/western
singers, but Linda Ronstadt is an
exception.
During the break, I was once
again amazed at how loud people
can yell trying to find their
friends in the balcony on the
opposite side of the hall. Their
shouts alternated with the usual
halftime show of cartoons,
glow-in-the-dark frisbees,
announcements, and so on.
Neil Young came on stage
alone, and sat down to do his
acoustic set. He began with
"Sugar Mountain," explaining
along the way what some of the
verses were about, playing
harmonica between verses, and
asking the audience to sing along
on the choruses. As soon as he
started, everyone on the floor got
jp and moved forward, packing
.he front of the house shoulder to
ihoulder.
Partway into the next song,
'Tell Me Why," Young stopped
tnd asked everybody to sit down
md generally quiet down so he
rould get into the right mood for
he music.
No Room
There was simply no room at
he front, so everyone had to
nove back and shuffle around in
trder to make room. This went on
hrough the rest of the song, and
pparently was too much for
foung, because he cut short his
coustic set and brought out the
est of the band.
Unfortunately, he demands a
ertain mood in order to play his
uieter songs, rather than creating
he appropriate mood with his
lusic. Of course, he had the
dded disadvantage of the
/interland regulars, who seem to
e satisfied only with music that
lows them out of their seats.
laybe what they need is Grand
unk Railroad every night.
With the Stray Gators, the
hnd that backed him up on his
Ibum "Harvest," Young started
iit with two songs from that

album, "Old Man" and "Heart of
Gold." Both suffer slightly in live
performance without the
overdubbed vocal harmonies and
banjo, but are still good tunes.
New Songs
Next were some new songs,
"Time Fades Away," "L.A.," and

"Look Out, Joe, You're Coming
Home," about a returning
Vietnam veteran. He was plagued
by tuning problems with one of
his guitars; apparently (he was
mumbling, but I think this is what
he said) someone threw a beer
bottle up on stage and hit one of

his two electrics. (See above for
comments on Winterland
audiences.)
As he got his tuning hassles
worked out, Young introduced
"two friends of mine, Graham
Nash and David Crosby." With
Nash on acoustic guitar and
Crosby on electric six and
twelve-string, they began
"Alabama," did a new tune, "New
Ma," and a long song called "Last
Dance." Their three-part
harmonies were, as usual,
excellent.
Next was an old rock and roll
tune, "Bible Rock," followed by
"Are You Ready for the

Country" and "Southern Man."
The only thing missing from the
last number was Stephen Stills'
lead guitar, as recorded live on the
CSN&Y album "Four Way
Street." They ended the set with
one of Young's older songs,
"Cinnamon Girl," and as an
encore, repeated the last half of
"Last Dance."
The problem with going to see
a big name like Neil Young at
Winterland is that I go expecting a
great concert, but a number of
factors, including the audience,
can turn what promised to be a
great show into merely a good
show with some serious faults.
