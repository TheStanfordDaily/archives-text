# Baseball Action Resumes Today
## 
### MARK WHITE 
After posting a 6-3 record
during spring break, Stanford's
baseball team resumes play this
afternoon against the University
of San Francisco at 2:30* in
Sunken Diamond. The contest
with the Dons is the last game for
the Cards before Pac-8 play begins
this weekend when Stanford
travels to Los Angeles for a three
game series with UCLA. .
With only four days of outdoor
practice in the five weeks
before vacation due to bad
weather, the Cards travelled to
Southern California for a
double-header with Cal State
preceeding the
Riverside National Baseball
Tournament from March 26 to
March 31.
Stanford warmed up for the
seven game tournament at
Riverside by beating Cal State
Northridge in a double header on
Saturday March 24. Freshman
shortstop Steve Davis sparked the
Cards to the 5-2 and 6-5 victories
with six straight hits, including
two doubles.
With the exception of one
game, it seemed that the Card
pitching was a good barometer of
Stanford's fate at the Riverside
tournament.
Although the team batted a
fine .294 for the seven games at
Riverside, Stanford did not pack
the firepower of USC or Arizona
State and had to settle for many
singles. As a result, the Cards
could score more than six runs
only once during the tournament,
and while this was usually enough
to win when the Card pitchers
were 'effective, it meant the
Stanford team was at a
disadvantage if the pitching broke
down during a game against a
hefty long-ball hitting team.
Stanford's finest offensive
performance came against
Washington State in the first
tournament contest. With four
players collecting three hits
apiece, Stanford racked up 19 hits
in pulverizing the Cougars 14-0.
Brad Mcintosh, the Cougar
pitcher, had a no-hitter to his
credit earlier in the year, but the
Cards feasted on his fastball,
scoring nine times before
Mcintosh withdrew in the sixth
inning.
In stark contrast, Bob Di Pietro
pitched a one-hitter in shutting
out Washington State. Mike
Nelson and Mark Lucich both

homered for the Cards.
Massachusetts surprised
Stanford in the second game of
the tournament with home runs
that accounted for seven runs in
the first two innings. Pitcher Shaw
gave up a three-run shot in the
first inning and a grand-slam in
the second before giving way to
reliever Nick Peterson, who
pitched shutout ball for seven
innings. Although catcher Bob
Reece's three run triple sparked a
valiant Stanford rally, the Cards
fell short, 7-6.
Al Arthur pitched a strong
seven innings and Dave Frost
relieved well for the final frames
as Stanford eked out a 4-3 victory
over host UC Riverside
Wednesday. Joy over that victory
was short-lived, however, as
Arizona State clobbered the Cards
later that day, 18-2. A close, 3-2
game up to the seventh inning
turned into a rout when the Sun
Devils bombed Max Goldstein and
Ken Grolle for 15 runs in the last
two innings.
With the loss to Arizona State,
Stanford trailed USC in its
bracket of the tournament and
the Cards were faced with the
prospect of either winning their
remaining games or failing to
make it to the championship
game.
Mike Higgins and a restored
Shaw kept Stanford's hopes alive
with consecutive shutouts over
Hawaii and Vanderbilt. Davis led
the 5-0 blitz on Hawaii with three
RBl's and three hits, while Bruce
Robinson's two run triple sparked
the Cardinal's 6-0 win over
Vanderbilt.
Those two victories set up the
showdown contest with USC on
Saturday, the winner meeting
Arizona State for the
championship.
A tight, defensive game,
Stanford trailed 2-1 going into the
bottom of the ninth inning.
Pinch-hitter Bob Hampton walked
with one out and then came home
on an error to send the game into
extra innings. The Trojans quickly
ended the game and snuffed any
Stanford hopes of a championship
when USC scored six runs in the
top of the tenth.
USC went on to defeat Arizona
State in the championship, 2-0
and the Trojans placed three men
on the all-tournament team. Davis
was Stanford's lone representative
on the all-star squad.

HOCKEY SEASON ENDS — There was plenty of action last night at Belmont Iceland, but San Francisco

playoff series between the two teams. On Monday night San Francisco routed Stanford 13-3. The Cards,
who placed fourth in the Bay Area Hockey League during the regular season, ended their campaign with a
7-11 record.
