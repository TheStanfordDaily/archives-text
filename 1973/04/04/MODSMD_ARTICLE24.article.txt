# Swimmers Finish Sixth In NCAA Meet
## 
### MIKE CHASSON 
The swimming team, despite a
slow pool and a partisan crowd,
swam well in finishing sixth in the
NCAA swimming and diving
championships, March 22-24 at
the University of Tennessee in
Knoxville.
Indiana easily won its sixth
straight title, while Tennessee,
swimming in its own pool, upset
Southern California for second.
UCLA finished fourth and
Washington fifth as the
Pacific-Eight conference
dominated the meet except for
the Hoosier's winning
performance.
Freshman John Hencken paced
the Cardinals by swimming a leg
on the fifth place 400 medley
relay, winning the 100 breastroke,
and placing third in the 200
breastroke.
Hencken recorded an amazing
55.64 breastroke leg in the
preliminaries of the medley relay.
In winning the 100 the next day
he swam a 57.11, and notched a
lifetime best of 2.03.58 in the 200

yard event.
Senior Brian Job, swimming in
what may have been his last meet,
failed to win an individual title for
the first time in his collegiate
career. Job swam the butterfly on
the medley relay, placed fifth in
the 100 breastroke in 57.79, and
finished second in the 200
breastroke in 2.03.52. Job,
however, still holds the American
and NCAA records in both
breastroke events.
Anderson Outstanding
Sprinter Dean Anderson had
what coach Jim Gaughran termed
"possibly the most outstanding
swims of the meet" for the
Cardinals. Anderson, who
disappointed in not qualifying for
the 50 freestyle final, swam a
blistering 44.65 in his 100
freestyle leg of the medley relay.
Anderson continued to swim
well on the second day as he
recorded a 1.42.90 leadoff leg on
the ninth place 800 freestyle
relay. On the final day he placed
third in the 100 freestyle in a
lifetime best of 45.88 and
anchored the second place 400
freestyle relay in 44.63.
Sophomore Randy Whitchurch

missed making the finals in the
100 backstroke, even with a
lifetime best of 52.69. Whitchurch
later lowered that time to 52.47
in leading off the medley relay.
Whitchurch scored on the final
day, however, getting a sixth in
the 200 backstroke with a
1.54.45. His time in the
preliminaries of 1.54.24 set a new
Stanford record, breaking the
mark he set last year.
Goodwin Scores
Freshman Bruce Goodwin
scored in the 50 freestyle with a
12th place time of 21.54.
Goodwin recorded a 21.20 in the
preliminaries to qualify for the
finals. He also led off the freestyle
relay in the preliminaries with a
46.32 and had a 46.66 in the
finals.
Fellow freshman Richard Cook
also had a hand in the scoring
with a 1.42.03 leg on the 800
relay and a 46.51 leg on the 400
free relay, while junior Martin
Pedley recorded a fast 45.61 on
the 400 free relay.
The 400 free relay team of
Goodwin, Cook, Pedley, and
Anderson set a new Stanford
record of 3.30.1, breaking the old

mark of 3.04.24 set in 1969.
Best Times
As a team Stanford swam very
well with almost everyone
swimming at least one best time.
The distance swimmers did well
with Steve Strong swimming a
lifetime best 4.37.75 in the 500
freestyle and Terry Sutton setting
a Stanford record in the 1650
with a 16.12.66.
Paul Clark improved three
seconds in the 400 IM to 4.14.93,
and Ron Longinotti recorded
bests of 4.44.45 in the 500 and a
1.43.64 for the 200 as a member
of the 800 freestyle relay.
Both Gaughran and sprint
coach Jeff Hammett were pleased
with the swims, but are already
formulating new plans for next
year's training. Even with a pool
that was rated slow due to its
shallow water, the times recorded
by swimmers across the country
were faster than ever.
Times recorded by some
Stanford swimmers this year may
have scored in last year's NCAA
meet but were too slow this year.
Both Gaughran and Hammett
expect to make changes that will
keep Stanford competitive with
the rest of the country.

in leading off the medley relay.
Whitchurch scored on the final
day, however, getting a sixth in
the 200 backstroke with a
1.54.45. His time in the
preliminaries of 1.54.24 set a new
Stanford record, breaking the
mark he set last year.
Goodwin Scores
Freshman Bruce Goodwin
scored in the 50 freestyle with a
12th place time of 21.54.
Goodwin recorded a 21.20 in the
preliminaries to qualify for the
finals. He also led off the freestyle
relay in the preliminaries with a
46.32 and had a 46.66 in the
finals.
Fellow freshman Richard Cook
also had a hand in the scoring
with a 1.42.03 leg on the 800
relay and a 46.51 leg on the 400
free relay, while junior Martin
Pedley recorded a fast 45.61 on
the 400 free relay.
The 400 free relay team of
Goodwin, Cook, Pedley, and
Anderson set a new Stanford
record of 3.30.1, breaking the old

mark of 3.04.24 set in 1969.
Best Times
As a team Stanford swam very
well with almost everyone
swimming at least one best time.
The distance swimmers did well
with Steve Strong swimming a
lifetime best 4.37.75 in the 500
freestyle and Terry Sutton setting
a Stanford record in the 1650
with a 16.12.66.
Paul Clark improved three
seconds in the 400 IM to 4.14.93,
and Ron Longinotti recorded
bests of 4.44.45 in the 500 and a
1.43.64 for the 200 as a member
of the 800 freestyle relay.
Both Gaughran and sprint
coach Jeff Hammett were pleased
with the swims, but are already
formulating new plans for next
year's training. Even with a pool
that was rated slow due to its
shallow water, the times recorded
by swimmers across the country
were faster than ever.
Times recorded by some
Stanford swimmers this year may
have scored in last year's NCAA
meet but were too slow this year.
Both Gaughran and Hammett
expect to make changes that will
keep Stanford competitive with
the rest of the country.
The swimming team, despite a
slow pool and a partisan crowd,
swam well in finishing sixth in the
NCAA swimming and diving
championships, March 22-24 at
the University of Tennessee in
Knoxville.
Indiana easily won its sixth
straight title, while Tennessee,
swimming in its own pool, upset
Southern California for second.
UCLA finished fourth and
Washington fifth as the
Pacific-Eight conference
dominated the meet except for
the Hoosier's winning
performance.
Freshman John Hencken paced
the Cardinals by swimming a leg
on the fifth place 400 medley
relay, winning the 100 breastroke,
and placing third in the 200
breastroke.
Hencken recorded an amazing
55.64 breastroke leg in the
preliminaries of the medley relay.
In winning the 100 the next day
he swam a 57.11, and notched a
lifetime best of 2.03.58 in the 200

yard event.
Senior Brian Job, swimming in
what may have been his last meet,
failed to win an individual title for
the first time in his collegiate
career. Job swam the butterfly on
the medley relay, placed fifth in
the 100 breastroke in 57.79, and
finished second in the 200
breastroke in 2.03.52. Job,
however, still holds the American
and NCAA records in both
breastroke events.
Anderson Outstanding
Sprinter Dean Anderson had
what coach Jim Gaughran termed
"possibly the most outstanding
swims of the meet" for the
Cardinals. Anderson, who
disappointed in not qualifying for
the 50 freestyle final, swam a
blistering 44.65 in his 100
freestyle leg of the medley relay.
Anderson continued to swim
well on the second day as he
recorded a 1.42.90 leadoff leg on
the ninth place 800 freestyle
relay. On the final day he placed
third in the 100 freestyle in a
lifetime best of 45.88 and
anchored the second place 400
freestyle relay in 44.63.

meet but were too slow this year.
Both Gaughran and Hammett
expect to make changes that will
keep Stanford competitive with
the rest of the country.
The swimming team, despite a
slow pool and a partisan crowd,
swam well in finishing sixth in the
NCAA swimming and diving
championships, March 22-24 at
the University of Tennessee in
Knoxville.
Indiana easily won its sixth
straight title, while Tennessee,
swimming in its own pool, upset
Southern California for second.
UCLA finished fourth and
Washington fifth as the
Pacific-Eight conference
dominated the meet except for
the Hoosier's winning
performance.
Freshman John Hencken paced
the Cardinals by swimming a leg
on the fifth place 400 medley
relay, winning the 100 breastroke,
and placing third in the 200
breastroke.
Hencken recorded an amazing
55.64 breastroke leg in the
preliminaries of the medley relay.
In winning the 100 the next day
he swam a 57.11, and notched a
lifetime best of 2.03.58 in the 200

yard event.
Senior Brian Job, swimming in
what may have been his last meet,
failed to win an individual title for
the first time in his collegiate
career. Job swam the butterfly on
the medley relay, placed fifth in
the 100 breastroke in 57.79, and
finished second in the 200
breastroke in 2.03.52. Job,
however, still holds the American
and NCAA records in both
breastroke events.
Anderson Outstanding
Sprinter Dean Anderson had
what coach Jim Gaughran termed
"possibly the most outstanding
swims of the meet" for the
Cardinals. Anderson, who
disappointed in not qualifying for
the 50 freestyle final, swam a
blistering 44.65 in his 100
freestyle leg of the medley relay.
Anderson continued to swim
well on the second day as he
recorded a 1.42.90 leadoff leg on
the ninth place 800 freestyle
relay. On the final day he placed
third in the 100 freestyle in a
lifetime best of 45.88 and
anchored the second place 400
freestyle relay in 44.63.
Sophomore Randy Whitchurch

missed making the finals in the
100 backstroke, even with a
lifetime best of 52.69. Whitchurch
later lowered that time to 52.47
in leading off the medley relay.
Whitchurch scored on the final
day, however, getting a sixth in
the 200 backstroke with a
1.54.45. His time in the
preliminaries of 1.54.24 set a new
Stanford record, breaking the
mark he set last year.
Goodwin Scores
Freshman Bruce Goodwin
scored in the 50 freestyle with a
12th place time of 21.54.
Goodwin recorded a 21.20 in the
preliminaries to qualify for the
finals. He also led off the freestyle
relay in the preliminaries with a
46.32 and had a 46.66 in the
finals.
Fellow freshman Richard Cook
also had a hand in the scoring
with a 1.42.03 leg on the 800
relay and a 46.51 leg on the 400
free relay, while junior Martin
Pedley recorded a fast 45.61 on
the 400 free relay.
The 400 free relay team of
Goodwin, Cook, Pedley, and
Anderson set a new Stanford
record of 3.30.1, breaking the old

mark of 3.04.24 set in 1969.
Best Times
As a team Stanford swam very
well with almost everyone
swimming at least one best time.
The distance swimmers did well
with Steve Strong swimming a
lifetime best 4.37.75 in the 500
freestyle and Terry Sutton setting
a Stanford record in the 1650
with a 16.12.66.
Paul Clark improved three
seconds in the 400 IM to 4.14.93,
and Ron Longinotti recorded
bests of 4.44.45 in the 500 and a
1.43.64 for the 200 as a member
of the 800 freestyle relay.
Both Gaughran and sprint
coach Jeff Hammett were pleased
with the swims, but are already
formulating new plans for next
year's training. Even with a pool
that was rated slow due to its
shallow water, the times recorded
by swimmers across the country
were faster than ever.
Times recorded by some
Stanford swimmers this year may
have scored in last year's NCAA
meet but were too slow this year.
Both Gaughran and Hammett
expect to make changes that will
keep Stanford competitive with
the rest of the country.
