# Spikers Impressive Over Spring Break
## 
### PHIL HUBBARD 
While most of Stanford was
recovering from finals, the track
squad travelled south for the
Santa Barbara Relays on March
24, and hosted Occidental in a
dual meet here last Saturday. The
Cards took third at Santa Barbara
behind Arizona and USC, and
handily defeated Occidental on
the 31st, 100-54 for their second
dual win of the season against one
loss.
At Santa Barbara, Terry
Albritton dominated the shot
with a winning put of 57'814".
Stanford's only other first place
came in the distance medley relay.
Highlighted by Les McFadden's
2:59.4 in his 1320 leg, the team
of Kenny Kring, Bruce Wolfe,
Brian Mittelstaedt, and McFadden
covered the 2 x h miles in 9:55.8.
The discus was easily the Cards
strongest event of the meet. Jim
Howard took second with a
172'7" toss and teammates Pete
Dreissigacker and Jim Royer were
third and fourth respectively.
Tom Anderson was second in
the long jump with a leap.
The two mile relay team of
McFadden, Mittelstaedt, Wolfe,

and Vernell Jackson was also
second in 7:51.6.
The day after the Santa
Barbara meet, Mittelstaedt
competed in the invitational Meet
of Champions at UCLA, where he
took first in the 880 with a
lifetime best of 1:52.9.
Most of the squad stayed in the
area last week to prepare for the
contest against Occidental. In the
17 previous encounters between
the two teams, Occidental had
won 10 and Stanford seven. Oxy
came into the meet with a 5-1
dual meet record.
The Cards took first in all but
two of the field events. Terry
Albritton continued his string of
shot victories with a 59'9" meet
record leading a sweep in that
event. Tom Anderson won both
the high jump (6'4") and long
jump (23'10-3/4").
Rod Utley led a Stanford
sweep in the triple jump with a
49'3" leap, just four inches short
of a meet record. Howard led
another sweep in the discus with a
164'9" toss.
Kurt Schoenrock led off the
running events with a meet record
in the steeplechase, equalling is
lifetime best with a 9:21.2
clocking.
Dave Bagshaw took the high
hurdles with a 14.9 clocking, not
a bad time considering he was
running into an 8.3 mph
headwind. Ken Curl, also against a
strong wind, was the winner of
the 100 in 9.9.
Co-captain John Anderson
took the 440 with a 48.9. Vernell
Jackson held on in the 880 to win
there in 1:54.4. Ken Curl picked
up his second sprint victory of the
day as he dominated the 220 with
a 21.8 clocking.
Mark McConnell just nosed out
Oxy's Joel Jameson as both ran
lifetime bests of 9:03.6 in the two
mile. Stanford's mile relay team
rounded off the Cards' score at an
even 100 as they took the final
event in a season's best of 3:16.4.
This weekend the Cards will
compete in a double dual meet at
Los Angeles. Stanford will go
against UCLA while California
simultaneously competes against
USC.
