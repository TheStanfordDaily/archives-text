# Mayer, Delaney Lead Lineup
## Challenge Matches Set Tennis Ladder 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
Members of the Stanford
tennis team stayed here during
spring vacation to play ladder
matches and tune up for this
weekend's big matches against
USC and UCLA.
"Everyone looked pretty
good," Coach Dick Gould said. "I
was especially impressed that
everyone competed very well
against each other but that the
losers didn't get discouraged, as
sometimes happens."
Thus, as a result of matches
played here and at Pebble Beach
during the past week, Gould has
selected the eight players who will
make the trip to Los Angeles.
Playing first singles, as
expected, will be junior Alex
"Sandy" Mayer. Both he and
junior Jim Delaney currently hold
4-0 records for the season, neither

having competed for Stanford
since the National Indoor
Championships in Madison, Wise.,
in early February.
Senior Southpaws
Rick Fisher will play third
singles, with Gery Groslimond at
fourth singles after playing well
during the challenge matches.
Both players are senior southpaws
with 4-2 records going into this
weekend's action.
Freshman John Whitlinger,
with the best record on the team
(7-0) edged out fellow freshman
Pat DuPre for the firth singles
spot. DuPre, 5-1 on the year, will
pay the sixth and final singles
position for the time being.
Also making the trip will be
sophomore Chip Fisher (3-1),
seventh on the ladder, and junior
Paul Sidone (4-0). Sidone
yesterday toppe'd freshman Mark

Mitchell (3-0) for the eighth and
final spot on the travelling squad.
Hagey Recovering
The tenth player is sophomore
ail-American Chicao Hagey.
"Chico played very well in his
first matches last week since his
injury," Gould said. Hagey, who
was in the top four last year, is
slowly recovering from a broken
ankle sustained last year.
The doubles teams for
Stanford will probably be the
same as they were during the
Madison tournament. Groslimond

and Rick Fisher (10-2) will be at
first doubles, with Mayer and
Whitlinger (2-1) at the second
slot. The most likely third doubles
entry is Chip Fisher and Delaney,
with a 9-2 record.
In a varsity match for which
Gould used only junior varsity
players yesterday, Stanford edged
UC Santa Barbara 5-4. The win
increased Stanford's dual meet
record to 8-0, counting all those
meets officially classified as
varsity.

CHALLENGE MATCH VICTIM — Sophomore Chip Fisher was
defeated by freshman teammate Pat Dupre yesterday in a match for
the sixth spot in Stanford's varsity lineup. Dupre will play singles in
this weekend's matches against USC and UCLA in Los Angeles, but
Fisher will probably team with Jim Delaney at third doubles.
