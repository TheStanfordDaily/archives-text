# Cards Upset Golf Powers At Santa Barbara Tourney
## 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
Stanford's golf team was ignored in the preseason
national rankings, but last week the Cards served
notice to the nation's golf powers that Stanford
intends to challenge for the NCAA title.
Coach Bud Finger's golfers scored an impressive
victory in the Pacific Coast Invitational tournament
at Santa Barbara, defeating nationally ranked USC
and Arizona State teams en route to their first
outright tournament victory of the season. (The
Cards earlier tied San Jose State for first in the Cal
State Hayward tourney.)
Stanford won with a 911 team total, USC was
second with 914, Long Beach State third at 918,
and Arizona State fourth with 920. Fourteen other
teams competed in the tourney.
"This proves that we're in the same class as the
high ranking teams," Finger said after his Cardinals
upset the fifth ranked Sun Devils and eighth ranked
Trojans. "This is the first year in a while that we've
really had a crack at the nationls."
Robertson Out
Unfortunately, Finger had to amend that last
statement after the United States Golf Association
ruled Monday that sophomore Bruce Robertson was
no longer an amateur because of a rule violation
involving the sale of golf equipment. Robertson was
to have competed in the Masters tournament
beginning tomorrow in Augusta, Ga., but he
withdrew from the prestigious event just prior to
the USGA announcement.
"Whether we can take up the slack without
Bruce I don't know," Finger said after athletic
director Joseph Ruetz expressed doubts as to
whether Robertson will be able to compete for the
Cards again, even though the NCAA still considers
Robertson an amateur.
Without Robertson, however, Stanford still
would have won at Santa Barbara since only the top
four scores from each six man team counted toward
the team totals. Counting Robertson's score,
Stanford won by three shots. Without his score, the
Cards still had a two shot edge. Ruetz offered to
forfeit the team championship, but it is unlikely
that the Cards will lose the title.
First In Three Years
Stanford's performance at Santa Barbara
represented the first time in three years that the
Cards have defeated USC in a medal play

tournament. Last year the Cards beat the Trojans in
a dual match, but USC triumphed in the more
important Pacific Eight tournament.
According to USC publicity, this year's Trojans
squad is its best in 15 years. And after 36 holes at
Santa Barbara, no one was arguing that point. USC
held a nine stroke lead over second place Stanford
and Trojan sophomore Craig Stadler had virtually
clinched the individual title.
Friday, however, was all Stanford. Cardinal
players were only three over par as a team on the
windswept Sandpiper course, as Aly Trompas fired a
two under par 70, Robertson and Dave Baskins each
shot 73, and Denny Colvin added a 75.
Meanwhile only Stadler broke 75 for USC, and
the Cards picked up 12 shots on the Trojans for a
three stroke victory. Stadler won the individual
crown on rounds of 71-74-72 for a one over par 217
total. Trompas finished second at 224, while
Baskins, Colvin, and Robertson tied for seventh at
229.
Bob Chapman was next for the Cards at 230, and
Conrad Nilmeier shot 240.
Trompas Coming Back
It was the second straight runnerup finish for
Trompas, who is making a strong comeback after a
disappointing freshman year. (He also finished
second in the Cal State Hayward tournament three
weeks ago.)
"It looks like he's got things going his way
again," Finger said of the former national junior
champion.
And Trompas said he was playing with
considerable confidence after breaking out of a 14
month slump. "I was just swinging bad," he said,
"but now I've got my swing straightened out and
I've been able to work on other things like my short
game."
Trompas will be Stanford's key performer when
the Cards open a busy weekend at the University of
Pacific Golf Championship in Stockton on Friday.
Saturday Stanford will host California in a dual
match and Monday the Cards will travel to San Jose
to meet Jerry Vroom's talented Spartans.
Trompas, Baskins, Colvin, Chapman, and
Nilmeier will compete in those events, along with
long-hitting sophomore George Pettinger, who
replaces Robertson in the varsity lineup.

seems to be fully recovered from a 14 month slump which plagued him throughout a disappointing
freshman season. Stanford won the team title at Santa Barbara, edging USC by three strokes.

THE TROMP IS BACK—Sophomore Aly Trompas finished second last week in a strong individual field at
the Pacific Coast Invitational Tournament in Santa Barbara. Trompas, the 1969 U.S. Junior champion,
seems to be fully recovered from a 14 month slump which plagued him throughout a disappointing
freshman season. Stanford won the team title at Santa Barbara, edging USC by three strokes.
Stanford's golf team was ignored in the preseason
national rankings, but last week the Cards served
notice to the nation's golf powers that Stanford
intends to challenge for the NCAA title.
Coach Bud Finger's golfers scored an impressive
victory in the Pacific Coast Invitational tournament
at Santa Barbara, defeating nationally ranked USC
and Arizona State teams en route to their first
outright tournament victory of the season. (The
Cards earlier tied San Jose State for first in the Cal
State Hayward tourney.)
Stanford won with a 911 team total, USC was
second with 914, Long Beach State third at 918,
and Arizona State fourth with 920. Fourteen other
teams competed in the tourney.
"This proves that we're in the same class as the
high ranking teams," Finger said after his Cardinals
upset the fifth ranked Sun Devils and eighth ranked
Trojans. "This is the first year in a while that we've
really had a crack at the nationls."
Robertson Out
Unfortunately, Finger had to amend that last
statement after the United States Golf Association
ruled Monday that sophomore Bruce Robertson was
no longer an amateur because of a rule violation
involving the sale of golf equipment. Robertson was
to have competed in the Masters tournament
beginning tomorrow in Augusta, Ga., but he
withdrew from the prestigious event just prior to
the USGA announcement.
"Whether we can take up the slack without
Bruce I don't know," Finger said after athletic
director Joseph Ruetz expressed doubts as to
whether Robertson will be able to compete for the
Cards again, even though the NCAA still considers
Robertson an amateur.
Without Robertson, however, Stanford still
would have won at Santa Barbara since only the top
four scores from each six man team counted toward
the team totals. Counting Robertson's score,
Stanford won by three shots. Without his score, the
Cards still had a two shot edge. Ruetz offered to
forfeit the team championship, but it is unlikely
that the Cards will lose the title.
First In Three Years
Stanford's performance at Santa Barbara
represented the first time in three years that the
Cards have defeated USC in a medal play

tournament. Last year the Cards beat the Trojans in
a dual match, but USC triumphed in the more
important Pacific Eight tournament.
According to USC publicity, this year's Trojans
squad is its best in 15 years. And after 36 holes at
Santa Barbara, no one was arguing that point. USC
held a nine stroke lead over second place Stanford
and Trojan sophomore Craig Stadler had virtually
clinched the individual title.
Friday, however, was all Stanford. Cardinal
players were only three over par as a team on the
windswept Sandpiper course, as Aly Trompas fired a
two under par 70, Robertson and Dave Baskins each
shot 73, and Denny Colvin added a 75.
Meanwhile only Stadler broke 75 for USC, and
the Cards picked up 12 shots on the Trojans for a
three stroke victory. Stadler won the individual
crown on rounds of 71-74-72 for a one over par 217
total. Trompas finished second at 224, while
Baskins, Colvin, and Robertson tied for seventh at
229.
Bob Chapman was next for the Cards at 230, and
Conrad Nilmeier shot 240.
Trompas Coming Back
It was the second straight runnerup finish for
Trompas, who is making a strong comeback after a
disappointing freshman year. (He also finished
second in the Cal State Hayward tournament three
weeks ago.)
"It looks like he's got things going his way
again," Finger said of the former national junior
champion.
And Trompas said he was playing with
considerable confidence after breaking out of a 14
month slump. "I was just swinging bad," he said,
"but now I've got my swing straightened out and
I've been able to work on other things like my short
game."
Trompas will be Stanford's key performer when
the Cards open a busy weekend at the University of
Pacific Golf Championship in Stockton on Friday.
Saturday Stanford will host California in a dual
match and Monday the Cards will travel to San Jose
to meet Jerry Vroom's talented Spartans.
Trompas, Baskins, Colvin, Chapman, and
Nilmeier will compete in those events, along with
long-hitting sophomore George Pettinger, who

considerable confidence after breaking out of a 14
month slump. "I was just swinging bad," he said,
"but now I've got my swing straightened out and
I've been able to work on other things like my short
game."
Trompas will be Stanford's key performer when
the Cards open a busy weekend at the University of
Pacific Golf Championship in Stockton on Friday.
Saturday Stanford will host California in a dual
match and Monday the Cards will travel to San Jose
to meet Jerry Vroom's talented Spartans.
Trompas, Baskins, Colvin, Chapman, and
Nilmeier will compete in those events, along with
long-hitting sophomore George Pettinger, who
replaces Robertson in the varsity lineup.

THE TROMP IS BACK—Sophomore Aly Trompas finished second last week in a strong individual field at
the Pacific Coast Invitational Tournament in Santa Barbara. Trompas, the 1969 U.S. Junior champion,
seems to be fully recovered from a 14 month slump which plagued him throughout a disappointing
freshman season. Stanford won the team title at Santa Barbara, edging USC by three strokes.
