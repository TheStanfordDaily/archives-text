# Chino Jury Selection Continues
## 
### 
Jury selection in the murder trial of
Andrea Holman Burt and Benton
Douglas Burt began yesterday in San
Bernardino County Superior Court
and will continue today.
As yet, none of the prospective
jurors has been named to the panel.
The trial is expected to last 60-90
days, and jury candidates who cannot
serve for the entire period have been
excused.
Of the three prospective jurors
whose names were drawn in court
yesterday, two were questioned and
excused for cause, and a third will be
questioned this morning.
Despite a recent Supreme Court
ruling permitting questioning of jurors
by the trial judge only, Superior Court
Judge Thomas Haldorsen is permitting
some questioning by the attorneys for
the prosecution and defense in the
case.

The Chino Defense Committee has
claimed that sufficient information to
conduct jury selection research has not
been made available to the defense.
But no snags in the selection process
were apparent yesterday, the court
clerk said.
The Burts are charged with murder
and lynching (freeing a prisoner) in the
Oct. 6, 1972, escape of Ronald Wayne
Beaty from the California Institution
for Men in Chino. One prison guard
was killed and another wounded when
a car carrying Beaty and the guards
was ambushed near the prison.
Pre-trial motions have delayed jury
selection for the past several months.
Andrea Burt is the daughter of
Medicine Prof. Halsted L. Holman.
Yesterday morning Haldorsen
granted a defense motion allowing
Benton Douglas Burt to appear in
court without leg-irons during jury

selection. Burt was required to wear
the leg-irons in the courtroom because
he is classified as a "high security
risk," the court clerk explained.
