# Pac-8 Football Letters Of Intent
## Chris Lands Promising Recruits 
### MIKE CHASSON 
With a total of 26 lettermen
missing from last year's squad,
football coach Jack Christiansen
has many places to fill.
Unlike last year, Christiansen
will be able to use freshmen as
well as junior college transfers and
returning players to fill the holes
left by graduation.
Heading the list of freshmen
recruits who have signed Pac-8
letters of intent are two
quarterbacks, Mike Cordova from
Seattle Prep in Washington and

Rudy Garcia from Wilson High in
Los Angeles.
Cordova, who is 6-3'/2 and 215,
was Parade magazine's first team
high school All-American
quarterback. About 30 schools
were after Cordova, who was also
an All-State linebacker.
"I chose Stanford because they
will permit me to play
quarterback as long as I want.
Many of the other schools wanted
me as a linebacker," stated the
future freshman who announced
he was coming here in late

February.
Garcia, who is 6-3 and 185,
was City Player of the Year in Los
Angeles and was a quarterback on
this year's South Shrine team.
Offensive Linemen
A big weakness last season was
the offensive line which permitted
Boryla to be sacked for 295 yards.
Only three starters return from
last year's line, but the coaching
staff has recruited three top junior
college prospects to help protect
Boryla.
Rudy Bergthold, a 6-3, 237
pound transfer from Reedley
College, where he was an
All-Conference center the last two
years, heads the list.
The coaches believe he could
battle Bill Reid for the center job,
or could move over to guard
where Young Klippert, Lee Fair,
and Chuck Cordes have all
graduated.
Van Day, a 6-4 230 pound
guard from Pasadena City College,
is expected to play either guard or
tackle. He played on teams in high
school and college that have
compiled a 28-3 record.
Expected to battle for a
starting tackle spot is Rob Olson,
who is 6-3V2 and 240, from San
Jose City College. He was one of
the most sought after JC linemen
in the country, and the coaches

say he really comes off the ball"
on the snap. He was a JC
Ail-American and "Lineman of
the Year" in the Golden Gate
Conference.
A top freshman prospect for
the offensive line is Ron Goss,
who is 6-5 and 220 from Grants
Pass High School in Oregon. Goss
earned All-State and All American
honors last season and
Christiansen believes he could be
the best player to come out of
Oregon this year.
Broke Washington's Records
To bolster a receiving corps
that lost the likes of Eric Cross,
Miles Moore, and Don Alvarado,
the staff has recruited Anthony
Hill, a 6-3, 185 pound receiver,
who broke all of Gene
Washington's records at Poly High
in Long Beach last season.
A top freshman running back
prospect is Andy Kolesnikow, 6-3
and 225, from Burlingame High
School. Assistant coach Dave
Currey states that, "he is the best
prospect on the peninsula in quite
a few years." He has also run a
14.4 in the high hurdles.
Overall the coaching staff was
quite pleased with the recruits
that have signed. Currey used the
phrase "exceptionally good
shape" when describing how
Stanford fared in the annual
recruiting wars.
