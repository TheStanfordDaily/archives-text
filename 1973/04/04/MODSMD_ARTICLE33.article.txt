# Lacrosse Team Seeks Third Win Against Cal
## 
### MARK WHITE 
Sporting a 2-1 record, the Stanford lacrosse team takes the first
step towards retrieval of the coveted Broken Stick trophy when the
Cards meet the University of California today at 3 p.m. on the rugby
field behind Maples Pavilion.
Card coach Pete Schneider feels his team is ready to bear down and
play its best ball with the arrival of a new quarter and sunnier
weather.
"Between midterms, the rain, and finals the team was under a lot
of stain last quarter and I think we have yet to play our best. We did
well considering the amount of work we could get in," Schneider said.
"I was pleased with our showing against the University of Washington
and I think that game was indicative of our strengths: aggressive
hitting, solid defense and an ability to come from behind."
Card attackman Buz Haddow led the way in that 9-7 win over
Washington on March 27 with four goals, a feat which earned him the
game ball. All-star attackman Butch Hazlett, who leads the team
scoring with six goals so far this season, missed the game, making
Haddow's performance all the more important.

"Having just come off finals,
the team was down at first against
Washington," Schneider pointed
out, "but I was pleased with the
way we bounced back after being
tied 3-3 late in the second quarter.
Hal Richardson came in and did a
good job at goal after Rob Owens
was injured in the first half."
Although the outstanding
strength of the team may be its
overall balance, Schneider thinks
the addition of the goalie tandem
of Richardson and Owens is the
big improvement over last year's
team.
"Richardson and Owens have
the experience at goal we lacked
last year and with the arrival of
Tom Earthman and Henry Miner
and the vast improvement of
Bruce Ogden at the defenseman
positions, I feel we have a very
strong defense.
"Against Cal we want to play a
physical game, take a lot of shots
and generally keep the pressure on
in their defensive zone. Although
this game doesn't count towards
league standings, it does count
towards the combined point totals
of our two contests with Cal
which will determine who wins
the Broken Stick award. And
since the Broken Stick was
originally a Stanford player's, we
would like to win it back."
