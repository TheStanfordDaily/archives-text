# Cards Place Third In Pac-8
## Gymnasts Set For NCAA's 
### PHIL HUBBARD 
The Stanford gymnastics team,
despite the absence of two of its
three top all-around men, fought
its way to an impressive third
place finish in the Pac-8
championships last weekend with
a 297.65 total. California was the
victor with 315.15, Washington
was second with 305.25, and host
UCLA captured fourth place with
287.6 points.
On the basis of their
performances in the conference
meet, Steve Hug, Ted Marcy,
Howard Bessen, and Shawn
Skerrett qualified for the NCAA
Championships, which begin
tomorrow at Eugene, Oregon. The
conference champion Bears will
represent the Pac-8 in the team
championships.
The Pac-8 competition began
last Thursday with the
compulsories. The Cards had a
little trouble, especially on the
high bar and parallel bars, where
Stanford had only three men

competing. This left no room for
error, since the top three for each
team score in each event.
Despite the somewhat
mediocre performances in some of
the compulsories, the Cards ended
Thursday in third place with
142.0 points. USC was a close
fourth at 141.2.
Highest Mark
Friday's optionals began with
floor exercise. Steve Hug turned
in an excellent 9.1 performance to
complement his 8.85 compulsory
score for an 8.98 average. In the
side horse which followed, Marcy
scored an outstanding 9.55, the
highest mark of the meet in any
event. His 8.95 the day before
gave him a 9.25 average which was
easily enough to win the event.
The Cards' strongest event was
the rings. Scores of 9.0 by Hug,
9.3 by George Negrete, and 9.45
by Bessen in the optionals gave
the team a score of 27.75, the
highest for any event in the
competition.
Skerrett starred in the vault
with a 9.15 in the optionals and
an 8.93 average for the two days,
which was good enough to give
him a tie for second in that event.
Hug captured first in both the
parallel bars and high bar, but the
Cards' lack of depth in those
events was too strong a factor to
enable them to overcome the gap
between Stanford and
Washington. Hug's outstanding
performances nevertheless won
him the all-around title with a
107.65 total, three points ahead
of his nearest competitor. Hector
Neff was sixth with 91.65.
Individual Competition
The final day of the meet was
devoted to individual
competition, where the average of
the past two days' score was
added to that of a final optional
routine. On the side horse, Marcy
and Hug were 1-2 with 18.45 and
17.83 respectively.
Bessen's 9.25 on the rings the
final day enabled him to move
into first place in that event.
Skerrett moved into undisputed
second place in the vault, with
Hug a close third.
Hug maintained his first place
in the parallel bars with a 9.2

performance, but despite a 9.2 on
the high bar fell to second there
behind a 9.3 by Washington's Bill
Carpenter.
Hug will be competing in the
all-around at the NCAA's and
according to Coach Sadao
Hamada has "a very good chance
to win." He will also participate
in the individual finals in
everything but the rings.
Bessen, who finished sixth in
the NCAA last year, will once
again be competing on the rings.
Skerrett will be aiming for a high
place in the vault. Marcy, who has
won the AAU championship on
the side horse the past two years,
is naturally one of the favorites
and has a good chance of taking
his first NCAA title.

The Stanford gymnastics team,
despite the absence of two of its
three top all-around men, fought
its way to an impressive third
place finish in the Pac-8
championships last weekend with
a 297.65 total. California was the
victor with 315.15, Washington
was second with 305.25, and host
UCLA captured fourth place with
287.6 points.
On the basis of their
performances in the conference
meet, Steve Hug, Ted Marcy,
Howard Bessen, and Shawn
Skerrett qualified for the NCAA
Championships, which begin
tomorrow at Eugene, Oregon. The
conference champion Bears will
represent the Pac-8 in the team
championships.
The Pac-8 competition began
last Thursday with the
compulsories. The Cards had a
little trouble, especially on the
high bar and parallel bars, where
Stanford had only three men

competing. This left no room for
error, since the top three for each
team score in each event.
Despite the somewhat
mediocre performances in some of
the compulsories, the Cards ended
Thursday in third place with
142.0 points. USC was a close
fourth at 141.2.
Highest Mark
Friday's optionals began with
floor exercise. Steve Hug turned
in an excellent 9.1 performance to
complement his 8.85 compulsory
score for an 8.98 average. In the
side horse which followed, Marcy
scored an outstanding 9.55, the
highest mark of the meet in any
event. His 8.95 the day before
gave him a 9.25 average which was
easily enough to win the event.
The Cards' strongest event was
the rings. Scores of 9.0 by Hug,
9.3 by George Negrete, and 9.45
by Bessen in the optionals gave
the team a score of 27.75, the
highest for any event in the
competition.
Skerrett starred in the vault
with a 9.15 in the optionals and
an 8.93 average for the two days,
which was good enough to give
him a tie for second in that event.
Hug captured first in both the
parallel bars and high bar, but the
Cards' lack of depth in those
events was too strong a factor to
enable them to overcome the gap
between Stanford and
Washington. Hug's outstanding
performances nevertheless won
him the all-around title with a
107.65 total, three points ahead
of his nearest competitor. Hector
Neff was sixth with 91.65.
Individual Competition
The final day of the meet was
devoted to individual
competition, where the average of
the past two days' score was
added to that of a final optional
routine. On the side horse, Marcy
and Hug were 1-2 with 18.45 and
17.83 respectively.
Bessen's 9.25 on the rings the
final day enabled him to move
into first place in that event.
Skerrett moved into undisputed
second place in the vault, with
Hug a close third.
Hug maintained his first place
in the parallel bars with a 9.2

performance, but despite a 9.2 on
the high bar fell to second there
behind a 9.3 by Washington's Bill
Carpenter.
Hug will be competing in the
all-around at the NCAA's and
according to Coach Sadao
Hamada has "a very good chance
to win." He will also participate
in the individual finals in
everything but the rings.
Bessen, who finished sixth in
the NCAA last year, will once
again be competing on the rings.
Skerrett will be aiming for a high
place in the vault. Marcy, who has
won the AAU championship on
the side horse the past two years,
is naturally one of the favorites
and has a good chance of taking
his first NCAA title.
