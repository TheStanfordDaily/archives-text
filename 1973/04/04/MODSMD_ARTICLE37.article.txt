Boycott Affects Meat Industry
WASHINGTON — The meat industry began
yesterday to feel the pinch of the nationwide
consumer boycott as wholesalers reported layoffs
and supermarkets said sales were declining.
"It's beginning to look like they mean business,"
said one store manager.
Store spokesmen said meat sales were down Don
Richards, manager of the meat department at
Shaw's Supermarket in Portland, Maine, said meat
purchases were off 60 percent; the operator of the
Hoekstra Meat Market in Kalamazoo, Mich., had
only 10 customers in five hours on Monday. As a
result, Mary Hoekstra closed the retail meat counter
and said it would remain shut until Friday.
Stores in many upper and middle income areas
have been hardest hit by the boycott, according to
CBS News. Meat sales in ghetto area markets have
remained relatively stable.
An Associated Press survey showed the man in
the middle — the wholesaler — was hardest hit by
the boycott that started Sunday in an effort to
force down rising meat prices.
Robert Miller, head of the Union Packing Co. in
Los Angeles, said some retailers have stopped all
beef orders. J.J. Rodriquez, head of Meat Cutters
Local 563 of Los Angeles, said 350 union members
had been laid off.
Union leaders in Philadelphia said about 300
meatcutters had been laid off and several hundred
others were working shorter hours. "We're afraid
this situation could worsen," said Leon B. Schacter,
area national vice president of the Amalgamated
Meatcutters and Butcher Workmen's Union.
"We feel that meat is too high for our own
members, but we don't feel the remedy is the
boycott.
More Vietnam Involvement?
WASHINGTON — Secretary of Defense Elliot L.
Richardson said yesterday the United States would
have to consider "reintroduction of U.S. air
support" if Hanoi launched another massive
invasion of South Vietnam.
But he said such an invasion is unlikely and that
he believes South Vietnamese forces could defend
themselves against anything short of that without
U.S. help.
Richardson testifying before the House Defense
Appropriations Subcommittee also said he could
not answer the question of whether American
bombing in Cambodia could become a long-term
commitment.
Meanwhile in Cambodia American 852 sand
Fill swing-wing fighter-bombers pounded
insurgent forces yesterday in some of the heaviest
air attacks of the Cambodian war, U.S. sources
reported.
Every available 852 in Southeast Asia
participated in the massive bombings, apparently
designed to beat Cambodia's Khmer Rouge rebels
and their North Vietnamese allies into accepting a
peace settlement, the official American sources

added.
The wide-ranging aerial assault was reported to
extend beyond tactical support for Cambodian
government ground forces and suggested a new turn
in the three-year war.
Nixon, Thieu Conclude Talks
SAN CLEMENTE — President Nixon and President
Nguyen Van Thieu threatened "vigorous reactions"
against Communist cease-fire violations yesterday as
Nixon promised substantial postwar economic aid
for South Vietnam.
But the communique crowning two days of
summit talks at the Western White House made no
specific pledge of renewed U.S. military
intervention and gave no specific dollar figure for
what it termed an "adequate and substantial"
economic aid program.
The presidents of the nations allied in a decade
of war also pledged in farewell remarks that they
would make full joint efforts to consolidate the
fragile Indochina peace.
Thieu came to Nixon's oceanside compound
seeking a guarantee that the United States would
intervene militarily in response to any blatant
violations of the cease-fire agreement signed two
months ago.
In the 1,500-word communique, Nixon ruled out
none of his options. But the document did not
contain a precise guarantee of renewed U.S. military
involvement.
Liddy Refuses To Testify
WASHINGTON — A federal judge yesterday
sentenced Watergate conspirator G. Gordon Liddy
to an additional prison term of up to 18 months for
refusing to tell a grand jury whether anyone else was
involved in the affair besides those convicted.
It was Liddy who supposedly told fellow
conspirator James W. McCord that former Atty.
Gen. John N. Mitchell, White House counsel John
W. Dean 111 and former Nixon re-election official
Jeb Magruder also were involved.
He reportedly said they discussed bugging and
other related operations well in advance of last
June's break-in and wiretapping of Democratic
headquarters at the Watergate building.
McCord had quoted Liddy to that effect in secret
testimony before a Senate committee investigating
the case, according to several sources.
But Liddy repeatedly refused to tell a federal
grand jury whether he knows of anyone else
involved in the crime.
Mitchell and Magruder have denied involvement
and the White House says Dean wasn't involved.
Senate Sustains Nixon Veto
WASHINGTON — President Nixon won his first
spending clash with Congress yesterday when the
Senate sustained his veto of a $2.6-billion bill for
rehabilitating the handicapped.
The Senate mustered a 60-36 majority in favor of
overriding the veto, but it was four votes short of
the two-thirds majority needed. No House vote was

taken since both Houses must override to pass a
vetoed bill.
The rehabilitation bill was the first of a dozen
bills pocket vetoed by Nixon last year after
Congress adjourned which Democratic congressional
leaders had hoped to override.
The importance of upholding Nixon on this first
test was stressed by Sen. Robert P. Griffin
(R-Mich.), the GOP whip who led the Senate floor
fight for the administration.
Griffin predicted that if the Senate overrode, it
would lead to passage of other bills that would
increase spending $50 billion over Nixon's budget.
House Speaker Carl Albert and Senate Majority
Leader Mike Mansfield both expressed
disappointment at the Senate vote but said they
would go ahead with the plan on other bills.
House Committee Urges Freeze
WASHINGTON — The House Banking Committee
voted yesterday for a freeze on prices and interest
rates at their March 16 levels but approved a
rollback in food prices to May 1, 1972.
The committee, considering legislation to extend
the Economic Stabilization Act for another year,
took the action after defeating a move to roll back
food prices to their Jan. 11 levels.
That's the date President Nixon imposed his
Phase 3 economic controls.
Republicans, in a strategic move, joined several
Democrats on the committee in approving the May
1, 1972, price rollback date. They argued that
because the provision is so impractical, it would be
defeated on the House floor.
Ex-Senator Testifies In Trial
LOS ANGELES — An 86-year-old former senator
testified yesterday that the Viet Cong were well
aware of certain secrets in the Pentagon Papers
while the events were hidden from Congress and the
American people.
"The enemy knew all about it," said Ernest
Gruening. "The only people who were uninformed
were the American people and the Congress." He
spoke of pages of the papers relating a secret peace
effort by a third party emissary to North Vietnam
in 1964.
Gruening, a former governor of Alaska and a
Democratic senator until 1969, declared that a
secret naval communications cable, not released to
Congress at the time it was sent, showed that the
alleged attack on U.S. destroyers in the Gulf of
Tonkin in 1964 had never occurred. The telegram,
part of which he read to jurors, attributed the
erroneous report of an attack to a mistake caused
by "freakish weather conditions."
Most of Gruening's comments about the
resolution were stricken from the record after jurors
heard them.

have to consider "reintroduction of U.S. air
support" if Hanoi launched another massive
invasion of South Vietnam.
But he said such an invasion is unlikely and that
he believes South Vietnamese forces could defend
themselves against anything short of that without
U.S. help.
Richardson testifying before the House Defense
Appropriations Subcommittee also said he could
not answer the question of whether American
bombing in Cambodia could become a long-term
commitment.
Meanwhile in Cambodia American 852 sand
Fill swing-wing fighter-bombers pounded
insurgent forces yesterday in some of the heaviest
air attacks of the Cambodian war, U.S. sources
reported.
Every available 852 in Southeast Asia
participated in the massive bombings, apparently
designed to beat Cambodia's Khmer Rouge rebels
and their North Vietnamese allies into accepting a
peace settlement, the official American sources

added.
The wide-ranging aerial assault was reported to
extend beyond tactical support for Cambodian
government ground forces and suggested a new turn
in the three-year war.
Nixon, Thieu Conclude Talks
SAN CLEMENTE — President Nixon and President
Nguyen Van Thieu threatened "vigorous reactions"
against Communist cease-fire violations yesterday as
Nixon promised substantial postwar economic aid
for South Vietnam.
But the communique crowning two days of
summit talks at the Western White House made no
specific pledge of renewed U.S. military
intervention and gave no specific dollar figure for
what it termed an "adequate and substantial"
economic aid program.
The presidents of the nations allied in a decade
of war also pledged in farewell remarks that they
would make full joint efforts to consolidate the
fragile Indochina peace.
Thieu came to Nixon's oceanside compound
seeking a guarantee that the United States would
intervene militarily in response to any blatant
violations of the cease-fire agreement signed two
months ago.
In the 1,500-word communique, Nixon ruled out
none of his options. But the document did not
contain a precise guarantee of renewed U.S. military
involvement.
Liddy Refuses To Testify
WASHINGTON — A federal judge yesterday
sentenced Watergate conspirator G. Gordon Liddy
to an additional prison term of up to 18 months for
refusing to tell a grand jury whether anyone else was
involved in the affair besides those convicted.
It was Liddy who supposedly told fellow
conspirator James W. McCord that former Atty.
Gen. John N. Mitchell, White House counsel John
W. Dean 111 and former Nixon re-election official
Jeb Magruder also were involved.
He reportedly said they discussed bugging and
other related operations well in advance of last
June's break-in and wiretapping of Democratic
headquarters at the Watergate building.
McCord had quoted Liddy to that effect in secret
testimony before a Senate committee investigating
the case, according to several sources.
But Liddy repeatedly refused to tell a federal
grand jury whether he knows of anyone else
involved in the crime.
Mitchell and Magruder have denied involvement
and the White House says Dean wasn't involved.
Senate Sustains Nixon Veto
WASHINGTON — President Nixon won his first
spending clash with Congress yesterday when the
Senate sustained his veto of a $2.6-billion bill for
rehabilitating the handicapped.
The Senate mustered a 60-36 majority in favor of
overriding the veto, but it was four votes short of
the two-thirds majority needed. No House vote was

taken since both Houses must override to pass a
vetoed bill.
The rehabilitation bill was the first of a dozen
bills pocket vetoed by Nixon last year after
Congress adjourned which Democratic congressional
leaders had hoped to override.
The importance of upholding Nixon on this first
test was stressed by Sen. Robert P. Griffin
(R-Mich.), the GOP whip who led the Senate floor
fight for the administration.
Griffin predicted that if the Senate overrode, it
would lead to passage of other bills that would
increase spending $50 billion over Nixon's budget.
House Speaker Carl Albert and Senate Majority
Leader Mike Mansfield both expressed
disappointment at the Senate vote but said they
would go ahead with the plan on other bills.
House Committee Urges Freeze
WASHINGTON — The House Banking Committee
voted yesterday for a freeze on prices and interest
rates at their March 16 levels but approved a
rollback in food prices to May 1, 1972.
The committee, considering legislation to extend
the Economic Stabilization Act for another year,
took the action after defeating a move to roll back
food prices to their Jan. 11 levels.
That's the date President Nixon imposed his
Phase 3 economic controls.
Republicans, in a strategic move, joined several
Democrats on the committee in approving the May
1, 1972, price rollback date. They argued that
because the provision is so impractical, it would be
defeated on the House floor.
Ex-Senator Testifies In Trial
LOS ANGELES — An 86-year-old former senator
testified yesterday that the Viet Cong were well
aware of certain secrets in the Pentagon Papers
while the events were hidden from Congress and the
American people.
"The enemy knew all about it," said Ernest
Gruening. "The only people who were uninformed
were the American people and the Congress." He
spoke of pages of the papers relating a secret peace
effort by a third party emissary to North Vietnam
in 1964.
Gruening, a former governor of Alaska and a
Democratic senator until 1969, declared that a
secret naval communications cable, not released to
Congress at the time it was sent, showed that the
alleged attack on U.S. destroyers in the Gulf of
Tonkin in 1964 had never occurred. The telegram,
part of which he read to jurors, attributed the
erroneous report of an attack to a mistake caused
by "freakish weather conditions."
Most of Gruening's comments about the
resolution were stricken from the record after jurors
heard them.

Boycott Affects Meat Industry
WASHINGTON — The meat industry began
yesterday to feel the pinch of the nationwide
consumer boycott as wholesalers reported layoffs
and supermarkets said sales were declining.
"It's beginning to look like they mean business,"
said one store manager.
Store spokesmen said meat sales were down Don
Richards, manager of the meat department at
Shaw's Supermarket in Portland, Maine, said meat
purchases were off 60 percent; the operator of the
Hoekstra Meat Market in Kalamazoo, Mich., had
only 10 customers in five hours on Monday. As a
result, Mary Hoekstra closed the retail meat counter
and said it would remain shut until Friday.
Stores in many upper and middle income areas
have been hardest hit by the boycott, according to
CBS News. Meat sales in ghetto area markets have
remained relatively stable.
An Associated Press survey showed the man in
the middle — the wholesaler — was hardest hit by
the boycott that started Sunday in an effort to
force down rising meat prices.
Robert Miller, head of the Union Packing Co. in
Los Angeles, said some retailers have stopped all
beef orders. J.J. Rodriquez, head of Meat Cutters
Local 563 of Los Angeles, said 350 union members
had been laid off.
Union leaders in Philadelphia said about 300
meatcutters had been laid off and several hundred
others were working shorter hours. "We're afraid
this situation could worsen," said Leon B. Schacter,
area national vice president of the Amalgamated
Meatcutters and Butcher Workmen's Union.
"We feel that meat is too high for our own
members, but we don't feel the remedy is the
boycott.

Liddy Refuses To Testify
WASHINGTON — A federal judge yesterday
sentenced Watergate conspirator G. Gordon Liddy
to an additional prison term of up to 18 months for
refusing to tell a grand jury whether anyone else was
involved in the affair besides those convicted.
It was Liddy who supposedly told fellow
conspirator James W. McCord that former Atty.
Gen. John N. Mitchell, White House counsel John
W. Dean 111 and former Nixon re-election official
Jeb Magruder also were involved.
He reportedly said they discussed bugging and
other related operations well in advance of last
June's break-in and wiretapping of Democratic
headquarters at the Watergate building.
McCord had quoted Liddy to that effect in secret
testimony before a Senate committee investigating
the case, according to several sources.
But Liddy repeatedly refused to tell a federal
grand jury whether he knows of anyone else
involved in the crime.
Mitchell and Magruder have denied involvement
and the White House says Dean wasn't involved.
Senate Sustains Nixon Veto
WASHINGTON — President Nixon won his first
spending clash with Congress yesterday when the
Senate sustained his veto of a $2.6-billion bill for
rehabilitating the handicapped.
The Senate mustered a 60-36 majority in favor of
overriding the veto, but it was four votes short of
the two-thirds majority needed. No House vote was

taken since both Houses must override to pass a
vetoed bill.
The rehabilitation bill was the first of a dozen
bills pocket vetoed by Nixon last year after
Congress adjourned which Democratic congressional
leaders had hoped to override.
The importance of upholding Nixon on this first
test was stressed by Sen. Robert P. Griffin
(R-Mich.), the GOP whip who led the Senate floor
fight for the administration.
Griffin predicted that if the Senate overrode, it
would lead to passage of other bills that would
increase spending $50 billion over Nixon's budget.
House Speaker Carl Albert and Senate Majority
Leader Mike Mansfield both expressed
disappointment at the Senate vote but said they
would go ahead with the plan on other bills.
House Committee Urges Freeze
WASHINGTON — The House Banking Committee
voted yesterday for a freeze on prices and interest
rates at their March 16 levels but approved a
rollback in food prices to May 1, 1972.
The committee, considering legislation to extend
the Economic Stabilization Act for another year,
took the action after defeating a move to roll back
food prices to their Jan. 11 levels.
That's the date President Nixon imposed his
Phase 3 economic controls.
Republicans, in a strategic move, joined several
Democrats on the committee in approving the May
1, 1972, price rollback date. They argued that
because the provision is so impractical, it would be
defeated on the House floor.
Ex-Senator Testifies In Trial
LOS ANGELES — An 86-year-old former senator
testified yesterday that the Viet Cong were well
aware of certain secrets in the Pentagon Papers
while the events were hidden from Congress and the
American people.
"The enemy knew all about it," said Ernest
Gruening. "The only people who were uninformed
were the American people and the Congress." He
spoke of pages of the papers relating a secret peace
effort by a third party emissary to North Vietnam
in 1964.
Gruening, a former governor of Alaska and a
Democratic senator until 1969, declared that a
secret naval communications cable, not released to
Congress at the time it was sent, showed that the
alleged attack on U.S. destroyers in the Gulf of
Tonkin in 1964 had never occurred. The telegram,
part of which he read to jurors, attributed the
erroneous report of an attack to a mistake caused
by "freakish weather conditions."
Most of Gruening's comments about the
resolution were stricken from the record after jurors
heard them.

Boycott Affects Meat Industry
WASHINGTON — The meat industry began
yesterday to feel the pinch of the nationwide
consumer boycott as wholesalers reported layoffs
and supermarkets said sales were declining.
"It's beginning to look like they mean business,"
said one store manager.
Store spokesmen said meat sales were down Don
Richards, manager of the meat department at
Shaw's Supermarket in Portland, Maine, said meat
purchases were off 60 percent; the operator of the
Hoekstra Meat Market in Kalamazoo, Mich., had
only 10 customers in five hours on Monday. As a
result, Mary Hoekstra closed the retail meat counter
and said it would remain shut until Friday.
Stores in many upper and middle income areas
have been hardest hit by the boycott, according to
CBS News. Meat sales in ghetto area markets have
remained relatively stable.
An Associated Press survey showed the man in
the middle — the wholesaler — was hardest hit by
the boycott that started Sunday in an effort to
force down rising meat prices.
Robert Miller, head of the Union Packing Co. in
Los Angeles, said some retailers have stopped all
beef orders. J.J. Rodriquez, head of Meat Cutters
Local 563 of Los Angeles, said 350 union members
had been laid off.
Union leaders in Philadelphia said about 300
meatcutters had been laid off and several hundred
others were working shorter hours. "We're afraid
this situation could worsen," said Leon B. Schacter,
area national vice president of the Amalgamated
Meatcutters and Butcher Workmen's Union.
"We feel that meat is too high for our own
members, but we don't feel the remedy is the
boycott.
More Vietnam Involvement?
WASHINGTON — Secretary of Defense Elliot L.
Richardson said yesterday the United States would
have to consider "reintroduction of U.S. air
support" if Hanoi launched another massive
invasion of South Vietnam.
But he said such an invasion is unlikely and that
he believes South Vietnamese forces could defend
themselves against anything short of that without
U.S. help.
Richardson testifying before the House Defense
Appropriations Subcommittee also said he could
not answer the question of whether American
bombing in Cambodia could become a long-term
commitment.
Meanwhile in Cambodia American 852 sand
Fill swing-wing fighter-bombers pounded
insurgent forces yesterday in some of the heaviest
air attacks of the Cambodian war, U.S. sources
reported.
Every available 852 in Southeast Asia
participated in the massive bombings, apparently
designed to beat Cambodia's Khmer Rouge rebels
and their North Vietnamese allies into accepting a
peace settlement, the official American sources

added.
The wide-ranging aerial assault was reported to
extend beyond tactical support for Cambodian
government ground forces and suggested a new turn
in the three-year war.
Nixon, Thieu Conclude Talks
SAN CLEMENTE — President Nixon and President
Nguyen Van Thieu threatened "vigorous reactions"
against Communist cease-fire violations yesterday as
Nixon promised substantial postwar economic aid
for South Vietnam.
But the communique crowning two days of
summit talks at the Western White House made no
specific pledge of renewed U.S. military
intervention and gave no specific dollar figure for
what it termed an "adequate and substantial"
economic aid program.
The presidents of the nations allied in a decade
of war also pledged in farewell remarks that they
would make full joint efforts to consolidate the
fragile Indochina peace.
Thieu came to Nixon's oceanside compound
seeking a guarantee that the United States would
intervene militarily in response to any blatant
violations of the cease-fire agreement signed two
months ago.

bills pocket vetoed by Nixon last year after
Congress adjourned which Democratic congressional
leaders had hoped to override.
The importance of upholding Nixon on this first
test was stressed by Sen. Robert P. Griffin
(R-Mich.), the GOP whip who led the Senate floor
fight for the administration.
Griffin predicted that if the Senate overrode, it
would lead to passage of other bills that would
increase spending $50 billion over Nixon's budget.
House Speaker Carl Albert and Senate Majority
Leader Mike Mansfield both expressed
disappointment at the Senate vote but said they
would go ahead with the plan on other bills.
House Committee Urges Freeze
WASHINGTON — The House Banking Committee
voted yesterday for a freeze on prices and interest
rates at their March 16 levels but approved a
rollback in food prices to May 1, 1972.
The committee, considering legislation to extend
the Economic Stabilization Act for another year,
took the action after defeating a move to roll back
food prices to their Jan. 11 levels.
That's the date President Nixon imposed his
Phase 3 economic controls.
Republicans, in a strategic move, joined several
Democrats on the committee in approving the May
1, 1972, price rollback date. They argued that
because the provision is so impractical, it would be
defeated on the House floor.
Ex-Senator Testifies In Trial
LOS ANGELES — An 86-year-old former senator
testified yesterday that the Viet Cong were well
aware of certain secrets in the Pentagon Papers
while the events were hidden from Congress and the
American people.
"The enemy knew all about it," said Ernest
Gruening. "The only people who were uninformed
were the American people and the Congress." He
spoke of pages of the papers relating a secret peace
effort by a third party emissary to North Vietnam
in 1964.
Gruening, a former governor of Alaska and a
Democratic senator until 1969, declared that a
secret naval communications cable, not released to
Congress at the time it was sent, showed that the
alleged attack on U.S. destroyers in the Gulf of
Tonkin in 1964 had never occurred. The telegram,
part of which he read to jurors, attributed the
erroneous report of an attack to a mistake caused
by "freakish weather conditions."
Most of Gruening's comments about the
resolution were stricken from the record after jurors
heard them.

Boycott Affects Meat Industry
WASHINGTON — The meat industry began
yesterday to feel the pinch of the nationwide
consumer boycott as wholesalers reported layoffs
and supermarkets said sales were declining.
"It's beginning to look like they mean business,"
said one store manager.
Store spokesmen said meat sales were down Don
Richards, manager of the meat department at
Shaw's Supermarket in Portland, Maine, said meat
purchases were off 60 percent; the operator of the
Hoekstra Meat Market in Kalamazoo, Mich., had
only 10 customers in five hours on Monday. As a
result, Mary Hoekstra closed the retail meat counter
and said it would remain shut until Friday.
Stores in many upper and middle income areas
have been hardest hit by the boycott, according to
CBS News. Meat sales in ghetto area markets have
remained relatively stable.
An Associated Press survey showed the man in
the middle — the wholesaler — was hardest hit by
the boycott that started Sunday in an effort to
force down rising meat prices.
Robert Miller, head of the Union Packing Co. in
Los Angeles, said some retailers have stopped all
beef orders. J.J. Rodriquez, head of Meat Cutters
Local 563 of Los Angeles, said 350 union members
had been laid off.
Union leaders in Philadelphia said about 300
meatcutters had been laid off and several hundred
others were working shorter hours. "We're afraid
this situation could worsen," said Leon B. Schacter,
area national vice president of the Amalgamated
Meatcutters and Butcher Workmen's Union.
"We feel that meat is too high for our own
members, but we don't feel the remedy is the
boycott.
More Vietnam Involvement?
WASHINGTON — Secretary of Defense Elliot L.
Richardson said yesterday the United States would
have to consider "reintroduction of U.S. air
support" if Hanoi launched another massive
invasion of South Vietnam.
But he said such an invasion is unlikely and that
he believes South Vietnamese forces could defend
themselves against anything short of that without
U.S. help.
Richardson testifying before the House Defense
Appropriations Subcommittee also said he could
not answer the question of whether American
bombing in Cambodia could become a long-term
commitment.
Meanwhile in Cambodia American 852 sand
Fill swing-wing fighter-bombers pounded
insurgent forces yesterday in some of the heaviest
air attacks of the Cambodian war, U.S. sources
reported.
Every available 852 in Southeast Asia
participated in the massive bombings, apparently
designed to beat Cambodia's Khmer Rouge rebels
and their North Vietnamese allies into accepting a
peace settlement, the official American sources

added.
The wide-ranging aerial assault was reported to
extend beyond tactical support for Cambodian
government ground forces and suggested a new turn
in the three-year war.
Nixon, Thieu Conclude Talks
SAN CLEMENTE — President Nixon and President
Nguyen Van Thieu threatened "vigorous reactions"
against Communist cease-fire violations yesterday as
Nixon promised substantial postwar economic aid
for South Vietnam.
But the communique crowning two days of
summit talks at the Western White House made no
specific pledge of renewed U.S. military
intervention and gave no specific dollar figure for
what it termed an "adequate and substantial"
economic aid program.
The presidents of the nations allied in a decade
of war also pledged in farewell remarks that they
would make full joint efforts to consolidate the
fragile Indochina peace.
Thieu came to Nixon's oceanside compound
seeking a guarantee that the United States would
intervene militarily in response to any blatant
violations of the cease-fire agreement signed two
months ago.
In the 1,500-word communique, Nixon ruled out
none of his options. But the document did not
contain a precise guarantee of renewed U.S. military
involvement.
Liddy Refuses To Testify
WASHINGTON — A federal judge yesterday
sentenced Watergate conspirator G. Gordon Liddy
to an additional prison term of up to 18 months for
refusing to tell a grand jury whether anyone else was
involved in the affair besides those convicted.
It was Liddy who supposedly told fellow
conspirator James W. McCord that former Atty.
Gen. John N. Mitchell, White House counsel John
W. Dean 111 and former Nixon re-election official
Jeb Magruder also were involved.
He reportedly said they discussed bugging and
other related operations well in advance of last
June's break-in and wiretapping of Democratic
headquarters at the Watergate building.
McCord had quoted Liddy to that effect in secret
testimony before a Senate committee investigating
the case, according to several sources.
But Liddy repeatedly refused to tell a federal
grand jury whether he knows of anyone else
involved in the crime.
Mitchell and Magruder have denied involvement
and the White House says Dean wasn't involved.
Senate Sustains Nixon Veto
WASHINGTON — President Nixon won his first
spending clash with Congress yesterday when the
Senate sustained his veto of a $2.6-billion bill for
rehabilitating the handicapped.
The Senate mustered a 60-36 majority in favor of
overriding the veto, but it was four votes short of
the two-thirds majority needed. No House vote was

taken since both Houses must override to pass a
vetoed bill.
The rehabilitation bill was the first of a dozen
bills pocket vetoed by Nixon last year after
Congress adjourned which Democratic congressional
leaders had hoped to override.
The importance of upholding Nixon on this first
test was stressed by Sen. Robert P. Griffin
(R-Mich.), the GOP whip who led the Senate floor

would lead to passage of other bills that would
