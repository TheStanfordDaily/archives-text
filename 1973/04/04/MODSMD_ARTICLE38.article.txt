# Ruchell Magee Trial Ends In Hung Jury
## 
### Associated Press 
SAN FRANCISCO â€” The judge in the
Ruchell Magee murder-kidnap trial
declared a mistrial yesterday after
jurors said they were hopelessly
deadlocked.
Judge Morton C. Colvin ordered the
mistrial after the jurors, who had
deliberated eight days, announced for
the fifth time that they were
hopelessly deadlocked.
Magee, 34, a black convict serving a
life term at San Quentin, was accused
of kidnaping and murdering Judge
Harold J. Haley and of kidnaping four
others in the Aug. 7, 1970 Marin
County courthouse escape attempt.
Magee's lawyer, Robert Carrow,
said a juror told him the panel was
split 11 to 1 in favor of finding Magee
guilty of kidnaping, but 11 to 1 in
favor of finding him innocent of
murdering the judge.
Black Juror Holds Out
Moses Shepherd, one of three
blacks on the jury, told a reporter he
was the holdout who refused to vote
to convict Magee on both charges.
"I was staunch for acquittal on
both counts," Shepherd said as the
jury filed onto a sheriff's bus. Others
refused to comment.

Shepherd also said, "I didn't believe
he was guilty. The prosecutor didn't
prove his case."
Magee Happy, Tired
Magee, appearing happy but tired,
said nothing when the ruling was
made.
"It is regrettable that 12 minds
could not reach a unanimous verdict,"
Colvin said, citing the considerable
time and expense involved in the trial.
Prosecutor Albert Harris Jr. told a
reporter: "There will be a retrial and
any comment I might make might be
prejudicial."
Accused Of Shooting
Magee was specifically accused of
pulling the trigger of a sawed-off
shotgun that blew off Haley's head.
In the escape try, Magee and other
black convicts testifying in the Marin
courtroom joined a black youth,
Jonathan Jackson, in trying to take
Judge Haley, a young prosecutor and
three women jurors hostage.
Jackson and two black convicts also
were killed in the violence.
Black militant Angela Davis,
accused of attempting to plot the
crime, was found innocent of murder,
kidnap and conspiracy charges in a
separate trial last June 4.
