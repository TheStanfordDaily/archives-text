# Yorty, Bradley Lead LA Primary
## 
### 
From the Associated Press
Mayor Sam Yorty and city
councilman Thomas Bradley led the
field in yesterday's Los Angeles
mayoral primary, and will meet in a
May 29 runoff.
The two traded the lead of the
13-man field throughout the evening.

With 60 percent of the ballots
counted, Yorty had 30 percent of the
vote and Bradley 33 percent. But the
percentages fluctuated as the ballots
were counted.
Former state Assembly Speaker
Jess Unruh placed third with 18
percent, and former police chief
Thomas Reddin ran fourth with 12
percent.
Yorty, a maverick conservative
Democrat, defeated Bradley, who is
black, in the 1969 mayoral runoff.
Yorty is seeking a fourth term in City
Hall.
In 1969, Bradley led a large
primary field, but lost narrowly to
Yorty in a runoff campaign marked by
racial insinuations.
This year's campaign has been
relatively lackluster. Last week, the
respected Field Poll projected that
Bradley would win yesterday's
primary, but that he and Yorty would
be forced ijito a runoff.
City officials estimated that about
700,000 citizens went to the polls —
about 58 percent of the 1.2 million
eligibles in the nation's third largest
city.
The early returns last night were

dominated by central city precincts in
which Bradley ran strongest. When
more conservative areas in the San
Fernando Valley reported later, Yorty
erased Bradley's narrow lead, but
Bradley later regained the edge.
But it was clear throughout the
evening that Yorty and Bradley would
meet in a runoff.
The major candidates generally
agreed on the two major issues of the
campaign. They were for more law and
order and said they would work for a
rapid transit system.
For the other 12 candidates, the
real issue was Yorty: the stocky,
sandy-haired, energetic 63-year-old
man who made an abortive bid for
President last year.
They criticized his showman's style,
his globe-circling trade development
jaunts and his avowed "maverick
mayor" brand of political
conservatism.
His repeated reply to all of that —
the core of his low-key campaign —
came in the slightly raspy, nasal tones
of his native Nebraska: "We have the
best-run city in the United States. We
like it like it is."

TRESIDDER DEFICIT — Students wait in line at the Tresidder cafeteria, which, along with the Encina snack bar, is the
Union's major money-loser. With rising food costs and a projected $240,000 deficit, many student jobs in the food
service will have to be eliminated as part of the Union's struggle to break even.
Bradley, 55, waged the most costly
— an estimated $600,000 — and
aggressive campaign featuring
television commercials showing the
former policeman and college track
star chatting with construction
workers and police — mostly white —
and pledging to be "a working
mayor."
Polyglot And Disjointed
Yorty, 63, says he has forged
polyglot, disjointed Los Angeles into
the cultural and financial center of the
West during his 12 years of leadership.
But Bradley claimed Yorty allowed
decay, blight and poverty to set in.
Bradley, the first black
president-elect of the National League
of Cities, interrupted his campaign to
go to Washington to battle President
Nixon's domestic budget cuts.
Unruh, 50, once considered the
most powerful politician in California,

battled for his political life yesterday.
He quit the Assembly in 1970 for an
unsuccessful attempt to oust Gov.
Ronald Reagan. Unruh proposed
establishment of a lottery to help
finance a rail rapid transit system. As
for Yorty, Unruh said, "Sam has had
it. Twelve years are enough."
Fight Crime
Reddin, 56, quit as police chief
under Yorty several years ago for a
short career as a television news
commentator. Reddin said he was the
man best equipped to fight crime in
Los Angeles.
Bradley accused Yorty of using
racism against him in 1969 and he
vowed that this time "we're not going
to sit back and take all that garbage
they hand out like we did four years
ago."
All the major contenders were
Democrats, but the office is
nonpartisan.

percent, and former police chief
Thomas Reddin ran fourth with 12
percent.
Yorty, a maverick conservative
Democrat, defeated Bradley, who is
black, in the 1969 mayoral runoff.
Yorty is seeking a fourth term in City
Hall.
In 1969, Bradley led a large
primary field, but lost narrowly to
Yorty in a runoff campaign marked by
racial insinuations.
This year's campaign has been
relatively lackluster. Last week, the
respected Field Poll projected that
Bradley would win yesterday's
primary, but that he and Yorty would
be forced ijito a runoff.
City officials estimated that about
700,000 citizens went to the polls —
about 58 percent of the 1.2 million
eligibles in the nation's third largest
city.
The early returns last night were

dominated by central city precincts in
which Bradley ran strongest. When
more conservative areas in the San
Fernando Valley reported later, Yorty
erased Bradley's narrow lead, but
Bradley later regained the edge.
But it was clear throughout the
evening that Yorty and Bradley would
meet in a runoff.
The major candidates generally
agreed on the two major issues of the
campaign. They were for more law and
order and said they would work for a
rapid transit system.
For the other 12 candidates, the
real issue was Yorty: the stocky,
sandy-haired, energetic 63-year-old
man who made an abortive bid for
President last year.
They criticized his showman's style,
his globe-circling trade development
jaunts and his avowed "maverick
mayor" brand of political
conservatism.
His repeated reply to all of that —
the core of his low-key campaign —
came in the slightly raspy, nasal tones
of his native Nebraska: "We have the
best-run city in the United States. We
like it like it is."

TRESIDDER DEFICIT — Students wait in line at the Tresidder cafeteria, which, along with the Encina snack bar, is the
Union's major money-loser. With rising food costs and a projected $240,000 deficit, many student jobs in the food
service will have to be eliminated as part of the Union's struggle to break even.
Bradley, 55, waged the most costly
— an estimated $600,000 — and
aggressive campaign featuring
television commercials showing the
former policeman and college track
star chatting with construction
workers and police — mostly white —
and pledging to be "a working
mayor."
Polyglot And Disjointed
Yorty, 63, says he has forged
polyglot, disjointed Los Angeles into
the cultural and financial center of the
West during his 12 years of leadership.
But Bradley claimed Yorty allowed
decay, blight and poverty to set in.
Bradley, the first black
president-elect of the National League
of Cities, interrupted his campaign to
go to Washington to battle President
Nixon's domestic budget cuts.
Unruh, 50, once considered the
most powerful politician in California,

battled for his political life yesterday.
He quit the Assembly in 1970 for an
unsuccessful attempt to oust Gov.
Ronald Reagan. Unruh proposed
establishment of a lottery to help
finance a rail rapid transit system. As
for Yorty, Unruh said, "Sam has had
it. Twelve years are enough."
Fight Crime
Reddin, 56, quit as police chief
under Yorty several years ago for a
short career as a television news
commentator. Reddin said he was the
man best equipped to fight crime in
Los Angeles.
Bradley accused Yorty of using
racism against him in 1969 and he
vowed that this time "we're not going
to sit back and take all that garbage
they hand out like we did four years
