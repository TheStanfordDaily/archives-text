# Court Sentences Prof To 30 Days In Jail
## 
### 
Asst. German Prof. Juan Flores was
sentenced last week to 30 days in jail
by a Santa Clara County court for
violating his probation on charges
stemming from the April, 1971
hospital sit-in.
Flores, charged with throwing a
rock at a police officer near the Old
Union during a demonstration last
May, did not contest the charge. The
court ruled that the second incident
violated the conditions of his
three-year probation on the first. He
has yet to be sentenced for the
rock-throwing charge.
Judge Sidney Feinberg of the Palo
Alto-Mountain View Municipal Court
handed down the 30-day sentence on
March 23, and Flores began serving it
March 26.
Flores, a member of Venceremos, is

serving the time in the Elmwood
Rehabilitation Center in Milpitas.
Former English Prof. Bruce
Franklin, a Venceremos Central
Committee member, said Flores
offered the no contest plea "because
the trial would have taken five weeks
and cost three or four thousand
dollars. But he didn't do it — it was a
ridiculous charge."
For his part in last May's
disturbance, Flores was originally
charged with assaulting an officer, a
felony, but the charge was reduced to
disturbing the peace, a misdemeanor.
"The deal with the Palo Alto DA's
office was no jail time, but then it was
Catch-22," Franklin said. "They
pulled this probation thing on him. It's
a mockery of justice."
