# Lyman Urges Restraint Before Making Broad Changes In Overseas Program
## 
### KEVIN SMITH 
University President Richard Lyman said last
night that he is "not personally convinced that we
need a total change" in the Overseas Campus
Program, adding he differed with the Merryman
Commission report on that point. The presidential
commission urged a major overhauling of the
program in its January report.
Lyman, interviewed on KZSU's "Campus
Conference" program, declared he has "some
anxiety and a desire to be cautious about suggesting
that we're going to sweep the board clear" in
remodeling the overseas campus system.
Talking about the Commission's
recommendation to close the Vienna campus,
Lyman said he "didn't think the Commission was
only concerned with the particular situation in
Vienna because we've had . . . problems practically
everywhere and the total number of students
overseas just is not, at present, enough to justify five
campuses."
Asked if there was any significance to the fact
that the new director of the Overseas Campus
Program, Assoc. History Prof. Mark Mancall, is a
specialist in Southeast Asian studies, Lyman replied,
"As far as I know, the Committee didn't look for
someone who would necessarily have non-European
interests."
Lyman did declare, however, that "it is obvious
from what Mancall has said already that he is
interested in establishing campuses or other kinds of

overseas study opportunities in other parts of the
world."
Effect Of Union Mixed
On the question of the impending election to
choose a union for Stanford's maintenance and
service workers, Lyman was reluctant to predict
what effect such a collective bargaining unit would
have on the University if one were elected.
"It's obvious that there would be both gains and
losses from practically anybody's standpoint," he
said. "There would be such additional strength as
'union' — even with a small 'u' — implies and there
would be some loss of individuality in relationships
within the University ...
Last year, employees voted overwhelmingly to
reject the Teamsters as a bargaining unit. There is no
indication yet that the Teamsters plan to try again
this year, and Lyman said he has "no idea" what the
chances are that this election will result in union
representation.
Two Unions On Ballot
According to Lyman, there are at least two
unions scheduled to appear on the ballot at the
present time: the United Stanford Employees
(USE), who collected enough employee signatures
to force another election, and the Stanford Joint
Council.
Lyman explained that once one union has made
a sufficient showing of support to require an
election, as USE did in this case, then any other
union which has made "the slightest showing of

support" can get on the ballot.
However, that question has apparently touched
off some controversy. "Some of the Stanford Joint
Council leafleting a week or so ago was extremely
erroneous on that point. They were trying to make
it seem as if somehow the USE and the University
were combining to keep them off the ballot. They
knew perfectly well they could get on the ballot by
filing a single card."
Cost Cutting Continues
Asked about what the Administration is doing to
deal with recent increases in tuition, Lyman
responded that "very strenuous efforts are being
made, and have been made for several years now of
course, to cut costs to get the budget back in
balance."
He also mentioned that "there is the constant
effort to raise money by means other than raising
tuition," and cited the possibility of increased
financing by the state as one example.
Regarding the Stanford New Founders League, a
group of conservative alumni who have been quite
critical of Stanford recently, Lyman remarked, "By
and large I think we've concluded that there is no
need to answer every charge that they make.
"There is an enormous amount of quotation out
of context and wrenching facts around — not so
much saying things that are literally untrue as
arranging the facts in a way that suits the editorial
purposes of the paper" which the League publishes,
Lyman said.
