# Ignoring Women's Lib
## Liberals And Liberation 
### 
Meredith Wheeler

Women's Liberation is
becoming harder and harder to
ignore.
God knows I've tried. I mean,
aside from granting notional
assent to the idea of equal pay for
equal work, I floated along
believing that the enlightened
haven of Stanford University was
impenetrable to Archie Bunker
and his bigoted outlook. Certainly
my male friends and teachers were
not tainted with sexist bias. I was
free to be a butcher, baker or
president of the Bank of America,
despite the fact I was born a
female.
Then 1 had a shattering
discussion with Bruce. Intelligent,
witty, liberal Bruce told me that
women did not really have the
intellectual creativity that men
were blessed with. Women were
"supportive" to men. "How many
great women painters, musicians,
and writers can you name?" He
demanded triumphantly. I groped
about in an ignorant muddle while
Bruce smugly smiled.
Hiring
Since then I have thought of
some female counterparts to
Picasso, Bach and Hemingway.
More importantly, I've been

mulling over why indeed women
have made such a poor historical
showing. And on the mundane
and more immediate level, I
suddenly realized if Bruce had the
option of hiring me or Joe Blow,
with equal talents, Joe Blow
would get the job.
I asked Bruce and he hesitantly
admitted (his liberal conscience
no doubt smarting, but honesty,
at least, prevailing), I was right.
My over-confident assurance that
any talented human—regardless of
sex—could overcome the
boogieman of prejudice began to
crumble. The more powerful and
malignant form of prejudice—the
latent brand—was probably
thriving all around me. And that's
the prejudice that'll hurt. After
all, it'll be Stanford men like
Bruce who'll be stepping into the
power structure in government
and business some day.
Up until now, I had blithely
ignored Women's Lib, explaining
to my activist friends, "I just
don't feel oppressed; I haven't
encountered male chauvanism."
Any mild curiosity I may have
had about the woman's movement
was satisfied by a casual thumbing

through of MS. I am not a strident
radical, but I realize now there is a
problem. I'm gingerly trying to
learn more.
Discussions
In an effort to increase my
knowledge and share what I learn,
I'll be co-hosting a series of panel
discussions on the feminist
movement for KZSU. We'll be
talking with students, faculty and
staff from the Stanford
community on topics ranging
from the manipulated man to the
psychology of sex roles. The
program will be aired every
Tuesday evening at 7:30 on
KZSU, 90.1 FM. We invite
everyone to listen and welcome
your comments and criticisms.
