# How Many Premeds
## The 						Premedical Syndrome 
### 
George R. Hamrdla

In a recent conversation with a
premedical senior, I raised a
question about the number of
undergraduate premedical
students at Stanford. In order to
sample someone else's opinion, we
asked another senior (not a
pre-med), 'What percentage of
Stanford undergraduates are
premeds?" The answer: "70
percent." Last year a freshman
asserted to me that 60 percent of
the students in his all-freshman
residence were premeds. We in the
Stanford community are all
familiar with the fact that interest
in careers in medicine and allied
fields has greatly increased among
undergraduates in the U.S., and in
that sense, these two replies are
perhaps understandable.
We also know how many
students approach premedical
courses with fear and
apprehension caused by tales of
cutthroat competition for grades.
We hear of students who apply to
twenty medical schools and are
rejected by all twenty.
The problem is familiar enough
to most of us who work closely
with undergraduates that it could
be called the premed "syndrome."
In this article I want to clarify
some facts about premedical
enrollments, establish some
perspective from which the
premedical syndrome can be
viewed more rationally, and
comment on ways in which the
information we do have can be
made more valid.
Problems Real
In no way do I intend to mask
or minimize or ignore the very
real problems encountered by
premedical students. The number
of applicants to medical schools in
this country has virtually zoomed
upward in recent years, while the
number of available places has
increased more slowly. Stanford's

premedical undergraduates must
complete their premedical
requirements (70 units on the
average) while working on a
regular major (unlike students at
schools which offer premedical
majors). |In fact, however,
premedical requirements and
major requirements overlap
somewhat for many premeds since
most of them choose to major in
Chemistry, Biology, or Human
Biology.)
Premeds generally cannot take
as high a percentage of courses for
Pass/No-Credit grading as many
other students. Their total
collection of courses is perhaps
more difficult than that of other
students. The competition for
places in medical school leads to
competition for grades in
premedical courses and produces
an apprehension among premeds
which is generally justified.
What is not justified—and is
certainly not productive,
especially for the premeds
themselves—is hysteria caused by
vastly exaggerated statistics and
horror stories about the number
of students who fail to gain
entrance to any medical school.
The objective of this article is to
reduce this hysteria and encourage
premedical students to avoid
making it a self-fulfilling
prophecy.
Unreliable Index
Let's examine closely how
many premedical students there
actually are at Stanford. It is
common knowledge, for example,
that the enrollment in Chemistry
31 (Chemistry 1 in recent years).
Biology 1, and Human Biology 1
has mushroomed in the past few
years. The deduction is often
made, however, that the increase
can be attributed to future
premeds. Fact: the area in which
freshmen's preliminary academic

interest increased the most this
year was Natural Sciences/Mathe
matics/Technology, resulting in a
large part of the increased
enrollment in those courses. Using
the number of students in these
courses as an index to the number
of premeds is at best highly
unreliable.
According to official figures
from the Registrar, there were
6,413 undergraduates registered
during Autumn Quarter 1972-73,
or about 1,600 per class. At the
Academic Information Center, we
have made valiant efforts for the
past two and a half years to
identify every premedical student
at Stanford. Our figures show that
this year there are 276 seniors
who have applied to medical
schools for entrance in
September, 1973.
Close to the same number of
freshmen entering Stanford last
fall indicated that their
preliminary academic interest lay
in the premedical/predental area;
since then a few more have added
their names, making a total
number of exactly 305 current
freshmen who consider themselves
to be premedical students. At
present, we have been able to
identify 341 sophomores and 212
juniors (these figures are maximal)
who are premedical students,
making a total of 1134
undergraduates. Hence 1134 out
of 6,413 students are premeds:
17.7 percent. The figure can also
be calculated for each class, but
the result is about the same. The
fact is, therefore, that between 17
percent and 18 percent of
Stanford's undergraduates are
premeds—and there is simply no
data anywhere to support a higher
figure.
Survey
These statistics are borne out
by our Survey of Future
Academic Plans of Graduating
Seniors for 1972 (better known as
the "Senior Survey"). Based on
returns from over 60 percent of
the class of 1972, 17.4 percent of
the respondents indicated that
their eventual aim is to obtain an
M.D. degree. Interestingly enough,
precisely that same percentage of
those surveyed indicate that they
plan to obtain Ph.D. degrees
(regardless of field). Finally, 17.5
percent of those responding
indicate that they aim toward J.D.
degrees. The number of prelaw
students, therefore, is fully as
large as the number of premeds;
since there are no required courses
for a prelaw student, they are a
less homogeneous group, and we
hear less of their problems.
Getting into law school, however,
is not much easier, if at all, than
getting into medical school.
The figures have thus been
established—not more than 18
percent of Stanford
undergraduates are premeds. That
number may enable us to place
the population in better
perspective, but it doesn't help

the premed who is faced, indeed,
with high competition. The new
premedical advising program,
established through the
cooperation of the Office of the
Dean of Undergraduate Studies
and the School of Medicine and
coordinated in the beginning by
Dr. Henry H. Jones and Peter L.
Pansing, Assistant Director of the
AIC, is attempting to respond to
the premeds' situation by making
premed advisors available to all
who need them, by establishing in
the AIC a place where premeds
can come for necessary
information and routine help and
where the collection of
recommendations is centralized,
by preparing a special edition of
the Senior Survey for premeds, by
offering an extensive handbook
for students' use, and finally by
trying to combat unnecessary
hysteria.
Many of the same efforts are
being directed toward a pre law
advising program; business and
education are next. The School of
Engineering maintains an
excellent advising program for its
undergraduates who number a
significant 10 percent of all
undergraduates. The Stanford
Student Premedical Society also
presents informational meetings
and activities designed to give the
premed as solid a base of
information and experience as
possible for a rational choice of
career and medical schools.
Data
Premeds can help us, too. The
special premed questionnaires
("Senior Premed Survey") for
1973 are being distributed during
early Spring Quarter. Every
premed who takes the time to fill
out the questionnaire fully and
conscientiously and returns it as
promptly as possible will be
contributing much-needed
personal data to our base of
information. We will then compile
this information and have it ready
for students' reference before the
end of the academic year so that
students applying to medical
schools for 1974 can benefit from
the survey before completing their
applications.
Premeds should make
themselves aware of the resources
of the AIC, the premedical
advising program, and the Student
Premedical Society. Finally, if
you're a premedical student and
do not have a premedical advisor
or are not certain whether we
have your name, please come to
the AIC on the third floor, Old
Union, and ask to see the
Preprofessional Secretary so that
you can be included in the
programs being planned and your
name added to our lists. But
rememberinflated statistics and
rumors can only create more
tension and unfounded fears, so
avoid them.
