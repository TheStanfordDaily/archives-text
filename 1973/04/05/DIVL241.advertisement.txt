* Aha! The new quarter is upon us, and it is once again time for >
J all good persons to come to the aid of their affinity groups.
The Daily opinions page, aspiring ever to the presentation of a !<
\ lively exchange of significant ideas, urges you to submit articles, j
J letters, and ephemera. No contribution too humble for *
