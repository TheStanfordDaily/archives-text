# Heart Transplant Program Continues To Thrive
## 
### EVE KAUFMAN 
Human heart transplants at
Stanford Medical Center now generate
less commotion than emergency
appendectomies. Five years ago, 150
reporters slept in the hospital corridors
for two weeks awaiting news of the
first Stanford heart transplant.
Although the excitement has
diminished, the transplant program is
thriving. As an increasing number of
patients recover from surgery and
return to active normal lives, the
transplantation team discovers new
factors that make the difference
between survival and failure.
"We're still learning so much," said
Dr. Norman Shumway, the surgeon
responsible for the unique
combination of experimental
competence and clinical expertise that
makes the Stanford program a success.
In an interview in early March,
Shumway, who had been operating
since 3 a.m. and still wore the light
blue surgeons' garb hanging loosely
about his six-foot frame, took time to
discuss the importance of heart
transplantation in terms of both
human lives and new knowledge for
science.
Stanford is the only medical center
that is still performing heart

transplants on a regular basis. The
team averages about one per month.
After the first dramatic operation
accomplished by Christiaan Barnard in
South Africa on December 3, 1967,
surgical teams in 21 countries plunged
into heart transplantation; but poor
survival rates and technical difficulties
slowly extinguished the initial
enthusiasm.
"I think the big problem was that it
was originally felt the operation was
the be-all and end-all for patients with
coronary heart disease," Shumway
said. "But it didn't turn out to be the
unmixed blessing everybody had
hoped for.
"So it swung from great acceptance
to, if you'll pardon the expression,
utter rejection. Now only those who
had the background in experimental
work are still doing it,"he added.
Shumway has been in the
transplant business for almost 15
years. In 1959 he reported to the
Sixth International Transplantation
Conference that he and a colleague,
Dr. Richard Lower, now on the
faculty of the Medical College of
Virginia, had taken the heart from one
dog and put it into the body of
another. The animal lived for eight
days, but over the next six years
Shumway and his associates refined

their techniques, achieving survival
rates for dogs of 60 to 70 percent.
In 1968 Shumway performed the
first human adult transplant in the
United States, using the same surgical
procedures developed during the dog
transplants. Since that time, 56
Stanford patients have received 58
new hearts. (Two patients required a
second transplant after the first
failed.) Post-doctoral fellow Philip K.
Caves reported at the Society of
University Surgeons meeting in
February that Stanford's one-year
survival rates "have steadily improved
from 22 percent in 1968 to 50 percent
in 1970 and 1971."
This improvement reflects the
growing experience in patient selection
and treatment techniques that
Shumway's team has accumulated
through careful monitoring of
transplant recipients and other
terminally ill heart patients.
"People seem to think that there
are thousands of individuals in this
country waiting for transplants," said
the head of the division of
cardiovascular surgery, "but that's not
the case. There are so many
conventional treatments, that the
patient who needs a heart transplant is
very rare."

SURGEONS' HEART WORK — Surgery Prof. Norman Shumway and a team of
surgeons are shown above performing conventional open heart surgery.
Shumway has earned national recognition for his 58 heart transplants at the
Medical Center. Stanford is the only medical center in the world which performs
heart transplants on a regular basis.
This entire process depends,
however, on the ability to
diagnose rejection before it
progresses too far.
In an article soon to be
published, Caves, Dr. Edward B.
Stinson, Dr. M.E. Billingham, and
Shumway report the development
of a new technique for removing
minute pieces for study from an
implanted heart.
Microscopic Examination
A narrow tube is introduced
through a neck vein, explained
Shumway. Tiny teeth on the end
of the tube "take a bite inside the
heart." On several occasions in the
last five transplant recipients,
acute rejection has been diagnosed
from a microscopic examination
of the heart tissue, before any
changes in graft function have
become apparent through
traditional diagnostic techniques.
Shumway said that one of the
best things about this biopsy is
that "it can be done on
out-patients." The only mark it
makes is a hole on the neck which
"looks just like a little pinprick."
As members of the transplant
team examine and treat heart
recipients, they constantly watch
for trends that will reveal new
factors affecting the rejection
response.
'Hottest Present Leads'
"One of the hottest present
leads we have," said Shumway, "is
that patients who have previously
had open heart surgery seem to do
better."
Between July 4, 1970, and
February 1, 1973, 10 of 29
transplant recipients had had at
least one previous heart operation
involving massive blood
transfusions. Nine out of ten of
these patients are still alive, and
the one-year survival rate is 89
percent. The one-year survival rate

for the whole group is 42 percent.
"We don't know why this
happens," Shumway admitted.
"Something has been done to
mute their self-identification.
They don't recognize the graft as
foreign tissue."
Multiple Transfusions
He suggested that because of
the multiple blood transfusions
the patients were being
desensitized. "Their blood
becomes like a mongrel
population, so to speak," he said.
"And their immune system
doesn't reject the heart as readily.
Their immunologic tolerance is
enhanced."
The transplant team is now
trying to reproduce this situation
in the laboratory. "We'll do heart
operations on dogs, and then wait
six months to give them a
transplant," Shumway said.
He explained that if the
transfusions do prove to make a
difference, potential recipients
will be "counter-immunized" with
exchange transfusions. However, a
sample of 29 patients is "much
too limited" to warrant
transfusion therapy at this time.
Clinical Observations
Clinical observations of the
relationships between
transplanted hearts and their new
owners have contributed to
knowledge about the muscle's
function as well as its
immunological characteristics.
A heart muscle has its own
inherent rhythmicity, but it also
reacts to control from the central
nervous system. When a healthy
person becomes excited, a
message travels from his brain to
his heart telling it to speed up.
The signal is reinforced later by
adrenalin (a chemical released
from glands adjacent to the
kidney which acts to increase the
heartbeat).
Because the transplanted heart
has had its nerves severed, it
doesn't react to excitement o;
exercise until the body begins to
release adrenalin into the
bloodstream. Transplant patients
thus provide a unique opportunity

to study the physiology of the
denervated heart.
Mechanical Heart
This investigation will be of
great importance to the engineers
who design the mechanical heart,
which will also lack nervous
control and beat at a fixed rate.
"We're writing down the
specifications for the ideal
mechanical heart as we go," said
Shumway.
He doesn't believe, however,
that the mechanical heart is the
ultimate goal of transplant
surgery. "I think the two fields
will develop together," he
explained. "It will be like the
situation with artificial kidneys;
some patients are better suited to
kidney transplants while others
require artificial organs."
"If we had the mechanical
heart," Shumway continued, "it
would probably be used in older
patients. Smaller, younger
patients would receive
transplants."
Organ Storage
One major problem which
hampers both kidney and heart
transplants is the storage of organs
outside of the body. Doctors are
now able to keep a kidney alive
for 48 hours in a perfusion
machine (an apparatus which
nourishes the organ with a
circulating fluid supply), but
attempts to do the same with
hearts have not been successful.
Shumway said that the
different responses of the heart
and the kidney are due to their
very different shapes and
functions. The heart is a shell,
while the kidney is a solid mass.
In the body, the heart is
constantly changing position —
even in our sleep we turn over
every twenty minutes. But when
the heart is removed and placed in
a perfusion machine its

orientation is static. Fluid drains
from the upper to the lower parts
of the organ, which then swell and
become damaged.
Perfusion Machine
Placing the heart in a perfusion
machine is still amost no better
than putting it in cold saline and
setting it in the refrigerator for 24
hours, Shumway said. The
Stanford team is now working on
the design for an apparatus with a
rocking platform that will help
the heart to maintain its shape
and extend its longevity.
The close correlation between
the experimental and clinical
aspects of heart transplantation is
indicative of the team spirit
which, according to
Christopherson, is one of the chief
assets of the Stanford program.
"Dr. Shumway is the only
heart transplant surgeon who has
worked with the team
philosophy," she said. "He
doesn't act superior; you feel like
you're lucky to have him."
Broad Thinking
The medical students and
Stanford undergraduates who
work under the direction of Dr.
Eugene Dong, Jr., director of
Stanford's clinical transplantation
program, are encouraged to
consider the importance of their
work in relation to the total
transplantation project.
Randall E. Morris, a
fourth-year medical student
whose experiments with chicken
serum were described in the Daily
last October, is working with
several undergraduates in a
continuing effort to find new
methods for preventing transplant
rejection. Morris said that reading
about Shumway's first human
heart transplant inspired his
interest in transplantation.
"The heart transplant was such
a cataclysmic occurrence," he
explained, "that I can't really
explain the impact it had. It was
the type of extraordinary event in
the history of medicine that
always inspires students to go into
research."

Despite the effect he has had
on medicine and transplants in
particular, however, Shumway is
"a very comfortable person to be
around," Christopherson said. His
small office is dominated by two
large tables covered with papers,
and bookshelves weighed down
with volumes of medical journals.
On one wall, two small photos
hang in simple black frames. One
shows the transplant team and the
other his family — his wife, three
daughters and one son.
Aside from transplanting
hearts, Shumway is probably
known most for his sense of
humor. But he didn't want to give
an example of his wit for print.
"Jokes should never be
repeated," he said. "They should
always be spontaneous. There is
nothing worse than somebody
coming up to you and saying,
'Have you heard the one
about.. .?' "
Shumway added, "We can take
all of the referrals we get, and
generally we have no more than
three persons waiting (for heart
donors) at any one time."
In order to be accepted into
the Stanford transplantation
program, patients should be 55
years or younger, completely
incapacitated and in imminent
danger of death, with no other
avenue or less radical therapy
open. A team of cardiologists,
cardiac surgeons, and social
worker Lois Christopherson
evaluates the physical and mental
health of all potential recipients.
According to Cave's technical
presentation, the ideal transplant
patient has had cardiac disease for
less than five years. He does not
have severe liver or kidney disease
and shows no sign of active
infection in the lungs or
elsewhere.
Clinical tests determine the
individual's physical status, but
there are no comparable tests to
measure his mental outlook.
However, Christopherson said
there is nothing mysterious about
the way in which patients
demonstrate "the will to live."
"We ask the patient 'Do you
really feel you want to risk the
operation?' and if he says 'Yes,
because I have young children,' or
'Yes, because I have a daughter I
want to see graduate from
college,' we know that he is highly
motivated," she said.
'Ready To Die'
Shumway explained, "A lot of
people who are deathly sick are
ready to die. It's a mistake to
interfere with the process."
Transplant recipients must
know "exactly what they're going
to do with their lives after the
operation," Christopherson
added. But at the same time, they
have to understand the limitations
of the transplanted heart.
Although twenty-one recipients
are now living, and another five
lived between 21 months and
three and one half years with their
new hearts, others succumbed
during the first three months.
The stability of the patient's
family is also considered in the
selection process, because close
relatives may "undergo more
psychological stresses than the
recipient," said Christopherson.
Families must be able to cope
with the possibility of death in
order to endure the waiting and
hoping.
'Honest With The Patients'
In several cases, she continued,
"very intelligent, thoughtful
families have asked to meet and
talk with Dr. Shumway before
making their final decision to
proceed with the transplant. We're
enormously honest with the
patients and answer all their
questions about survival rates,
risks and their chances of
returning to normal lives."
The desire to help transplant
recipients feel as natural as
possible, and the discovery that
they could withstand successfully
the strain of the operation, led the
transplant team to discard the
regular psychiatric care which
formerly played an integral role in
post-operative treatment.
"The more things you do to
make the patients feel unusual,
the harder it is for them,"
Shumway said. "If you send
someone to a psychiatrist on a
regular basis, it's a tip-off to them
that you think they're different."
Novelty Lost
As the number of heart
transplants increases, however,
individual transplant patients
begin to lose their novelty. One
indication of this is that some
insurance companies, which will
not pay for "experimental
procedures," will now foot the
bill for heart transplants.
The operation costs
approximately $25,000 for the
first admission. (It may be less if
everything goes well, but,
according to Assistant
Information Officer Gary Cavalli,
the figure may double if
complications arise.) A federal
grant to the medical center helps
defray costs, and the hospital can
lower fees for laboratory and
X-ray studies.
Shumway said that the large

investment on individual patients
has been rewarded by the
extensive scientific knowledge
that has ensued from the
operation. You have to specialize
in order to accomplish anything,
he said, if "you try to take in the
whole picture you'll never get
anything done."
Contributions
Heart transplants have
contributed primarily to the fields
of immunology and physiology.
"One of the outstanding things
we've learned," said Shumway, "is
that rejection is episodic."
The rejection problem remains
the most important obstacle to
successful heart transplantation.
The human body, like that of all
mammals, has a complicated
defense system (composed of
white blood cells and antibodies),
designed to recognize and
eliminate foreign proteins from
the body. Unfortunately, the
recipient's body recognizes the
new heart as foreign tissue and
attempts to destroy it.
Inhibit Rejection
Transplant recipients generally
receive a variety of
immunosuppressive drugs which
inhibit their immune response.
But suppressing the white cells
can leave the patient without
adequate defenses against
infection, because these cells are
responsible for destroying harmful
bacteria and fungi.
The majority of Stanford
patients who have died following

transplantation succumbed to
infection following high doses of
immunosuppressive drugs which
were needed to combat repeated
acute rejection episodes.
From careful monitoring of
living recipients, the Stanford
surgical team has learned that the
threat to the graft "becomes less
and less as time goes by,"
Shumway said. The patient is in
the most danger during the first
several months following the
operation.
Survival Chances
"A patient who lives for three
months has a 75 percent chance
of living a year," explained
Shunway. "If he lives a year he
has a 68 percent chance of living
two years. The patient and the
heart get used to each other."
Even when the threat of
rejection is acute, he added, the
heart "isn't under constant
barrage. There are hills and
valleys, the graft lives peacefully
for a while and then the body
assaults it."
The episodic nature of the
rejection phenomena is currently
being studied in the Stanford labs,
but its practical implications have
already been put into effect.
Reduced Doses
During periods in which there
ary no signs of rejection, the
patient receives a reduced dose of
immunosuppressive drugs. He is
able to maintain a functioning
defense system to fight off
infection.

HEADING THE TEAM — Dr. Norman Shumway (fifth from left) heads up a medical center team involved in open heart surgery. Shumway is
recognized throughout the world as one of the pioneers in heart transplants. He performed the first human heart transplant in the United States
in 1968. His first transplant, involving a dog, took place in 1959.
