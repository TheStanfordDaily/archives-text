# Heart Transplant Program Continues To Thrive

Human heart transplants at
Stanford Medical Center now generate
less commotion than emergency
appendectomies. Five years ago, 150
reporters slept in the hospital corridors
for two weeks awaiting news of the
first Stanford heart transplant.
Although the excitement has
diminished, the transplant program is
thriving. As an increasing number of
patients recover from surgery and
return to active normal lives, the
transplantation team discovers new
factors that make the difference
between survival and failure.
"We're still learning so much," said
Dr. Norman Shumway, the surgeon
responsible for the unique
combination of experimental
competence and clinical expertise that
makes the Stanford program a success.
In an interview in early March,
Shumway, who had been operating
since 3 a.m. and still wore the light
blue surgeons' garb hanging loosely
about his six-foot frame, took time to
discuss the importance of heart
transplantation in terms of both
human lives and new knowledge for
science.
Stanford is the only medical center
that is still performing heart

transplants on a regular basis. The
team averages about one per month.
After the first dramatic operation
accomplished by Christiaan Barnard in
South Africa on December 3, 1967,
surgical teams in 21 countries plunged
into heart transplantation; but poor
survival rates and technical difficulties
slowly extinguished the initial
enthusiasm.
"I think the big problem was that it
was originally felt the operation was
the be-all and end-all for patients with
coronary heart disease," Shumway
said. "But it didn't turn out to be the
unmixed blessing everybody had
hoped for.
"So it swung from great acceptance
to, if you'll pardon the expression,
utter rejection. Now only those who
had the background in experimental
work are still doing it,"he added.
Shumway has been in the
transplant business for almost 15
years. In 1959 he reported to the
Sixth International Transplantation
Conference that he and a colleague,
Dr. Richard Lower, now on the
faculty of the Medical College of
Virginia, had taken the heart from one
dog and put it into the body of
another. The animal lived for eight
days, but over the next six years
Shumway and his associates refined

their techniques, achieving survival
rates for dogs of 60 to 70 percent.
In 1968 Shumway performed the
first human adult transplant in the
United States, using the same surgical
procedures developed during the dog
transplants. Since that time, 56
Stanford patients have received 58
new hearts. (Two patients required a
second transplant after the first
failed.) Post-doctoral fellow Philip K.
Caves reported at the Society of
University Surgeons meeting in
February that Stanford's one-year
survival rates "have steadily improved
from 22 percent in 1968 to 50 percent
in 1970 and 1971."
This improvement reflects the
growing experience in patient selection
and treatment techniques that
Shumway's team has accumulated
through careful monitoring of
transplant recipients and other
terminally ill heart patients.
"People seem to think that there
are thousands of individuals in this
country waiting for transplants," said
the head of the division of
cardiovascular surgery, "but that's not
the case. There are so many
conventional treatments, that the
patient who needs a heart transplant is
very rare."

Shumway has earned national recognition for his 58 heart transplants at the
Medical Center. Stanford is the only medical center in the world which performs
heart transplants on a regular basis.
