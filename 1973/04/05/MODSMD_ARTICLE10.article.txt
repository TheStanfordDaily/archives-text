## The
						Realities Of Kennedy's Presidency 
### 
Bill Evers

If one talks to undergraduates
or to professors at a school like
Stanford about the Presidency of
John F. Kennedy, one learns that
for the majority there is still the
aura of Camelot and a nostalgia
for a time of grandeur.
Gradually, however, from new
information, analysis, and
evaluation, the truth about the
Kennedy administration is
emerging. As Henry Fairlie points
out in his new book, The
Kennedy Promise, in the
Presidential campaign of 1960,
Kennedy "was already pulling the
country onto tiptoe; summoning
it to confront great dangers, on
the one hand, and to expect great
deeds, on the other; teaching it to
prepare for a strenuous adventure

m which a single ruler would lead
it with a united purpose. .. . His
real concern (was) the exaltation
of the power of the state."
Two important episodes during
the Kennedy administration—the
Cuban missile crisis and the war in
Indochina—reveal what Kennedy's
style and viewpoint meant in
practice.
Due at the Brink
Khrushchev's placing of
missiles in Cuba was perhaps
tactically unwise, though
apparently based on genuine fear
that Kennedy would attempt
another Bay of Pigs-type invasion
of the island.
But the missiles represented no
additional physical threat to the
United States. In McNamara's
words at the time, "a missile is a
missile," and the Soviet Union
already had numerous
intercontinental missiles which
could strike the United States.
As Theodore Sorensen
emphasizes in Kennedy, what
counted was the appearance of a
change in the relative strategic
strengths of the two superpowers.
People might believe that the
Soviet Union was stronger than
the United States.
The best recent summary of
how Kennedy handled the missile
crisis is in Richard J. Whalton's
book on Kennedy's foreign
policy:
"It is difficult to escape the
conclusion that, as with Berlin, he
deliberately built up the crisis,
possibly to influence the
elections, possibly to force the
showdown with Khrushchev that
he had long thought might be
necessary.
"He gambled when there were
too many unpredictable things
that could have gone fatally
wrong. His public and surprise
ultimatum to Khrushchev risked
nuclear war and, because it was
wholly unnecessary, risked it to a
degree beyond forgiveness.
"Clearly, however great his
reluctance, Kennedy did seem, on
the evidence of his friends, more
willing than Khrushchev to take
that last fatal step."
Commitment in Vietnam
Hedrick Smith, who wrote the
chapter on the Kennedy years in
the New York Times edition of
the Pentagon Papers, says the
historians who wrote the
Pentagon study concluded that
Kennedy had "transformed the
'limited-risk gamble' of the
Eisenhower administration into a
'broad commitment' to prevent
Communist domination of South
Vietnam."
In an account of the war by
the Institute for Policy Studies,
Ralph L. Stavins points out that
Kennedy himself was quite
directly in control of the
escalation of U.S. military
involvement. Kennedy created
several new agencies like the
Special Group for
Counter-Insurgency to execute
foreign policy. The new agencies
constituted, in Stavins' words, "an
expansion of the war-making
powers of the Executive to a
degree never before contemplated
in the history of the Republic.
For the first time, total command
over the several national security
agencies was concentrated in the
office of the President."
JFK & Withdrawal
Many people who admired
President Kennedy and many of
those who hope Edward Kennedy
will one day be elected President,
believe that if John Kennedy had
lived, he would have withdrawn
from Vietnam during his second
term in office. It is, of course,
impossible to know what might
have happened, but one can get
the flavor of Kennedy's cold war
attitudes in a statement he made

in a nationwide television
interview shortly before he was
assassinated.
Kennedy was asked whether
the United States was likely to
reduce its aid to South Vietnam.
He answered:
"What I am concerned about is
that Americans will get impatient
and say, because they don't like
events in Southeast Asia or they

don't like the Government in
Saigon, that we should withdraw.
That only makes it easy for the
communists. I think we should
stay. We should use our influence
in as effective a way as we can,
but we should not withdraw."
Kennedy's statement sounds
remarkably like what 6ne might
expect from Lyndon Johnson or
Richard Nixon. But this only

serves to underscore the fact that
Kennedy also participated with
vigor in the effort to secure and
maintain American global
hegemony.
