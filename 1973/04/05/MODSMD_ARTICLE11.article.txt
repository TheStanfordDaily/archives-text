Distortions
Editor,
I would like to clear up several
distortions in a leaflet circulated
recently by ASSU Council of
Presidents candidates Van Petten,
Anderson, Flohr and Schott.
First, Peter Van Petten claims
he has been active in fighting to
obtain funding for the ASSU
Course Review. He may have
made a slight effort to do that at
one time, but I, as a co-editor of
the Course Review, can testify
that his involvement with the
Course Review has been minimal.
This lack of involvement is not his
fault, since the Course Review was
put under the jurisdiction of
ASSU Co-President Brent Appel
who has worked extensively with
us—but at the same time I feel
Van Petten is stretching the truth
to list involvement with the
Course Review as one of his
accomplishments.
Second, both Van Petten and
Buck Schott are perhaps justified
in taking credit for organizing the
ASSU Speakers Bureau, but it is
certainly a distortion to claim
credit for bringing Daniel Ellsberg,
Ramsey Clark, William F. Buckley
Jr. and I. F. Stone here.
All of the arrangements for
bringing Ellsberg and Clark here
were made by SCOPE (the
Stanford Committee on Political
Education)—an organization
co-founded by Kevin O'Grady
who is running on a slate opposing
Van Petten's for Council of
Presidents. If anyone were to take
credit for bringing Ellsberg and
Clark here, certainly O'Grady
played a far more important role
than Van Petten.
Similarly, the scheduled
appearance of William F. Buckley
Jr. was arranged by the Stanford
Conservative Forum,
independently of the Speakers
Bureau. And the scheduled speech
by journalist I.F. Stone was set up
by Brent Appel and Daily
Opinions Editor Dan Brenner.
The ASSU Speakers Bureau
can only legitimately claim credit
for the scheduled appearance of
author Tom Wolfe. In all of the
other cases, the Speakers Bureau
did nothing more than help fund
the speakers after all of the
arrangements had been made by
other people! Thus Van Petten
and company can only claim
credit for doling out the students'
money—which takes very little
talent—and it should be stressed
that all of the work was done by
others.
These are obvious distortions
and attempts to take credit for
events which Van Petten,
Anderson, Flohr and Schott had
little or nothing to do with. Since
I am involved both with the
Course Review and with SCOPE, I
could not let these
misrepresentations go by
unanswered.

Harvey Lay-Off
Editor:
I have spent five years at
Stanford Medical School being
trained by a profession whose
primary goal is to care for other
human beings. I am thus
extremely disturbed by the
abolishment of Julia Harvey's
employment after 25 years of
continuous work in Stanford
laboratories. She has been
earnestly consoled by countless
deans, administrators, and faculty
members. They all sumpathize
with her individually—and I
believe sincerely—yet as a whole
they are too busy collectively
fighting disease and unhappiness
in the abstract world of their
laboratories and offices, too busy
to do anything about the very
non-abstract plight of their own
co-worker. And so after 25 years
Julia will be laid off, presumably
to feed herself and her husband
on the condolences of those
genuinely well-intentioned
administrators who "just don't see
what else can be done."
It is ironic that after five years
faculty get tenure, while after 25
years their non-doctoral
co-workers get laid off. I realize
that government funding for
health care has been drastically
cut back. But tenure for M.D.'s
and Ph.D.'s with no job security
whatever for other employees
presupposes an innately superior
value in the former class of
people.
And so when action must take
precedent over words, an
institution dedicated to working
in behalf of humanity
demonstrates that it really has

little concern for its own people. I
am saddened by the education
Stanford Medical School has given
me in caring about the welfare of
other human beings.

Cultural Foods
I still haven't fully grasped the
implications of the remarks in the
Daily (March 8, 1973) concerning
the attempts of Food Service to
serve cultural foods in theme
houses. A dichotomy exists:
between "giving them something
they are used to" and the
acceptance on their part of
something they desire. There are
serious doubts that one soul food
item, tortillas in Casa Zapata, and
rice in Junipero make the grade as
a culturally satisfying meal.
Granted, the food service has
taken serious steps toward
meeting the dietary needs of
minority students. However, these
items (rice, tortillas, and collard
greens) don't make the meal.
I recommend that Food
Service consider hiring a dietician
familiar with the particular eating
customs of each theme house to
alleviate the problem of Food
Service attempts to second-guess
students.
Not only are minorities'
students interested in cultural
dishes. I'm led to believe that a
sizable number of students not
familiar with such dishes are very
interested in trying other foods.
Such changes would be well
received. Enough food for
thought.
