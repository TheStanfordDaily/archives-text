# Boyd Named Associate Dean For Educational Services
## 
### 
Harold K. Boyd has been promoted to associate
dean for student affairs here, where he will head a
new special educational services unit, according to
James W. Lyons, dean of student affairs.
According to Lyons, the new unit has been
organized to serve individuals and groups with
special needs. "Some of these may be transitory,
such as orientation, to improve specific skills needed
for good scholarship, or to get out of serious
academic trouble," he explains.
"Other needs may not be so transitory and may
grow out of a student's personal situation, such as
being blind, physically handicapped, or coming
from a social, economic, or ethnic background that
did not fully equip the student to cope with the
social or academic environment at Stanford."
Special advice about leaves of absence or
prospective return to the University may also
involve the new unit.
Boyd has served as assistant dean of students
since coming here in 1969. He initially had specific
advising responsibilities for minority students. More
recently, his job has been broadened to include
liaison with the Registrar's Office on matters of

academic standing and advising all students on
matters of academic petition.
A former official with the Upward Bound
program of the Office of Economic Opportunity in
Washington, D.C., Boyd is a graduate of St.
Augustine College, Raleigh, N.C., and holds a
master's degree in history from North Carolina
Central University, Durham.
He was a public school teacher for 12 years
before joining the staff of Educational Associates in
Washington. He is married and the father of two
sons.
