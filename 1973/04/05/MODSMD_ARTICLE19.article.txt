# Elvin Bishop Plays 'Good-Time' Music
## 
### JAY HARLOW 
Everybody needs to party at the end of Dead Week. So ASSU
Special Events celebrated the end of the quarter with a concert by the
Elvin Bishop band in Mem Aud March 17.
However, before Bishop and his band played, we heard the
Mendocino All Stars. The guitarist and organist were both good and
might go somewhere with a good band. As for the rest of the band, I
will arrange to be out of town the next time they play.
The horn section included one man on saxes and another on
trumpet, valve trombone, and maybe something else (I forget), and
rarely added anything memorable. The bassist and drummer were
equally forgettable. The lead singer was, according to the drummer,
the author of one of the real heavies of the '60's, "The Monster
Mash." I think that was his crowning achievement.
Muddied Instrumental
He managed to muddy most of the instrumentals with tambourine
or cowbell, and seemed to think that nobody would notice another
player's solo unless he stood right next to him to point him out. I
could go on, but let's just call it, in the promoters' language, "Local
band exposure." (Anyone wishing further details about this band can
send me a stamped self-addressed envelope c/o this paper.)
When Elvin Bishop came on, everyone got down to business,
namely having a good time. Bishop is a fine guitarist, and played with
the Paul Butterfield Blues Band before forming this band. Backed up
by a bunch of very able musicians, he is now putting out a lot of
good-time, foot-stomping, hip-shaking music.
The set began with one of their best known tunes, "So Fine," with
help from Jo Baker and Ross Hayashida on vocals. Ricky Kellogg,
who joined the band last year, added some excellent blues harp on
this and most of the rest of their tunes.
Lead vocals were shared freely, with bass player Mike Larshied
singing a new song, "Sure Feels Good," and "Need Your Loving Every
Day" sung by organist Steve Miller (not to be confused with the more
famous Steve Miller, a guitarist). Jo Baker sang one beautiful blues,
"Fly Away."
She can stand a foot and a half back from the mike and come
through as clearly as most singers up much closer. Bishop
demonstrated his skill on the guitar often, but especially on one long
talking blues, a story about himself, his old lady, another man, and his
conscience.
The last two numbers were "Rock Bottom" and "Boogie 'Til the
Rooster Crows." This last number is the type of feeling Bishop tries to
create with every concert, with the chorus "We're gonna boogie 'til
the rooster crows, we're gonna party 'til the cows come home." And
everybody there, both in the crowd and on the stage, seemed to get
the feeling.
