# Police Deputization Plans Finalized

### BILL WEINSTEIN 
Stanford will employ about 30
deputized patrolmen, who will
exercise the same legal powers as
regular Sheriff's deputies or
policemen, by September, Director of
Public Safety Marvin Herrington said
yesterday.
The University has begun
advertising and recruiting for the
deputized positions, and will select
and train them in the next six months.
Herrington had originaJly planned
to have deputized officers by
September 1972, but labor disputes,
legal questions about the validity of
the deputization plan, and discussions
with the Sheriff delayed deputization.
The Sheriff will commission some
Stanford patrolmen as reserve deputies
under a "memorandum of
understanding" signed in March 1972.
The memorandum requires that the
reservists meet the same standards as
regular deputies.
Reserve Deputies
Stanford will pay and command the
reserve deputies, but the Sheriff will
review their qualifications and
performance. Stanford patrolmen now
possess the same legal powers as
private security guards.
Herrington has reorganized his
department into two divisions in
anticipation of deputization. He plans
to expand from the current 45
employees to about 65, evenly divided
between deputies and "Community
Service Officers" or foot patrolmen.
Community Service Officers (CSO)
wear blue blazers and grey slacks.
They do not carry weapons, and work
at traffic and parking enforcement
during the day and patrol in scooters
at night.
Herrington said he has not decided
on a uniform for deputized patrolmen,
but indicated that it would resemble
the present deputy's uniform.
Labor disputes stalled Herrington's
reorganization for several months
when the Stanford Department of

Public Safety Officers Association
(SDPSOA) challenged the plan.
Threatened Strike
SDPSOA spokesmen threatened a
strike, criticized the demotion of
many officers from mobile to foot
patrol positions, and opposed the
different wage scales for deputized and
community service positions.
CSO's receive $659 to $780 per
month, while reserve deputies will
receive $888 to $1132. Herrington
argues that deputized patrolmen must
have a college degree or the equivalent,
necessitating higher pay. "The job is
complex and I want people who are
qualified," he said.
Albert King, current president of
the SDPSOA, calls Herrington's
distinction between the positions

"semantics," and claims that pay
scales should be closer and fringe
benefits better. "The University thinks
we have the same chance of being ill or
hurt as a secretary. It's ridiculous," he
said.
College Requirements
King also vigorously opposes the
college degree requirement because it
will exclude many current employees
from promotion and fringe benefits.
"Because a man holds a piece of
paper from college does not mean he's
more intelligent. The degree-holders
and non-degree holders both deserve
equal retirement benefits. They are
both human beings," he contended.
After deputization is implemented,
Stanford officers will investigate

misdemeanors committed on campus,
while regular deputies will investigate
thefts of more than $1000 and all
other felonies.
Undersheriff Tom Rosa has praised
the Stanford reorganization and
deputization, stating that it has
prevented crime and eased the costs of
campus law enforcement the county
bears.
He says reserve deputies employed
oy Stanford can patrol the campus
more effectively than the limited
manpower the Sheriff can provide.
Although the Sheriff will still patrol
the North County area, which includes
the campus, detectives will be the only
officers assigned primarily to Stanford
after deputization, according to Rosa.
