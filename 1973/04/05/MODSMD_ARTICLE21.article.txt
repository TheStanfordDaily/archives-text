# Comedian Brooks Performs At Boarding House In S.F.
## 
### DAN FORTE 
I can't remember when I've
laughed as hard as I did on
Saturday, March 24, at The
Boarding House in San Francisco.
The reason was a young comedian
named Albert Brooks.
Brooks did three shows
Saturday night of his five-night
engagement, and I was fortunate
enough to see all three, (and only
have to pay for two of them).
Every show made me laugh so
hard my eyes were watering, my
side was aching, and I even had a
headache.
Albert Brooks is a relatively
obscure name to most. H e ' s
appeared on the Tonight Show
several times, and a few other T.V.
shows, but a lot of his material
either can't be done on television
or doesn't come off as well as it
does in person. His brother, Bob
Einstein, was Officer Judy on the
Smothers Comedy Brothers Hour.
(Brooks' real name is Albert
Einstein.)
On Saturday night Brooks' first
two shows were nearly identical,
but his jokes and routines made
me laugh even the second time
through. Brooks has a strange
sense of humor, and is easily one

of the most original stand-up
comedians around. He's the only
person I've seen that does Jack
LaLanne's voice.
Unbelievable Timing
During his act, Brooks would
sometimes use a cassette tape
player for certain bits. His timing
with the cassette was
unbelievable.
Brooks works mainly with
ideas, rather than with set jokes
and routines. Even his set routines
just sort of worked around an
idea. His best routine, which he
used in all three shows, was on the
rewriting of America's national
anthem. Brooks played piano, and
played the part of all the people
being auditioned.
During the third show Brooks
was confronted by the worst
possible situation for a comedian,
two drunk hecklers. Brooks
handled it fantastically. First he
asked them what their names
were; one answered Fred. He then
announced, "Congratulations
Fred, you're my 1000 th heckler,"
and ran into the audience to shake
his hand.
Later, when the two still
hadn't shut up, Brooks brought
the two on stage and let them

make complete fools of
themselves, while he delivered
some beautiful insults. ("What do
you do, Frank? Do you go to
school, or do you just... eat
dirt?")
Weil-Known Routine
For his final bit, Brooks did his
most well-known routine, Danny
and Dave, a ventriloquist-dummy
team. Brooks is not a ventriloquist
and doesn't even try to be, which
is why this bit is so funny. Brooks
did such things as pour a glass of
water down the dummy's throat
while he (Brooks) sang a song.
When the drunks still wouldn't
quiet down, the dummy, Danny,
shouted, "I've never said this to
anyone before,, but fuck you!"
Everyone in the crowd nearly fell
out of their seats.
The audience tried to bring
Brooks back for more, but he
came out only to explain that
he'd rather not, under the
circumstances. I don't blame him.
Bill Shared
Sharing the bill with Brooks
was folk singer-guitarist Kenny
Rankin.
His repertoire included
originals, such as "Catfish,"
"String Man," "Comin' Down,"

and "Peaceful" (currently a hit by
Helen Reddy); and Rankin
arrangements of Stevie Wonder's
"You Are The Sunshine of My
Life," Steve Stills' "Four Days
Gone," and Bill Preston's "I
Wrote A Simple Song."
Rankin's best number of the
night was George Harrison's
"While My Guitar Gently Weeps."
Throughout the evening he was
accompanied by Peter Marshall, a
very talented string bassist.

unbelievable.
Brooks works mainly with
ideas, rather than with set jokes
and routines. Even his set routines
just sort of worked around an
idea. His best routine, which he
used in all three shows, was on the
rewriting of America's national
anthem. Brooks played piano, and
played the part of all the people
being auditioned.
During the third show Brooks
was confronted by the worst
possible situation for a comedian,
two drunk hecklers. Brooks
handled it fantastically. First he
asked them what their names
were; one answered Fred. He then
announced, "Congratulations
Fred, you're my 1000 th heckler,"
and ran into the audience to shake
his hand.
Later, when the two still
hadn't shut up, Brooks brought
the two on stage and let them

make complete fools of
themselves, while he delivered
some beautiful insults. ("What do
you do, Frank? Do you go to
school, or do you just... eat
dirt?")
Weil-Known Routine
For his final bit, Brooks did his
most well-known routine, Danny
and Dave, a ventriloquist-dummy
team. Brooks is not a ventriloquist
and doesn't even try to be, which
is why this bit is so funny. Brooks
did such things as pour a glass of
water down the dummy's throat
while he (Brooks) sang a song.
When the drunks still wouldn't
quiet down, the dummy, Danny,
shouted, "I've never said this to
anyone before,, but fuck you!"
Everyone in the crowd nearly fell
out of their seats.
The audience tried to bring
Brooks back for more, but he
came out only to explain that
he'd rather not, under the
circumstances. I don't blame him.
Bill Shared
Sharing the bill with Brooks
was folk singer-guitarist Kenny
Rankin.
His repertoire included
originals, such as "Catfish,"
"String Man," "Comin' Down,"

and "Peaceful" (currently a hit by
Helen Reddy); and Rankin
arrangements of Stevie Wonder's
"You Are The Sunshine of My
Life," Steve Stills' "Four Days
Gone," and Bill Preston's "I
Wrote A Simple Song."
Rankin's best number of the
night was George Harrison's
"While My Guitar Gently Weeps."
Throughout the evening he was
accompanied by Peter Marshall, a
very talented string bassist.

ANNIVERSARY CELEBRATION — Le Treteau de Paris presents here the great Moliere farce "Le
Medecin Malgre Lui" in celebration of the Moliere 300 th anniversary. Shown above are (Left to Right)
Michel Baumann (Geronte) Elizabeth Margoni (Jacqueline) and Yves Ferry (Lucas). The performance will
be at 8 (in French) at Memorial Auditorium. Tickets are $3.50, $4.50 and $2.50 for students with a
possible student rush at $2.
I can't remember when I've
laughed as hard as I did on
Saturday, March 24, at The
Boarding House in San Francisco.
The reason was a young comedian
named Albert Brooks.
Brooks did three shows
Saturday night of his five-night
engagement, and I was fortunate
enough to see all three, (and only
have to pay for two of them).
Every show made me laugh so
hard my eyes were watering, my
side was aching, and I even had a
headache.
Albert Brooks is a relatively
obscure name to most. H e ' s
appeared on the Tonight Show
several times, and a few other T.V.
shows, but a lot of his material
either can't be done on television
or doesn't come off as well as it
does in person. His brother, Bob
Einstein, was Officer Judy on the
Smothers Comedy Brothers Hour.
(Brooks' real name is Albert
Einstein.)
On Saturday night Brooks' first
two shows were nearly identical,
but his jokes and routines made
me laugh even the second time
through. Brooks has a strange
sense of humor, and is easily one

of the most original stand-up
comedians around. He's the only
person I've seen that does Jack
LaLanne's voice.
Unbelievable Timing
During his act, Brooks would
sometimes use a cassette tape
player for certain bits. His timing
with the cassette was
unbelievable.
Brooks works mainly with
ideas, rather than with set jokes
and routines. Even his set routines
just sort of worked around an
