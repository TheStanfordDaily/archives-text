# Pass, Ellis Give Fine Show
## 
### DAN FORTE 
On Saturday, March 31, two of
the world's most outstanding jazz
guitarists gave a joint concert at
The Great American Music Hall in
San Francisco. Joe Pass and Herb
Ellis put on a very impressive
display of guitar virtuosity.
The two played four sets
lasting a total of four hours. Their
repertoire included many jazz
standards, starting out with Duke
Ellington's "Perdido." As on most
of their songs, this one started out
with the two guitars playing
alone, first one playing lead with
the other backing him up, then
vice-versa. The introduction lasted
a fairly long time before the bass
and drums joined in.
Ellis and Pass blended together
beautifully and complimented
each other perfectly, but each had
a definite, distinct style so it was
easy to tell who was playing what.
I found Pass' style to be more to
my liking, especially on the more
upbeat numbers where the
influence of bebop became quite
noticeable.
Pass seems to get a lot of his

phrasing from the late guitarist
Charlie Christian (who used to
play with Benny Goodman), and
the late Lester Young, who was
one of the best tenor saxophonists
of the Swing Era. Pass' tone was
the best I've ever heard from an
electric guitar.
Both guitarists would
sometimes play solo pieces with
the other guitarist leaving the
stage. For these numbers, both
chose to stick to slow ballads; Pass
played "I Remember April," a
medley of "Misty" (written by
Errol Garner) and Billie Holiday's

"Lover Man," and another
Ellington piece, "Prelude To A
Kiss," Ellis played a nice blues
arrangement of "My Old Flame."
But, the highlights of the
evening came on the faster
numbers that the two played
together. Ellis really shined on
Cole Porter's "Love For Sale,"
and Charlie Christian's "Seven
Come Eleven." Pass played
especially well on "Indiana" and
Charlie Barnet's "Cherokee." But,
both played extremely well on
every number, whether they were
playing lead or rhythm.

The two sideman playing with
Pass and Ellis were Dean Riley on
bass, and Benny Barth on drums.
Both were very competent and
followed the two guitars
perfectly.
Pass and Ellis obviously enjoy
each other's playing and often get
together between their own
separate engagements with other
bands. The two are scheduled to
appear together at this year's Bay
Area Jazz Festival in June. Also,
an album featuring Pass and Ellis
together is due to be released
soon.
