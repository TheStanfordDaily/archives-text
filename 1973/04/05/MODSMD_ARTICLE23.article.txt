Committee Proposes Rollback
WASHINGTON — Legislation to roll prices, interest
rates and rents back to the levels of Jan. 10, the end
of Phase 2, was approved last night by the House
Banking Committee.
The measure directly challenges President Nixon
on the economic controls issue and is headed for a
House floor fight, probably about April 17.
After beating down propositions for a limited
freeze and an opportunity for Nixon to present
another program, the committee ended an 11-hour
session by voting 21 to 9, largely along party lines,
to send the measure to the House.
Nixon wants only an extension of his
discretionary control powers, which expire April 30.
Democrats, denouncing his Phase 3 program as a
failure, are insisting on writing stiff standards.
Ervin Clears Haldeman
WASHINGTON - The Senate Watergate
investigating committee said yesterday that "as of
this time it has received no evidence of any nature"
linking White House chief of staff H.R. Haldeman to
political spying.
Sens. Sam J. Ervin Jr. (D-N.C.), and Howard H.
Baker (R-Tenn.), the committee heads, said they
were concerned with news accounts said to have
come from committee sources "inferring that Mr.
H.R. Haldeman was involved in the break-in and
bugging of the Democratic National Committee
Headquarters at the Watergate ..
"In the interest of fairness and justice the
committee wishes to state publicly that, as of this
time, it has received no evidence of any nature
linking Mr. Haldeman with any illegal activities in
connection with the presidential campaign of
1972," the statement said.
Haldeman was called on to resign Tuesday by
Sen. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. (R-Conn.), one of the
three GOP members of the seven-member panel.
He told newsmen that some of those whose
involvement in the case is known have said "we just
didn't do anything without checking with Mr.
Haldeman."
Meanwhile, Atty. Gen. Richard G. Kleindienst
disputed Ervin's claim that the Senate could have
presidential aides arrested for refusing to testify in
the Watergate affair.
". .. could Sen. Ervin arrest the President of the
United States if the President of the United States
refused to appear before his committee?"
Kleindienst asked.
"I think we would all say 'no,' he could not," he
said. He also said there are those who are pressing
the case to incorrect conclusions.
Farmers Hold Back Cattle
MEMPHIS, TENN. — Farmers kept their cattle away
from market and consumers kept their shopping
carts away from the meat counter yesterday, the
fourt 1 - 4 ay of the week-long meat boycott.
/ - j. Department of Agriculture spokesman in
Memphis, Tenn., said receipts were "well below
normal for hogs and cattle both"; only half as many
cattle were delivered to the Union Stock Yard in
Portland, Ore., this Monday and Tuesday as were
available the same days last week.
Retailers and wholesalers said business was down,
but there was no clear picture of whether prices
were lower.

A staff report of the Joint Economic Committee
of Congress, predicted that grocery store prices
would go up 10 percent this year — and possibly
more under certain circumstances.
The study, released by Sen. Hubert H. Humphrey
(D-Minn.), disagreed with a report of the Nixon
administration's Cost of Living Council which said
the rate of increase in food prices may be near zero
by the end of the year.
Brandt To Meet Nixon
BONN, Germany — Chancellor Willy Brandt will
meet President Nixon in Washington early next
month to stress West Germany's continued loyalty
to the Western alliance shortly before the Soviet
Union's party chief Leonid I. Brezhnev pays a visit
here.
Brandt will assure Nixon "with all urgency" that
German-American friendship remains unchanged
and is supported by the great majority of West
Germans, Brandt's Social Democratic party said
yesterday.
The surprise announcement of the summit came
shortly after the opposition party charged that
Brandt has failed to suppress alleged
anti-Americanism in his party.
A Bonn government spokesman said Brandt and
Nixon would discuss U.S.-German relations,
U.S.-European trade, monetary issues and North
Atlantic Treaty Organization questions including
forthcoming East-West talks on security and troop
reductions in Europe.
A statement issued by Brandt's Social
Democratic party said the Brandt-Nixon discussion
is taking place at the invitation of the American
president.
The announcement of Brandt's trip to
Washington came less than a week before the
opening of a conference of Brandt's party at which
its militant left wing is expected to press demands
for a U.S. troop pullout from Germany.
The leftists, who are critical of U.S. policy, also
demand cancellation of Bonn's payments to help
offset the U.S. cost of stationing the 200,000 troops
here.
Communists Respond To POW s
SAIGON — North Vietnam and the Viet Cong said
yesterday torture stories from former American war
prisoners threaten to interfere with return of the
bodies of prisoners who died in captivity and the
search for U.S. servicemen listed as missing.
American officials tended to play down the
statement in the belief that the Communists made
their statement more "for the record" than as a
sincere indication of their plans.
The Communist warning came at the first formal
meeting of the four-party military team charged
with accounting for hundreds of missing Americans
and with recovery of the remains of those killed in
action or who died while held prisoner.
The North Vietnamese and Viet Cong delegations
referred to what they called their "humane
treatment" of POWs and protested America's
"distortion" of that policy.
Several former American prisoners have
complained on their return home that they were
beaten, tortured and held for months in solitary
confinement. Hanoi charged before that their
complaints were orchestrated by the U.S.

'Papers' Witness Cites Atrocities
LOS ANGELES — An American who was evicted
from South Vietnam for showing visiting U.S.
congressmen the "tiger cages" in a prison there
testified yesterday at the Pentagon Papers trial in
defense of Daniel Ellsberg and Anthony Russo.
Donald Luce, 38, who lived in South Vietnam
for 13 years as an agricultural aid program
administrator, told jurors about the mistreatment of
South Vietnamese farmers and villagers by their
government — information which he said is related
in the Pentagon Papers. Luce was summoned as a
witness to tell jurors that those segments of the
Pentagon Papers — detailing "pacification" efforts
in the villages — could have been released in 1969
without harm to the U.S. national defense.
Ellsberg, 41, and Russo, 36, are charged with
espionage, conspiracy and theft for copying the
Pentagon's top-secret study of the Vietnam war in
1969. The government contends they endangered
their country by breaking secrecy on the
information.
Magee's Attorney Apologizes
SAN FRANCISCO - Ruchell Magee's
court-appointed defense attorney, Robert D.
Carrow, apologized to Superior Court Judge Morton
R. Colvin yesterday for actions "the court may have
interpreted as disrespectful" during the seven and
one-half week trial which ended in a hung jury
Tuesday.
Judge Colvin had previously cited the lawyer for
two instances of misconduct.
"I have managed to practice law for a good
number of years without being cited for misconduct
or contempt," Carrow said.
On February 22, Carrow said, "This trial is a
joke," during an objection to a prosecution
statement. On March 3 the lawyer ignored an order
to refrain from mentioning possible punishment in
front of jurors.
Magee was accused of kidnaping and murder in
the 1970 Marin courthouse violence in which four
died.
BART Workman Killed
HAYWARD — A workman was killed and dragged
200 yards by a Bay Area Rapid Transit train
yesterday — the futuristic system's first fatality.
"We haven't verified why he was there or why he
got hit," said BART information officer Bob
Kraehe. "We just know he was struck and killed."
An investigation was launched.
He said the train which killed track foreman
Miguel C. Campesana, 48, of Broderick, Calif., was
apparently going about 60 miles an hour — normal
for that portion of the track. The accident occurred
on the right-of-way just south of the Hayward yard.
The only other accident since the $1.5
billion-plus electronic train system opened Sept. 11,
1972, occurred Oct. 2. BART said an improperly
mounted speed-control crystal caused a train to run
off the end of the line into a parking lot at
Fremont, injuring five persons.
