# Fire Dept. Considers Buying New Engines
## 
### 
The Stanford Fire Department has
received non-binding "proposals" for
two new $60,000 fire engines, Chief
Frank Jurian said yesterday.
The University will now review the
proposals, draw final specifications,
and contract a manufacturer to build
the two 2000 gallon per minute
pumpers.
The lowest proposal, from Crown
Company, was $3000 per engine above
the University's budgeted sum, but
Jurian said that the specifications and
costs are negotiable.
Proposals from two other
companies, Seagrave and Van Pelt,
were "very close" to the Crown
estimate, according to the chief.
The University will take delivery of
the engines about a year after it places

its order for the engines. It will then
retire and sell its 20-year-old reserve
engine, which does not pump enough
water to meet insurance standards, and
its 25-year-old rescue unit.
Both old engines are obsolete by
current standards, and have broken
down frequently, sometimes while
responding to calls.
The new engines will resemble the
department's Engine 97, but will have
a roofed cab, a deck gun, a large
pump, and enough seating capacity to
keep firemen from riding the
tailboard.
Jurian has not decided how his
department will respond to rescue calls
after it retires its current rescue unit,
or which engine the fire captain will
ride.
