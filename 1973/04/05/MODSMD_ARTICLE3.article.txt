# Two ASSU Slates Organized; Additional Candidates Expected
## 
### SUE KING 
Although no petitions for the
upcoming ASSU presidential election
have yet been filed, at least two slates
are already campaigning, and at least
three others are being formed.
One active slate includes incumbent
ASSU Vice President Peter Van
Petten, Committee of 15 Chairman
and Sen. Jim Anderson, Sen. Tom
Flohr, and former Sen. Charles
"Buck" Schott. The other announced
slate includes Stanford Committee on
Political Education co-founder Kevin
O'Grady, former Sen. Beth Garfield,
Black Students Union Chairman and
current Sen. Charles Ogletree, and
Stanford McCloskey Campaign
Co-Chairman Jim Friend.
Others who have made tentative
plans to run are ASSU Elections
Commissioner Mike Nilsson; senior

Fred Choate and sophomore John
Kenney, representing the Young
Socialists; and juniors Dave Meyer and
Robert Carlos Garcia.
Nilsson has charged that Van Petten
loaded his slate with his own close
friends, and accused Van Petten of
being "unfair" in choosing his running
mates. Nilsson said he had originally
expected to run with Van Petten, but
Van Petten told the Daily that he and
Nilsson had "talked, but no
agreements were made."
"It's obviously untrue that I chose
my close friends to run with me," said
Van Petten. "I picked the people most
qualified to run for the Council of
Presidents."
Resignation 'Probable'
Nilsson said that because he objects
to both the Van Petten and O'Grady
slates, it is "probable" that he will

submit his resignation as ASSU
elections commissioner at next
Tuesday's Senate meeting, and will run
for the Council of Presidents with an
as-yet unannounced slate.
Representatives of the Young
Socialists Party, Choate and Kenney
say they are planning a campaign
"fighting against reformism in the
present political situation."
Student Services
The main campaign issue at this
point appears to be student services.
The O'Grady slate will not release a
statement on their platform until
Monday, but both Van Petten and
Nilsson emphasized the importance of
focusing the ASSU's attention on the
problems of the students and the
University rather than on broader
national topics.

COFFEE HOUSE RENOVATIONS — Students wait for service at the Stanford Coffee House. An $18,000 remodeling
project, which will include new lighting and acoustics, is scheduled to be completed by the beginning of summer quarter.
Van Petten said that the issue
"should be which group of candidates
will work for the students, not for
themselves or outside interest groups."
Nilsson was more specific, citing
three issues which he thought were
major: voluntary vs. refundable fee
assessments, judicial reform and
student services.
"I don't think students should be
asked to pay for something they don't
want to," he said, explaining why he
supports a "check-off" system

whereby students would mark off the
fees they wanted to pay on a card
during registration. Under the present
"refundable" system, the University
collects fee assessments along with
tuition, and students who object to a
particular assessment are able to
collect a refund. Nilsson also said that
he felt reform of the judicial system
"could be done faster than it is being
done."
Voting for ASSU Council of
Presidents will take place April 18 and
19.
