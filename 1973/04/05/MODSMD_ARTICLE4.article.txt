# Rival Labor Groups Trade Accusations
## 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
Representatives of the two rival
groups seeking to unionize some 1600
University employees traded charges
yesterday about the views of
University President Richard Lyman
and about meetings between their
organizations.
The two groups, United Stanford
Employees (USE), and Stanford Joint
Council (SJC), will both take part in
the unionization election which will
probably be held next month.
In a related matter, USE spokesman
Jack Truher confirmed that the USE
negotiations committee has reached a
tentative agreement calling for
affiliation with the Service Employees
International Union. This accord will
be detailed at a meeting in the
Graduate School of Business tonight at
7:30 p.m., and the entire USE
membership will vote on the proposed
affiliation within one week.
Don Mowery, an International
Union Representative for the
American Federation of State,
County, and Municipal Employees,
speaking for the SJC, charged that
Lyman favored the union slate.
'Erroneous' Leaf letting
Mowery's comment came in light of
a statement Lyman made on KZSU's
"Campus Conference" radio program
Tuesday. Lyman said, "Some of the
Stanford Joint Council's leafletting
was extremely erroneous... They
were trying to make it seem as if
somehow the USE and the University
were combining to keep them off the
ballot. They knew perfectly well they
could get on the ballot by filing a
single card," since the USE previously
filed enough petitions to force an
election, the date for which may be set
tomorrow.
Mowery said the SJC's leafletting
was not erroneous, since, although it is
true the SJC could get onto the ballot
in the upcoming election by filing only
one card, "it takes ten percent [of the
total number of members of the labor
group to be represented] for us to
have any standing at any hearings on
the election.
"We wanted this standing so we can
have quick elections, and we got well
in excess of ten percent," of the more
than 1600 university employees in a
variety of jobs who will be voting in

the election, Mowery said.
"By this statement, it can be
extrapolated that Lyman prefers the
USE, because it is an in-house
organization, to our union, which has
a long history of being an aggressive
organization," Mowery said.
'Lies'
USE President Glenda Jones
strongly denied this charge, saying
"Lyman was making a statement of
fact. He just pointed out their lies. As
far as he [Lyman) supporting us is
concerned, we have caused the
University administration a great
number of problems in recent years.
We have been correcting backwards
conditions and improving wages in the
past four years," by bringing
numerous grievance complaints against
the University.
Mowery also said "The USE
contacted us [the SJC] seeking a local
charter," at meetings held at Uncle
John's Pancake House in Palo Alto.
"However, we do not give out local
charters like popcorn. We have to get
some feeling that USE represents the
feelings of the majority of those in the
labor group," Mowery added.
"They were ready to endorse the
SJC, but we stopped it. They wouldn't
give us any indication of their
membership, we didn't have any idea
of their attendance, and they gave us
no copy of their constitution,"
Mowery charged.
Jones denied that such meetings
described by Mowery had ever taken
place, saying that the USE as an
organization consciously tried to avoid
even going to those meetings of the
SJC.
USE Constitution
Truher said that Mowery's
statement about not getting a copy of
the constitution was completely false,
since the USE "constitution is open
and has even been printed in
newspapers."
He added that the USE has no
official membership list, as it is not an
organized union, but said that he is
confident that "more than half" of the
labor division supports USE.
"These statements show these guys
[the SJC] are running scared. They're
talking about pancakes and popcorn
while we've been discussing the issues
for years," Truher said.

give us any indication of their
membership, we didn't have any idea
of their attendance, and they gave us
no copy of their constitution,"
Mowery charged.
Jones denied that such meetings
described by Mowery had ever taken
place, saying that the USE as an
organization consciously tried to avoid
even going to those meetings of the
SJC.
USE Constitution
Truher said that Mowery's
statement about not getting a copy of
the constitution was completely false,
since the USE "constitution is open
and has even been printed in
newspapers."
He added that the USE has no
official membership list, as it is not an
organized union, but said that he is
confident that "more than half" of the
labor division supports USE.
"These statements show these guys
[the SJC] are running scared. They're
talking about pancakes and popcorn
while we've been discussing the issues
for years," Truher said.
Representatives of the two rival
groups seeking to unionize some 1600
University employees traded charges
yesterday about the views of
University President Richard Lyman
and about meetings between their
organizations.
The two groups, United Stanford
Employees (USE), and Stanford Joint
Council (SJC), will both take part in
the unionization election which will
probably be held next month.
In a related matter, USE spokesman
Jack Truher confirmed that the USE
negotiations committee has reached a
tentative agreement calling for
affiliation with the Service Employees
International Union. This accord will
be detailed at a meeting in the
Graduate School of Business tonight at
7:30 p.m., and the entire USE
membership will vote on the proposed
affiliation within one week.
Don Mowery, an International
Union Representative for the
American Federation of State,
County, and Municipal Employees,
speaking for the SJC, charged that
Lyman favored the union slate.
'Erroneous' Leaf letting
Mowery's comment came in light of
a statement Lyman made on KZSU's
"Campus Conference" radio program
Tuesday. Lyman said, "Some of the
Stanford Joint Council's leafletting
was extremely erroneous... They
were trying to make it seem as if
somehow the USE and the University
were combining to keep them off the
ballot. They knew perfectly well they
could get on the ballot by filing a
single card," since the USE previously
filed enough petitions to force an
election, the date for which may be set
tomorrow.
Mowery said the SJC's leafletting
was not erroneous, since, although it is
true the SJC could get onto the ballot
in the upcoming election by filing only
one card, "it takes ten percent [of the
total number of members of the labor
group to be represented] for us to
have any standing at any hearings on
the election.
"We wanted this standing so we can
have quick elections, and we got well
in excess of ten percent," of the more
than 1600 university employees in a
variety of jobs who will be voting in

the election, Mowery said.
"By this statement, it can be
extrapolated that Lyman prefers the
USE, because it is an in-house
organization, to our union, which has
a long history of being an aggressive
organization," Mowery said.
'Lies'
USE President Glenda Jones
strongly denied this charge, saying
"Lyman was making a statement of
fact. He just pointed out their lies. As
far as he [Lyman) supporting us is
concerned, we have caused the
University administration a great
number of problems in recent years.
We have been correcting backwards
conditions and improving wages in the
past four years," by bringing
numerous grievance complaints against
the University.
Mowery also said "The USE
contacted us [the SJC] seeking a local
charter," at meetings held at Uncle
John's Pancake House in Palo Alto.
"However, we do not give out local
charters like popcorn. We have to get
some feeling that USE represents the
feelings of the majority of those in the
labor group," Mowery added.
"They were ready to endorse the
SJC, but we stopped it. They wouldn't
give us any indication of their
membership, we didn't have any idea
of their attendance, and they gave us
no copy of their constitution,"
Mowery charged.
