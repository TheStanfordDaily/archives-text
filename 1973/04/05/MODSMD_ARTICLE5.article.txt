# New Lighting, Acoustics Highlight Plans To Remodel Coffee House

The Stanford Coffee House management is preparing
an ambitious, $18,000 remodeling project. According to
Manager Ken Brubaker, the remodeling is scheduled to
start June 1, and will involve major structural changes in
the building as well as new lighting and acoustic facilities.
However, he says,"I don't think we're going to change
the character of the place a lot."
The firm of Corff, Koehler and Romberg Associates
has designed the renovation plans and will supervise the
operation. The members of the firm are: Nicholas Corff,
an architect-planner, Bonnie Koehler, an artist designer;
and civil engineer Kenneth Kornberg, who recently
designed and built the new Stanford Observatory. All
three are Stanford graduates.
Brubaker says that the new design will result in greater
efficiency. "We should be able to handle half again as
many people in the same amount of time."
Art Exhibits
The plan calls for a passageway lined with art exhibits,
leading from the entrance facing Dinkelspiel Auditorium
to the rear entrance opening out onto the Tresidder
courtyard. The art gallery/passageway will be floored with
Spanish ceramic tile. In addition, Corff says, some of the
tile will extend outside to create a patio area, and outside
lighting and signs will extend into the interior of the

Coffee House. The idea is to integrate the inside area with
the outdoors.
The area of the Coffee House will expand to include an
eight foot strip of what is now the poolroom. The
additional floor space will allow the management to
change the shape of the service area. The new shape will
allow customers entering from both doors to proceed
directly to the service counters, thus relieving the
problems of congestion and pilferage.
The sound system will also be improved. Brubaker
says, "Hopefully, we'll put in about a $1200 stereo."
They also plan to install four to six speakers at variou.-
points around the room which will replace the present
two. In addition, a new floor covering will absorb sound
better, and the ceiling will be treated with acoustic tile.
New Lighting
The Coffee House management will install "totally new
lighting." Indirect lighting will replace the present direct
overhead lights, and centralized control of the light
system will be instituted. At the same time, people who
desire individual lights for reading at booths or tables will
be able to have them.
The management, according to Brubaker, will
"completely rearrange the seating." The stage will be
moved to a position more in the center of the room.
The Coffee House has been in
operation since October, 1968. Before
then, the space housed a billiards
room. At first, says Brubaker, "the
concept was coffee, tea and doughnuts
â€” that was the whole idea. Then all of
a sudden we expanded, not having
enough money to remodel properly."
Brubaker envisions "a week that's
totally dedicated to a grand opening"
at the beginning of summer quarter.
He plans to show some of the popular
music acts that have appeared there in
the past and to hold an art exhibit in
the new passageway.
All in all, he says, "We're very
excited about the possibilities."
