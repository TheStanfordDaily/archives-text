# Counseling Ends
## The 						Draft Goes On 
### 
Peter Hanatcall

As of the beginning of spring
quarter, the Special Services
Office will no longer be open on a
daily basis for drop-in draft
counseling and information. The
January 27th announcement of
no further draft calls has
predictably reduced the
counseling load to below that
needed to sustain a special office
and counselor.
Despite the end of draft calls,
there appears to be no end in sight
for the draft law and Selective
Service System. People with
draft-related questions and
problems can still get answers and
referrals, although not extensive
draft counseling, in the Student
Affairs Office.
Certification
Requested student
certifications for 2-S deferments
(now being phased out) and 2-M
medical school deferments should
drop to a low level by the end of
1973 if there are no further draft
calls, as expected.
The reason for this is that no
lottery numbers would be reached
in the 1973 Lottery Pool.
Therefore, all men 20 and older
would be well advised to drop
their deferments and enter the
pool by the end of the year. As a
result, they would enter the
Second Priority Group in January
of 1974, and be virtually safe
from inductionâ€”even if draft calls
were later resumed.
Students who nonetheless want
certification mailed to their draft

boards between now and the end
of the year can go to the Special
Educational Services Office on the
3rd floor of the Old Union.
Medical students can go to the
Student Affairs Office at the
Medical School.
System Continues
The end of draft calls is not
equivalent to the end of the draft.
Only one sentence of the draft
law expires on June 30, 1973: the
one giving the President the
authority to induct. Otherwise,
the Selective Service System
continues indefinitely.
Byron Pepitone, Acting
Director of Selective Service,
indicates "no plans for an
extension of the general induction
authority after ... July 1,
1973 .. . [but] we visualize a full
range of activities as prescribed in
the Military Selective Service Act
as it continues beyond June 30
with the exception of active
inductions and examinations.
Registration and classification of
eligible young men will continue
as required by law."
The legal penalty for failing to
register with Selective Service (or
for any other infraction of the
draft law) is the same as that for
refusing induction: if convicted, a
jail sentence of up to 5 years
and/or a fine of up to $10,000.
While prosecution for violations
other than induction refusal has
been infrequent in the past, it
may increase in the months to
come. This concern will be the

subject of a later Rough Draft
article.
C.O. Work
Among those persons who may
still have urgent needs for draft
counseling, two important groups
can be identified: violators of the
Selective Service law who face
possible prosecution, and
conscientious objectors who are
now performing alternate service.
The first group can get
information and attorney referral
from counselors in Student
Affairs, and the second can get
counseling and job listings from
the Synergy Center in the Old
Union Clubhouse. A small library
on the draft and related subjects is
also housed in the Synergy
Center.
