# A 						Congressional Responsibility
## Balancing The Budget 
### 
Paul JV. McCloskey

The confrontation with the
President over impounded funds
has had one great and beneficial
result. It has forced Congress to
finally recognize our continuing
and chronic incompetence in an
area of major constitutional
responsibility, that of matching
appropriations with tax revenues
each year.
For three years now, we in
Congress have happily
appropriated an average of $47
billion per year more that we
knew the government would
receive in tax revenues.
This year, Fiscal Year 1973
(ending June 30, 1973), it was
$55 billion—we appropriated
$280 billion, yet expect only
$225 billion in revenues.. In 1972
we appropriated $248 billion, yet
received only $208 billion in
revenues; in 1971, $235 billion
was appropriated against only
$188 billion in revenues.
Deficits
In outlay deficits, money
actually spent, a $25 billion
deficit is estimated this year, even
with the President's heavy
impoundments. The deficit was
$23 billion in 1972, $23 billion in
1971.
We know this to be
irresponsible. Inflation and
devaluation of the dollar have

been the inevitable result. The
dollar has lost 30 percent of its
purchasing power since 1966.
Many of our products are no
longer competitive in world
markets. Inflation has cruelly
penalized our old people and our
poor. Congress owes our people a
much higher standard of
performance in our procedures.
The President has been no help.
He has proposed a $12 billion
deficit budget again next year.
While we can justify occasional
deficit years, we know that in a
year of prosperity and peace such
as we now enjoy, we should at
least balance the budget.
Self-discipline is mandatory.
Coalitions
Yet we have no procedure to
do so.
Each of us votes for his own
favorite priorities. I join with a
majority of my colleagues to vote
for more money for education
and health, justifying such votes
by the expectancy of voting for
cuts in defense and agriculture
subsidies. When votes for defense
and agriculture come up, however,
different coalitions join to
increase those funds as well.
We desperately need a
procedure to balance the budget
on the basis of a Congressional
determination of priorities. We

have no right, under the
Constitution, to abdicate
determination of priorities to the
President, any more than we
could abdicate the law-making
power to the President.
Procedures
The following procedures seem
appropriate:
1. We should move to the
calendar year as the fiscal year.
2. During the first three
months of each year, we should
have the appropriate House and
Senate Committees recommend
tentative figures for both
appropriations and revenues.
3. The House Ways and Means
Committee should be charged
during the same three-month
period with considering the
alternative tax rate changes and
revisions to raise revenues equal to
an amount 10 percent higher than
the expenditure ceiling
recommended.
Debate
4. During the month of April,
the House and Senate should
debate both total appropriation
figures and the methods of
taxation proposed by the House
Ways and Means Committee, with
a final vote set for the First week
in May.
5. During the same four month
period the House and Senate
Appropriations Committee should
be reviewing their priorities—with
a goal of setting percentages of
the total budget to be allocated in
each area.
6. When the House and Senate
can agree on both total revenues
and expenditures in early May,
the balance of May and June can
be spent in reaching final approval
of the various appropriation bills,
seeking to allocate the 10 percent
excess in revenues among those
programs where Congress feels the
national goals require priority
expenditures.
The end result will be that
Congress will be determinging
priorities as we are
constitutionally required to do,
and the budget will have a
reasonable chance of being
balanced. Then, and only then,
can Congress stand up to the
Executive Branch and require that
the President actually spend the
monies appropriated. The check
and balance system will be
restored, and perhaps a good deal
of public faith in government as
well. At present, neither Congress
nor the President has justified
such faith.

responsibility, that of matching
appropriations with tax revenues
each year.
For three years now, we in
Congress have happily
appropriated an average of $47
billion per year more that we
knew the government would
receive in tax revenues.
This year, Fiscal Year 1973
(ending June 30, 1973), it was
$55 billion—we appropriated
$280 billion, yet expect only
$225 billion in revenues.. In 1972
we appropriated $248 billion, yet
received only $208 billion in
revenues; in 1971, $235 billion
was appropriated against only
$188 billion in revenues.
Deficits
In outlay deficits, money
actually spent, a $25 billion
deficit is estimated this year, even
with the President's heavy
impoundments. The deficit was
$23 billion in 1972, $23 billion in
1971.
We know this to be
irresponsible. Inflation and
devaluation of the dollar have

been the inevitable result. The
dollar has lost 30 percent of its
purchasing power since 1966.
Many of our products are no
longer competitive in world
markets. Inflation has cruelly
penalized our old people and our
poor. Congress owes our people a
much higher standard of
performance in our procedures.
The President has been no help.
He has proposed a $12 billion
deficit budget again next year.
While we can justify occasional
deficit years, we know that in a
year of prosperity and peace such
as we now enjoy, we should at
least balance the budget.
Self-discipline is mandatory.
Coalitions
Yet we have no procedure to
do so.
Each of us votes for his own
favorite priorities. I join with a
majority of my colleagues to vote
for more money for education
and health, justifying such votes
by the expectancy of voting for
cuts in defense and agriculture
subsidies. When votes for defense
and agriculture come up, however,
different coalitions join to
increase those funds as well.
We desperately need a
procedure to balance the budget
on the basis of a Congressional
determination of priorities. We

have no right, under the
Constitution, to abdicate
determination of priorities to the
President, any more than we
could abdicate the law-making
power to the President.
Procedures
The following procedures seem
appropriate:
1. We should move to the
calendar year as the fiscal year.
2. During the first three
months of each year, we should
have the appropriate House and
Senate Committees recommend
tentative figures for both
appropriations and revenues.
3. The House Ways and Means
Committee should be charged
during the same three-month
period with considering the
alternative tax rate changes and
revisions to raise revenues equal to
an amount 10 percent higher than
the expenditure ceiling
recommended.
Debate
4. During the month of April,
the House and Senate should
debate both total appropriation
figures and the methods of
taxation proposed by the House
Ways and Means Committee, with
a final vote set for the First week
in May.
5. During the same four month
period the House and Senate
Appropriations Committee should
be reviewing their priorities—with
a goal of setting percentages of
the total budget to be allocated in
each area.
6. When the House and Senate
can agree on both total revenues
and expenditures in early May,
the balance of May and June can
be spent in reaching final approval
of the various appropriation bills,
seeking to allocate the 10 percent
excess in revenues among those
programs where Congress feels the
national goals require priority
expenditures.
The end result will be that
Congress will be determinging
priorities as we are
constitutionally required to do,
and the budget will have a
reasonable chance of being
balanced. Then, and only then,
can Congress stand up to the
Executive Branch and require that
the President actually spend the
monies appropriated. The check
and balance system will be
restored, and perhaps a good deal
of public faith in government as
well. At present, neither Congress
nor the President has justified
such faith.

The confrontation with the
President over impounded funds
has had one great and beneficial
