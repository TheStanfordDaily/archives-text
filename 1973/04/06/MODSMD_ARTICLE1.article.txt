# Nixon Scraps Gray's Nomination; Acting FBI Chief Requests Move
## 
### Associated Press 
WASHINGTON — President Nixon
yesterday withdrew his nomination of
L. Patrick Gray 111 as Director of the
Federal Bureau of Investigation. Nixon
said, "it is obvious that Mr. Gray's
nomination will not be confirmed by
the Senate."
Gray, who has headed the giant
law-enforcement bureau since the
death of J. Edgar Hoover last May, has
become entangled in the controversy
over the bugging of Democratic
national headquarters in the Watergate
office-apartment complex.
Senators have criticized Gray for
turning over FBI reports on the probe
of the incident to Counsel to the
President John W. Dean 111.
Others have accused Gray of
making speeches of a political nature

during last fall's election campaign.
Gray denied this, saying the speeches
were in line with his job as temporary
head of the FBI.
Earlier yesterday, the Senate
Judiciary Committee agreed to a
showdown vote next week on Gray's
nomination.
Nixon, announcing the withdrawal
of L. Patrick Gray's nomination,
disclosed only that he has asked the
acting director to stay until a successor
is approved by the Senate.
But Atty. Gen. Richard G.
Kleindienst was quoted as saying in
conversation at a Washington
reception that the administration had
no names lined up as alternative
choices.
Among the names that figured in
immediate speculation were those of

Richard B. Ogilvie, a former Illinois
governor; and U.S. District Court
Judge Matt Byrne of Los Angeles.
Byrne is currently presiding over the
Pentagon Papers trial of Daniel
Ellsberg and Anthony Russo.
Henry Petersen, head of the Justice
Department's criminal division, also
has been mentioned.
Senate Democratic Leader Mike
Mansfield suggested someone with the
experience and background of a man
like Washington Police Chief Jerry
Wilson.
Administration sources indicated
neither Petersen nor Wilson was likely
to be selected.
The Washington Post said that in
addition to Petersen, John Ingersoll,
head of the Bureau of Narcotics and
Dangerous Drugs, is considered to be a
leading candidate. '
Democrats who had opposed Gray's
nomination to head the FBI said
President Nixon's decision to
withdraw the nomination was a
necessary move, forced by Gray's
handling of the Watergate
investigation.
Sen. John V. Tunney, who earlier
in the day had urged Gray's
withdrawal, said it was obvious that
Gray would not have been confirmed.
"Ample evidence was presented
that Mr. Gray was subservient to
pressures from White House aides in
his investigation of the Watergate
affair," the California Democrat said.
He added that he hopes Nixon will
now nominate one "who can pass the
key test — that of administering this
sensitive agency independent of any
partisan pressures."
Tunney was a member of the
Senate Judiciary Committee which
was considering Gray's nomination.
Byrd said Nixon "did the right
thing, the proper thing."
Support For Nomination
But Sen. Lowell P. Weicker Jr.
(R-Conn.), a strong supporter of
Gray's nomination, charged that "the
wrong man has been cast adrift by the
White House."
"It's a sad commentary on the

times when a man of Pat Gray's caliber
goes and others of lesser caliber stay
on in high places," Weicker said.
Scott said, "The decision to request
to withdraw his name could only be
made by one person." He said Gray
made that decision "in the best
interests of the FBI."
Senate Democratic Leader Mike
Mansfield said he was sorry about
Gray's withdrawal "because I think he
was a good man. He was candid, he
was honest. He brought needed
reforms in the FBI by bringing in
women and minorities."

Tunney was a member of the
Senate Judiciary Committee which
was considering Gray's nomination.
Byrd said Nixon "did the right
thing, the proper thing."
Support For Nomination
But Sen. Lowell P. Weicker Jr.
(R-Conn.), a strong supporter of
Gray's nomination, charged that "the
wrong man has been cast adrift by the
White House."
"It's a sad commentary on the

times when a man of Pat Gray's caliber
goes and others of lesser caliber stay
on in high places," Weicker said.
Scott said, "The decision to request
to withdraw his name could only be
made by one person." He said Gray
made that decision "in the best
interests of the FBI."
Senate Democratic Leader Mike
Mansfield said he was sorry about
Gray's withdrawal "because I think he
was a good man. He was candid, he
was honest. He brought needed
reforms in the FBI by bringing in
women and minorities."
WASHINGTON — President Nixon
yesterday withdrew his nomination of
L. Patrick Gray 111 as Director of the
Federal Bureau of Investigation. Nixon
said, "it is obvious that Mr. Gray's
nomination will not be confirmed by
the Senate."
Gray, who has headed the giant
law-enforcement bureau since the
death of J. Edgar Hoover last May, has
become entangled in the controversy
over the bugging of Democratic
national headquarters in the Watergate
office-apartment complex.
Senators have criticized Gray for
turning over FBI reports on the probe
of the incident to Counsel to the
President John W. Dean 111.
Others have accused Gray of
making speeches of a political nature

during last fall's election campaign.
Gray denied this, saying the speeches
were in line with his job as temporary
head of the FBI.
Earlier yesterday, the Senate
Judiciary Committee agreed to a
showdown vote next week on Gray's
nomination.
Nixon, announcing the withdrawal
of L. Patrick Gray's nomination,
disclosed only that he has asked the
acting director to stay until a successor
is approved by the Senate.
But Atty. Gen. Richard G.
Kleindienst was quoted as saying in
conversation at a Washington
reception that the administration had
no names lined up as alternative
choices.
Among the names that figured in
immediate speculation were those of

Richard B. Ogilvie, a former Illinois
governor; and U.S. District Court
Judge Matt Byrne of Los Angeles.
Byrne is currently presiding over the
Pentagon Papers trial of Daniel
Ellsberg and Anthony Russo.
Henry Petersen, head of the Justice
Department's criminal division, also
has been mentioned.
Senate Democratic Leader Mike
Mansfield suggested someone with the
experience and background of a man
like Washington Police Chief Jerry
Wilson.
Administration sources indicated
neither Petersen nor Wilson was likely
to be selected.
The Washington Post said that in
addition to Petersen, John Ingersoll,
head of the Bureau of Narcotics and
Dangerous Drugs, is considered to be a
leading candidate. '
Democrats who had opposed Gray's
nomination to head the FBI said
President Nixon's decision to
withdraw the nomination was a
necessary move, forced by Gray's
handling of the Watergate
investigation.
Sen. John V. Tunney, who earlier
in the day had urged Gray's
withdrawal, said it was obvious that
Gray would not have been confirmed.
"Ample evidence was presented
that Mr. Gray was subservient to
pressures from White House aides in
his investigation of the Watergate
affair," the California Democrat said.
He added that he hopes Nixon will
now nominate one "who can pass the
key test — that of administering this
sensitive agency independent of any
partisan pressures."
