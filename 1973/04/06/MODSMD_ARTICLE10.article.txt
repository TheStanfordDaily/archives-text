# Arizona Adventure
## Snow Bunnies On Parade 
### 
Jerry Coleman

It was Spring break time, and
all through the frat house the
jokers were busy stuffing their
backpacks and drinking "Los
Ruiz" tequila.
Rooke and Nelson, both frigid
Minnesotans, planned to soak up
some good old Grand Canyon sun.
My friend, Mike Agnew, and I had
the same idea, but the Park
Service informed us that all
campsites were already reserved
and a $25 per person fine awaited
those campers without
reservations.
So without any further
reservations, Agnew and I headed
for Riverside (his home), then east
for a car cruising trip of the
Arizona canyonlands.
Our first adventure was a train
ride through the Grand Canyon,
observing colorful mesas, stiff and
glassy-eyed animals, and the
Colorado River winding its way in
the distance, looking, almost
painted upon the horizon.
It's not hard to see why people
think the Canyon's so spectacular.
The train stopped next at
Adventureland, and we took a real
jungle cruise up a river full of
crocodiles!' Mickey Mouse was
there too!
Canteloupe Capitol of the World
Leaving Anaheim, we cruised
into the desert toward Blythe and
the California border. There we
practiced one essential element of
car cruising: greeting other drivers
with small gestures.
For example, a Southern
California girl in a green Capri
returned my smile so .. . oo
nicely I felt giddy. Then a sedan
passed us, and the middle aged
woman in the passenger seat
flipped me off without any
provocation. You meet all types.
Stopping briefly in a Blythe
cafe, we struck up a conversation
with the busboy who said he was
from Ithaca, New York, and just
roaming the West. When asked
how he liked Blythe, he replied,
"It's a town."
We observed that to be a novel
and profound answer as we left
the Arizona desert to climb
toward Prescott, the "mile-high
city." Unfortunately, we left the
sun behind as well. Our
destination was a campground
where we set up a tent in the rain,
then raced to the Prescott's
Sambo's to await clearer skies.
Purina Dog Chow
Halfway into my corned beef
hash with egg, french fries, and
salad ($1.65 special), it started to
'snow. Trapped at Sambo's, we
made the best of the situation by
talking with an older couple at a
neighboring table.
They were from Alabama, she
a heavy-drawl Bear Bryant
football fan, he a paint corrosion
engineer and former World War II
submarine officer.
It was 30 degrees outside, but
we were snuggled inside a
camouflaged sub in some South
Pacific harbor, torpedoing the saki
out of 90,000 tons of enemy
shipping in 20 tense minutes, then
making a quick getaway.
We finally did make our
getaway into the snow and a wet
tent... so wet, we moved to the
car's fully reclining bucket seats.
After a short stop the next
morning at a Prescott laundromat
to dry the tent, ground cloths,
and our sleeping bags, we were off
again.
Turn with the Skid
The car radio crackled with
heavy snow warnings, and as we
skidded through scenic Oak Creek
Canyon we changed plans a little,
deciding not to camp out there.
(Besides, all the campgrounds
were hidden under the last storm's
snowfall.)
So we spent the second night

of our camping trip watching the
Academy Awards and drinking
wine in a Flagstaff motel room.
(All on Mastercharge, of course).
We had hoped to visit the
Arizona Snow Bowl—a 12,000
foot mountain playground with a
view of the Grand Canyon and
five states, but we didn't mind
skipping the scenic view since we
could get the snow bowl feeling
right in the motel parking lot
trying to discover which white
lump was our car.
We drove toward the Grand
Canyon, meeting a couple of Palo
Altans who were on their way
out. One of them described the
Canyon in its present snowy
condition to us: "It's a big hole
with snow blowing in it—you
can't see a thing."
Charge now, Bleed Later
Obviously cheered by the
news, we reached the Canyon in a
blizzard and Mastercharged our
way into a heated cabin, the
Bright Angel Lodge Cocktail
Lounge, a prime rib dinner, the El
Tovar Lodge Cocktail Lounge, a
movie, and a night cap.

The next day, for the entire
day, the canyon was invisible—a
cloudy void. Some of the guard
rails were below the snow, but I
did manage to lean over one point
and yell out to Rooke and Nelson,
camped somewhere a mile down.
I must have called their names
10 times that day but they never
answered. We figured it to be just
plain rudeness, and slushed our
way to the Bright Angel Lodge
TV room to see the CBS News
with Uncle Walter.
Unfortunately, those already in
the TV room wanted to watch
Bob Barker on Truth or
Consequences, so we moved to
the bar. The big action there was a
man who passed out.
Here Comes The Sun
On our day to leave the
Canyon the sun came out and the
place really looked magnificent.
We absorbed some of the beauty,
lunched with the Colonel in
downtown Williams, and
accelerated the engine to Warp
Factor Nine in order to blaze ail
the way back to Riverside by
dinner.

There we finally caught up on
our sleep, even turning down the
chance to see a rock concert
appearance of Foghat, with
special guest attraction,
Hookfoot. Rested, we hit the road
again for the farm and a column
deadline.
Cruising up Interstate 5,
Agnew fell asleep for 90 minutes
and missed two curves. Bugs
splattered against the windshield
all afternoon, but Agnew always
got to eat the big yellow ones.
Our speed increased, the other
cars became a blur—and as I
closed my eyes, clicked the heels
of my keOs together, an . thought
of home, the evii snow queen of
the Southwest and her terrible
blizzard faded away.
Thus we arrived safe and sound
back on the farm with Uncle
Dick, Auntie Jing, and all the
other wonderful people here. It's
so good to be home!
(Jerry Coleman is the only person
at Stanford to refer to Miniature
Golf as "Pee-Wee Golf," and will
be back next Friday.)
