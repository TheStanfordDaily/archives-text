Protest Rehnquist
Editor:
As Nixon moves toward greater
fascist-rule in this country, he is
aided in his usurpation of power,
in part, by the slow death of the
bill of rights. The epitome of the
elimination of even these rights,
not to mention the rights to
self-determination of third world
nations and the basic human
rights of the poor and third
world people in this country is
seen in the speeches, testimony
and opinions of Justice
Rehnquist.
The Supreme Court, its
decisions and the appointments to
it are inherently political, and
Nixon appointed Rehnquist
because of his racist, reactionary
politics. Rehnquist's racism can
easily be seen in his strong, vocal
opposition to the 1964 Phoenix
city ordinance guaranteeing equal
rights of access to public
accommodations (the ordinance
passed unanimously the day after
Rehnquist testified) and his
dedication to segregated school
districts in Phoenix. Rehnquist's
class interests are apparent when
he adamantly refuses to sacrifice
"the freedom of the property
owner," and in his recent decision
upholding the situation where the
number of votes one gets is
directly proportional to the
amount of property one owns.
And since the corporations own
most of the property in the
disputed district, they get all the
votes.
Stanford's occasional habit of
bestowing honors and respect on
the more outstanding luminaries
of imperialism and repression
(e.g., Henry Cabot Lodge,
Professor-elect Alain Enthoven)
continues with Rehnquist's
appearance on campus this
weekend. Besides speaking to a
banquet for law school alumni
Friday night at the Palo Alto
Country Club, he is judging the
moot court finals Saturday
afternoon at 2:30 in the art
auditorium.
We must not allow Rehnquist
to speak unchallengedâ€”we hope
to see other people out leafletting

and picketing with us Saturday
afternoon.

Political Ratpackers
Editor:
This Sunday, April Bth, the
Northern California chapter of the
American Political Item Collectors
will be meeting in the large lounge
of Tresidder Union. The meeting,
to be held from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.,
will be open to the public. I
would like to invite members of
the Stanford community to
attend the gathering, which will
feature exhibits of political
Americana from the past two
centuries of Presidential
campaigns, as well as numerous
items for sale or trade. Our
members will be looking forward
to discussing the collecting and
preservation of campaign
memorabilia with anyone who
would like to visit the meeting.

Bill of Rights
Editor:
President Lyman has
characterized as "mischievous"
the SCOPE/FPAG efforts to
obtain affirmation of the Bill of
Rights in the Stanford
Community.
Perhaps he feels the Bill of
Rights to be a threat to his

conception of how Stanford
should be governed. This would
certainly be a sorry commentary
on how life really is in the
Stanford Community.

Portfolio 800-800
Editor:
This is to protest the use ot
glossy, heavy, expensive papers in
the Benefit Portfolio distributed
to the Stanford staff and faculty
last week. As most employees of
this institution know, the
University is in dire need of
money, and we consider the
Benefit Portfolio to be an
outrageous waste.
Certainly it is among the
proper functions of PER to
update and summarize the
benefits for which Stanford
employees are eligible. However,
this information would
unquestionably be communicated
to the employees just as
effectively on newsprint or,
better, recycled paper.
You have wasted both money
and trees, neither of which is in
any boundless supply. We hope
that the people responsible for the
decision to use such a prodigal
means of communication will not
repeat the mistake.
