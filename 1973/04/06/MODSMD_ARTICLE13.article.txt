# Legislators Tell Opinions On Equal Rights Amendment
## 
### STATE SEN. BROWN AYRES 
Written for the Associated Press
NASHVILLE, Tenn.-I have
reservations about some of the
implications of the Equal Rights
Amendment to the U.S.
Constitution. A small minority of
Women's Lib activists have
pressed for passage of this
amendment without shedding
light on many of the problems
that would arise. _
Some legal problems connected

with this proposal, as with any
constitutional amendment, have
not had a chance to be fully aired.
The ERA would abolish hundreds
of state and federal laws dealing
with many topics, including
marriage, child support,
inheritance and industrial
relations.
I am in favor of equal
treatment of women, equal pay,
equal rights, but this proposed
ERA cannot be compared to the

19th Amendment ratified in 1920
which gave women the right to
vote.
The purpose and intent of that
amendment was clear, concise and
incapable of being misunderstood.
The legal effects of the ERA,
unlike the 19th Amendment, are
not so clear.
Another legal complication is
the way child support and
alimony laws will be affected.
Opponents of the ERA claim it
will make every wife in the United
States legally responsible for
providing 50 percent of the
financial support for her family.
Advocates of the measure cite
the trend in divorce courts across
the country in awarding little or
no alimony and smaller payments
for child support. This is true
because more young women are
working these days and are able to
meet these responsibilities. But
what about the women who are
not working, who through their
married life have not chosen to
work?
Often these women are not
specially trained or lacked
adequate skills and find it difficult
to obtain jobs.
Tennessee and most states have
provided for this contingency
with alimony and child support
laws. But if ERA is adopted, it
will become the supreme law of
the land, and any lesser law in
conflict with it must fall.
This is the heart of my
reservations-the relation between
the state laws and the federal
Constituion. The Tennessee
Legislature has provided for
support of nonworking mothers
who need alimony in order to live
and raise childen.
By enacting this amendment to
the U.S. Constitution, the
legislature, in effect, will take this
matter out of state hands. It
becomes a constitutional issue to
be decided by the federal courts
Alimony insures these women
will be cared for and will not be
reduced to going on welfare and
becoming a ward of the state.
I might also point out laws
pertaining to domestic
relations—marriage, divorce,
etc.—are in the sole jurisdiction of
state courts now and in the past
federal courts have declined to
enter this arena.
I feel our legislature should
have the chance to re-examine

these problems more at length and
reconsider our action of last year.
By STATE REP. LOIS PINES
Written for the Associated Press
BOSTON—The Equal Rights
Amendment would eliminate the
problems of a current haphazard
approach to ending sex
discrimination. Now each state
legislature must deal with each of
the areas of sex discrimination on
a piecemeal basis.
There are numerous instances
every day of inequality in the
treatment of women. Without the
passage of the Equal Rights
Amendment, this will continue.
The amendment would force
all state legislatures to address
themselves to providing equality
under the law now.
I am actively involved in
securing passage of an equal rights
amendment for Massachusetts so
that regardless of what happens
on a federal level, we will be able
to assure women in the
Commonwealth that they will be
able to be treated equally without
regard to sex.
I think that the country as a
whole has suffered greatly as a
result of centuries of sex
discrimination. We discourage
women from becoming involved
in running their country. We
discourage them from seeking
higher education. We discourage
them from pursuing careers and
top-level decision-making
positions.
We have lost immeasurably in
terms of human resources.
Our country's most vital asset
is our human resources, and we
have consistently discouraged full
development of those resources
by not providing. equal
opportunity for all. Passage of the
Equal Rights Amendment would
encourage women to participate
in government, to pursue their
career interests and to contribute
to the fullest extent of their
abilities to American society.
The loss of this resource is, in
my opinion, criminal.
If we don't pass the Equal
Rights Amendment now, it may be
another 50 years before each state
will get around to eliminating
inequality in its laws.
The country cannot wait that
long.
Sex discrimination must not
continue to pervade our culture.

By STATE REP. LOIS PINES
Written for the Associated Press
BOSTON—The Equal Rights
Amendment would eliminate the
problems of a current haphazard
approach to ending sex
discrimination. Now each state
legislature must deal with each of
the areas of sex discrimination on
a piecemeal basis.
There are numerous instances
every day of inequality in the
treatment of women. Without the
passage of the Equal Rights
Amendment, this will continue.
The amendment would force
all state legislatures to address
themselves to providing equality
under the law now.
I am actively involved in
securing passage of an equal rights
amendment for Massachusetts so
that regardless of what happens
on a federal level, we will be able
to assure women in the
Commonwealth that they will be
able to be treated equally without
regard to sex.
I think that the country as a
whole has suffered greatly as a
result of centuries of sex
discrimination. We discourage
women from becoming involved
in running their country. We
discourage them from seeking
higher education. We discourage
them from pursuing careers and
top-level decision-making
positions.
We have lost immeasurably in
terms of human resources.
Our country's most vital asset
is our human resources, and we
have consistently discouraged full
development of those resources
by not providing. equal
opportunity for all. Passage of the
Equal Rights Amendment would
encourage women to participate
in government, to pursue their
career interests and to contribute
to the fullest extent of their
abilities to American society.
The loss of this resource is, in
my opinion, criminal.
If we don't pass the Equal
Rights Amendment now, it may be
another 50 years before each state
will get around to eliminating
inequality in its laws.
The country cannot wait that
long.
Sex discrimination must not
continue to pervade our culture.

Written for the Associated Press
NASHVILLE, Tenn.-I have
reservations about some of the
implications of the Equal Rights
Amendment to the U.S.
Constitution. A small minority of
Women's Lib activists have
pressed for passage of this
amendment without shedding
light on many of the problems
that would arise. _
Some legal problems connected

with this proposal, as with any
constitutional amendment, have
not had a chance to be fully aired.
The ERA would abolish hundreds
of state and federal laws dealing
with many topics, including
marriage, child support,
inheritance and industrial
relations.
I am in favor of equal
treatment of women, equal pay,
equal rights, but this proposed
ERA cannot be compared to the

19th Amendment ratified in 1920
which gave women the right to
vote.
The purpose and intent of that
amendment was clear, concise and
incapable of being misunderstood.
The legal effects of the ERA,
unlike the 19th Amendment, are
not so clear.
Another legal complication is
the way child support and
alimony laws will be affected.
Opponents of the ERA claim it
will make every wife in the United
States legally responsible for
providing 50 percent of the
financial support for her family.
Advocates of the measure cite
the trend in divorce courts across
the country in awarding little or
no alimony and smaller payments
for child support. This is true
because more young women are
working these days and are able to
meet these responsibilities. But
what about the women who are
not working, who through their
married life have not chosen to
work?
Often these women are not
specially trained or lacked
adequate skills and find it difficult
to obtain jobs.
Tennessee and most states have
provided for this contingency
with alimony and child support
laws. But if ERA is adopted, it
will become the supreme law of
the land, and any lesser law in
conflict with it must fall.
This is the heart of my
reservations-the relation between
the state laws and the federal
Constituion. The Tennessee
Legislature has provided for
support of nonworking mothers
who need alimony in order to live
and raise childen.

NASHVILLE, Tenn.-I have
reservations about some of the
implications of the Equal Rights
Amendment to the U.S.
Constitution. A small minority of
Women's Lib activists have
pressed for passage of this
amendment without shedding
light on many of the problems
that would arise. _
Some legal problems connected

with this proposal, as with any
constitutional amendment, have
not had a chance to be fully aired.
The ERA would abolish hundreds
of state and federal laws dealing
with many topics, including
marriage, child support,
inheritance and industrial
relations.
I am in favor of equal
treatment of women, equal pay,
equal rights, but this proposed
ERA cannot be compared to the

19th Amendment ratified in 1920
which gave women the right to
vote.
The purpose and intent of that
amendment was clear, concise and
incapable of being misunderstood.
The legal effects of the ERA,
unlike the 19th Amendment, are
not so clear.
Another legal complication is
the way child support and
alimony laws will be affected.
Opponents of the ERA claim it
will make every wife in the United
States legally responsible for
providing 50 percent of the
financial support for her family.
Advocates of the measure cite
the trend in divorce courts across
the country in awarding little or
no alimony and smaller payments
for child support. This is true
because more young women are
working these days and are able to
meet these responsibilities. But
what about the women who are
not working, who through their
married life have not chosen to
work?
Often these women are not
specially trained or lacked
adequate skills and find it difficult
to obtain jobs.
Tennessee and most states have
provided for this contingency
with alimony and child support
laws. But if ERA is adopted, it
will become the supreme law of
the land, and any lesser law in
conflict with it must fall.
This is the heart of my
reservations-the relation between
the state laws and the federal
Constituion. The Tennessee
Legislature has provided for
support of nonworking mothers
who need alimony in order to live
and raise childen.
By enacting this amendment to
the U.S. Constitution, the
legislature, in effect, will take this
matter out of state hands. It
becomes a constitutional issue to
be decided by the federal courts
Alimony insures these women
will be cared for and will not be
reduced to going on welfare and
becoming a ward of the state.
I might also point out laws
pertaining to domestic
relations—marriage, divorce,
etc.—are in the sole jurisdiction of
state courts now and in the past
federal courts have declined to
enter this arena.
I feel our legislature should
have the chance to re-examine

these problems more at length and
reconsider our action of last year.
By STATE REP. LOIS PINES
Written for the Associated Press
BOSTON—The Equal Rights
Amendment would eliminate the
problems of a current haphazard
approach to ending sex
discrimination. Now each state
legislature must deal with each of
the areas of sex discrimination on
a piecemeal basis.
There are numerous instances
every day of inequality in the
treatment of women. Without the
passage of the Equal Rights
Amendment, this will continue.
The amendment would force
all state legislatures to address
themselves to providing equality
under the law now.
I am actively involved in
securing passage of an equal rights
amendment for Massachusetts so
that regardless of what happens
on a federal level, we will be able
to assure women in the
Commonwealth that they will be
able to be treated equally without
regard to sex.
I think that the country as a
whole has suffered greatly as a
result of centuries of sex
discrimination. We discourage
women from becoming involved
in running their country. We
discourage them from seeking
higher education. We discourage
them from pursuing careers and
top-level decision-making
positions.
We have lost immeasurably in
terms of human resources.
Our country's most vital asset
is our human resources, and we
have consistently discouraged full
development of those resources
by not providing. equal
opportunity for all. Passage of the
Equal Rights Amendment would
encourage women to participate
in government, to pursue their
career interests and to contribute
to the fullest extent of their
abilities to American society.
The loss of this resource is, in
my opinion, criminal.
If we don't pass the Equal
Rights Amendment now, it may be
another 50 years before each state
will get around to eliminating
inequality in its laws.
The country cannot wait that
long.
Sex discrimination must not
continue to pervade our culture.
