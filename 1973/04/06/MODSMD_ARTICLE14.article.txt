Are there any self-service auto garages around the Palo Alto area?
If so, what are their hourly rates? Is instruction available? D. H. T.
Try The Lift, at 651 Urban Lane in Palo Alto. There is a minimum
charge of $2.00 for a half-hour, and the hourly charge is $3.50. If you
want to spend a lot of time there you might consider the $25.00 a day
charge. The Lift is open from 9 a.m. until 8 p.m. on weekdays and 9
a.m. until 6 p.m. on Saturdays.
According to the guy who answered the phone, there are "always
people willing to give advice unless you really have a bizarre
problem."

I live in a high rise in Escondido Village. The bike rack in front of
building has quite a few bikes that appear to be abandoned. Is there
any campus agency that can decide that the bikes are abandoned and
get rid of them, or will the rack gradually fill up with wrecked bikes?
P.G.
The abandoned bikes will be removed soon. According to the
Information Desk at Police Services, Officer Jack Donalds and Santa
Clara County Deputy Lucio Moro will begin checking bicycles for
proper registration. After a warning period they will impound bicycles
that do not have registration stickers. That takes care of abandoned
bikes that are unregistered.
If a bike is registered but is always seen in the same place (i.e. it
appears to be abandoned) the officers will mark the bike to see if it is
indeed used. If the bike is never moved the owner will be traced
through the registration sticker and will be asked if the bike is
abandoned or not. If the owner can't be traced, the bike will be
impounded. That takes care of abandoned bikes that are registered.

Why does the Chaparral no longer publish a humor magazine? Lack
of money? W.H.
According to The Old Boy at the Chaparral, "Sometimes we do
(publish a humor magazine). Mostly we don't have the time, money or
imagination.
"The Chaparral went bankrupt as a slick-paper humor magazine
around 1968. It was Groin (a humor magazine published by the
Chaparral) that drove us into the ground.
"Students are no longer willing to subscribe to expensive, unfunny
college humor magazines. Here or anywhere else."

Are there any self-service auto garages around the Palo Alto area?
If so, what are their hourly rates? Is instruction available? D. H. T.
Try The Lift, at 651 Urban Lane in Palo Alto. There is a minimum
charge of $2.00 for a half-hour, and the hourly charge is $3.50. If you
want to spend a lot of time there you might consider the $25.00 a day
charge. The Lift is open from 9 a.m. until 8 p.m. on weekdays and 9
a.m. until 6 p.m. on Saturdays.
According to the guy who answered the phone, there are "always
people willing to give advice unless you really have a bizarre
problem."

I live in a high rise in Escondido Village. The bike rack in front of
building has quite a few bikes that appear to be abandoned. Is there
any campus agency that can decide that the bikes are abandoned and
get rid of them, or will the rack gradually fill up with wrecked bikes?
P.G.
The abandoned bikes will be removed soon. According to the
Information Desk at Police Services, Officer Jack Donalds and Santa
Clara County Deputy Lucio Moro will begin checking bicycles for
proper registration. After a warning period they will impound bicycles
that do not have registration stickers. That takes care of abandoned
bikes that are unregistered.
If a bike is registered but is always seen in the same place (i.e. it
appears to be abandoned) the officers will mark the bike to see if it is
indeed used. If the bike is never moved the owner will be traced
through the registration sticker and will be asked if the bike is
abandoned or not. If the owner can't be traced, the bike will be
impounded. That takes care of abandoned bikes that are registered.

Why does the Chaparral no longer publish a humor magazine? Lack
of money? W.H.
According to The Old Boy at the Chaparral, "Sometimes we do
(publish a humor magazine). Mostly we don't have the time, money or
imagination.
"The Chaparral went bankrupt as a slick-paper humor magazine
around 1968. It was Groin (a humor magazine published by the
Chaparral) that drove us into the ground.
