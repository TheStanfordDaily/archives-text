# Grand Juries: Threat To Civil Liberties?
## 
### ED KOHN News Analysis 
The Department of Justice's increased use of special
investigative grand juries in recent months has become a
major focal point for civil libertarians and political
activists.
The new wave of grand juries apparently has two
primary targets, "organized crime" and the "New Left."
In the East, grand juries generally devote more energy to
investigating "organized crime," while West Coast grand
juries, particularly those in the Bay Area, have
concentrated on crimes allegedly committed by political
activists.
Objections to grand juries fall into two basic
categories: procedural and motivational. Three groups in
particular have raised vocal objections to the grand
juries' present activities:
— Political activists and their attorneys frequently
charge that grand juries are used for purposes of
harassment, to conduct investigations that the FBI has
been unable to complete, and that prosecutors
frequently use "tainted evidence" — that is, evidence
that has been gathered illegally - during their
presentations.
— Newspaper reporters, writers, editors, and, in some
cases, academicians c}aim that their forced "third party"
testimony before grand juries interferes with their ability
to maintain confidential relationships with news sources.
— Civil libertarians and some law professors complain
that grand juries are now being utilized so extensively
that they now represent a major threat to individual
liberties.
Says one criminal legal scholar: "The grand jury has
always been uniquely susceptible to abuse. Occasional
abuses have always occurred, but today we are seeing
abuses on a scale and with a dramatic intensity unlike
anything we've ever seen before."
In California, as elsewhere, there are two types of
grand juries, county and federal. In theory, the federal
grand jury's sole function is to determine whether or not
there is sufficient evidence to bring federal charges
against people, groups or corporations.
The county grand jury, however, is charged with (1)
considering criminal indictments for violations of the
state penal code; (2) considering misdemeanor violations
committed in or triable in the county; (3) evaluating the
needs of the county; (4) investigating the expenditure of
public monies; and (5) investigating the conduct of
public officials.
Both types of grand juries usually are composed of 23
people. County grand juries are often selected from a list
of prominent citizens nominated on an annual basis by
superior court judges. Federal grand juries are selected at
random from voter registration lists.
Increasing Disuse
The county grand jury has fallen into increasing disuse
insofar as criminal matters are involved. Local
prosecutors (district or state's attorneys) usually find it
easier — and speedier — to proceed by direct accusation
(known as an "information") rather than to go through
a grand jury investigation. In California, about 95
percent of all cases are prosecuted in this manner.
County grand juries, therefore, usually spend most of
their time investigating matters related to county
government, such as local jail operations, airports and
port authorities, and school budgets.

"By and large, grand juries do as they are requested
by prosecutors and they do it with cafeteria speed."
On the federal level, the Organized Crime Control Act
of 1970 in effect mandated U.S. District Courts to
empanel special investigative grand juries on a regular
basis. These grand juries meet specifically to look into
"organized crime" and the "New Left," the latter an
area that appears to frustrate most Justice Department
investigations.
Deter Prosecutors
When grand juries first became institutionalized in this
country, one of their purposes was to deter zealous
prosecutors and to protect the citizenry. As recently as
1972, the Supreme Court said of the grand jury:
"Historically, this body has been regarded as a
primary security to the innocent against hasty, malicious
and oppressive persecution; it serves the invaluable
function in our society of standing between the accuser
and the accused, whether the latter be an individual,
minority group, or other, to determine whether a charge
is founded upon reason or was dictated by an
intimidating power or by malice and personal ill will."
Amsterdam's Views
Law Prof. Anthony G. Amsterdam, some of whose
clients have been among those subpoenaed before
federal investigative grand juries, believes prosecutors
completely dominate the proceedings. Says Amsterdam:
"Lawyers who run grand juries are in a situation as
close to that of God as any human being on this earth.
That is to say that they arc all-powerful within their own
little world, because the grand jury essentially gets no
instructions on the law from anybody but the lawyer
who is running it.

"The [prosecutor] decides when (the grand jurors]
shall convene, when they shall take breakfast, when they
shall take lunch, when they shall go to the bathroom,
when they shall adjourn. He issues the subpoenas and
there's simply nobody to quarrel with him.
Omnipotent Prosecutors
"There' is no judge to restrict what he does,"
Amsterdam asserts. "The grand jurors . .. seldom take
an independent stand. So what happens is that the
prosecutor becomes omnipotent and he becomes infused
with a sense of his omnipotence. That's simply what the
grand jury does to you."
Witnesses before a grand jury are interrogated under
oath secretly by the prosecutor. The grand jurors
themselves ask questions only infrequently. Witness'
attorneys are not permitted in the grand jury's hearing
room. Someone suspected of a particular crime does not
have the right to appear before a grand jury. If one is
subpoenaed (ordered by the court to testify), he may
invoke the Fifth Amendment. But without their lawyers

"Lawyers who run grand juries are in a situation as close to that of God as any human being on earth."

present, most witnesses are reluctant or unable to
exercise their rights.
A witness can be compelled to testify if he is granted
immunity. Such immunity does not protect him from
prosecution; he may not, however, be prosecuted on the
basis of testimony he is compelled to give. Failure to
testify after immunity has been granted usually results in
a witness being cited for contempt of court. Sentences in
cases such as these usually run as long as 18 months, the
maximum term of a grand jury.
'Inevitable'
Amsterdam believes that the outcry raised by radicals
and civil libertarians "is simply the inevitable result of
the bureaucratic focusing of grand juries on radicals."
"The hardline law and order attitude of Mitchell and
Kleindienst is totally unsolicitous of individual rights,"
he contends. "They simply could not give less of a damn
if people are destroyed even though there isn't the least
investigative reason for calling them.
"The present attitude of the Nixon administration
is . . . that if there's any convenience interest at all to be
served by issuing a subpoena, you don't even think
about the weight on the other side. You go ahead and
issue it."
Tandem Grand Juries
Tandem (cooperative) grand juries, Amsterdam says,
are "traditional" but "not legally proper."
"You've got a nationwide network of grand juries all
engaged in the quest after subversives, so that the kind
of cooperation which you fortuitously would get in
individual cases between one grand jury and another in
the old days was nothing compared to the cooperation
between the grand juries that's going on now."
But John Kaplan, another Law School professor and
former federal prosecutor, disagrees with Amsterdam
and others who are concerned about possible grand jury
abuse. The only reason that recent grand juries have
attracted attention, he believes, "is that radicals scream
louder than other people."
'Witch-Hunt'
"Many is the case 1 know when there was a grand jury
investigation that was denounced near and far as an
absolute witch-hunt persecution. Finally the grand jury
returned an indictment, and everyone trooped in and
pleaded guilty," he says
Kaplan terms the citizen-protection aspect of the
grand jury system "quite unimportant. The purpose of
the [federal] grand jury is to pass on [approve]
indictments brought before it by the prosecutor."
He concedes, however, that grand juries only rarely
turned down his requests for indictments. Some of his
presentations, he says, lasted "maybe 20 seconds."
'Cafeteria Speed'
"By and large," he wrote several years ago, "grand
juries today do as they are requested by prosecutors and
they do it with cafeteria speed."
Kaplan says that in the federal system the grand jury
is used as an executive subpoena by agencies such as the
Justice Department and the FBI which, by themselves,
cannot compel testimony.
That practice, among others, leads to "an awful lot of
violations of what we think are normally regarded as the
rights of the citizen," he says. "There's no doubt about
that. Maybe our ideas as to what have been the rights of
the citizen are not really accurate."
On both the county and federal level, it is possible
that a suspect may be indicted in connection with a
crime without even knowing that a grand jury has
considered his case. The suspect does not have the right
to cross-examine witnesses who testified against him.
In some states (excluding California), a suspect may
never see a transcript of the grand jury hearing at which
he was indicted. There are also different evidentiary
rules that apply to grand jury proceedings, so evidence
inadmissible during a trial, such as hearsay, may be used
during a grand jury proceeding.
Broad Questions
Prosecutors frequently ask witnesses questions framed
in the broadest possible terms. One question asked of a
witness during a 1970 probe into the Weatherman
organization was as follows:
"I want you to describe for the grand jury every
occasion during the year 1970 when you have been in

attended by, or been any place when any individual
spoke whom you knew to be associated with or
affiliated with Students for a Democratic Society, the
Weatherman, the Communist Party or any other
organization advocating revolutionary overthrow of the
United States, describing for the grand jury when these
incidents occurred, where they occurred, who was
present and what was said by all persons there and what
you did at the time that you were in these meetings,
groups, associations or conversations."
Strict Secrecy
Grand jury investigations, both state and federal,
usually are conducted in strict secrecy. The public rarely
hears about them until they return indictments, which
are announced in open court, or, in the case of a "sealed
indictment," after the suspect is taken into custody.
The theory behind the secrecy is that investigations
that do not result in indictments or criminal complaints
may unfairly damage the reputations of those who have
been investigated.
However, many activists now contend that the secrecy

contact with, attended meetings conducted by, or
merely allows the government to "hide" what they
consider to be an unjust process from the public view.
Some believe that by bringing the grand jury process to
public attention they can force the government to end
its investigative role.
Many of the investigative grand juries are being run by
prosecuting attorneys from a 14-member section of the
Justice Department's Internal Security Division (ISD)
known as the Special Litigation Section (SLS). Until
recently, the ISD, which is responsible for prosecuting a
wide variety of crimes, including Selective Service
violations, spent most of its time reviewing FBI reports
about alleged radical activities.
The ISD reportedly maintains extremely close ties to
the FBI and controls the Justice Department's own
intelligence network, the Interdivisional Intelligence
Unit (IDIU). The IDIU has a broad responsibility for
observing anti-war and radical activities.
The SLS is headed by Guy L. Goodwin, a former
assistant U.S. attorney for Kansas now known to amny
activists as a "special prosecutor for the Nixon-Mitchell
gang." The SLS was created, in fact, by the Nixon
administration to prosecute "revolutionary terrorists."
Goodwin's Background
In his official Justice Department biography, Good
win describes himself as "an experienced federal
prosecutor who frequently represents the government in
matters growing out of civil disturbances and terrorist
activities."
In effect the Justice Department's "traveling pro
secutor," Goodwin spends as many as three weeks every
month directing special investigative grand juries from
coast to coast. He has personally conducted some of the
Justice Department's most publicized investigations,
including those of Leslie Bacon, the Berrigan brothers
and the Vietnam Veterans Against the War (VVAW).
Since late 1970, the SLS has been waging a
multi-faceted probe into "underground" revolutionaries
and "terrorists." Prior to that, the ISD and the IDIU
concentrated their efforts on ghetto surveillance and an
apparently fruitless investigation into the Black Panther
Party.
Three Broad Categories
During 1971, for example, at least 13 special federal
grand juries investigated political activists falling into
three broad categories: the "underground" revolu
tionaries (Weatherpeople), anti-war intellectuals (the
"Pentagon Papers"), and the Catholic Left (the Berrigan
brothers).
A recent Daily survey shows that at least eight special
federal grand juries, meeting in six cities, currently are
investigating "underground" revolutionaries — four of
whom are on the FBl's "Ten Most Wanted" list — as well
as political activists' means of support.
One special federal grand jury meeting in San
Francisco has conducted a two-month-long investigation
of Venceremos' alleged role in the escape of Chino
prison inmate Ronald Wayne Beaty. A prison guard
trainee was killed during that lynching. Two Los Altos
residents, neither of whom belongs to the revolutionary
organization, were jailed six weeks ago for refusing to
answer questions before this grand jury.
Weatherpeople Probe
A second grand jury in San Francisco apparently is
operating as a "tandem" grand jury with another
meeting in Detroit, Mich. These two grand juries are
attempting to track down and indict a long list of federal
fugitives, many of them identified as Weatherpeople,
including Mark Rudd, Kathy Boudin and Bernadine
Dohrn.
One man from Oregon was jailed in early January for
refusing to testify before this San Francisco grand jury.
Three others testified in December only after the
Supreme Court refused to consider their cases.
The Detroit grand jury recently returned a single
count indictment against 15 people charging them with
conspiring to bomb police facilities, a police officer's
home and military facilities in several states.
'War Council'
Most of those named in the Detroit indictment are
identified as Weatherpeople who attended a January,
1970 "war council" at Flint, Mich. Newspaper reports

indicated that some 400 people attended that
conference.
The 15 defendants — four of whom are in custody,
according to late reports - are charged with conspiring
to make and possess unregistered explosives and to
transport them across state lines "to destroy police
installations and other civic, business and educational
buildings throughout the country and to kill and injure
persons therein."
Another 24 persons are named in the indictment as
co-conspirators. However, no charges have been lodged
against members of this group.
IRA Gun-Running
A third grand jury in San Francisco is investigating
alleged gun-running by American citizens acting on
behalf of the outlawed Irish Republican Army. Most of
the witnesses who have appeared before this grand jury
were subpoenaed from Butte, Mont., a community with
a large Irish-American population. Several persons were
jailed in November for refusing to answer questions
before this grand jury, which, like the other two sitting
in San Francisco, has returned no indictments.
Other grand juries presently are meeting in Cleveland,
Ohio (another Weatherpeople investigation), Los Angeles
(various activities in the student community of Isla
Vista, Calif.), Ft. Worth, Tex. (Irish Republican Army
activities centered in New York City), and a small town
in Arizona (the Beaty escape). '
Several grand juries scattered throughout the country
investigated VVAW activities during the 1972 Republi
can National Convention at Miami Beach, Fla., but these
panels apparently have not met recently.
VVAW Grand Juries
However, one of the VVAW grand juries indicted or
re-indicted seven VVAW members in December for
allegedly plotting to disrupt the convention. One
non-member was also indicted.
The eight are charged with conspiring to attack Miami
Beach police stations with automatic weapons, fire
bombs and other devices. Two of those indicted are
regional VVAW coordinators.
Currently, there appear to be no ongoing investiga
tions of the Catholic Left. The most recent investigation
into anti-war intellectuals ended in late November after a
Harvard University researcher spent six days in jail for
refusing to answer questions before a Boston grand jury
apparently investigating the leak of the "Pentagon
Papers" to The New York Times.
Harassment
Many witnesses before SLS grand juries believe
questions are asked of them not for fact-finding but for
purposes of harassment. Their lawyers appear to have no
great respect for the section's prosecutorial ability or
tactics. These lawyers point out that many convictions
(usually on conspiracy charges) obtained by the SLS are
reversed on appeal.
One lawyer, who asked not to be named, said the ISD
"is the dumping grounds for the entire Justice
Department." "
Sen. Sam Ervin (D.-N.C.), one of the Senate's
watch-dogs of personal liberties, recently told the Los
Angeles Times:
"We ought to put the grand jury back into its proper
function. In the federal system, the function of the
grand jury is being perverted. The grand jury is supposed
to be a judicial body. It is not supposed to go out and
Find evidence for the government."
'Chosen Instrument'
Frank J. Donner, who heads the American Civil
Liberties Union's Project on Political Surveillance, views
the SLS grand juries "as a 'chosen instrument' of a
[Nixon] administration strategy to curb dissent and to
intimidate and demoralize radicals.

"Allegations that any of our grand juries are being
utilized to harass, intimidate, or otherwise discourage
citizens from exercising their constitutional freedoms are
absurd.
"What makes this strategy so effective," Donner
wrote last year, "is that the federal prosecuting officials
who themselves have no power of subpoena - are
using the coercive powers of the grand jury for police
and intelligence purposes."
Donner believes that the Justice Department is
facilitating its prosecutions of radicals by constructing
intricate "sociograms," which he defines this way:
Goodwin Denies Sociograms
"It is all a matter of friendships, affiliations,
communications, meetings, travels, finances, beliefs,
habits . . . This personal and seemingly innocuous data is
then fed into the IDIU data bank .. .[g] rand jury
testimony is thereby integrated with intelligence
gathered from all other sources, including illegal
electronic surveillance conducted by state as well as
federal authorities."
Prosecutor Goodwin, known at the Justice Depart
ment for his "computer-like mind," denies that SLS is
constructing sociograms. He told the Los Angeles Times,
"I don't even know what a sociogram is."
In a letter to this reporter about the San Francisco
Weatherpeople grand jury, Goodwin commented:
"I can assure you that the singular purpose of that
grand jury as well as other grand juries ~ . (I] have been
involved in is to investigate and present evidence of
specific violations of Federal law. Allegations that this or
any of our grand juries are being utilized to harass,
intimidate or otherwise discourage citizens, whatever
their political persuasion may be, from exercising their
constitutional freedoms arc absurd."

In California, as elsewhere, there are two types of

grand jury's sole function is to determine whether or not
there is sufficient evidence to bring federal charges

The county grand jury, however, is charged with (1)

state penal code; (2) considering misdemeanor violations
committed in or triable in the county; (3) evaluating the

public officials.
Both types of grand juries usually are composed of 23
people. County grand juries are often selected from a list
of prominent citizens nominated on an annual basis by
superior court judges. Federal grand juries are selected at

Increasing Disuse
The county grand jury has fallen into increasing disuse
insofar as criminal matters are involved. Local
prosecutors (district or state's attorneys) usually find it
easier — and speedier — to proceed by direct accusation
(known as an "information") rather than to go through
a grand jury investigation. In California, about 95
percent of all cases are prosecuted in this manner.
County grand juries, therefore, usually spend most of

of 1970 in effect mandated U.S. District Courts to
empanel special investigative grand juries on a regular

"organized crime" and the "New Left," the latter an
area that appears to frustrate most Justice Department
investigations.
Deter Prosecutors
When grand juries first became institutionalized in this
country, one of their purposes was to deter zealous
prosecutors and to protect the citizenry. As recently as
1972, the Supreme Court said of the grand jury:
"Historically, this body has been regarded as a

function in our society of standing between the accuser
and the accused, whether the latter be an individual,
minority group, or other, to determine whether a charge
is founded upon reason or was dictated by an
intimidating power or by malice and personal ill will."
Amsterdam's Views
Law Prof. Anthony G. Amsterdam, some of whose
clients have been among those subpoenaed before
federal investigative grand juries, believes prosecutors
completely dominate the proceedings. Says Amsterdam:
"Lawyers who run grand juries are in a situation as
close to that of God as any human being on this earth.
That is to say that they arc all-powerful within their own
little world, because the grand jury essentially gets no
instructions on the law from anybody but the lawyer
who is running it.

present, most witnesses are reluctant or unable to
exercise their rights.
A witness can be compelled to testify if he is granted
immunity. Such immunity does not protect him from
prosecution; he may not, however, be prosecuted on the
basis of testimony he is compelled to give. Failure to
testify after immunity has been granted usually results in
a witness being cited for contempt of court. Sentences in
cases such as these usually run as long as 18 months, the
maximum term of a grand jury.

Tandem Grand Juries
Tandem (cooperative) grand juries, Amsterdam says,
are "traditional" but "not legally proper."
"You've got a nationwide network of grand juries all
engaged in the quest after subversives, so that the kind
of cooperation which you fortuitously would get in
individual cases between one grand jury and another in

But John Kaplan, another Law School professor and
former federal prosecutor, disagrees with Amsterdam
and others who are concerned about possible grand jury
abuse. The only reason that recent grand juries have
attracted attention, he believes, "is that radicals scream
louder than other people."
'Witch-Hunt'
"Many is the case 1 know when there was a grand jury
investigation that was denounced near and far as an
absolute witch-hunt persecution. Finally the grand jury
returned an indictment, and everyone trooped in and
pleaded guilty," he says
Kaplan terms the citizen-protection aspect of the

On both the county and federal level, it is possible
that a suspect may be indicted in connection with a

In some states (excluding California), a suspect may
never see a transcript of the grand jury hearing at which
he was indicted. There are also different evidentiary
rules that apply to grand jury proceedings, so evidence
inadmissible during a trial, such as hearsay, may be used
during a grand jury proceeding.
Broad Questions
Prosecutors frequently ask witnesses questions framed
in the broadest possible terms. One question asked of a
witness during a 1970 probe into the Weatherman
organization was as follows:
"I want you to describe for the grand jury every
occasion during the year 1970 when you have been in

attended by, or been any place when any individual
spoke whom you knew to be associated with or
affiliated with Students for a Democratic Society, the
Weatherman, the Communist Party or any other
organization advocating revolutionary overthrow of the
United States, describing for the grand jury when these
incidents occurred, where they occurred, who was
present and what was said by all persons there and what
you did at the time that you were in these meetings,
groups, associations or conversations."
Strict Secrecy
Grand jury investigations, both state and federal,
usually are conducted in strict secrecy. The public rarely
hears about them until they return indictments, which
are announced in open court, or, in the case of a "sealed
indictment," after the suspect is taken into custody.
The theory behind the secrecy is that investigations
that do not result in indictments or criminal complaints
may unfairly damage the reputations of those who have
been investigated.
However, many activists now contend that the secrecy

contact with, attended meetings conducted by, or
merely allows the government to "hide" what they
consider to be an unjust process from the public view.
Some believe that by bringing the grand jury process to
public attention they can force the government to end
its investigative role.
Many of the investigative grand juries are being run by
prosecuting attorneys from a 14-member section of the
Justice Department's Internal Security Division (ISD)
known as the Special Litigation Section (SLS). Until
recently, the ISD, which is responsible for prosecuting a
wide variety of crimes, including Selective Service
violations, spent most of its time reviewing FBI reports
about alleged radical activities.
The ISD reportedly maintains extremely close ties to
the FBI and controls the Justice Department's own
intelligence network, the Interdivisional Intelligence

observing anti-war and radical activities.
The SLS is headed by Guy L. Goodwin, a former
assistant U.S. attorney for Kansas now known to amny
activists as a "special prosecutor for the Nixon-Mitchell
gang." The SLS was created, in fact, by the Nixon
administration to prosecute "revolutionary terrorists."
Goodwin's Background
In his official Justice Department biography, Good
win describes himself as "an experienced federal
prosecutor who frequently represents the government in
matters growing out of civil disturbances and terrorist
activities."
In effect the Justice Department's "traveling pro

month directing special investigative grand juries from
coast to coast. He has personally conducted some of the
Justice Department's most publicized investigations,
including those of Leslie Bacon, the Berrigan brothers
and the Vietnam Veterans Against the War (VVAW).
Since late 1970, the SLS has been waging a
multi-faceted probe into "underground" revolutionaries
and "terrorists." Prior to that, the ISD and the IDIU
concentrated their efforts on ghetto surveillance and an
apparently fruitless investigation into the Black Panther
Party.
Three Broad Categories
During 1971, for example, at least 13 special federal
grand juries investigated political activists falling into
three broad categories: the "underground" revolu
tionaries (Weatherpeople), anti-war intellectuals (the
"Pentagon Papers"), and the Catholic Left (the Berrigan
brothers).
A recent Daily survey shows that at least eight special
federal grand juries, meeting in six cities, currently are
investigating "underground" revolutionaries — four of
whom are on the FBl's "Ten Most Wanted" list — as well
as political activists' means of support.
One special federal grand jury meeting in San
Francisco has conducted a two-month-long investigation
of Venceremos' alleged role in the escape of Chino
prison inmate Ronald Wayne Beaty. A prison guard
trainee was killed during that lynching. Two Los Altos
residents, neither of whom belongs to the revolutionary
organization, were jailed six weeks ago for refusing to
answer questions before this grand jury.
Weatherpeople Probe
A second grand jury in San Francisco apparently is
operating as a "tandem" grand jury with another
meeting in Detroit, Mich. These two grand juries are
attempting to track down and indict a long list of federal
fugitives, many of them identified as Weatherpeople,
including Mark Rudd, Kathy Boudin and Bernadine
Dohrn.
One man from Oregon was jailed in early January for
refusing to testify before this San Francisco grand jury.
Three others testified in December only after the
Supreme Court refused to consider their cases.
The Detroit grand jury recently returned a single
count indictment against 15 people charging them with
conspiring to bomb police facilities, a police officer's
home and military facilities in several states.
'War Council'
Most of those named in the Detroit indictment are
identified as Weatherpeople who attended a January,
1970 "war council" at Flint, Mich. Newspaper reports

indicated that some 400 people attended that
conference.
The 15 defendants — four of whom are in custody,
according to late reports - are charged with conspiring
to make and possess unregistered explosives and to
transport them across state lines "to destroy police
installations and other civic, business and educational
buildings throughout the country and to kill and injure
persons therein."
Another 24 persons are named in the indictment as
co-conspirators. However, no charges have been lodged
against members of this group.
IRA Gun-Running
A third grand jury in San Francisco is investigating
alleged gun-running by American citizens acting on
behalf of the outlawed Irish Republican Army. Most of
the witnesses who have appeared before this grand jury
were subpoenaed from Butte, Mont., a community with
a large Irish-American population. Several persons were
jailed in November for refusing to answer questions
before this grand jury, which, like the other two sitting
in San Francisco, has returned no indictments.
Other grand juries presently are meeting in Cleveland,
Ohio (another Weatherpeople investigation), Los Angeles
(various activities in the student community of Isla
Vista, Calif.), Ft. Worth, Tex. (Irish Republican Army
activities centered in New York City), and a small town
in Arizona (the Beaty escape). '
Several grand juries scattered throughout the country
investigated VVAW activities during the 1972 Republi
can National Convention at Miami Beach, Fla., but these
panels apparently have not met recently.
VVAW Grand Juries
However, one of the VVAW grand juries indicted or
re-indicted seven VVAW members in December for
allegedly plotting to disrupt the convention. One
non-member was also indicted.
The eight are charged with conspiring to attack Miami
Beach police stations with automatic weapons, fire
bombs and other devices. Two of those indicted are
regional VVAW coordinators.
Currently, there appear to be no ongoing investiga
tions of the Catholic Left. The most recent investigation
into anti-war intellectuals ended in late November after a
Harvard University researcher spent six days in jail for
refusing to answer questions before a Boston grand jury
apparently investigating the leak of the "Pentagon
Papers" to The New York Times.
Harassment
Many witnesses before SLS grand juries believe
questions are asked of them not for fact-finding but for
purposes of harassment. Their lawyers appear to have no
great respect for the section's prosecutorial ability or
tactics. These lawyers point out that many convictions
(usually on conspiracy charges) obtained by the SLS are
reversed on appeal.
One lawyer, who asked not to be named, said the ISD
"is the dumping grounds for the entire Justice
Department." "
Sen. Sam Ervin (D.-N.C.), one of the Senate's
watch-dogs of personal liberties, recently told the Los
Angeles Times:
"We ought to put the grand jury back into its proper
function. In the federal system, the function of the
grand jury is being perverted. The grand jury is supposed
to be a judicial body. It is not supposed to go out and
Find evidence for the government."
'Chosen Instrument'
Frank J. Donner, who heads the American Civil
Liberties Union's Project on Political Surveillance, views
the SLS grand juries "as a 'chosen instrument' of a
[Nixon] administration strategy to curb dissent and to
intimidate and demoralize radicals.

"Allegations that any of our grand juries are being
utilized to harass, intimidate, or otherwise discourage
citizens from exercising their constitutional freedoms are
absurd.
"What makes this strategy so effective," Donner
wrote last year, "is that the federal prosecuting officials
who themselves have no power of subpoena - are
using the coercive powers of the grand jury for police
and intelligence purposes."
Donner believes that the Justice Department is
facilitating its prosecutions of radicals by constructing
intricate "sociograms," which he defines this way:
Goodwin Denies Sociograms
"It is all a matter of friendships, affiliations,
communications, meetings, travels, finances, beliefs,
habits . . . This personal and seemingly innocuous data is
then fed into the IDIU data bank .. .[g] rand jury
testimony is thereby integrated with intelligence
gathered from all other sources, including illegal
electronic surveillance conducted by state as well as
federal authorities."
Prosecutor Goodwin, known at the Justice Depart
ment for his "computer-like mind," denies that SLS is
constructing sociograms. He told the Los Angeles Times,
"I don't even know what a sociogram is."
In a letter to this reporter about the San Francisco
Weatherpeople grand jury, Goodwin commented:
"I can assure you that the singular purpose of that
grand jury as well as other grand juries ~ . (I] have been
involved in is to investigate and present evidence of
specific violations of Federal law. Allegations that this or
any of our grand juries are being utilized to harass,
intimidate or otherwise discourage citizens, whatever
their political persuasion may be, from exercising their
constitutional freedoms arc absurd."

GUV L. GOODWIN
The Department of Justice's increased use of special
investigative grand juries in recent months has become a
major focal point for civil libertarians and political
activists.
The new wave of grand juries apparently has two
primary targets, "organized crime" and the "New Left."
In the East, grand juries generally devote more energy to
investigating "organized crime," while West Coast grand
juries, particularly those in the Bay Area, have
concentrated on crimes allegedly committed by political
activists.
Objections to grand juries fall into two basic
categories: procedural and motivational. Three groups in
particular have raised vocal objections to the grand
juries' present activities:
— Political activists and their attorneys frequently
charge that grand juries are used for purposes of
harassment, to conduct investigations that the FBI has
been unable to complete, and that prosecutors
frequently use "tainted evidence" — that is, evidence
that has been gathered illegally - during their
presentations.
— Newspaper reporters, writers, editors, and, in some
cases, academicians c}aim that their forced "third party"
testimony before grand juries interferes with their ability
to maintain confidential relationships with news sources.
— Civil libertarians and some law professors complain
that grand juries are now being utilized so extensively
that they now represent a major threat to individual
liberties.
Says one criminal legal scholar: "The grand jury has
always been uniquely susceptible to abuse. Occasional
abuses have always occurred, but today we are seeing
abuses on a scale and with a dramatic intensity unlike
anything we've ever seen before."
In California, as elsewhere, there are two types of
grand juries, county and federal. In theory, the federal
grand jury's sole function is to determine whether or not
there is sufficient evidence to bring federal charges
against people, groups or corporations.
The county grand jury, however, is charged with (1)
considering criminal indictments for violations of the
state penal code; (2) considering misdemeanor violations
committed in or triable in the county; (3) evaluating the
needs of the county; (4) investigating the expenditure of
public monies; and (5) investigating the conduct of
public officials.
Both types of grand juries usually are composed of 23
people. County grand juries are often selected from a list
of prominent citizens nominated on an annual basis by
superior court judges. Federal grand juries are selected at
random from voter registration lists.
Increasing Disuse
The county grand jury has fallen into increasing disuse
insofar as criminal matters are involved. Local
prosecutors (district or state's attorneys) usually find it
easier — and speedier — to proceed by direct accusation
(known as an "information") rather than to go through
a grand jury investigation. In California, about 95
percent of all cases are prosecuted in this manner.
County grand juries, therefore, usually spend most of
their time investigating matters related to county
government, such as local jail operations, airports and
port authorities, and school budgets.

"By and large, grand juries do as they are requested
by prosecutors and they do it with cafeteria speed."
On the federal level, the Organized Crime Control Act
of 1970 in effect mandated U.S. District Courts to
empanel special investigative grand juries on a regular
basis. These grand juries meet specifically to look into
"organized crime" and the "New Left," the latter an
area that appears to frustrate most Justice Department
investigations.
Deter Prosecutors
When grand juries first became institutionalized in this
country, one of their purposes was to deter zealous
prosecutors and to protect the citizenry. As recently as
1972, the Supreme Court said of the grand jury:
"Historically, this body has been regarded as a
primary security to the innocent against hasty, malicious
and oppressive persecution; it serves the invaluable
function in our society of standing between the accuser
and the accused, whether the latter be an individual,
minority group, or other, to determine whether a charge
is founded upon reason or was dictated by an
intimidating power or by malice and personal ill will."
Amsterdam's Views
Law Prof. Anthony G. Amsterdam, some of whose
clients have been among those subpoenaed before
federal investigative grand juries, believes prosecutors
completely dominate the proceedings. Says Amsterdam:
"Lawyers who run grand juries are in a situation as
close to that of God as any human being on this earth.
That is to say that they arc all-powerful within their own
little world, because the grand jury essentially gets no
instructions on the law from anybody but the lawyer
who is running it.

"The [prosecutor] decides when (the grand jurors]
shall convene, when they shall take breakfast, when they
shall take lunch, when they shall go to the bathroom,
when they shall adjourn. He issues the subpoenas and
there's simply nobody to quarrel with him.
Omnipotent Prosecutors
"There' is no judge to restrict what he does,"
Amsterdam asserts. "The grand jurors . .. seldom take
an independent stand. So what happens is that the
prosecutor becomes omnipotent and he becomes infused
with a sense of his omnipotence. That's simply what the
grand jury does to you."
Witnesses before a grand jury are interrogated under
oath secretly by the prosecutor. The grand jurors
themselves ask questions only infrequently. Witness'
attorneys are not permitted in the grand jury's hearing
room. Someone suspected of a particular crime does not
have the right to appear before a grand jury. If one is
subpoenaed (ordered by the court to testify), he may
invoke the Fifth Amendment. But without their lawyers

"Lawyers who run grand juries are in a situation as close to that of God as any human being on earth."

present, most witnesses are reluctant or unable to
exercise their rights.
A witness can be compelled to testify if he is granted
immunity. Such immunity does not protect him from
prosecution; he may not, however, be prosecuted on the
basis of testimony he is compelled to give. Failure to
testify after immunity has been granted usually results in
a witness being cited for contempt of court. Sentences in
cases such as these usually run as long as 18 months, the
maximum term of a grand jury.
'Inevitable'
Amsterdam believes that the outcry raised by radicals
and civil libertarians "is simply the inevitable result of
the bureaucratic focusing of grand juries on radicals."
"The hardline law and order attitude of Mitchell and
Kleindienst is totally unsolicitous of individual rights,"
he contends. "They simply could not give less of a damn
if people are destroyed even though there isn't the least
investigative reason for calling them.
"The present attitude of the Nixon administration
is . . . that if there's any convenience interest at all to be
served by issuing a subpoena, you don't even think
about the weight on the other side. You go ahead and
issue it."
Tandem Grand Juries
Tandem (cooperative) grand juries, Amsterdam says,
are "traditional" but "not legally proper."
"You've got a nationwide network of grand juries all
engaged in the quest after subversives, so that the kind
of cooperation which you fortuitously would get in
individual cases between one grand jury and another in
the old days was nothing compared to the cooperation
between the grand juries that's going on now."
But John Kaplan, another Law School professor and
former federal prosecutor, disagrees with Amsterdam
and others who are concerned about possible grand jury
abuse. The only reason that recent grand juries have
attracted attention, he believes, "is that radicals scream
louder than other people."
'Witch-Hunt'
"Many is the case 1 know when there was a grand jury
investigation that was denounced near and far as an
absolute witch-hunt persecution. Finally the grand jury
returned an indictment, and everyone trooped in and
pleaded guilty," he says
Kaplan terms the citizen-protection aspect of the
grand jury system "quite unimportant. The purpose of
the [federal] grand jury is to pass on [approve]
indictments brought before it by the prosecutor."
He concedes, however, that grand juries only rarely
turned down his requests for indictments. Some of his
presentations, he says, lasted "maybe 20 seconds."
'Cafeteria Speed'
"By and large," he wrote several years ago, "grand
juries today do as they are requested by prosecutors and
they do it with cafeteria speed."
Kaplan says that in the federal system the grand jury
is used as an executive subpoena by agencies such as the
Justice Department and the FBI which, by themselves,
cannot compel testimony.
That practice, among others, leads to "an awful lot of
violations of what we think are normally regarded as the
rights of the citizen," he says. "There's no doubt about
that. Maybe our ideas as to what have been the rights of
the citizen are not really accurate."
On both the county and federal level, it is possible
that a suspect may be indicted in connection with a
crime without even knowing that a grand jury has
considered his case. The suspect does not have the right
to cross-examine witnesses who testified against him.
In some states (excluding California), a suspect may
never see a transcript of the grand jury hearing at which
he was indicted. There are also different evidentiary
rules that apply to grand jury proceedings, so evidence
inadmissible during a trial, such as hearsay, may be used
during a grand jury proceeding.
Broad Questions
Prosecutors frequently ask witnesses questions framed
in the broadest possible terms. One question asked of a
witness during a 1970 probe into the Weatherman
organization was as follows:
"I want you to describe for the grand jury every
occasion during the year 1970 when you have been in

attended by, or been any place when any individual
spoke whom you knew to be associated with or
affiliated with Students for a Democratic Society, the
Weatherman, the Communist Party or any other
organization advocating revolutionary overthrow of the
United States, describing for the grand jury when these
incidents occurred, where they occurred, who was
present and what was said by all persons there and what
you did at the time that you were in these meetings,
groups, associations or conversations."
Strict Secrecy
Grand jury investigations, both state and federal,
usually are conducted in strict secrecy. The public rarely
hears about them until they return indictments, which
are announced in open court, or, in the case of a "sealed
indictment," after the suspect is taken into custody.
The theory behind the secrecy is that investigations
that do not result in indictments or criminal complaints
may unfairly damage the reputations of those who have
been investigated.
However, many activists now contend that the secrecy

contact with, attended meetings conducted by, or
merely allows the government to "hide" what they
consider to be an unjust process from the public view.
Some believe that by bringing the grand jury process to
public attention they can force the government to end
its investigative role.
Many of the investigative grand juries are being run by
prosecuting attorneys from a 14-member section of the
Justice Department's Internal Security Division (ISD)
known as the Special Litigation Section (SLS). Until
recently, the ISD, which is responsible for prosecuting a
wide variety of crimes, including Selective Service
violations, spent most of its time reviewing FBI reports
about alleged radical activities.
The ISD reportedly maintains extremely close ties to
the FBI and controls the Justice Department's own
intelligence network, the Interdivisional Intelligence
Unit (IDIU). The IDIU has a broad responsibility for
observing anti-war and radical activities.
The SLS is headed by Guy L. Goodwin, a former
assistant U.S. attorney for Kansas now known to amny
activists as a "special prosecutor for the Nixon-Mitchell
gang." The SLS was created, in fact, by the Nixon
administration to prosecute "revolutionary terrorists."
Goodwin's Background
In his official Justice Department biography, Good
win describes himself as "an experienced federal
prosecutor who frequently represents the government in
matters growing out of civil disturbances and terrorist
activities."
In effect the Justice Department's "traveling pro
secutor," Goodwin spends as many as three weeks every
month directing special investigative grand juries from
coast to coast. He has personally conducted some of the
Justice Department's most publicized investigations,
including those of Leslie Bacon, the Berrigan brothers
and the Vietnam Veterans Against the War (VVAW).
Since late 1970, the SLS has been waging a
multi-faceted probe into "underground" revolutionaries
and "terrorists." Prior to that, the ISD and the IDIU
concentrated their efforts on ghetto surveillance and an
apparently fruitless investigation into the Black Panther
Party.
Three Broad Categories
During 1971, for example, at least 13 special federal
grand juries investigated political activists falling into
three broad categories: the "underground" revolu
tionaries (Weatherpeople), anti-war intellectuals (the
"Pentagon Papers"), and the Catholic Left (the Berrigan
brothers).
A recent Daily survey shows that at least eight special
federal grand juries, meeting in six cities, currently are
investigating "underground" revolutionaries — four of
whom are on the FBl's "Ten Most Wanted" list — as well
as political activists' means of support.
One special federal grand jury meeting in San
Francisco has conducted a two-month-long investigation
of Venceremos' alleged role in the escape of Chino
prison inmate Ronald Wayne Beaty. A prison guard
trainee was killed during that lynching. Two Los Altos
residents, neither of whom belongs to the revolutionary
organization, were jailed six weeks ago for refusing to
answer questions before this grand jury.
Weatherpeople Probe
A second grand jury in San Francisco apparently is
operating as a "tandem" grand jury with another
meeting in Detroit, Mich. These two grand juries are
attempting to track down and indict a long list of federal
fugitives, many of them identified as Weatherpeople,
including Mark Rudd, Kathy Boudin and Bernadine
Dohrn.
One man from Oregon was jailed in early January for
refusing to testify before this San Francisco grand jury.
Three others testified in December only after the
Supreme Court refused to consider their cases.
The Detroit grand jury recently returned a single
count indictment against 15 people charging them with
conspiring to bomb police facilities, a police officer's
home and military facilities in several states.
'War Council'
Most of those named in the Detroit indictment are
identified as Weatherpeople who attended a January,
1970 "war council" at Flint, Mich. Newspaper reports

indicated that some 400 people attended that
conference.
The 15 defendants — four of whom are in custody,
according to late reports - are charged with conspiring
to make and possess unregistered explosives and to
transport them across state lines "to destroy police
installations and other civic, business and educational
buildings throughout the country and to kill and injure
persons therein."
Another 24 persons are named in the indictment as
co-conspirators. However, no charges have been lodged
against members of this group.
IRA Gun-Running
A third grand jury in San Francisco is investigating
alleged gun-running by American citizens acting on
behalf of the outlawed Irish Republican Army. Most of
the witnesses who have appeared before this grand jury
were subpoenaed from Butte, Mont., a community with
a large Irish-American population. Several persons were
jailed in November for refusing to answer questions
before this grand jury, which, like the other two sitting
in San Francisco, has returned no indictments.
Other grand juries presently are meeting in Cleveland,
Ohio (another Weatherpeople investigation), Los Angeles
(various activities in the student community of Isla
Vista, Calif.), Ft. Worth, Tex. (Irish Republican Army
activities centered in New York City), and a small town
in Arizona (the Beaty escape). '
Several grand juries scattered throughout the country
investigated VVAW activities during the 1972 Republi
can National Convention at Miami Beach, Fla., but these
panels apparently have not met recently.
VVAW Grand Juries
However, one of the VVAW grand juries indicted or
re-indicted seven VVAW members in December for
allegedly plotting to disrupt the convention. One
non-member was also indicted.
The eight are charged with conspiring to attack Miami
Beach police stations with automatic weapons, fire
bombs and other devices. Two of those indicted are
regional VVAW coordinators.
Currently, there appear to be no ongoing investiga
tions of the Catholic Left. The most recent investigation
into anti-war intellectuals ended in late November after a
Harvard University researcher spent six days in jail for
refusing to answer questions before a Boston grand jury
apparently investigating the leak of the "Pentagon
Papers" to The New York Times.
Harassment
Many witnesses before SLS grand juries believe
questions are asked of them not for fact-finding but for
purposes of harassment. Their lawyers appear to have no
great respect for the section's prosecutorial ability or
tactics. These lawyers point out that many convictions
(usually on conspiracy charges) obtained by the SLS are
reversed on appeal.
One lawyer, who asked not to be named, said the ISD
"is the dumping grounds for the entire Justice
Department." "
Sen. Sam Ervin (D.-N.C.), one of the Senate's
watch-dogs of personal liberties, recently told the Los
Angeles Times:
"We ought to put the grand jury back into its proper
function. In the federal system, the function of the
grand jury is being perverted. The grand jury is supposed
to be a judicial body. It is not supposed to go out and
Find evidence for the government."
'Chosen Instrument'
Frank J. Donner, who heads the American Civil
Liberties Union's Project on Political Surveillance, views
the SLS grand juries "as a 'chosen instrument' of a
[Nixon] administration strategy to curb dissent and to
intimidate and demoralize radicals.

"Allegations that any of our grand juries are being
utilized to harass, intimidate, or otherwise discourage
citizens from exercising their constitutional freedoms are
absurd.
"What makes this strategy so effective," Donner
wrote last year, "is that the federal prosecuting officials
who themselves have no power of subpoena - are

and intelligence purposes."
Donner believes that the Justice Department is
facilitating its prosecutions of radicals by constructing
intricate "sociograms," which he defines this way:

communications, meetings, travels, finances, beliefs,

gathered from all other sources, including illegal
electronic surveillance conducted by state as well as
federal authorities."
Prosecutor Goodwin, known at the Justice Depart
ment for his "computer-like mind," denies that SLS is
constructing sociograms. He told the Los Angeles Times,
"I don't even know what a sociogram is."
In a letter to this reporter about the San Francisco
Weatherpeople grand jury, Goodwin commented:
"I can assure you that the singular purpose of that
grand jury as well as other grand juries ~ . (I] have been
involved in is to investigate and present evidence of
specific violations of Federal law. Allegations that this or
any of our grand juries are being utilized to harass,
intimidate or otherwise discourage citizens, whatever
their political persuasion may be, from exercising their
constitutional freedoms arc absurd."

grand jury's sole function is to determine whether or not
there is sufficient evidence to bring federal charges

The county grand jury, however, is charged with (1)

Both types of grand juries usually are composed of 23

of prominent citizens nominated on an annual basis by
superior court judges. Federal grand juries are selected at

Increasing Disuse
The county grand jury has fallen into increasing disuse
insofar as criminal matters are involved. Local

of 1970 in effect mandated U.S. District Courts to
empanel special investigative grand juries on a regular
basis. These grand juries meet specifically to look into
"organized crime" and the "New Left," the latter an
area that appears to frustrate most Justice Department
investigations.
Deter Prosecutors
When grand juries first became institutionalized in this
country, one of their purposes was to deter zealous
prosecutors and to protect the citizenry. As recently as
1972, the Supreme Court said of the grand jury:
"Historically, this body has been regarded as a
primary security to the innocent against hasty, malicious
and oppressive persecution; it serves the invaluable
function in our society of standing between the accuser
and the accused, whether the latter be an individual,
minority group, or other, to determine whether a charge
is founded upon reason or was dictated by an
intimidating power or by malice and personal ill will."
Amsterdam's Views
Law Prof. Anthony G. Amsterdam, some of whose
clients have been among those subpoenaed before
federal investigative grand juries, believes prosecutors
completely dominate the proceedings. Says Amsterdam:
"Lawyers who run grand juries are in a situation as
close to that of God as any human being on this earth.
That is to say that they arc all-powerful within their own

present, most witnesses are reluctant or unable to
exercise their rights.
A witness can be compelled to testify if he is granted
immunity. Such immunity does not protect him from
prosecution; he may not, however, be prosecuted on the
basis of testimony he is compelled to give. Failure to
testify after immunity has been granted usually results in
a witness being cited for contempt of court. Sentences in
cases such as these usually run as long as 18 months, the

that a suspect may be indicted in connection with a
crime without even knowing that a grand jury has
considered his case. The suspect does not have the right
to cross-examine witnesses who testified against him.
In some states (excluding California), a suspect may
never see a transcript of the grand jury hearing at which
he was indicted. There are also different evidentiary
rules that apply to grand jury proceedings, so evidence
inadmissible during a trial, such as hearsay, may be used
during a grand jury proceeding.
Broad Questions
Prosecutors frequently ask witnesses questions framed
in the broadest possible terms. One question asked of a
witness during a 1970 probe into the Weatherman
organization was as follows:
"I want you to describe for the grand jury every
occasion during the year 1970 when you have been in

attended by, or been any place when any individual
spoke whom you knew to be associated with or
affiliated with Students for a Democratic Society, the
Weatherman, the Communist Party or any other
organization advocating revolutionary overthrow of the
United States, describing for the grand jury when these
incidents occurred, where they occurred, who was
present and what was said by all persons there and what
you did at the time that you were in these meetings,
groups, associations or conversations."
Strict Secrecy
Grand jury investigations, both state and federal,
usually are conducted in strict secrecy. The public rarely
hears about them until they return indictments, which
are announced in open court, or, in the case of a "sealed
indictment," after the suspect is taken into custody.
The theory behind the secrecy is that investigations
that do not result in indictments or criminal complaints
may unfairly damage the reputations of those who have
been investigated.
However, many activists now contend that the secrecy

contact with, attended meetings conducted by, or
merely allows the government to "hide" what they
consider to be an unjust process from the public view.
Some believe that by bringing the grand jury process to
public attention they can force the government to end
its investigative role.
Many of the investigative grand juries are being run by
prosecuting attorneys from a 14-member section of the
Justice Department's Internal Security Division (ISD)
known as the Special Litigation Section (SLS). Until
recently, the ISD, which is responsible for prosecuting a
wide variety of crimes, including Selective Service
violations, spent most of its time reviewing FBI reports
about alleged radical activities.
The ISD reportedly maintains extremely close ties to
the FBI and controls the Justice Department's own
intelligence network, the Interdivisional Intelligence
Unit (IDIU). The IDIU has a broad responsibility for
observing anti-war and radical activities.
The SLS is headed by Guy L. Goodwin, a former
assistant U.S. attorney for Kansas now known to amny
activists as a "special prosecutor for the Nixon-Mitchell
gang." The SLS was created, in fact, by the Nixon
administration to prosecute "revolutionary terrorists."
Goodwin's Background
In his official Justice Department biography, Good
win describes himself as "an experienced federal
prosecutor who frequently represents the government in
matters growing out of civil disturbances and terrorist
activities."
In effect the Justice Department's "traveling pro
secutor," Goodwin spends as many as three weeks every
month directing special investigative grand juries from
coast to coast. He has personally conducted some of the
Justice Department's most publicized investigations,
including those of Leslie Bacon, the Berrigan brothers
and the Vietnam Veterans Against the War (VVAW).
Since late 1970, the SLS has been waging a
multi-faceted probe into "underground" revolutionaries
and "terrorists." Prior to that, the ISD and the IDIU
concentrated their efforts on ghetto surveillance and an
apparently fruitless investigation into the Black Panther
Party.
Three Broad Categories
During 1971, for example, at least 13 special federal
grand juries investigated political activists falling into
three broad categories: the "underground" revolu
tionaries (Weatherpeople), anti-war intellectuals (the
"Pentagon Papers"), and the Catholic Left (the Berrigan
brothers).
A recent Daily survey shows that at least eight special
federal grand juries, meeting in six cities, currently are
investigating "underground" revolutionaries — four of
whom are on the FBl's "Ten Most Wanted" list — as well
as political activists' means of support.
One special federal grand jury meeting in San
Francisco has conducted a two-month-long investigation
of Venceremos' alleged role in the escape of Chino
prison inmate Ronald Wayne Beaty. A prison guard
trainee was killed during that lynching. Two Los Altos
residents, neither of whom belongs to the revolutionary
organization, were jailed six weeks ago for refusing to
answer questions before this grand jury.
Weatherpeople Probe
A second grand jury in San Francisco apparently is
operating as a "tandem" grand jury with another
meeting in Detroit, Mich. These two grand juries are
attempting to track down and indict a long list of federal
fugitives, many of them identified as Weatherpeople,
including Mark Rudd, Kathy Boudin and Bernadine
Dohrn.
One man from Oregon was jailed in early January for
refusing to testify before this San Francisco grand jury.
Three others testified in December only after the
Supreme Court refused to consider their cases.
The Detroit grand jury recently returned a single
count indictment against 15 people charging them with
conspiring to bomb police facilities, a police officer's
home and military facilities in several states.
'War Council'
Most of those named in the Detroit indictment are
identified as Weatherpeople who attended a January,
1970 "war council" at Flint, Mich. Newspaper reports

indicated that some 400 people attended that
conference.
The 15 defendants — four of whom are in custody,
according to late reports - are charged with conspiring
to make and possess unregistered explosives and to
transport them across state lines "to destroy police
installations and other civic, business and educational
buildings throughout the country and to kill and injure
persons therein."
Another 24 persons are named in the indictment as
co-conspirators. However, no charges have been lodged
against members of this group.
IRA Gun-Running
A third grand jury in San Francisco is investigating
alleged gun-running by American citizens acting on
behalf of the outlawed Irish Republican Army. Most of
the witnesses who have appeared before this grand jury
were subpoenaed from Butte, Mont., a community with
a large Irish-American population. Several persons were
jailed in November for refusing to answer questions
before this grand jury, which, like the other two sitting
in San Francisco, has returned no indictments.
Other grand juries presently are meeting in Cleveland,
Ohio (another Weatherpeople investigation), Los Angeles
(various activities in the student community of Isla
Vista, Calif.), Ft. Worth, Tex. (Irish Republican Army
activities centered in New York City), and a small town
in Arizona (the Beaty escape). '
Several grand juries scattered throughout the country
investigated VVAW activities during the 1972 Republi
can National Convention at Miami Beach, Fla., but these
panels apparently have not met recently.
VVAW Grand Juries
However, one of the VVAW grand juries indicted or
re-indicted seven VVAW members in December for
allegedly plotting to disrupt the convention. One
non-member was also indicted.
The eight are charged with conspiring to attack Miami
Beach police stations with automatic weapons, fire
bombs and other devices. Two of those indicted are
regional VVAW coordinators.
Currently, there appear to be no ongoing investiga
tions of the Catholic Left. The most recent investigation
into anti-war intellectuals ended in late November after a
Harvard University researcher spent six days in jail for
refusing to answer questions before a Boston grand jury
apparently investigating the leak of the "Pentagon
Papers" to The New York Times.
Harassment
Many witnesses before SLS grand juries believe
questions are asked of them not for fact-finding but for
purposes of harassment. Their lawyers appear to have no
great respect for the section's prosecutorial ability or
tactics. These lawyers point out that many convictions
(usually on conspiracy charges) obtained by the SLS are
reversed on appeal.
One lawyer, who asked not to be named, said the ISD
"is the dumping grounds for the entire Justice
Department." "
Sen. Sam Ervin (D.-N.C.), one of the Senate's
watch-dogs of personal liberties, recently told the Los
Angeles Times:
"We ought to put the grand jury back into its proper
function. In the federal system, the function of the
grand jury is being perverted. The grand jury is supposed
to be a judicial body. It is not supposed to go out and
Find evidence for the government."
'Chosen Instrument'
Frank J. Donner, who heads the American Civil
Liberties Union's Project on Political Surveillance, views
the SLS grand juries "as a 'chosen instrument' of a
[Nixon] administration strategy to curb dissent and to
intimidate and demoralize radicals.

"Allegations that any of our grand juries are being
utilized to harass, intimidate, or otherwise discourage
citizens from exercising their constitutional freedoms are
absurd.
"What makes this strategy so effective," Donner
wrote last year, "is that the federal prosecuting officials
who themselves have no power of subpoena - are
using the coercive powers of the grand jury for police
and intelligence purposes."
Donner believes that the Justice Department is
facilitating its prosecutions of radicals by constructing
intricate "sociograms," which he defines this way:
Goodwin Denies Sociograms
"It is all a matter of friendships, affiliations,
communications, meetings, travels, finances, beliefs,
habits . . . This personal and seemingly innocuous data is
then fed into the IDIU data bank .. .[g] rand jury
testimony is thereby integrated with intelligence
gathered from all other sources, including illegal
electronic surveillance conducted by state as well as
federal authorities."
Prosecutor Goodwin, known at the Justice Depart
ment for his "computer-like mind," denies that SLS is
constructing sociograms. He told the Los Angeles Times,
"I don't even know what a sociogram is."
In a letter to this reporter about the San Francisco
Weatherpeople grand jury, Goodwin commented:
"I can assure you that the singular purpose of that
grand jury as well as other grand juries ~ . (I] have been
involved in is to investigate and present evidence of
specific violations of Federal law. Allegations that this or
any of our grand juries are being utilized to harass,
intimidate or otherwise discourage citizens, whatever
their political persuasion may be, from exercising their
constitutional freedoms arc absurd."

The Department of Justice's increased use of special
investigative grand juries in recent months has become a
major focal point for civil libertarians and political
activists.
The new wave of grand juries apparently has two
primary targets, "organized crime" and the "New Left."
In the East, grand juries generally devote more energy to
investigating "organized crime," while West Coast grand
juries, particularly those in the Bay Area, have
concentrated on crimes allegedly committed by political
activists.
Objections to grand juries fall into two basic
categories: procedural and motivational. Three groups in
particular have raised vocal objections to the grand
juries' present activities:
— Political activists and their attorneys frequently
charge that grand juries are used for purposes of
harassment, to conduct investigations that the FBI has
been unable to complete, and that prosecutors
frequently use "tainted evidence" — that is, evidence
that has been gathered illegally - during their
presentations.
— Newspaper reporters, writers, editors, and, in some
cases, academicians c}aim that their forced "third party"
testimony before grand juries interferes with their ability
to maintain confidential relationships with news sources.
— Civil libertarians and some law professors complain
that grand juries are now being utilized so extensively
that they now represent a major threat to individual
liberties.
Says one criminal legal scholar: "The grand jury has
always been uniquely susceptible to abuse. Occasional
abuses have always occurred, but today we are seeing
abuses on a scale and with a dramatic intensity unlike
anything we've ever seen before."
In California, as elsewhere, there are two types of
grand juries, county and federal. In theory, the federal
grand jury's sole function is to determine whether or not
there is sufficient evidence to bring federal charges
against people, groups or corporations.
The county grand jury, however, is charged with (1)
considering criminal indictments for violations of the
state penal code; (2) considering misdemeanor violations
committed in or triable in the county; (3) evaluating the
needs of the county; (4) investigating the expenditure of
public monies; and (5) investigating the conduct of
public officials.
Both types of grand juries usually are composed of 23
people. County grand juries are often selected from a list
of prominent citizens nominated on an annual basis by
superior court judges. Federal grand juries are selected at
random from voter registration lists.
Increasing Disuse
The county grand jury has fallen into increasing disuse
insofar as criminal matters are involved. Local
prosecutors (district or state's attorneys) usually find it
easier — and speedier — to proceed by direct accusation
(known as an "information") rather than to go through
a grand jury investigation. In California, about 95
percent of all cases are prosecuted in this manner.
County grand juries, therefore, usually spend most of
their time investigating matters related to county
government, such as local jail operations, airports and
port authorities, and school budgets.

"By and large, grand juries do as they are requested
by prosecutors and they do it with cafeteria speed."
On the federal level, the Organized Crime Control Act
of 1970 in effect mandated U.S. District Courts to
empanel special investigative grand juries on a regular
basis. These grand juries meet specifically to look into
"organized crime" and the "New Left," the latter an
area that appears to frustrate most Justice Department
investigations.
Deter Prosecutors
When grand juries first became institutionalized in this
country, one of their purposes was to deter zealous
prosecutors and to protect the citizenry. As recently as
1972, the Supreme Court said of the grand jury:
"Historically, this body has been regarded as a
primary security to the innocent against hasty, malicious
and oppressive persecution; it serves the invaluable
function in our society of standing between the accuser
and the accused, whether the latter be an individual,
minority group, or other, to determine whether a charge
is founded upon reason or was dictated by an
intimidating power or by malice and personal ill will."
Amsterdam's Views
Law Prof. Anthony G. Amsterdam, some of whose
clients have been among those subpoenaed before
federal investigative grand juries, believes prosecutors
completely dominate the proceedings. Says Amsterdam:
"Lawyers who run grand juries are in a situation as
close to that of God as any human being on this earth.
That is to say that they arc all-powerful within their own
little world, because the grand jury essentially gets no
instructions on the law from anybody but the lawyer
who is running it.

"The [prosecutor] decides when (the grand jurors]
shall convene, when they shall take breakfast, when they
shall take lunch, when they shall go to the bathroom,
when they shall adjourn. He issues the subpoenas and
there's simply nobody to quarrel with him.
Omnipotent Prosecutors
"There' is no judge to restrict what he does,"
Amsterdam asserts. "The grand jurors . .. seldom take
an independent stand. So what happens is that the
prosecutor becomes omnipotent and he becomes infused
with a sense of his omnipotence. That's simply what the
grand jury does to you."
Witnesses before a grand jury are interrogated under
oath secretly by the prosecutor. The grand jurors
themselves ask questions only infrequently. Witness'
attorneys are not permitted in the grand jury's hearing
room. Someone suspected of a particular crime does not
have the right to appear before a grand jury. If one is
subpoenaed (ordered by the court to testify), he may
invoke the Fifth Amendment. But without their lawyers

"Lawyers who run grand juries are in a situation as close to that of God as any human being on earth."

present, most witnesses are reluctant or unable to
exercise their rights.
A witness can be compelled to testify if he is granted
immunity. Such immunity does not protect him from
prosecution; he may not, however, be prosecuted on the
basis of testimony he is compelled to give. Failure to
testify after immunity has been granted usually results in
a witness being cited for contempt of court. Sentences in
cases such as these usually run as long as 18 months, the
maximum term of a grand jury.
'Inevitable'
Amsterdam believes that the outcry raised by radicals
and civil libertarians "is simply the inevitable result of
the bureaucratic focusing of grand juries on radicals."
"The hardline law and order attitude of Mitchell and
Kleindienst is totally unsolicitous of individual rights,"
he contends. "They simply could not give less of a damn
if people are destroyed even though there isn't the least
investigative reason for calling them.
"The present attitude of the Nixon administration
is . . . that if there's any convenience interest at all to be
served by issuing a subpoena, you don't even think
about the weight on the other side. You go ahead and
issue it."
Tandem Grand Juries
Tandem (cooperative) grand juries, Amsterdam says,
are "traditional" but "not legally proper."
"You've got a nationwide network of grand juries all
engaged in the quest after subversives, so that the kind
of cooperation which you fortuitously would get in
individual cases between one grand jury and another in
the old days was nothing compared to the cooperation
between the grand juries that's going on now."
But John Kaplan, another Law School professor and
former federal prosecutor, disagrees with Amsterdam
and others who are concerned about possible grand jury
abuse. The only reason that recent grand juries have
attracted attention, he believes, "is that radicals scream
louder than other people."
'Witch-Hunt'
"Many is the case 1 know when there was a grand jury
investigation that was denounced near and far as an
absolute witch-hunt persecution. Finally the grand jury
returned an indictment, and everyone trooped in and
pleaded guilty," he says
Kaplan terms the citizen-protection aspect of the
grand jury system "quite unimportant. The purpose of
the [federal] grand jury is to pass on [approve]
indictments brought before it by the prosecutor."
He concedes, however, that grand juries only rarely
turned down his requests for indictments. Some of his
presentations, he says, lasted "maybe 20 seconds."
'Cafeteria Speed'
"By and large," he wrote several years ago, "grand
juries today do as they are requested by prosecutors and
they do it with cafeteria speed."
Kaplan says that in the federal system the grand jury
is used as an executive subpoena by agencies such as the
Justice Department and the FBI which, by themselves,
cannot compel testimony.
That practice, among others, leads to "an awful lot of
violations of what we think are normally regarded as the
rights of the citizen," he says. "There's no doubt about
that. Maybe our ideas as to what have been the rights of
the citizen are not really accurate."
On both the county and federal level, it is possible
that a suspect may be indicted in connection with a
crime without even knowing that a grand jury has
considered his case. The suspect does not have the right
to cross-examine witnesses who testified against him.
In some states (excluding California), a suspect may
never see a transcript of the grand jury hearing at which
he was indicted. There are also different evidentiary
rules that apply to grand jury proceedings, so evidence
inadmissible during a trial, such as hearsay, may be used
during a grand jury proceeding.
Broad Questions
Prosecutors frequently ask witnesses questions framed
in the broadest possible terms. One question asked of a
witness during a 1970 probe into the Weatherman
organization was as follows:
"I want you to describe for the grand jury every
occasion during the year 1970 when you have been in

attended by, or been any place when any individual
spoke whom you knew to be associated with or
affiliated with Students for a Democratic Society, the
Weatherman, the Communist Party or any other
organization advocating revolutionary overthrow of the
United States, describing for the grand jury when these
incidents occurred, where they occurred, who was
present and what was said by all persons there and what
you did at the time that you were in these meetings,
groups, associations or conversations."
Strict Secrecy
Grand jury investigations, both state and federal,
usually are conducted in strict secrecy. The public rarely
hears about them until they return indictments, which
are announced in open court, or, in the case of a "sealed
indictment," after the suspect is taken into custody.
The theory behind the secrecy is that investigations
that do not result in indictments or criminal complaints
may unfairly damage the reputations of those who have
been investigated.
However, many activists now contend that the secrecy

contact with, attended meetings conducted by, or
merely allows the government to "hide" what they
consider to be an unjust process from the public view.
Some believe that by bringing the grand jury process to
public attention they can force the government to end
its investigative role.
Many of the investigative grand juries are being run by
prosecuting attorneys from a 14-member section of the
Justice Department's Internal Security Division (ISD)
known as the Special Litigation Section (SLS). Until
recently, the ISD, which is responsible for prosecuting a
wide variety of crimes, including Selective Service
violations, spent most of its time reviewing FBI reports
about alleged radical activities.
The ISD reportedly maintains extremely close ties to
the FBI and controls the Justice Department's own
intelligence network, the Interdivisional Intelligence
Unit (IDIU). The IDIU has a broad responsibility for
observing anti-war and radical activities.
The SLS is headed by Guy L. Goodwin, a former
assistant U.S. attorney for Kansas now known to amny
activists as a "special prosecutor for the Nixon-Mitchell
gang." The SLS was created, in fact, by the Nixon
administration to prosecute "revolutionary terrorists."
Goodwin's Background
In his official Justice Department biography, Good
win describes himself as "an experienced federal
prosecutor who frequently represents the government in
matters growing out of civil disturbances and terrorist
activities."
In effect the Justice Department's "traveling pro
secutor," Goodwin spends as many as three weeks every
month directing special investigative grand juries from
coast to coast. He has personally conducted some of the
Justice Department's most publicized investigations,
including those of Leslie Bacon, the Berrigan brothers
and the Vietnam Veterans Against the War (VVAW).
Since late 1970, the SLS has been waging a
multi-faceted probe into "underground" revolutionaries
and "terrorists." Prior to that, the ISD and the IDIU
concentrated their efforts on ghetto surveillance and an
apparently fruitless investigation into the Black Panther
Party.
Three Broad Categories
During 1971, for example, at least 13 special federal
grand juries investigated political activists falling into
three broad categories: the "underground" revolu
tionaries (Weatherpeople), anti-war intellectuals (the
"Pentagon Papers"), and the Catholic Left (the Berrigan
brothers).
A recent Daily survey shows that at least eight special
federal grand juries, meeting in six cities, currently are
investigating "underground" revolutionaries — four of
whom are on the FBl's "Ten Most Wanted" list — as well
as political activists' means of support.
One special federal grand jury meeting in San
Francisco has conducted a two-month-long investigation
of Venceremos' alleged role in the escape of Chino
prison inmate Ronald Wayne Beaty. A prison guard
trainee was killed during that lynching. Two Los Altos
residents, neither of whom belongs to the revolutionary
organization, were jailed six weeks ago for refusing to
answer questions before this grand jury.
Weatherpeople Probe
A second grand jury in San Francisco apparently is
operating as a "tandem" grand jury with another
meeting in Detroit, Mich. These two grand juries are
attempting to track down and indict a long list of federal
fugitives, many of them identified as Weatherpeople,
including Mark Rudd, Kathy Boudin and Bernadine
Dohrn.
One man from Oregon was jailed in early January for
refusing to testify before this San Francisco grand jury.
Three others testified in December only after the
Supreme Court refused to consider their cases.
The Detroit grand jury recently returned a single
count indictment against 15 people charging them with
conspiring to bomb police facilities, a police officer's
home and military facilities in several states.
'War Council'
Most of those named in the Detroit indictment are
identified as Weatherpeople who attended a January,
1970 "war council" at Flint, Mich. Newspaper reports

indicated that some 400 people attended that
conference.
The 15 defendants — four of whom are in custody,
according to late reports - are charged with conspiring
to make and possess unregistered explosives and to
transport them across state lines "to destroy police
installations and other civic, business and educational
buildings throughout the country and to kill and injure
persons therein."
Another 24 persons are named in the indictment as
co-conspirators. However, no charges have been lodged
against members of this group.
IRA Gun-Running
A third grand jury in San Francisco is investigating
alleged gun-running by American citizens acting on
behalf of the outlawed Irish Republican Army. Most of
the witnesses who have appeared before this grand jury
were subpoenaed from Butte, Mont., a community with
a large Irish-American population. Several persons were
jailed in November for refusing to answer questions
before this grand jury, which, like the other two sitting
in San Francisco, has returned no indictments.
Other grand juries presently are meeting in Cleveland,
Ohio (another Weatherpeople investigation), Los Angeles
(various activities in the student community of Isla
Vista, Calif.), Ft. Worth, Tex. (Irish Republican Army
activities centered in New York City), and a small town
in Arizona (the Beaty escape). '
Several grand juries scattered throughout the country
investigated VVAW activities during the 1972 Republi
can National Convention at Miami Beach, Fla., but these
panels apparently have not met recently.
VVAW Grand Juries
However, one of the VVAW grand juries indicted or
re-indicted seven VVAW members in December for
allegedly plotting to disrupt the convention. One
non-member was also indicted.
The eight are charged with conspiring to attack Miami
Beach police stations with automatic weapons, fire
bombs and other devices. Two of those indicted are
regional VVAW coordinators.
Currently, there appear to be no ongoing investiga
tions of the Catholic Left. The most recent investigation
into anti-war intellectuals ended in late November after a
Harvard University researcher spent six days in jail for
refusing to answer questions before a Boston grand jury
apparently investigating the leak of the "Pentagon
Papers" to The New York Times.
Harassment
Many witnesses before SLS grand juries believe
questions are asked of them not for fact-finding but for
purposes of harassment. Their lawyers appear to have no
great respect for the section's prosecutorial ability or
tactics. These lawyers point out that many convictions
(usually on conspiracy charges) obtained by the SLS are
reversed on appeal.
One lawyer, who asked not to be named, said the ISD
"is the dumping grounds for the entire Justice
Department." "
Sen. Sam Ervin (D.-N.C.), one of the Senate's
watch-dogs of personal liberties, recently told the Los
Angeles Times:
"We ought to put the grand jury back into its proper
function. In the federal system, the function of the
grand jury is being perverted. The grand jury is supposed
to be a judicial body. It is not supposed to go out and
Find evidence for the government."
'Chosen Instrument'
Frank J. Donner, who heads the American Civil
Liberties Union's Project on Political Surveillance, views
the SLS grand juries "as a 'chosen instrument' of a
[Nixon] administration strategy to curb dissent and to
intimidate and demoralize radicals.

"Allegations that any of our grand juries are being
utilized to harass, intimidate, or otherwise discourage
citizens from exercising their constitutional freedoms are
absurd.
"What makes this strategy so effective," Donner
wrote last year, "is that the federal prosecuting officials

and intelligence purposes."
Donner believes that the Justice Department is
facilitating its prosecutions of radicals by constructing
intricate "sociograms," which he defines this way:

empanel special investigative grand juries on a regular

"organized crime" and the "New Left," the latter an
area that appears to frustrate most Justice Department
investigations.
Deter Prosecutors
When grand juries first became institutionalized in this
country, one of their purposes was to deter zealous
prosecutors and to protect the citizenry. As recently as
1972, the Supreme Court said of the grand jury:
"Historically, this body has been regarded as a
primary security to the innocent against hasty, malicious
and oppressive persecution; it serves the invaluable
function in our society of standing between the accuser
and the accused, whether the latter be an individual,
minority group, or other, to determine whether a charge
is founded upon reason or was dictated by an
intimidating power or by malice and personal ill will."
Amsterdam's Views
Law Prof. Anthony G. Amsterdam, some of whose
clients have been among those subpoenaed before
federal investigative grand juries, believes prosecutors
completely dominate the proceedings. Says Amsterdam:
"Lawyers who run grand juries are in a situation as
close to that of God as any human being on this earth.
That is to say that they arc all-powerful within their own
little world, because the grand jury essentially gets no
instructions on the law from anybody but the lawyer
who is running it.

"The [prosecutor] decides when (the grand jurors]
shall convene, when they shall take breakfast, when they
shall take lunch, when they shall go to the bathroom,
when they shall adjourn. He issues the subpoenas and
there's simply nobody to quarrel with him.
Omnipotent Prosecutors
"There' is no judge to restrict what he does,"
Amsterdam asserts. "The grand jurors . .. seldom take
an independent stand. So what happens is that the
prosecutor becomes omnipotent and he becomes infused
with a sense of his omnipotence. That's simply what the
grand jury does to you."
Witnesses before a grand jury are interrogated under
oath secretly by the prosecutor. The grand jurors
themselves ask questions only infrequently. Witness'
attorneys are not permitted in the grand jury's hearing
room. Someone suspected of a particular crime does not
have the right to appear before a grand jury. If one is
subpoenaed (ordered by the court to testify), he may
invoke the Fifth Amendment. But without their lawyers

"Lawyers who run grand juries are in a situation as close to that of God as any human being on earth."

present, most witnesses are reluctant or unable to
exercise their rights.
A witness can be compelled to testify if he is granted
immunity. Such immunity does not protect him from
prosecution; he may not, however, be prosecuted on the
basis of testimony he is compelled to give. Failure to
testify after immunity has been granted usually results in
a witness being cited for contempt of court. Sentences in
cases such as these usually run as long as 18 months, the
maximum term of a grand jury.
'Inevitable'
Amsterdam believes that the outcry raised by radicals
and civil libertarians "is simply the inevitable result of
the bureaucratic focusing of grand juries on radicals."
"The hardline law and order attitude of Mitchell and
Kleindienst is totally unsolicitous of individual rights,"
he contends. "They simply could not give less of a damn
if people are destroyed even though there isn't the least
investigative reason for calling them.
"The present attitude of the Nixon administration
is . . . that if there's any convenience interest at all to be
served by issuing a subpoena, you don't even think
about the weight on the other side. You go ahead and
issue it."
Tandem Grand Juries
Tandem (cooperative) grand juries, Amsterdam says,
are "traditional" but "not legally proper."
"You've got a nationwide network of grand juries all
engaged in the quest after subversives, so that the kind
of cooperation which you fortuitously would get in
individual cases between one grand jury and another in
the old days was nothing compared to the cooperation
between the grand juries that's going on now."
But John Kaplan, another Law School professor and
former federal prosecutor, disagrees with Amsterdam
and others who are concerned about possible grand jury
abuse. The only reason that recent grand juries have
attracted attention, he believes, "is that radicals scream
louder than other people."
'Witch-Hunt'
"Many is the case 1 know when there was a grand jury
investigation that was denounced near and far as an
absolute witch-hunt persecution. Finally the grand jury
returned an indictment, and everyone trooped in and
pleaded guilty," he says
Kaplan terms the citizen-protection aspect of the
grand jury system "quite unimportant. The purpose of
the [federal] grand jury is to pass on [approve]
indictments brought before it by the prosecutor."
He concedes, however, that grand juries only rarely
turned down his requests for indictments. Some of his
presentations, he says, lasted "maybe 20 seconds."
'Cafeteria Speed'
"By and large," he wrote several years ago, "grand
juries today do as they are requested by prosecutors and
they do it with cafeteria speed."
Kaplan says that in the federal system the grand jury
is used as an executive subpoena by agencies such as the
Justice Department and the FBI which, by themselves,
cannot compel testimony.
That practice, among others, leads to "an awful lot of
violations of what we think are normally regarded as the
rights of the citizen," he says. "There's no doubt about
that. Maybe our ideas as to what have been the rights of
the citizen are not really accurate."
On both the county and federal level, it is possible
that a suspect may be indicted in connection with a
crime without even knowing that a grand jury has
considered his case. The suspect does not have the right
to cross-examine witnesses who testified against him.
In some states (excluding California), a suspect may
never see a transcript of the grand jury hearing at which
he was indicted. There are also different evidentiary
rules that apply to grand jury proceedings, so evidence
inadmissible during a trial, such as hearsay, may be used
during a grand jury proceeding.
Broad Questions
Prosecutors frequently ask witnesses questions framed
in the broadest possible terms. One question asked of a
witness during a 1970 probe into the Weatherman
organization was as follows:
"I want you to describe for the grand jury every
occasion during the year 1970 when you have been in

attended by, or been any place when any individual
spoke whom you knew to be associated with or
affiliated with Students for a Democratic Society, the
Weatherman, the Communist Party or any other
organization advocating revolutionary overthrow of the
United States, describing for the grand jury when these
incidents occurred, where they occurred, who was
present and what was said by all persons there and what
you did at the time that you were in these meetings,
groups, associations or conversations."
Strict Secrecy
Grand jury investigations, both state and federal,
usually are conducted in strict secrecy. The public rarely
hears about them until they return indictments, which
are announced in open court, or, in the case of a "sealed
indictment," after the suspect is taken into custody.
The theory behind the secrecy is that investigations
that do not result in indictments or criminal complaints
may unfairly damage the reputations of those who have
been investigated.
However, many activists now contend that the secrecy

contact with, attended meetings conducted by, or
merely allows the government to "hide" what they
consider to be an unjust process from the public view.
Some believe that by bringing the grand jury process to
public attention they can force the government to end
its investigative role.
Many of the investigative grand juries are being run by
prosecuting attorneys from a 14-member section of the
Justice Department's Internal Security Division (ISD)
known as the Special Litigation Section (SLS). Until
recently, the ISD, which is responsible for prosecuting a
wide variety of crimes, including Selective Service
violations, spent most of its time reviewing FBI reports
about alleged radical activities.
The ISD reportedly maintains extremely close ties to
the FBI and controls the Justice Department's own
intelligence network, the Interdivisional Intelligence
Unit (IDIU). The IDIU has a broad responsibility for
observing anti-war and radical activities.
The SLS is headed by Guy L. Goodwin, a former
assistant U.S. attorney for Kansas now known to amny
activists as a "special prosecutor for the Nixon-Mitchell
gang." The SLS was created, in fact, by the Nixon
administration to prosecute "revolutionary terrorists."
Goodwin's Background
In his official Justice Department biography, Good
win describes himself as "an experienced federal
prosecutor who frequently represents the government in
matters growing out of civil disturbances and terrorist
activities."
In effect the Justice Department's "traveling pro
secutor," Goodwin spends as many as three weeks every
month directing special investigative grand juries from
coast to coast. He has personally conducted some of the
Justice Department's most publicized investigations,
including those of Leslie Bacon, the Berrigan brothers
and the Vietnam Veterans Against the War (VVAW).
Since late 1970, the SLS has been waging a
multi-faceted probe into "underground" revolutionaries
and "terrorists." Prior to that, the ISD and the IDIU
concentrated their efforts on ghetto surveillance and an
apparently fruitless investigation into the Black Panther
Party.
Three Broad Categories
During 1971, for example, at least 13 special federal
grand juries investigated political activists falling into
three broad categories: the "underground" revolu
tionaries (Weatherpeople), anti-war intellectuals (the
"Pentagon Papers"), and the Catholic Left (the Berrigan
brothers).
A recent Daily survey shows that at least eight special
federal grand juries, meeting in six cities, currently are
investigating "underground" revolutionaries — four of
whom are on the FBl's "Ten Most Wanted" list — as well
as political activists' means of support.
One special federal grand jury meeting in San
Francisco has conducted a two-month-long investigation
of Venceremos' alleged role in the escape of Chino
prison inmate Ronald Wayne Beaty. A prison guard
trainee was killed during that lynching. Two Los Altos
residents, neither of whom belongs to the revolutionary
organization, were jailed six weeks ago for refusing to
answer questions before this grand jury.
Weatherpeople Probe
A second grand jury in San Francisco apparently is
operating as a "tandem" grand jury with another
meeting in Detroit, Mich. These two grand juries are
attempting to track down and indict a long list of federal
fugitives, many of them identified as Weatherpeople,
including Mark Rudd, Kathy Boudin and Bernadine
Dohrn.
One man from Oregon was jailed in early January for
refusing to testify before this San Francisco grand jury.
Three others testified in December only after the
Supreme Court refused to consider their cases.
The Detroit grand jury recently returned a single
count indictment against 15 people charging them with
conspiring to bomb police facilities, a police officer's
home and military facilities in several states.
'War Council'
Most of those named in the Detroit indictment are
identified as Weatherpeople who attended a January,
1970 "war council" at Flint, Mich. Newspaper reports

indicated that some 400 people attended that
conference.
The 15 defendants — four of whom are in custody,
according to late reports - are charged with conspiring
to make and possess unregistered explosives and to
transport them across state lines "to destroy police
installations and other civic, business and educational
buildings throughout the country and to kill and injure
persons therein."
Another 24 persons are named in the indictment as
co-conspirators. However, no charges have been lodged
against members of this group.
IRA Gun-Running
A third grand jury in San Francisco is investigating
alleged gun-running by American citizens acting on
behalf of the outlawed Irish Republican Army. Most of
the witnesses who have appeared before this grand jury
were subpoenaed from Butte, Mont., a community with
a large Irish-American population. Several persons were
jailed in November for refusing to answer questions
before this grand jury, which, like the other two sitting
in San Francisco, has returned no indictments.
Other grand juries presently are meeting in Cleveland,
Ohio (another Weatherpeople investigation), Los Angeles
(various activities in the student community of Isla
Vista, Calif.), Ft. Worth, Tex. (Irish Republican Army
activities centered in New York City), and a small town
in Arizona (the Beaty escape). '
Several grand juries scattered throughout the country
investigated VVAW activities during the 1972 Republi
can National Convention at Miami Beach, Fla., but these
panels apparently have not met recently.
VVAW Grand Juries
However, one of the VVAW grand juries indicted or
re-indicted seven VVAW members in December for
allegedly plotting to disrupt the convention. One
non-member was also indicted.
The eight are charged with conspiring to attack Miami
Beach police stations with automatic weapons, fire
bombs and other devices. Two of those indicted are
regional VVAW coordinators.
Currently, there appear to be no ongoing investiga
tions of the Catholic Left. The most recent investigation
into anti-war intellectuals ended in late November after a
Harvard University researcher spent six days in jail for
refusing to answer questions before a Boston grand jury
apparently investigating the leak of the "Pentagon
Papers" to The New York Times.
Harassment
Many witnesses before SLS grand juries believe
questions are asked of them not for fact-finding but for
purposes of harassment. Their lawyers appear to have no
great respect for the section's prosecutorial ability or
tactics. These lawyers point out that many convictions
(usually on conspiracy charges) obtained by the SLS are
reversed on appeal.
One lawyer, who asked not to be named, said the ISD
"is the dumping grounds for the entire Justice
Department." "
Sen. Sam Ervin (D.-N.C.), one of the Senate's
watch-dogs of personal liberties, recently told the Los
Angeles Times:
"We ought to put the grand jury back into its proper
function. In the federal system, the function of the
grand jury is being perverted. The grand jury is supposed
to be a judicial body. It is not supposed to go out and
Find evidence for the government."
'Chosen Instrument'
Frank J. Donner, who heads the American Civil
Liberties Union's Project on Political Surveillance, views
the SLS grand juries "as a 'chosen instrument' of a
[Nixon] administration strategy to curb dissent and to
intimidate and demoralize radicals.

"Allegations that any of our grand juries are being
utilized to harass, intimidate, or otherwise discourage
citizens from exercising their constitutional freedoms are
absurd.
"What makes this strategy so effective," Donner
wrote last year, "is that the federal prosecuting officials
who themselves have no power of subpoena - are
using the coercive powers of the grand jury for police
and intelligence purposes."
Donner believes that the Justice Department is
facilitating its prosecutions of radicals by constructing
intricate "sociograms," which he defines this way:
Goodwin Denies Sociograms
"It is all a matter of friendships, affiliations,
communications, meetings, travels, finances, beliefs,
habits . . . This personal and seemingly innocuous data is
then fed into the IDIU data bank .. .[g] rand jury
testimony is thereby integrated with intelligence
gathered from all other sources, including illegal
electronic surveillance conducted by state as well as
federal authorities."
Prosecutor Goodwin, known at the Justice Depart
ment for his "computer-like mind," denies that SLS is
constructing sociograms. He told the Los Angeles Times,
"I don't even know what a sociogram is."
In a letter to this reporter about the San Francisco
Weatherpeople grand jury, Goodwin commented:
"I can assure you that the singular purpose of that
grand jury as well as other grand juries ~ . (I] have been
involved in is to investigate and present evidence of
specific violations of Federal law. Allegations that this or
any of our grand juries are being utilized to harass,
intimidate or otherwise discourage citizens, whatever
their political persuasion may be, from exercising their
constitutional freedoms arc absurd."

GUV L. GOODWIN
The Department of Justice's increased use of special
investigative grand juries in recent months has become a
major focal point for civil libertarians and political
activists.
The new wave of grand juries apparently has two
primary targets, "organized crime" and the "New Left."
In the East, grand juries generally devote more energy to
investigating "organized crime," while West Coast grand
juries, particularly those in the Bay Area, have
concentrated on crimes allegedly committed by political
activists.
Objections to grand juries fall into two basic
categories: procedural and motivational. Three groups in
particular have raised vocal objections to the grand
juries' present activities:
— Political activists and their attorneys frequently
charge that grand juries are used for purposes of
harassment, to conduct investigations that the FBI has
been unable to complete, and that prosecutors
frequently use "tainted evidence" — that is, evidence
that has been gathered illegally - during their
presentations.
— Newspaper reporters, writers, editors, and, in some
cases, academicians c}aim that their forced "third party"
testimony before grand juries interferes with their ability
to maintain confidential relationships with news sources.
— Civil libertarians and some law professors complain
that grand juries are now being utilized so extensively
that they now represent a major threat to individual
liberties.
Says one criminal legal scholar: "The grand jury has
always been uniquely susceptible to abuse. Occasional
abuses have always occurred, but today we are seeing
abuses on a scale and with a dramatic intensity unlike
anything we've ever seen before."
In California, as elsewhere, there are two types of
grand juries, county and federal. In theory, the federal
grand jury's sole function is to determine whether or not
there is sufficient evidence to bring federal charges
against people, groups or corporations.
The county grand jury, however, is charged with (1)
considering criminal indictments for violations of the
state penal code; (2) considering misdemeanor violations
committed in or triable in the county; (3) evaluating the
needs of the county; (4) investigating the expenditure of
public monies; and (5) investigating the conduct of
public officials.
Both types of grand juries usually are composed of 23
people. County grand juries are often selected from a list
of prominent citizens nominated on an annual basis by
superior court judges. Federal grand juries are selected at
random from voter registration lists.
Increasing Disuse
The county grand jury has fallen into increasing disuse
insofar as criminal matters are involved. Local
prosecutors (district or state's attorneys) usually find it
easier — and speedier — to proceed by direct accusation
(known as an "information") rather than to go through
a grand jury investigation. In California, about 95
percent of all cases are prosecuted in this manner.
County grand juries, therefore, usually spend most of
their time investigating matters related to county
government, such as local jail operations, airports and
port authorities, and school budgets.

"By and large, grand juries do as they are requested
by prosecutors and they do it with cafeteria speed."
On the federal level, the Organized Crime Control Act
of 1970 in effect mandated U.S. District Courts to
empanel special investigative grand juries on a regular
basis. These grand juries meet specifically to look into
"organized crime" and the "New Left," the latter an
area that appears to frustrate most Justice Department
investigations.
Deter Prosecutors
When grand juries first became institutionalized in this
country, one of their purposes was to deter zealous
prosecutors and to protect the citizenry. As recently as
1972, the Supreme Court said of the grand jury:
"Historically, this body has been regarded as a
primary security to the innocent against hasty, malicious
and oppressive persecution; it serves the invaluable
function in our society of standing between the accuser
and the accused, whether the latter be an individual,
minority group, or other, to determine whether a charge
is founded upon reason or was dictated by an
intimidating power or by malice and personal ill will."
Amsterdam's Views
Law Prof. Anthony G. Amsterdam, some of whose
clients have been among those subpoenaed before
federal investigative grand juries, believes prosecutors
completely dominate the proceedings. Says Amsterdam:
"Lawyers who run grand juries are in a situation as
close to that of God as any human being on this earth.
That is to say that they arc all-powerful within their own
little world, because the grand jury essentially gets no
instructions on the law from anybody but the lawyer
who is running it.

"The [prosecutor] decides when (the grand jurors]

present, most witnesses are reluctant or unable to
exercise their rights.
A witness can be compelled to testify if he is granted
immunity. Such immunity does not protect him from
prosecution; he may not, however, be prosecuted on the
basis of testimony he is compelled to give. Failure to
testify after immunity has been granted usually results in
a witness being cited for contempt of court. Sentences in
cases such as these usually run as long as 18 months, the
maximum term of a grand jury.
'Inevitable'
Amsterdam believes that the outcry raised by radicals
and civil libertarians "is simply the inevitable result of
the bureaucratic focusing of grand juries on radicals."
"The hardline law and order attitude of Mitchell and
Kleindienst is totally unsolicitous of individual rights,"
he contends. "They simply could not give less of a damn

"The present attitude of the Nixon administration
is . . . that if there's any convenience interest at all to be
served by issuing a subpoena, you don't even think
about the weight on the other side. You go ahead and
issue it."
Tandem Grand Juries
Tandem (cooperative) grand juries, Amsterdam says,
are "traditional" but "not legally proper."
"You've got a nationwide network of grand juries all
engaged in the quest after subversives, so that the kind
of cooperation which you fortuitously would get in
individual cases between one grand jury and another in
the old days was nothing compared to the cooperation
between the grand juries that's going on now."
But John Kaplan, another Law School professor and
former federal prosecutor, disagrees with Amsterdam
and others who are concerned about possible grand jury
abuse. The only reason that recent grand juries have
attracted attention, he believes, "is that radicals scream
louder than other people."
'Witch-Hunt'
"Many is the case 1 know when there was a grand jury
investigation that was denounced near and far as an
absolute witch-hunt persecution. Finally the grand jury
returned an indictment, and everyone trooped in and
pleaded guilty," he says
Kaplan terms the citizen-protection aspect of the
grand jury system "quite unimportant. The purpose of
the [federal] grand jury is to pass on [approve]
indictments brought before it by the prosecutor."
He concedes, however, that grand juries only rarely
turned down his requests for indictments. Some of his
presentations, he says, lasted "maybe 20 seconds."
'Cafeteria Speed'
"By and large," he wrote several years ago, "grand
juries today do as they are requested by prosecutors and
they do it with cafeteria speed."
Kaplan says that in the federal system the grand jury
is used as an executive subpoena by agencies such as the
Justice Department and the FBI which, by themselves,
cannot compel testimony.
That practice, among others, leads to "an awful lot of
violations of what we think are normally regarded as the
rights of the citizen," he says. "There's no doubt about
that. Maybe our ideas as to what have been the rights of
the citizen are not really accurate."
On both the county and federal level, it is possible
that a suspect may be indicted in connection with a
crime without even knowing that a grand jury has
considered his case. The suspect does not have the right
to cross-examine witnesses who testified against him.
In some states (excluding California), a suspect may
never see a transcript of the grand jury hearing at which
he was indicted. There are also different evidentiary
rules that apply to grand jury proceedings, so evidence
inadmissible during a trial, such as hearsay, may be used
during a grand jury proceeding.
Broad Questions
Prosecutors frequently ask witnesses questions framed
in the broadest possible terms. One question asked of a
witness during a 1970 probe into the Weatherman
organization was as follows:
"I want you to describe for the grand jury every
occasion during the year 1970 when you have been in

attended by, or been any place when any individual
spoke whom you knew to be associated with or
affiliated with Students for a Democratic Society, the
Weatherman, the Communist Party or any other
organization advocating revolutionary overthrow of the
United States, describing for the grand jury when these
incidents occurred, where they occurred, who was
present and what was said by all persons there and what
you did at the time that you were in these meetings,
groups, associations or conversations."
Strict Secrecy
Grand jury investigations, both state and federal,
usually are conducted in strict secrecy. The public rarely
hears about them until they return indictments, which
are announced in open court, or, in the case of a "sealed
indictment," after the suspect is taken into custody.
The theory behind the secrecy is that investigations
that do not result in indictments or criminal complaints
may unfairly damage the reputations of those who have
been investigated.
However, many activists now contend that the secrecy

contact with, attended meetings conducted by, or
merely allows the government to "hide" what they
consider to be an unjust process from the public view.
Some believe that by bringing the grand jury process to
public attention they can force the government to end
its investigative role.
Many of the investigative grand juries are being run by
prosecuting attorneys from a 14-member section of the
Justice Department's Internal Security Division (ISD)
known as the Special Litigation Section (SLS). Until
recently, the ISD, which is responsible for prosecuting a
wide variety of crimes, including Selective Service
violations, spent most of its time reviewing FBI reports
about alleged radical activities.
The ISD reportedly maintains extremely close ties to
the FBI and controls the Justice Department's own
intelligence network, the Interdivisional Intelligence
Unit (IDIU). The IDIU has a broad responsibility for
observing anti-war and radical activities.
The SLS is headed by Guy L. Goodwin, a former
assistant U.S. attorney for Kansas now known to amny
activists as a "special prosecutor for the Nixon-Mitchell
gang." The SLS was created, in fact, by the Nixon
administration to prosecute "revolutionary terrorists."
Goodwin's Background
In his official Justice Department biography, Good
win describes himself as "an experienced federal
prosecutor who frequently represents the government in
matters growing out of civil disturbances and terrorist
activities."
In effect the Justice Department's "traveling pro
secutor," Goodwin spends as many as three weeks every
month directing special investigative grand juries from
coast to coast. He has personally conducted some of the
Justice Department's most publicized investigations,
including those of Leslie Bacon, the Berrigan brothers
and the Vietnam Veterans Against the War (VVAW).
Since late 1970, the SLS has been waging a
multi-faceted probe into "underground" revolutionaries
and "terrorists." Prior to that, the ISD and the IDIU
concentrated their efforts on ghetto surveillance and an
apparently fruitless investigation into the Black Panther
Party.
Three Broad Categories
During 1971, for example, at least 13 special federal
grand juries investigated political activists falling into
three broad categories: the "underground" revolu
tionaries (Weatherpeople), anti-war intellectuals (the
"Pentagon Papers"), and the Catholic Left (the Berrigan
brothers).
A recent Daily survey shows that at least eight special
federal grand juries, meeting in six cities, currently are
investigating "underground" revolutionaries — four of
whom are on the FBl's "Ten Most Wanted" list — as well
as political activists' means of support.
One special federal grand jury meeting in San
Francisco has conducted a two-month-long investigation
of Venceremos' alleged role in the escape of Chino
prison inmate Ronald Wayne Beaty. A prison guard
trainee was killed during that lynching. Two Los Altos
residents, neither of whom belongs to the revolutionary
organization, were jailed six weeks ago for refusing to
answer questions before this grand jury.
Weatherpeople Probe
A second grand jury in San Francisco apparently is
operating as a "tandem" grand jury with another
meeting in Detroit, Mich. These two grand juries are
attempting to track down and indict a long list of federal
fugitives, many of them identified as Weatherpeople,
including Mark Rudd, Kathy Boudin and Bernadine
Dohrn.
One man from Oregon was jailed in early January for
refusing to testify before this San Francisco grand jury.
Three others testified in December only after the
Supreme Court refused to consider their cases.
The Detroit grand jury recently returned a single
count indictment against 15 people charging them with
conspiring to bomb police facilities, a police officer's
home and military facilities in several states.
'War Council'
Most of those named in the Detroit indictment are
identified as Weatherpeople who attended a January,
1970 "war council" at Flint, Mich. Newspaper reports

indicated that some 400 people attended that
conference.
The 15 defendants — four of whom are in custody,
according to late reports - are charged with conspiring
to make and possess unregistered explosives and to
transport them across state lines "to destroy police
installations and other civic, business and educational
buildings throughout the country and to kill and injure
persons therein."
Another 24 persons are named in the indictment as
co-conspirators. However, no charges have been lodged
against members of this group.
IRA Gun-Running
A third grand jury in San Francisco is investigating
alleged gun-running by American citizens acting on
behalf of the outlawed Irish Republican Army. Most of
the witnesses who have appeared before this grand jury
were subpoenaed from Butte, Mont., a community with
a large Irish-American population. Several persons were
jailed in November for refusing to answer questions
before this grand jury, which, like the other two sitting
in San Francisco, has returned no indictments.
Other grand juries presently are meeting in Cleveland,
Ohio (another Weatherpeople investigation), Los Angeles
(various activities in the student community of Isla
Vista, Calif.), Ft. Worth, Tex. (Irish Republican Army
activities centered in New York City), and a small town
in Arizona (the Beaty escape). '
Several grand juries scattered throughout the country
investigated VVAW activities during the 1972 Republi
can National Convention at Miami Beach, Fla., but these
panels apparently have not met recently.
VVAW Grand Juries
However, one of the VVAW grand juries indicted or
re-indicted seven VVAW members in December for
allegedly plotting to disrupt the convention. One
non-member was also indicted.
The eight are charged with conspiring to attack Miami
Beach police stations with automatic weapons, fire
bombs and other devices. Two of those indicted are
regional VVAW coordinators.
Currently, there appear to be no ongoing investiga
tions of the Catholic Left. The most recent investigation
into anti-war intellectuals ended in late November after a
Harvard University researcher spent six days in jail for
refusing to answer questions before a Boston grand jury
apparently investigating the leak of the "Pentagon
Papers" to The New York Times.
Harassment
Many witnesses before SLS grand juries believe
questions are asked of them not for fact-finding but for
purposes of harassment. Their lawyers appear to have no
great respect for the section's prosecutorial ability or
tactics. These lawyers point out that many convictions
(usually on conspiracy charges) obtained by the SLS are
reversed on appeal.
One lawyer, who asked not to be named, said the ISD
"is the dumping grounds for the entire Justice
Department." "
Sen. Sam Ervin (D.-N.C.), one of the Senate's
watch-dogs of personal liberties, recently told the Los
Angeles Times:
"We ought to put the grand jury back into its proper
function. In the federal system, the function of the
grand jury is being perverted. The grand jury is supposed
to be a judicial body. It is not supposed to go out and
Find evidence for the government."
'Chosen Instrument'
Frank J. Donner, who heads the American Civil
Liberties Union's Project on Political Surveillance, views
the SLS grand juries "as a 'chosen instrument' of a
[Nixon] administration strategy to curb dissent and to
intimidate and demoralize radicals.

"Allegations that any of our grand juries are being
utilized to harass, intimidate, or otherwise discourage
citizens from exercising their constitutional freedoms are
absurd.
"What makes this strategy so effective," Donner
wrote last year, "is that the federal prosecuting officials
who themselves have no power of subpoena - are
using the coercive powers of the grand jury for police
and intelligence purposes."
Donner believes that the Justice Department is
facilitating its prosecutions of radicals by constructing
intricate "sociograms," which he defines this way:
Goodwin Denies Sociograms
"It is all a matter of friendships, affiliations,
communications, meetings, travels, finances, beliefs,
habits . . . This personal and seemingly innocuous data is
then fed into the IDIU data bank .. .[g] rand jury
testimony is thereby integrated with intelligence
gathered from all other sources, including illegal
electronic surveillance conducted by state as well as
federal authorities."
Prosecutor Goodwin, known at the Justice Depart
ment for his "computer-like mind," denies that SLS is
constructing sociograms. He told the Los Angeles Times,
"I don't even know what a sociogram is."
In a letter to this reporter about the San Francisco
Weatherpeople grand jury, Goodwin commented:
"I can assure you that the singular purpose of that
grand jury as well as other grand juries ~ . (I] have been
involved in is to investigate and present evidence of
specific violations of Federal law. Allegations that this or
any of our grand juries are being utilized to harass,
intimidate or otherwise discourage citizens, whatever
their political persuasion may be, from exercising their
constitutional freedoms arc absurd."

The Department of Justice's increased use of special
investigative grand juries in recent months has become a
major focal point for civil libertarians and political
activists.
The new wave of grand juries apparently has two
primary targets, "organized crime" and the "New Left."
In the East, grand juries generally devote more energy to
investigating "organized crime," while West Coast grand
juries, particularly those in the Bay Area, have
concentrated on crimes allegedly committed by political
activists.
Objections to grand juries fall into two basic
categories: procedural and motivational. Three groups in
particular have raised vocal objections to the grand
juries' present activities:
— Political activists and their attorneys frequently
charge that grand juries are used for purposes of
harassment, to conduct investigations that the FBI has
been unable to complete, and that prosecutors
frequently use "tainted evidence" — that is, evidence
that has been gathered illegally - during their
presentations.
— Newspaper reporters, writers, editors, and, in some
cases, academicians c}aim that their forced "third party"
testimony before grand juries interferes with their ability
to maintain confidential relationships with news sources.
— Civil libertarians and some law professors complain
that grand juries are now being utilized so extensively
that they now represent a major threat to individual
liberties.
Says one criminal legal scholar: "The grand jury has
always been uniquely susceptible to abuse. Occasional
abuses have always occurred, but today we are seeing
abuses on a scale and with a dramatic intensity unlike
anything we've ever seen before."
In California, as elsewhere, there are two types of
grand juries, county and federal. In theory, the federal
grand jury's sole function is to determine whether or not
there is sufficient evidence to bring federal charges
against people, groups or corporations.
The county grand jury, however, is charged with (1)
considering criminal indictments for violations of the
state penal code; (2) considering misdemeanor violations
committed in or triable in the county; (3) evaluating the
needs of the county; (4) investigating the expenditure of
public monies; and (5) investigating the conduct of
public officials.
Both types of grand juries usually are composed of 23
people. County grand juries are often selected from a list
of prominent citizens nominated on an annual basis by
superior court judges. Federal grand juries are selected at
random from voter registration lists.
Increasing Disuse
The county grand jury has fallen into increasing disuse
insofar as criminal matters are involved. Local
prosecutors (district or state's attorneys) usually find it
easier — and speedier — to proceed by direct accusation
(known as an "information") rather than to go through
a grand jury investigation. In California, about 95
percent of all cases are prosecuted in this manner.
County grand juries, therefore, usually spend most of
their time investigating matters related to county
government, such as local jail operations, airports and
port authorities, and school budgets.

"By and large, grand juries do as they are requested
by prosecutors and they do it with cafeteria speed."
On the federal level, the Organized Crime Control Act
of 1970 in effect mandated U.S. District Courts to
empanel special investigative grand juries on a regular
basis. These grand juries meet specifically to look into
"organized crime" and the "New Left," the latter an
area that appears to frustrate most Justice Department
investigations.
Deter Prosecutors
When grand juries first became institutionalized in this
country, one of their purposes was to deter zealous
prosecutors and to protect the citizenry. As recently as
1972, the Supreme Court said of the grand jury:
"Historically, this body has been regarded as a
primary security to the innocent against hasty, malicious
and oppressive persecution; it serves the invaluable
function in our society of standing between the accuser
and the accused, whether the latter be an individual,
minority group, or other, to determine whether a charge
is founded upon reason or was dictated by an
intimidating power or by malice and personal ill will."
Amsterdam's Views
Law Prof. Anthony G. Amsterdam, some of whose
clients have been among those subpoenaed before
federal investigative grand juries, believes prosecutors
completely dominate the proceedings. Says Amsterdam:
"Lawyers who run grand juries are in a situation as
close to that of God as any human being on this earth.
That is to say that they arc all-powerful within their own
little world, because the grand jury essentially gets no
instructions on the law from anybody but the lawyer
who is running it.

"The [prosecutor] decides when (the grand jurors]
shall convene, when they shall take breakfast, when they
shall take lunch, when they shall go to the bathroom,
when they shall adjourn. He issues the subpoenas and
there's simply nobody to quarrel with him.
Omnipotent Prosecutors
"There' is no judge to restrict what he does,"
Amsterdam asserts. "The grand jurors . .. seldom take
an independent stand. So what happens is that the
prosecutor becomes omnipotent and he becomes infused
with a sense of his omnipotence. That's simply what the
grand jury does to you."
Witnesses before a grand jury are interrogated under
oath secretly by the prosecutor. The grand jurors
themselves ask questions only infrequently. Witness'
attorneys are not permitted in the grand jury's hearing
room. Someone suspected of a particular crime does not
have the right to appear before a grand jury. If one is
subpoenaed (ordered by the court to testify), he may
invoke the Fifth Amendment. But without their lawyers

"Lawyers who run grand juries are in a situation as close to that of God as any human being on earth."

present, most witnesses are reluctant or unable to
exercise their rights.
A witness can be compelled to testify if he is granted
immunity. Such immunity does not protect him from
prosecution; he may not, however, be prosecuted on the
basis of testimony he is compelled to give. Failure to
testify after immunity has been granted usually results in
a witness being cited for contempt of court. Sentences in
cases such as these usually run as long as 18 months, the
maximum term of a grand jury.
'Inevitable'
Amsterdam believes that the outcry raised by radicals
and civil libertarians "is simply the inevitable result of
the bureaucratic focusing of grand juries on radicals."
"The hardline law and order attitude of Mitchell and
Kleindienst is totally unsolicitous of individual rights,"
he contends. "They simply could not give less of a damn
if people are destroyed even though there isn't the least
investigative reason for calling them.
"The present attitude of the Nixon administration
is . . . that if there's any convenience interest at all to be
served by issuing a subpoena, you don't even think
about the weight on the other side. You go ahead and
issue it."
Tandem Grand Juries
Tandem (cooperative) grand juries, Amsterdam says,
are "traditional" but "not legally proper."
"You've got a nationwide network of grand juries all
engaged in the quest after subversives, so that the kind
of cooperation which you fortuitously would get in
individual cases between one grand jury and another in
the old days was nothing compared to the cooperation
between the grand juries that's going on now."
But John Kaplan, another Law School professor and
former federal prosecutor, disagrees with Amsterdam
and others who are concerned about possible grand jury
abuse. The only reason that recent grand juries have
attracted attention, he believes, "is that radicals scream
louder than other people."
'Witch-Hunt'
"Many is the case 1 know when there was a grand jury
investigation that was denounced near and far as an
absolute witch-hunt persecution. Finally the grand jury
returned an indictment, and everyone trooped in and
pleaded guilty," he says
Kaplan terms the citizen-protection aspect of the
grand jury system "quite unimportant. The purpose of
the [federal] grand jury is to pass on [approve]
indictments brought before it by the prosecutor."
He concedes, however, that grand juries only rarely
turned down his requests for indictments. Some of his
presentations, he says, lasted "maybe 20 seconds."
'Cafeteria Speed'
"By and large," he wrote several years ago, "grand
juries today do as they are requested by prosecutors and
they do it with cafeteria speed."
Kaplan says that in the federal system the grand jury
is used as an executive subpoena by agencies such as the
Justice Department and the FBI which, by themselves,
cannot compel testimony.
That practice, among others, leads to "an awful lot of
violations of what we think are normally regarded as the
rights of the citizen," he says. "There's no doubt about
that. Maybe our ideas as to what have been the rights of
the citizen are not really accurate."
On both the county and federal level, it is possible
that a suspect may be indicted in connection with a
crime without even knowing that a grand jury has
considered his case. The suspect does not have the right
to cross-examine witnesses who testified against him.
In some states (excluding California), a suspect may
never see a transcript of the grand jury hearing at which
he was indicted. There are also different evidentiary
rules that apply to grand jury proceedings, so evidence
inadmissible during a trial, such as hearsay, may be used
during a grand jury proceeding.
Broad Questions
Prosecutors frequently ask witnesses questions framed
in the broadest possible terms. One question asked of a
witness during a 1970 probe into the Weatherman
organization was as follows:
"I want you to describe for the grand jury every
occasion during the year 1970 when you have been in

attended by, or been any place when any individual
spoke whom you knew to be associated with or
affiliated with Students for a Democratic Society, the
Weatherman, the Communist Party or any other
organization advocating revolutionary overthrow of the
United States, describing for the grand jury when these
incidents occurred, where they occurred, who was
present and what was said by all persons there and what
you did at the time that you were in these meetings,
groups, associations or conversations."
Strict Secrecy
Grand jury investigations, both state and federal,
usually are conducted in strict secrecy. The public rarely
hears about them until they return indictments, which
are announced in open court, or, in the case of a "sealed
indictment," after the suspect is taken into custody.
The theory behind the secrecy is that investigations
that do not result in indictments or criminal complaints
may unfairly damage the reputations of those who have
been investigated.
However, many activists now contend that the secrecy

contact with, attended meetings conducted by, or
merely allows the government to "hide" what they
consider to be an unjust process from the public view.
Some believe that by bringing the grand jury process to
public attention they can force the government to end
its investigative role.
Many of the investigative grand juries are being run by
prosecuting attorneys from a 14-member section of the
Justice Department's Internal Security Division (ISD)
known as the Special Litigation Section (SLS). Until
recently, the ISD, which is responsible for prosecuting a
wide variety of crimes, including Selective Service
violations, spent most of its time reviewing FBI reports
about alleged radical activities.
The ISD reportedly maintains extremely close ties to
the FBI and controls the Justice Department's own
intelligence network, the Interdivisional Intelligence
Unit (IDIU). The IDIU has a broad responsibility for
observing anti-war and radical activities.
The SLS is headed by Guy L. Goodwin, a former
assistant U.S. attorney for Kansas now known to amny
activists as a "special prosecutor for the Nixon-Mitchell
gang." The SLS was created, in fact, by the Nixon
administration to prosecute "revolutionary terrorists."
Goodwin's Background
In his official Justice Department biography, Good
win describes himself as "an experienced federal
prosecutor who frequently represents the government in
matters growing out of civil disturbances and terrorist
activities."
In effect the Justice Department's "traveling pro
secutor," Goodwin spends as many as three weeks every
month directing special investigative grand juries from
coast to coast. He has personally conducted some of the
Justice Department's most publicized investigations,
including those of Leslie Bacon, the Berrigan brothers
and the Vietnam Veterans Against the War (VVAW).
Since late 1970, the SLS has been waging a
multi-faceted probe into "underground" revolutionaries
and "terrorists." Prior to that, the ISD and the IDIU
concentrated their efforts on ghetto surveillance and an
apparently fruitless investigation into the Black Panther
Party.
Three Broad Categories
During 1971, for example, at least 13 special federal
grand juries investigated political activists falling into
three broad categories: the "underground" revolu
tionaries (Weatherpeople), anti-war intellectuals (the
"Pentagon Papers"), and the Catholic Left (the Berrigan
brothers).
A recent Daily survey shows that at least eight special
federal grand juries, meeting in six cities, currently are
investigating "underground" revolutionaries — four of
whom are on the FBl's "Ten Most Wanted" list — as well
as political activists' means of support.
One special federal grand jury meeting in San
Francisco has conducted a two-month-long investigation
of Venceremos' alleged role in the escape of Chino
prison inmate Ronald Wayne Beaty. A prison guard
trainee was killed during that lynching. Two Los Altos
residents, neither of whom belongs to the revolutionary
organization, were jailed six weeks ago for refusing to
answer questions before this grand jury.
Weatherpeople Probe
A second grand jury in San Francisco apparently is
operating as a "tandem" grand jury with another
meeting in Detroit, Mich. These two grand juries are
attempting to track down and indict a long list of federal
fugitives, many of them identified as Weatherpeople,
including Mark Rudd, Kathy Boudin and Bernadine
Dohrn.
One man from Oregon was jailed in early January for
refusing to testify before this San Francisco grand jury.
Three others testified in December only after the
Supreme Court refused to consider their cases.
The Detroit grand jury recently returned a single
count indictment against 15 people charging them with
conspiring to bomb police facilities, a police officer's
home and military facilities in several states.
'War Council'
Most of those named in the Detroit indictment are
identified as Weatherpeople who attended a January,
1970 "war council" at Flint, Mich. Newspaper reports

indicated that some 400 people attended that
conference.
The 15 defendants — four of whom are in custody,
according to late reports - are charged with conspiring
to make and possess unregistered explosives and to
transport them across state lines "to destroy police
installations and other civic, business and educational
buildings throughout the country and to kill and injure
persons therein."
Another 24 persons are named in the indictment as
co-conspirators. However, no charges have been lodged
against members of this group.
IRA Gun-Running
A third grand jury in San Francisco is investigating
alleged gun-running by American citizens acting on
behalf of the outlawed Irish Republican Army. Most of
the witnesses who have appeared before this grand jury
were subpoenaed from Butte, Mont., a community with
a large Irish-American population. Several persons were
jailed in November for refusing to answer questions
before this grand jury, which, like the other two sitting
in San Francisco, has returned no indictments.
Other grand juries presently are meeting in Cleveland,
Ohio (another Weatherpeople investigation), Los Angeles
(various activities in the student community of Isla
Vista, Calif.), Ft. Worth, Tex. (Irish Republican Army
activities centered in New York City), and a small town
in Arizona (the Beaty escape). '
Several grand juries scattered throughout the country
investigated VVAW activities during the 1972 Republi
can National Convention at Miami Beach, Fla., but these
panels apparently have not met recently.
VVAW Grand Juries
However, one of the VVAW grand juries indicted or
re-indicted seven VVAW members in December for
allegedly plotting to disrupt the convention. One
non-member was also indicted.
The eight are charged with conspiring to attack Miami
Beach police stations with automatic weapons, fire
bombs and other devices. Two of those indicted are
regional VVAW coordinators.
Currently, there appear to be no ongoing investiga
tions of the Catholic Left. The most recent investigation
into anti-war intellectuals ended in late November after a
Harvard University researcher spent six days in jail for
refusing to answer questions before a Boston grand jury
apparently investigating the leak of the "Pentagon
Papers" to The New York Times.
Harassment
Many witnesses before SLS grand juries believe
questions are asked of them not for fact-finding but for
purposes of harassment. Their lawyers appear to have no
great respect for the section's prosecutorial ability or
tactics. These lawyers point out that many convictions
(usually on conspiracy charges) obtained by the SLS are
reversed on appeal.
One lawyer, who asked not to be named, said the ISD
"is the dumping grounds for the entire Justice
Department." "
Sen. Sam Ervin (D.-N.C.), one of the Senate's
watch-dogs of personal liberties, recently told the Los
Angeles Times:
"We ought to put the grand jury back into its proper
function. In the federal system, the function of the
grand jury is being perverted. The grand jury is supposed
to be a judicial body. It is not supposed to go out and
Find evidence for the government."
'Chosen Instrument'
Frank J. Donner, who heads the American Civil
Liberties Union's Project on Political Surveillance, views
the SLS grand juries "as a 'chosen instrument' of a
[Nixon] administration strategy to curb dissent and to
intimidate and demoralize radicals.

"Allegations that any of our grand juries are being
utilized to harass, intimidate, or otherwise discourage
citizens from exercising their constitutional freedoms are
absurd.
"What makes this strategy so effective," Donner
wrote last year, "is that the federal prosecuting officials
who themselves have no power of subpoena - are
using the coercive powers of the grand jury for police
and intelligence purposes."
Donner believes that the Justice Department is
facilitating its prosecutions of radicals by constructing
intricate "sociograms," which he defines this way:
Goodwin Denies Sociograms
"It is all a matter of friendships, affiliations,
communications, meetings, travels, finances, beliefs,
habits . . . This personal and seemingly innocuous data is
then fed into the IDIU data bank .. .[g] rand jury
testimony is thereby integrated with intelligence
gathered from all other sources, including illegal
electronic surveillance conducted by state as well as
federal authorities."
Prosecutor Goodwin, known at the Justice Depart
ment for his "computer-like mind," denies that SLS is
constructing sociograms. He told the Los Angeles Times,
"I don't even know what a sociogram is."
In a letter to this reporter about the San Francisco
Weatherpeople grand jury, Goodwin commented:
"I can assure you that the singular purpose of that
grand jury as well as other grand juries ~ . (I] have been
involved in is to investigate and present evidence of
specific violations of Federal law. Allegations that this or
any of our grand juries are being utilized to harass,
intimidate or otherwise discourage citizens, whatever
their political persuasion may be, from exercising their
constitutional freedoms arc absurd."

Law Prof. Anthony G. Amsterdam, some of whose

federal investigative grand juries, believes prosecutors
completely dominate the proceedings. Says Amsterdam:
"Lawyers who run grand juries are in a situation as

present, most witnesses are reluctant or unable to
exercise their rights.
A witness can be compelled to testify if he is granted
immunity. Such immunity does not protect him from
prosecution; he may not, however, be prosecuted on the
basis of testimony he is compelled to give. Failure to
testify after immunity has been granted usually results in
a witness being cited for contempt of court. Sentences in

Broad Questions
Prosecutors frequently ask witnesses questions framed
in the broadest possible terms. One question asked of a
witness during a 1970 probe into the Weatherman
organization was as follows:
"I want you to describe for the grand jury every
occasion during the year 1970 when you have been in

attended by, or been any place when any individual
spoke whom you knew to be associated with or
affiliated with Students for a Democratic Society, the
Weatherman, the Communist Party or any other
organization advocating revolutionary overthrow of the
United States, describing for the grand jury when these
incidents occurred, where they occurred, who was
present and what was said by all persons there and what
you did at the time that you were in these meetings,
groups, associations or conversations."
Strict Secrecy
Grand jury investigations, both state and federal,
usually are conducted in strict secrecy. The public rarely
hears about them until they return indictments, which
are announced in open court, or, in the case of a "sealed

The theory behind the secrecy is that investigations

Some believe that by bringing the grand jury process to
public attention they can force the government to end

Many of the investigative grand juries are being run by
prosecuting attorneys from a 14-member section of the

The SLS is headed by Guy L. Goodwin, a former

administration to prosecute "revolutionary terrorists."

and the Vietnam Veterans Against the War (VVAW).
Since late 1970, the SLS has been waging a
multi-faceted probe into "underground" revolutionaries
and "terrorists." Prior to that, the ISD and the IDIU
concentrated their efforts on ghetto surveillance and an
apparently fruitless investigation into the Black Panther
Party.
Three Broad Categories
During 1971, for example, at least 13 special federal
grand juries investigated political activists falling into
three broad categories: the "underground" revolu
tionaries (Weatherpeople), anti-war intellectuals (the
"Pentagon Papers"), and the Catholic Left (the Berrigan
brothers).
A recent Daily survey shows that at least eight special
federal grand juries, meeting in six cities, currently are
investigating "underground" revolutionaries — four of
whom are on the FBl's "Ten Most Wanted" list — as well
as political activists' means of support.
One special federal grand jury meeting in San
Francisco has conducted a two-month-long investigation
of Venceremos' alleged role in the escape of Chino
prison inmate Ronald Wayne Beaty. A prison guard
trainee was killed during that lynching. Two Los Altos
residents, neither of whom belongs to the revolutionary
organization, were jailed six weeks ago for refusing to
answer questions before this grand jury.
Weatherpeople Probe
A second grand jury in San Francisco apparently is
operating as a "tandem" grand jury with another
meeting in Detroit, Mich. These two grand juries are
attempting to track down and indict a long list of federal
fugitives, many of them identified as Weatherpeople,
including Mark Rudd, Kathy Boudin and Bernadine
Dohrn.
One man from Oregon was jailed in early January for
refusing to testify before this San Francisco grand jury.
Three others testified in December only after the
Supreme Court refused to consider their cases.
The Detroit grand jury recently returned a single
count indictment against 15 people charging them with
conspiring to bomb police facilities, a police officer's
home and military facilities in several states.
'War Council'
Most of those named in the Detroit indictment are
identified as Weatherpeople who attended a January,
1970 "war council" at Flint, Mich. Newspaper reports

indicated that some 400 people attended that
conference.
The 15 defendants — four of whom are in custody,
according to late reports - are charged with conspiring
to make and possess unregistered explosives and to
transport them across state lines "to destroy police
installations and other civic, business and educational
buildings throughout the country and to kill and injure
persons therein."
Another 24 persons are named in the indictment as
co-conspirators. However, no charges have been lodged
against members of this group.
IRA Gun-Running
A third grand jury in San Francisco is investigating
alleged gun-running by American citizens acting on
behalf of the outlawed Irish Republican Army. Most of
the witnesses who have appeared before this grand jury
were subpoenaed from Butte, Mont., a community with
a large Irish-American population. Several persons were
jailed in November for refusing to answer questions
before this grand jury, which, like the other two sitting
in San Francisco, has returned no indictments.
Other grand juries presently are meeting in Cleveland,
Ohio (another Weatherpeople investigation), Los Angeles
(various activities in the student community of Isla
Vista, Calif.), Ft. Worth, Tex. (Irish Republican Army
activities centered in New York City), and a small town
in Arizona (the Beaty escape). '
Several grand juries scattered throughout the country
investigated VVAW activities during the 1972 Republi
can National Convention at Miami Beach, Fla., but these
panels apparently have not met recently.
VVAW Grand Juries
However, one of the VVAW grand juries indicted or
re-indicted seven VVAW members in December for
allegedly plotting to disrupt the convention. One
non-member was also indicted.
The eight are charged with conspiring to attack Miami
Beach police stations with automatic weapons, fire
bombs and other devices. Two of those indicted are
regional VVAW coordinators.
Currently, there appear to be no ongoing investiga
tions of the Catholic Left. The most recent investigation
into anti-war intellectuals ended in late November after a
Harvard University researcher spent six days in jail for
refusing to answer questions before a Boston grand jury
apparently investigating the leak of the "Pentagon
Papers" to The New York Times.
Harassment
Many witnesses before SLS grand juries believe
questions are asked of them not for fact-finding but for
purposes of harassment. Their lawyers appear to have no
great respect for the section's prosecutorial ability or
tactics. These lawyers point out that many convictions
(usually on conspiracy charges) obtained by the SLS are
reversed on appeal.
One lawyer, who asked not to be named, said the ISD
"is the dumping grounds for the entire Justice
Department." "
Sen. Sam Ervin (D.-N.C.), one of the Senate's
watch-dogs of personal liberties, recently told the Los
Angeles Times:
"We ought to put the grand jury back into its proper
function. In the federal system, the function of the
grand jury is being perverted. The grand jury is supposed
to be a judicial body. It is not supposed to go out and
Find evidence for the government."
'Chosen Instrument'
Frank J. Donner, who heads the American Civil
Liberties Union's Project on Political Surveillance, views
the SLS grand juries "as a 'chosen instrument' of a
[Nixon] administration strategy to curb dissent and to
intimidate and demoralize radicals.

"Allegations that any of our grand juries are being
utilized to harass, intimidate, or otherwise discourage
citizens from exercising their constitutional freedoms are
absurd.
"What makes this strategy so effective," Donner
wrote last year, "is that the federal prosecuting officials
who themselves have no power of subpoena - are
using the coercive powers of the grand jury for police
and intelligence purposes."
Donner believes that the Justice Department is
facilitating its prosecutions of radicals by constructing
intricate "sociograms," which he defines this way:
Goodwin Denies Sociograms
"It is all a matter of friendships, affiliations,
communications, meetings, travels, finances, beliefs,
habits . . . This personal and seemingly innocuous data is
then fed into the IDIU data bank .. .[g] rand jury
testimony is thereby integrated with intelligence
gathered from all other sources, including illegal
electronic surveillance conducted by state as well as
federal authorities."
Prosecutor Goodwin, known at the Justice Depart
ment for his "computer-like mind," denies that SLS is
constructing sociograms. He told the Los Angeles Times,
"I don't even know what a sociogram is."
In a letter to this reporter about the San Francisco
Weatherpeople grand jury, Goodwin commented:
"I can assure you that the singular purpose of that
grand jury as well as other grand juries ~ . (I] have been
involved in is to investigate and present evidence of
specific violations of Federal law. Allegations that this or
any of our grand juries are being utilized to harass,
intimidate or otherwise discourage citizens, whatever
their political persuasion may be, from exercising their
constitutional freedoms arc absurd."

GUV L. GOODWIN
The Department of Justice's increased use of special
investigative grand juries in recent months has become a
major focal point for civil libertarians and political
activists.
The new wave of grand juries apparently has two
primary targets, "organized crime" and the "New Left."
In the East, grand juries generally devote more energy to
investigating "organized crime," while West Coast grand
juries, particularly those in the Bay Area, have
concentrated on crimes allegedly committed by political
activists.
Objections to grand juries fall into two basic
categories: procedural and motivational. Three groups in
particular have raised vocal objections to the grand
juries' present activities:
— Political activists and their attorneys frequently
charge that grand juries are used for purposes of
harassment, to conduct investigations that the FBI has
been unable to complete, and that prosecutors
frequently use "tainted evidence" — that is, evidence
that has been gathered illegally - during their
presentations.
— Newspaper reporters, writers, editors, and, in some
cases, academicians c}aim that their forced "third party"
testimony before grand juries interferes with their ability
to maintain confidential relationships with news sources.
— Civil libertarians and some law professors complain
that grand juries are now being utilized so extensively
that they now represent a major threat to individual
liberties.
Says one criminal legal scholar: "The grand jury has
always been uniquely susceptible to abuse. Occasional
abuses have always occurred, but today we are seeing
abuses on a scale and with a dramatic intensity unlike
anything we've ever seen before."
In California, as elsewhere, there are two types of
grand juries, county and federal. In theory, the federal
grand jury's sole function is to determine whether or not
there is sufficient evidence to bring federal charges
against people, groups or corporations.
The county grand jury, however, is charged with (1)
considering criminal indictments for violations of the
state penal code; (2) considering misdemeanor violations
committed in or triable in the county; (3) evaluating the
needs of the county; (4) investigating the expenditure of
public monies; and (5) investigating the conduct of
public officials.
Both types of grand juries usually are composed of 23
people. County grand juries are often selected from a list
of prominent citizens nominated on an annual basis by
superior court judges. Federal grand juries are selected at
random from voter registration lists.
Increasing Disuse
The county grand jury has fallen into increasing disuse
insofar as criminal matters are involved. Local
prosecutors (district or state's attorneys) usually find it
easier — and speedier — to proceed by direct accusation
(known as an "information") rather than to go through
a grand jury investigation. In California, about 95
percent of all cases are prosecuted in this manner.
County grand juries, therefore, usually spend most of
their time investigating matters related to county
government, such as local jail operations, airports and
port authorities, and school budgets.

"By and large, grand juries do as they are requested
by prosecutors and they do it with cafeteria speed."
On the federal level, the Organized Crime Control Act
of 1970 in effect mandated U.S. District Courts to
empanel special investigative grand juries on a regular
basis. These grand juries meet specifically to look into
"organized crime" and the "New Left," the latter an
area that appears to frustrate most Justice Department
investigations.
Deter Prosecutors
When grand juries first became institutionalized in this
country, one of their purposes was to deter zealous
prosecutors and to protect the citizenry. As recently as
1972, the Supreme Court said of the grand jury:
"Historically, this body has been regarded as a
primary security to the innocent against hasty, malicious
and oppressive persecution; it serves the invaluable
function in our society of standing between the accuser
and the accused, whether the latter be an individual,
minority group, or other, to determine whether a charge
is founded upon reason or was dictated by an
intimidating power or by malice and personal ill will."
Amsterdam's Views
Law Prof. Anthony G. Amsterdam, some of whose
clients have been among those subpoenaed before
federal investigative grand juries, believes prosecutors
completely dominate the proceedings. Says Amsterdam:
"Lawyers who run grand juries are in a situation as
close to that of God as any human being on this earth.
That is to say that they arc all-powerful within their own
little world, because the grand jury essentially gets no
instructions on the law from anybody but the lawyer
who is running it.

"The [prosecutor] decides when (the grand jurors]
shall convene, when they shall take breakfast, when they
shall take lunch, when they shall go to the bathroom,
when they shall adjourn. He issues the subpoenas and
there's simply nobody to quarrel with him.
Omnipotent Prosecutors
"There' is no judge to restrict what he does,"
Amsterdam asserts. "The grand jurors . .. seldom take
an independent stand. So what happens is that the
prosecutor becomes omnipotent and he becomes infused
with a sense of his omnipotence. That's simply what the
grand jury does to you."
Witnesses before a grand jury are interrogated under
oath secretly by the prosecutor. The grand jurors
themselves ask questions only infrequently. Witness'
attorneys are not permitted in the grand jury's hearing
room. Someone suspected of a particular crime does not
have the right to appear before a grand jury. If one is
subpoenaed (ordered by the court to testify), he may
invoke the Fifth Amendment. But without their lawyers

"Lawyers who run grand juries are in a situation as close to that of God as any human being on earth."

present, most witnesses are reluctant or unable to
exercise their rights.
A witness can be compelled to testify if he is granted
immunity. Such immunity does not protect him from
prosecution; he may not, however, be prosecuted on the
basis of testimony he is compelled to give. Failure to
testify after immunity has been granted usually results in
a witness being cited for contempt of court. Sentences in
cases such as these usually run as long as 18 months, the
maximum term of a grand jury.
'Inevitable'
Amsterdam believes that the outcry raised by radicals
and civil libertarians "is simply the inevitable result of
the bureaucratic focusing of grand juries on radicals."
"The hardline law and order attitude of Mitchell and
Kleindienst is totally unsolicitous of individual rights,"
he contends. "They simply could not give less of a damn
if people are destroyed even though there isn't the least
investigative reason for calling them.
"The present attitude of the Nixon administration
is . . . that if there's any convenience interest at all to be
served by issuing a subpoena, you don't even think
about the weight on the other side. You go ahead and
issue it."
Tandem Grand Juries
Tandem (cooperative) grand juries, Amsterdam says,
are "traditional" but "not legally proper."
"You've got a nationwide network of grand juries all
engaged in the quest after subversives, so that the kind
of cooperation which you fortuitously would get in
individual cases between one grand jury and another in
the old days was nothing compared to the cooperation
between the grand juries that's going on now."
But John Kaplan, another Law School professor and
former federal prosecutor, disagrees with Amsterdam
and others who are concerned about possible grand jury
abuse. The only reason that recent grand juries have
attracted attention, he believes, "is that radicals scream
louder than other people."
'Witch-Hunt'
"Many is the case 1 know when there was a grand jury
investigation that was denounced near and far as an
absolute witch-hunt persecution. Finally the grand jury
returned an indictment, and everyone trooped in and
pleaded guilty," he says
Kaplan terms the citizen-protection aspect of the
grand jury system "quite unimportant. The purpose of
the [federal] grand jury is to pass on [approve]
indictments brought before it by the prosecutor."
He concedes, however, that grand juries only rarely
turned down his requests for indictments. Some of his
presentations, he says, lasted "maybe 20 seconds."
'Cafeteria Speed'
"By and large," he wrote several years ago, "grand
juries today do as they are requested by prosecutors and
they do it with cafeteria speed."
Kaplan says that in the federal system the grand jury
is used as an executive subpoena by agencies such as the
Justice Department and the FBI which, by themselves,
cannot compel testimony.
That practice, among others, leads to "an awful lot of
violations of what we think are normally regarded as the
rights of the citizen," he says. "There's no doubt about
that. Maybe our ideas as to what have been the rights of
the citizen are not really accurate."
On both the county and federal level, it is possible
that a suspect may be indicted in connection with a
crime without even knowing that a grand jury has
considered his case. The suspect does not have the right
to cross-examine witnesses who testified against him.
In some states (excluding California), a suspect may
never see a transcript of the grand jury hearing at which
he was indicted. There are also different evidentiary
rules that apply to grand jury proceedings, so evidence
inadmissible during a trial, such as hearsay, may be used
during a grand jury proceeding.
Broad Questions
Prosecutors frequently ask witnesses questions framed
in the broadest possible terms. One question asked of a
witness during a 1970 probe into the Weatherman
organization was as follows:
"I want you to describe for the grand jury every
occasion during the year 1970 when you have been in

attended by, or been any place when any individual
spoke whom you knew to be associated with or
affiliated with Students for a Democratic Society, the
Weatherman, the Communist Party or any other
organization advocating revolutionary overthrow of the
United States, describing for the grand jury when these
incidents occurred, where they occurred, who was
present and what was said by all persons there and what
you did at the time that you were in these meetings,
groups, associations or conversations."
Strict Secrecy
Grand jury investigations, both state and federal,
usually are conducted in strict secrecy. The public rarely
hears about them until they return indictments, which
are announced in open court, or, in the case of a "sealed
indictment," after the suspect is taken into custody.
The theory behind the secrecy is that investigations
that do not result in indictments or criminal complaints
may unfairly damage the reputations of those who have
been investigated.
However, many activists now contend that the secrecy

contact with, attended meetings conducted by, or
merely allows the government to "hide" what they
consider to be an unjust process from the public view.
Some believe that by bringing the grand jury process to
public attention they can force the government to end
its investigative role.
Many of the investigative grand juries are being run by
prosecuting attorneys from a 14-member section of the
Justice Department's Internal Security Division (ISD)
known as the Special Litigation Section (SLS). Until
recently, the ISD, which is responsible for prosecuting a
wide variety of crimes, including Selective Service
violations, spent most of its time reviewing FBI reports
about alleged radical activities.
The ISD reportedly maintains extremely close ties to
the FBI and controls the Justice Department's own
intelligence network, the Interdivisional Intelligence
Unit (IDIU). The IDIU has a broad responsibility for
observing anti-war and radical activities.
The SLS is headed by Guy L. Goodwin, a former
assistant U.S. attorney for Kansas now known to amny
activists as a "special prosecutor for the Nixon-Mitchell
gang." The SLS was created, in fact, by the Nixon
administration to prosecute "revolutionary terrorists."
Goodwin's Background
In his official Justice Department biography, Good
win describes himself as "an experienced federal
prosecutor who frequently represents the government in
matters growing out of civil disturbances and terrorist
activities."
In effect the Justice Department's "traveling pro
secutor," Goodwin spends as many as three weeks every
month directing special investigative grand juries from
coast to coast. He has personally conducted some of the
Justice Department's most publicized investigations,
including those of Leslie Bacon, the Berrigan brothers
and the Vietnam Veterans Against the War (VVAW).
Since late 1970, the SLS has been waging a
multi-faceted probe into "underground" revolutionaries
and "terrorists." Prior to that, the ISD and the IDIU
concentrated their efforts on ghetto surveillance and an
apparently fruitless investigation into the Black Panther
Party.
Three Broad Categories
During 1971, for example, at least 13 special federal
grand juries investigated political activists falling into
three broad categories: the "underground" revolu
tionaries (Weatherpeople), anti-war intellectuals (the
"Pentagon Papers"), and the Catholic Left (the Berrigan
brothers).
A recent Daily survey shows that at least eight special
federal grand juries, meeting in six cities, currently are
investigating "underground" revolutionaries — four of
whom are on the FBl's "Ten Most Wanted" list — as well
as political activists' means of support.
One special federal grand jury meeting in San
Francisco has conducted a two-month-long investigation
of Venceremos' alleged role in the escape of Chino
prison inmate Ronald Wayne Beaty. A prison guard
trainee was killed during that lynching. Two Los Altos
residents, neither of whom belongs to the revolutionary
organization, were jailed six weeks ago for refusing to
answer questions before this grand jury.
Weatherpeople Probe
A second grand jury in San Francisco apparently is
operating as a "tandem" grand jury with another
meeting in Detroit, Mich. These two grand juries are
attempting to track down and indict a long list of federal
fugitives, many of them identified as Weatherpeople,
including Mark Rudd, Kathy Boudin and Bernadine
Dohrn.
One man from Oregon was jailed in early January for
refusing to testify before this San Francisco grand jury.
Three others testified in December only after the
Supreme Court refused to consider their cases.
The Detroit grand jury recently returned a single
count indictment against 15 people charging them with
conspiring to bomb police facilities, a police officer's
home and military facilities in several states.
'War Council'
Most of those named in the Detroit indictment are
identified as Weatherpeople who attended a January,
1970 "war council" at Flint, Mich. Newspaper reports

indicated that some 400 people attended that
conference.
The 15 defendants — four of whom are in custody,
according to late reports - are charged with conspiring
to make and possess unregistered explosives and to
transport them across state lines "to destroy police
installations and other civic, business and educational
buildings throughout the country and to kill and injure
persons therein."
Another 24 persons are named in the indictment as
co-conspirators. However, no charges have been lodged
against members of this group.
IRA Gun-Running
A third grand jury in San Francisco is investigating
alleged gun-running by American citizens acting on
behalf of the outlawed Irish Republican Army. Most of
the witnesses who have appeared before this grand jury
were subpoenaed from Butte, Mont., a community with
a large Irish-American population. Several persons were
jailed in November for refusing to answer questions
before this grand jury, which, like the other two sitting
in San Francisco, has returned no indictments.
Other grand juries presently are meeting in Cleveland,
Ohio (another Weatherpeople investigation), Los Angeles
(various activities in the student community of Isla
Vista, Calif.), Ft. Worth, Tex. (Irish Republican Army
activities centered in New York City), and a small town
in Arizona (the Beaty escape). '
Several grand juries scattered throughout the country
investigated VVAW activities during the 1972 Republi
can National Convention at Miami Beach, Fla., but these
panels apparently have not met recently.
VVAW Grand Juries
However, one of the VVAW grand juries indicted or
re-indicted seven VVAW members in December for
allegedly plotting to disrupt the convention. One
non-member was also indicted.
The eight are charged with conspiring to attack Miami
Beach police stations with automatic weapons, fire
bombs and other devices. Two of those indicted are
regional VVAW coordinators.
Currently, there appear to be no ongoing investiga
tions of the Catholic Left. The most recent investigation
into anti-war intellectuals ended in late November after a
Harvard University researcher spent six days in jail for
refusing to answer questions before a Boston grand jury
apparently investigating the leak of the "Pentagon
Papers" to The New York Times.
Harassment
Many witnesses before SLS grand juries believe
questions are asked of them not for fact-finding but for
purposes of harassment. Their lawyers appear to have no
great respect for the section's prosecutorial ability or
tactics. These lawyers point out that many convictions
(usually on conspiracy charges) obtained by the SLS are
reversed on appeal.
One lawyer, who asked not to be named, said the ISD
"is the dumping grounds for the entire Justice
Department." "
Sen. Sam Ervin (D.-N.C.), one of the Senate's
watch-dogs of personal liberties, recently told the Los
Angeles Times:
"We ought to put the grand jury back into its proper
function. In the federal system, the function of the
grand jury is being perverted. The grand jury is supposed
to be a judicial body. It is not supposed to go out and
Find evidence for the government."
'Chosen Instrument'
Frank J. Donner, who heads the American Civil
Liberties Union's Project on Political Surveillance, views
the SLS grand juries "as a 'chosen instrument' of a
[Nixon] administration strategy to curb dissent and to
intimidate and demoralize radicals.

"Allegations that any of our grand juries are being
utilized to harass, intimidate, or otherwise discourage
citizens from exercising their constitutional freedoms are
absurd.
"What makes this strategy so effective," Donner

present, most witnesses are reluctant or unable to

A witness can be compelled to testify if he is granted

prosecution; he may not, however, be prosecuted on the
basis of testimony he is compelled to give. Failure to

a witness being cited for contempt of court. Sentences in

Tandem Grand Juries
Tandem (cooperative) grand juries, Amsterdam says,
are "traditional" but "not legally proper."
"You've got a nationwide network of grand juries all
engaged in the quest after subversives, so that the kind
of cooperation which you fortuitously would get in
individual cases between one grand jury and another in
the old days was nothing compared to the cooperation
between the grand juries that's going on now."
But John Kaplan, another Law School professor and
former federal prosecutor, disagrees with Amsterdam
and others who are concerned about possible grand jury
abuse. The only reason that recent grand juries have
attracted attention, he believes, "is that radicals scream
louder than other people."
'Witch-Hunt'
"Many is the case 1 know when there was a grand jury
investigation that was denounced near and far as an
absolute witch-hunt persecution. Finally the grand jury
returned an indictment, and everyone trooped in and
pleaded guilty," he says
Kaplan terms the citizen-protection aspect of the
grand jury system "quite unimportant. The purpose of
the [federal] grand jury is to pass on [approve]
indictments brought before it by the prosecutor."
He concedes, however, that grand juries only rarely
turned down his requests for indictments. Some of his
presentations, he says, lasted "maybe 20 seconds."
'Cafeteria Speed'
"By and large," he wrote several years ago, "grand
juries today do as they are requested by prosecutors and
they do it with cafeteria speed."
Kaplan says that in the federal system the grand jury
is used as an executive subpoena by agencies such as the
Justice Department and the FBI which, by themselves,
cannot compel testimony.
That practice, among others, leads to "an awful lot of
violations of what we think are normally regarded as the
rights of the citizen," he says. "There's no doubt about
that. Maybe our ideas as to what have been the rights of
the citizen are not really accurate."
On both the county and federal level, it is possible
that a suspect may be indicted in connection with a
crime without even knowing that a grand jury has
considered his case. The suspect does not have the right
to cross-examine witnesses who testified against him.
In some states (excluding California), a suspect may
never see a transcript of the grand jury hearing at which
he was indicted. There are also different evidentiary
rules that apply to grand jury proceedings, so evidence
inadmissible during a trial, such as hearsay, may be used
during a grand jury proceeding.
Broad Questions
Prosecutors frequently ask witnesses questions framed
in the broadest possible terms. One question asked of a
witness during a 1970 probe into the Weatherman
organization was as follows:
"I want you to describe for the grand jury every
occasion during the year 1970 when you have been in

attended by, or been any place when any individual
spoke whom you knew to be associated with or
affiliated with Students for a Democratic Society, the
Weatherman, the Communist Party or any other
organization advocating revolutionary overthrow of the
United States, describing for the grand jury when these
incidents occurred, where they occurred, who was
present and what was said by all persons there and what
you did at the time that you were in these meetings,
groups, associations or conversations."
Strict Secrecy
Grand jury investigations, both state and federal,
usually are conducted in strict secrecy. The public rarely
hears about them until they return indictments, which
are announced in open court, or, in the case of a "sealed
indictment," after the suspect is taken into custody.
The theory behind the secrecy is that investigations
that do not result in indictments or criminal complaints
may unfairly damage the reputations of those who have
been investigated.
However, many activists now contend that the secrecy

contact with, attended meetings conducted by, or
merely allows the government to "hide" what they
consider to be an unjust process from the public view.
Some believe that by bringing the grand jury process to
public attention they can force the government to end
its investigative role.
Many of the investigative grand juries are being run by
prosecuting attorneys from a 14-member section of the
Justice Department's Internal Security Division (ISD)
known as the Special Litigation Section (SLS). Until
recently, the ISD, which is responsible for prosecuting a
wide variety of crimes, including Selective Service
violations, spent most of its time reviewing FBI reports
about alleged radical activities.
The ISD reportedly maintains extremely close ties to
the FBI and controls the Justice Department's own
intelligence network, the Interdivisional Intelligence
Unit (IDIU). The IDIU has a broad responsibility for
observing anti-war and radical activities.
The SLS is headed by Guy L. Goodwin, a former
assistant U.S. attorney for Kansas now known to amny
activists as a "special prosecutor for the Nixon-Mitchell
gang." The SLS was created, in fact, by the Nixon
administration to prosecute "revolutionary terrorists."
Goodwin's Background
In his official Justice Department biography, Good
win describes himself as "an experienced federal
prosecutor who frequently represents the government in
matters growing out of civil disturbances and terrorist
activities."
In effect the Justice Department's "traveling pro
secutor," Goodwin spends as many as three weeks every
month directing special investigative grand juries from
coast to coast. He has personally conducted some of the
Justice Department's most publicized investigations,
including those of Leslie Bacon, the Berrigan brothers
and the Vietnam Veterans Against the War (VVAW).
Since late 1970, the SLS has been waging a
multi-faceted probe into "underground" revolutionaries
and "terrorists." Prior to that, the ISD and the IDIU
concentrated their efforts on ghetto surveillance and an
apparently fruitless investigation into the Black Panther
Party.
Three Broad Categories
During 1971, for example, at least 13 special federal
grand juries investigated political activists falling into
three broad categories: the "underground" revolu
tionaries (Weatherpeople), anti-war intellectuals (the
"Pentagon Papers"), and the Catholic Left (the Berrigan
brothers).
A recent Daily survey shows that at least eight special
federal grand juries, meeting in six cities, currently are
investigating "underground" revolutionaries — four of
whom are on the FBl's "Ten Most Wanted" list — as well
as political activists' means of support.
One special federal grand jury meeting in San
Francisco has conducted a two-month-long investigation
of Venceremos' alleged role in the escape of Chino
prison inmate Ronald Wayne Beaty. A prison guard
trainee was killed during that lynching. Two Los Altos
residents, neither of whom belongs to the revolutionary
organization, were jailed six weeks ago for refusing to
answer questions before this grand jury.
Weatherpeople Probe
A second grand jury in San Francisco apparently is
operating as a "tandem" grand jury with another
meeting in Detroit, Mich. These two grand juries are
attempting to track down and indict a long list of federal
fugitives, many of them identified as Weatherpeople,
including Mark Rudd, Kathy Boudin and Bernadine
Dohrn.
One man from Oregon was jailed in early January for
refusing to testify before this San Francisco grand jury.
Three others testified in December only after the
Supreme Court refused to consider their cases.
The Detroit grand jury recently returned a single
count indictment against 15 people charging them with
conspiring to bomb police facilities, a police officer's
home and military facilities in several states.
'War Council'
Most of those named in the Detroit indictment are
identified as Weatherpeople who attended a January,
1970 "war council" at Flint, Mich. Newspaper reports

indicated that some 400 people attended that
conference.
The 15 defendants — four of whom are in custody,
according to late reports - are charged with conspiring
to make and possess unregistered explosives and to
transport them across state lines "to destroy police
installations and other civic, business and educational
buildings throughout the country and to kill and injure
persons therein."
Another 24 persons are named in the indictment as
co-conspirators. However, no charges have been lodged
against members of this group.
IRA Gun-Running
A third grand jury in San Francisco is investigating
alleged gun-running by American citizens acting on
behalf of the outlawed Irish Republican Army. Most of
the witnesses who have appeared before this grand jury
were subpoenaed from Butte, Mont., a community with
a large Irish-American population. Several persons were
jailed in November for refusing to answer questions
before this grand jury, which, like the other two sitting
in San Francisco, has returned no indictments.
Other grand juries presently are meeting in Cleveland,
Ohio (another Weatherpeople investigation), Los Angeles
(various activities in the student community of Isla
Vista, Calif.), Ft. Worth, Tex. (Irish Republican Army
activities centered in New York City), and a small town
in Arizona (the Beaty escape). '
Several grand juries scattered throughout the country
investigated VVAW activities during the 1972 Republi
can National Convention at Miami Beach, Fla., but these
panels apparently have not met recently.
VVAW Grand Juries
However, one of the VVAW grand juries indicted or
re-indicted seven VVAW members in December for
allegedly plotting to disrupt the convention. One
non-member was also indicted.
The eight are charged with conspiring to attack Miami
Beach police stations with automatic weapons, fire
bombs and other devices. Two of those indicted are
regional VVAW coordinators.
Currently, there appear to be no ongoing investiga
tions of the Catholic Left. The most recent investigation
into anti-war intellectuals ended in late November after a
Harvard University researcher spent six days in jail for
refusing to answer questions before a Boston grand jury
apparently investigating the leak of the "Pentagon
Papers" to The New York Times.
Harassment
Many witnesses before SLS grand juries believe
questions are asked of them not for fact-finding but for
purposes of harassment. Their lawyers appear to have no
great respect for the section's prosecutorial ability or
tactics. These lawyers point out that many convictions
(usually on conspiracy charges) obtained by the SLS are
reversed on appeal.
One lawyer, who asked not to be named, said the ISD
"is the dumping grounds for the entire Justice
Department." "
Sen. Sam Ervin (D.-N.C.), one of the Senate's
watch-dogs of personal liberties, recently told the Los
Angeles Times:
"We ought to put the grand jury back into its proper
function. In the federal system, the function of the
grand jury is being perverted. The grand jury is supposed
to be a judicial body. It is not supposed to go out and
Find evidence for the government."
'Chosen Instrument'
Frank J. Donner, who heads the American Civil
Liberties Union's Project on Political Surveillance, views
the SLS grand juries "as a 'chosen instrument' of a
[Nixon] administration strategy to curb dissent and to
intimidate and demoralize radicals.

"Allegations that any of our grand juries are being
utilized to harass, intimidate, or otherwise discourage
citizens from exercising their constitutional freedoms are
absurd.
"What makes this strategy so effective," Donner
wrote last year, "is that the federal prosecuting officials
who themselves have no power of subpoena - are
using the coercive powers of the grand jury for police
and intelligence purposes."
Donner believes that the Justice Department is
facilitating its prosecutions of radicals by constructing
intricate "sociograms," which he defines this way:
Goodwin Denies Sociograms
"It is all a matter of friendships, affiliations,
communications, meetings, travels, finances, beliefs,
habits . . . This personal and seemingly innocuous data is
then fed into the IDIU data bank .. .[g] rand jury
testimony is thereby integrated with intelligence
gathered from all other sources, including illegal
electronic surveillance conducted by state as well as
federal authorities."
Prosecutor Goodwin, known at the Justice Depart
ment for his "computer-like mind," denies that SLS is
constructing sociograms. He told the Los Angeles Times,
"I don't even know what a sociogram is."
In a letter to this reporter about the San Francisco
Weatherpeople grand jury, Goodwin commented:
"I can assure you that the singular purpose of that
grand jury as well as other grand juries ~ . (I] have been
involved in is to investigate and present evidence of
specific violations of Federal law. Allegations that this or
any of our grand juries are being utilized to harass,
intimidate or otherwise discourage citizens, whatever
their political persuasion may be, from exercising their
constitutional freedoms arc absurd."

The Department of Justice's increased use of special
investigative grand juries in recent months has become a
major focal point for civil libertarians and political
activists.
The new wave of grand juries apparently has two
primary targets, "organized crime" and the "New Left."
In the East, grand juries generally devote more energy to
investigating "organized crime," while West Coast grand
juries, particularly those in the Bay Area, have
concentrated on crimes allegedly committed by political
activists.
Objections to grand juries fall into two basic
categories: procedural and motivational. Three groups in
particular have raised vocal objections to the grand
juries' present activities:
— Political activists and their attorneys frequently
charge that grand juries are used for purposes of
harassment, to conduct investigations that the FBI has
been unable to complete, and that prosecutors
frequently use "tainted evidence" — that is, evidence
that has been gathered illegally - during their
presentations.
— Newspaper reporters, writers, editors, and, in some
cases, academicians c}aim that their forced "third party"
testimony before grand juries interferes with their ability
to maintain confidential relationships with news sources.
— Civil libertarians and some law professors complain
that grand juries are now being utilized so extensively
that they now represent a major threat to individual
liberties.
Says one criminal legal scholar: "The grand jury has
always been uniquely susceptible to abuse. Occasional
abuses have always occurred, but today we are seeing
abuses on a scale and with a dramatic intensity unlike
anything we've ever seen before."
In California, as elsewhere, there are two types of
grand juries, county and federal. In theory, the federal
grand jury's sole function is to determine whether or not
there is sufficient evidence to bring federal charges
against people, groups or corporations.
The county grand jury, however, is charged with (1)
considering criminal indictments for violations of the
state penal code; (2) considering misdemeanor violations
committed in or triable in the county; (3) evaluating the
needs of the county; (4) investigating the expenditure of
public monies; and (5) investigating the conduct of
public officials.
Both types of grand juries usually are composed of 23
people. County grand juries are often selected from a list
of prominent citizens nominated on an annual basis by
superior court judges. Federal grand juries are selected at
random from voter registration lists.
Increasing Disuse
The county grand jury has fallen into increasing disuse
insofar as criminal matters are involved. Local
prosecutors (district or state's attorneys) usually find it
easier — and speedier — to proceed by direct accusation
(known as an "information") rather than to go through
a grand jury investigation. In California, about 95
percent of all cases are prosecuted in this manner.
County grand juries, therefore, usually spend most of
their time investigating matters related to county
government, such as local jail operations, airports and
port authorities, and school budgets.

"By and large, grand juries do as they are requested
by prosecutors and they do it with cafeteria speed."
On the federal level, the Organized Crime Control Act
of 1970 in effect mandated U.S. District Courts to
empanel special investigative grand juries on a regular
basis. These grand juries meet specifically to look into
"organized crime" and the "New Left," the latter an
area that appears to frustrate most Justice Department
investigations.
Deter Prosecutors
When grand juries first became institutionalized in this
country, one of their purposes was to deter zealous
prosecutors and to protect the citizenry. As recently as
1972, the Supreme Court said of the grand jury:
"Historically, this body has been regarded as a
primary security to the innocent against hasty, malicious
and oppressive persecution; it serves the invaluable
function in our society of standing between the accuser
and the accused, whether the latter be an individual,
minority group, or other, to determine whether a charge
is founded upon reason or was dictated by an
intimidating power or by malice and personal ill will."
Amsterdam's Views
Law Prof. Anthony G. Amsterdam, some of whose
clients have been among those subpoenaed before
federal investigative grand juries, believes prosecutors
completely dominate the proceedings. Says Amsterdam:
"Lawyers who run grand juries are in a situation as
close to that of God as any human being on this earth.
That is to say that they arc all-powerful within their own
little world, because the grand jury essentially gets no
instructions on the law from anybody but the lawyer
who is running it.

"The [prosecutor] decides when (the grand jurors]
shall convene, when they shall take breakfast, when they
shall take lunch, when they shall go to the bathroom,
when they shall adjourn. He issues the subpoenas and
there's simply nobody to quarrel with him.
Omnipotent Prosecutors
"There' is no judge to restrict what he does,"
Amsterdam asserts. "The grand jurors . .. seldom take
an independent stand. So what happens is that the
prosecutor becomes omnipotent and he becomes infused
with a sense of his omnipotence. That's simply what the
grand jury does to you."
Witnesses before a grand jury are interrogated under
oath secretly by the prosecutor. The grand jurors
themselves ask questions only infrequently. Witness'
attorneys are not permitted in the grand jury's hearing
room. Someone suspected of a particular crime does not
have the right to appear before a grand jury. If one is
subpoenaed (ordered by the court to testify), he may
invoke the Fifth Amendment. But without their lawyers

"Lawyers who run grand juries are in a situation as close to that of God as any human being on earth."

present, most witnesses are reluctant or unable to
exercise their rights.
A witness can be compelled to testify if he is granted
immunity. Such immunity does not protect him from
prosecution; he may not, however, be prosecuted on the
basis of testimony he is compelled to give. Failure to
testify after immunity has been granted usually results in
a witness being cited for contempt of court. Sentences in
cases such as these usually run as long as 18 months, the
maximum term of a grand jury.
'Inevitable'
Amsterdam believes that the outcry raised by radicals
and civil libertarians "is simply the inevitable result of
the bureaucratic focusing of grand juries on radicals."
"The hardline law and order attitude of Mitchell and
Kleindienst is totally unsolicitous of individual rights,"
he contends. "They simply could not give less of a damn
if people are destroyed even though there isn't the least
investigative reason for calling them.
"The present attitude of the Nixon administration
is . . . that if there's any convenience interest at all to be
served by issuing a subpoena, you don't even think
about the weight on the other side. You go ahead and
issue it."
Tandem Grand Juries
Tandem (cooperative) grand juries, Amsterdam says,
are "traditional" but "not legally proper."
"You've got a nationwide network of grand juries all
engaged in the quest after subversives, so that the kind
of cooperation which you fortuitously would get in
individual cases between one grand jury and another in
the old days was nothing compared to the cooperation
between the grand juries that's going on now."
But John Kaplan, another Law School professor and
former federal prosecutor, disagrees with Amsterdam
and others who are concerned about possible grand jury
abuse. The only reason that recent grand juries have
attracted attention, he believes, "is that radicals scream
louder than other people."
'Witch-Hunt'
"Many is the case 1 know when there was a grand jury
investigation that was denounced near and far as an
absolute witch-hunt persecution. Finally the grand jury
returned an indictment, and everyone trooped in and
pleaded guilty," he says
Kaplan terms the citizen-protection aspect of the
grand jury system "quite unimportant. The purpose of
the [federal] grand jury is to pass on [approve]
indictments brought before it by the prosecutor."
He concedes, however, that grand juries only rarely
turned down his requests for indictments. Some of his
presentations, he says, lasted "maybe 20 seconds."
'Cafeteria Speed'
"By and large," he wrote several years ago, "grand
juries today do as they are requested by prosecutors and
they do it with cafeteria speed."
Kaplan says that in the federal system the grand jury
is used as an executive subpoena by agencies such as the
Justice Department and the FBI which, by themselves,
cannot compel testimony.
That practice, among others, leads to "an awful lot of
violations of what we think are normally regarded as the
rights of the citizen," he says. "There's no doubt about
that. Maybe our ideas as to what have been the rights of
the citizen are not really accurate."
On both the county and federal level, it is possible
that a suspect may be indicted in connection with a
crime without even knowing that a grand jury has
considered his case. The suspect does not have the right
to cross-examine witnesses who testified against him.
In some states (excluding California), a suspect may
never see a transcript of the grand jury hearing at which
he was indicted. There are also different evidentiary
rules that apply to grand jury proceedings, so evidence
inadmissible during a trial, such as hearsay, may be used
during a grand jury proceeding.
Broad Questions
Prosecutors frequently ask witnesses questions framed
in the broadest possible terms. One question asked of a
witness during a 1970 probe into the Weatherman
organization was as follows:
"I want you to describe for the grand jury every
occasion during the year 1970 when you have been in

attended by, or been any place when any individual
spoke whom you knew to be associated with or
affiliated with Students for a Democratic Society, the
Weatherman, the Communist Party or any other
organization advocating revolutionary overthrow of the
United States, describing for the grand jury when these
incidents occurred, where they occurred, who was
present and what was said by all persons there and what
you did at the time that you were in these meetings,
groups, associations or conversations."
Strict Secrecy
Grand jury investigations, both state and federal,
usually are conducted in strict secrecy. The public rarely
hears about them until they return indictments, which
are announced in open court, or, in the case of a "sealed
indictment," after the suspect is taken into custody.
The theory behind the secrecy is that investigations
that do not result in indictments or criminal complaints
may unfairly damage the reputations of those who have
been investigated.
However, many activists now contend that the secrecy

contact with, attended meetings conducted by, or
merely allows the government to "hide" what they
consider to be an unjust process from the public view.
Some believe that by bringing the grand jury process to
public attention they can force the government to end
its investigative role.
Many of the investigative grand juries are being run by
prosecuting attorneys from a 14-member section of the
Justice Department's Internal Security Division (ISD)
known as the Special Litigation Section (SLS). Until
recently, the ISD, which is responsible for prosecuting a
wide variety of crimes, including Selective Service
violations, spent most of its time reviewing FBI reports
about alleged radical activities.
The ISD reportedly maintains extremely close ties to
the FBI and controls the Justice Department's own
intelligence network, the Interdivisional Intelligence
Unit (IDIU). The IDIU has a broad responsibility for
observing anti-war and radical activities.
The SLS is headed by Guy L. Goodwin, a former
assistant U.S. attorney for Kansas now known to amny
activists as a "special prosecutor for the Nixon-Mitchell
gang." The SLS was created, in fact, by the Nixon
administration to prosecute "revolutionary terrorists."
Goodwin's Background
In his official Justice Department biography, Good
win describes himself as "an experienced federal
prosecutor who frequently represents the government in
matters growing out of civil disturbances and terrorist
activities."
In effect the Justice Department's "traveling pro
secutor," Goodwin spends as many as three weeks every
month directing special investigative grand juries from
coast to coast. He has personally conducted some of the
Justice Department's most publicized investigations,
including those of Leslie Bacon, the Berrigan brothers
and the Vietnam Veterans Against the War (VVAW).
Since late 1970, the SLS has been waging a
multi-faceted probe into "underground" revolutionaries
and "terrorists." Prior to that, the ISD and the IDIU
concentrated their efforts on ghetto surveillance and an
apparently fruitless investigation into the Black Panther
Party.
Three Broad Categories
During 1971, for example, at least 13 special federal
grand juries investigated political activists falling into
three broad categories: the "underground" revolu
tionaries (Weatherpeople), anti-war intellectuals (the
"Pentagon Papers"), and the Catholic Left (the Berrigan
brothers).
A recent Daily survey shows that at least eight special
federal grand juries, meeting in six cities, currently are
investigating "underground" revolutionaries — four of
whom are on the FBl's "Ten Most Wanted" list — as well
as political activists' means of support.
One special federal grand jury meeting in San
Francisco has conducted a two-month-long investigation
of Venceremos' alleged role in the escape of Chino
prison inmate Ronald Wayne Beaty. A prison guard
trainee was killed during that lynching. Two Los Altos
residents, neither of whom belongs to the revolutionary
organization, were jailed six weeks ago for refusing to
answer questions before this grand jury.
Weatherpeople Probe
A second grand jury in San Francisco apparently is
operating as a "tandem" grand jury with another
meeting in Detroit, Mich. These two grand juries are
attempting to track down and indict a long list of federal
fugitives, many of them identified as Weatherpeople,
including Mark Rudd, Kathy Boudin and Bernadine
Dohrn.
One man from Oregon was jailed in early January for
refusing to testify before this San Francisco grand jury.
Three others testified in December only after the
Supreme Court refused to consider their cases.
The Detroit grand jury recently returned a single
count indictment against 15 people charging them with
conspiring to bomb police facilities, a police officer's
home and military facilities in several states.
'War Council'
Most of those named in the Detroit indictment are
identified as Weatherpeople who attended a January,
1970 "war council" at Flint, Mich. Newspaper reports

indicated that some 400 people attended that
conference.
The 15 defendants — four of whom are in custody,
according to late reports - are charged with conspiring
to make and possess unregistered explosives and to
transport them across state lines "to destroy police
installations and other civic, business and educational
buildings throughout the country and to kill and injure
persons therein."
Another 24 persons are named in the indictment as
co-conspirators. However, no charges have been lodged
against members of this group.
IRA Gun-Running
A third grand jury in San Francisco is investigating
alleged gun-running by American citizens acting on
behalf of the outlawed Irish Republican Army. Most of
the witnesses who have appeared before this grand jury
were subpoenaed from Butte, Mont., a community with
a large Irish-American population. Several persons were
jailed in November for refusing to answer questions
before this grand jury, which, like the other two sitting
in San Francisco, has returned no indictments.
Other grand juries presently are meeting in Cleveland,
Ohio (another Weatherpeople investigation), Los Angeles
(various activities in the student community of Isla
Vista, Calif.), Ft. Worth, Tex. (Irish Republican Army
activities centered in New York City), and a small town
in Arizona (the Beaty escape). '
Several grand juries scattered throughout the country
investigated VVAW activities during the 1972 Republi
can National Convention at Miami Beach, Fla., but these
panels apparently have not met recently.
VVAW Grand Juries
However, one of the VVAW grand juries indicted or
re-indicted seven VVAW members in December for
allegedly plotting to disrupt the convention. One
non-member was also indicted.
The eight are charged with conspiring to attack Miami
Beach police stations with automatic weapons, fire
bombs and other devices. Two of those indicted are
regional VVAW coordinators.
Currently, there appear to be no ongoing investiga
tions of the Catholic Left. The most recent investigation
into anti-war intellectuals ended in late November after a
Harvard University researcher spent six days in jail for
refusing to answer questions before a Boston grand jury
apparently investigating the leak of the "Pentagon
Papers" to The New York Times.
Harassment
Many witnesses before SLS grand juries believe
questions are asked of them not for fact-finding but for
purposes of harassment. Their lawyers appear to have no
great respect for the section's prosecutorial ability or
tactics. These lawyers point out that many convictions
(usually on conspiracy charges) obtained by the SLS are
reversed on appeal.
One lawyer, who asked not to be named, said the ISD
"is the dumping grounds for the entire Justice
Department." "
Sen. Sam Ervin (D.-N.C.), one of the Senate's
watch-dogs of personal liberties, recently told the Los

"We ought to put the grand jury back into its proper
function. In the federal system, the function of the
grand jury is being perverted. The grand jury is supposed
to be a judicial body. It is not supposed to go out and
Find evidence for the government."
'Chosen Instrument'
Frank J. Donner, who heads the American Civil
Liberties Union's Project on Political Surveillance, views
the SLS grand juries "as a 'chosen instrument' of a
[Nixon] administration strategy to curb dissent and to
intimidate and demoralize radicals.

"Allegations that any of our grand juries are being
utilized to harass, intimidate, or otherwise discourage
citizens from exercising their constitutional freedoms are
absurd.
"What makes this strategy so effective," Donner
wrote last year, "is that the federal prosecuting officials

and intelligence purposes."
Donner believes that the Justice Department is
facilitating its prosecutions of radicals by constructing
intricate "sociograms," which he defines this way:

ment for his "computer-like mind," denies that SLS is
constructing sociograms. He told the Los Angeles Times,
"I don't even know what a sociogram is."

anything we've ever seen before."
In California, as elsewhere, there are two types of
grand juries, county and federal. In theory, the federal
grand jury's sole function is to determine whether or not
there is sufficient evidence to bring federal charges
against people, groups or corporations.
The county grand jury, however, is charged with (1)
considering criminal indictments for violations of the
state penal code; (2) considering misdemeanor violations
committed in or triable in the county; (3) evaluating the
needs of the county; (4) investigating the expenditure of
public monies; and (5) investigating the conduct of
public officials.
Both types of grand juries usually are composed of 23
people. County grand juries are often selected from a list
of prominent citizens nominated on an annual basis by
superior court judges. Federal grand juries are selected at
random from voter registration lists.
Increasing Disuse
The county grand jury has fallen into increasing disuse
insofar as criminal matters are involved. Local
prosecutors (district or state's attorneys) usually find it
easier — and speedier — to proceed by direct accusation
(known as an "information") rather than to go through
a grand jury investigation. In California, about 95
percent of all cases are prosecuted in this manner.
County grand juries, therefore, usually spend most of
their time investigating matters related to county
government, such as local jail operations, airports and
port authorities, and school budgets.

"By and large, grand juries do as they are requested
by prosecutors and they do it with cafeteria speed."
On the federal level, the Organized Crime Control Act
of 1970 in effect mandated U.S. District Courts to
empanel special investigative grand juries on a regular
basis. These grand juries meet specifically to look into
"organized crime" and the "New Left," the latter an
area that appears to frustrate most Justice Department
investigations.
Deter Prosecutors
When grand juries first became institutionalized in this
country, one of their purposes was to deter zealous
prosecutors and to protect the citizenry. As recently as
1972, the Supreme Court said of the grand jury:
"Historically, this body has been regarded as a
primary security to the innocent against hasty, malicious
and oppressive persecution; it serves the invaluable
function in our society of standing between the accuser
and the accused, whether the latter be an individual,
minority group, or other, to determine whether a charge
is founded upon reason or was dictated by an
intimidating power or by malice and personal ill will."
Amsterdam's Views
Law Prof. Anthony G. Amsterdam, some of whose
clients have been among those subpoenaed before
federal investigative grand juries, believes prosecutors
completely dominate the proceedings. Says Amsterdam:
"Lawyers who run grand juries are in a situation as
close to that of God as any human being on this earth.
That is to say that they arc all-powerful within their own
little world, because the grand jury essentially gets no
instructions on the law from anybody but the lawyer
who is running it.

"The [prosecutor] decides when (the grand jurors]
shall convene, when they shall take breakfast, when they
shall take lunch, when they shall go to the bathroom,
when they shall adjourn. He issues the subpoenas and
there's simply nobody to quarrel with him.
Omnipotent Prosecutors
"There' is no judge to restrict what he does,"
Amsterdam asserts. "The grand jurors . .. seldom take
an independent stand. So what happens is that the
prosecutor becomes omnipotent and he becomes infused
with a sense of his omnipotence. That's simply what the
grand jury does to you."
Witnesses before a grand jury are interrogated under
oath secretly by the prosecutor. The grand jurors
themselves ask questions only infrequently. Witness'
attorneys are not permitted in the grand jury's hearing
room. Someone suspected of a particular crime does not
have the right to appear before a grand jury. If one is
subpoenaed (ordered by the court to testify), he may
invoke the Fifth Amendment. But without their lawyers

"Lawyers who run grand juries are in a situation as close to that of God as any human being on earth."

present, most witnesses are reluctant or unable to
exercise their rights.
A witness can be compelled to testify if he is granted
immunity. Such immunity does not protect him from
prosecution; he may not, however, be prosecuted on the
basis of testimony he is compelled to give. Failure to
testify after immunity has been granted usually results in
a witness being cited for contempt of court. Sentences in
cases such as these usually run as long as 18 months, the
maximum term of a grand jury.
'Inevitable'
Amsterdam believes that the outcry raised by radicals
and civil libertarians "is simply the inevitable result of
the bureaucratic focusing of grand juries on radicals."
"The hardline law and order attitude of Mitchell and
Kleindienst is totally unsolicitous of individual rights,"
he contends. "They simply could not give less of a damn
if people are destroyed even though there isn't the least
investigative reason for calling them.
"The present attitude of the Nixon administration
is . . . that if there's any convenience interest at all to be
served by issuing a subpoena, you don't even think
about the weight on the other side. You go ahead and
issue it."
Tandem Grand Juries
Tandem (cooperative) grand juries, Amsterdam says,
are "traditional" but "not legally proper."
"You've got a nationwide network of grand juries all
engaged in the quest after subversives, so that the kind
of cooperation which you fortuitously would get in
individual cases between one grand jury and another in
the old days was nothing compared to the cooperation
between the grand juries that's going on now."
But John Kaplan, another Law School professor and
former federal prosecutor, disagrees with Amsterdam
and others who are concerned about possible grand jury
abuse. The only reason that recent grand juries have
attracted attention, he believes, "is that radicals scream
louder than other people."
'Witch-Hunt'
"Many is the case 1 know when there was a grand jury
investigation that was denounced near and far as an
absolute witch-hunt persecution. Finally the grand jury
returned an indictment, and everyone trooped in and
pleaded guilty," he says
Kaplan terms the citizen-protection aspect of the
grand jury system "quite unimportant. The purpose of
the [federal] grand jury is to pass on [approve]
indictments brought before it by the prosecutor."
He concedes, however, that grand juries only rarely
turned down his requests for indictments. Some of his
presentations, he says, lasted "maybe 20 seconds."
'Cafeteria Speed'
"By and large," he wrote several years ago, "grand
juries today do as they are requested by prosecutors and
they do it with cafeteria speed."
Kaplan says that in the federal system the grand jury
is used as an executive subpoena by agencies such as the
Justice Department and the FBI which, by themselves,
cannot compel testimony.
That practice, among others, leads to "an awful lot of
violations of what we think are normally regarded as the
rights of the citizen," he says. "There's no doubt about
that. Maybe our ideas as to what have been the rights of
the citizen are not really accurate."
On both the county and federal level, it is possible
that a suspect may be indicted in connection with a
crime without even knowing that a grand jury has
considered his case. The suspect does not have the right
to cross-examine witnesses who testified against him.
In some states (excluding California), a suspect may
never see a transcript of the grand jury hearing at which
he was indicted. There are also different evidentiary
rules that apply to grand jury proceedings, so evidence
inadmissible during a trial, such as hearsay, may be used
during a grand jury proceeding.
Broad Questions
Prosecutors frequently ask witnesses questions framed
in the broadest possible terms. One question asked of a
witness during a 1970 probe into the Weatherman
organization was as follows:
"I want you to describe for the grand jury every
occasion during the year 1970 when you have been in

attended by, or been any place when any individual
spoke whom you knew to be associated with or
affiliated with Students for a Democratic Society, the
Weatherman, the Communist Party or any other
organization advocating revolutionary overthrow of the
United States, describing for the grand jury when these
incidents occurred, where they occurred, who was
present and what was said by all persons there and what
you did at the time that you were in these meetings,
groups, associations or conversations."
Strict Secrecy
Grand jury investigations, both state and federal,
usually are conducted in strict secrecy. The public rarely
hears about them until they return indictments, which
are announced in open court, or, in the case of a "sealed
indictment," after the suspect is taken into custody.
The theory behind the secrecy is that investigations
that do not result in indictments or criminal complaints
may unfairly damage the reputations of those who have
been investigated.
However, many activists now contend that the secrecy

contact with, attended meetings conducted by, or
merely allows the government to "hide" what they
consider to be an unjust process from the public view.
Some believe that by bringing the grand jury process to
public attention they can force the government to end
its investigative role.
Many of the investigative grand juries are being run by
prosecuting attorneys from a 14-member section of the
Justice Department's Internal Security Division (ISD)
known as the Special Litigation Section (SLS). Until
recently, the ISD, which is responsible for prosecuting a
wide variety of crimes, including Selective Service
violations, spent most of its time reviewing FBI reports
about alleged radical activities.
The ISD reportedly maintains extremely close ties to
the FBI and controls the Justice Department's own
intelligence network, the Interdivisional Intelligence
Unit (IDIU). The IDIU has a broad responsibility for
observing anti-war and radical activities.
The SLS is headed by Guy L. Goodwin, a former
assistant U.S. attorney for Kansas now known to amny
activists as a "special prosecutor for the Nixon-Mitchell
gang." The SLS was created, in fact, by the Nixon
administration to prosecute "revolutionary terrorists."
Goodwin's Background
In his official Justice Department biography, Good
win describes himself as "an experienced federal
prosecutor who frequently represents the government in
matters growing out of civil disturbances and terrorist
activities."
In effect the Justice Department's "traveling pro
secutor," Goodwin spends as many as three weeks every
month directing special investigative grand juries from
coast to coast. He has personally conducted some of the
Justice Department's most publicized investigations,
including those of Leslie Bacon, the Berrigan brothers
and the Vietnam Veterans Against the War (VVAW).
Since late 1970, the SLS has been waging a
multi-faceted probe into "underground" revolutionaries
and "terrorists." Prior to that, the ISD and the IDIU
concentrated their efforts on ghetto surveillance and an
apparently fruitless investigation into the Black Panther
Party.
Three Broad Categories
During 1971, for example, at least 13 special federal
grand juries investigated political activists falling into
three broad categories: the "underground" revolu
tionaries (Weatherpeople), anti-war intellectuals (the
"Pentagon Papers"), and the Catholic Left (the Berrigan
brothers).
A recent Daily survey shows that at least eight special
federal grand juries, meeting in six cities, currently are
investigating "underground" revolutionaries — four of
whom are on the FBl's "Ten Most Wanted" list — as well
as political activists' means of support.
One special federal grand jury meeting in San
Francisco has conducted a two-month-long investigation
of Venceremos' alleged role in the escape of Chino
prison inmate Ronald Wayne Beaty. A prison guard
trainee was killed during that lynching. Two Los Altos
residents, neither of whom belongs to the revolutionary
organization, were jailed six weeks ago for refusing to
answer questions before this grand jury.
Weatherpeople Probe
A second grand jury in San Francisco apparently is
operating as a "tandem" grand jury with another
meeting in Detroit, Mich. These two grand juries are
attempting to track down and indict a long list of federal
fugitives, many of them identified as Weatherpeople,
including Mark Rudd, Kathy Boudin and Bernadine
Dohrn.
One man from Oregon was jailed in early January for
refusing to testify before this San Francisco grand jury.
Three others testified in December only after the
Supreme Court refused to consider their cases.
The Detroit grand jury recently returned a single
count indictment against 15 people charging them with
conspiring to bomb police facilities, a police officer's
home and military facilities in several states.
'War Council'
Most of those named in the Detroit indictment are
identified as Weatherpeople who attended a January,
1970 "war council" at Flint, Mich. Newspaper reports

indicated that some 400 people attended that
conference.
The 15 defendants — four of whom are in custody,
according to late reports - are charged with conspiring
to make and possess unregistered explosives and to
transport them across state lines "to destroy police
installations and other civic, business and educational
buildings throughout the country and to kill and injure
persons therein."
Another 24 persons are named in the indictment as
co-conspirators. However, no charges have been lodged
against members of this group.
IRA Gun-Running
A third grand jury in San Francisco is investigating
alleged gun-running by American citizens acting on
behalf of the outlawed Irish Republican Army. Most of
the witnesses who have appeared before this grand jury
were subpoenaed from Butte, Mont., a community with
a large Irish-American population. Several persons were
jailed in November for refusing to answer questions
before this grand jury, which, like the other two sitting
in San Francisco, has returned no indictments.
Other grand juries presently are meeting in Cleveland,
Ohio (another Weatherpeople investigation), Los Angeles
(various activities in the student community of Isla
Vista, Calif.), Ft. Worth, Tex. (Irish Republican Army
activities centered in New York City), and a small town
in Arizona (the Beaty escape). '
Several grand juries scattered throughout the country
investigated VVAW activities during the 1972 Republi
can National Convention at Miami Beach, Fla., but these
panels apparently have not met recently.
VVAW Grand Juries
However, one of the VVAW grand juries indicted or
re-indicted seven VVAW members in December for
allegedly plotting to disrupt the convention. One
non-member was also indicted.
The eight are charged with conspiring to attack Miami
Beach police stations with automatic weapons, fire
bombs and other devices. Two of those indicted are
regional VVAW coordinators.
Currently, there appear to be no ongoing investiga
tions of the Catholic Left. The most recent investigation
into anti-war intellectuals ended in late November after a
Harvard University researcher spent six days in jail for
refusing to answer questions before a Boston grand jury
apparently investigating the leak of the "Pentagon
Papers" to The New York Times.
Harassment
Many witnesses before SLS grand juries believe
questions are asked of them not for fact-finding but for
purposes of harassment. Their lawyers appear to have no
great respect for the section's prosecutorial ability or
tactics. These lawyers point out that many convictions
(usually on conspiracy charges) obtained by the SLS are
reversed on appeal.
One lawyer, who asked not to be named, said the ISD
"is the dumping grounds for the entire Justice
Department." "
Sen. Sam Ervin (D.-N.C.), one of the Senate's
watch-dogs of personal liberties, recently told the Los
Angeles Times:
"We ought to put the grand jury back into its proper
function. In the federal system, the function of the
grand jury is being perverted. The grand jury is supposed
to be a judicial body. It is not supposed to go out and
Find evidence for the government."
'Chosen Instrument'
Frank J. Donner, who heads the American Civil
Liberties Union's Project on Political Surveillance, views
the SLS grand juries "as a 'chosen instrument' of a
[Nixon] administration strategy to curb dissent and to
intimidate and demoralize radicals.

"Allegations that any of our grand juries are being
utilized to harass, intimidate, or otherwise discourage
citizens from exercising their constitutional freedoms are
absurd.
"What makes this strategy so effective," Donner
wrote last year, "is that the federal prosecuting officials
who themselves have no power of subpoena - are
using the coercive powers of the grand jury for police
and intelligence purposes."
Donner believes that the Justice Department is
facilitating its prosecutions of radicals by constructing
intricate "sociograms," which he defines this way:
Goodwin Denies Sociograms
"It is all a matter of friendships, affiliations,
communications, meetings, travels, finances, beliefs,
habits . . . This personal and seemingly innocuous data is
then fed into the IDIU data bank .. .[g] rand jury
testimony is thereby integrated with intelligence
gathered from all other sources, including illegal
electronic surveillance conducted by state as well as
federal authorities."
Prosecutor Goodwin, known at the Justice Depart
ment for his "computer-like mind," denies that SLS is
constructing sociograms. He told the Los Angeles Times,
"I don't even know what a sociogram is."
In a letter to this reporter about the San Francisco
Weatherpeople grand jury, Goodwin commented:
"I can assure you that the singular purpose of that
grand jury as well as other grand juries ~ . (I] have been
involved in is to investigate and present evidence of
specific violations of Federal law. Allegations that this or
any of our grand juries are being utilized to harass,
intimidate or otherwise discourage citizens, whatever
their political persuasion may be, from exercising their
constitutional freedoms arc absurd."

GUV L. GOODWIN
The Department of Justice's increased use of special
investigative grand juries in recent months has become a
major focal point for civil libertarians and political
activists.
The new wave of grand juries apparently has two
primary targets, "organized crime" and the "New Left."
In the East, grand juries generally devote more energy to
investigating "organized crime," while West Coast grand
juries, particularly those in the Bay Area, have
concentrated on crimes allegedly committed by political
activists.
Objections to grand juries fall into two basic
categories: procedural and motivational. Three groups in
particular have raised vocal objections to the grand
juries' present activities:
— Political activists and their attorneys frequently
charge that grand juries are used for purposes of
harassment, to conduct investigations that the FBI has
been unable to complete, and that prosecutors
frequently use "tainted evidence" — that is, evidence
that has been gathered illegally - during their
presentations.
— Newspaper reporters, writers, editors, and, in some
cases, academicians c}aim that their forced "third party"
testimony before grand juries interferes with their ability
to maintain confidential relationships with news sources.
— Civil libertarians and some law professors complain
that grand juries are now being utilized so extensively
that they now represent a major threat to individual
liberties.
Says one criminal legal scholar: "The grand jury has
always been uniquely susceptible to abuse. Occasional
abuses have always occurred, but today we are seeing
abuses on a scale and with a dramatic intensity unlike
anything we've ever seen before."
In California, as elsewhere, there are two types of
grand juries, county and federal. In theory, the federal
grand jury's sole function is to determine whether or not
there is sufficient evidence to bring federal charges
against people, groups or corporations.
The county grand jury, however, is charged with (1)
considering criminal indictments for violations of the
state penal code; (2) considering misdemeanor violations
committed in or triable in the county; (3) evaluating the
needs of the county; (4) investigating the expenditure of
public monies; and (5) investigating the conduct of
public officials.
Both types of grand juries usually are composed of 23
people. County grand juries are often selected from a list
of prominent citizens nominated on an annual basis by
superior court judges. Federal grand juries are selected at
random from voter registration lists.
Increasing Disuse
The county grand jury has fallen into increasing disuse
insofar as criminal matters are involved. Local
prosecutors (district or state's attorneys) usually find it
easier — and speedier — to proceed by direct accusation
(known as an "information") rather than to go through
a grand jury investigation. In California, about 95
percent of all cases are prosecuted in this manner.
County grand juries, therefore, usually spend most of
their time investigating matters related to county
government, such as local jail operations, airports and
port authorities, and school budgets.

"By and large, grand juries do as they are requested
by prosecutors and they do it with cafeteria speed."
On the federal level, the Organized Crime Control Act
of 1970 in effect mandated U.S. District Courts to
empanel special investigative grand juries on a regular
basis. These grand juries meet specifically to look into
"organized crime" and the "New Left," the latter an
area that appears to frustrate most Justice Department
investigations.
Deter Prosecutors
When grand juries first became institutionalized in this
country, one of their purposes was to deter zealous
prosecutors and to protect the citizenry. As recently as
1972, the Supreme Court said of the grand jury:
"Historically, this body has been regarded as a
primary security to the innocent against hasty, malicious
and oppressive persecution; it serves the invaluable
function in our society of standing between the accuser
and the accused, whether the latter be an individual,
minority group, or other, to determine whether a charge
is founded upon reason or was dictated by an
intimidating power or by malice and personal ill will."
Amsterdam's Views
Law Prof. Anthony G. Amsterdam, some of whose
clients have been among those subpoenaed before
federal investigative grand juries, believes prosecutors
completely dominate the proceedings. Says Amsterdam:
"Lawyers who run grand juries are in a situation as
close to that of God as any human being on this earth.
That is to say that they arc all-powerful within their own
little world, because the grand jury essentially gets no
instructions on the law from anybody but the lawyer
who is running it.

"The [prosecutor] decides when (the grand jurors]

present, most witnesses are reluctant or unable to
exercise their rights.
A witness can be compelled to testify if he is granted
immunity. Such immunity does not protect him from
prosecution; he may not, however, be prosecuted on the
basis of testimony he is compelled to give. Failure to
testify after immunity has been granted usually results in
a witness being cited for contempt of court. Sentences in
cases such as these usually run as long as 18 months, the
maximum term of a grand jury.
'Inevitable'
Amsterdam believes that the outcry raised by radicals
and civil libertarians "is simply the inevitable result of
the bureaucratic focusing of grand juries on radicals."
"The hardline law and order attitude of Mitchell and
Kleindienst is totally unsolicitous of individual rights,"
he contends. "They simply could not give less of a damn

"The present attitude of the Nixon administration
is . . . that if there's any convenience interest at all to be

about the weight on the other side. You go ahead and

Tandem Grand Juries
Tandem (cooperative) grand juries, Amsterdam says,
are "traditional" but "not legally proper."
"You've got a nationwide network of grand juries all
engaged in the quest after subversives, so that the kind
of cooperation which you fortuitously would get in
individual cases between one grand jury and another in
the old days was nothing compared to the cooperation
between the grand juries that's going on now."
But John Kaplan, another Law School professor and
former federal prosecutor, disagrees with Amsterdam
and others who are concerned about possible grand jury
abuse. The only reason that recent grand juries have
attracted attention, he believes, "is that radicals scream
louder than other people."
'Witch-Hunt'
"Many is the case 1 know when there was a grand jury
investigation that was denounced near and far as an
absolute witch-hunt persecution. Finally the grand jury
returned an indictment, and everyone trooped in and
pleaded guilty," he says
Kaplan terms the citizen-protection aspect of the
grand jury system "quite unimportant. The purpose of
the [federal] grand jury is to pass on [approve]
indictments brought before it by the prosecutor."
He concedes, however, that grand juries only rarely
turned down his requests for indictments. Some of his
presentations, he says, lasted "maybe 20 seconds."
'Cafeteria Speed'
"By and large," he wrote several years ago, "grand
juries today do as they are requested by prosecutors and
they do it with cafeteria speed."
Kaplan says that in the federal system the grand jury
is used as an executive subpoena by agencies such as the
Justice Department and the FBI which, by themselves,
cannot compel testimony.
That practice, among others, leads to "an awful lot of
violations of what we think are normally regarded as the

that. Maybe our ideas as to what have been the rights of
the citizen are not really accurate."
On both the county and federal level, it is possible
that a suspect may be indicted in connection with a
crime without even knowing that a grand jury has
considered his case. The suspect does not have the right
to cross-examine witnesses who testified against him.
In some states (excluding California), a suspect may
never see a transcript of the grand jury hearing at which
he was indicted. There are also different evidentiary
rules that apply to grand jury proceedings, so evidence
inadmissible during a trial, such as hearsay, may be used
during a grand jury proceeding.
Broad Questions
Prosecutors frequently ask witnesses questions framed
in the broadest possible terms. One question asked of a
witness during a 1970 probe into the Weatherman
organization was as follows:
"I want you to describe for the grand jury every
occasion during the year 1970 when you have been in

attended by, or been any place when any individual
spoke whom you knew to be associated with or
affiliated with Students for a Democratic Society, the
Weatherman, the Communist Party or any other
organization advocating revolutionary overthrow of the
United States, describing for the grand jury when these
incidents occurred, where they occurred, who was
present and what was said by all persons there and what
you did at the time that you were in these meetings,
groups, associations or conversations."
Strict Secrecy
Grand jury investigations, both state and federal,
usually are conducted in strict secrecy. The public rarely
hears about them until they return indictments, which
are announced in open court, or, in the case of a "sealed
indictment," after the suspect is taken into custody.
The theory behind the secrecy is that investigations
that do not result in indictments or criminal complaints
may unfairly damage the reputations of those who have
been investigated.
However, many activists now contend that the secrecy

contact with, attended meetings conducted by, or
merely allows the government to "hide" what they
consider to be an unjust process from the public view.
Some believe that by bringing the grand jury process to
public attention they can force the government to end
its investigative role.
Many of the investigative grand juries are being run by
prosecuting attorneys from a 14-member section of the
Justice Department's Internal Security Division (ISD)
known as the Special Litigation Section (SLS). Until
recently, the ISD, which is responsible for prosecuting a
wide variety of crimes, including Selective Service
violations, spent most of its time reviewing FBI reports
about alleged radical activities.
The ISD reportedly maintains extremely close ties to
the FBI and controls the Justice Department's own
intelligence network, the Interdivisional Intelligence
Unit (IDIU). The IDIU has a broad responsibility for
observing anti-war and radical activities.
The SLS is headed by Guy L. Goodwin, a former
assistant U.S. attorney for Kansas now known to amny
activists as a "special prosecutor for the Nixon-Mitchell
gang." The SLS was created, in fact, by the Nixon
administration to prosecute "revolutionary terrorists."
Goodwin's Background
In his official Justice Department biography, Good
win describes himself as "an experienced federal
prosecutor who frequently represents the government in
matters growing out of civil disturbances and terrorist
activities."
In effect the Justice Department's "traveling pro
secutor," Goodwin spends as many as three weeks every
month directing special investigative grand juries from
coast to coast. He has personally conducted some of the
Justice Department's most publicized investigations,
including those of Leslie Bacon, the Berrigan brothers
and the Vietnam Veterans Against the War (VVAW).
Since late 1970, the SLS has been waging a
multi-faceted probe into "underground" revolutionaries
and "terrorists." Prior to that, the ISD and the IDIU
concentrated their efforts on ghetto surveillance and an
apparently fruitless investigation into the Black Panther
Party.
Three Broad Categories
During 1971, for example, at least 13 special federal
grand juries investigated political activists falling into
three broad categories: the "underground" revolu
tionaries (Weatherpeople), anti-war intellectuals (the
"Pentagon Papers"), and the Catholic Left (the Berrigan
brothers).
A recent Daily survey shows that at least eight special
federal grand juries, meeting in six cities, currently are
investigating "underground" revolutionaries — four of
whom are on the FBl's "Ten Most Wanted" list — as well
as political activists' means of support.
One special federal grand jury meeting in San
Francisco has conducted a two-month-long investigation
of Venceremos' alleged role in the escape of Chino
prison inmate Ronald Wayne Beaty. A prison guard
trainee was killed during that lynching. Two Los Altos
residents, neither of whom belongs to the revolutionary
organization, were jailed six weeks ago for refusing to
answer questions before this grand jury.
Weatherpeople Probe
A second grand jury in San Francisco apparently is
operating as a "tandem" grand jury with another
meeting in Detroit, Mich. These two grand juries are
attempting to track down and indict a long list of federal
fugitives, many of them identified as Weatherpeople,
including Mark Rudd, Kathy Boudin and Bernadine
Dohrn.
One man from Oregon was jailed in early January for
refusing to testify before this San Francisco grand jury.
Three others testified in December only after the
Supreme Court refused to consider their cases.
The Detroit grand jury recently returned a single
count indictment against 15 people charging them with
conspiring to bomb police facilities, a police officer's
home and military facilities in several states.
'War Council'
Most of those named in the Detroit indictment are
identified as Weatherpeople who attended a January,
1970 "war council" at Flint, Mich. Newspaper reports

indicated that some 400 people attended that
conference.
The 15 defendants — four of whom are in custody,
according to late reports - are charged with conspiring
to make and possess unregistered explosives and to
transport them across state lines "to destroy police
installations and other civic, business and educational
buildings throughout the country and to kill and injure
persons therein."
Another 24 persons are named in the indictment as
co-conspirators. However, no charges have been lodged
against members of this group.
IRA Gun-Running
A third grand jury in San Francisco is investigating
alleged gun-running by American citizens acting on
behalf of the outlawed Irish Republican Army. Most of
the witnesses who have appeared before this grand jury
were subpoenaed from Butte, Mont., a community with
a large Irish-American population. Several persons were
jailed in November for refusing to answer questions
before this grand jury, which, like the other two sitting
in San Francisco, has returned no indictments.
Other grand juries presently are meeting in Cleveland,
Ohio (another Weatherpeople investigation), Los Angeles
(various activities in the student community of Isla
Vista, Calif.), Ft. Worth, Tex. (Irish Republican Army
activities centered in New York City), and a small town
in Arizona (the Beaty escape). '
Several grand juries scattered throughout the country
investigated VVAW activities during the 1972 Republi
can National Convention at Miami Beach, Fla., but these
panels apparently have not met recently.
VVAW Grand Juries
However, one of the VVAW grand juries indicted or
re-indicted seven VVAW members in December for
allegedly plotting to disrupt the convention. One
non-member was also indicted.
The eight are charged with conspiring to attack Miami
Beach police stations with automatic weapons, fire
bombs and other devices. Two of those indicted are
regional VVAW coordinators.
Currently, there appear to be no ongoing investiga
tions of the Catholic Left. The most recent investigation
into anti-war intellectuals ended in late November after a
Harvard University researcher spent six days in jail for
refusing to answer questions before a Boston grand jury
apparently investigating the leak of the "Pentagon
Papers" to The New York Times.
Harassment
Many witnesses before SLS grand juries believe
questions are asked of them not for fact-finding but for
purposes of harassment. Their lawyers appear to have no
great respect for the section's prosecutorial ability or
tactics. These lawyers point out that many convictions
(usually on conspiracy charges) obtained by the SLS are
reversed on appeal.
One lawyer, who asked not to be named, said the ISD
"is the dumping grounds for the entire Justice
Department." "
Sen. Sam Ervin (D.-N.C.), one of the Senate's
watch-dogs of personal liberties, recently told the Los
Angeles Times:
"We ought to put the grand jury back into its proper
function. In the federal system, the function of the
grand jury is being perverted. The grand jury is supposed
to be a judicial body. It is not supposed to go out and
Find evidence for the government."
'Chosen Instrument'
Frank J. Donner, who heads the American Civil
Liberties Union's Project on Political Surveillance, views
the SLS grand juries "as a 'chosen instrument' of a
[Nixon] administration strategy to curb dissent and to
intimidate and demoralize radicals.

"Allegations that any of our grand juries are being
utilized to harass, intimidate, or otherwise discourage
citizens from exercising their constitutional freedoms are
absurd.
"What makes this strategy so effective," Donner
wrote last year, "is that the federal prosecuting officials
who themselves have no power of subpoena - are
using the coercive powers of the grand jury for police
and intelligence purposes."
Donner believes that the Justice Department is
facilitating its prosecutions of radicals by constructing
intricate "sociograms," which he defines this way:
Goodwin Denies Sociograms
"It is all a matter of friendships, affiliations,
communications, meetings, travels, finances, beliefs,
habits . . . This personal and seemingly innocuous data is
then fed into the IDIU data bank .. .[g] rand jury
testimony is thereby integrated with intelligence
gathered from all other sources, including illegal
electronic surveillance conducted by state as well as
federal authorities."
Prosecutor Goodwin, known at the Justice Depart
ment for his "computer-like mind," denies that SLS is
constructing sociograms. He told the Los Angeles Times,
"I don't even know what a sociogram is."
In a letter to this reporter about the San Francisco
Weatherpeople grand jury, Goodwin commented:
"I can assure you that the singular purpose of that
grand jury as well as other grand juries ~ . (I] have been
involved in is to investigate and present evidence of
specific violations of Federal law. Allegations that this or
any of our grand juries are being utilized to harass,
intimidate or otherwise discourage citizens, whatever
their political persuasion may be, from exercising their
constitutional freedoms arc absurd."
