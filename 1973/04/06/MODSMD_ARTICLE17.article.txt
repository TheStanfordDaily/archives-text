# Housing Filled To Capacity
## 
### 
The residence hall business is in
serious trouble on many campuses
across the country. From 1966 to
1971, the percentage of students
living in college housing nationally
dropped from 29 to 23 percent.
The New York State University at
Buffalo had to fill one empty
dorm with elderly local residents.
NYU had a 25 percent vacancy
rate despite offering some rooms
free, others at discounts up to 50
percent. Other universities in the
Midwest are turning empty dorms
into offices and labs, and Stony
Brook turned one 300-bed
dormitory into a conference
center.
At Stanford, the story is
different.
Single student housing is filled
to over capacity, and the waiting
list each autumn is long.
There's room on campus for
about 80 percent of the
undergraduate student body and,
says Larry Horton, associate dean
for residential education, "our
goal is to provide every student
with a place on campus."
Why are Stanford residences
filled, when students elsewhere
prefer to live anywhere but a
campus dorm? "I think it's
because of our educationally- and
counseling-based housing system,
all of it related to the individual,"
says Horton. "But realistically,
some students aren't interested in
educational opportunities in the
dorms, and so we offer lots of
living-style options."
"Stanford has one of the most

flexible housing programs
anywhere," says Alan A.
Cummings, manager of residences
and fraternities.
"Variety is one of our greatest
assets," he said. "There is
something to suit various
lifestyles, and we are willing to
adapt to new ideas."
Although some students always
want to live off-campus, what is
being offered must be desirable,
because each year now, more and
more students try to find space in
University residences. The present
figure—80 percent of
undergraduates being housed—is
one of the highest in the nation.
Options offered through the
residence draw system include
coed houses, all women's and all
men's houses, minority program
houses, special program houses
such as co-ops, trailers, and
apartments.
And once a student takes over
a room, it's his or hers to decorate
as desired.
"If a student wants to paint a
room"' says Cummings, "we
provide paint and equipment. We
have an approved spectrum of
colors, but if other colors are
preferred, that's all right, too. All
we ask is that it be returned to its
original state by June, because
income from summer conferences
helps offset our costs."
There is no room maid service
anymore, and no one enters a
student room, except for
maintenance, unless the student
so requests. But the biggest

change in years is the emphasis on
education and advising in the
residences. Every dorm has a
multidisciplinary team of faculty
advisers, who begin their work
each autumn quarter with
newly-arriving freshmen. Their
work is conducted in the
residence, and they are regular
guests for dinner or sherry hours.
"Having the faculty present in
the dorms, either as teachers,
advisers, or resident fellows, is
very important," says Horton.
"Too many students come to
their senior year without knowing
anyone who can write a
recommendation. "The impact
isn't felt now; in many cases, it's
beyond a student's
comprehension while he or she is
here. But it is felt in a few years."
Prof. Mark Mancall, pioneer in
residence-based education says
students taking dorm-based
freshman seminars "have a better
view of what education is all
about. They have an intimate
relationship with faculty and
study a subject in depth, all
within their own dorm. "Students
should see learning itself as a way
of life which invades all
activities."
Prof. Mason Yearian,
coordinator of the residence
advising system, notes that "in the
old days, the dorm was solely a
place to live." Now, he says,"the
residence experience is an integral
part of the entire University
activity."

Cummings, manager of residences

"Variety is one of our greatest
assets," he said. "There is
something to suit various
lifestyles, and we are willing to
adapt to new ideas."
Although some students always
want to live off-campus, what is
being offered must be desirable,
because each year now, more and
more students try to find space in
University residences. The present
figure—80 percent of
undergraduates being housed—is
one of the highest in the nation.
Options offered through the
residence draw system include
coed houses, all women's and all
men's houses, minority program
houses, special program houses
such as co-ops, trailers, and
apartments.
And once a student takes over
a room, it's his or hers to decorate
as desired.
"If a student wants to paint a
room"' says Cummings, "we
provide paint and equipment. We
have an approved spectrum of
colors, but if other colors are
preferred, that's all right, too. All
we ask is that it be returned to its
original state by June, because
income from summer conferences
helps offset our costs."
There is no room maid service
anymore, and no one enters a
student room, except for
maintenance, unless the student
so requests. But the biggest

change in years is the emphasis on
education and advising in the
residences. Every dorm has a
multidisciplinary team of faculty
advisers, who begin their work
each autumn quarter with
newly-arriving freshmen. Their
work is conducted in the
residence, and they are regular
guests for dinner or sherry hours.
"Having the faculty present in
the dorms, either as teachers,
advisers, or resident fellows, is
very important," says Horton.
"Too many students come to
their senior year without knowing
anyone who can write a
recommendation. "The impact
isn't felt now; in many cases, it's
beyond a student's
comprehension while he or she is
here. But it is felt in a few years."
Prof. Mark Mancall, pioneer in
residence-based education says
students taking dorm-based
freshman seminars "have a better
view of what education is all
about. They have an intimate
relationship with faculty and
study a subject in depth, all
within their own dorm. "Students
should see learning itself as a way
of life which invades all
activities."
Prof. Mason Yearian,
coordinator of the residence
advising system, notes that "in the
old days, the dorm was solely a
place to live." Now, he says,"the
residence experience is an integral
part of the entire University
activity."

PLUSH ACCOMODATIONS While most universities across the
nation are showing seriously low occupancy rates, the University
housing system is filled to capacity. Stanford operates one of the most
flexible housing programs in the nation.
The residence hall business is in
serious trouble on many campuses
across the country. From 1966 to
1971, the percentage of students
living in college housing nationally
dropped from 29 to 23 percent.
The New York State University at
Buffalo had to fill one empty
dorm with elderly local residents.
NYU had a 25 percent vacancy
rate despite offering some rooms
free, others at discounts up to 50
percent. Other universities in the
Midwest are turning empty dorms
into offices and labs, and Stony
Brook turned one 300-bed
dormitory into a conference
center.
At Stanford, the story is
different.
Single student housing is filled
to over capacity, and the waiting
list each autumn is long.
There's room on campus for
about 80 percent of the
undergraduate student body and,
says Larry Horton, associate dean
for residential education, "our
goal is to provide every student
with a place on campus."
Why are Stanford residences
filled, when students elsewhere
prefer to live anywhere but a
campus dorm? "I think it's
because of our educationally- and
counseling-based housing system,
all of it related to the individual,"
says Horton. "But realistically,
some students aren't interested in
educational opportunities in the
dorms, and so we offer lots of
living-style options."
