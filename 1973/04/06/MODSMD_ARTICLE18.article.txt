# Cleanup Campaign
## 
### 
A massive clean-up and paint-up campaign concentrating on
the student activities area around White Memorial plaza on the
campus will be launched at 10 a.m. Saturday, April 7.
Faculty, staff and students have been invited to join up by
Dan DeYoung, director of plant services, Dean of Student Affairs,
James Lyons, and the University Relations staff. Walls, lamp
posts, benches, and trash cans will be repainted, fountains in the
Plaza and the Old Union courtyard will be drained and cleaned as
part of a long-term project to "make the University sparkle,"
according to DeYoung.
The Stanford Band and pompon dollies will entertain in the
Plaza between 11:30 a.m. and 1 p.m. Punch, coffee and other
refreshments will be served, "we're even planning to paint the
manhole covers," said DeYoung, whose Plant Services supervising
crew will have a variety of paint colors available.
