# Lava Covers Moon

What is probably the moon's
"primitive" surface, three to four
billion years old, lies buried under
about three-fourths of a mile of
lava flows and planetary dust, in
the opinion of Geophysics Prof.
Robert L. Kovach, principal
scientist for the lunar seismic
profiling experiment carried out
by Apollo 17 astronauts.
"The successful installation of
a geophysical station at the
Taurus-Littrow landing site of the
Apollo 17 mission marked the
culmination of an exciting period
of manned lunar exploration and
vastly improved our knowledge of
the lunar interior," he told a
recent scientific conference in
Houston sponsored by the
National Aeronautics and Space
Administration (NASA).
The results of Kovach's seismic
soundings also are in "outstanding
agreement" with gravity readings
taken at the site for another
experiment conducted by George
A. Thompson, chairman of the
geophysics department, and Dr.
Manik Talwani, acting director of
Columbia's Lamont-Doherty
Geological Observatory.
The traverse gravimeter
readings made by the astronautics
indicated varying densities of rock
at the same locations sampled in
the seismic profiling experiment.
Kovach's experiment involved
four strategically placed
seismometers to record lunar
vibrations from eight explosive
charges, from the thrust of the
lunar module's ascent engine, and
from the subsequent crash of its

ascent stage on the lunar surface.
The eight explosive packages of
one-eighth to 6 pounds each were
placed at distances of about 300
feet to 1.6 miles away by the
astronauts. Detonateion was by
remote control.
"One of the more significant
events of the Apollo 17 mission
was the recording of the seismic
signal from the lunar module
ascent state, which struck the
lunar surface [about 6 miles]
southwest of the landing site in
the highlands of the South
Massif," Kovach said.
"Observation of the seismic
signals from this impact extended
the depth of penetration over that
which could be achieved solely
with the use of small explosive
charges," Kovach continued.
"Prior to the Apollo 17
mission there was a surprising gap
in our knowledge concerning the
nature of the upper [6 miles] of
the lunar crust," he added,
"because of the absence of
pertinent seismic travel time data
at distances closer . than [20
miles]." Travel times of the
seismic waves are a direct means
of determining the underlying
geologic structure," he explained.
Even so the experimenters'
nearest explosive package was
over 300 feet away, and this kept
them from finding any definite
boundary between the dark,
powdery surface material and the
first layer of denser rock below.
The dividing line therefore may or
may not be a sharp one, Kovach
and his associates say.

The traverse gravimeter
readings made by the astronautics
indicated varying densities of rock
at the same locations sampled in
the seismic profiling experiment.
Kovach's experiment involved
four strategically placed
seismometers to record lunar
vibrations from eight explosive
charges, from the thrust of the
lunar module's ascent engine, and
from the subsequent crash of its

ascent stage on the lunar surface.
The eight explosive packages of
one-eighth to 6 pounds each were
placed at distances of about 300
feet to 1.6 miles away by the
astronauts. Detonateion was by
remote control.
"One of the more significant
events of the Apollo 17 mission
was the recording of the seismic
signal from the lunar module
ascent state, which struck the
lunar surface [about 6 miles]
southwest of the landing site in
the highlands of the South
Massif," Kovach said.
"Observation of the seismic
signals from this impact extended
the depth of penetration over that
which could be achieved solely
with the use of small explosive
charges," Kovach continued.
"Prior to the Apollo 17
mission there was a surprising gap
in our knowledge concerning the
nature of the upper [6 miles] of
the lunar crust," he added,
"because of the absence of
pertinent seismic travel time data
at distances closer . than [20
miles]." Travel times of the
seismic waves are a direct means
of determining the underlying
geologic structure," he explained.
Even so the experimenters'
nearest explosive package was
over 300 feet away, and this kept
them from finding any definite
boundary between the dark,
powdery surface material and the
first layer of denser rock below.
The dividing line therefore may or
may not be a sharp one, Kovach
and his associates say.
What is probably the moon's
"primitive" surface, three to four
billion years old, lies buried under
about three-fourths of a mile of
lava flows and planetary dust, in
the opinion of Geophysics Prof.
Robert L. Kovach, principal
scientist for the lunar seismic
profiling experiment carried out
by Apollo 17 astronauts.
"The successful installation of
a geophysical station at the
Taurus-Littrow landing site of the
Apollo 17 mission marked the
culmination of an exciting period
of manned lunar exploration and
vastly improved our knowledge of
the lunar interior," he told a
recent scientific conference in
Houston sponsored by the
National Aeronautics and Space
Administration (NASA).
The results of Kovach's seismic
soundings also are in "outstanding
agreement" with gravity readings
taken at the site for another
experiment conducted by George
A. Thompson, chairman of the
geophysics department, and Dr.
Manik Talwani, acting director of
Columbia's Lamont-Doherty
Geological Observatory.
