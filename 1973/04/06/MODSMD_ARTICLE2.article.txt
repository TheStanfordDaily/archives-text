# Wounded Knee Pact Ends Indian Seizure
## 
### Associated Press 
WOUNDED KNEE, S.D. - A six-point
agreement was signed yesterday
between the government and militant
Indians to end the 37-day takeover of
Wounded Knee, federal officials said.
According to the agreement:
— Russell Means, leader of the
occupying Indians, will go to
Washington tomorrow to meet with
White House representatives.
— Once that meeting starts, the
Indians will leave Wounded Knee,
submit to arrest and be taken to Rapid
City for arraignment.
— There will be a federal
investigation of Indian affairs
throughout the Pine Ridge reservation
and an audit of tribal funds.
— The Department of Justice is to
consider and where appropriate bring
civil suits to protect the legal rights of
all individual Oglala Sioux Indians
against unlawful uses or abuses by
tribal government or federal authority.
—A presidential treaty commission
will be set up to reexamine the 1868
government treaty with the Sioux
Nation.
— Indian leaders and White House
representatives will meet next month
in Washington to consider Indian
affairs.
The agreement serves as the basis
for the Indians laying down their arms
and the evacuation of all bunkers and
roadblocks in and around Wounded
Knee. It provides that the disarming
will be implemented by government
law enforcement officers with the
cooperation of the American Indian
Movement (AIM) leadership. .
Means called the occupation "a
minor preliminary victory. The real
victory will be when the traditional
chiefs and head men of the Sioux
tribes meet with representatives of the
White House."
Asst. U.S. Atty. Gen. Kent Frizzell,
who signed the agreement for the
government, said, "I don't think any
great victory has been won by anyone
at Wounded Knee. I think we have all
learned something here and now hope
we will go on and improve conditions
between whites and Indians. I think
what we have learned is that all of us
have failed in the past to live up to our
agreements. We're going to do a better
job in the future to see that these

agreements are kept."
Frizzell said the truce does not
provide for amnesty for anyone
connected with the takeover. "All
persons for whom warrants are
outstanding will be arrested," he said.
The agreement was signed by three
AIM leaders: Means, Clyde Bellecourt
and Carter Camp; by Pedro
Bisonnette, vice president of the
Oglala Sioux Civil Rights Organization,
and by Chief Tom Bad Cobb, a
traditional Oglala Sioux chief.
The pact was signed in the tepee on
a hill overlooking the village. A Sioux
religious ceremony and smoking of a
peace pipe preceded the signing, with
all AIM leaders, including Banks,
participating, along with Frizzell.
The agreement came after six
straight days of talks to end the
takeover of the historic site.
More than 250 Indians, led by AIM,
moved into the village the night of
Feb. 27, ransacked the Wounded Knee
Trading Post and told the 11 residents
they were political prisoners.

outstanding will be arrested," he said.
The agreement was signed by three
AIM leaders: Means, Clyde Bellecourt
and Carter Camp; by Pedro
Bisonnette, vice president of the
Oglala Sioux Civil Rights Organization,
and by Chief Tom Bad Cobb, a
traditional Oglala Sioux chief.
The pact was signed in the tepee on
a hill overlooking the village. A Sioux
religious ceremony and smoking of a
peace pipe preceded the signing, with
all AIM leaders, including Banks,
participating, along with Frizzell.
The agreement came after six
straight days of talks to end the
takeover of the historic site.
More than 250 Indians, led by AIM,
moved into the village the night of
Feb. 27, ransacked the Wounded Knee
Trading Post and told the 11 residents
they were political prisoners.
WOUNDED KNEE, S.D. - A six-point
agreement was signed yesterday
between the government and militant
Indians to end the 37-day takeover of
Wounded Knee, federal officials said.
According to the agreement:
— Russell Means, leader of the
occupying Indians, will go to
Washington tomorrow to meet with
White House representatives.
— Once that meeting starts, the
Indians will leave Wounded Knee,
submit to arrest and be taken to Rapid
City for arraignment.
— There will be a federal
investigation of Indian affairs
throughout the Pine Ridge reservation
and an audit of tribal funds.
— The Department of Justice is to
consider and where appropriate bring
civil suits to protect the legal rights of
all individual Oglala Sioux Indians
against unlawful uses or abuses by
tribal government or federal authority.
—A presidential treaty commission
will be set up to reexamine the 1868
government treaty with the Sioux
Nation.
— Indian leaders and White House
representatives will meet next month
in Washington to consider Indian
affairs.
The agreement serves as the basis
for the Indians laying down their arms
and the evacuation of all bunkers and
roadblocks in and around Wounded
Knee. It provides that the disarming
will be implemented by government
law enforcement officers with the
cooperation of the American Indian
Movement (AIM) leadership. .
Means called the occupation "a
minor preliminary victory. The real
victory will be when the traditional
chiefs and head men of the Sioux
tribes meet with representatives of the
White House."
Asst. U.S. Atty. Gen. Kent Frizzell,
who signed the agreement for the
government, said, "I don't think any
great victory has been won by anyone
at Wounded Knee. I think we have all
learned something here and now hope
we will go on and improve conditions
between whites and Indians. I think
what we have learned is that all of us
have failed in the past to live up to our
agreements. We're going to do a better
job in the future to see that these

agreements are kept."
Frizzell said the truce does not
provide for amnesty for anyone
connected with the takeover. "All
persons for whom warrants are
outstanding will be arrested," he said.
The agreement was signed by three
AIM leaders: Means, Clyde Bellecourt
and Carter Camp; by Pedro
Bisonnette, vice president of the
