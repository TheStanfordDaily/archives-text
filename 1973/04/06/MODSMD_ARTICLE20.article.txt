# SRI Reports Revenue Gain
## 
### 
Stanford Research Institute's
gross revenues totalled $70.5
million last year, it was
announced this week. The figure
represented a seven percent
increase over 1971, and was the
third straight record figure.
Sprawling over 70 acres of
Menlo Park, SRI is one of
America's largest and best-known
think tanks. Its staff of 2600
highly trained specialists solves
problems and does research in
many fields, including highly

classified research.
According to a statement
issued by SRI President Charles A.
Anderson and Chairman of the
Board E.H. Wasson, $53 million
came from U.S. government
sponsored research — an increase
of $6 million over 1971. Some
$26.7 million came from
defense-related agencies.
However, non-governmental
revenues declined slightly for the
year.
Net income for the year was
$838,000, after allowing for a
payment of $561,000 to the
University stemming from SRl's
separation from Stanford in 1970.
As a not-for-profit corporation,
SRI pays no dividends. Surplus
revenues are re-invested in the
operation.
