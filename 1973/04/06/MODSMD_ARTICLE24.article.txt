# Nicaraguans Reconstructing Quake-Shattered Managua

MANAGUA, Nicaragua—AP—Billboards on the few
open roads into earthquake-ravaged Managua
proclaim, "1973—Year of Hope and
Reconstruction."
Three months after the tragedy, in which at least
10,000 died, the center of this Central American
capital resembles a bombed-out city.
Yet brigades of laborers working in the swirling
dust—most with only their bare hands—have
brought a sense of order and confidence to Managua
despite the huge rebuilding task ahead.
Shortly after midnight last Dec. 23, the ground
began to move in the heart of Managua.
Seismologists said the earth fell nearly half a foot.
One six-story downtown hotel sank by one floor,
crushing to death guests who didn't have time to
flee. "I thought the end of the world had come,"
said Cesar Hernandez, a government chauffeur. He
was talking to a visitor as they stood atop the
Managua post office and surveyed hundreds of
blocks of rubble where some 300,000 persons once
lived.
"My house was down there," he said, pointing to
a debris-strewn lot. "The ground was moving
sideways and up and down. I got out. My two
brothers died. We found their bodies two days later.
I can tell you sir, it was a black Christmas for us."
Three studies were made to determine how much
damage was done by the quake, and the best
estimate was half a billion dollars.
In suburban parts of the capital the damage was
scattered. On some residential blocks, families are
living in tents on the front lawns of their ruined
homes. On other streets, only hairline cracks in
plaster walls bear witness to the quake.
But in the center of Managua, the government
has erected six-foot-high barbed wire fences to
cordon off 589 city blocks where the epicenter of
the earthquake was located. Inside, some 5,000

"civil guardsmen" work to clear the rubble for 75
cents and two meals a day.
Three thousand bodies were officially accounted
for in the days following the quake. Heaps of bodies
were incinerated. The rest remain buried beneath
the rubble. Guardsmen uncover 60 to 80 bodies a
week.
Although most of Managua's small businesses
were temporarily disrupted after the earthquake,
almost all industry is back to normal. Many
factories were located away from the hard-hit center
city.
The U.S. government had 248 doctors and nurses
working in two Nicaraguan field hospitals nine
hours after the quake. Managua received $14 million
in goods and services from Washington within days,
much of it food for some 200,000 homeless
persons.
The United States granted $3 million more to
pay the wages of laborers cleaning up the damage.
Nicaraguan officials have signed for $20 million in
long-term loans. Part of this money is being used to
build new schools and temporary housing.
Anastasio Somoza, the 47-year-old commander
of the National Guard—the country's army—plans to
reconstruct the capital on top of the destroyed city,
although it will be greener with wider streets and a
smaller central population. "We can't afford to
move the capital," he told a visitor, "and it makes
no difference anyway. A quake can strike
anywhere."
The Somoza family has controlled Nicaraguan
affairs since the 19305. Somoza, a graduate of West
Point, could not succeed himself as president so he
now governs through a three-member ruling junta.
The reconstruction operation is bieng run from
the general's 100-acre suburban estate known as "El
Retiro,"—The Retreat.

move the capital," he told a visitor, "and it makes
no difference anyway. A quake can strike
anywhere."
The Somoza family has controlled Nicaraguan
affairs since the 19305. Somoza, a graduate of West
Point, could not succeed himself as president so he
now governs through a three-member ruling junta.

MANAGUA, Nicaragua—AP—Billboards on the few
open roads into earthquake-ravaged Managua
proclaim, "1973—Year of Hope and
Reconstruction."
Three months after the tragedy, in which at least
10,000 died, the center of this Central American
capital resembles a bombed-out city.
Yet brigades of laborers working in the swirling
dust—most with only their bare hands—have
brought a sense of order and confidence to Managua
despite the huge rebuilding task ahead.
Shortly after midnight last Dec. 23, the ground
began to move in the heart of Managua.
Seismologists said the earth fell nearly half a foot.
One six-story downtown hotel sank by one floor,
crushing to death guests who didn't have time to
flee. "I thought the end of the world had come,"
said Cesar Hernandez, a government chauffeur. He
was talking to a visitor as they stood atop the
Managua post office and surveyed hundreds of
blocks of rubble where some 300,000 persons once
lived.
"My house was down there," he said, pointing to
a debris-strewn lot. "The ground was moving
sideways and up and down. I got out. My two
brothers died. We found their bodies two days later.
I can tell you sir, it was a black Christmas for us."
Three studies were made to determine how much
damage was done by the quake, and the best
estimate was half a billion dollars.
In suburban parts of the capital the damage was
scattered. On some residential blocks, families are
living in tents on the front lawns of their ruined
homes. On other streets, only hairline cracks in
plaster walls bear witness to the quake.
But in the center of Managua, the government
has erected six-foot-high barbed wire fences to
cordon off 589 city blocks where the epicenter of
the earthquake was located. Inside, some 5,000

"civil guardsmen" work to clear the rubble for 75
cents and two meals a day.
Three thousand bodies were officially accounted
for in the days following the quake. Heaps of bodies
were incinerated. The rest remain buried beneath
the rubble. Guardsmen uncover 60 to 80 bodies a
week.
Although most of Managua's small businesses
were temporarily disrupted after the earthquake,
almost all industry is back to normal. Many
factories were located away from the hard-hit center
city.
The U.S. government had 248 doctors and nurses
working in two Nicaraguan field hospitals nine
hours after the quake. Managua received $14 million
in goods and services from Washington within days,
much of it food for some 200,000 homeless
persons.
The United States granted $3 million more to
pay the wages of laborers cleaning up the damage.
Nicaraguan officials have signed for $20 million in
long-term loans. Part of this money is being used to
build new schools and temporary housing.
Anastasio Somoza, the 47-year-old commander
of the National Guard—the country's army—plans to
reconstruct the capital on top of the destroyed city,
although it will be greener with wider streets and a
smaller central population. "We can't afford to
move the capital," he told a visitor, "and it makes
no difference anyway. A quake can strike
anywhere."
