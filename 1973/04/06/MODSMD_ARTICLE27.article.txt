# Pretentiousness Hampers Jules Siegel's Recent Book
## 
### DOYLE McMANUS 
"Jules," Joni Mitchell once
said, "is an absolute egomaniac."
She could not have been more
right. Jules Siegel's "Record" is an
interesting enough collection of
pretty good short stories,
resurrected magazine articles,
fragmentary autobiography, and
(for variety, one supposes) uneven
prose poems in mediocre
calligraphy.
While it makes fun reading, it is
shot clear through with a
pretentiousness that threatens to
eclipse what is often (but not
always) quite good writing.
"My articles are works of art,"
Siegel says — seriously. "They are
not journalism but history."
Ahem. Well, maybe. But
sometimes they're barely even
journalism.
"Midnight in Babylon" is easily
the collection's best piece — and
representative of Siegel's
viewpoint. From a dissertation on
Los Angeles despair — suicide and
traffic accidents in the
unaccustomed rain — it moves
easily into an interview with
James Taylor, and out again to
images of superstardom and
death.
Onto Something
There are the images of Bob
Dylan (as Taylor's inverse image),
Janis Joplin, Robert
Kennedy ... and the sense that
Siegel may be onto something,

that he may have caught hold of a
handle to the American psychic
dilemma.
But a little popstar
namedropping intrudes:, Siegel
talking with Dylan, Siegel getting
stoned with Paul Simon. And
some gratuitous autobiography:
Siegel taking job with superhype
"counterculture" magazine; Siegel
getting fired; Siegel breaking his
hip in front of his mother's
apartment. Now, really.
Then back on the track,
hopefully, with a ramble on
Robert Kennedy and mob
psychology. "It is possible," he
says, "that the only reason
Woodstock was so peaceful is that
it rained so hard." Possible
indeed; but as soon as Siegel
moves up on a good, pregnant
idea (like this one), he backs off
fast.
Implicit Coherence
In part, he is hoping for an
implicit coherence that will be so
subtle as to elude statement, the
conventional essay form. On the
other hand, there is a sense that
he is merely too tired and cynical
to spend time seriously advancing
chancy ideas.
It may be that Siegel, as a
confessed New Yorker, is simply
uninfected by the Caiifornian's
frontier belief that Utopia, or at
least a glimpse of same, is within
reach.
But one of the failures of the

'New Journalism' is that it has
embraced stylistic freedom only
to assume a cynical position; not
until a fuller vision is found will it
begin to accomplish its potential.
Taylor Interview
But back to "Midnight in
Babylon." Finally Siegel gets to
his interview (remember?) with
James Taylor. It's good music
journalism in the tradition of
"Rolling Stone" — where the
whole piece (surprise!) was first
published.
But its relation to the earlier,
more intriguing discourse on
superstardom and death is
tenuous and a bit disappointing.
That is, however, Siegel's best.
Most of the rest of the journalism
is pretty forgettable; much is
dated. "Bob Dylan," for example,
is downright mediocre, but it was
written in 1966 for the Saturday
Evening Post, so its faults can be
partially forgiven. "West of
Eden," on communes and
reprinted from "Playboy," is
surprisingly good and free of that
magazine's smirk.
The short stories are equally
uneven. The best fall just short of
brilliance — a real frustration. And
it soon becomes difficult to
distinguish the fiction from the
autobiographical pieces they
follow.
"In the Land of Morning Calm,
Deja Vu" is excellent. Set in
wartime Korea (where Siegel
himself served in this nation's
armed forces), it conveys a fine
sense of almost sublimated
cynicism and fatalism. Equally

notable is "The Evergreen Home,"
excerpted from a novel in
progress.
It is an engrossing Depression
narrative of an ex-convict, his
boss, the girl he moves in with and
marries. Much of its strength is in
the simplicity most of Siegel's
other stuff is too self-conscious to
achieve; there's a nice Isaac
Bashevis Singer flavor.
The unintended upshot of the
collection's three autobiographical
pieces and of the many
hand-printed aphorisms and
prose-poems throughout the book
is that Jules Siegel is not nearly as
interesting a person as he thinks
he is, at least when he beats the
subject to death.
"The Refugees" is not too bad;
but there Siegel talks not about
himself, but of his experience of
the general American dilemma of
these decades. "I am trying to
make you feel what I have felt,
not lecture you about the
sociology of change," he writes, at
once convincing and
melodramatic.
But "Record" is, after all, a
good step above the usual massage
and dope handbooks hawked by
Straight Arrow, so I suppose we
should all count our blessings.
In the end, Jules Siegel gives
evidence of more potential than
this book fulfills. What he should
have done was written five years
more, weeded out the crap, and
published only the best. In the
meantime, if you aren't up to
spending $3.95 for a mixed bag,
you can have my copy.
