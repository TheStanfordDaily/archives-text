# 'Dance Of Death' Displayed

### JOHN LOOMIS 
"What are you painting?"
asked the knights squire.
"This," replied the artist, "is
the Dance of Death."
"But why do you paint such an
awful thing?"
"To scare the people."
This dialogue as you probably
remember is from Ingmar
Bergman's popular "Seventh
Seal," a film about an individual
obsessed with his own imminent
death. The Dance of Death, which
runs through the "Seventh Seal,"
is a traditional theme and has a
long historical background that is
traced in a unique show at the
Stanford Museum. This show,
largely the work of Dr. Lorenz
Eitner, will be on display only

until April 22.
The Dance of Death can be
traced ultimately back to
literature. "Vers sur la Mort,"
1194, and the morality play
"Everyman" stand as excellent
examples of the use of the theme
of death. The Dance of Death first
appeared in art, to our knowledge,
in 1494 in frescoes at the
cemetery Les Innocents in Paris.
Reproduction
A reproduction of this dance is
in the museum. The popularizing
of this theme has several origins
not the least of which was the
advent of the Black Death. Death
was seen as the great equalizer,
the great democratizer. In the
series of exquisite miniatures by
Hans Holbein we see that death

comes to all: the king, the queen,
the Pope, the farmer, the child.
Holbein, and other artists of
the 15th and 16th centuries used
it to portray social types and
contemporary customs. Stefano
della Bella in 1646 turned Death
into a horrible raging figure slicing
through a battlefield.
The English caricaturists
Cruikshank and Rowlandson show
the dance with wit and a light
humor. Daumier in the later 19th
century used Death in his fervent
political statements. Yet,
throughout the various portrayals
of Death, its inescapability and its
inevitability are dominant themes
up to modern times.
Added Dimension
With the development of an
industrial society, the isolation of
the individual, and the
development of existentialism,
Death seems to have taken on an
added fearful dimension in
modern art. Marcel Roux made a
particularly hautning work in his
"Danse Macabre" series in which a
little girl is walking with a woman.
It is only upon second look
that one realizes that the hand the
girl is holding is a skeleton. The
etchings of Percy Smith portray
his horror at the tragedy of World
War I. Also included are two fine
works by Ensor and Munch.
The show finishes with a recent
work by Nathan Olivera in which
a skeleton-like figure stands in the
midst of a black void. This
isolated figure seems to bring back
the image of Bergman's Death
informing the inquisitive knight,
"There is only I."
The Stanford Museum is open
Tuesdays through Fridays from
10 a.m. to 5 p.m., Saturdays and
Sundays from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m.
The exhibition of the Dance of
Death will be on view until April
22.

Death seems to have taken on an
added fearful dimension in
modern art. Marcel Roux made a
particularly hautning work in his
"Danse Macabre" series in which a
little girl is walking with a woman.
It is only upon second look
that one realizes that the hand the
girl is holding is a skeleton. The
etchings of Percy Smith portray
his horror at the tragedy of World
War I. Also included are two fine
works by Ensor and Munch.
The show finishes with a recent
work by Nathan Olivera in which
a skeleton-like figure stands in the
midst of a black void. This
isolated figure seems to bring back
the image of Bergman's Death
informing the inquisitive knight,
"There is only I."
The Stanford Museum is open
Tuesdays through Fridays from
10 a.m. to 5 p.m., Saturdays and
Sundays from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m.
The exhibition of the Dance of
Death will be on view until April
22.

DANCE OF DEATH- Above is a plate from"The Dance of Death," now on display at the Stanford
Museum.
"What are you painting?"
asked the knights squire.
"This," replied the artist, "is
the Dance of Death."
"But why do you paint such an
awful thing?"
"To scare the people."
This dialogue as you probably
remember is from Ingmar
Bergman's popular "Seventh
Seal," a film about an individual
obsessed with his own imminent
death. The Dance of Death, which
runs through the "Seventh Seal,"
is a traditional theme and has a
long historical background that is
traced in a unique show at the
Stanford Museum. This show,
largely the work of Dr. Lorenz
Eitner, will be on display only

until April 22.
The Dance of Death can be
traced ultimately back to
literature. "Vers sur la Mort,"
1194, and the morality play
"Everyman" stand as excellent
examples of the use of the theme
of death. The Dance of Death first
appeared in art, to our knowledge,
in 1494 in frescoes at the
cemetery Les Innocents in Paris.
Reproduction
A reproduction of this dance is
in the museum. The popularizing
of this theme has several origins
not the least of which was the
advent of the Black Death. Death
was seen as the great equalizer,
the great democratizer. In the
series of exquisite miniatures by
Hans Holbein we see that death

comes to all: the king, the queen,
the Pope, the farmer, the child.
Holbein, and other artists of
the 15th and 16th centuries used
it to portray social types and
contemporary customs. Stefano
della Bella in 1646 turned Death
into a horrible raging figure slicing
through a battlefield.
The English caricaturists
Cruikshank and Rowlandson show
the dance with wit and a light
humor. Daumier in the later 19th
century used Death in his fervent
political statements. Yet,
throughout the various portrayals
of Death, its inescapability and its
inevitability are dominant themes
up to modern times.
Added Dimension
With the development of an
industrial society, the isolation of
the individual, and the
development of existentialism,
Death seems to have taken on an
added fearful dimension in
modern art. Marcel Roux made a
