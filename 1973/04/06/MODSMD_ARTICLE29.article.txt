# Once Around The Turntable
## New Albums Exhibit Varied Quality 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
Mother's Pride — Fanny —
(Reprise MS 2137)
This album is a real loser. It
features poor vocals, poorer
musicianship and inane lyrics.
Even the jacket is a wash-out.
Fanny was one of the first all
women rock groups and their
recording contract was probably
based more on this fact than on
talent. A few of the songs on this
album could be salvaged by a
decent group, but they still
wouldn't be real classics, even if
performed by the Beatles.
Drummer Alice de Buhr has a
voice like Mrs. Miller's and her
featured vocal, "Solid Gold," is
one of the worst songs I've ever
heard. The less said about this
album, the better. If you get it as
a gift, use it as a frisbee or melt it

into a fruit bowl. I

- Traffic - (Island S W 9323) j
c
Traffic has produced yet l
another in a long line of I
memorable albums. Traffic freaks i
like myself constantly argue about

which Traffic album is best, and
although this isn't my favorite, it
is still a very, very fine album.
Traffic has evolved into a very

fine jazz/rock sound and this
album features a perfect balance
of the two forms. Deciding which
is the best cut on the album is
almost as big a dilemma as
deciding on Traffic's finest album,
but I lean towards "Evening
Blue," which is simply an
undeniably beautiful song.
"Tragic Magic" is an

instrumental masterpiece, and all
the other cuts are also excellent.
Traffic is one of the most
melodious and the most
harmonious groups in all of rock
music and this album is truly
mellow — in the pre-cliche sense
of the word. I can still safely say
that Traffic has never produced a
bad album.

Grand Hotel — Procul Ha rum —
(Chrysalis CHR 1937)
The complaint of many older
people that "all rock music
sounds the same," is certainly
o v e r - gen e ralized and
narrow-minded, but it is not a
totally invalid statement. Much
rock music, especially in the AM
radio market, suffers from the
problems of constant repetition
and useless fads.
But there are a number of
groups which demonstrate true
innovation and creativity. The
Beatles naturally epitomize this
kind of group, but their
pre-eminence should not
overshadow the advances
introduced by numerous other
groups.
Procul Harum's first exposure
came with the AM hit, "Whiter
Shade of Pale," which I admit
isn't one of my all time favorites.
But the release of "Conquistador"
made me reconsider and I have
completely changed my mind

about the group over the past
year.
I consider "Conquistador" to
be one of the most creative songs
in recent memory and when I
heard Procul Harum live last year,
I discovered that their talent went
far beyond that single song.
Pianist/vocalist Gary Brooker,
who wrote the music for all of the
songs on the album, and lyricist
Keith Reid are absolute masters
and their talents are vividly
demonstrated in this outstanding
release.
Reid has matured into a
profound lyricist and "Toujours
L'Amour," "Fires" (Which Burnt
Brightly) and "Grand Hotel" are
all superlative poems. Brooker has
done some very impressive
symphonic arranging which
features his flawless piano
technique and perfectly
complements his singing. And to
show the full range of their talent,
the album's best song is a happy
rocker called "Robert's Box." The
album is a rare musical
experience.

like myself constantly argue about

which Traffic album is best, and
although this isn't my favorite, it
is still a very, very fine album.
Traffic has evolved into a very

fine jazz/rock sound and this
album features a perfect balance
of the two forms. Deciding which
is the best cut on the album is
almost as big a dilemma as
deciding on Traffic's finest album,
but I lean towards "Evening
Blue," which is simply an
undeniably beautiful song.
"Tragic Magic" is an

instrumental masterpiece, and all
the other cuts are also excellent.
Traffic is one of the most
melodious and the most
harmonious groups in all of rock
music and this album is truly
mellow — in the pre-cliche sense
of the word. I can still safely say
that Traffic has never produced a
bad album.

Grand Hotel — Procul Ha rum —
(Chrysalis CHR 1937)
The complaint of many older
people that "all rock music
sounds the same," is certainly
o v e r - gen e ralized and
narrow-minded, but it is not a
totally invalid statement. Much
rock music, especially in the AM
radio market, suffers from the
problems of constant repetition
and useless fads.
But there are a number of
groups which demonstrate true
innovation and creativity. The
Beatles naturally epitomize this
kind of group, but their
pre-eminence should not
overshadow the advances
introduced by numerous other
groups.
Procul Harum's first exposure
came with the AM hit, "Whiter
Shade of Pale," which I admit
isn't one of my all time favorites.
But the release of "Conquistador"
made me reconsider and I have
completely changed my mind

about the group over the past
year.
I consider "Conquistador" to
be one of the most creative songs
in recent memory and when I
heard Procul Harum live last year,
I discovered that their talent went
far beyond that single song.
Pianist/vocalist Gary Brooker,
who wrote the music for all of the
songs on the album, and lyricist
Keith Reid are absolute masters
and their talents are vividly
demonstrated in this outstanding
release.
Reid has matured into a
profound lyricist and "Toujours
L'Amour," "Fires" (Which Burnt
Brightly) and "Grand Hotel" are
all superlative poems. Brooker has
done some very impressive
symphonic arranging which
features his flawless piano
technique and perfectly
complements his singing. And to
show the full range of their talent,
the album's best song is a happy
rocker called "Robert's Box." The
album is a rare musical
experience.

Mother's Pride — Fanny —
(Reprise MS 2137)
This album is a real loser. It
features poor vocals, poorer
musicianship and inane lyrics.
Even the jacket is a wash-out.
Fanny was one of the first all
women rock groups and their
recording contract was probably
based more on this fact than on
talent. A few of the songs on this
album could be salvaged by a
decent group, but they still
wouldn't be real classics, even if
performed by the Beatles.
Drummer Alice de Buhr has a
voice like Mrs. Miller's and her
featured vocal, "Solid Gold," is
one of the worst songs I've ever
heard. The less said about this
album, the better. If you get it as
a gift, use it as a frisbee or melt it

into a fruit bowl. I
