# Arbitration Set For Wednesday
## Firemen's Union, University Dispute 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
An arbitration officer will hear
arguments Wednesday, April 18 on a
dispute between the University and
Local 112 of the International
Association of Firefighters over duty
assignments at the Stanford Fire
Department.
Tony Spitaleri, secretary-treasurer
of the union, vowed yesterday to
"close up" the department unless an
agreement acceptable to the union is
reached.
The dispute centers on the number
of consecutive hours a fireman can be
on duty. Shortly after the union
signed a contract with the University
last summer, Fire Chief Frank Jurian
virtually abolished the practice of
"stand-bys," which allowed firemen to
swap shifts and be on duty more than
24 hours in a row.
Switch Days
"Basically, stand-bys allow fellows
to switch days," said Spitaleri. "If you

had to go somewhere on a day you
were supposed to work, you could just
come to me and say, 'Tony, will you
go on stand-by for me?' Sometime
later, you'd return the favor for me."
Spitaleri charged that Jurian
abolished the system as "a vindictive
move" in retaliation for the difficult
contract negotiations last summer.
Jurian denies this, and says that the
system was abandoned in part because
of increased vacation benefits included
in the new contract. However, he
declined to specify any other reasons
until after the arbitration session.
Professional Arbiter
According to University legal
counsel Doug Barton, professional
arbiter John Lauritzen will preside
over the session. His decision would be
binding, although Barton says there
are "limited grounds of appeal" to the
courts in case of an "improper
decision."
"They [the courts] are generally

pretty reluctant to overrule an
arbiter's decision, though, and chances
are that his decision will be final," said
Barton.
If the decision goes against the
union, Spitaleri said yesterday, "we
will appeal as high as we can," and if
that fails "we will try by every means
to shut this place down."
Possible Picket Line
Although the union signed a no
strike-no lockout agreement with the
University last year, Spitaleri said they
might establish an informational
picket line. "Not too many guys
would cross it,"he said.
Barton said yesterday that the
University would regard such action as
"a violation of the contract," and
would take "appropriate action."
"We think the issue is whether the
chief has the right to establish duty
assignments," Barton said. But
Spitaleri asserts that Jurian's actions
"do not fall under management rights,

but under working conditions."
'Very Inconvenient'
"This will interrupt a lot of guys'
education, and will be very
inconvenient," Spitaleri said. "If it was
economic, if there was money
involved, well, we're levelheaded
enough to understand that. But it's
not .. . it's just a vindictive thing."
Jurian, however, denies that his
decision has interfered with any
firefighter's education, noting that
stand-bys are still allowable, but only
up to six hours. He also says that
money is involved — in administrative
and bookkeeping costs for keeping
track of shift changes.
Barton says he is "reasonably
confident that Tony doesn't really
believe" that Jurian was being
vindictive in changing the system, and
said that if Lauritzen's arbitration
decision is "sensible and proper, we'll
live with it" — even if it goes against
the University.
