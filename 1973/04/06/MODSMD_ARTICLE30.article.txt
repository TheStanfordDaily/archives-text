# Mouskouri, Athenians Perform At Stanford
## 
### DAN FORTE 
Tuesday night, April 3, Nana Mouskouri and the
Athenians appeared in Memorial Auditorium.
Although Mouskouri is relatively unknown to
American audiences, she is currently Europe's most
popular female vocalist.
Harry Beloafonte said of Mouskouri, "She is
unforgettable." I might be inclined to agree, but
probably not for the same reasons.
Mouskouri studied classical music for eight years
at the Athens Conservatory and later started singing
jazz. The influence of classical music was readily
apparent in her performance Tuesday night, but I
couldn't detect even the faintest hint of any jazz
elements.
Most of what Mouskouri and her five-man combo
did could only be described as (for lack of a more
legitimate term) popular-ethnic-folk music. She sang
songs in French and Greek, as well as in English. Her
voice was good, but nothing to write home about.
I found the staging of Mouskouri's act to be a
little on the over dramatic side. With the stage only
dimly lit, The Athenians started playing some low,
soft chords, then with one thunderous note and one
bright spotlight Nana Mouskouri sprang onto the
stage looking like the average middle-aged
housewife. It just seemed slightly out of place.

The Athenians included two acoustic guitarists,
an electric bassist, a drummer, and a bouzouki
player. A bouzouki is a stringed instrument which
looks something like a guitar, and has a sound which
lies somewhere between a sitar, a mandolin, and a
harpsichord. I think it had eight strings. (It's not
easy counting tuning pegs from row Q.)
Among the many folk songs Mouskouri sang was
a nice version of "Let It Be." Mouskouri wisely
chose to sing it the way the Beatles wrote it, rather
than try to rearrange it as far too many popular
singers unfortunately attempt to do.
When Mouskouri broke into the first verse of a
Greek folk song called "Wilderness," there were
several cheers from the crowd which included a
substantial number of Greeks.
So, why did Belafonte say Nana Mouskouri was
unforgettable? Although I'm sure I won't rush out
to buy the Athenians first record, and I won't
remember her performance for more than a few
minutes after I finish typing this, there was a
definite quality in Mouskouri's music that set it far
apart from anything I'd heard previously. I think
the Greek songs were the most effective, mainly
because of the bouzouki player, who was obviously
talented.
