# Spring Teams Face Big Weekend In Los Angeles
## Spikers Need Miracle Against Nation's Best 
### MARK WHITE 
It is an assignment some liken
to playing the Bruin basketball
team, but Stanford track coach
Payton Jordan has geared himself
and his team for tomorrow's
double-dual track meet with
UCLA at Drake Stadium in Los
Angeles. California will meet USC
in a simultaneous competition.
"When you meet a team that
has won the NCAA Championship
two years in a row and has so
much talent and depth in every
event, you simply gear yourself
for the best individual
performances possible," says
Jordan. "Our objective is to make
those events where we have the
talented people as competitive as
possible, and we are going to go
into this thing with pride and
determination."
Stanford showed pride during
spring break with a third place
showing at the Santa Barbara
Relays March 24, and a victory
over Occidental 100-54 March 31,
but the Bruins were even prouder
when they produced seven
lifetime bests in thrashing
perennial track powers Kansas and
Tennessee, 108-44-40 in a
triangular meet last Saturday.
Tomorrow freshman Terry
Albritton will have to nearly
reproduce his record 61-514 put to
beat UCLA's shotputters, two of
whom have gone over 60 feet.
Bruin Dave Schiller won last week
at 60-lOV2, while his teammate
Roger Freberg has putted 59-5
and also throws the discus 194-10.
Jim Howard, Stanford's discus
thrower, has a best of 174-2.
UCLA's Warren Edmonson set
a stadium and meet record with a
9.3 hundred clocking in last year's
100-45 Bruin victory, but
Edmonson has graduated to the
pro track circuit and has been
replaced h v Gordon Peppars, a 9.7
man v' best race is the 220.
Ken Curl will lead Stanford's
sprint contingent, but he might
have to record his lifetime bests
(9.3 and 21.1) to win.
John Anderson will have a
tough battle against three UCLA

men who have run the 440 under
47.5. Cardinal Brian Mittelstaedt
could be tough in the 880-though;
his 1:52.9 is under UCLA's Ruben
Sancez's 1:53.9. Vemell Jackson
could also score in the half mile.
The mile should be one of the
more exciting races of the meet
since Mittelstaedt's 4:08.9 and
Les McFadden's 4:09.6 of last
weekend are better times than
those of UCLA's top milers,
though not by much. Tony
Sandoval should also be a favorite
in another good race, the three
mile.
Tom Long has a good chance
to do well in the 440 intermediate
hurdles, especially if he repeats
last season's 52.1, which earned
him second in the Pac-8. Long and
Dave Bagshaw will have to run
lifetime bests to place in the 120
high hurdles, though, as UCLA
has three men under 14.0.
UCLA's Rory Kotinek slung
the javelin 246-2 last week, so
Cardinal Steve Hopkins will be
hard pressed to win. Kotinek
exemplifies UCLA's power in the
field events — a 6-8 high jumper
and a 24-10 long jumper, Kotinek
is only third or fourth best behind
his gifted teammates.
James McAllister and Finn
Bendixen regularly long jump over
25 feet and Rick Fletcher high
jumps 6-10 week after week. Tom
Anderson will probably have to
jump 24-6 and 6-4 to place for
Stanford.
Rod Utley will have to triple
jump over 49 feet to place against
UCLA's Milan Tiff (53-0).
Francois Tracanelli pole vaulted
17-5 for UCLA last week, and
with Ron Mooers behind him at
16-6, Ken Kring will also be hard
pressed to place.
If Kurt Schoenrock (9:21.2) or
Dick Day (9:32.6) could
somehow coax Gordon Innes
(8:55.0) to break his leg or drown
in the water-hazard, Stanford
might win the steeplechase.
The same could be said for the
Stanford team as a whole —
victory is remotely possible, but
hardly likely.
