# Cards Meet USC, UCLA
## Tough Challenge For Netmen 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
Stanford's undefeated tennis
team will face its toughest
challenges of the season today and
tomorrow when it plays USC and
UCLA in Los Angeles.
"At best, we have a 50-50
chance to win either match. When
we play again up here, I'd rate our
chances at about 60-40," Coach
Dick Gould said.
Today's USC match will mark
the first large meet ever held at
the Trojans' new David X. Marks
tennis stadium, and an overflow
crowd in excess of 1,000 is

anticipated. A crowd of over
2,000 should attend the UCLA
match tomorrow.
The Trojans boast no less than
three foreign players in their top
six, led by sophomore
all-American Paul Ramirez.
Ramirez, a member of the
Mexican Davis Cup team, has been
hampered by wrist problems, and
earlier this year was defeated by
Sandy Mayer, the Cards' first
singles player.
Sashi Menon, a member of
India's Davis Cup team, will likely
play fourth singles against Gery

Groslimond, with freshman
Michael Wayman of England at
sixth singles against Pat DuPre.
Gould predicted that John
Andrews would play second
singles for the Trojans, with Mike
Machette holding the third singles
slot. Andrews is best-known for
superb ground strokes, while
Machette is characterized as "the
best server on the team" by Coach
George Toley.
Freshman John Holladay,
noted for his backhand, will
probably play fifth singles against
John Whitlinger, another
freshman known for the same
stroke.
SC's first doubles team of
Menon and Ramirez should give
Rick Fisher and Gery Groslimond
a good battle, as these two teams,
along with UCLA's Jeff Austin
and Bob Kreiss, are generally
considered the best in the
country.
Stanford has beaten USC three
straight times, most recently 6-3
at the National Indoor
Championships in Madison, Wise.
The UCLA Bruins, although
they also bowed to Stanford 6-3
at Madison, have talent which
man-for-man closely approaches
that of Stanford, and thus, there
are many three-set matches
whenever the teams meet.
Austin, the Bruins' top player,
has lost to Mayer twice, but both
times the match went into three
sets.
At second singles, Bob Kreiss is
a junior Wimbledon champion
who is 1-1 in previous matches
with Jim Delaney, Stanford's
second player. Stanford does have
an edge at third singles, however,
since Rick Fisher recently beat
Steve Krulevitz in straight sets.
South Africa's Rayno Segars,
who earlier this year beat
Groslimond, will likely play
against him once again at fourth
singles. Brian Teacher, the fifth
player on the UCLA squad, beat
Pat DuPre in February but will
likely be matched against
Whitlinger now, as the two
Stanford freshman have switched
places. DuPre's probable
opponent is Steve Mott.
Austin and Kreiss are 1-1 this
year with Groslimond and Rick
Fisher, so the first doubles match
should be the most exciting for
the fans.
