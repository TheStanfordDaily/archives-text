# Cards Open Pac-8 Baseball Play With Three Games Against Bruins
## 
### GLENN GARVIN 
Stanford's baseball team hasn't
done badly at all during the first
half of the season: it sports a 17-8
record against collegiate
competition, a .279 batting
average, a couple of phenomenal
freshmen, and a 12th-place
national ranking.
All this becomes more or less
academic this weekend, though,
because Pac-8 conference play
finally begins with the Cards
playing a three- game set with
UCLA in Los Angeles. If they
can't win against conference
teams, nothing else matters.
Wednesday the Cards played
their final non-league tuneup at
Sunken Diamond, routing USF
14-4. Junior Dave Frost picked up
the vicotry, his first since
exchanging his basketball uniform
for baseball equipment.
Patßusco, another member of
Coach Howie Dallmar's basketball
team, freshman Ray Anderson,
Frost and Bruce Robinson
sparked the offensive attack, as
each picked up at least two hits.
Coach Ray Young will send his
top pitchers to battle the
hot-hitting Bruins this weekend:
Bob DiPietro (3-0, 0.57), Dan

Shaw (4-2, 2.41) and Ken Grolle
(3-1, 2.03). The number one
reliever will be Nick Peterson (1-1,
2.04).
Fabulous Frosh
Leading the offense will be
freshmen Steve Davis and Bruce
Robinson. Davis, a shortstop, is
leading the team in batting with a
cool .400 average, and outfielder
Robinson is hitting .381. Davis
was the only Cardinal selected to
the Riverside all-tournament
team, while Robinson, a recent
addition to the lineup, hit .410
during the tourney.
The two frosh get some
impressive support from second
baseman A 1 O'Brien (.359) and
outfielder Bob Hampton (.338).
First baseman Mark Lucich is
swinging the bat at a .292 pace
and leads the team in runs batted
in with 14.
Although UCLA comes into
the series with a 15-9 record,
Young doesn't think this year's
Bruin squad is much better than
the one that finished 32-33 last
year at the bottom of the Pac-8
Southern Division.
Weak Pitching?
"They're probably very
comparable to what they were last
year," Young told the Daily.
'They've had a pretty good
hitting ball club, but I don't think
their pitching is much." Young
admitted he wasn't an expert on
UCLA, though: "We haven't seen
them play at all, and I don't know
everything that I should."
The Bruins, 0-2 in Pac-8 play
with both losses at the hands of
USC, center their attack around

third baseman Bob Adams.
Adams, honorable mention for
all-conference last year as a
sophomore, is hitting .329 with
six doubles, six homers, and 25
RBIs.
In addition, he's scored 24
runs, which means he's figured in
nearly a third of UCLA's run
production. All of this accounts
for the fact that the UCLA sports
information department is
pushing him very hard for
AU-American honors.
Explosive Bats
Eight Bruin regulars besides
Adams are hitting over
.300—including infielder Tim
Doerr at .424—and the team as a
whole is batting .294 with 70
extra base hits (compared to
Stanford's 43).
"They've got that little
stadium down there and they
always manage to have a real
good-hitting team, so they're
always a threat," Young said.
"But we've had tremendous
success there over the past few
years."
The foul lines at UCLA's
Sawtelle Field are only 310 feet,
while the power alleys are 340
feet and the center field fence 370
feet from the plate, a pitcher's
nightmare.
"They really stand up there
and swing the bat, but they don't
finesse you too much," Young
pointed out. "We just have to get
to them and put pressure on their
defense. We've been getting some
pretty good pitching—now we
have to go out and give it some
support."

top pitchers to battle the
hot-hitting Bruins this weekend:
Bob DiPietro (3-0, 0.57), Dan

Shaw (4-2, 2.41) and Ken Grolle
(3-1, 2.03). The number one
reliever will be Nick Peterson (1-1,
2.04).
Fabulous Frosh
Leading the offense will be
freshmen Steve Davis and Bruce
Robinson. Davis, a shortstop, is
leading the team in batting with a
cool .400 average, and outfielder
Robinson is hitting .381. Davis
was the only Cardinal selected to
the Riverside all-tournament
team, while Robinson, a recent
addition to the lineup, hit .410
during the tourney.
The two frosh get some
impressive support from second
baseman A 1 O'Brien (.359) and
outfielder Bob Hampton (.338).
First baseman Mark Lucich is
swinging the bat at a .292 pace
and leads the team in runs batted
in with 14.
Although UCLA comes into
the series with a 15-9 record,
Young doesn't think this year's
Bruin squad is much better than
the one that finished 32-33 last
year at the bottom of the Pac-8
Southern Division.
Weak Pitching?
"They're probably very
comparable to what they were last
year," Young told the Daily.
'They've had a pretty good
hitting ball club, but I don't think
their pitching is much." Young
admitted he wasn't an expert on
UCLA, though: "We haven't seen
them play at all, and I don't know
everything that I should."
The Bruins, 0-2 in Pac-8 play
with both losses at the hands of
USC, center their attack around

third baseman Bob Adams.
Adams, honorable mention for
all-conference last year as a
sophomore, is hitting .329 with
six doubles, six homers, and 25
RBIs.
In addition, he's scored 24
runs, which means he's figured in
nearly a third of UCLA's run
production. All of this accounts
for the fact that the UCLA sports
information department is
pushing him very hard for
AU-American honors.
Explosive Bats
Eight Bruin regulars besides
Adams are hitting over
.300—including infielder Tim
Doerr at .424—and the team as a
whole is batting .294 with 70
extra base hits (compared to
Stanford's 43).
"They've got that little
stadium down there and they
always manage to have a real
good-hitting team, so they're
always a threat," Young said.
"But we've had tremendous
success there over the past few
years."
The foul lines at UCLA's
Sawtelle Field are only 310 feet,
while the power alleys are 340
feet and the center field fence 370
feet from the plate, a pitcher's
nightmare.
"They really stand up there
and swing the bat, but they don't
finesse you too much," Young
pointed out. "We just have to get
to them and put pressure on their
defense. We've been getting some
pretty good pitching—now we
have to go out and give it some
support."
Stanford's baseball team hasn't
done badly at all during the first
half of the season: it sports a 17-8
record against collegiate
competition, a .279 batting
average, a couple of phenomenal
freshmen, and a 12th-place
national ranking.
All this becomes more or less
academic this weekend, though,
because Pac-8 conference play
finally begins with the Cards
playing a three- game set with
UCLA in Los Angeles. If they
can't win against conference
teams, nothing else matters.
Wednesday the Cards played
their final non-league tuneup at
Sunken Diamond, routing USF
14-4. Junior Dave Frost picked up
the vicotry, his first since
exchanging his basketball uniform
for baseball equipment.
Patßusco, another member of
Coach Howie Dallmar's basketball
team, freshman Ray Anderson,
Frost and Bruce Robinson
sparked the offensive attack, as
each picked up at least two hits.
Coach Ray Young will send his
top pitchers to battle the
hot-hitting Bruins this weekend:
Bob DiPietro (3-0, 0.57), Dan

Shaw (4-2, 2.41) and Ken Grolle
(3-1, 2.03). The number one
