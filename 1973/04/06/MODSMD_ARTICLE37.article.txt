# Laxmen Lose First Game For Broken Stick
## 
### MARK WHITE 
Despite an outstanding five
goal performance by Butch
Hazlett, Stanford's lacrosse team
lost the first game of the Broken
Stick series to California, 10-8 on
Wednesday.
The Cards will try to improve
their 3-2 record when they host
the Marin Lacrosse Club
tomorrow afternoon at 1 p.m.
In a game which coach Pete
Schneider hoped to outmuscle the
Bears with rugged checking, it was
the Cards who stood around
Wednesday while Cal jumped off
to leads at the beginning of each
period, leads which the Cards
could never overcome.
Cal's ace midfielder Mike
Savage led an early game charge
which kept the ball in Stanford's
defensive zone four of the first
five minutes of the game.
Stanford midfielder Paul Yeuell
opened the shooting with a 20
foot shot from out front, but Cal
came right back with persistent
pressure and scored minutes later
on a 60 yard rush to take a 1-0
lead.

Without physical defensive
checking to back him up,
Stanford goalie Rob Owens had to
rely on good stick play and body
blocks to hold off the swarming
Bears. Although he had two close
shots carom off his chest, Owens
could not stave off the pressing
Californians forever, and Cal
scored two more first quarter
goals. Savage scored Cal's third
goal while the Cards were
shorthanded following Dave
Ruiz's head-slashing penalty.
Towards the end of the quarter
Stanford came out of its lethargy
and began to press the attack.
Hazlett's first goal culminated
prolonged Stanford pressure and
at the end of the quarter,
Stanford trailed 3-1.
Score Tied
Cal stunned the aroused Cards
with a well-executed rush to take
a 4-1 lead within seconds of the
start of the second quarter. The
Cardinals had trouble controlling
the ball, but Shelley Gordon
re-established Stanford's
momentum with his fifth goal of
the season at the 8:50 mark. Buzz
Haddow and Hazlett quickly
added two more and as the half
ended, the two teams were
knotted at 4-4.
While the halftime break
seemed to restore Cal's
confidence, it appeared to restore
Stanford's lethargy. Cal scored
three quick goals as the Cards
were reluctant to deliver checks.
Content to hold a three goal lead,
Cal relaxed and again the
momentum swung to the Cards.
Three more goals by Hazlett and
one by Haddow tied the game 8-8
midway in the fourth quarter.
Just when it seemed the Cards
might take their first lead of the
game, Cal's midfielders executed
two perfect scoring plays to take a
commanding 10-8 lead. The Cards
pressed desperately, but they
could not get the ball to Hazlett
as the Bears held on for the 10-8
victory.
The two teams will meet again
on April 24 to determine
possession of the Broken Stick
trophy.
