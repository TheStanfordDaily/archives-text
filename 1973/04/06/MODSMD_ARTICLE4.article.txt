# USE Proposes Affiliation With AFL-CIO Member
## 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
The Executive Committee of the
United Stanford Employees (USE)
yesterday unveiled its proposed
affiliation agreement with the Service
Employees International Union
(SEIU) of the AFL-CIO.
A pamphlet outlining the accord
was distributed at an open meeting of
the USE attended by 45 persons. All
members of the USE will be asked to
ratify the agreement in balloting next
Thursday.
The accord, if ratified, would mean
that the USE would become a local
(No. 680) of the SEIU, and would
receive at least $3000 from that group
in the upcoming representation
election, for 1600 University
employees who hold a variety of jobs.
Jim Berk, chairman of the USE
negotiations committee, emphasized
that the affiliation would give the USE
maximum local autonomy.
For example, Berk noted the
passage in the agreement stating that
the USE would have full freedom "to
engage in political, educational, and
social activity of its own choosing."

Berk also noted that the SEIU
waived one of its rules so that each
member of the local will have to pay
only $1.30 to the national union,
whereas the SEIU constitution
requires dues at five dollars per person
per month.
The total cost to members of the
local, if it is established as the official
bargaining agent, will eventually total
$1.68 per month, including payments
to three state and local organizations.
In return for this payment, the USE
will receive assistance in further
organizing of University employees,
training programs for employees, and
assistance in negotiating collective
bargaining agreements, among other
benefits.

All this is conditional on the USE
winning the representation election,
the date for which may be set today
when a National Labor Relations
Board (NLRB) examiner comes to
campus. The NLRB examiner will
meet with representatives of the
University, the USE, and the Stanford
Joint Council to set a date for the

election.
The Stanford Joint Council
includes Local 101 of the American
Federation of State, County, and
Municipal Employees (AFSCME) and
Local 3 of the International Union of
Operating Engineers, both of which
are members of the AFL-CIO.
Berk said he had learned that
Teamsters Local 856, which last year
attempted to organize the labor
division, will not return this year, so
that the only two groups seeking to
organize the entire division will be the
Joint Council and the USE.
However, Berk warned that three
unions will seek to disassociate a total
of 11 University Press employees from
the entire labor group, and that this
may force delays.
"We may have to make some
compromises," Berk said, "so that the
election can be held as soon as
possible," preferably during the first
week in May.
Bob Anderson, an International
Organizer for the SEIU, was asked
whether the AFL-CIO permitted two
of its members to run against each
other in an election such as this one.
Open Field
"Nobody has yet established
bargaining rights at Stanford. The field
is open until then. The only thing the
AFL-CIO does insist on is that no
smear tactics can be used in the
election against another AFL-CIO
member."
Anderson added that once one of
the groups has established bargaining
rights at Stanford, no other group
from the AFL-CIO will be able to
tamper with that agreement.
Anderson told the USE members
that the SEIU is flexible enough so
that "no one will interfere with you so
long as you keep your books straight.
You will expend 99 percent of your
hostilities within yourselves and have
little energy left over," to quarrel with
the SEIU's national management.
Another blunt speech Anderson
made was received with an ovation
from the audience. "You will not get
what you need to keep people out on
strike. You are not buying into that
big a pie. Your strength depends on
your own efforts.
"The history of labor is the history
of a lot of people getting smashed. A
lot of people have lost at this game,"
Anderson said.

to three state and local organizations.
In return for this payment, the USE
will receive assistance in further
organizing of University employees,
training programs for employees, and
assistance in negotiating collective
bargaining agreements, among other
benefits.
NLRB Examiner Here
All this is conditional on the USE
winning the representation election,
the date for which may be set today
when a National Labor Relations
Board (NLRB) examiner comes to
campus. The NLRB examiner will
meet with representatives of the
University, the USE, and the Stanford
Joint Council to set a date for the

election.
The Stanford Joint Council
includes Local 101 of the American
Federation of State, County, and
Municipal Employees (AFSCME) and
Local 3 of the International Union of
Operating Engineers, both of which
are members of the AFL-CIO.
Berk said he had learned that
Teamsters Local 856, which last year
attempted to organize the labor
division, will not return this year, so
that the only two groups seeking to
organize the entire division will be the
Joint Council and the USE.
However, Berk warned that three
unions will seek to disassociate a total
of 11 University Press employees from
the entire labor group, and that this
may force delays.
"We may have to make some
compromises," Berk said, "so that the
election can be held as soon as
possible," preferably during the first
week in May.
Bob Anderson, an International
Organizer for the SEIU, was asked
whether the AFL-CIO permitted two
of its members to run against each
other in an election such as this one.
Open Field
"Nobody has yet established
bargaining rights at Stanford. The field
is open until then. The only thing the
AFL-CIO does insist on is that no
smear tactics can be used in the
election against another AFL-CIO
member."
Anderson added that once one of
the groups has established bargaining
rights at Stanford, no other group
from the AFL-CIO will be able to
tamper with that agreement.
Anderson told the USE members
that the SEIU is flexible enough so
that "no one will interfere with you so
long as you keep your books straight.
You will expend 99 percent of your
hostilities within yourselves and have
little energy left over," to quarrel with
the SEIU's national management.
Another blunt speech Anderson
made was received with an ovation
from the audience. "You will not get
what you need to keep people out on
strike. You are not buying into that
big a pie. Your strength depends on
your own efforts.
"The history of labor is the history
of a lot of people getting smashed. A
lot of people have lost at this game,"
Anderson said.

NATIONAL TIE-IN — Jim Berk, chairman of the United Stanford Employees'
(USE) Negotiations Committee, outlines USE's proposed affiliation with the
Service Employees International Union of the AFL-CIO. Berk spoke before 45
persons at an open USE meeting in the Graduate School of Business last night.
The Executive Committee of the
United Stanford Employees (USE)
yesterday unveiled its proposed
affiliation agreement with the Service
Employees International Union
(SEIU) of the AFL-CIO.
A pamphlet outlining the accord
was distributed at an open meeting of
the USE attended by 45 persons. All
members of the USE will be asked to
ratify the agreement in balloting next
Thursday.
The accord, if ratified, would mean
that the USE would become a local
(No. 680) of the SEIU, and would
receive at least $3000 from that group
in the upcoming representation
election, for 1600 University
employees who hold a variety of jobs.
Jim Berk, chairman of the USE
negotiations committee, emphasized
that the affiliation would give the USE
maximum local autonomy.
For example, Berk noted the
passage in the agreement stating that
the USE would have full freedom "to
engage in political, educational, and
social activity of its own choosing."

Berk also noted that the SEIU
waived one of its rules so that each
member of the local will have to pay
only $1.30 to the national union,
whereas the SEIU constitution
requires dues at five dollars per person
per month.
The total cost to members of the
local, if it is established as the official
bargaining agent, will eventually total
$1.68 per month, including payments
to three state and local organizations.
In return for this payment, the USE
will receive assistance in further
organizing of University employees,
training programs for employees, and
assistance in negotiating collective
bargaining agreements, among other
benefits.
