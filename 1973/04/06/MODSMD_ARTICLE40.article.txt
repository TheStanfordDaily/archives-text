# Women Coxswains Add Spirit To Cardinal Crew Team
## 
### MIKE CHASSON 
The Stanford Crew Association
will open its 1973 season when it
hosts the Conn Findlay Cup at the
Redwood Shores course
tomorrow morning, and for the
first time, some women coxswains
will be guiding the Cardinal
oarsmen.
Racing along with Stanford
will be Southern California,
Oregon State and Santa Clara. The
teams will be racing in eight-man
shells in the frosh, junior varsity,
lightweight varsity, and varsity
divisions.
Coaching the squad are varsity
coach Len Sherr and freshman
coach Doug Blayney. Sherr, who
is a graduate of Temple University
and participated in the 1971 Pan
American Games, is in his first
year as head coach. Blayney is a
former Stanford oarsmen, who
like Sherr, is in his first year.
The Crew Association has one
of its largest turnouts in the last
few years, with about 50
individuals participating in the
program. The Association recruits
new members primarily through
word of mouth and operates as a
club sport.
The team currently works out
in ihe morning from about 6.15
a.m. to 7:45 a.m., coven 4 about
6-10 miles each day. They row six
days a week and run stairs in the
afternoon on two of those days.
Finding time to train is a
problem for many of the oarsmen
as over half the team is pre-med.
During the winter the team
worked out in the afternoon and
many oarsmen had class conflicts
and missed workouts.
For the first time in its history
the team has female members.
Four girls have turned out to be
coxswains, the individual who
steers and verbally directs the
shell.
Like Any Coxswain
"We needed coxswains and I
told the team to get anybody they
could find, including girls,"
explained Sherr. "The girls are
currently like any novice
coxswain in their judgement."
Sherr believes the girls have
added a touch of color to the
team and will eventually develop
into as good as coxswain as any
boy. "They get a lot of static but
they have really improved," states
Sherr.
Two girls, Nancy Ditz and
Dawn Carper, will cox boats in
tomorrow's races."I really enjoy
the job," says Ditz. "The hard
part is learning to be
authoritative, for the coxswain
must be authoritative in the shell
to be effective."
This is the first year for the
lightweight varsity program, in
which each oarsmen can't weigh
over 160 pounds and the average
in the boat must be 155 pounds.
The lightweight program is very

popular in the East, but is just
gaining popularity on the West
Coast.

USC, Oregon State, and Santa Clara at the Redwood Shores course. A
new addition to the 1973 team are four women coxswains. Above, the
1972 team competes at the Western Sprints last May.
The Stanford Crew Association
will open its 1973 season when it
hosts the Conn Findlay Cup at the
Redwood Shores course
tomorrow morning, and for the
first time, some women coxswains
will be guiding the Cardinal
oarsmen.
Racing along with Stanford
will be Southern California,
Oregon State and Santa Clara. The
teams will be racing in eight-man
shells in the frosh, junior varsity,
lightweight varsity, and varsity
divisions.
Coaching the squad are varsity
coach Len Sherr and freshman
coach Doug Blayney. Sherr, who
is a graduate of Temple University
and participated in the 1971 Pan
American Games, is in his first
year as head coach. Blayney is a
former Stanford oarsmen, who
like Sherr, is in his first year.
The Crew Association has one
of its largest turnouts in the last
few years, with about 50
individuals participating in the
program. The Association recruits
new members primarily through
word of mouth and operates as a
club sport.
The team currently works out
in ihe morning from about 6.15
a.m. to 7:45 a.m., coven 4 about
6-10 miles each day. They row six
days a week and run stairs in the
afternoon on two of those days.
Finding time to train is a
problem for many of the oarsmen
as over half the team is pre-med.
During the winter the team
worked out in the afternoon and
many oarsmen had class conflicts
and missed workouts.
For the first time in its history
the team has female members.
Four girls have turned out to be
coxswains, the individual who
steers and verbally directs the
shell.
Like Any Coxswain
"We needed coxswains and I
told the team to get anybody they
could find, including girls,"
explained Sherr. "The girls are
currently like any novice
coxswain in their judgement."
Sherr believes the girls have
added a touch of color to the
team and will eventually develop
into as good as coxswain as any
