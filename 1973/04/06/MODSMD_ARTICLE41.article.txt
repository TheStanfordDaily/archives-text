# Golfers Compete At UOP Tourney
## 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
The golf team will go after its
second straight tournament
victory today, but this time the
Cards will have to do it without
Bruce Robertson.
Robertson, the team's former
number-one man, lost his amateur
status on Monday when the
United States Golf Association
ruled that the 20 year old
sophomore was guilty of a rules
violation involving the sale of golf
equipment.
"We'll just have to work a little
harder to pick up the slack," said
sophomore Conrad Nilmeier, "but
even without Bruce I think we
have one of the best teams in the
West Coast."
Today Nilmeier and his
teammates will have a chance to
prove themselves at the University
of Pacific golf championships, a
nine-team tourney which will be
held at the Dry Creek Golf Course
in Stockton. And since the Cards
would have won last week's
Pacific Coast Invitational even
without Robertson's score,
Stanford is rated the favorite in
today's 36 hole event.
San Jose State and Fresno
State are expected to give the
Cards some tough competition,
especially the Spartans, who have
been Stanford's nemesis the past
two seasons. Earlier this year SJS

defeated the Cards in Stanford's
18 hole tournament and the two
teams tied for first in the Cal
State Hayward tournament two
weeks later.
The next few days should be
equally exciting chapters in the
Card-Spartan golf rivalry.
Stanford and San Jose State will
probably battle it out for first
place today at UOP, and the two
teams will square off in a dual
match Monday at San Jose
Country Club.
Jim Knoll, Mark Lye, and Dean
May are San Jose State's top
individuals, and Stanford coach
Bud Finger will counter with a
lineup which includs Aly
Trompas, Dave Baskins, Nilmeier,
Denny Colvin, Bob Chapman, and
George Pettinger, who replaces
Robertson in the varsity lineup.
Pettinger played outstanding
golf for the Card freshman team
last year, but this will be his first
rmgor varsity test. "1 don't mind
telling you I'm nervous," said the
long-hitting sophomore from Red
Bluff, "but I've been playing
pretty well the last few days."
After today's tournament, the
golfers will return home
tomorrow for a 12 noon match
against California on the Stanford
course. The Card freshman team
will also be in action against the
Bears.

IT'S ALMOST THAT TIME AGAlN—Football coach Jack Christiansen welcomed his 1973 grid
candidates at a team meeting on Wednesday in preparation for the opening of spring practice on April 14.
Chris introduced the coaching staff, including new freshman coach Gunther Cunningham, and announced
that former Stanford greats Jeff Siemon, Pete Lazetich, and Mike Simone will be helping out at spring
practices. The players were also told that hair can be "as long as you want it" during spring workouts, but
must conform to "current standards" during the regular season.
