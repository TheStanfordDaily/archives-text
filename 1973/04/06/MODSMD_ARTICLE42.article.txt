# Women's Team Adds To Stanford Tennis Dynasty
## 
### PATRICIA LOWDON 
Women's tennis coach Ms.
Curly Neil predicts that her 1973
Stanford team "is the best in the
nation," which "will be proved"
June 10-16 at the Women's
National Collegiate tournament in
Auburn, Alambama.
If Neil's prediction comes true,
Stanford could boast two national
tennis champions since coach
Dick Gould's Men's team is the
odds-on favorite to win the NCAA
title. Tomorrow at 2 p.m.
Stanford fans will get a look at
the distaff side of the Cardinals'
budding tennis dynasty when the
women's team hosts Fresno State
at the women's courts.
Neil has logged nine
consecutive winning seasons, one
for every year at Stanford, but she
refuses to take any credit. "Our
players were always great when
they came here," she said.
This year should be no
exception. Among the
outstanding players who will
compete for Stanford against
Fresno State tomorrow are
sophomores Andrea Barnes and
Tracy McNair. Barnes defeated
McNair in last year's finals of the
Northern California
Intercollegiate Athletic
Conference tournament.
Junior Maureen O'Keefe is
slated to play third singles while
the doubles teams are sophomore
Whitney Grant and junior Terry
Albert; freshman Ann Feeley and
junior Vicki Van Dyke; freshmen
Meredith Brittain and Kathy
Capps; and junior Molly Tyson
and freshman Kathy Wright.
This will be Stanford's first
match of the quarter, but the
team already has two winter
quarter victories under its belt. On
March 6 the team shutout
Stanislaus State 6-0 and on March
13 Stanford defeated University
of Pacific 5-1.
Since women's intercollegiate

tennis has received adequate funds
this season (as opposed to last
year), the female netters will
compete in the Pacific Eight
tournament in Seattle on May
10-12. The following week
Stanford will host the NCIAC
playoffs, which will determine
Northern California's
representatives in the national
meet.
Also included on the 1973
schedule are the 20 team NCIAC
tournament 'at San Francisco
State, the Ojai Intercollegiates,
the Modesto Invitational
Collegiate Tourney, and five
upcoming dual meets.

DISTANCE HOPE — Senior Brian Mittelstaedt, who has recorded
times of 1:52.9 in the 880 and 4:06.9 in the mile, will be Stanford's
top hope in those events tomorrow in Los Angeles. The Cards will be
competing against UCLA in the double dual meet, while USC
simultaneously goes against California. (Story on page 10)
Women's tennis coach Ms.
Curly Neil predicts that her 1973
Stanford team "is the best in the
nation," which "will be proved"
June 10-16 at the Women's
National Collegiate tournament in
Auburn, Alambama.
If Neil's prediction comes true,
Stanford could boast two national
tennis champions since coach
Dick Gould's Men's team is the
odds-on favorite to win the NCAA
title. Tomorrow at 2 p.m.
Stanford fans will get a look at
the distaff side of the Cardinals'
budding tennis dynasty when the
women's team hosts Fresno State
at the women's courts.
Neil has logged nine
consecutive winning seasons, one
for every year at Stanford, but she
refuses to take any credit. "Our
players were always great when
they came here," she said.
This year should be no
exception. Among the
outstanding players who will
compete for Stanford against
Fresno State tomorrow are
sophomores Andrea Barnes and
Tracy McNair. Barnes defeated
McNair in last year's finals of the
Northern California
Intercollegiate Athletic
Conference tournament.
Junior Maureen O'Keefe is
slated to play third singles while
the doubles teams are sophomore
Whitney Grant and junior Terry
Albert; freshman Ann Feeley and
junior Vicki Van Dyke; freshmen
Meredith Brittain and Kathy
Capps; and junior Molly Tyson
and freshman Kathy Wright.
This will be Stanford's first
match of the quarter, but the
team already has two winter
quarter victories under its belt. On
March 6 the team shutout
Stanislaus State 6-0 and on March
13 Stanford defeated University
of Pacific 5-1.
Since women's intercollegiate

tennis has received adequate funds
this season (as opposed to last
year), the female netters will
compete in the Pacific Eight
tournament in Seattle on May
10-12. The following week
Stanford will host the NCIAC
playoffs, which will determine
Northern California's
representatives in the national
meet.
Also included on the 1973
schedule are the 20 team NCIAC
tournament 'at San Francisco
State, the Ojai Intercollegiates,
the Modesto Invitational
Collegiate Tourney, and five
upcoming dual meets.
