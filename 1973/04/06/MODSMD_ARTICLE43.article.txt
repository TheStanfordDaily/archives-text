Indochina Fighting Intensifies
SAIGON — North Vietnamese and Viet Cong forces
touched off the heaviest fighting since the cease-fire, the
Saigon government reported yesterday.
Military sources said the Communist command may be
preparing for a major offensive. But Pentagon officials in
Washington said they had no reason to believe an
offensive is planned.
At the same time, the military situation in neighboring
Cambodia remained serious. All highways to the capital,
Phnom Penh, remained cut as Communist regiments
tightened their noose around the city.
Cambodian dispatches reported continued ground
assaults on the major roads into Phnom Penh despite
heavy U.S. bombing.
In the fighting in South Vietnam, four government
positions came under artillery and ground attack at widely
scattered points in what military sources described as
"probing activity" to test Saigon's reactions and feel out
weak links.
Attempts by Canada and Indonesia on the
International Commission of Control and Supervision to
put a stop to the fighting bogged down in procedural
wrangles with Poland and Hungary, the commission's
other two members.
Wholesale Prices Rise
WASHINGTON - Wholesale prices again surged at record
levels last month, forecasting even higher retail prices for
consumers and threatening to undermine President
Nixon's Phase 3 economic controls.
The Labor Department reported Wednesday that the
Wholesale Price Index, a major indicator of the rate of
inflation, jumped 2.2 percent in March, the steepest
monthly hike since January 1951.
Farm products and proceesed foods led the way,
posting the fourth straight large monthly increase. The
wholesale price of consumer finished foods — those ready
to go on supermarket shelves - rose at a seasonally
adjusted rate of 4.6 percent, sharpest since the
government began keeping records in 1947.
Lumber prices also shot up at a record rate, and
industrial commodities as a group went up at the fastest
rate in 22 years.
The report drew an angry reaction from AFL-CIO
President George Meany, who again warned of big wage
increase demands this year "if the administration and the
Congress won't provide equity" by clamping controls on
prices, rents and interest rates.
Mississippi River Floods
ST. LOUIS - The flood waters of the Mississippi River
inched toward record crests yesterday while claiming six
lives, leaving thousands homeless and bringing property
damage estimates near $41 million in Missouri and Illinois.
President Nixon authorized the first peacetime call-up
of Coast Guard reserves to aid beleaguered flood workers.
They have been filling and piling sandbags for days to
reinforce levees weakened by incessant pounding from the
river.
The waters above St. Louis began to stabilize, but
federal officials said they did not expect a crest at St.
Louis until today.

More than 4000 persons have been driven from their
homes in Missouri and Southern Illinois, where the death
toll stands at five. Thousands of others have refused to
leave, and remain to protect their property.
Federal officials estimate that more than seven million
acres of land are under water in the Mississippi Valley and
delta regions from central Missouri to below Vicksburg,
Miss.
Nixon Vetoes Rural Water Grants
WASHINGTON — A bill that would require the spending
of an estimated $120 million for rural water grants was
vetoed by President Nixon yesterday- his second veto of
what he calls "inflationary" legislation passed by
Congress.
Nixon, who ordered the water grants cut off last Jan.
10, said in his veto message to Congress that the measure
probably was unconstitutional. It raised the question, he
said, of whether Congress can order the president to spend
thd full amount it appropriutec for a program.
Nixon's veto of the water measure was the latest
development in a struggle between the President and
Congress over his vetoes and his impoundment of money
allocated in legislation for certain programs.
The water gran.' legislation, said Nixon, "is
objectionable not orly in 'ts practical and economic
aspects but on the basic legal grounds as well."
He said passage of the measure, Oy a vote of 297 to 54
in the House March 1, v.*»s a "disservice to the
taxpayers .. . which lam not prepared to accept."
Speaker Cart Albert (D-Okla.), said the House will vote
next Tuesday on overriding the veto. "I think there is a
chance that it will," said Albert.
President Backs Oil Pipeline
SAN CLEMENTE — President Nixon ordered full
administration efforts yesterday toward clearing the way
for construction of the Alaska oil pipeline.
Nixon summoned Secretary of the Interior Rogers C.B.
Morton to the Western White House for a 45-minute
conference on a sunny patio overlooking the Pacific
Ocean.
Morton reported that the President said he "wanted me
to go all out, working with Congress and with the other
agencies involved in pursuing the construction of the
trans-Alaska pipeline which he feels is vital to the national
interest."
Congressional action is necessary before construction
of the $3 billion pipeline can begin because present law
prohibits granting of a right-of-way broad enough to build
it. The Supreme Court on Monday refused to review an
appeals court decision upholding that law.
The legislation sought by the administration would give
the secretary of the Interior broad discretion in fixing
right-of-way limits across public lands. The 1920 Mineral
Leasing Act limits pipeline rights of way on federal land
to 25-foot strips on each side of the line — a swath which
officials contend is too narrow to accommodate the
machinery necessary to build and maintain the pipeline.
Today's Weather
Fair through tomorrow except low clouds along the coast
extending inland locally late night and mornings. Cooler
today. Low tonight in the 40s. Highs today and tomorrow
in upper 50s near the coast to the upper 60s or low 70s

Ocean.
Morton reported that the President said he "wanted me
to go all out, working with Congress and with the other
agencies involved in pursuing the construction of the
trans-Alaska pipeline which he feels is vital to the national
interest."
Congressional action is necessary before construction
of the $3 billion pipeline can begin because present law
prohibits granting of a right-of-way broad enough to build
it. The Supreme Court on Monday refused to review an
appeals court decision upholding that law.
The legislation sought by the administration would give
the secretary of the Interior broad discretion in fixing
right-of-way limits across public lands. The 1920 Mineral
Leasing Act limits pipeline rights of way on federal land
to 25-foot strips on each side of the line — a swath which
officials contend is too narrow to accommodate the
machinery necessary to build and maintain the pipeline.
Today's Weather

Indochina Fighting Intensifies
SAIGON — North Vietnamese and Viet Cong forces
touched off the heaviest fighting since the cease-fire, the
Saigon government reported yesterday.
Military sources said the Communist command may be
preparing for a major offensive. But Pentagon officials in
Washington said they had no reason to believe an
offensive is planned.
At the same time, the military situation in neighboring
Cambodia remained serious. All highways to the capital,
Phnom Penh, remained cut as Communist regiments
tightened their noose around the city.
Cambodian dispatches reported continued ground
assaults on the major roads into Phnom Penh despite
heavy U.S. bombing.
In the fighting in South Vietnam, four government
positions came under artillery and ground attack at widely
scattered points in what military sources described as
"probing activity" to test Saigon's reactions and feel out
weak links.
Attempts by Canada and Indonesia on the
International Commission of Control and Supervision to
put a stop to the fighting bogged down in procedural
wrangles with Poland and Hungary, the commission's
other two members.
Wholesale Prices Rise
WASHINGTON - Wholesale prices again surged at record
levels last month, forecasting even higher retail prices for
consumers and threatening to undermine President
Nixon's Phase 3 economic controls.
The Labor Department reported Wednesday that the
Wholesale Price Index, a major indicator of the rate of
inflation, jumped 2.2 percent in March, the steepest
monthly hike since January 1951.
Farm products and proceesed foods led the way,
posting the fourth straight large monthly increase. The
wholesale price of consumer finished foods — those ready
to go on supermarket shelves - rose at a seasonally
adjusted rate of 4.6 percent, sharpest since the
government began keeping records in 1947.
Lumber prices also shot up at a record rate, and
industrial commodities as a group went up at the fastest
rate in 22 years.
The report drew an angry reaction from AFL-CIO
President George Meany, who again warned of big wage
increase demands this year "if the administration and the
Congress won't provide equity" by clamping controls on
prices, rents and interest rates.
Mississippi River Floods
ST. LOUIS - The flood waters of the Mississippi River
inched toward record crests yesterday while claiming six
lives, leaving thousands homeless and bringing property
damage estimates near $41 million in Missouri and Illinois.
President Nixon authorized the first peacetime call-up
of Coast Guard reserves to aid beleaguered flood workers.
They have been filling and piling sandbags for days to
reinforce levees weakened by incessant pounding from the
river.
The waters above St. Louis began to stabilize, but
federal officials said they did not expect a crest at St.
Louis until today.

More than 4000 persons have been driven from their
homes in Missouri and Southern Illinois, where the death
toll stands at five. Thousands of others have refused to
leave, and remain to protect their property.
Federal officials estimate that more than seven million
acres of land are under water in the Mississippi Valley and
delta regions from central Missouri to below Vicksburg,
Miss.
Nixon Vetoes Rural Water Grants
WASHINGTON — A bill that would require the spending
of an estimated $120 million for rural water grants was
vetoed by President Nixon yesterday- his second veto of
what he calls "inflationary" legislation passed by
Congress.
Nixon, who ordered the water grants cut off last Jan.
10, said in his veto message to Congress that the measure
probably was unconstitutional. It raised the question, he
said, of whether Congress can order the president to spend
thd full amount it appropriutec for a program.
Nixon's veto of the water measure was the latest
development in a struggle between the President and
Congress over his vetoes and his impoundment of money
allocated in legislation for certain programs.
The water gran.' legislation, said Nixon, "is
objectionable not orly in 'ts practical and economic
aspects but on the basic legal grounds as well."
He said passage of the measure, Oy a vote of 297 to 54
in the House March 1, v.*»s a "disservice to the
taxpayers .. . which lam not prepared to accept."
Speaker Cart Albert (D-Okla.), said the House will vote
next Tuesday on overriding the veto. "I think there is a
chance that it will," said Albert.
President Backs Oil Pipeline

probably was unconstitutional. It raised the question, he
said, of whether Congress can order the president to spend
thd full amount it appropriutec for a program.
Nixon's veto of the water measure was the latest
development in a struggle between the President and
Congress over his vetoes and his impoundment of money
allocated in legislation for certain programs.
The water gran.' legislation, said Nixon, "is
objectionable not orly in 'ts practical and economic
aspects but on the basic legal grounds as well."
He said passage of the measure, Oy a vote of 297 to 54
in the House March 1, v.*»s a "disservice to the
taxpayers .. . which lam not prepared to accept."
Speaker Cart Albert (D-Okla.), said the House will vote
next Tuesday on overriding the veto. "I think there is a
chance that it will," said Albert.
President Backs Oil Pipeline
SAN CLEMENTE — President Nixon ordered full
administration efforts yesterday toward clearing the way
for construction of the Alaska oil pipeline.
Nixon summoned Secretary of the Interior Rogers C.B.
Morton to the Western White House for a 45-minute
conference on a sunny patio overlooking the Pacific
Ocean.
Morton reported that the President said he "wanted me
to go all out, working with Congress and with the other
agencies involved in pursuing the construction of the
trans-Alaska pipeline which he feels is vital to the national
interest."
Congressional action is necessary before construction
of the $3 billion pipeline can begin because present law
prohibits granting of a right-of-way broad enough to build
it. The Supreme Court on Monday refused to review an
appeals court decision upholding that law.
The legislation sought by the administration would give
the secretary of the Interior broad discretion in fixing
right-of-way limits across public lands. The 1920 Mineral
Leasing Act limits pipeline rights of way on federal land
to 25-foot strips on each side of the line — a swath which
officials contend is too narrow to accommodate the
machinery necessary to build and maintain the pipeline.
Today's Weather
Fair through tomorrow except low clouds along the coast
extending inland locally late night and mornings. Cooler
today. Low tonight in the 40s. Highs today and tomorrow
in upper 50s near the coast to the upper 60s or low 70s
Indochina Fighting Intensifies
SAIGON — North Vietnamese and Viet Cong forces
touched off the heaviest fighting since the cease-fire, the
Saigon government reported yesterday.
Military sources said the Communist command may be
preparing for a major offensive. But Pentagon officials in
Washington said they had no reason to believe an
offensive is planned.
At the same time, the military situation in neighboring
Cambodia remained serious. All highways to the capital,
Phnom Penh, remained cut as Communist regiments
tightened their noose around the city.
Cambodian dispatches reported continued ground
assaults on the major roads into Phnom Penh despite
heavy U.S. bombing.
In the fighting in South Vietnam, four government
positions came under artillery and ground attack at widely
scattered points in what military sources described as
"probing activity" to test Saigon's reactions and feel out
weak links.
Attempts by Canada and Indonesia on the
International Commission of Control and Supervision to
put a stop to the fighting bogged down in procedural
wrangles with Poland and Hungary, the commission's
other two members.
Wholesale Prices Rise
WASHINGTON - Wholesale prices again surged at record
levels last month, forecasting even higher retail prices for
consumers and threatening to undermine President
Nixon's Phase 3 economic controls.
The Labor Department reported Wednesday that the
Wholesale Price Index, a major indicator of the rate of
inflation, jumped 2.2 percent in March, the steepest
monthly hike since January 1951.
Farm products and proceesed foods led the way,
posting the fourth straight large monthly increase. The
wholesale price of consumer finished foods — those ready
to go on supermarket shelves - rose at a seasonally
adjusted rate of 4.6 percent, sharpest since the
government began keeping records in 1947.
Lumber prices also shot up at a record rate, and
industrial commodities as a group went up at the fastest
rate in 22 years.
The report drew an angry reaction from AFL-CIO
President George Meany, who again warned of big wage
increase demands this year "if the administration and the
Congress won't provide equity" by clamping controls on
prices, rents and interest rates.
Mississippi River Floods
ST. LOUIS - The flood waters of the Mississippi River
inched toward record crests yesterday while claiming six
lives, leaving thousands homeless and bringing property
damage estimates near $41 million in Missouri and Illinois.
President Nixon authorized the first peacetime call-up
of Coast Guard reserves to aid beleaguered flood workers.
They have been filling and piling sandbags for days to
reinforce levees weakened by incessant pounding from the
river.
The waters above St. Louis began to stabilize, but
federal officials said they did not expect a crest at St.
Louis until today.

More than 4000 persons have been driven from their
homes in Missouri and Southern Illinois, where the death
toll stands at five. Thousands of others have refused to
leave, and remain to protect their property.
Federal officials estimate that more than seven million
acres of land are under water in the Mississippi Valley and
delta regions from central Missouri to below Vicksburg,
Miss.
Nixon Vetoes Rural Water Grants
WASHINGTON — A bill that would require the spending
of an estimated $120 million for rural water grants was
vetoed by President Nixon yesterday- his second veto of
what he calls "inflationary" legislation passed by
Congress.
Nixon, who ordered the water grants cut off last Jan.
10, said in his veto message to Congress that the measure
probably was unconstitutional. It raised the question, he
said, of whether Congress can order the president to spend
