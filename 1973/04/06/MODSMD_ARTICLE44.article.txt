# ASSU Announces Ballot Issues
## 
### 
ASSU President Scott Burke
yesterday announced two propositions
that are tentatively scheduled to be on
the ballot in the ASSU presidential
election, to be held April 18 and 19.
The first proposal would establish a
Legal Counseling Office (LCO) for
Stanford students and their spouses.
The second proposition is a set of
three amendments to the ASSU

constitution.
The LCO, proposed by Burke,
ASSU Vice President Peter Van
Petten, and William Bolger, president
of the Stanford legal aid society,
would provide advice, representation
and education on legal matters to
Stanford students and their spouses
only, as opposed to the recently
proposed Citizens Advocates at

Stanford, Inc.
A proposed budget of $11,000,
raised through a refundable fee
assessment of one dollar per student
during autumn quarter of 1973, would
cover the LCO's expenses for the
school year 1973-'74, a nine month
trial period. By the end of the year,
the LCO will have to "justify itself in
the students' eyes" in order to
continue, according to Burke.
One proposed ASSU constitutional
amendment would establish a
three-member commission vested with
final authority to interpret the
constitution. Presently, the Senate has
this power.
The other proposed amendment
would require that 20 percent of the
student body vote in a fee assessment
election before the assessment would
take effect.
The minimum figure of 20 percent
of the student body applies only to fee
assessment elections, and will not
pertain to the presidential election this
quarter, nor the Senate election next
autumn.
The final amendment would
strengthen the veto power of the
President.
Currently, the President cannot
veto the annual budget or emergency
appropriations passed by the Senate.
The amendment would give him the
power to veto any measure passed by
the Senate.
The amendment would also chage
the vote needed in the Senate to
override a presidential veto from a
simple majority to a three-fifths
majority.
