# Faculty Senate Postpones Recruiting Policy Decision
## 
### MARK SIMONIAN 
The Faculty Senate yesterday again
postponed a final decision regarding
the basic language for University
policy on affirmative action for
women in graduate schools.
Faculty representatives voted to
refer back to the Senate Steering
Committee the recommendation by
the Committee on Graduate Studies
(C-GS) on women's enrollment in
graduate study programs.
The C-GS resolution recommended
that all graduate departments "make
every effort" to distribute information
about graduate education and
professional careers available for
women, and to attract qualified
women applicants.
The committee suggested that the
Dean of Graduate Studies coordinate
all graduate affirmative action
programs and report to the Senate
annually on the status of the
programs. C-GS also provided
"plausible guidelines" to aid in
evaluating the progress in women's
enrollment figures.
In presenting the resolution to the
Senate, C-GS Chairman Philosophy
Prof. Julius Moravcsik wrote that his
committee considered "statistical
criteria ... to help define a proximal
goal" for affirmative action, but that
there "is currently no one set of data
that could be regarded as decisive."
Midway through discussion of the
C-GS resolution, Asst. German Prof.
Ann Snow introduced an amendment
providing that the Deans of all
graduate schools, rather than just the
Dean of Graduate Studies, report
annually to the Senate on the numbers
of women enrolled.
The amendment also stated that
deans whose schools have less than 40
percent women must make special
reports to the Senate. The 40 percent

figure, Snow commented, came from
the last year's Study of Graduate
Education at Stanford as an
appropriate guideline for women's
enrollment.
After much discussion, the Senate
referred the amendment to the
steering committee along with the
original C-GS recommendation for
further study and rewording.
In other Senate business, faculty
representatives
— approved a new interdisciplinary
program in Russian and East European
studies for the degree of Master of
Arts
— heard from Dean of the School
of Education Arthur Coladarci
— conferred Baccalaureate and
Advanced Degrees
— approved the appointment of
Assoc. Dean of Earth Sciences Konrad
Krauskopf to the Senate Steering
Committee.
