# Students Enter Conflicting Pleas
## 
### 
Junior Lee Christian Spieller pleaded guilty to one count of grand
theft, a felony, in a preliminary hearing yesterday before Judge Edward
Scoyen of the Palo Alto-Mountain View Municipal Court.
Co-defendant Eric Braun Test pleaded not guilty at the same hearing to
one count of conspiracy and two counts of grand theft.
Spieller and Test, both biology majors from Saratoga, were arrested
Feb. 12 for allegedly using illegally acquired requisition forms to obtain
merchandise from the University Stores Department.
Scoyen dismissed three other counts of theft and one conspiracy charge
against Spieller after his guilty plea. The judge referred Spieller's case to
Superior Court for certification and sentencing next Friday.
Following Spieller's testimony, Test's attorney suggested that the
testimony of an accomplice (presumably Spieller) is the only evidence
tying Test to the case.
Scoyen felt there was enough evidence to suggest that a crime had been
committed and sent the case to Superior Court, also next Friday.
The University Administration has also filed disciplinary charges against
Test and Spieller. According to prosecutor Gerald Halligan, their case is
still pending before the Campus Judicial Panel.
