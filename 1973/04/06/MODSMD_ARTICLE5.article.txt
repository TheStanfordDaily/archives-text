# Kirk Analyzes Academic Freedom
## 
### ROBERT BACON 
Universities have been the victims of "those who
cried 'freedom' but sought power," conservative
columnist Russell Kirk told a campus audience last
night.
His lecture touched off a lively discussion
dominated by Hoover Institution fellow Sidney
Hook and Assoc. History Prof. Barton Bernstein.
Kirk, second in a series of lecturers sponsored by
the Stanford Conservative Forum, said that in
recent years "we have suffered a loss of academic
freedom unparalleled in American history."
He laid the blame on ideologues, whom he
defined as "those who promise heaven on earth,
usually through violence . . . The university is the
last place where ideology ought to prevail. The
ideologue says he has all the answers; he has no need
for discussion. That's a thorough undermining of
the role of the university."
Discussion Follows
Following the address, the overflow crowd of
about 300 heard a discussion by Bernstein, Hook,
and Harvard Sociology Prof. Seymour Martin
I.ipset, now visiting the Center for Advanced Study
in the Behavioral Sciences here.
Bernstein accused Kirk of leaving out "the social
dimension." The cause of most campus
demonstrations, he said, was the Vietnam War. "The
universities have always been political," the
historian insisted. "The debate in the 1960s was not

between political and non-political, but over what
kind of politics."
Protesters "argued against some research because
of its purpose" — prosecution of the Vietnam War —
he claimed.
Hook, recently retired as a New York University
professor of philosophy, insisted that academic
freedom is not the same as first amendment
freedom and that the university as an institution
must steer clear of outside politics.
Academic freedom, he said, means "special
treatment" for professors. They must, he claimed,
be permitted to speak what appears to be nonsense,
with impunity. But with this freedom goes a
responsibility to abide by professional standards of
ethics, he said.
Kirk insisted that the chief danger to universities
today was from ideologues on the campuses. "You
can't have it both ways. You can't seek to destroy
the iastitution and simultaneously claim its
protection. If you can't agree with what the
institution does, leave. Don't incite riots," he said.
Hook agreed that the chief danger was internal,
but said it was not ideology but disruption — the
denial of others' academic freedom. Worthy social
cay&ps, he stressed, do not justify denial of a
professor's right to state his case.
Distinction Should Be Made
Bernstein argued that a distinction should be
made between ideas and military weaponry as

products of the university. Since ideas can be
resisted by the will, he said, they should not be
suppressed. But when the product of university
research "can be used by only one group for
weaponry, for killing, that's where I draw the line.'
Hook and Bernstein later argued the current
status of academic freedom. Hook claimed that
ideological persecution of professors, though
prevalent fifty years ago, largely disappeared in the
19305.
Bernstein, a so-called "revisionist" historian,
rejoined that those of his beliefs often have
difficulty obtaining university professorships due to
their ideology.
During his address, Kirk stressed that "order and
freedom exist in a tension. When that tension is
properly maintained, it produces justice." But when
it comes unbalanced, he said, either anarchy or
tyranny results.
The most discouraging facet of recent events on
the campuses, he said, was "servitude to
ideology .... The campus may appear to the
student to be becoming more free, but it may be
becoming subservient to an ideology."
He said that "Stanford has suffered as greatly as
any university from misunderstanding of academic
freedom."
"Many say 'academic freedom' but mean
'academic power' " — the right to deny others'
academic freedom, the columnist noted.

COLUMNIST COMMENTS — Russell Kirk, nationally-syndicated columnist and
author, spoke in Bishop Auditorium last night on "Academic Freedom and
Academic License." His lecture, to an overflow crowd of about 300, was
followed by a lively panel discussion of the issues he raised. The program was
sponsored by the Stanford Conservative Forum, a faculty-staff group.
Universities have been the victims of "those who
cried 'freedom' but sought power," conservative
columnist Russell Kirk told a campus audience last
night.
His lecture touched off a lively discussion
dominated by Hoover Institution fellow Sidney
Hook and Assoc. History Prof. Barton Bernstein.
Kirk, second in a series of lecturers sponsored by
the Stanford Conservative Forum, said that in
recent years "we have suffered a loss of academic
freedom unparalleled in American history."
He laid the blame on ideologues, whom he
defined as "those who promise heaven on earth,
usually through violence . . . The university is the
last place where ideology ought to prevail. The
ideologue says he has all the answers; he has no need
for discussion. That's a thorough undermining of
the role of the university."
Discussion Follows
Following the address, the overflow crowd of
about 300 heard a discussion by Bernstein, Hook,
and Harvard Sociology Prof. Seymour Martin
I.ipset, now visiting the Center for Advanced Study
in the Behavioral Sciences here.
Bernstein accused Kirk of leaving out "the social
dimension." The cause of most campus
demonstrations, he said, was the Vietnam War. "The
universities have always been political," the
historian insisted. "The debate in the 1960s was not

between political and non-political, but over what
kind of politics."
Protesters "argued against some research because
of its purpose" — prosecution of the Vietnam War —
he claimed.
Hook, recently retired as a New York University
professor of philosophy, insisted that academic
freedom is not the same as first amendment
freedom and that the university as an institution
must steer clear of outside politics.
Academic freedom, he said, means "special
treatment" for professors. They must, he claimed,
be permitted to speak what appears to be nonsense,
with impunity. But with this freedom goes a
responsibility to abide by professional standards of
ethics, he said.
Kirk insisted that the chief danger to universities
today was from ideologues on the campuses. "You
can't have it both ways. You can't seek to destroy
the iastitution and simultaneously claim its
protection. If you can't agree with what the
institution does, leave. Don't incite riots," he said.
Hook agreed that the chief danger was internal,
but said it was not ideology but disruption — the
denial of others' academic freedom. Worthy social
cay&ps, he stressed, do not justify denial of a
professor's right to state his case.
Distinction Should Be Made
Bernstein argued that a distinction should be
made between ideas and military weaponry as

products of the university. Since ideas can be
resisted by the will, he said, they should not be
suppressed. But when the product of university
research "can be used by only one group for
weaponry, for killing, that's where I draw the line.'
Hook and Bernstein later argued the current
status of academic freedom. Hook claimed that
ideological persecution of professors, though
prevalent fifty years ago, largely disappeared in the
19305.
Bernstein, a so-called "revisionist" historian,
rejoined that those of his beliefs often have
difficulty obtaining university professorships due to
their ideology.
During his address, Kirk stressed that "order and
freedom exist in a tension. When that tension is
properly maintained, it produces justice." But when
it comes unbalanced, he said, either anarchy or
tyranny results.
The most discouraging facet of recent events on
the campuses, he said, was "servitude to
ideology .... The campus may appear to the
student to be becoming more free, but it may be
becoming subservient to an ideology."
He said that "Stanford has suffered as greatly as
any university from misunderstanding of academic
freedom."
