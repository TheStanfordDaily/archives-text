# Whether 'Rationale Dialogue?'
## Students Fear Debate 
### 
James Lobsenz

One would think that Stanford
University, as an academic
community theoretically
dedicated to the pursuit of
knowledge and truth, would be
strongly committed to the ideal of
open-mindedness. But sadly
enough, the impression I have
formed of the Stanford student
body is one of an intellectual
community permeated by a fear
of debate.
This fear is roughly akin to the
feeling of anxiety that deters
residents of crime-infested cities
from walking the streets at night,
only in this case one dreads not
the mugger or the thief, but the
ever increasing incidence of
aggravating "argumentative"
assault.
Hidden in the bowels of the
assertion "I don't like political
discussions" lies the true root of
the problem, which, when
unearthed in moments of dissent
reveals itself in the phrase: "I
don't want to argue about it."
'Rational Dialogue'
The fear of becoming
inextricably entangled in an
argument used to be a malady
that was generally confined to the
freshman class where arguments
have traditionally been viewed as
impediments to that all-important
goal of social acceptance. But now
the disease seems to have spread,
and students of all four classes
have fallen prey to the bug.
Stanford has done an excellent
job of bastardizing the phrase
"rational dialogue." It isn't
because people here don't like to
talk, and it isn't because dissident
points of view are openly
suppressed, it's because the
argumentative situation, where

two people with differing
opinions confront each other, is
consistently avoided by the
overwhelming majority of
Stanford students.
You can't have % a very
meaningful "rational dialogue"
when your dialogue participants
are fundamentally of the same
mind. The Kennedy-McCarthy
"debate" of 1968 was a classic
example of this.
Identical Viewpoints
One can see this fear of debate
quite readily in examining the
audiences at evening lectures by
off-campus speakers. The
observant lecture-goer is
immediately struck by the relative
homogeneity of the audience.
Josh McDowell addressed a crowd
which was predominately
Christian, Ramsey Clark's
audience was composed mostly of
students with a left-wing
viewpoint, and should Huey
Newton speak on campus
tomorrow night, I would
unhesitatingly predict that his
audience would be largely black.
In short, whenever anyone
speaks on this campus, the speaker
can be fairly sure that his
audience, be it large or small, will
be favorably receptive to his or
her point of view (unless the
speaker is William Shockley).
Thus the "open mike" that has
been waved about so libertarianly
at innumerable White Plaza rallies
(perhaps I should say Quang Tri
Plaza), has ceased to be a symbol
of open-mindedness, for an open
mike is worthless if the audience
is merely a collection of nearly
identical viewpoints.
The overabundance of standing
ovations on this campus should

clearly indicate how Stanford,
which certainly contains people of
widely varying political and social
inclinations, has successfully
managed to divide itself up into
little isolated organs that live each
in their own buffered
environments, where their
component cells are free to
periodically assemble at "debates"
and lectures for the purpose of
indulging in self-congratulatory,
righteous applause.
Attending a special lecture has
become a social event that closely
parallels the high society cocktail
party. When I am asked, "Did you
hear Ellsberg last week?", I
perceive plainly that the brunt of
the question is directed at
determining whether or not I was
there, and not whether or not I
did any thinking about what was
said. Should my answer be "No, I
was not there," then my
questioner feels justified in
assuming a slightly condescending
tone of speech when he informs
me that he was there, (even if he
didn't listen to a word that was
said).
This en masse retreat from the
world of debate is to me a
distressing phenomenon. While I
certainly think that enthusiasm,
„w!f-confidence in the
righteousness of one's cause, and a
zealous dedication to your own
point of view are healthy things, I
also think that you must
constantly be critical of your own
position. And strangely enough,
that occasionally requires talking
and listening (especially the latter)
to people with whom you
disagree.

the problem, which, when
unearthed in moments of dissent
reveals itself in the phrase: "I
don't want to argue about it."
'Rational Dialogue'
The fear of becoming
inextricably entangled in an
argument used to be a malady
that was generally confined to the
freshman class where arguments
have traditionally been viewed as
impediments to that all-important
goal of social acceptance. But now
the disease seems to have spread,
and students of all four classes
have fallen prey to the bug.
Stanford has done an excellent
job of bastardizing the phrase
"rational dialogue." It isn't
because people here don't like to
talk, and it isn't because dissident
points of view are openly
suppressed, it's because the
argumentative situation, where

two people with differing
opinions confront each other, is
consistently avoided by the
overwhelming majority of
Stanford students.
You can't have % a very
meaningful "rational dialogue"
when your dialogue participants
are fundamentally of the same
mind. The Kennedy-McCarthy
"debate" of 1968 was a classic
example of this.
Identical Viewpoints
One can see this fear of debate
quite readily in examining the
audiences at evening lectures by
off-campus speakers. The
observant lecture-goer is
immediately struck by the relative
homogeneity of the audience.
Josh McDowell addressed a crowd
which was predominately
Christian, Ramsey Clark's
audience was composed mostly of
students with a left-wing
viewpoint, and should Huey
Newton speak on campus
tomorrow night, I would
unhesitatingly predict that his
audience would be largely black.
In short, whenever anyone
speaks on this campus, the speaker
can be fairly sure that his
audience, be it large or small, will
be favorably receptive to his or
her point of view (unless the
speaker is William Shockley).
Thus the "open mike" that has
been waved about so libertarianly
at innumerable White Plaza rallies
(perhaps I should say Quang Tri
Plaza), has ceased to be a symbol
of open-mindedness, for an open
mike is worthless if the audience
is merely a collection of nearly
identical viewpoints.
The overabundance of standing
ovations on this campus should

clearly indicate how Stanford,
which certainly contains people of
widely varying political and social
inclinations, has successfully
managed to divide itself up into
little isolated organs that live each
in their own buffered
environments, where their
component cells are free to
periodically assemble at "debates"
and lectures for the purpose of
indulging in self-congratulatory,
righteous applause.
Attending a special lecture has
become a social event that closely
parallels the high society cocktail
party. When I am asked, "Did you
hear Ellsberg last week?", I
perceive plainly that the brunt of
the question is directed at
determining whether or not I was
there, and not whether or not I
did any thinking about what was
said. Should my answer be "No, I
was not there," then my
questioner feels justified in
assuming a slightly condescending
tone of speech when he informs
me that he was there, (even if he
didn't listen to a word that was
said).
This en masse retreat from the
world of debate is to me a
distressing phenomenon. While I
certainly think that enthusiasm,
„w!f-confidence in the
righteousness of one's cause, and a
zealous dedication to your own
point of view are healthy things, I
also think that you must
constantly be critical of your own
position. And strangely enough,
that occasionally requires talking
and listening (especially the latter)
to people with whom you
disagree.

One would think that Stanford
University, as an academic
community theoretically
dedicated to the pursuit of
knowledge and truth, would be
strongly committed to the ideal of
open-mindedness. But sadly
enough, the impression I have
formed of the Stanford student
body is one of an intellectual
community permeated by a fear
of debate.
This fear is roughly akin to the
feeling of anxiety that deters
residents of crime-infested cities
from walking the streets at night,
only in this case one dreads not
the mugger or the thief, but the
ever increasing incidence of
aggravating "argumentative"
assault.
Hidden in the bowels of the
assertion "I don't like political
discussions" lies the true root of
the problem, which, when
