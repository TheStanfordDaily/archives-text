# Meaty Confrontation
## Big Boycott Backfires 
### 
Doyle McManus

Now that the Great Meat
Boycott is nearly over, all devout
consumerists can stop gritting
their teeth, look forward to
celebrating victory with a big,
expensive steak—and take a look
at what's been accomplished.
Not much. As a matter of fact,
the whole thing looks sadly like
an exercise in misdirected
energies, if viewed outside the
heady air of mass 'revolt.'
Very little has been accomplished,
very little has been learned.
Certainly little has been
accomplished in the way of
forcing meat prices down. The
boycott did, it is true, pressure
the Administration into declaring
a freeze on meat prices—but at the
same level that was sufficiently
intolerable to provoke the
boycott. In the absence of a
rollback—unlikely in view of the
President's economic philosophy
and his affection for the farm
vote—the freeze is an empty
achievement.
By week's end, meat sales had
dropped by around 15 percent in
some areas. But prices hardly fell
as fast. And, next week, when
thousands of meat-starved
shoppers flood back to their
butchers, prices may well return
to their pre-boycott levels.
Furthermore, many economists
predict no alleviation of the food
price situation before July;
current price levels will persist
unless consumers mount a
permanent boycott and renounce
viands entirely—in which case
everyone could merely eat soy
paste. Actually, as meat is a
notoriously inefficient product to

produce, that might not be a bad
idea.
Blame Evaded
But what has really happened
is that the Nixon Administration
has successfully evaded blame for
the effects of its own inflationist
policies, and pinned the rap on
the ready scapegoat of the meat
industry. This when the meat
industry has one of the smallest
profit margins, from start to
finish, in America; this when the
basic agricultural policy of the
Nixon Administration for the past
two years was to increase farm
subsidies—and decrease food
supplies.
The boycott never began to
address these problems. Instead,
its major underlying premise was
that there was some evil
entity—profiteering farmers,
money-grubbing middlemen,
avaricious grocers—that could be
bludgeoned into lowering meat
prices by the sheer weight of
consumer indignation.
Would that all economic
problems were that sin.ple. But
the fact is that food is one of the
few sectors in this economy that
still operates on any visible
semblance of a supply-and
demand model. Profits are
minimal: the average supermarket
earns less than one percnet on its
sales. Meat-packing firms,
surprisingly enough make little
more.
Farmers Benefit
Only farmers can claim to have
gained any real benefit from the
food price spiral. But they are not
so much to blame as are a number
of other factors: the corn blight

that reduced the supply of feed
for livestock, the sale of grain to
the Soviet Union, rising demand
for meat because of a pickup in
the economy's other sectors—and
the inflationary policies of the
Nixon Administration.
"You won't get me to
apologize for high meat prices,"
Agriculture Secretary Earl Butz
said last year. "I'm spending
money like a drunken sailor."
The money came in the form
of subsidies and funds under the
famed "set-aside" program that
pays farmers —mainly big
farmers—not to grow crops: $4.1
billion, up 25 percent from the
1971 figure. It was an open, and
successful, bid for the farm vote.
Still, it was little more than an
intensification of previous farm
policies, all of which were
designed to support agricultural
prices in the face of potential
food surpluses. With the paucity
of foresight at the White House,
there was no way that policy
could be reversed quickly enough
to satisfy the consumer.
Eat Cheese
Thus when the first rumblings
about meat prices rose from the
supermarket aisles, all Treasury
Secretary Burns could do was to
suggest that Americans eat fish,
eat cheese, or just eat less meat.
The statement was reminiscent of
an earlier autocratic age, and the
popular response was much the
same.
Ironically, however, the
'strategy' of the boycotters has
been just what Secretary Burns
suggested: to eat less meat. The
Republicans prescribed eating less;
an angry populace responded by
eating less. And instead of
repudiating the boycott, President
Nixon has obliquely applauded
it—at once deflecting blame and
promoting the Republican
philosophy that the remedy for
high prices is less consumption.
Moreover, the White House was
reportedly advised just before the
boycott that wholesale meat
prices were due for a slight
dip—and that by declaring a
'freeze' and supporting the
boycott the Administration could
manage to pick up some of the
credit.
So what might have been a
significant consumer backlash
against price inflation has been
turned to the small advantage of
the Administration that
contributed much to those same
price levels. It is clearly in the
interest of the Administration to
ensure that the meat boycott is
limited to an attack on the
nefarious meat industry—and not
on the economic policies of the
current resident of the White
House.
In large part, the
Administration has succeeded. It's
too bad.
