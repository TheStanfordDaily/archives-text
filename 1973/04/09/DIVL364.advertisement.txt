We can arrange to have a new 1973 Fiat, or any other European car waiting for you in Europe
at a substantial savings. Let us show you how our complete package plan can save you money. All
arrangements are made at the lowest cost before you leave; including the best auto insurance, the
safest return shipping, and free S.E.A. services upon arrival of your car stateside. You also get a
free S.E.A. travel kit which includes a Road Atlas, maps, and the British Royal Auto Club guide to
the continent. Arrangements for financing can also be made.
