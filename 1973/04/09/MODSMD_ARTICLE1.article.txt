# Ma Bell Begins Crackdown On Phone Phreaks
## 
### LARRY HUMMER 
Phone phreaks have been having a
field day in the past few years, but
now Ma Bell is bringing up the heavy
armor in the continuing Great
Telephone War.
"Ripping off Ma Bell" has been
ridiculously easy in the past, and
thousands of people, particularly those
with a yen for electronics, have gotten
into the act. With their knowledge and
illicit equipment, they have been able
to make free telephone calls to
anywhere in the world.
The favorite phone phreak device is
called the "blue box," or "MFer" —
for multifrequency tone signals. It is a
relatively small device that imitates the
switching language used by the
telephone system. Switching is
controlled by different caliope tones,
similar to the tones generated by a
touch-tone telephone, but of different
frequencies.
Phone phreaks generally initiate
their calls by calling one of the
toll-free area code 800 numbers, and
then use their blue boxes to send their

own signals, to the switching
equipment. By knowing the signal
codes for the various trunk lines,
phone phreaks can make free calls to
any country in the world.
All that is recorded on the
telephone records is a rather long call
to an 800 commercial number.
Phreaks avoid having the phone
company's suspicions aroused by using
pay phones, rather than their own
home phones.
« Major Center
Santa Clara County is a major
center of phone phreaking, because of
all the electronics industry in the area.
Despite this, the Daily was hard
pressed to get in touch with any
phreaks here at Stanford. It is well
known that the notorious Captain
Crunch was brought to justice largely
through clues that appeared in an
Esquire magazine article about him in
1971.
Captain Crunch was one of the all
time great phreaks. It was he who
discovered that a whistle that came in
cereal boxes precisely duplicated the

all-important "2600" tone, the
frequency that allows phone phreaks to
"seize a tandem," and thus talk to
Paris or Karachi.
One of his great feats was to send
his voice around the world several
times to the phone booth right next to
him. Thus, he was able to carry on
conversations with himself. You have
to be a little weird to be a hard-core
phone phreak.
"Phred" (not his real name) is a
Stanford phreak. His friends call him
Phone Phreak Phred. Although he does
not use a blue box, he is an avid
student of the telephone system and
this makes him representative of the
phone phreak psychology.
No Hatred
Although Phred has made some toll
free calls the phone company does not
know about, he does not hate the
telephone company and he is not
about to do it in. On the contrary, he
has often called the company to report
trouble on its lines.
"The phone system," says Phred,
"is an extremely complex system, and

finding out what makes it tick
fascinates me. That's what motivates
all phone phreaks. I find the phone
company to be quite a marvelously
technical thing. I may even work for
her some day.
Her. Ma Bell can be a very real
personal thing.
"It varies. Some really hate her;
some like her." Phred says.
Joe Engressia, a blind phone phreak
from Florida, desperately tried to get a
job with the phone company. It was
all he cared about. His arrest for phone
phreaking brought him to the
attention of the phone company, so he
now works in Tennessee as a $2 per
hour trouble shooter.
A lot of phone phreaks are blind. A
blind person can explore this area as
well as a sighted person, better even,
because blind people generally have
better developed hearing.
Phred says he was at the "tender
age" of ten when he discovered the
telephone system. "I found that if I
pushed the hook button once it was
the same as if I dialed one. I soon

discovered that I could dial numbers
by pushing on the switch hook."
Magazine Articles
A few years later, he met a blind
guy who told him a lot about phones.
When he was in junior college, Phred
started amassing magazine articles on
the subject.
Even without doing anything
illegal, the phone system in Palo Alto
provides endless fascination for Phred.
He knows the numbers for all the
special lines used by switchmen, and
he has discovered various telephones

although they are not supposed to.

themselves by playing around with
their own private telephone system,

The phone company has been
increasingly worried about fraud, and
is growing ever more sophisticated in
catching it. Various devices have been

developed to detect and monitor
illegal calls, without actually listening
to the conversations (which is illegal).
The new "mf majority detector" can
spot signals coming from blue boxes,
because such signals are generally of
poor quality. To top it off, the FBI
has been known to tap the phones of
suspected phreaks.
Bookmakers are a particular worry
at the present time; reportedly blue
boxes have been used to set up
gambling rings. The company has
always been less concerned about
those who regard the system as a giant
technological toy than about those
who are basically out to defraud the
system.

"Ripping off Ma Bell" has been
ridiculously easy in the past, and
thousands of people, particularly those
with a yen for electronics, have gotten
into the act. With their knowledge and
illicit equipment, they have been able
to make free telephone calls to
anywhere in the world.
The favorite phone phreak device is
called the "blue box," or "MFer" —
for multifrequency tone signals. It is a
relatively small device that imitates the
switching language used by the
telephone system. Switching is
controlled by different caliope tones,
similar to the tones generated by a
touch-tone telephone, but of different
frequencies.
Phone phreaks generally initiate
their calls by calling one of the
toll-free area code 800 numbers, and
then use their blue boxes to send their

own signals, to the switching
equipment. By knowing the signal
codes for the various trunk lines,
phone phreaks can make free calls to
any country in the world.
All that is recorded on the
telephone records is a rather long call
to an 800 commercial number.
Phreaks avoid having the phone

pressed to get in touch with any
phreaks here at Stanford. It is well
known that the notorious Captain
Crunch was brought to justice largely
through clues that appeared in an
Esquire magazine article about him in
1971.
Captain Crunch was one of the all
time great phreaks. It was he who
discovered that a whistle that came in
cereal boxes precisely duplicated the

all-important "2600" tone, the
frequency that allows phone phreaks to
"seize a tandem," and thus talk to
Paris or Karachi.
One of his great feats was to send
his voice around the world several
times to the phone booth right next to
him. Thus, he was able to carry on
conversations with himself. You have

their calls by calling one of the
toll-free area code 800 numbers, and
then use their blue boxes to send their

own signals, to the switching
equipment. By knowing the signal
codes for the various trunk lines,
phone phreaks can make free calls to
any country in the world.
All that is recorded on the
telephone records is a rather long call
to an 800 commercial number.
Phreaks avoid having the phone
company's suspicions aroused by using
pay phones, rather than their own
home phones.

Santa Clara County is a major
center of phone phreaking, because of
all the electronics industry in the area.
Despite this, the Daily was hard
pressed to get in touch with any
phreaks here at Stanford. It is well
known that the notorious Captain
Crunch was brought to justice largely
through clues that appeared in an
Esquire magazine article about him in
1971.
Captain Crunch was one of the all
time great phreaks. It was he who
discovered that a whistle that came in
cereal boxes precisely duplicated the

all-important "2600" tone, the
frequency that allows phone phreaks to
"seize a tandem," and thus talk to
Paris or Karachi.
One of his great feats was to send
his voice around the world several
times to the phone booth right next to
him. Thus, he was able to carry on
conversations with himself. You have
to be a little weird to be a hard-core
phone phreak.
"Phred" (not his real name) is a
Stanford phreak. His friends call him
Phone Phreak Phred. Although he does
not use a blue box, he is an avid
student of the telephone system and
this makes him representative of the
phone phreak psychology.
No Hatred
Although Phred has made some toll
free calls the phone company does not
know about, he does not hate the
telephone company and he is not
about to do it in. On the contrary, he
has often called the company to report
trouble on its lines.
"The phone system," says Phred,
"is an extremely complex system, and

finding out what makes it tick
fascinates me. That's what motivates
all phone phreaks. I find the phone
company to be quite a marvelously
technical thing. I may even work for
her some day.
Her. Ma Bell can be a very real
personal thing.
"It varies. Some really hate her;
some like her." Phred says.
Joe Engressia, a blind phone phreak
from Florida, desperately tried to get a
job with the phone company. It was
all he cared about. His arrest for phone
phreaking brought him to the
attention of the phone company, so he
now works in Tennessee as a $2 per
hour trouble shooter.
A lot of phone phreaks are blind. A
blind person can explore this area as
well as a sighted person, better even,
because blind people generally have
better developed hearing.
Phred says he was at the "tender
age" of ten when he discovered the
telephone system. "I found that if I
pushed the hook button once it was
the same as if I dialed one. I soon

discovered that I could dial numbers
by pushing on the switch hook."

A few years later, he met a blind
guy who told him a lot about phones.
When he was in junior college, Phred
started amassing magazine articles on
the subject.
Even without doing anything
illegal, the phone system in Palo Alto
provides endless fascination for Phred.

developed to detect and monitor

spot signals coming from blue boxes,
because such signals are generally of
poor quality. To top it off, the FBI
has been known to tap the phones of
suspected phreaks.
Bookmakers are a particular worry
at the present time; reportedly blue
boxes have been used to set up
gambling rings. The company has
always been less concerned about
those who regard the system as a giant
technological toy than about those
who are basically out to defraud the
system.
Phone phreaks have been having a

"Ripping off Ma Bell" has been
ridiculously easy in the past, and
thousands of people, particularly those
with a yen for electronics, have gotten
into the act. With their knowledge and
illicit equipment, they have been able
to make free telephone calls to
anywhere in the world.
The favorite phone phreak device is
called the "blue box," or "MFer" —
for multifrequency tone signals. It is a
relatively small device that imitates the
switching language used by the
telephone system. Switching is
controlled by different caliope tones,
similar to the tones generated by a
touch-tone telephone, but of different
frequencies.
