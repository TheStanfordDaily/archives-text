# Coors & The Colonel
## Local Culture

— Hey Bob, this sure had been
a rough week of school. I tell you
what, let's go into the city and get
away from this ratrace. OK?
— You know John, that sure
sounds good to me. Besides, this
dorm food is getting me down. We
could go in and mess around for
awhile, grab a good dinner, and
have a wild night on the town.
Someone said the new Grateful
Dead album was in at the record
store. We should go in and have a
listen.
— Yeah, then we could go over
to the Alpha Beta market and get
a case of Coors beer to get
mellowed out. Boy, its been
awhile since I've had that stuff.
What about dinner, though?
— I've got it! We'll hop on into
the Kentucky Fried Chicken Joint
and get ourselves a barrel of the
Colonel's best. Extra crispy, of
course! What could go better with
beetf
— And then after that, Bob,
what we could do is go down to
the Bijou and see "Deep Throat."
I haven't seen a good skin flick in
a long time, and I hear that's
supposed to be one of the finest.
— Right on man, I'm really
psyched for it, you know! We
might even be able to cruise the

main drag awhile and see if we can
pick up on a couple of high school
chicks for the rest of the evening.
— That would be great, Bob!
You know what we could do? We
could take them up to the Top of
the Mark and have a couple of
rounds of Harvey Wallbangers.
What a great experience that
would be!
— God, what a great time this
is gonna be! Well cut the gabbing
about it and go! You know, it's
times like this that make me glad
that they moved the German
campus to Bonn. I mean, look at
all the things the big city has to
offer that you could never get in
that dinky little place
called ... er .. . what was that
place?
— Beatles Back, I think, Bob.
— Yeah, that's it. You know if
we could only get Johnny Carson
on TV here I'd feel right at home.
Oh well, I guess you can't have
everything.
— Let's cut the talk man, I'm
getting hungry. Kentucky Fried
Chicken here we come. Hey,
maybe we could even hit Baskin
and Robbins . ..

store. We should go in and have a
listen.
— Yeah, then we could go over
to the Alpha Beta market and get
a case of Coors beer to get
mellowed out. Boy, its been
awhile since I've had that stuff.
What about dinner, though?
— I've got it! We'll hop on into
the Kentucky Fried Chicken Joint
and get ourselves a barrel of the
Colonel's best. Extra crispy, of
course! What could go better with
beetf
— And then after that, Bob,
what we could do is go down to
the Bijou and see "Deep Throat."
I haven't seen a good skin flick in
a long time, and I hear that's
supposed to be one of the finest.
— Right on man, I'm really
psyched for it, you know! We
might even be able to cruise the

main drag awhile and see if we can
pick up on a couple of high school
chicks for the rest of the evening.
— That would be great, Bob!
You know what we could do? We
could take them up to the Top of
the Mark and have a couple of
rounds of Harvey Wallbangers.
What a great experience that
would be!
— God, what a great time this
is gonna be! Well cut the gabbing
about it and go! You know, it's
times like this that make me glad
that they moved the German
campus to Bonn. I mean, look at
all the things the big city has to
offer that you could never get in
that dinky little place
called ... er .. . what was that
place?
— Beatles Back, I think, Bob.
— Yeah, that's it. You know if
we could only get Johnny Carson
on TV here I'd feel right at home.
Oh well, I guess you can't have
everything.
— Let's cut the talk man, I'm
getting hungry. Kentucky Fried
Chicken here we come. Hey,
maybe we could even hit Baskin
and Robbins . ..

— Hey Bob, this sure had been
a rough week of school. I tell you
what, let's go into the city and get
away from this ratrace. OK?
— You know John, that sure
sounds good to me. Besides, this
dorm food is getting me down. We
could go in and mess around for
awhile, grab a good dinner, and
have a wild night on the town.
Someone said the new Grateful
Dead album was in at the record
store. We should go in and have a
listen.
