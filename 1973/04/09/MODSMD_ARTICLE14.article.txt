# "Keep Left!" "Keep Right"
## 
### 
There is an adage in journalism that if a paper manages to
encourage the wrath of both the political left and right, then
it must be doing something right. The Daily receives its share
of criticism from nearly every frequency of the political
spectrum, but we're not so sure this means we're doing the
right job.
Left, right, or middle of the road — the Daily needs input
from all kinds of people. We welcome everyone with an
interest in writing, reporting, advertising, or photography to
join our staff. It's easy to join the Daily; experience is not a
prerequisite. In fact if you're not experienced in newspaper
work, we think you'll find a good training ground at the
Daily.
Like many institutions, the Daily staff — from reporters
to editors to business staffers — lacks adequate
representation from many campus minorities including
black, Chicano, Asian, women, and graduate students. In
short, we think our staff should reflect the community we
serve, and that means everyone is welcome.
The time you invest at the Daily will pay off in
experience, opportunities to meet a variety of people, a
better understanding of what goes on in and around the
University community, and a little money. And we think
being a part of the Daily staff can also be a lot of fun.
So don't be "left" out — come "right" over to our
orientation meeting at 3 p.m. Tuesday at the Daily office on
Lomita Drive right across the road from the Campus Bike
Shop.
