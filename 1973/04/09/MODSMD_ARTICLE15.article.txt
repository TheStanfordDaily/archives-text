# Harvey Hall gives Winter Quarter report of University Ombudsman
## 
### 
Introductory Comments
This second Quarterly Report has the same two pur
poses as the first: •
1. To give the University some idea of the kinds of
situations, problems, complaints, inquiries, and sugges
tions that are brought to the Office of the Ombudsman.
There are not many suggestions or proposals. These
go to the appropriate administrative officers or members
of the faculty as they should.
Mainly we have complaints and inquiries. The com
plaints, if accepted as appropriate for the office, a.e all
handled by the Ombudsman. The inquiries are handled
either by the Ombudsman or by the secretary-assistant.
A continuing question, still very hard to answer, is
this: At what stage in a situation should a member of the
community involve the Ombudsman? Fairly early as the
matter develops? Or as a sort of court of last resort?
Generally the normal avenues of appeal in the aca
demic and administrative structure should be utilized
first. However, there are occasions (at least two) in
which the Ombudsman feels that he could have affected
the situation if he had been involved earlier. When he
was involved, it was too late to do anything.
On some occasions (we cannot define very well what
these are) it may be that the Ombudsman should be
involved earlier, and then he can decide whether to
handle the matter by a referral or whether to participate
then and there.
2. The other purpose of this report is to remind
members of the community that the office exists to
assist them in the resolution of their intra-University
problems-sometimes by referral, sometines by direct
negotiation. If you think a fairly knowledgable (about
the workings of the University) and objective person can
help you, come to the office or telephone us.
The Office of the Ombudsman is located at 125
Memorial Court which is between the Inner Quad and
the Outer Quad on the front of the University (toward
Palo Alto). The telephone extension is 3682. The office
is staffed by a full-time secretary-assistant and the
Ombudsman.
The secretary-assistant is in the office from 8 a.m. to
12 noon, and from 1 to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday.
The Ombudsman is there Monday, Tuesday, and Thurs
day from 8 a.m. to 12 noon, and from 1 to 5 p.m., and
on Wednesday and Friday by appointment.
In case you lose track of this, the Ombudsman is
listed on page 24 of the spring quarter Time Schedule
with administrative officers (which he is not, but this
seemed the handiest place to list the office). A brief
description of the role and function of the Ombudsman
is noted on pages 16 and 17 in the 1973 Stanford
Information Bulletin.
The Fall Report carried a section on the Background
of the Office but hopefully this need not be repeated
here. In that Report there was also a section entitled
Some Preliminary' Observations. There is nothing else
preliminary to observe at this point. What remains will
be concluding observations and these will appear in the
Annual Report following spring quarter.
Statistics
Comparisons with previous years will not be at
tempted here, but comparisons between fall and winter
quarters are shown in the accompanying table.
The phrase so often used to describe higher education
generally, and Stanford particularly, can be applied to
the Office of the Ombudsman: "dynamic steady state."
At least in number of cases, the fall and winter quarters
were surprisingly similar.
The same arbitrariness of classification applies to this
report as to the earlier report. Subjective decisions are
made by the Ombudsman when a case could fit either of
two categories.
For example-when a $50 deposit is not returned, is
that a housing problem or a financial problem? Is a
hassle over the amount of a refund when a student
applies for and receives a leave of absence academic or
financial? And so on. The statistical table follows.
Vignettes (Sample cases)
This section of the Report is intended to give the
campus community a little better idea of what is behind
the statistics quoted in the previous section of this
second quarterly report.
Of course the cases are disguised to protect the
anonymity of the individuals involved. In some the situa
tions may be altered a little from reality to prevent
identification, and the name of the department may be
fictional.
As before, these vignettes are largely based on notes
on conversations, although in some instances quotations
from letters or written statements may be used. In order
to make communication as easy as possible, written
statements are not necessarily required from com
plainants or inquirers.
No. 121. Absentee Ballots. Last quarter I reported on
a case in which a student objected to paying a fee for
having her absentee ballot notarized. At the time of the
fall quarter report the matter had been inconclusively
explored with University officials and with the County
Registrar of Voters. A legal counsel in the Office of
. Business and Finance wrote to the Office of Secretary of
State concerning the matter.
A reply has now been received from an Associate
Counsel in the Office of California Secretary of State.
The essence of his reply is embodied in this quotation
from his letter: "By its own terms Section 14632 applies
the no-fee restriction to California elections. It is only
by analogy that the no-fee provision could by applied to
absentee voting under the laws of another state. The
matter is not clear cut and the interpretation thereof
should be left to the usual processes of law such as by a
suit in the Small Claims Court for a refund of the fee.
This office could not take action against a notary public
based on a vague statutory interpretation."
The matter is now in the hands of the Dean of
Student Affairs.
No. 208. Parking. Ms. M parked her car one time only
for maximum of 36 hours in a space adjacent to a
residence hall in a parking area marked for parking.
People can park any place in the area currently because
not all are marked yet with apartment numbers.

In the space she used there is a manhole cover which
gave forth steam after she parked. When she tried to
start her car, it refused. Finally it was towed to a local
garage. The garage said the whole engine was wet and
they had to dry it out. She is driving it home this
weekend and will get another estimate. The ga« , e said,
although it now runs, it will not run for long and it is
misfiring currently, obviously not running properly.
Ms. M thinks it is unfair that she is burdened with this
repair work when she parked in a space marked for
parking and was unaware of steam vent performances. If
she does have to pay the damage, can the University at
least arrange to eliminate this space and make it impossi
ble for other motorists to have this same problem.
Follow-up: Talked to appropriate member of staff in
Office of Business and Finance. He got in touch with Ms.
M concerning the matter.
Ms. M was reimbursed and white posts were erected
to prevent future parking in the position over the steam
vent.
No. 140. Examination Conflict. Mr. C has an exami
nation conflict. He has one class which meets Monday,
Wednesday, and Friday at 2 and another class which
meets Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday at 2. Final
examinations for both, according to the schedule, are
given at the same time. Both instructors prefer not to
give an alternate examination. Student just wants the
conflict to be resolved in some way.
Follow-up: I called the Registrar's Office and told the
appropriate member of the staff there that although part
of the problem was of the student's own making for
scheduling classes which have meeting times on the same
day, still, one of the classes should not have been sched
uled on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday according to
regulations of the Scheduling Committee.
I referred the student to the Assistant Registrar first;
second, if the Registrar's Office could not work out his
problem, I suggested that he petition the Committee on
Academic Standing, Petitions and Exceptions.
The Assistant Registrar was able to assist him in
working out his problem.
No. 235. Delinquency Fee. Mr. A is an undergraduate
and an R.A. (Research Assistant). At advance registra
tion time during fall quarter he had a number of tuition
credits. He applied those toward,his bill and deferred the
rest. At registration time he took out an additional
deferment. Then, a week or so after registration he went
in to pay his bill. The clerk there apnarently :• sread 602
for 607 so that he underpaid by $5. At the same time he
paid a $5 ..rvice charge which was legitimate.
Now he receives a bill for the extra $5 which he
acknowledges he should pay and which he has now paid.
He also was charged a $10 delinquency fee which he
thinks is not deserved.
Follow-up: I saw the Director of Student Accounts
and discussed the situation with him. He has a procedure
for reviewing matters of this kind and asked that I refer
the student to him, which I did. The delinquency fee
was remitted.
(I mention this case here because it is typical of a
great many situations which arise, many from the fact
that some ASSU fees are refundable and others are not.
Since some scholarships and fellowships will pay re
quired fees but not others we get into a very complex
situation in which the nonrefundable fees could pre
sumably be paid by the fellowship but not the refunda
ble fees, it must take Solomon and several extra clerks
to keep track of the matter.)
No. 141. Earthquakes. (Included here as an example
of a matter which is purely a request for information.)
Mr. P came to the office with this inquiry: What is
the University doing to study or further earthquake
proof buildings of the University? He will check back
later this week.
Follow-up: Called the Director of Planning who was
away from the office. In his absence, I talked to Mr. K
of the Planning Office staff. He seems to be something
of an expert in earthquake-proofing. He told me there is
a continuing program to bring all Stanford buildings "up
to code." Of course the code changed progressively, not
all at once, so he couldn't just say buildings constructed
or remodeled after such and such a date are up to code.
He did give me a specific rundown.

The details need not be repeated here, but all recent
structures and recently remodeled structures are con
sidered safe. Additionally, the arcades around Memorial
Court wore taken down in the early Fifties and re
constructed with reenforcement.
Reported the above to Mr. P and said if he wanted
further ir.'ormation he should see Mr. K in the Planning
Office.
No. 135. Liquor Laws. Mr. R thinks that the liquor
laws as they now stand are discriminatory. He has
neither car nor bicycle and he'd like to get wine, particu
larly, once in a while. To do so is a major project by bus,
either to Beltramos in Menlo Park or down the highway
south quite a ways on El Camino Real. He would appre
ciate having the matter looked into.
Is this a matter of state law or regulation? Is it some
agency's interpretation, or is it simply not fea.-'ble for
places like the J J and F and the Coop on California
Avenue, which are the closest places for Mr. R to shop,
to bother to get a license.
/ Follow-up: I talked to Mr. Z, a lawyer on the Univer
sity staff, about the problem that adults who live on
campus have when they want to purchase a bottle of
wine or other liquor. It seems I went to the right person
because Mr. Z is preparing himself to be the University's
liquor law expert and was in the process of researching
relevant regulations and laws.
The whole situation has been made very murky by an
intermingling of a section of the Founding Grant plus
clauses in the original Hopkins deeds of sale for a great
deal of Palo Alto property, plus the State Penal Code.
But it seems that the central problem here is the State
law—the mile and a half restriction for sale of liquor for
off-premises consumption.
I wrote to Mr. R reporting what I had learned and
advising him that he was confronted with a matter which
would require a change in the law.
No. 211. Library Delinquency Penalty. Mr. A is a
graduate student in the Graduate School of Business. Mr. •
A objects to what he regards as an excessive fine for a
book which he kept out. He says it can be purchased for
$3 in the Bookstore; his fine was $25 plus a $10 late
payment fee, so that he is asked now to pay something
which is almost 1 2 times the value of the book.
He checked it out at the end of a school day on a
Thursday, kept it and then did not return on Friday due
to a series of circumstances which caused him to forget
about it. On the following Monday morning there was a
note in his box telling that the book was overdue. At
that point he went right home, got the book and re
turned it, and was told about the $25 fine.
Follow-up: I called Mr. X in the Main Library to ask
him if the Main Library had jurisdiction in this matter;
he said it did not. Then called an Assistant Dean in the
professional school. He said the matter was no longer in
his jurisdiction. I ascertained the person in that school to
whom an appeal from the librarian's decision should be
addressed and made an appointment for Mr. A to see
that person. Comment: The fine does seem excessive.
Why is it not possible to have a uniform scale of fees for
all the University libraries?
No. 192. Room Rent. Mr. W roomed in an independ
ent house last spring. He started out as a single; a
roommate came in and they split the rent of the room.
He started out as a single this fall quarter ('72-73) and
then split the rent. At the end of the quarter the bill was
paid. The total rent was $210. This breaks down $155
for room and $55 for the social dues or fee. He paid all
the $55 and half of the $155, and his roommate paid a
prorated portion of the other half, approximately of the
$155.
Mr. W was informed by the president of the house
that he owed full room rent. Now the authorities in the
house are threatening to hold up spring quarter registra
tion of Mr. W for nonpayment of part of his room rent.
He of course wants to get the matter clarified. I told Mr.
W I'd arrange for the HOLD to be removed until the
matter was adjudicated. I asked Mr. W to get in touch
with me again at the first of the week. In the meantime I
intend to talk to the Director of Housing.

th/m t°t W ' UP '.. , tG the Director of Housing and
matter still needed to be investigated but I received
assurances that Mr. W's registration would not be held
Negotiations went on inconclusively. Mr. W came in
the office and I told him that Mr. X, of the Housing
Olfice stalf, was investigating the matter. I then said
At least I got your registration hold cleared up until the
matter is adjudicated." With that Mr. W, neither smiling
l o j 4! "Ber, pulled out his PTR and handed it to me. It
HOLD stamped all over it. I must record this as
one ol the most embarrassing moments in my short
tenure as Ombudsman.
I then found that the hold had been placed by the
Housing Manager in the Office of Business and Finance
although I had been dealing with the Director of Hous
ing in the Office of Dean of Student Affairs. (Parentheti
ca y, I should say that both are compassionate and
cooperative gentlemen-cooperative with me, with stu
dents, and with each other. The incident does show that
twenty years inside the bureaucracy is no guarantee that
even with the best of goodwill on all sides things will
always go smoothly.)
Mr. N has made an arrangement whereby the matter
will be heard by all members of the house, both Mr W
and the management of the house have agreed to accept
the outcome of this hearing. '
No 178. Faculty Appointment. Professor R came to
Stanford in 1962. The agreement at that time was that
ne would be 60 percent in one department and 40
percent in another. There are a lot of interlocking prob
lems in this, but one of them seems to be that when he
came here he was paid at least partly from "soft"
money.
At any rate, it ended up that department A was
paying all of his salary; although for the first five years
portions of the salary were paid for by the Carnegie
foundation. This was later assumed by department A.
He wants to continue a joint appointment, not just a
courtesy appointment, in department B.
Follow-up: Talked to head of department A about
Professor R. The department head realizes that somehow
they are not communicating too well and he is sorry
about that. There seems to be some disagreement about
what the original terms were.
Had a further conversation with Professor R. I could
not tell him very much except that I had talked with the
department head. It seemed clear they were not having
too good a dialogue going. I told him I thought he
should talk to the department head once more and then
if he thought he did not have satisfaction, he should take
his problem to the Provost's Office since it involved two
schools.
Later Professor R called, said he was very relieved;
the problem was apparently worked out.
No. 256. Pets. Ms. J stopped by the office today and
talked to Jackie Hurd. She wanted to report that she had
picked up a puppy tied to a tree. The puppy had a sign
on it that said "Please give me a home." She took it to
the veterinarian to be checked, and he said it had dis
temper, with a 40 percent chance of recovery. He also
said if other dogs had been exposed to it or it was
prevalent on campus, they could be infected.
She wondered how the Stanford community could be
alerted to the possibility of contagion. Jackie said we
would look into the possibility of letting people known.
Follow-up: The Ombudsman wrote to the Manager of
Health and Safety, saying in part, "A graduate student
was in the office today expressing some concern about
distemper in dogs on campus. How can owners be
alerted to possible infection? I think you are the best
person to judge whether this is or is not worth some
kind of memorandum to members of the University
community, or perhaps a note in the Campus Report or
the Daily."
That office then obtained some information from the
County Health Office concering distemper. That publica
tion says in part, "Distemper has been a scourge of dogs
for centuries. ... As with other viral diseases, once the
infection has attacked an unprotected animal there is no
specific and uniformly effective treatment.
"The moral of the story then is to properly protect
your pet before he is exposed to the disease. The
methods and vaccines available today are so effective
that there is little chance of an animal's contracting
distemper if he is properly immunized by your doctor of
veterinary medicine."
Editorial Section
Bicycles. Bicycles are a great part of the Stanford
scene: good transportation, good sport, good exercise,
better for the ecology than any means of locomotion
except walking. On our soread out campus we need
them. The long winter rains promise a greener spring and
hopefully more bicycles to help keep the air clear and
the smog level down. We will have more bicycles coming
to the campus, going away from the campus, and just
cruising around the campus.
But bicycles do bring a few problems too, and some
of these have generated angry letters to the Ombudsman.
Many others have commented about the matter verbally.
Basically we have three groups on the campus (from the
standpoint of locomotion)-the motorists, the walkers,
and the bicyclists. Of course, individuals shift back and
forth from one group to another all the time. But as
groups they get angry at each other and among them
selves.
Early in the quarjer there was a complaint about the
condition of bicycle trails between here and Palo Alto.
Later there was a specific complaint about the bicycle
crossing parallel to Palm Drive across Arboretum. Autos
proceeding along Palm Drive toward the campus go
whizzing around the corner onto Arboretum and make
things quite hazardous for bicyclists going toward the
campus along Palm Drive crossing Arboretum with the
green light.
Some were more generally critical. Ms. J is very
concerned about the lack of safety lights on bicycles.
She had made her own survey and nine out of ten riders
did not have protective lights. Her secondary concern is
that bicycles drive on the wrong side of the street and do
not observe stop signals.
She often rides a bicycle herself and uses ankle lights,
but her expressed concern is as a motorist. She has
recently had two close calls as a motorist. She talked to
a traffic specialist in the Stanford Police Department and
he told her that enforcement is a County responsibility
and that education is the best way to handle the prob
lem.
Ms. N was more emphatic. She is very angry about
the lack of enforcement concerning bicycles which dis
obey the law and endanger pedestrians and motorists.
She is complaining primarily as a motorist. Specifically:
the intersection between Galvez and Serra is a four-way
stop intersection. As a motorist she stops; the bike riders
whiz on by without stopping. Also on Serra between the
Village and Galvez at ten minutes to eight in the morn
ings, bikes are on both sides of the street and going
through stop signs. Usually she comes earlier to avoid
these hazards.
As a pedestrian the other day she was almost run over
by a bicycle in the area between the Main Library and
Undergraduate Library approaching the back of the
School of Education.
She had complained to the Police Department but
somebody there told her it's a problem resulting from
the fact that enforcement is done by the County and not
by Stanford, so the problem is difficult to solve.
One complainant commented on the fact that she had
attended UC-Davis which had had an enforcement cam
paign which was very successful she thought. If Davis
could do it, why can't Stanford?
The Ombudsman asked Chief Herrington about this
and it turned out that he was Chief of Police at Davis at
the time. It was possible to accomplish some things there
that are much more difficult here-apparently because
jurisdictions, lines of authority, and lines of responsi
bility were clearly drawn at Davis. There are California
Laws and County regulations that bear upon this prob
lem. For example, here are some of the laws.
"Every person riding a bicycle upon a highway has
all the rights and is subject to all the duties of the

driver of an automobile. Some of these are, stopping
at stop signs, granting right of way to automobiles
and pedestrians, stopping before crossing sidewalks,
stopping for stop and go lights.
"Every bicycle operated upon any highway during
darkness shall be equipped with a lamp emitting a
white light visible for a distance of 300 feet in front
of the bicycle and with red reflector on the rear of a
type approved by the department which shall be
visible from a distance of 300 feet to the rear. . . ."
"No person operating a bicycle shall carry any
packages, bundle, or article which prevents the opera
tor from keeping a least one hand on the handle
bars." And from Santa Clara ordinances:
"It shall be unlawful for any person to operate or
use a bicycle propelled wholly or in part by muscular
power within the unincorporated territory of the
County of Santa Clara unless said bicycle is registered
and licensed and equipped as provided herein."
"The license fee to be paid for each bicycle shall
be one dollar for a period of five years, payable in
advance. Bicycle licenses conferred pursuant to this
article are not transferable."
So there is a problem and there are laws and regulations
designed to help deal with it. I mention all this in this
report because there is on this campus a very heavy
[concentration of bicycles, but there are also many
walkers and many motorists.
Hopefully we can be a little thoughtful about each
other in the way in which we get from one place to
another. If we voluntarily stop doing a few intemperate
things like speeding in the Inner Quad between classes,
well and good. If that doesn't work, then the next step
will be to charge some existing group (such as the Panel
on Parking and Traffic) or to establish some ad hoc
group with the responsibility of establishing our own
ground rules for bicycle utilization and to establish along
with that some appropriate enforcement mechanism.
Two Recurring Bureaucratic Problems
I. The Front Desk Problem. Whenever Ombudsmen
get together to discuss their problems (as they do in
something called the "California Ombudsman's Caucus")
they almost always seem to discuss something which
they call the front desk problem.
In my dealings at Stanford I have found secretaries
and receptionists to be particularly helpful, almost uni
formly courteous and cooperative. Indeed, the Regis
trar's Office, for example, could not survive without
reliance on this group.

And yet, even here, at Stanford the front desk prob
lem exists. Whether through wrong instruction or
through too much of the wrong kind of initiative some
members of this group tend to become a little over
protective.
Members of the community, and particularly stu
dents, need direct access to decision makers. When re
pulsed by an unexplained "No," students are likely to
turn to deans, vice presidents, vice provosts, assistants to
the dean, assistants to the president, when all these
people can do, really, is refer students back to the
department, often assisting by making an appointment
with the appropriate person-the person the student
should have seen in the first place.
Even with the best network of little regulations de
signed to help the institution avoid becoming chaotic,
there are always exceptional circumstances, situations
which do not quite fit, matters which seem to fall
between two jurisdictions. These matters are properly
handled by decision makers within departments or by
conferences between two of these people. It is not
demeaning for secretaries and receptionists to refer stu
dents directly to the people who can deal with their
problems.
It is wastetul of the time of students and of upper
echelon administrators who know nothing about the
problem for them to become involved. Ways should be
found to refer students directly to those best suited to
handle their problems and who are authorized to make
exceptions. In the end an exception may not be made
lor reasons of equity or for whatever reason, but only
through this kind of direct referral will administrators
lind out about which of their regulations are not work
ing very well, and at least the student will be heard by
someone who can affect the situation.
11. Response Time. One of the myths prevalent
among administrators is that if you wait long enough a
problem will go away. The timid in their community
may not be heard from again; the more aggressive will
be. I do not believe that this rewarding of aggression is a
very desirable thing.
Waiting for additional facts, evidence, data which will
contribute to making a decision is one thing; shilly
shallying about making a hard decision after all the facts
are in is another. We are all busy, but this is more often
an excuse than a reason for delay. What gets pushed to
the bottom of the pile? The hard question, the difficult
letter, not necessarily the unimportant things.

What I am trying to say here is that response time as
short as possible is of preeminent importance in dealing
with students particularly. Delay often causes anger, and
the anger itself causes new problems of human relations,
and these problems may obscure the original more objec
tive one. There are some matters which are brought to
the Ombudsman that would not be if they were dealt
with more promptly where they eventually must be
settled anyway.
Concluding Remarks
The Ombudsman may not be able to help everybody,
but members of the community should at least know
that the office exists. To this end the Daily has been
very helpful, running an article by the Ombudsman in a
very early issue of the Daily and running from time to
time a little box telling where the office is, what the
phone number is, and what the office hours are.
Articles have also appeared in the Campus Report and
in news articles in the Palo Alto Times and the San Jose
Mercury and the San Jose News. 1 think that most
people should now know that the Office of Ombudsman
does exist at Stanford.
There have been a few external activities of the Om
budsman that are relevant to his role and it might be
worth reporting these here also.
The Ombudsman appeared as a speaker at a local
hospital which is considering introducing the office on
its staff. He also met with representatives of a large
industrial concern which is considering instituting the
office.
He has met twice with the "Ombudsman's Caucus"
which is a loose organization of Ombudsmen at various
California schools and colleges. He prepared a paper for
this group entitled, "The Use of the Student Record as a
Sanction."
Finally, I want to thank again administrators, stu
dents, faculty, and staff for the very high level of
coutesy and cooperation which I have received. Without
these and a willingness on the part of departments and
individuals to solve their own problems, the office could
be neither viable nor credible.
The Ombudsman at the University of Chicago in his
most recent published Report tells about a student who
reported a missing desk-in fact he reported that it had
been stolen. In the end the problem was solved when he
stole it back-but perhaps that is showing a little too
much initiative.
