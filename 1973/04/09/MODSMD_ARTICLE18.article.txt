# Stanford Surgeon's Warning
## Public Expects Too Much From Doctors 
### 
A surgeon here says politicians
are overinflating the public's
expectation of doctors.
They make promises as they
introduce health care legislation
that cannot be met with dollars
alone, says Dr. Robert Chase,
professor and chairman of the
Department of Surgery at the
School of Medicine.
"The concept of total freedom
from disease as a right, and the
physician's total responsibility for
it, is a dangerous social illusion,"
he concludes.
Chase's remarks appear in an
article on "The Physician Image:
Expectation versus Reality" in the
current issue of Stanford M.D.,
the magazine of the Stanford
Medical Alumni Association.
"It is clear," Chase writes,
"that public expectations go well
beyond what physicians can do
for individual patients .... The
new doctor is expected to cope
with overpopulation, famine,
slums, pollution, traffic, racism,
political corruption," and more.
Politicians Must Share Blame
Politicians, says Chase, must
share some of the blame for the
public expecting too much from
doctors. "The politician
characteristically looks for a
scapegoat, and where health care
is involved, there is no one more
vulnerable than the American
physician. There is, in a sense, a
tendency to cast the M.D. in the
villain role."
Chase cited these examples:
when Sen. Edward Kennedy's
health subcommittee hearings
were held in 1971 to "hear the
people on the health crisis," the
proceedings, "had all the earmarks
of a political campaign," says
Chase. "In my view they lacked
objectivity and played upon
emotionalism."
In another instance, John

Knowles, a prominent figure in
medicine, was quoted as saying,
"M.D.'s are the largest single
purchasers of Lincoln
Continentals." The Massachusetts
Medical Society invited Knowles
to document his allegations, but
his response was, "I'm not going
to diddle around with those
jerks." The medical society, says
Chase, censured him.
News Media Responsibility
Chase says the news media has
also been responsible for
developing the physician's public
image, with "repeated derogatory
articles and presentations."
The now defunct "Life"
magazine last year published an
editorial "Our Sick Medical
System," then was surprised to
see the results of a poll of its
readers: 68 percent thought their
treatment was good to excellent;
70 percent thought their doctors
cared about them personally; only
15 percent considered their care
poor.
The surgeon notes that surveys

and analyses have shown the
typical patient is very
complimentary about his own
doctor, but uncomplimentary
about "most doctors and
organized medicine."
Harris Poll Results
He cites the Louis Harris poll
in 1972 showing that college
students rate the M.D. as
"dedicated man," though they
feel his fees are too high. Another
survey indicated that respondents
expressed more confidence in
medical leadership than in any
other field.
In another study ranking
occupations, the physician was
number two in prestige behind
only the Supreme Court justices.
Congressmen rated eighth, lawyers
11th, ministers 17 th, and
newspaper columnists 46th.
Stating that "physicians do
care deeply about their public
image," Chase suggests measures
that might be taken to improve it.
"On a personal level," he
recommends "it is important to

reverse the vicious circle of
mutual alienation which currently
exists between the patient and
physician, in which the patient
suggests that physicians are
'machines' and 'money grabbers'
while at the same time physicians
call the patients 'ingrates.' "
He says physicians must
readjust the image of organized
medicine by participating in it
more and participating less in
activity that appears to have
self-interest rather than interest in
the public. They should also avoid
Madison Avenue tactics to paint a
new image. "It has proven
ineffective and actually counter
productive."
"Organized medicine," he says,
"must show evidence that it is
willing to discipline itself through
active peer review, and more
active disciplinary actions against
physicians who abuse their
privileges."
Chase notes that in 19th
century America, the family
doctor became a trusted and

respected community member,
often idealized and glorified. With
the rise of scientific medicine
censure of medical skill became
less frequent.

vulnerable than the American
physician. There is, in a sense, a
tendency to cast the M.D. in the
villain role."
Chase cited these examples:
when Sen. Edward Kennedy's
health subcommittee hearings
were held in 1971 to "hear the
people on the health crisis," the
proceedings, "had all the earmarks
of a political campaign," says
Chase. "In my view they lacked
objectivity and played upon
emotionalism."
In another instance, John

Knowles, a prominent figure in
medicine, was quoted as saying,
"M.D.'s are the largest single
purchasers of Lincoln
Continentals." The Massachusetts
Medical Society invited Knowles
to document his allegations, but
his response was, "I'm not going
to diddle around with those
jerks." The medical society, says
Chase, censured him.
News Media Responsibility
Chase says the news media has
also been responsible for
developing the physician's public
image, with "repeated derogatory
articles and presentations."
The now defunct "Life"
magazine last year published an
editorial "Our Sick Medical
System," then was surprised to
see the results of a poll of its
readers: 68 percent thought their
treatment was good to excellent;
70 percent thought their doctors
cared about them personally; only
15 percent considered their care
poor.
The surgeon notes that surveys

and analyses have shown the
typical patient is very
complimentary about his own
doctor, but uncomplimentary
about "most doctors and
organized medicine."
Harris Poll Results
He cites the Louis Harris poll
in 1972 showing that college
students rate the M.D. as
"dedicated man," though they
feel his fees are too high. Another
survey indicated that respondents
expressed more confidence in
medical leadership than in any
other field.
In another study ranking
occupations, the physician was
number two in prestige behind
only the Supreme Court justices.
Congressmen rated eighth, lawyers
11th, ministers 17 th, and
newspaper columnists 46th.
Stating that "physicians do
care deeply about their public
image," Chase suggests measures
that might be taken to improve it.
"On a personal level," he
recommends "it is important to

reverse the vicious circle of
mutual alienation which currently
exists between the patient and
physician, in which the patient
suggests that physicians are
'machines' and 'money grabbers'
while at the same time physicians
call the patients 'ingrates.' "
He says physicians must
readjust the image of organized
medicine by participating in it
more and participating less in
activity that appears to have
self-interest rather than interest in
the public. They should also avoid
Madison Avenue tactics to paint a
new image. "It has proven
ineffective and actually counter
productive."
"Organized medicine," he says,
"must show evidence that it is
willing to discipline itself through
active peer review, and more
active disciplinary actions against
physicians who abuse their
privileges."
Chase notes that in 19th
century America, the family
doctor became a trusted and

respected community member,
often idealized and glorified. With
the rise of scientific medicine
censure of medical skill became
less frequent.
A surgeon here says politicians
are overinflating the public's
expectation of doctors.
They make promises as they
introduce health care legislation
that cannot be met with dollars
alone, says Dr. Robert Chase,
professor and chairman of the
Department of Surgery at the
School of Medicine.
"The concept of total freedom
from disease as a right, and the
physician's total responsibility for
it, is a dangerous social illusion,"
he concludes.
Chase's remarks appear in an
article on "The Physician Image:
Expectation versus Reality" in the
current issue of Stanford M.D.,
the magazine of the Stanford
Medical Alumni Association.
"It is clear," Chase writes,
"that public expectations go well
beyond what physicians can do
for individual patients .... The
new doctor is expected to cope
with overpopulation, famine,
slums, pollution, traffic, racism,
political corruption," and more.
Politicians Must Share Blame
Politicians, says Chase, must
share some of the blame for the
public expecting too much from
doctors. "The politician
characteristically looks for a
scapegoat, and where health care
is involved, there is no one more
vulnerable than the American
physician. There is, in a sense, a
tendency to cast the M.D. in the
villain role."
Chase cited these examples:
