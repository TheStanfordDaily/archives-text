# Chapel Dean Wants Greater Part For Religion In University Affairs
## 
### BRUCE KADDEN 
"I would like to see the church
remain an important part of the
university ... I hope in the future it
will promote its own conferences and
lecturers on moral and religious
issues."
These are the comments of the new
Dean of the Chapel, Robert G.H.
Kelly, 34, who preached his first
sermon in Memorial Church yesterday.
Kelly, born in South Africa and
educated at Cambridge, England,
succeeded Prof. Robert McAfee Brown
who served as acting Dean of the
Chapel after the Rev. B. David Napier
was appointed president of the Pacific
School of Religion last year.
Same Tradition
Kelly considers himself to be a part
of the "same liberal-Protestant
tradition" of his two immediate
predecessors.
"I don't see politics as the chief
form Christian life takes, but all

human life is political in some way,"
he said.
Two areas in which Kelly believes
religion should be involved are
economics and health care. He said
that when a new product is thought
up, everyone must ask themselves not
only "Will it make a buck?" but also
"Will it make a contribution to
society?" and more importantly "Will
it be safe?"
In the area of health care, Kelly
feels that "medical ethics," specifically
the "right to die" issue, must be
examined in a religious context.
Despite his insistence on including
political and social issues with religion,
Kelly says he is "a very religious dean
as well."
He relates the two (religion and
socio/political issues) by saying,
"Christian Gospel offers and effects
the fullest kind of life and joy; my
religious aim here is the aim of my

whole life."
Kelly was recommended to Pres.
Richard W. Lyman by a
student-faculty-staff research
committee.
He had "deeply personal reasons,
that have to do with my own sense of
vocations," for deciding to accept.
"I'm kind of waiting to see why I had
those feelings," he added.
Although he was sorry to leave
Chicago, where he taught at the
McCormick Theological Seminary, he
says he feels right at home here.
Kelly believes there is a difference
between his job at a university and
that of a minister with his own parish.
'Honest Language'
"The nature of the language and
the kind of argument one uses to show
the use of the Christian religion must
be more cogent... the university uses
a more honest language," he said.
"In a parish, I would be speaking to

people who already agree with me,
whereas here many of the people
haven't signed up yet."
Kelly has never really had his own
parish. "I've been a professor all my
life, so I feel like a fish back in water."
"I would like to see the church
remain an important part of the
university ... I hope in the future it
will promote its own conferences and
lecturers on moral and religious
issues."

McCormick Theological Seminary, he
says he feels right at home here.
Kelly believes there is a difference
between his job at a university and
that of a minister with his own parish.
'Honest Language'
"The nature of the language and
the kind of argument one uses to show
the use of the Christian religion must
be more cogent... the university uses
a more honest language," he said.
"In a parish, I would be speaking to

people who already agree with me,
whereas here many of the people
haven't signed up yet."
Kelly has never really had his own
parish. "I've been a professor all my
life, so I feel like a fish back in water."
"I would like to see the church
remain an important part of the
university ... I hope in the future it
will promote its own conferences and
lecturers on moral and religious
issues."
These are the comments of the new
Dean of the Chapel, Robert G.H.
Kelly, 34, who preached his first
sermon in Memorial Church yesterday.
Kelly, born in South Africa and
educated at Cambridge, England,
succeeded Prof. Robert McAfee Brown
who served as acting Dean of the
Chapel after the Rev. B. David Napier
was appointed president of the Pacific
School of Religion last year.
Same Tradition
Kelly considers himself to be a part
of the "same liberal-Protestant
tradition" of his two immediate
predecessors.
"I don't see politics as the chief
form Christian life takes, but all

human life is political in some way,"
he said.
Two areas in which Kelly believes
religion should be involved are
economics and health care. He said
that when a new product is thought
up, everyone must ask themselves not
only "Will it make a buck?" but also
"Will it make a contribution to
society?" and more importantly "Will
it be safe?"
In the area of health care, Kelly
feels that "medical ethics," specifically
the "right to die" issue, must be
examined in a religious context.
Despite his insistence on including
political and social issues with religion,
Kelly says he is "a very religious dean
as well."
He relates the two (religion and
socio/political issues) by saying,
"Christian Gospel offers and effects
the fullest kind of life and joy; my
religious aim here is the aim of my

whole life."
Kelly was recommended to Pres.
Richard W. Lyman by a
student-faculty-staff research
committee.
He had "deeply personal reasons,
that have to do with my own sense of
vocations," for deciding to accept.
"I'm kind of waiting to see why I had
those feelings," he added.
Although he was sorry to leave
Chicago, where he taught at the
McCormick Theological Seminary, he
says he feels right at home here.
