# For Silence In Watergate Probe
## Republican Senator Asks White House Aides To Quit 
### Walter T. Mears Associated Press Writer 
WASHINGTON — Republican Sen. Lowell P.
Weicker Jr. says any White House aides who
refuse to testify if called in the Senate's
Watergate investigation "owe it to the American
public" to resign.
Weicker said that goes for H.R. Haldeman, the
White House chief of staff; John W. Dean 111,
counsel to the president; and others "who are or
will be subject to questioning" in the Senate
inquiry.
President Nixon has said he will not permit
present or former members of his staff to appear
at formal sessions of the Senate investigating
committee, citing the doctrine of executive
privilege.
Weicker, a member of the committee, said
executive privilege, in his view, "has absolutely
no bearing at all" in the investigation of alleged
political espionage.
The Connecticut senator said in an interview
that he still believes Haldeman had general
knowledge of the policies and personalities
involved in the Watergate wiretapping, but that
President Nixon did not.
Disavows Ambitions
Weicker, disavowing any national political
ambitions, said he thinks other Republicans want
somebody like him to speak out on the political
espionage issue "so that we don't get this hung
around the Republican neck."
A partial text of the interview:
Q: You have been more critical of the
administration on the Watergate than have other
Republicans. Why?
A: .. . This is a matter that I was involved in
back in October, I was speaking out
then . .. while the presidential election was
going on and while Republicans weren't

supposed to be talking about Watergate and
ITT... I felt the only way to gain any
credibility here was to go ahead and say it at a
time when you're not supposed to be saying it,
or a Republican is not supposed to be saying
it....
Haldeman's Knowledge
Q: You have said H.R. Haldeman had general
knowledge of the personalities and policies
involved in this case, but a committee statement
said He wasn't linked by the current evidence
with any illegal political espionage or sabotage.
A:... This statement was rather carefully
worded on their part, but it specifically doesn't
link him to any illegal activity. This is exactly
what I have stated ... I have no evidence linking
Mr. Haldeman to any specific illegal act... .
Q: Do you still feel that he knew generally of
what was going on?
A: I stay right where I was before. Do I hold
him responsible as chief of staff for the personnel
at the Committee to Re-elect the President,
White House? Do I feel that he had knowledge of
the policies of the Committee to Re-elect the
President? I do ... .
Should Haldeman Resign?
Q: Do you still feel that he should resign?
A: I certainly do, let me put it this way ... As
long as these fellows aren't going to come up
here and testify I think they owe it to the
American public and everybody else to get out.
I'm just giving an alternative to Sen. Sam Ervin
the committee chairman wanting to send the
sergeant at arms down there and arrest them all.
My alternative is if they will not come up here,
Haldeman and others, as long as these men will
not come up and testify, I think they ought to
get out.
Q: Who are the others?
A: Other individuals who are or will be

subject to questioning by the Senate panel, but
we've been told that nobody's coming up.
Q: Do you mean Haldeman and John Dean?
A: I can see that there might be more than
that, too. I don't see that you can restrict it to
them. I think it's absolutely essential that if
we're going to get to the bottom of this
matter . . . that the individuals who are named
and will be named come up here and testify
before the committee.
Q: Do you think the President had any
general knowledge similar to that you believe
Haldeman had?
A: . . . No, the answer is no, I don't think the
President is involved ....
Power To Arrest
Q: Do you believe the Senate has the power
to arrest an aide to the President for refusing to
testify?
A: I support Sen. Ervin on that ... I do that
on the basis that I assume that he's done his
research... To me, the executive privilege
situation has absolutely no bearing at all on this
case, just none ... As a matter of history, it
doesn't bear on what confronts us now. The
general concept as applied to national security is
correct ...
Q: You said you were offering an alternative
by suggesting that Haldeman and perhaps others
resign if they won't testify. But presumably, they
wouldn't testify as former aides, either.
'End Up With Zero'
A: You end up with zero, but at least we
don't have to have them in the
government. .. Who is it in this government,
who is it that thinks they've got the right to keep
silent on any matter? Where did all this business
get started?
Q: You mentioned you were doing your own
investigating.

A: Yes ... I think I enhance my own value
and the role 1 can play if 1 get a real feel for what
was going on, the attitudes and the emotions and
the people ... 1 just spent 10 hours last weekend
with Al Baldwin a former FBI agent who has
testified he was hired to listen to tapped
Democratic telephone calls ....
Q: What are you investigating?
A: 1 would say the personnel and the policies
and the relationships and the activities of the
operation here in Washington, CRP and the
White House staff.
General Knowledge
Q: Is it on this basis that you say Haldeman
had general knowledge of this?
A: That's right.
Q: There is always the suspicion, when a man
in your position hits an issue the way you are
hitting this one, that he is a possible candidate
for national office.
A: That's very easy to answer, and not in the
usual politician's coy way. I can't be legally, 1
was born outside the United States of America.
He was born in Paris, to American parents .... I
have absolutely no desire to be anything but a
U.S. senator and that's no ifs, ands or
buts ... No man should come off of this aspiring
for any higher office, because then again the
American people are just going to look at it as
another, typical, old politics routine. And this is
just too darned important. . . The Republican
Party and everybody ought to hope that this
committee really does prevail. If they don't
prevail you'll have set new standards as to what
election tactics are going to consist of and God
help America if that's going to be it.
Q: Have other Republicans in the
administration, the national committee,
suggested that you should go easier on this, avoid

making trouble for your own party?
A: Most of the chatter I get, at least from my
Republicans in Connecticut and some fellows on
the Senate floor, is that we want somebody out
there speaking on the issue so that we don't get
this hung around the Republican neck. Does
anybody as a matter of politics want to accept
the tactics as to how to handle this situation that
are emanating from the White House? Is that
what the Republicans want to accept? That's the
best way to answer that question ... 1 can't
understand these tactics. But unless a Republican
speaks out against them, they're ours. Well,
they're not mine.

White House? Do I feel that he had knowledge of
the policies of the Committee to Re-elect the
President? I do ... .
Should Haldeman Resign?
Q: Do you still feel that he should resign?
A: I certainly do, let me put it this way ... As
long as these fellows aren't going to come up
here and testify I think they owe it to the
American public and everybody else to get out.
I'm just giving an alternative to Sen. Sam Ervin
the committee chairman wanting to send the
sergeant at arms down there and arrest them all.
My alternative is if they will not come up here,
Haldeman and others, as long as these men will
not come up and testify, I think they ought to
get out.
Q: Who are the others?
A: Other individuals who are or will be

subject to questioning by the Senate panel, but
we've been told that nobody's coming up.
Q: Do you mean Haldeman and John Dean?
A: I can see that there might be more than
that, too. I don't see that you can restrict it to
them. I think it's absolutely essential that if
we're going to get to the bottom of this
matter . . . that the individuals who are named
and will be named come up here and testify
before the committee.
Q: Do you think the President had any
general knowledge similar to that you believe
Haldeman had?
A: . . . No, the answer is no, I don't think the
President is involved ....
Power To Arrest
Q: Do you believe the Senate has the power
to arrest an aide to the President for refusing to
testify?
A: I support Sen. Ervin on that ... I do that
on the basis that I assume that he's done his
research... To me, the executive privilege
situation has absolutely no bearing at all on this
case, just none ... As a matter of history, it
doesn't bear on what confronts us now. The
general concept as applied to national security is
correct ...
Q: You said you were offering an alternative
by suggesting that Haldeman and perhaps others
resign if they won't testify. But presumably, they
wouldn't testify as former aides, either.
'End Up With Zero'
A: You end up with zero, but at least we
don't have to have them in the
government. .. Who is it in this government,
who is it that thinks they've got the right to keep
silent on any matter? Where did all this business
get started?
Q: You mentioned you were doing your own
investigating.

A: Yes ... I think I enhance my own value
and the role 1 can play if 1 get a real feel for what
was going on, the attitudes and the emotions and
the people ... 1 just spent 10 hours last weekend
with Al Baldwin a former FBI agent who has
testified he was hired to listen to tapped
Democratic telephone calls ....
Q: What are you investigating?
A: 1 would say the personnel and the policies
and the relationships and the activities of the
operation here in Washington, CRP and the
White House staff.
General Knowledge
Q: Is it on this basis that you say Haldeman
had general knowledge of this?
A: That's right.
Q: There is always the suspicion, when a man
in your position hits an issue the way you are
hitting this one, that he is a possible candidate
for national office.
A: That's very easy to answer, and not in the
usual politician's coy way. I can't be legally, 1
was born outside the United States of America.
He was born in Paris, to American parents .... I
have absolutely no desire to be anything but a
U.S. senator and that's no ifs, ands or
buts ... No man should come off of this aspiring
for any higher office, because then again the
American people are just going to look at it as
another, typical, old politics routine. And this is
just too darned important. . . The Republican
Party and everybody ought to hope that this
committee really does prevail. If they don't
prevail you'll have set new standards as to what
election tactics are going to consist of and God
help America if that's going to be it.
Q: Have other Republicans in the
administration, the national committee,
suggested that you should go easier on this, avoid

making trouble for your own party?
A: Most of the chatter I get, at least from my
Republicans in Connecticut and some fellows on
the Senate floor, is that we want somebody out
there speaking on the issue so that we don't get
this hung around the Republican neck. Does
anybody as a matter of politics want to accept
the tactics as to how to handle this situation that
are emanating from the White House? Is that
what the Republicans want to accept? That's the
best way to answer that question ... 1 can't
understand these tactics. But unless a Republican
speaks out against them, they're ours. Well,
they're not mine.
WASHINGTON — Republican Sen. Lowell P.
Weicker Jr. says any White House aides who
refuse to testify if called in the Senate's
Watergate investigation "owe it to the American
public" to resign.
Weicker said that goes for H.R. Haldeman, the
White House chief of staff; John W. Dean 111,
counsel to the president; and others "who are or
will be subject to questioning" in the Senate
inquiry.
President Nixon has said he will not permit
present or former members of his staff to appear
at formal sessions of the Senate investigating
committee, citing the doctrine of executive
privilege.
Weicker, a member of the committee, said
executive privilege, in his view, "has absolutely
no bearing at all" in the investigation of alleged
political espionage.
The Connecticut senator said in an interview
that he still believes Haldeman had general
knowledge of the policies and personalities
involved in the Watergate wiretapping, but that
President Nixon did not.
Disavows Ambitions
Weicker, disavowing any national political
ambitions, said he thinks other Republicans want
somebody like him to speak out on the political
espionage issue "so that we don't get this hung
around the Republican neck."
A partial text of the interview:
Q: You have been more critical of the
administration on the Watergate than have other
Republicans. Why?
A: .. . This is a matter that I was involved in
back in October, I was speaking out
then . .. while the presidential election was
going on and while Republicans weren't

supposed to be talking about Watergate and
ITT... I felt the only way to gain any
credibility here was to go ahead and say it at a
time when you're not supposed to be saying it,
or a Republican is not supposed to be saying
it....
Haldeman's Knowledge
Q: You have said H.R. Haldeman had general
knowledge of the personalities and policies
involved in this case, but a committee statement
said He wasn't linked by the current evidence
with any illegal political espionage or sabotage.
A:... This statement was rather carefully
worded on their part, but it specifically doesn't
link him to any illegal activity. This is exactly
what I have stated ... I have no evidence linking
Mr. Haldeman to any specific illegal act... .
Q: Do you still feel that he knew generally of
what was going on?
A: I stay right where I was before. Do I hold
him responsible as chief of staff for the personnel
at the Committee to Re-elect the President,
White House? Do I feel that he had knowledge of
the policies of the Committee to Re-elect the
President? I do ... .

investigating.

A: Yes ... I think I enhance my own value
and the role 1 can play if 1 get a real feel for what
was going on, the attitudes and the emotions and
the people ... 1 just spent 10 hours last weekend
with Al Baldwin a former FBI agent who has
testified he was hired to listen to tapped
Democratic telephone calls ....
Q: What are you investigating?
A: 1 would say the personnel and the policies
and the relationships and the activities of the
operation here in Washington, CRP and the
White House staff.
General Knowledge
Q: Is it on this basis that you say Haldeman
had general knowledge of this?
A: That's right.
Q: There is always the suspicion, when a man
in your position hits an issue the way you are
hitting this one, that he is a possible candidate
for national office.
A: That's very easy to answer, and not in the
usual politician's coy way. I can't be legally, 1
was born outside the United States of America.
He was born in Paris, to American parents .... I
have absolutely no desire to be anything but a
U.S. senator and that's no ifs, ands or
buts ... No man should come off of this aspiring
for any higher office, because then again the
American people are just going to look at it as
another, typical, old politics routine. And this is
just too darned important. . . The Republican
Party and everybody ought to hope that this
committee really does prevail. If they don't
prevail you'll have set new standards as to what
election tactics are going to consist of and God
help America if that's going to be it.
Q: Have other Republicans in the
administration, the national committee,
suggested that you should go easier on this, avoid

making trouble for your own party?
A: Most of the chatter I get, at least from my
Republicans in Connecticut and some fellows on
the Senate floor, is that we want somebody out
there speaking on the issue so that we don't get
this hung around the Republican neck. Does
anybody as a matter of politics want to accept
the tactics as to how to handle this situation that
are emanating from the White House? Is that
what the Republicans want to accept? That's the
best way to answer that question ... 1 can't
understand these tactics. But unless a Republican
speaks out against them, they're ours. Well,
they're not mine.
WASHINGTON — Republican Sen. Lowell P.
Weicker Jr. says any White House aides who
refuse to testify if called in the Senate's
Watergate investigation "owe it to the American
public" to resign.
Weicker said that goes for H.R. Haldeman, the
White House chief of staff; John W. Dean 111,
counsel to the president; and others "who are or
will be subject to questioning" in the Senate
inquiry.
President Nixon has said he will not permit
present or former members of his staff to appear
at formal sessions of the Senate investigating
committee, citing the doctrine of executive
privilege.
Weicker, a member of the committee, said
executive privilege, in his view, "has absolutely
no bearing at all" in the investigation of alleged
political espionage.
The Connecticut senator said in an interview
that he still believes Haldeman had general
knowledge of the policies and personalities
involved in the Watergate wiretapping, but that
President Nixon did not.
Disavows Ambitions
Weicker, disavowing any national political
ambitions, said he thinks other Republicans want
somebody like him to speak out on the political
espionage issue "so that we don't get this hung
around the Republican neck."
A partial text of the interview:
Q: You have been more critical of the
administration on the Watergate than have other
Republicans. Why?
A: .. . This is a matter that I was involved in
back in October, I was speaking out
then . .. while the presidential election was
going on and while Republicans weren't

supposed to be talking about Watergate and
ITT... I felt the only way to gain any
credibility here was to go ahead and say it at a
time when you're not supposed to be saying it,
or a Republican is not supposed to be saying
it....
Haldeman's Knowledge
Q: You have said H.R. Haldeman had general
knowledge of the personalities and policies
involved in this case, but a committee statement
said He wasn't linked by the current evidence
with any illegal political espionage or sabotage.
A:... This statement was rather carefully
worded on their part, but it specifically doesn't
link him to any illegal activity. This is exactly
what I have stated ... I have no evidence linking
Mr. Haldeman to any specific illegal act... .
Q: Do you still feel that he knew generally of
what was going on?
A: I stay right where I was before. Do I hold
him responsible as chief of staff for the personnel
at the Committee to Re-elect the President,
White House? Do I feel that he had knowledge of
the policies of the Committee to Re-elect the
President? I do ... .
Should Haldeman Resign?
Q: Do you still feel that he should resign?
A: I certainly do, let me put it this way ... As
long as these fellows aren't going to come up
here and testify I think they owe it to the
American public and everybody else to get out.
I'm just giving an alternative to Sen. Sam Ervin
the committee chairman wanting to send the
sergeant at arms down there and arrest them all.
My alternative is if they will not come up here,
Haldeman and others, as long as these men will
not come up and testify, I think they ought to
get out.
Q: Who are the others?
A: Other individuals who are or will be

subject to questioning by the Senate panel, but
we've been told that nobody's coming up.
Q: Do you mean Haldeman and John Dean?
A: I can see that there might be more than
that, too. I don't see that you can restrict it to
them. I think it's absolutely essential that if
we're going to get to the bottom of this
matter . . . that the individuals who are named
and will be named come up here and testify
before the committee.
Q: Do you think the President had any
general knowledge similar to that you believe
Haldeman had?
A: . . . No, the answer is no, I don't think the
President is involved ....
Power To Arrest
Q: Do you believe the Senate has the power
to arrest an aide to the President for refusing to
testify?
A: I support Sen. Ervin on that ... I do that
on the basis that I assume that he's done his
research... To me, the executive privilege
situation has absolutely no bearing at all on this
case, just none ... As a matter of history, it
doesn't bear on what confronts us now. The
general concept as applied to national security is
correct ...
Q: You said you were offering an alternative
by suggesting that Haldeman and perhaps others
resign if they won't testify. But presumably, they
wouldn't testify as former aides, either.
'End Up With Zero'
A: You end up with zero, but at least we
don't have to have them in the
government. .. Who is it in this government,
who is it that thinks they've got the right to keep
silent on any matter? Where did all this business
get started?
Q: You mentioned you were doing your own
investigating.

A: Yes ... I think I enhance my own value

was going on, the attitudes and the emotions and

Watergate investigation "owe it to the American
public" to resign.
Weicker said that goes for H.R. Haldeman, the
White House chief of staff; John W. Dean 111,
counsel to the president; and others "who are or
will be subject to questioning" in the Senate
inquiry.
President Nixon has said he will not permit
present or former members of his staff to appear
at formal sessions of the Senate investigating
committee, citing the doctrine of executive
privilege.
Weicker, a member of the committee, said
executive privilege, in his view, "has absolutely
no bearing at all" in the investigation of alleged
political espionage.
The Connecticut senator said in an interview
that he still believes Haldeman had general
knowledge of the policies and personalities
involved in the Watergate wiretapping, but that
President Nixon did not.
Disavows Ambitions
Weicker, disavowing any national political
ambitions, said he thinks other Republicans want
somebody like him to speak out on the political
espionage issue "so that we don't get this hung
around the Republican neck."
A partial text of the interview:
Q: You have been more critical of the
administration on the Watergate than have other
Republicans. Why?
A: .. . This is a matter that I was involved in
back in October, I was speaking out
then . .. while the presidential election was
going on and while Republicans weren't

supposed to be talking about Watergate and
ITT... I felt the only way to gain any
credibility here was to go ahead and say it at a
time when you're not supposed to be saying it,
or a Republican is not supposed to be saying
it....
Haldeman's Knowledge
Q: You have said H.R. Haldeman had general
knowledge of the personalities and policies
involved in this case, but a committee statement
said He wasn't linked by the current evidence
with any illegal political espionage or sabotage.
A:... This statement was rather carefully
worded on their part, but it specifically doesn't
link him to any illegal activity. This is exactly
what I have stated ... I have no evidence linking
Mr. Haldeman to any specific illegal act... .
Q: Do you still feel that he knew generally of
what was going on?
A: I stay right where I was before. Do I hold
him responsible as chief of staff for the personnel
at the Committee to Re-elect the President,
White House? Do I feel that he had knowledge of
the policies of the Committee to Re-elect the
President? I do ... .
Should Haldeman Resign?
Q: Do you still feel that he should resign?
A: I certainly do, let me put it this way ... As
long as these fellows aren't going to come up
here and testify I think they owe it to the
American public and everybody else to get out.
I'm just giving an alternative to Sen. Sam Ervin
the committee chairman wanting to send the
sergeant at arms down there and arrest them all.
My alternative is if they will not come up here,
Haldeman and others, as long as these men will
not come up and testify, I think they ought to
get out.
Q: Who are the others?
A: Other individuals who are or will be

subject to questioning by the Senate panel, but
we've been told that nobody's coming up.
Q: Do you mean Haldeman and John Dean?
A: I can see that there might be more than
that, too. I don't see that you can restrict it to
them. I think it's absolutely essential that if
we're going to get to the bottom of this
matter . . . that the individuals who are named
and will be named come up here and testify
before the committee.
Q: Do you think the President had any
general knowledge similar to that you believe
Haldeman had?
A: . . . No, the answer is no, I don't think the
President is involved ....
Power To Arrest
Q: Do you believe the Senate has the power
to arrest an aide to the President for refusing to
testify?
A: I support Sen. Ervin on that ... I do that
on the basis that I assume that he's done his
research... To me, the executive privilege
situation has absolutely no bearing at all on this
case, just none ... As a matter of history, it
doesn't bear on what confronts us now. The
general concept as applied to national security is
correct ...
Q: You said you were offering an alternative
by suggesting that Haldeman and perhaps others
resign if they won't testify. But presumably, they
wouldn't testify as former aides, either.
'End Up With Zero'
A: You end up with zero, but at least we
don't have to have them in the
government. .. Who is it in this government,
who is it that thinks they've got the right to keep
silent on any matter? Where did all this business
get started?
Q: You mentioned you were doing your own
investigating.

A: Yes ... I think I enhance my own value
and the role 1 can play if 1 get a real feel for what
was going on, the attitudes and the emotions and
the people ... 1 just spent 10 hours last weekend
with Al Baldwin a former FBI agent who has
testified he was hired to listen to tapped
Democratic telephone calls ....
Q: What are you investigating?
A: 1 would say the personnel and the policies
and the relationships and the activities of the
operation here in Washington, CRP and the
White House staff.
General Knowledge
Q: Is it on this basis that you say Haldeman
had general knowledge of this?
A: That's right.
Q: There is always the suspicion, when a man
in your position hits an issue the way you are
hitting this one, that he is a possible candidate
for national office.
A: That's very easy to answer, and not in the
usual politician's coy way. I can't be legally, 1
was born outside the United States of America.
He was born in Paris, to American parents .... I
have absolutely no desire to be anything but a
U.S. senator and that's no ifs, ands or
buts ... No man should come off of this aspiring
for any higher office, because then again the
American people are just going to look at it as
another, typical, old politics routine. And this is
just too darned important. . . The Republican
Party and everybody ought to hope that this
committee really does prevail. If they don't
prevail you'll have set new standards as to what
election tactics are going to consist of and God
help America if that's going to be it.
Q: Have other Republicans in the
administration, the national committee,
suggested that you should go easier on this, avoid

making trouble for your own party?
A: Most of the chatter I get, at least from my
Republicans in Connecticut and some fellows on
the Senate floor, is that we want somebody out
there speaking on the issue so that we don't get
this hung around the Republican neck. Does
anybody as a matter of politics want to accept
the tactics as to how to handle this situation that
are emanating from the White House? Is that
what the Republicans want to accept? That's the
best way to answer that question ... 1 can't
understand these tactics. But unless a Republican
speaks out against them, they're ours. Well,
they're not mine.
