# Card Netmen Stunned Twice In Los Angeles
## 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
The hopes of the Stanford
tennis team for its first NCAA
outdoor championship were
thrown abruptly off stride by
USC and UCLA over the
weekend. USC shocked the
Cardinals 6-3 on Friday, while
UCLA edged them 5-4 Saturday
in Los Angeles.
The losses, which put the
Cards' season record at 7-2, can be
avenged in two weeks when the
Los Angeles powers come to
Stanford, but nevertheless
indicate that the nation's three
best collegiate tennis teams are all
very close in ability.
The loss to USC Friday before
a huge crowd in the Trojans' new
David X. Marks tennis stadium,
was particularly jolting, as it had
been believed that the Trojans
were weaker in hard competition
than either Stanford or UCLA.
Mexican Davis Cupper Raul
Ramirez, USC's top man, was
particularly impressive in beating
Stanford's best player, Sandy
Mayer, 4-6, 7-6, 6-3.
At fourth singles India's Sashi
Menon topped Gery Groslimond
7-6, 6-1, while at fifth singles
John Holladay topped John
Whitlinger, 6-1, 7-5.

Stanford got its three wins at
the other singles slots. Jim
Delaney topped John Andrews
6-4, 6-4 at second singles, while at
third singles, Rick Fisher downed
Mike Machette 6-3, 7-6. At the
sixth and final singles position,
Pat DuPre beat Mike Wayman 6-4,
6-0.
Thus this match was even going
into the doubles, but the Trojans,
in marked contrast to the
National Indoor Toumey in
Madison, overwhelmed Stanford
here.
At first doubles, Ramirez and
Menon topped Rick Fisher and
Groslimond 7-5, 4-6, 6-3. At
second doubles, Andrews and
Machette beat Mayer and
Whitlinger 6-3, 6-3. And at third
doubles, Holladay and Dave
Borelli made the sweep complete
by edging Chip Fisher and
Delaney, 1-6, 6-4, 7-6.
Depressing Defeat
The loss to UCLA the next day
was not quite as unexpected, but
was nonetheless depressing, since
Stanford actually won more sets
than the Bruins, taking 11 to their
opponents 10. All four Stanford
winners won in straight sets, while
three of the five Bruin victors
were extended to three sets.

Stanford won the top two
matches, Mayer beating Jeff
Austin 6-4, 7-6 and Delaney
topping Kreiss, 7-6, 6-3.
UCLA came on to win at the
next three positions, Steve
Krulevitz setting the tone by
upsetting Rick Fisher 6-4, 6-7, 6-4
at third singles. At fourth singles,
Rayno Segars dealt Groslimond
his second consecutive loss, 2-6,
6-3, 7-5.
At fifth singles Whitlinger also
lost his second straight after seven
consecutive wins, losing to Brian
Teacher, 3-6, 6-2, 6-2. At sixth
singles, Pat DuPre, once again won
in straight sets, this time over
Steve Mott, 6-2, 6-4.
Doubles Disaster
Once again, it was all tied going
into the doubles matches. And
once again, the Cardinals lost the
match here.
Austin and Kreiss topped Rick
Fisher and Groslimond, 6-4, 7-6,
the second time in three matches
this year that the UCLA stars have
beaten the Cardinal top team.
At second doubles, Mayer and
Whitlinger got the Cards' only
doubles win of the weekend,
beating Krulevitz and Segars, 7-6,
6-4. However, Stanford lost at
third doubles, the
newly-organized team of Delaney
and DuPre being beaten by the
experienced team of Mott and
Teacher, 7-6, 6-4.
The most apparent result of
the weekend's matches was that
Stanford needs more doubles
work if it is to beat USC out for
the Pac-8 title, which will be held
at the Trojans' new stadium in
May.
A hopeful sign for the
Cardinals was the play of both
Delaney, who had little trouble
and may just compete for the
NCAA singles title, DuPre, who
seemed to be undermatched at
sixth singles after having lost his
fifth singles spot during recent
challenge matches.

Krulevitz setting the tone by
upsetting Rick Fisher 6-4, 6-7, 6-4
at third singles. At fourth singles,
Rayno Segars dealt Groslimond
his second consecutive loss, 2-6,
6-3, 7-5.
At fifth singles Whitlinger also
lost his second straight after seven
consecutive wins, losing to Brian
Teacher, 3-6, 6-2, 6-2. At sixth
singles, Pat DuPre, once again won
in straight sets, this time over
Steve Mott, 6-2, 6-4.
Doubles Disaster
Once again, it was all tied going
into the doubles matches. And
once again, the Cardinals lost the
match here.
Austin and Kreiss topped Rick
Fisher and Groslimond, 6-4, 7-6,
the second time in three matches
this year that the UCLA stars have
beaten the Cardinal top team.
At second doubles, Mayer and
Whitlinger got the Cards' only
doubles win of the weekend,
beating Krulevitz and Segars, 7-6,
6-4. However, Stanford lost at
third doubles, the
newly-organized team of Delaney
and DuPre being beaten by the
experienced team of Mott and
Teacher, 7-6, 6-4.
The most apparent result of
the weekend's matches was that
Stanford needs more doubles
work if it is to beat USC out for
the Pac-8 title, which will be held
at the Trojans' new stadium in
May.
A hopeful sign for the
Cardinals was the play of both
Delaney, who had little trouble
and may just compete for the
NCAA singles title, DuPre, who
seemed to be undermatched at
sixth singles after having lost his
fifth singles spot during recent
challenge matches.

Bruce Robertson over the weekend, and he responded to the challenge
by finishing third in the University of Pacific Invitational. Pettinger
shot 74-71 at UOP, and also helped the Cards to a 50-4 victory over
Cal Saturday at the Stanford course.
The hopes of the Stanford
tennis team for its first NCAA
outdoor championship were
thrown abruptly off stride by
USC and UCLA over the
weekend. USC shocked the
Cardinals 6-3 on Friday, while
UCLA edged them 5-4 Saturday
in Los Angeles.
The losses, which put the
Cards' season record at 7-2, can be
avenged in two weeks when the
Los Angeles powers come to
Stanford, but nevertheless
indicate that the nation's three
best collegiate tennis teams are all
very close in ability.
The loss to USC Friday before
a huge crowd in the Trojans' new
David X. Marks tennis stadium,
was particularly jolting, as it had
been believed that the Trojans
were weaker in hard competition
than either Stanford or UCLA.
Mexican Davis Cupper Raul
Ramirez, USC's top man, was
particularly impressive in beating
Stanford's best player, Sandy
Mayer, 4-6, 7-6, 6-3.
At fourth singles India's Sashi
Menon topped Gery Groslimond
7-6, 6-1, while at fifth singles
John Holladay topped John
Whitlinger, 6-1, 7-5.

Stanford got its three wins at
the other singles slots. Jim
Delaney topped John Andrews
6-4, 6-4 at second singles, while at
third singles, Rick Fisher downed
Mike Machette 6-3, 7-6. At the
sixth and final singles position,
Pat DuPre beat Mike Wayman 6-4,
6-0.
Thus this match was even going
into the doubles, but the Trojans,
in marked contrast to the
National Indoor Toumey in
Madison, overwhelmed Stanford
here.
At first doubles, Ramirez and
Menon topped Rick Fisher and
Groslimond 7-5, 4-6, 6-3. At
second doubles, Andrews and
Machette beat Mayer and
Whitlinger 6-3, 6-3. And at third
doubles, Holladay and Dave
Borelli made the sweep complete
by edging Chip Fisher and
Delaney, 1-6, 6-4, 7-6.
Depressing Defeat
The loss to UCLA the next day
was not quite as unexpected, but
was nonetheless depressing, since
Stanford actually won more sets
than the Bruins, taking 11 to their
opponents 10. All four Stanford
winners won in straight sets, while
three of the five Bruin victors
were extended to three sets.

Stanford won the top two
matches, Mayer beating Jeff
Austin 6-4, 7-6 and Delaney
topping Kreiss, 7-6, 6-3.

David X. Marks tennis stadium,
was particularly jolting, as it had
been believed that the Trojans
were weaker in hard competition
than either Stanford or UCLA.
Mexican Davis Cupper Raul
Ramirez, USC's top man, was
particularly impressive in beating
Stanford's best player, Sandy
Mayer, 4-6, 7-6, 6-3.
At fourth singles India's Sashi
Menon topped Gery Groslimond
7-6, 6-1, while at fifth singles
John Holladay topped John
Whitlinger, 6-1, 7-5.

Stanford got its three wins at
the other singles slots. Jim
Delaney topped John Andrews
6-4, 6-4 at second singles, while at
third singles, Rick Fisher downed
Mike Machette 6-3, 7-6. At the
sixth and final singles position,
Pat DuPre beat Mike Wayman 6-4,
6-0.
Thus this match was even going
into the doubles, but the Trojans,
in marked contrast to the
National Indoor Toumey in
Madison, overwhelmed Stanford
here.
At first doubles, Ramirez and
Menon topped Rick Fisher and
Groslimond 7-5, 4-6, 6-3. At
second doubles, Andrews and
Machette beat Mayer and
Whitlinger 6-3, 6-3. And at third
doubles, Holladay and Dave
Borelli made the sweep complete
by edging Chip Fisher and
Delaney, 1-6, 6-4, 7-6.
Depressing Defeat
The loss to UCLA the next day
was not quite as unexpected, but
was nonetheless depressing, since
Stanford actually won more sets
than the Bruins, taking 11 to their
opponents 10. All four Stanford
winners won in straight sets, while
three of the five Bruin victors
were extended to three sets.

Stanford won the top two
matches, Mayer beating Jeff
Austin 6-4, 7-6 and Delaney
topping Kreiss, 7-6, 6-3.
UCLA came on to win at the
next three positions, Steve
Krulevitz setting the tone by
upsetting Rick Fisher 6-4, 6-7, 6-4
at third singles. At fourth singles,
Rayno Segars dealt Groslimond
his second consecutive loss, 2-6,
6-3, 7-5.
At fifth singles Whitlinger also
lost his second straight after seven
consecutive wins, losing to Brian
Teacher, 3-6, 6-2, 6-2. At sixth
singles, Pat DuPre, once again won
in straight sets, this time over
Steve Mott, 6-2, 6-4.
Doubles Disaster
Once again, it was all tied going
into the doubles matches. And
once again, the Cardinals lost the
match here.
Austin and Kreiss topped Rick
Fisher and Groslimond, 6-4, 7-6,
the second time in three matches
this year that the UCLA stars have
beaten the Cardinal top team.
At second doubles, Mayer and
Whitlinger got the Cards' only
doubles win of the weekend,
beating Krulevitz and Segars, 7-6,
6-4. However, Stanford lost at
third doubles, the
newly-organized team of Delaney
and DuPre being beaten by the
experienced team of Mott and
Teacher, 7-6, 6-4.
The most apparent result of
the weekend's matches was that
Stanford needs more doubles
work if it is to beat USC out for
the Pac-8 title, which will be held
at the Trojans' new stadium in
May.
A hopeful sign for the
Cardinals was the play of both
Delaney, who had little trouble
and may just compete for the
NCAA singles title, DuPre, who
seemed to be undermatched at
sixth singles after having lost his
fifth singles spot during recent
challenge matches.

SUPERSUB — Sophomore George Pettinger filled in for ineligible
Bruce Robertson over the weekend, and he responded to the challenge
by finishing third in the University of Pacific Invitational. Pettinger
shot 74-71 at UOP, and also helped the Cards to a 50-4 victory over
Cal Saturday at the Stanford course.
