# Cards Third At UOP
## Humorous Alibis Save Golf Weekend 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
Alibis have always been as
much a part of athletic events as
hot dogs and cheerleaders. Losers
complain, grumble, and whine,
and often these post-game
mutterings can be as entertaining
as the game itself.
Saturday afternoon the golf
team was a perfect example of
this sporting phenomenon.
Relaxing after an easy 50-4
victory over California, the golfers

assembled in the Stanford
clubhouse and began to reflect on
the previous day's disappointing
third place finish at the University
of Pacific Invitational.
The Cards finished six strokes
behind tournament winner Fresno
State in the 36 hole, nine-team
event, and three shots behind
runnerup San Jose State,
Stanford's opponent ■ this
afternoon in a 1 p.m. dual match
at San Jose Country Club.
"You won't believe this,"
began Dave Baskins in the first of
several unbelievable stories, "but
yesterday morning before the
tournament we had to eat
breakfast at the Gait, California
bus depot."
'Dirt Trade'
And after their gourmet meal,
the golfers drove to Dry Creek
Golf Course, a 6400 yard, par 72
layout they unanimously
condemned as a "dirt track." (Aly
Trompas reportedly had even
harsher words for the course
during his rounds.)
Bob Chapman was so disgusted
with his putting after hitting 32 of
36 greens in regulation but only
shooting 78-75, he spoke with
bitter sarcasm about the condition
of the Dry Creek greens. "I don't
mind playing temporary greens,"
he said, "but not for 36 holes."
Perhaps the most frustrated
Cardinal golfer was Denny Colvin,
who spent much of his afternoon
at Dry Creek wading in a wet
river. On the 15th hole of the
morning round, Colvin threw his
driver in disgust after a poor tee
shot. The club caught on his
glove, however, and instead of
landing down the fairway, wound
up floating down an adjacent
river.

Undaunted, Colvin took off all
his clothes, jumped into the river,
retrieved his driver, and eventually
parred the hole.
But Colvin wasn't finished. On
the 18th hole of the final round,
he thought he hit his shot onto a
sandbar in the river. This time he
stripped down to the waist (there
was a considerable gallery
surrounding the 18th hole which
prevented him from repeating his
earlier performance) and waded
out to the sandbar.
His ball wasn't there, but he
later found it in the rough and
putted out on the 18th green clad
only in a pair of soaking-wet golf
pants. He bogeyed the hole, a feat
Colvin called "one of the best
fives I've ever made."
Pettinger Plays Well
Aside from all the clowning
around, there was some serious
golf played at UOP, especially by
sophomore George Pettinger.
Pettinger was playing in his first
major varsity tournament, and
was only in the lineup because
Bruce Robertson lost his amateur
status last Monday.
"George had more pressure on
him than anyone in the field,"
said Stanford coach Bud Finger,
"but even with all the pressure on
him he led our team and almost
won the tournament."
Pettinger finished third in a
field of 54 individuals, firing
rounds of 74-71 for a one over par
145 total. And if it wasn't for a
tee shot that sailed out of bounds
on the 16th hole of the first
round, he would have tied San
Jose State's Mark Lye for the
individual title at 143.
Conrad Nilmeier also turned in
an outstanding individual
performance, shooting 74-72 for a

146 total and fifth place.
Stanford's other scores were:
Colvin (72-77), Trompas (75-75),
Chapman (78-75), and Baskins
(79-75).
101 Shot Margin
As a team the Cards' third
place finish was disappointing, but
Stanford finished weli ahead of
the remaining six teams, including
a 101 shot margin over Stanislaus
State, possibly one of the worst
collegiate golf teams ever
assembled.
Saturday the Cards had an
easier time at the Stanford course,
romping past an outmanned
California team, 50-4. Colvin led
the way with an even par 71,
Baskins shot 73, Trompas fired
74, Pettinger and Chapman each
shot 76, and Nilmeier added a 77.
This afternoon the Cards will
get a chance to improve their 3-1
dual match record against San
Jose State, a team which always
gives Stanford trouble. When
Saturday afternoon's discussion
turned to today's meeting with
the Spartans, the golfers were
suddenly serious again. "It always
means a lot to beat San Jose,"
said Baskins.
Who knows, maybe tomorrow
morning the Spartans will be
making excuses.

Golf Course, a 6400 yard, par 72
layout they unanimously
condemned as a "dirt track." (Aly
Trompas reportedly had even
harsher words for the course
during his rounds.)
Bob Chapman was so disgusted
with his putting after hitting 32 of
36 greens in regulation but only
shooting 78-75, he spoke with
bitter sarcasm about the condition
of the Dry Creek greens. "I don't
mind playing temporary greens,"
he said, "but not for 36 holes."
Perhaps the most frustrated
Cardinal golfer was Denny Colvin,
who spent much of his afternoon
at Dry Creek wading in a wet
river. On the 15th hole of the
morning round, Colvin threw his
driver in disgust after a poor tee
shot. The club caught on his
glove, however, and instead of
landing down the fairway, wound
up floating down an adjacent
river.

Undaunted, Colvin took off all
his clothes, jumped into the river,
retrieved his driver, and eventually
parred the hole.
But Colvin wasn't finished. On
the 18th hole of the final round,
he thought he hit his shot onto a
sandbar in the river. This time he
stripped down to the waist (there
was a considerable gallery
surrounding the 18th hole which
prevented him from repeating his
earlier performance) and waded
out to the sandbar.
His ball wasn't there, but he
later found it in the rough and
putted out on the 18th green clad
only in a pair of soaking-wet golf
pants. He bogeyed the hole, a feat
Colvin called "one of the best
fives I've ever made."
Pettinger Plays Well
Aside from all the clowning
around, there was some serious
golf played at UOP, especially by
sophomore George Pettinger.
Pettinger was playing in his first
major varsity tournament, and
was only in the lineup because
Bruce Robertson lost his amateur
status last Monday.
"George had more pressure on
him than anyone in the field,"
said Stanford coach Bud Finger,
"but even with all the pressure on
him he led our team and almost
won the tournament."
Pettinger finished third in a
field of 54 individuals, firing
rounds of 74-71 for a one over par
145 total. And if it wasn't for a
tee shot that sailed out of bounds
on the 16th hole of the first
round, he would have tied San
Jose State's Mark Lye for the
individual title at 143.
Conrad Nilmeier also turned in
an outstanding individual
performance, shooting 74-72 for a

146 total and fifth place.
Stanford's other scores were:
Colvin (72-77), Trompas (75-75),
Chapman (78-75), and Baskins
(79-75).
101 Shot Margin
As a team the Cards' third
place finish was disappointing, but
Stanford finished weli ahead of
the remaining six teams, including
a 101 shot margin over Stanislaus
State, possibly one of the worst
collegiate golf teams ever
assembled.
Saturday the Cards had an
easier time at the Stanford course,
romping past an outmanned
California team, 50-4. Colvin led
the way with an even par 71,
Baskins shot 73, Trompas fired
74, Pettinger and Chapman each
shot 76, and Nilmeier added a 77.
This afternoon the Cards will
get a chance to improve their 3-1
dual match record against San
Jose State, a team which always
gives Stanford trouble. When
Saturday afternoon's discussion
turned to today's meeting with
the Spartans, the golfers were
suddenly serious again. "It always
means a lot to beat San Jose,"
said Baskins.
Who knows, maybe tomorrow
morning the Spartans will be
making excuses.
Alibis have always been as
much a part of athletic events as
hot dogs and cheerleaders. Losers
complain, grumble, and whine,
and often these post-game
mutterings can be as entertaining
as the game itself.
Saturday afternoon the golf
team was a perfect example of
this sporting phenomenon.
Relaxing after an easy 50-4
victory over California, the golfers

assembled in the Stanford
clubhouse and began to reflect on
the previous day's disappointing
third place finish at the University
of Pacific Invitational.
The Cards finished six strokes
behind tournament winner Fresno
State in the 36 hole, nine-team
event, and three shots behind
runnerup San Jose State,
Stanford's opponent ■ this
afternoon in a 1 p.m. dual match
at San Jose Country Club.
"You won't believe this,"
began Dave Baskins in the first of
several unbelievable stories, "but
yesterday morning before the
tournament we had to eat
breakfast at the Gait, California
bus depot."

he thought he hit his shot onto a
sandbar in the river. This time he
stripped down to the waist (there
was a considerable gallery
surrounding the 18th hole which
prevented him from repeating his
earlier performance) and waded
out to the sandbar.
His ball wasn't there, but he
later found it in the rough and
putted out on the 18th green clad
only in a pair of soaking-wet golf
pants. He bogeyed the hole, a feat
Colvin called "one of the best
fives I've ever made."
Pettinger Plays Well
Aside from all the clowning
around, there was some serious
golf played at UOP, especially by
sophomore George Pettinger.
Pettinger was playing in his first
major varsity tournament, and
was only in the lineup because
Bruce Robertson lost his amateur
status last Monday.
"George had more pressure on
him than anyone in the field,"
said Stanford coach Bud Finger,
"but even with all the pressure on
him he led our team and almost
won the tournament."
Pettinger finished third in a
field of 54 individuals, firing
rounds of 74-71 for a one over par
145 total. And if it wasn't for a
tee shot that sailed out of bounds
on the 16th hole of the first
round, he would have tied San
Jose State's Mark Lye for the
individual title at 143.
Conrad Nilmeier also turned in
an outstanding individual
performance, shooting 74-72 for a

146 total and fifth place.
Stanford's other scores were:
Colvin (72-77), Trompas (75-75),
Chapman (78-75), and Baskins
(79-75).
101 Shot Margin
As a team the Cards' third
place finish was disappointing, but
Stanford finished weli ahead of
the remaining six teams, including
a 101 shot margin over Stanislaus
State, possibly one of the worst
collegiate golf teams ever
assembled.
Saturday the Cards had an
easier time at the Stanford course,
romping past an outmanned
California team, 50-4. Colvin led
the way with an even par 71,
Baskins shot 73, Trompas fired
74, Pettinger and Chapman each
shot 76, and Nilmeier added a 77.
This afternoon the Cards will
get a chance to improve their 3-1
dual match record against San
Jose State, a team which always
gives Stanford trouble. When
Saturday afternoon's discussion
turned to today's meeting with
the Spartans, the golfers were
suddenly serious again. "It always
means a lot to beat San Jose,"
said Baskins.
Who knows, maybe tomorrow
morning the Spartans will be
making excuses.
Alibis have always been as
much a part of athletic events as
hot dogs and cheerleaders. Losers
complain, grumble, and whine,
and often these post-game
mutterings can be as entertaining
as the game itself.
Saturday afternoon the golf
team was a perfect example of
this sporting phenomenon.
Relaxing after an easy 50-4
victory over California, the golfers

assembled in the Stanford
clubhouse and began to reflect on
the previous day's disappointing
third place finish at the University
of Pacific Invitational.
The Cards finished six strokes
behind tournament winner Fresno
State in the 36 hole, nine-team
event, and three shots behind
runnerup San Jose State,
Stanford's opponent ■ this
afternoon in a 1 p.m. dual match
at San Jose Country Club.
"You won't believe this,"
began Dave Baskins in the first of
several unbelievable stories, "but
yesterday morning before the
tournament we had to eat
breakfast at the Gait, California
bus depot."
'Dirt Trade'
And after their gourmet meal,
the golfers drove to Dry Creek
Golf Course, a 6400 yard, par 72
layout they unanimously
condemned as a "dirt track." (Aly
Trompas reportedly had even
harsher words for the course
during his rounds.)
Bob Chapman was so disgusted
with his putting after hitting 32 of
36 greens in regulation but only
shooting 78-75, he spoke with
bitter sarcasm about the condition
of the Dry Creek greens. "I don't
mind playing temporary greens,"
he said, "but not for 36 holes."
Perhaps the most frustrated
Cardinal golfer was Denny Colvin,
who spent much of his afternoon
at Dry Creek wading in a wet
river. On the 15th hole of the
morning round, Colvin threw his
driver in disgust after a poor tee
shot. The club caught on his
glove, however, and instead of
landing down the fairway, wound
up floating down an adjacent
river.

Undaunted, Colvin took off all
his clothes, jumped into the river,
retrieved his driver, and eventually
parred the hole.
But Colvin wasn't finished. On
the 18th hole of the final round,
he thought he hit his shot onto a
sandbar in the river. This time he
stripped down to the waist (there
was a considerable gallery
surrounding the 18th hole which
prevented him from repeating his
earlier performance) and waded
out to the sandbar.
His ball wasn't there, but he
later found it in the rough and
putted out on the 18th green clad
only in a pair of soaking-wet golf
pants. He bogeyed the hole, a feat
Colvin called "one of the best
fives I've ever made."
