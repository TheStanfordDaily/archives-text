# Bruins Romp Past Stanford Spikers
## 
### 
Stanford came closer to
beating UCLA's defending
national champion track team
than any team so far this year, but
the Cardinals still came out on the
short end of a 101-50 score at the
Los Angeles Coliseum.
Stanford won only three
events, but the Cards might have
won less if UCLA coach Jim Bush
hadn't withheld six of his top
performers "for strategic
reasons." Pole vaulter Francois
Tracanelli, who has a lifetime
best of 17-5, long jumper Finn
Bendixen, triple jumper Harry
Freeman, and both of the Bruins
best three-milers were on the
sidelines Saturday.
"Our kids have been competing
pretty steadily for some time,"
Bush said, "and we wanted to give
some of them a rest for that very
tough meet next week." (UCLA
will face Oregon next Saturday.)
Mittlestaedt Wins
Stanford did have some
encouraging results, especially the
Cards 1-2 finish in the mile. Brian
Mittlestaedt and Les McFadden
both ran lifetime bests in that
event, with Mittlestaedt winning
in 4:04.9 and McFadden
recording a 4:05.7 clocking.
Ken Curl won the 220 in 21.7,
and Mark McConnell won the
three mile in 13:59.2 (a personal
best) with freshman teammate
Tony Sandoval second at 14:06.4.
"Actually we had a very good
day," said Stanford coach Pay ton
Jordan. "Our goal was to keep
UCLA under 100 and we almost
did that. Our second goal was to
score more points than Kansas
and Tennessee (the two teams
who were previously closest to the
Bruins) and we accomplished that
goal."
Pac-8 Tough
Jordan explained that despite
the lopsided defeat, Stanford still
has one of the nation's top track
teams. "People think that when
we lose to Pac-8 teams, we can't
win anywhere," he said, "but
actually there are only three
teams in the country (University
of Texas at El Paso, Kansas, and
Tennessee) that can compete with
any of the top teams in the
Pac-8."

The veteran Stanford coach
was especially pleased with the
performances of his three
freshmen and three junior college
transfers. Freshman Terry
Albritton finished second in the
shot put with a toss of 59-7*4,
Sandoval placed second in the
three mile, and Matt Hogsett
finished second in the 440
intermediate hurdles in 53.0,
running "an outstanding race,"
according to Jordan.
The three junior college
transfers were also impressive.
Vernell Jackson ran a lifetime best
of 1:53.3 in his second place 880
performance, McFadden's time in
the mile qualified him for the
Pac-8 championships, and Kenny
Kring scored in two individual
events (second in the pole vault
and third in the 440 hurdles),
besides running on two relay
teams in a busy afternoon for the
talented decathlete.
Other Scorers
Other point-scorers for
Stanford were Tom Anderson
(third in the long jump at 21-1),
Rick Larson (third in the javelin
at 200-4), Kurt Schoenrock
(second in the steeplechase at
9:13.3), Dick Day (third in the
steeplechase at 9:46.4), Dave
Bagshaw (third in the 120 high
hurdles at 14.5), John Anderson
(third in the 440 at 48.1), Jim
Howard (third in the discus at
167-5), and Rod Utley (second in
the triple jump at 49-1).
On the UCLA side, some of the
highlights were Rick Fletcher's
7-0 high jump, James McAllister's
25-B'/4 long jump, Rory Kotinek's
216-6 javelin toss, Charles Rich's
record-equalling 13.9 in the 120
high hurdles, Roger Freberg's
187-3 discus throw, Anthony
Veney's 1:51.3 half mile, and
Milan Tiff's 52-3 triple jump.
In the other half of the double
dual meet, USC defeated
California 91-54. In unofficial
tabulations, the Trojans would
have defeated the depleted Bruin
team 90-54 if UCLA and USC had
been competing.
The Cardinals will now take a
week off before tangling with
USC in another double dual meet,
this time at Berkeley on April 21.
