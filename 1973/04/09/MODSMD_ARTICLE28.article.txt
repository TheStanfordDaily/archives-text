# Lose Two Of Three To UCLA
## Baseball Team Stumbles Down South 
### SCOTT DAILEY 
Dropping two out of three games to
UCLA, the Cardinals stumbled into the 1973
Pacific-Eight baseball season over the
weekend.
Lefthander Bob DiPietro saw a two-run
lead vanish in the fourth inning Friday as the
Bruins scored three times and coasted to a 3-2
victory. Saturday, the Cards earned a split in a
doubleheader, taking the first game, 7-3, and
losing the nightcap, 4-2.
The Cards' disappointing trip to the
Southland leaves them two-and-a-half games
behind conference-leading USC, who swept a
three-game set from Cal Friday and Saturday.
The top-ranked Trojans invade Sunken
Diamond for a 2:30 p.m. game this Friday
and a noon doubleheader on Saturday.
"It was discouraging to all of us," said
Coach Ray Young of his team's weekend
performances. "Nobody has given up, though,
and it's certainly not out of the realm of
possibility that we could sweep USC and be
out in front. So we're not out of it just
because we lost two out of three to UCLA.
'Veterans Died'
"Our problem is that our veterans have just
died in the vine with the bat?'; Young
continued. "Our young kids have been doing a
helluva job, but it si just been a complete

Hannaford didn't get a hit and Glen Johnson
didn't get a hit. Mark Lucich got a couple of
hits, but he's still not swinging the bat like he
should."
Lucich staked Stanford to a 2-0 lead in
Friday's game with a 380-foot blast to right in
the top of the fourth. Steve Davis, on base on
an error, scored in front of Lucich.
Losing pitcher Bob DiPietro surrendered
three runs to the Bruins in the bottom of the

fourth. Mark Evans singled, and DiPietro gave
up a base on balls to Bob Adams. After an
infield groundout moved Evans and Adams to
second and third, Tim Doerr cracked a single
up the middle, tying the score at two apiece.
Costly Error
DiPietro walked second baseman Chris
Kinder, moving Doerr to second. Doerr,
determined to score a run himself after
knocking in two others, stole third and
scrambled home when catcher Bob Reece's
throw sailed into leftfieid.
After that, Bruin pitcher Bob Thomas gave
up just a fifth inning single to Kim Hannaford,
picking up his fourth win against one defeat.
DiPietro, who struck out six and walked
three, slipped to 3-1 on the year.
Dan Shaw won his first Pac-8 start on
Saturday, setting UCLA down on four hits in
a 7-3 Cardinal win. Stanford took a 2-1 lead
into the fourth, when they scored four runs
on three hits and an error. Bob Hampton
contributed his second home run of the year
to the Stanford victory.
In the second game, Ken Grolle was sailing
along with a 2-0 lead when Adams crashed a
two-run homer in the bottom of the sixth,
sparking a three-run Bruin uprising. UCLA
added a run in the eighth off Nick Peterson to
put away the 4-2 victory.

The Cards' disappointing trip to the
Southland leaves them two-and-a-half games
behind conference-leading USC, who swept a
three-game set from Cal Friday and Saturday.
The top-ranked Trojans invade Sunken
Diamond for a 2:30 p.m. game this Friday
and a noon doubleheader on Saturday.
"It was discouraging to all of us," said
Coach Ray Young of his team's weekend
performances. "Nobody has given up, though,
and it's certainly not out of the realm of
possibility that we could sweep USC and be
out in front. So we're not out of it just
because we lost two out of three to UCLA.
'Veterans Died'
"Our problem is that our veterans have just
died in the vine with the bat?'; Young
continued. "Our young kids have been doing a
helluva job, but it si just been a complete

Hannaford didn't get a hit and Glen Johnson
didn't get a hit. Mark Lucich got a couple of
hits, but he's still not swinging the bat like he
should."
Lucich staked Stanford to a 2-0 lead in
Friday's game with a 380-foot blast to right in
the top of the fourth. Steve Davis, on base on
an error, scored in front of Lucich.
Losing pitcher Bob DiPietro surrendered
three runs to the Bruins in the bottom of the

fourth. Mark Evans singled, and DiPietro gave
up a base on balls to Bob Adams. After an
infield groundout moved Evans and Adams to
second and third, Tim Doerr cracked a single
up the middle, tying the score at two apiece.
Costly Error
DiPietro walked second baseman Chris
Kinder, moving Doerr to second. Doerr,
determined to score a run himself after
knocking in two others, stole third and
scrambled home when catcher Bob Reece's
throw sailed into leftfieid.
After that, Bruin pitcher Bob Thomas gave
up just a fifth inning single to Kim Hannaford,
picking up his fourth win against one defeat.
DiPietro, who struck out six and walked
three, slipped to 3-1 on the year.
Dan Shaw won his first Pac-8 start on
Saturday, setting UCLA down on four hits in
a 7-3 Cardinal win. Stanford took a 2-1 lead
into the fourth, when they scored four runs
on three hits and an error. Bob Hampton
contributed his second home run of the year
to the Stanford victory.
In the second game, Ken Grolle was sailing
along with a 2-0 lead when Adams crashed a
two-run homer in the bottom of the sixth,
sparking a three-run Bruin uprising. UCLA
added a run in the eighth off Nick Peterson to
put away the 4-2 victory.
Dropping two out of three games to
UCLA, the Cardinals stumbled into the 1973
Pacific-Eight baseball season over the
weekend.
Lefthander Bob DiPietro saw a two-run
lead vanish in the fourth inning Friday as the
Bruins scored three times and coasted to a 3-2
victory. Saturday, the Cards earned a split in a
doubleheader, taking the first game, 7-3, and
losing the nightcap, 4-2.
