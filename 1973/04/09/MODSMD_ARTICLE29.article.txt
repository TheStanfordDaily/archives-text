# Marcy Fourth In Side Horse
## Hug Ties For NCAA All-Around Title 
### PHIL HUBBARD 
The Stanford gymnastics team
completed its 1973 season this weekend at
the NCAA gymnastics championships in
Eugene Oregon. Steve Hug tied for first in
the all-around competition and Ted Marcy
took fourth for the Cards in his event, the
side horse.
In the preliminaries held Thursday,
Shawn Skerrett failed to qualify in the
vault. Howard Bessen, who took sixth in
the NCAA in the rings last year, also
missed making the finals. Coach Sadao
Hamada said that Bessen scored several
tenths of a point lower in the compulsories
than he usually did, and this made it very
difficult to make up the difference in the
optionals.
Hug tied for first in the all-around with

Marshall Abanea, as both scored 110.05.
Hug had beaten Albanea the year before in
the Olympic trials.
Wins Parallel Bars
In taking his share of the all-around
title, Hug scored his only uncontested
victory in the parallel bars, an event he also
won the week before in the Pac-8
championships.
Along with his parallel bars victory, he
also took second in the high bar. He
completed his winning total with good
places in the other events, including a fifth
in the vault.
Marcy, who took fourth place in the
side horse for the Cards, was leading with a
9.55 after the compulsories. In the finals,
however, he missed a part of his routine
and fell to below a 9.0 for that half of the

score. Only a freshman this year, however,
Marcy still has three more shots at the
NCAA title.
The winner of the team championships
was lowa State. The previous year's
champs, Southern Illinois, failed to place.
Cal, the Pac-8 representative, also failed to
make the top three as Penn State took
second and Indiana State third.
The Cyclones finished with 325.150
points, Penn State accumulated a 323.025
total, and Indiana State's third place score
was 321.650.
Third In Conference
Although the Cards finished the season
with only a 4-2 dual meet record, they
managed to take third in the conference.
Under a new coach, Sadao Hamada, the
team fought its way to serious contention

for the Pac-8 title, before the loss of Bob
Anderson and an injury to Ted Miyamoto
dashed any title hopes for this season.
Hamada feels he has learned a lot this
year, and although a little disappointed at
missing a shot at the national
championships, feels the team may have a
chance again next year. "We tried very
hard but didn't make it. Competition was
much, much harder than last year's level.
The future is what counts now."
Since nobody is graduating from this
season's squad, next year's should be
stronger than ever. Hamada feels there is a
chance he may get one or two freshman
stars next season, and with the addition of
them, the Cards should once again be in
contention for the conference title in
1974.

9.55 after the compulsories. In the finals,
however, he missed a part of his routine
and fell to below a 9.0 for that half of the

score. Only a freshman this year, however,
Marcy still has three more shots at the
NCAA title.
The winner of the team championships
was lowa State. The previous year's
champs, Southern Illinois, failed to place.
Cal, the Pac-8 representative, also failed to
make the top three as Penn State took
second and Indiana State third.
The Cyclones finished with 325.150
points, Penn State accumulated a 323.025
total, and Indiana State's third place score
was 321.650.
Third In Conference
Although the Cards finished the season
with only a 4-2 dual meet record, they
managed to take third in the conference.
Under a new coach, Sadao Hamada, the
team fought its way to serious contention

for the Pac-8 title, before the loss of Bob
Anderson and an injury to Ted Miyamoto
dashed any title hopes for this season.
Hamada feels he has learned a lot this
year, and although a little disappointed at
missing a shot at the national
championships, feels the team may have a
chance again next year. "We tried very
hard but didn't make it. Competition was
much, much harder than last year's level.
The future is what counts now."
Since nobody is graduating from this
season's squad, next year's should be
stronger than ever. Hamada feels there is a
chance he may get one or two freshman
stars next season, and with the addition of
them, the Cards should once again be in
contention for the conference title in
1974.
The Stanford gymnastics team
completed its 1973 season this weekend at
the NCAA gymnastics championships in
Eugene Oregon. Steve Hug tied for first in
the all-around competition and Ted Marcy
took fourth for the Cards in his event, the
side horse.
In the preliminaries held Thursday,
Shawn Skerrett failed to qualify in the
vault. Howard Bessen, who took sixth in
the NCAA in the rings last year, also
missed making the finals. Coach Sadao
Hamada said that Bessen scored several
tenths of a point lower in the compulsories
than he usually did, and this made it very
difficult to make up the difference in the
optionals.
Hug tied for first in the all-around with

Marshall Abanea, as both scored 110.05.
Hug had beaten Albanea the year before in
the Olympic trials.
Wins Parallel Bars
In taking his share of the all-around
title, Hug scored his only uncontested
victory in the parallel bars, an event he also
won the week before in the Pac-8
championships.
Along with his parallel bars victory, he
also took second in the high bar. He
completed his winning total with good
places in the other events, including a fifth
in the vault.
Marcy, who took fourth place in the
side horse for the Cards, was leading with a
9.55 after the compulsories. In the finals,
