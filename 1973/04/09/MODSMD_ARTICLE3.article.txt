# Rehnquist Presides Over Moot Court Here
## 
### KEVIN SMITH 
Assoc. Justice William Rehnquist of
the United States Supreme Court
headed a panel of three judges
presiding over the 21st annual Marion
Rice Kirkwood Moot Court
competition Saturday. The event,
sponsored by the Law School's Moot
Court Board, drew a capacity audience
of 350 people to the Annenberg
Auditorium in the Cummings Art
Building.
The other members of the panel
were Judge Ben C. Duniway of the
U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals
and Walter Craig of the U.S. District
Court in Arizona. All three panelists
are Law School alumni.
Saturday's proceedings represented
the final round of the Moot Court
competition, which presents
hypothetical cases to be argued before
distinguished legal figures.
Surprisingly, all four finalists who
argued before the Moot Court
Saturday were first year law students.
The duty of the judges was not to
decide the merits of the fictitious case,
but rather to present four awards to
the contestants who prepared written
briefs and made oral arguments.
Stuart Baskin won the prize for
best written brief. Lisalee Anne Wells

won for best oral presentation. Wells
also received the first prize for a
combination of oral and written
presentations while Baskin received
second prize. The other contestants
were Laura Stern and Scott Sugarman.
Explanation Of Case
The hypothetical case dealt with
the conviction of a newspaper
publisher who was given secret
information by an assistant U.S.
attorney in relation to a government
wiretapping operation. The attorney
then had misgivings about leaking the
information, and the publisher was
subsequently warned not to print the
information by the attorney's
superior.
The publisher printed the story in
his paper anyway and was convicted
under a real federal statute which
prohibits someone from stealing a
"thing of value" from the United
States, or from receiving such a "thing
of value" once it is stolen "with intent
to convert it to his own use or gain."
This same statute is currently in
question in the Pentagon Papers trial
of Daniel Ellsberg and Anthony Russo.
The two main issues raised in the
fictitious case concerned whether the
leaked information could be called a
"thing of value" and whether

punishing the publisher for printing
this information violated the First
Amendment right to freedom of the
press.
High Quality Presentations
Each contestant was permitted to
speak for 25 minutes. All three judges
constantly bombarded the contestants
with questions, most of which came
from Duniway.
After announcing the awards made
by the Court, Rehnquist called the
briefs and arguments of all four
participants "of extraordinary high
quality," and said he voted for Wells'
oral presentation because she
"comported" herself well.
Duniway said he was "absolutely
astonished" that all four contestants
were only first year law students. He
called the briefs and arguments "far
better than the average briefs and
arguments that we get from
professional attorneys."
There were no attempts at

disruption to protest Rehnquist's
appearance, although the Stanford
Chapter of the National Lawyers Guild
passed out literature condemning
Rehnquist.
One handout claimed that
Rehnquist "has carried his political
philosophy and his Nixon loyalties to
the bench, often at the expense of
legal precedent and basic human and
Constitutional rights."
Dave Schissel, a third year law
student, said that one reason for the
absence of protest was that one law
student, Mick Goldstein, is coming up
before Judge Craig in connection with
the Chino escape-murder case, and
that a demonstration might have
antagonized Craig.
The Moot Court was followed by a
reception at the Old Museum and a
banquet at the Faculty Club. All three
judges plus E.J. Majesky of the
American College of Trial Lawyers
addressed the banquet.
