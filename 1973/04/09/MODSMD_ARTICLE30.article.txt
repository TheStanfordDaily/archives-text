# Lacrosse Team Overwhelms Marin For Fourth Victory
## 
### 
Behind an eight goal performance by Butch Hazlett, the Stanford
lacrosse team met, wore down, and then demolished an undermanned
Marin Lacrosse Club 22-4 Saturday on Stanford's rugby field.
Things started poorly and then got worse for the visitors. Unable to
post the regulation number of men at the scheduled 1 p.m. face off,
Marin received a delay of the game penalty when they finally
mustered 10 men a half hour later.
Attackman Buz Haddow put the Cards in front minutes later with
the first of his five goals. Marin fought back to tie the score 1-1 when
Rick Meany, Marin's most aggressive player, scored unassisted.
Although Haddow, Dave Sampson, and Hazlett each added another
tally for Stanford, the first quarter ended with Stanford in the lead
4-1, but Marin was still in the game.
For all the time Stanford spent in Marin's defensive zone, however,
one had the impression the Cards should have gotten off more shots.
For the quarter, Stanford took nine shots to Marin's five.
The second quarter was Marin's undoing. Within 30 seconds
following the faceoff, Paul Yeuell rushed to the right 15 yards out,
rolled to his left around Marin's defensemen, and scored unassisted for
Stanford's fifth goal. Tom Headly and Haddow added a goal apiece in
the following two minutes as Marin began to crumble.
Hazlett ignited the rout with four more goals late in the first half.
Going into the second half Stanford led 12-3 and with eight men
scoring, the Cards went on to win 22-4, improving their season record
to 4-2.

A LULL IN THE ACTION — There seems to be a lot going on in the
pictures above and above right, but something is definitely wrong
below. The lacrosse players kneeling on the ground are looking for
Butch Hazlett's contact lens. Hazlett eventually found his lens, as well
as scoring eight goals in Stanford's 22-4 victory over Marin Lacrosse
Club.
