Pablo Picasso Dies
MOUGINS, France — Pablo Picasso, the greatest artist of
his time and a giant in the history of painting, died
yesterday. He was working to add to his prolific output
until a few hours before his death.
The 91-year-old artist died soon after awakening at his
home in the hills overlooking the Mediterranean. He had
dined with friends Saturday night and was reported to
have been the gayest member of the party, eating heartily
and telling stories. After the friends left at around 11:30
p.m., Picasso went to his studio to work.
The painter's wife, Jacqueline, called a physician
yesterday morning. By the time Dr. Georges Ranee arrived
10 minutes later at 11:40 a.m., Picasso was dead.
The Spanish-born painter, who provoked several
revolutions in modern art, had been working regularly and
vigorously in recent weeks despite a series of attacks of
grippe during the winter, friends said. He recently had
made arrangements for a showing in Avignon of his
production in the past three years.
Death was attributed to a heart attack that followed a
pulmonary edema, or a collection of fluid in the lungs.
Picasso was stricken as he awakened and died in his
bedroom, a member of the household said. At his side
were the drawing crayons that he always took with him
when he retired, so he could sketch during the night if he
were unable to sleep.
Among the most famous of Picasso's paintings was
"Les Demoiselles D'Avignon," an eight-foot square
tableau of five nude women that announced the arrival of
cubism. Another was his violent antiwar protest
"Guernica," painted after German bombers destroyed the
town of Guernica during the Spanish civil war.
Deformed, horror-ridden faces, broken bodies of
humans and animals and screaming protest of violence
make up the myriad parts of the giant canvas.
Picasso himself was the greatest collector of his own
work. He has kept thousands of paintings hoarded at his
home and workshop in Mougins.
The value of his holding cannot even be estimated.
Picasso was not only one of the most inventive painters
in history, but also one of the most productive.
Rough estimates put his output at 13,000-14,000
paintings or designs, 100,000 prints or engravings, 34,000
book illustrations, 300 sculptures or ceramics.
US-Indian Talks Hit Stalemate
Peace talks between White House representatives and
militant Indians reached a stalemate in Washington, D.C.,
yesterday as Indians in Wounded Knee, S.D., rejected
government urgings to lay down their arms.
"I don't think we can lay down our weapons here until
the government lives up totally to the agreement that was
signed," American Indian Movement leader Dennis Banks
said in a taped interview with a newsman at Wounded
Knee.
"After the conclusion of successful meetings in
Washington, AIM leader Russell Means will call us and
we'll lay down our weapons, not before," Banks declared.
Talks to lay the groundwork for implementation of an
agreement reached last Thursday to end the 40-day
occupation of Wounded Knee were scheduled Saturday
between Means and presidential aide Leonard Garment.
But those talks were postponed over what the
government said was noncompliance with a "verbal"

understanding made with the Indians.
The government contends Means promised to order his
followers to disarm themselves once the negotiations
between Garment and Means were underway in the
Capitol.
Means said no such understanding had been made and
that it was the government which "broke the spirit" of
the agreement by refusing to allow food and medical
teams into the village.
McCord May Implicate Mitchell
NEW YORK — Newsweek magazine quoted unnamed
sources yesterday that Watergate eavesdropper James W.
McCord is ready to tell the press soon that former Atty.
Gen. John Mitchell ordered the raid on Democratic
National Committee headquarters — and why.
Newsweek said that if McCord carries out his plan to
hold a news conference, he will say that the men who
recruited him to carry out the wiretapping in
Washington's Watergate complex — G. Gordon Liddy and
E. Howard Hunt — did so in part by dropping Mitchell's
name.
McCord will say, the magazine added, that he was told
Mitchell, then head of the Committee to Re-elect the
President, ordered the raid on the Democratic offices
because he was intrigued by some documents
photographed there while McCord was placing the bugs
during an earlier raid and wanted more such documents.
Mitchell has repeatedly denied having any part in the
bugging and burglary at Watergate, for which Liddy,
Hunt, McCord and four others have been convicted.
Newsweek said, however, that it had learned that
McCord will say he was told Mitchell cleared the plan
outlined to him by Liddy and approved the $300,000
budget for the spying operation.
POWs Rehearsed Return Speeches
WASHINGTON — American prisoners of war began
rehearsing patriotic homecoming speeches two years ago,
in a prison camp exercise some of them called "reverse
brainwashing."
By speaking out in patriotic fervor, the prisoners
sought to strengthen themselves against North Vietnamese
propaganda.
Some former POWs say this practice may account for
the similar patriotic tone and content of many speeches
and statements made at different times and places by
returned prisoners.
"The Communists spent upwards of four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine years trying to turn us against our
country, against our way of life, against America
basically," said Air Force Maj. Ronald J. Webb of
Hampton, Va. "And the natural reaction on the part of 99
percent of us was to build our patriotism even stronger."
"It made us ardent anti-Communists for the most part
and ultra-patriotic," said Webb, who spent five years as a
prisoner.
