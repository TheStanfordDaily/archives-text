# Provost Urges Re-Introduction Of Structure Into Curriculum
## 
### MARK SIMONIAN 
Provost William Miller, addressing
the Spring Quarter meeting of the
Academic Council Friday, urged the
faculty to re-examine the basic
curriculum for undergraduates to
foster "greater opportunity for
intellectual development" among
undergraduate students.
Miller lauded the development of
"extra opportunities that are so
important to undergraduates" such as
freshman seminars, the overseas
campuses program, undergraduate
research opportunities and
interdisciplinary curricula, but he
noted the need to re-introduce
structure into the basic curriculum.
"I am quite pleased to say that
several faculty are busily re-examining
additional aspects of the core
curriculum," Miller stated.
He cited the new freshman program
in history, an introductory course on
Medieval culture, a new three-quarter
course sequence on mutual cultural
influences among the Slavic peoples,
and a pilot program for freshmen
seeking to introduce science, social
sciences and humanities by focusing
on certain periods in history as the
"kind of intellectual ferment that will
keep us alive."
Miller also examined the problems
graduate schools will face during the
next few years in the University's
"steady state" — a period of
essentially no growth in faculty and
staff.
Less Ph.D. Enrollment?
The provost suggested that the
University broaden opportunities for
its Ph.D. candidates, but decrease
Ph.D. enrollment slightly. He indicated
in addition that the University may
need to shift to a larger masters
program.

Miller supported the
recommendation of the federal task
force on graduate education headed by
Director of University Relations Frank
Newman that graduate student aid be
allocated directly to the student.
Discussing faculty, Miller stressed
that "each and every appointment"
must "really count for the most. This
means that the faculty search
committees and the departmental
chairmen must continue to be
thorough in their searches and critical
in their examinations of appointments
and for promotions," he said.
Research Adds Vitality
He also encouraged faculty to
continue with "stimulating research

and teaching programs" to bring
vitality to the University.
The Provost stated that Stanford,
along with its sister institutions, will
continue to have a major battle with
cost rises for higher education. He told
the faculty, "We shall have to continue
to look for ways to economize and
present outstanding intellectual
offerings within the constraints of
tight budgets."

Provost William Miller, addressing
the Spring Quarter meeting of the
Academic Council Friday, urged the
faculty to re-examine the basic
curriculum for undergraduates to
foster "greater opportunity for
intellectual development" among
undergraduate students.
Miller lauded the development of
"extra opportunities that are so
important to undergraduates" such as
freshman seminars, the overseas
campuses program, undergraduate
research opportunities and
interdisciplinary curricula, but he
noted the need to re-introduce
structure into the basic curriculum.
"I am quite pleased to say that
several faculty are busily re-examining
additional aspects of the core
curriculum," Miller stated.
He cited the new freshman program
in history, an introductory course on
Medieval culture, a new three-quarter
course sequence on mutual cultural
influences among the Slavic peoples,
and a pilot program for freshmen
seeking to introduce science, social
sciences and humanities by focusing
on certain periods in history as the
"kind of intellectual ferment that will
keep us alive."
Miller also examined the problems
graduate schools will face during the
next few years in the University's
"steady state" — a period of
essentially no growth in faculty and
staff.
Less Ph.D. Enrollment?
The provost suggested that the
University broaden opportunities for
its Ph.D. candidates, but decrease
Ph.D. enrollment slightly. He indicated
in addition that the University may
need to shift to a larger masters
program.

Miller supported the
recommendation of the federal task
force on graduate education headed by
Director of University Relations Frank
Newman that graduate student aid be
allocated directly to the student.
Discussing faculty, Miller stressed
that "each and every appointment"
must "really count for the most. This
means that the faculty search
committees and the departmental
chairmen must continue to be
thorough in their searches and critical
in their examinations of appointments
and for promotions," he said.
Research Adds Vitality
He also encouraged faculty to
continue with "stimulating research

and teaching programs" to bring
vitality to the University.
The Provost stated that Stanford,
along with its sister institutions, will
continue to have a major battle with
cost rises for higher education. He told
the faculty, "We shall have to continue
to look for ways to economize and
present outstanding intellectual
offerings within the constraints of
tight budgets."
In other business, the Academic
Council heard from Faculty Senate
Chairman Mathematics Prof. Halsey
Royden and passed a memorial
resolution for the late Law Prof.
Herbert Packer.
