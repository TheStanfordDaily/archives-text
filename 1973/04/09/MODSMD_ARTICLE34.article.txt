# NO DATE SET FOR LABOR VOTE
## 
### 
No date has yet been set for the upcoming representation election for over
1600 University employees.
Representatives of the University, the United Stanford Employees, and the
Stanford Joint Council met Friday with an examiner for the National Labor
Relations Board. However, the three parties were unable to agree on whether
about 200 employees in a variety of job classifications should be included in the
bargaining unit.
Meetings will be held between the three groups in an effort to resolve the
dispute so that an election can be held before the end of the quarter.
Before the meeting Friday, the Stanford Joint Council consisting of the
American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees (AFSCME)
and the International Union of Operating Engineers, presented election
authorization statements signed by over 10 percent of the labor force, and thus
are full party to the upcoming election.
