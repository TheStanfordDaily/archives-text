# Campus Spring Cleaning Begins
## 
### JANET SANDERS 
Along with blue skies and sunshine,
spring brings the sometimes
burdensome task of cleaning.
Saturday, the Plant Service
Department took advantage of the
tradition and sponsored a massive
cleanup of White Plaza.
The week before, 140 contacts
from faculty, staff and students
pledged to bring friends to the
day-long event. To attract people,
Plant Services provided musical
entertainment by the Stanford Band

and cold beer.
"If we get enough people involved,
the work will become a joy and a
pleasure," said Plant Services Director
Dan DeYoung who hoped the cleanup
would establish a community sense of
pride in the campus' appearance.
Saturday, shifts of about 15 to 20
people scrubbed down the Claw
which, believe it or not, was once a
shining bronze. Students and faculty
chipped off the calcium caked on the
structure with steel brushes while
others painted the stone benches
surrounding the fountain.
Trash Cans Painted
Over by Dinkelspiel Auditorium,
the weathered surfaces of campus
trash cans were painted bright orange.
Other students walked the plaza in
search of unpainted manhole covers
and lamp posts.
Several hundred people, ranging
from four years old to 60,
participated. "What else is there to do
on a Saturday morning?" asked one
female student as she slapped paint on
a trash can.
Plant Services employees supervised
the volunteer workers. Maintenance
personnel scrubbed down the trash
cans before they were painted, and a
couple of painters supplied cloths,
brushes, paint and advice.
"This is not taking away work from
the Plant Services employees," said
Hans Scheekle, a painter for the
department. De Young also stressed
that financial cutbacks in the
department's budget were not the
reason for using free student labor.
"It is not to save money.
Everything that is being done is in
addition to what regular personnel do

every year," DeYoung said. He
pointed out that the Claw has never
been cleaned nor would have been this
year if volunteers had not done it.
"The University has never had
enough money to keep up this huge
campus as well as it should be," said
DeYoung. In the past four years, the
department's budget has been cut
$262,000, but DeYoung claims that
even without these cuts, many jobs
would be left undone without
volunteer help.
Revive Pride
"Everybody thinks someone else
will clean up," said DeYoung, and he
asserted that there has been a
deterioration in the campus'
appearance in the last three years.
"The time has come to revive pride in
our surroundings," he said.
Besides the cleanup of White Plaza,
DeYoung has many more ambitious
plans to "celebrate the coming of
spring." With the help of students,
faculty, and staff, he hopes to plant
500 trees on the hills back of the
campus and build a mile and a half
irrigation ditch to water the roses on
El Camino Real
Grounds supervisor Fred Priddle
will lead the campaign to replant
flower beds damaged by the winter
freeze, and Andy Just, paint shop
supervisor will help those who wish to
paint their classrooms, offices or
laboratories. Those who want to clean
their first-floor windows should
contact Joe Diani, building
maintenance supervisor.
DeYoung hopes to have another
Saturday morning of spring cleaning in
the Inner Quad, tentatively set for
April 21.
