## Slate Stresses ASSU Effectiveness Slate Seeks Many Reforms

"We want to concentrate on the
areas where we can be most effective,"
says Pete Van Petten, head of one of
the slates running for the ASSU
Council of Presidents. ASSU

involvement with national issues
"doesn't have much effect, so you
might as well not waste the time and
effort," he said.
— Van Petten, a junior in Political
Science, is a current ASSU vice
president and has served on several
University committees in the past
several years. The other members of
his slate are:
— Charles "Buck" Schott, a senior
in history and a former ASSU senator
who helped organize the ASSU
Speakers Bureau and has worked with
University fund raising organizations;
~ Tom Flohr, a current senator, has
served on the foreign studies

committee, the Committee of 15, and
the Stanford-in-Washington Board, and
is working on a co-terminal in
economics;
— and Jim Anderson, a senior in
Political Science, is an ASSU senator
and chairman of the Committee of 15.
Two Types On ASSU
The Van Petten slate is one of
several running for the Council of
Presidents, but Van Petten has singled
out one, headed by Kevin O'Grady,
for attack.
"There are two types of people in
the ASSU," Van Petten told the Daily
recently, "people who are in the ASSU
to promote their own political
philosophy and people who want to
use the ASSU to serve students'
interests."
"O'Grady has only been at
Stanford six months and hasn't shown
any interest in improving students'
interests. He has been interested in
pushing his own political philosophy, I
imagine that's why he founded
SCOPE," Van Petten said.
Local Concentration
Van Petten said his slate would
concentrate on local campus issues.
"We can't do anything to prevent

tuition from going up but we can
cushion the effect on the students,"
says Flohr, who suggests that the
University should have a long-term,
low interest, loan plan similar to one
at Yale University.
Flohr said the University should
also try to increase student
employment by filling some job
vacancies with part-time student
employees. Flohr said this would also
cut University costs.
Van Petten has also drawn fire for
allegedly unduly stressing his own
name in a pamphlet advertising for the
recent Grateful Dead concert on
campus.
Van Petten said that the pamphlet
had been issued to respond to a critical
letter to the editor of the Daily. "We
just wanted to explain the work we
had done on the concert," he said.
Schott said increasing the number
of speakers and concerts is one of the
slate's main concerns. "Money is the
key," he said, "Until the ASSU fee
assessment for speakers was passed
these [speakers] were just a dream."
Schott said sharing expenses with
other groups, and utilizing Stanford
connections has been important in
getting speakers, but advocated that
admission should be charged to help
cover costs.
Van Petten said his slate would
probably push for another Speaker's
Bureau fee assessment next year. The
goal for ASSU-sponsored events, he
said, is to break even. He said the
recent John Mayall concert broke even
and the Grateful Dead concert netted
the ASSU $1500.
Anderson, chairman of the
committee charged with judicial
reform, said "We've been pushing for a
student majority (on the Campus
Judicial Panel) and similar means of
selecting student and faculty
members."
"These will take awhile to come up
with," said Anderson, "We would
hope to do it incrimentally over a
period of time."
Flohr outlined proposals for

educational reform the slate is
pushing. "Distribution requirements,
as they are now, are a joke," he said.
Flohr said the science requirement for
humanities and social science majors
was an example. "Everyone looks for
an easy science course."
"The University, rather than
requiring things, should set up
structured programs that the students
can go into if they want to," he said.
Flohr also said each department
should have a strong undergraduate
association, and that such reforms as
receiving course credit for passing a
test covering material that would be in
a given course, and a six- or seven-year
program for an M.D. degree should be
investigated.

involvement with national issues
"doesn't have much effect, so you
might as well not waste the time and
effort," he said.
— Van Petten, a junior in Political
Science, is a current ASSU vice
president and has served on several
University committees in the past
several years. The other members of
his slate are:
— Charles "Buck" Schott, a senior
in history and a former ASSU senator
who helped organize the ASSU
Speakers Bureau and has worked with
University fund raising organizations;
~ Tom Flohr, a current senator, has
served on the foreign studies

committee, the Committee of 15, and
the Stanford-in-Washington Board, and
is working on a co-terminal in
economics;
— and Jim Anderson, a senior in
Political Science, is an ASSU senator
and chairman of the Committee of 15.
Two Types On ASSU
The Van Petten slate is one of
several running for the Council of
Presidents, but Van Petten has singled
out one, headed by Kevin O'Grady,
for attack.
"There are two types of people in
the ASSU," Van Petten told the Daily
recently, "people who are in the ASSU
to promote their own political
philosophy and people who want to
use the ASSU to serve students'
interests."
"O'Grady has only been at
Stanford six months and hasn't shown
any interest in improving students'
interests. He has been interested in
pushing his own political philosophy, I
imagine that's why he founded
SCOPE," Van Petten said.
Local Concentration
Van Petten said his slate would
concentrate on local campus issues.
"We can't do anything to prevent

tuition from going up but we can
cushion the effect on the students,"
says Flohr, who suggests that the
University should have a long-term,
low interest, loan plan similar to one
at Yale University.
Flohr said the University should
also try to increase student
employment by filling some job
vacancies with part-time student
employees. Flohr said this would also
cut University costs.
Van Petten has also drawn fire for
allegedly unduly stressing his own
name in a pamphlet advertising for the
recent Grateful Dead concert on
campus.
Van Petten said that the pamphlet
had been issued to respond to a critical
letter to the editor of the Daily. "We
just wanted to explain the work we
had done on the concert," he said.
Schott said increasing the number
of speakers and concerts is one of the
slate's main concerns. "Money is the
key," he said, "Until the ASSU fee
assessment for speakers was passed
these [speakers] were just a dream."
Schott said sharing expenses with
other groups, and utilizing Stanford
connections has been important in
getting speakers, but advocated that
admission should be charged to help
cover costs.
Van Petten said his slate would
probably push for another Speaker's
Bureau fee assessment next year. The
goal for ASSU-sponsored events, he
said, is to break even. He said the
recent John Mayall concert broke even
and the Grateful Dead concert netted
the ASSU $1500.
Anderson, chairman of the
committee charged with judicial
reform, said "We've been pushing for a
student majority (on the Campus
Judicial Panel) and similar means of
selecting student and faculty
members."
"These will take awhile to come up
with," said Anderson, "We would
hope to do it incrimentally over a
period of time."
Flohr outlined proposals for

educational reform the slate is
pushing. "Distribution requirements,
as they are now, are a joke," he said.
Flohr said the science requirement for
humanities and social science majors
was an example. "Everyone looks for
an easy science course."
"The University, rather than
requiring things, should set up
structured programs that the students
can go into if they want to," he said.
Flohr also said each department
should have a strong undergraduate
association, and that such reforms as
receiving course credit for passing a
test covering material that would be in
a given course, and a six- or seven-year
program for an M.D. degree should be
investigated.
