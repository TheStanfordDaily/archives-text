# Another Fine Mess
## Dorm Staff Pick-le 
### 
z* s * Daniel Brenner

Among the many rites of the
Stanford spring, hay fever and
next year's housing staff selection
process have to be among the
most difficult to cope with. But
while hay fever can be combatted
by frequent trips to the beach, it
is not as easy to get rid of the ills
of staff selection.
The members of the Dean of
Students office who are visited by
the onus of staff selection have
quite a headache. They, and the
senior resident staffs of each of
the University's housing units,
have the untidy chore of selecting
which students will be privileged
to enjoy the benefits of one of the
most pleasant and creative ways
of making a campus buck.
The problem is anything but a
dearth of qualified applicants. The
planeloads of ex-student body
presidents, football team captains,
debating stars, and National Merit
whiz kids who make up each
freshman class testify to the vast
availability of leadership types
who are naturals for housing staff
positions.
A Good Deal
No, the housing staff hassle
results from having too many
qualified persons who can spot a
• good deal and who want the job.
Staff selection will involve a
two-step process. First each
candidate will be interviewed by a
panel of housing staff people. If
the candidate survives that
grilling, his or her name will be
put on the big list which is sent to
the faculty, house fellows and
other staff members who will
assign staff for specialty and row
houses.
Things start to jump at this
point. Because the process
becomes de-centralized,
candidates scamper hither and
thither, seeking to curry interest
in their candidacy with designated
hiring personnel. The best way to
endure this part of selection
would be to pretend to be a
candidate for the presidential
nomination and so must visit the
Branner, Stern, and Wilbur
caucuses.
Impossible
The system certainly deserves
praise for taking the impossible
decision of who to select away
from a dean's staff not directly
involved in the welfare of the
living groups — and putting the
impossible decision into the lap of
those who are.

My belief that selecting staffers
fairly is virtually impossible is not
meant to criticize those who must
do the picking. By and large, the
selection process is administered
with careful scrutiny and concern
for the abilities and feelings of
applicants. But the process is
inherently knotted with biases
which suggest that a fishbowl pick
of successfully screened applicants
would provide far more equity.
First, the subtle relationship
between faculty and student can
be upset if a faculty member who
knows a student and is asked by
him or her for a position finds
that all his positions have been
filled. The slight of refusing a
student-friend is more than just
bruised feelings; the position can
yield the student several hundred
dollars each quarter for
performing a relatively enjoyable
function.
Incumbents
Second, incumbent holders do,
and probably should, maintain a
competitive edge in the selection.
If a student has done well in his
task, it is fair to reward him or her
with another year on the job,
especially because his experience
makes the student all the more
capable. But an incumbent edge is
hardly fair to newcomers.
Thirdly, it is not clear whether
financial aid should be the
deciding factor in the process. A
housing staff position relieves
many students on financial aid
from the considerable hardship
they would otherwise face if
required to go on work-study or
assume part-time work. Surely
these students deserve special
consideration; but how much
advantage should financial need
accord an applicant, especially
when there is a need for diversity
of background on the housing
staff — and when many
full-paying students, in the light
of spiraling expenses, find housing
staff salaries one way to avoid
transferring to a less expensive
institution?
Finally, there is always the
ugly element of favoritism which
surrounds a procedure as
subjective as selecting housing
staff. Springtime rumors abound
concerning influence peddling,
with respect to unsupervised staff
positions.
Whether or not a random pick
of screened applicants or an

admittedly-cosmic method of
"scoring" applicants would solve
some of these biases could be
learned only by a trial run.
Perhaps those who most need the
job and/or are most qualified will
find their way onto the staff by
such methods.
But if some aspiring member of.
the Stanford community wants to
earn the glowing admiration of
the people who put on the Great
Spring Housing Staff Scramble
(and, who knows, maybe an
administrative job?), why not
write The Study of Housing Staffs
at Stanford; it'll wow the
University.

Among the many rites of the
Stanford spring, hay fever and
next year's housing staff selection
process have to be among the
most difficult to cope with. But
while hay fever can be combatted
by frequent trips to the beach, it
is not as easy to get rid of the ills
of staff selection.
The members of the Dean of
Students office who are visited by
the onus of staff selection have
quite a headache. They, and the
senior resident staffs of each of
the University's housing units,
have the untidy chore of selecting
which students will be privileged
to enjoy the benefits of one of the
most pleasant and creative ways
of making a campus buck.
The problem is anything but a
dearth of qualified applicants. The
planeloads of ex-student body
presidents, football team captains,
debating stars, and National Merit
whiz kids who make up each
freshman class testify to the vast
availability of leadership types
who are naturals for housing staff
positions.
A Good Deal
No, the housing staff hassle
results from having too many
qualified persons who can spot a
• good deal and who want the job.
Staff selection will involve a
two-step process. First each
candidate will be interviewed by a
panel of housing staff people. If
the candidate survives that
grilling, his or her name will be
put on the big list which is sent to
the faculty, house fellows and
other staff members who will
assign staff for specialty and row
houses.
Things start to jump at this
point. Because the process
becomes de-centralized,
candidates scamper hither and
thither, seeking to curry interest
in their candidacy with designated
hiring personnel. The best way to
endure this part of selection
would be to pretend to be a
candidate for the presidential
nomination and so must visit the
Branner, Stern, and Wilbur
caucuses.
Impossible
The system certainly deserves
praise for taking the impossible
decision of who to select away
from a dean's staff not directly
involved in the welfare of the
living groups — and putting the
impossible decision into the lap of
those who are.

My belief that selecting staffers
fairly is virtually impossible is not
meant to criticize those who must
do the picking. By and large, the
selection process is administered
with careful scrutiny and concern
for the abilities and feelings of
applicants. But the process is
inherently knotted with biases
which suggest that a fishbowl pick
of successfully screened applicants
would provide far more equity.
First, the subtle relationship
between faculty and student can
be upset if a faculty member who
knows a student and is asked by
him or her for a position finds
that all his positions have been
filled. The slight of refusing a
student-friend is more than just
bruised feelings; the position can
yield the student several hundred
dollars each quarter for
performing a relatively enjoyable
function.
Incumbents
Second, incumbent holders do,
and probably should, maintain a
competitive edge in the selection.
If a student has done well in his
task, it is fair to reward him or her
with another year on the job,
especially because his experience
makes the student all the more
capable. But an incumbent edge is
hardly fair to newcomers.
Thirdly, it is not clear whether
financial aid should be the
deciding factor in the process. A
housing staff position relieves
many students on financial aid
from the considerable hardship
they would otherwise face if
required to go on work-study or
assume part-time work. Surely
these students deserve special
consideration; but how much
advantage should financial need
accord an applicant, especially
when there is a need for diversity
of background on the housing
staff — and when many
full-paying students, in the light
of spiraling expenses, find housing
staff salaries one way to avoid

between faculty and student can
be upset if a faculty member who
knows a student and is asked by
him or her for a position finds
that all his positions have been
filled. The slight of refusing a
student-friend is more than just
bruised feelings; the position can
yield the student several hundred
dollars each quarter for
performing a relatively enjoyable
function.
Incumbents
Second, incumbent holders do,
and probably should, maintain a
competitive edge in the selection.
If a student has done well in his
task, it is fair to reward him or her
with another year on the job,
especially because his experience
makes the student all the more
capable. But an incumbent edge is
hardly fair to newcomers.
Thirdly, it is not clear whether
financial aid should be the
deciding factor in the process. A
housing staff position relieves
many students on financial aid
from the considerable hardship
they would otherwise face if
required to go on work-study or
assume part-time work. Surely
these students deserve special
consideration; but how much
advantage should financial need
accord an applicant, especially
when there is a need for diversity
of background on the housing
staff — and when many
full-paying students, in the light
of spiraling expenses, find housing
staff salaries one way to avoid
transferring to a less expensive
institution?
Finally, there is always the
ugly element of favoritism which
surrounds a procedure as
subjective as selecting housing
staff. Springtime rumors abound
concerning influence peddling,
with respect to unsupervised staff
positions.
Whether or not a random pick
of screened applicants or an

admittedly-cosmic method of
"scoring" applicants would solve
some of these biases could be
learned only by a trial run.
Perhaps those who most need the
job and/or are most qualified will
find their way onto the staff by
such methods.
But if some aspiring member of.
the Stanford community wants to
earn the glowing admiration of
the people who put on the Great
Spring Housing Staff Scramble
(and, who knows, maybe an
administrative job?), why not
write The Study of Housing Staffs
at Stanford; it'll wow the
University.
