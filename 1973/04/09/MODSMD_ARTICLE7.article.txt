## Spring Has Sprung

Spring has come!
Plant Services has great ideas
and enthusiastic personnel who
wish to celebrate the coming of
Spring. We would appreciate the
interest of the Stanford
Community in helping in our
Spring program. We intend to:
a. Provide paint, buckets,
brushes, rollers, ladders and

drop-cloths to anyone who wishes
to paint his Stanford office,
laboratory, or classroom. Contact
Andy Just, Paint Shop Supervisor
(X 2856) for selection from 75
standard colors and loan of
equipment.
b. Plant 500 trees. We have the
trees and the plan. We want to
plant 300 oaks on the hills behind

the main campus in small fenced
enclosures to protect them from
the cattle. We need help to put up
the fences and plant the trees.
Volunteers may call Perry
Hackett, Manager of Roads and
Grounds (X 4388). From the
volunteers, water brigades will be
organized for the summer.
c. Replant flower beds.
Opportunities exist for flower
lovers to assist our dedicated
groundsmen replace plants lost in
the "Big Freeze." To adopt a
flower bed, call Fred Priddle,
Grounds Supervisor (X 4995).
d. Build an irrigation line to
water the eight thousand feet of
rose bushes along El Camino Real.
A group of volunteer engineers is
needed to help in the trenching
and installation. With the
manpower saved, the Oval will be
maintained again year-round.
e. Wash first floor windows.
Plant Services will provide plastic
buckets, rags and cleaning
solutions. We'll leave upper floor
windows to the professionals.
Those wishing to improve
visibility should call Joe Diani,
Building Maintenance Supervisor
(X 2117) for supplies.
112. Recreate and rejuvenate the
Cactus Garden. Near the
Mausoleum, Mrs. Stanford planted
many exotic cactus plants from all
over the world. Although this
garden has been neglected, many
of the original plants are still
growing. A student group is going
to take on the task of cleaning
and replanting for all to enjoy.
g. Most of all, the personnel of
Plant Services want everyone to
share our sense of pride and
satisfaction in living, working and
studying in this beautiful place.
Our semi-weekly film and lecture
series on gardening and our "Walk
in the Stanford Trees" scheduled
for April 15th and May 13th, are
organized for this purpose.
Join us in making the campus
sparkle. We'll welcome your ideas
and your assistance. Please pass
our message on to others.
(Dan Dc Young is director for
all Plant Services Personnel.)
