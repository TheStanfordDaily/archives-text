# 'Rough Draft'
## Military Registration Will Go On 
###

Now that draft calls have
ended for the forseeable future,
the Selective Service System is
likely to become more invisible.
The law will continue to require
that men register, be classified,
and maintain current mailing
addresses with local draft boards,
but after June 30, it will no longer
authorize the final step of
induction (without Congressional
approval).
This plan of zero draft calls
with a standby Selective Service
System is endorsed by the Nixon
Administration over the
alternative of outright draft
repeal, which would require
dismantling of the whole draft
system. Although there are many
Congressional proponents of draft
repeal, the chances for its
accomplishment in the near future
appear to be fairly small.
During the years of heavy draft
calls, enforcement of the
provisions of the draft law was
achieved primarily by federal
prosecution of men who refused
to submit to induction. Courts
around the country still have a
backlog of several thousand cases
of violators reported by Selective
Service.

An important question to ask
now that inductions have ceased
is, how will the draft law be
enforced from now on? One
answer is that the Justice
Department will soon begin to
prosecute a wider variety of
Selective Service violations.
Late Registration
The most likely area of focus
will be non-registration and late
registration, but charges could
easily be (and have been) brought
against men for failure to keep
current mailing addresses, failure
to return official SSS forms, and
other similar acts. Any violation
of the draft law can result in a
felony charge, and the same jail
sentence (of up to 5 years) applies
to any conviction.
This is not to suggest that the
Justice Department will now try
to send every man to jail who
registers a few days late with his
local board, or who fails to send
in a change of address notice. But
it does appear likely that court
prosecution for lesser offenses will
be increased on a selective basis in
order to putlically encourage
compliance with the draft law.
Change In Policy
Because the Justice
Department has long been
backlogged with induction refusal
cases, it has usually only
prosecuted non-registrants when
they have repeatedly refused to
register after being confronted.
Thus, in the past a man over 18
who has belately decided to
register (or learned that he is
required to register) has not
usually been in danger of
prosecution, if he has complied
with the law after registering.
This situation may change in
the future, however, as indicated
by a recent change in the way
local boards handle the processing
of late registrants. Now. any man
who registers after the 30 day
period following his 18th birthday
may automatically have his draft
file sent to the U.S. Attorney's
Office for review. The statute of
limitations would normally allow
a man in such circumstances to be

prosecuted anytime during the
five years following his
registration.
Threat
This devised "threat" of
prosecution may be used
primarily as a publicity tactic to
remind people of the registration
requirement. On the other hand,
it could be used coercively against
individuals if, for instance, the

U.S. Attorney were to offer a man
the option of enlistment in lieu of
prosecution for late registration.
A number of such options are
within the authority of the Justice
Department.
Certainly all men who will turn
18 in the next year or two should
be aware of these policy changes.
However, men in a more difficult
situation are those who are now

over 18 (by more than 30 days)
and who have not registered for
the draft, but are considering
doing so. Such men now face
more unpredictable sanctions
against them if they register late.
They may want to obtain draft
counseling or legal help in
deciding what to do.
