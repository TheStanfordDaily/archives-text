Thrust . . .
Editor:
With the intellectual arrogance
and conceit which many Stanford
professors abound with, several of
these ivory tower economic
"experts" urged the Stanford
Community not to support Rent
Control. This was done in a letter
to the Daily the last day of winter
quarter. It is obvious from the
letter that these profs and a
couple of grad students who
signed the letter didn't even
bother to read the rent control
ordinance itself. So much for their
objectivity.
To really understand a
situation a person must be
involved in it. From the addresses
of the signers I see that they are
contentedly wallowing in their
affluent homes at Stanford. They
still have the gall, however, to tell
us here in Palo Alto not to do
anything about high rents. The
fact of the matter is that although
these so-called economists have
lots to say on just about
everything, 99 percent of it just
isn't worth listening to. This is
because they know not of what
they speak.
Finally high rents is not just an
intellectual problem and should
be taken more seriously than a

meaningless exchange of letters.
By this 1 mean that if you support
Rent Control, don't just say you
support us, call us and offer to
help gather a few of your friends
signatures. Palo Alto Tenant's
Union (PATU) phone is
321-7387.

The recent letter (Daily, April
3) by the Palo Alto Tenants
Union is an excellent example of
misdirected energy. The writers
are obviusly disturbed by the
shortage of low-priced housing in
Palo Alto, yet they continue to
advocate a policy of rent control
which will only exacerbate this
problem.
The logic of the original letter
(Daily, March 15), signed by me
and eight other faculty and
student economists, remains
unassailable: Rent control laws
tend to induce housing shortages.
Furthermore, the program
outlined in the Tenants Union's
letter would institute more
control than now exists in New
York City. It would thus induce
an even greater housing shortage
than would a New York-type

plan.
For those seriously interested
in the welfare of tenants, the
following deserve attention: (1)
the recent expansionary monetary
policy of the Federal Reserve
Bank, which is the main cause of
high prices in general; (2) the
existence of laws which allow
construction unions to exclude
many potential workers from
jobs, thus raising both
construction workers' wages and
the price of housing, while at the
same time increasing the level of
unemployment, particularly
among minorities; (3) the
existence of similar laws
applicable to unions of plumbers
and others which raise the costs of
building maintenance; (4) the
enforcement of zoning laws and
building codes which prohibit
innovative land use; and (5) last,
but certainly not least, staggering
property taxes, which are passed
on to tenants.
I sincerely hope that the
members of the Palo Alto Tenants
Union will direct their energies to
an examination of these
pernicious policies, rather than
seeking to harm the beleaguered
tenant still further with yet
another bureaucratic fiasco.
