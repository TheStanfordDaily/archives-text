LaM year, in New York City
alone, 7 nursing nuns made
6,322 patient visits. Not in hos
pitals, hut in the patients' own
homes. Fantastic? Not at all.
Not for the Dominican Sisters of
the Sick Poor. Rver since they
were founded in 1876, the Sisters
have been doing the impossible
daily.
Long before there were relief
agencies or visiting nurses, the
Dominican Sisters were dedicated
to nursing the poor in their own
homes thus keeping the families
together.
Today, the Dominican Sisters of
the Sick Poor are still on the job.
Although their primary work is
still in nursing, it has been ex
panded to include social work,
physiotherapy, dietetics, and al
most all health related profes
sions. Each woman has her own
skill, her own special ability to
offer. In this Order, which is
small in size, there is both free
dom and flexibility.
Yet the Sisters arc not merely
visiting nurses but religious
nurses who think of their patients,
not as cases, but suffering mem
bers of the Mystical Body of
Christ who need, even beyond
material and physical help, the
healing unction of Christ's love.
