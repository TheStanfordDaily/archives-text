LOSE 20 POUNDS
IN TWO WEEKS!
Famous U.S. Women Ski Team Diet
During the non-snow off season
the U.S. Women's Alpine Ski Team
members go on the "Ski Team" 'diet
to lose 20 pounds in two weeks.
That's right — 20 pounds in 14 days!
The basis of the diet is chemical food
action and was devised by a famous
Colorado physician especially for the
U.S. Ski Team. Normal energy is
maintained (very important!) while
reducing. You keep "full" — no
starvation — because the diet is de
signed that way! It's a diet that is
easy to follow whether you work,
travel or stay at home.
This is, honestly, a fantastically
successful diet If it weren't, the U.S.
Women's Ski Team wouldn't be per
mitted to use it! Right? So, give
yourself the same break the U.S. Ski
Team gets. Lose weight the scientific,
proven way. Even if you've tried all
the other diets, you owe it to your
self to try the U.S. Women's Ski
Team Diet. That is, if you really do
want to lose 20 pounds in two weeks.
Order today. Tear this out as a
reminder.
Send only $2.00 (s2.2f> for Rush
Service) — cash is O.K. — to Infor
mation Sources Co., P.O. Box 231,
Dept. ST, Carpinteria, Calif. 93013.
Don't order unless you expect to lose
20 pounds in two weeks! Because
that's what the Ski Team Diet will do!
