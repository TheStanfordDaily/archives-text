# Political Buttons Capture Pageantry -And Obscurity
## 
### GLENN GARVIN 
AuH2O+GOP+64 • VICTORY! the
banner advised everyone who walked
into the Tresidder Large Lounge
Sunday morning. But despite the fact
that this particular slogan hasn't been
in wide usage for the past nine years,
no one seemed visibly shocked — or
even surprised.
Election slogans from 1964, you
see, are old hat to the American
Political Items Collectors (APIC) and
members of the National Political
Button Exchange (NPBE). They thrive
on them.
The APIC and the NPBE held a
meeting Sunday in Tresidder,
attracting political packrats from such
diverse spots as Colusa and Santa Ana.
About 30 members showed up "along
with about 10 or 20 kids who just
wandered in off the campus and were
pretty freaked out by the whole
thing," according to one button-lover.
"The main purpose of these things
is to buy, sell, and generally bullshit
about things," said Rex Stark, a

graduate student in chemistry who
sponsored the meeting. "We have them
every two or three months."
Arranged around the second-story
lounge were five or six tables stacked
high with exhibits of various political
paraphernalia and endless supplies of
buttons, many of them for sale. One
of the most popular themes was the
1972 election, a fairly violent one that
produced a bumper crop of buttons.
Partisan Buttons
Aside from the run of the mill
VOTE REPUBLIC AN-type things,
there was MISGOVERN WITH
MCGOVERN and I'M 1000% BEHIND
MCGOVERN for Nixon voters. Those
whose tastes run the other way, could
pick up a small button that advised
DON'T BLAME ME! I WORKED FOR
MCGOVERN for 50 cents.
But Nixon and McGovern weren't
the only candidates in the last
election, which button collectors
know better than anybody. There
were buttons for sale plugging the
candidacy of Linda Jenness of the

Socialist Workers, John Hospers of the
Libertarians, and even Munn and
Uncapher of the Prohibitionists.
In addition, there were arrays of
Muskie, Hartke, Lindsay, and Sanford
buttons for anybody who remembered
who they were.
Previous Campaigns
It didn't end there. The buttons ran
from WALLACE-LEMAY to IN MY
HEART I KNOW HE'S RIGHT
(enclosed, of course, in a little pink
heart) to 1 LIKE IKE. Even older, was
NO THIRD TERM! and BETTER A
THIRD TERMER THAN A THIRD
RATER.
"The only thing I've sold more than
one of is this John Schmitz button
here," said Suzanne Graham, a 1956
Stanford graduate peddling buttons at
one of the tables. "I don't think you
could say that indicates any political
trends or anything."
Neal Machander, a Santa Ana
resident who flew up for the meeting,
got into button collecting as Orange
County Republican chairman during

the 19405. "I picked up a lot of
Dewey, Wilkie, and Roosevelt buttons
while I was doing that and I hung onto
them," Machander explained. "They
just set around, and then one day
something bit me. It's very
educational."
Hobby Not So Uncommon
Machander admits that his hobby is
a little strange. "Until 1968, when I
joined APIC, I always thought I was
the only one in the world who did
this. These meetings always reassure
me.
"I don't know, though. This
morning when I got on the plane at
LA International, the guards hardly
searched our stuff at all. They just
wanted to look at all the buttons.
Maybe it's not so strange anymore."
Stark who acted as ad hoc chairman
of the meeting, displayed an exhibit
which included:
—a Franklin Pierce clay pipe from
1852
—a scrimshaw ring with U.S.
Grant's picture on it from 1868

—a Herbert Hoover paperweight
from the 1929 inaugural
—an Adlai Stevenson cigarette
lighter from 1956
—a token memorializing John
Brown's raid on Harper's Ferry, issued
in 1859
—an Indian penny that was run over
by James Garfield's funeral train in
1881.
Probably the most bizarre display
belonged to Tom French, a UC-Santa
Cruz sophomore who collects Ku Klux
Klan material. Among the material he
brought along Sunday was a token
reading ONE COUNTRY, ONE FLAG,
ONE LANGUAGE with pictures of
the Constitution, the flag, and the
Bible.
KKK Scares Him
"I collect it because it scares me,
mainly," French explained. "I've got
some robes and hoods at home. 1
collect George Wallace stuff, too. It
sort of goes hand-in-hand with the
KKK material."
Another of French's more prized
possessions is a set of notes from the
Grand Dragon of the Kansas KKK,
detailing plans for a 1926 parade in
Wichita.
"The most expensive thing I have,
though, is a token with an
anti-Catholic message on it. It cost me
$25," French said proudly.
"I like collecting political buttons,
but it really isn't as much fun as this
KKK stuff."

REMEMBER? — Alf Landon never did
smcke out Franklin Roosevelt, but
collectors of political paraphernalia
who gathered at Tresidder Sunday
didn't care. This was only one of many
exhibits on political heroes, past and
present.
criteria. Interested students must
submit a short statement on their
educational interests and must meet
with two members of the committee.
These students go on the priority list
regardless of their grade points,
talents, or connections.
Whitman will be having its open
house Thursday, from 7:30-10 p.m. at
Tresidder.
Larry Horton, Associate Dean of
Students for Residential Education,
greets student-initiated programs like
Whitman with enthusiasm. He wants
to see more innovation in the housing
system.
Grove House
Grove is one house that will be
affected by this sort of rehashing.
According to Horton, a proposal to
build a new campus Drive "looks like
it might make it to the Board of
Trustees."

Stillman House, now one of the
Grove Houses, lies in the path of thy
proposed road. If the Board approves
the proposal, Stillman will have to be
moved next to Lathrop House. It will
then be too far from the other Grove
House, Hurlburt, to use the Hurlburt
dining room, or even to remain one of
the Grove Houses.
Grove is one of the most popular
houses on campus. If half of it
disappears, drawing into the other half
may be nearly impossible.
"The only solution as we saw it,"
says Horton, "was to make Lasuen
part of Grove and to turn Stillman
into some sort of cooperative."
Luckily, Columbae, the cooperative
non-violence theme house, had
requested a smaller house than the one
it has now. The Housing Office
assigned it to the relocated Stillman
and assigned Whitman to the old
Columbae House. This solved the
problem.
