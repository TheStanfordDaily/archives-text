# At Least Lower Them
## Down With Taxes

There is nothing certain save death and taxes.

Happy Birthday to you,
Happy Birthday dear IRS, you dirty bastards,
Happy Birthday to you. "

And a happy birthday it must be for the Internal Revenue
Service, formed as a result of the passage of a constitutional
amendment in 1913 which established the federal income tax.
May we all be so prosperous at age 60 as the federal tax
structure. For, born with the idea of providing just enough money
to keep government rolling, and objected to on the floor of
Congress because it had the potential for taking as much as two per
cent of a citizen's income, the income tax now removes an average
of 25 percent of every dollar earned—this in addition to state, local,
and other taxes.
What is remarkable about the income tax in the United States is
the relative ease with which the government obtains it. Most of us
have been brought up to believe that one is not a good citizen unless
he pays his taxes. Cheating is condoned perhaps, but evasion is
frowned upon. Tax resistance movements are regarded as somewhat
distasteful efforts on the part of political fringe groups which are
not to be taken seriously.
Bitch and Mumble
In short, taxpayers may bitch and mumble and moan and groan,
but they come through every April 15 with a willingness
unparalleled in most non-totalitarian nations.
In Italy, for example, thousands of people never pay any taxes at
all because they never file a return. The bureaucracy there is so
hopelessly tangled that evaders can never be tracked down. And in
Denmark, a political party formed by a disgruntled taxpayer is
gaining surprising strength on a platform of repeal of the income
tax.
One sometimes gets the feeling, though, that Americans would
pay their taxes even if there weren't an Internal Revenue Service to
make sure that they do. Surely no political party would be taken
seriusly if its avowed goal was the repeal of the income tax. We hear
from time to time of the growing "Tax Rebellion," but those who
openly engage in it, either from the Right or the Left are
immediately clamped down upon by the federal machine.
Spectacular
All this is even more surprising in light of the spectacular failure
of most tax-supported federal programs, whether they be military or
so-called "social" programs. The most visible part of federal
spending is the waste—whether it be for a new fighter plane or a new
housing development, either of which is predestined to be obsolete
before completion.
It should be enough to know that, out of every dollar paid in
taxes, no more than about 40 cents will be spent in a way that could
be termed "productive" even under the most liberal of definitions,
in order to bring about a real tax revolt either in terms of mass
political change or widespread tax evas : on. Even those of us who
will be receiving tax refunds should be si f ficiently annoyed at the
hidden nature of the withholding tax and the bite taken out of
refunds by inflation to demand at least a more honest way to do
business.
And those who profess to value freedom should ideally
strenuously object to the claim that heavy taxation is needed for the
accomplishment of social goals which are defined, designed, and
implemented by institutional master-planners beyond our reach.
Budget Cutbacks
Yet, so far, objection has been limited and feeble. There are
hopeful signs, of course, although they are mitigated by surrounding
circumstances. Nixon's budget calls for important and needed
cutbacks, but still is larger than last year's. Reagan's tax plan would
gradually cut back the income tax per capita of California residents,
but is being vehemently opposed by the legislature, who refuse even
to submit it to a popular vote on the grounds that it might pass.
Maybe taxes must approach near-confiscatory levels before
resistance becomes widespread. By that time, government may be so
powerful that resistance will be useless—after all, government power
is related to its financial strength. But eventually, the American
Revolutionary battlecry of "No taxation without representation!"
will be revived, only this time it will say: "No taxation with
representation, either!"

It should be enough to know that, out of every dollar paid in
taxes, no more than about 40 cents will be spent in a way that could
be termed "productive" even under the most liberal of definitions,
in order to bring about a real tax revolt either in terms of mass
political change or widespread tax evas : on. Even those of us who
will be receiving tax refunds should be si f ficiently annoyed at the
hidden nature of the withholding tax and the bite taken out of
refunds by inflation to demand at least a more honest way to do
business.
And those who profess to value freedom should ideally
strenuously object to the claim that heavy taxation is needed for the
accomplishment of social goals which are defined, designed, and
implemented by institutional master-planners beyond our reach.
Budget Cutbacks
Yet, so far, objection has been limited and feeble. There are
hopeful signs, of course, although they are mitigated by surrounding
circumstances. Nixon's budget calls for important and needed
cutbacks, but still is larger than last year's. Reagan's tax plan would
gradually cut back the income tax per capita of California residents,
but is being vehemently opposed by the legislature, who refuse even
to submit it to a popular vote on the grounds that it might pass.
Maybe taxes must approach near-confiscatory levels before
resistance becomes widespread. By that time, government may be so
powerful that resistance will be useless—after all, government power
is related to its financial strength. But eventually, the American
Revolutionary battlecry of "No taxation without representation!"
will be revived, only this time it will say: "No taxation with
representation, either!"

There is nothing certain save death and taxes.
—Benjamin Franklin
Taxes? I got an uncle that lives in Taxes.

"Happy Birthday to you,
Happy Birthday to you,
Happy Birthday dear IRS, you dirty bastards,
Happy Birthday to you. "
—Anonymous, found scrawled in blood
on the back of a W-2 form, 1973
And a happy birthday it must be for the Internal Revenue
Service, formed as a result of the passage of a constitutional
amendment in 1913 which established the federal income tax.
May we all be so prosperous at age 60 as the federal tax
structure. For, born with the idea of providing just enough money
to keep government rolling, and objected to on the floor of
Congress because it had the potential for taking as much as two per
cent of a citizen's income, the income tax now removes an average
of 25 percent of every dollar earned—this in addition to state, local,
and other taxes.
What is remarkable about the income tax in the United States is
the relative ease with which the government obtains it. Most of us
have been brought up to believe that one is not a good citizen unless
he pays his taxes. Cheating is condoned perhaps, but evasion is
frowned upon. Tax resistance movements are regarded as somewhat
distasteful efforts on the part of political fringe groups which are
not to be taken seriously.
Bitch and Mumble
In short, taxpayers may bitch and mumble and moan and groan,
but they come through every April 15 with a willingness
unparalleled in most non-totalitarian nations.
In Italy, for example, thousands of people never pay any taxes at
all because they never file a return. The bureaucracy there is so
hopelessly tangled that evaders can never be tracked down. And in
Denmark, a political party formed by a disgruntled taxpayer is
gaining surprising strength on a platform of repeal of the income
tax.
One sometimes gets the feeling, though, that Americans would
pay their taxes even if there weren't an Internal Revenue Service to
make sure that they do. Surely no political party would be taken
seriusly if its avowed goal was the repeal of the income tax. We hear
from time to time of the growing "Tax Rebellion," but those who
openly engage in it, either from the Right or the Left are
immediately clamped down upon by the federal machine.
Spectacular
All this is even more surprising in light of the spectacular failure
of most tax-supported federal programs, whether they be military or
so-called "social" programs. The most visible part of federal
spending is the waste—whether it be for a new fighter plane or a new
housing development, either of which is predestined to be obsolete
before completion.
It should be enough to know that, out of every dollar paid in
taxes, no more than about 40 cents will be spent in a way that could
be termed "productive" even under the most liberal of definitions,
in order to bring about a real tax revolt either in terms of mass
political change or widespread tax evas : on. Even those of us who
