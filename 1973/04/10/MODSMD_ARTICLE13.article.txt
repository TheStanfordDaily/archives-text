## SF Symphony Goes Modern 
### DOUG SMITH 
The San Francisco Symphony
played a very fine concert of
modern music at the War
Memorial Opera House last
Wednesday. It has become the
civic duty of a conductor in the
United States and Europe to
program one piece of
contemporary (or at least 20th
century) music per concert, in
order to educate his traditionally
conservative audience and to
insure that he does not become
merely the curator of a musical
museum.
Seiji Ozawa, however, is a man
who is obviously very interested
in the music of our century and
would probably present much
more of it if he could get away
with it. And judging from last
week's concert, maybe he can.
Only one of the four programmed
pieces was composed before 1900.
Henry Cowell's "Sinfonietta"
(1928) is reminiscent of baroque
orchestral music with its strings of
suspensions (here unresolved) and
quasi-fugal imitations. The mood
ranges from whimsy to brooding
and very successfully holds the
listener's attention. Ozawa's
orchestral sound was, as usual,
precise and transparent. This piece
will be presented in Russia on the
Symphony's upcoming tour.
Incidentally, Cowell, now

deceased, was born in 1897 in
Menlo Park.
Featured Soloist
Olivier Messiaen's "Exotic
Birds" (1956) is scored for a small
ensemble of winds and percussion
plus a piano. Peter Serkin, son of
one of the foremost pianists of
our time, was the featured soloist.
The texture of the Messiaen
"Birds" is bright and burbling,
very much like an incredible
aviary. Although Ozawa was
beating strict time, the listener
does not hear a rhythm beyond
the phrases of an individual
instrument or group of
instruments, all set in
counterpoint against each other.
There is so much going on in the
orchestra that it is easy to forget
the pianist until the cadenzas.
Serkin plunged into the music
and gave an impassioned

performance. The conductor and
orchestra were dressed in tails, but
he appeared in a loose pink shirt
with amulet, which rather
contributed to the effect of this
piece.
Serkin was also the soloist in
the Bach Clavier Concerto No. 3
in D Major (BWV 1054). Ozawa
took the first movement at a
lively pace, and the pianist's
articulation was appropriately
resilient. In the Adagio his
interpretation was sensitive, with
very light ornaments, but he could
not make this movement sing as it
should.
Spirited Performance
Since the concerto was
originally composed for violin and
later transcribed for keyboard by
Bach, this was only partly Serkin's
fault; the music cries out for a
sustaining instrument. The final

Allegro was given a spirited
performance, both by the
orchestra and soloist.
Several dozen patrons escaped
after the Bach was over.
Apparently they had come to hear
the baroque concerto and felt
they had been valiant to sit
through two modern pieces
beforehand, but that enough was
enough.
They should have stayed.
Respighi's "The Fountains of
Rome" (1914-1916) is as easy to
take as any 20th century music I
know of, and it received a
superlative performance. Ozawa's
control of dynamics, rhythm,
articulation and phrasing was
masterful, so that the listener
could just sit back and bask in
lovely Italian musical warmth.

will be presented in Russia on the
Symphony's upcoming tour.
Incidentally, Cowell, now

deceased, was born in 1897 in
Menlo Park.
Featured Soloist
Olivier Messiaen's "Exotic
Birds" (1956) is scored for a small
ensemble of winds and percussion
plus a piano. Peter Serkin, son of
one of the foremost pianists of
our time, was the featured soloist.
The texture of the Messiaen
"Birds" is bright and burbling,
very much like an incredible
aviary. Although Ozawa was
beating strict time, the listener
does not hear a rhythm beyond
the phrases of an individual
instrument or group of
instruments, all set in
counterpoint against each other.
There is so much going on in the
orchestra that it is easy to forget
the pianist until the cadenzas.
Serkin plunged into the music
and gave an impassioned

performance. The conductor and
orchestra were dressed in tails, but
he appeared in a loose pink shirt
with amulet, which rather
contributed to the effect of this
piece.
Serkin was also the soloist in
the Bach Clavier Concerto No. 3
in D Major (BWV 1054). Ozawa
took the first movement at a
lively pace, and the pianist's
articulation was appropriately
resilient. In the Adagio his
interpretation was sensitive, with
very light ornaments, but he could
not make this movement sing as it
should.
Spirited Performance
Since the concerto was
originally composed for violin and
later transcribed for keyboard by
Bach, this was only partly Serkin's
fault; the music cries out for a
sustaining instrument. The final

Allegro was given a spirited
performance, both by the
orchestra and soloist.
Several dozen patrons escaped
after the Bach was over.
Apparently they had come to hear
the baroque concerto and felt
they had been valiant to sit
through two modern pieces
beforehand, but that enough was
enough.
They should have stayed.
Respighi's "The Fountains of
Rome" (1914-1916) is as easy to
take as any 20th century music I
know of, and it received a
superlative performance. Ozawa's
control of dynamics, rhythm,
articulation and phrasing was
masterful, so that the listener
could just sit back and bask in
lovely Italian musical warmth.

BEJART IS COMING — Maurice Bejart's "Ballet of the 20th Century" will perform at the Opera House
April 23, 24, 26, 28, and 29, in Sacramento on April 20, and at the Flint Center on April 27.
The San Francisco Symphony
played a very fine concert of
modern music at the War
Memorial Opera House last
Wednesday. It has become the
civic duty of a conductor in the
United States and Europe to
program one piece of
contemporary (or at least 20th
century) music per concert, in
order to educate his traditionally
conservative audience and to
insure that he does not become
merely the curator of a musical
museum.
Seiji Ozawa, however, is a man
who is obviously very interested
in the music of our century and
would probably present much
more of it if he could get away
with it. And judging from last
week's concert, maybe he can.
Only one of the four programmed
pieces was composed before 1900.
Henry Cowell's "Sinfonietta"
(1928) is reminiscent of baroque
orchestral music with its strings of
suspensions (here unresolved) and
quasi-fugal imitations. The mood
ranges from whimsy to brooding
and very successfully holds the
listener's attention. Ozawa's
orchestral sound was, as usual,
precise and transparent. This piece
will be presented in Russia on the
Symphony's upcoming tour.
