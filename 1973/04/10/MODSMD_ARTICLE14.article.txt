# Why Are These People Smiling?

a. They are part of the group who just found out they
have 90 pereent fewer cavities.
b. They are the quarter-finalists in the consolation round
of the Mark Spitz look-alike contest.
c. They have just come back to Brylcream and they're
glad they did.
d. They have just attended a meeting of the Daily
Editorial Board staff.
As you probably have already guessed, the correct answer
is D. The fun-loving crew in this picture is the 1899 Editorial
Board of the Daily Palo Alto, which later became known as
the Stanford Daily. If you think that today's Daily staff has
carried on in the rowdy tradition of these pioneers, you're
right. But we put out the only daily morning newspaper for
this area and we take that job seriously.
Although the Daily has been around since 1899, you
don't need previous experience to join our staff. We need
people interested in writing news, sports, entertainment, or
feature stories, as well as photographers and business
staffers. Whether you're a 97-pound weakling or a sturdy
young whippersnapper, there's a place for you at the Daily.
So if you think you'd like to be part of the gang press
your hoop skirt or don your spats and drive your horse and
buggy to an orientation meeting at 3 p.m. this afternoon at
the Daily office on Lomita Drive, across the street from the
Campus Bike Shop.
