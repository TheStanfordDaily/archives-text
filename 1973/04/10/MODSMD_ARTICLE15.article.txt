# Mayall, Mark-Almond Perform In Maples Pavilion
## 
### DAN FORTE 
I suppose comparisons between
the John Mayall and
Mark-Almond bands, who
performed at Maples Pavilion
Friday, April 6, are inevitable,
because it is very seldom that
two such capable bands with so
many notable musicians play on
the same show. But to compare
the two musical styles would be
out of place, since each group
plays a different type of music
with a different purpose in mind.
Friday night's show started at
8:05 with Mark-Almond. The
group's two leaders, Jon Mark
(electric-acoustic guitar and

vocals) and Johnny Almond
(saxophone, flute, organ), were
formerly members of Mayall's
band. They appeared on the
"Turning Point" LP which is
probably Mayall's most
commercially successful album.
The rest of the group included
Geoff Condon on trumpet and
electric piano, Wolfgang Welz on
bass, Bobby Torres on congas, and
Alun Da vies on rhythm guitar,
who has released a solo album
entitled "Daydo." On drums was
the highly respected Dannie
Richmond, who has played for
several years with jazz bassist

Charlie Mingus, and appears on
many of his albums.
Encore
Mark-Almond played four
songs during their set and were
brought back for an encore; about
an hour in all. There were quite a
few cheers from the crowd when
they started "The City," which
spotlighted Almond's saxophone.
Their live version of "What Am I
Living For?" was far superior to
the recording on their new
Columbia LP, "Rising," as was
their whole performance in
general.
Mark dedicated the last
number to John Mayall. This one

featured extended solos by
everyone. It was highlighted by an
amazing drum solo by Richmond,
showing why he was once voted
"Best Drummer" in Downbeat's
Jazz Musicians Poll. (Richmond,
by the way, has two LPs out with
his own bands.)
Almond and Richmond were
the only jazz musicians in the
group; the rest being influenced
by rock and folk.
The group's encore was their
worst song of the night, but I
found their overall performance
to be a pleasant surprise, after
hearing their three albums.
When John Mayall and his

group took the stage there were
the usual PA system hassles which
have come to be expected at
Maples.
Mayall has always been known
for his constantly-changing band
personnel, having members leave
his group to later become famous;
Eric Clapton, Peter Green, Mick
Taylor, Jack Bruce, Mark and
Almond. But this is the first time
(with the exception of the "USA
Union" LP) that he has collected
a band of already-established
musicians.
Four members of the group are
black American jazz veterans;
Victor Gaskin on string bass
(formerly with Les McCann, Mose
Allison, and Cannonball Adderly,
among others), Red Holloway on
electric tenor sax (previously with
Billie Holiday, Duke Ellington,
et. al.), Blue Mitchell on trumpet
(formerly with Earl Bostic for
one), and guitarist Freddie
Robinson, who has played with
such names as Ray Charles, Jerry
Butler, and Howlin' Wolf. All
four, with the exception of
Gaskin, have albums out under
their own names. (Mitchell has a
total of nine LPs on the market at

present.)
Back on drums was Keef
Hartley who played with Mayall
for a long time before forming
The Keef Hartley Band, which has
four or five albums on Deram.
Mayall, of course, was on piano,
harmonica, and lead vocals.
Nothing Fancy
When the PA system was
finally straightened out, Mayall
asked the light man to just turn
up all the stage lights and leave
them that way, "no fancy stuff."
That sounded reasonable to me,
but for some reason the lighting
man insisted on experimenting
around all night.
Mayall's first two numbers
were loosely improvised jams,
which I imagine left much of the
audience cold, who wanted some
foot stomping. But, after that
things got much better.
Robinson sang a nice rendition
of "Driving Wheel," a blues
standard. He was actually the only
decent singer to be heard all night.
I don't see why Mayall insists on
singing every song. As a matter of
fact, I think the best improvement
this group could make would be
to fire its leader.

As a pianist, Mayall is flawless,
but a good jazz and blues group
has no room for ego trips (like
Mayall). And, as far as the
harmonica is concerned, Mayall is
pretty lame when compared to
any competent blues harpmen.
Unfortunately, Mayall hardly ever
takes his harp out of his mouth
except to sing, and I'm not sure
which is worse.
One Encore
The rest of the set included a
good twelve-bar waltz called
"Getting Down," a nice slow
blues, and the group's
show-stopper, "Good Time
Boogie." They came back to do
one encore, after the crowd nearly
knocked down the flimsy stage.
Needless to say, all of the
musicians in Mayall's band were
excellent throughout, most
especially trumpeter Blue
Mitchell, the best trumpet player
I've ever heard.
John Mayall's two newest LPs
feature this band line-up more or
less, and in my opinion they're
the best he has recorded in many
moons. They are: "Jazz Blues
Fusion" and "Moving On"—both
are live, and both are on Polydor.

et. al.), Blue Mitchell on trumpet
(formerly with Earl Bostic for
one), and guitarist Freddie
Robinson, who has played with
such names as Ray Charles, Jerry
Butler, and Howlin' Wolf. All
four, with the exception of
Gaskin, have albums out under
their own names. (Mitchell has a
total of nine LPs on the market at

present.)
Back on drums was Keef
Hartley who played with Mayall
for a long time before forming
The Keef Hartley Band, which has
four or five albums on Deram.
Mayall, of course, was on piano,
harmonica, and lead vocals.
Nothing Fancy
When the PA system was
finally straightened out, Mayall
asked the light man to just turn
up all the stage lights and leave
them that way, "no fancy stuff."
That sounded reasonable to me,
but for some reason the lighting
man insisted on experimenting
around all night.
Mayall's first two numbers
were loosely improvised jams,
which I imagine left much of the
audience cold, who wanted some
foot stomping. But, after that
things got much better.
Robinson sang a nice rendition
of "Driving Wheel," a blues
standard. He was actually the only
decent singer to be heard all night.
I don't see why Mayall insists on
singing every song. As a matter of
fact, I think the best improvement
this group could make would be
to fire its leader.

As a pianist, Mayall is flawless,
but a good jazz and blues group
has no room for ego trips (like
Mayall). And, as far as the
harmonica is concerned, Mayall is
pretty lame when compared to
any competent blues harpmen.
Unfortunately, Mayall hardly ever
takes his harp out of his mouth
except to sing, and I'm not sure
which is worse.
One Encore
The rest of the set included a
good twelve-bar waltz called
"Getting Down," a nice slow
blues, and the group's
show-stopper, "Good Time
Boogie." They came back to do
one encore, after the crowd nearly
knocked down the flimsy stage.
Needless to say, all of the
musicians in Mayall's band were
excellent throughout, most
especially trumpeter Blue
Mitchell, the best trumpet player
I've ever heard.
John Mayall's two newest LPs
feature this band line-up more or
less, and in my opinion they're
the best he has recorded in many
moons. They are: "Jazz Blues
Fusion" and "Moving On"—both
are live, and both are on Polydor.

FRIDAY PERFORMANCE—On April 6, Mark-Almond (above) and John Mayall performed in Maples
Pavilion. For a review of the show, see article above.
I suppose comparisons between
the John Mayall and
Mark-Almond bands, who
performed at Maples Pavilion
Friday, April 6, are inevitable,
because it is very seldom that
two such capable bands with so
many notable musicians play on
the same show. But to compare
the two musical styles would be
out of place, since each group
plays a different type of music
with a different purpose in mind.
Friday night's show started at
8:05 with Mark-Almond. The
group's two leaders, Jon Mark
(electric-acoustic guitar and

vocals) and Johnny Almond
(saxophone, flute, organ), were
formerly members of Mayall's
band. They appeared on the
"Turning Point" LP which is
probably Mayall's most
commercially successful album.
The rest of the group included
Geoff Condon on trumpet and
electric piano, Wolfgang Welz on
bass, Bobby Torres on congas, and
Alun Da vies on rhythm guitar,
who has released a solo album
entitled "Daydo." On drums was
the highly respected Dannie
Richmond, who has played for
several years with jazz bassist

Charlie Mingus, and appears on
many of his albums.
Encore
Mark-Almond played four
songs during their set and were
brought back for an encore; about
an hour in all. There were quite a
few cheers from the crowd when
they started "The City," which
spotlighted Almond's saxophone.
Their live version of "What Am I
Living For?" was far superior to
the recording on their new
Columbia LP, "Rising," as was
their whole performance in
general.
Mark dedicated the last
number to John Mayall. This one

featured extended solos by
everyone. It was highlighted by an
amazing drum solo by Richmond,
showing why he was once voted
"Best Drummer" in Downbeat's
Jazz Musicians Poll. (Richmond,
by the way, has two LPs out with
his own bands.)
Almond and Richmond were
the only jazz musicians in the
group; the rest being influenced
by rock and folk.
The group's encore was their
worst song of the night, but I
found their overall performance
to be a pleasant surprise, after
hearing their three albums.
When John Mayall and his

group took the stage there were
the usual PA system hassles which
have come to be expected at
Maples.
Mayall has always been known
for his constantly-changing band
personnel, having members leave
his group to later become famous;
Eric Clapton, Peter Green, Mick
Taylor, Jack Bruce, Mark and
Almond. But this is the first time
(with the exception of the "USA
Union" LP) that he has collected
a band of already-established
musicians.
Four members of the group are
black American jazz veterans;
Victor Gaskin on string bass
(formerly with Les McCann, Mose
Allison, and Cannonball Adderly,
among others), Red Holloway on
electric tenor sax (previously with
Billie Holiday, Duke Ellington,
et. al.), Blue Mitchell on trumpet
(formerly with Earl Bostic for
one), and guitarist Freddie
Robinson, who has played with
such names as Ray Charles, Jerry
Butler, and Howlin' Wolf. All
four, with the exception of
Gaskin, have albums out under
their own names. (Mitchell has a

the two musical styles would be
out of place, since each group
plays a different type of music
with a different purpose in mind.
Friday night's show started at
8:05 with Mark-Almond. The
group's two leaders, Jon Mark
(electric-acoustic guitar and

vocals) and Johnny Almond
(saxophone, flute, organ), were
formerly members of Mayall's
band. They appeared on the
"Turning Point" LP which is
probably Mayall's most
commercially successful album.
The rest of the group included
Geoff Condon on trumpet and
electric piano, Wolfgang Welz on
bass, Bobby Torres on congas, and
Alun Da vies on rhythm guitar,
who has released a solo album
entitled "Daydo." On drums was
the highly respected Dannie
Richmond, who has played for
several years with jazz bassist

Charlie Mingus, and appears on
many of his albums.
Encore
Mark-Almond played four
songs during their set and were
brought back for an encore; about
an hour in all. There were quite a
few cheers from the crowd when
they started "The City," which
spotlighted Almond's saxophone.
Their live version of "What Am I
Living For?" was far superior to
the recording on their new
Columbia LP, "Rising," as was
their whole performance in
general.
Mark dedicated the last
number to John Mayall. This one

featured extended solos by
everyone. It was highlighted by an
amazing drum solo by Richmond,
showing why he was once voted
"Best Drummer" in Downbeat's
Jazz Musicians Poll. (Richmond,
by the way, has two LPs out with
his own bands.)
Almond and Richmond were
the only jazz musicians in the
group; the rest being influenced
by rock and folk.
The group's encore was their
worst song of the night, but I
found their overall performance
to be a pleasant surprise, after
hearing their three albums.
When John Mayall and his

group took the stage there were
the usual PA system hassles which
have come to be expected at
Maples.
Mayall has always been known
for his constantly-changing band
personnel, having members leave
his group to later become famous;
Eric Clapton, Peter Green, Mick
Taylor, Jack Bruce, Mark and
Almond. But this is the first time
(with the exception of the "USA
Union" LP) that he has collected
a band of already-established
musicians.
Four members of the group are
black American jazz veterans;
Victor Gaskin on string bass
(formerly with Les McCann, Mose
Allison, and Cannonball Adderly,
among others), Red Holloway on
electric tenor sax (previously with
Billie Holiday, Duke Ellington,
et. al.), Blue Mitchell on trumpet
(formerly with Earl Bostic for
one), and guitarist Freddie
Robinson, who has played with
such names as Ray Charles, Jerry
Butler, and Howlin' Wolf. All
four, with the exception of
Gaskin, have albums out under
their own names. (Mitchell has a
total of nine LPs on the market at

present.)
Back on drums was Keef
Hartley who played with Mayall
for a long time before forming
The Keef Hartley Band, which has
four or five albums on Deram.
Mayall, of course, was on piano,
harmonica, and lead vocals.
Nothing Fancy
When the PA system was
finally straightened out, Mayall
asked the light man to just turn
up all the stage lights and leave
them that way, "no fancy stuff."
That sounded reasonable to me,
but for some reason the lighting
man insisted on experimenting
around all night.
Mayall's first two numbers
were loosely improvised jams,
which I imagine left much of the
audience cold, who wanted some
foot stomping. But, after that
things got much better.
Robinson sang a nice rendition
of "Driving Wheel," a blues
standard. He was actually the only
decent singer to be heard all night.
I don't see why Mayall insists on
singing every song. As a matter of
fact, I think the best improvement
this group could make would be
to fire its leader.

As a pianist, Mayall is flawless,
but a good jazz and blues group
has no room for ego trips (like
Mayall). And, as far as the
harmonica is concerned, Mayall is
pretty lame when compared to
any competent blues harpmen.
Unfortunately, Mayall hardly ever
takes his harp out of his mouth
except to sing, and I'm not sure
which is worse.
One Encore
The rest of the set included a
good twelve-bar waltz called
"Getting Down," a nice slow
blues, and the group's
show-stopper, "Good Time
Boogie." They came back to do
one encore, after the crowd nearly
knocked down the flimsy stage.
Needless to say, all of the
musicians in Mayall's band were
excellent throughout, most
especially trumpeter Blue
Mitchell, the best trumpet player
I've ever heard.
John Mayall's two newest LPs
feature this band line-up more or
less, and in my opinion they're
the best he has recorded in many
moons. They are: "Jazz Blues
Fusion" and "Moving On"—both
are live, and both are on Polydor.

FRIDAY PERFORMANCE—On April 6, Mark-Almond (above) and John Mayall performed in Maples
Pavilion. For a review of the show, see article above.
I suppose comparisons between
the John Mayall and
Mark-Almond bands, who
performed at Maples Pavilion
Friday, April 6, are inevitable,
because it is very seldom that
two such capable bands with so
many notable musicians play on
the same show. But to compare
the two musical styles would be
out of place, since each group
plays a different type of music
with a different purpose in mind.
