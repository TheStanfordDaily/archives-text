# Santana Disappoints At Winterland
## 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
One of the biggest influences in rock music
has been the "San Francisco Sound," which
was born in the middle and late 60's. The
legendary flower children days were a bit
exaggerated, but no one can deny that a
number of extremely important groups got
their start in those times.
Listing all these groups would be
impossible, but the Jefferson Airplane, Big
Brother and the Holding Company,
Quicksilver Messenger Service and the
Grateful Dead were among the most
acclaimed groups. But in the late 60s, one
group brought a refreshingly new dimensin to
the "San Francisco Sound." Out of San
Francisco's Mission District came Santana and
with them they brought Latin Rock, which
was one of the most welcome additions to the
rock world in many years.
Santana was comprised of vastly talented
individuals who blended their talents into a
wide range of musical forms. They could
move effortlessly from truly mellow and
melodious numbers to intense rockers. With
their kind of talent, they had little difficulty
pouring out a steady stream of hits which
included "Evil Ways," "Black Magic Woman,"
"Jingo Rock," "Everybody's Everything" and
"No One To Depend On."
Personality Conflicts
But as often happens in a business full of
turmoil and change, Santana ran into some of
the same kinds of problems which have
damaged so many other groups. Rumors of
personality conflicts, personnel changes and
drug problems were frequently aired over the
past year or so and the group faded out of the
public eye.
Last Friday after a long absence, Santana
returned to Winterland. Somehow, things just

weren't the same. The individual talents were
still evident, but they combined into a kind of
music which fell far short of what made
Santana famous.
As could be expected, Santana's arrival on
stage was met by considerable screaming and
applause from a wildly expectant crowd. I
think much of the crowd shared my desire for
at least a taste of the old Santana we loved,
but for the next two hours our wishes were to
be unfulfilled.
After a moment of silent meditation, the
band launched into a virtually unbroken
number which lasted for almost 1 hour and 40
minutes and which was punctuated by only
the briefest of pauses. The music was
extremely mystical and those people who
crave "heaviness, because it's heavy," would
probably say it was music of a "higher
consciousness." But at least for me, it didn't
make it, and judging by the large number of
people who left before the number was over, I
wasn't alone.
Flashes of Brilliance
I was particularly disappointed because
Santana showed only flashes of their old
brilliance. At times, they started leaning
towards some familiar melodies, but they
would abruptly break off into another
free-form tangent. Carlos Santana, who is one
of the finest rock guitarists I have ever heard,
was strangely subordinate and subdued during
the set. Perhaps the kind of strong leadership
he once displayed is what is most lacking.
But at times, Carlos still played like he
once did, as did almost everyone else in the
band, including drummer Mike Shrieve, who
performed an outstanding solo. But
unfortunately, the talent seemed to be vastly
under-utilized. Santana just seemed to be
floating around, looking unsuccessfully for

something to grasp on to. The talent is still
there, but right now, this isn't the group I
once really respected and loved.
Santana was preceded by some good news
and some bad news. Bobby Wornack and
Peace was neither peaceful nor terribly
talented, but Focus showed a unique kind of
promise.
The highlight of Womack's set came when
his four horn players strutted around the stage
with two of them twirling their trumpets like
batons. Unfortunately, the band twirled
better than it played. Womack uttered just
about every rock cliche during his set
including "it's gonna be a good night," "is
everyone felling alright?' and the irrepressible
"clap your hands." I've always wondered why
anybody tries to ask an audience to clap. Most
people know how to clap and if the music is
good, they will. Womack did one or two good,
soulful numbers, but the others were all
equally undistinguished.
Indescribable Organist
Focus is a four man English group which
was billed third, but which played after
Womack because their equipment had been
misplaced. They didn't get to play for too
long, but they were quite entertaining. Focus
has an indescribable organ player who has to
be seen to be either appreciated or believed.
The organist goes from singing in a falsetto
to yodeling to making George Carlin type
noises while playing a pretty decent organ.
The group has a fine lead guitarist who played
strongly and clearly. The group gets into some
nice, melodic passages, but the organ player is
a show in himself. Focus will appear on "In
Concert" Friday night along with the Bee
Gees, J. Geils and Steely Dan—(ll:3o
p.m.-Channel7).

of the finest rock guitarists I have ever heard,
was strangely subordinate and subdued during
the set. Perhaps the kind of strong leadership
he once displayed is what is most lacking.
But at times, Carlos still played like he
once did, as did almost everyone else in the
band, including drummer Mike Shrieve, who
performed an outstanding solo. But
unfortunately, the talent seemed to be vastly
under-utilized. Santana just seemed to be
floating around, looking unsuccessfully for

something to grasp on to. The talent is still
there, but right now, this isn't the group I
once really respected and loved.
Santana was preceded by some good news
and some bad news. Bobby Wornack and
Peace was neither peaceful nor terribly
talented, but Focus showed a unique kind of
promise.
The highlight of Womack's set came when
his four horn players strutted around the stage
with two of them twirling their trumpets like
batons. Unfortunately, the band twirled
better than it played. Womack uttered just
about every rock cliche during his set
including "it's gonna be a good night," "is
everyone felling alright?' and the irrepressible
"clap your hands." I've always wondered why
anybody tries to ask an audience to clap. Most
people know how to clap and if the music is
good, they will. Womack did one or two good,
soulful numbers, but the others were all
equally undistinguished.
Indescribable Organist
Focus is a four man English group which
was billed third, but which played after
Womack because their equipment had been
misplaced. They didn't get to play for too
long, but they were quite entertaining. Focus
has an indescribable organ player who has to
be seen to be either appreciated or believed.
The organist goes from singing in a falsetto
to yodeling to making George Carlin type
noises while playing a pretty decent organ.
The group has a fine lead guitarist who played
strongly and clearly. The group gets into some
nice, melodic passages, but the organ player is
a show in himself. Focus will appear on "In
Concert" Friday night along with the Bee
Gees, J. Geils and Steely Dan—(ll:3o
p.m.-Channel7).
One of the biggest influences in rock music
has been the "San Francisco Sound," which
was born in the middle and late 60's. The
legendary flower children days were a bit
exaggerated, but no one can deny that a
number of extremely important groups got
their start in those times.
Listing all these groups would be
impossible, but the Jefferson Airplane, Big
Brother and the Holding Company,
Quicksilver Messenger Service and the
Grateful Dead were among the most
acclaimed groups. But in the late 60s, one
group brought a refreshingly new dimensin to
the "San Francisco Sound." Out of San
Francisco's Mission District came Santana and
with them they brought Latin Rock, which
was one of the most welcome additions to the
rock world in many years.
Santana was comprised of vastly talented
individuals who blended their talents into a
wide range of musical forms. They could
move effortlessly from truly mellow and
melodious numbers to intense rockers. With
their kind of talent, they had little difficulty
pouring out a steady stream of hits which
included "Evil Ways," "Black Magic Woman,"
"Jingo Rock," "Everybody's Everything" and
"No One To Depend On."
Personality Conflicts
But as often happens in a business full of
turmoil and change, Santana ran into some of
the same kinds of problems which have
damaged so many other groups. Rumors of
personality conflicts, personnel changes and
drug problems were frequently aired over the
past year or so and the group faded out of the
public eye.
Last Friday after a long absence, Santana
returned to Winterland. Somehow, things just

weren't the same. The individual talents were
still evident, but they combined into a kind of
music which fell far short of what made
Santana famous.
As could be expected, Santana's arrival on
stage was met by considerable screaming and
applause from a wildly expectant crowd. I
think much of the crowd shared my desire for
at least a taste of the old Santana we loved,
but for the next two hours our wishes were to
be unfulfilled.
After a moment of silent meditation, the
band launched into a virtually unbroken
number which lasted for almost 1 hour and 40
minutes and which was punctuated by only
the briefest of pauses. The music was
extremely mystical and those people who
crave "heaviness, because it's heavy," would
probably say it was music of a "higher
consciousness." But at least for me, it didn't
make it, and judging by the large number of
people who left before the number was over, I
wasn't alone.
Flashes of Brilliance
I was particularly disappointed because
Santana showed only flashes of their old
brilliance. At times, they started leaning
towards some familiar melodies, but they
would abruptly break off into another
free-form tangent. Carlos Santana, who is one
of the finest rock guitarists I have ever heard,
was strangely subordinate and subdued during
the set. Perhaps the kind of strong leadership

Francisco's Mission District came Santana and
with them they brought Latin Rock, which
was one of the most welcome additions to the
rock world in many years.
Santana was comprised of vastly talented
individuals who blended their talents into a
wide range of musical forms. They could
move effortlessly from truly mellow and
melodious numbers to intense rockers. With
their kind of talent, they had little difficulty
pouring out a steady stream of hits which
included "Evil Ways," "Black Magic Woman,"
"Jingo Rock," "Everybody's Everything" and
"No One To Depend On."
Personality Conflicts
But as often happens in a business full of
turmoil and change, Santana ran into some of
the same kinds of problems which have
damaged so many other groups. Rumors of
personality conflicts, personnel changes and
drug problems were frequently aired over the
past year or so and the group faded out of the
public eye.
Last Friday after a long absence, Santana
returned to Winterland. Somehow, things just

weren't the same. The individual talents were
still evident, but they combined into a kind of
music which fell far short of what made
Santana famous.
As could be expected, Santana's arrival on
stage was met by considerable screaming and
applause from a wildly expectant crowd. I
think much of the crowd shared my desire for
at least a taste of the old Santana we loved,
but for the next two hours our wishes were to
be unfulfilled.
After a moment of silent meditation, the
band launched into a virtually unbroken
number which lasted for almost 1 hour and 40
minutes and which was punctuated by only
the briefest of pauses. The music was
extremely mystical and those people who
crave "heaviness, because it's heavy," would
probably say it was music of a "higher
consciousness." But at least for me, it didn't
make it, and judging by the large number of
people who left before the number was over, I
wasn't alone.
Flashes of Brilliance
I was particularly disappointed because
Santana showed only flashes of their old
brilliance. At times, they started leaning
towards some familiar melodies, but they
would abruptly break off into another
free-form tangent. Carlos Santana, who is one
of the finest rock guitarists I have ever heard,
was strangely subordinate and subdued during
the set. Perhaps the kind of strong leadership
he once displayed is what is most lacking.
But at times, Carlos still played like he
once did, as did almost everyone else in the
band, including drummer Mike Shrieve, who
performed an outstanding solo. But
unfortunately, the talent seemed to be vastly
under-utilized. Santana just seemed to be
floating around, looking unsuccessfully for

something to grasp on to. The talent is still
there, but right now, this isn't the group I
once really respected and loved.
Santana was preceded by some good news
and some bad news. Bobby Wornack and
Peace was neither peaceful nor terribly
talented, but Focus showed a unique kind of
promise.
The highlight of Womack's set came when
his four horn players strutted around the stage
with two of them twirling their trumpets like
batons. Unfortunately, the band twirled
better than it played. Womack uttered just
about every rock cliche during his set
including "it's gonna be a good night," "is
everyone felling alright?' and the irrepressible
"clap your hands." I've always wondered why
anybody tries to ask an audience to clap. Most
people know how to clap and if the music is
good, they will. Womack did one or two good,
soulful numbers, but the others were all
equally undistinguished.
Indescribable Organist
Focus is a four man English group which
was billed third, but which played after
Womack because their equipment had been
misplaced. They didn't get to play for too
long, but they were quite entertaining. Focus
has an indescribable organ player who has to
be seen to be either appreciated or believed.
The organist goes from singing in a falsetto
to yodeling to making George Carlin type
noises while playing a pretty decent organ.
The group has a fine lead guitarist who played
strongly and clearly. The group gets into some
nice, melodic passages, but the organ player is
a show in himself. Focus will appear on "In
Concert" Friday night along with the Bee
Gees, J. Geils and Steely Dan—(ll:3o
p.m.-Channel7).
