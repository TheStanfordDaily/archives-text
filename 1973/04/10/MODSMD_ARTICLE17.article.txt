AIM Fighters Called 'Goons'
WASHINGTON — Indian activist Russell Means was
accused at a congressional hearing yesterday of leading a
"group of goons" during the seizure of historic Wounded
Knee.
Means ignored the personal comments by Rep. James
A. Haley (D-Fla.), a member of the House Indian Affairs
subcommittee that is holding hearings on Wounded Knee
and the seizure of the Bureau of Affairs last year.
"How do you figure you have a perfect right ... to go
out and break the law? If you and your bunch of
hoodlums go out and destroy property how are you going
to reimburse those people for it?" Haley asked.
The AIM leader responded that arrangements had been
made to pay Wounded Knee residents for any property
damage by the militants.
Means' followers at Wounded Knee were still holding
on to their weapons yesterday, ignoring government
appeals to surrender them.
The Indians say they will not lay down their arms until
progress is made in negotiations on Indian treaties.
The government, however, says there will be no further
talks until the arms are turned over to marshals.
Meanwhile, at the Capitol, the House Indian affairs
subcommittee, an Oglaga Sioux tribal officer stated: "The
issue at Wounded Knee is jobs. Give us jobs and you won't
have any Indian problems."
About 60 percent of the Oglala Sioux Indians are
unemployed, the officer said.
Missile Downed Cease-Fire Craft
SAIGON — \ Canadian peacekeeping investigator charged
yesterday that a ceasefire commission helicopter was shot
down in flames by a heat-seeking missile while flying over
Viet Cong-held territory in South Vietnam.
Maj. Gen. Duncan McAlpine sharply disputed a Viet
Cong claim that the helicopter met with an accident in
which nine of its passengers, including a Canadian and two
American civilian pilots, were killed Saturday.
"An accident?" McAlpine snapped. "Surely, with
everyone in the area knowing this was an approved flight,
and with verbatim reports of the survivors, I think
otherwise.
"The fact is that the helicopter . .. did in fact sustain a
heat-seeker."
The helicopter was on a mission in South Vietnam's
northwest corner for the International Commission of
Control and Supervision—lCCS. Among the dead were
four commission members, three crewmen and two Viet
Cong liaison officers.
A second commission helicopter was hit by "sustained
ground fire" and made a forced landing near the first in
what McAlpine called "desperate circumstances." Its 11
passengers and crew were not hurt.
In Washington, a White House spokesman said
President Nixon views the attacks on clearly marked ICCS
helicopters as "extremely serious." The State Department
said the incident was a "totally callous flaunting" of the
ceasefire agreement.

In neighboring Cambodia, it was reported that the
United States has doubled its air shipments of military
equipment since the beginning of the Communist
offensive early in February.
"Although there has been a slight acceleration of
deliveries, there has been no increase that could remotely
be called an airlift," a U.S. Embassy spokesman said.
Russo Weeps During Testimony
LOS ANGELES — Anthony J. Russo, weeping at one
point as he spoke of the suffering of the Vietnamese,
testified in his own defense Monday, telling how Daniel
Ellsberg enlisted him to copy the Pentagon Papers.
Russo, in less than three hours of direct testimony,
explained how he and Ellsberg became close friends,
drawn together by their increasing doubts about the
validity of U.S. policies in Vietnam. He told of their days
together in Vietnam working as researchers on
government projects for the Rand Corp.
After Russo left Rand in early 1969, he said, he and
Ellsberg continued seeing each other socially, frequently
talking about the war. At one such talk, on the beach
outside Ellsberg's Malibu, Calif., apartment, Russo said, "I
remarked to Dan that I had seen a very definite pattern of
lying and deception and alteration of facts by the U.S.
government in Vietnam .... Dan said he had come to
much the same conclusion."
Ellsberg, he said, mentioned a "study he was reading"
which revealed similar conclusions.
The defendant contended that although he had heard
of the Pentagon Papers study in 1968, he had never seen it
before he copied it and did not know that Ellsberg had
contributed to it. He indicated he did not read any of the
material or know what it was before he came to Ellsberg's
assistance.
Earlier, Russo began weeping as he told jurors the story
of a North Vietnamese while interviewing captured
prisoners for a research study.
Russo, calling the prisoner "the strongest man I ever
met," dropped his head and wiped his eyes as he told the
story to jurors. Then, laughing through his tears, he said,
"See, even now when I talk about it, it comes back to
me.
The 36-year-old defendant told the story to illustrate
the experiences which transformed him from an
"establishment" researcher on government projects to a
vehement antiwar activist.
Mississippi Flood "Squeezed 9
NEW ORLEANS — Army flood control experts said
Monday one of the century's great Mississippi River floods
was still safely squeezed within the levees — but they're
girding for higher water.
"I can't tell you now whether we're peaking out or
whether we're going to get a worse situation before we're
through," said Maj. Gen. Charles C. Noble, president of
the Mississippi River Commission.
Much depends on the runoff from thawing snows and
spring rains in the river's 1.24 million-square-mile
watershed area, especially along the Ohio, he said.
He estimated that backwater from the river's choked
tributaries has temporarily forced some 6000 families
from their homes — mainly in sections near St. Louis,
Mo., and in Mississippi.

Russo Weeps During Testimony
LOS ANGELES — Anthony J. Russo, weeping at one
point as he spoke of the suffering of the Vietnamese,
testified in his own defense Monday, telling how Daniel
Ellsberg enlisted him to copy the Pentagon Papers.
Russo, in less than three hours of direct testimony,
explained how he and Ellsberg became close friends,
drawn together by their increasing doubts about the
validity of U.S. policies in Vietnam. He told of their days
together in Vietnam working as researchers on
government projects for the Rand Corp.
After Russo left Rand in early 1969, he said, he and
Ellsberg continued seeing each other socially, frequently
talking about the war. At one such talk, on the beach
outside Ellsberg's Malibu, Calif., apartment, Russo said, "I
remarked to Dan that I had seen a very definite pattern of
lying and deception and alteration of facts by the U.S.
government in Vietnam .... Dan said he had come to
much the same conclusion."
Ellsberg, he said, mentioned a "study he was reading"
which revealed similar conclusions.
The defendant contended that although he had heard
of the Pentagon Papers study in 1968, he had never seen it
before he copied it and did not know that Ellsberg had
contributed to it. He indicated he did not read any of the
material or know what it was before he came to Ellsberg's
assistance.
Earlier, Russo began weeping as he told jurors the story
of a North Vietnamese while interviewing captured
prisoners for a research study.
Russo, calling the prisoner "the strongest man I ever
met," dropped his head and wiped his eyes as he told the
story to jurors. Then, laughing through his tears, he said,
"See, even now when I talk about it, it comes back to
me.
The 36-year-old defendant told the story to illustrate
the experiences which transformed him from an
"establishment" researcher on government projects to a
vehement antiwar activist.
Mississippi Flood "Squeezed 9
NEW ORLEANS — Army flood control experts said
Monday one of the century's great Mississippi River floods
was still safely squeezed within the levees — but they're
girding for higher water.
"I can't tell you now whether we're peaking out or
whether we're going to get a worse situation before we're
through," said Maj. Gen. Charles C. Noble, president of
the Mississippi River Commission.
Much depends on the runoff from thawing snows and
spring rains in the river's 1.24 million-square-mile
watershed area, especially along the Ohio, he said.
He estimated that backwater from the river's choked
tributaries has temporarily forced some 6000 families
from their homes — mainly in sections near St. Louis,
Mo., and in Mississippi.

AIM Fighters Called 'Goons'
WASHINGTON — Indian activist Russell Means was
accused at a congressional hearing yesterday of leading a
"group of goons" during the seizure of historic Wounded
Knee.
Means ignored the personal comments by Rep. James
A. Haley (D-Fla.), a member of the House Indian Affairs
subcommittee that is holding hearings on Wounded Knee
and the seizure of the Bureau of Affairs last year.
"How do you figure you have a perfect right ... to go
out and break the law? If you and your bunch of
hoodlums go out and destroy property how are you going
to reimburse those people for it?" Haley asked.
The AIM leader responded that arrangements had been
made to pay Wounded Knee residents for any property
damage by the militants.
Means' followers at Wounded Knee were still holding
on to their weapons yesterday, ignoring government
appeals to surrender them.
The Indians say they will not lay down their arms until
progress is made in negotiations on Indian treaties.
The government, however, says there will be no further
talks until the arms are turned over to marshals.
Meanwhile, at the Capitol, the House Indian affairs
subcommittee, an Oglaga Sioux tribal officer stated: "The
issue at Wounded Knee is jobs. Give us jobs and you won't
have any Indian problems."
About 60 percent of the Oglala Sioux Indians are
unemployed, the officer said.
Missile Downed Cease-Fire Craft
SAIGON — \ Canadian peacekeeping investigator charged
yesterday that a ceasefire commission helicopter was shot
down in flames by a heat-seeking missile while flying over
Viet Cong-held territory in South Vietnam.
Maj. Gen. Duncan McAlpine sharply disputed a Viet
Cong claim that the helicopter met with an accident in
which nine of its passengers, including a Canadian and two
American civilian pilots, were killed Saturday.
"An accident?" McAlpine snapped. "Surely, with
everyone in the area knowing this was an approved flight,
and with verbatim reports of the survivors, I think
otherwise.
"The fact is that the helicopter . .. did in fact sustain a
heat-seeker."
The helicopter was on a mission in South Vietnam's
northwest corner for the International Commission of
Control and Supervision—lCCS. Among the dead were
four commission members, three crewmen and two Viet
Cong liaison officers.
A second commission helicopter was hit by "sustained
ground fire" and made a forced landing near the first in

Mississippi Flood "Squeezed 9
NEW ORLEANS — Army flood control experts said
Monday one of the century's great Mississippi River floods
was still safely squeezed within the levees — but they're
girding for higher water.
"I can't tell you now whether we're peaking out or
whether we're going to get a worse situation before we're
through," said Maj. Gen. Charles C. Noble, president of
the Mississippi River Commission.
Much depends on the runoff from thawing snows and
spring rains in the river's 1.24 million-square-mile
watershed area, especially along the Ohio, he said.
He estimated that backwater from the river's choked
tributaries has temporarily forced some 6000 families
from their homes — mainly in sections near St. Louis,
Mo., and in Mississippi.

AIM Fighters Called 'Goons'
WASHINGTON — Indian activist Russell Means was
accused at a congressional hearing yesterday of leading a
"group of goons" during the seizure of historic Wounded
Knee.
Means ignored the personal comments by Rep. James
A. Haley (D-Fla.), a member of the House Indian Affairs
subcommittee that is holding hearings on Wounded Knee
and the seizure of the Bureau of Affairs last year.
"How do you figure you have a perfect right ... to go
out and break the law? If you and your bunch of
hoodlums go out and destroy property how are you going
to reimburse those people for it?" Haley asked.
The AIM leader responded that arrangements had been
made to pay Wounded Knee residents for any property
damage by the militants.
Means' followers at Wounded Knee were still holding
on to their weapons yesterday, ignoring government
appeals to surrender them.
The Indians say they will not lay down their arms until
progress is made in negotiations on Indian treaties.
The government, however, says there will be no further
talks until the arms are turned over to marshals.
Meanwhile, at the Capitol, the House Indian affairs
subcommittee, an Oglaga Sioux tribal officer stated: "The
issue at Wounded Knee is jobs. Give us jobs and you won't
have any Indian problems."
About 60 percent of the Oglala Sioux Indians are
unemployed, the officer said.
Missile Downed Cease-Fire Craft
SAIGON — \ Canadian peacekeeping investigator charged
yesterday that a ceasefire commission helicopter was shot
down in flames by a heat-seeking missile while flying over
Viet Cong-held territory in South Vietnam.
Maj. Gen. Duncan McAlpine sharply disputed a Viet
Cong claim that the helicopter met with an accident in
which nine of its passengers, including a Canadian and two
American civilian pilots, were killed Saturday.
"An accident?" McAlpine snapped. "Surely, with
everyone in the area knowing this was an approved flight,
and with verbatim reports of the survivors, I think
otherwise.
"The fact is that the helicopter . .. did in fact sustain a
heat-seeker."
The helicopter was on a mission in South Vietnam's
northwest corner for the International Commission of
Control and Supervision—lCCS. Among the dead were
four commission members, three crewmen and two Viet
Cong liaison officers.
A second commission helicopter was hit by "sustained
ground fire" and made a forced landing near the first in
what McAlpine called "desperate circumstances." Its 11
passengers and crew were not hurt.
In Washington, a White House spokesman said
President Nixon views the attacks on clearly marked ICCS
helicopters as "extremely serious." The State Department
said the incident was a "totally callous flaunting" of the
ceasefire agreement.

In neighboring Cambodia, it was reported that the
United States has doubled its air shipments of military
equipment since the beginning of the Communist
offensive early in February.
"Although there has been a slight acceleration of
deliveries, there has been no increase that could remotely
be called an airlift," a U.S. Embassy spokesman said.
Russo Weeps During Testimony
LOS ANGELES — Anthony J. Russo, weeping at one
point as he spoke of the suffering of the Vietnamese,
testified in his own defense Monday, telling how Daniel
Ellsberg enlisted him to copy the Pentagon Papers.
Russo, in less than three hours of direct testimony,
explained how he and Ellsberg became close friends,
drawn together by their increasing doubts about the
validity of U.S. policies in Vietnam. He told of their days
together in Vietnam working as researchers on
government projects for the Rand Corp.
After Russo left Rand in early 1969, he said, he and
Ellsberg continued seeing each other socially, frequently
talking about the war. At one such talk, on the beach
outside Ellsberg's Malibu, Calif., apartment, Russo said, "I
remarked to Dan that I had seen a very definite pattern of
lying and deception and alteration of facts by the U.S.
government in Vietnam .... Dan said he had come to
much the same conclusion."
Ellsberg, he said, mentioned a "study he was reading"
which revealed similar conclusions.
The defendant contended that although he had heard
of the Pentagon Papers study in 1968, he had never seen it
before he copied it and did not know that Ellsberg had
contributed to it. He indicated he did not read any of the
material or know what it was before he came to Ellsberg's
assistance.
Earlier, Russo began weeping as he told jurors the story
of a North Vietnamese while interviewing captured
prisoners for a research study.
Russo, calling the prisoner "the strongest man I ever
met," dropped his head and wiped his eyes as he told the
story to jurors. Then, laughing through his tears, he said,
"See, even now when I talk about it, it comes back to
me.
The 36-year-old defendant told the story to illustrate
