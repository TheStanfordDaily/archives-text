# Newman Report Gains Favor, Skepticism From Administrators
## 
### LARRY FLEECE 
In response to a recently-published
federal report on graduate education,
campus administrators have voiced
general approval concerning the intent
of the report's recommendations, but
expressed mild skepticism as to its
methods.
The report, t prepared by a
nine-member task force established by
the Department of Health, Education,
and Welfare headed by Stanford
Director of University Relations Frank
Newman, recommends that graduate
students receive financial grants and
fellowships directly from the
government rather than through their
universities.
According to the Newman group,
there is presently in graduate
education "a costly oversupply of
graduates in some fields [e.g. the
Ed.D., and in many fields of the
Ph.D.], and a chronic undersupply of
graduates in other fields" (e.g. the
health professions).
As a result, the Newman report
proposes that the government
distribute most fellowships "on the
basis of intellectual and creative
promise," without tying them to
particular fields of study or
institutions.
It further proposes that federal
funding for education should place a
greater emphasis on the "national
priorities," and should take into
account the "contribution the

graduate will make to society after
completing graduate work."
Unclear Guidelines
But Assoc. Dean of Graduate
Studies J. Merrill Carlsmith, while
calling this a "laudable goal," suspects
that the "criteria are a little bit
vague." Carlsmith said that in his
reading of the Newman report he
"didn't see any clear evidence that
they know exactly how to administer
the criteria they set up for graduate
fellowships."
Nevertheless, Carlsmith said, he is
"generally in support of the Newman
report" as a possible solution to avoid
further federal cutbacks to graduate
education. "It is terribly important to
avoid further cutbacks, which would
be disastrous to our own graduate
program," Carlsmith said.
He pointed out that the graduate
program at Stanford has been cut back
approximately 30 percent over the
past four years, largely due to the
cutback in federal funding resulting
from the national increase in unplaced
Ph.D.s.
Emphasis Rechannelled
For this reason, Carlsmith said, the
Newman proposals have "great
potential merit," since they attempt to
rechannel the emphasis of graduate
programs toward areas of national
need, such as the health professions.
Prof. Lewis Mayhew of the School
of Education agrees with the Newman
recommendations. In a report he
prepared for the Carnegie Commission

on Higher Education entitled
"Graduate and Professional
Education: 1980," Mayhew predicted
that by 1980 the U.S. will be awarding
67-70,000 doctorates annually, while
the most the nation will possibly be
able to use is 20-25,000.
Mayhew therefore supports the
Newman recommendations for a
concentration on "quality" over
"quantity" in graduate education.
Mayhew suggested that "not over 100
institutions" offer degrees at the
doctoral level. Presently, he said, the
figure is much closer to 200, and
including Masters' level work, close to
1000 institutions.
'Portable' Fellowships Urged
In order to promote the excellence
of graduate education, the Newman
report's proposal for individual
"portable" fellowship awards seems to
Mayhew "entirely workable."
But Mayhew confessed his doubts
about the criteria which the Newman
report seeks to set up for individual
fellowship recipients. The report
proposes that the awards "take into
account not only academic ability, but
evidence of motivation initiative," and
Mayhew finds these criteria
unreasonable.
"I say this quite deliberately.
There's long been a search for non-test
and non-performance predictors of
academic success," Mayhew said, "and
by-and-large, that search has been
futile."
