# Six Slates File Election Petitions
## 
### 
Six slates have filed petitions to run
in the ASSU presidential election April
18-19, according to Elections
Commissioner Mike Nilsson.
The slates are:
—The team headed by incumbent
ASSU Vice President Peter Van
Petten, which also includes Committee
of 15 Chairman Jim Anderson, former
Sen. Charles "Buck" Schott and Sen.
Tom Flohr;
—The slate of Stanford Committee
on Political Education co-founder
Kevin O'Grady, former Sen. Beth
Garfield, Black Students Union
Chairman and Sen. Charles Ogletree,
and Stanford McCloskey Campaign
Co-Chairman Jim Friend;
- The team of junior Judy Gans and

grad student Barton "Buzz" Thompson;
—The Young Socialists' slate of
senior Fred Choate and Ed Ryu.
—The slate of juniors C. Robert
Garcia, Dave Meyer and Gail Rivers
and sophomore Reginald Turner, and
—Robert Chaffey, who is running
alone.
Nilsson, who at one time was
thinking of running for ASSU
president, decided against filing a
petition.
"Rather than cast the ASSU into a
flurry, I will continue as Elections
Commissioner," he said. Nilsson felt
that it would be very difficult to find a
qualified replacement for him on such
short notice.
The Van Petten and O'Grady slates

are the only two which have begun
active campaigning.
Van Petten's team has put out two
leaflets, each emphasizing the slate's
objectives if elected. Among the slate's
goals are increased student
employment and long-term student
loans from the University.
The O'Grady leaflet has emphasized
the qualifications and past experience
of the slate members.
Also on the ballot will be the slates
running for senior class president.
The two teams running are:
-Rischa Williams, Paul J' "Zeus"
Roesler, Nora Sweeney and Pat Smith,
and
—Terry Albert, Scott Miller, Dean
Smith, and Debbie Stinchfield.

THE LONGEST DAY - A thousand participants walked a 20-mile course
through Palo Alto in support of the Walk for Mankind. The mostly junior high
and high school volunteers were raising money for medical aid to deformed
Mexican children who will be treated at the Stanford Medical Center. The U.S.
Navy provided a "pooper pick-up" for drop-outs along the way.
