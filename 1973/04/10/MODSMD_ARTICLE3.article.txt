# Housing Office Reshuffles Residences
## 
### KITTY PATTERSON 
Stanford students participating in
next week's housing draw will be given
a broader range of choices this year
than ever before. The Housing Office
has juggled the independent and Row
Houses around and has made room for
a new theme house, Whitman Hall, in
Cluster 111.
From the start, Whitman Hall has
been a student-initiated project. Last
February, a committee of eight
students petitioned the Housing Office
to grant them a culturally-oriented
theme house.
The committee originally wanted to
call the house Gus Hall, a pun on the
name of the secretary of the American
Communist Party. When several
professors refused to support the
group, the committee changed the
name of the proposed house.
'Out Of The Blue'
According to Bob Newman, a
member of the committee, after
toying with names like Monty Hall and
Huntz Hall, the committee settled on
Whitman Hall, "just out of the blue."
The students then were able to find
12 professors to support their
proposal. The Housing Office accepted
their petition.
Religious Studies Prof. Mary
Lethco, and her husband volunteered
to be faculty residents in Whitman.
The pair has helped the original
committee define its goals.
The committee contends Stanford
suffers from anti-intellectualism.
Newman argues, "When people here

mention something in depth, the
atmosphere becomes really strained."
Culturally Oriented
Whitman hopes to create a relaxed,
culturally-oriented environment. The
committee has made a few plans
already. Each quarter, Whitman
residents may choose any of three
interdisciplinary seminars offered at
the house and open to all Stanford
students.
The committee has also set aside

two rooms in the house in which local
artists, religious figures, and
community leaders can spend a few
weeks. It has scheduled a blues
performance for the first weekend of
fall quarter.
Most of the plans are tentative, says
committee member Gerald Torres, "A
lot of our direction will depend on the
kind of people we get." If they ask for
art classes, the committee will arrange
them. If they want to organize a

soccer team, the committee will join
in, he said.
Keeping Flexible
By keeping flexible, committee
members hope to avoid the
horn-rimmed rut. "We're not going to
be another dorm," says Newman, "but
we don't want people who are
self-consciously intellectual to the
point of nausea."

theme house.
The committee originally wanted to
call the house Gus Hall, a pun on the
name of the secretary of the American
Communist Party. When several
professors refused to support the
group, the committee changed the
name of the proposed house.
'Out Of The Blue'
According to Bob Newman, a
member of the committee, after
toying with names like Monty Hall and
Huntz Hall, the committee settled on
Whitman Hall, "just out of the blue."
The students then were able to find
12 professors to support their
proposal. The Housing Office accepted
their petition.
Religious Studies Prof. Mary
Lethco, and her husband volunteered
to be faculty residents in Whitman.
The pair has helped the original
committee define its goals.
The committee contends Stanford
suffers from anti-intellectualism.
Newman argues, "When people here

mention something in depth, the
atmosphere becomes really strained."
Culturally Oriented
Whitman hopes to create a relaxed,
culturally-oriented environment. The
committee has made a few plans
already. Each quarter, Whitman
residents may choose any of three
interdisciplinary seminars offered at
the house and open to all Stanford
students.
The committee has also set aside

two rooms in the house in which local
artists, religious figures, and
community leaders can spend a few
weeks. It has scheduled a blues
performance for the first weekend of
fall quarter.
Most of the plans are tentative, says
committee member Gerald Torres, "A
lot of our direction will depend on the
kind of people we get." If they ask for
art classes, the committee will arrange
them. If they want to organize a

soccer team, the committee will join
in, he said.
Keeping Flexible
By keeping flexible, committee
members hope to avoid the
horn-rimmed rut. "We're not going to
be another dorm," says Newman, "but
we don't want people who are
self-consciously intellectual to the
point of nausea."
The committee has relaxed its
