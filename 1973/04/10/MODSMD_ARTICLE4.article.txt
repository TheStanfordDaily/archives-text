# Arab Guerrilla Strongholds Hit; Israeli Troops Kill Two Leaders
##

From The Associated Press
BEIRUT, Lebanon — Israeli troops striking from air and
sea shot up Palestinian Arab guerrilla strongholds last
night in the Lebanese cities of Beirut and Sidon, inflicting
dozens of casualties.
The attacks came hours after Arab commandos hit
Israeli targets in Nicosia, Cyprus.
The Israelis killed two top Palestinian guerrilla leaders.
Another commando official was reported missing, and
perhaps dead. Initial reports from Beirut said the Israelis
killed or wounded more than 40 persons.
A terse communique issued by the Israeli military
command in Tel Aviv said its forces "attacked terrorist
bases" in Beirut and Sidon, that "the missions were
accomplished" and the troops withdrew with four
wounded.
Another Israeli communique said the attackers raided
two guerrilla headquarters in Beirut, two workshops
handling explosives and weapons for the Black September
terrorists and an automobile repair garage north of Sidon.
Leader's Home Struck
In Beirut, the raiders struck at the home of a top
guerrilla leader in the center of the city. They also hit two
refugee camps where nearly 13,000 Palestinians live,
blowing up a number of buildings.
Reports from Beirut said Israeli gunboats landed on
beaches near the city and unlicensed Mercedes cars were
unloaded to be used in the raids.
The Israelis fired tracer bullets from the gunboats
toward one of the refugee camps, which is located near
the airport within sight of the sea, the reports said.
Guerilla Stronghold
The camp has a population of nearly 5000, according
to United Nations figures, and is regarded as a stronghold
of the radical Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine.
The Israelis apparently also hit another refugee camp
east of the city called Dikwaneh, where 7500 refugees
live. A total of 300,000 Palestinians live in Lebanon.
Among the Arabs reported dead were Mohammed
Yussef Najjar, No. 2 man in the major Palestinian guerrilla

group A 1 Fatah, and Kamal Ad wan, a loader of the
Palestine Liberation Organization.
First reports in Beirut said five civilians also were killeu
and 10 Lebanese security police were wounded.
The Israeli military command refused to say
immediately whether the deep penetration raids were a
direct reprisal for the attacks in Cyprus, but the assaults
were in line with Israel's "strike hard" policy against the
guerrillas.
At Nicosia 12 hours earlier, a band of Arab guerrillas
blew out the entrance to the apartment building housing
the Israeli ambassador with a powerful bomb, and then
attacked an Israeli airliner in an apparent attempt to
hijack it before takeoff.
None of the tenants of the three-story building was
hurt.
Three Wounded
An Israeli security guard on the El A 1 aircraft at the
international airport wounded three guerrillas as they
fired from a car speeding around the four-engine
Viscount.
A Cvpriot policeman was seriously wounded in a
shootout with guerrillas at the ambassador's residence in
downtown Nicosia. Three Arabs were captured there,
police said.
A Cypriot government spokesman reported one Arab
was killed but there was no confirmation of this from
police later.
Guard Detained
The police also detained the Israeli security guard who
shot the three Arabs at the airport.
Police said they found a note indicating that the Arabs
intended to hijack the Viscount. It was signed by a group
called National Arab Youth.
It was not immediately known if the group had any
ties with the Black Septembrists who carried out the
Olympics massacre and the slaying of two U.S. diplomats
and a Belgian envoy in Sudan last month.
It was the fourth attack on Israeli diplomats abroad
since September and the first major Arab-Israeli encounter
on Cyprus, a Mediterranean island with deep troubles of
its own.
