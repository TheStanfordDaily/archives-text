(Second, in a series of articles on the candidates
for the ASSU Council of Presidents in next week's
election.)
By JON BRAUN
"I don't think that my role as ASSU president
depends on national political issues. I think it
should focus on what's happening here at
Stanford."
Kevin O'Grady, head of a slate seeking the ASSU
presidency, used these words to reply to opponent
Pete Van Petten's charges that he is seeking the
president's office to push "his own political
philosophy."

Presidential Slate

A first year medical student who chaired the
campus McGovern campaign and co-founded the
Stanford Committee on Political Education
(SCOPE) through which he co-organized the "Might
v. Right" conference, O'Grady has put together a
slate composed of Jim Friend, Beth Garfield, and
Charles Ogletree.
Friend, a senior History major, acted as
co-chairman of the McCloskey campaign and
currently serves on the executive committee of the
History Undergraduate Association.
Beth Garfield, a junior in psychology and former
ASSU Senator, co-founded the Speakers Bureau for
Women and currently serves serves on the
Committee for Education and Employment of
Women.

Charles Ogletree chairs the Black Students'
Union and is editor of The Real News. A sophomore
in Political Science, Ogletree previously served as
ASSU Senator and a member of the Committee on
Minority Affairs.
Friend feels that it is his slate's
"representativeness and abilities which sharply
distinguish us from the opposing slate headed by
Pete Van Petten. Their slate would certainly resign
the ASSU to a kind of in-house clique. As a group,
we represent a wide diversity of interests."
The O'Grady slate members feel that the fact
they represent a wide range of interests will broaden
the ASSU's representation if they are elected.
Ogletree offered Special Events as an example:
More Minority Entertainers
"We understand that the various minority
entertainers may not have as wide a campus
attraction as the well-known individuals, but we do
feel that the minorities should be represented in the
various types of entertainment. They [Special
Events 1 have completely ignored these minorities."
According to Friend, "This emphasis on special
interest groups by Van Petten is ironical. They have
been very unsuccessful in recruiting a large sector of
student interest on campus. And as of the last few
weeks and months, they have attempted to ride in
on the coattails of a few people who have tried to
do the work."
Ogletree criticized the present Council,
explaining that "minorities have been ignored in the
undergraduate committees, and [Scott) Burke has

just assumed that they don't have any interest.
"Representation on various university
committees, and the various educational reforms
that we're suggesting reach out not only to the
average student but to the minority as well."
Guest-In-Residence
One such educational innovation is a
"Guest-In-Res:dence" program, which would
expand the present Speakers Bureau in bringing
prominent people to spend "several days on campus
living and interacting with students."
The slate also proposes establishment of a
salaried "Women's Advocate" within the
administration to coordinate women's programs on
campus. Among these programs would be a
Women's Studies Institute, which would establish
fellowships, seminars, and women related courses
within departments.
O'Grady feels that student rights ' a general
issue which deserves greater attention.
In this area, O'Grady has set up criteria for
judicial reform: 1) student approval of judicial
system provisions, 2) a student majority in cases
involving students, and 3) similar methods for
determining membership on the judicial panel.
According to O'Grady, graduate student interests
have been particularly ignored by the ASSU. To
serve this segment of the campus, his slate proposes
an effective off-campus housing service, a "Little
Leland's Pub" (serving wine and beer), and
expansion of services and cultural programs at
Tresidder.
