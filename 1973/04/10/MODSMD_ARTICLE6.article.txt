## JFK's Performance 
### 
Craig Cotora

Over the last several years it
seems that it has become just as
fashionable to criticize John F.
Kennedy's presidency as it was to
praise it during the middle sixties,
and in their determination to
compensate for what they
consider the oversites of the
Kennedyophiles, the revisionists
appear to have made some similar
ommissions.
For example, Nancy Clinch in
her book The Kennedy Neurosis
argues that JFK's decision to
blockade Cuban harbors in 1962
was compelled indirectly by
childhood pressures placed upon
him by a domineering father, but
does so while admitting she never
interviewed Kennedy.
Richard J. Whalton's chapter
on the Cuban missile crisis is yet
another example of how, in
attempting to balance JFK
criticism, one can
over-compensate. Whalton, for
example, states that the embargo
on Cuba was "unneccessary;
because the Cuban missiles did
not alter the strategic balance of
power" established by the
presence of Soviet ICBMs on
Russian soil.
Yet Whalton does not take into
account that in 1962—0n1y a few
months after the construction of
the Berlin wall—the Cold War was
still hot and that permitting the
Russians to plant missiles in Cuba
was psychologically as well as
politically unacceptable in the
U.S. (After announcing the
blockade, Congressional leaders
demanded to know why Kennedy
did not bomb the Cuban missile
sites).
"Strategic Threat"
In addition, although Secretary
of Defense McNamara did say "a
missile is a missile" referring to
the potential threat of the Russian
warheads in Cuba, in his book The
Essence of Security, McNamara
also points out that in 1962 the
Cuban missies "did constitute a
grave strategic threat" to the
United States: primarily because
at that time Russian guidance
systems were still relatively
primative (and consequently they
built much larger warheads than
the Americans did to
"compensate for misses"), and
thus the Russians needed a base
closer to the U.S. to improve their
accuracy.
But it seems to me that the
most significant aspect of the
Cuban missile crisis lies not so
much in what was decided but
how it was decided; for one of
Kennedy's finest attributes was
his willingness to correct his errors
in presidential performance.
Criticism Suppressed
Kennedy's first "error" was the
Bay of Pigs invasion in the Spring

of 1961. In his book Victims of
Groupthink, Irving Janis explains
how Kennedy and his staff never
challenged the major aspects of
the CIA plan inherited from the
Eisenhower administration, closed
themselves off from alternatives,
and even suppressed criticism of
Kennedy's decision until the
invasion was launched; and thus
contributed to the "fiasco" which
followed.
But in a later chapter of
Groupthink, Janis reveals how
Kennedy deliberately insured that
he would not repeat the Bay of
Pigs errors in the Cuban missile
crisis deliberations by absenting
himself from the meetings (to
insure freedom of discussion),
demanding alternatives, and even
encouraging criticism.
Public President
Kennedy was constantly
concerned with his Presidential
performance. Publicly this was
reflected in his self-deprecatory
humor. "It's just like Ike,"
Kennedy reportedly remarked
after the Bay of Pigs when an aide
produced a recent Gallup poll
which reported theat 80 percent
of the public "had confidence' ih
the President, "The worse I do,
the more popular I get."
Furthermore, Kennedy was a
public President who traveled
extensively across the country and
consumed newspapers and books
to feed his desire to know what
the country was thinking about.
(President Nixon, Time magazine
reports, does not even read daily
newspapers, but instead consults a
"summary of daily events"
compiled by his staff.)
Perhaps more importantly,
Kennedy grew in office. His
failure to articulate precisely how
the country was "to Move" in the
1960s contributed to Congress'
hesitancy, if not resistance to,
even his modest New Frontier
legislative proposals such as an
increase in the minimum wage and
Federal aid to public schools.
Thus in 1961 and 62 Kennedy
moved cautiously on his tax
reform, civil rights, and health
programs.
Dramatic Change
But Kennedy's approach
changed rather dramatically in
1963—as Martin Luther King, Jr.
noted in his book Where Do We
Go From Here?. Kennedy was
emerging as a "leader in the civil
rights movement rather than a
follower," King wrote, "for he
was willing to sacrifice public
popularity to enforce Federal
desegregation orders and propose
civil rights legislation."
In the same spirit of assurance
which arose out of his "learning
years," Kennedy decided, just

prior to his death, to introduce his
tax and civil rights packages
immediately, rather than wait
until after the 1964 elections.
Perhaps when the revolution
and counter-revolution in the
assessment of Kennedy's
presidency finally subsides, a less
passionate ciritic will record that
from amidst Kennedy's faults
emerges a man who was intensely
concerned with presidential—and
hence governmental
performance.
Considering the interest in
presidential performance
exhibited by the presidential
candidates since 1964, it may be a
long time before such concern
radiates from the White House
again.

was willing to sacrifice public
popularity to enforce Federal
desegregation orders and propose
civil rights legislation."

tax and civil rights packages

assessment of Kennedy's
presidency finally subsides, a less
passionate ciritic will record that
from amidst Kennedy's faults
emerges a man who was intensely
concerned with presidential—and

performance.
Considering the interest in
presidential performance
exhibited by the presidential
candidates since 1964, it may be a
long time before such concern
radiates from the White House
again.

Over the last several years it
seems that it has become just as
fashionable to criticize John F.
Kennedy's presidency as it was to
praise it during the middle sixties,
and in their determination to
compensate for what they
consider the oversites of the
Kennedyophiles, the revisionists
appear to have made some similar
ommissions.
For example, Nancy Clinch in
her book The Kennedy Neurosis
argues that JFK's decision to
blockade Cuban harbors in 1962
was compelled indirectly by
childhood pressures placed upon
him by a domineering father, but
does so while admitting she never
interviewed Kennedy.
Richard J. Whalton's chapter
on the Cuban missile crisis is yet
another example of how, in
attempting to balance JFK
criticism, one can
over-compensate. Whalton, for
example, states that the embargo
on Cuba was "unneccessary;
because the Cuban missiles did
not alter the strategic balance of
power" established by the
presence of Soviet ICBMs on
Russian soil.
Yet Whalton does not take into
account that in 1962—0n1y a few
months after the construction of
the Berlin wall—the Cold War was
still hot and that permitting the
Russians to plant missiles in Cuba
was psychologically as well as
politically unacceptable in the
U.S. (After announcing the
blockade, Congressional leaders
demanded to know why Kennedy
did not bomb the Cuban missile
sites).
"Strategic Threat"
In addition, although Secretary
of Defense McNamara did say "a
missile is a missile" referring to
the potential threat of the Russian
warheads in Cuba, in his book The
Essence of Security, McNamara
also points out that in 1962 the
Cuban missies "did constitute a
grave strategic threat" to the
United States: primarily because
at that time Russian guidance
systems were still relatively
primative (and consequently they
built much larger warheads than
the Americans did to
"compensate for misses"), and
thus the Russians needed a base
closer to the U.S. to improve their
accuracy.
But it seems to me that the
most significant aspect of the
Cuban missile crisis lies not so
much in what was decided but
how it was decided; for one of
Kennedy's finest attributes was
his willingness to correct his errors
in presidential performance.
Criticism Suppressed
Kennedy's first "error" was the
Bay of Pigs invasion in the Spring

of 1961. In his book Victims of
Groupthink, Irving Janis explains
how Kennedy and his staff never
challenged the major aspects of
the CIA plan inherited from the
Eisenhower administration, closed
themselves off from alternatives,
and even suppressed criticism of
Kennedy's decision until the
invasion was launched; and thus
contributed to the "fiasco" which
followed.
But in a later chapter of
Groupthink, Janis reveals how
Kennedy deliberately insured that
he would not repeat the Bay of
Pigs errors in the Cuban missile
crisis deliberations by absenting
himself from the meetings (to
insure freedom of discussion),
demanding alternatives, and even
encouraging criticism.
Public President
Kennedy was constantly
concerned with his Presidential
performance. Publicly this was
reflected in his self-deprecatory
humor. "It's just like Ike,"
Kennedy reportedly remarked
after the Bay of Pigs when an aide
produced a recent Gallup poll
which reported theat 80 percent
of the public "had confidence' ih
the President, "The worse I do,
the more popular I get."
Furthermore, Kennedy was a
public President who traveled
extensively across the country and
consumed newspapers and books
to feed his desire to know what
the country was thinking about.
(President Nixon, Time magazine
reports, does not even read daily
newspapers, but instead consults a
"summary of daily events"
compiled by his staff.)
Perhaps more importantly,
Kennedy grew in office. His
failure to articulate precisely how
the country was "to Move" in the
1960s contributed to Congress'
hesitancy, if not resistance to,
even his modest New Frontier
legislative proposals such as an
increase in the minimum wage and
Federal aid to public schools.
Thus in 1961 and 62 Kennedy
moved cautiously on his tax
reform, civil rights, and health
programs.
Dramatic Change
But Kennedy's approach
changed rather dramatically in
1963—as Martin Luther King, Jr.
noted in his book Where Do We
Go From Here?. Kennedy was
emerging as a "leader in the civil
rights movement rather than a
follower," King wrote, "for he
was willing to sacrifice public
popularity to enforce Federal
desegregation orders and propose
civil rights legislation."
In the same spirit of assurance
which arose out of his "learning

newspapers, but instead consults a
"summary of daily events"
compiled by his staff.)
Perhaps more importantly,
Kennedy grew in office. His
failure to articulate precisely how
the country was "to Move" in the
1960s contributed to Congress'
hesitancy, if not resistance to,
even his modest New Frontier
legislative proposals such as an
increase in the minimum wage and
Federal aid to public schools.
Thus in 1961 and 62 Kennedy
moved cautiously on his tax
reform, civil rights, and health
programs.
Dramatic Change
But Kennedy's approach
changed rather dramatically in
1963—as Martin Luther King, Jr.
noted in his book Where Do We
Go From Here?. Kennedy was
emerging as a "leader in the civil
rights movement rather than a
follower," King wrote, "for he
was willing to sacrifice public
popularity to enforce Federal
desegregation orders and propose
civil rights legislation."
In the same spirit of assurance
which arose out of his "learning
years," Kennedy decided, just

prior to his death, to introduce his
tax and civil rights packages
immediately, rather than wait
until after the 1964 elections.
Perhaps when the revolution
and counter-revolution in the
assessment of Kennedy's
presidency finally subsides, a less
passionate ciritic will record that
from amidst Kennedy's faults
emerges a man who was intensely
concerned with presidential—and
hence governmental
performance.
Considering the interest in
presidential performance
exhibited by the presidential
candidates since 1964, it may be a
long time before such concern
radiates from the White House
again.

Over the last several years it
seems that it has become just as
fashionable to criticize John F.
Kennedy's presidency as it was to
praise it during the middle sixties,
and in their determination to
compensate for what they
consider the oversites of the
Kennedyophiles, the revisionists
appear to have made some similar
ommissions.
For example, Nancy Clinch in
her book The Kennedy Neurosis
argues that JFK's decision to
blockade Cuban harbors in 1962
was compelled indirectly by
childhood pressures placed upon
him by a domineering father, but
does so while admitting she never
interviewed Kennedy.
Richard J. Whalton's chapter
on the Cuban missile crisis is yet
another example of how, in
attempting to balance JFK
criticism, one can
over-compensate. Whalton, for
example, states that the embargo
on Cuba was "unneccessary;
because the Cuban missiles did
not alter the strategic balance of
power" established by the
presence of Soviet ICBMs on
Russian soil.
Yet Whalton does not take into
account that in 1962—0n1y a few
months after the construction of
the Berlin wall—the Cold War was
still hot and that permitting the
Russians to plant missiles in Cuba
was psychologically as well as
politically unacceptable in the
U.S. (After announcing the
blockade, Congressional leaders
demanded to know why Kennedy
did not bomb the Cuban missile
sites).
"Strategic Threat"
In addition, although Secretary
of Defense McNamara did say "a
missile is a missile" referring to
the potential threat of the Russian
warheads in Cuba, in his book The
Essence of Security, McNamara
also points out that in 1962 the
Cuban missies "did constitute a
grave strategic threat" to the
United States: primarily because
at that time Russian guidance
systems were still relatively
primative (and consequently they
built much larger warheads than
the Americans did to
"compensate for misses"), and
thus the Russians needed a base
closer to the U.S. to improve their
accuracy.
But it seems to me that the
most significant aspect of the
Cuban missile crisis lies not so
much in what was decided but
how it was decided; for one of
Kennedy's finest attributes was
his willingness to correct his errors
in presidential performance.
Criticism Suppressed
Kennedy's first "error" was the
Bay of Pigs invasion in the Spring

of 1961. In his book Victims of
Groupthink, Irving Janis explains
how Kennedy and his staff never
challenged the major aspects of
the CIA plan inherited from the
Eisenhower administration, closed
themselves off from alternatives,
and even suppressed criticism of
Kennedy's decision until the
invasion was launched; and thus
contributed to the "fiasco" which
followed.
But in a later chapter of
Groupthink, Janis reveals how
Kennedy deliberately insured that
he would not repeat the Bay of
Pigs errors in the Cuban missile
crisis deliberations by absenting
himself from the meetings (to
insure freedom of discussion),
demanding alternatives, and even
encouraging criticism.
Public President
Kennedy was constantly
concerned with his Presidential
performance. Publicly this was
reflected in his self-deprecatory
humor. "It's just like Ike,"
Kennedy reportedly remarked
after the Bay of Pigs when an aide
produced a recent Gallup poll
which reported theat 80 percent
of the public "had confidence' ih
the President, "The worse I do,
the more popular I get."
Furthermore, Kennedy was a
public President who traveled
extensively across the country and
consumed newspapers and books
to feed his desire to know what
the country was thinking about.
(President Nixon, Time magazine
reports, does not even read daily
newspapers, but instead consults a
"summary of daily events"
compiled by his staff.)
Perhaps more importantly,

failure to articulate precisely how
