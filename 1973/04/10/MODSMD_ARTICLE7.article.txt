Reply to Smith's Letter
Editor:
I find it interesting that the
first salvo (Daily, April 5) fired
against us in this campaign comes
not from an opponent, but from
Kevin Smtih, an associate of
another slate, and not on an issue
of substance, but over claimed
"distortions" in our campaign
literature.
First, let me assure Mr. Smith
that were it possible for us to
claim sole credit for the ASSU
Course Review and the campus
appearances of William F.
Buckley, Daniel Ellsberg, Ramsey
Clark and I.F. Stone we would
certainly have done so.
Establishing the Course Review
and bringing speakers of this
prominence are real
accomplishments. Yet even a
cursory reading of our literature
reveals that we do not claim
exclusive credit for either.
For the ASSU Course Review
and the speeches several parties
can legitimately take credit.
Smith, for example, deserves
thanks for his co-editorship of the
publication. Yet at the beginning
of Fall Quarter, long before Smith
was named co-editor, the Course
Review had no money. When the
Publications Board refused to give
money to the Course Review, Pete
Van Petten went to the ASSU
Senate. Only after battles in the
Senate and Publications Board did
the Course Review receive
sufficient funds. This strikes me as
considerably greater than the
"slight effort" Pete supposedly
made "at one time." Without
Pete's efforts, Smith might not
have a course review to co-edit.
Before the Speakers Bureau,
which Smith so magnanimously
concedes Pete and Buck Schott
organized, appearances at

Stanford by men such as Buckley,
Ellsberg, Stone and Clark would
have been impossible as the record
clearly shows. These men don't
speak for free—their words cost a
bundle. Yet no one had the
resources to bring these men to
Stanford before the Speakers
Bureau was established. Only after
Pete and Buck organized the
Bureau and campaigned for the
student fee assessment did we
start to see these men at Stanford.
Bringing famous speakers to
Stanford is relatively easy—just
pay their price and they come
running. A responsible head of the
Speakers Bureau, on the other
hand, will attempt to bring these
men at the lowest cost possible,
which is exactly what Pete has
done. By using Stanford's
contacts with prominent people,
which is how the Buckley
appearance was arranged, and by
working jointly with other groups
on campus, which is how the
Stone, Ellsberg and Clark
appearances were arranged, Pete
has been able to provide the
calibre of speakers Stanford
students want at costs which do
not waste the student's money.
What then remains of Smith's
bitter accusations? His charge that
Pete's efforts on behalf of the
Course Review were "slight" and
"one time" is fantasy. His
assertion that "Van Petten and
company can only claim credit for
doling out the students' money"
is likewise simply untrue. If Smith
wishes to find fault with our
campaign I suggest that in the
future he confine himself to
matters of more substance than
the piddling charges he issued in
the Daily.
