# A 						Night To Forget
## Academic Freedom And Russell Kirk 
### 
David M. Szonyi

"A platitude is a platitude,
after all, because it is true." —thus
Mr. Russell Kirk at one point
platitudinally setting the tone for
last Thursday's Conservative
Forum on "Academic Freedom
and Academic License." Alas,
more often a platitude is a
platitude is a platitude; it often
becomes that way because it is
grounded on a cliche, never
thought through by the

enunciator nor critically tested in
terms of the "real world" by the
hearer. Last Thursday night's
forum was rich with, if nothing
else, academic platitudes.
To begin with, there was Mr.
Kirk. Shortly before inveighing
against Burckhardtian "terrible
simplifiers," Mr. Kirk proceeded
to define "freedom" with all the
sophitication of a college
freshman who has yet to enroll in

"Political Theory from Plato to
Mill:" something to the effect of
"freedom" being not letting
anyone do anything to you which
you don't want done. Ah for the
halycon days of rugged
individualist laissez faire, when no
one worried about "natural
rights" or Eric Fromm's "freedom
to" as well as "freedom from,"
when few men concerned
themselves with a freedom that
was socially grounded and
beneficial as well as individually
cuddled.
One was left wondering
whether Mr. Kirk has a positive
concept of freedom (Does he, for
example, believe in those "certain
inalienable rights" of 1776?) or, if
not, whether he sees any tension
acting upon his delicate
theoretical equilibrium of
"freedom" and "order." To
repeat Mr. Bernstein's unanswered
challenge, does not the "freedom"
of a Stanford engineer to help
develop better bombing guidance
systems affect the "order" in
which an Indochinese peasant
attempts to live? All this was
beyond, or perhaps "below," Mr.
Kirk's natty constructs.
Ideology and Ideologue
Alas, Mr. Kirk was not so
much interested in discussing
"Academic Freedom and
Academic License" as in
exercising the latter. Oblivious to
a fellow conservative's
admonitions against politicizing
language—has Mr. Kirk come
across the name "George Orwell"
in researching T.S. Eliot?— Mr.
Kirk proceeded to fudge the terms
"ideology" and "ideologue," so
that the former was represented as
something employed by the latter
in a crusading, coercive, and
usually violent manner, thus
rendering both terms pernicious.
All that, of course, allowed Mr.
Kirk, a la Daniel Bell ca. 1955, to
herald the "end of ideology,"
specifically the end of the
tempestuous 60's (when people
were so crude as to attempt to
integrate their learning and their
lives, pedagogy and politics) and
the return of the good, grey,
s/afus-guo-insuring spirit of the
ivory tower of the 1950'5. One
expected the robots in the
audience to applaud, and applaud
they did; only one good friend
had the good sense to return to
Kafka's parables. I couldn't help
thinking that the one polity
sureproof against the "servitude
to ideology" is the modern
totalitarian state of which Hannah
Arendt has written so eloquently,
a state in which the dominant
ideology quickly becomes the
only ideology and is just as
quickly "neutralized" by
becoming mystified and
mythologized.
There followed a long diatribe
against the big bad—read
"ideological" or "political"—
1960'5, during which the
"ideologues" has subverted the
"ordered freedom of intellect" for
which the university supposedly
stands. That last term in quotes
was never defined of course (it
sounds ominous enough), but
then, as Mr. Sidney Hook noted
before embarking on his first
non-definition, very little that
evening was.
As salient examples of such
subversions, Mr. Kirk offered us
the spread of coeducational
housing—the only time the issue
of "academic freedom" was
discussed in terms of students,
incidentally—and the name of
some professor (whose name I
can't remember because Mr. Kirk
couldn't either) in a small Virginia
college, who was denied tenure
for holding the "wrong" political
beliefs. Anyway, that Mr. Kirk
was allowed to, indeed, that he
was so generously paid to, airily

discourse on "academic freedom"
with so much "academic license"
should quiet anyone's qualms
about the state of the former.
Courage or Chutzpah?
Not to mention the presence of
Mr. Sidney Hook, of course. I find
it an act of either incredible
courage or incredible chutzpah
that Mr. Hook would address
himself to the topic at all. For it is
not that long since the NYU
professor emeritus denounced the
presence of several Communists
on faculties, for Communists were
seen by him as a priori being
desirous of overthrowing the
democratic system and of being
''programmed'' by
extra-university sources (the CP)
to "indoctrinate" students in their
classes, something all right-minded
truth-seeking brokers in the "free
marketplace of ideas" would shun
like the plague.
The cliche free marketplace of
ideas," incidentally, was implicit
in Mr. Kirk's and Mr. Hook's
analyses, and was explicityly
stated at last by the panel's
moderator Harvard
sociologist-political scientist
Seymour Martin Lipset. Mr.
Lipset used the term, ironically,
to note that, given the special and
rarefied position of the university,
the academic qua academic
suspends certain rights he
exercised as a citizen, viz. those
pertaining to the First
Amendment. His First
Amendment rights are
boundaried, Mr. Hook had
previously noted, by the
obligations of "qualified" persons
to "rationally" express their views
in accordance with "professional
standards and ethics."
Before offering this
"definition" of "academic
responsibility," Mr. Hook
castigated his fellow panelists for
their lack of definitions, but what
each of the terms he used meant,
who defined them and how, and
how they were to evolve
was—need I say it?—left unsaid.
All of which was par for the

evening's course. For hardly had
Mr. Bernstein finished analyzing
how the university is and must be
political in deciding who it hires,
and thus what truths are to be
pursued, as well as who rules it
and how its truths are to be
applied, then, Mr. Hook asked,
with an innocence so disarming
that it couldn't have been feigned,
"What has politics to do with
issues of academic freedom?"
Rational Discourse
It was a typical question for an
evening in which people kept
intellectually missing or avoiding
each other, this despite the
"rational discourse" they all
professed to believe in. It was
even more depressing to hear so
many fellow students applaud so
perfunctorily. And it was simply
deceptive for the Daily's
reporteter to headline his story
"Kirk Analyzes Academic
Freedom," for no one analyzed
much of anything Thursday
evening. Rather, there was a little
pseudo-wit, some gratuitous
patronizing of Mr. Bernstein, and
all too much intellectual
grandstanding. Mr. Hook, that
diligent student of the Marx
[Karl] sounded all too often like
another [Groucho], Only
sporadically were the speakers as
funny as they were intellectually
shoddy.
I wish I could look forward to
the next Conservative Forum, at
which Mr. William F. Buckley is
to pontificate on "The Current
Disorder" (?!). But given the night
with Mr. Kirk et. al., and given the
way Mr. Buckley was recently
intellectually and rhetorically
drawn and quartered by Ms.
Germaine Greer at the Cambridge
U. Debate Forum (where the
minds are sharper and the wits
keener), I am not terribly hopeful.

"A platitude is a platitude,
after all, because it is true." —thus
Mr. Russell Kirk at one point
platitudinally setting the tone for
last Thursday's Conservative
Forum on "Academic Freedom
and Academic License." Alas,
more often a platitude is a
platitude is a platitude; it often
becomes that way because it is
grounded on a cliche, never
thought through by the

enunciator nor critically tested in
terms of the "real world" by the
hearer. Last Thursday night's
forum was rich with, if nothing
else, academic platitudes.
To begin with, there was Mr.
Kirk. Shortly before inveighing
against Burckhardtian "terrible
simplifiers," Mr. Kirk proceeded
to define "freedom" with all the
sophitication of a college
freshman who has yet to enroll in

"Political Theory from Plato to
Mill:" something to the effect of
"freedom" being not letting
anyone do anything to you which
you don't want done. Ah for the
halycon days of rugged
individualist laissez faire, when no
one worried about "natural
rights" or Eric Fromm's "freedom
to" as well as "freedom from,"
when few men concerned
themselves with a freedom that
was socially grounded and
beneficial as well as individually
cuddled.
One was left wondering
whether Mr. Kirk has a positive
concept of freedom (Does he, for
example, believe in those "certain
inalienable rights" of 1776?) or, if
not, whether he sees any tension
acting upon his delicate
theoretical equilibrium of
"freedom" and "order." To
repeat Mr. Bernstein's unanswered
challenge, does not the "freedom"
of a Stanford engineer to help
develop better bombing guidance
systems affect the "order" in
which an Indochinese peasant
attempts to live? All this was
beyond, or perhaps "below," Mr.
Kirk's natty constructs.
Ideology and Ideologue
Alas, Mr. Kirk was not so
much interested in discussing
"Academic Freedom and
Academic License" as in
exercising the latter. Oblivious to
a fellow conservative's
admonitions against politicizing
language—has Mr. Kirk come
across the name "George Orwell"
in researching T.S. Eliot?— Mr.
Kirk proceeded to fudge the terms
"ideology" and "ideologue," so
that the former was represented as
something employed by the latter
in a crusading, coercive, and
usually violent manner, thus
rendering both terms pernicious.
All that, of course, allowed Mr.
Kirk, a la Daniel Bell ca. 1955, to
herald the "end of ideology,"
specifically the end of the
tempestuous 60's (when people
were so crude as to attempt to
integrate their learning and their
lives, pedagogy and politics) and
the return of the good, grey,
s/afus-guo-insuring spirit of the
ivory tower of the 1950'5. One
expected the robots in the
audience to applaud, and applaud
they did; only one good friend
had the good sense to return to
Kafka's parables. I couldn't help
thinking that the one polity
sureproof against the "servitude
to ideology" is the modern
totalitarian state of which Hannah
Arendt has written so eloquently,
a state in which the dominant
ideology quickly becomes the
only ideology and is just as
quickly "neutralized" by
becoming mystified and
mythologized.
There followed a long diatribe
against the big bad—read
"ideological" or "political"—
1960'5, during which the
"ideologues" has subverted the
"ordered freedom of intellect" for
which the university supposedly
stands. That last term in quotes
was never defined of course (it
sounds ominous enough), but
then, as Mr. Sidney Hook noted
before embarking on his first
non-definition, very little that
evening was.
As salient examples of such
subversions, Mr. Kirk offered us
the spread of coeducational
housing—the only time the issue
of "academic freedom" was
discussed in terms of students,
incidentally—and the name of
some professor (whose name I
can't remember because Mr. Kirk
couldn't either) in a small Virginia
college, who was denied tenure
for holding the "wrong" political
beliefs. Anyway, that Mr. Kirk
was allowed to, indeed, that he
was so generously paid to, airily

discourse on "academic freedom"
with so much "academic license"
should quiet anyone's qualms
about the state of the former.
Courage or Chutzpah?
Not to mention the presence of
Mr. Sidney Hook, of course. I find
it an act of either incredible
courage or incredible chutzpah
that Mr. Hook would address
himself to the topic at all. For it is
not that long since the NYU
professor emeritus denounced the
presence of several Communists
on faculties, for Communists were
seen by him as a priori being
desirous of overthrowing the
democratic system and of being
''programmed'' by
extra-university sources (the CP)
to "indoctrinate" students in their
classes, something all right-minded
truth-seeking brokers in the "free
marketplace of ideas" would shun
like the plague.
The cliche free marketplace of
ideas," incidentally, was implicit
in Mr. Kirk's and Mr. Hook's
analyses, and was explicityly
stated at last by the panel's
moderator Harvard
sociologist-political scientist
Seymour Martin Lipset. Mr.
Lipset used the term, ironically,
to note that, given the special and
rarefied position of the university,
the academic qua academic
suspends certain rights he
exercised as a citizen, viz. those
pertaining to the First
Amendment. His First
Amendment rights are
boundaried, Mr. Hook had
previously noted, by the
obligations of "qualified" persons
to "rationally" express their views
in accordance with "professional
standards and ethics."
Before offering this
"definition" of "academic
responsibility," Mr. Hook
castigated his fellow panelists for
their lack of definitions, but what
each of the terms he used meant,
who defined them and how, and
how they were to evolve
was—need I say it?—left unsaid.
All of which was par for the

evening's course. For hardly had
Mr. Bernstein finished analyzing
how the university is and must be
political in deciding who it hires,
and thus what truths are to be
pursued, as well as who rules it
and how its truths are to be
applied, then, Mr. Hook asked,
with an innocence so disarming
that it couldn't have been feigned,
"What has politics to do with
issues of academic freedom?"
Rational Discourse
It was a typical question for an
evening in which people kept
intellectually missing or avoiding
each other, this despite the
"rational discourse" they all
professed to believe in. It was
even more depressing to hear so
many fellow students applaud so
perfunctorily. And it was simply
deceptive for the Daily's
reporteter to headline his story
"Kirk Analyzes Academic
Freedom," for no one analyzed
much of anything Thursday

castigated his fellow panelists for
their lack of definitions, but what
each of the terms he used meant,
who defined them and how, and
how they were to evolve
was—need I say it?—left unsaid.
All of which was par for the

evening's course. For hardly had
Mr. Bernstein finished analyzing
how the university is and must be
political in deciding who it hires,
and thus what truths are to be
pursued, as well as who rules it
and how its truths are to be
applied, then, Mr. Hook asked,
with an innocence so disarming
that it couldn't have been feigned,
"What has politics to do with
issues of academic freedom?"
Rational Discourse
It was a typical question for an
evening in which people kept
intellectually missing or avoiding
each other, this despite the
"rational discourse" they all
professed to believe in. It was
even more depressing to hear so
many fellow students applaud so
perfunctorily. And it was simply
deceptive for the Daily's
reporteter to headline his story
"Kirk Analyzes Academic
Freedom," for no one analyzed
much of anything Thursday
evening. Rather, there was a little
pseudo-wit, some gratuitous
patronizing of Mr. Bernstein, and
all too much intellectual
grandstanding. Mr. Hook, that
diligent student of the Marx
[Karl] sounded all too often like
another [Groucho], Only
sporadically were the speakers as
funny as they were intellectually
shoddy.
I wish I could look forward to
the next Conservative Forum, at
which Mr. William F. Buckley is
to pontificate on "The Current
Disorder" (?!). But given the night
with Mr. Kirk et. al., and given the
way Mr. Buckley was recently
intellectually and rhetorically
drawn and quartered by Ms.
Germaine Greer at the Cambridge
U. Debate Forum (where the
minds are sharper and the wits
keener), I am not terribly hopeful.

"A platitude is a platitude,
after all, because it is true." —thus
Mr. Russell Kirk at one point
platitudinally setting the tone for
last Thursday's Conservative
Forum on "Academic Freedom
and Academic License." Alas,
more often a platitude is a
platitude is a platitude; it often
becomes that way because it is
grounded on a cliche, never
thought through by the

enunciator nor critically tested in
terms of the "real world" by the
hearer. Last Thursday night's
forum was rich with, if nothing
else, academic platitudes.
To begin with, there was Mr.
Kirk. Shortly before inveighing
against Burckhardtian "terrible
simplifiers," Mr. Kirk proceeded
to define "freedom" with all the
sophitication of a college
freshman who has yet to enroll in

"Political Theory from Plato to
Mill:" something to the effect of
"freedom" being not letting
anyone do anything to you which
you don't want done. Ah for the
halycon days of rugged
individualist laissez faire, when no
one worried about "natural
rights" or Eric Fromm's "freedom
to" as well as "freedom from,"
when few men concerned
themselves with a freedom that
was socially grounded and
beneficial as well as individually
cuddled.
One was left wondering
whether Mr. Kirk has a positive
concept of freedom (Does he, for
example, believe in those "certain
inalienable rights" of 1776?) or, if
not, whether he sees any tension
acting upon his delicate
theoretical equilibrium of
"freedom" and "order." To
repeat Mr. Bernstein's unanswered
challenge, does not the "freedom"
of a Stanford engineer to help
develop better bombing guidance
systems affect the "order" in
which an Indochinese peasant
attempts to live? All this was
beyond, or perhaps "below," Mr.
Kirk's natty constructs.
Ideology and Ideologue
Alas, Mr. Kirk was not so
much interested in discussing
"Academic Freedom and
Academic License" as in
exercising the latter. Oblivious to
a fellow conservative's
admonitions against politicizing
language—has Mr. Kirk come
across the name "George Orwell"
in researching T.S. Eliot?— Mr.
Kirk proceeded to fudge the terms
"ideology" and "ideologue," so
that the former was represented as
something employed by the latter
in a crusading, coercive, and
usually violent manner, thus
rendering both terms pernicious.
All that, of course, allowed Mr.
Kirk, a la Daniel Bell ca. 1955, to
herald the "end of ideology,"
specifically the end of the
tempestuous 60's (when people
were so crude as to attempt to
integrate their learning and their
lives, pedagogy and politics) and
the return of the good, grey,
s/afus-guo-insuring spirit of the
ivory tower of the 1950'5. One
expected the robots in the
audience to applaud, and applaud
they did; only one good friend
had the good sense to return to
Kafka's parables. I couldn't help
thinking that the one polity
sureproof against the "servitude
to ideology" is the modern
totalitarian state of which Hannah
Arendt has written so eloquently,
a state in which the dominant
ideology quickly becomes the
only ideology and is just as
quickly "neutralized" by
becoming mystified and
mythologized.
There followed a long diatribe
against the big bad—read
"ideological" or "political"—
1960'5, during which the
"ideologues" has subverted the
"ordered freedom of intellect" for
which the university supposedly
stands. That last term in quotes
was never defined of course (it
sounds ominous enough), but
then, as Mr. Sidney Hook noted
before embarking on his first
non-definition, very little that
evening was.
As salient examples of such
subversions, Mr. Kirk offered us
the spread of coeducational
housing—the only time the issue
of "academic freedom" was
discussed in terms of students,
incidentally—and the name of
some professor (whose name I
can't remember because Mr. Kirk
couldn't either) in a small Virginia
college, who was denied tenure
for holding the "wrong" political
beliefs. Anyway, that Mr. Kirk
was allowed to, indeed, that he
was so generously paid to, airily

discourse on "academic freedom"
with so much "academic license"
should quiet anyone's qualms
about the state of the former.
Courage or Chutzpah?
Not to mention the presence of
Mr. Sidney Hook, of course. I find
it an act of either incredible
courage or incredible chutzpah
that Mr. Hook would address
himself to the topic at all. For it is
not that long since the NYU
professor emeritus denounced the
presence of several Communists
on faculties, for Communists were
seen by him as a priori being
desirous of overthrowing the
democratic system and of being
''programmed'' by
extra-university sources (the CP)
to "indoctrinate" students in their
classes, something all right-minded
truth-seeking brokers in the "free
marketplace of ideas" would shun
like the plague.
The cliche free marketplace of
ideas," incidentally, was implicit
in Mr. Kirk's and Mr. Hook's
analyses, and was explicityly
stated at last by the panel's
moderator Harvard
sociologist-political scientist
Seymour Martin Lipset. Mr.
Lipset used the term, ironically,
to note that, given the special and
rarefied position of the university,
the academic qua academic
suspends certain rights he
exercised as a citizen, viz. those
pertaining to the First
Amendment. His First
Amendment rights are
boundaried, Mr. Hook had
previously noted, by the
obligations of "qualified" persons
to "rationally" express their views
in accordance with "professional
standards and ethics."
Before offering this
"definition" of "academic
responsibility," Mr. Hook
castigated his fellow panelists for
their lack of definitions, but what
each of the terms he used meant,
who defined them and how, and
how they were to evolve

''programmed'' by
extra-university sources (the CP)
to "indoctrinate" students in their
classes, something all right-minded
truth-seeking brokers in the "free
marketplace of ideas" would shun
like the plague.
The cliche free marketplace of
ideas," incidentally, was implicit
in Mr. Kirk's and Mr. Hook's
analyses, and was explicityly
stated at last by the panel's
moderator Harvard
sociologist-political scientist
Seymour Martin Lipset. Mr.
Lipset used the term, ironically,
to note that, given the special and
rarefied position of the university,
the academic qua academic
suspends certain rights he
exercised as a citizen, viz. those
pertaining to the First
Amendment. His First
Amendment rights are
boundaried, Mr. Hook had
previously noted, by the
obligations of "qualified" persons
to "rationally" express their views
in accordance with "professional
standards and ethics."
Before offering this
"definition" of "academic
responsibility," Mr. Hook
castigated his fellow panelists for
their lack of definitions, but what
each of the terms he used meant,
who defined them and how, and
how they were to evolve
was—need I say it?—left unsaid.
All of which was par for the

evening's course. For hardly had
Mr. Bernstein finished analyzing
how the university is and must be
political in deciding who it hires,
and thus what truths are to be
pursued, as well as who rules it
and how its truths are to be
applied, then, Mr. Hook asked,
with an innocence so disarming
that it couldn't have been feigned,
"What has politics to do with
issues of academic freedom?"
Rational Discourse
It was a typical question for an
evening in which people kept
intellectually missing or avoiding
each other, this despite the
"rational discourse" they all
professed to believe in. It was
even more depressing to hear so
many fellow students applaud so
perfunctorily. And it was simply
deceptive for the Daily's
reporteter to headline his story
"Kirk Analyzes Academic
Freedom," for no one analyzed
much of anything Thursday
evening. Rather, there was a little
pseudo-wit, some gratuitous
patronizing of Mr. Bernstein, and
all too much intellectual
grandstanding. Mr. Hook, that
diligent student of the Marx
[Karl] sounded all too often like
another [Groucho], Only
sporadically were the speakers as
funny as they were intellectually
shoddy.
I wish I could look forward to
the next Conservative Forum, at
which Mr. William F. Buckley is
to pontificate on "The Current
Disorder" (?!). But given the night
with Mr. Kirk et. al., and given the
way Mr. Buckley was recently
intellectually and rhetorically
drawn and quartered by Ms.
Germaine Greer at the Cambridge
U. Debate Forum (where the
minds are sharper and the wits
keener), I am not terribly hopeful.

"A platitude is a platitude,
after all, because it is true." —thus
Mr. Russell Kirk at one point
platitudinally setting the tone for
last Thursday's Conservative
Forum on "Academic Freedom
and Academic License." Alas,
more often a platitude is a
platitude is a platitude; it often
becomes that way because it is
grounded on a cliche, never
thought through by the

enunciator nor critically tested in
terms of the "real world" by the
hearer. Last Thursday night's
forum was rich with, if nothing
else, academic platitudes.
To begin with, there was Mr.
Kirk. Shortly before inveighing
against Burckhardtian "terrible
simplifiers," Mr. Kirk proceeded
to define "freedom" with all the
sophitication of a college
freshman who has yet to enroll in

"Political Theory from Plato to
Mill:" something to the effect of
"freedom" being not letting
anyone do anything to you which
you don't want done. Ah for the
halycon days of rugged
individualist laissez faire, when no
one worried about "natural
rights" or Eric Fromm's "freedom
to" as well as "freedom from,"
when few men concerned
themselves with a freedom that
was socially grounded and
beneficial as well as individually
cuddled.
One was left wondering
whether Mr. Kirk has a positive
concept of freedom (Does he, for
example, believe in those "certain
inalienable rights" of 1776?) or, if
not, whether he sees any tension
acting upon his delicate
theoretical equilibrium of
"freedom" and "order." To
repeat Mr. Bernstein's unanswered
challenge, does not the "freedom"
of a Stanford engineer to help
develop better bombing guidance
systems affect the "order" in
which an Indochinese peasant
attempts to live? All this was
beyond, or perhaps "below," Mr.
Kirk's natty constructs.
Ideology and Ideologue
Alas, Mr. Kirk was not so
much interested in discussing
"Academic Freedom and
Academic License" as in
exercising the latter. Oblivious to
a fellow conservative's
admonitions against politicizing
language—has Mr. Kirk come
across the name "George Orwell"
in researching T.S. Eliot?— Mr.
Kirk proceeded to fudge the terms
"ideology" and "ideologue," so
that the former was represented as
something employed by the latter
in a crusading, coercive, and
usually violent manner, thus
rendering both terms pernicious.
All that, of course, allowed Mr.
Kirk, a la Daniel Bell ca. 1955, to
herald the "end of ideology,"
specifically the end of the
tempestuous 60's (when people
were so crude as to attempt to
integrate their learning and their
lives, pedagogy and politics) and
the return of the good, grey,
s/afus-guo-insuring spirit of the
ivory tower of the 1950'5. One
expected the robots in the
audience to applaud, and applaud
they did; only one good friend
had the good sense to return to
Kafka's parables. I couldn't help
thinking that the one polity
sureproof against the "servitude
to ideology" is the modern
totalitarian state of which Hannah
Arendt has written so eloquently,
a state in which the dominant
ideology quickly becomes the
only ideology and is just as
quickly "neutralized" by
becoming mystified and
mythologized.
There followed a long diatribe
against the big bad—read
"ideological" or "political"—
1960'5, during which the
"ideologues" has subverted the
"ordered freedom of intellect" for
which the university supposedly
stands. That last term in quotes
was never defined of course (it
sounds ominous enough), but
then, as Mr. Sidney Hook noted
before embarking on his first
non-definition, very little that
evening was.
As salient examples of such
subversions, Mr. Kirk offered us
the spread of coeducational
housing—the only time the issue
of "academic freedom" was
discussed in terms of students,
incidentally—and the name of
some professor (whose name I
can't remember because Mr. Kirk
couldn't either) in a small Virginia
college, who was denied tenure
for holding the "wrong" political
beliefs. Anyway, that Mr. Kirk
was allowed to, indeed, that he
was so generously paid to, airily

discourse on "academic freedom"
with so much "academic license"
should quiet anyone's qualms
about the state of the former.
Courage or Chutzpah?
Not to mention the presence of
Mr. Sidney Hook, of course. I find
it an act of either incredible
courage or incredible chutzpah
that Mr. Hook would address
himself to the topic at all. For it is
not that long since the NYU
professor emeritus denounced the
presence of several Communists
on faculties, for Communists were
seen by him as a priori being
desirous of overthrowing the
democratic system and of being
''programmed'' by
extra-university sources (the CP)
to "indoctrinate" students in their
classes, something all right-minded
truth-seeking brokers in the "free
marketplace of ideas" would shun
like the plague.
