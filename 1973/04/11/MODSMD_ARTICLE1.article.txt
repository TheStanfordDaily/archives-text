# Tresidder In Financial Crisis
## Union Closing Possible 
### JANET SANDERS 
If Tresidder Memorial Union does
not pull out of its current financial
crisis, there is a possibility that it will
be forced to shut down completely in
two years, according to Financial
Manager Gordon Starr.
"I am fairly confident that we can
pull out of the crisis," said Starr.
"Whether we cut out any services next
year depends on how fast we can make
improvements."
Starr hopes to trim down this year's
projected deficit of $240,000 by
$40,000 and pick up approximately
$20,000 from the University for
community services. To achieve this
reduction, the Union plans to cut back
in food, labor and supplies costs.
Labor costs are responsible for 56
percent of all Tresidder expenses. By
the end of the summer, Starr hopes to
reduce this figure to 40 percent.
Labor Cost Cuts
By eliminating 250 hours per week
in student labor and abolishing
positions vacated by retiring workers,
Starr has cut labor costs to 48 percent.
"We have not hired anyone for a
full-time job since August," said Starr,
and he intends to continue this policy.
"We don't know specifically how
we are going to reduce labor
expenditures another eight percent by
August," Starr said, but he cited
several possibilities. The Union may
transfer labor to residence food
services and shift around labor within

Tresidder's operations in order to use
it more productively. "I doubt that we
will be significantly reducing student
labor again this year," said Starr.
The Union also hopes to cut back
food costs from 43 percent of the
total expenses to 38 percent. To
achieve this, smaller portions of food
will be served, prices will go up soon,
and there will be tighter control of
waste in the kitchen.
"I don't know how extensive the
food price boost will be," Starr said,
explaining that an analysis of prices is
now going on.
Supply Costs Scrutinized
Supplies costs are also being closely
investigated. In the future, Stan
speculated that less dishware and
silverware will be used. "There will be
more paper and less china in the
cafeteria," he said.
To increase total revenue, Tresidder
is expanding or plans to expand a

couple of operations. An $18,000
remodeling project of the coffeehouse
is scheduled to begin June 1.
"It is an investment which we
figure will pay off rapidly," explained
Starr. "We are presently losing
$18,000 a year on the coffeehouse
because of inefficient services."
By opening the coffeehouse into
the bowling alley and improving food
service, Starr hopes to increase sales
substantially. According to him, the
addition of an automatic dishwasher
will save $3,000 a year alone.
Starr said "Our future depends on
food services," presently the major
money-loser. He hopes to replace
temporary food manager Jerry Philpot
by next week, but he declined to
comment on the candidates for the
job.

are realized, the Union will still have a
deficit this year of approximately
$180,000. Tresidder is now
negotiating with University officials as
to who will pay the debt.
"Last year, we made an informal
agreement with the University that it
would pick up a deficit of $150,000,"
said Starr. "I don't know whether it
will cover the entire amount of
$180,000 or not."
"We don't expect to shut down any
services in the next two quarters,"
Starr said. "However, if we do not
make the substantial improvements we
have planned, there will be serious
consideration of closing down some
services next year."
In spite of the bleak financial
situation, Starr remains optimistic of
the future. "We hope to come within
$50,000 of breaking even next year,"
he said. "Right now it does not look
like we can do that, but we're trying
to plan far enough ahead so that we
can." s

are realized, the Union will still have a
deficit this year of approximately
$180,000. Tresidder is now
negotiating with University officials as
to who will pay the debt.
"Last year, we made an informal
agreement with the University that it
would pick up a deficit of $150,000,"
said Starr. "I don't know whether it
will cover the entire amount of
$180,000 or not."
"We don't expect to shut down any
services in the next two quarters,"
Starr said. "However, if we do not
make the substantial improvements we
have planned, there will be serious
consideration of closing down some
services next year."
In spite of the bleak financial
situation, Starr remains optimistic of
the future. "We hope to come within
$50,000 of breaking even next year,"
he said. "Right now it does not look
like we can do that, but we're trying
to plan far enough ahead so that we
can." s
If Tresidder Memorial Union does
not pull out of its current financial
crisis, there is a possibility that it will
be forced to shut down completely in
two years, according to Financial
Manager Gordon Starr.
"I am fairly confident that we can
pull out of the crisis," said Starr.
"Whether we cut out any services next
year depends on how fast we can make
improvements."
Starr hopes to trim down this year's
projected deficit of $240,000 by
$40,000 and pick up approximately
$20,000 from the University for
community services. To achieve this
reduction, the Union plans to cut back
in food, labor and supplies costs.
Labor costs are responsible for 56
percent of all Tresidder expenses. By
the end of the summer, Starr hopes to
reduce this figure to 40 percent.
Labor Cost Cuts
By eliminating 250 hours per week
in student labor and abolishing
positions vacated by retiring workers,
Starr has cut labor costs to 48 percent.
"We have not hired anyone for a
full-time job since August," said Starr,
and he intends to continue this policy.
"We don't know specifically how
we are going to reduce labor
expenditures another eight percent by
August," Starr said, but he cited
several possibilities. The Union may
transfer labor to residence food
services and shift around labor within

Tresidder's operations in order to use
it more productively. "I doubt that we
will be significantly reducing student
labor again this year," said Starr.
The Union also hopes to cut back
food costs from 43 percent of the
total expenses to 38 percent. To
achieve this, smaller portions of food
will be served, prices will go up soon,
and there will be tighter control of
waste in the kitchen.

food price boost will be," Starr said,
