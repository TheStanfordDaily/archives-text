# Illusions Of Peace
## The 						War And Reconstruction Aid 
### 
Larry Diamond

With the end of overt American involvement in the
Vietnam War, the peace movement in this country seems
to have collapsed. The campuses are silent, the
organizations deserted or dying, the Congress dazed.
It is a collapse wrought with irony and tragedy: irony
that the masses of anti-war activists, claiming all along
the highest humanitarian principles for their opposition
to the war, are no longer even actively concerned now
that American lives are no longer captive or in danger,
now that America is off the hook in Vietnam; tragedy
that this unilateral withdrawal not only allows continued
torture and killing in Indochina, but may also inspire an
isolationist mentality that will scuttle any plan for aid to
North Vietnam and any chance for a lasting peace.
The killing goes on in Indochina largely because we
are committed to supplying to repressive and corrupt
military dictatorships the guns and bombs and tanks that
will insure that it can go on. In Cambodia, where
American involvement is still direct and overt, we have
been dropping more bombs, and closer to concentrations
of civilian population, than ever before there. Thousands
of civlians have been killed in these raids. Countless
thousands more are being made refugees by the
devastation of their homes and countryside.
Cruelty
Shades of Vietnam all over again, but a shrewder
American rol£: no American ground troops, and
thereforeno American protest.
It is a cruel thing we are doing to a country that was
so very recently at peace. But how much more cruel
than the covert new role we have assumed in South
Vietnam, where American dollars prop up a vindictive
dictator who holds in cage-like prisons more than
100,000 of his citizens, most of whom have committed
only the crime of daring to criticize him; and where
some 10,000 American "advisers" have now donned
civilian garb and will remain to see that Mr. Thieu's war
machine keeps functioning.
We have negotiated an Indochina peace, true. But are
our hands any less caked with the blood of the dead now
that it is Asians who pull the triggers and only the
bullets that are American? If we are serious about
stopping the killing, rather than merely saving our own
skins, ought we not to be serious about stopping this
massive flow of military aid to the governments of Lon
Nol and Nguyen Van Thieu?
Larger Issue
And there is a larger issue: that of North Vietnam,
and our posture toward it now that we have ceased
active hostilities. To speak of reconstruction aid in the
wake of the revelations of the returning POW's is to
invite a very wicked and divisive national debate'.
Terrible acts of torture were committed against
American prisoners of war. Too many of these men were
brutally beaten and broken, too many other men now
appear to have died in captivity, for us not to be
properly outraged at their treatment by the North
Vietnamese. This was petty vengeance, bent only on
sheer brutality and public humiliation.
How we as a nation react to these nightmarish tales

may have important implications for world peace. For
this torture, though difficult to forgive, is not difficult
to understand. When a small nation fights for so many
years for independence from foreign domination, and
when its civilian population suffers so greatly from the
guns and bombs of foreign powers, foreign soldiers come
to be hated with a mindless and ugly passion. Vengeful
cruelty is an awful thing, but can we expect more of the
North Vietnamese than of ourselves? Would not we in
this nation feel the same vindictive desire to torture and
beat pilots whose bombs had for years tortured and
devastated our own land and people?
Vicious Cycle
There is at work a vicious cycle that has been broken
only at extraordinary points in human history. Violence
begets violence. Cruelty begets cruelty Inhumanity
begets inhumanity. Somehow this cycle must be broken
today in world affairs or human civilization wili destroy
itself.
It is more than humanitanauism that should motivate
this country toward a more caring and cooperative world
posture; it is self-interest as well. We are outnumbered,
dependent for resources on an underdeveloped world
with a population many times our own in size. These
nations are only now beginning to realize the power
inherent in the resources ihey hold. They are becoming
increasingly less resigned to foreign domination and
control over their economic life. They are seething with
a popular recognition that a national fate of abject
poverty and misery is> not inevitable.
If we cannot forge with these developing nations a
real peace — not a peace of force but a peace of partners
- that will insure access to precious natural resources at
a fair rate of exchange, there is no way that the America
economy and the society it sustains can survive.
Good Neighbors?
For those in this country who have no interest in
being good neighbors merely because it is Ihe Christian
and the decent thing to do, we still have a powerful
argument — the humane way, in the long term, is the
only way this nation can survive in its present form and
remain at peace.
At some point soon, the frightful chain of
international violence and mistrust must be broken.
America is not an illogical candidate among the great
powers to take bold steps in this direction, the most
important of which might be reconstruction aid for
North Vietnam.
We have, at certain times in the past, been a rather
generous nation. And while it is much easier to be
generous with a nation we defeated in war than one
which defied and humiliated the myth of our power, I
believe we are capable even of generosity toward a
nation we could not defeat.
The political shape of this issue must cause one to
wonder, however. Liberals in Congress are threatening to
make reconstruction aid a hostage in their battle with
the President over impounded funds and vetoed
appropriations. Conservatives in Congress are bellowing

that not a cent of American aid will ever go to a nation
which so savagely mistreated our prisoners.
George McGovern, up for reelection next year in his
conservative home state, has swallowed his humanitarian
pride and come out unequivocally against aid for North
Vietnam. Richard Nixon, wanting very much to
maintain the settlement that Kissinger negotiated, has
swallowed hii? vengeful pride and come out in favor of it.
The irony of this political configuration should not
deter the peace movement in this country from pressing
vigorously for reconstruction aid. Peace is more
important than any political allegiance, than any
partisan debate. Every dove in Congress who tries to
make the North Vietnamese 1 people pay for Richard
Nixon's domestic intransigence is making a terrible and
cruel mistake.
There is more to be concerned with than the
destruction we have inflicted and ought to feel some
moral responsibility to repair. There is the question of
how we wish to define our relations with the Third
World in this changing international scene, whether we
are willing to cooperate rather than dominate.
It is a question that all the great powers must face
jointly. If Russia, China, America, Europe and Japan
cannot establish some kind of world order that sanely
and systematically regulates the competition for world
resources, continued war is inevitable. And if that order
is to be only a modern carving of the globe into new
spheres of influence, the great powers will have their
pieces of the globe shoved back into their faces in a
different kind of war, just as ugly.
Same Bag
Expanding industrialization and • modernization are
forcing all of mankind into the same bag. The world's
reservoirs of resources are not sufficient to meet
everybody's rising expectations. There must be some
kind of international agreement to allocate them
rationally and systematically, fairly and cooperatively.
Perhaps such a world order is too much to expect
from a species that has so often degerated into greedy
conflict, but there is some hope that the inevitability of
mutual destruction as the only alternative will force just
such an order upon us.
A few billion dollars in aid to North Vietnam may
seem a meaninglessly small step toward a humanitarian
foreign policy and a reasoned world order. But it is also
a radical step for a nation that has never been so
humiliated in war before.
Human destiny can be affected by such radical acts of
magnanimity, however small, that step back from the
abyss of greed and pride and cruelty and war into which
nations have for so long been furiously marching.
If he is really serious about it, it is somewhat
shocking to see Richard Nixon sponsoring so radical a
step. And it wo uld be tragic irony of the worst kind if
reconstruction aid was killed in Congress because the
peace movement in America retired and withdrew when
its real work was only just beginning.
