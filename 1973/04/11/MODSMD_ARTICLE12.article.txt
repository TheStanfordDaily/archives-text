Beutelsbach Comment
Editor:
As a student member of the
Subcommittee on the Germany
campus I would like to comment
on the recent changes in the
language requirement at the
Beutelsbach campus. First, this
change is a temporary one which
will extend only through the
Summer-Fall 1973 group. The
language requirement has been
reduced to the equivalent of
German I at the home campus. In
other wurds, students who have
taken German I are now eligible
to participate in the overseas
program. To compensate for a
lower level of competence in
German, a special intensive class
will be designed by Professor
Lohnes of the German dept.
The basic consideration which
must be an integral part of any
planned program change is that
which the Merryman Commission
report stressed in its opening
paragraphs. The needs and desires
of the student body change and
programs must likewise change if
the program is to continue in
existence.
The language change at
Beutelsbach is experimental. Its
purpose is to determine if
intensive German instruction

there can provide students with a
better working knowledge of the
language. It will test an alternative
method of language training to
determine if it better suits the
academic needs of the campus.
The results of this experiment will
be evaluated in conjunction with
other proposed changes in order
to design a program which more
fully meets both student needs
and desires and provides an
improved academic environment.
I would urge all students who
want to relate their education to a
different culture in a meaningful
way to visit the Overseas Campus
Office and investigate the
possibility of going to the German
campus this summer. It will be
time well spent.

Sincerity Doubtful
Editor:
In a recent circular, ASSU
Presidential candidates Vai.
Petten, Flohr, Anderson, and
Schott lanibast the ASSU's
indifference to the issue of tuition
increases, and imply that they will
change things. This charge is
ironic in that while ASSU

Presidents Appel and Wong were
among the founders of the
Coalition on Student Tuition
(COST), and devoted considerable
time to its organization, ASSU
President Van Petten chose to
completely ignore the tuition
controversy. As a co-founder and
organizer of COST, I can testify
that neither Van Petten nor any
of his running mates evei came to
a meeting of COST, or ever
offered their support on the
tuition issue.
While I welcome these men's
professed concern with tuition
increases, in view of their past
neglect of this area and in light of
their present political aspirations,
I cannot help but doubt of theii
sincerity.
