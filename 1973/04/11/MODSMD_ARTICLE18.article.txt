# Film Critic Sees Cop Movie Advent
## 
### VALERIE LEZIN 
Pauline Kael, movie critic and
columnist for the New Yorker,
speaking in Tresidder Union
Friday night, claimed that a long
succession of "cop" movies is
coming, in the wake of successful
trends of cowboy and flower
children films.
The critic answered questions
from a crowd of approximately
450 people on movies and their
effects, producers, directors, and
stars.
Common motifs, both violent
and subtle, may be attributed to
movie companies, according to
Kael. She indicated that the
companies all follow success. Thus
more "cop" movies will follow
the successful film "The French
Connection," perhaps indicating a
new respect for effective law
enforcement.
According to the columnist,
movies indicate the reality in
society and show what is
happening within the culture
faster than any other medium.
"They [the movies] are moving so
damned fast," Kael said, citing the
change in movie heroes as a way
of relating to "what's going on."
Kael attributed some of
"what's going on" to the movies
themselves. "A certain kind of
callousness and insensitivity sets
in" after watching 'Dirty Harry'
and The French Connection.'"
Kael saw a problem in peoples'
ability to respond to the
complexity of a movie like the
Passion of Joan of Arc, after
viewing action T.V. "When
something is tender or
sublte ... you no longer
respond."
Different films elicit different
reactions, Kael indicated. It is the
movie companies that determine
which films will be produced.
"Movie companies don't care
about politics; only profits," Kael
stated. However, actors, actresses
and their roles sometimes conflict

with the companies. 'They
[hollywood movie companies]
hate Brando." Paramount
wouldn't fund a picture starring
him.
Actesses have more problems
finding appropriate roles. Kael
cited Streisand and Minnelli as
"strong women" among the best
actresses. They're "not pleasant,
pretty types." However, there
have be* n no strong women roles
sine the 30s. 'The movie
audience has been dominated by
men" so difficulties arise in
creating strong women roles. They
make men uncomfortable, Kael
cla.med. "It was much easier
when they [women] were
wise-cracking good broads.
Adventurous and individual
jmen are a threat to
marriage and the sanctity of the
Church."
Even directors sometimes
( nflict with the companies. Kael
s J ited th nt new movie makers are
"crushed." 'They [companies]
are still penalizing people who try
and do it their own way in
Hollywood."
The reviewer claimed that the
companies decide the success or
failure of their productions using
the press. "If movie companies
don't take advantage of the press,
the movie will die."
Kael referred to the "immense
influence" that critics have had in
the last five years. She said that
people that for a movie they want
to see.
Kael advocated that reviewers
level with their audience, to
maintain their influece. "You
can't say it's great when it's
interesting or promising."
Via her reviews, Kael attempts
to scare people away from a few
bad movies. However, she usually
points out reasons someone might
enjoy it "even with flaws." "It's
lousy to make fun of bad movies.
They have to be bad in some
interesting way."
