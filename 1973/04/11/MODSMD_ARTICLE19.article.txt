# 'Payday' Presents Predictable Plot
## 
### ROBERT SHERWOOD 
Directed by Daryl Duke
Written by Don Carpenter
Produced by Martin Fink
"Payday" is a low-budget film
that brings a new genre of
exploitation to the screen: behind
the scene with a country-western
music star. Once this is
established, it is a thouroughly

Entertainment

predictable effort. There is
"tough" dialogue, groupies, booze
and pills, balling in the back seat
of a Cadillac, a few fights, and the
expected climactic death of the
star.'
Rip Torn, who has also
appeared in 'The Cincinnati Kid"
and "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof,"
plays Maury Dann, a rising

Cowboy music star in the South.
Torn performs well as a tough and
cynical character whose sole aim
with music is "payday." The
movie begins at a concert, traces
the next day on the road, his
arrival in Birmingham, and the
final denouement that day.
The tone of the film is clearly
established with the first activity

Maury Dann engages in: making
love to an enthusiastic fan in the
back of his Cadillac after the last
song of the concert. He is paid,
and returns to his motel room and
girlfriend, played by Anna Capri.
The plot thickens as it becomes
apparent that he is tiring of her.
The next morning he visits his
mother before setting out on a

bird hunt with another member of
his band. She is cross and
bedridden until he dumps a stack
of pills in her lap. The hunt is a
success as they pump shotgun
round after siiotgun rourrl into
fleeing birds.
Maury then proceeds to
fistfight with the other member of
his band over whether or not he
can buy his hunting dog. When
the familiar fight is over, Maury
simply gives the dog away and
fires the man.
That day is spent on the road,
with Maury proceeding to make
love to a newcomer, played by
Elayne Heilveil, again in his
Cadillac with his girlfriend
present. The girlfriend becomes
angry; Maury orders the car to a
halt and throws her out the door.
Later he stops in on his divorced
wife with presents for his sons.
He learns that his sons are five
years older than he thought they
were, but this does not visibly
have any effect on him.

That night Maury is called a
rapist by the boyfriend of one of
his enthusiastic fans and has a
knife pulled on him outside a
restaurant. In a terribly phony
fashion, Maury turns the knife
around and kills the man. The
immediate reaction of his manager
is "We can't afford this." The
chauffeur is made to stand in for
him, and they proceed on to
Birmingham for a big recording
date.
Upon arriving, they learn that
the chauffeur has not presented a
suitable story, and Maury is asked
to return and face questioning. In
a burst of anger, he drives off with
his new chauffeur, a young and
aspiring songwriter, in the back
seat.
They speed down a dirt lane;
Maury suddenly goes into a state
of unexplained shock; the car
lurches into a cornfield and comes
to a stop. The kid gets out slowly,
sees Maury who apparently is
dead, and runs off down the road

as the camera rises above the
trees.
Uninspired Direction
Daryl Duke's direction is
uninspired and straightforward.
Apart from effectively realistic
dialogue, "Payday" is a rambling
narrative of contemporary
stereotyping, from the submissive
groupie to the businesslike road
manager.
True to today's new model
film, there is a Director of
Photography in the credits,
Richard C. Glouner. However,
there is little novelty in the
photography as it pans on moving
cars, across motel fronts, and
down country lanes.
Without much problem the
film was shot on location in
restaurants and motels, a house or
two, and along a few rural roads.
A Cinemobile, or fully equipped
film truck, was used to shoot the
film, in keeping with the
industry's new low-budget
philosophy.
One does not have to look very
hard to find a "message" in this
film. Balling, booze, pills, and
endless days on the road are the
payoff for the successful
musician, and they result in
alienation, irritability, and
contempt for any true affection.
"Payday" will no doubt show a
considerable profit, for it has all
the necessary ingredients of
today's R-rated entertainment.
