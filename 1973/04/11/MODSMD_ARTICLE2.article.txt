# $300 Million Goal
## Fund Drive Finishes First Year 
### JIM WASCHER 
Today marks the first anniversary
of the announcement of the five-year,
$300 million Campaign for Stanford.
The Campaign is probably the most
ambitious fund-raising drive ever
launched by a private university.
Kenneth M. Cuthbertson,
University vice president for
development, believes that the
Campaign was necessary because, "in
our long-range financial forecasts, the
total for all income sources [was]
grossly insufficient to maintain
Stanford's leadership role as a quality
university."
According to Cuthbertson, "income
sources other than gifts are not only
likely to remain sluggish but there is
little we can do, that we are not
already trying to do, to improve the
situation.
"Gifts, however, we can affect," he
continued, "and . .. there is plenty of
evidence that gift receipts are very
closely proportionate to gift
procurement efforts."
Beyond the $300 million goal for
the drive itself, University financial
administrators hope the Campaign will
stimulate an increase in private gifts to
Stanford from their pre-Campaign
level of about $29 million a year to
over $50 million after 1977.
Nucleus Fund
The Campaign was launched with a
$45 million nucleus fund; an
anonymous donor contributed $15
million to this nucleus. University
authorities are expected to announce
today that gifts and pledges in
addition to the nucleus fund have
totalled in excess of $50 million in the
last year.
Campaign objectives include $125
million in endowments, $92 million to
meet current operating needs and $83
million for critical building
requirements.
The largest portions of the
endowments sought are for

professorships ($42 million) and for
student financial aid. Obtaining these
endowments will free for other
academic projects the general
university funds which now must be
used for faculty salaries and student
scholarships. A typical endowed
professorship here requires a
contribution of $600,000.
Better than half of the funds raised

for current operating needs will go
toward instruction and research.
New Library
Of the $83 million for buildings,
$19.7 will be used for a massive
expansion of the University's Main
Library facilities. A new building will
eventually connect the Meyer Library
with the Main Library. $16 million are
intended for the Medical School and
Medical Center, $12 million will be
required for renovation of the Quad
and $6.9 million will go to the new
Law School complex now under
construction between the Post Office
and the Meyer Library.
Volunteers perform most of the
work required for the Campaign. They
are divided into three committees:
major gifts, for those seeking donors
of $100,000 or more; special gifts, for
those soliciting gifts between $10,000
and $100,000; and the Annual Fund,
for handling donors of less than
$10,000.
Three Assignments
According to Campaign
communication director David Fulton,
each of the 100 volunteers in the
major gifts committee "will undertake
three assignments during the five
years." The potential donor to whom
a volunteer is assigned is identified by
the University's General Secretary's
office "as having the capacity to make
a gift of $100,000 or more."
In addition to a number of
substantial trustee donations, the
major gifts volunteers have solicited
$7.5 from the Fairchild Foundation
for a neurosciences wing at the
Medical Center, and three million
dollars from the Lucie Stern Trust and
$2.5 million from the Henry Crown
family .of Chicago, both for the new
Law School.
Kenneth D. Creighton, deputy vice
president for business and finance, has
emphasized that the Campaign

resulted from a recognition that
"unless we work harder at income,
university expenses will outstrap
income," as they did in the
mid-sixties. Creighton said that,
through the Campaign, "we are trying
to work on the financial underpinnings
of the University."

Today marks the first anniversary
of the announcement of the five-year,
$300 million Campaign for Stanford.
The Campaign is probably the most
ambitious fund-raising drive ever
launched by a private university.
Kenneth M. Cuthbertson,
University vice president for
development, believes that the
Campaign was necessary because, "in
our long-range financial forecasts, the
total for all income sources [was]
grossly insufficient to maintain
Stanford's leadership role as a quality
university."
According to Cuthbertson, "income
sources other than gifts are not only
likely to remain sluggish but there is
little we can do, that we are not
already trying to do, to improve the
situation.
"Gifts, however, we can affect," he
continued, "and . .. there is plenty of
evidence that gift receipts are very
closely proportionate to gift
procurement efforts."
Beyond the $300 million goal for
the drive itself, University financial
administrators hope the Campaign will
stimulate an increase in private gifts to
Stanford from their pre-Campaign
level of about $29 million a year to
over $50 million after 1977.
Nucleus Fund
The Campaign was launched with a
$45 million nucleus fund; an
anonymous donor contributed $15
million to this nucleus. University
authorities are expected to announce
today that gifts and pledges in
addition to the nucleus fund have
totalled in excess of $50 million in the
last year.
Campaign objectives include $125
million in endowments, $92 million to
meet current operating needs and $83
million for critical building
requirements.
The largest portions of the
endowments sought are for

professorships ($42 million) and for
student financial aid. Obtaining these
endowments will free for other
academic projects the general
university funds which now must be
used for faculty salaries and student
scholarships. A typical endowed
professorship here requires a
contribution of $600,000.
Better than half of the funds raised

for current operating needs will go
toward instruction and research.
New Library
Of the $83 million for buildings,
$19.7 will be used for a massive
expansion of the University's Main
Library facilities. A new building will
eventually connect the Meyer Library
with the Main Library. $16 million are
intended for the Medical School and
Medical Center, $12 million will be
required for renovation of the Quad
and $6.9 million will go to the new
Law School complex now under
construction between the Post Office
and the Meyer Library.
Volunteers perform most of the
work required for the Campaign. They
are divided into three committees:
major gifts, for those seeking donors
of $100,000 or more; special gifts, for
those soliciting gifts between $10,000
and $100,000; and the Annual Fund,
for handling donors of less than
$10,000.
Three Assignments
According to Campaign
communication director David Fulton,
each of the 100 volunteers in the
major gifts committee "will undertake
three assignments during the five
years." The potential donor to whom
a volunteer is assigned is identified by
the University's General Secretary's
office "as having the capacity to make
a gift of $100,000 or more."
In addition to a number of
substantial trustee donations, the
major gifts volunteers have solicited
$7.5 from the Fairchild Foundation
for a neurosciences wing at the
Medical Center, and three million
dollars from the Lucie Stern Trust and
$2.5 million from the Henry Crown
family .of Chicago, both for the new
Law School.
Kenneth D. Creighton, deputy vice
president for business and finance, has
emphasized that the Campaign

resulted from a recognition that
"unless we work harder at income,
university expenses will outstrap
income," as they did in the
mid-sixties. Creighton said that,
through the Campaign, "we are trying
to work on the financial underpinnings
of the University."
