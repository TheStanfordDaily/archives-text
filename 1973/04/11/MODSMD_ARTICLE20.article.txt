## ACT's 'Crucible': Last And Least 
### DAVID THIEMANN 
In the American Conservatory
Theater production of "The
Crucible," now playing in
repertory at the Geary
Theater, director William Ball has
magnified the play's overdrawn
value conflict into caricature,
transforming tragedy into an
almost-ludicrous melodrama.
Modern critics have often
censured playwright Arthur Miller
for an improbable, good versus
evil drama, but director Ball has
exaggerated this weakness with
shrill ritual and elaborate staging.
And although the production

features some of ACT's finest
people, Ball's interpretation
clearly inhibits their acting,
relegating them to shallow,
inhuman roles.
The opening night audience
last week responded to all this by
tittering at the play's drama and
tragedy—and Ball's production
deserved nothing more.
From the first scene, Ball
distracts his audience with
thundering music, a stage
cluttered with unnecessary
tableaux, we 11 -orchestrated
hysteria, and a silent, omnipresent
executioner lurking in doorways.

If the setting alone does not
confuse the audience the actors
will. They almost all speak rapidly
and loudly, demanding close
attention merely to understand
the lines, without exploring
motivation or charcter
development.
These distractions dilute the
drama of the play, and cloud the
vacillation and moral conflict
within John Proctor and Reverend
John Hale, two of the central
characters.
Peter Donat plays Proctor, a
farmer whose wife stands accused
in the Salem witch trials, with an
unusual dimension of humor and
bluster. But however
well-conceived this interpretation,
it fails when Proctor continues to
bluster in serious moments, as his
wife and friends are imprisoned.
Paul Shenar acts the part of
Hale, a well-meaning cleric who
slowly comprehends the evil of
the witch-trials. Unfortunately,
Shenar delays Hale's overt inner
conflict, playing trial scenes with
restraint.
Same Error
In this production, Hale and
Proctor suffer from the same
dramatic error: both delay and
muddle their moral conflict, and
hence fail to develop beyond
dramatic skeletons.
Marsha Mason plays Abigail
Williams, the 18-year-old girl who
begins the witch-hunt and directs
denunciations by other children,
with one-sided shrillness. Ball
apparently chose to downplay
Abigail's love for Proctor, instead
presenting her in stark, evil terms
as an adulteress and murderer.
The director also
conspicuously failed to temper
the performances of the hysterical
children, casting them as
malicious, spiteful brats rather
than frightened, intimidated
witnesses who tried to avoid
whipping and hanging themselves.
Barbara Colby acts the part of
Elizabeth Proctor with an
eccentric interpretation of remote
coldness, lending plausibility to
Proctor's affair with Abigail, but
neglecting the pious, honest
loyalty which motivates her
during and after the trials.
No Credibility
Ray Reinhardt, as Deputy
Governor Danforth, comported

himself as a callous blackguard,
without any sign of the fanatical
Christianity which dominated the
Salem trials and without the
humanity which would give
credibility to his part. Robert
Mooney played Reverend Parris in
the same way, acting the part of a
self-serving scoundrel without
showing fear or sympathy.
This play is ACT's seventh and

last of the season, and shows it.
Even within Ball's misguided
interpretation, the company could
act better than it does if it were
not presenting several other plays
simultaneously. Shenar, for
instance, is now performing in
four others, and Donat is acting
two other leads.
As last of the season, it is also
worst.
