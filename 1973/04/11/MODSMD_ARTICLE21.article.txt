# Moliere Drama Performed
## 
### RUST EDDIE 
In its only Stanford
appearance, Le Treteau de Paris
performed Moliere's 'The Doctor
in Spite of Himself" plus excerpts
from 'The Misanthrope" and
"Don Juan" Saturday at Memorial
Auditorium. The large audience,
unless it was composed of better
actors than those on the stage,
gave every indication of loving
what it saw.
Currently on its North
American tour, Le Treteau de
Paris, repertory foreign legion for
the Comedie Francaise, is
commemorating Moliere's death
300 years ago. In perhaps the best
of Moliere's farces, "The Doctor
in Spite of Himself," produced in
1666, Moliere deals harshly with
the medical profession of Louis

XlV's day.
Moliere's health began to
deteriorate in 1665 and his satires
against doctors increased in direct
proportion to his failing health.
There is little need to seek any
private motive for these attacks:
nine-tenths of the science of
medicine in the 17th century was
pure grimace. Gifted at
uncovering poseurs in the realms
of religion, art and science,
Moliere could not fail, as he came
to know them, to add doctors to
his list as well.
Economy
A less confident nation than
France might have been tempted,
in staging a tricentennial abroad,
to lavish a big budget on the usual
panorama-proscenium. Instead,
France has nimbly undermined

her stage, distilling, with usual
economy and fashion, the essence
in one unfinished pine set,
reminiscent of those peoples'
sculptures which have graced
White Plaza in past seasons,
usually spring. Serving by proxy
as a scaffolding for her literary
genius, here, Moliere, this anti-set
avoids obstructing fine views of
even finer actors.
Yves Pignot, playing the lead as
Sganarelle in the featured work,
"The Doctor in Spite of Himself,"
faultlessly overacted, his face and
torso being so consistently
expressive it was hard, despite
admittedly varied language
handicaps among the audience,
not to understand him.
Pignot's Equal
Anne-Marie-Quentin, who

starred opposite Yves Pignot as
Martine, Sganarelle's vindictive
wife, proved Pignot's equal with a
voice like vinegar on sandpaper.
Performers in a sense are only the
raw materials of Moliere theatre.
The transformative ingredient
is language. To cavil at Moliere for
the talkiness of his plays is to
misunderstand his materials and
his intentions. It is almost as if the
potential fine performance has a
static quality too close to art,
which Moliere wants to infect
with the blight of words.
Moliere underscores this in
Scene I of Act II of "Don Juan,"
one of two excerpts performed
Saturday in addition to 'The
Doctor in Spite of Himself," by
writing the dialogue in a peasant
patois.
Moliere's frequent wit and
wisdom augmented by radiant
performances from the entire cast
testify to an illustrious
playwright's lasting tribute to his
lustrous culture.
