# Golfers Outputted By Hot Spartans

### DAVE ROBINSON 
SAN JOSE — After nine holes
Monday at San Jose Country
Club, it jooked like Stanford and
San Jose State were in the midst
of another one of their
suspense-filled golf matches that
typically aren't decided until the
final player hits his final putt on
the final green.
But the script folded on the
back nine as the Spartans holed
every putt in sight and most of
the Cards putted like aging
20-handicappers, giving SJS a
convincing 33-21 victory.
The sudden turn of events
came as a surprise to all of the
golfers, but the most shocked
Cardinal was Dave Baskins, who
watched helplessly as his Spartan
opponent went birdie-birdie
birdie-eagle-par on the final five
holes. Going into the 14th hole
Baskins held a three stroke lead
over San Jose's Don Thames, but
after Thames' incredible finish,
Baskins wound up a very
frustrated five shot loser.
Thames fired an even par 70
for the round, but his score was
only second best for the Spartans.
Phil Barry recorded a 69 as he
coasted to an easy 12 shot victory
over Conrad Nilmeier. Dean May
also played outstanding golf for
San Jose, matching par in his
70-75 victory over Denny Colvin.
Meanwhile the best
Stanford could manage was Aly
Trompas' 74. Trompas defeated
Mark Lye in the number one
match, an impressive victory since

L>e won the Individual title at the
University ot Pacific Invitational
over the weekend.
Colvin and Baskins were next
for the Cards with 755, Bob
Chapman shot 78, George
Pettinger defeated his opponent
with a 79, and Nilmeier shot 81.
Last year the Cards defeated
the Spartans 30-24 at San Jose
Country Club and the two teams
tied 27-27 at bianfoid. Earlier this*
year SJS and Stanford tied for
first in the Cal State Hayward
tournament. Both teams are
entered in major medal play
tournaments at Fresno,
Pasatiempo, and Stanford the
next three weekends, and a second
dual match is scheduled for May
5.
