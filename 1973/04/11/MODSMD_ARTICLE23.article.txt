# Shuffling The Cards
## Chris Looks Ahead 
### Dave Robinson 
Jack Christiansen behaved a lot like a football player and a lot like
a football coach yesterday as he strolled down the first fairway of the
Stanford golf course.
Football player Christiansen hit two booming wood shots on the
par five hole before displaying a football player's touch around the
green, eventually making a bogey six. But football coach Christiansen
didn't seem too disturbed about his golfing misfortunes as he
discussed his Cardinal team, which opens spring practice on Saturday.
"We're looking forward to spring with the idea of trying to build a
lot of intensity into our football program," Chris said. "There should
be a lot of enthusiasm created by the competition for all the open
positions."
Christiansen loses 26 lettermen from last year's 6-5 team, but he
seems anxious to face the challenge of his second year as Stanford's
head coach. "I enjoyed coaching last year more than ever before —
either in college or in the pros," he said, "and I'm looking forward to
coaching a younger team this year."
Chris emphasized that spring practice is "basically to improve
techniques," but he indicated that much of the offensive work this
spring would be aimed at bolstering the Cardinal running game, which
accounted for only 107.8 yards a game last season, seventh in the
Pac-8.
"We're going to try to install the option play to improve our
running game. We plan to use the same type of option Stanford used
with Jim Plunkett—we think Mike Boryla is as good a runner or better
than Plunkett."
Chris explained that most teams would try to prevent Boryla from
making the pitchout to explosive halfback John Winesberry, leaving a
lot of running room inside for the Cardinal quarterback. Many have
doubted Boryla's speed in the past, but according to Christiansen,
Boryla has run the 40 in 4.9.
Defensively, Stanford won't be doing much different. "We'll
continue to use even fronts and odd fronts so our opponents can't key
on one defense," Chris said.
"The coaches feel like the thing we need to do is teach the
techniques and develop a better defense against the run. We had a
good pass defense last year [Stanford led the league in that
department], but we were weak against the run."(The Cards were
fifth in the Pac-8 in rushing defense.)
Of course Christiansen will have to find the personnel to
accomplish these goals, a task that could be difficult since Stanford
has fewer starters returning than any other team in the Pac-8. Only
eight starters are back from last year, four each on offense and
defense.
Still, Christiansen is cautiously optimistic. "As we see it USC and
UCLA are still the teams to beat,"he said, "but we think we have as
good a chance as anybody to knock them off, especially with another
year of eligibility for Mike Boryla. It's nice to start the season with an
established and talented quarterback."
A healthy Winesberry would also be a big plus for 1973, along with
defensive back Randy Poltl, defensive end Roger Stillwell, and
placekicker Rod Garcia, all of whom should be leading candidates for
all-league and ail-American recognition.
There are still several obvious question marks, but at least until
Saturday, Jack Christiansen will remain optimistic as he strolls down
the fairways, Penn State and Michigan still lodged far in the back of
his mind.
