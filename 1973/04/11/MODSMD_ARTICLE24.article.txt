# Cards Warm Up With Two Wins
## 
### 
Stanford's baseball team
warmed up for its big three-game
series with USC this weekend with
two non-league victories, blanking
USF 7-0 at Sunken Diamond
Monday and outslugging San Jose
State 7 2 yesterday in San Jose.
Freshman D..ve Baker provided
the punch and Dave Frost
provided the pitching Monday

against the Dons. Baker slugged
two home runs, scored three runs,
drove in two and collected three
hits in leading the Card attack.
Frost pitched shutout ball for
seven innings, allowing only four
hits while striking out six. Bob
DiPietro held USF hitless the last
two innings to preserve the
shutout. Bob Hampton drove in

two runs with a homer as
Hampton and Baker accounted
for five RBl's.
Against San Jose State
Tuesday, Spartan Rick Pitney led
off with a triple in the second
inning and rode home on a Rod
Bressau single to give San Jose
State a short-lived one run lead.
The Cards replied with a six-run
outburst during the next inning to
put the game away. Mike Higgings
got the victory, improving his
record to 2-2.
This afternoon the Cards will
play their final tuneup for the
USC series when they host UC
Davis at 2:30 p.m. at Sunken
Diamond.
