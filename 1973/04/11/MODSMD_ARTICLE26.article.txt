Air Crash Kills 106
HOCHWALD, Switzerland — A British housewives'
shopping trip to a Swiss spring fair turned into tragedy
yesterday with the crash of their chartered airliner on a
blizzard-swept hilltop.
Police said 106 of the 146 on board the flight from
Bristol, England, perished. Sixty-three of the women were
from the village of Axbridge in South-west England. The
village has a population of only about 1,000.
The four-engine Vickers Vanguard turboprop had a
crew of seven. Some of the 40 survivors of the crash got
out of the plane unhurt.
The women had paid the equivalent of $41 for the
flight to the spring fair in nearby Basel for a day of
shopping and then a return home by midnight.
The aircraft apparently overshot Basel's airport and
swung over this town 10 miles to the south. One survivor
said a wing of the plane hit a treetop and the aircraft spun
in the air and crashed.
A blizzard that dumped 15 inches of snow blocked the
route of rescue teams for two hours. Men finally made it
on foot and the Swiss army sent helicopters to fly out.
survivors.
Rescuers tracked survivors' footprints in the snow to
reach the wreckage. One survivor, identified only as B.
Gillow, was found unhurt and wandering some distance
from the crash site.
Most of the passengers were housewives in their 20s
from a British women's club. Some had brought their
children. Also on board were 20 British nurses and several
British traders and innkeepers.
At Axbridge, the postmistress, Jill Helps, wept and
said, "We are out of our minds .. . it's as though everyone
we know was on that plane — the postman's wife, the
news agent's wife, the builder's wife, the butcher's
wife . .
Approaching Basel in foul weather, the pilot overflew
the airport, pulled up and headed south into a blinding
snowstorm. The plane crashed on a hilltop 10 miles away.
Lebanon Premier Resigns
BEIRUT, Lebanon — Premier Saeb Salam resigned
yesterday in the aftermath of the Israeli commando raids
against Palestinian guerrillas in the heart of Lebanon.
Salam submitted the resignation of his government to
President Saleiman Franjieh after a Cabinet meeting called
to discuss Monday's attacks that killed three top guerrilla
leaders.
President Franjieh said he would decide today whether
to accept Salam's resignation. Salam has been in and out
of the premiership since 1960.
Earlier in the day, Palestinian guerrilla leaders vowed
revenge for the commando raids by escalating their war on
Israel and possibly targeting U.S. firms in the Middle East
for terrorist attacks.
The Palestine Liberation Organization charged that the
U.S. Central Intelligence Agency helped carry out the
attack, and said: "The resolution will continue to pursue
the enemy everywhere, inside and outside occupied
territory."
A spokesman at the U.S. Embassy denied the charge,
and the State Department said in Washington that the
charges were "utterly without foundation."
But the fact the guerrillas made the charge raised fears
in some quarters that American concerns in the oil-rich

Middle East might become targets of the guerrillas.
Arab radio stations denounced the Israeli raid and said
the United States was implicated.
Security measures around the U.S. Embassy were
tightened after some 150 Palestinian students tried to
march on the seaside building. Troops in armored cars and
personnel carriers turned them back.
Other troops guarded key points in this Mediterranean
city. Mass funerals were planned for the three slain
Palestinian leaders tomorrow.
In Tel Aviv, the chief of staff warned that Israel may
hit the Lebanese capital again unless authorities curb the
activities of armed Palestinian organizations.
"It is impossible to honor the sovereignty of Lebanon
and its capital when there is complete freedom for the
terrorists, their bases and commands in Lebanese
territory," said Lt. Gen. David Elazer.
US Airlifts Fuel To Cambodia
SAIGON — The United States began airlifting fuel
yesterday into Cambodia's capital, whose main supply
routes have been cut or harassed by Communist command
forces.
The airlift was announced by the U.S. Embassy in
Phnom Penh and the Pentagon in Washington. A CI3O
Hercules transport came in with the first load of fuel in a
huge plastic bladder and unloaded it at Phnom Penh's
airport.
The Pentagon disclosed that since July, an average of
10 cargo planes daily had been carrying supplies, mostly
military, to the Cambodian capital.
Pentagon spokesman Jerry W. Friedheim declined to
give the maximum number of flights in any one day for
the new airlift but said, "This is not a major airlift."
In Phnom Penh an embassy spokesman said that
without fuel resupply the city would have to shut down
electricity generators and water pumps.
Five tankers arrived in Phnom Penh Sunday and
Monday after passage up the Communist threatened
Mekong River. They added two weeks' supply to the
city's reserves, but the government was pessimistic of any
more ships making the 60-mile run fro.n the South
Vietnamese border.
All major roads to Phnom Penh have been severed for
more than three weeks by Khmer Rouge insurgents and
their North Vietnamese and Viet Cong allies despite
massive U.S. air support for government forces.
Thieu Meets Protest In Bonn
BONN, Germany — Leftist, anti-U.S. demonstrators,
protesting a visit by Nguyen Van Thieu, wrecked Bonn's
historic City Hall yesterday shortly before the South
Vietnamese president called on President Gastav
Heinemann.
Scores of demonstrators and 14 policemen were
injured in clashes outside City Hall.
During a 45-minute talk, Heinemann asked Thieu for
better treatment of political prisoners. Thieu then left for
political talks in South Korea and Formosa.

Arab radio stations denounced the Israeli raid and said
the United States was implicated.
Security measures around the U.S. Embassy were

US Airlifts Fuel To Cambodia
SAIGON — The United States began airlifting fuel
yesterday into Cambodia's capital, whose main supply
routes have been cut or harassed by Communist command
forces.
The airlift was announced by the U.S. Embassy in
Phnom Penh and the Pentagon in Washington. A CI3O
Hercules transport came in with the first load of fuel in a
huge plastic bladder and unloaded it at Phnom Penh's
airport.
The Pentagon disclosed that since July, an average of
10 cargo planes daily had been carrying supplies, mostly
military, to the Cambodian capital.
Pentagon spokesman Jerry W. Friedheim declined to
give the maximum number of flights in any one day for
the new airlift but said, "This is not a major airlift."
In Phnom Penh an embassy spokesman said that
without fuel resupply the city would have to shut down
electricity generators and water pumps.
Five tankers arrived in Phnom Penh Sunday and
Monday after passage up the Communist threatened
Mekong River. They added two weeks' supply to the
city's reserves, but the government was pessimistic of any
more ships making the 60-mile run fro.n the South
Vietnamese border.
All major roads to Phnom Penh have been severed for
more than three weeks by Khmer Rouge insurgents and
their North Vietnamese and Viet Cong allies despite
massive U.S. air support for government forces.

Air Crash Kills 106
HOCHWALD, Switzerland — A British housewives'
shopping trip to a Swiss spring fair turned into tragedy
yesterday with the crash of their chartered airliner on a
blizzard-swept hilltop.
Police said 106 of the 146 on board the flight from
Bristol, England, perished. Sixty-three of the women were
from the village of Axbridge in South-west England. The
village has a population of only about 1,000.
The four-engine Vickers Vanguard turboprop had a
crew of seven. Some of the 40 survivors of the crash got
out of the plane unhurt.
The women had paid the equivalent of $41 for the
flight to the spring fair in nearby Basel for a day of
shopping and then a return home by midnight.
The aircraft apparently overshot Basel's airport and
swung over this town 10 miles to the south. One survivor
said a wing of the plane hit a treetop and the aircraft spun
in the air and crashed.
A blizzard that dumped 15 inches of snow blocked the
route of rescue teams for two hours. Men finally made it
on foot and the Swiss army sent helicopters to fly out.
survivors.
Rescuers tracked survivors' footprints in the snow to
reach the wreckage. One survivor, identified only as B.
Gillow, was found unhurt and wandering some distance
from the crash site.
Most of the passengers were housewives in their 20s
from a British women's club. Some had brought their
children. Also on board were 20 British nurses and several
British traders and innkeepers.
At Axbridge, the postmistress, Jill Helps, wept and
said, "We are out of our minds .. . it's as though everyone
we know was on that plane — the postman's wife, the
news agent's wife, the builder's wife, the butcher's
wife . .
Approaching Basel in foul weather, the pilot overflew
the airport, pulled up and headed south into a blinding
snowstorm. The plane crashed on a hilltop 10 miles away.
Lebanon Premier Resigns
BEIRUT, Lebanon — Premier Saeb Salam resigned
yesterday in the aftermath of the Israeli commando raids
against Palestinian guerrillas in the heart of Lebanon.
Salam submitted the resignation of his government to

to discuss Monday's attacks that killed three top guerrilla
leaders.
President Franjieh said he would decide today whether

of the premiership since 1960.
Earlier in the day, Palestinian guerrilla leaders vowed
revenge for the commando raids by escalating their war on
Israel and possibly targeting U.S. firms in the Middle East
for terrorist attacks.
The Palestine Liberation Organization charged that the
U.S. Central Intelligence Agency helped carry out the
attack, and said: "The resolution will continue to pursue
the enemy everywhere, inside and outside occupied
territory."
A spokesman at the U.S. Embassy denied the charge,

Air Crash Kills 106
HOCHWALD, Switzerland — A British housewives'
shopping trip to a Swiss spring fair turned into tragedy
yesterday with the crash of their chartered airliner on a
blizzard-swept hilltop.
Police said 106 of the 146 on board the flight from
Bristol, England, perished. Sixty-three of the women were
from the village of Axbridge in South-west England. The
village has a population of only about 1,000.
The four-engine Vickers Vanguard turboprop had a
crew of seven. Some of the 40 survivors of the crash got
out of the plane unhurt.
The women had paid the equivalent of $41 for the
flight to the spring fair in nearby Basel for a day of
shopping and then a return home by midnight.
The aircraft apparently overshot Basel's airport and
swung over this town 10 miles to the south. One survivor
said a wing of the plane hit a treetop and the aircraft spun
in the air and crashed.
A blizzard that dumped 15 inches of snow blocked the
route of rescue teams for two hours. Men finally made it
on foot and the Swiss army sent helicopters to fly out.
survivors.
Rescuers tracked survivors' footprints in the snow to
reach the wreckage. One survivor, identified only as B.
Gillow, was found unhurt and wandering some distance
from the crash site.
Most of the passengers were housewives in their 20s
from a British women's club. Some had brought their
children. Also on board were 20 British nurses and several
British traders and innkeepers.
At Axbridge, the postmistress, Jill Helps, wept and
said, "We are out of our minds .. . it's as though everyone
we know was on that plane — the postman's wife, the
news agent's wife, the builder's wife, the butcher's
wife . .
Approaching Basel in foul weather, the pilot overflew
the airport, pulled up and headed south into a blinding
snowstorm. The plane crashed on a hilltop 10 miles away.
Lebanon Premier Resigns
BEIRUT, Lebanon — Premier Saeb Salam resigned
yesterday in the aftermath of the Israeli commando raids
against Palestinian guerrillas in the heart of Lebanon.
Salam submitted the resignation of his government to
President Saleiman Franjieh after a Cabinet meeting called
to discuss Monday's attacks that killed three top guerrilla
leaders.
President Franjieh said he would decide today whether
to accept Salam's resignation. Salam has been in and out
of the premiership since 1960.
Earlier in the day, Palestinian guerrilla leaders vowed
revenge for the commando raids by escalating their war on
Israel and possibly targeting U.S. firms in the Middle East
for terrorist attacks.
The Palestine Liberation Organization charged that the
U.S. Central Intelligence Agency helped carry out the
attack, and said: "The resolution will continue to pursue
the enemy everywhere, inside and outside occupied
territory."
A spokesman at the U.S. Embassy denied the charge,
and the State Department said in Washington that the
charges were "utterly without foundation."
But the fact the guerrillas made the charge raised fears
in some quarters that American concerns in the oil-rich

Middle East might become targets of the guerrillas.
Arab radio stations denounced the Israeli raid and said
the United States was implicated.
Security measures around the U.S. Embassy were
tightened after some 150 Palestinian students tried to
march on the seaside building. Troops in armored cars and
personnel carriers turned them back.
Other troops guarded key points in this Mediterranean
city. Mass funerals were planned for the three slain
Palestinian leaders tomorrow.
In Tel Aviv, the chief of staff warned that Israel may
hit the Lebanese capital again unless authorities curb the
activities of armed Palestinian organizations.
"It is impossible to honor the sovereignty of Lebanon
and its capital when there is complete freedom for the
terrorists, their bases and commands in Lebanese
territory," said Lt. Gen. David Elazer.
US Airlifts Fuel To Cambodia
SAIGON — The United States began airlifting fuel
yesterday into Cambodia's capital, whose main supply
routes have been cut or harassed by Communist command
forces.
The airlift was announced by the U.S. Embassy in
Phnom Penh and the Pentagon in Washington. A CI3O
Hercules transport came in with the first load of fuel in a
huge plastic bladder and unloaded it at Phnom Penh's
airport.
The Pentagon disclosed that since July, an average of
10 cargo planes daily had been carrying supplies, mostly
military, to the Cambodian capital.
Pentagon spokesman Jerry W. Friedheim declined to
give the maximum number of flights in any one day for
the new airlift but said, "This is not a major airlift."
In Phnom Penh an embassy spokesman said that
without fuel resupply the city would have to shut down
electricity generators and water pumps.
Five tankers arrived in Phnom Penh Sunday and
Monday after passage up the Communist threatened
Mekong River. They added two weeks' supply to the
city's reserves, but the government was pessimistic of any
more ships making the 60-mile run fro.n the South
Vietnamese border.
All major roads to Phnom Penh have been severed for
more than three weeks by Khmer Rouge insurgents and
their North Vietnamese and Viet Cong allies despite
massive U.S. air support for government forces.
Thieu Meets Protest In Bonn
BONN, Germany — Leftist, anti-U.S. demonstrators,

Heinemann.
Scores of demonstrators and 14 policemen were
injured in clashes outside City Hall.
During a 45-minute talk, Heinemann asked Thieu for
better treatment of political prisoners. Thieu then left for
political talks in South Korea and Formosa.
