# Students To Try Luck In Housing Draw
## 
### KITTY PATTERSON 
Between April 16 and 20, students
who want on-campus housing next
year will try their luck in the housing
draw. Choices range from dorms to
trailers, and from theme houses to
fraternities. All residences except
fraternities are filled in the draw.
Confronted by a confusing mass of

information, many students may
panic. Although choosing may be
difficult because there are so many
options, the drawing procedure is
relatively simple, says Assoc. Dean of
Student Affairs Larry Horton. Open
houses are currently being held to help
students decide.
Next Monday, residence offices will

receive draw cards for Round I from
the housing office. All students now
living in University housing will receive
cards.
Each card leaves room for nine
choices — to be listed in order of
preference. Students must bring their
completed cards to the Old Union on
or before April 20. There they draw
numbers out of a fishbowl. Officials at
the housing window will register the
number of his card. Students cannot
change their housing choices after
their numbers have been drawn.
Students may draw either
separately or in groups. Group
members must be of the same sex.
Each member will receive the same
draw number.
Trailer, Apartment Groups
Members should list group
preferences first. Each member may
list individual preferences afterwards.
Students who choose to live in
Manzanita Trailer Park must draw in
groups of four and must list Manzanita

as their first choice. Students who try
to draw into the apartments in
Mirrielees House must draw in groups
of two or four, and must list Mirrielees
as their first choice.
Draw numbers range from one to
5000. The lower a draw number, the
better a student's chance to get into
his first few choices.
Draw number priority is only one
of several criteria used to decide who
will be assigned campus housing. All
students now in housing system except
residents of Toyon and Columbae
qualify for present residence priorities
if they list their present house as a
choice on their draw card.
If a student with present residence
priority draws a number qualifying
him for residence anywhere on
campus, he is guaranteed reassignment
to his present residence or to a
residence listed as a higher choice.
In the past, students have
complained that this priority
discriminates against freshmen living in
all-freshman houses. Horton
emphasizes that present residence
priorities are fair.
"No student who would otherwise
by draw number be excluded from the
system can get in because of a
priority," he insists. "He has an
advantage only in that, if he qualifies,
he can go into a specific residence."
Minority Priorities
Minority students automatically
qualify for minority priorities in
certain houses. All they have to do is
list the appropriate minority program
house on their draw cards.
Junipero will house the
Asian-American program, Zapata the
Chicano program, Soto the Native
American program, and Roble the

black program.
The percentage of minority
students admitted to such housing
varies with the house. The Housing
Office is reserving up to 40 percent of
the spaces in Roble for black students.
Black residents receive first priority;
black students with good draw
numbers rank second on the priority
list, followed by other students with
present residence priorities.
Roble Spaces Reserved
Up to 50 percent of the spaces in
the other minority programs will be
reserved for minority students. The
same ranking system used by Roble
applies to the other houses.
Methods for determining priorities
in Toyon and the independent houses
differ from the dorms. Most houses

request that students look around
before signing priority lists, and a few
of the houses expect prospective
members to meet objective criteria
before they can go on priority lists.
Residents in two houses this year
will not have present residence
priorities for their houses next year.
The Housing Office is planning to
move into Stillman House — the Grove
House next to Lathrop House, turn it
over to Columbae, and make Lasuen
House into the second Grove House.
Explains Horton, "With Columbae
moving in, either Stillman or Lasuen
residents would be displaced." The
Housing Office decided to give
Stillman residents present residence
priority in Lasuen.
Special Arrangements
Lasuen residents, says Horton, will
receive "desirable housing." They will
be given present residence priority just
about anywhere in the system. To
ensure that these students will not
displace other students with equal
priority, representatives from the
Housing Office will negotiate with
each Lasuen student to decide where
he will fit in.
The Housing Office also plans to
make Lathrop House coed. "After
careful statistical analysis of the
demand for women's housing," says
Horton, "we decided that more girls
get single-sex housing than want it."
Lathrop ranked lowest on the
popularity list for women's housing.
Since coed houses on the Row like
Durand and Grove are among the most
popular houses on campus, Horton
predicts that students will respond
favorably to a coed Lathrop.
Lathrop girls will qualify for
present residence priorities in any
single-sex housing they want.
Round II
After Round I of the draw, some
students will still be unassigned.
Others may be dissatisfied with their
assignments.
Around May 7, residence offices
will receive Round I results.
Disgruntled students may then file
response cards for Round 11. They
keep their Round I numbers.
Students assigned in Round II will
fill spaces vacated by first-rdund
rejections. The Housing Office expects
them to accept their Round II
assignments.
If a student is still unassigned at the
end of Round 11, he can sign a waiting
list for university housing after May
24. The housing system has room for
about 70 percent of all
undergraduates, says Horton.
Between April 16 and 20, students
who want on-campus housing next
year will try their luck in the housing
draw. Choices range from dorms to
trailers, and from theme houses to

students admitted to such housing
varies with the house. The Housing
Office is reserving up to 40 percent of
the spaces in Roble for black students.
Black residents receive first priority;
black students with good draw
numbers rank second on the priority
list, followed by other students with
present residence priorities.
Roble Spaces Reserved
Up to 50 percent of the spaces in
the other minority programs will be
reserved for minority students. The
same ranking system used by Roble
applies to the other houses.
Methods for determining priorities
in Toyon and the independent houses
differ from the dorms. Most houses

request that students look around
before signing priority lists, and a few
of the houses expect prospective
members to meet objective criteria
before they can go on priority lists.
Residents in two houses this year
will not have present residence
priorities for their houses next year.
The Housing Office is planning to
move into Stillman House — the Grove
House next to Lathrop House, turn it
over to Columbae, and make Lasuen
House into the second Grove House.
Explains Horton, "With Columbae
moving in, either Stillman or Lasuen
residents would be displaced." The
Housing Office decided to give
Stillman residents present residence
priority in Lasuen.
Special Arrangements
Lasuen residents, says Horton, will
receive "desirable housing." They will
be given present residence priority just
about anywhere in the system. To
ensure that these students will not
displace other students with equal
priority, representatives from the
Housing Office will negotiate with
each Lasuen student to decide where
he will fit in.
The Housing Office also plans to
make Lathrop House coed. "After
careful statistical analysis of the
demand for women's housing," says
Horton, "we decided that more girls
get single-sex housing than want it."
Lathrop ranked lowest on the
popularity list for women's housing.
Since coed houses on the Row like
Durand and Grove are among the most
popular houses on campus, Horton
predicts that students will respond
favorably to a coed Lathrop.
Lathrop girls will qualify for
present residence priorities in any
single-sex housing they want.
Round II
After Round I of the draw, some
students will still be unassigned.
Others may be dissatisfied with their
assignments.
Around May 7, residence offices
will receive Round I results.
Disgruntled students may then file
response cards for Round 11. They
keep their Round I numbers.
Students assigned in Round II will
fill spaces vacated by first-rdund
rejections. The Housing Office expects
them to accept their Round II
assignments.
If a student is still unassigned at the
end of Round 11, he can sign a waiting
list for university housing after May
24. The housing system has room for
about 70 percent of all
undergraduates, says Horton.
Between April 16 and 20, students
who want on-campus housing next
year will try their luck in the housing
draw. Choices range from dorms to
trailers, and from theme houses to
fraternities. All residences except
fraternities are filled in the draw.
Confronted by a confusing mass of

information, many students may
panic. Although choosing may be
difficult because there are so many
options, the drawing procedure is
relatively simple, says Assoc. Dean of
Student Affairs Larry Horton. Open
houses are currently being held to help
students decide.
Next Monday, residence offices will

receive draw cards for Round I from
the housing office. All students now
living in University housing will receive
cards.
Each card leaves room for nine
choices — to be listed in order of
preference. Students must bring their
completed cards to the Old Union on
or before April 20. There they draw
numbers out of a fishbowl. Officials at
the housing window will register the
number of his card. Students cannot
change their housing choices after
their numbers have been drawn.
Students may draw either
separately or in groups. Group
members must be of the same sex.
Each member will receive the same
draw number.
Trailer, Apartment Groups
Members should list group
preferences first. Each member may
list individual preferences afterwards.
Students who choose to live in
Manzanita Trailer Park must draw in
groups of four and must list Manzanita

as their first choice. Students who try
to draw into the apartments in
Mirrielees House must draw in groups
of two or four, and must list Mirrielees
as their first choice.
Draw numbers range from one to
5000. The lower a draw number, the
better a student's chance to get into
his first few choices.
Draw number priority is only one
of several criteria used to decide who
will be assigned campus housing. All
students now in housing system except
residents of Toyon and Columbae
qualify for present residence priorities
if they list their present house as a
choice on their draw card.
If a student with present residence
priority draws a number qualifying
him for residence anywhere on
campus, he is guaranteed reassignment
to his present residence or to a
residence listed as a higher choice.
In the past, students have
complained that this priority
discriminates against freshmen living in
all-freshman houses. Horton
emphasizes that present residence
priorities are fair.
"No student who would otherwise
by draw number be excluded from the
system can get in because of a
priority," he insists. "He has an
advantage only in that, if he qualifies,
he can go into a specific residence."
Minority Priorities
Minority students automatically
qualify for minority priorities in
certain houses. All they have to do is
list the appropriate minority program
house on their draw cards.
Junipero will house the
Asian-American program, Zapata the
Chicano program, Soto the Native
American program, and Roble the

black program.
The percentage of minority
students admitted to such housing
varies with the house. The Housing
Office is reserving up to 40 percent of
the spaces in Roble for black students.

trailers, and from theme houses to
fraternities. All residences except
fraternities are filled in the draw.
Confronted by a confusing mass of

information, many students may
panic. Although choosing may be
difficult because there are so many
options, the drawing procedure is
relatively simple, says Assoc. Dean of
Student Affairs Larry Horton. Open
houses are currently being held to help
students decide.
Next Monday, residence offices will

receive draw cards for Round I from
the housing office. All students now
living in University housing will receive
cards.
Each card leaves room for nine
choices — to be listed in order of
preference. Students must bring their
completed cards to the Old Union on
or before April 20. There they draw
numbers out of a fishbowl. Officials at
the housing window will register the
number of his card. Students cannot
change their housing choices after
their numbers have been drawn.
Students may draw either
separately or in groups. Group
members must be of the same sex.
Each member will receive the same
draw number.
Trailer, Apartment Groups
Members should list group
preferences first. Each member may
list individual preferences afterwards.
Students who choose to live in
Manzanita Trailer Park must draw in
groups of four and must list Manzanita

as their first choice. Students who try
to draw into the apartments in
Mirrielees House must draw in groups
of two or four, and must list Mirrielees
as their first choice.
Draw numbers range from one to
5000. The lower a draw number, the
better a student's chance to get into
his first few choices.
Draw number priority is only one
of several criteria used to decide who
will be assigned campus housing. All
students now in housing system except
residents of Toyon and Columbae
qualify for present residence priorities
if they list their present house as a
choice on their draw card.
If a student with present residence
priority draws a number qualifying
him for residence anywhere on
campus, he is guaranteed reassignment
to his present residence or to a
residence listed as a higher choice.
In the past, students have
complained that this priority
discriminates against freshmen living in
all-freshman houses. Horton
emphasizes that present residence
priorities are fair.
"No student who would otherwise
by draw number be excluded from the
system can get in because of a
priority," he insists. "He has an
advantage only in that, if he qualifies,
he can go into a specific residence."
Minority Priorities
Minority students automatically
qualify for minority priorities in
certain houses. All they have to do is
list the appropriate minority program
house on their draw cards.
Junipero will house the
Asian-American program, Zapata the
Chicano program, Soto the Native
American program, and Roble the

black program.
The percentage of minority
students admitted to such housing
varies with the house. The Housing
Office is reserving up to 40 percent of
the spaces in Roble for black students.
Black residents receive first priority;
black students with good draw
numbers rank second on the priority
list, followed by other students with
present residence priorities.
Roble Spaces Reserved
Up to 50 percent of the spaces in
the other minority programs will be
reserved for minority students. The
same ranking system used by Roble
applies to the other houses.
Methods for determining priorities
in Toyon and the independent houses
differ from the dorms. Most houses

request that students look around
before signing priority lists, and a few
of the houses expect prospective
members to meet objective criteria
before they can go on priority lists.
Residents in two houses this year
will not have present residence
priorities for their houses next year.
The Housing Office is planning to
move into Stillman House — the Grove
House next to Lathrop House, turn it
over to Columbae, and make Lasuen
House into the second Grove House.
Explains Horton, "With Columbae
moving in, either Stillman or Lasuen
residents would be displaced." The
Housing Office decided to give
Stillman residents present residence
priority in Lasuen.
Special Arrangements
Lasuen residents, says Horton, will
receive "desirable housing." They will
be given present residence priority just
about anywhere in the system. To
ensure that these students will not
displace other students with equal
priority, representatives from the
Housing Office will negotiate with
each Lasuen student to decide where
he will fit in.
The Housing Office also plans to
make Lathrop House coed. "After
careful statistical analysis of the
demand for women's housing," says
Horton, "we decided that more girls
get single-sex housing than want it."
Lathrop ranked lowest on the
popularity list for women's housing.
Since coed houses on the Row like
Durand and Grove are among the most
popular houses on campus, Horton
predicts that students will respond
favorably to a coed Lathrop.
Lathrop girls will qualify for
present residence priorities in any
single-sex housing they want.
Round II
After Round I of the draw, some
students will still be unassigned.
Others may be dissatisfied with their
assignments.
Around May 7, residence offices
will receive Round I results.
Disgruntled students may then file
response cards for Round 11. They
keep their Round I numbers.
Students assigned in Round II will
fill spaces vacated by first-rdund
rejections. The Housing Office expects
them to accept their Round II
assignments.
If a student is still unassigned at the
end of Round 11, he can sign a waiting
list for university housing after May
24. The housing system has room for
about 70 percent of all
undergraduates, says Horton.
Between April 16 and 20, students
who want on-campus housing next
year will try their luck in the housing
draw. Choices range from dorms to
trailers, and from theme houses to
fraternities. All residences except
fraternities are filled in the draw.
