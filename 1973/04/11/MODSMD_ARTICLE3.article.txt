# Students To Try Luck In Housing Draw
## 
### KITTY PATTERSON 
Between April 16 and 20, students
who want on-campus housing next
year will try their luck in the housing
draw. Choices range from dorms to
trailers, and from theme houses to
fraternities. All residences except
fraternities are filled in the draw.
Confronted by a confusing mass of

information, many students may
panic. Although choosing may be
difficult because there are so many
options, the drawing procedure is
relatively simple, says Assoc. Dean of
Student Affairs Larry Horton. Open
houses are currently being held to help
students decide.
Next Monday, residence offices will

receive draw cards for Round I from
the housing office. All students now
living in University housing will receive
cards.
Each card leaves room for nine
choices — to be listed in order of
preference. Students must bring their
completed cards to the Old Union on
or before April 20. There they draw
numbers out of a fishbowl. Officials at
the housing window will register the
number of his card. Students cannot
change their housing choices after
their numbers have been drawn.
Students may draw either
separately or in groups. Group
members must be of the same sex.
Each member will receive the same
draw number.
Trailer, Apartment Groups
Members should list group
preferences first. Each member may
list individual preferences afterwards.
Students who choose to live in
Manzanita Trailer Park must draw in
groups of four and must list Manzanita

as their first choice. Students who try
to draw into the apartments in
Mirrielees House must draw in groups
of two or four, and must list Mirrielees
as their first choice.
Draw numbers range from one to
5000. The lower a draw number, the
better a student's chance to get into
his first few choices.
Draw number priority is only one
of several criteria used to decide who
will be assigned campus housing. All
students now in housing system except
residents of Toyon and Columbae
qualify for present residence priorities
if they list their present house as a
choice on their draw card.
If a student with present residence
priority draws a number qualifying
him for residence anywhere on
campus, he is guaranteed reassignment
to his present residence or to a
residence listed as a higher choice.
In the past, students have
complained that this priority
