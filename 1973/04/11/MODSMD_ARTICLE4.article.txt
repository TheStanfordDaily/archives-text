# Gans-Thompson Ask Voluntary ASSU
## 
### BILL WEINSTEIN 
(Third in a series of articles on the candidates for the
ASSU Council of Presidents in next week's election.)

"We do not intend to 'reform' the ASSU. How do you
reform a quagmire?" says the campaign platform of the
ASSU presidential slate of Judy Gans and Barton "Buzz"
Thompson.
The two, running on a platform of a completely
voluntary ASSU financed exclusively by voluntary fee
assessments, call the present ASSU "a political sandbox."

Thompson is a first year joint law-business graduate
student. As an undergraduate here, he headed
Stanford-In-Washington for two years, chaired the
Student-Alumni Associates, and at one time or another
held editorial positions with the Daily, the Arena, and the
"Stanford Independent."
Gans, a junior in economics, is a transfer student from
Pomona College. While she admitted a lack of experience
with the ASSU, she said that this was offset by the need
for "fresh faces."
ASSU Spending Criticized
Focusing their attack on ASSU effectiveness and the
budget, Thompson said, "I don't see anything that the
ASSU has done this year that has justified spending
$92,000 of the students money."
"The ASSU budget reminds me of the Department of
Defense budget,"he said. "The ASSU spends $5,000 for
telephone bills, $8,000 to pay the Council of Presidents,
and $3,000 to the Senate. What has the ASSU done this
year?"
Gans said her ticket would abolish all organizations
that are not "self-supporting." Questioned as to what
organizations would remain, Thompson replied, "the only

thing that is worthwhile to the sectors of the students are
things like the Sunday Night Flicks." He suggested that
only those groups that were financially in the black
showed enough student interest to remain.
However, Gans noted "the fear that different
organizations will disappear if there is no coercive fee
assessment in existence is a pretty clear indication to me
that they should not exist because there is no student
interest."
Volunteer Groups Stressed
Thompson claimed that the groups outside the ASSU
structure were the groups that accomplished the most.
For this reason, he stressed that volunteer organizations
fill the gap that the elimination of the ASSU would
accomplish.
"We want individual students to take the initiative; our
whole position is specific individuals interested in specific
points," Gans said. The students would decide how the
funds would be allotted and the activities during the year
through student campus votes, she noted.
Lashing out at the other candidates, Gans said, "We
refuse to campaign for student services because to do so
would be to promise the undeliverable."
No False Claims
Thompson added, "I think we're the only slate that is
not falsely claiming that we're representing the student's
slate with their money. Both of the other two slates [the
O'Grady and Van Petten slates] are putting forward their
purposes with the money of the students."
The duo's campaign literature has called the ASSU
"playground for budding politicians." "If we could
abolish the ASSU structure tomorrow, we would," they
say.
As Gans put it, "We want to emphasize voluntary fee
assessments. We also want to dismantle some of the
bureacracy of student government."

structure were the groups that accomplished the most.
For this reason, he stressed that volunteer organizations
fill the gap that the elimination of the ASSU would
accomplish.
"We want individual students to take the initiative; our
whole position is specific individuals interested in specific
points," Gans said. The students would decide how the
funds would be allotted and the activities during the year
through student campus votes, she noted.
Lashing out at the other candidates, Gans said, "We
refuse to campaign for student services because to do so
would be to promise the undeliverable."
No False Claims
Thompson added, "I think we're the only slate that is
not falsely claiming that we're representing the student's
slate with their money. Both of the other two slates [the
O'Grady and Van Petten slates] are putting forward their
purposes with the money of the students."
The duo's campaign literature has called the ASSU
"playground for budding politicians." "If we could
abolish the ASSU structure tomorrow, we would," they
say.
As Gans put it, "We want to emphasize voluntary fee
assessments. We also want to dismantle some of the
bureacracy of student government."

. . . ASSU "a political sandbox"
(Third in a series of articles on the candidates for the
ASSU Council of Presidents in next week's election.)

"We do not intend to 'reform' the ASSU. How do you
reform a quagmire?" says the campaign platform of the
ASSU presidential slate of Judy Gans and Barton "Buzz"
Thompson.
The two, running on a platform of a completely
voluntary ASSU financed exclusively by voluntary fee
assessments, call the present ASSU "a political sandbox."

Presidential Slate«

Thompson is a first year joint law-business graduate
student. As an undergraduate here, he headed
Stanford-In-Washington for two years, chaired the
Student-Alumni Associates, and at one time or another
held editorial positions with the Daily, the Arena, and the
"Stanford Independent."
Gans, a junior in economics, is a transfer student from
Pomona College. While she admitted a lack of experience
with the ASSU, she said that this was offset by the need
for "fresh faces."
ASSU Spending Criticized
Focusing their attack on ASSU effectiveness and the
budget, Thompson said, "I don't see anything that the
ASSU has done this year that has justified spending
$92,000 of the students money."
"The ASSU budget reminds me of the Department of
Defense budget,"he said. "The ASSU spends $5,000 for
telephone bills, $8,000 to pay the Council of Presidents,
and $3,000 to the Senate. What has the ASSU done this
year?"
Gans said her ticket would abolish all organizations
that are not "self-supporting." Questioned as to what
organizations would remain, Thompson replied, "the only

thing that is worthwhile to the sectors of the students are
things like the Sunday Night Flicks." He suggested that
only those groups that were financially in the black
showed enough student interest to remain.
However, Gans noted "the fear that different
organizations will disappear if there is no coercive fee
assessment in existence is a pretty clear indication to me
that they should not exist because there is no student
interest."
Volunteer Groups Stressed
Thompson claimed that the groups outside the ASSU
structure were the groups that accomplished the most.
