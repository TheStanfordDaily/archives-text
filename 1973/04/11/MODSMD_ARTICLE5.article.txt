# Labor Election Delayed By Inter-Union Squabble
## 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
"It's a lot harder for three parties
to agree on something than it is for
two."
That comment by Emu Sij-pa,
director of personnel-employee
relations, helps to explain 4V > -ness
that may delay the upcoming labor
representation elections by up to
several months.
Two groups, the Stanf rri Joint
Council and the United Stanford
Employees (USE), are seeking to
represent some 1600 University
staffers in a variety of jobs.
However, before an election can be
held to determine which, if either,
union will be the official
representative for the employees, the
two unions and the University must
agree on exactly which employees will
be included in the bargaining unit.
Seeking to resolve the dispute,
Larry Hanson, an agent of the
National Labor Relations Board
(NLRB), came to the campus last
Friday. But no agreement was reached,
and if informal meetings cannot
resolve the dispute, the NLRB will
hold hearings on the subject beginning
April 24.
These hearings could drag on for
weeks and make it impossible for an
election to be held before the end of
the quarter, despite the urging of all
parties for a quick election.
Although there are several job
classifications under dispute, the crux
of the matter is whether the Joint
Council will permit any classifications
to be deleted.
The Stanford Joint Council, made
up of the American Federation of
State, County, and Municipal
Employees (AFSCME) and Local 3 of
the International Union Operating
Engineers, became an official party to
the election when it presented
petitions from over 10 percent of the
labor group to the NLRB examiner
Friday.

Thus, the Joint Council, an
AFL-CIO affiliated group, must reach
an agreement with the other two
parties in order that the election be
held.
Unit Should Stay Same
AFSCME International Organizer
Don Mowery capsulized the group's
view succinctly: "The unit should be
the one described by the NLRB. We
want a quick election, but not at the
cost of 'no representation' for these
people" the University wants deleted.
"It doesn't surprise us that the
University would try something like
this. But we were shocked that
another union would be willing to go
along with any deletions," Mowery
continued.
The other union referred to is, of
course, the USE. The USE is willing to
go along with some of the deletions

proposed by the University, and, if the
Joint Council were not a party to the
election, could probably reach an
agreement with the University in very
little time.
USE's Position
The USE position seems to be that
the Stanford Joint Council is delaying
the election because it doesn't know
what it is doing. The group's
newsletter, Employees Organize,
which appeared Monday, made this
clear in their lead story headlined
"Joint Council Blocks Election."
"They [the Joint Council] said
they were unknowledgeable about
who could and who could not vote in
the union election .. . Their ignorance
of Stanford and the NLRB were
confirmed by their attempts to include
housekeeping workers and electronic
engineers in the unit."
