# Senate OKs Ballot, By-Law Changes
## 
### SUE KING 
The ASSU Senate last night
approved the proposed ballot for the
April 18-19 presidential election,
elected three members to the
Nominations Committee, and
approved changes in the ASSU By-laws
pertaining to elections.
The ballot will include presidential
primary candidates, senior class
presidential candidates, Student
Conduct Legislative Council
candidates, six ASSU Constitutional
amendments and five fee referenda.
Among the six proposed
constitutional amendments are three
sponsored by ASSU President Scott
Burke. They are amendments to
strengthen the veto power of the

President, to make a 20 percent voter
turnout necessary before any fee
assessment election results become
valid, and to create a three-member
commission invested with the final
authority in interpreting the constition
and by-laws.
Another amendment, if passed,
would make all future fee assessments
voluntary rather than refundable, as
they are now.
The five fee assessments will be for
the ASSU Program Fee, the Stanford
Legal Counseling Office, the Stanford
Daily, KZSU and the Band.
According to ASSU Elections
Commissioner Mike Nilsson, petitions
to run for the Student Conduct
Legislative Council are not due until
the end of the week. He said that
students interested in running for the
Council should contact him at the
ASSU office.
Lise Phieffer, Mike Nilsson and
Glenn Garvin were elected to the
Nominations Committee. Nilsson and
Garvin are returning members to the
committee, while Pheiffer received a
tie-breaking vote from Senate
Chairman Rocky Barber.
According to Nilsson, many of the
changes in the by-laws pertaining to
elections were designed to save money.
One of the amendments allows the
elections commission, with the
approval of the Senate, to close certain
polling places during a special election
when only certain groups in the
student body would be voting.
Another amendment says that if a
special election is granted to a specific
interest group that group may be
requested to provide labor for the
election.
A new clause, saying that violations
of any of the election rules may
constitute disqualification, was added
to the by-laws. Nilsson emphasized
that all of the changes in the by-laws
will be in effect for the upcoming
election.
