# Report From Washington
## Capital Punishment 
### 
: Paul N. McCloskey

President Nixon's call for
restoration of the death penalty
has placed a major issue before
the Congress.
The President's position has
wide public support at the present
time. California voters last
November indicated 68 percent
approval of the death penalty, and
attitudes elsewhere in the country
are perhaps more favorable.
Increasing violence in the
cities, prison riots and hijackings
have contributed to increased
public concern.
The Supreme Courts of both
the United States and California,
however, have severely limited the
use of the death penalty on
constitutional grounds, and the
debate now moves to Congress
and the various state legislatures.
Hasty Action
In my judgment, this issue
should be carefully examined
before hasty legislative action is
taken in response to the current
majority of public opinion. The
majority has been wrong before,
particularly where normal human
feelings of fear and vengeance run
high. The deportation of the
Japanese in 1942 furnishes one
such example where sober
reflection led to a reversal of
near-unanimous public opinion.
I will vote against restoration
of the death penalty and would
like to list some of the reasons
why in order to further discussion
and consideration of the issue at
home.
Chief among the arguments
against the death penalty, from
my standpoint, is that it involves
the government in the ritual of
execution, an act of violence
whether it be by hanging, gas
chamber or electrocution.
WE have abandoned use of the
firing squad and guillotine,
presumably for reasons of dismay
at the bloody method of
execution involved. Yet those
who have observed the operation
of the San Quentin gas chamber
or the electrocution chair at Sing
Sing have expressed an equal

distaste for these procedures as
well.
Violence in all its forms is
abhorrent; when the government
itself sets an example of violence,
does it perhaps give a small hint of
legitimacy to the consideration of
violence by the political zealot,
the subject of social
discrimination or even the
unemployed?
Fascination
We have to confess to a
regrettable but deep human
fascination with violence. Any
highway accident involviing blood
and gore will draw the
half-horrified, half-curious
attention of passers-by.
Television, movies and books
about violence cater to our tastes,
our desires, not just those of their
authors.
Retribution and vengeance
come naturally to human beings,
and yet, upon reflection, we
generally regret the sudden
reaction of meeting the sharp
word or hostile act with force.
It is a natural human trait to
respond to force with greater
force. As Justice Holmes once
observed, something to the effect:
"Sober reflection is not required
in the presence of the uplifted
knife." Does the routine use of
execution by the government
cause more or less violence on the
part of those at the fringe of
society.
Proof Needed
I don't know the answer to this
question, but until there is clear
proof that the death penalty will
reduce crime and violence, I am
not inclined to restore the right
of the U.S. Government to
deliberately engage in execution.
I have not yet seen any
convincing evidence that the
death penalty has inhibited a
particular type of crime such as
murder, kidnapping or hijacking.
The public cry and resulting
legislation for stricter penalties on
drug use 10 years ago has led to
no demonstrable reduction in
such use. To the contrary, drug

abuse has increased despite
stricter penalties.
I am," likewise, not convinced
by the argument that
the punishment must be harsh
enough to match the crime. Death
does not necessarily seem a
harsher penalty than deprivation
of freedom.
Here, I am perhaps biased by a
belief in Patrick Henry's cry:
"Give me liberty or give me
death" and the New Hampshire
State Motto: "Live free or die."
Loss of liberty seems to me a
greater penalty than death.
These are personal views. I
would welcome opposing views in
letters to your Congressman.
