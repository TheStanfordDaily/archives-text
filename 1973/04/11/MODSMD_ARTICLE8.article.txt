# American Indians
## Meet The SAIO 
### 
Steve Kane

SAIO? What does that mean?
Good question. SAIO means: The Stanford American Indian
Organization. Yet often the question still arises. "Oh, is that a
campus organization?"
Since Indian students at Stanford spoke out and removed the
derogatory Stanford Indian symbol, we as an organization have not
been obvious; but things are changing. Whether you agreed or
disagreed with the removal of the symbol, it cannot be argued that
this was but one of many actions by Indian people across the
country in a new era of Indian consciousness. In the past, Indian
people have not been known to protest or violently defend their
rights even if directly affected. But that this is changing is most
recently apparent at Wounded Knee, South Dakota.

The American Indian students at Stanford feel that as an Indian
organization we also must speak out wheneever necessary-not only
here at Stanford, but whenever Indian people across the country
speak out. AlthoughSAlOoften may not fully agree with actions by
Indians across the country, we feel that if we can clarify the issues, a
better understanding of the real issues facing Indian people can be
achieved.
Most of the time, people look at Indian actions such as Wounded
Knee not in regard to the question of why these actions are
happening, but instead cling to some personal opinion that is often
unrelated to the question of why Indian people are protesting.
So, in future columns, we hope to express to the Stanford
community the opinions of Indian people. We also hope to share
with you parts of our culture that we hope can benefit you, such as
Indian ideology and Indian lifestyle.
Our main goal is to better inform you of the activities of
American Indian people. One way to communicate our thoughts to
you is through this column, but a better way is face to face;
therefore, if you have any questions concerning Indian people, talk
to us about it. We have an office, number six in the Old Firehouse,
ext. 4078, and our office hours are from 1-3 p.m.
