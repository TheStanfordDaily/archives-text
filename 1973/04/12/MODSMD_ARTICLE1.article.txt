# Offices To Include Natural Setting
## 'Page Mill Hill' Project Planned 
### ROBERT BACON 
Remodeling of a vacant Stanford
Industrial Park building will begin
soon as the first step in a $4.5 million
office development in a parklike
setting.
Primaura Properties, the real estate
development arm of
Wheatley-Jacobsen, a Palo Alto
construction firm, teamed with the
Coldwell-Banker Fund, an investment
partnership of financial institutions, to
promote "Page Mill Hill" at the corner
of Page Mill Road and Foothill
Expressway.
Boyd Smith of Primaura, former
Manager of Land Resources at

Stanford, said that the project would
feature "Stanford-type architecture,"
including red tile roofs, and extensive
landscaping dominated by water.
This is the first development
venture for Primaura, which Smith
joined last year upon leaving Stanford.
Former ITT Office
The first step in the project is a
$500,000 remodeling of the building
presently on the site, an office
building previously owned by
International Telephone and Telegraph
Company (ITT). The ITT building has
been vacant for four years.
The land belongs to the University.
The developers purchased the existing

building and the lease on the land
from ITT. Their plans received final
University approval last month.
Page Mill Hill will be devoted
largely to offices and high-level
scientific research. The entire project
will contain about 150,000 square feet
of floor space. Of this, some 37,000
square feet are in the existing ITT
building.
The construction schedule for the
new buildings planned, Smith said, will
depend on how rapidly space in the
present building is rented.
Garden Atmosphere
"We're not gambling very much"
with this development, Smith stressed.

"In this area, people want a
garden-type atmosphere."
About 42 percent of the 11-acre
site will be devoted to landscaping,
including a group of ponds and
streams. Smith said this is
approximately twice the amount of
open space found in other office
developments in the industrial park.
The new project site is located
across Page Mill Road from the
Frenchman's Hill faculty housing area,
and across the Foothill Expressway
from open foothill land in the
University's academic reserve.
Built-in Amenities
"Among the most attractive
features of the site are those built-in
amenities," Smith noted. "We
deliberately set out to create a project
in harmony with the surrounding open
hills."
James E. Nelson, University
Manager of Facilities and Properties,
who supervises the University Land
Resources and Planning offices which
reviewed the development plans,
praised the Page Mill Hill proposal for
its "interesting buildings" and the way
in which it takes advantage of the
sloping site.
Smith and Nelson both stressed
that Page Mill Hill will not be in
competition with the controversial
high-rise Dillingham-Palo Alto Square
development at El Camino Real and
Page Mill Road.
Dillingham
"I don't apologize for Dillingham,"
said Smith, who was involved in
planning that project while employed
by the University. "Some tenants will
prefer Dillingham. Some like the
big-city feeling."
Smith said that rental fees at Page
Mill Hill will be lower than those at
the Dillingham project, but repeated
his belief that the two projects were
not c mpeting.
Describing his philosophy of
development, Smith said, "If it's
economically possible, we want to
build something pleasing.... The
world needs quality development, and
that's what we try to do. There's been
a lot of bad development; I don't want
to be a part of that."

scientific research. The entire project
will contain about 150,000 square feet
of floor space. Of this, some 37,000
square feet are in the existing ITT
building.
The construction schedule for the
new buildings planned, Smith said, will
depend on how rapidly space in the
present building is rented.
Garden Atmosphere
"We're not gambling very much"
with this development, Smith stressed.

"In this area, people want a
garden-type atmosphere."
About 42 percent of the 11-acre
site will be devoted to landscaping,
including a group of ponds and
streams. Smith said this is
approximately twice the amount of
open space found in other office
developments in the industrial park.
The new project site is located
across Page Mill Road from the
Frenchman's Hill faculty housing area,
and across the Foothill Expressway
from open foothill land in the
University's academic reserve.
Built-in Amenities
"Among the most attractive
features of the site are those built-in
amenities," Smith noted. "We
deliberately set out to create a project
in harmony with the surrounding open
hills."
James E. Nelson, University
Manager of Facilities and Properties,
who supervises the University Land
Resources and Planning offices which
reviewed the development plans,
praised the Page Mill Hill proposal for
its "interesting buildings" and the way
in which it takes advantage of the
sloping site.
Smith and Nelson both stressed
that Page Mill Hill will not be in
competition with the controversial
high-rise Dillingham-Palo Alto Square
development at El Camino Real and
Page Mill Road.
Dillingham
"I don't apologize for Dillingham,"
said Smith, who was involved in
planning that project while employed
by the University. "Some tenants will
prefer Dillingham. Some like the
big-city feeling."
Smith said that rental fees at Page
Mill Hill will be lower than those at
the Dillingham project, but repeated
his belief that the two projects were
not c mpeting.
Describing his philosophy of
development, Smith said, "If it's
economically possible, we want to
build something pleasing.... The
world needs quality development, and
that's what we try to do. There's been
a lot of bad development; I don't want
to be a part of that."

PAGE MILL HILL — Architects have prepared this sketch of the proposed Page Mill Hill office development in the
Stanford Industrial Park. In this view, looking southeast from Page Mill Road, the existing ITT building, shown as it will
appear after extensive remodeling, is at left.
Remodeling of a vacant Stanford
Industrial Park building will begin
soon as the first step in a $4.5 million
office development in a parklike
setting.
Primaura Properties, the real estate
development arm of
Wheatley-Jacobsen, a Palo Alto
construction firm, teamed with the
Coldwell-Banker Fund, an investment
partnership of financial institutions, to
promote "Page Mill Hill" at the corner
of Page Mill Road and Foothill
Expressway.
Boyd Smith of Primaura, former
Manager of Land Resources at

Stanford, said that the project would
feature "Stanford-type architecture,"
including red tile roofs, and extensive
landscaping dominated by water.
This is the first development
venture for Primaura, which Smith
joined last year upon leaving Stanford.
Former ITT Office
The first step in the project is a
$500,000 remodeling of the building
presently on the site, an office
building previously owned by
International Telephone and Telegraph
Company (ITT). The ITT building has
been vacant for four years.
The land belongs to the University.
The developers purchased the existing

building and the lease on the land
from ITT. Their plans received final
University approval last month.
Page Mill Hill will be devoted
largely to offices and high-level
scientific research. The entire project
will contain about 150,000 square feet
of floor space. Of this, some 37,000
square feet are in the existing ITT
building.
