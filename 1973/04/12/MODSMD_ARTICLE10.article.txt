# Ah, But Tours!
## Move French Campus To Paris 
### 
J. Lloyd Snook 111

The recommendations of the
Merryman commission that
Stanford's Overseas Campuses be
relocated in major cities has
touched off a teapot tempest over
the proper location of the German
campus, a debate that has
included, among other burning
issues, whether the "German
character," whatever that may be,
is fundamentally urban or rural.
But it has apparently been
forgotten that there is another
campus with much the same
problem — the French campus.
Why must 150 students a year
go to France to live for 6 months
in Tours? What does Tours have
to offer the Stanford student?
Very little. Almost nothing
that couldn't be found in Paris,
easier and better. Regardless of
what one thinks of the
Commission's urban proposal in
general, when the choice is
between Paris and Tours, the
decision is clear — move to Paris.
Paree? Oui!
"Paris, c'est la France; la
France, c'est Paris." That
aphorism is becoming more true
every year — today, one of every
five Frenchmen lives in or around
Paris, and the figure will be one in
four by the end of the decade.
The "Gallic character," whatever
that may be, is not only urban: it
is explicitly and joyously Parisian.
The French government has
recognized this, and has tried to
decentralize its administration,
industry, the arts, and the media,
but its efforts have largely failed
— Charles De Gaulle's efforts to
decentralize the government cost
him a job four years ago.
Consider the advantages of
Paris — magnificent museums,
three excellent symphony
orchestras, a great opera
company, theater that puts every
city but London to shame, the
world's finest restaurants and
wine cellars. Many consider it the
most beautiful city in the world.
Ah, but Tours! Tours, for
those who aren't sure, is a
provincial capital of 130,000 on
the River Loire. The Kings of
France built their summer homes
there, because it was fairly close
to Paris. Most Stanford-in-France
students look on the town much
as did Francis I — "two hours by
train to Paris" is just close enough
to stave off despair.
History
Tours is a city rich in history.
Charles Martel beat the Moors
there, making the world safe for
Christianity. Henry II passed
through one night, leaving a
chateau or two — or was it Henry
IV? Balzac and Anatole France
were born there; both left for
Paris as soon as they could raise
the fare. The Communist Party
got off to a bad start by
organizing in Tour in 1920.
Some thought this
distinguished history was crowned
in 1940 when the National
Assembly stopped in Tours for a
vin blanc in their flight from the
Germans. Their hopes were
unfounded: Tours made headlines
again in 1971 when Mayor Royer
unearthed a centuries-old law and
seized some paintings from an
exhibition that he considered
dangerous to the public morals. In
compliance with the law, he piled
the paintings in the town square
one Saturday and burned them.
Tours is in many ways much
like Baltimore — it is between the
North and the South, with none
of the advantages of either. It is a
very dull place; "culture" in Tours
means the worst symphony
orchestra this side of Daly City.
Friendly Town
But, we are told, Tours is
small; its provinciality is an asset,
and people are much friendlier
than in Paris.

Well, it is hardly small. A
population of 130,000 is just large
enough to make it urban, but is
far too little to support much
"culture." True, some of the
people were friendly, at least until
a couple of Stanford-in-France
groups made a name for
themselves in the Continental
hashish trade.
Tours has one real asset: the
language. Tourangeaux speak the
purest French in the world. The
inflection of the Parisian, on the
other hand, is reminiscent of the
Upper Bronx. Unfortunately,
some of the French language
teachers commute from their
homes in Paris. They do not shed
their accets on arrival in Tours. If
one is taught good French, one
can comprehend bad. Students a
a Paris campus could easily learr

French from Tourangeaux, and
have the best of both worlds.
The only mitigating factor, and
it is a great one, is the excellence
of the staff at the Tours campus.
Paul LeMoal is one of a rare breed
— a competent and kind
administrator as well as an
excellent teacher. Rene Borius,
many contend, surpasses the
entire Academie Francaise in
erudition and elegance of
language. To lose these men
would be a tragedy.
Alors, quoi faired The French
campus should be in the Paris
area, either in the city or in the
suburbs. The practical difficulties
of moving to Paris appear to be
inseparable in the present context,
and the loss of the present staff
would be a great blow.
But students will not put up

with Tours forever. Enrollment in
all the Overseas Campuses
continues to decline, and none of
them will likely escape major
overhaul in the near future. Part
of that overhaul should be moving
the French campus to Paris. But
the administration has not made
any commitment to implementing
the recommendations of the
Merryman Commission. Without a
commitment, the program will die
a peaceful, if lingering, death.
That would be a shame. But it
would allow the University the
option of beginning anew
overseas. Maybe the second time
around the administration will see
the light, and open a center in
Paris.
