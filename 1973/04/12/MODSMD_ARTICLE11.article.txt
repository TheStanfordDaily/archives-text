# Infernal Revenue
## Rape Of The Taxpayer 
### 
Bill Evers

An early recognition of
taxation as robbery can be found
in the mode of analysis employed
by American social theorist and
politican John C. Calhoun
(1782-1850).
In his Disquisition on
Government, Calhoun wrote:
"Some one portion of the
community must pay in taxes
more than it receives back in
disbursements, while another
receives in disbursements more
than it pays in taxes."
Calhoun then notes that as a
result of the very nature of the
fiscal process, the total process of
taxing and spending will yield
bounties to some and burdens to
others.
Class Conflict
Calhoun's great contribution
was to recognize that the fiscal
action of the government dividied
the community into two great
antagonistic classes: "one
consisting of those who, in reality,
pay the taxes and, of course, bear
exclusively the burden of
supporting the government; and
the other, of those who are the
recipients of their proceeds
through disbursements, and who
are, in fact supported by the
government; or, in fewer words,
... tax-payers and tax-consumers.
Taking away the veil to reveal
taxation as robbery has significant
consequences. It means that all
talk of fairness or equity in
taxation must be regarded as sheer
hockum.
To take a simple example, all
citizens cannot be taxed equally
because the government
bureaucrats are, of necessity, net
tax-consumers.
Loopholes
Similarly, the analysis of
taxation as robbery gives us an
insight into the nature of "tax
loopholes." Tax loopholes are
simplv income that the
tax-collectors have not yet taxed.
To close all loopholes totally
would mean that the government
taxed away all the citizen's
rightful earnings and would place
all consumption decisions in the
society in the hands of the

government bureaucrats.
Now I'm as interested as the
next man in who has tax
loopholes because this
information may help me find out
who the net tax-consumers are —
the beneficiaries in this whole
extractive process. But the
solution to tax loophones is more
and more tax loopholes. Every
man should have a big tax
loophole in which to breathe and
live.
In fact, I'm prepared to
advocate the biggest tax loophole
that anyone has suggested in a
long time. I think the personal
exeption level for the income tax
should be raised to $12,000. This
would be genuine tax relief, which
is exactly what the beleaguered
middle class and working poor
need.
Rape!
Increasingly, public
commentators are recognizing
that the taxation process is
governed not by clean, pure
economic or ethical theories, but
by political power. Philip Stern's
two books, The Great Treasury
Raid and Thte Rape of the
Taxpayer have brought this
message to the general public,
while studies like that by Joseph
A. Pechman in the fall 1969 issue
of The Public Interest have
reached the technical experts.
Whatever the imperfections of
these studies, they do focus on
the vital question of who is doing
something to whom in the process
of taxation.
A recent political science text
by Ira Sharkansky entitled The
Politics of Taxing and Spending is
described by Prof. Thomas R. Dye
as lifting "the cover of economic
verbiage" and revealing "the
underlying political nature of
taxing and spending decisions."
As Dye is pleased to note, in
Sharkansky's book, "economic
beliefs or mores about growth,
stability, and equity are betrayed
as political issues. Disputes over
'incidence,' 'fiscal capacity,' 'tax
effort,' 'burden,' 'balanced
budgets,' 'progressivity and

regressivity' are analyzed in terms
of underlying conflicts of
interest."
An additional blow to the
mystique surrounding the
government bureaucrats' claim
upon the citizens' earnings is
delivered by economist Murray N.
Rothbard in his recent book Power
and Market.
Tyranny
Rothbard discusses at length
the classic canons of justice in
taxation. He notes that
economists' claims about fair or
just taxes always leave out proof
that taxation itself can be just. He
draws attention to the fact that
the ethical theories that tax
economists invoke are hazy,
vague, and inconsistent. Yet these
theories are usually invoked on
the grounds that they are valid
and that everyone in the society
shares these economists' values.
Rothbard shows that the standard
principles of taxation like "ability
to pay" are full of logical fallacies.
Recognition of the political
nature of taxation and
consciousness of the thievery
involved contribute to the ability
and willingness of citizens to resist
governmental tyranny. Let's hope
such awareness increases.

Tyranny
Rothbard discusses at length
the classic canons of justice in
taxation. He notes that
economists' claims about fair or
just taxes always leave out proof
that taxation itself can be just. He
draws attention to the fact that
the ethical theories that tax
economists invoke are hazy,
vague, and inconsistent. Yet these
theories are usually invoked on

Rothbard shows that the standard
principles of taxation like "ability

involved contribute to the ability

governmental tyranny. Let's hope
such awareness increases.

An early recognition of
taxation as robbery can be found
in the mode of analysis employed
by American social theorist and
politican John C. Calhoun
(1782-1850).
In his Disquisition on
Government, Calhoun wrote:
"Some one portion of the
community must pay in taxes
more than it receives back in
disbursements, while another
receives in disbursements more
than it pays in taxes."
Calhoun then notes that as a
result of the very nature of the
fiscal process, the total process of
taxing and spending will yield
bounties to some and burdens to
others.
Class Conflict
Calhoun's great contribution
was to recognize that the fiscal
action of the government dividied
the community into two great
antagonistic classes: "one
consisting of those who, in reality,
pay the taxes and, of course, bear
exclusively the burden of
supporting the government; and
the other, of those who are the
recipients of their proceeds
through disbursements, and who
are, in fact supported by the
government; or, in fewer words,
... tax-payers and tax-consumers.
Taking away the veil to reveal
taxation as robbery has significant
consequences. It means that all
talk of fairness or equity in
taxation must be regarded as sheer
hockum.
To take a simple example, all
citizens cannot be taxed equally
because the government
bureaucrats are, of necessity, net
tax-consumers.
Loopholes
Similarly, the analysis of
taxation as robbery gives us an
insight into the nature of "tax
loopholes." Tax loopholes are
simplv income that the
tax-collectors have not yet taxed.
To close all loopholes totally
would mean that the government
taxed away all the citizen's
rightful earnings and would place
all consumption decisions in the
society in the hands of the

government bureaucrats.
Now I'm as interested as the
next man in who has tax
loopholes because this
information may help me find out
who the net tax-consumers are —
the beneficiaries in this whole
extractive process. But the
solution to tax loophones is more
and more tax loopholes. Every
man should have a big tax
loophole in which to breathe and
live.
In fact, I'm prepared to
advocate the biggest tax loophole
that anyone has suggested in a
long time. I think the personal
exeption level for the income tax
should be raised to $12,000. This
would be genuine tax relief, which
is exactly what the beleaguered
middle class and working poor
need.
Rape!
Increasingly, public
commentators are recognizing
that the taxation process is
governed not by clean, pure
economic or ethical theories, but
by political power. Philip Stern's
two books, The Great Treasury
Raid and Thte Rape of the
Taxpayer have brought this
message to the general public,
while studies like that by Joseph
A. Pechman in the fall 1969 issue
of The Public Interest have
reached the technical experts.
Whatever the imperfections of
these studies, they do focus on
the vital question of who is doing
something to whom in the process
of taxation.
A recent political science text
by Ira Sharkansky entitled The
Politics of Taxing and Spending is
described by Prof. Thomas R. Dye
as lifting "the cover of economic
verbiage" and revealing "the
underlying political nature of
taxing and spending decisions."

and more tax loopholes. Every
man should have a big tax
loophole in which to breathe and
live.
In fact, I'm prepared to
advocate the biggest tax loophole
that anyone has suggested in a
long time. I think the personal
exeption level for the income tax
should be raised to $12,000. This
would be genuine tax relief, which
is exactly what the beleaguered
middle class and working poor
need.
Rape!
Increasingly, public
commentators are recognizing
that the taxation process is
governed not by clean, pure
economic or ethical theories, but
by political power. Philip Stern's
two books, The Great Treasury
Raid and Thte Rape of the
Taxpayer have brought this
message to the general public,
while studies like that by Joseph
A. Pechman in the fall 1969 issue
of The Public Interest have
reached the technical experts.
Whatever the imperfections of
these studies, they do focus on
the vital question of who is doing
something to whom in the process
of taxation.
A recent political science text
by Ira Sharkansky entitled The
Politics of Taxing and Spending is
described by Prof. Thomas R. Dye
as lifting "the cover of economic
verbiage" and revealing "the
underlying political nature of
taxing and spending decisions."
As Dye is pleased to note, in
Sharkansky's book, "economic
beliefs or mores about growth,
stability, and equity are betrayed
as political issues. Disputes over
'incidence,' 'fiscal capacity,' 'tax
effort,' 'burden,' 'balanced
budgets,' 'progressivity and

regressivity' are analyzed in terms
of underlying conflicts of
interest."
An additional blow to the
mystique surrounding the
government bureaucrats' claim
upon the citizens' earnings is
delivered by economist Murray N.
Rothbard in his recent book Power
and Market.
Tyranny
Rothbard discusses at length
the classic canons of justice in
taxation. He notes that
economists' claims about fair or
just taxes always leave out proof
that taxation itself can be just. He
draws attention to the fact that
the ethical theories that tax
economists invoke are hazy,
vague, and inconsistent. Yet these
theories are usually invoked on
the grounds that they are valid
and that everyone in the society
shares these economists' values.
Rothbard shows that the standard
principles of taxation like "ability
to pay" are full of logical fallacies.
Recognition of the political
nature of taxation and
consciousness of the thievery
involved contribute to the ability
and willingness of citizens to resist
governmental tyranny. Let's hope
such awareness increases.
