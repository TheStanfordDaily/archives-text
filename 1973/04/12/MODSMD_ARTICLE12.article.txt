Desperate Distortion
Editor:
It was my intention to play no
public role whatsoever in the
present election for ASSU Council
of Presidents. However, a member
of one slate, in a desperate
attempt to win votes, has stooped
to outright distortion and
intentional falsehoods regarding
my conduct as ASSU President.
Charles Ogletree, the third man
on the O'Grady-Garfield ticket, is
quoted in the Daily as asserting
that I have ignored minorities in
my committee appointments and
that I assume that minorities have
no interest in University
governance. Both charges are
completely untrue.
The fact of the matter is that I
have gone out of my way to
increase participation by minority
group members in University
committees. Ogletree knows this
perfectly well, for it was I who
recruited him to serve on the
University's Minority Affairs
Commission.
During my administration, the
number of minority students
nominated to serve on University
panels increased by 37 percent
over the previous year, and the
number of women appointees
rose by 38 percent.
The charge that I assume
minorities have no interest in
University committees is a blatant
falsehood to which I take the
strongest possible exception. My
record clearly refutes this charge,
and in fact demonstrates that the
reverse is true.
It was I who sponsored
membership on the ASSU
Publications Board for the Real
News, the Black Student Union b
newspaper. It was I who placed
the editor of the Real News on
the Speakers Bureau board of
directors. These panels are more
important than most, for they
have substantial funds under their
control.
Ogletree's unwarranted attack
upon me is highly ironic, for he
has himself failed to fulfill his
responsibilities on University
panels. He has attended only one
of eight meetings of the Speakers
Bureau, and his record as a
member on the Publications
Board is equally dismal.
I hope that Ogletree, his
partners, and other candidates in
this election will try to be more
responsible in their campaign
tactics. They should know that I
will continue to correct
inaccuracies and false charges by
them regarding my record.

Ultimate Frisbee
Editor:
Ultimate Frisbee is a
fast-moving, competitive sport. It
is generally played by two seven
man teams on a field 60 yards by
40 yards with unlimited end
zones. The object is to score goals
by passing the Frisbee to a
teammate beyond the goal line.
The game starts with a throwoff
(called a pull), and the receiving
team takes possession where they
catch the Frisbee. There is only
one method of advancing the
Frisbee downfield, by passing it.
If the Frisbee is dropped, knocked
down, or intercepted, the
defensive team takes possession.
Ultimate Frisbee teams have
been formed at Rutgers,
Princeton, Tufts, the University of
North Carolina-Chapel Hill, Clark,
Penn State, RPI, and one or two
other schools. Berkeley is in the
process of forming a team for the
next International Frisbee
Tournament.
I would like anyone interested
in possibly forming a Stanford
team to join the National
Ult'mate Frisbee League to see me
at 302 Madera House, Wilbur Hall.
