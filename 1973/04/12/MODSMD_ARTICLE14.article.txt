Are there any kind of practical arts classes offered, i.e. carpentry,
auto mechanics, etc. ? If not, how can I start one? J.S.
A beginning auto repair course taught by Martha Koester is being
offered by the Women's Center this quarter. Registration for the
course was Tuesday at the Women's Center in the old Firehouse.
A three-unit SCIRE course in auto mechanics is being offered at
Lasuen but the instructor, Mark Anderson, says that the class is
already filled. He does not plan to teach the course again next
autumn, but said that since his course had been approved, it is
possible that courses of a similar nature will be offered in the future.
Cubberley Adult School at 4000 Middlefield Road, Palo Alto,
offers courses in electronics assembly, welding, woodshop and
apprentice carpentry, all for a fairly small fee.
If you would like to start a course in any field, the places to go
would be the SCIRE office in the Old Union or the Undergraduate
Specials section of the Dean of Undergraduate Studies'office.
Graduate students are encouraged to use Undergraduate Specials,
while undergraduates may either apply to SCIRE or Undergraduate
Specials.
Traditional academic courses can be offered for credit, but subjects
like practical arts would most likely be given for zero units.
Anderson's course is offered for three units only because he said he
went through "an amazing hassle" to get the credit.

What are the strange squeaking noises I hear at night under the
archways in front of the Law School and the History department
(facing the Oval)? Someone told me that there were bats living there.
Is this true? E.J.
Yes indeed, there are bats living in the Quad. The "strange
squeaking noises" that you hear are probably the sweet little
mammalian insectivores cavorting 'mongst the eaves and beams.

Where can my used books be sold for cash? C.S.
Next week and the week after, books will be bought back by the!
Bookstore for 20-25 percent of the original price if the book appears
in the Book Buying Guide. (The Guide is available at the Bookstore's
Customer Service window, for all of you who would like to check and
see what books can be returned.)
At the end of this quarter, books that will be used again during
summer quarter can be sold back to the bookstore.
You might also try Bell's Wonderful Book Store at 536 Emerson,
or Chimaera Used Books and Records, at 405 Kipling.
Bell's will buy a used textbook "depending on the book,"
according to an employee. She said that Mr. Bell would have to look
at the book before determining whether the sore would buy it or not.
Although Chimaera trys to stay away from hardback textbooks,
they will buy novels and paperbacks that have been used as textbooks.
If they need the book badly, or if they thnk that the book will sell
quickly they will pay cash for it. Otherwise they will give trade credit
on books or used records.
