## Education Must Change To Alter Society 
### 
Since educational goals reflect
the society which they serve, and
since society has already pushed
beyond these goals, it follows that
education must change or be
plunged into a deepening crisis, a
Stanford educator believes.
Assoc. Prof. Henry M. Levin, a
specialist in urban economics and
public finance points out that the
problem has already been
recognized at the national level in
a controversial report "Work in
America," made for the U.S.
Department of Health, Education
and Welfare.
Levin's views are developed in
an article for the journal of the
Center for 'he Study of
Democratic Institutions at Santa
Barbara, renrintec" as an
"occasional paper" of the
Stanford School of education.
He says th* HEW study
sugg that if t nature of work
do*- ot change such a way as
t, rease the o -tHpaticri of
v.* -a? in decision mailing and to
reduce worker alienation, r .jor
disruptions of normal production
activities and reduced
productivity can be forecast."
His thesis emphasizes that
education reflects the society
which it serves, rather than acting
as a means of transforming society
as the idealists believe.
"It takes little imagination, he
continues, "to see the
correspondence between grades
for school performance and wages
for work performance; to see the
alienation and boredom of the
assembly line; to see the
competition among stuoents for
grades parallel to the competition
among workers for advancement;
and to see the teacher in the
classroom impose his arbitrary
values on his underlings just as
does the boss.

to emphasize cooperative social
and economic relationships, we
would expect the schools to
reflect cooperative goals as well."
Changes in education only
occur when "we forge changes in
the overall social, economic, and
political relationships" that
characterize the outside world,
Levin writes.
Contradictions between
educational preparation and the
world of work are already at
hand.
He lists three important
reasons:
"First, with the enormous
increase in the number of young
persons with college credentials, it
appears that traditional job
opportunities for college
graduates have not expanded as
rapidly as the number of
graduates.
"The result is that individuals
with college training are being
employed increasingly in jobs
which formerly required only high
school credentials.
Rising Dissatisfaction
"Second, the fact that rising
educational attainment leads to
increasing job expectations, and
that many of these expectations
cannot be met, has led to rising
dissatisfaction with work itself.
"Third, the constant tendency
for technological change to reduce
the functions of workers, as
specialization increases, means
that workers feel increasingly
reluctant in a production process
that demands only very limited
aspects of the human potential."
This increasing specialization is
true at virtually all levels, from
doctors and lawyers to plant
workers, he writes.
"For example, it is widely
viewed that the quality of
workmanship has been
deteriorating in recent years, and
that quality control is one of the
most serious problems faced by
industry.
Job Impairment Rises
"Moreover, industry and
government are plagued by rising
incidences of job impairment due
to alcoholism and drug usage;
employee absenteeism and
turnover appear to be rising; and
production is being increasingly
disrupted by wildcat strikes and
employee sabotage.
"The specter of increasing
sabotage is especially frightening
to employers, since relatively
simple acts can do vast amounts
of damage to sophisticated
machinery," the report said.
Employers in the U.S. and
abroad have already attempted to
meet this problem with various
forms of "industrial democracy,"
Levin reports, "all of which
[attempt] to reduce the
alienation and dissatisfaction of
workers and to increase
productivity by changing the
nature of the workers'
relationship to the firm and its
decision-making mechanisms."

"Corresponding changes in the
nature of schooling are likely to
emerge," he believes. "A much
greater emphasis would be
focused on cooperation in
learning, on mastery of particular
skills, on the ability to handle new
situations and learning
opportunities, and on the other
worker traits that assume
increased importance in the work
process," if industrial democracy
gains wider acceptance.
Other educators have already
suggested methods, he points out:

"mastery learning" for minimum
competency in the job market;
"open classroom" techniques for
inculcating student responsibility
for school and production
techniques; the "tutorial
community" in which students
help their peers in acquiring new
proficiencies; and more on the job
training programs.
Education has taken the wrong
approach to these problems in the
past, Levin asserts.
"Attempts to individualize
instruction ... obviously violated

the need for socializing group
values," he writes.
"There is every indication that
the attempt to equalize financial
support of the schools will also
fail in a society which regards as a
privilege the ability to provide a
greater educational background
for the children of the rich than
for the children of the poor."
"Schools can only serve as an
agent of change when their
activities and outcomes contradict
the larger social order," he
concludes.
