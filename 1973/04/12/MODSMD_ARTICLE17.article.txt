# Many Colleges Begin 'Tapping' Pubs As Source Of Funds

For generations of college students, a cold beer
meant a trip to the local "college" bar or spiriting a
bulky brown bag into the dorm. But times are
changing.
Spurred by widespread lowering of the legal
drinking age, and by the need to find more funding,
colleges across the country are opening places on
campus where students can drink. Almost without
exception, they simply are called "the pub."
Most of the campus bars serve only beer and
wine. Twenty-five cents for 12 ounches of beer is
standard, a price usually slightly lower than
off-campus establishments. College officials hold the
liquor licenses in most cases, but student
organizations own and operate a few.
Princeton University opened a pub last month.
It's located in an old library building next to the
new library.
"They come pouring out of there and over here
like lemmings at 11 o'clock," said Bernard Gavin,
the university official who runs the pub.
Female Bouncer
Like most campus pubs, the Princeton
establishment sells pizza and sandwiches. It has pool
tables, live music on weekends, and even a female
students' bouncer. On an average Saturday night,
students go through 15 kegs of beer.
"The university decided it would rather provide a
place here for the kids to drink instead of having
them drive someplace else," said Gavin.
Since 1971, when the voting age in federal
elections was lowered to 18, the legal age for
drinking alcoholic beverage has been lowered in 19

states. Another dozen states are expected to do so
by July.
A recent survey of 429 colleges, found that 102,
almost one-fourth, have a place on campus where
students can drink.
They range from a beer tap in the cafeteria at the
University of Northern lowa to a full bar stop the
new student union building on the University of
Wisconsin's Milwaukee campus. Forty-one percent
of the schools with bars did not have them four
years ago.
The survey was conducted by Robert Rainville,
director of the student union building at the
University of Rhode Island.
Most Making Money
Although some campus pubs run on a break-even
basis, most are making money. The survey indicated
the colleges expect to make an average profit of
$4500 a year on beer and wine sales. Many said they
will use the money to underwrite the cost of
campus food services.
Most of the colleges said there had been little
opposition from local residents or parents of
students. To no one's surprise, they reported that
89 percent of the students favored having a place to
drink on campus.
A smpling of bars near campuses indicated no
great loss of business because of the opening of
on-campus pubs. Bar operators said students
apparently have a beer or two at school, but leave
campus for any serious drinking.
They also noted that the present generation of
students adopted the habit of leaving school to
drink before on-campus pubs became common.
