# Tough 1975 Pollution Standards Postponed To Aid Auto Industry

From The Associated Press
WASHINGTON — The government yesterday granted the
auto industry an additional year to meet the tough 1975
exhaust pollution standards. The government also agreed
to apply tougher standards for cars sold in California.
However, it said it will impose interim restrictions on
the amounts of pollutants permitted to spew out of
tailpipes of 1975 model year cars.
General Motors and Ford Motor Co. said the interim
restrictions will be difficult to attain.
Shirking Responsibility
Consumer and environmental groups denounced the
year's delay as action shirking a responsibility to the
public.
William D. Ruckelshaus, administrative head of the
Environmental Protection Agency announced the decision
and commented, "Compared with today's cars the
reductions required in 1975 by this decision move us for
the non-California market half the distance, and for the
California market two-thirds of the way to the 1975
standards."
Interim standards will require the installation of
catalysts on all domestic cars sold in California and on
some models nationwide in 1975, Ruckelshaus said.
$45 Per Vehicle
He estimated the catalyst requirement would not result
in a sticker price rise greater than $45 per vehicle.
"We're hoping that cost is simply not imposed on the
California consumer," he said. "It's my hope the auto
companies spread the costs across the line."
But, all domestic and most foreign car makers cited

technical and production difficulties with the catalytic
converter in asking for the delay. The catalytic converter
is a cannister-like device attached to the auto to insure
cleaner burning.
Severe Problem
California needed tougher 1975 federal antismog
standards than the rest of the nation because of its "large
number of autos — about 12 million and a very severe air
pollution problem," stated George Taylor, deputy
executive officer of the California State Air Resources
Board.
The 1975 standards in California will require new cars
to emit 65 percent less hydrocarbons and 70 percent less
carbon monoxide particles, Taylor said.
Critics such as staff director Michael McCloskey of the
Sierra Club disagreed with Taylor's interpretation of the
EPA action. McCloskey called the EPA ruling "a tragic
capitulation to the auto industry" and predicted Congress
will be the target of a massive auto industry effort in the
coming year to weaken the proposed standards.
Court Challenge
McCloskey added his group was looking into the
possibility of a court challenge of the EPA ruling.
Both Galen Kinley and Bob Lunche, air pollution
control chiefs in Riverside and Los Angeles, said they
regretted that the EPA decided to give the auto industry
another year to meet a 90 percent emission reduction
goal.
"They've had too many years in which to come up
with controls to solve this very serious problem," Lunche
said.
