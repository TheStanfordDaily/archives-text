Consumer Digest will focus on various news items of interest to
consumers on a weekly basis. Material for the column will come
primarily from consumer publications and local newspapers. Readers
with items of interest that might be useful for the column should
submit them to the Consumer Affairs Department, The Stanford
Daily, Stanford 94305.)

A four week Consumer Information Series in Escondido Village
will open this morning with a presentation on "Consumer Fraud," by
Thomas Hanford, a deputy district attorney who handles consumer
fraud. Each of the four presentations in the series will take place on
Thursday from 10-11:30 a.m. in the Escondido Village Cottage
Meeting Room.
The other events in the series will be: April 19 — "Hazardous
Toys" — Stephanie Gray of the Food and Drug Administration; April
26 — "Consumer Protection: Deceptive Packaging, etc." — Ted Moller
of the Santa Clara County Department of Weights and Measures and
May 3 — "Food Additives, Nutritional Labeling, Vitamins and
Minerals," featuring a yet unnamed consumer specialist and a health
food specialist.

There have been quite a few advances in product labeling in recent
years, but people are still dying from incomplete labels. The current
issue of "Media and Consumer," a new monthly consumer tabloid
published in New York, details the case of a 10 year old boy who died
last year in Massachusetts because of a vague label on an ice cream
container.
Michael Grzybinski had an allergy since infancy to peanuts and
peanut products. While at a friend's house, he ate some "Butterfinger"
ice cream. Peanuts were not among the ingredients listed on the
container, but the ice cream was peanut-buttered flavored. The boy
died shortly after eating the ice cream due to his allergic reaction
which caused swelling throughout his body, especially in his lungs.
A Food and Drug Administration official said that this tragedy
involved no violation of federal standards. Because of this absence of
comprehensive federal laws, the Massachusetts Consumers Council has
used this case as a basis for lobbying for state action on
nutritonal and ingredient labeling. Consumers who wish to prevent
similar tragedies are urged to write to both their federal and state
legislators urging comprehensive legislative action in this area.

Bay Area meat sales declined approximately 40 percent last week
as a result of the mat boycott and some consumer activists are calling
for continued meatless Tuesdays and Thursdays and a possible
resumption of the boycott during the first week of May, unless prices
are reduced 15 percent by May 1. Here are some capsule comments
about the boycott.
Housewife Pat Gorman of Waterville, Maine said, "We've been
brainwashed by Madison Avenue into eating meat. They tell families
that a husband who doesn't put red meat on the table is not a good
provider. That is not so!"
An anonymous Bank of America agricultural analyst said, "Six
months from now it will be as if the boycott never happened, because
it isn't just meat — it's the whole inflationary economy. And that isn't
going to end until the government does something about it."
Everett Matzen, a secretary-treasurer for the Butchers Union, said,
"The meatworkers are paying the price of this boycott. We've become
the whipping boys of this inflationary economy. It's not fair."
And as if to soothe the angry consumer beast, the San Francisco
Examiner on Sunday published figures showing that food prices are
not as bad as they appear to be, relative to average hourly earnings of
the American worker. According to Department of Labor statistics, as
of last February, the average American worker had to work only half
as long to earn the money for a pound of hamburger as he did in
1950.
In 1950 it took the average wage earner 6.5 minutes to earn the
cost of a pound of bread and in February of this year, it took 6.4
minutes. Pass the soybeans, please.

as a result of the mat boycott and some consumer activists are calling
for continued meatless Tuesdays and Thursdays and a possible
resumption of the boycott during the first week of May, unless prices
are reduced 15 percent by May 1. Here are some capsule comments
about the boycott.
Housewife Pat Gorman of Waterville, Maine said, "We've been
brainwashed by Madison Avenue into eating meat. They tell families
that a husband who doesn't put red meat on the table is not a good
provider. That is not so!"
An anonymous Bank of America agricultural analyst said, "Six
months from now it will be as if the boycott never happened, because
it isn't just meat — it's the whole inflationary economy. And that isn't
going to end until the government does something about it."
Everett Matzen, a secretary-treasurer for the Butchers Union, said,
"The meatworkers are paying the price of this boycott. We've become
the whipping boys of this inflationary economy. It's not fair."
And as if to soothe the angry consumer beast, the San Francisco
Examiner on Sunday published figures showing that food prices are
not as bad as they appear to be, relative to average hourly earnings of
the American worker. According to Department of Labor statistics, as
of last February, the average American worker had to work only half
as long to earn the money for a pound of hamburger as he did in
1950.
In 1950 it took the average wage earner 6.5 minutes to earn the
cost of a pound of bread and in February of this year, it took 6.4
minutes. Pass the soybeans, please.

There have been quite a few advances in product labeling in recent
years, but people are still dying from incomplete labels. The current
issue of "Media and Consumer," a new monthly consumer tabloid
published in New York, details the case of a 10 year old boy who died
last year in Massachusetts because of a vague label on an ice cream
container.
Michael Grzybinski had an allergy since infancy to peanuts and
peanut products. While at a friend's house, he ate some "Butterfinger"
ice cream. Peanuts were not among the ingredients listed on the
container, but the ice cream was peanut-buttered flavored. The boy
died shortly after eating the ice cream due to his allergic reaction
which caused swelling throughout his body, especially in his lungs.
A Food and Drug Administration official said that this tragedy
involved no violation of federal standards. Because of this absence of
comprehensive federal laws, the Massachusetts Consumers Council has
used this case as a basis for lobbying for state action on
nutritonal and ingredient labeling. Consumers who wish to prevent
similar tragedies are urged to write to both their federal and state
legislators urging comprehensive legislative action in this area.
