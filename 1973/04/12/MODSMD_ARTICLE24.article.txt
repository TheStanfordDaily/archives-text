# U.S.S.R.'s Ballet, Opera Visit U.S.A.

Cultural Exchange Agreements
between the U.S.A. and the
U.S.S.R. are negotiated years in
advance, so it comes as no surprise
to find the respective cultural
calendars of the two nations being
filled for three years hence.
1976 jointly marks the 200 th
anniversary of the American
Revolution and the 200 th
anniversary of the Soviet Union's
Bolshoi Theater. Moving logically,
major American impresarios are
bidding on bringing the entire
Bolshoi opera and ballet here to
complement American
Bicentennial festivities.
This important gesture would
cap a current Washington, D.C.
exhibition of Matisse and Leger
paintings from Leningrad's
Hermitage, in the U.S. for the first
time, as well as a 1974 nationwide
Kirov Ballet tour.
News of the 1976 Bolshoi bid
was revealed publicly by Ronald
A. Wilford, president of Columbia
Artists Management, Inc. at a
recent lunch he hosted in
Washington D.C. for Yekaterina
A. Furtseva, Soviet Minister of

Culture in charge of the
Matisse-Leger exhibit.
Wilford said it would be a
significant step forward in
Soviet-American relations if the
Bolshoi companies would come
here, either through his auspices
or those of his major competitor,
Sol Hurok, who up to now has
had a corner on the Bolshoi in the
U.S.
In an independent bid in
February, Hurok sent Simon
Semenoff, Dance Coordinator for
Hurok, Inc. and liaison-interpreter
to Nureyev, to Moscow.
Semenoff, under Hurok's
jurisdiction since the beginning of
his Western dance career with
Ballet Russe in 1973, has soloed
or choreographed for Ballet
Theater (now American Ballet
Theater), Marquis de Cuevas and
the Harkness Ballet in addition to
Ballet Russe. His last performance
was as Catalabutte in Nureyev's
film, "Sleeping Beauty," which
was broadcast nationwide on
television over the Christmas
holidays.
The Bolshoi Ballet has been to
the United States before but the
opera never has.
