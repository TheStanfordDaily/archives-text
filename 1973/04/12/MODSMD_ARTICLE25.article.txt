# Good Poetry Saves New 'Sequoia'
## The 						'Daily' Entertainment 
### FRANK HUSTACE 
An unfortunately poor offering
of new fiction, only partially
off-set by several good pieces of
poetry, hurts the Winter issue of
"Sequoia," Stanford's Literary
magazine, and the final product is
a generally weaker effort than its
Fall counterpart.
The general mood is
reflectively quiet, even
melancholy in certain instances,
and makes comments on many of
the minute aspects of nature and
humanity that can only be
perceived after close scrutiny and
peaceful introspection.
Representative of this mood is
Charlea Massion's "Her Three
Cats" in which the authoress uses
a controlled delicacy to pare away
the cats of her imagination and
reality in a successful effort to
bring the reader within for a closer
view.
The taut energy in her
description of the "chill labyrinth
of movement" in the dissecting
cat's banded muscles gives an eerie
vitality to the dead tissue and
serves as an effective contrast to
the live cat, Esmeral, who
"twitches lightly in sleep."
Stressing Extremes
By stressing the extremes, her
"curiosity" of the biological cat
which is as mysterious and remote
as the figmental cat "stalking the
gold center of dream," and her
detached view of Esmeral who is
equally independent and who
"stalks robins in the grass,"
Massion uncovers a common
factor binding the three together:
each one manages to retain a
distinctly unique individuality, an
individuality that transcends the
mutability and decay of life and
the fantasies of the imagination.
Mark Rathbun's portrayal of
Stolypin in his short story,
"What's This Scar on Your
Thing?," a character who
represents yet another pitiable
casualty in the seemingly
never-ending real or imagined
"war" between men and women,
is reminiscent of a Thurburian
jaunt along the twisting road
toward connubial disaster.
Stolypin, chained to a piece of
lawn furniture by his
overpowering wife, is an
emasculated human being, unable
to understand or object to the
dizzying reality that swirls around
him. Sorlin, a remarkably
eloquent mute and Stolypin's
unknowing compatriot, is similar
in that in his own reality as a
middle-aged motorcycle
gangmember, he is nearly as
helpless.
Brief Attempt
Though he briefly attempts to
fight it, in the end, he, too, is
overwhelmed by "the quick
rhetoric and self-confident air" of
those who choose to dominate
him. Eventually, he is bound and
booted with Stolypin into a desert
of sterility by the well-placed heel
of a woman.
Although "Scar" is interesting
and often very funny, it suffers

from a lack of cohesion. The
changing narrative perspectives
seem undisciplined and rather
than converging into a tight unit.
They remain loose and hang
separately,
"Heaven" by Michael Rogozen
is a simple story and is successful
in holding the reader's interest
through to the end. The idea
behind it may perhaps be
somewhat of a cliche, but it is a
cliche in a refreshingly new
presentation.
Warning
Early in life, the protagonist of
the story is accosted by a dwarfish
beggar and warned "If you go to
Heaven you must be very careful.
The horrors of Hell are honest and
real, but the angels of Heaven
enjoy playing tricks."
The warning is given scant
consideration by the man because
he is too concerned with his
present life to worry about the
dangers he might encounter after
death: "Enjoyment of the
present. . . was my rule for
living." His eventual death and the
temptations he experiences in
Heaven are delightful and
humorous and with his final
understanding and confrontation
with the "tricks" the angels of
Heaven enjoy playing, the story is
neatly completed.
The simple writing is clear and
vigorous and the movement is not
burdened with difficult and
extraneous descriptions. The pace
moves quickly to its conclusion
and Rogozen is careful not to let
his meaning diffuse through
over-simplification.
Hampered Pace
Not nearly as successful is
Brock Dethier's story, 'The
Correspondence." Unlike
"Heaven," the page is bogged
down with needless descriptions
and stilted prose. The author
intended the descriptive
digressions to reveal the inner
consciousnesses of his characters,
but the attempt is largely
unsuccessful and despite the
exhaustive effort, they remain
anonymous and predictable
personalities.
Dethier wants to portray the
dull, mundane existence of Anne,
yet the method he has chosen is
faulty. Boring the reader seems a
singularly inappropriate
convention to use to portray
boredom in a story.
"Clockwork" by Tina Cooper
provides an insight into a
relationship running with
mechanical precision where
freedom is reduced and replaced
by automatic reactions. The
ability of the character in the
poem to react spontaneously is
trapped and suppressed; they go
"cold and sour, caught in
clockwork."
Final Realization
The final realization that "you
are too considerate of time, and
not enough of love," reveals the
staleness of a clockwork
relationship that has been strictly
regulated by an unemotional time

schedule.
Dana Gioia presents several
interesting approaches to
affection in his three offerings
and utilizes camera-like flashes to
expose the minute details of love.
The equally frightening
contrastive alternatives of
proximity and remoteness are
revealed in a series of serene
evening glimpses; there is a
capture of a brief moment, a still
life, which dangles uncertainly for
an instant and then vanishes with
hurried footsteps; the intensity of
an emotional attachment
nonetheless seems miniature when
contrasted with the larger sweep
of nature.
In this last glimpse, discussed
in "A Dragon's Tear: An
Aubade," it is not until there is an
awareness that the "cool stillness
spreading now over our worlds is
only a dream" that there is a final
realization that some aspects of
love, like the glistening dew in the
garden, are transient and will not
endure.
Notable Efforts
Other notable efforts include
Charlea Massion's "Young
Woman's Song" in which the
young, romantic visions of the
moon and life are replaced by an
acceptance of reality. Her ascent
to the "zero point" of her life was
marked with naivete and only
after a confrontation with a new
life does the arc appear to take a
downward turn.
'The Blue of My Lace," by
David Scranton keeps a distance
between the reader and the
speaker who masks his appearance
with his apparel, "my swirling
lace." Despite this camouflage,
the speaker wants to be seen and
understood for what he is without
having to consciously reveal it to
others.
Mark Rathbun's artwork is
adequate, but a variety of styles,
perhaps with the solicitation of
other artists, is needed and would
provide a welcome change.
Delicate Poem
Michael Stillman, in "Broken
Glass," combines a recurring
structure with a simple rhyme
pattern to produce a delicate and
haunting poem.
Despite the inclusion of weak
fiction, the editors and staff of
"Sequoia" have put together a
fine issue and the magazine seems
to have been resurrected from its
rather characteristic lethargy of
several years ago and is now a
vibrant and exciting publication.
The Winter issue is well worth
consideration by the Stanford
Community.
