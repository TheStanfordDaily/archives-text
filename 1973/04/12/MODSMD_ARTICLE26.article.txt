# Once Around The Turntable
## Record Cuts Disappoint 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
Around The World With Three
Dog Nite—Three Dog Night
Dunhill DSY 50138 (two record
set)
There is a kind of radical chic
among many FM devotees who
feel they must criticize any group
which has had a number of AM
hits. Three Dog Night has had a
few real losers, but at the risk of
causing a string of hate letters, I
will admit that I have liked most

of their material.
Unfortunately, as far as this
album is concerned, Three Dog
flight should've stayed at home.
Live albums almost invariably
suffer from crowd noise and poor
sound reproduction and this is no
exception. Three Dog Night's
"Live at the Forum" album was
one of the better concert albums,
but this double LP is quite
mediocre.
Success has taken its toll and
the group is extremely sloppy on
much of the album. Most of the
songs are performed
half-heartedly and the musicians
waste a lot of time making small
talk with the audience. It all
seems very cocky.
Most of the cuts are the
familiar hits and those that aren't
are possibly the worst on the
album. There is a jam which is a
complete waste of time and the
featured drum solo isn't a real
thriller either. I still respect Three
Dog Night's ability, but they
certainly should do better than
this album.
—Don Tollefson
Heart breaker—Free
Island SW 9324
Free broke onto the rock scene
in 1970 with "All Right Now,"
which as become one of the
LSJUMB's all time classics. Many
people have since claimed that
Free is a one-hit group, but that
isn't totally fair.
Free has a lot of potential but
"Heartbreaker" is of very mixed
quality. The first three songs on
the album are the kind of fine
rockers which Free excel at.
"Wishing Well" is a good medium
rocker, which has received some
AM exposure and "Come
Together in the Morning" and

'Travelling In Style" are also very
good.
But the other five cuts are a bit
monotonous and bland. They are
not really good, but they are not
really bad either. On these cuts
the group seems to be trying too
hard to fit into a mold of
"heaviness," instead of developing
their own unique quality.
Hopefully Free's talent won't
continue going to waste for too
long.

Artificial Paradise—The Guess
Who
RCA LSP4B3O
Much like Three Dog Night,
The Guess Who has suffered from
an undeserved AM stigma. This
Canadian group has had a large
number of gold records, many of
which were valid artistic successes.
But The Guess Who seems to
have gotten into a rut. All of their
songs are beginning to sound the
same and they seem to be
stagnating. In the constantly
changing world of rock music,
good groups have to keep
progressing if they hope to
continue to be critically
acclaimed. Unfortunately, both
The Guess Who and Three Dog
Night seem to be slipping into the
trap of trying to live off their
previous successes.
The album's first song, "Bye
Bye Babe," is a good one, but
everything's pretty much downhill
from there. It is frankly very
difficult to separate most of the
other numbers which sound like
the products of an assembly line.
Hopefully the Guess Who's
demise will be short-lived.

feel they must criticize any group
which has had a number of AM
hits. Three Dog Night has had a
few real losers, but at the risk of
causing a string of hate letters, I
will admit that I have liked most

of their material.
Unfortunately, as far as this
album is concerned, Three Dog
flight should've stayed at home.
Live albums almost invariably
suffer from crowd noise and poor
sound reproduction and this is no
exception. Three Dog Night's
"Live at the Forum" album was
one of the better concert albums,
but this double LP is quite
mediocre.
Success has taken its toll and
the group is extremely sloppy on
much of the album. Most of the
songs are performed
half-heartedly and the musicians
waste a lot of time making small
talk with the audience. It all
seems very cocky.
Most of the cuts are the
familiar hits and those that aren't
are possibly the worst on the
album. There is a jam which is a
complete waste of time and the
featured drum solo isn't a real
thriller either. I still respect Three
Dog Night's ability, but they
certainly should do better than
this album.

Heart breaker—Free
Island SW 9324
Free broke onto the rock scene
in 1970 with "All Right Now,"
which as become one of the
LSJUMB's all time classics. Many
people have since claimed that
Free is a one-hit group, but that
isn't totally fair.
Free has a lot of potential but
"Heartbreaker" is of very mixed
quality. The first three songs on
the album are the kind of fine
rockers which Free excel at.
"Wishing Well" is a good medium
rocker, which has received some
AM exposure and "Come
Together in the Morning" and

'Travelling In Style" are also very
good.
But the other five cuts are a bit
monotonous and bland. They are
not really good, but they are not
really bad either. On these cuts
the group seems to be trying too
hard to fit into a mold of
"heaviness," instead of developing
their own unique quality.
Hopefully Free's talent won't
continue going to waste for too
long.

Artificial Paradise—The Guess
Who
RCA LSP4B3O
Much like Three Dog Night,
The Guess Who has suffered from
an undeserved AM stigma. This
Canadian group has had a large
number of gold records, many of
which were valid artistic successes.
But The Guess Who seems to
have gotten into a rut. All of their
songs are beginning to sound the
same and they seem to be
stagnating. In the constantly
changing world of rock music,
good groups have to keep
progressing if they hope to
continue to be critically
acclaimed. Unfortunately, both
The Guess Who and Three Dog
Night seem to be slipping into the
trap of trying to live off their
previous successes.
The album's first song, "Bye
Bye Babe," is a good one, but
everything's pretty much downhill
from there. It is frankly very
difficult to separate most of the
other numbers which sound like
the products of an assembly line.
Hopefully the Guess Who's
demise will be short-lived.
