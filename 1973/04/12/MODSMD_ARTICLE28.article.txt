Seiji Ozawa and the San
Francisco Symphony will depart
in one month on the Symphony's
first tour of Europe and the
Soviet Union. A pension fund
concert previewing works to be
presented on the tour was given
laM Sunday at the War Memorial
Opeia House, and it proved to be
another tribute to Ozawa's
imagination as a programmer and
skill as a conductor.
The Caruon duodecimi toni of
Giovanni Gabrieli was composed
for the brass instrumentalists of
Saint Mark's Cathedral in late
16th century Venice. The eleven
members of the Symphony brass
section who performed the piece
have not yet fully mastered it, but
it will most probably improve on
tour.
There was evidence of some
insecurity in exposed trumpet
passages, and the attack is still a
bit imprecise. The echo effects
and terrace dynamics were
skillfully handled, however, so
this promises to become a real
showpiece for the brasses.
Instead of Mozart or Haydn,
Ozawa turned to Johann Christian
Bach to demonstrate his and the
orchestra's interpretation of the
classical symphony. The Sinfonia
in D Major, Opus 18, No. 4 dates
from the mid-1770'5.

Although Christian's father,
Johann Sebastian Bach, was the
greatest of all baroque composers,
the youngest son's style shows
hardly a trace of any 'paternal
influence. His is the music of a
man who had absorbed the gallant
style in Italy and preferred the

urbane sophistication of London
to his homeland.
Opus 18, No. 4 is a suave piece
in three movements. The
influence of Italian opera is
notable in the aria-like melody of
the Andante, and the composer's
wit is expressed in unusual

syncopated effects and echoes in
the finale. Ozawa conducted
spiritedly, making the Sinfonia at
least as interesting as the Haydn
symphonies we have heard this
season.
The highlight of the tour
sampler was the American

premiere of The Cloud Messenger
by Loren Rush. Rush has a
doctorate from Stanford and has
received a number of prestigious
awards, including the Rome Prize
and a Guggenheim fellowship.
Currently he is a member of the
Stanford Computer Music Project
as a Stanford Artificial

Intelligence Project Visiting
Scholar.
The Cloud Messenger is scored
for 99 individually defined
instrumental parts. This kind of
orchestration implies both a dense
texture and a massive body of
sound. The music is concerned

with varying degrees of alteration
of tone color within the massive
sound structure, as well as an
exploration of the entire dynamic
spectrum, punctuated by sound
fragments which evoke melodic
ideas.
The composition begins with
almost soundless string tremolos,
eerie at first, but which gradually
take on an ethereal beauty. Rush's
use of most of the instruments in
their high or extreme high
registers makes the texture seem
lighter than it is.
As the body of sound moves

and grows, new musical events
periodically evolve and culminate
in an intense dynamic shock wave
supported by the percussion
section. This overwhelming
cacophony then dies away almost
as quickly as it came, returning
the listener to the musical idea of
sonorous motion and growth.
Firm Control
Ozawa was firmly in control of
the piece. He seems to understand
this work as well as any from
the traditional repertoire. Often
(perhaps because of performing
instructions by the composer) he
conducted in a wide, sweeping
circular motion, occasionally
coming straight down from the
zenith of the circle grasping the
baton in both hands like a samurai
sword.
It is always difficult to isolate
and distill the essence and assess
the significance of a piece of new
music, but even on one hearing it
is evident that Rush's Cloud
Messenger deserves more
exposure. It is constructed with
extreme care and is an engrossing
work both for those already
committed to contemporary
music and for those new to it. We
hope the Russians like it.
As a finale, Ozawa offered
T c h a ik o w sky ' s Fourth
Symphony. This is not our
favorite music, but Ozawa
conducted as if he believed in it
and the audience loved it. Rush's
Cloud Messenger received more
than the usual polite applause
accorded premieres of
contemporary music, but a
standing ovation for Tchaikowsky
showed where the affections of
the audience lay.
