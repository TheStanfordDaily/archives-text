# Investigating New Uses For Grass
## 
### JERRY COLEMAN 
At age ten, I was something of
a miniature golf freak, putting my
way into numerous free games at
the local pee-wee course. Also at
that time, I saw a travel movie of
New Zealand and fell in love with
that enchanted isle, deciding on
the spot that I would make my
first fortune operating a chain of
miniature golf courses all over the
South Pacific.
Nearly eleven years and some
college history courses on
Imperialism later, I still have a
passing, but now unrelated
interest in both New Zealand and
miniature golf.
In those intervening years I
have managed to sample pee-wee
courses all over the Bay Area,
some in Southern California, the
Lake Tahoe area, and even one in
Switzerland (which, except for
the Alps in the background and
the clean air, was no different
from any of the others).
For those readers uninitiated
into the sport, let me first provide
some definitions: miniature golf
consists of nine to 36 hole
(usually 18) courses where anyone

young-at-heart attempts to hit
brightly colored golf balls down
ramps, through tubes, over small
water traps, around corners, and
into elaborate structures running
the gamut from dinosaurs to
clowns to magic castles.
Varying Difficulty
Each hole has a different
design and hence different level of
difficulty. The players are
provided with a score card which
suggests a reasonable score to try
to beat for each hole. Thus, one
competes against both his fellow
players and the course average.
One final word on
terminology: the generally
accepted, most authoritative name
for the sport is 'miniature' golf, so
named because most courses are
smaller than normal golf putting
greens, driving ranges, or the Del
Monte Estate at Pebble Beach.
One should not confuse this
name with that of 'pee-wee' golf
which is a misnomer that
adolescent miniature golf players
write on bathroom walls.
Some miniature courses are
quite imaginative, requiring one to
hit the ball into the mouth of

giant concrete snakes, leering
stegasauri with flashing light bulb
eyes, and seasick-looking Martian
androids. The ball then comer out
these creatures' tails and into the
hole.
Crucial Timing
These courses usually include
nearly-to-scale buildings of barns,
haunted houses, and the like,
whose slowly opening and closing
doors beckon the colored golf
balls. In such fancy structures,
timing is quite crucial to the final
score; once through the door, the
ball rolls into a small putting area
containing the hole.
In courses featuring this style
in the extreme, the props often
have little relation to the
difficulty of the holes, being there
merely for the aesthetic and
fanciful delight of younger
players.
The other extreme represents
courses with few play land
structures but very difficult
putting areas around the holes.
The surface of the 'green'
(actually, it is a thin, colored
carpeting) can be pimpled with
lumps, and depressions; the holes
can be placed behind barriers,
water traps, or on an inclined
slope; and curves or angles can
separate the tee (starting point)
from the hole, necessitating
numerous ricochetted shots.
These latter courses are less
expensive to build (compare a
lump under the carpet to a 12
foot dinousaur) and reflect this
economy in their prices. Yes,
prices: one must be prepared to
pay anywhere from 75 cents to
$1.75 for a game, depending on
the number and type of holes, the
location of the course, the
number of people in the party,
and whether or not it's one's
birthday.
In between the two previous
extremes in course types are those
golfing establishments that mix
both elaborateness and difficulty.
These courses seem to be the most
popular and are proliferating all
over the Western World.
Competition for business
among the courses is increasing as
well, especially in the Los Angeles
area. (By Los Angeles area, I mean
the coastal region between Santa
Barbara and the Mexican border,
and extending eastward into the
Mojave desert.) And, typical of
the Southern California frame of

mind, some of these courses have
life-size stucco castles which serve
as the year round home of the
owner.
Recent Sample
I recently sampled the Country
Club Miniature Golf course on
Marsh Road in Redwood City (15
minutes by car), finding it to be
one of the best and most fun
courses I've played on.
Practically in Stanford's back
yard, Country Club offers 2
courses (18 and 27), has thick and
multi-colored carpeting on all
holes, and features an enormous
split level playing area terraced by
lawns and fountains.
Props include 3 castles, a water
wheel, clown, pixie house,
pagoda, wishing well, tiger, rocket
ship, barn, loup-de-loup, little red
school house, giant telephone,
multiple banriers, double humps,
and even 3 volcano holes. (The
hardest of all, volcano holes
feature the hole in the top of a

cone: hit the ball too easily and it
rolls back down the cone, too
hard and it rolls down the back
side.)
Post-game Recreation
After finishing the golf game,
Country Club players can retire to
the snack bar, billiard room, and
arcade room. And if that isn't
enough, one can visit any of the 4
other courses in Southern
California in the same chain as
Country Club; among these is one
location alone containing five 18
hole courses, a giant slide, and a
moon walk!
L.A. is definitely the new
frontier for miniature golf. For
real thrills, that's the place to go;
and PSA jets leave for the
southland all day, every day.
Me? I'm booked, along with a
suitcase full of colored balls and
scorecards, on the next Qantas
flight to Guam, Samoa, Sydney,
and final destination: Auckland,
New Zealand, Cheerio!

BONUS JACK AND CHOC. SHAKE - "Smiling clown, ask not for
whom the ball rolls; it rolls for thee." So spoke one famous writer
after sinking his shot at a local miniature golf course. The ball rolls up
the ramp, through the clown, and out a tube stuck into his side
toward the hole.

After finishing the golf game,
Country Club players can retire to
the snack bar, billiard room, and
arcade room. And if that isn't
enough, one can visit any of the 4
other courses in Southern
California in the same chain as
Country Club; among these is one
location alone containing five 18
hole courses, a giant slide, and a
moon walk!
L.A. is definitely the new
frontier for miniature golf. For
real thrills, that's the place to go;
and PSA jets leave for the
southland all day, every day.
Me? I'm booked, along with a
suitcase full of colored balls and
scorecards, on the next Qantas
flight to Guam, Samoa, Sydney,
and final destination: Auckland,
New Zealand, Cheerio!

A MAN'S HOME IS HIS CASTLE — This fantasyland construction is
part of a miniature golf hole. The golfer seen here must time his shot
so as to get the ball across the moat before the drawbridge closes. In
one Southern California course, the owners live in the life-size castle

BONUS JACK AND CHOC. SHAKE - "Smiling clown, ask not for
whom the ball rolls; it rolls for thee." So spoke one famous writer
after sinking his shot at a local miniature golf course. The ball rolls up
the ramp, through the clown, and out a tube stuck into his side
toward the hole.
At age ten, I was something of
a miniature golf freak, putting my
way into numerous free games at
the local pee-wee course. Also at
that time, I saw a travel movie of
New Zealand and fell in love with
that enchanted isle, deciding on
the spot that I would make my
first fortune operating a chain of
miniature golf courses all over the
South Pacific.
Nearly eleven years and some
college history courses on
Imperialism later, I still have a
passing, but now unrelated
interest in both New Zealand and
miniature golf.
In those intervening years I
have managed to sample pee-wee
courses all over the Bay Area,
some in Southern California, the
Lake Tahoe area, and even one in
Switzerland (which, except for
the Alps in the background and
the clean air, was no different
from any of the others).
For those readers uninitiated
into the sport, let me first provide
some definitions: miniature golf
consists of nine to 36 hole
(usually 18) courses where anyone

young-at-heart attempts to hit
brightly colored golf balls down
ramps, through tubes, over small
water traps, around corners, and
into elaborate structures running
the gamut from dinosaurs to
clowns to magic castles.
Varying Difficulty
Each hole has a different
design and hence different level of
difficulty. The players are
provided with a score card which
suggests a reasonable score to try
to beat for each hole. Thus, one
competes against both his fellow
players and the course average.
One final word on
terminology: the generally
accepted, most authoritative name
for the sport is 'miniature' golf, so
named because most courses are
smaller than normal golf putting
greens, driving ranges, or the Del
Monte Estate at Pebble Beach.
One should not confuse this
name with that of 'pee-wee' golf
which is a misnomer that
adolescent miniature golf players
write on bathroom walls.
Some miniature courses are
quite imaginative, requiring one to
hit the ball into the mouth of

giant concrete snakes, leering
stegasauri with flashing light bulb
eyes, and seasick-looking Martian
androids. The ball then comer out
these creatures' tails and into the
hole.
Crucial Timing
These courses usually include
nearly-to-scale buildings of barns,
haunted houses, and the like,
whose slowly opening and closing
doors beckon the colored golf
balls. In such fancy structures,
timing is quite crucial to the final
score; once through the door, the
ball rolls into a small putting area
containing the hole.
In courses featuring this style
in the extreme, the props often
have little relation to the
difficulty of the holes, being there
merely for the aesthetic and
fanciful delight of younger
players.
The other extreme represents
courses with few play land
structures but very difficult
putting areas around the holes.
The surface of the 'green'
(actually, it is a thin, colored
carpeting) can be pimpled with
lumps, and depressions; the holes
can be placed behind barriers,
water traps, or on an inclined
slope; and curves or angles can
separate the tee (starting point)
from the hole, necessitating
numerous ricochetted shots.
These latter courses are less
expensive to build (compare a
lump under the carpet to a 12
foot dinousaur) and reflect this
economy in their prices. Yes,
prices: one must be prepared to
pay anywhere from 75 cents to
$1.75 for a game, depending on
the number and type of holes, the
location of the course, the
number of people in the party,
and whether or not it's one's
birthday.
In between the two previous
extremes in course types are those
golfing establishments that mix
both elaborateness and difficulty.
These courses seem to be the most
popular and are proliferating all
over the Western World.
Competition for business
among the courses is increasing as
well, especially in the Los Angeles
area. (By Los Angeles area, I mean
the coastal region between Santa
Barbara and the Mexican border,
and extending eastward into the
Mojave desert.) And, typical of
the Southern California frame of

mind, some of these courses have
life-size stucco castles which serve
as the year round home of the
owner.
Recent Sample
I recently sampled the Country
Club Miniature Golf course on
Marsh Road in Redwood City (15
minutes by car), finding it to be
one of the best and most fun
courses I've played on.
Practically in Stanford's back
yard, Country Club offers 2
courses (18 and 27), has thick and
multi-colored carpeting on all
holes, and features an enormous
split level playing area terraced by
lawns and fountains.
Props include 3 castles, a water
wheel, clown, pixie house,
pagoda, wishing well, tiger, rocket
ship, barn, loup-de-loup, little red
school house, giant telephone,
multiple banriers, double humps,
and even 3 volcano holes. (The
hardest of all, volcano holes
feature the hole in the top of a

cone: hit the ball too easily and it
rolls back down the cone, too
hard and it rolls down the back
side.)

Competition for business
among the courses is increasing as
well, especially in the Los Angeles
area. (By Los Angeles area, I mean
the coastal region between Santa
Barbara and the Mexican border,
and extending eastward into the
Mojave desert.) And, typical of
the Southern California frame of

mind, some of these courses have
life-size stucco castles which serve
as the year round home of the
owner.
Recent Sample
I recently sampled the Country
Club Miniature Golf course on
Marsh Road in Redwood City (15
minutes by car), finding it to be
one of the best and most fun
courses I've played on.
Practically in Stanford's back
yard, Country Club offers 2
courses (18 and 27), has thick and
multi-colored carpeting on all
holes, and features an enormous
split level playing area terraced by
lawns and fountains.
Props include 3 castles, a water
wheel, clown, pixie house,
pagoda, wishing well, tiger, rocket
ship, barn, loup-de-loup, little red
school house, giant telephone,
multiple banriers, double humps,
and even 3 volcano holes. (The
hardest of all, volcano holes
feature the hole in the top of a

cone: hit the ball too easily and it
rolls back down the cone, too
hard and it rolls down the back
side.)
Post-game Recreation
After finishing the golf game,
Country Club players can retire to
the snack bar, billiard room, and
arcade room. And if that isn't
enough, one can visit any of the 4
other courses in Southern
California in the same chain as
Country Club; among these is one
location alone containing five 18
hole courses, a giant slide, and a
moon walk!
L.A. is definitely the new
frontier for miniature golf. For
real thrills, that's the place to go;
and PSA jets leave for the
southland all day, every day.
Me? I'm booked, along with a
suitcase full of colored balls and
scorecards, on the next Qantas
flight to Guam, Samoa, Sydney,
and final destination: Auckland,
New Zealand, Cheerio!

BONUS JACK AND CHOC. SHAKE - "Smiling clown, ask not for
whom the ball rolls; it rolls for thee." So spoke one famous writer
after sinking his shot at a local miniature golf course. The ball rolls up
the ramp, through the clown, and out a tube stuck into his side
toward the hole.
At age ten, I was something of
a miniature golf freak, putting my
way into numerous free games at
the local pee-wee course. Also at
that time, I saw a travel movie of
New Zealand and fell in love with
that enchanted isle, deciding on
the spot that I would make my
first fortune operating a chain of
miniature golf courses all over the
South Pacific.
Nearly eleven years and some
college history courses on
Imperialism later, I still have a
passing, but now unrelated
interest in both New Zealand and
miniature golf.
In those intervening years I
have managed to sample pee-wee
courses all over the Bay Area,
some in Southern California, the
Lake Tahoe area, and even one in
Switzerland (which, except for
the Alps in the background and
the clean air, was no different
from any of the others).
For those readers uninitiated
into the sport, let me first provide
some definitions: miniature golf
consists of nine to 36 hole
(usually 18) courses where anyone

young-at-heart attempts to hit
brightly colored golf balls down
ramps, through tubes, over small
water traps, around corners, and
into elaborate structures running
the gamut from dinosaurs to
clowns to magic castles.
Varying Difficulty
Each hole has a different
design and hence different level of
difficulty. The players are
provided with a score card which
suggests a reasonable score to try
to beat for each hole. Thus, one
competes against both his fellow
players and the course average.
One final word on
terminology: the generally
accepted, most authoritative name
for the sport is 'miniature' golf, so
named because most courses are
smaller than normal golf putting
greens, driving ranges, or the Del
Monte Estate at Pebble Beach.
One should not confuse this
name with that of 'pee-wee' golf
which is a misnomer that
adolescent miniature golf players
write on bathroom walls.
Some miniature courses are
quite imaginative, requiring one to
hit the ball into the mouth of

giant concrete snakes, leering
stegasauri with flashing light bulb
eyes, and seasick-looking Martian
androids. The ball then comer out
these creatures' tails and into the
hole.
Crucial Timing
These courses usually include
nearly-to-scale buildings of barns,
haunted houses, and the like,
whose slowly opening and closing
doors beckon the colored golf
balls. In such fancy structures,
timing is quite crucial to the final
score; once through the door, the
ball rolls into a small putting area
containing the hole.
In courses featuring this style
in the extreme, the props often
have little relation to the
difficulty of the holes, being there
merely for the aesthetic and
fanciful delight of younger
players.
The other extreme represents
courses with few play land
structures but very difficult
putting areas around the holes.
The surface of the 'green'
(actually, it is a thin, colored
carpeting) can be pimpled with
lumps, and depressions; the holes
can be placed behind barriers,
water traps, or on an inclined
slope; and curves or angles can
separate the tee (starting point)
from the hole, necessitating
numerous ricochetted shots.
These latter courses are less
expensive to build (compare a
lump under the carpet to a 12
foot dinousaur) and reflect this
economy in their prices. Yes,
prices: one must be prepared to
pay anywhere from 75 cents to
$1.75 for a game, depending on
the number and type of holes, the
location of the course, the
number of people in the party,
and whether or not it's one's
birthday.
In between the two previous
extremes in course types are those
golfing establishments that mix
both elaborateness and difficulty.
These courses seem to be the most
popular and are proliferating all
over the Western World.
