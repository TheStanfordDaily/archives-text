# Fees, Assessments Due For Vote
## 
### SUE KING 
Five refundable fee assessments and
six proposed constitutional
amendments will appear on the ASSU
election ballot next Wednesday and
Thursday.
Students will be asked to approve
$1 fee assessments for both autumn
and winter quarters for KZSU, the
Band and the ASSU Program Fee. The
Stanford Daily and the Legal
Counseling Office, are requesting
approval of a $1 assessment for
autumn quarter.
The ASSU Program Fee provides
funding for several campus
organizations. Because these
organizations have small operating
budgets and limited specific appeal,
they are funded through the Program
Fee rather than individual assessments.
Legal Counseling Office
The Stanford Legal Counseling
Office (LCO) is proposed to advise,
represent and educate Stanford
students and their spouses in legal
affairs, according to a summary
presented to the Senate.
The $1 assessment would cover
operating expenses for a 19-month
trial period (the 1973-74 school year).
Stanford Legal Aid Society
President William Bolger feels that the
requested fee assessment for the LCO
differs from the other requests in that
it is the only new assessment. The
others are "totally familiar," according

to Bolger, because they have been on
the ballot before.
Bolger said that the LCO is a
reaction to the proposed Citizens
Advocates at Stanford, Inc., which
failed to get a requested fee assessment
in a recent election. He said that many
students were asking why they should
support a public interest law firm if
there wasn't even a student interest
law firm at Stanford.
"It seems most people would like
what would amount to legal insurance
at one dollar per year," Bolger
concluded.
KZSU Assessment
The requested assessment for KZSU
would cover operating expenses for
the next nine months, according to
Station Manager Lloyd Snook.
Money set aside from previous
assessments to cover the cost of
converting to higher power and stereo
broadcasting has been spent, according
to Snook.
KZSU is planning to begin
broadcasting in stereo "within weeks,"
and Snook says that the station's
application for conversion to higher
power has "cleared the first hurdle in
the way of approval."
Band Trip Financing
The fee assessment requested by
the Band would finance out-of-state
trips to pre-season football games for
two to three years, according to Band
Manager Doug Peterson. Tentative

plans call for the Band to play at two
out-of-state pre-season football games
and a basketball game next year.
Peterson explained that the Band
wanted to receive funds frOm student
sources rather than alumni. He cited
the example of the University of
Southern California band, saying that
they are heavily supported by alumni,
and as a result their "style and
half-time shows are controlled by the

alumni. Our Band is completely
student-run."
Support Phasing Out
Daily Editor Charlie Hoffman
emphasized that student financial
support for the Daily is being phased
out, and that he feels that this is the
last time students will be asked for
money.
According to Hoffman, the Daily is
