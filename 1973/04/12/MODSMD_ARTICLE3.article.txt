# Fees, Assessments Due For Vote
## 
### SUE KING 
Five refundable fee assessments and
six proposed constitutional
amendments will appear on the ASSU
election ballot next Wednesday and
Thursday.
Students will be asked to approve
$1 fee assessments for both autumn
and winter quarters for KZSU, the
Band and the ASSU Program Fee. The
Stanford Daily and the Legal
Counseling Office, are requesting
approval of a $1 assessment for
autumn quarter.
The ASSU Program Fee provides
funding for several campus
organizations. Because these
organizations have small operating
budgets and limited specific appeal,
they are funded through the Program
Fee rather than individual assessments.
Legal Counseling Office
The Stanford Legal Counseling
Office (LCO) is proposed to advise,
represent and educate Stanford
students and their spouses in legal
affairs, according to a summary
presented to the Senate.
The $1 assessment would cover
operating expenses for a 19-month
trial period (the 1973-74 school year).
Stanford Legal Aid Society
President William Bolger feels that the
requested fee assessment for the LCO
differs from the other requests in that
it is the only new assessment. The
others are "totally familiar," according

to Bolger, because they have been on
the ballot before.
Bolger said that the LCO is a
reaction to the proposed Citizens
Advocates at Stanford, Inc., which
failed to get a requested fee assessment
in a recent election. He said that many
students were asking why they should
support a public interest law firm if
there wasn't even a student interest
law firm at Stanford.
"It seems most people would like
what would amount to legal insurance
at one dollar per year," Bolger
concluded.
KZSU Assessment
The requested assessment for KZSU
would cover operating expenses for
the next nine months, according to
Station Manager Lloyd Snook.
Money set aside from previous
assessments to cover the cost of
converting to higher power and stereo
broadcasting has been spent, according
to Snook.
KZSU is planning to begin
broadcasting in stereo "within weeks,"
and Snook says that the station's
application for conversion to higher
power has "cleared the first hurdle in
the way of approval."
Band Trip Financing
The fee assessment requested by
the Band would finance out-of-state
trips to pre-season football games for
two to three years, according to Band
Manager Doug Peterson. Tentative

plans call for the Band to play at two
out-of-state pre-season football games
and a basketball game next year.
Peterson explained that the Band
wanted to receive funds frOm student
sources rather than alumni. He cited
the example of the University of
Southern California band, saying that
they are heavily supported by alumni,
and as a result their "style and
half-time shows are controlled by the

alumni. Our Band is completely
student-run."
Support Phasing Out
Daily Editor Charlie Hoffman
emphasized that student financial
support for the Daily is being phased
out, and that he feels that this is the
last time students will be asked for
money.
According to Hoffman, the Daily is
working on a three-year plan to
become independent by phasing out
student financial support and
University subsidies.
"It's been a matter of public
record" since last spring that the Daily
would be asking for a $1 assessment in
1973-74, according to Hoffman. He
went on to say that in the future,
financial support from students would
be used only as a last resort.
Constitutional Amendments
Among the proposed constitutional
changes is an amendment that would
make all future fee assessments
"voluntary" rather than "refundable."
Presently students must pay all fee
assessments but can collect refunds
later. ASSU Sen. Bob Barker, sponsor
of the amendment, said that he feels
students should not be made to pay
assessments that they don't want to.
He said that the refund system is not
adequate because sometimes students
cannot collect their refunds.
Opponents of the amendment,
among them ASSU President Scott
Burke, say that if fee assessments
become voluntary, many campus
organizations would be destroyed
because they wouldn't have enough
money to operate.
Barker said that a method of
implementing the amendment has not
yet been decided upon. He said that a
Senate committee would meet with
representatives from the Dean of
Student Affairs' Office and the

Accounting Office to decide on a
method of implementation. Once a
technically feasible agreement was
reached, it would be presented to the
Senate for approval as a change in the
by-laws.
Another proposal would strengthen
the veto power of the ASSU president.
Currently, a president can veto neither
the ASSU budget nor any emergency
appropriation, and the Senate can
override a veto by a majority vote.
Burke's amendment would
re-institute veto power over those
areas currently protected, and would
change the override requirement to a
three-fifths vote.
A three-member commission
charged with interpreting the ASSU
constitution would be established
under another proposal. The Senate
currently holds the power of
interpretation, but Burke says,"It
seems unfair that they should have
that power" since they are "inevitably
a party to constitutional battles."
Burke said he thinks the
commission would become a third
branch of the government apparatus,
in effect an "ASSU supreme court."
Also proposed are amendments that
would:
—establish a minimum voter
turnout of 20 percent before fee
assessment elections would be valid;
—mandate that any program fee
election be held at the same time the
presidential election is held;
—and "update the finances of the
ASSU," according to Financial
Manager Sara Moore, by clarifying
certain provisions of the constitution.
