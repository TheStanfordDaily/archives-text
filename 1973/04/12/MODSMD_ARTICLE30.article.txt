OEO Dismantling Ruled Illegal
WASHINGTON — A federal judge, holding that the
President has no power to shut down programs
enacted by Congress, ruled yesterday that the
dismantling of the Office of Economic Opportunity
is illegal.
U.S. District Court Judge William B. Jones said
the proposed termination of OEO and Community
Action Agencies could not take place until funds
run out or Congress decides to end them.
Meanwhile, in Chicago, U.S. District Court Judge
James B. Parsons refused in a similar suit to grant a
preliminary order restraining the government from
putting the agency out of business. The order was
requested by two local federal employee unions.
Parsons said the suit was filed prematurely. He
noted that the community action programs are
funded at least through 1973.
The effect of the Chicago ruling was not
immediately known. OEO officials said they would
not comment on the rulings until they are
interpreted by agency lawyers.
The suit raised a basic issue that has been argued
by the President and Congress for months —
whether the President may halt programs enacted
by Congress and mandated by the legislative branch
to be carried out.
Ellsberg Testifies
LOS ANGELES — A tense, solemn Daniel Ellsberg
told jurors yesterday how he stood among the
burning huts of a South Vietnamese village
destroyed by its own army and began to lose his
conviction that U.S. policies were right and that the
Communists would be beaten.
As he finished his emotional discription of his
Vietnam experiences, Ellsberg left the witness stand
for the noon recess, sat down at the counsel table
and sobbed. Jurors were not present when he cried.
His wife Patricia came to his side to comfort him
and he regained his composure.
Ellsberg, in a prelude to his explanation of why
he copied the Pentagon Papers study of the Vietnam
war, told how he traveled the roads of Vietnam,
talking to villagers, seeing destruction and observing
the misuse of U.S. aid efforts by South Vietnamese
officials.
He said he saw schools built with American
cement so laced with sand that the schools "were
blowing away" in the wind.
The slender, graying Ellsberg told first how he
became privy to war information so secret that even
the President was not allowed to see it and how he
was called in by the Defense Department, State
Department and White House to advise on war plans
and executive decision making. His clearances to see
classified information were much higher than top
secret, he said.
Leaning forward intensely in the witness chair
and turning to face jurors, he told how he
volunteered to accompany one-time CIA superspy
Gen. Edwin Lansdale to Vietnam in 1965 to assess
the success of U.S. non-military efforts to keep
villager* in the countryside from defecting to the

Communists. "I was to learn about a type of
political warfare," said Ellsberg.
On that trip, he said, he began to see the false
reports that had been made about potential success
and the true prospect of failure.
Cambodia Requests Help
SAIGON — Cambodia's president was reported
yesterday to have requested the help of South
Vietnamese troops and warplanes to fight
Communist forces which have taken over much of
his country and threaten th#capital of Phnom Penh.
President Nixon's special emissary, Gen.
Alexander M. Haig Jr., flew back to Phnom Penh for
a second visit last night after a meeting in Saigon
with Premier Tran Thien Khiem. It is speculated
they discussed the request.
Haig's four-nation tour also has taken him to
Thailand and Laos for what is described as an
assessment of the military, political and economic
situation in Indochina following the Jan. 27 Paris
peace agreement.
An attack on Communist-held areas of Cambodia
by South Vietnamese forces is one of the
alternatives deputy Haig is expected to offer for
presidential consideration when he returns from
Indochina today.
The White House yesterday said no time has been
set for a Haig-Nixon meeting, but officials said it
would be soon. However, the White House said the
session would not necessarily be during a National
Security Council meeting set for this morning at the
presidential mountain retreat at Camp David, Md.
There have been reports that President Nixon is
considering some strong action to back up his
previous warnings that he will not tolerate
continued North Vietnamese violations of the
Vietnam cease-fire and understandings reached with
Hanoi concerning Cambodia.
Other possible options for Nixon in Cambodia
range from continuing the present level of 852
bombing attacks in Cambodia to extending the air
raids to cover North Vietnamese supply lines such as
the Ho Chi Minh trail through Laos, Cambodia and
South Vietnam.
At this stage, sources say there is little chance of
the resumption of American attacks on North
Vietnam itself and the President is precluded from
sending American ground troops into Cambodia.
Meal Boycott To Continue
WASHINGTON — About 150 women meat boycott
leaders formed a National Consumers Congress
yesterday and voted to urge the American consumer
not to buy or eat meat on Tuesday and Thursdays.
The boycott leaders also set up a "national day
of protest" against high food prices for Saturday,
May 5. The exact form of the protest is still up in
the air but the congress said there would be
demonstrations by local housewives.
UFW Prepares To Fight
ARVIN, Calif. — The United Farm Workers braced
yesterday for "the approaching storm," and Cesar

Chavez said the union will battle growers and the
Teamsters with strikes and a nationwide boycott.
Chavez said he has abandoned any hope of
renegotiating table grape contracts with growers in
the Coachella and San Joaquin Valleys. Many of the
contracts expire this weekend, and others expire in
late July.
The United Farm Workers leader said the growers
want the Teamsters, so his union is going to try and
stop the sale of grapes. "We're ready to fight," said
Chavez as he laid out the battle plan that is
expected to unfold next week.
The negotiations have been stalemated since
Monday when Chavez and counsel Jerry Cohen
walked out of the talks which had shifted from
Palm Springs to Bakersfield. The talks were
discontinued after a third set of growers raised the
question of whether the Teamsters or UFW should
be the negotiating union.
Nazi Bormann Declared Dead
FRANKFURT, Germany — Martin Bormann, a Nazi
phantom pursued around the globe, was officially
declared dead yesterday and taken off West
Germany's most-wanted list.
Atty. Gen. Horst Gauf said a skeleton unearthed
in West Berlin last December was with "absolute
certainty" that of Hitler's long-sought deputy.
If, despite the closing of the Bormann mystery
case book, someone identified as Martin Bormann is
arrested anywhere in the world, "we will know we
are dealing with an innocent man," Gauf told a
news conference.
"Martin Bormann died on May 2,1945, between
1 and 3 a.m. on the Invalidenstrasse railroad bridge
in Berlin a short time after his accomplice Adolf
Hitler," Gauf declared.
Hitler committed suicide in his Russian-encircled
Berlin bunker on April 30.
Glass splinters found in the skull identified as
Bormann's indicated that Bormann also committed
suicide, biting into a glass cyanide capsule to avoid
capture by the Russians.
