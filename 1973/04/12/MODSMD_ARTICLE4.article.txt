# Two Years Ago Today

Today marks the second
anniversary of the Palo Alto
Police Department's
unprecedented search of the
Stanford Daily offices.
On April 12, 1971, four PAPD
officers, armed with a search
warrant issued by a municipal
court judge, methodically
examined desks, files, and even
wastebaskets for 45 minutes.
They were looking for photos or
negatives taken at an April 9
melee at the Stanford Hospital.
Although the officers left
empty-handed, the Daily filed suit
in federal district court. On Oct.
5, 1972, Judge Robert F.
Peckham ruled the search — the
only one of its kind ever executed

agaiast a newspaper — illegal and
unconstitutional.
Peckham concluded that the
search posed a threat to the
Daily's newsgathering abilities,
and issued strict guidelines
governing all searches of parties
not suspected of a crime.
Defendants in the suit —
including the four policemen,
Police Chief James Zurcher, and
several other city and Santa Clara
County officials — will appeal
Peckham's decision to the Ninth
Circuit Court of Appeal.
Peckham is currently
considering a motion by Daily
attorneys to force the defendants
to pay some $27,000 in lawyers'
fees.
