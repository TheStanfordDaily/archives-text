# Fund Campaign Collects $100 Million In Gifts
## 
### MARK SIMONIAN 
The five-year $300 million
Campaign for Stanford has advanced
past the $100 million mark in gifts and
pledges since it was announced
publicly last year, according to figures
presented yesterday at the University
Board of Trustees meeting.
The Campaign, noted as the largest
intensive fund drive ever undertaken
by a private university, was launched a
year ago yesterday with a $45 million
nucleus fund.
Board of Trustees President Robert
Minge Brown reported to the Trustees

that as of March 31, the Campaign has
gathered funds to begin construction
of the new Law School building, to
build the Fairchild Center for the
Neurosciences and to endow one
deanship, 50 professorships, and 44
new scholarship and fellowship funds.
'Remarkable Dedication'
Brown priased donors and
volunteers in the drive for "remarkable
dedication" in substantially increasing
the rate of private gift support to the
University since its last major
campaign during 1961-64, which set a
national record at that time of $114
million.
More than 2600 alumni volunteers
have helped in the initial phase of the
five-year drive. By the end of the
second year, an estimated 3500 will be
involved, along with faculty and
student volunteers.
The current Campaign seeks $125
million for endowment, primarily to
support student financial aid and
professorships. Other objectives of the
drive include $92 million to meet
current operating needs and $83
million for critical building
requirements.
Brown commented on the success
to date of the Campaign with guarded
optimism. "An immense amount of

hard work lies ahead," he stated, "but
the Campaign for Stanford has
generated great momentum, and we
have every reason to be very
encouraged."
Lyman 'Heartened'
President Richard Lyman,
"heartened by what we have
accomplished," said it was
"particularly encouraging that 62
percent of the donors to the Stanford
Annual Fund have increased their gifts
over the last year, reflecting the
impact of a $1 million pledge to match
new gifts and increases from prior
donors to the fund.
"But," Lyman warned, "the job is
by no means over. There is no cause to
be complacent."
34 Percent Of Goal
Campaign communication director
David Fulton was also pleased with
"the good progress to date. We have
reached 34 percent of our goal."
Both Lyman and Fulton also
cautioned that some of the $100
million has not been officially
donated, only pledged, making the
actual cash total somewhat less than
the official fund mark.
Chancellor J.E. Wallace Sterling and
Trustee Richard E. Guggenhime are
national co-chairmen of the Campaign.

accomplished," said it was
"particularly encouraging that 62
percent of the donors to the Stanford
Annual Fund have increased their gifts
over the last year, reflecting the
impact of a $1 million pledge to match
new gifts and increases from prior
donors to the fund.
"But," Lyman warned, "the job is
by no means over. There is no cause to
be complacent."
34 Percent Of Goal
Campaign communication director
David Fulton was also pleased with
"the good progress to date. We have
reached 34 percent of our goal."
Both Lyman and Fulton also
cautioned that some of the $100
million has not been officially
donated, only pledged, making the
actual cash total somewhat less than
the official fund mark.
Chancellor J.E. Wallace Sterling and
Trustee Richard E. Guggenhime are
national co-chairmen of the Campaign.
The five-year $300 million
Campaign for Stanford has advanced
past the $100 million mark in gifts and
pledges since it was announced
publicly last year, according to figures
presented yesterday at the University
Board of Trustees meeting.
The Campaign, noted as the largest
intensive fund drive ever undertaken
by a private university, was launched a
year ago yesterday with a $45 million
nucleus fund.
Board of Trustees President Robert
Minge Brown reported to the Trustees

that as of March 31, the Campaign has
gathered funds to begin construction
of the new Law School building, to
build the Fairchild Center for the
Neurosciences and to endow one
deanship, 50 professorships, and 44
new scholarship and fellowship funds.
'Remarkable Dedication'
Brown priased donors and
volunteers in the drive for "remarkable
dedication" in substantially increasing
the rate of private gift support to the
University since its last major
campaign during 1961-64, which set a
national record at that time of $114
million.
More than 2600 alumni volunteers
have helped in the initial phase of the
five-year drive. By the end of the
second year, an estimated 3500 will be
involved, along with faculty and
student volunteers.
The current Campaign seeks $125
million for endowment, primarily to
support student financial aid and
professorships. Other objectives of the
drive include $92 million to meet
current operating needs and $83
million for critical building
requirements.
Brown commented on the success
to date of the Campaign with guarded
optimism. "An immense amount of

hard work lies ahead," he stated, "but
the Campaign for Stanford has
generated great momentum, and we
have every reason to be very
encouraged."
Lyman 'Heartened'
President Richard Lyman,
"heartened by what we have
accomplished," said it was
"particularly encouraging that 62

Annual Fund have increased their gifts
