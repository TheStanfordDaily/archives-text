# Prof Describes Role Of 'Non-Sexual' Sex
## 
### TERRY ANZUR 
He rant A. Katchadourian,
instructor of a popular course in
human sexuality, outlined the
historical, cross-cultural, and
contemporary significance of man's
non-sexual uses of sex at the final
session of the Tuesday Evening
Lecture Series in Memorial
Auditorium.
The associate phychiatry professor
told an audience of 500 people that
sexuality, despite its universality, is
not easy to define. Although
reproduction and sexual pleasure are
man's purely sexual motivations for
sexual activity, it is more difficult to
categorize the ways different human
societies use sex as a means of
fulfilling "non-sexual" goals.
Katchadourian referred to
prehistoric man's attempts to exercise
ritualistic control over his environment
through the magical powers attributed
to sexual organs and acts.
Supplementing his remarks with a
series of slides, he pointed out that the
exaggerated genitalia of cult figurines
served a religious, rather than an erotic
function.
He cited examples of the religious
significance of sex from a variety of
cultures and historical periods. Roman
women and children wore amulets
representing male genitalia in an
attempt to "distract the evil eye" and
enhance fertility.
Fertility, Power, Aggression
These symbols were "clearly no
question of reproduction, but totally a
question of strength and power," he
emphasized. Just as the female
genitalia, and especially the breasts,
have symbolized fertility, the phallus

has been associated traditionally with
power and aggression.
"This preoccupation with the penis
is universal and can be seen in many
primitive cultures," Katchadourian
maintained. "Many sexual problems
can arise from fear of the power of the
male sex organs.. . and it is
impossible to dismiss what women
think and feel about the phallus."
He cited the shape of a ruler's staff
or baton as symbolic of a cultural
object which serves no other purpose
than the representation of power or
authority.
Unconscious Symbolism
"If one looks around carefully," he
continued, "monolithic objects with
unconscious symbolic meaning may be
even used for libraries." But
Katchadourian warned against
overemphasizing the sexual
significance of everyday objects by
reiterating Freud's remark,
"Gentlemen, sometimes a cigar is just
a cigar."
Katchadourian viewed the
conscious use of sex in advertising as
evidence that this association of
sexuality with means of achieving
wealth and power continues today. "If
commerce is our religion and money is
our god, then phallic symbols are
doing very well," he stated.
He presented slides showing
contemporary examples of how sexual
innuendos make advertising more
interesting by implying a sexual
payoff.
Origins Of Sexuality
"But it is not sufficient to say 'this
is the way people have behaved,' " he
added. "We have to try to understand

how these notions of sexuality came
about." He referred to studies of
threat display behavior in monkeys as
a possible clue to the importance of
the sex organs in the evolutionary
survival of man.
Katchadourian outlined various
psychological attitudes towards the
uses of sex, which are designed to
fulfill various social needs.
"Sex is a commonly used
currency," he remarked. "Some women
dispense sex to their husbands the way
they dispense candy to their children."
Aggression can serve as sexual
gratification, just as sex can take an
aggressive form. "Sex can take the
form of combat. It becomes a
battleground where something other
than sexual pleasure is being
gratified."
In addition, Katchadourian stressed
the social needs fulfilled by sex, saying

that "men as well as women view sex
as a means of filling a void — of
abandoning oneself in another person
for even a short time."
"These notions of sexuality are
deeply ingrained in human nature," he
concluded. And he stressed the
importance of maintaining a balance
between sexual and non-sexual uses of
sex.
During a question-answer period
following the one-hour lecture,
Katchadourian was asked if man "will
perpetually follow his phallus." He
demonstrated the wit which makes his
class lectures so popular by replying,
"My off hand guess is likely to do so
for a while."
Katchadourian is a university fellow
and is currently preparing a course
dealing with the life cycle. Human
Sexuality, which he has taught with
Asst. Psychiatry Prof. Donald T.
Lunde, has had the largest enrollments
of any course offered at Stanford.

that "men as well as women view sex
as a means of filling a void — of
abandoning oneself in another person
for even a short time."
"These notions of sexuality are
deeply ingrained in human nature," he
concluded. And he stressed the
importance of maintaining a balance
between sexual and non-sexual uses of
sex.
During a question-answer period
following the one-hour lecture,
Katchadourian was asked if man "will
perpetually follow his phallus." He
demonstrated the wit which makes his
class lectures so popular by replying,
"My off hand guess is likely to do so
for a while."
Katchadourian is a university fellow
and is currently preparing a course
dealing with the life cycle. Human
Sexuality, which he has taught with
Asst. Psychiatry Prof. Donald T.
Lunde, has had the largest enrollments
of any course offered at Stanford.
He rant A. Katchadourian,
instructor of a popular course in
human sexuality, outlined the
historical, cross-cultural, and
contemporary significance of man's
non-sexual uses of sex at the final
session of the Tuesday Evening
Lecture Series in Memorial
Auditorium.
The associate phychiatry professor
told an audience of 500 people that
sexuality, despite its universality, is
not easy to define. Although
reproduction and sexual pleasure are
man's purely sexual motivations for
sexual activity, it is more difficult to
categorize the ways different human
societies use sex as a means of
fulfilling "non-sexual" goals.
Katchadourian referred to
prehistoric man's attempts to exercise
ritualistic control over his environment
through the magical powers attributed
to sexual organs and acts.
Supplementing his remarks with a
series of slides, he pointed out that the
exaggerated genitalia of cult figurines
served a religious, rather than an erotic
function.
He cited examples of the religious
significance of sex from a variety of
cultures and historical periods. Roman
women and children wore amulets
representing male genitalia in an
attempt to "distract the evil eye" and
enhance fertility.
Fertility, Power, Aggression
These symbols were "clearly no
question of reproduction, but totally a
question of strength and power," he
emphasized. Just as the female
genitalia, and especially the breasts,
have symbolized fertility, the phallus

has been associated traditionally with
power and aggression.
"This preoccupation with the penis
is universal and can be seen in many
primitive cultures," Katchadourian
maintained. "Many sexual problems
can arise from fear of the power of the
male sex organs.. . and it is
impossible to dismiss what women
think and feel about the phallus."
He cited the shape of a ruler's staff
or baton as symbolic of a cultural
object which serves no other purpose
than the representation of power or
authority.
Unconscious Symbolism
"If one looks around carefully," he
continued, "monolithic objects with
unconscious symbolic meaning may be
even used for libraries." But
Katchadourian warned against
overemphasizing the sexual
significance of everyday objects by
reiterating Freud's remark,
"Gentlemen, sometimes a cigar is just
a cigar."
Katchadourian viewed the
conscious use of sex in advertising as
evidence that this association of
sexuality with means of achieving
wealth and power continues today. "If
commerce is our religion and money is
our god, then phallic symbols are
doing very well," he stated.
He presented slides showing
contemporary examples of how sexual
innuendos make advertising more
interesting by implying a sexual
payoff.
Origins Of Sexuality
"But it is not sufficient to say 'this
is the way people have behaved,' " he
added. "We have to try to understand

how these notions of sexuality came
about." He referred to studies of
threat display behavior in monkeys as
a possible clue to the importance of
the sex organs in the evolutionary
survival of man.
Katchadourian outlined various
psychological attitudes towards the
uses of sex, which are designed to
fulfill various social needs.
"Sex is a commonly used
currency," he remarked. "Some women
dispense sex to their husbands the way
they dispense candy to their children."
Aggression can serve as sexual
gratification, just as sex can take an
aggressive form. "Sex can take the
form of combat. It becomes a
battleground where something other
than sexual pleasure is being
gratified."

Last October, the Daily won a ruling from a federal judge declaring the search
illegal and unconstitutional. Litigation on the case is still in progress.
how these notions of sexuality came
about." He referred to studies of
threat display behavior in monkeys as
a possible clue to the importance of
the sex organs in the evolutionary
survival of man.
Katchadourian outlined various
psychological attitudes towards the
uses of sex, which are designed to
fulfill various social needs.
"Sex is a commonly used
currency," he remarked. "Some women
dispense sex to their husbands the way
they dispense candy to their children."
Aggression can serve as sexual
gratification, just as sex can take an
aggressive form. "Sex can take the
form of combat. It becomes a
battleground where something other
than sexual pleasure is being
gratified."
In addition, Katchadourian stressed
the social needs fulfilled by sex, saying

that "men as well as women view sex
as a means of filling a void — of
abandoning oneself in another person
for even a short time."
"These notions of sexuality are
deeply ingrained in human nature," he
concluded. And he stressed the
importance of maintaining a balance
between sexual and non-sexual uses of
sex.
During a question-answer period
following the one-hour lecture,
Katchadourian was asked if man "will
perpetually follow his phallus." He
demonstrated the wit which makes his
class lectures so popular by replying,
"My off hand guess is likely to do so
for a while."
Katchadourian is a university fellow
and is currently preparing a course
dealing with the life cycle. Human
Sexuality, which he has taught with
Asst. Psychiatry Prof. Donald T.
Lunde, has had the largest enrollments
of any course offered at Stanford.
