# Fee Assessments
## 
### 
Legal Counseling Office
The Daily recommends a YES vote on the Stanford Legal
Counseling Office assessment. The recent Citizen's
Advocates proposal failed because it would not directly aid
the students who would be paying for it. If the SLCO
proposal is passed, it would provide advice, referral, and/or
representation for students with legal problems. Similar
programs operate successfully at DeAnza and Foothill
Colleges and it is time that this service was instituted for
Stanford students.
KZSU
The Daily recommends a YES vote on KZSU's request
for $ 1 assessment for fall and winter quarters. KZSU has
annual operating expenses of $19,000 a year, and since they
are not allowed to take advertising, they must look to the
students for support. If their assessment is not passed, the
first cutbacks will come in their news and public affairs
operations.
KZSU is the only way the campus can receive up to the
minute local news, and public service programs like "Ondas
Chicanas," "Campus Conference," "Black Air," and "Out of
the Doll House" reach a wide cross-section of the
community. KZSU deserves your support.
The Stanford Daily
The Daily recommends a YES vote on our own request
for a $1 assessment for fall quarter. Our plan for
independence, drawn up in 1971, projected a gradual
withdrawal from student and administration support while
advertising revenues were increased to take its place. Two
years ago, the Daily received four dollars in student
assessments; this year, we received two dollars; and our long
term financial plan calls for us to ask for one more dollar for
next year. Student support is then to be ended, and
University subsidies for faculty and staff subscriptions will
end in 1975. After this, the Daily will be fully financially
independent from all sectors of the University. We are
meeting our projected yearly increases in ad revenue, and
barring a sudden financial disaster, we will need no more
student support.
Stanford Band
The Daily recommends a YES vote on the Incomparable
Leland Stanford Junior University Marching Band's request
for a $1 fee assessment for both fall and winter quarters
next year.
The Band is the focal point of school spirit and represents
us to much of the country. They received two dollars two
years ago, and have used those funds to travel to Missouri
and Arkansas (and drop their pants on national television),
and to take many other trips out of the state to support the
football and basketball teams in otherwise hostile country.
We feel that the Band has managed their money responsibly
and that their out-of-state trips should be supported.
ASSU Program Fee
The Daily recommends a NO vote on the ASSU Program
Fee. Many of the organizations that would receive funds if
the Program Fee is passed indeed merit funding. But a
greater proportion of the $17,500 collected if the
assessment passes would go to groups whose appeal to more
than a few students is questionable. Essentially, we object to
these groups taking advantage of the merit and good
reputation of other organizations to get money for
themselves.
Constitutional Amendments
Voluntary Fees
The Daily recommends a NO vote on the amendment
which would make all fee assessments voluntary instead of
refundable. The amendment would theoretically enable
students to indicate on their registration forms whether they
wanted to pay individual fee assessments. However, a
mechanism for implementing this amendment has not even
been devised, and students would be ill-advised to approve a
system they would have little hand in designing. In addition,
the amendment — if passed — could mean the death of many
voluntary student organizations that depend on student
support.
The amendment needs a two-thirds majority to pass, and
would not take effect until next year. Thus, the Daily would
not be affected by this, but organizations like KZSU and the
Band could run into serious trouble. A vehicle already exists
to refund fee assessments, and by passing this amendment
students will be crippling their own organizations.
Constitutional Interpretation
The Daily recommends a YES vote on the constitutional
amendment establishing a commission to interpret the ASSU
constitution. We are reluctant to recommend the addition of
another branch to the ASSU, but an apolitical commission
could arbitrate the seemingly endless squabbles between the
Senate and the Council of Presidents and have a positive
effect on ASSU government. If passed, we hope that this
new dimension of the ASSU will function responsibly.
Presidential Veto
The Daily recommends a YES vote on the amendment
broadening the ASSU president's veto power over Senate
actions and requiring a three-fifths majority in the Senate to
override any veto. We hesitate to recommend an increase in
presidential power, but this amendment would bring the
ASSU legislative-executive relationship into line with most
other democratic systems. The ASSU may or may not
function like a normal government, but it should at least be
set up like one.
