# Sunnyvale Air Crash Kills 16
## 
### 
SUNNYVALE - At least 16 people
died yesterday when two military
airplanes collided and crashed in
flames onto the Sunnyvale Municipal
Golf Course.
Officials said a U.S. Navy P3C
Orion turboprop with six persons
aboard and a National Aeronautics and
Space Administration Convair 990 jet
with 11 aboard collided while on the
southern approach to Moffett Field in
Mountain View.
One crewman aboard the Navy
plane, Bruce N. Mallibert, 22, of
Mountain View, was thrown clear of
the wreckage. He was rushed to El
Camino Hospital in Mountain View,
where he was reported in "very
critical" condition, suffering from
multiple burns and fractures.
Hospital spokesman Steve Lafferty
told the Daily last night that a team of
doctors was operating on Mallibert, and
that no further word was expected for
several hours.
Traffic Stopped
The crash occurred shortly before 3
p.m., and sent a huge plume of smoke
into the air that was visible from miles
away. Traffic on the nearby Bayshore
Freeway (U.S. 101) was backed up for
several miles.
One eyewitness told KCBS News
she saw the two planes coming in
towards the airstrip with one in front
of the other. The front plane, she said,
seemed to suddenly pull out of its
approach, causing the other plane to
collide with it.
"They were in contact when I first
saw them, maybe 1000 feet from the
end of the runway," Ken Green,
another eyewitness, told the
Associated Press.
"As I watched them go to the
ground, they seemed to remain
hooked together. They hit the ground
and then they just burst into flames.
After that I saw an enormous column
of black smoke and I couldn't see how
anyone could have gotten out of
there," he said.
Blaze Under Control
'Fire and rescue units from
Sunnyvale, Mountain View, Moffett,
and Palo Alto responded to the crash
site. The blaze at the golf course was
brought under control more than an
hour after the crash.
Navy Cmdr. Joe Pausner, a public
information officer at Moffett, said
that the Orion normally carries a crew
of 12. There were reports it was on a
training mission when it crashed.
NASA spokesman Garth Hull told
the AP that the Convair was a flying
research laboratory which normally
carries a crew of three. However, it
was capable of carrying up to 30
scientists.
Hull said the NASA plane was on a
routine IV2 hour flight which
originated at NASA's Ames Research
Center, located at Moffett.
Horrified Motorists
The planes crashed only a few
hundred feet from the busy Bayshore
Freeway, where dozens of horrified
motorists watched the disaster.
"It looked like they were nose to
nose, to me, like something looking at
itself in a mirror," Becky Stoltenberg,
a passing motorist, told the AP.
Indications were that some golfers
were on the course when the planes
crashed. However, a golf course
spokesman said none were injured.
Marine Injured
A. U.S. Marine suffered chest
injuries during rescue operations at the
golf course. Hospital spokesman
Lafferty said he was in fair condition
last night.
A Moffett fireman was treated for
smoke inhilation and released. Two
spectators were also briefly
hospitalized, one for hysteria and the
other with what was at first suspected
to be a heart attack. Both were
released, however.
A Naval accident inquiry board has
been appointed to investigate the
cause of the crash.

SUNNYVALE - At least 16 people
died yesterday when two military
airplanes collided and crashed in
flames onto the Sunnyvale Municipal
Golf Course.
Officials said a U.S. Navy P3C
Orion turboprop with six persons
aboard and a National Aeronautics and
Space Administration Convair 990 jet
with 11 aboard collided while on the
southern approach to Moffett Field in
Mountain View.
One crewman aboard the Navy
plane, Bruce N. Mallibert, 22, of
Mountain View, was thrown clear of
the wreckage. He was rushed to El
Camino Hospital in Mountain View,
where he was reported in "very
critical" condition, suffering from
multiple burns and fractures.
Hospital spokesman Steve Lafferty
told the Daily last night that a team of
doctors was operating on Mallibert, and
that no further word was expected for
several hours.
Traffic Stopped
The crash occurred shortly before 3
p.m., and sent a huge plume of smoke
into the air that was visible from miles
away. Traffic on the nearby Bayshore
Freeway (U.S. 101) was backed up for
several miles.
One eyewitness told KCBS News
she saw the two planes coming in
towards the airstrip with one in front
of the other. The front plane, she said,
seemed to suddenly pull out of its
approach, causing the other plane to
collide with it.
"They were in contact when I first
saw them, maybe 1000 feet from the
end of the runway," Ken Green,
another eyewitness, told the
Associated Press.
"As I watched them go to the
ground, they seemed to remain
hooked together. They hit the ground
and then they just burst into flames.
After that I saw an enormous column
of black smoke and I couldn't see how
anyone could have gotten out of
there," he said.
Blaze Under Control
'Fire and rescue units from
Sunnyvale, Mountain View, Moffett,
and Palo Alto responded to the crash
site. The blaze at the golf course was
brought under control more than an
hour after the crash.
Navy Cmdr. Joe Pausner, a public
information officer at Moffett, said
that the Orion normally carries a crew
of 12. There were reports it was on a
training mission when it crashed.
NASA spokesman Garth Hull told
the AP that the Convair was a flying
research laboratory which normally
carries a crew of three. However, it
was capable of carrying up to 30
scientists.
Hull said the NASA plane was on a
routine IV2 hour flight which
originated at NASA's Ames Research
Center, located at Moffett.
Horrified Motorists
The planes crashed only a few
hundred feet from the busy Bayshore
Freeway, where dozens of horrified
motorists watched the disaster.
"It looked like they were nose to
nose, to me, like something looking at
itself in a mirror," Becky Stoltenberg,
a passing motorist, told the AP.
Indications were that some golfers
were on the course when the planes
crashed. However, a golf course
spokesman said none were injured.
Marine Injured
A. U.S. Marine suffered chest
injuries during rescue operations at the
golf course. Hospital spokesman
Lafferty said he was in fair condition
last night.
A Moffett fireman was treated for
smoke inhilation and released. Two
spectators were also briefly
hospitalized, one for hysteria and the
other with what was at first suspected
to be a heart attack. Both were
released, however.
A Naval accident inquiry board has
been appointed to investigate the
cause of the crash.
