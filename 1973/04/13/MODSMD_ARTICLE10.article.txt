This is a test. Do not be
alarmed. The words you read in
the next three minutes are only a
test of this newspaper's
Emergency Awareness
Preparedness System. In the event
of a real emergency, the editor of
this newspaper will inform you
exactly which sections of the
paper are dangerous; what follows
is only a simulation of journalistic
content judged 'dangerous'. This
is a test.
SECTION ONE
Instructions: Each passage in this
group is followed by questions
based on its content. After
reading a passage, choose the best
answer to each question and
blacken the corresponding space
on the answer sheet. Answer all
questions following a passage on
the basis of what is stated or
implied in that passage.
I. The Stanford Band, or as it is
called officially, the Incomparable
Leland Stanford Junior University
Marching Band, has been doing
quite a bit of travelling in the last
few years. Those of us who are
juniors today may well remember

our first glimpse of Stanford the
fall we entered was the nationally
televised Stanford-Arkansas game.
But the true story lay behind the
scenes. The Band was scheduled
to spend its nights on a high
school gym floor, but Arkansas
Governor Winthrop Rockefeller
himself put the Band up in a state
armory. At the game, and before
millions of TV viewers, the Band
"dropped trou" to reveal a motley
assortment of surfer jams, jock
straps, and California-tanned
derrieres.
Ignoring the next year's
Missouri game, where the Band
got into some trouble with the
police over a parade permit for
marching on the street, and
switched to marching on the
sidewalk, let us proceed directly
to the Band's special 1972 Rose
Bowl Parade in Reno, Nevada.
On the subject of Reno,
Assistant Manager (or Ass. Man. as
he is called) Norm Halleen says,
"While SC was making fools of
themselves in Pasadena last
January, we were making fools of
ourselves "hi the Biggest Little City
in the World." Manager Doug
Peterson adds, "Rumors that we
committed unnatural acts with
slot machines are entirely
fellatious . . . the machines
wanted it!"
1. The Stanford Band is called:
(A) The Incomparable LSJUMB
(B) The largest, official sports
activity music organ of the
Athletic Department
(C) Many unprintable names,
both in a derogatory and
laudatory sense
2. The only reason the City of
Reno's sign, "Biggest Little City
in the World" was not
transplanted to the Stanford Band
Shak is:
(A) The sign is actually a giant
lighted arch and wouldn't fit in
any Bandsman's car trunk
(B) It's a federal crime to

transport stolen property across
state lines, and the Band put the
sign back just as soon as they
realized that Reno was in Nevada.
(C) The Band Shak already has
a sign just like Reno's that comes
from Riverside, California.
Go, Wolverines
11. During Basketball season, the
Red Vest Band takes its share of
out of state trips as well. Zooming
northward for the Oregon games,
they milk every last drop out of
opportunities to support the team
by playing at Corvallis, then riding
a bumpy, dusty bus for hours to
get to Eugene in time for the
game there. Band eyes now look
longingly (and blood-shotedly)
toward the future: September 22,
1973 — Michigan!
Yes, our Band hopes for a
chance to confront the Band that
gave them such a hard time and
such poor news coverage in the
Detroit press during Rose Bowl
'71 practice. Unmentionable
sources high up atop the Band
Staff recently revealed the
proposed design for tee shirts
should the Band go East:
Silkscreened across the front of
each shirt would be a photograph
of the 1971 Rose Bowl
Scoreboard, depicting the score:
Stanford 13, Michigan 12.
In the words of Manager
Peterson, "Why Michigan? Well,
we hope to spread the image,
attitudes, and spirit of Stanford
students to those certain pockets
of primitivism still left in
America."
1. Bandsmen travel to 'away'
games in bizarre ways. Which of
the following ways have actually
been tried?
(A) Hijacked milktruck
(B) Hijacked banana boat
through Panama Canal and up
Mississippi River
(C) D.B. Cooper is a bandsman,
still trying to get out of his
parachute and to the Washington

State game before the halftime
show
2. The University of Michigan, as
represented by its band, is located
in a pocket of primitivism
because:
(A) The Michigan Band is the
only band that has to march with
training wheels
(B) The Michigan Band has a
challenge system through which
those on the sidelines can take the
place of Bandsmen in the ranks, if
during practice, the challengers
can beat the challengees in a
carefully supervised 'duel'
(C) The pride of the Michigan
Band is their elite corps who serve
to keep the ranks in line, the
Michigan Marching Poles.
STOP
IF YOU FINISH BEFORE TIME
IS CALLED, CHECK YOUR
WORK ON THIS SECTION
ONLY. DO NOT WORK ON ANY
OTHER SECTION IN THE TEST.
SECTION TWO
Instructions: Each of the
following statements are either
true or false, unless they are
partly true but mostly false, or are
mostly true but with a small
twinge of falsehood, or are neither
false nor true. Mark the correct
answer on your answer sheet.
1. Unlike some universities that
sent their bands on week long
airplane trips to away games for
practice and performance in the
middle of the school term,
Stanford's Band travels only to
pre-season, early Fall football
games, and then by carpools or
hitch-hiking.
2. The Stanford Band is entirely
student run, without feeling any
editorial constraint from alumni,
as is so true with other bands.
3. During important Fall games,
even the football team provides
some colorful additions to the
Band's performance.
The Big Apple
Extra credit question: To get
in touch with the band in order to
further your understanding and
appreciation of its life-style, you
should call:
(A) Dial-a-Prayer
(B) Moonlight Ranch in
upstate Nevada
(C) Stephens College, a
finishing school for unfinished
girls, adjacent to the University of
Missouri
(D) Buenos Aires
This has been a test. You are
now free to return to a normal,
mundane reading of your daily
newspaper.
(Jerry Coleman — ah, what can
one say? — purports to write a
column every Friday for this page.
It may be more than coincidental
that he lives at Theta Xi, the last
bastion of musical
quasi-primitivism west of Ann
Arbor. Mr. Coleman's first and
only attempt to master a musical
instrument ended in tragedy when
his self-playing accordion shorted
out and plunged Gary, Indiana
into total darkness.)
