# About The I-Center

ASSUMPTION: The I-Center is a place for
foreign students to get together.
FALSE ... because of the error of omission. The
I-Center is a place for foreign students to get
together, but it is a whole lot more. To dispel the
all-too-prevalentcampus myth that the Center does
not exist as well for all members of the Stanford
community interested in international activities, I
hereby put the facts straight: True, the I-Center
houses a staff providing advisory services to the
more than 1300 students from other countries
studying on our campus as well as the nearly 300
post-doctoral scholars spending blocks of time at
Stanford in research or teaching.
In addition, it offers a variety of programs to
family members of these students and scholars, and
serves as a programming center for the 600 visitors
from overseas who spend a day or more on the
Stanford campus each year. But the I-Center is also
a resource base for American students who want to
work, study or travel overseas. It is the advisory
back-up for Hammarskjold House, the co-op
residence housing students from the U.S. and other
countries. It works with Volunteers in Asia to help
prepare outbound recruits for the adjustment to a
new culture. Open 365 days a year, the 1-Center is
an international community of interests.
0.K., so what? What does all this mean to the
Stanford American Everystudent? What does it
offer you, for instance, this quarter? An outstanding
photo exhibition by Stanford's own Leo Holub;
Netta Grandstaff's film and presentation on
Pollution and its Effects on the Human Process,
result of her research here at Stanford; a
priest/educator, exiled from the Philippines,
discussing the current political oppression in that
country; Bay Area poets reading their own works
and other poems in several languages; a chance to
visit Stanford's Planning Office to see the mock-ups
and interrogate the executors of physical change on

our campus through the "Discover Stanford" series;
Mary's Thai Curry or Ann's Steak and Kidney Pie
via the weekly Sunday Suppers; a wild orgy of
Brazilian song and dance to celebrate the end of
Lent at the Brazilian students' carnival party; a
chance for weekly rap and good food over a
Luncheon Discussion Group, covering such diverse
topics as development of the cinema, politics in
Latin America, and limits to growth and technology
on this planet; Soiree Francaise, an evening
especially presented to prepare all of you soon
travelling to France for la vie francaise; a weekend
with the United Farmworkers in a Chicano
community to gain insight into the life and
problems of agricultural labor; cheap tickets to the
A.C.T. production of Ibsen's A Doll House; a
workshop on "Teaching and Other Things Abroad;"
exchange activities with Berkeley's I-House; chess
tournaments, film classics.
Apart from the special events mentioned above,
regular activities welcoming all members of the
campus include Friday Happy Hours featuring Kold
Kegs, international song and dance very Thursday
evening, and ping-pong and pool or volleyball
anytime.
Activities are also especially planned for spouses
of students, which include English classes, American
cooking courses, tennis lesfcons and a variety of
discussion meetings. We are currently recruiting
American students to help plan orientation week
.activities for newly arriving students in the fall, and
students are always welcome volunteers for
Engish-in-Action, one-tone weekly conversation
practice in English for those who need it.
The I-Center, in carrying out the desires of an
intercultural community, seeks ideas and
participation from throughout the campus. Don't
just stand there: internationalize!
