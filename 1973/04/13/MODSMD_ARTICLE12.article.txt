Fighting Tuition 'Futile'
Editor:
Eric Hemel's recent letter
(Daily, April 11) criticizes the
members of our slate for
insincerity becasue we failed to
join COST, an organization he
co-founded. We did not join his
organization for the simple reason
that we were convinced that its
approach to the problem of the
rising cost to attend Stanford was
highly unrealistic and therefore
unlikely to bring any results.
It is futile to expend one's
energy fighting tuition increases,
which are the consequence of
inflation, Nixon's cuts in
education, and the ever-rising
expense in providing high quality
education. The intelligentresponse
to tuition increases is to seek
methods of easing the burden on
students by increasing the funds
available to them to meet the
higher costs.
The members of our slate have
devoted a good deal of time
attempting to find ways to ease
the tuition burden. Our proposals
include the institution of a
University-wide loan program
similar to the Yale Plan; increasing
the board plan options available
to those living in dorms; increased
employment of students by the
University; and increasing the
involvement of students in
fundraising efforts.
These are concrete proposals
which represent a realistic
approach to easing the tuition
burden. By way of contrast,
Hemel's COST has been
noticeably ineffective, which is
not surprising, considering the
naivete of its approach to the
problem.

Faith Healing
Now that white Western
scientists have taken it upon
themselves to classify certain
groups of non-whites as
"diseased," and in need of their
expert genetic "counseling," it is
important for the critical and
sensitive observer to note some
pertinent facts.
The most salient of these facts
is that the scientists involved in
this area of genetic counseling
define man (and nature) as
basically material â€” i.e.,
non-spiritual. They therefore
invariably attribute the cause of
illness to bodily or material
malfunctioning and prescribe
remedies which focus on the
organic (as opposed to psychic)
basis of behavior. This focus is a
direct and logical outgrowth of
the materialistic philosophy which
characterizes most white western
science. This materialistic
philosophy has its roots in
nineteenth century physics. The
legacy of this out-moded,
materialistic, atheist, nineteenth
century philosophical thinkings is
reflected in the work of modern
geneticist and race intelligence
theorists.
The non-white world has never,
of course, adopted this
philosophical outlook at the
white, Western scientist. It has
long recognized the reality of the
spiritual world, and has
incorporated its essence in a
variety of areas, including voodoo,
witchcraft, acupuncture and
faith-healing. The non-white,
so-called "primitive" concept of
disease is therefore quite different
from that held by the white
western man and it is this
difference which permits the
non-white to successfully treat
organic "diseases" through
psychic means.
While it is true that some
whites (e.g., the Christian
Scientists) recognize the power of
faith healing, most white scientists
relegate such phenomena to the
area of superstition. This gives
them the intellectual justification
for labelling the non-white
believer as primitive and
unintelligent. Some have even
gone so far as to suggest that the
non-white population be curtailed
and that they be genetically
controlled so that future
generations will look and think
more like white people.
Whether this represents
misguided science or downright
evilness, is a question over which
serious observers must ponder.
