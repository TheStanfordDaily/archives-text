Do you know what organization is organizing students to write to
prisoners? If not, do you have any idea who I could write to find out?
A.B.
Call the Prison Information Center at extension 2677. The people
there are coordinating Project Inside-Out, a letter-exchange program
between students and prisoners.

Who first introduced eucalyptus trees to California, when, and
why? P.G.
Information supplied by the Botanical Garden at UC Berkeley
says:
'The first Eucalyptus seed was imported from Australia about
1870, and by 1880 they were planted in large groves as timber trees.
The most common species planted was Eucalyptus globulus but
several other species were tried. About 1890 it was learned that these
species were of no value as timber trees, leaving many nurseries with
tens of thousands of seedlings to be discarded. They were planted in
Napa, Sonoma, Marin, Contra Costa, Alameda, San Mateo and Santa
Clara counties. It is seldom that one is out of sight of large trees or
groves planted during this period.
"After about 1890 large numbers of Eucalyptus trees were planted
as windbreak for crops. In southern California they were used as
protection for citrus groves, while farther north they were used more
for protection of vegetable crops. These rows of trees are most
noticeable along Highway 101 between Salinas and King City, in
Monterey county. Also, many windbreaks were planted in the
Sacramento and San Joaquin valleys. These were mostly Eucalyptus
carnaldulensis, rudis, viminalis and others, the last one being the most
resistant against frost."

For the last two years I have been collecting our bottles and cans
and taking them to various recycling centers. They have all closed,
though, and I now have to go to the Palo Alto Dump with them. My
question is, are they actually recycled into new bottles and cans, or
am I wasting my time on this thing? I've heard conflicting opinions.
A.M.
Bottles and cans taken to the dump are not recycled. However,
there is a recycling center right outside the entrance to the dump on
Embarcadero Road. It is open Wednesday through Sunday, 8 a.m. 'til
5 p.m.
The receptionist at the Palo Alto Sanitation Comapnay said that
the items to be recycled are taken to various companies. Some of
these companies melt the bottles and cans and make them into new
ones, and other companies merely wash them out and re-use them. In
any case, the cans and bottles are recycled.
