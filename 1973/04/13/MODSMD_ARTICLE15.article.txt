# New Publication Helps Undergrads, Aids Students In Education Plans
## 
### 
A Stanford Education,
currently being drafted under the
supervision of Douglas Davis,
Assoc. Dean of Undergraduate
Studies, is a new publication
aimed at helping undergraduates
exercise the alternatives they have
in planning their education here.
According to Davis, "Students
recognize they have the freedom
but are not sure what to do with
it." He explained that although
administrators recognize the
students' role in determining their
own education and in making
their own decisions, they have
"not gone the further step in
providing students with
alternatives in choosing their
education," such as outlining
pitfalls and different things to
consider.
With A Stanford Education
Davis hopes to provide the
necessary information about what
is available to help students
determine "what they're looking
for with their education and how
they'll go after it."
The pamphlet, similar to
Approaching Stanford, will
consist of short essays by faculty,
alumni and students focusing on a
topic such as "What you should
look for in a liberal education," or
"What I got out of a liberal
education."
The publication will also cover
topics such as employment;
outlining courses students can
take and things they can do to
increase job opportunities and test
interest areas.
A Stanford Education is part
of an academic advising program
plan to ease the sophomore

connection: the period after the
freshman year when a student is
at home and settled at Stanford
and begins looking ahead.
Two years ago a program was
tried called Choosing A Major
which included department
meetings and sessions with
students and faculty. According
to Davis, "Not many students
attended."
The next effort was a written
publication also called Choosing A
Major. Although it "worked
better," said Davis, "it didn't
quite hit the mark."
Davis feels the timing of the
two efforts was off. They were
focused on a point of time in a

student's career: the sophomore
connection, whereas the period
when students are thinking about
these problems is different for
each student and not necessarily
I in the sophomore year.
With A Stanford Education
Davis is "trying to reach a braoder
j range of people."
He hopes the booklet will
stimulate discussion among
students themselves and among
students and advisors, and also
hopes it will "encourage students
to do a little more long-range
planning."

own education and in making
their own decisions, they have
"not gone the further step in
providing students with
alternatives in choosing their
education," such as outlining
pitfalls and different things to
consider.
With A Stanford Education
Davis hopes to provide the
necessary information about what
is available to help students
determine "what they're looking
for with their education and how
they'll go after it."
The pamphlet, similar to
Approaching Stanford, will
consist of short essays by faculty,
alumni and students focusing on a
topic such as "What you should
look for in a liberal education," or
"What I got out of a liberal
education."
The publication will also cover
topics such as employment;
outlining courses students can
take and things they can do to
increase job opportunities and test
interest areas.
A Stanford Education is part
of an academic advising program
plan to ease the sophomore

connection: the period after the
freshman year when a student is
at home and settled at Stanford
and begins looking ahead.
Two years ago a program was
tried called Choosing A Major
which included department
meetings and sessions with
students and faculty. According
to Davis, "Not many students
attended."
The next effort was a written
publication also called Choosing A
Major. Although it "worked
better," said Davis, "it didn't
quite hit the mark."
Davis feels the timing of the
two efforts was off. They were
focused on a point of time in a

student's career: the sophomore
connection, whereas the period
when students are thinking about
these problems is different for
each student and not necessarily
I in the sophomore year.
With A Stanford Education
Davis is "trying to reach a braoder
j range of people."
He hopes the booklet will
stimulate discussion among
students themselves and among
students and advisors, and also
hopes it will "encourage students
to do a little more long-range
planning."
He views A Stanford Education
as something a student can keep
around and refer back to
