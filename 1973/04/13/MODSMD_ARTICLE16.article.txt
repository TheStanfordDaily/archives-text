# Scouts Begin Ticket Sale
## 
### 
The annual scramble of 4,000 Stanford Area Boy Scouts to
sell tickets for their 1973 Scout-O-Rama begins Saturday with
doorbell-ringing in Palo Alto, Mountain View, Los Altos, Los
Altos Hills and Stanford.
This year's Scouting exhibition with displays and
demonstrations by every Cub Pack and Scout Troop in the
five-community area will be held a month later on Saturday, May
12, according to Scout-O-Rama Chairman, L. Farrell McGhie. The
site will be the Stanford playing fields just south of the stadium,
he said.
Daniel Kenney, Ticket Sales Chairman, noted that top
salesmen among the Cubs, Scouts, and Explorers will win prizes,
and competition to be first at residents' front doors should be
keen, as usual.
Proceeds of ticket sales are shared among all units of the
Stanford Area Council of Boy Scouts to buy equipment and
leadership training materials.
The annual Scouting show features exhibitions of such Scout
skills as bridge building, camping, rope work, campfire building
and cooking. It is the major effort of the year by Scouts and their
leaders to show the public what Scouting is all about.
