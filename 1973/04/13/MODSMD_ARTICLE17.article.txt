# Solar Magnetism Affects Weather
## 
### 
Scientists have long suspected
that the sun's changing face, as it
rotates relative to earth, has
something to do with changes in
the earth's weather.
Now a cooperative group study
at Stanford's Plasma Research
Institute, taking advantage of
modern satellite and weather
balloon observations, shows there
is a definite connection between
solar magnetism and weather in
the northern hemisphere.
Checking satellite and weather
data back to 1964 by computer,
the research group has discovered
that the sun's magnetic polarity
reverses itself about once a week.
And this tends to be accompanied
by a few days of better than
average weather.
Just what kind of natural
mechanism causes this effect is
still a matter of conjecture, says
Dr. John M. Wilcox who headed

the study. The work was
supported by the Office of Naval
Research, the National Science
Foundation, and the National
Aeronautics and Space
Administration. It is described in
the current (April 13) issue of
Science magazine.
Others in the research group
were graduate student Philip H.
Scherrer of Santa Ana; Dr. Leif
Svalgaard; Dr. Walter Orr Roberts,
well known astronomer and
president of the University Corp.
for Atmospheric Research in
Boulder, Colo.; and Dr. Roger H.
Olson, meteorologist with the
National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration's
(NOAA) Environmental Data
Service, also in Boulder.
The solar wind, which is
constantly flowing outward from
the sun in all directions, also
draws the sun's magnetic field
with it. Thus the sun's magnetism
reaches across 93 million miles to
the earth and, in fact, 20 to 50
times beyond.
The Stanford group discovered
there are four distinct magnetic
field sectors of the sun, which
turns completely around every 27
days relative to earth. In each
sector the magnetic field is
directed either away form the sun
or toward it. Thus the earth is
constantly swept by alternating
fields of solar magnetism.
A sharp division between these
sectors of magnetism can be
observed by satellite at specific
times. When these divisions were
compared with northern

hemisphere weather maps drawn
for the same time periods, it was
found that the low pressure
troughs diminished for a few days.
Since these troughs are usually
associated with rainy or stormy
weather, the areas in the vicinity
of the diminished troughs tended
to have improved weather for
three or four days.
The solar magnetism does not
appear to interact in this way with
our atmosphere until it reaches
the upper part of the troposphere
some 8-10 miles high, the research
group reported. At that height it
may affect cloud formation and
wind currents in this most
turbulent portion of the earth's
atmosphere.
Whether or not the same
effects occur in the earth's
southern hemisphere is not
known, they said, since there are
not enough observations from
that half of the globe to enable
them to study it.
