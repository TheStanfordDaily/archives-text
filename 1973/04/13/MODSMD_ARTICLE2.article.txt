# Garcia-Meyer: Other Slates Absurd
## 
### CHRISTY WISE 
"We're anarcho-surrealists," said
ASSU presidential candidate Dave
Meyer. "The whole purpose of our
campaign is to make reality relevant to
the Stanford student."
"One of the main thrusts of our
campaign," stated Robert Garcia, "is
to point out the absurdity of the other
slates."
The Garcia-Meyer campaign has
been "altered radically" according to
Garcia, since the withdrawal of Gail
Rivers and Reginald Turner.
"We feel a lot like McGovern after
Eagleton," commented Garcia.
Candidates 'Serious'
Garcia, a junior in philosophy, and
Meyer, a junior in communication, are

both currently ASSU senators. In
addition, Garcia has served on the
Student Conduct Legislative Council.
The two candidates are "serious"
about their campaign. According to
Garcia, "We wouldn't be here if we
thought we didn't have a chance." He
added, "If people were really
intelligent, they'd see that our
campaign is no more of a joke than
any of the others."
Meyer said, "We're willing to
promise anything that anyone else is —
and the chances we can deliver are
about the same."
Van Petten vs. O'Grady
Garcia and Meyer offered much
criticism of their opponents. Garcia
claimed, "Anyone who would vote for
the Van Petten slate should have his
head examined." Garcia reasoned that
since Van Petten "only takes a few
units a quarter, at that rate there's
four more years of Van Petten and his
great white weight."
The O'Grady slate, according to
Garcia and Meyer, has a "good looking

platform. They have some really good
ideas. In reality these ideas have
already been instituted by someone
else or used by someone else and
failed." Garcia cited as an example the
Consumer and Restaurant Guide,
which has been done, and "is a good
publication, but no one's used it."
Garcia concluded, "Their platform
is a motley of milk toast commitments
to plagiarize programs."
ASSU A 'Sandbox'
The claim by Judy Gans and Buzz
Thompson that the ASSU is a sandbox
and their officers are sandbox
politicians "is true," according to
Garcia. "It is equally true that an
economics or philosophy major here is
a sandbox economist or sandbox
philosopher because all of Stanford is
a sandbox, a training ground for future
reality.
"To be a Young Socialist and run
for ASSU president at Stanford," said
Garcia, "is like a ... a fish without a
bicycle," finished Meyer.
Garcia quoted Nietzsche that "it is
not by wrath that one kills, it is by
laughter." He explained, "After
reading the other people's programs
and considering what people have
done in the past, when people stop
laughing they'll vote for Garcia and
Meyer."
The Issues
Meyer, commenting on one of the
campaign issues, feels the voluntary
fee assessment is "a good idea to a
degree because when the ASSU makes
decisions on funding, it assumes the
money will be there." He explained
that on the other hand, "I can't see
anyone willingly paying a voluntary
assessment, just because of the nature
of Stanford students as I've come to
know them."
Meyer equated the voluntary fee
assessment with charity and feels that
since "Stanford students aren't really
charitable ... the refundable idea as

we have it is a good one. You'd have
to be pretty low to ask for a refund if
you use the services."
Garcia and Meyer intend to
concentrate for the most part on local
issues. Meyer said, "We don't think the
ASSU should be used as a tool to push
the politics of the presidents, which
has happened." The other extreme, he
feels, isn't acceptable either because
"you can't say the ASSU presidents
are apart from the real world with no
political or moral responsibility in
beliefs that are important."
Meyer feels special events are
"something that ASSU can do and
something that students want." He

favors presentation of musicians that
are "interesting to students" but aren't
heard commercially. He thinks there is
room for both local groups and big
name bands.
Garcia concluded that "all the
other slates are trying to serve the
wants of the people. As Beckett says,
'Quantum of wantum in the universe is
unchanging.' In other words, everyone
is always going to have more desires."
Garcia and Meyer include
themselves among the absurd slates,
claiming to be "heroes of the absurd."
Garcia explained, "We face our
absurdity whereas they try to hide
behind it."

Robert Garcia, candidates for the ASSU presidency,

to eminiate the "sandbox" atmosphere here and make
"reality relevant" to the Stanford student.
