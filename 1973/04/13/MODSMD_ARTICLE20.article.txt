# Who Has Lots Of Problems? The Ombudsman, Of Course
## 
### BRUCE KADDEN 
Established in May 1969 from
a proposal by the Committee of
Fifteen, the University
Ombudsman, is obligated "to
protect the interests and rights of
members of the Stanford
community from injustices or
abuses of discretion, from gross
inefficiency, from unnecessary
delay, and complication in
administration of university rules
and regulations, and from
inconsistency, unfairness,
unresponsiveness, and prejudice in
the individual's experience with
University activities.
"The Ombudsman exists to
receive, examine, and channel the
complaints and grievances of
members of the Stanford
community, and to secure
expeditious and impartial
redress."
Former Registrar
Harvey Hall, who previously
served as registrar here for 22
years, took over the position of
Ombudsman last fall. In two
quarters, he has handled 258 cases
from faculty, staff, students and
others in the University
community — 50 more cases than
were reported all of last year.
The range of problems Hall
receives is substantial. He insists
that no case stands out in his
mind, but believes each problem is
unique.
Some examples of the
problems he has dealt with have
to do with parking, examination

conflict, late fee payments, the
liquor law, and room rent.
What's In a Name?
One case successfully resolved
was that of a woman, "Ms. W."
who entered Stanford unmarried.
She was married before
graduating, and at that time she
changed her name to Mrs. C. She
later decided she wanted her name
of record to be changed back to
Ms. W., her professional name.
Hall placed the question on the
agenda of the committee that
handles such problems, and the
Registrar's Office eventually
wrote Ms. W, enclosing a grade
sheet with the change. They said
that they filed her permanent
record under Wand cross indexed
Wand C.
Department of Bureaucracy
Hail is also involved in
problems that affect many
students, such as bicycle traffic
and loose dogs on campus, and in
what he terms "recurring

bureaucratic problems," such as
the "front desk problem" where
students don't get past the
secretary, and "response time"
where a person's complaint
becomes bogged down.
Although Hall has been fairly
successful, not all' problems are
able to be completely resolved.
He estimated that half of the
problems are successfully handled,
in one fourth of the cases a
compromise is reached, and in the
other 25 percent of the problems
little or nothing is able to be
done.
Almost two thirds of the
problems come from students,
split evenly between graduates
and undergraduates. One fifth of
the complaints are from staff and
only six percent from faculty.
The office of the Ombudsman
is located in room 125, Memorial
Court, and Hall encourages
anyone with a problem to make
use of this service.

Ombudsman last fall. In two
quarters, he has handled 258 cases
from faculty, staff, students and
others in the University
community — 50 more cases than
were reported all of last year.
The range of problems Hall
receives is substantial. He insists
that no case stands out in his
mind, but believes each problem is
unique.
Some examples of the
problems he has dealt with have
to do with parking, examination

conflict, late fee payments, the
liquor law, and room rent.
What's In a Name?
One case successfully resolved
was that of a woman, "Ms. W."
who entered Stanford unmarried.
She was married before
graduating, and at that time she
changed her name to Mrs. C. She
later decided she wanted her name
of record to be changed back to
Ms. W., her professional name.
Hall placed the question on the
agenda of the committee that
handles such problems, and the
Registrar's Office eventually
wrote Ms. W, enclosing a grade
sheet with the change. They said
that they filed her permanent
record under Wand cross indexed
Wand C.
Department of Bureaucracy
Hail is also involved in
problems that affect many
students, such as bicycle traffic
and loose dogs on campus, and in
what he terms "recurring

bureaucratic problems," such as
the "front desk problem" where
students don't get past the
secretary, and "response time"
where a person's complaint
becomes bogged down.
Although Hall has been fairly
successful, not all' problems are
able to be completely resolved.
He estimated that half of the
problems are successfully handled,
in one fourth of the cases a
compromise is reached, and in the
other 25 percent of the problems
little or nothing is able to be
done.
Almost two thirds of the
problems come from students,
split evenly between graduates
and undergraduates. One fifth of
the complaints are from staff and
only six percent from faculty.
The office of the Ombudsman
is located in room 125, Memorial
Court, and Hall encourages
anyone with a problem to make
use of this service.

landmark had only been removed temporarily for spring cleaning and

Established in May 1969 from
a proposal by the Committee of
Fifteen, the University
Ombudsman, is obligated "to
protect the interests and rights of
members of the Stanford
community from injustices or
abuses of discretion, from gross
inefficiency, from unnecessary
delay, and complication in
administration of university rules
and regulations, and from
inconsistency, unfairness,
unresponsiveness, and prejudice in
the individual's experience with
University activities.
"The Ombudsman exists to
receive, examine, and channel the
complaints and grievances of
members of the Stanford
community, and to secure
expeditious and impartial
redress."
