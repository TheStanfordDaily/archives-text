# Bluegrass Music At Iron Works
## 
### JURGEN WOLFF 
Bluegrass music, often
underrated as merely cornpone
fare, is enjoying a new popularity
due to the success of "Dueling
Banjos," the theme song from
"Deliverance." Now Peninsula
fans (or potential fans) of this
type of music have the
opportunity to hear a fine
contemporary Bluegrass group,
the Homestead Act, Friday nights
at the Iron Works Restaurant in
Palo Alto.
The label of "contemporary"
bluegrass is carefully chosen. The

traditional Bluegrass group is
i patterned after Bill Monroe, the
i venerable "Father of Bluegrass,"
r whose groups have spawned Earl
> Scruggs, Mac Wiseman and other
i! country greats.
i The standard operating
5 procedure for purist groups is to
; strike a statue-like pose and start
> playing. To move or in any way
, acknowledge the presence of the
> audience is to admit failure. This
i is all very unlike the modus
operandi of the Homestead Act,
' who enjoy entertaining and don't
; mind sharing that feeling with the

audience.
Their repertoire, while
including a good number of
traditional Bluegrass songs, also
ranges to country, folk, and
popular songs — anything from
"Bugle Call Rag," to "With Love
From Someone," to an excellent
banjo adaptation of "Classical
Gas" and, yes, to "Dueling
Banjos."
Original Sound
"If Bluegrass doesn't go
beyond the traditional songs, it'll
die along with Bill Monroe," notes
Elmo Shropshire, who picks the

banjo, plays the guitar, and does
most of the talking for the
Homestead Act. "Also, to exist
professionally in this area, and to
really be satisfied with yourselves
as musicians, you have to create
your own sound. This is what
we're moving toward."
To record these words on
paper is not to do them justice,
for in person they are delivered in
a Kentucky twang cuttable with a
knife. This unaffected accent
(Elmo was raised on a tobacco
farm near Lexington), combined
with Elmo's energetic and totally
guileless manner, sets the tone for
the group's friendly character.
John Hedgecoth (alias Virgil
Sniffen) is perhaps the most
accomplished musician of the
group, with a background as a
studio musician and music
teacher. He holds forth on guitar,
mandolin, violin and banjo, all of
which he mastered after a slow
start as tuba player for his high
school marching band (it will do
you no good, however, to request
"Dueling Tubas").
Elmo may be the more vocal
male member of the group, but
Virgil does create his own brand
of excitement, as evidenced by
last Friday's performance, in
which a young lady, moved to

ecstacy as Virgil fiddled "The
Orange Blossom Special," ran up
to the stage and grabbed his
knees. He didn't miss a note, but
does prefer simple applause.
Developed Style
Patsy Trigg (Magnolia Blossom)
sings, plays lead and rhythm
guitar and bass, while Lynn Hanes
(Fanny Mae) sings and plays
rhythm guitar and base. Magnolia
Blossom hails from Fayetteville,
Tennessee, and provides a strong
country sound on her vocals,
developed in her years of touring
with her siblings in a group known
as "The Trigg Kids." Fanny Mae's
more delicate sound serves the
group well in their folk numbers.
The Homestead Act has one
album, entitled "Gospel Snake."
Although they occasionally
perform novelty songs, their latest
single release is a serious ballad of
unrequited love, "You Done
Sprayed My Lovebug With
D.D.T."
For at least the remainder of
the month, the Homestead Act
may be heard Friday nights,
starting at 9 p.m., at the Iron
Works Restaurant. There is no
cover or minimum charge. The
Iron Works is at 3877 EI Camino
in Palo Alto, in the shadow of the
Jack-in-the-Box.
