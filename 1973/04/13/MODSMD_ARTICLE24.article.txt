# 'Scarecrow' Proves Shallow
## 
### ROBERT SHERWOOD 
Directed by: Jerry Schatzberg
Written by: Gary Michael White
A contrived plot and lack of character
depth hamper the performances of the stars of
"Scarecrow," Gene Hackman and A 1 Pacino.
Hackman, recipient of an Academy Award for
his performancy in "The French Connection,"
plays Max Millan, a "mean son of a bitch"
ex-inmate of San Quentin who is on his way
to Pittsburg to set up a car wash.
While hitchhiking he meets up with Francis
Delbuchi (A 1 Pacino), a simple,
happy-go-lucky type just out of the Merchant
Marine. Francis is hoping to reach Detroit so
that he can see his five-year-old child for the
first time.
Francis immediately befriends Max for
some unapparent reason and is soon drawn
into his car-wash fantasy. Together, they hop
freights, do odd jobs and live on the bum in
skid-row hotels. The story is about their never
making it to Pittsburg.
Early on, Francis reveals his simple
philosophy to Max. A scarecrow does not
frighten the birds, he explains, it makes them
laugh at the farmer so much they do not eat
his crops. The movie can also be seen as Max's
conversionfrom belligerent to scarecrow.
Impromptu Visit
In Denver they drop in on a divorcee friend

of Max's who now has a partner in the junk
business, Frenchie. As suggested by her name,
Frenchie is a giggly sexual stereotype who
burns the dinner and makes lusty love with
Max. At their farewell dinner, Max starts a
brawl over her, and he and Francis end up in
the county jail for a month.
Released, they continue on to Detroit
where Francis summons up the courage to call
his wife. She is shocked that he has called
after all this time and lies to him, saying the
child was never born. Later in a fountain,
Francis is struck by a sudden seizure and falls
into the water. The next scene opens in a
hospital as a physician pronounces Francis to
be catatonic and has him committed to a state
mental institution.
Max's character is never fully delineated in
the film, leaving Hackman to improvise a sort
of self-assured and dumbly sympathetic
figure.
Similar Performance
A 1 Pacino's performance mirrors that of
Duston Hoffman in "The Graduate." Francis
is comic and unsophisticated; he is "just a
kid," as Max puts it. From the offset he
attaches himself with a childlike devotion to
Max, who seems able to give him a direction
and a goal — partnership in the mythic car
wash.
"Scarecrow's" cinematography, under the

direction of Vilmos Zsigmond, is purposeful
and well conceived. One gets a clear sense of
the geography for those on the bum in
America — freight yards, back lots, rundown
hotel rooms, busy city streets, desolate
country roads.
Candid telephoto shots isolate the two
companions amid real city backdrops. The
pace of the film is well served by short
montage sequences of the travel and odd jobs
the pair engage in.
One gets the sense that this is yet another
Hollywood effort at "relevant" filmmaking,
addressed to contemporary life styles in
America. In the vein of "Save The Tiger,"
screenwriter Gary Michael White contrives
character and situation to suit a rather prosaic
statement.
America is built on its "making it big"
fantasies and on its little characters who are
lost or mislaid in the scuffle. White runs the
"scarecrow" theme into the ground, however,
when he has Max decide to place a scarecrow
outside his dream car wash.
The trite level of metaphor that his film
deals with is best exemplified by Max's
discovery that a once hospitable hobo village
has been replaced by an industrial smelter.
Despite its two capable stars, "Scarecrow"
lacks enough dramatic substance to do very
well at the box office.
