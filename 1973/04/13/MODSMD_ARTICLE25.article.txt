# 'Charlotte's Web': Movie Of Hope
## 
### JON R. KENNEDY 
"Charlotte's Web" comes at a
time when courses on dying and
accepting death are being offered
at schools around the country,
and in that context it ought to be
of wider interest and impact than
just another children's film. It is
basically a story of hope, in the
face of inevitable death, based on
an optimistic and romantic
philosophy of life.
Although the New Yorker's
Pauline Kael fell asleep at her
screening of it, I didn't see any
children or their parents, dozing
at the screening in Stonestown.
My own three-and-a-half-year-old
loved it.
The Paramount release created
by animators Hanna and Barbera
from the E.B. White classic story
has many heavy lessons for
children. The tale of a spider who
saves the life of a barnyard pig by
working miracles for him in her
web is simple and colorful. It
makes statements about
friendship, life's purpose, the fact
of death, self-sacrifice, and love
which put it cuts above what
children often get from the
entertainment industry and makes
it worth their seeing.
Religious Theme
The film's release in time for

the Easter holiday show crowd,
along with its teachings on life
and death, attract attention to its
overtly religious theme. Although
Christians might feel uneasy with
its popular humanist statement on
life's purpose and death's
meaning, leaving off any concept
of bodily resurrection, a case
could be made that since it is an
animal tale the "humanist"
interpretation can be taken or
left.
After all, even though we are
told Christ's death provided hope
for the whole creation, the
animals as well as humanity, there
is no express biblical evidence that
animals will experience a bodily
resurrection; theologians are
divided on the question, and even
if animals are to be raised, there is
no reason to beleive they know
anything about it or are expected
to have a conscious faith in such a
prospect.
The prevalence today of such
an overt humanizing of the animal
world and animal conscience as
"Jonathan Livingston Seagull," in
which a Messianic gull teaches a
doctrine of immortality clearly
contradictory to that taught in
the Apostles' Creed, is likely to
make Christians defensive. But
children old enough to understand

any of what "Charlotte's Webb" is
saying about life and death should
have no trouble understanding a
few words of clarification,
reconciling the Creed's teaching
for humanity with tb f ilm's
concepts of why animals live and
what happens to them in death.
Good Portrayal
There is much information in
the film even for children who

aren't old enough to sort out its
more philosophic points. Farmlife
is portrayed at least as well as it is
generally depicted in books for
children. The ecological value of
spiders, and even rats, is studied.
The balance of nature is a theme
which not only touches how
death can be explained, but how
life can be sustained. There is a
captivating musical score
complimenting the full-length
animated feature, and some clever
fantasy sequences making it
delightful for any child able to tell
the difference between pigs and
chickens.

The poignant story is that of a
piglet, the runt of a litter, who
survives only through the care of a
foster "mother," a farm girl who
refuses to let her father destroy it
at birth. The pig, "Wilbur," is
taken from its home to grow up
on the farm of the girl's uncle
after it is six weeks old. At the
new farm it learns to talk with the
other animals and soon discovers

what the lot of a pig is: looking
forward to the meat packing plant
after a season of getting fat.
Sickening Thought
Being made alive by the little
girl's tender love and care, Wilbur
is sickened by the thought of an
untimely demise, and appeals to
his friends to help him escape.

Charlotte, a spider who lives over
the door to his pen, promises to
save him, without knowing how.
She later decides to do so by
attracting attention to Wilbur,
making him seem an unusual pig,
by spinning "some pig" in her
web for all to see. Wilbur does
receive a lot of attention, and
after "terrific," "radiant," and
"humble" are added to his
plaudits, his owners decide that he
should be allowed to live until his
natural days are up.
What Wilbur doesn't know,
however, is that Charlotte's
lifespan is much shorter than his
own, and after her final
word-spinning she dies, leaving
behind only a sack full of eggs
which Wilbur nurtures to life next
season. Death and its sadness
touches every life, but life
inevitably goes on; that is the
unmistakeable point of the
picture.

Religious Theme
The film's release in time for

the Easter holiday show crowd,
along with its teachings on life
and death, attract attention to its
overtly religious theme. Although
Christians might feel uneasy with
its popular humanist statement on
life's purpose and death's
meaning, leaving off any concept
of bodily resurrection, a case
could be made that since it is an
animal tale the "humanist"
interpretation can be taken or
left.
After all, even though we are
told Christ's death provided hope
for the whole creation, the
animals as well as humanity, there
is no express biblical evidence that
animals will experience a bodily
resurrection; theologians are
divided on the question, and even
if animals are to be raised, there is
no reason to beleive they know
anything about it or are expected
to have a conscious faith in such a
prospect.
The prevalence today of such
an overt humanizing of the animal
world and animal conscience as
"Jonathan Livingston Seagull," in
which a Messianic gull teaches a
doctrine of immortality clearly
contradictory to that taught in
the Apostles' Creed, is likely to
make Christians defensive. But
children old enough to understand

any of what "Charlotte's Webb" is
saying about life and death should
have no trouble understanding a
few words of clarification,
reconciling the Creed's teaching
for humanity with tb f ilm's
concepts of why animals live and
what happens to them in death.
Good Portrayal
There is much information in
the film even for children who

aren't old enough to sort out its
more philosophic points. Farmlife
is portrayed at least as well as it is
generally depicted in books for
children. The ecological value of
spiders, and even rats, is studied.
The balance of nature is a theme
which not only touches how
death can be explained, but how
life can be sustained. There is a
captivating musical score
complimenting the full-length
animated feature, and some clever
fantasy sequences making it
delightful for any child able to tell
the difference between pigs and
chickens.

The poignant story is that of a
piglet, the runt of a litter, who
survives only through the care of a
foster "mother," a farm girl who
refuses to let her father destroy it
at birth. The pig, "Wilbur," is
taken from its home to grow up
on the farm of the girl's uncle
after it is six weeks old. At the
new farm it learns to talk with the
other animals and soon discovers

what the lot of a pig is: looking
forward to the meat packing plant
after a season of getting fat.
Sickening Thought
Being made alive by the little
girl's tender love and care, Wilbur
is sickened by the thought of an
untimely demise, and appeals to
his friends to help him escape.

Charlotte, a spider who lives over
the door to his pen, promises to
save him, without knowing how.
She later decides to do so by
attracting attention to Wilbur,
making him seem an unusual pig,
by spinning "some pig" in her
web for all to see. Wilbur does
receive a lot of attention, and
after "terrific," "radiant," and
"humble" are added to his
plaudits, his owners decide that he
should be allowed to live until his
natural days are up.
What Wilbur doesn't know,
however, is that Charlotte's
lifespan is much shorter than his
own, and after her final
word-spinning she dies, leaving
behind only a sack full of eggs
which Wilbur nurtures to life next
season. Death and its sadness
touches every life, but life
inevitably goes on; that is the
unmistakeable point of the
picture.

SPECIAL MESSAGE—Charlotte the spider has weaved a special
message for her friend Wilbur the pig and gosling Geoffrey in
Paramount Pictures' "Charlotte's Web," the animated musical film
based on E.B. White's contemporary classic. For a review of the
movie, see article at right.
"Charlotte's Web" comes at a
time when courses on dying and
accepting death are being offered
at schools around the country,
and in that context it ought to be
of wider interest and impact than
just another children's film. It is
basically a story of hope, in the
face of inevitable death, based on
an optimistic and romantic
philosophy of life.
Although the New Yorker's
Pauline Kael fell asleep at her
screening of it, I didn't see any
children or their parents, dozing
at the screening in Stonestown.
My own three-and-a-half-year-old
loved it.
The Paramount release created
by animators Hanna and Barbera
from the E.B. White classic story
has many heavy lessons for
children. The tale of a spider who
saves the life of a barnyard pig by
working miracles for him in her
web is simple and colorful. It
makes statements about
friendship, life's purpose, the fact
of death, self-sacrifice, and love
which put it cuts above what
children often get from the
entertainment industry and makes
it worth their seeing.

children old enough to understand

any of what "Charlotte's Webb" is
saying about life and death should
have no trouble understanding a
few words of clarification,
reconciling the Creed's teaching
for humanity with tb f ilm's
concepts of why animals live and
what happens to them in death.
Good Portrayal
There is much information in
the film even for children who

aren't old enough to sort out its
more philosophic points. Farmlife
is portrayed at least as well as it is
generally depicted in books for
children. The ecological value of
spiders, and even rats, is studied.
The balance of nature is a theme
which not only touches how
death can be explained, but how
life can be sustained. There is a
captivating musical score
complimenting the full-length
animated feature, and some clever
fantasy sequences making it
delightful for any child able to tell
the difference between pigs and
chickens.

The poignant story is that of a
piglet, the runt of a litter, who
survives only through the care of a
foster "mother," a farm girl who
refuses to let her father destroy it
at birth. The pig, "Wilbur," is
taken from its home to grow up
on the farm of the girl's uncle
after it is six weeks old. At the
new farm it learns to talk with the
other animals and soon discovers

what the lot of a pig is: looking
forward to the meat packing plant
after a season of getting fat.
Sickening Thought
Being made alive by the little
girl's tender love and care, Wilbur
is sickened by the thought of an
untimely demise, and appeals to
his friends to help him escape.

Charlotte, a spider who lives over
the door to his pen, promises to
save him, without knowing how.
She later decides to do so by
attracting attention to Wilbur,
making him seem an unusual pig,
by spinning "some pig" in her
web for all to see. Wilbur does
receive a lot of attention, and
after "terrific," "radiant," and
"humble" are added to his
plaudits, his owners decide that he
should be allowed to live until his
natural days are up.
What Wilbur doesn't know,
however, is that Charlotte's
lifespan is much shorter than his
own, and after her final
word-spinning she dies, leaving
behind only a sack full of eggs
which Wilbur nurtures to life next
season. Death and its sadness
touches every life, but life
inevitably goes on; that is the
unmistakeable point of the
picture.

SPECIAL MESSAGE—Charlotte the spider has weaved a special
message for her friend Wilbur the pig and gosling Geoffrey in
Paramount Pictures' "Charlotte's Web," the animated musical film
based on E.B. White's contemporary classic. For a review of the
movie, see article at right.
"Charlotte's Web" comes at a
time when courses on dying and
accepting death are being offered
at schools around the country,
and in that context it ought to be
of wider interest and impact than
just another children's film. It is
basically a story of hope, in the
face of inevitable death, based on
an optimistic and romantic
philosophy of life.
Although the New Yorker's
Pauline Kael fell asleep at her
screening of it, I didn't see any
children or their parents, dozing
at the screening in Stonestown.
My own three-and-a-half-year-old
loved it.
The Paramount release created
by animators Hanna and Barbera
from the E.B. White classic story
has many heavy lessons for
children. The tale of a spider who
saves the life of a barnyard pig by
working miracles for him in her
web is simple and colorful. It
makes statements about
friendship, life's purpose, the fact
of death, self-sacrifice, and love
which put it cuts above what
children often get from the
entertainment industry and makes
it worth their seeing.
Religious Theme
The film's release in time for

the Easter holiday show crowd,
along with its teachings on life
and death, attract attention to its
overtly religious theme. Although
Christians might feel uneasy with
its popular humanist statement on
life's purpose and death's
meaning, leaving off any concept
of bodily resurrection, a case
could be made that since it is an
animal tale the "humanist"
interpretation can be taken or
left.
After all, even though we are
told Christ's death provided hope
for the whole creation, the
animals as well as humanity, there
is no express biblical evidence that
animals will experience a bodily
resurrection; theologians are
divided on the question, and even
if animals are to be raised, there is
no reason to beleive they know
anything about it or are expected
to have a conscious faith in such a
prospect.
The prevalence today of such
an overt humanizing of the animal
world and animal conscience as
"Jonathan Livingston Seagull," in
which a Messianic gull teaches a
doctrine of immortality clearly
contradictory to that taught in
the Apostles' Creed, is likely to
make Christians defensive. But
children old enough to understand

any of what "Charlotte's Webb" is
saying about life and death should
have no trouble understanding a
few words of clarification,
reconciling the Creed's teaching
for humanity with tb f ilm's
concepts of why animals live and
what happens to them in death.
