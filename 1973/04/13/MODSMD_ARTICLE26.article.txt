# Posada Works Displayed At Stanford Gallery
## 
### JOHN LOOMIS 
"Posada taught me the
connection between life and art —
that you cannot paint what you
do not feel." This statement was
made by the great Mexican artist
Diego Rivera. Actually Posada can
be considered the mentor of not
only Rivera, but of every
succeeding artist in Mexico down
to today. A show of his works will
be on display at the Stanford Art
Gallery until April 29.
Posada's "connection between
life and art" is more than evident
in the exhibit. We are too often
subjected to the stereotype of the
artist in the service of a grand
patron, creating works within the
context of a refined, elite, society.
Or on the other hand we have
the stereotype of the artist as a
rebel fighting against convention
but yet appealing to another
sophisticated, though
revolutionary, intelligensia.
However, for Posada as well as for

the French artist Daumier, art was
a form primarily of —
communication, social and
political. It is in this context that
Posada reflects so much of the
popular culture of his time in
Mexico.
Jose Guadalupe Posada, born
February 18, 1852, is often called
"the artist of the Mexican people" ,
and has been credited with
creating a true national
consciousness on a popular level.
His medium was naturally the
press. By the 1890's he had
become the chief artist for
Antonio Vanegas Arroyo, the
publisher of popular journals
throughout Mexico. Posada
designed the covers and often
other illustrations. The events he
illustrated were all sensational —
murders, executions, miracles.
There are engravings of bizarre
subjects such as a woman who
gave birth to three babies and four
lizards, a man who decapitated his

daughter, and another who
devoured his son. Almost all of
Posada's works have a large
amount of shock value. However,
he also portrays the soul of
proletariat Mexico of the late
nineteenth century, and his works
are visual documents of the
journal's street literature.

Also on view are some covers
of popular songbooks and various
other engravings and lithographs
of Posada. They too reflect
contemporary life but are a bit
more sedate than the vigorous
engravings for the journals.
The Posada exhibit is unique as
art exhibitions go and presents

aspects of Mexican art and culture
of which we Americans are
unfortunately too unaware. The
exhibit will remain at the
Stanford Art Gallery across from
History Corner until April 29. The
hours are: Tues. - Fri., 10-5 and
Sat. - Sun. 1-5. The Gallery is
closed on Monday.

only Rivera, but of every
succeeding artist in Mexico down
to today. A show of his works will
be on display at the Stanford Art
Gallery until April 29.
Posada's "connection between
life and art" is more than evident
in the exhibit. We are too often
subjected to the stereotype of the
artist in the service of a grand
patron, creating works within the
context of a refined, elite, society.
Or on the other hand we have
the stereotype of the artist as a
rebel fighting against convention
but yet appealing to another
sophisticated, though
revolutionary, intelligensia.
However, for Posada as well as for

the French artist Daumier, art was
a form primarily of —
communication, social and
political. It is in this context that
Posada reflects so much of the
popular culture of his time in
Mexico.
Jose Guadalupe Posada, born
February 18, 1852, is often called
"the artist of the Mexican people" ,
and has been credited with
creating a true national
consciousness on a popular level.
His medium was naturally the
press. By the 1890's he had
become the chief artist for
Antonio Vanegas Arroyo, the
publisher of popular journals
throughout Mexico. Posada
designed the covers and often
other illustrations. The events he
illustrated were all sensational —
murders, executions, miracles.
There are engravings of bizarre
subjects such as a woman who
gave birth to three babies and four
lizards, a man who decapitated his

daughter, and another who
devoured his son. Almost all of
Posada's works have a large
amount of shock value. However,
he also portrays the soul of
proletariat Mexico of the late
nineteenth century, and his works
are visual documents of the
journal's street literature.

Also on view are some covers
of popular songbooks and various
other engravings and lithographs
of Posada. They too reflect
contemporary life but are a bit
more sedate than the vigorous
engravings for the journals.
The Posada exhibit is unique as
art exhibitions go and presents

aspects of Mexican art and culture
of which we Americans are
unfortunately too unaware. The
exhibit will remain at the
Stanford Art Gallery across from
History Corner until April 29. The
hours are: Tues. - Fri., 10-5 and
Sat. - Sun. 1-5. The Gallery is
closed on Monday.
"Posada taught me the
connection between life and art —
that you cannot paint what you
do not feel." This statement was
made by the great Mexican artist
Diego Rivera. Actually Posada can
be considered the mentor of not
only Rivera, but of every
succeeding artist in Mexico down
to today. A show of his works will
be on display at the Stanford Art
Gallery until April 29.
