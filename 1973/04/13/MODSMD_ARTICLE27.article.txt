# Three Game Series Against VSC
## Cards Host National Champions 
### SCOTT DAILEY 
Hitting the long ball at last, the
Cardinals take their young look
onto the field this afternoon at
2:30 p.m. against the top-ranked
Southern Cal Trojans in the first
game of a three-game set at
Sunken Diamond. The Cards will
meet SC again tomorrow in a
noon doubleheader.
Stanford raked opposing
pitchers for seven home runs in
three games earlier this week after
hitting only 10 in the first 31
games of the season. Dave Baker,
a freshman whose torrid bat and
killer attitude have won him the
starting job at catcher, cracked his
third home run in three days in
yesterday's 11-3 shellacking of UC
DAvis. Baker lashed back-to-back
homers in the Cards' 7-0 win over
USF on Monday.
Tuesday, Mike Higgins and
Steve Davis crashed home runs in
a 7-2 romp over San Jose State at
San Jose Municipal Stadium, and
Mark Lucich also cleared the
fences yesterday against UC Davis.
'The leadership of freshmen
Baker at catcher, Steve Davis at
shortstop, and Bruce Robinson in
the outfield right now is a
a very big factor," said Coach Ray
Young.
Keeps Team Alive
"Baker is just a very outgoing
individual and keeps the ballclub

alive vocally. Davis has been doing
a great job defensively and with
the bat and Robinson has been
doing a very good job.
"Davis makes every play and
gets the hits. Those three kids
have just picked us up," said an
elated Young, who had lamented
less than a week ago that the
veterans on the ballclub had "died
on the vine with the bat."
While Baker, Davis and
Robinson, who have a combined
batting average of .362 since being
brought up from the frosh-soph
team last month, have been
sparking Stanford on a three-game
win spree, USC has been slipping.
Tuesday, UC Irvine shut out the
Trojans, 5-0 on three hits, the first
time a USC team has been shut
out in 64 games.
The loss was Southern Cal's
sixth in 33 starts. Stanford's three
wins this week brought the Cards'
collegiate record to 21-10
(Stanford also has three
non-collegiate wins.)
Impressive ERA
The Trojans' 27-6 record is far
from unimpressive, however. Even
harder to overlook is the Southern
Cal pitching staff's combined
ERA of 1.32, tops in the Pac-8.
Russ McQueen, Southern Cal's
number one starter, has compiled
a 2-0 record and an 0.60 ERAiivn v
his two Pac-8 outings. McQueen is
a certain bet to start against
Stanford, as is Randy Scarbery,
who is also 2-0 with a 1.29 ERA.
Scarbery is fifth in the Pac-8 stats

and McQueen is third behind
UCLA's Bill Thomas and Stanford
reliever Nick Peterson, each of
whom have yet to yield an earned
run in conference play.
It will be Dan Shaw who will
run to the mound this afternoon
for the Cardinals. Shaw, with
Stanford's only conference win, is
tied for ninth in the Pac-8 with
teammate Bob DiPietro, both
sporting 2.57 ERA's. DiPietro will
start the first game on Saturday
and freshman Ken Grolle will face

Troy in the second contest.
Stanford's pitching will be up
against some formidable bats this
weekend. Daryl Arenstein, SC's
slugging first baseman, leads the
conference in home runs with
three in just four games.
Arenstein's batting average of
.538 trails that of teammate Rich
Bauer, who is whacking the ball at
an even .600.
If Stanford's freshmen can
continue pounding the ball this
weekend, things could look good
for the Cardinals' baseball hopes.
Young is looking for a series
sweep that would rocket
Stanford's record to 4-2 and vault
the Cards into first place, a
half-game ahead of the Trojans,
who are now unbeaten in five
conference games.
"We're ready now ... I think. I
hope. I just sense that some of the
things that have gone against us
are going to turn around. You've
just got to believe after these
three wins that we're going to
bust out a bit. There's no reason
why we just can't go out and do a
helluva a job."

READY FOR THE TROJANS — Third basemen Kim Hannaford, shown here lashing a line drive against
USF Monday, will start in the hot corner this afternoon when Stanford meets USC in the first game of a
crucial Pacific Eight baseball series. The Trojans currently lead the Pac-8 Southern Division with a 5-0
record while the Cards have a 1-2 mark. USC has won the NCAA title the last three years, and the Trojans
are ranked number one in the nation again in 1973.

Trojans, 5-0 on three hits, the first
time a USC team has been shut
out in 64 games.
The loss was Southern Cal's
sixth in 33 starts. Stanford's three
wins this week brought the Cards'
collegiate record to 21-10
(Stanford also has three
non-collegiate wins.)
Impressive ERA
The Trojans' 27-6 record is far
from unimpressive, however. Even
harder to overlook is the Southern
Cal pitching staff's combined
ERA of 1.32, tops in the Pac-8.
Russ McQueen, Southern Cal's
number one starter, has compiled
a 2-0 record and an 0.60 ERAiivn v
his two Pac-8 outings. McQueen is
a certain bet to start against
Stanford, as is Randy Scarbery,
who is also 2-0 with a 1.29 ERA.
Scarbery is fifth in the Pac-8 stats

and McQueen is third behind
UCLA's Bill Thomas and Stanford
reliever Nick Peterson, each of
whom have yet to yield an earned
run in conference play.
It will be Dan Shaw who will
run to the mound this afternoon
for the Cardinals. Shaw, with
Stanford's only conference win, is
tied for ninth in the Pac-8 with
teammate Bob DiPietro, both
sporting 2.57 ERA's. DiPietro will
start the first game on Saturday
and freshman Ken Grolle will face

Troy in the second contest.
Stanford's pitching will be up
against some formidable bats this
weekend. Daryl Arenstein, SC's
slugging first baseman, leads the
conference in home runs with
three in just four games.
Arenstein's batting average of
.538 trails that of teammate Rich
Bauer, who is whacking the ball at
an even .600.
If Stanford's freshmen can
continue pounding the ball this
weekend, things could look good
for the Cardinals' baseball hopes.
Young is looking for a series
sweep that would rocket
Stanford's record to 4-2 and vault
the Cards into first place, a
half-game ahead of the Trojans,
who are now unbeaten in five
conference games.
"We're ready now ... I think. I
hope. I just sense that some of the
things that have gone against us
are going to turn around. You've
just got to believe after these
three wins that we're going to
bust out a bit. There's no reason
why we just can't go out and do a
helluva a job."

READY FOR THE TROJANS — Third basemen Kim Hannaford, shown here lashing a line drive against
USF Monday, will start in the hot corner this afternoon when Stanford meets USC in the first game of a
crucial Pacific Eight baseball series. The Trojans currently lead the Pac-8 Southern Division with a 5-0
record while the Cards have a 1-2 mark. USC has won the NCAA title the last three years, and the Trojans
are ranked number one in the nation again in 1973.
Hitting the long ball at last, the
Cardinals take their young look
onto the field this afternoon at
2:30 p.m. against the top-ranked
Southern Cal Trojans in the first
game of a three-game set at
Sunken Diamond. The Cards will
meet SC again tomorrow in a
noon doubleheader.
Stanford raked opposing
pitchers for seven home runs in
three games earlier this week after
hitting only 10 in the first 31
games of the season. Dave Baker,
a freshman whose torrid bat and
killer attitude have won him the
starting job at catcher, cracked his
third home run in three days in
yesterday's 11-3 shellacking of UC
DAvis. Baker lashed back-to-back
homers in the Cards' 7-0 win over
USF on Monday.
Tuesday, Mike Higgins and
Steve Davis crashed home runs in
a 7-2 romp over San Jose State at
San Jose Municipal Stadium, and
Mark Lucich also cleared the
fences yesterday against UC Davis.
'The leadership of freshmen
Baker at catcher, Steve Davis at
shortstop, and Bruce Robinson in
the outfield right now is a
a very big factor," said Coach Ray
Young.
Keeps Team Alive
"Baker is just a very outgoing
individual and keeps the ballclub

alive vocally. Davis has been doing
a great job defensively and with
the bat and Robinson has been
doing a very good job.
"Davis makes every play and
gets the hits. Those three kids
have just picked us up," said an
elated Young, who had lamented
less than a week ago that the
veterans on the ballclub had "died
on the vine with the bat."
While Baker, Davis and
Robinson, who have a combined
batting average of .362 since being
brought up from the frosh-soph
team last month, have been
sparking Stanford on a three-game
win spree, USC has been slipping.

sweep that would rocket
Stanford's record to 4-2 and vault
the Cards into first place, a
half-game ahead of the Trojans,

conference games.

hope. I just sense that some of the
things that have gone against us

just got to believe after these
three wins that we're going to

why we just can't go out and do a
helluva a job."

READY FOR THE TROJANS — Third basemen Kim Hannaford, shown here lashing a line drive against
USF Monday, will start in the hot corner this afternoon when Stanford meets USC in the first game of a
crucial Pacific Eight baseball series. The Trojans currently lead the Pac-8 Southern Division with a 5-0
record while the Cards have a 1-2 mark. USC has won the NCAA title the last three years, and the Trojans
are ranked number one in the nation again in 1973.
Hitting the long ball at last, the
Cardinals take their young look
onto the field this afternoon at
2:30 p.m. against the top-ranked
Southern Cal Trojans in the first
game of a three-game set at
Sunken Diamond. The Cards will
meet SC again tomorrow in a
noon doubleheader.
Stanford raked opposing
pitchers for seven home runs in
three games earlier this week after
hitting only 10 in the first 31
games of the season. Dave Baker,
a freshman whose torrid bat and
killer attitude have won him the
starting job at catcher, cracked his
third home run in three days in
yesterday's 11-3 shellacking of UC
DAvis. Baker lashed back-to-back
homers in the Cards' 7-0 win over
USF on Monday.
Tuesday, Mike Higgins and
Steve Davis crashed home runs in
a 7-2 romp over San Jose State at
San Jose Municipal Stadium, and
Mark Lucich also cleared the
fences yesterday against UC Davis.
'The leadership of freshmen
Baker at catcher, Steve Davis at
shortstop, and Bruce Robinson in
the outfield right now is a
a very big factor," said Coach Ray
Young.
Keeps Team Alive
"Baker is just a very outgoing
individual and keeps the ballclub

alive vocally. Davis has been doing
a great job defensively and with
the bat and Robinson has been
doing a very good job.
"Davis makes every play and
gets the hits. Those three kids
have just picked us up," said an
elated Young, who had lamented
less than a week ago that the
veterans on the ballclub had "died
on the vine with the bat."
While Baker, Davis and
Robinson, who have a combined
batting average of .362 since being
brought up from the frosh-soph
team last month, have been
sparking Stanford on a three-game
win spree, USC has been slipping.
Tuesday, UC Irvine shut out the
Trojans, 5-0 on three hits, the first
time a USC team has been shut
out in 64 games.
The loss was Southern Cal's
sixth in 33 starts. Stanford's three
wins this week brought the Cards'
collegiate record to 21-10
(Stanford also has three
non-collegiate wins.)
Impressive ERA
The Trojans' 27-6 record is far
from unimpressive, however. Even
harder to overlook is the Southern
Cal pitching staff's combined
ERA of 1.32, tops in the Pac-8.
Russ McQueen, Southern Cal's
number one starter, has compiled
a 2-0 record and an 0.60 ERAiivn v
his two Pac-8 outings. McQueen is
a certain bet to start against
Stanford, as is Randy Scarbery,
who is also 2-0 with a 1.29 ERA.
Scarbery is fifth in the Pac-8 stats

and McQueen is third behind
UCLA's Bill Thomas and Stanford
reliever Nick Peterson, each of
whom have yet to yield an earned
run in conference play.
It will be Dan Shaw who will
run to the mound this afternoon
for the Cardinals. Shaw, with
Stanford's only conference win, is
tied for ninth in the Pac-8 with
teammate Bob DiPietro, both
sporting 2.57 ERA's. DiPietro will
start the first game on Saturday
and freshman Ken Grolle will face

Troy in the second contest.
Stanford's pitching will be up
against some formidable bats this
weekend. Daryl Arenstein, SC's
slugging first baseman, leads the
conference in home runs with
three in just four games.
Arenstein's batting average of
.538 trails that of teammate Rich
Bauer, who is whacking the ball at
an even .600.
If Stanford's freshmen can
continue pounding the ball this
weekend, things could look good
for the Cardinals' baseball hopes.
