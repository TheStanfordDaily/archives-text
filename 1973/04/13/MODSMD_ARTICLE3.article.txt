# USE Joins AFL-CIO As Service Union Local
## 
### VLAE KERSHNER GLENN GARVIN 
United Stanford Employees (USE)
voted overwhelmingly during the last
week to affiliate with the Service
Employees International Union
(SEIU) of the AFL-CIO.
USE President Glenda Jones
announced that her organization voted
223-15 to link with the SEIU in a mail
ballot conducted during the past seven
days.
"I didn't expect it to be quite this
overwhelming, but I can't say I was
surprised at the result," Jones said last
night after a meeting attended by 35
USE members in the Graduate School
of Business.
USE is one of two groups on the
ballot in an upcoming National Labor
Relations Board (NLRB) election to
determine the bargaining agent for
some 1600 University workers.
Upon approval by the SEIU
Executive Board, USE will become
Local 680 of the international union.

The agreement will continue in effect
whether or not USE wins the election.
$3000 To USE
As part of the agreement, the SEIU
will provide USE with at least $3000
in the representation election, the date
for which may be set following NLRB
hearings set to begin April 24.
These hearings may be necessary to
determine precisely which employees
are in the bargaining unit. Jones
charged last night that the Stanford
Joint Council, the other group on the
ballot, is deliberately delaying the
election by forcing hearings.
The hearings were scheduled after a
dispute arose among USE, the Joint
Council and the University over the
exact composition of the bargaining
unit.
Responsibility For Delay
Jones claimed that the Joint
Council was primarily responsible for
the delay. "It's in their best interest to
delay since they have no base at
Stanford" and need time to develop an

organization, she explained.
The Joint Council is composed of
American Federation of State,
County, and Municipal Employees
(AFSCME) Local 101 and
International Union of Operating
Engineers Local 3. Despite the fact
that both those unions are members of
the AFL-CIO, SEIU organizer Bob
Anderson predicted a bitter fight.
"I wish I could tell you it would be
all peace and harmony, but unions
compete in a very determined fashion
for bargaining rights the first time
around," Anderson told the meeting.
AFSCME Spending
Anderson said that AFSCME has
already spent $400,000 in an NLRB
contest in Los Angeles. "That gives
you an idea of how determined an
adversary they can be, regardless of
the consequences. They're spending
money like there is no tomorrow."
The Joint Council can't possibly
deal with the complexity of the
Stanford bargaining unit, Anderson
explained. "I think they're crazy to
compete with you but this is not a
sane world."
Anderson warned that the election
would be a "tough, tough, tough
fight," but pledged his union's full
support. "We have no magic ... we do
have a certain feeling for this group. I
think we might pull it out of the bag."
USE will retain most of its
autonomy under the agreement,
including management of the election
campaign. "They're calling the shots,"
Anderson said.
In other business, the group
unanimously agreed not to run
individual photos of members in the
USE newspaper without asking their
permission. One member had
complained that University supervisors
harassed him after his picture appeared
in the paper.

AFFILIATION — United Stanford Employees President Glenda Jones last night
announced that her union had voted overwhelmingly to affiliate with the Service
Employees International Union, an AFL-CIO member.
United Stanford Employees (USE)
voted overwhelmingly during the last
week to affiliate with the Service
Employees International Union
(SEIU) of the AFL-CIO.
USE President Glenda Jones
announced that her organization voted
223-15 to link with the SEIU in a mail
ballot conducted during the past seven
days.
"I didn't expect it to be quite this
overwhelming, but I can't say I was
surprised at the result," Jones said last
night after a meeting attended by 35
USE members in the Graduate School
of Business.
USE is one of two groups on the
ballot in an upcoming National Labor
Relations Board (NLRB) election to
determine the bargaining agent for
some 1600 University workers.
Upon approval by the SEIU
Executive Board, USE will become
Local 680 of the international union.

The agreement will continue in effect
whether or not USE wins the election.
$3000 To USE
As part of the agreement, the SEIU
will provide USE with at least $3000
in the representation election, the date
for which may be set following NLRB
hearings set to begin April 24.
These hearings may be necessary to
determine precisely which employees
are in the bargaining unit. Jones
charged last night that the Stanford
Joint Council, the other group on the
ballot, is deliberately delaying the
election by forcing hearings.
The hearings were scheduled after a
dispute arose among USE, the Joint
Council and the University over the
exact composition of the bargaining
unit.
Responsibility For Delay
Jones claimed that the Joint
Council was primarily responsible for
the delay. "It's in their best interest to
delay since they have no base at
Stanford" and need time to develop an

organization, she explained.
The Joint Council is composed of
American Federation of State,
County, and Municipal Employees
(AFSCME) Local 101 and
International Union of Operating
Engineers Local 3. Despite the fact
that both those unions are members of
the AFL-CIO, SEIU organizer Bob
Anderson predicted a bitter fight.
"I wish I could tell you it would be
all peace and harmony, but unions
compete in a very determined fashion
for bargaining rights the first time
around," Anderson told the meeting.
AFSCME Spending
Anderson said that AFSCME has
already spent $400,000 in an NLRB
contest in Los Angeles. "That gives
you an idea of how determined an
adversary they can be, regardless of
the consequences. They're spending
money like there is no tomorrow."
The Joint Council can't possibly
deal with the complexity of the
Stanford bargaining unit, Anderson
explained. "I think they're crazy to
compete with you but this is not a
sane world."
Anderson warned that the election
would be a "tough, tough, tough
fight," but pledged his union's full
support. "We have no magic ... we do
have a certain feeling for this group. I
think we might pull it out of the bag."
USE will retain most of its
autonomy under the agreement,
including management of the election
campaign. "They're calling the shots,"
Anderson said.
In other business, the group
unanimously agreed not to run
individual photos of members in the
USE newspaper without asking their
permission. One member had
complained that University supervisors
harassed him after his picture appeared
in the paper.
