# Sailing Team Exists, Competes Despite Lack Of Coach And Money

### TOM WINOKUR 
Yes, folks, there is a sailing
team at Stanford. The Leland
Stanford Junior University Sailing
Team to be exact. One of the
many unheralded club sports
which the athletic department
would rather forget about, the
sailing team competes throughout
the year in Flying Juniors and
Shields (classes of boats), and in
the Northern California
Intercollegiate Yacht Racing
Association (a conference just like
the Pac-8).
Until last weekend frustration
was the word which best

described the mood of Stanford's
team, which competes without a
coach and travels (essentially
without finances) to the exotic
corners of Northern California to
race against fellow paupers from
several schools.
A series of tactical mistakes
and equipment problems had kept
the defending NCIYRA
champions in lowly seventh place
until last weekend, when the
mood changed to satisfaction if
not excitement.
In consecutive regattas at
Humboldt State, Stanford
finished first and third. These high

finishes moved the team into fifth
place (two points out of fourth),
and assured a place in the 12-boat
California eliminations for the
National Collegiate Small Boat
championships to be held in June.
The only apparent difference
between last weekend and past
regattas was the use of more
experienced sailors. Senior Susy
Salisbury and junior captain Ben
Fisher sailed in the same regatta
for the first time this year. In
addition freshman Craig Daniels
showed his skill both as skipper
and crew over the two days. He
and Salisbury virtually destroyed
their division with two firsts and a
second.
These skippers showed their
knowledge of both tactics and sail
adjustment with resulting increase
in boat speed that astonished
several competitors. Both Cal and
UC Santa Cruz were stunned by
come-froin-behind victories on the
finishing leg.
The team hopes to continue its
regained success in several regattas
in the next few weeks. Stanford
will be competing in 30-foot
Shields on the bay this Sunday,
sailing in NCIYRA competition at
UC Davis next Saturday, and on
April 28-29 several Stanford
skippers will try to advance in
the eliminations for the National
Singlehanded Championships.
