# Gould Experiments With Tennis Lineup
## 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
A tennis coach can set his
lineup in two ways. He can either
allow the players to align
themselves through challenge
matches or use his own judgement
to decide what order gives the
best chance of victory.
Stanford's Dick Gould, having
played last weekend with a lineup
that "might not have been our
best," has decided to go back to
the second system in the wake of
the double losses to USC and
UCLA.
So, against Cal tomorrow, and
again against San Diego and
Arizona next Tuesday and
Wednesday, the Cardinals will
experiment with a variety of
players, giving Gould a chance to
complete his lineup for the big
rematches with USC and UCLA
here next weekend.
Obviously, the coach was
dissatisfied with play in the losses
last week, even though the 6-3
loss to USC, for instance, could
have been reversed by different
results on two points.
Two Match Points
Sandy Mayer, who has recently
beaten USC's Raul Ramirez
several straight times, had match
point against Ramirez twice but
still eventually lost at first singles.
Likewise, the third doubles
team of Jim Delaney and Pat
DuPre also had two match points
and still eventually loost.
So just two points and
Stanford could have beaten USC.
The Cardinals wouldn't have
needed much more than that to
also top UCLA, which won three
three-set matches in edging the
Cards by a single point, 5-4.
But still, even when you add
up all the excuses and bad breaks,
Stanford, man-for-man, is superior
to either Los Angeles school. And
that's why a lineup shift can be
expected.
DuPre Undermatched
The reason for this is that Pat
DuPre, who played only sixth
singles for the Cards in LA after
losing to Gery Groslimond and
John Whitlinger in challenge
matches, was undermatched down
at that slot.
DuPre didn't lose a set in two

days. Groslimond and Whitlinger,
playing fourth and fifth singles,
lost all four of their matches.
These losses provoked Gould to
say "a couple of our players
didn't go out there with the. idea
of getting them ... they waited
for someone to beat them."
So, the new singles lineup will
include DuPre at fourth singles,
after Sandy Mayer, Jim Delaney,
who is playing like a tiger right
now, and Rick Fisher.
Whether Groslimond or
Whitlinger will play fifth singles
has not yet been determined.
Also, the Cardinals, who lost
five of six doubles matches last
weekend, will change this sector
of their lineup.
Mayer-Delaney Pairing
Although the teams are not yet
set, the big difference will be the
pairing of Mayer and Delaney, the
best two singles players, at one of
the three doubles dots, although
whether they'll be able to beat
out Groslimond and Fisher and
play first doubles is problematical.
Tomorrow's meet, which will
begin at 1 p.m. at Berkeley, will
not be a really "big meet."
California would seem to be a
patsy when it is realized that Mark
Mitchell, the Cards' ninth man,
earlier this year upset Cal's top
player, Peter Campbell.
