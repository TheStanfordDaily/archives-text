# Cards Compete At Fresno Tourney
## Busy Golf Schedule Continues 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
The loss of Bruce Robertson
left Aly Trompas as Stanford's
only consistent threat to win a
major intercollegiate golf
tournament, but this weekend the
Cards will get a chance to display
their team balance in the Fresno
State Classic.
The nine-team, 54 hole
tourney which begins today at
Fort Washington Golf Course in
Fresno features a unique team
format. In most collegiate events
only the best four scores from I

each six-man team count towards
the team total, but at Fresno all
six scores are used, a factor which
should work to Stanford's
advantage.
"Our strength is that we have
six individuals capable of playing
par golf," said Dave Baskins,
"where a lot of the other top
teams rely on the same four
players in every tournament."
Baskins and his teammates will
all have to be on their games this
weekend for the Cards to win,
since the field at Fresno includes
USC, Brigham Young, Fresno
State, San Jose State, and San
Diego State, some of the strongest
teams on the West Coast.
Two weeks ago at the Pacific
Coast Invitational in Santa
Barbara, Stanford triumphed over
a similarly impressive field, but
last weekend Coach Bud Finger's
golfers placed third in the
University of Pacific Invitational
behind Fresno State and San Jose
State. The Cards also came out on
the short end of a 33-21 dual
match score against the Spartans
on Monday.
All of those results prove that

this weekend's outcome is totally
unpredictable. Any one of six
teams is capable of capturing the
title.
In the individual competition,
Trompas would have to be
considered one of the favorites,
along with teammate Conrad
Nilmeier, a native of Fresno who
shot 74-73-68 in last year's
tourney. Nilmeier's 215 total was
good for second place.
Some of the most prominent
opposing individuals include Craig
Stadler and Mark Pfeil of USC,
San Jose State's Mark Lye and
Jim Knoll, BYU's Joey Dills, and
Fresno State's Mike Watney.
