# Jordan Ranks Stanford Among Nation's Top 10
## 
### 
The track team is idle this week, but coach Payton Jordan has used
the time to issue his own national track rankings. Jordan, who feels
that his Cardinal team is one of the nation's best despite last
weekend's 101-50 loss to UCLA, attempted to prove his point
Tuesday at the Northern California track writers' luncheon.
Jordan contends that Pac-8 teams so far outclass the rest of the
nation that it is difficult for Stanford to get proper recognition.
"If we were rated 10th in basketball or football, we'd get a lot of
publicity," Jordan said, proceeding to list what he considers the
nation's top 14 track teams in terms of dual meet potential:

1. UCLA, 2. USC, 3. Oregon, 4. San
Jose State, 5. California. 6. Oregon
State, 7. Texas, El Paso, 8. Washington,
9. BYU, 10. Stanford, 11. Kansas, 12.
Tennessee, 13. Washington State, 14.
Alabama.
Jordan issued his rankings
apparently because he was upset
by press coverage of the
Stan ford-UCLA meet, which
emphasized that Stanford came as
close as it did only because UCLA
held out several of its top
performers.
"We went down there
expecting to be beaten and we
were," Jordan said. "But our
athletes competed very well. We
took 21 men and 18 of them
scored, four of five of them
achieving lifetime bests.
"It was indicated that we were
able to do this only becuase
UCLA held out so many. But they
held out only three men who
could have scored against us. Two
of those were injured and the
other didn't want to run.
"Our score wouldn't have been
so high if all the Bruins had been
able to compete, but I think we
would have gotten about 45
points." (Kansas and Tennessee
had previously come closest to
UCLA, with 43 and 40 points
respectively.).
