# Chris Expects 100 Hopefuls
## Spring Football Begins 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
Football, 1973 begins
tomorrow morning, as 29
returning lettermen and
approximately 70 other grid
hopefuls report for their first
spring workout.
Head coach Jack Christiansen
and his staff plan to conduct four
weeks of spring practices, with
workouts scheduled for Monday,
Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday,
and Saturday. The annual Red vs.
White scrimmage on May 12 will
conclude the spring season.
Christiansen is approaching
spring practice with enthusiasm,
despite the loss of 26 lettermen,
including seven starters each on
offense and defense. "We know
exactly where we have to
improve, based on our experience
a year ago," Chris said, "and there
will be some definite goals of
accomplishment in spring
practice. We've brought in six
junior college transfers who
should help us in the areas where
we were troubled last season, but
here is a lot of teaching and
learning which has to take place in
a hurry."
Tough Openers
Hopefully the improvements
will progress satisfactorily during
the spring, because Stanford
opens the 1973 season on
September 15 against Penn State
and then meets Michigan a week
later in Ann Arbor. Neither team
is exactly the type of squad to
practice against.
Although Penn State and
Michigan should be two of the
nation's top teams in 1973,
Christiansen sees some advantages
to opening against such stiff
competition. "Every season
presents big challenges from the
standpoint of opening games,"
Chris said, "but especially this
year with Penn State and
Michigan both certain to be
ranked in the preseason top 10.
We should be able to create a lot
of enthusiasm for those games."
On offense in 1973,
quarterback Mike Boryla and
running back John Winesberry
should once again provide most of
the fireworks, with bruising
fullback Scott Laidlaw expected
to add inside strength to the
running game. Most of the
offensive line has graduated,

however, leaving tackle Keith
Rowen, center Bill Reid, and
guard Doug Single as the only
experienced performers.
JC Transfers
Three junior college transfers
(Rudy Bergthold, Rob Olson, and
Van Day) could move into
starting line positions, as could
Terry Albritton from last year's
frosh.
If line coach Hudson Houck
can come up with five players
from that group who can
effectively protect Boryla (last
year the Cardinal quarterback was
sacked for 295 yards), Stanford'.'

passing game should once again be
explosive. Christiansen feels that
despite the graduation of Eric
Cross, Miles Moore, and Bill Scott,
Boryla will have a talented group
of receivers to throw to.
Tight end Glen Stone is a
proven performer, and Reggie
Ishman has also played well in the
past at flanker. The split end job
will most likely go to 5-10, 165
pound sophomore Bill Singler,
who may be Stanford's third great
"mini-receiver" in the mold of
Eric Cross and Randy Vataha.
Another strong receiving
candidate is Ray Anderson.
Defensive Line Questionable
Defensively the biggest
question mark is the line, where
defensive end Roger Stillwell will
be counted on to anchor an
otherwise inexperienced group of
down linemen. The linebacking
corps, which loses Jim Merlo, Pat
Moore, and Dennis Peterson, will
be equally inexperienced, but
Gordie Riegel and Forrie Martin
both were effective when called
upon last season.
The secondary seems most
secure, since starters Randy Poltl
and James Ferguson both return
from a quartet which last year led
the league in pass defense.
Veterans Jim Kaffen, Craig
Zaltoski, and Max Goldstein are
the leading candidates for the
remaining two starting jobs, along
with upcoming sophomore Gerald
Wilson.
The kicking game is also solid,
with placekicker Rod Garcia and
punter Dave Ottmar both among
the best in the Pac-8.

tomorrow morning, as 29
returning lettermen and
approximately 70 other grid
hopefuls report for their first
spring workout.
Head coach Jack Christiansen
and his staff plan to conduct four
weeks of spring practices, with
workouts scheduled for Monday,
Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday,
and Saturday. The annual Red vs.
White scrimmage on May 12 will
conclude the spring season.
Christiansen is approaching
spring practice with enthusiasm,
despite the loss of 26 lettermen,
including seven starters each on
offense and defense. "We know
exactly where we have to
improve, based on our experience
a year ago," Chris said, "and there
will be some definite goals of
accomplishment in spring
practice. We've brought in six
junior college transfers who
should help us in the areas where
we were troubled last season, but
here is a lot of teaching and
learning which has to take place in
a hurry."
Tough Openers
Hopefully the improvements
will progress satisfactorily during
the spring, because Stanford
opens the 1973 season on
September 15 against Penn State
and then meets Michigan a week
later in Ann Arbor. Neither team
is exactly the type of squad to
practice against.
Although Penn State and
Michigan should be two of the
nation's top teams in 1973,
Christiansen sees some advantages
to opening against such stiff
competition. "Every season
presents big challenges from the
standpoint of opening games,"
Chris said, "but especially this
year with Penn State and
Michigan both certain to be
ranked in the preseason top 10.
We should be able to create a lot
of enthusiasm for those games."
On offense in 1973,
quarterback Mike Boryla and
running back John Winesberry
should once again provide most of
the fireworks, with bruising
fullback Scott Laidlaw expected
to add inside strength to the
running game. Most of the
offensive line has graduated,

however, leaving tackle Keith
Rowen, center Bill Reid, and
guard Doug Single as the only
experienced performers.
JC Transfers
Three junior college transfers
(Rudy Bergthold, Rob Olson, and
Van Day) could move into
starting line positions, as could
Terry Albritton from last year's
frosh.
If line coach Hudson Houck
can come up with five players
from that group who can
effectively protect Boryla (last
year the Cardinal quarterback was
sacked for 295 yards), Stanford'.'

passing game should once again be
explosive. Christiansen feels that
despite the graduation of Eric
Cross, Miles Moore, and Bill Scott,
Boryla will have a talented group
of receivers to throw to.
Tight end Glen Stone is a
proven performer, and Reggie
Ishman has also played well in the
past at flanker. The split end job
will most likely go to 5-10, 165
pound sophomore Bill Singler,
who may be Stanford's third great
"mini-receiver" in the mold of
Eric Cross and Randy Vataha.
Another strong receiving
candidate is Ray Anderson.
Defensive Line Questionable
Defensively the biggest
question mark is the line, where
defensive end Roger Stillwell will
be counted on to anchor an
otherwise inexperienced group of
down linemen. The linebacking
corps, which loses Jim Merlo, Pat
Moore, and Dennis Peterson, will
be equally inexperienced, but
Gordie Riegel and Forrie Martin
both were effective when called
upon last season.
The secondary seems most
secure, since starters Randy Poltl
and James Ferguson both return
from a quartet which last year led
the league in pass defense.
Veterans Jim Kaffen, Craig
Zaltoski, and Max Goldstein are
the leading candidates for the
remaining two starting jobs, along
with upcoming sophomore Gerald
Wilson.
The kicking game is also solid,
with placekicker Rod Garcia and
punter Dave Ottmar both among
the best in the Pac-8.
