# Lacrosse Team Travels South To Face Temple City And UCLA
## 
### MARK WHITE 
Although it is doubtful Stanford canduplicatelast
week's 22-4 rout of Marin, the lacrosse team goes
after its fifth and sixth victories this weekend when
the Cards travel to Southern California for games
against Temple City Lacrosse Club tomorrow and
UCLA Sunday.
"I was happy with the score and our team's
oerformance," said coach Peter Schneider in
reviewing last Saturday's contest. "It's easy to get
sloppy when you have a 16 or 17 goal lead, but we
kept our heads about us and didn't sluff off.
"Everybody played well, but the defense looked
especially good. Doug Washington played very well
on defense. I thought Tom Earthman played an
excellent game on defense too and when he replaced
Rob Owen at goal and allowed only one goal in the
second half, I was very pleased. That was the first
time Tom has ever played goalie."
Starting goalie Owen was injured in the third
quarter when he was clipped by a Marin midfielder.
The same offender was seen goring Card middie Paul

Ruiz with his stick and later was spotted leaping on
a downed Card back.
"It's easy to get mad when you're losing like
they were," explained Schneider. "Although Owen
has had all the cartilege removed from his knees, the
doctor says the calcium deposits may keep him
from playing the rest of the year. That will mean
Hal Richardson will be goalie for us from now on.
The loss of Owen will hurt us, as we are now very
thin at goalie"
It was also learned that attackmen Butch Hazlett
and Bux Haddow, leading the team in scoring with
19 and 12 goals respectively, have cracked ribs.
Both are expected to play this weekend. However if
one should become injured again, there are
indications Schneider may come out of retirement
and play in a subbing attackman role.
"We do know UCLA has a pretty good team and
being short-handed as we will be, we'll have to play
hard to win, "Schneider said. "One thing is for sure,
though, we expect to have a good time."
