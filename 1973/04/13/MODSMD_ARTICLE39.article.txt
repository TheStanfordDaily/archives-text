Nixon Urges Minimum Jobless Benefits
WASHINGTON — President Nixon urged Congress
yesterday to establish federal minimum standards for
unemployment compensation benefits, now administered
by the states, and to extend coverage to 635,000 farm
workers.
In a special message to Congress, his third in three
days, Nixon said his legislation would guarantee that
about 80 percent of workers covered by unemployment
insurance would receive at least half their average weekly
wage when out of work.
The President said he also wants a third change in the
unemployment insurance system that would bar payment
of benefits to strikers, now paid by only two states, New
York and Rhode Island. This, he explained, would
"preserve the neutrality" of the system during labor
disputes.
Opposition is expected from both business and the
agricultural industrial over farm worker coverage and the
new federal standard.
Organized labor's chief spokesman, AFL-CIO President
George Meany, voiced approval of these two features but
said the proposal is "heavily outweighed by numerous and
glaring deficiencies."
Meany objected to the labor dispute provision and
complained that no provisions were included for
determining how long individual must be employed before
they are eligible for benefits, or for how long a jobless
worker is entitled to receive benefits. He called this a step
backward and said the AFL-CIO would oppose it.
Nixon recalled that in 1969 he asked the states to raise
jobless benefits voluntarily to his suggested half-pay
minimum, but few responded.
Although most states now set benefits at half pay, their
formula is rendered almost meaningless because it usually
is fixed on relatively low ceilings based on average wages
in the state.
Slain Palestinian Guerrillas Buried
BEIRUT, Lebanon — Firing machine guns in a final salute,
Palestinian guerrillas buried eight comrades killed by
Israeli commandos striking in the heart of this city and
Sidon.
About 40,000 persons turned out for yesterday's
funeral rites and heard tirades barked over bullhorns
against Israel and the United States.
Palestinian guerrilla leaders have accused the U.S.
Central Intelligence Agency of participating in the attacks
early Tuesday that killed three top commanders.
In New York, the U.N. Security Council was
summoned into special session to hear a complaint of the
Lebanese government against Israel.
The crowd jammed approaches to the Martyrs'
Cemetary in a pine forest near a Palestinian refugee camp
on the edge of the city. Loudspeakers exhorted the slain
men's families: "Mothers be happy! Your sons died like
real men!"
They repeated a Moslem chant, "La ilaha ilia Allah" —
There is no God but Allah.
Guerrillas carrying the coffins danced up to the freshly
dug graves then retreated to prolong the burial, signifying
that the deaths at the hands of the Israelis were noble.
Then men dressed in camoflage commando uniforms
fired machine-gun bursts into the air and the dead were

laid to rest.
The burials followed emotional funerals in a mosque
and a Christian church — one guerrilla was a Protestant —
and a procession by chanting mourners, many of them
heavily armed, through Beirut's streets.
Picasso Collection Donated To Louvre
PARIS — Pablo Picasso's widow and son announced
yesterday they are donating Picasso's priceless collection
of works by other artists to the state-owned Louvre
Museum.
Shortly before the donation was announced, Picasso's
grandson, Pablito, 23, swallowed potassium chloride
bleaching fluid in Vallauris near Mougins. He was taken to
a hospital and was in serious condition.
Pablito, his sister Marina, and the children's mother all
were refused admission to Picasso's house after the
Spanish artist died Sunday in Mougins, on the French
Fiviera, at the age of 91.
The mother, the former Emilienne Lotte, said Pablito
"was very affected" after being turned away from the
villa.
Later, she said, Pablito "took advantage of my absence,
and that of his sister, to try to take his life. It is a sad
story."
Picasso was survived by his widow, Jacqueline, 46, and
a son by his first marriage, Paulo, 52. They apparently are
Picasso's only heirs. Paulo and Pablito's mother were
married in 1950 but were divorced three years later.
Haig Briefs Nixon On Cambodia
WASHINGTON — President Nixon got a 45-minute report
yesterday from Army Gen. Alexander M. Haig Jr., just
back from a fact-finding mission to Cambodia.
Meanwhile, on Capitol Hill, a State Department legal
expert and various senators disagreed on the President's
powers to conduct bombing missions in Cambodia.
Although Nixon sent Haig to South Vietnam, Laos and
Thailand in addition to Cambodia, public attention
focused on his sessions with leaders of the Lon Nol
government in Phnom Penh.
The White House gave no details of Nixon's meeting
with Haig, Army vice chief of staff.
However, press secretary Ronald L. Ziegler said
Wednesday he did not anticipate any announcement of
major change in U.S. policy on Cambodia after Haig
submitted his report.
Nixon spent about an hour and a half at a regular
meeting of the National Security Council yesterday
morning, and the White House said Haig was not present.
Secretary of Defense Elliot L. Richardson at the
Capitol to brief a Senate Appropriations subcommittee,
was asked about reports that South Vietnamese troops
may be sent into Cambodia.
'There are no proposals to do this," he replied, adding
that the South Vietnamese are undoubtedly considering
various contingency proposals.
