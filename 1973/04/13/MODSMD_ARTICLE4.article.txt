# Palo Alto, Foothill School Boards
## Candidates To Vie For District Posts 
### ROBERT BACON 
Campus voters will be among those
voting for board members for the Palo
Alto Unified School District and the
Foothill Community College District
next Tuesday, April 17.
For the Palo Alto post, they will
select one board member from two
candidates sharply divided on
philosophical questions.
Two community college board
members will be elected from three
candidates — two incumbents and a
Foothill College student.
All of the main campus, including
student and faculty housing areas, is in
both districts, as is all of the city of
Palo Alto.
Basic Education
Candidates for the Palo Alto board
are Rebecca Morgan and Virginia
Williams, both non-incumbents.
Williams set the tone of the campaign
by asserting that "there is only one
pressing issue in this campaign — basic
education versus innovation and social
adjustment." She opts for basic
education.
"Although the world is changing
rapidly, the need for basic education —
reading, writing, and basic
mathematics — has never been
greater," she says.
Morgan responds that these basic
skills "are only part of an education. A
student must be able to communicate,

to make decisions, to get along with
others."
'Open Schools'
Morgan praises innovative programs
currently carried out by the district,
including a multicultural (ethnic
studies) program and "open school"
options at some elementary schools as
an alternative to the traditional
classroom environment.
Williams charges that basic
education has been allowed to suffer
and that the district cannot afford ail
the innovative and enrichment
programs that it presently offers.
The two are contesting for a
five-year term on the non-partisan
five-member board, replacing
incumbent Agnes Robinson, who is
retiring.
Foothill
In the Foothill Community College
District, incumbents Alfred P. Chasuk,
a Mountain View lawyer, and Mary
Lou Zoglin, wife of a Los Altos
physician, face challenger David F.
Moskowitz, a Foothill College student
from Los Altos Hills. Two
non-partisan four-year terms on the
five-member board are up for election.
The two incumbents are running on
the record of what they claim is the
finest community college district in
the world. Both recite a lengthy list of
innovative programs which the district
has undertaken to bring higher

education to those who would not
otherwise obtain it.
Moskowitz has endorsed Zoglin for
re-election, and calls himself Chasuk's
opponent. He says that Chasuk does
not work well with members of
minority groups, and that some
students feel Chasuk is racist.
Chasuk responds that the district
board was forced to establish the
structure of the district's multicultural
program last year when minority
students were unable to agree among
themselves. The program would be

evaluated in the near future, he
promised.
Moskowitz insists that it would be
valuable to the colleges' program to
have a student on the board. Chasuk
claims that the student point of view
would be better represented by a
non-voting advisory student than by a
student as a full member.
Zoglin is president of the California
Junior College Association.
The Foothill District operates
Foothill College in Los Altos Hills and
De Anza College in Cupertino.

Campus voters will be among those
voting for board members for the Palo
Alto Unified School District and the
Foothill Community College District
next Tuesday, April 17.
For the Palo Alto post, they will
select one board member from two
candidates sharply divided on
philosophical questions.
Two community college board
members will be elected from three
candidates — two incumbents and a
Foothill College student.
All of the main campus, including
student and faculty housing areas, is in
both districts, as is all of the city of
Palo Alto.
Basic Education
Candidates for the Palo Alto board
are Rebecca Morgan and Virginia
Williams, both non-incumbents.
Williams set the tone of the campaign
by asserting that "there is only one
pressing issue in this campaign — basic
education versus innovation and social
adjustment." She opts for basic
education.
"Although the world is changing
rapidly, the need for basic education —
reading, writing, and basic
mathematics — has never been
greater," she says.
Morgan responds that these basic
skills "are only part of an education. A
student must be able to communicate,

to make decisions, to get along with
others."
'Open Schools'
Morgan praises innovative programs
currently carried out by the district,
including a multicultural (ethnic
studies) program and "open school"
options at some elementary schools as
an alternative to the traditional
classroom environment.
Williams charges that basic
education has been allowed to suffer
and that the district cannot afford ail
the innovative and enrichment
programs that it presently offers.
The two are contesting for a
five-year term on the non-partisan
five-member board, replacing
incumbent Agnes Robinson, who is
retiring.
Foothill
In the Foothill Community College
District, incumbents Alfred P. Chasuk,
a Mountain View lawyer, and Mary
Lou Zoglin, wife of a Los Altos
physician, face challenger David F.
Moskowitz, a Foothill College student
from Los Altos Hills. Two
non-partisan four-year terms on the
five-member board are up for election.
The two incumbents are running on
the record of what they claim is the
finest community college district in
the world. Both recite a lengthy list of
innovative programs which the district
has undertaken to bring higher

education to those who would not
otherwise obtain it.
Moskowitz has endorsed Zoglin for
re-election, and calls himself Chasuk's
opponent. He says that Chasuk does
not work well with members of
minority groups, and that some
students feel Chasuk is racist.
Chasuk responds that the district
board was forced to establish the
structure of the district's multicultural
program last year when minority
students were unable to agree among
themselves. The program would be

evaluated in the near future, he
promised.
Moskowitz insists that it would be
valuable to the colleges' program to
have a student on the board. Chasuk
claims that the student point of view
would be better represented by a
non-voting advisory student than by a
student as a full member.
Zoglin is president of the California
Junior College Association.
The Foothill District operates
Foothill College in Los Altos Hills and
De Anza College in Cupertino.
