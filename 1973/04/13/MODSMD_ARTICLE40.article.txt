### MELODY BROADBENT 
The local diplomatic representative
from the Republic of China last night
said his nation is "still at war with the
communists; anything can happen."
Speaking before 50 people in the
Junipero lounge last night, C.C. Tuan,
San Francisco Consul General from
the Taiwan government expressed the
belief that the communists will be
defeated within his lifetime and that
their government will return to the
mainland.
Though "chagrined and anguished"
at the "illegal, immoral action" of the
United Nations in admitting the
People's Republic, Tuan cited an Old
Chinese proverb: "The test of courage
is to bear defeat without losing heart."

Tuan stressed the progress in recent
years on Taiwan as being "equally
applicable to the Mainland," which is
characterized by the Maoist regime of
"oppression at home, aggression
abroad." He said his country must
serve as a rallying point for the
millions of Chinese on the mainland
and other parts of Asia.
With recent "diplomatic setbacks,"
Tuan said that there are "very few
who still care about the 15 million
Chinese still living in Taiwan."
Areas in which he said his
government has been effective are:
universal education, better health care,
elimination of poverty, and other areas
of social progress. The area of business
was cited as being especially
productive. Tuan said that last year
the industrial center showed a real
growth of 11 percent.
Trying To Democratize
The question of "democracy"
sparked intense response from
students. Summarizing the situation,
Tuan said, "We are trying to
democratize the country, yet at the
same time we are at war with the
Communists." A state of martial law
has existed on Taiwan since "our
retreat from the mainland," but he
indicated that it was rarely enforced.
"Some of you would consider
Angela Davis a political prisoner,"
Tuan said on the topic of political
dissension on Taiwan. Due to the
situation of a state of war between
Taiwan and the mainland, the
Communist Party is outlawed as is any
study of Marxism-Leninism.

Tuan felt that those arrested for
sympathizing with the communists
were not political prisoners, but had
broken "ordinary criminal law.
Personally," he said, "I don't know of
any political prisoners."
Questions from the audience
challenged the idea that martial law
and democracy can exist
simultaneously. Under obvious
pressure, Tuan responded that because
of the state of war, Taiwan had to
protect itself from harmful elements.
He mentioned areas of progress
towards the goal of "democratiza
tion." For the first time since 1949,
new national elections were held in
1972.
'Bandwagon Effect'
Tuan said that "the bandwagon
effect" might influence more and
more countries to recognize the
People's Republic. His outlook for the
future is that Taiwan cannot break off
relations totally with all of those
nations, but that his government will
end diplomatic relations with the
governments of those countries.
Despite the rapprochement
between the People's Republic and the
United States, Tuan said he believed
there is still support for his
government here. He estimated that
"over 80 percent of the
Chinese-Americans in the United
States" support his country over the
mainland.
Tuan's presentation was sponsored
by Junipero as part of a series of
cultural programs for Asian-American
students.
