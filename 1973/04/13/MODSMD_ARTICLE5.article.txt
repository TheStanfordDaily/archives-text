# Socialist ASSU Slate Promises Alternative To Existing 'Trivia'
## 
### CHESS ERWIN 
"The ASSU is little more than a
forum for middle-class liberal
opportunists, lacking in any coherent
political philosophy. The other slates
of candidates are merely stressing
trivial, peripheral issues at the expense
of the pressing problems of the outside
world," says Fred Choate and Ed Ryu,
the Young Socialist slate in the
upcoming ASSU Presidential election.
Choate, a senior in Russian
literature, and Ryu, also a senior

majoring in economics, stress the idea
that this campaign has been
characterized by a preoccupation with
insignificant issues such as better
entertainment, minority speakers, and
a women's advocate while the real
problems that daily affect the lives of
millions of workers have been
overlooked.
Rather than depolitizing the
elections with undue concern over
these topics, they see it as their duty
to provide an alternative perspective to
what they consider expedient and
often irrational actions of the
University and the State, through
Socialism.
The Young Socialists say they are
running to provide "a meaningful
alternative" fo; student government in
the face of an opposition that is
concerned with capitalizing on
whatever fad is in vogue for student
concern at the time.
They believe the current trend in
student politics is for activism in the
areas of women's rights, minority
treatment, and more student
participation in University affairs.
According to Choate and Ryu,
these trends are direct outgrowths of
the violent student protests of the late
1960's and early 1970'5. However,
these demonstrations were principally
"reformist in character and not

directed at the issues which underly
the increasing capitalist domination of
political control and the usurpation of
worker's rights," said Choate.
"What is happening now is that
people must be made aware that the
old forms of protest will no longer
work because the capitalist order is
beginning to break down through
international economic competition
and other rivalries between the
capitalist powers. Rather, by
channelling their energies through the
socialist struggle, students and workers

=3 Presidential s Slate =

will be able to unite and fight to
reorganize the political order."
Both Choate and Ryu believe their
slate can garner enough support to win
the election because they say there is
increasing evidence that the student
community here is tired and
disaffected with student government
not responsive to what happens
outside the Stanford area.
They note that students must be
made aware of the gravity of the
problems facing workers in the United
States and worldwide if they are to be
able to have an understanding of them
and take part in the "conscious
struggle" that will inevitably affect
their lives, as well as those of workers
elsewhere.
"The time has come when the
people of America must be made to
understand that the concept of
'American pagmatism' is no longer a
means by which the problems that
face us can be solved. Pragmatism
involves no concrete political
philosophy and in the upcoming
struggle, socialism will provide the
base that is sorely needed in order to
cope with world problems on all
levels," Choate said.
Both candidates expressed a desire
to have far more input into the
decision-making process of the
University if elected, particularly in
the area of faculty appointments. This
is important, they suggested, becayse
professors have a very profound effect
on students' attitudes and their
political perceptions.
Adding that the formation of a
nationwide Labor party is one of the
key tenets of the Young Socialists,
Choate and Ryu said they would call
for a general strike of students,
faculty, and staff here in conjunction
with their request to the Santa Clara
Labor Council for the formation of
such a party.

a women's advocate while the real
problems that daily affect the lives of
millions of workers have been
overlooked.
Rather than depolitizing the
elections with undue concern over
these topics, they see it as their duty
to provide an alternative perspective to
what they consider expedient and
often irrational actions of the
University and the State, through
Socialism.
The Young Socialists say they are
running to provide "a meaningful
alternative" fo; student government in
the face of an opposition that is
concerned with capitalizing on
whatever fad is in vogue for student
concern at the time.
They believe the current trend in
student politics is for activism in the
areas of women's rights, minority
treatment, and more student
participation in University affairs.
According to Choate and Ryu,
these trends are direct outgrowths of
the violent student protests of the late
1960's and early 1970'5. However,
these demonstrations were principally
"reformist in character and not

directed at the issues which underly
the increasing capitalist domination of
political control and the usurpation of
worker's rights," said Choate.
"What is happening now is that
people must be made aware that the
old forms of protest will no longer
work because the capitalist order is
beginning to break down through
international economic competition
and other rivalries between the
capitalist powers. Rather, by
channelling their energies through the
socialist struggle, students and workers

=3 Presidential s Slate =

will be able to unite and fight to
reorganize the political order."
Both Choate and Ryu believe their
slate can garner enough support to win
the election because they say there is
increasing evidence that the student
community here is tired and
disaffected with student government
not responsive to what happens
outside the Stanford area.
They note that students must be
made aware of the gravity of the
problems facing workers in the United
States and worldwide if they are to be
able to have an understanding of them
and take part in the "conscious
struggle" that will inevitably affect
their lives, as well as those of workers
elsewhere.
"The time has come when the
people of America must be made to
understand that the concept of
'American pagmatism' is no longer a
means by which the problems that
face us can be solved. Pragmatism
involves no concrete political
philosophy and in the upcoming
struggle, socialism will provide the
base that is sorely needed in order to
cope with world problems on all
levels," Choate said.
Both candidates expressed a desire
to have far more input into the
decision-making process of the
University if elected, particularly in
the area of faculty appointments. This
is important, they suggested, becayse
professors have a very profound effect
on students' attitudes and their
political perceptions.
Adding that the formation of a
nationwide Labor party is one of the
key tenets of the Young Socialists,
Choate and Ryu said they would call
for a general strike of students,
faculty, and staff here in conjunction
with their request to the Santa Clara
Labor Council for the formation of
such a party.
