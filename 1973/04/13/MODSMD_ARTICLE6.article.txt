## ASSU President 
### 
The Daily Editorial Board finds itself deadlocked on the
question of an endorsement for the ASSU presidency. Half
the Board believes that the Daily can recommend no
candidate; half, that the Daily should endorse the slate of
Kevin O'Grady, Beth Garfield, Charles Ogle tree, and Jim
Friend, albeit half-heartedly.
The entire Editorial Board does, however, agree on this
point: the ASSU is an organization wracked with problems,
and may not be worth saving at all. For years, presidential
slates have promised an "effective" ASSU. So far as we can
determine, the animal has never existed.
The efforts of the current Council of Presidents have
clearly been inadequate to reverse that fact. The chances of
this year's candidates are little better.
The slate of Van Petten, Anderson, Flohr, and Schott
offers only a continuation of the ineffective policies
characteristic of the incumbent Council - by a less
competent group. Their grandiose proposals — establishment
of the"Yale Plan" for tuition payments, introduction of a
six-year M.D. Program - are goals which clearly have no
realistic chance of implementation through the ASSU.
The central proposal of the Cans and Thompson slate -
to dismantle the ASSU entirely - is an unsatisfactory
answer. To ignore the problem poses no solution; to destroy
the ASSU precludes the possibility of reform or of any
limited constructive action.
Many of the proposals of the O'Grady, Garfield, Ogletree,
and Friend slate appear more realistic than those of the Van
Petten slate. Their proposed creation of a
"guest-in-residence" program is well worthwhile, and
certainly more plausible than the Van Petten slate's
suggested reform of University tenure policy. Some of us
believe the introduction of new blood into the ASSU may
begin to alleviate the present "sandbox" character of
student politics.
On the other hand, some of us fear the O'Grady slate
represents a return to the nationally-oriented student
politics of the late sixties - an orientation students appear
to have rejected. Their commitment to political change is
clear from their background.
Moreover, their "something-for-everyone" platform and
their carefully-tailored ethnic and sexual balance threaten a
lack of real cohesion which could easily result in the same
fragmentation of authority that has plagued the present
Council.
Thus the Daily Editorial Board is in substantial agreement
that none of the presidential slates is truly competent or
deserving of a whole-hearted endorsement. However, we
have reached two different conclusions from these common
premises.
Half of the Board feels that under these circumstances no
slate can be conscientiously supported by the Daily. Yet the
other half feels that we have a responsibility to endorse
some candidate, and therefore advocates a vote for the
O'Grady slate as the least objectionable alternative.

clearly been inadequate to reverse that fact. The chances of
this year's candidates are little better.
The slate of Van Petten, Anderson, Flohr, and Schott
offers only a continuation of the ineffective policies
characteristic of the incumbent Council - by a less
competent group. Their grandiose proposals — establishment
of the"Yale Plan" for tuition payments, introduction of a
six-year M.D. Program - are goals which clearly have no
realistic chance of implementation through the ASSU.
The central proposal of the Cans and Thompson slate -
to dismantle the ASSU entirely - is an unsatisfactory
answer. To ignore the problem poses no solution; to destroy
the ASSU precludes the possibility of reform or of any
limited constructive action.
Many of the proposals of the O'Grady, Garfield, Ogletree,
and Friend slate appear more realistic than those of the Van
Petten slate. Their proposed creation of a
"guest-in-residence" program is well worthwhile, and
certainly more plausible than the Van Petten slate's
suggested reform of University tenure policy. Some of us
believe the introduction of new blood into the ASSU may
begin to alleviate the present "sandbox" character of
student politics.
On the other hand, some of us fear the O'Grady slate
represents a return to the nationally-oriented student
politics of the late sixties - an orientation students appear
to have rejected. Their commitment to political change is
clear from their background.
Moreover, their "something-for-everyone" platform and
their carefully-tailored ethnic and sexual balance threaten a
lack of real cohesion which could easily result in the same
fragmentation of authority that has plagued the present
Council.
Thus the Daily Editorial Board is in substantial agreement
that none of the presidential slates is truly competent or
deserving of a whole-hearted endorsement. However, we
have reached two different conclusions from these common
premises.
Half of the Board feels that under these circumstances no
slate can be conscientiously supported by the Daily. Yet the
other half feels that we have a responsibility to endorse
some candidate, and therefore advocates a vote for the
O'Grady slate as the least objectionable alternative.
The Daily Editorial Board finds itself deadlocked on the
question of an endorsement for the ASSU presidency. Half
the Board believes that the Daily can recommend no
candidate; half, that the Daily should endorse the slate of
Kevin O'Grady, Beth Garfield, Charles Ogle tree, and Jim
Friend, albeit half-heartedly.
The entire Editorial Board does, however, agree on this
point: the ASSU is an organization wracked with problems,
and may not be worth saving at all. For years, presidential
slates have promised an "effective" ASSU. So far as we can
determine, the animal has never existed.
The efforts of the current Council of Presidents have
clearly been inadequate to reverse that fact. The chances of
this year's candidates are little better.
