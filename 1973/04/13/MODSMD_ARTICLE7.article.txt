# A 						'Student-Interest' Office
## For Legal Counseling

The Legal Counseling Office
(LCO) fee assessment proposal on
next week's ASSU ballot is
probably unfamiliar to many
students.
Very briefly, the $1 fall
quarter fee assessment would pay
for a half-time attorney and a
half-time legal secretary and office
expenses for the nine-month
period between September 1973
and June 1974. Office space and
equipment and hopefully
receptionist services would be
provided by the Dean of Students
offices. The Legal Counseling
Office (LCO) would be open only
to Stanford students and student
spouses, not to faculty or staff.
Legal advice would be provided
free to all students regardless of
financial need; actual court
representation would be provided
free of charge in most types of
cases if the student met the
financial need standards;
otherwise court representation
would be provided at a sliding
percentage of the miniuum Bar
Association fee.
Fixing A Hole
The LCO would fill a gaping
hole which now exists in
Stanford's student services
programs; the University currently
provides free medical treatment at
Cowell, and free counseling is
available for psychiatric, drug,
sex, academic, career planning and
draft problems, but the University
does not offer any legal advice or
assistance. The Ombudsman
handles only intra-University
problems, while the law school's
legal aid society is primarily a
clearinghouse, is entirely
student-run and consequently
cannot legally give advice.
Various administration people
have long been aware of the
deficiency in Stanford's student
services, but budgetary, authority,
scope and control problems
combined with inertia have
frustrated all past proposals.

Arguments in support of the
LCO are many:
1. The concept of legal
insurance is rapidly gaining
acceptance as legal problems
multiply and costs soar; the LCO
really amounts to legal insurance
for Stanford students at a $1 per
year premium.
OEO Use Scandalous
2. The local OEO-funded legal
services offices which Stanford
students frequently burden with
their problems face severe budget
cut-backs. They may or may not
survive those cut-backs; and if
they do, every available hour and
dollar would be required to help
their neediest clients. Any
Stanford burden on these agencies
is nothing short of scandalous. If
anything, Stanford should provide
legal assistance to the community,
not vice versa.
3. Stanford students are not
immune to legal problems because
they are students, and the recent
adult-at-18 law in California has
increased the legal liabilities and
responsibilities of students.
Because student problems tend to
be recurrent, efficiency and
expertise are best developed
through a centralized office which
can specialize in student-type
problems, which now often
receive short shrift from private
attorneys and government
agencies alike.
4. While student funding of the
LCO is not the only way, it seems
undeniable that student-financing
means student control which
means more responsiveness and
less red-tape.
6. During recent debate over
Citizens Advocates, the ill-fated
public-interest law firm, many
opponents argued, I think
correctly, that Stanford students
had no business funding a
"public-interest" law firm when
they didn't have a
"student-interest" law firm. (The

present proposal is otherwise
entirely unrelated to Citizens
Advocates.) The LCO would be
just such a "student-interest"
office, concerned with the
concrete legal problems of those
who created it. It is not a
boondoggle for anyone. The only
students paid, if any, would be
paid through the work-study
program. The LCO deserves your
support.
