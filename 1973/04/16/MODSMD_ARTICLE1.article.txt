# Senator Denounces Arms Race, Says Domestic Priorities Suffer
## 
### BILL WEINSTEIN 
Sen. Adlai Stevenson 111 (D.-Ill.),
told a political science class here
Saturday morning that arms control is
the "most critical issue facing the
United States and the World."
"Why must we continue to MIRV
(Multiple Independently-Targeted
Re-entry Vehicle) our missies?" he
said. "Why must we develop new
bombers?" Why must we develop
mobile ICBM's? "Why must this all go
on?" he exclaimed.
Stevenson, the son of former
presidential candidate Adlai Stevenson
11, has been active in the field of arms
limitation and recently has been
holding hearings on the organization
of Congress.
"One measure of the importance of
arms control is economics," the
senator noted. He cited as an example
that since the end of World War II the
United States has spent $1.3 trillion
on defense. Stevenson suggested that
much of this money could have been
better spent on health, education, and
housing. "Is it just a coincidence that
the Japanese and Germans do not have
a heavy defense burden?" he asked.
The arms race "has acquired a
momentum of its own," he said. "If it
continues we will have in the 80's, 18
or 19 thousand deliverable warheads."
Arms Escalation
"Each move by one side begets a
move by the other," he added. "Unless
something is done this madness will
continue."
Stevenson questioned why with the
reduction of tension and
normalization of trade throughout the
world that this build-up continued.
The senator blamed part of the reason
on the failure of Congress.
"We no longer have three equal
branches of government," the senator
said. Part of the problem, he

explained, was that the role of
Congress was very limited — the
Executive branch played the dominant
role in arms negotiations.
"We [the Congress] are not
included in the deliberations of the
President," he commented. Stevenson
cited the President's recent actions in
Vietnam: "Not even the Joint Chiefs
of Staff were consulted in the mining
of the harbor of Haiphong."
Lack Of Funds
The senator cited economic
considerations and the President's use
of his powers as a deterrent to
effective congressional action.
"The Pentagon has 30,000 people
working on a $30 billion procurement
budget,"he stated. "The Armed
Services Committee (a congressional
committee that examines Department
of Defense proposals) has only 15
men."
Congress needs a larger budget,
manpower, and facilities to examine
the budget proposals, he noted. With
limited funds, however, he said it was
difficult to allocate resources for
better budgetary examination. "It
becomes in this disorderly legislative
process a question of priorities," he
added.
Press Attacks
Stevenson also said that attacks by
the press and the President had
hampered congressional action. "The
press likes to make fun of the
Congress," he said. "We have no way
of defending ourselves. And the
President," he added, "dominates the
media.
"The President claims we
(Congress) are fiscally irresponsible,"
he stated. "We may be, but the
President is even more fiscally
irresponsible."
Stevenson said Congress was "angry
about the abuses of presidential

powers. He has scared Congress,
perhaps into saving itself," he
commented.
"At the moment, the President can
be arrogant, because we're weak," he
said. "We (Congress) are not looking
for confrotation, we're looking for
equality."
The senator said that rather than
try to limit presidential powers such as
executive privilege, Congress should
try to strengthen itself. He said that
the battle over powers should not be
over "neat, jurisdictional boundaries."
Instead he stated that "Issues are
resolved in contests of power and
will."
Questioned as to whether the

United States followed the "No First
Use" policy (the refusal to use nuclear
weapons until they have been used
against you), Stevenson replied,
"That's not true. Our reliance on
nuclear weapons is for deterrence of
not only nuclear weapons but
conventional means." Because there
was no safeguard against the use of
these weapons Stevenson called for
"no first use without congressional
approval."
On U.S. foreign policy and
foreign aid, the senator commented: "I
don't think we have a foreign policy.
We just have slogans and bad habits.
We not only export arms, we export
our mistakes."

against you), Stevenson replied,
"That's not true. Our reliance on
nuclear weapons is for deterrence of
not only nuclear weapons but
conventional means." Because there
was no safeguard against the use of
these weapons Stevenson called for
"no first use without congressional
approval."
On U.S. foreign policy and
foreign aid, the senator commented: "I
don't think we have a foreign policy.
We just have slogans and bad habits.
We not only export arms, we export
our mistakes."

YOUNG ADLAI — Senator Adlai Stevenson 111 (D.-Ill.), discussed arms
limitation before a political science class Saturday morning. Stevenson called
the arms race purposeless, expensive, and dangerous.
Sen. Adlai Stevenson 111 (D.-Ill.),
told a political science class here
Saturday morning that arms control is
the "most critical issue facing the
United States and the World."
"Why must we continue to MIRV
(Multiple Independently-Targeted
Re-entry Vehicle) our missies?" he
said. "Why must we develop new
bombers?" Why must we develop
mobile ICBM's? "Why must this all go
on?" he exclaimed.
Stevenson, the son of former
presidential candidate Adlai Stevenson
11, has been active in the field of arms
limitation and recently has been
holding hearings on the organization
of Congress.
"One measure of the importance of
arms control is economics," the
senator noted. He cited as an example
that since the end of World War II the
United States has spent $1.3 trillion
on defense. Stevenson suggested that
much of this money could have been
better spent on health, education, and
housing. "Is it just a coincidence that
the Japanese and Germans do not have
a heavy defense burden?" he asked.
The arms race "has acquired a
momentum of its own," he said. "If it
continues we will have in the 80's, 18
or 19 thousand deliverable warheads."
Arms Escalation
"Each move by one side begets a
move by the other," he added. "Unless
something is done this madness will
continue."
Stevenson questioned why with the
reduction of tension and
normalization of trade throughout the
world that this build-up continued.
The senator blamed part of the reason
on the failure of Congress.
"We no longer have three equal
branches of government," the senator
said. Part of the problem, he

explained, was that the role of
Congress was very limited — the
Executive branch played the dominant
role in arms negotiations.
"We [the Congress] are not
included in the deliberations of the
President," he commented. Stevenson
cited the President's recent actions in
Vietnam: "Not even the Joint Chiefs
of Staff were consulted in the mining
of the harbor of Haiphong."
Lack Of Funds
The senator cited economic
considerations and the President's use
of his powers as a deterrent to
effective congressional action.
"The Pentagon has 30,000 people
working on a $30 billion procurement
budget,"he stated. "The Armed
Services Committee (a congressional
committee that examines Department
of Defense proposals) has only 15
men."
Congress needs a larger budget,
manpower, and facilities to examine
the budget proposals, he noted. With
limited funds, however, he said it was
difficult to allocate resources for
better budgetary examination. "It
becomes in this disorderly legislative
process a question of priorities," he
added.
Press Attacks
Stevenson also said that attacks by
the press and the President had
hampered congressional action. "The
press likes to make fun of the
Congress," he said. "We have no way
of defending ourselves. And the
President," he added, "dominates the
media.
"The President claims we
(Congress) are fiscally irresponsible,"
he stated. "We may be, but the
President is even more fiscally
irresponsible."
Stevenson said Congress was "angry
about the abuses of presidential

powers. He has scared Congress,
perhaps into saving itself," he
commented.
"At the moment, the President can
be arrogant, because we're weak," he
said. "We (Congress) are not looking
for confrotation, we're looking for
equality."
The senator said that rather than
try to limit presidential powers such as
executive privilege, Congress should
try to strengthen itself. He said that
the battle over powers should not be
over "neat, jurisdictional boundaries."
Instead he stated that "Issues are
resolved in contests of power and
will."
Questioned as to whether the

United States followed the "No First
Use" policy (the refusal to use nuclear
weapons until they have been used
against you), Stevenson replied,
"That's not true. Our reliance on
nuclear weapons is for deterrence of

powers. He has scared Congress,
perhaps into saving itself," he
commented.
"At the moment, the President can
be arrogant, because we're weak," he
said. "We (Congress) are not looking
for confrotation, we're looking for
equality."
The senator said that rather than
try to limit presidential powers such as
executive privilege, Congress should
try to strengthen itself. He said that
the battle over powers should not be
over "neat, jurisdictional boundaries."
Instead he stated that "Issues are
resolved in contests of power and
will."
Questioned as to whether the

United States followed the "No First
Use" policy (the refusal to use nuclear
weapons until they have been used
against you), Stevenson replied,
"That's not true. Our reliance on
nuclear weapons is for deterrence of
not only nuclear weapons but
conventional means." Because there
was no safeguard against the use of
these weapons Stevenson called for
"no first use without congressional
approval."
On U.S. foreign policy and
foreign aid, the senator commented: "I
don't think we have a foreign policy.
We just have slogans and bad habits.
We not only export arms, we export
our mistakes."
