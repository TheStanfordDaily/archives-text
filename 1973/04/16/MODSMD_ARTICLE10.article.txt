# The 						Highest Priority
## Federal Budget-Cutting 
### 
Paul N. McCloskey

Of all the major issues before the 93rd
Congress, control of federal spending may
have the highest priority.
In a key vote last week, the House
sustained a Presidential veto of funds for the
Rural Water and Sewer Program. The bill in
question had earlier passed the House by a
margin of 297 to 54, but the vote to override
the President's veto failed 225 to 189, 51
votes short of the required two-thirds
majority.
What caused over 100 House Members,
including myself, to change their minds and
vote to cut back funds for this particular
program?
Self Discipline
The cause, in my opinion, is the awakening
realization of Congress that we must discipline
ourselves and finally balance the federal
budget; that it is time we recognize our
inability to fund every good program to its
maximum if we are to terminate the inflation
which has imposed a far heavier burden than
taxation on older people and people of lower
income. A 20 percent increase in Social
Security benefits is not much help if inflation
has risen 35 percent.

The sustaining of the President's veto of
high-cost spending bills is not necessarily an
abdication to the President of Congressional
powers over spending priorities. It does seem,
however, that if revenues are anticipated to be
$245 billion this year, we are going to have to
conscientiously cut back federal programs, if
necessary across the board, in order to keep
our expenditures within those revenues. Thus,
the House's vote to sustain the Presidential
veto is highly significant.
That the Senate feels similarly was
indicated a few days earlier by the Senate vote
to sustain the Presidential veto of the
Vocational Rehabilitation Act by 60 to 36.
The bill had earlier passed the Senate by a
margin of 86 to 2. From these two votes, with
a full one-fourth of both Senate and House
members switching their votes, the American
taxpayer can finaly take some hope that there
is a new attitude on the part of a Congress
which has appropriated an average of $47
billion a year more than received in tax
revenues during each of the past three years.
Defense, Aid
The two veto-sustaining votes probably
also mean that Congress will be in a far more

critical mood when it comes to the major
Defense and Foreign Aid bills. If the
President, in a flush of zeal, is going to
completely terminate the expenditure of a
relatively-few million dollars in medical
training, environmental and housing programs,
he can expect little mercy in Congressional
slashing of a Defense Budget of over $80
billion.
It is my own intention to support all
legitimate votes for budget-cutting to a point
where total federal expenditures do not
exceed revenues. On issues of principle, where
the expenditures are relatively small, such as
the Older Americans Act, OEO Legal Services
program, college student assistance and
support of the National Foundation for the
Arts and Humanities, I will vote for the full
funding level.
The important point, however, is that we
are going to have to accept cuts in some
traditional and very good programs in order to
achieve the higher-priority necessity of a
responsible budget.

achieve the higher-priority necessity of a
responsible budget.

Of all the major issues before the 93rd
Congress, control of federal spending may
have the highest priority.
In a key vote last week, the House
sustained a Presidential veto of funds for the
Rural Water and Sewer Program. The bill in
question had earlier passed the House by a
margin of 297 to 54, but the vote to override
the President's veto failed 225 to 189, 51
votes short of the required two-thirds
majority.
What caused over 100 House Members,
including myself, to change their minds and
vote to cut back funds for this particular
program?
Self Discipline
The cause, in my opinion, is the awakening
realization of Congress that we must discipline
ourselves and finally balance the federal
budget; that it is time we recognize our
inability to fund every good program to its
maximum if we are to terminate the inflation
which has imposed a far heavier burden than
taxation on older people and people of lower
income. A 20 percent increase in Social
Security benefits is not much help if inflation
has risen 35 percent.

The sustaining of the President's veto of
high-cost spending bills is not necessarily an
abdication to the President of Congressional
powers over spending priorities. It does seem,
however, that if revenues are anticipated to be
$245 billion this year, we are going to have to
conscientiously cut back federal programs, if
necessary across the board, in order to keep
our expenditures within those revenues. Thus,
the House's vote to sustain the Presidential
veto is highly significant.
That the Senate feels similarly was
indicated a few days earlier by the Senate vote
to sustain the Presidential veto of the
Vocational Rehabilitation Act by 60 to 36.
The bill had earlier passed the Senate by a
margin of 86 to 2. From these two votes, with
a full one-fourth of both Senate and House
members switching their votes, the American
taxpayer can finaly take some hope that there
is a new attitude on the part of a Congress
which has appropriated an average of $47
billion a year more than received in tax
revenues during each of the past three years.
Defense, Aid
The two veto-sustaining votes probably
also mean that Congress will be in a far more

critical mood when it comes to the major
Defense and Foreign Aid bills. If the
President, in a flush of zeal, is going to
completely terminate the expenditure of a
relatively-few million dollars in medical
training, environmental and housing programs,
he can expect little mercy in Congressional
slashing of a Defense Budget of over $80
billion.
It is my own intention to support all
legitimate votes for budget-cutting to a point
where total federal expenditures do not
exceed revenues. On issues of principle, where
the expenditures are relatively small, such as
the Older Americans Act, OEO Legal Services
program, college student assistance and
support of the National Foundation for the
Arts and Humanities, I will vote for the full
funding level.
The important point, however, is that we
are going to have to accept cuts in some
traditional and very good programs in order to
achieve the higher-priority necessity of a
