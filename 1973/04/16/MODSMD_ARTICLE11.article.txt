Program Fee
Editor:
In the Daily Editorial last
Thursday several things were said
that altogether miss the point of
the Program Fee Assessment. The
Daily's reason for recommending
a negative vote rested on the
limited appeal of some of the
groups. This reasoning totally
misses the point of the Program
Fee.
The point is that these groups
do have limited appealâ€”but they
collectively represent a large
number of students and their
interests. Individually these
groups have no need for and could
not get a special fee assessment of
$11,000, but when put together
in a budget allocating an average
of $750 per group, they have a
chance to be funded at an
appropriate level.
The Daily said they didn't like
certain groups and felt that they
were resting on other groups to
get the Program Fee passed. No
student is expected to like or
participate in all the groups
receiving funds. Different students
like different activities. The
program fee gives students a
chance to help a wide variety of
groups.
The total budget of the
Program Fee represents activities
that affect a large number of
students, certainly more than the
Band or KZSU. How many
students will see a show put on by
the Company, or use the Women's
Center or read any number of
publications all of which are being
supported by the Program Fee?
Admittedly, some groups such as
the departmental groups have
little appeal outside of the
department, but these groups only
received $50.00.
Many of these groups have
been funded on a shoestring
budget for the past two years. If
this Program Fee passes, these
groups will have a chance to open
out to the entire community. Any
activities supported by the
program fee must be open to the
student body at large.
