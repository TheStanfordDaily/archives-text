# The 						ASSU Candidates Speak: Qualifications, Politics
## "We Don't Call It 'Taking the Fifth Any More" 
### 
In order to better inform our
readers of the positions and
platforms of the candidates for
this week's ASSU presidential
election, the Daily has invited all
slates to respond to a series of
four questions. Today, the
candidates' answers to questions
on their qualifications and their
views of the political dimension of
the office they seek.
Qualifications
The first question: What
specifically distinguishes your
slate, in terms of ability and
experience, from the others? What
in damnation makes you believe
you can do a better job than
anybody else?
(Judy Gans and Buzz
Thompson reply:)
We are the only slate to favor
the abolition of the ASSU as it
presently exists. We join a diverse
group of individuals which
includes Chris Hocker and former
ASSU President Larry Diamond in
urging that the ASSU be made
voluntary — only those who desire
its services should have to pay for
it.
We are not vying for the
opportunity to spend the ASSU
fund of $92,000. Instead, we seek
ways to return that money to the
students. If, after students are
given the option of whether or
not to pay for a student
government, they decide to retain
an ASSU, we have no objection.
But that decision should be
individual and voluntary, not
collective and coerced.
The illusion of a viable student
government has plagued Stanford
for years. It would be laughable if
it were not so expensive.
Individuals and groups are far
more capable of implementing
change which affects them
without the inherent bureaucracy
of the ASSU. A cursory
examination of the ASSU budget
reveals a horrendous waste of
resources — from the $5,000 bill
for telephones to the entire
banking operation which is costly
and cumbersome, and could be
handled far more easily by private
banks.
We are not "experienced" in
the sense of having a stake in the
ASSU. By nature, we are neither
bureaucrats nor politicians. We
can't afford thousands of slick,
expensive leaflets which prove
how "committed" we are.
In short, we run because we
prefer the establishment of reality
to the perpetuation of a myth.
(Kevin O'Grady, Beth Garfield,
Charles Ogletree, and Jim Friend
reply:)
The O'Grady-Garfield-Ogletree-
Friend slate would bring to the
ASSU a diversity of backgrounds

and abilities essential to an
effective ASSU.
Beth Garfield and Charles
Ogletree have had experience as
ASSU Senators and have worked
extensively within the University
committee system. Garfield
organized the successful childcare
initiative last spring and this year
organized the womens' speakers
bureau. Ogletree is chairman of
the Black Students Union and
editor of the Real News. They
have proven that they can be
effective within the University
structure.
Kevin O'Grady and Jim Friend,
as organizers of the McGovern and
McCloskey campaigns, have
worked closely with students
throughout the residence system
and in the graduate schools. Their
organizational ability could bring
to the ASSU the broad base that
it has lacked in the past.
The concept of a council of
presidents affords the opportunity
to bring together persons of
differing backgrounds and
perspectives. This year's Council
of Presidents has been
handicapped in its ability to deal
with the problems of many
important constituencies on
campus. Our slate has
demonstrated its concern with the
interests of all major student
constituencies.
There is no guarantee that a
diverse slate will be able to involve
all the different constituencies.
The homogeneity of the Van
Petten slate, however, shows a
lack of concern for the problems
of many persons and groups at
Stanford.
The O'Grady-Garfield-Ogletree-
Friend slate, on the other hand,
has the experience in student
government, the necessary rapport
with crucial student
constituencies, and the experience
in campus-wide organizations that
could make the ASSU into a
responsive and effective student
government.
(Peter Van Petten, Jim
Anderson, Tom Flohr, and
Charles "Buck" Schott reply:)
The members of our slate
represent a broad range of student
interests and concerns. In our
years at Stanford we have worked
in nearly every area of importance
at the University — educational
reform, concerts, judicial reform,
student services, committee
appointments, fundraising, and
Tresidder Union.
Our interest and commitment
to change at the University, and
our efforts to make it a better
place, are of long standing. The
concern for students and the
University now demonstrated by
our opponents is highly suspect

for it is of very recent vintage.
Our perception of the purpose
of the ASSU and the function of
its officers is to seek to improve
the lives of students at Stanford.
This view contrasts sharply with
the other candidates, who are
either joke candidates, ideologues
who intend to use the position to
publicize their political
philosophies, or representatives of
special interest groups whose
sudden interest in the University
and student services is the obvious
result of the candidacy for the
ASSU Presidency.
(Fred Choate and Ed Ryu
reply:)
We, the Young Socialists, stand
in complete opposition to the
other slates in that we take as our
starting point the needs of the
working class internationally. We
do not, as the other slates do,
begin and end with Stanford
University.
The heart of this irreconcilable
contradiction between their
perspectives and ours is deeply
philosophical. Their politics
reflect the bankrupt methodology
of the capitalist class: skepticism,
empiricism and pragmatism. We
are armed with the theoretical
essence of Marxism, dialectical
materialism.
It has only been through a
conscious daily fight for Marxism
that our movement has been able
to understand the nature of the
international crisis of capitalism
and the tasks that are posed: the
building of a labor party within
the working class pledged to
socialist policies and the
construction of a mass
revolutionary youth movement,
the Young Socialists, to carry
these tasks forward. It is only the
Young Socialists who will be able
to defend the right to an
education for working class youth
by fighting against the budget cuts
and constructing the absolutely
crucial revolutionary leadership.
We urge all those who agree
with our perspectives to support
our campaign and help build the
Young Socialists at Stanford.
Politics
The second question: Should
the ASSU be used as a vehicle for
political advocacy and action — or
should the Council of Presidents
avoid the political arena?
(Judy Cans and Buzz
Thompson reply:)
The ASSU has no business
crusading for political causes on
behalf of others. We intend to
keep our mouths strictly shut —
to speak at no rallies, sponsor no
causes, lobby for no interest
groups. We speak for ourselves,

and make no claim to represent
anyone else.
Our position on this matter is
based on principle, not utility. We
do not oppose political activism
"because it doesn't work very
well" as another slate has
suggested. We oppose it because
we have no right to speak for
others.
This applies not only to
outside issues but also to internal
affairs. It is precisely this struggle
among student interest groups at
Stanford — a struggle which is
reflected in the makeup of most
of the other slates — which
torpedoed whatever effectiveness
the ASSU ever had, and reduced it
to a political sandbox.
We are libertarians. By
definition, this means that we will
not attempt to impose our values
on others. The removal of such an
imposition necessitates the
abolition of compulsory student
government.
(Kevin O'Grady, Beth Garfield,
Charles Ogletree, and Jim Friend
reply:)
Campaigning for political
candidates is not the business of
the ASSU. At the same time, we
think it is a misconception to
suggest that the ASSU can be
totally non-political. The role of
the ASSU is to represent the
interests of the students. These
interests occasionally come into
confict with the interests of other
groups both inside and outside the
university.
It is generally agreed that it is a
legitimate role of the ASSU to
represent the interests of the
students in dealings with the
administration and faculty. We
believe that there are also
instances in which it would be
proper for an ASSU officer to
defend the interests of students in
dealings with groups outside the
university.
For example, in the coming
year, there will be a number of
important decisions made in
Washington and Sacramento
regarding the future of student
loan programs. As the ASSU
Council of Presidents, we would
consider it our legitimate function
to keep students informed about
developments pertaining to this
issue, and even to suggest ways in
which students could influence
the decisions to be made.
On a practical level, we realize
that the ability of ASSU officers
to affect decision-making
processes outside the university is
limited. Correspondingly, we feel
that this endeavor should not be
emphasized at the expense of
efforts in the areas of education,
student services, and university
governance.

(Peter Van Petten, Jim
Anderson, Tom Flohr, and
Charles "Buck" Schott reply:)
ASSU officers have only one
function — to serve the students
of Stanford University. It is
foolish for them to become
involved in outside political issues,
because the effect they can have
on state and national politics is
close to nil. In the past four or
five years, the sole result of ASSU
involvement in outside political
issues has been a lack of action in
the areas where student officers
can have real influence and impact
—. providing services and
advocating student interests
within the University.
Only the ASSU can provide
valuable services to Stanford
students on an inexpensive,
non-profit basis. We have
proposed realistic programs to
expand and improve such services
as concerts, speakers, the Course
Review, and the Sunday Flicks.
The ASSU can also serve as an
advocate for changes benefiting
students. While ASSU officers
have no direct power to make
changes in areas such as
educational reform, tuition rates,
and judicial reform, they have the
duty to use their positions of
pseudo-legitimacy to make
realistic proposals for change and
to try to persuade and push into
action those who do have the
power — the administration and
the faculty.
(Fred Choate and Ed Ryu
reply:)
We, the Young Socialists, are
running this campaign in order to
bring our perspectives to masses
of people as part of the task of
building the leadership for
workers and youth as they enter
into a period of tremendous
struggle.
This means that we view the
role that students can and must
play as absolutely critical in the
upcoming period. Any attempt to
turn the ASSU or any student or
working class organization away
from the international political
crisis is an attempt to prepare the
destruction of millions as Nixon
and the capitalists internationally
make open preparations for civil
war and dictatorship.
The present ASSU election is a
clear reflection of the theoretical
and practical bankrupcy of the
other slates N as they openly deny
the importance of political
questions and consequently
cannot even address themselves to
such burning issues as Nixon's
disastrous budget cuts. To avoid
these issues means to deny the
reality of the outside world and
especially to deny the ability of
students to effectively intervene

to change what is taking place.
It is our perspective that,
armed with an objective
understanding of the international
crisis of capitalism, students must
begin to defend workers and
working class youth by joining the
Young Socialists and fighting to
build a labor party pledged to

socialist policies. As Presidents of
the ASSU, we will use the office
to carry out this perspective.

It is generally agreed that it is a
legitimate role of the ASSU to
represent the interests of the
students in dealings with the
administration and faculty. We
believe that there are also
instances in which it would be
proper for an ASSU officer to
defend the interests of students in
dealings with groups outside the
university.
For example, in the coming
year, there will be a number of
important decisions made in
Washington and Sacramento
regarding the future of student
loan programs. As the ASSU
Council of Presidents, we would
consider it our legitimate function
to keep students informed about
developments pertaining to this
issue, and even to suggest ways in
which students could influence
the decisions to be made.
On a practical level, we realize
that the ability of ASSU officers
to affect decision-making
processes outside the university is
limited. Correspondingly, we feel
that this endeavor should not be
emphasized at the expense of
efforts in the areas of education,
student services, and university
governance.

ASSU officers have only one
function — to serve the students
of Stanford University. It is
foolish for them to become
involved in outside political issues,
because the effect they can have
on state and national politics is
close to nil. In the past four or
five years, the sole result of ASSU
involvement in outside political
issues has been a lack of action in
the areas where student officers
can have real influence and impact
—. providing services and
advocating student interests
within the University.
Only the ASSU can provide
valuable services to Stanford
students on an inexpensive,
non-profit basis. We have
proposed realistic programs to
expand and improve such services
as concerts, speakers, the Course
Review, and the Sunday Flicks.
The ASSU can also serve as an
advocate for changes benefiting
students. While ASSU officers
have no direct power to make
changes in areas such as
educational reform, tuition rates,
and judicial reform, they have the
duty to use their positions of
pseudo-legitimacy to make
realistic proposals for change and
to try to persuade and push into
action those who do have the
power — the administration and
the faculty.
(Fred Choate and Ed Ryu
reply:)
We, the Young Socialists, are
running this campaign in order to
bring our perspectives to masses
of people as part of the task of
building the leadership for
workers and youth as they enter
into a period of tremendous
struggle.
This means that we view the
role that students can and must
play as absolutely critical in the
upcoming period. Any attempt to
turn the ASSU or any student or
working class organization away
from the international political
crisis is an attempt to prepare the
destruction of millions as Nixon
and the capitalists internationally
make open preparations for civil
war and dictatorship.
The present ASSU election is a
clear reflection of the theoretical
and practical bankrupcy of the
other slates N as they openly deny
the importance of political
questions and consequently
cannot even address themselves to
such burning issues as Nixon's
disastrous budget cuts. To avoid
these issues means to deny the
reality of the outside world and
especially to deny the ability of
students to effectively intervene

to change what is taking place.
It is our perspective that,
armed with an objective
understanding of the international
crisis of capitalism, students must
begin to defend workers and
working class youth by joining the
Young Socialists and fighting to
build a labor party pledged to

socialist policies. As Presidents of
the ASSU, we will use the office
to carry out this perspective.

Tomorrow: the candidates'
answers to questions on ASSU
finances and education.

In order to better inform our
readers of the positions and
platforms of the candidates for
this week's ASSU presidential
election, the Daily has invited all
slates to respond to a series of
four questions. Today, the
candidates' answers to questions
on their qualifications and their
views of the political dimension of
the office they seek.
Qualifications
The first question: What
specifically distinguishes your
slate, in terms of ability and
experience, from the others? What
in damnation makes you believe
you can do a better job than
anybody else?
(Judy Gans and Buzz
Thompson reply:)
We are the only slate to favor
the abolition of the ASSU as it
presently exists. We join a diverse
group of individuals which
includes Chris Hocker and former
ASSU President Larry Diamond in
urging that the ASSU be made
voluntary — only those who desire
its services should have to pay for
it.
We are not vying for the
opportunity to spend the ASSU
fund of $92,000. Instead, we seek
ways to return that money to the
students. If, after students are
given the option of whether or
not to pay for a student
government, they decide to retain
an ASSU, we have no objection.
But that decision should be
individual and voluntary, not
collective and coerced.
The illusion of a viable student
government has plagued Stanford
for years. It would be laughable if
it were not so expensive.
Individuals and groups are far
more capable of implementing
change which affects them
without the inherent bureaucracy
of the ASSU. A cursory
examination of the ASSU budget
reveals a horrendous waste of
resources — from the $5,000 bill
for telephones to the entire
banking operation which is costly
and cumbersome, and could be
handled far more easily by private
banks.
We are not "experienced" in
the sense of having a stake in the
ASSU. By nature, we are neither
bureaucrats nor politicians. We
can't afford thousands of slick,
expensive leaflets which prove
how "committed" we are.
In short, we run because we
prefer the establishment of reality
to the perpetuation of a myth.
(Kevin O'Grady, Beth Garfield,
Charles Ogletree, and Jim Friend
reply:)
The O'Grady-Garfield-Ogletree-
Friend slate would bring to the
ASSU a diversity of backgrounds

and abilities essential to an
effective ASSU.
Beth Garfield and Charles
Ogletree have had experience as
ASSU Senators and have worked
extensively within the University
committee system. Garfield
organized the successful childcare
initiative last spring and this year
organized the womens' speakers
bureau. Ogletree is chairman of
the Black Students Union and
editor of the Real News. They
have proven that they can be
effective within the University
structure.
Kevin O'Grady and Jim Friend,
as organizers of the McGovern and
McCloskey campaigns, have
worked closely with students
throughout the residence system
and in the graduate schools. Their
organizational ability could bring
to the ASSU the broad base that
it has lacked in the past.
The concept of a council of
presidents affords the opportunity
to bring together persons of
differing backgrounds and
perspectives. This year's Council
of Presidents has been
handicapped in its ability to deal
with the problems of many
important constituencies on
campus. Our slate has
demonstrated its concern with the
interests of all major student
constituencies.
There is no guarantee that a
diverse slate will be able to involve
all the different constituencies.
The homogeneity of the Van
Petten slate, however, shows a
lack of concern for the problems
of many persons and groups at
Stanford.
The O'Grady-Garfield-Ogletree-
Friend slate, on the other hand,
has the experience in student
government, the necessary rapport
with crucial student
constituencies, and the experience
in campus-wide organizations that
could make the ASSU into a
responsive and effective student
government.
(Peter Van Petten, Jim
Anderson, Tom Flohr, and
Charles "Buck" Schott reply:)
The members of our slate
represent a broad range of student
interests and concerns. In our
years at Stanford we have worked
in nearly every area of importance
at the University — educational
reform, concerts, judicial reform,
student services, committee
appointments, fundraising, and
Tresidder Union.
Our interest and commitment
to change at the University, and
our efforts to make it a better
place, are of long standing. The
concern for students and the
University now demonstrated by
our opponents is highly suspect

for it is of very recent vintage.
Our perception of the purpose
of the ASSU and the function of
its officers is to seek to improve
the lives of students at Stanford.
This view contrasts sharply with
the other candidates, who are
either joke candidates, ideologues
who intend to use the position to
publicize their political
philosophies, or representatives of
special interest groups whose
sudden interest in the University
and student services is the obvious
result of the candidacy for the
ASSU Presidency.
(Fred Choate and Ed Ryu
reply:)
We, the Young Socialists, stand
in complete opposition to the
other slates in that we take as our
starting point the needs of the
working class internationally. We
do not, as the other slates do,
begin and end with Stanford
University.
The heart of this irreconcilable
contradiction between their
perspectives and ours is deeply
philosophical. Their politics
reflect the bankrupt methodology
of the capitalist class: skepticism,
empiricism and pragmatism. We
are armed with the theoretical
essence of Marxism, dialectical
materialism.
It has only been through a
conscious daily fight for Marxism
that our movement has been able
to understand the nature of the
international crisis of capitalism
and the tasks that are posed: the
building of a labor party within
the working class pledged to
socialist policies and the
construction of a mass
revolutionary youth movement,
the Young Socialists, to carry
these tasks forward. It is only the
Young Socialists who will be able
to defend the right to an
education for working class youth
by fighting against the budget cuts
and constructing the absolutely
crucial revolutionary leadership.
We urge all those who agree
with our perspectives to support
our campaign and help build the
Young Socialists at Stanford.
Politics
The second question: Should
the ASSU be used as a vehicle for
political advocacy and action — or
should the Council of Presidents
avoid the political arena?
(Judy Cans and Buzz
Thompson reply:)
The ASSU has no business
crusading for political causes on
behalf of others. We intend to
keep our mouths strictly shut —
to speak at no rallies, sponsor no
causes, lobby for no interest
groups. We speak for ourselves,

and make no claim to represent
anyone else.
Our position on this matter is
based on principle, not utility. We
do not oppose political activism
"because it doesn't work very
well" as another slate has
suggested. We oppose it because
we have no right to speak for
others.
This applies not only to
outside issues but also to internal
affairs. It is precisely this struggle
among student interest groups at
Stanford — a struggle which is
reflected in the makeup of most
of the other slates — which
torpedoed whatever effectiveness
the ASSU ever had, and reduced it
to a political sandbox.
We are libertarians. By
definition, this means that we will
not attempt to impose our values
on others. The removal of such an
imposition necessitates the
abolition of compulsory student
government.
(Kevin O'Grady, Beth Garfield,
Charles Ogletree, and Jim Friend
reply:)
Campaigning for political
candidates is not the business of
the ASSU. At the same time, we
think it is a misconception to
suggest that the ASSU can be
totally non-political. The role of
the ASSU is to represent the
interests of the students. These
interests occasionally come into
confict with the interests of other
groups both inside and outside the
university.
It is generally agreed that it is a
legitimate role of the ASSU to
represent the interests of the
students in dealings with the
administration and faculty. We
believe that there are also
instances in which it would be

We, the Young Socialists, stand

working class internationally. We
do not, as the other slates do,
begin and end with Stanford
University.
The heart of this irreconcilable
contradiction between their

philosophical. Their politics
reflect the bankrupt methodology

empiricism and pragmatism. We
are armed with the theoretical
essence of Marxism, dialectical
materialism.
It has only been through a
conscious daily fight for Marxism
that our movement has been able
to understand the nature of the
international crisis of capitalism
and the tasks that are posed: the
building of a labor party within
the working class pledged to
socialist policies and the
construction of a mass
revolutionary youth movement,
the Young Socialists, to carry
these tasks forward. It is only the
Young Socialists who will be able
to defend the right to an
education for working class youth
by fighting against the budget cuts
and constructing the absolutely
crucial revolutionary leadership.
We urge all those who agree

our campaign and help build the
Young Socialists at Stanford.

The second question: Should
the ASSU be used as a vehicle for
political advocacy and action — or
should the Council of Presidents
avoid the political arena?
(Judy Cans and Buzz
Thompson reply:)
The ASSU has no business
crusading for political causes on
behalf of others. We intend to
keep our mouths strictly shut —
to speak at no rallies, sponsor no
causes, lobby for no interest
groups. We speak for ourselves,

and make no claim to represent
anyone else.
Our position on this matter is
based on principle, not utility. We
do not oppose political activism
"because it doesn't work very
well" as another slate has
suggested. We oppose it because
we have no right to speak for
others.
This applies not only to
outside issues but also to internal
affairs. It is precisely this struggle
among student interest groups at
Stanford — a struggle which is
reflected in the makeup of most
of the other slates — which
torpedoed whatever effectiveness
the ASSU ever had, and reduced it
to a political sandbox.
We are libertarians. By
definition, this means that we will
not attempt to impose our values
on others. The removal of such an
imposition necessitates the
abolition of compulsory student
government.
(Kevin O'Grady, Beth Garfield,
Charles Ogletree, and Jim Friend

Campaigning for political
candidates is not the business of
the ASSU. At the same time, we
think it is a misconception to
suggest that the ASSU can be
totally non-political. The role of
the ASSU is to represent the
interests of the students. These
interests occasionally come into
confict with the interests of other
groups both inside and outside the
university.
It is generally agreed that it is a
legitimate role of the ASSU to
represent the interests of the
students in dealings with the
administration and faculty. We
believe that there are also
instances in which it would be
proper for an ASSU officer to
defend the interests of students in
dealings with groups outside the
university.
For example, in the coming
year, there will be a number of
important decisions made in
Washington and Sacramento
regarding the future of student
loan programs. As the ASSU
Council of Presidents, we would
consider it our legitimate function
to keep students informed about
developments pertaining to this
issue, and even to suggest ways in
which students could influence
the decisions to be made.
On a practical level, we realize
that the ability of ASSU officers
to affect decision-making
processes outside the university is
limited. Correspondingly, we feel
that this endeavor should not be
emphasized at the expense of
efforts in the areas of education,
student services, and university
governance.

Anderson, Tom Flohr, and

ASSU officers have only one
function — to serve the students
of Stanford University. It is
foolish for them to become
involved in outside political issues,
because the effect they can have
on state and national politics is
close to nil. In the past four or
five years, the sole result of ASSU
involvement in outside political
issues has been a lack of action in
the areas where student officers
can have real influence and impact
—. providing services and
advocating student interests
within the University.
Only the ASSU can provide
valuable services to Stanford
students on an inexpensive,
non-profit basis. We have
proposed realistic programs to
expand and improve such services
as concerts, speakers, the Course
Review, and the Sunday Flicks.
The ASSU can also serve as an
advocate for changes benefiting
students. While ASSU officers
have no direct power to make
changes in areas such as
educational reform, tuition rates,
and judicial reform, they have the
duty to use their positions of
pseudo-legitimacy to make
realistic proposals for change and
to try to persuade and push into
action those who do have the
power — the administration and
the faculty.
(Fred Choate and Ed Ryu
reply:)
We, the Young Socialists, are
running this campaign in order to
bring our perspectives to masses
of people as part of the task of
building the leadership for
workers and youth as they enter
into a period of tremendous
struggle.
This means that we view the
role that students can and must
play as absolutely critical in the
upcoming period. Any attempt to
turn the ASSU or any student or
working class organization away
from the international political
crisis is an attempt to prepare the
destruction of millions as Nixon
and the capitalists internationally
make open preparations for civil
war and dictatorship.
The present ASSU election is a
clear reflection of the theoretical
and practical bankrupcy of the
other slates N as they openly deny
the importance of political
questions and consequently
cannot even address themselves to
such burning issues as Nixon's
disastrous budget cuts. To avoid
these issues means to deny the
reality of the outside world and
especially to deny the ability of
students to effectively intervene

to change what is taking place.
It is our perspective that,
armed with an objective
understanding of the international
crisis of capitalism, students must
begin to defend workers and
working class youth by joining the
Young Socialists and fighting to
build a labor party pledged to

socialist policies. As Presidents of
the ASSU, we will use the office
to carry out this perspective.

Tomorrow: the candidates'
answers to questions on ASSU
finances and education.

In order to better inform our
readers of the positions and
platforms of the candidates for
this week's ASSU presidential
election, the Daily has invited all
slates to respond to a series of
four questions. Today, the
candidates' answers to questions
on their qualifications and their
views of the political dimension of
the office they seek.
Qualifications
The first question: What
specifically distinguishes your
slate, in terms of ability and
experience, from the others? What
in damnation makes you believe
you can do a better job than
anybody else?
(Judy Gans and Buzz
Thompson reply:)
We are the only slate to favor
the abolition of the ASSU as it
presently exists. We join a diverse
group of individuals which
includes Chris Hocker and former
ASSU President Larry Diamond in
urging that the ASSU be made
voluntary — only those who desire
its services should have to pay for
it.
We are not vying for the
opportunity to spend the ASSU
fund of $92,000. Instead, we seek
ways to return that money to the
students. If, after students are
given the option of whether or
not to pay for a student
government, they decide to retain
an ASSU, we have no objection.
But that decision should be
individual and voluntary, not
collective and coerced.
The illusion of a viable student
government has plagued Stanford
for years. It would be laughable if
it were not so expensive.
Individuals and groups are far
more capable of implementing
change which affects them
without the inherent bureaucracy
of the ASSU. A cursory
examination of the ASSU budget
reveals a horrendous waste of
resources — from the $5,000 bill
for telephones to the entire
banking operation which is costly
and cumbersome, and could be
handled far more easily by private
banks.
We are not "experienced" in
the sense of having a stake in the
ASSU. By nature, we are neither
bureaucrats nor politicians. We
can't afford thousands of slick,
expensive leaflets which prove
how "committed" we are.
In short, we run because we
prefer the establishment of reality
to the perpetuation of a myth.
(Kevin O'Grady, Beth Garfield,
Charles Ogletree, and Jim Friend
reply:)
The O'Grady-Garfield-Ogletree-
Friend slate would bring to the
ASSU a diversity of backgrounds

and abilities essential to an
effective ASSU.
Beth Garfield and Charles
Ogletree have had experience as
ASSU Senators and have worked
extensively within the University
committee system. Garfield
organized the successful childcare
initiative last spring and this year
organized the womens' speakers
bureau. Ogletree is chairman of
the Black Students Union and
editor of the Real News. They
have proven that they can be
effective within the University
structure.
Kevin O'Grady and Jim Friend,
as organizers of the McGovern and
McCloskey campaigns, have
worked closely with students
throughout the residence system
and in the graduate schools. Their
organizational ability could bring
to the ASSU the broad base that
it has lacked in the past.
The concept of a council of
presidents affords the opportunity
to bring together persons of
differing backgrounds and
perspectives. This year's Council
of Presidents has been
handicapped in its ability to deal
with the problems of many
important constituencies on
campus. Our slate has
demonstrated its concern with the
interests of all major student
constituencies.
There is no guarantee that a
diverse slate will be able to involve
all the different constituencies.
The homogeneity of the Van
Petten slate, however, shows a
lack of concern for the problems
of many persons and groups at
Stanford.
The O'Grady-Garfield-Ogletree-
Friend slate, on the other hand,
has the experience in student
government, the necessary rapport
with crucial student
constituencies, and the experience
in campus-wide organizations that
could make the ASSU into a
responsive and effective student
government.
(Peter Van Petten, Jim
Anderson, Tom Flohr, and
Charles "Buck" Schott reply:)
The members of our slate
represent a broad range of student
interests and concerns. In our
years at Stanford we have worked
in nearly every area of importance
at the University — educational
reform, concerts, judicial reform,
student services, committee
appointments, fundraising, and
Tresidder Union.

The O'Grady-Garfield-Ogletree-
Friend slate would bring to the
ASSU a diversity of backgrounds

and abilities essential to an
effective ASSU.
Beth Garfield and Charles
Ogletree have had experience as
ASSU Senators and have worked
extensively within the University
committee system. Garfield
organized the successful childcare
initiative last spring and this year
organized the womens' speakers
bureau. Ogletree is chairman of
the Black Students Union and
editor of the Real News. They
have proven that they can be
effective within the University
structure.
Kevin O'Grady and Jim Friend,
as organizers of the McGovern and
McCloskey campaigns, have
worked closely with students
throughout the residence system
and in the graduate schools. Their
organizational ability could bring
to the ASSU the broad base that
it has lacked in the past.
The concept of a council of
presidents affords the opportunity
to bring together persons of
differing backgrounds and
perspectives. This year's Council
of Presidents has been
handicapped in its ability to deal
with the problems of many
important constituencies on
campus. Our slate has
demonstrated its concern with the
interests of all major student
constituencies.
There is no guarantee that a
diverse slate will be able to involve
all the different constituencies.
The homogeneity of the Van
Petten slate, however, shows a
lack of concern for the problems
of many persons and groups at
Stanford.
The O'Grady-Garfield-Ogletree-
Friend slate, on the other hand,
has the experience in student
government, the necessary rapport
with crucial student
constituencies, and the experience
in campus-wide organizations that
could make the ASSU into a
responsive and effective student
government.

Anderson, Tom Flohr, and

The members of our slate
represent a broad range of student
interests and concerns. In our
years at Stanford we have worked
in nearly every area of importance
at the University — educational
reform, concerts, judicial reform,
student services, committee
appointments, fundraising, and
Tresidder Union.
Our interest and commitment
to change at the University, and
our efforts to make it a better
place, are of long standing. The
concern for students and the
University now demonstrated by
our opponents is highly suspect

for it is of very recent vintage.
Our perception of the purpose
of the ASSU and the function of
its officers is to seek to improve
the lives of students at Stanford.
This view contrasts sharply with
the other candidates, who are
either joke candidates, ideologues
who intend to use the position to

sudden interest in the University

We, the Young Socialists, stand

The heart of this irreconcilable

It has only been through a

international crisis of capitalism

building of a labor party within
the working class pledged to
socialist policies and the
construction of a mass

the Young Socialists, to carry
these tasks forward. It is only the
Young Socialists who will be able
to defend the right to an

The second question: Should
the ASSU be used as a vehicle for
political advocacy and action — or
should the Council of Presidents
avoid the political arena?
(Judy Cans and Buzz
Thompson reply:)
The ASSU has no business
crusading for political causes on
behalf of others. We intend to
keep our mouths strictly shut —
to speak at no rallies, sponsor no
causes, lobby for no interest
groups. We speak for ourselves,

and make no claim to represent
anyone else.
Our position on this matter is
based on principle, not utility. We
do not oppose political activism
"because it doesn't work very
well" as another slate has
suggested. We oppose it because
we have no right to speak for
others.
This applies not only to
outside issues but also to internal
affairs. It is precisely this struggle
among student interest groups at
Stanford — a struggle which is
reflected in the makeup of most
of the other slates — which
torpedoed whatever effectiveness
the ASSU ever had, and reduced it
to a political sandbox.
We are libertarians. By
definition, this means that we will
not attempt to impose our values
on others. The removal of such an
imposition necessitates the
abolition of compulsory student
government.
(Kevin O'Grady, Beth Garfield,
Charles Ogletree, and Jim Friend
reply:)
Campaigning for political
candidates is not the business of
the ASSU. At the same time, we
think it is a misconception to
suggest that the ASSU can be
totally non-political. The role of
the ASSU is to represent the
interests of the students. These
interests occasionally come into
confict with the interests of other
groups both inside and outside the
university.
It is generally agreed that it is a
legitimate role of the ASSU to
represent the interests of the
students in dealings with the
administration and faculty. We
believe that there are also
instances in which it would be
proper for an ASSU officer to
defend the interests of students in
dealings with groups outside the
university.
For example, in the coming
year, there will be a number of
important decisions made in
Washington and Sacramento
regarding the future of student
loan programs. As the ASSU
Council of Presidents, we would
consider it our legitimate function
to keep students informed about
developments pertaining to this
issue, and even to suggest ways in
which students could influence
the decisions to be made.
On a practical level, we realize
that the ability of ASSU officers
to affect decision-making
processes outside the university is
limited. Correspondingly, we feel
that this endeavor should not be
emphasized at the expense of
efforts in the areas of education,
student services, and university
governance.

(Peter Van Petten, Jim
Anderson, Tom Flohr, and
Charles "Buck" Schott reply:)
ASSU officers have only one
function — to serve the students
of Stanford University. It is
foolish for them to become
involved in outside political issues,
because the effect they can have
on state and national politics is
close to nil. In the past four or
five years, the sole result of ASSU
involvement in outside political
issues has been a lack of action in
the areas where student officers
can have real influence and impact
—. providing services and
advocating student interests
within the University.
Only the ASSU can provide
valuable services to Stanford
students on an inexpensive,
non-profit basis. We have
proposed realistic programs to
expand and improve such services
as concerts, speakers, the Course
Review, and the Sunday Flicks.
The ASSU can also serve as an
advocate for changes benefiting
students. While ASSU officers
have no direct power to make
changes in areas such as
educational reform, tuition rates,
and judicial reform, they have the
duty to use their positions of
pseudo-legitimacy to make
realistic proposals for change and
to try to persuade and push into
action those who do have the
power — the administration and
the faculty.
(Fred Choate and Ed Ryu
reply:)
We, the Young Socialists, are
running this campaign in order to
bring our perspectives to masses
of people as part of the task of
building the leadership for
workers and youth as they enter
into a period of tremendous
struggle.
This means that we view the
role that students can and must
play as absolutely critical in the
upcoming period. Any attempt to
turn the ASSU or any student or
working class organization away
from the international political
crisis is an attempt to prepare the
destruction of millions as Nixon
and the capitalists internationally
make open preparations for civil
war and dictatorship.
The present ASSU election is a
clear reflection of the theoretical
and practical bankrupcy of the
other slates N as they openly deny
the importance of political
questions and consequently
cannot even address themselves to
such burning issues as Nixon's
disastrous budget cuts. To avoid
these issues means to deny the
reality of the outside world and
especially to deny the ability of
students to effectively intervene

to change what is taking place.
It is our perspective that,
armed with an objective
understanding of the international
crisis of capitalism, students must
begin to defend workers and
working class youth by joining the
Young Socialists and fighting to
build a labor party pledged to

socialist policies. As Presidents of
the ASSU, we will use the office
to carry out this perspective.
No statements were received

answers to questions on ASSU
finances and education.

In order to better inform our
readers of the positions and

election, the Daily has invited all
slates to respond to a series of
four questions. Today, the
candidates' answers to questions
on their qualifications and their
views of the political dimension of
the office they seek.
Qualifications
The first question: What
specifically distinguishes your
slate, in terms of ability and
experience, from the others? What
in damnation makes you believe
you can do a better job than
anybody else?

that the ability of ASSU officers
to affect decision-making
processes outside the university is
limited. Correspondingly, we feel

student services, and university
governance.

ASSU officers have only one
function — to serve the students
of Stanford University. It is
foolish for them to become
involved in outside political issues,
because the effect they can have
on state and national politics is
close to nil. In the past four or
five years, the sole result of ASSU
involvement in outside political
issues has been a lack of action in
the areas where student officers
can have real influence and impact
—. providing services and
advocating student interests
within the University.
Only the ASSU can provide
valuable services to Stanford
students on an inexpensive,
non-profit basis. We have
proposed realistic programs to
expand and improve such services
as concerts, speakers, the Course
Review, and the Sunday Flicks.
The ASSU can also serve as an
advocate for changes benefiting
students. While ASSU officers
have no direct power to make
changes in areas such as
educational reform, tuition rates,
and judicial reform, they have the
duty to use their positions of
pseudo-legitimacy to make
realistic proposals for change and
to try to persuade and push into
action those who do have the
power — the administration and
the faculty.
(Fred Choate and Ed Ryu
reply:)
We, the Young Socialists, are
running this campaign in order to
bring our perspectives to masses
of people as part of the task of
building the leadership for
workers and youth as they enter
into a period of tremendous
struggle.
This means that we view the
role that students can and must
play as absolutely critical in the
upcoming period. Any attempt to
turn the ASSU or any student or
working class organization away
from the international political
crisis is an attempt to prepare the
destruction of millions as Nixon
and the capitalists internationally
make open preparations for civil
war and dictatorship.
The present ASSU election is a
clear reflection of the theoretical
and practical bankrupcy of the
other slates N as they openly deny
the importance of political
questions and consequently
cannot even address themselves to
such burning issues as Nixon's
disastrous budget cuts. To avoid
these issues means to deny the
reality of the outside world and
especially to deny the ability of
students to effectively intervene

to change what is taking place.
It is our perspective that,
armed with an objective
understanding of the international
crisis of capitalism, students must
begin to defend workers and
working class youth by joining the
Young Socialists and fighting to
build a labor party pledged to

socialist policies. As Presidents of
the ASSU, we will use the office
to carry out this perspective.

Tomorrow: the candidates'
answers to questions on ASSU
finances and education.

In order to better inform our
readers of the positions and
platforms of the candidates for
this week's ASSU presidential
election, the Daily has invited all
slates to respond to a series of
four questions. Today, the
candidates' answers to questions
on their qualifications and their
views of the political dimension of
the office they seek.
Qualifications
The first question: What
specifically distinguishes your
slate, in terms of ability and
experience, from the others? What
in damnation makes you believe
you can do a better job than
anybody else?
(Judy Gans and Buzz
Thompson reply:)
We are the only slate to favor
the abolition of the ASSU as it
presently exists. We join a diverse
group of individuals which
includes Chris Hocker and former
ASSU President Larry Diamond in
urging that the ASSU be made
voluntary — only those who desire
its services should have to pay for
it.
We are not vying for the
opportunity to spend the ASSU
fund of $92,000. Instead, we seek
ways to return that money to the
students. If, after students are
given the option of whether or
not to pay for a student
government, they decide to retain
an ASSU, we have no objection.
But that decision should be
individual and voluntary, not
collective and coerced.
The illusion of a viable student
government has plagued Stanford
for years. It would be laughable if
it were not so expensive.
Individuals and groups are far
more capable of implementing
change which affects them
without the inherent bureaucracy
of the ASSU. A cursory
examination of the ASSU budget
reveals a horrendous waste of
resources — from the $5,000 bill
for telephones to the entire
banking operation which is costly
and cumbersome, and could be
handled far more easily by private
banks.
We are not "experienced" in
the sense of having a stake in the
ASSU. By nature, we are neither
bureaucrats nor politicians. We
can't afford thousands of slick,
expensive leaflets which prove
how "committed" we are.
In short, we run because we
prefer the establishment of reality
to the perpetuation of a myth.
(Kevin O'Grady, Beth Garfield,
Charles Ogletree, and Jim Friend
reply:)
The O'Grady-Garfield-Ogletree-
Friend slate would bring to the
ASSU a diversity of backgrounds

and abilities essential to an
effective ASSU.
Beth Garfield and Charles
Ogletree have had experience as
ASSU Senators and have worked
extensively within the University
committee system. Garfield
organized the successful childcare
initiative last spring and this year
organized the womens' speakers
bureau. Ogletree is chairman of
the Black Students Union and
editor of the Real News. They
have proven that they can be
effective within the University
structure.
Kevin O'Grady and Jim Friend,
as organizers of the McGovern and
McCloskey campaigns, have
worked closely with students
throughout the residence system
and in the graduate schools. Their
organizational ability could bring
to the ASSU the broad base that
it has lacked in the past.
The concept of a council of
presidents affords the opportunity
to bring together persons of
differing backgrounds and
perspectives. This year's Council
of Presidents has been
handicapped in its ability to deal
with the problems of many
important constituencies on
campus. Our slate has
demonstrated its concern with the
interests of all major student
constituencies.
There is no guarantee that a
diverse slate will be able to involve
all the different constituencies.
The homogeneity of the Van
Petten slate, however, shows a
lack of concern for the problems
of many persons and groups at
Stanford.
The O'Grady-Garfield-Ogletree-
Friend slate, on the other hand,
has the experience in student
government, the necessary rapport
with crucial student
constituencies, and the experience
in campus-wide organizations that
could make the ASSU into a
responsive and effective student
government.
(Peter Van Petten, Jim
Anderson, Tom Flohr, and
Charles "Buck" Schott reply:)
The members of our slate
represent a broad range of student
interests and concerns. In our
years at Stanford we have worked
in nearly every area of importance
at the University — educational
reform, concerts, judicial reform,
student services, committee
appointments, fundraising, and
Tresidder Union.
Our interest and commitment
to change at the University, and
our efforts to make it a better
place, are of long standing. The
concern for students and the
University now demonstrated by
our opponents is highly suspect

for it is of very recent vintage.
Our perception of the purpose
of the ASSU and the function of
its officers is to seek to improve
the lives of students at Stanford.
This view contrasts sharply with
the other candidates, who are
either joke candidates, ideologues
who intend to use the position to
publicize their political
philosophies, or representatives of
special interest groups whose
sudden interest in the University
and student services is the obvious
result of the candidacy for the
ASSU Presidency.
(Fred Choate and Ed Ryu
reply:)
We, the Young Socialists, stand
in complete opposition to the
other slates in that we take as our
starting point the needs of the
working class internationally. We
do not, as the other slates do,
begin and end with Stanford
University.
The heart of this irreconcilable
contradiction between their
perspectives and ours is deeply
philosophical. Their politics
reflect the bankrupt methodology
of the capitalist class: skepticism,
empiricism and pragmatism. We
are armed with the theoretical
essence of Marxism, dialectical
materialism.
It has only been through a
conscious daily fight for Marxism
that our movement has been able
to understand the nature of the
international crisis of capitalism
and the tasks that are posed: the
building of a labor party within
the working class pledged to
socialist policies and the
construction of a mass
revolutionary youth movement,
the Young Socialists, to carry
these tasks forward. It is only the
Young Socialists who will be able
to defend the right to an
education for working class youth
by fighting against the budget cuts
and constructing the absolutely
crucial revolutionary leadership.
We urge all those who agree
with our perspectives to support
our campaign and help build the
Young Socialists at Stanford.
Politics
The second question: Should
the ASSU be used as a vehicle for
political advocacy and action — or
should the Council of Presidents
avoid the political arena?
(Judy Cans and Buzz
Thompson reply:)
The ASSU has no business
crusading for political causes on
behalf of others. We intend to
keep our mouths strictly shut —
to speak at no rallies, sponsor no
causes, lobby for no interest
groups. We speak for ourselves,

and make no claim to represent
anyone else.
Our position on this matter is
based on principle, not utility. We
do not oppose political activism
"because it doesn't work very
well" as another slate has
suggested. We oppose it because
we have no right to speak for
others.
This applies not only to
outside issues but also to internal
affairs. It is precisely this struggle
among student interest groups at
Stanford — a struggle which is
reflected in the makeup of most
of the other slates — which
torpedoed whatever effectiveness
the ASSU ever had, and reduced it
to a political sandbox.
We are libertarians. By
definition, this means that we will
not attempt to impose our values
on others. The removal of such an
imposition necessitates the
abolition of compulsory student
government.
(Kevin O'Grady, Beth Garfield,
Charles Ogletree, and Jim Friend
reply:)
Campaigning for political
candidates is not the business of
the ASSU. At the same time, we
think it is a misconception to
suggest that the ASSU can be
totally non-political. The role of
the ASSU is to represent the
interests of the students. These
interests occasionally come into
confict with the interests of other
groups both inside and outside the
university.
It is generally agreed that it is a
legitimate role of the ASSU to
represent the interests of the
students in dealings with the
administration and faculty. We
believe that there are also
instances in which it would be
proper for an ASSU officer to
defend the interests of students in
dealings with groups outside the
university.
For example, in the coming
year, there will be a number of
important decisions made in
Washington and Sacramento
regarding the future of student
loan programs. As the ASSU
Council of Presidents, we would
consider it our legitimate function
to keep students informed about
developments pertaining to this
issue, and even to suggest ways in
which students could influence
the decisions to be made.
On a practical level, we realize
that the ability of ASSU officers
to affect decision-making
processes outside the university is
limited. Correspondingly, we feel
that this endeavor should not be
emphasized at the expense of
efforts in the areas of education,
student services, and university
governance.

We, the Young Socialists, stand
in complete opposition to the
other slates in that we take as our
starting point the needs of the
working class internationally. We
do not, as the other slates do,
begin and end with Stanford
University.
The heart of this irreconcilable
contradiction between their
perspectives and ours is deeply
philosophical. Their politics
reflect the bankrupt methodology
of the capitalist class: skepticism,
empiricism and pragmatism. We
are armed with the theoretical
essence of Marxism, dialectical
materialism.
It has only been through a
conscious daily fight for Marxism
that our movement has been able
to understand the nature of the
international crisis of capitalism
and the tasks that are posed: the
building of a labor party within
the working class pledged to
socialist policies and the
construction of a mass
revolutionary youth movement,
the Young Socialists, to carry
these tasks forward. It is only the
Young Socialists who will be able
to defend the right to an
education for working class youth
by fighting against the budget cuts
and constructing the absolutely
crucial revolutionary leadership.
We urge all those who agree
with our perspectives to support
our campaign and help build the
Young Socialists at Stanford.
Politics
The second question: Should
the ASSU be used as a vehicle for
political advocacy and action — or
should the Council of Presidents
avoid the political arena?
(Judy Cans and Buzz
Thompson reply:)
The ASSU has no business
crusading for political causes on
behalf of others. We intend to
keep our mouths strictly shut —
to speak at no rallies, sponsor no
causes, lobby for no interest
groups. We speak for ourselves,

and make no claim to represent
anyone else.
Our position on this matter is
based on principle, not utility. We
do not oppose political activism
"because it doesn't work very
well" as another slate has
suggested. We oppose it because
we have no right to speak for
others.
This applies not only to
outside issues but also to internal
affairs. It is precisely this struggle
among student interest groups at
Stanford — a struggle which is
reflected in the makeup of most
of the other slates — which
torpedoed whatever effectiveness
the ASSU ever had, and reduced it
to a political sandbox.
We are libertarians. By
definition, this means that we will
not attempt to impose our values
on others. The removal of such an
imposition necessitates the
abolition of compulsory student
government.
(Kevin O'Grady, Beth Garfield,
Charles Ogletree, and Jim Friend
reply:)
Campaigning for political
candidates is not the business of
the ASSU. At the same time, we
think it is a misconception to
suggest that the ASSU can be
totally non-political. The role of
the ASSU is to represent the
interests of the students. These
interests occasionally come into
confict with the interests of other
groups both inside and outside the
university.
It is generally agreed that it is a
legitimate role of the ASSU to
represent the interests of the
students in dealings with the
administration and faculty. We
believe that there are also
instances in which it would be
proper for an ASSU officer to
defend the interests of students in
dealings with groups outside the
university.
For example, in the coming
year, there will be a number of
important decisions made in
Washington and Sacramento
regarding the future of student
loan programs. As the ASSU
Council of Presidents, we would
consider it our legitimate function
to keep students informed about
developments pertaining to this
issue, and even to suggest ways in
which students could influence
the decisions to be made.
On a practical level, we realize
that the ability of ASSU officers
to affect decision-making
processes outside the university is
limited. Correspondingly, we feel
that this endeavor should not be
emphasized at the expense of
efforts in the areas of education,
student services, and university
governance.

(Peter Van Petten, Jim
Anderson, Tom Flohr, and
Charles "Buck" Schott reply:)
ASSU officers have only one
function — to serve the students
of Stanford University. It is
foolish for them to become
involved in outside political issues,
because the effect they can have
on state and national politics is
close to nil. In the past four or
five years, the sole result of ASSU
involvement in outside political
issues has been a lack of action in
the areas where student officers
can have real influence and impact
—. providing services and
advocating student interests
within the University.
Only the ASSU can provide
valuable services to Stanford
students on an inexpensive,
non-profit basis. We have
proposed realistic programs to
expand and improve such services
as concerts, speakers, the Course
Review, and the Sunday Flicks.
The ASSU can also serve as an
advocate for changes benefiting
students. While ASSU officers
have no direct power to make
changes in areas such as
educational reform, tuition rates,
and judicial reform, they have the
duty to use their positions of
pseudo-legitimacy to make
realistic proposals for change and
to try to persuade and push into
action those who do have the
power — the administration and
the faculty.
(Fred Choate and Ed Ryu
reply:)
We, the Young Socialists, are
running this campaign in order to
bring our perspectives to masses
of people as part of the task of
building the leadership for
workers and youth as they enter
into a period of tremendous
struggle.
This means that we view the
role that students can and must
play as absolutely critical in the
upcoming period. Any attempt to
turn the ASSU or any student or
working class organization away
from the international political
crisis is an attempt to prepare the
destruction of millions as Nixon
and the capitalists internationally
make open preparations for civil
war and dictatorship.
The present ASSU election is a
clear reflection of the theoretical
and practical bankrupcy of the
other slates N as they openly deny
the importance of political
questions and consequently
cannot even address themselves to
such burning issues as Nixon's
disastrous budget cuts. To avoid
these issues means to deny the
reality of the outside world and
especially to deny the ability of
students to effectively intervene

to change what is taking place.
It is our perspective that,
armed with an objective
understanding of the international
crisis of capitalism, students must
begin to defend workers and
working class youth by joining the
Young Socialists and fighting to
build a labor party pledged to

socialist policies. As Presidents of
the ASSU, we will use the office
to carry out this perspective.
