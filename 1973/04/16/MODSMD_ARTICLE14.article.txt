During Autumn and Winter Quarters 1972-73, the
Campus Judicial Panel (CJP) and the Dean of Student
Affairs (DOSA) considered charged brought against eight
students in connection with six cases involving alleged
violations of University student conduct regulations.
Four of these cases, involving six individuals, were con
sidered by the CJP, and the remaining two cases were
handled by the Dean of Student Affairs. In addition,
there is one case involving two individuals currently
pending before the CJP.
Cases Brought Before the CJP
1. CJP Case No. 101, October 29, 1972, Use of
Forged Meal Label. One student was charged by the
University Administration with a violation of the Funda
mental Standard for knowingly using a forged meal label
attached to his student identification card in order to get
food without paying for it. On February 1, 1973, the
case was heard by a Hearing Officer who found that the
defendant had committed the acts charged. Based on
these findings, the CJP concluded that the student had
violated the Fundamental Standard as charged and
recommended that the student be suspended for one
quarter. This recommendation was approved by the Pres
ident. The full text of the CJP opinion follows.
2. CJP Case No. 102, January 22, 1973, Misuse of
Meal Card. The University Administration charged one

student with violations of the Fundamental Standard for
knowingly using the student identification card of
another to obtain meals without paying for them, and
obtaining meals without paying for them by presenting
his own student identification card and a meal label to
which he knew he was not entitled. The defendant
stipulated that the charges filed against him were true,
and on February 12, 1973, the case was argued before
the CJP on the issue of penalty. The CJP recommended
that the defendant be suspended for one quarter, but on
the finding of "compelling, unique circumstances"
recommended suspending imposition of the suspension
sanction on condition that the defendant not violate the
Fundamental Standard during the remainder of his
undergraduate career at the University and that the
defendant pay the sum of $100 to the University. These
recommendations were approved by the President. Ex
cerpts from CJP Case No. 102 follow.
"As to the offense charged, we are convinced that
the repetitive series of thefts by false pretenses where
by the defendant obtained meals to which he was not
entitled would normally justify suspension.. .
3. CJP Case No. 103, May 15, 1972, Misappropria
tion of Checks. The University Administration charged
one individual with violations of the Fundamental
Standard for knowingly misappropriating to his own use
the proceeds of three University checks made payable to
a third party. On March 12, 1973, the case was heard by
a Hearing Officer who concluded that the University had

not proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the defend
ant, at the time he appropriated the proceeds of the
checks to his own use, knew of his responsibility to
deliver the checks to the third party rather than using
them himself. Accordingly, the University dismissed the
charges against this individual. The full text of the CJP
opinion follows.
4. CJP Case No. 104, December 13, 1972, Cheating.
The University Administration charged three students
with a violation of the Honor Code for giving and/or
receiving unauthorized aid in the final examination for
Engineering-Economic Systems Course 221. The three
defendants and the University entered into a joint stipu
lation of facts, and on March 18, 1973, the matter was
aruged before the CJP on the issue of sanction. In a
lengthy opinion the CJP established that Honor Code
violations within the University are regarded as extreme
ly serious offenses for which the normal penalty should
be separation from the University. Recognizing the fact
that in the last four years no student had been sus
pended for a first violation of the Honor Code, and
believing that it would be unfair to apply retroactively a
change in a long-standing pattern of previous sanctions,
the CJP, with the consent of the Instructor, recom
mended that each of the three defendants be suspended
for one quarter but that the suspensions be themselves
suspended on condition that they receive no academic
credit for the course involved. This recommendation was

approved by the President. The full text of the CJP
opinion follows.
Cases Adjudicated by the Dean of Student Affairs
1. DOSA Case No. 22, November 16, 1972, Plagia
rism. The University Administration charged one student
with a violation of the Honor Code for submitting a
take-home essay in which the student had copied at
length from published material. The paper contains no
suggestion that any material in it was obtained from
some other source-no footnote, quotation marks, or
explanatory note. The student requested that the case be
heard by the Dean of Student Affairs who agreed to do
so. The Dean heard the case in November and December
1972 and, with the consent of the professor instructing
the course, recommended that the student receive no
credit for the course. This recommendation was ap
proved by the acting President.
2. DOSA Case No. 23, February 3, 1973, Theft. The
University Administration charged one student with a
violation of the Fundamental Standard for knowingly
taking without authority a street sign. The sign was
immediately recovered. The student requested that the
case be heard by the Dean of Student Affairs who agreed
to do so. The student agreed to assist the University in
repairing damages to certain University buildings, and
the Dean of Student Affairs recommended that no
further action be taken. This recommendation was
approved by the President.

Cases Brought Before the CJP
1. CJP Case No. 101, October 29, 1972, Use of
Forged Meal Label. One student was charged by the
University Administration with a violation of the Funda
mental Standard for knowingly using a forged meal label
attached to his student identification card in order to get
food without paying for it. On February 1, 1973, the
case was heard by a Hearing Officer who found that the
defendant had committed the acts charged. Based on
these findings, the CJP concluded that the student had
violated the Fundamental Standard as charged and
recommended that the student be suspended for one
quarter. This recommendation was approved by the Pres
ident. The full text of the CJP opinion follows.
2. CJP Case No. 102, January 22, 1973, Misuse of
Meal Card. The University Administration charged one

student with violations of the Fundamental Standard for
knowingly using the student identification card of
another to obtain meals without paying for them, and
obtaining meals without paying for them by presenting
his own student identification card and a meal label to
which he knew he was not entitled. The defendant
stipulated that the charges filed against him were true,
and on February 12, 1973, the case was argued before
the CJP on the issue of penalty. The CJP recommended
that the defendant be suspended for one quarter, but on
the finding of "compelling, unique circumstances"
recommended suspending imposition of the suspension
sanction on condition that the defendant not violate the
Fundamental Standard during the remainder of his
undergraduate career at the University and that the
defendant pay the sum of $100 to the University. These
recommendations were approved by the President. Ex
cerpts from CJP Case No. 102 follow.
"As to the offense charged, we are convinced that
the repetitive series of thefts by false pretenses where
by the defendant obtained meals to which he was not
entitled would normally justify suspension.. .
3. CJP Case No. 103, May 15, 1972, Misappropria
tion of Checks. The University Administration charged
one individual with violations of the Fundamental
Standard for knowingly misappropriating to his own use
the proceeds of three University checks made payable to
a third party. On March 12, 1973, the case was heard by
a Hearing Officer who concluded that the University had

not proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the defend
ant, at the time he appropriated the proceeds of the
checks to his own use, knew of his responsibility to
deliver the checks to the third party rather than using
them himself. Accordingly, the University dismissed the
charges against this individual. The full text of the CJP
opinion follows.
4. CJP Case No. 104, December 13, 1972, Cheating.
The University Administration charged three students
with a violation of the Honor Code for giving and/or
receiving unauthorized aid in the final examination for
Engineering-Economic Systems Course 221. The three
defendants and the University entered into a joint stipu
lation of facts, and on March 18, 1973, the matter was
aruged before the CJP on the issue of sanction. In a
lengthy opinion the CJP established that Honor Code
violations within the University are regarded as extreme
ly serious offenses for which the normal penalty should
be separation from the University. Recognizing the fact
that in the last four years no student had been sus
pended for a first violation of the Honor Code, and
believing that it would be unfair to apply retroactively a
change in a long-standing pattern of previous sanctions,
the CJP, with the consent of the Instructor, recom

3. CJP Case No. 103, May 15, 1972, Misappropria
tion of Checks. The University Administration charged
one individual with violations of the Fundamental
Standard for knowingly misappropriating to his own use
the proceeds of three University checks made payable to
a third party. On March 12, 1973, the case was heard by
a Hearing Officer who concluded that the University had

not proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the defend
ant, at the time he appropriated the proceeds of the
checks to his own use, knew of his responsibility to
deliver the checks to the third party rather than using
them himself. Accordingly, the University dismissed the
charges against this individual. The full text of the CJP
opinion follows.
4. CJP Case No. 104, December 13, 1972, Cheating.
The University Administration charged three students
with a violation of the Honor Code for giving and/or
receiving unauthorized aid in the final examination for
Engineering-Economic Systems Course 221. The three
defendants and the University entered into a joint stipu
lation of facts, and on March 18, 1973, the matter was
aruged before the CJP on the issue of sanction. In a
lengthy opinion the CJP established that Honor Code
violations within the University are regarded as extreme
ly serious offenses for which the normal penalty should
be separation from the University. Recognizing the fact
that in the last four years no student had been sus
pended for a first violation of the Honor Code, and
believing that it would be unfair to apply retroactively a
change in a long-standing pattern of previous sanctions,
the CJP, with the consent of the Instructor, recom
mended that each of the three defendants be suspended
for one quarter but that the suspensions be themselves
suspended on condition that they receive no academic
credit for the course involved. This recommendation was

approved by the President. The full text of the CJP
opinion follows.

entitled would normally justify suspension.. .
