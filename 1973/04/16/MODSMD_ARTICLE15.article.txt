In re S C.J.P.CaseNo. 101
The defendant was charged with presenting a forged
meal label attached to his student identification card,
and obtaining a meal with the forged card.
After an open hearing before the hearing officer, it
was found that the defendant had committed the acts
charged. At the hearing before us, the defendant stated
he had purchased the forged label for a "low price" two
or three weeks before the date of the offense, and had
used it five or six times.
As we said last year (C.J.P. Case No. 85), the issue of
penalty is determined by considering two factors: "the
significance that the community should attach to this
offense" and"the appropriateness for the defendant of a
particular sanction."
With reference to the offense charged, we are con
vinced that it is serious. The defendant engaged in a
series of thefts by false pretenses whereby he obtained a
series of meals to which he was not entitled. Without
reference to the element of forgery, this would be an
offense which would normally justify suspension.
Theft, particularly theft by false pretenses, is a seri
ous offense in a University whose fundamental standard
enjoins "such respect for.. .personal honor as is de
manded of good citizens." This case is, of course, aggra
vated by the element of forgery.
Defendant and his counsel have argued to us that this
case is less serious than two cases last year (C.J.P. Cases
Nos. 85 and 88) in that the defendant did not himself
prepare the forged document, but purchased it.
*We find this distinction unpersuasive. A short answer
might be that knowing presentation of a forged docu
ment for personal gain is as serious as the forgery itself.
Moreover, defendant did not simply find the forged meal
sticker—he purchased it.
Even after it was purchased, it was necessary to affix
it to his student identification card and simulate the
embossing which the University superimposes over the
label and card. If we accepted the defendant's argument,
however, it would be offset by the fact that this case is
more serious than last year's forgery cases in that there is
present here the element of personal gain.
(In last year's two cases, that element was absent. In
one case, the defendant forged a registration hold card,
but we determined he did not intend to permanently
evade the debt for which the hold had been placed. In
the other case, the defendant forged registration materi
als to obtain football tickets to which he was not en
titled-but he intended to pay for the tickets.)
Defendant has argued that personal gain was not a
primary motive in his case, as he simply viewed the
forged meal label as a convenience which made it possi
ble for him to eat with his friends when he was on
campus at meal times. This argument we find to be
unpersuasive.
Defendant could have eaten with his friends at Uni
versity meal services if he had paid for his meals
something the defendant had no intention to do. How
ever the defendant now characterizes his motives, he
obtained the meal label for personal gain, and so used it
to obtain food without paying for it.
The defendant's statement that the forged meal label
was a "convenience" leads into the second, and in this
case most troubling, element of our decision—the appro
priateness for the defendant of the particular sanction.
The defendant told us that he could not characterize
his conduct as wrongful, and candidly stated he would
do the same thing again if there was no chance that he
would be caught. There is no case for mitigation of the
normal sanction which would be imposed for the de
fendant's offense.
The panel recommends that the defendant be sus
pended for the spring quarter.

Separate Statement C.J.P.CaseNo. 101
We have joined in the panel's opinion and we agree
with it as far as it goes. However, we think that the
appropriate sanction is suspension for at least two quar
ters.
In the two cases last year, one quarter's suspension
was imposed in two forgery cases, where no element of
personal gain was involved.
Intrinsically, this case warrants a more severe sanc
tion. The contrast between this case and those last year

is amplified by the defendant's attitude in this case
about his offense. In one of last year's two cases, a
quarter's suspension was imposed despite the fact that
the defendant admitted the wrongfulness of his conduct
and had no intention of repeating the offense.
In this case, the addition of the element of personal
gain, and the defendant's statement that he would repeat
the offense if the opportunity presented itself and he
could get away with it, point toward a longer suspen
sion.

In re P CJJ > Case No. 103
The defendant was charged with appropriating to his
own use the proceeds of three University checks made
payable to a fraternity for which he was the Resident
Assistant.
The defendant contended that he was under the mis
taken impression that the checks belonged to him and
represented his compensation as a Resident Assistant.
The case went to hearing before a hearing officer.
Nine persons were called as witnesses, and numerous
exhibits were introduced at the hearing, which lasted
almost 10 hours.
Having taken the case under submission, the hearing
officer submitted elaborate findings of fact concluding
that the University had not proved beyond a reasonable
doubt that the defendant, at the time he deposited the
checks in his own account, knew of his responsibility to
turn the checks over to the fraternitv.
Accordingly, he recommended that the complaint
filed against the defendant be dismissed.
Mr. Gerald M. Halligan, representing the University,
has so moved and the charges are accordingly dismissed.

In re M, C, and G c.jp. case no. 104
The three defendants were charged with violating the
Honor Code in giving or receiving aid in a final examina
tion during the Autumn Quarter, 1972. A hearing before
a hearing officer was scheduled for March 9, 1973. On
March 8, however, a stipulation of facts was entered into
between the defendants and the Administration. The
hearing before us was held March 18.
All the defendants are foreign students, enrolled in
one year Master's programs at Stanford. On the midterm
examination of the course in question, M. received a
median grade, while C. and G. failed.
Prior to the final examination, although they had
been aided in their studying by M., C. and G. were
apprehensive about the possibility of failure. At the
examination itself, M., C. and G. sat together.
There is, however, no evidence that the three de
fendants had, prior to the examination, planned or dis
cussed violation of the Honor Code or that they sat
together to facilitate the copying which later took place.
During the examination, G. copied extensively from
M.'s paper. C., in turn, copied from G. At least by the
time the third of four problems was reached, M. was
aware that G was copying from him. He did nothing to
prevent that copying.
Indeed, when G. said to M. that the problem was
difficult, M. said "take a look," by which he meant that
G. look at his paper. The copying came to light when
those grading the examination noted common errors
which could only be explained as copying.
I. The Significance of the Offense.
We have been asked to decide this case primarily to
set the standard which should normally apply to Honor
Code violations.
In the preceding four years, we are informed that
neither our predecessor, the S.J.C., nor we have adjudi
cated a case where the defendant has been found guilty
of an Honor Code violation.
While we are uncomfortable with the implications of
our role in setting such standards insofar as it may have
unfair ramifications for the defendants before us (see
Part II of this opinion), that responsibility is ours and it
is inescapable in the case before us.
Briefly, we view Honor Code violations as extremely
serious ( gffenses for which the normal penalty should be
separauah from the University. It is appropriate that we
begin witji the verbatim text of the Honor Code:
A. fhe'Honor Code is an undertaking of the stu
dents, individually and collectively:
(1) That they will do their share and take an
active part in seeing to it that others as well as

themselves uphold the spirit and letter of the Honor
Code:
(2) That they will not give or receive aid in
examinations; that they will not give or receive un
permitted aid in class work, in the preparation of
reports, or in any other work that is to be used by the
instructor as the basis of grading.
B. The faculty on its part manifests its confidence
in the honor of its students by refraining from proc
toring examinations or otherwise taking special steps
to prevent the forms of dishonesty mentioned above.
C. Provided that alternative seats are available,
tests will be taken from the classroom only with the
consent of the instructor (adopted by student refer
endum in 1955).
D. The students and the faculty will work to
gether to establish those conditions under which opti
mum academic performance can be reached.
The Honor Code is an undertaking of the students of
scrupulous honesty in their academic work—an integrity
manifested by the faculty's agreement not to proctor or
police the examination process. Widespread failure in
that collective student responsibility can only mean, in
the long run, a return to the practice of proctoring and
rigorously policing examinations and other academic
work. That responsibility prohibits not only the receiv
ing of unauthorized aid during examinations, but giving
it as well. It requires, moreover, that those who are
aware of examination cheating, whether or not they are
participants, report that activity.
Violations of the Honor Code are, among the range of
offenses which come before us, most central to the
educational function of the University. Violations are, of
course, manifestations of dishonesty as in other in
stances of cheating or stealing.
But Honor Code violations go beyond that. They
threaten the very integrity of the University's grading
system, the value of the degrees and other academic
credentials given the vast majority of honest students,
and the integrity of the University's basic academic
processes.
Counsel for M. argued to us that there are a range of
Honor Code violations—not all of them equally serious—
and that the conduct of his client in permitting others,
without prearrangement, to copy from his examination
was in a class with the least serious violations.
We agree with the major premise. There are, of
course, a wide variety of Honor Code violations, and
some of them may not justify separation from the Uni
versity as the normal penalty even in the absence of
mitigating circumstances.
But "giving or receiving aid in examinations" is the
first-mentioned among Honor Code offenses, and among
the most serious. Moreover, in this case, copying was not
a single instance but according to the stipulated facts,
occurred throughout the examination.
In these circumstances, we do not agree that it is
more blessed to give aid than to receive it. The Honor
Code enjoins both giving or receiving aid and draws no
distinction between them. In terms of the nature of the
offense, we believe all defendants were guilty of equiva
lent offenses.
11. The Appropriateness for these Defendants of the
Sanction; Prospective Application.
In Part I of this opinion, we have concluded that the
offense is one that would normally justify suspension.
But we conclude that suspension is inappropriate in
these cases. Our reason for this conclusion should be
noted carefully—for it is a reason that will be absent in
all cases involving future similar conduct.
The Dean of Students was asked by the defendants to
take jurisdiction over their cases. The Dean, as he is
entitled to do under Rule 20 of our procedures, would
not agree to take the case. One reason for his decision
was a desire that the Panel establish guidelines for sanc
tions in cases of this kind.
In doing so in Part I of this opinion, we have not
referred to the pattern of sanctions which has been
applied by the Dean of Students office. But in this Part
of our opinion—applying the sanction to these de
fendants—we were unable to ignore those cases which
the Dean of Students has handled in the past four years.
Wc were told that during that time, no student has
been suspended for an Honor Code violation although
there were cases at least comparable to this one. While
we believe that, for the future, cases such a« this one
should result in suspension, we also believe that sanction
should be applied prospectively only. Upon the publica
tion of this opinion, it should become clear to all what
the normal sanction will be for future cases.

Because the point is an important one, it is wise to
make clear what we do and do not decide. The reason
that we do not recommend imposition of suspension for
these defendants' is that it would be unfair to apply
retroactively a change in a long-standing pattern of pre
vious sanctions.
We are not saying that we will refuse to apply serious
sanctions in any case that is for us one of first impres
sion. Nor are we saying that, in deciding upon the
appropriate sanction in future cases, we are bound by
decisions of the Dean of Students in similar cases.
Here, there was a long-existing and well-established
pattern of decision in the Dean of Students Office for a
particular class of cases. While we think that pattern
should be changed, fairness requires that the change be
prospective only.
We are not aware that there are other comparable
patterns of decision by the Dean of Students. For future
Honor Code cases, this opinion makes clear that former
dispositions by the Dean of Students office are no longer
a safe guide in predicting the likely sanction which will
be applied.
111. The Appropriateness for these Defendants of the
Sanctions; Other Factors in this Case.
While the considerations discussed in Part II of this
opinion would alone warrant our recommendation that
suspension not be imposed, one of the other considera
tions urged by counsel for the defendants had some
weight during our deliberations and should be men
tioned.
All three defendants come from a country where
examination cheating in the university is dealt with by
the instructor, and if detected does not result in a
sanction that goes beyond the course in question.
While the defendants were aware of the Honor Code,
and none harbored the sentiment that examination
cheating was appropriate behavior, all claimed to be
unaware that cases of this kind could be handled by a
University body other than the instructor or could result
in sanctions that would go beyond the course in ques
tion.
We would hope that, in the future, material mailed to
new foreign students will make clear the C.J .P. and Dean
of Students' procedures that may be employed for
Honor Code violations and the range of sanctions, as
indicated by this opinion, which might be applied.
We will not attempt to discuss all of the other con
siderations advanced by defendants' able counsel to sug
gest leniency for their clients. But a few, which may
reappear in future cases, bear mentioning. Counsel for
M. suggested that M.'s judgment was overwhelmed by
the plight of his close friends in academic difficulty.
Counsel for C. and G. stressed that their clients had
panicked during the examination when they realized
that they could not answer the questions without help.
While the cheating in this case was not proved to be
planned in advance, we would imagine that there will be
few cases where there is proof beyond a reasonable
doubt that such planning occurred. In the absence of an
established plan in advance of the examination, it would
not be unusual to be met with an explanation of friend
ship and inability to turn in a friend by the person who
gave aid, and panic of examination pressure by the one
who received it. These are not considerations which will
justify a lesser sanction.
All three defendants plan to finish their academic
work at Stanford during the spring quarter and return to
their country.
We recommend: that the defendants be suspended for
their remaining quarter; that the suspension be itself
suspended; that suspension of sanction be on condition
that they receive no academic credit for the course
involved.

Separate Opinion C.J .P. Case No. 104
While I concur in the result, I disagree with the
portion of Part I of the opinion which concludes that, in
the future, suspension will be the normal penalty for
examination cheating in cases like this one.
Some sanction short of suspension is more appro
priate for the first offense. In the case of a second
offense, I would be prepared to recommend indefinite
suspension.
