# USC Takes Two Of Three At Sunken Diamond
## Trojan Pitching Ruins Stanford Weekend 
### MARK WHITE 
In a series which pitted two
teams with strong defenses and
some of the nation's best pitching,
it was experience and the ability
to take advantage of Stanford's
lapses that gave USC two victories
over the Cards in a three game
series this weekend at Sunken
Diamond, all but eliminating
Stanford from Pac-8 title
con tention.
The defending national
champion Trojans now have a 7-1
Pac-8 record, while the Cards have
a 2-4 mark. Barring any miracles
in the remainder of the 18-game
conference schedule, it looks like
USC will once again represent the
Southern Division in the Pac-8
playoffs.
In the series opener on Friday,
catcher Ed Putnam gave USC a
lead it never relinquished with one
swing of the bat and USC held on
to win 2-1. Saturday the Cards
split a double-header, winning
behind Bob DiPietro's superb
three-hit shutout 1-0' in the
opening game before succumbing
to a strong two-hit performance
by SC's Mark Barr, 3-0 in the
nightcap.
Following Saturday's second
loss to USC, Stanford coach Ray
Young was anything but glum
about his team's performance.
"We're a young team and we were
right with them, but in the end,
the fact that most of their guys
have been to Omaha (for the
Collegiate World Series) had to
help them. Their experience may
have made the difference."
Experience Helps
If taking advantage of your
opponent's miscues is somehow
correlated to experience, then
experience was the difference in
Friday's series-opening game.
Each side committed an error, but
it was USC that turned it into the
game-winning run. While the
Trojans got about as much
mileage possible out of two hits,
Stanford left eight men on base,
squandering their six hits. The
lone Cardinal run came on Dave
faker's sacrifice fly with the bases

loaded in the eighth inning.
Dan Shaw opened the game
strong, striking out the first three
Trojans he faced. Randy Scarbery,
the ace of USC's pitching staff,
was in mild trouble during the
first two innings, giving up a
single, a double, a walk and a wild
pitch, but he had enough control
to stifle Stanford's mild threats.
The game settled into a
pitching duel until the top of the
fifth, when, with one out, first
baseman Daryl Arrenstein floated
a pop fly into center. Card
center-fielder Bob Hampton
appeared to have a play, but the
ball dropped out of his glove for
an error.
Decisive Homer
Putman greeted Shaw's next
pitch with a 360 foot blast over

the left field fence that gave USC
all it needed to win. Except for
Baker's RBI, Scarbery escaped
from Stanford's late inning threats
unscathed and posted his eighth
victory of the season, 2-1.
In Saturday's first game, it was
all Bob DiPietro, as Stanford won
1-0 behind the lefthander's 13
strikeouts and iron control of the
game.
In the first, second, fourth,
sixth and seventh innings, USC
got its leadoff man on base, but in
each case DiPietro bore down and
induced the Trojans into a
seemingly endless stream of
pop-outs and strike-outs.
Marvin Cobb opened the game
with a single to center, but that
was erased when DiPietro
completed his sixth successful

pickoff play of the year.
Only one Trojan made it to
second base as DiPietro was never
really in trouble. The Cards, on
the other hand, threatened
regularly, but could not come up
with the crucial hit and going into
the bottom of the ninth of the
scheduled seven inning game, the
score was deadlocked, 0-0.
Crucial Error
With Hampton on third
following an error, Card second
baseman A 1 O'Brien lashed a
grounder which Trojan shortstop
Cobb bobbled, and Hampton
scampered home with the winning
run to give DiPietro the win.
"I'm glad we won when we
did," said DiPietro, "because I
was running out of gas. Today I

kept the ball in the strike zone,
using mostly my fastball. Then I
would use my best pitch, my
changeup, to keep them off
balance or strike them out.
Against the best, you've got to
throw your best to win."
Stung with only their second
shutout in 65 games, USC struck
early in the final game of the
series with runs in the first two
innings to post a 3-0 victory.
After Creighton Tevlin led off the
game with a triple to deep right,
Ken Grolle gave up a single to
Daryl Arrenstein which scored the
game's first run.
Tevlin came back an inning
later to double home another run
and before he had really settled
into the game, Grolle was down
2-0.
Grolle got no support from
Card bats as USC pitcher Mark
Barr was working a perfect game
going into the seventh inning.
Mike Nelson finally got Stanford's
first hit in the seventh, but it was
too late and way too little as USC
won the game 3-0.

TOUGH LUCK FOR GROLLE — Freshman Ken Grolle struck out six and allowed only two earned runs
in the second game of Saturday's doubleheader at Sunken Diamond, but the Cards lost to USC, 3-0. The
loss dropped Grolle's record to 3-3. Stanford is now 2-4 in the Pac-8 and 22-12 overall.

PITCHERS COME THROUGH — Pitching coach Tom Dunton had to
be pleased with his staff's performance this weekend against USC,
even though the Cards dropped two of three games to the Trojans.
Cardinal hurlers allowed only five runs and eight hits in the three
game series.
