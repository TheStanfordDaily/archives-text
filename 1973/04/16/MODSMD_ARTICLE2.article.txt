# Social, Cultural Concerns Stressed
## Jewish Students' Group Formed 
### DAN BRENNER 
Stanford's Jewish community has traditionally been
less activist than groups at other campuses which boast
both larger on and off-campus Jewish populations. But
with renewed interest in religion being expressed by
young people worldwide, a group of Stanford's Jewish
students are attempting to reorganize new approaches to
campus Jewish living.
"We're trying to meet more of the social and cultural
rather than the educational needs of Jewish students,"
says Marc Kaye, a senior who has formed a new
organization, Jewish Students of Stanford University.
"Jewish students have been repressed, not by their outside
environment, but by the students themselves," he
believes.
The new organization intends to supplement the
current campus Jewish organization, the Hillel
Foundation. Hillel is a national college organization
supported by contributions from parents of current
students and by the Bnai Brith, a Jewish service
organization. Kaye believes that Hillel has not been able

to form a meaningful sense of community among Jewish
students because of its centralized organization.
"Students have to come to a common facility rather
than participating in Jewish activities in their living
groups," Kaye maintains. One of the organization's
primary goals is initiating a Jewish House along the same
lines as the minority special program dormitories.
Kaye says the University will not sponsor such a living
arrangement because of the ban on use of dorms for
religious meetings. But housing officials have agreed to
establish clusters for Jewish students in Manzanita Park if
enough students are interested.
Student Survey
In order to find out what kinds of cultural activities
Jewish students are interested in, Kaye's group sent out
questionnaires to over six hundred students here.
Discussion groups, week-end retreats, and sabbath dinners
were included as possible activities.
The group stresses its desire to decentralize Jewish
activities so that they take place where the students live
