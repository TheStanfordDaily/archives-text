# Social, Cultural Concerns Stressed
## Jewish Students' Group Formed 
### DAN BRENNER 
Stanford's Jewish community has traditionally been
less activist than groups at other campuses which boast
both larger on and off-campus Jewish populations. But
with renewed interest in religion being expressed by
young people worldwide, a group of Stanford's Jewish
students are attempting to reorganize new approaches to
campus Jewish living.
"We're trying to meet more of the social and cultural
rather than the educational needs of Jewish students,"
says Marc Kaye, a senior who has formed a new
organization, Jewish Students of Stanford University.
"Jewish students have been repressed, not by their outside
environment, but by the students themselves," he
believes.
The new organization intends to supplement the
current campus Jewish organization, the Hillel
Foundation. Hillel is a national college organization
supported by contributions from parents of current
students and by the Bnai Brith, a Jewish service
organization. Kaye believes that Hillel has not been able

to form a meaningful sense of community among Jewish
students because of its centralized organization.
"Students have to come to a common facility rather
than participating in Jewish activities in their living
groups," Kaye maintains. One of the organization's
primary goals is initiating a Jewish House along the same
lines as the minority special program dormitories.
Kaye says the University will not sponsor such a living
arrangement because of the ban on use of dorms for
religious meetings. But housing officials have agreed to
establish clusters for Jewish students in Manzanita Park if
enough students are interested.
Student Survey
In order to find out what kinds of cultural activities
Jewish students are interested in, Kaye's group sent out
questionnaires to over six hundred students here.
Discussion groups, week-end retreats, and sabbath dinners
were included as possible activities.
The group stresses its desire to decentralize Jewish
activities so that they take place where the students live
and not in a place like the Clubhouse, where Hillel's
offices are located.
Rabbi Charles Familiant, who has headed Stanford's
Hillel organization for the last eight years, believes the
new student-run organization is neither competing nor
incompatable with Hillel. "Hillel is primarily concerned
with centralized activities: films, lectures, and classes
which appeal to all Jewish students," he says.
Familiant says the primary responsibility of his job as
serving the needs of Stanford's Jewish students. "Many
students want their intellectual needs satisfied and are not
interested in religious involvement on other than an
intellectual plane," he believes.
Intensive Jewish student communities are growing on
some college campuses, primarily under the auspices of
the Chabad and Lubavitch movements, which emphasize
the spiritual tradition of the religion.
"This is not Brooklyn College or Brandeis or even
Berkeley," notes Familiant. "Stanford is unique, and
Jewish Stanford students in general are not liable to be
involved in fundamentalist movements."
Activist Outlook
While Kaye's group cannot be considered
fundamentalist, it emphasizes an activist outlook and its

desire to make Judaism a total experience. "This is going
to be a shot in the arm for Hillel," predicts Kaye.
One planned activity is to celebrate Lag B'Omer, an
ancient tree planting festival, by joining in the current
campus clean-up program and planting trees in the
foothills.
Hillel and the Jewish Students Organization are jointly
organizing dinners in dormitories for tomorrow evening,
the second night of Passover. Both are helping members of
living groups make their own Passover dinners. The
Passover dinner, or seder (service), retells the flight of the
Israelites from Egypt under Moses.
Jewish Identity
Familiant is encouraged by the activism shown by the
Jewish Students group. "Their interest is bound to
generate pride in Jewish identity," he believes, adding that
the new desire for student-initiated programs is not due to
an inherent inability of Hillel to provide more intensive
activities.
"If needs have not been met, it has not been the fault
of Hillel. Perhaps it has more to do with the personalities
involved in the programs," he says.
And he cautions, "One has to be realistic before trying
something like a more activist Jewish community becuase
it is easy to become disillusioned."

supported by contributions from parents of current
students and by the Bnai Brith, a Jewish service
organization. Kaye believes that Hillel has not been able

to form a meaningful sense of community among Jewish
students because of its centralized organization.
"Students have to come to a common facility rather
than participating in Jewish activities in their living
groups," Kaye maintains. One of the organization's
primary goals is initiating a Jewish House along the same
lines as the minority special program dormitories.
Kaye says the University will not sponsor such a living
arrangement because of the ban on use of dorms for
religious meetings. But housing officials have agreed to
establish clusters for Jewish students in Manzanita Park if
enough students are interested.
Student Survey
In order to find out what kinds of cultural activities
Jewish students are interested in, Kaye's group sent out
questionnaires to over six hundred students here.
Discussion groups, week-end retreats, and sabbath dinners
were included as possible activities.
The group stresses its desire to decentralize Jewish
activities so that they take place where the students live
and not in a place like the Clubhouse, where Hillel's
offices are located.
Rabbi Charles Familiant, who has headed Stanford's
Hillel organization for the last eight years, believes the
new student-run organization is neither competing nor
incompatable with Hillel. "Hillel is primarily concerned
with centralized activities: films, lectures, and classes
which appeal to all Jewish students," he says.
Familiant says the primary responsibility of his job as
serving the needs of Stanford's Jewish students. "Many
students want their intellectual needs satisfied and are not
interested in religious involvement on other than an
intellectual plane," he believes.
Intensive Jewish student communities are growing on
some college campuses, primarily under the auspices of
the Chabad and Lubavitch movements, which emphasize
the spiritual tradition of the religion.
"This is not Brooklyn College or Brandeis or even
Berkeley," notes Familiant. "Stanford is unique, and
Jewish Stanford students in general are not liable to be
involved in fundamentalist movements."
Activist Outlook
While Kaye's group cannot be considered
fundamentalist, it emphasizes an activist outlook and its

desire to make Judaism a total experience. "This is going
to be a shot in the arm for Hillel," predicts Kaye.
One planned activity is to celebrate Lag B'Omer, an
ancient tree planting festival, by joining in the current
campus clean-up program and planting trees in the
foothills.
Hillel and the Jewish Students Organization are jointly
organizing dinners in dormitories for tomorrow evening,
the second night of Passover. Both are helping members of
living groups make their own Passover dinners. The
Passover dinner, or seder (service), retells the flight of the
Israelites from Egypt under Moses.
Jewish Identity
Familiant is encouraged by the activism shown by the
Jewish Students group. "Their interest is bound to
generate pride in Jewish identity," he believes, adding that
the new desire for student-initiated programs is not due to
an inherent inability of Hillel to provide more intensive
activities.
"If needs have not been met, it has not been the fault
of Hillel. Perhaps it has more to do with the personalities
involved in the programs," he says.
And he cautions, "One has to be realistic before trying
something like a more activist Jewish community becuase
it is easy to become disillusioned."
Stanford's Jewish community has traditionally been
less activist than groups at other campuses which boast
both larger on and off-campus Jewish populations. But
with renewed interest in religion being expressed by
young people worldwide, a group of Stanford's Jewish
students are attempting to reorganize new approaches to
campus Jewish living.
"We're trying to meet more of the social and cultural
rather than the educational needs of Jewish students,"
says Marc Kaye, a senior who has formed a new
organization, Jewish Students of Stanford University.
"Jewish students have been repressed, not by their outside
environment, but by the students themselves," he
believes.
The new organization intends to supplement the
current campus Jewish organization, the Hillel
Foundation. Hillel is a national college organization
supported by contributions from parents of current
