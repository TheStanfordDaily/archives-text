# Golfers Struggle At Fresno Tourney
## 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
Before the golf team left for
Fresno on Thursday, Golf World
magazine's latest college rankings
listed Stanford 10th in the nation.
But over the weekend the Cards
failed to live up to their national
prominence, finishing sixth in a
strong eight-team field at the
Fresno State Classic.
Stanford wasn't the only top
10 team to fail at Fresno. Seventh
ranked USC and eighth ranked
Brigham Young also lost to
surprising Fresno State, which
used its home course advantage

and three outstanding individual
performances to edge BYU by
four shots in the 54 hole event.
Fresno's winning total was
1338, BYU shot 1342, USC was a
distant third at 1359, San Jose
State finished fourth at 1360,
Long Beach State fifth at 1368,
Stanford sixth at 1370, San Diego
State seventh at 1372, and Cal
State Fullerton, who failed to
turn in a 54 hole score, finished
eighth.
Stanford's performance was
particularly frustrating, since it
marked the Cards' third straight

losing effort since they won the
Pacific Coast Invitational at Santa
Barbara three weeks ago. "It was
great for us to win the Pacific
Coast Invitational," said Denny
Colvin, "but we really haven't
done anything since. We're going
to have to get ourselves in gear if
we're going to do anything in the
Pac-8."
Colvin was referring to two
very frustrating weeks of golf for
the Cardinals, who finished third
in the University of Pacific
Invitational last weekend and lost
to San Jose State in a dual match

on Monday.
The Fresno tournament was
equally frustrating Only Dave
Baskins finished in the top 10,
shooting 73-76-73 for a 222 total
and 10th place, seven shots
behind individual champion Craig
Stadler of USC. Meanwhile Fresno
State placed three players in the
top 10, as Terry Moore and Mike
Watney tied for second at even
par 216 and Bob Eberlee finished
seventh at 220.
Stanford's other scores were:
Conrad Nilmeier (75-77-75),
Colvin (79-75-74), George
Pettinger (76-80-73), Aly
Trompas (77-76-78), and Bob
Chapman (77-77-79).
Coach Bud Finger's golfers
won't have much time to recover
from their latest disaster, since the
Western Intercollegiates will be
held this week in Santa Cruz. All
of the top teams on the West
Coast are entered in the 54 hole
tournament, which begins
Wednesday at tfasatiempo Golf
Course.
