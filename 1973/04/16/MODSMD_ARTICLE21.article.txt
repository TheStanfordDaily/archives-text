# Tennis Team Defeats California As Gould Shifts Cardinal Lineup
## 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
Stanford tennis coach Dick
Gould experimented with his
lineup Saturday as the Cardinals
beat California 7-2 at Berkeley.
The victory, the Cards' ninth
against only two losses, came
despite the absense of Sandy
Mayer and Jim Delaney, the
team's two best players. Thus
Rick Fisher played first singles.
Or maybe it would be better to
say that Fisher didn't play first
singles. His opponent, Peter
Campbell, had to forfeit after the
first game because of an injured
wrist.
Pat DuPre, playing up at
second singles, beat Steve Bartlett,
6-4, 6-4. Chip Fisher, playing
much higher on the ladder than
usual, came through with a 6-0,
6-1 win over Doug King at third
singles.
The Cards' other singles win
came from John Whitlinger, who

topped John Stefanki 6-2, 6-1. At
fourth singles, however, Gery
Groslimond lost to Manuel
Casteneda, 6-3, 6-4, while at sixth
singles Paul Sidone was beaten by
Larry Belinsky 6-3, 6-3.
Stanford dominated doubles
play. Chip Fisher and Whitlinger
trounced Casteneda and Stefanki,
6-1, 6-0 at second doubles. Thus,
this pair becomes a likely
candidate to play a doubles
position in the matches against
UCLA and USC this weekend.
The Cardinals will continue to
experiment with their lineup in
two mid-week matches in
preparation for this weekend's big
duels against USC and UCLA, in
which the team tries to avenge its
only two defeats of the season.
Tomorrow, San Diego will be
Stanford's guest, while
Wednesday, Arizona comes to
town.
Also, the players will continue

to practice, albeit with their shirts
off when the weather permits.
Last week, when a older fan
kidded Gould about this, the
Stanford coach replied "I'd let
them practice with their pants off
if they wanted to." However, the
good-sized crowds which have
been watching the team practice
make this latter possibility
unlikely.
