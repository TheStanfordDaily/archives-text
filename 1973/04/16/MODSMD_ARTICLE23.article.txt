# Shuffling The Cards
## Anthony Davis' Decision 
### Dave Robinson 
Anthony Davis was wearing the familiar maroon
number 28 on his back this weekend, but instead of
darting through opposing backfields, the
Ail-American halfback sat in the USC dugout and
watched as the Trojans took two out of three games
from the Cardinals at Sunken Diamond.
Davis pulled a hamstring muscle last weekend
against California so USC coach Ron Dedeaux
decided to rest the switch hitting outfielder during
the Stanford series. But Dedeaux indicated that
Davis would see a lot of baseball action at USC
before he graduates in 1975.
"Anthony is definitely a major league prospect,"
Dedeaux said as Davis lashed line drives in the
batting cage before Saturday's doubleheader. "He's
a switch hitter, he loves to play, and he's got a lot of
sock."
Davis has seen limited action so far this season,
primarily because of injuries. He just recently
recovered from his much publicized car accident,
and last week suffered the minor hamstring pull. In
between, though, Davis stole five bases in six
attempts in the Riverside tournament and also got
several base hits.
"I feel fortunate that I can play two sports,"
Davis said Saturday, "Although I have a problem
adjusting my muscles from football to baseball. I'm
a bulky type of guy (5-9, 185), and it takes me
longer to get loose."
Hasn't Decided
Davis definitely plans to pursue a professional
athletic career, but he hasn't yet decided between
baseball and football. "I like both sports," he said,
"but in football you take a beating all the time. If
everything was equal I'd probably play baseball
because of the longevity of the sport, but I'd sure
play football if I had to."
At this point Davis is certainly more
accomplished as a football player after leading USC
to the national championship, but Dedeaux
explained that it often takes longer for a baseball
player to prove himself. "Anthony has already
established himself as a superstar in football,"
Dedeaux said, "but it takes longer for a baseball

player to arrive. There are a lot of little things a
baseball player has to learn before he's really
ready."
Davis, who was drafted by the Baltimore Orioles
out of high school, admits that he has yet to prove
himself as a baseball star. "I really haven't done
anything at SC as far as baseball is concerned," he
said. "I just need some playing time — I love to hit
and it takes a lot of batting time to be ready."
Since USC has already won the national football
title and the Trojans are currently the number one
ranked baseball team, Davis may become one of the
few athletes ever to play on two national
championship teams in one year. And after the
baseball season ends, he'll turn his attention once
again to the USC football squad, a team Davis feels
has an excellent chance to repeat as national
champions.
Bigger And Quicker
"We'll be bigger and quicker next year," Davis
said, words which may make opposing Pac-8
coaches lose considerable sleep between now and
September.
But he also sees some possible weaknesses for the
1973 Trojans. "Fullback is a real question mark
right now with Sam Cunningham gone, and we'll
have to make up for the loss of some of our smart
veterans. Last year we had a real smart team."
Of course USC coach John McKay doesn't have
to worry much about the tailback slot. "Our offense
is Davis to the right and Davis to the left," McKay
said last month.
It's unlikely McKay will change his offense in
1973. He'll probably just sit back and watch his
shifty tailback display his speed and magnificent
moves in a Trojan football uniform.
"I've been compared to O.J. Simpson, Mike
Garrett, Larry Brown, and Gale Sayers," Davis said,
"but toward the end of the year I think people
realized I was just Anthony Davis — my own type of
runner."
But maybe in a few years those words will
change and Davis will say, "I've been compared to
Willie Mays, Hank Aaron, Mickey Mantle . .."
