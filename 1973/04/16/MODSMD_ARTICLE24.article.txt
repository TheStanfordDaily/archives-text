Vietnamese Troops Enter Cambodia
SAIGON — South Vietnamese troops have pushed across
the Cambodian border for the first time since a Vietnam
cease-fire went into effect 2Vi months ago, field reports
said yesterday.
Fighting was reported at two points along the border
and hundreds of refugees were said to have fled from
Cambodia into South Vietnam.
Lt. Col. Le Trung Hien, chief spokesman for the Saigon
command, denied the border crossing Monday, but the
Saigon command has denied such incursions in the past
until weeks after they took place. The troop movements
were confirmed by South Vietnamese border guards and
by Cambodian officers on the scene.
Hien said Communist troops attacked South
Vietnamese infantry positions northwest of the border
town of Hong Ngu on the Mekong River. He gave enemy
losses as 22 killed and government casualties as three dead
and 38 wounded.
Field reports indicated the South Vietnamese plunge a
half-mile into Cambodia was a defensive operation aimed
at driving North Vietnamese and Cambodian Communist
troops back from the frontier.
Brazilian Police Arrest Publisher
RIO DE JANEIRO — Brazilian federal police yesterday
arrested a publisher who defied censorship orders as the
military-run government toughened its crackdown against
news it does not like.
Fernando Gasparian, publisher of the weekly Opiniao,
was arrested in a raid at the printing plant where his latest
edition was coming off the presses. Policemen armed with
submachine guns also arrested two Opiniao editors and
confiscated 17,000 copies of the newspaper.
"You're trying to make a fool of me," a federal police
inspector screamed as he and his men rushed into the
building. Gasparian had received orders earlier in the week
not to print Opiniao without the clearance of special
censors assigned by Justice Minister Alfredo Buzaid.
"We had to start the press at 6 a.m. Saturday to get the
paper on the newsstands throughout the country by this
morning," said Gasparian, 43, a businessman and former
Oxford University professor.
He explained that censors approved 16 pages by 8:30
but never returned the last eight pages of the edition.
USDA Menu Features Leftovers
WASHINGTON — The Agriculture Department is
scurrying to distribute a circular, announced by the White
House last week, which shows how a family of four can
eat for $35 a week.
Only 5,000 of the circulars have been printed, but
officials say more are on order. Copies will be made
available free of charge through county extension service
offices. There are more than 3000 of those.
The shopping tips included in the circular were
announced last week by Virginia Knauer, White House
consumer affairs adviser. She said "selective shopping" at
supermarkets is a better alternative than meat boycotts.
A typical week's menu, costing $35.70 based on March
grocery prices in Washington, D.C., is heavy on leftovers
and light on red meat. Even bacon for breakfast is
eliminated.
The breakfast fare includes: buttermilk pancakes, hot
wheat cereal, french toast with ham, cottage cheese
omelet, grits with fried hotdogs, cold cereal and oatmeal.
Luncheons feature cottage cheese-vegetable salad, ham
salad, peanut butter sandwiches, corn chowder, grilled
cheese sandwiches, split pea soup and Brunswick stew
made with chicken.
For dinner, the week's menu concentrates on: baked
ham, meat balls in Spanish rice, broiled frankfurters, ham

casserole, baked fish fillets, Brunswick stew and Swiss
steak.
Leftovers from ham and Brunswick stew figure
prominently in the suggested menu.
Housewife Slain In Ulster
BELFAST — Northern Ireland — A Protestant housewife
answered a midnight knock yesterday at her Belfast home
and died in a fusillade of bullets that crashed through the
front door.
Police said the murdered woman, identified as Margaret
Miller, was hit in the chest.
"She was in the hall on her way to open the door when
four shots were fired through the woodwork," a
spokesman said.
The killers escaped by car.
Security forces believed Mrs. Miller may have been
killed in revenge for the slaying 24 hours earlier of a
Protestant youth who was a member of the Roman
Cat ho lie-based Irish Republican Army.
Robert Millen, 23 — thought to be the first Protestant
to die for the IRA during the current Northern Ireland
strife — was shot dead from a speeding car while on duty
with a vigilante patrol in Belfast.
The two deaths raised to 774 the fatality toll in nearly
four years of sectarian strife in the British-ruled province.
British troops shot a teenaged brother and sister in
Belfast yesterday, and then apologized.
The 15-year-old youth suffered serious chest wounds
and his 19-year-old sister was hit in the leg and side. Both
are Roman Catholics.
An army statement admitted the couple "probably"
was shot by mistake by soldiers patroling the Catholic
Andersonstown district, a stronghold of the outlawed
Irish Republican Army.
Viet Refugee Problem Growing
TINH BIEN, South Vietnam — South Vietnam, which has
up to two million refugees of its own, has become a haven
of sorts for thousands more fleeing from the violence of
war in neighboring Cambodia.
For some of the refugees, their flight across the border
brought them only death and injury. A Communist
122 mm rocket slammed into their riverside camp, killing
35 and wounding about 70.
More than 10,000 Cambodian villagers have crossed
into South Vietnam at this little border town since
mid-February.
The latest group of about 500 crossed over Friday
when their village of thatch huts was destroyed in an
attack by Khmer Rouge insurgents and North Vietnamese.
They are camped along the roadside about 200 yards
inside South Vietnam, huddling under makeshift tents and
old parachutes, watching the fighting for what remains of
their village just across the border.

Murphy, who also serves as Australia's minister of
customs, said California set an example a year ago by
banning the import of kangaroo products.
Australia followed last January with a complete export
ban on kangaroo products. Murphy said 1.5 million
kangaroos a year were being slaughtered before the ban.

Hien said Communist troops attacked South

Brazilian Police Arrest Publisher
RIO DE JANEIRO — Brazilian federal police yesterday
arrested a publisher who defied censorship orders as the
military-run government toughened its crackdown against
news it does not like.
Fernando Gasparian, publisher of the weekly Opiniao,
was arrested in a raid at the printing plant where his latest
edition was coming off the presses. Policemen armed with
submachine guns also arrested two Opiniao editors and
confiscated 17,000 copies of the newspaper.
"You're trying to make a fool of me," a federal police
inspector screamed as he and his men rushed into the
building. Gasparian had received orders earlier in the week
not to print Opiniao without the clearance of special
censors assigned by Justice Minister Alfredo Buzaid.
"We had to start the press at 6 a.m. Saturday to get the
paper on the newsstands throughout the country by this
morning," said Gasparian, 43, a businessman and former
Oxford University professor.
He explained that censors approved 16 pages by 8:30
but never returned the last eight pages of the edition.
USDA Menu Features Leftovers
WASHINGTON — The Agriculture Department is
scurrying to distribute a circular, announced by the White
House last week, which shows how a family of four can
eat for $35 a week.
Only 5,000 of the circulars have been printed, but
officials say more are on order. Copies will be made
available free of charge through county extension service
offices. There are more than 3000 of those.
The shopping tips included in the circular were
announced last week by Virginia Knauer, White House
consumer affairs adviser. She said "selective shopping" at
supermarkets is a better alternative than meat boycotts.
A typical week's menu, costing $35.70 based on March
grocery prices in Washington, D.C., is heavy on leftovers
and light on red meat. Even bacon for breakfast is
eliminated.
The breakfast fare includes: buttermilk pancakes, hot
wheat cereal, french toast with ham, cottage cheese
omelet, grits with fried hotdogs, cold cereal and oatmeal.
Luncheons feature cottage cheese-vegetable salad, ham
salad, peanut butter sandwiches, corn chowder, grilled
cheese sandwiches, split pea soup and Brunswick stew
made with chicken.
For dinner, the week's menu concentrates on: baked
ham, meat balls in Spanish rice, broiled frankfurters, ham

casserole, baked fish fillets, Brunswick stew and Swiss
steak.
Leftovers from ham and Brunswick stew figure
prominently in the suggested menu.
Housewife Slain In Ulster
BELFAST — Northern Ireland — A Protestant housewife
answered a midnight knock yesterday at her Belfast home
and died in a fusillade of bullets that crashed through the
front door.
Police said the murdered woman, identified as Margaret
Miller, was hit in the chest.
"She was in the hall on her way to open the door when
four shots were fired through the woodwork," a
spokesman said.
The killers escaped by car.
Security forces believed Mrs. Miller may have been
killed in revenge for the slaying 24 hours earlier of a
Protestant youth who was a member of the Roman
Cat ho lie-based Irish Republican Army.
Robert Millen, 23 — thought to be the first Protestant
to die for the IRA during the current Northern Ireland
strife — was shot dead from a speeding car while on duty
with a vigilante patrol in Belfast.
The two deaths raised to 774 the fatality toll in nearly
four years of sectarian strife in the British-ruled province.
British troops shot a teenaged brother and sister in
Belfast yesterday, and then apologized.
The 15-year-old youth suffered serious chest wounds
and his 19-year-old sister was hit in the leg and side. Both
are Roman Catholics.
An army statement admitted the couple "probably"
was shot by mistake by soldiers patroling the Catholic
Andersonstown district, a stronghold of the outlawed
Irish Republican Army.
Viet Refugee Problem Growing
TINH BIEN, South Vietnam — South Vietnam, which has
up to two million refugees of its own, has become a haven
of sorts for thousands more fleeing from the violence of
war in neighboring Cambodia.
For some of the refugees, their flight across the border
brought them only death and injury. A Communist
122 mm rocket slammed into their riverside camp, killing
35 and wounding about 70.
More than 10,000 Cambodian villagers have crossed
into South Vietnam at this little border town since
mid-February.
The latest group of about 500 crossed over Friday
when their village of thatch huts was destroyed in an
attack by Khmer Rouge insurgents and North Vietnamese.
They are camped along the roadside about 200 yards
inside South Vietnam, huddling under makeshift tents and
old parachutes, watching the fighting for what remains of
their village just across the border.

military-run government toughened its crackdown against
news it does not like.
Fernando Gasparian, publisher of the weekly Opiniao,
was arrested in a raid at the printing plant where his latest
edition was coming off the presses. Policemen armed with
submachine guns also arrested two Opiniao editors and
confiscated 17,000 copies of the newspaper.
"You're trying to make a fool of me," a federal police
inspector screamed as he and his men rushed into the
building. Gasparian had received orders earlier in the week
not to print Opiniao without the clearance of special
censors assigned by Justice Minister Alfredo Buzaid.
"We had to start the press at 6 a.m. Saturday to get the
paper on the newsstands throughout the country by this
morning," said Gasparian, 43, a businessman and former
Oxford University professor.
He explained that censors approved 16 pages by 8:30
but never returned the last eight pages of the edition.
USDA Menu Features Leftovers
WASHINGTON — The Agriculture Department is
scurrying to distribute a circular, announced by the White
House last week, which shows how a family of four can
eat for $35 a week.
Only 5,000 of the circulars have been printed, but
officials say more are on order. Copies will be made
available free of charge through county extension service
offices. There are more than 3000 of those.
The shopping tips included in the circular were
announced last week by Virginia Knauer, White House
consumer affairs adviser. She said "selective shopping" at
supermarkets is a better alternative than meat boycotts.
A typical week's menu, costing $35.70 based on March
grocery prices in Washington, D.C., is heavy on leftovers
and light on red meat. Even bacon for breakfast is
eliminated.
The breakfast fare includes: buttermilk pancakes, hot
wheat cereal, french toast with ham, cottage cheese
omelet, grits with fried hotdogs, cold cereal and oatmeal.
Luncheons feature cottage cheese-vegetable salad, ham
salad, peanut butter sandwiches, corn chowder, grilled
cheese sandwiches, split pea soup and Brunswick stew
made with chicken.
For dinner, the week's menu concentrates on: baked
ham, meat balls in Spanish rice, broiled frankfurters, ham

casserole, baked fish fillets, Brunswick stew and Swiss
steak.
Leftovers from ham and Brunswick stew figure
prominently in the suggested menu.
Housewife Slain In Ulster
BELFAST — Northern Ireland — A Protestant housewife
answered a midnight knock yesterday at her Belfast home
and died in a fusillade of bullets that crashed through the
front door.
Police said the murdered woman, identified as Margaret
Miller, was hit in the chest.
"She was in the hall on her way to open the door when
four shots were fired through the woodwork," a
spokesman said.
The killers escaped by car.
Security forces believed Mrs. Miller may have been
killed in revenge for the slaying 24 hours earlier of a
Protestant youth who was a member of the Roman
Cat ho lie-based Irish Republican Army.
Robert Millen, 23 — thought to be the first Protestant
to die for the IRA during the current Northern Ireland
strife — was shot dead from a speeding car while on duty
with a vigilante patrol in Belfast.
The two deaths raised to 774 the fatality toll in nearly
four years of sectarian strife in the British-ruled province.
British troops shot a teenaged brother and sister in
Belfast yesterday, and then apologized.
The 15-year-old youth suffered serious chest wounds
and his 19-year-old sister was hit in the leg and side. Both
are Roman Catholics.
An army statement admitted the couple "probably"
was shot by mistake by soldiers patroling the Catholic
Andersonstown district, a stronghold of the outlawed
Irish Republican Army.
Viet Refugee Problem Growing
TINH BIEN, South Vietnam — South Vietnam, which has
up to two million refugees of its own, has become a haven
of sorts for thousands more fleeing from the violence of
war in neighboring Cambodia.
For some of the refugees, their flight across the border
brought them only death and injury. A Communist
122 mm rocket slammed into their riverside camp, killing
35 and wounding about 70.
More than 10,000 Cambodian villagers have crossed
into South Vietnam at this little border town since
mid-February.
The latest group of about 500 crossed over Friday
when their village of thatch huts was destroyed in an
attack by Khmer Rouge insurgents and North Vietnamese.
They are camped along the roadside about 200 yards
inside South Vietnam, huddling under makeshift tents and
old parachutes, watching the fighting for what remains of
their village just across the border.
Official Lauds Kangaroo Protection
SAN FRANCISCO — Australian Atty. Gen. Lionel
Murphy yesterday praised California for giving a "world
lead" in protecting the kangaroo.
Murphy, who also serves as Australia's minister of
customs, said California set an example a year ago by
banning the import of kangaroo products.
Australia followed last January with a complete export
ban on kangaroo products. Murphy said 1.5 million
kangaroos a year were being slaughtered before the ban.

Vietnamese Troops Enter Cambodia
SAIGON — South Vietnamese troops have pushed across
the Cambodian border for the first time since a Vietnam
cease-fire went into effect 2Vi months ago, field reports
said yesterday.
Fighting was reported at two points along the border
and hundreds of refugees were said to have fled from
Cambodia into South Vietnam.
Lt. Col. Le Trung Hien, chief spokesman for the Saigon
command, denied the border crossing Monday, but the
Saigon command has denied such incursions in the past
until weeks after they took place. The troop movements
were confirmed by South Vietnamese border guards and
by Cambodian officers on the scene.
Hien said Communist troops attacked South
Vietnamese infantry positions northwest of the border
town of Hong Ngu on the Mekong River. He gave enemy
losses as 22 killed and government casualties as three dead
and 38 wounded.
Field reports indicated the South Vietnamese plunge a
half-mile into Cambodia was a defensive operation aimed
at driving North Vietnamese and Cambodian Communist
troops back from the frontier.
