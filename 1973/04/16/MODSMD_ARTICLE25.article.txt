MOUNTAIN VIEW â€” The commander
of the flight wing headquartered at
Moffett Naval Air Station Friday
blamed human error for the collision
and crash of two military planes that
killed 16 persons Thursday.
Rear Adm. Herbert S. Ainsworth
said at a press conference Friday that
the cause of the collision "appears to
be human error, but we don't know
whose." An inquiry into the crash is
being conducted.
Five Navy crewmen aboard a P-3C
Orion sub-hunter and 11 crewmen and
scientists aboard a National
Aeronautics and Space Administration
Convair 990 perished when the planes
fell onto the Sunnyvale Municipal Golf
Course, just 1000 feet from the
Moffett runway.
A sixth man aboard the Navy plane,
Bruce N. Mallibert, 22, of Mountain
View, remained in critical condition
after undergoing surgery Saturday
morning at El Camino Hospital.
Navy and NASA authorities
conducting the investigation into the
wreck have impounded tapes of
ground-aircraft transmissions during
the last minutes of the flight. An
in-flight recorder aboard the NASA
plane is being sent to Washington for
analysis.
