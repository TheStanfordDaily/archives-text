# PA Council Candidates Suggest Varied Ways To Treat Stanford
## 
### ROBERT BACON 
With three weeks until election day,
Stanford is among the major issues
that candidates for the Palo Alto city
council are discussing.
The city's residents will choose six
council members from 18 candidates
on May 8.
Although the main campus is not
within the city limits, Stanford is a
force that city government must
constantly reckon with. Town and
gown meet most noticeably when
Stanford seeks to develop parts of its
land endowment, since land must be
annexed to the city before it is
developed.
The candidates' proposals for
dealing with Stanford reflect the

differences in philosophy between the
three groups of candidates.
Annexation
Independent candidate Robert
Cullenbine, administrator of a research
project in early childhood education in
the School of Education, is the only
hopeful to propose annexation of the
student and faculty housing areas, to
allow campus residents to take part in
municipal government.
He suggests that "antagonism by
some city people toward students and
professors" has prevented annexation
to date.
Candidate Emily Renzel, who says
she identifies with consistently
anti-Stanford Councilwoman Enid
Pearson, particularly on land use
questions, suggested at a February
candidate's forum that "There is a
possibility we could annex Stanford.
That might give Stanford hairy fits.
Then the Council would have zoning
power over Stanford."
She has not repeated that
suggestion, but she insists that Palo
Alto officials must be involved in the
early stages of Stanford's land
development planning. "On Coyote
Hill [industrial park] and Frenchman's
Terrace [housing], there was lots of
Stanford planning before the council
got them" for consideration, Renzel
pointed out.
Liaison Committee
The solution that many of the
candidates propose is establishment of
regular meetings between city officials
and Stanford Trustees, administrators,
and/or planners.
All candidates answered a League
of Women Voters questionairre
including the question "In what
specific ways could Palo Alto and
Stanford University work together to
solve problems of mutual concern?"
Among those responding with some
form of standing liaison committee

proposal were Elvia Garwood, Anne
Witherspoon, Roy Clay, and
incumbents John Beahrs and John
Berwald, all of the more conservative
"Palo Alto '73" slate; Thomas Passell,
Allan Seid, Councilwoman Sylvia
Seman, Byron Sher and Renzel of the
conservation-oriented Association for
a Balanced Community (ABC); and
independent John D. Snow.
Good Offices
Sher, a law professor at Stanford,
offered his "good offices... to
encourage Stanford to work with the
City to protect our mutually shared
environment."
Beahrs, the most conservative
incumbent councilman, stressed that

the city must "accommodate
Stanford's rights as a private
institution."
Vice Mayor Stanley Norton,
another member of the PA '73 slate,
urged that the city "respond to
reasonable Stanford requests."
Housing
The more radical members of the
Palo Alto Community Coalition
(PACC) ticket instead call on the
University to respond to their requests
— specifically, to use Stanford lands
for low/moderate-income housing
rather than commercial and industrial
development. "Palo Alto can mainly
encourage and pressure," says Jeffrey
Youdelman of Venceremos, a PACC
candidate.
The other PACC candidates — John
Philo, a Stanford physics graduate
student and member of the Trustee
Committee on Land and Buildings;
Carol Peterson, wife of a third-year
law student; and long-time peace
activist Douglas Mattern — express
similar sentiments.
Renzel and Mayor Kirke Comstock,
both on the ABC slate, stress that
Stanford should have a part in
developing the forthcoming general
city land use plan, and should adhere
to that plan once it is adopted.
Clay and Renzel are competing for
the remaining two years of an
unexpired term; the other 16 hopefuls
are battling in an at-large contest for
five four-year terms on the
nine-member, non-partisan council.

force that city government must
constantly reckon with. Town and
gown meet most noticeably when
Stanford seeks to develop parts of its
land endowment, since land must be
annexed to the city before it is
developed.
The candidates' proposals for
dealing with Stanford reflect the

differences in philosophy between the
three groups of candidates.
Annexation
Independent candidate Robert
Cullenbine, administrator of a research
project in early childhood education in
the School of Education, is the only
hopeful to propose annexation of the
student and faculty housing areas, to
allow campus residents to take part in
municipal government.
He suggests that "antagonism by
some city people toward students and
professors" has prevented annexation
to date.
Candidate Emily Renzel, who says
she identifies with consistently
anti-Stanford Councilwoman Enid
Pearson, particularly on land use
questions, suggested at a February
candidate's forum that "There is a
possibility we could annex Stanford.
That might give Stanford hairy fits.
Then the Council would have zoning
power over Stanford."
She has not repeated that
suggestion, but she insists that Palo
Alto officials must be involved in the
early stages of Stanford's land
development planning. "On Coyote
Hill [industrial park] and Frenchman's
Terrace [housing], there was lots of
Stanford planning before the council
got them" for consideration, Renzel
pointed out.
Liaison Committee
The solution that many of the
candidates propose is establishment of
regular meetings between city officials
and Stanford Trustees, administrators,
and/or planners.
All candidates answered a League
of Women Voters questionairre
including the question "In what
specific ways could Palo Alto and
Stanford University work together to
solve problems of mutual concern?"
Among those responding with some
form of standing liaison committee

proposal were Elvia Garwood, Anne
Witherspoon, Roy Clay, and
incumbents John Beahrs and John
Berwald, all of the more conservative
"Palo Alto '73" slate; Thomas Passell,
Allan Seid, Councilwoman Sylvia
Seman, Byron Sher and Renzel of the
conservation-oriented Association for
a Balanced Community (ABC); and
independent John D. Snow.
Good Offices
Sher, a law professor at Stanford,
offered his "good offices... to
encourage Stanford to work with the
City to protect our mutually shared
environment."
Beahrs, the most conservative
incumbent councilman, stressed that

the city must "accommodate
Stanford's rights as a private
institution."
Vice Mayor Stanley Norton,
another member of the PA '73 slate,
urged that the city "respond to
reasonable Stanford requests."
Housing
The more radical members of the
Palo Alto Community Coalition
(PACC) ticket instead call on the
University to respond to their requests
— specifically, to use Stanford lands
for low/moderate-income housing
rather than commercial and industrial
development. "Palo Alto can mainly
encourage and pressure," says Jeffrey
Youdelman of Venceremos, a PACC
candidate.
The other PACC candidates — John
Philo, a Stanford physics graduate
student and member of the Trustee
Committee on Land and Buildings;
Carol Peterson, wife of a third-year
law student; and long-time peace
activist Douglas Mattern — express
similar sentiments.
Renzel and Mayor Kirke Comstock,
both on the ABC slate, stress that
Stanford should have a part in
developing the forthcoming general
city land use plan, and should adhere
to that plan once it is adopted.
Clay and Renzel are competing for
the remaining two years of an
unexpired term; the other 16 hopefuls
are battling in an at-large contest for
five four-year terms on the
nine-member, non-partisan council.
With three weeks until election day,
Stanford is among the major issues
that candidates for the Palo Alto city
council are discussing.
The city's residents will choose six
council members from 18 candidates
on May 8.
Although the main campus is not
within the city limits, Stanford is a
force that city government must
constantly reckon with. Town and
gown meet most noticeably when
