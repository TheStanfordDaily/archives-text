# Chino Trial To Begin, All White Jury Chosen
## 
### 
An all-white jury of five men and
seven women was selected and sworn
in last Wednesday in the trial of
Andrea Holman Burt and Benton
Douglas√üurt.
San Bernardino Superior Court
Judge Thomas Haldorsen then
dismissed the panel until April 23,
when the trial will begin. Four
alternate jurors chosen Friday will be
sworn in today.
The Burts face murder charges in
connection with the death of a prison
guard in the Oct. 6 Chino prison
escape of convict Ronald Beaty.
In the jury selection process,
defense attorney Charles Garry used
10 of his 30 possible peremptory
challenges, and prosecutor Joseph D.
Canty Jr. challenged nine prospective
jurors. The attorneys interviewed

exactly 100 prospective jurors,
questioning each of them for an
average of 20 minutes.
Only two members of the final
all-white panel are under 55 years of
age. One juror is 77, another 75.
Defense spokesman Michael
Holman claims the "mostly older"
panel reflects only one segment of the
ideological nature of San Bernardino
County.
"They have systematically excluded
Third World people, the young, and
the workers," he said.
According to Holman, who is the
son of Medicine Prof. Halsted Holman
and the brother of defendant Andrea
Holman Burt, one black student and a
young Chicano were dismissed after
questioning by Canty.
