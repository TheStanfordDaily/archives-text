# Band Shak Dies At 75: A Fight To The Finish
## 
### GLENN GARVIN 
About 4 p.m., Saturday, when the
Stanford Band Shak was still standing
up despite an hour of determined
hammering by 350 sledge-hammer
wielding maniacs, one Bandsman
shouted:
"It was better built than we
thought! Let's keep it."
The Shak, however, had a mind of
its own, and 15 minutes later most of
it went down by itself, nearly taking a
couple of Band members with it. Two
hours after that, the only part left
standing - the bathroom,
appropriately enough — was ripped
out, and the Shak was officially
pronounced dead at the age of 75.
About four hours after that,
someone cremated the body.
The Band took over the Shak, a
former eating house and ROTC stable,
about 40 years ago and almost
immediately began pleading for a new
headquarters. A few weeks ago it
finally got one - the old ROTC
building across Galvez St.from the
Athletic Department — and decided to
tear down the Shak in a final frenzy of
love/hate.
So the Band sent out engraved
BYOSH (Bring Your Own Sledge
Hammer) invitations to "the closing of
the western office of the Eastern
Michigan Buffalo Orphanage."
"Someone told me this was some
sort of secret band obscenity," mused
Jeff Littleboy of the Stanford News
Service, who got one of the

invitations, "but no one will explain it
to me."
Star-Studded Cast
The wrecking party brought
together a rather diverse collection of
Stanford celebrities. President Richard
Lyman was there, wearing a band
T-shirt ("What will the alumni say?"
someone shouted) with his wife Jing.
Jeff Littleboy and Harry Press of the
News Service, both former Bandsmen,
showed up.
Former Dollies Irene Maharam,
Mary Hernandez, and Laura Simon
made it, along with Timm Williams,
the Band's mascot for 20 years before

the Indian name was done away with
last year. Even Dean of Admissions
Fred Hargadon put in an appearance.
The Shak began to die at 2:47 p.m.
when Jing Lyman tossed a full bottle
of champagne through the last
remaining pane of glass. The Band
broke into "All Right Now" and
moments later, after the ceremonial
cannon was fired, the crowd rushed in
and began taking the place apart.
The wreckers used every manner of
weapon known to man against the
Shak. There were sledge hammers,
axes, hatchets, chainsaws, bedposts,
hammers, mops and lead pipes

battering away at the walls, and with
all the noise, someone could have died
inside without his screams being heard.
Harry Press used his heavy sledge on
the fireplace, for a long time the only
source of heat in the building.
'Outgrown'
"It was a wonderful place, but it's
been outgrown now," Press said as he
paused for a moment. "I'm delighted
that they got a new place ... this
place was just a house when I was here
[1935-1939] but these guys brought it
alive." Then he went back to killing it.
Timm Williams, better known as
Prince Lightfoot to most Stanford
people, walked through the building,
watching with a slightly-sad look. "I
first came in here 21 years ago, but
then it was just a building," Williams
said. "Since then, there's been a lot of
love and a lot of friendship exchanged
in here.
"It's just another passing time going
out the window. It's really going out
the window this time."
Irene Maharam, a dolly during
1970-1971, wearing her old dancing
uniform with the high-heeled boots,
hammered against a wall of the small
room the dollies used in the Shak.
Feathers And PomPons
"We put our feathers and pom pons
in there ... it was a place we could go
and talk while we were waiting for the
Band to get ready for a game," she
said, aiming a half-hearted kick at the
room. "We were always going to make
curtains and stuff, but we never got

around to it. This is kind of sad, it
really is. Where else do you have a
room papered with 50,000 egg
cartons?"

Charmaine Berry, winding up her
year as a dolly, was swinging a lead
pipe at the rear wall. "It's better that
we do it than having the University
hiring somebody to come in and do
it," she said. "This place had so much
personality."
Not everyone was feeling sad,
though. Dean Smith, a former Band
manager, shouted gleeful obscenities as
he used a small chainsaw on one wall.
"Doesn't it feel like you're cutting a
part off your own body?" a reporter
asked him.
"Yeah," he replied. "Like digging
out your appendix after it's infected."
'Why Are You Smiling?'
"I was watching this girl a little
while ago," Jeff Littleboy recounted.
"She walked around the place a couple
of times, and then said 'It's so sad to
tear this lovely old place down.' Her
boyfriend said, 'Then why are you
smiling*?' I wish I had heard the
answer."
By now it was 4 p.m. and all the
walls were gone. Everyone cleared out
and a jeep began tearing out uprights,
one by one. The Shak still stood,
though. To pass the time, the
Bandsmen began chanting "Shak up
Shak down!" Then they did "Shak
off!" for awhile. Then it was "Shak
six, jeep zero" and "So much for
four-wheel drive."
Drum major Bob Kurland played
taps for the dying Shak, and yelled
"All looters will be severely punished"
as a few Bandsmen grabbed packages
of toilet paper still stacked near the
bathroom.
Finally the main part of the Shak
went down, to wild applause and a few
fearful gasps as Bandsmen jumped out

like rats from a sinking ship. It was
almost another two hours before the
last upright was gone, though. Then
around 10:30 p.m. the remains went
up in flames. Band officials deny
having anything to do with the fire,
but one member observed that "if one
of us didn't do it, we should have."
And although they may never
admit it, undoubtedly a lot of the
Bandsmen agree with him.

"Yeah," he replied. "Like digging
out your appendix after it's infected."
'Why Are You Smiling?'
"I was watching this girl a little
while ago," Jeff Littleboy recounted.
"She walked around the place a couple
of times, and then said 'It's so sad to
tear this lovely old place down.' Her
boyfriend said, 'Then why are you
smiling*?' I wish I had heard the
answer."
By now it was 4 p.m. and all the
walls were gone. Everyone cleared out
and a jeep began tearing out uprights,
one by one. The Shak still stood,
though. To pass the time, the
Bandsmen began chanting "Shak up
Shak down!" Then they did "Shak
off!" for awhile. Then it was "Shak
six, jeep zero" and "So much for
four-wheel drive."
Drum major Bob Kurland played
taps for the dying Shak, and yelled
"All looters will be severely punished"
as a few Bandsmen grabbed packages
of toilet paper still stacked near the
bathroom.
Finally the main part of the Shak
went down, to wild applause and a few
fearful gasps as Bandsmen jumped out

like rats from a sinking ship. It was
almost another two hours before the
last upright was gone, though. Then
around 10:30 p.m. the remains went
up in flames. Band officials deny
having anything to do with the fire,
but one member observed that "if one
of us didn't do it, we should have."
And although they may never
admit it, undoubtedly a lot of the
Bandsmen agree with him.
About 4 p.m., Saturday, when the
Stanford Band Shak was still standing
up despite an hour of determined
hammering by 350 sledge-hammer
wielding maniacs, one Bandsman
shouted:
"It was better built than we
thought! Let's keep it."
The Shak, however, had a mind of
its own, and 15 minutes later most of
it went down by itself, nearly taking a
couple of Band members with it. Two
hours after that, the only part left
standing - the bathroom,
appropriately enough — was ripped
out, and the Shak was officially
pronounced dead at the age of 75.
About four hours after that,
someone cremated the body.
The Band took over the Shak, a
former eating house and ROTC stable,
about 40 years ago and almost
immediately began pleading for a new
headquarters. A few weeks ago it
finally got one - the old ROTC
building across Galvez St.from the
Athletic Department — and decided to
tear down the Shak in a final frenzy of
love/hate.
So the Band sent out engraved
BYOSH (Bring Your Own Sledge
Hammer) invitations to "the closing of
the western office of the Eastern
Michigan Buffalo Orphanage."
"Someone told me this was some
sort of secret band obscenity," mused
Jeff Littleboy of the Stanford News
Service, who got one of the

invitations, "but no one will explain it
to me."
Star-Studded Cast
The wrecking party brought
together a rather diverse collection of
Stanford celebrities. President Richard
Lyman was there, wearing a band
T-shirt ("What will the alumni say?"
someone shouted) with his wife Jing.
Jeff Littleboy and Harry Press of the
News Service, both former Bandsmen,
showed up.
Former Dollies Irene Maharam,
Mary Hernandez, and Laura Simon
made it, along with Timm Williams,
the Band's mascot for 20 years before

the Indian name was done away with
last year. Even Dean of Admissions
Fred Hargadon put in an appearance.
The Shak began to die at 2:47 p.m.
when Jing Lyman tossed a full bottle
of champagne through the last
remaining pane of glass. The Band
broke into "All Right Now" and
moments later, after the ceremonial
cannon was fired, the crowd rushed in
and began taking the place apart.
The wreckers used every manner of
weapon known to man against the
Shak. There were sledge hammers,
axes, hatchets, chainsaws, bedposts,
hammers, mops and lead pipes

battering away at the walls, and with
all the noise, someone could have died
inside without his screams being heard.
Harry Press used his heavy sledge on
the fireplace, for a long time the only
source of heat in the building.
'Outgrown'
"It was a wonderful place, but it's
been outgrown now," Press said as he
paused for a moment. "I'm delighted
that they got a new place ... this
place was just a house when I was here
[1935-1939] but these guys brought it
alive." Then he went back to killing it.
Timm Williams, better known as
Prince Lightfoot to most Stanford
people, walked through the building,
watching with a slightly-sad look. "I
first came in here 21 years ago, but
then it was just a building," Williams
said. "Since then, there's been a lot of
love and a lot of friendship exchanged
in here.
"It's just another passing time going
out the window. It's really going out
the window this time."
Irene Maharam, a dolly during
1970-1971, wearing her old dancing
uniform with the high-heeled boots,
hammered against a wall of the small
room the dollies used in the Shak.
Feathers And PomPons
"We put our feathers and pom pons
in there ... it was a place we could go
and talk while we were waiting for the
Band to get ready for a game," she
said, aiming a half-hearted kick at the
room. "We were always going to make
curtains and stuff, but we never got

around to it. This is kind of sad, it
really is. Where else do you have a
room papered with 50,000 egg
cartons?"

Charmaine Berry, winding up her
year as a dolly, was swinging a lead
pipe at the rear wall. "It's better that
we do it than having the University
hiring somebody to come in and do
it," she said. "This place had so much
personality."
Not everyone was feeling sad,
though. Dean Smith, a former Band
manager, shouted gleeful obscenities as
he used a small chainsaw on one wall.
"Doesn't it feel like you're cutting a
part off your own body?" a reporter
asked him.
"Yeah," he replied. "Like digging
out your appendix after it's infected."

around to it. This is kind of sad, it
really is. Where else do you have a
room papered with 50,000 egg
cartons?"

Charmaine Berry, winding up her
year as a dolly, was swinging a lead
pipe at the rear wall. "It's better that
we do it than having the University
hiring somebody to come in and do
it," she said. "This place had so much
personality."
Not everyone was feeling sad,
though. Dean Smith, a former Band
manager, shouted gleeful obscenities as
he used a small chainsaw on one wall.
"Doesn't it feel like you're cutting a
part off your own body?" a reporter
asked him.
"Yeah," he replied. "Like digging
out your appendix after it's infected."
'Why Are You Smiling?'
"I was watching this girl a little
while ago," Jeff Littleboy recounted.
"She walked around the place a couple
of times, and then said 'It's so sad to
tear this lovely old place down.' Her
boyfriend said, 'Then why are you
smiling*?' I wish I had heard the
answer."
By now it was 4 p.m. and all the
walls were gone. Everyone cleared out
and a jeep began tearing out uprights,
one by one. The Shak still stood,
though. To pass the time, the
Bandsmen began chanting "Shak up
Shak down!" Then they did "Shak
off!" for awhile. Then it was "Shak
six, jeep zero" and "So much for
four-wheel drive."
Drum major Bob Kurland played
taps for the dying Shak, and yelled
"All looters will be severely punished"
as a few Bandsmen grabbed packages
of toilet paper still stacked near the
bathroom.
Finally the main part of the Shak
went down, to wild applause and a few
fearful gasps as Bandsmen jumped out

like rats from a sinking ship. It was
almost another two hours before the
last upright was gone, though. Then
around 10:30 p.m. the remains went
up in flames. Band officials deny
having anything to do with the fire,
but one member observed that "if one
of us didn't do it, we should have."
And although they may never
admit it, undoubtedly a lot of the
Bandsmen agree with him.
About 4 p.m., Saturday, when the
Stanford Band Shak was still standing
up despite an hour of determined
hammering by 350 sledge-hammer
wielding maniacs, one Bandsman
shouted:
"It was better built than we
thought! Let's keep it."
The Shak, however, had a mind of
its own, and 15 minutes later most of
it went down by itself, nearly taking a
couple of Band members with it. Two
hours after that, the only part left
standing - the bathroom,
appropriately enough — was ripped
out, and the Shak was officially
pronounced dead at the age of 75.
About four hours after that,
someone cremated the body.
The Band took over the Shak, a
former eating house and ROTC stable,
about 40 years ago and almost
immediately began pleading for a new
headquarters. A few weeks ago it
finally got one - the old ROTC
building across Galvez St.from the
Athletic Department — and decided to
tear down the Shak in a final frenzy of
love/hate.
So the Band sent out engraved
BYOSH (Bring Your Own Sledge
Hammer) invitations to "the closing of
the western office of the Eastern
Michigan Buffalo Orphanage."
"Someone told me this was some
sort of secret band obscenity," mused
Jeff Littleboy of the Stanford News
Service, who got one of the

invitations, "but no one will explain it
to me."
Star-Studded Cast
The wrecking party brought
together a rather diverse collection of
Stanford celebrities. President Richard
Lyman was there, wearing a band
T-shirt ("What will the alumni say?"
someone shouted) with his wife Jing.
Jeff Littleboy and Harry Press of the
News Service, both former Bandsmen,
showed up.
Former Dollies Irene Maharam,
Mary Hernandez, and Laura Simon
made it, along with Timm Williams,
the Band's mascot for 20 years before

the Indian name was done away with
last year. Even Dean of Admissions
Fred Hargadon put in an appearance.
The Shak began to die at 2:47 p.m.
when Jing Lyman tossed a full bottle
of champagne through the last
remaining pane of glass. The Band
broke into "All Right Now" and
moments later, after the ceremonial
cannon was fired, the crowd rushed in
and began taking the place apart.
The wreckers used every manner of
weapon known to man against the
Shak. There were sledge hammers,
axes, hatchets, chainsaws, bedposts,
hammers, mops and lead pipes

battering away at the walls, and with
all the noise, someone could have died
inside without his screams being heard.
Harry Press used his heavy sledge on
the fireplace, for a long time the only
source of heat in the building.
'Outgrown'
"It was a wonderful place, but it's
been outgrown now," Press said as he
paused for a moment. "I'm delighted
that they got a new place ... this
place was just a house when I was here
[1935-1939] but these guys brought it
alive." Then he went back to killing it.
Timm Williams, better known as
Prince Lightfoot to most Stanford
people, walked through the building,
watching with a slightly-sad look. "I
first came in here 21 years ago, but
then it was just a building," Williams
said. "Since then, there's been a lot of
love and a lot of friendship exchanged
in here.
