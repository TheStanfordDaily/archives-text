# Shak Goes To Blazes
## 
### 
A fire totally destroyed the remains
of the Band Shak late Saturday night
after Band members had spent most of
the afternoon demolishing the
structure.
By the time Stanford firemen
arrived on the scene at about 10:30
p.m., flames had completely engulfed
the splintered ruins of the 75-year-old
Shak. Fire Chief Frank Jurian said he
instructed his men to let the fire burn,
taking care to save nearby eucalyptus
trees.
Jurian said that the fire was
definitely set, because all electricity
and gas for the building had been shut
off prior to its demolition. The chief
said he was fairly certain that a Band

member had set the fire.
Discussing the blaze, Band Manager
Doug Peterson said: "We hadn't
discussed that at all. I have no idea
who did it. I planned the whole
destruction party, and we intended to
just let it sit after we knocked it down.
We were just going to let the
University haul it away."
Peterson added that "the shak had
been so dear to us for so many years, 1
don't think anybody would do that. It
was such an easy target, anybody
could have done it."
Former Band Manager Dean Smith
said that burning the remains of the
Shak had been "discussed
jokingly ... but no one was serious
about it. At least no one I know."
