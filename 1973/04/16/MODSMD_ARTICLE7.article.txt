# Amendments
## 
### 
So lengthy is this week's ASSU ballot that a single editorial
could not cover all the proposed constitutional amendments.
Here are the Daily recommendations for the three
amendments our April 12 editorial did not include.
Assessment Validity
The Daily recommends a YES vote on the amendment
requiring that a fee assessment be voted on by at least 20
percent of the ASSU constituents to be valid. This
amendment would safeguard against a campaign designed to
create a low, but partisan, voter turnout. This amendment is
non-controversial and should be supported as a logical
safeguard.
Program Fee Timing
The Daily recommends a YES vote on the amendment
requiring that the program fee referendum be held at the
same time as the first presidential primary. This is only
logical, since the presidential election receives the highest
voter turnout and the program fee should receive the
greatest possible voter scrutiny.
Financial Reorganization .
The Daily recommends a YES vote on the amendment
reorganizing the ASSU financial operations. The proposed
changes are non-controversial and should be supported, since
they will serve to make the ASSU financial operations more
efficient.
