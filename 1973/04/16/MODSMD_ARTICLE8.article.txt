# Opinions Page Policy
## 
### 
To the polls, ye sons of freedom. Today and tomorrow the
Daily opinions page will be chock-full of election propaganda.
Fairness dictates, however, that debate be stilled before
election day itself.
The new Council of Preisdents will doubtless need ideas,
and the Daily is still aspiring to the presentation of a lively
exchange of significant ones. In other words, get writing.
Technical notes: all letters and articles must be typewritten,
double-spaced, on a 62-space line. Remember that brievity is
the soul of wit, honesty the best policy, and patriotism the last
refuge of scoundrels.
As Daniel Brenner is on special assignment in New York, his
regular Monday column does not appear today.
