# Fraternities Resume Annual Spring Rush Process
## 
### PETER ALESHIRE 
This month, 11 fraternities on campus will spend
a total of $13,000-14,000 to attract new members
an average of $60 for each prospective pledge.
Although the number of fraternities on campus
has shrunk from 26 to 14 since 1960, Rush
chairmen are hopeful that the number of pledges
will increase sharply this spring. "Definitely there is
a changed mood on the Stanford campus this year,"
says Jim Yedor, Rush chairman at Phi Delta Theta.
"Three years ago, almost uniformly, Rushes were
not working. This year my guess is that 300 will
pledge."
To insure a high number of pledges, many of the
fraternities continue to throw the big parties
traditionally associated with Rush. The average frat
spends $1200 during Rush. Open houses, weekend
parties, Sunday barbecues, and the bid parties at the
end of Rush are designed to entice the potential
pledge.
Some houses go in for more exotic
entertainment. At least two frats plan to have
strippers at Rush activities. Casino nights, trips to
the beach or to San Francisco, and dinners are also
being financed by some fraternities.
Undergraduate Response
Whether the parties influence the typical
undergraduate male who is looking for a place to
live is debatable. Larry Kouns of Larkin says he
went to Rush for, "the drinking," and because he's
worried about the housing draw. Kouns wants, "a

good home, and not being stuck in Stern next
year."
In response to the negative stereotype some
students have of fraternities, Rush chairmen are
stressing the diversity of their houses. Jim Holbrook
of Sigma Alpha Epsilon (SAE) says the fraternities
have "a little bit of everything . . . Years ago Rush
Week was very formal: coat and tie, fraternity pin,
no liquor served." In contrast, frats now try to give
an honest idea of what a house is like.
"We've definitely changed our attitude toward
Rush," says Dan Gerken, president of Alpha Delta
Phi. "People used to come to the fraternity; now
the fraternity has to go to them. We went out and
met freshmen early in the year. Now that Rush has
started, we're sending people down to different
individuals." He says Alpha Delt had contacted
about 70 freshmen.
Individual Contact
Many fraternities are emphasizing individual
contact, both through classes and meal exchange
programs. Chairmen stress the need for rushees to
see the fraternity at different times. Gerken says,"I
really don't think Rush is that realistic. It is
artificial to an extent. When you get to know the
house is when you get to talking to people."
Despite artificialities, fraternities are in need of
members, and Rush activities are a way to attract
them. Gary DeSmet, president of Sigma Chi Omega,
admits his house competes with other houses for
pledges. "Sometimes it's a game of who can impress
them the most. The important thing [for the

freshman] is, are you going to want to live with
these guys next year?"
Gerken of the Alpha Delts and Yedor of the Phi
Delts agree that there is competition betv/een
fraternities. However, Yedor says, "Only one or two
houses will compete for the same person."
Some houses are dropping out of the
competition by filling their houses through the
housing draw. Kappa Sigma, Alpha Sigma Phi, and
Theta Chi will not participate in the Rush process.
Eliminates Dues
According to Kappa Sigma president John
Redenbaugh, "We're just trying to get people to live
here without making them pay [the national
fraternity membership dues]." In addition to
entering the draw, Theta Chi is going co-ed.
Joining Theta Chi as a co-ed house is Kappa
Alpha, but KA is still in the Rush and will require
male residents to pay a $100 national membership
fee. Kappa Alpha will try to keep a two-to-three
ratio of women to men.
Atmosphere will probably figure most in the
minds of the freshmen trying to decide which frat
to rush. "I still haven't made up my mind," said
Richard Shong of Donner. Shong likes the locations,
the people, and the receptionist who greeted him
with a kiss at the door.
Wade Nonnenberg, also of Donner, likes the
fraternity rooms and the parties. "All the studs get
together so they can get rowdy," he said with a grin.
"One thing about frats during Rush Week," he
advised thickly, "they sure try to get you loaded."
