## FCC: The Regulation Of Taste 
### 
Chris Hocker

Imagine a product which has
an enormous popularity among all
sectors of the population. This
product has the potential for
being incredibly diverse; the
number of forms it can take is
literally infinite. And its appeal to
people is as wide-ranging as the
people themselves.
Imagine further that artificial
limitations have been imposed on
this product. These limitations,
imposed by a source of absolute

power, have tended to bring a dull
uniformity to the product.
The industry is dominated by
three or four major producers
who are able, with assistance from
the source of power, to keep
competitors out of the market.
The population, from all sectors,
has become more and more
dissatisfied over the low quality of
the product, its repetitiveness, and
the lack of response that the
consumers are able to generate
from the producers.
Yet, incredibly, the people call
out for more and more restriction
and regulation of the industry.
"Make it responsive to us," they
cry, and the power source duly
responds with increasing authority
and power. And, because the
power source is absolute, the
product comes increasingly to be
what the power-wielders want it
to be, and decreasingly what the
people want it to be.
One need not be terribly
imaginative to recognize the
broadcast industry in this
scenario. The absolute source of
power is, of course, the United
States government in the form of
the Federal Communications
Commission (FCC). And the
people — well, they're the ones
who want to see or hear more
community-oriented
programming, or a greater variety
of shows, or fewer reruns.
Or, in the case of a recent act
of FCC intervention, they want to
sit and listen to women tell about
their sex lives to middle-age disc

jockeys drooling into their
microphones.
The passing of "California
Girls" in San Francisco and
"Femine Forum" in Los Angeles,
to give two prominent examples,
raised nary an eyebrow in the
university community, usually a
zealous guardian of civil liberties,
real and imagined. All seemed to
agree with FCC chairman Dean
Burch, that these shows were
somehow too crass (substitute too
sexist and middle-class) to be
worthy of defense.
And undoubtedly, by
conventional standards of taste,
these shows were at best crass (I
don't really know, having never
listened to them). They were
certainly unacceptable to Dean
Burch and the rest of the FCC,
including the hero of the Stanford
Communication Department,
Nicholas Johnson.
Of course, by conventional
Orange County standards of taste,
Marxism is at best cockeyed and
shouldn't be allowed on the air.
And, by conventional Stanford
standards of taste, the advocacy
of laissez-faire capitalism is at best
anachronistic and should be kept
from the airwaves. And by .. .
But enough of that — my point
is obvious. It is not up to anyone
to determine standards of taste
except for himself and perhaps for
his children. It is certainly not up
to Dean Burch in Washington to
decide that residents of Los
Angeles shouldn't be allowed to
hear some poor woman tell half a

million people that nothing
excites her anymore except the
sight of her canary in her
husband's jockey shorts.
Correction: All this is not up
to Dean Burch UNLESS we define
him as a public official, give him
authority over public property,
and arm him with a thick booklet
of public regulations that we
permit him to enforce. This we
have done, or, more properly, the
government has done for us. And
the more people clamor for
government regulation over the
broadcast industry, the more
they're going to get of exactly
that.
The problem is that the
government does not and can not
discriminate between "good"
regulation and "bad" regulation,
simply because different pressure
groups define these terms
differently. The government is in
business simply to regulate. And,
with tacit public support, it finds
its business increasingly easy to
accomplish.
Who's Next
The choice, then, is not
between varying forms of
regulation, but between regulation
and non-regulation, freedom and
restriction. Perhaps the
"California Girls" case is trivial,
but it is exemplary of the
government's willingness to usurp
the function of the marketplace.
I wonder what program will be
next.

dissatisfied over the low quality of
the product, its repetitiveness, and
the lack of response that the
consumers are able to generate
from the producers.
Yet, incredibly, the people call
out for more and more restriction
and regulation of the industry.
"Make it responsive to us," they
cry, and the power source duly
responds with increasing authority
and power. And, because the
power source is absolute, the
product comes increasingly to be
what the power-wielders want it
to be, and decreasingly what the
people want it to be.
One need not be terribly
imaginative to recognize the
broadcast industry in this
scenario. The absolute source of
power is, of course, the United
States government in the form of
the Federal Communications
Commission (FCC). And the
people — well, they're the ones
who want to see or hear more
community-oriented
programming, or a greater variety
of shows, or fewer reruns.
Or, in the case of a recent act
of FCC intervention, they want to
sit and listen to women tell about
their sex lives to middle-age disc

jockeys drooling into their
microphones.
The passing of "California
Girls" in San Francisco and
"Femine Forum" in Los Angeles,
to give two prominent examples,
raised nary an eyebrow in the
university community, usually a
zealous guardian of civil liberties,
real and imagined. All seemed to
agree with FCC chairman Dean
Burch, that these shows were
somehow too crass (substitute too
sexist and middle-class) to be
worthy of defense.
And undoubtedly, by
conventional standards of taste,
these shows were at best crass (I
don't really know, having never
listened to them). They were
certainly unacceptable to Dean
Burch and the rest of the FCC,
including the hero of the Stanford
Communication Department,
Nicholas Johnson.
Of course, by conventional
Orange County standards of taste,
Marxism is at best cockeyed and
shouldn't be allowed on the air.
And, by conventional Stanford
standards of taste, the advocacy
of laissez-faire capitalism is at best
anachronistic and should be kept
from the airwaves. And by .. .
But enough of that — my point
is obvious. It is not up to anyone
to determine standards of taste
except for himself and perhaps for
his children. It is certainly not up
to Dean Burch in Washington to
decide that residents of Los
Angeles shouldn't be allowed to
hear some poor woman tell half a

million people that nothing
excites her anymore except the
sight of her canary in her
husband's jockey shorts.
Correction: All this is not up
to Dean Burch UNLESS we define
him as a public official, give him
authority over public property,
and arm him with a thick booklet
of public regulations that we
permit him to enforce. This we
have done, or, more properly, the
government has done for us. And
the more people clamor for
government regulation over the
broadcast industry, the more
they're going to get of exactly
that.
The problem is that the
government does not and can not
discriminate between "good"
regulation and "bad" regulation,
simply because different pressure
groups define these terms
differently. The government is in
business simply to regulate. And,
with tacit public support, it finds
its business increasingly easy to
accomplish.
Who's Next
The choice, then, is not
between varying forms of
regulation, but between regulation
and non-regulation, freedom and
restriction. Perhaps the
"California Girls" case is trivial,
but it is exemplary of the
government's willingness to usurp
the function of the marketplace.
I wonder what program will be
next.

Imagine a product which has
an enormous popularity among all
sectors of the population. This
product has the potential for
being incredibly diverse; the
number of forms it can take is
literally infinite. And its appeal to
people is as wide-ranging as the
people themselves.
Imagine further that artificial
limitations have been imposed on
this product. These limitations,
imposed by a source of absolute

power, have tended to bring a dull
uniformity to the product.

three or four major producers

the source of power, to keep
competitors out of the market.
