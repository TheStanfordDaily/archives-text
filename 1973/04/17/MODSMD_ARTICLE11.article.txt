Voluntary Fee
Editor:
Your editorial opinion against
the Voluntary Fee Amendment
was surprising in light of your
position favoring the Refundable
Amendment last Fall Quarter,
which passed. Then, you said:
"No student should have to pay
for a service that he doesn't want
or need." What has changed since
then?
The present voluntary
provision says in effect: "You
may choose not to pay your fee;
we'll just make it difficult for
you." This is not free choice, but
merely an attempt to please
everybody.
To favor a refundable
assessment and oppose a
voluntary assessment means that
you view the issue as quantitative,
not qualitative. It means that your
primary interest is still making
sure that student groups have a
maximum of student dollars to
play with.
Those of us who favor the
Voluntary Fee Amendment, on
the other hand, are concerned
with maximizing freedom of
choice.

Though pretending to play no
public role whatsoever in the
upcoming election, Scott Burke
has chosen to look for a
bogey-man in the camp of the
opponent of his friend and
protege Pete Van Petten.
"Brother" Burke does his best to
convey the depth of his
commitment to minorities.
Yet it was the ASSU, in the
form of Pete Van Petten, which
was part of an unsuccessful vote
to not allow the Real News
budget to even be considered by
the Publications Board.
Charles Ogletree's attendance
at Pub Board meetings has been
spotty — which isn't surprising in
light of the fact that he's not on
it.
As the Real News
representative on the board I am
outraged and somewhat amused
by Burke's error. Besides being
about half a foot taller, I
outweigh Charles by about fifty
pounds with my glasses on. I
know we all look alike to some,
but Burke, "in a desperate
attempt to win votes, has stooped
to outright distortion and
intentional falsehoods ..
