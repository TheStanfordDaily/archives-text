# Crucial To Student Organizations
## No On Voluntary Fees 
### 
Appel, Barber And Snook

Among the measures on the ASSU ballot this week is a proposed
constitutional amendment that would require all fee assessments to be
"voluntary," rather than "refundable." This seems like just a semantic
technicality, but there is in fact a difference that would be crucial to
the organizations that are asking for money.
Under the current "refundable" method, the money for the
assessment is added to the tuition bill. If a student decides that he
doesn't want to support that organization, he can go to the ASSU
offices anytime during a two-week period at the beginning of the
quarter to have his money refunded. One proposal for the
"voluntary" system would have each student choose at registration
whether or not he would pay the fee, by checking "Yes" or "No" on
his PTR.
The proponents of the voluntary system maintain that this system
would give every student a freedom of choice as to whether or not he
would support the organization receiving the fee. Those who
altruistically search for freedom and lower taxes at Stanford
University overlook three basic realities.
Easy
The first fact that they ignore is that it is already easy to have your
money refunded, if you decide that you don't want to support an
organization. Voluntarists argue that the hassles involved make it so
difficult to get a refund that the system may as well be compulsory.
Contrary to popular belief, it is a simple process; there are no long
lines, and little paperwork. It's much easier to get your money back
than it is to pay it in the first place. If a student wants his money
back, he will generally have little problem getting it.
The second point is that typically, those fee assessments that have
been passed have been for organizations that benefit virtually
everyone at Stanford. Almost everyone reads the Daily, including
many of those who asked for their refund on the Daily assessment.
Other organizations which have received money recently, such as
KZSU and the LSJUMB, usually benefit the vast majority of Stanford
students, or they tend not to get passed. Anyone can listen to KZSU,
or enjoy the Band; those who sincerely don't can get their money
refunded with little effort.
The purpose of the voluntary fee amendment is to make it easy for
students to not pay for services from which they will probably
benefit, whether or not they have paid. It is hard to believe that all of
the 600 students who had their Daily money refunded have not
looked at the Daily. If they have, they are gypping the students who
have paid. To make it easier for some students to not pay makes it
even more unfair for those who do.
Uncertainty
Third, accurate budgeting would become virtually impossible for
the groups with fee assessments. Under the refundable fee system the
groups know, within a five percent margin of error, how much money
they will have the next year. Realistic budgets can be drawn up; the
group knows how much money to ask for, and it can figure out
exactly how that money will be spent. Under a voluntary system it
would be very difficult for any group to know until registration how

much money it would receive, even within a 25 percent error. The
financial uncertainty would be vastly increased, and as any
businessman knows, an uncertain budget is not really a budget. To ask
that the groups operate so much in the dark is to invite the financial
destruction of the organizations that the fee assessment was designed
to help.
The current refundable system provides for fairly accurate
budgeting and sufficient freedom of choice for students. True, under
the voluntary assessment it would be easier to not pay, but it is not
hard to get your money back now. It is unfair to those who do pay to
increase the number of those who don't, when the money goes to a
service from which everyone benefits. And finally, the resulting
uncertainty in budgeting makes impossible the accurate budgeting
that you would expect from a group that is asking for your money.
In summary, the voluntary fee amendment is an ill-conceived effort
to give the students a freedom that they already have at the expense
of the organizations that fee assessments are supposed to help. We
urge its defeat.

Among the measures on the ASSU ballot this week is a proposed
constitutional amendment that would require all fee assessments to be
"voluntary," rather than "refundable." This seems like just a semantic
technicality, but there is in fact a difference that would be crucial to
the organizations that are asking for money.
Under the current "refundable" method, the money for the
assessment is added to the tuition bill. If a student decides that he
doesn't want to support that organization, he can go to the ASSU
offices anytime during a two-week period at the beginning of the
quarter to have his money refunded. One proposal for the
"voluntary" system would have each student choose at registration
whether or not he would pay the fee, by checking "Yes" or "No" on
his PTR.
The proponents of the voluntary system maintain that this system
would give every student a freedom of choice as to whether or not he
would support the organization receiving the fee. Those who
altruistically search for freedom and lower taxes at Stanford
University overlook three basic realities.
Easy
The first fact that they ignore is that it is already easy to have your
money refunded, if you decide that you don't want to support an
organization. Voluntarists argue that the hassles involved make it so
difficult to get a refund that the system may as well be compulsory.
Contrary to popular belief, it is a simple process; there are no long
lines, and little paperwork. It's much easier to get your money back
than it is to pay it in the first place. If a student wants his money
back, he will generally have little problem getting it.
The second point is that typically, those fee assessments that have
been passed have been for organizations that benefit virtually
everyone at Stanford. Almost everyone reads the Daily, including
many of those who asked for their refund on the Daily assessment.
Other organizations which have received money recently, such as
KZSU and the LSJUMB, usually benefit the vast majority of Stanford
students, or they tend not to get passed. Anyone can listen to KZSU,
or enjoy the Band; those who sincerely don't can get their money
refunded with little effort.
The purpose of the voluntary fee amendment is to make it easy for
students to not pay for services from which they will probably
benefit, whether or not they have paid. It is hard to believe that all of
the 600 students who had their Daily money refunded have not
looked at the Daily. If they have, they are gypping the students who
have paid. To make it easier for some students to not pay makes it
even more unfair for those who do.
Uncertainty
Third, accurate budgeting would become virtually impossible for
the groups with fee assessments. Under the refundable fee system the
groups know, within a five percent margin of error, how much money
they will have the next year. Realistic budgets can be drawn up; the
group knows how much money to ask for, and it can figure out
exactly how that money will be spent. Under a voluntary system it
would be very difficult for any group to know until registration how

much money it would receive, even within a 25 percent error. The
financial uncertainty would be vastly increased, and as any
businessman knows, an uncertain budget is not really a budget. To ask
that the groups operate so much in the dark is to invite the financial
destruction of the organizations that the fee assessment was designed
to help.
The current refundable system provides for fairly accurate
budgeting and sufficient freedom of choice for students. True, under
the voluntary assessment it would be easier to not pay, but it is not
hard to get your money back now. It is unfair to those who do pay to
increase the number of those who don't, when the money goes to a
service from which everyone benefits. And finally, the resulting
uncertainty in budgeting makes impossible the accurate budgeting
that you would expect from a group that is asking for your money.
In summary, the voluntary fee amendment is an ill-conceived effort
to give the students a freedom that they already have at the expense
of the organizations that fee assessments are supposed to help. We
urge its defeat.
