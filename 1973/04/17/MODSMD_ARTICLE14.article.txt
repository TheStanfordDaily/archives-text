# ASSU Candidates: Money, Education
## 
### 
In order to better inform our readers of the
positions and platforms of candidates in this
week's ASSU presidential election, the Daily
has invited all slates to respond to a series of
four questions. Today, the candidates'
answers to questions on ASSU finances and
education.
Money
Today's number one query: Concerning
ASSU funding, do you favor or oppose the
passage of an ASSU program fee? What is
your position on the ASSU's annual $92,000
budget, derived from the University's general
fund?
(Judy Gans and Buzz Thompson reply:)
We oppose the passage of the Program Fee
for two reasons. First, the fee would not be
truly voluntary, although it would be
refundable. Unless the Voluntary Fee
Amendment also on the ballot is passed, the
Program Fee will remain a mechanism by
which students are taxed for "services" they
neither want nor need.
Second, we believe that student
organizations should be supported on an
individual basis, according to their value to
each student. If an organiation is not able to
sustain itself through voluntary means, it
certainly has no business being supported
by involuntary means
We have examined the record of the
$92,000 ASSU budget for this year, and have
found an appalling amount of money that has
been spent wastefully by anyone's standards.
With other University departments crying for
funds, we find it at least peculiar that such an
expensive plaything as the ASSU is permitted
to exist at all.
We favor a student government financed
directly by those students who wish to
participate in it. The funding for such an
operation would not be rechanneled through
the University hierarchy in a fixed amount,
but would vary from quarter to quarter
depending on the support given by the
students. This way, if the ASSU really could
provide "student services"—which we
doubt—those who desired these services could
pay in as much as they wanted without
imposing on the wishes of others.
(Kevin O'Grady, Beth Garfield, Charles
Ogletree. and Jim Friend reply:)
We support the passage of an ASSU
program fee. This fee gives smaller student
organizations and projects which cannot gain
funding elsewhere a chance to survive.
The program fee which appears on the
ballot is the result of a careful investigation by
the Senate Finance Committee to determine
that all program fee requests are in line with
actual needs and that the funds will be used
for worthwhile ends. Approximately
two-thirds of the student body participates in
one or more of the over two hundred student
organizations, all of which are given an equal
chance to submit program fee requests. Since
the fee is refundable, any student who
conscientiously feels that he will receive no
benefit from any of the student organizations
or programs can get his dollar back.
The campaign rhetoric of several
candidates has been misleading as to the
actual uses of the $92,000 the ASSU receives
from the University. This money constitutes
the operating budget and is not intended for
the direct support of programs or
organizations.
The vast bulk of the $92,000 is used to pay
for office personnel and supplies needed to
provide financial services to the Student
Organization Fund accounts. These accounts
include all residences, clubs, and special
projects such as the Travel Service, Special
Events, and Sunday Flicks.
Because the University's tax status requires
that these accounts remain on campus, the
ASSU operations represent an accessible
student-run alternative to the more
cumbersome university accounting system.

Unless all ASSU services and student
organizations are to be abolished, elimination
of the operating budget would simply mean
that the University would have to provide the
services now provided by the ASSU.
(Peter Van Petten, Jim Anderson, Tom Flohr,
and Charles "Buck" Schott reply;)
We find ourselves deadlocked on the
question of an endorsement for the ASSU
program fee. Half the slate believes that no
recommendation can be made; half that we
should endorse it, albeit half-heartedly.
Some allocations in the program fee
support broad-based student interests such as
the ASSU Course Review.
On the other hand, many allocations are
made to small special interests who have little
claim on the students' money.
We cannot conscientiously endorse the
program fee, however, the effect it will have
on limiting special fee assessments and the
money it provides some deserving student
organiztions indicates a vote for the program
fee as the least objectionable alternative.
Most of the $92,000 ASSU budget is used
to provide banking services for student
organizations (dorms, frats, clubs, etc.)
Without ASSU the University would be forced
to do so at a far greater cost, for it would be
forced to hire professional employees to
replace the low-cost student now working at
ASSU. It is the duty of ASSU officers
to justify budget expenses by channeling their
energies in ways which can bring beneficial
changes within the University.
Education
The final question: The first business of
Stanford students, although one might not
know it from observing the ASSU, is
education. What do you see as your role in
educational policy-making? Are you
proposing any specific educational reforms or
innovations?
(Judy Gans and Buzz Thompson reply:)
We believe that educational innovation can
take place regardless of whether or not an
ASSU structure exists, provided the ideas are
sound in the first place. There need not be an
ASSU in order to have a Course Review, for
example.
It would be inconsistent for us to claim
that compulsory student government is
acceptable for educational matters, and
unacceptable for anything else. Since
"educational reform" at present encompasses
undergraduates almost exclusively, nearly half
the student body has been effectively
disenfranchised under the present mandatory
system.
As representatives of both undergraduate
and graduate levels, we do maintain an
interest in educational innovation on an equal
basis. In particular, we would like to see the
following ideas studied further:
1. The "Internal Voucher" system, by
which students may designate part of their
tuition money toward hiring professors from
other universities.
2. The "Challenge Credit" system, by
which students may receive credit for a course
merely by passing a final examination,
without actually taking the course.
To repeat, the existence of a compulsary
ASSU is in no way a prerequisite for
educational change at Stanford.
(Kevin O'Grady, Beth Garfield, Charles
Ogletree, and Jim Friend reply:)
Stanford's commitment to quality
undergraduate education is one of our
primary concerns. We realize that the ASSU is
limited in its ability to effect educational
policy-making. At the same time we feel that
there are a number of specific proposals which
the ASSU can quite realistically sponsor that
will improve the Stanford educational
experience.
One very concrete improvement would be
the distribution of lecture outlines by
professors in large lecture classes. Several

years ago, medical students succeeded in
making this a policy at the Medical School.
There is no reason why undergraduates could
not achieve the same result.
We propose a student produced volume
called the "Student Guide to Stanford
Education." The "Guide" would include the
present course review as well as listings of
faculty research projects in which students
could get involved, listings of professors with
special expertise who are willing to sponsor
independent work, and suggestions about
ways in which students can work to improve
curriculum through undergraduate
associations.
We also propose that a
"Guest-In-Residence" program be established
within the residence system. Several years ago
there was such a program in Wilbur that
brought prominent people to campus such as
Erich Fromm, Frank Church and William
Sloan Coffin, to talk and interact with
students.
We feel that it is important to defend the
autonomy of SWOPSI and SCIRE, the two
programs most responsible for providing
innovative education at Stanford. We would
also work for the creation of new programs in
women's and Jewish studies.
(Peter Van Petten, Jim Anderson, Tom Flohr,
and Charles "Buck" Schott reply:)
We recognize that the role the ASSU can
play in educational policy-making is limited.
However, as ASSU Presidents we will wo rk for
the following changes.
First, we favor the elimination of the
University undergraduate distribution
requirements. They are a demonstrated failure
and serve only to make students search for
easy science or humanities courses they wo uld
not have otherwise taken.
Second, we will work for a six-year BS-MD
program similar to those existing at
Northwestern, Boston University and Johns
Hopkins as an alternative to the current grind
that now faces the Stanford pre-med.
Third, we feel students should be able to
take tests for credit. If a student can
demonstrate sufficient knowledge in a course
area and pass an exam, he should be exempt
from the course requirement and obtain
credit.
Finally, with the ASSU we will establish a
central test file, containing old finals and
midterms from as many classes as possible.
(Fred Choate and Ed Ryu reply:)
Because the government is now forced to
take on and seek to destroy the strength of
the working class, the trade unions, in order
to drive down and smash the standard of
living won by the American working class,
higher education is of no use to the capitalist
system, except as a breeding ground for racist
and fascist ideology, and a center for
counterrevolutionary research, as at the
Hoover Institution.
This is the significance of Shockley, who
now emerges with the open support of the
Stanford administration and fhe financial
backing of powerful business interests, to play
the role played by right-wing ideologues in the
universities of Germany in the 19305.
The Young Socialists understand that the
defense of the right to higher education is a
revolutionary demand. Therefore it can only
be defended by turning to the labor
movement and building the alternative
revolutionary leadership in the unions through
the fight for a labor party and a workers
government pledged to socialist policies.
The Young Socialists demand:
—No cuts in work-study, loans, or
scholarships.
—No hikes in tuition, room, or board.
—No layoffs of professors or staff.
—Free higher education for all.
No answer to the question on finances was
received from candidates Choate and Ryu. No
statements were received from candidates
Meyer, Garcia, or Chaffey.

provide "student services"—which we
doubt—those who desired these services could
pay in as much as they wanted without
imposing on the wishes of others.
(Kevin O'Grady, Beth Garfield, Charles
Ogletree. and Jim Friend reply:)
We support the passage of an ASSU
program fee. This fee gives smaller student
organizations and projects which cannot gain
funding elsewhere a chance to survive.
The program fee which appears on the
ballot is the result of a careful investigation by
the Senate Finance Committee to determine
that all program fee requests are in line with
actual needs and that the funds will be used
for worthwhile ends. Approximately
two-thirds of the student body participates in
one or more of the over two hundred student
organizations, all of which are given an equal
chance to submit program fee requests. Since
the fee is refundable, any student who
conscientiously feels that he will receive no
benefit from any of the student organizations
or programs can get his dollar back.
The campaign rhetoric of several
candidates has been misleading as to the
actual uses of the $92,000 the ASSU receives
from the University. This money constitutes
the operating budget and is not intended for
the direct support of programs or
organizations.
The vast bulk of the $92,000 is used to pay
for office personnel and supplies needed to
provide financial services to the Student
Organization Fund accounts. These accounts
include all residences, clubs, and special
projects such as the Travel Service, Special
Events, and Sunday Flicks.
Because the University's tax status requires
that these accounts remain on campus, the
ASSU operations represent an accessible
student-run alternative to the more
cumbersome university accounting system.

Unless all ASSU services and student
organizations are to be abolished, elimination
of the operating budget would simply mean
that the University would have to provide the
services now provided by the ASSU.
(Peter Van Petten, Jim Anderson, Tom Flohr,
and Charles "Buck" Schott reply;)
We find ourselves deadlocked on the
question of an endorsement for the ASSU
program fee. Half the slate believes that no
recommendation can be made; half that we
should endorse it, albeit half-heartedly.
Some allocations in the program fee
support broad-based student interests such as
the ASSU Course Review.
On the other hand, many allocations are
made to small special interests who have little
claim on the students' money.
We cannot conscientiously endorse the
program fee, however, the effect it will have
on limiting special fee assessments and the
money it provides some deserving student
organiztions indicates a vote for the program
fee as the least objectionable alternative.
Most of the $92,000 ASSU budget is used
to provide banking services for student
organizations (dorms, frats, clubs, etc.)
Without ASSU the University would be forced
to do so at a far greater cost, for it would be
forced to hire professional employees to
replace the low-cost student now working at
ASSU. It is the duty of ASSU officers
to justify budget expenses by channeling their
energies in ways which can bring beneficial
changes within the University.
Education
The final question: The first business of
Stanford students, although one might not
know it from observing the ASSU, is
education. What do you see as your role in
educational policy-making? Are you
proposing any specific educational reforms or
innovations?
(Judy Gans and Buzz Thompson reply:)
We believe that educational innovation can
take place regardless of whether or not an
ASSU structure exists, provided the ideas are
sound in the first place. There need not be an
ASSU in order to have a Course Review, for
example.
It would be inconsistent for us to claim
that compulsory student government is
acceptable for educational matters, and
unacceptable for anything else. Since
"educational reform" at present encompasses
undergraduates almost exclusively, nearly half
the student body has been effectively
disenfranchised under the present mandatory
system.
As representatives of both undergraduate
and graduate levels, we do maintain an
interest in educational innovation on an equal
basis. In particular, we would like to see the
following ideas studied further:
1. The "Internal Voucher" system, by
which students may designate part of their
tuition money toward hiring professors from
other universities.
2. The "Challenge Credit" system, by
which students may receive credit for a course
merely by passing a final examination,
without actually taking the course.
To repeat, the existence of a compulsary
ASSU is in no way a prerequisite for
educational change at Stanford.
(Kevin O'Grady, Beth Garfield, Charles
Ogletree, and Jim Friend reply:)
Stanford's commitment to quality
undergraduate education is one of our
primary concerns. We realize that the ASSU is
limited in its ability to effect educational
policy-making. At the same time we feel that
there are a number of specific proposals which
the ASSU can quite realistically sponsor that
will improve the Stanford educational
experience.
One very concrete improvement would be
the distribution of lecture outlines by
professors in large lecture classes. Several

years ago, medical students succeeded in
making this a policy at the Medical School.
There is no reason why undergraduates could
not achieve the same result.
We propose a student produced volume
called the "Student Guide to Stanford
Education." The "Guide" would include the
present course review as well as listings of
faculty research projects in which students
could get involved, listings of professors with
special expertise who are willing to sponsor
independent work, and suggestions about
ways in which students can work to improve
curriculum through undergraduate
associations.
We also propose that a
"Guest-In-Residence" program be established
within the residence system. Several years ago
there was such a program in Wilbur that
brought prominent people to campus such as
Erich Fromm, Frank Church and William
Sloan Coffin, to talk and interact with
students.
We feel that it is important to defend the
autonomy of SWOPSI and SCIRE, the two
programs most responsible for providing
innovative education at Stanford. We would
also work for the creation of new programs in
women's and Jewish studies.
(Peter Van Petten, Jim Anderson, Tom Flohr,
and Charles "Buck" Schott reply:)
We recognize that the role the ASSU can
play in educational policy-making is limited.
However, as ASSU Presidents we will wo rk for
the following changes.
First, we favor the elimination of the
University undergraduate distribution
requirements. They are a demonstrated failure
and serve only to make students search for
easy science or humanities courses they wo uld
not have otherwise taken.
Second, we will work for a six-year BS-MD
program similar to those existing at
Northwestern, Boston University and Johns
Hopkins as an alternative to the current grind
that now faces the Stanford pre-med.
Third, we feel students should be able to
take tests for credit. If a student can
demonstrate sufficient knowledge in a course
area and pass an exam, he should be exempt
from the course requirement and obtain
credit.
Finally, with the ASSU we will establish a
central test file, containing old finals and
midterms from as many classes as possible.
(Fred Choate and Ed Ryu reply:)
Because the government is now forced to
take on and seek to destroy the strength of
the working class, the trade unions, in order
to drive down and smash the standard of
living won by the American working class,
higher education is of no use to the capitalist
system, except as a breeding ground for racist
and fascist ideology, and a center for
counterrevolutionary research, as at the
Hoover Institution.
This is the significance of Shockley, who
now emerges with the open support of the
Stanford administration and fhe financial
backing of powerful business interests, to play
the role played by right-wing ideologues in the
universities of Germany in the 19305.
The Young Socialists understand that the
defense of the right to higher education is a
revolutionary demand. Therefore it can only
be defended by turning to the labor
movement and building the alternative
revolutionary leadership in the unions through
the fight for a labor party and a workers
government pledged to socialist policies.
The Young Socialists demand:
—No cuts in work-study, loans, or
scholarships.
—No hikes in tuition, room, or board.
—No layoffs of professors or staff.
—Free higher education for all.
No answer to the question on finances was
received from candidates Choate and Ryu. No
statements were received from candidates
Meyer, Garcia, or Chaffey.
In order to better inform our readers of the
positions and platforms of candidates in this
week's ASSU presidential election, the Daily
has invited all slates to respond to a series of
four questions. Today, the candidates'
answers to questions on ASSU finances and
education.
Money
Today's number one query: Concerning
ASSU funding, do you favor or oppose the
passage of an ASSU program fee? What is
your position on the ASSU's annual $92,000
budget, derived from the University's general
fund?
(Judy Gans and Buzz Thompson reply:)
We oppose the passage of the Program Fee
for two reasons. First, the fee would not be
truly voluntary, although it would be
refundable. Unless the Voluntary Fee
Amendment also on the ballot is passed, the
Program Fee will remain a mechanism by
which students are taxed for "services" they
neither want nor need.
Second, we believe that student
organizations should be supported on an
individual basis, according to their value to
each student. If an organiation is not able to
sustain itself through voluntary means, it
certainly has no business being supported
by involuntary means
We have examined the record of the
$92,000 ASSU budget for this year, and have
found an appalling amount of money that has
been spent wastefully by anyone's standards.
With other University departments crying for
funds, we find it at least peculiar that such an
expensive plaything as the ASSU is permitted
to exist at all.
We favor a student government financed
directly by those students who wish to
participate in it. The funding for such an
operation would not be rechanneled through
the University hierarchy in a fixed amount,
but would vary from quarter to quarter
depending on the support given by the
students. This way, if the ASSU really could
provide "student services"—which we
doubt—those who desired these services could
pay in as much as they wanted without
imposing on the wishes of others.

that the University would have to provide the
services now provided by the ASSU.
(Peter Van Petten, Jim Anderson, Tom Flohr,
and Charles "Buck" Schott reply;)
We find ourselves deadlocked on the
question of an endorsement for the ASSU
program fee. Half the slate believes that no
recommendation can be made; half that we
should endorse it, albeit half-heartedly.
Some allocations in the program fee
support broad-based student interests such as
the ASSU Course Review.
On the other hand, many allocations are
made to small special interests who have little
claim on the students' money.
We cannot conscientiously endorse the
program fee, however, the effect it will have
on limiting special fee assessments and the
money it provides some deserving student
organiztions indicates a vote for the program
fee as the least objectionable alternative.
Most of the $92,000 ASSU budget is used
to provide banking services for student
organizations (dorms, frats, clubs, etc.)
Without ASSU the University would be forced
to do so at a far greater cost, for it would be
forced to hire professional employees to
replace the low-cost student now working at
ASSU. It is the duty of ASSU officers
to justify budget expenses by channeling their
energies in ways which can bring beneficial
changes within the University.
Education
The final question: The first business of
Stanford students, although one might not
know it from observing the ASSU, is
education. What do you see as your role in
educational policy-making? Are you
proposing any specific educational reforms or
innovations?
(Judy Gans and Buzz Thompson reply:)
We believe that educational innovation can
take place regardless of whether or not an
ASSU structure exists, provided the ideas are
sound in the first place. There need not be an
ASSU in order to have a Course Review, for
example.
It would be inconsistent for us to claim
that compulsory student government is
acceptable for educational matters, and
unacceptable for anything else. Since
"educational reform" at present encompasses
undergraduates almost exclusively, nearly half
the student body has been effectively
disenfranchised under the present mandatory
system.
As representatives of both undergraduate
and graduate levels, we do maintain an
interest in educational innovation on an equal
basis. In particular, we would like to see the
following ideas studied further:
1. The "Internal Voucher" system, by
which students may designate part of their
tuition money toward hiring professors from
other universities.
2. The "Challenge Credit" system, by
which students may receive credit for a course
merely by passing a final examination,
without actually taking the course.
To repeat, the existence of a compulsary
ASSU is in no way a prerequisite for
educational change at Stanford.
(Kevin O'Grady, Beth Garfield, Charles
Ogletree, and Jim Friend reply:)
Stanford's commitment to quality
undergraduate education is one of our
primary concerns. We realize that the ASSU is
limited in its ability to effect educational
policy-making. At the same time we feel that
there are a number of specific proposals which
the ASSU can quite realistically sponsor that
will improve the Stanford educational
experience.
One very concrete improvement would be
the distribution of lecture outlines by
professors in large lecture classes. Several

years ago, medical students succeeded in
making this a policy at the Medical School.
There is no reason why undergraduates could
not achieve the same result.
We propose a student produced volume
called the "Student Guide to Stanford
Education." The "Guide" would include the
present course review as well as listings of
faculty research projects in which students
could get involved, listings of professors with
special expertise who are willing to sponsor
independent work, and suggestions about
ways in which students can work to improve
curriculum through undergraduate
associations.
We also propose that a
"Guest-In-Residence" program be established
within the residence system. Several years ago
there was such a program in Wilbur that
brought prominent people to campus such as
Erich Fromm, Frank Church and William
Sloan Coffin, to talk and interact with
students.
We feel that it is important to defend the
autonomy of SWOPSI and SCIRE, the two
programs most responsible for providing
innovative education at Stanford. We would
also work for the creation of new programs in
women's and Jewish studies.
(Peter Van Petten, Jim Anderson, Tom Flohr,
and Charles "Buck" Schott reply:)
We recognize that the role the ASSU can
play in educational policy-making is limited.
However, as ASSU Presidents we will wo rk for
the following changes.
First, we favor the elimination of the
University undergraduate distribution
requirements. They are a demonstrated failure
and serve only to make students search for
easy science or humanities courses they wo uld
not have otherwise taken.
Second, we will work for a six-year BS-MD
program similar to those existing at
Northwestern, Boston University and Johns
Hopkins as an alternative to the current grind
that now faces the Stanford pre-med.
Third, we feel students should be able to
take tests for credit. If a student can
demonstrate sufficient knowledge in a course
area and pass an exam, he should be exempt
from the course requirement and obtain
credit.
Finally, with the ASSU we will establish a
central test file, containing old finals and
midterms from as many classes as possible.
(Fred Choate and Ed Ryu reply:)
Because the government is now forced to
take on and seek to destroy the strength of
the working class, the trade unions, in order
to drive down and smash the standard of
living won by the American working class,
higher education is of no use to the capitalist
system, except as a breeding ground for racist
and fascist ideology, and a center for
counterrevolutionary research, as at the
Hoover Institution.
This is the significance of Shockley, who
now emerges with the open support of the
Stanford administration and fhe financial
backing of powerful business interests, to play
the role played by right-wing ideologues in the
universities of Germany in the 19305.
The Young Socialists understand that the
defense of the right to higher education is a
revolutionary demand. Therefore it can only
be defended by turning to the labor
movement and building the alternative
revolutionary leadership in the unions through
the fight for a labor party and a workers
government pledged to socialist policies.
The Young Socialists demand:
—No cuts in work-study, loans, or
scholarships.
—No hikes in tuition, room, or board.
—No layoffs of professors or staff.
—Free higher education for all.
No answer to the question on finances was
received from candidates Choate and Ryu. No
statements were received from candidates
Meyer, Garcia, or Chaffey.
In order to better inform our readers of the
positions and platforms of candidates in this
week's ASSU presidential election, the Daily
has invited all slates to respond to a series of
four questions. Today, the candidates'
answers to questions on ASSU finances and
education.
Money
Today's number one query: Concerning
ASSU funding, do you favor or oppose the
passage of an ASSU program fee? What is
your position on the ASSU's annual $92,000
budget, derived from the University's general
fund?
(Judy Gans and Buzz Thompson reply:)
We oppose the passage of the Program Fee
for two reasons. First, the fee would not be
truly voluntary, although it would be
refundable. Unless the Voluntary Fee
Amendment also on the ballot is passed, the
Program Fee will remain a mechanism by
which students are taxed for "services" they
neither want nor need.
Second, we believe that student
organizations should be supported on an
individual basis, according to their value to
each student. If an organiation is not able to
sustain itself through voluntary means, it
certainly has no business being supported
by involuntary means
We have examined the record of the
$92,000 ASSU budget for this year, and have
found an appalling amount of money that has
been spent wastefully by anyone's standards.
With other University departments crying for
funds, we find it at least peculiar that such an
expensive plaything as the ASSU is permitted
to exist at all.
We favor a student government financed
directly by those students who wish to
participate in it. The funding for such an
operation would not be rechanneled through
the University hierarchy in a fixed amount,
but would vary from quarter to quarter
depending on the support given by the
students. This way, if the ASSU really could
provide "student services"—which we
doubt—those who desired these services could
pay in as much as they wanted without
imposing on the wishes of others.
(Kevin O'Grady, Beth Garfield, Charles
Ogletree. and Jim Friend reply:)
We support the passage of an ASSU
program fee. This fee gives smaller student
organizations and projects which cannot gain
funding elsewhere a chance to survive.
The program fee which appears on the
ballot is the result of a careful investigation by
the Senate Finance Committee to determine
that all program fee requests are in line with
actual needs and that the funds will be used
for worthwhile ends. Approximately
two-thirds of the student body participates in
one or more of the over two hundred student
organizations, all of which are given an equal
chance to submit program fee requests. Since
the fee is refundable, any student who
conscientiously feels that he will receive no
benefit from any of the student organizations
or programs can get his dollar back.
The campaign rhetoric of several
candidates has been misleading as to the
actual uses of the $92,000 the ASSU receives
from the University. This money constitutes
the operating budget and is not intended for
the direct support of programs or
organizations.
The vast bulk of the $92,000 is used to pay
for office personnel and supplies needed to
provide financial services to the Student
Organization Fund accounts. These accounts
include all residences, clubs, and special
projects such as the Travel Service, Special
Events, and Sunday Flicks.
Because the University's tax status requires
that these accounts remain on campus, the
ASSU operations represent an accessible
student-run alternative to the more
cumbersome university accounting system.

Unless all ASSU services and student
organizations are to be abolished, elimination
of the operating budget would simply mean
that the University would have to provide the
services now provided by the ASSU.

ASSU in order to have a Course Review, for
example.
It would be inconsistent for us to claim
that compulsory student government is
acceptable for educational matters, and
unacceptable for anything else. Since
"educational reform" at present encompasses
undergraduates almost exclusively, nearly half
the student body has been effectively
disenfranchised under the present mandatory
system.
As representatives of both undergraduate
and graduate levels, we do maintain an
interest in educational innovation on an equal
basis. In particular, we would like to see the
following ideas studied further:
1. The "Internal Voucher" system, by
which students may designate part of their
tuition money toward hiring professors from
other universities.
2. The "Challenge Credit" system, by
which students may receive credit for a course
merely by passing a final examination,
without actually taking the course.
To repeat, the existence of a compulsary
ASSU is in no way a prerequisite for
educational change at Stanford.
(Kevin O'Grady, Beth Garfield, Charles
Ogletree, and Jim Friend reply:)
Stanford's commitment to quality
undergraduate education is one of our
primary concerns. We realize that the ASSU is
limited in its ability to effect educational
policy-making. At the same time we feel that
there are a number of specific proposals which
the ASSU can quite realistically sponsor that
will improve the Stanford educational
experience.
One very concrete improvement would be
the distribution of lecture outlines by
professors in large lecture classes. Several

years ago, medical students succeeded in
making this a policy at the Medical School.
There is no reason why undergraduates could
not achieve the same result.
We propose a student produced volume
called the "Student Guide to Stanford
Education." The "Guide" would include the
present course review as well as listings of
faculty research projects in which students
could get involved, listings of professors with
special expertise who are willing to sponsor
independent work, and suggestions about
ways in which students can work to improve
curriculum through undergraduate
associations.
We also propose that a
"Guest-In-Residence" program be established
within the residence system. Several years ago
there was such a program in Wilbur that
brought prominent people to campus such as
Erich Fromm, Frank Church and William
Sloan Coffin, to talk and interact with
students.
We feel that it is important to defend the
autonomy of SWOPSI and SCIRE, the two
programs most responsible for providing
innovative education at Stanford. We would
also work for the creation of new programs in
women's and Jewish studies.
(Peter Van Petten, Jim Anderson, Tom Flohr,
and Charles "Buck" Schott reply:)
We recognize that the role the ASSU can
play in educational policy-making is limited.
However, as ASSU Presidents we will wo rk for
the following changes.
First, we favor the elimination of the
University undergraduate distribution
requirements. They are a demonstrated failure
and serve only to make students search for
easy science or humanities courses they wo uld
not have otherwise taken.
Second, we will work for a six-year BS-MD
program similar to those existing at
Northwestern, Boston University and Johns
Hopkins as an alternative to the current grind
that now faces the Stanford pre-med.
Third, we feel students should be able to
take tests for credit. If a student can
demonstrate sufficient knowledge in a course
area and pass an exam, he should be exempt
from the course requirement and obtain
credit.
Finally, with the ASSU we will establish a
central test file, containing old finals and
midterms from as many classes as possible.
(Fred Choate and Ed Ryu reply:)
Because the government is now forced to
take on and seek to destroy the strength of
the working class, the trade unions, in order
to drive down and smash the standard of
living won by the American working class,
higher education is of no use to the capitalist
system, except as a breeding ground for racist
and fascist ideology, and a center for
counterrevolutionary research, as at the
Hoover Institution.
This is the significance of Shockley, who
now emerges with the open support of the
Stanford administration and fhe financial
backing of powerful business interests, to play
the role played by right-wing ideologues in the
universities of Germany in the 19305.
The Young Socialists understand that the
defense of the right to higher education is a
revolutionary demand. Therefore it can only
be defended by turning to the labor
movement and building the alternative
revolutionary leadership in the unions through
the fight for a labor party and a workers
government pledged to socialist policies.
The Young Socialists demand:
—No cuts in work-study, loans, or
scholarships.
—No hikes in tuition, room, or board.
—No layoffs of professors or staff.
—Free higher education for all.
No answer to the question on finances was
received from candidates Choate and Ryu. No
statements were received from candidates
Meyer, Garcia, or Chaffey.
In order to better inform our readers of the
positions and platforms of candidates in this
week's ASSU presidential election, the Daily
has invited all slates to respond to a series of
four questions. Today, the candidates'
answers to questions on ASSU finances and
education.
Money
Today's number one query: Concerning
ASSU funding, do you favor or oppose the
passage of an ASSU program fee? What is
your position on the ASSU's annual $92,000
budget, derived from the University's general
fund?
(Judy Gans and Buzz Thompson reply:)
We oppose the passage of the Program Fee
for two reasons. First, the fee would not be
truly voluntary, although it would be
refundable. Unless the Voluntary Fee
Amendment also on the ballot is passed, the
Program Fee will remain a mechanism by
which students are taxed for "services" they
neither want nor need.
Second, we believe that student
organizations should be supported on an
individual basis, according to their value to
each student. If an organiation is not able to
sustain itself through voluntary means, it
certainly has no business being supported
by involuntary means
We have examined the record of the
$92,000 ASSU budget for this year, and have
found an appalling amount of money that has
been spent wastefully by anyone's standards.
With other University departments crying for
funds, we find it at least peculiar that such an
expensive plaything as the ASSU is permitted
to exist at all.
We favor a student government financed
directly by those students who wish to
participate in it. The funding for such an
operation would not be rechanneled through
the University hierarchy in a fixed amount,
but would vary from quarter to quarter
depending on the support given by the
students. This way, if the ASSU really could
provide "student services"—which we
doubt—those who desired these services could
pay in as much as they wanted without
imposing on the wishes of others.
(Kevin O'Grady, Beth Garfield, Charles
Ogletree. and Jim Friend reply:)
We support the passage of an ASSU
program fee. This fee gives smaller student
organizations and projects which cannot gain
funding elsewhere a chance to survive.
The program fee which appears on the
ballot is the result of a careful investigation by
the Senate Finance Committee to determine
that all program fee requests are in line with
actual needs and that the funds will be used
for worthwhile ends. Approximately
two-thirds of the student body participates in
one or more of the over two hundred student
organizations, all of which are given an equal
chance to submit program fee requests. Since
the fee is refundable, any student who
conscientiously feels that he will receive no
benefit from any of the student organizations
or programs can get his dollar back.
The campaign rhetoric of several
candidates has been misleading as to the
actual uses of the $92,000 the ASSU receives
from the University. This money constitutes
the operating budget and is not intended for
the direct support of programs or
organizations.
The vast bulk of the $92,000 is used to pay
for office personnel and supplies needed to
provide financial services to the Student
Organization Fund accounts. These accounts
include all residences, clubs, and special
projects such as the Travel Service, Special
Events, and Sunday Flicks.
Because the University's tax status requires
that these accounts remain on campus, the
ASSU operations represent an accessible
student-run alternative to the more
cumbersome university accounting system.

Unless all ASSU services and student
organizations are to be abolished, elimination
of the operating budget would simply mean
that the University would have to provide the
services now provided by the ASSU.
(Peter Van Petten, Jim Anderson, Tom Flohr,
and Charles "Buck" Schott reply;)
We find ourselves deadlocked on the
question of an endorsement for the ASSU
program fee. Half the slate believes that no
recommendation can be made; half that we
should endorse it, albeit half-heartedly.
Some allocations in the program fee
support broad-based student interests such as
the ASSU Course Review.
On the other hand, many allocations are
made to small special interests who have little
claim on the students' money.
We cannot conscientiously endorse the
program fee, however, the effect it will have
on limiting special fee assessments and the
money it provides some deserving student
organiztions indicates a vote for the program
fee as the least objectionable alternative.
Most of the $92,000 ASSU budget is used
to provide banking services for student
organizations (dorms, frats, clubs, etc.)
Without ASSU the University would be forced
to do so at a far greater cost, for it would be
forced to hire professional employees to
replace the low-cost student now working at
ASSU. It is the duty of ASSU officers
to justify budget expenses by channeling their
energies in ways which can bring beneficial
changes within the University.
Education
The final question: The first business of
Stanford students, although one might not
know it from observing the ASSU, is
education. What do you see as your role in
educational policy-making? Are you
proposing any specific educational reforms or
innovations?
(Judy Gans and Buzz Thompson reply:)
We believe that educational innovation can
take place regardless of whether or not an
ASSU structure exists, provided the ideas are
sound in the first place. There need not be an
ASSU in order to have a Course Review, for
example.
It would be inconsistent for us to claim
that compulsory student government is

faculty research projects in which students
could get involved, listings of professors with
special expertise who are willing to sponsor
independent work, and suggestions about
ways in which students can work to improve
curriculum through undergraduate
associations.
We also propose that a
"Guest-In-Residence" program be established
within the residence system. Several years ago
there was such a program in Wilbur that
brought prominent people to campus such as
Erich Fromm, Frank Church and William
Sloan Coffin, to talk and interact with
students.
We feel that it is important to defend the
autonomy of SWOPSI and SCIRE, the two
programs most responsible for providing
innovative education at Stanford. We would
also work for the creation of new programs in
women's and Jewish studies.
(Peter Van Petten, Jim Anderson, Tom Flohr,
and Charles "Buck" Schott reply:)
We recognize that the role the ASSU can
play in educational policy-making is limited.
However, as ASSU Presidents we will wo rk for
the following changes.
First, we favor the elimination of the
University undergraduate distribution
requirements. They are a demonstrated failure
and serve only to make students search for
easy science or humanities courses they wo uld
not have otherwise taken.
Second, we will work for a six-year BS-MD
program similar to those existing at
Northwestern, Boston University and Johns
Hopkins as an alternative to the current grind
that now faces the Stanford pre-med.
Third, we feel students should be able to
take tests for credit. If a student can
demonstrate sufficient knowledge in a course
area and pass an exam, he should be exempt
from the course requirement and obtain
credit.
Finally, with the ASSU we will establish a
central test file, containing old finals and
midterms from as many classes as possible.
(Fred Choate and Ed Ryu reply:)
Because the government is now forced to
take on and seek to destroy the strength of
the working class, the trade unions, in order
to drive down and smash the standard of
living won by the American working class,
higher education is of no use to the capitalist
system, except as a breeding ground for racist
and fascist ideology, and a center for
counterrevolutionary research, as at the
Hoover Institution.
This is the significance of Shockley, who
now emerges with the open support of the
Stanford administration and fhe financial
backing of powerful business interests, to play
the role played by right-wing ideologues in the
universities of Germany in the 19305.
The Young Socialists understand that the
defense of the right to higher education is a
revolutionary demand. Therefore it can only
be defended by turning to the labor
movement and building the alternative
revolutionary leadership in the unions through
the fight for a labor party and a workers
government pledged to socialist policies.
The Young Socialists demand:
—No cuts in work-study, loans, or
scholarships.
—No hikes in tuition, room, or board.
—No layoffs of professors or staff.
—Free higher education for all.

In order to better inform our readers of the
positions and platforms of candidates in this
week's ASSU presidential election, the Daily
has invited all slates to respond to a series of
four questions. Today, the candidates'
answers to questions on ASSU finances and
education.
Money
Today's number one query: Concerning
ASSU funding, do you favor or oppose the
passage of an ASSU program fee? What is
your position on the ASSU's annual $92,000
budget, derived from the University's general
fund?
(Judy Gans and Buzz Thompson reply:)
We oppose the passage of the Program Fee
for two reasons. First, the fee would not be
truly voluntary, although it would be
refundable. Unless the Voluntary Fee
Amendment also on the ballot is passed, the
Program Fee will remain a mechanism by
which students are taxed for "services" they
neither want nor need.
Second, we believe that student
organizations should be supported on an
individual basis, according to their value to
each student. If an organiation is not able to
sustain itself through voluntary means, it
certainly has no business being supported
by involuntary means
We have examined the record of the
$92,000 ASSU budget for this year, and have
found an appalling amount of money that has
been spent wastefully by anyone's standards.
With other University departments crying for
funds, we find it at least peculiar that such an
expensive plaything as the ASSU is permitted
to exist at all.
We favor a student government financed
directly by those students who wish to
participate in it. The funding for such an
operation would not be rechanneled through
the University hierarchy in a fixed amount,
but would vary from quarter to quarter
depending on the support given by the
students. This way, if the ASSU really could
provide "student services"—which we
doubt—those who desired these services could
pay in as much as they wanted without
imposing on the wishes of others.
(Kevin O'Grady, Beth Garfield, Charles
Ogletree. and Jim Friend reply:)
We support the passage of an ASSU
program fee. This fee gives smaller student
organizations and projects which cannot gain
funding elsewhere a chance to survive.
The program fee which appears on the
ballot is the result of a careful investigation by
the Senate Finance Committee to determine
that all program fee requests are in line with
actual needs and that the funds will be used
for worthwhile ends. Approximately
two-thirds of the student body participates in
one or more of the over two hundred student
organizations, all of which are given an equal
chance to submit program fee requests. Since
the fee is refundable, any student who
conscientiously feels that he will receive no
benefit from any of the student organizations
or programs can get his dollar back.
The campaign rhetoric of several
candidates has been misleading as to the
actual uses of the $92,000 the ASSU receives
from the University. This money constitutes
the operating budget and is not intended for
the direct support of programs or
organizations.
The vast bulk of the $92,000 is used to pay
for office personnel and supplies needed to
provide financial services to the Student
Organization Fund accounts. These accounts
include all residences, clubs, and special
projects such as the Travel Service, Special
Events, and Sunday Flicks.
Because the University's tax status requires
that these accounts remain on campus, the
ASSU operations represent an accessible
student-run alternative to the more
cumbersome university accounting system.

Unless all ASSU services and student
organizations are to be abolished, elimination
of the operating budget would simply mean
that the University would have to provide the
services now provided by the ASSU.
(Peter Van Petten, Jim Anderson, Tom Flohr,
and Charles "Buck" Schott reply;)
We find ourselves deadlocked on the
question of an endorsement for the ASSU
program fee. Half the slate believes that no
recommendation can be made; half that we
should endorse it, albeit half-heartedly.
Some allocations in the program fee
support broad-based student interests such as
the ASSU Course Review.
On the other hand, many allocations are
made to small special interests who have little
claim on the students' money.
We cannot conscientiously endorse the
program fee, however, the effect it will have
on limiting special fee assessments and the
money it provides some deserving student
organiztions indicates a vote for the program
fee as the least objectionable alternative.
Most of the $92,000 ASSU budget is used
to provide banking services for student
organizations (dorms, frats, clubs, etc.)
Without ASSU the University would be forced
to do so at a far greater cost, for it would be
forced to hire professional employees to
replace the low-cost student now working at
ASSU. It is the duty of ASSU officers
to justify budget expenses by channeling their
energies in ways which can bring beneficial
changes within the University.
Education
The final question: The first business of
Stanford students, although one might not
know it from observing the ASSU, is
education. What do you see as your role in
educational policy-making? Are you
proposing any specific educational reforms or
innovations?
(Judy Gans and Buzz Thompson reply:)
We believe that educational innovation can
take place regardless of whether or not an
ASSU structure exists, provided the ideas are
sound in the first place. There need not be an
ASSU in order to have a Course Review, for
example.
It would be inconsistent for us to claim
that compulsory student government is
acceptable for educational matters, and
unacceptable for anything else. Since
"educational reform" at present encompasses
undergraduates almost exclusively, nearly half
the student body has been effectively
disenfranchised under the present mandatory
system.
As representatives of both undergraduate
and graduate levels, we do maintain an
interest in educational innovation on an equal
basis. In particular, we would like to see the
following ideas studied further:
1. The "Internal Voucher" system, by
which students may designate part of their
tuition money toward hiring professors from
other universities.
2. The "Challenge Credit" system, by
which students may receive credit for a course
merely by passing a final examination,
without actually taking the course.
To repeat, the existence of a compulsary
ASSU is in no way a prerequisite for
educational change at Stanford.
(Kevin O'Grady, Beth Garfield, Charles
Ogletree, and Jim Friend reply:)
Stanford's commitment to quality
undergraduate education is one of our
primary concerns. We realize that the ASSU is
limited in its ability to effect educational
policy-making. At the same time we feel that
there are a number of specific proposals which
the ASSU can quite realistically sponsor that
will improve the Stanford educational
experience.
One very concrete improvement would be
the distribution of lecture outlines by
professors in large lecture classes. Several

years ago, medical students succeeded in
making this a policy at the Medical School.
There is no reason why undergraduates could
not achieve the same result.
We propose a student produced volume
called the "Student Guide to Stanford
Education." The "Guide" would include the
present course review as well as listings of
faculty research projects in which students
could get involved, listings of professors with
special expertise who are willing to sponsor
independent work, and suggestions about
ways in which students can work to improve
curriculum through undergraduate
associations.
We also propose that a
"Guest-In-Residence" program be established
within the residence system. Several years ago
there was such a program in Wilbur that
brought prominent people to campus such as
Erich Fromm, Frank Church and William
Sloan Coffin, to talk and interact with
students.

also work for the creation of new programs in
women's and Jewish studies.
