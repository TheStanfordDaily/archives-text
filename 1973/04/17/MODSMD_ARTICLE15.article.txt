# Endorsements: ASSU Council Splits
## 
### 
Appel: For O'Grady
Editor:
I am writing this letter to
endorse the slate of O'Grady,
Garfield, Ogletree, and Friend for
the ASSU Council of Presidents.
Their platform may be overly
ambitious, but Kevin, Beth,
Charles, and Jim have the
competence necessary to make
significant progress. I have worked
with these people, and am
convinced that they have more
collective energy than any other
slate. This is important, for the
ASSU does not need internal
reforms as much as it does
energetic people to make it work.
Their energy will be needed on
two projects about which I am
particularly concerned and have
worked hard on: continuation of
the ASSU Course Review and
implementation of the
recommendations of the
forthcoming Student Task Force
on Education report, soon to be
released.
This ticket is more unified than
the ASSU Council of Presidents in
the past. As pundits of ASSU
politics are well aware, the current
Council has been split. The central
issue, as I see it, has been whether
or not to carry through on our
generally progressive platform.
To my knowledge, my
colleague Pete Van Petten has
worked marginally in only one of
the eight areas outlined in our
platform of last year. This record
prevents me from supporting his
candidacy. Furthermore, I am
distressed by what appears to be
last minute desperation attempts
to discredit members of other
slates and by the negativism of
their campaign.
The ASSU has tremendous
limitations. Yet, I believe that
O'Grady, Garfield, Ogletree, and
Friend offer the best chance in
this election of making the ASSU
more viable than it is at present.
They have my firm support.
Brent Appel
ASSU Co-President
Burke: For Van Petten
Editor:
As the president of the student
body, I feel that it is my duty to
take a stand in the ASSU
presidential election battle.
There are only two serious
slates seeking office — one that is
led by Peter Van Petten, the other
led by Kevin O'Grady.
The election of the
O'Grady-Garfield-Ogletree-Friend
slate would be a disaster for the
students of Stanford University.
The campaign which they have
conducted has consisted almost
entirely of intentional distortions
and smears, combined with a host
of proposals nearly every one of
which has been tried before and
failed, evaluated and deemed
impractical, or is currently in
existence.
One member of their slate,
Charles Ogletree, has a record
which clearly demonstrates a lack
of responsibility and an
insensitivity to ethics. He has

intentionally misrepresented my
record in office. He has made
questionable use of student funds
and abused his position as editor
of the Real News by republishing
his campaign literature in that
newspaper, a publication
supported by approximately
$2,000 in fees assessed on the
general student body. I am
convinced that such an individual
cannot safely be trusted with
authority.
The three other members of
the O'Grady slate know little or
nothing about the University.
Their proposal that a pub be
located in a building which was
totally demolished last Saturday is
characteristic of the quality of
their suggestions. Their interest in
University affairs is but a few
weeks old, their stated concern
for student services an obvious
attempt to conceal their political
orientation and their devotion to
special interests. The racial and
sexual balance of their ticket is a
cynical and blatant attempt to
win votes, and deserves to be
rejected.
The Van Petten-Anderson-
Flohr-Schott slate promises to
devote their energy to those areas
where ASSU officers can have
some effect — improving the lives
of Stanford students. They have
proven their committment to
beneficial change at the University
by working in every area of
importance to students, while
their opponents were doing
absolutely nothing for Stanford
students.
An examination of the record
of the incumbent Council of
Presidents will establish quite
clearly which approach brings
results. Peter Van Petten and I
have channelled our energy into
areas where there was some
prospect of achieving something
concrete for the students. We
totally reorganized the student
senate and kept it out of outside
politics; made all fee assessments
refundable; established a speakers
program on campus; substantially
boosted the number of women
and minorities on University
committees; helped to organize
the finest concert program in the
history of the University; helped
the Stanford Daily to attain
independence; led the opposition
to a repressive student judicial
system and then healed the
division with the faculty and

administration on that issue;
worked to defeat the Citizens
Advocates rip-off and proposed
the Stanford Legal Counseling
Office in its place. Those on
present and past Councils of
Presidents with a more political
orientation have yet to
accomplish anything of substance
at Stanford.
The choice in this election is
between action and rhetoric.
Students must reject the O'Grady
slate and its political orientation,
its dirty campaign tactics, and its
past record of questionable
conduct. Only the Van Petten
slate will work for change within
the University and has proven its
committment to student interests,
not special interests.
Scott Burke
ASSU Co-President
Wong: For O'Grady
Editor:
A year on the ASSU Council of
Presidents can bring one into
closer contact with run-of-the-mill
student politicians than one
would ever wish for. But if
nothing else, one can clearly
discern what abilities and
sensitivities are necessary to
effectively work for student
interests with a demeanor that
faculty, administrators, and others
can respect. For these reasons, I
am surprised that my
co-president, Peter Van Petten,
has decided to run again.
One does learn to appreciate
that rare talent for getting things
done that probably best
characterizes the slate of
O'Grady-Garfield-Ogletree-Friend.
Their desire to respond to the
needs of the widest possible
cross-section of Stanford students,
their particular interests in
education and student services,
and their integrity and energy are
laudable.
Sometimes I think that
self-serving student politicians are
the worst of the lot. I am tired of
their inflated egos, their delusions
of personal power and influence,
and their spitefulness. On election
day, I will vote for a council that
I, too, can respect — Kevin
O'Grady, Beth Garfield, Charles
Ogletree, and Jim Friend.

done that probably best
characterizes the slate of
O'Grady-Garfield-Ogletree-Friend.
Their desire to respond to the
needs of the widest possible
cross-section of Stanford students,
their particular interests in
education and student services,
and their integrity and energy are
laudable.
Sometimes I think that
self-serving student politicians are
the worst of the lot. I am tired of
their inflated egos, their delusions
of personal power and influence,
and their spitefulness. On election
day, I will vote for a council that
I, too, can respect — Kevin
O'Grady, Beth Garfield, Charles
Ogletree, and Jim Friend.
Elaine Wong
ASSU Co-President
Appel: For O'Grady
Editor:
I am writing this letter to
endorse the slate of O'Grady,
Garfield, Ogletree, and Friend for
the ASSU Council of Presidents.
Their platform may be overly
ambitious, but Kevin, Beth,
Charles, and Jim have the
competence necessary to make
significant progress. I have worked
with these people, and am
convinced that they have more
collective energy than any other
slate. This is important, for the
ASSU does not need internal
reforms as much as it does
energetic people to make it work.
Their energy will be needed on
two projects about which I am
particularly concerned and have
worked hard on: continuation of
the ASSU Course Review and
implementation of the
recommendations of the
forthcoming Student Task Force
on Education report, soon to be
released.
This ticket is more unified than
the ASSU Council of Presidents in
the past. As pundits of ASSU
politics are well aware, the current
Council has been split. The central
issue, as I see it, has been whether
or not to carry through on our
generally progressive platform.
To my knowledge, my
colleague Pete Van Petten has
worked marginally in only one of
the eight areas outlined in our
platform of last year. This record
prevents me from supporting his
candidacy. Furthermore, I am
distressed by what appears to be
last minute desperation attempts
to discredit members of other
slates and by the negativism of
their campaign.
The ASSU has tremendous
limitations. Yet, I believe that
O'Grady, Garfield, Ogletree, and
Friend offer the best chance in
this election of making the ASSU
more viable than it is at present.
They have my firm support.
Brent Appel
ASSU Co-President
Burke: For Van Petten
Editor:
As the president of the student
body, I feel that it is my duty to
take a stand in the ASSU
presidential election battle.
There are only two serious
slates seeking office — one that is
led by Peter Van Petten, the other
led by Kevin O'Grady.
The election of the
O'Grady-Garfield-Ogletree-Friend
slate would be a disaster for the
students of Stanford University.
The campaign which they have
conducted has consisted almost
entirely of intentional distortions
and smears, combined with a host
of proposals nearly every one of
which has been tried before and
failed, evaluated and deemed
impractical, or is currently in
existence.
One member of their slate,
Charles Ogletree, has a record
which clearly demonstrates a lack
of responsibility and an
insensitivity to ethics. He has

intentionally misrepresented my
record in office. He has made
questionable use of student funds
and abused his position as editor
of the Real News by republishing
his campaign literature in that
newspaper, a publication
supported by approximately
$2,000 in fees assessed on the
general student body. I am
convinced that such an individual
cannot safely be trusted with
authority.
The three other members of
the O'Grady slate know little or
nothing about the University.
Their proposal that a pub be
located in a building which was
totally demolished last Saturday is
characteristic of the quality of
their suggestions. Their interest in
University affairs is but a few
weeks old, their stated concern
for student services an obvious
attempt to conceal their political
orientation and their devotion to
special interests. The racial and
sexual balance of their ticket is a
cynical and blatant attempt to
win votes, and deserves to be
rejected.
The Van Petten-Anderson-
Flohr-Schott slate promises to
devote their energy to those areas
where ASSU officers can have
some effect — improving the lives
of Stanford students. They have
proven their committment to
beneficial change at the University
by working in every area of
importance to students, while
their opponents were doing
absolutely nothing for Stanford
students.
An examination of the record
of the incumbent Council of
Presidents will establish quite
clearly which approach brings
results. Peter Van Petten and I
have channelled our energy into
areas where there was some
prospect of achieving something
concrete for the students. We
totally reorganized the student
senate and kept it out of outside
politics; made all fee assessments
refundable; established a speakers
program on campus; substantially
boosted the number of women
and minorities on University
committees; helped to organize
the finest concert program in the
history of the University; helped
the Stanford Daily to attain
independence; led the opposition
to a repressive student judicial
system and then healed the
division with the faculty and

administration on that issue;
worked to defeat the Citizens
Advocates rip-off and proposed
the Stanford Legal Counseling
Office in its place. Those on
present and past Councils of
Presidents with a more political
orientation have yet to
accomplish anything of substance
at Stanford.
The choice in this election is
between action and rhetoric.
Students must reject the O'Grady
slate and its political orientation,
its dirty campaign tactics, and its
past record of questionable
conduct. Only the Van Petten
slate will work for change within
the University and has proven its
committment to student interests,
not special interests.
Scott Burke
ASSU Co-President
Wong: For O'Grady
Editor:
A year on the ASSU Council of
Presidents can bring one into
closer contact with run-of-the-mill
student politicians than one
would ever wish for. But if
nothing else, one can clearly
discern what abilities and
sensitivities are necessary to
effectively work for student
interests with a demeanor that
faculty, administrators, and others
can respect. For these reasons, I
am surprised that my
co-president, Peter Van Petten,
has decided to run again.

Wong: For O'Grady
Editor:
A year on the ASSU Council of
Presidents can bring one into
closer contact with run-of-the-mill
student politicians than one
would ever wish for. But if
nothing else, one can clearly
discern what abilities and
sensitivities are necessary to
effectively work for student
interests with a demeanor that
faculty, administrators, and others
can respect. For these reasons, I
am surprised that my
co-president, Peter Van Petten,
has decided to run again.
One does learn to appreciate
that rare talent for getting things
done that probably best
characterizes the slate of
O'Grady-Garfield-Ogletree-Friend.
Their desire to respond to the
needs of the widest possible
cross-section of Stanford students,
their particular interests in
education and student services,
and their integrity and energy are
laudable.
Sometimes I think that
self-serving student politicians are
the worst of the lot. I am tired of
their inflated egos, their delusions
of personal power and influence,
and their spitefulness. On election
day, I will vote for a council that
I, too, can respect — Kevin
O'Grady, Beth Garfield, Charles
Ogletree, and Jim Friend.
Elaine Wong
ASSU Co-President
Appel: For O'Grady
Editor:
I am writing this letter to
endorse the slate of O'Grady,
Garfield, Ogletree, and Friend for
the ASSU Council of Presidents.
Their platform may be overly
ambitious, but Kevin, Beth,
Charles, and Jim have the
competence necessary to make
significant progress. I have worked
with these people, and am
convinced that they have more
collective energy than any other
slate. This is important, for the
ASSU does not need internal
reforms as much as it does
energetic people to make it work.
Their energy will be needed on
two projects about which I am
particularly concerned and have
worked hard on: continuation of
the ASSU Course Review and
implementation of the
recommendations of the
forthcoming Student Task Force
on Education report, soon to be
released.
This ticket is more unified than
the ASSU Council of Presidents in
the past. As pundits of ASSU
politics are well aware, the current
Council has been split. The central
issue, as I see it, has been whether
or not to carry through on our
generally progressive platform.
To my knowledge, my
colleague Pete Van Petten has
worked marginally in only one of
the eight areas outlined in our
platform of last year. This record
prevents me from supporting his
candidacy. Furthermore, I am
distressed by what appears to be
last minute desperation attempts
to discredit members of other
slates and by the negativism of
their campaign.
The ASSU has tremendous
limitations. Yet, I believe that
O'Grady, Garfield, Ogletree, and
Friend offer the best chance in
this election of making the ASSU
more viable than it is at present.
They have my firm support.
Brent Appel
ASSU Co-President
Burke: For Van Petten
Editor:
As the president of the student
body, I feel that it is my duty to
take a stand in the ASSU
presidential election battle.
There are only two serious
slates seeking office — one that is
led by Peter Van Petten, the other
led by Kevin O'Grady.
The election of the
O'Grady-Garfield-Ogletree-Friend
slate would be a disaster for the
students of Stanford University.
The campaign which they have
conducted has consisted almost
entirely of intentional distortions
and smears, combined with a host
of proposals nearly every one of
which has been tried before and
failed, evaluated and deemed
impractical, or is currently in
existence.
One member of their slate,
Charles Ogletree, has a record
which clearly demonstrates a lack
of responsibility and an
insensitivity to ethics. He has

intentionally misrepresented my
record in office. He has made
questionable use of student funds
and abused his position as editor
of the Real News by republishing
his campaign literature in that
newspaper, a publication
supported by approximately
$2,000 in fees assessed on the
general student body. I am
convinced that such an individual
cannot safely be trusted with
authority.
The three other members of
the O'Grady slate know little or
nothing about the University.
Their proposal that a pub be
located in a building which was
totally demolished last Saturday is
characteristic of the quality of
their suggestions. Their interest in
University affairs is but a few
weeks old, their stated concern
for student services an obvious
attempt to conceal their political
orientation and their devotion to
special interests. The racial and
sexual balance of their ticket is a
cynical and blatant attempt to
win votes, and deserves to be
rejected.
The Van Petten-Anderson-
Flohr-Schott slate promises to
devote their energy to those areas
where ASSU officers can have
some effect — improving the lives
of Stanford students. They have
proven their committment to
beneficial change at the University
by working in every area of
importance to students, while
their opponents were doing
absolutely nothing for Stanford
students.
An examination of the record
of the incumbent Council of
Presidents will establish quite
clearly which approach brings
results. Peter Van Petten and I
have channelled our energy into
areas where there was some
prospect of achieving something
concrete for the students. We
totally reorganized the student
senate and kept it out of outside
politics; made all fee assessments
refundable; established a speakers
program on campus; substantially
boosted the number of women
and minorities on University
committees; helped to organize
the finest concert program in the
history of the University; helped
the Stanford Daily to attain
independence; led the opposition
to a repressive student judicial
system and then healed the
division with the faculty and

administration on that issue;
worked to defeat the Citizens
Advocates rip-off and proposed
the Stanford Legal Counseling
Office in its place. Those on
present and past Councils of
Presidents with a more political
orientation have yet to
accomplish anything of substance
at Stanford.
The choice in this election is
between action and rhetoric.
Students must reject the O'Grady
slate and its political orientation,
its dirty campaign tactics, and its
past record of questionable
conduct. Only the Van Petten
slate will work for change within
the University and has proven its
committment to student interests,
not special interests.
