Why is KZSU again asking for fee assessments? What is the status
of its revised FCC proposal? P.F.
According to a flier from KZSU passed around campus, the fee
assessment will be used to cover operating expenses. .. Our
operating expenses of $19,000 will be with us every year. KZSU is not
allowed to advertise—we are a non-commercial station, so we must
depend on the community we serve—the Stanford community—for
financial support. That is why KZSU is asking for a fee assessment for
next year of $2, one dollar a quarter for two quarters. ..."
Station manager Lloyd Snook says that it is likely that approval for
the switch to higher power will come in the next few weeks.
On Jan. 17, KZSU filed an application with the FCC for an
increase in power to 500 watts. (This was after an earlier application
for an increase to 3,000 watts had been turned down.)
After the application was accepted for filing, the public had 30
days to object to the power increase. The deadline for filing
complaints was April 15.
Snook does not know how long it will take the FCC to send out a
notice of the increase, but says that KZSU personnel are almost
completely prepared to switch to higher power and stereo
broadcasting.

Why does the University spend time and money to cut beautiful,
lush green grass along the campus streets? It will all be dead by May
anyway. The people who cut the grass could be planting flowers
instead. L.L.
Grounds Supervisor Fred Priddle said that the grass is cut because
of the fire hazard. He said "If the grass wasn't cut it would be two or
three feet high when it dried out in May and June. If someone
dropped a cigarette...."
According to Priddle, the only areas that are being mown are along
the roadways and pathways, and around Frost Amphitheater.
By the way, if you are interested in planting flowers, call Fred
Priddle at extension 4995. You can "adopt" a flower bed as part of
the spring beautification program.

I wonder where one does get refunds if he loses money in the
candy, cake, etc., machines on campus. I have lost $2.85 in a machine
in one of the high rises in Escondido Village. They have an address on
the machine which I wrote to, and got no response. H.A.M.
John Marston of the Plant Services Dept. said that different
departments and living units have slightly different ways of handling
the problem of refunds. He said that the secretaries in the department
where the uncooperative machine is located would handle refunds
either by repaying the lost cash, or having the money returned
through the mail.
Notice to H.A.M.: Please see John Marston about your problem.
He would like to make sure that it is solved.
