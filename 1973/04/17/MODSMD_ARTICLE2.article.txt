# Oakland Mayoral Race Features Seale Bid
## 
### KEVIN SMITH 
Black Panther Party Chairman
Bobby Seale is considered the top
challenger to incumbent John Reading
as Oakland voters go to the polls today
to elect a mayor. In addition, voters in
Berkeley will choose four new City
Council members and will vote on
eight controversial initiatives and
referenda.
If none of the eight candidates
running in the Oakland election
receives a majority of the votes cast in
this non-partisan race, a runoff
election between the two leading
mayoral candidates will take place in
May. The mayor's job is listed as a
part-time job with pay of only $7,500
a year, even though the duties of the
office are almost full time.
Most observers feel that the race
will shape up between Reading and
Seale, although two others contenders
— Otho Green, a former manpower
coordinator for the Office of
Economic Opportunity, and John
Sutter, a city councilman and attorney
— are also considered strong
candidates.
Reading, a conservative Republican,
is generally expected to finish on top,
but the question remains whether
Seale and the other six candidates can
prevent Reading from getting an
outright majority, thereby forcing a
runoff.

Besides Reading, Seale, Green, and
Sutter, other candidates in the race
include: Lothario Lotho, an actor and
journalist; Macklin Martin, who calls
himself a "job creator"; Larry Moore,
a student; and Alphonso Zapata, an
elected representative on Oakland's
anti-poverty board. All of the
candidates except Reading, Sutter and
Zapata are black. Oakland has a
population which is 50 percent white,
35 percent black, 10 percent Spanish
surname, and five percent Oriental and
other minorities. Democrats
outnumber Republicans three to one.
Reading first became mayor seven
years ago. He cites as one of his major
accomplishments the fact that, under
his administration, Oakland's port has
grown from small size into the second
largest containerized port in the world.
Name Recognition
Claiming to have better name
recognition among the voters than
Reading, Seale said, 'There's probably
not a child in the community who
doesn't know who I am. Many people
don't even know who the present
mayor is." He predicted he will win a
"landslide" victory.
Reading has commented on Seale's
"class" and has credited Seale with
running a "good campaign."
Green said that Reading suffered
from "a small town attitude" which
