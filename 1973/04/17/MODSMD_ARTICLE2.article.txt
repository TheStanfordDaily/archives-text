# Oakland Mayoral Race Features Seale Bid
## 
### KEVIN SMITH 
Black Panther Party Chairman
Bobby Seale is considered the top
challenger to incumbent John Reading
as Oakland voters go to the polls today
to elect a mayor. In addition, voters in
Berkeley will choose four new City
Council members and will vote on
eight controversial initiatives and
referenda.
If none of the eight candidates
running in the Oakland election
receives a majority of the votes cast in
this non-partisan race, a runoff
election between the two leading
mayoral candidates will take place in
May. The mayor's job is listed as a
part-time job with pay of only $7,500
a year, even though the duties of the
office are almost full time.
Most observers feel that the race
will shape up between Reading and
Seale, although two others contenders
— Otho Green, a former manpower
coordinator for the Office of
Economic Opportunity, and John
Sutter, a city councilman and attorney
— are also considered strong
candidates.
Reading, a conservative Republican,
is generally expected to finish on top,
but the question remains whether
Seale and the other six candidates can
prevent Reading from getting an
outright majority, thereby forcing a
runoff.

Besides Reading, Seale, Green, and
Sutter, other candidates in the race
include: Lothario Lotho, an actor and
journalist; Macklin Martin, who calls
himself a "job creator"; Larry Moore,
a student; and Alphonso Zapata, an
elected representative on Oakland's
anti-poverty board. All of the
candidates except Reading, Sutter and
Zapata are black. Oakland has a
population which is 50 percent white,
35 percent black, 10 percent Spanish
surname, and five percent Oriental and
other minorities. Democrats
outnumber Republicans three to one.
Reading first became mayor seven
years ago. He cites as one of his major
accomplishments the fact that, under
his administration, Oakland's port has
grown from small size into the second
largest containerized port in the world.
Name Recognition
Claiming to have better name
recognition among the voters than
Reading, Seale said, 'There's probably
not a child in the community who
doesn't know who I am. Many people
don't even know who the present
mayor is." He predicted he will win a
"landslide" victory.
Reading has commented on Seale's
"class" and has credited Seale with
running a "good campaign."
Green said that Reading suffered
from "a small town attitude" which

couldn't work in a "major
metropolitan city" like Oakland.
Seale has hinted that Green's
candidacy is secretly supported by
Reading. Green has countered by
calling Seale a type of "new medicine
man who seems to come along every
ten years, raising hopes and dreams
only to have them dashed again."
Sutter contrasted Reading to San
Francisco Mayor Joseph Alioto, calling
Alioto an "effective spokesman" while
labeling Reading a "non-leader."
Sutter has charged that major crime in
Oakland has increased 92 percent since
Reading took office.
Radicals Vs. Liberals
The race for four seats on the
Berkeley City Council has shaped up
as a fight between "radicals" and
"liberal non-radicals." There are 22
candidates vying for the open
positions, and the radicals need to fill
two of the four seats in order to grasp
control of the Council.
Both the radicals and the
non-radicals are running slates of
candidates. Two years ago, the radical
April Coalition took over three
Council seats, and is running a slate of
four candidates this year.
The slate includes: Peter Birdsall, a
Berkeley student; Margot Dashiell, a
sociology instructor at Laney College
in Oakland; Lenny Goldberg, an
economics instructor at Berkeley; and
Ying Lee Kelley, a teacher and
long-time antiwar activist.
Berkeley Four
The non-radicals, according to Mary
Dooley of the San Francisco
Examiner, consist of "some liberal
McGovern Democrats and everyone to
their right." They are backing a slate
of candidates known as the Berkeley
Four.
This slate includes: incumbent City
Council members Susan Hone and
Wilmont Sweeney; Joe Garrett, a
student who is presently not attending

school; and Boalt Hall Law Prof.
Henry Ramsey, Jr.
Ramsey presided as hearing officer
during the Campus Judicial Panel
hearing last year at Stanford which
resulted in the conviction of three
studeuui for disrupting a class taught
by Prof. William Shockley.
In addition to these two main
slates, there are three strong
independent candidates: City
Councilman Borden Price; former
president of the Berkeley Planning
Commission Harry Overstreet; and Leo
Bach, a left-leaning printer. Of the 14
independents, only one is a
Republican.
Marijuana Arrests
Among the eight initiatives and
referenda, perhaps the strangest
requires that the Berkeley Police
Department "shall give lowest priority
to the enforcement of the laws against
possession, use and cultivation of
marijuana." It also provides that police
shall make no marijuana arrests
without the authorization of the City
Council.
Four initiatives concerning the
police department include: an
ordinance forbidding the Berkeley
police from carrying any weapons
larger than small handguns;
establishment of a Police Review
Commission made up of Berkeley
citizens; a requirement that the
Council approve all mutual aid pacts
between the Berkeley police and other
law enforcement agencies; and a
requirement that all Police Dept.
employees live in Berkeley.
Another measure would shorten the
work week to 30 hours for city
employees with no loss of pay,
establish a "new planning process" to
preserve neighborhoods and regulate
residential construction and
demolition, and establish a municipal
election utility to replace Pacific, Gas
and Electric as the supplier of electric
power in Berkeley.
