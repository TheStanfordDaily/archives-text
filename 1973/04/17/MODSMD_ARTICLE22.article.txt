# 'Orestes' Opens Tonight
## 
### 
The premiere of Prof. John Chioles' new
translation of Euripedes' "Orestes" will be
presented by the Stanford Department of Drama at
8 tonight through April 21 and 24-28 in the Little
Theater on the north side of Memorial Auditorium.
Chioles has written this new translation out of
his conviction that unless he and others continue
their efforts at retranslation, these unique Greek
plays will cease to exist except in the libraries of a
few inquisitive antiquarians.
"Orestes," written in 408 8.C., concerns the
savage and inevitable fall of the House of Atreus,
concentrating particularly on Agamemnon's
children — the violent Orestes and his embittered
sister, Electra. In fact, the play exposes the
passionate death-rattle of a great civilization. With
this work, according to Chioles, Euripedes leaves

classicism behind and begins modern drama as we
have come to know it.
Orestes is played by Eric Booth Miller, who has
played leading roles in this season's "Twelfth Night"
and"The Beaux' Stratagem" and is the recipient of
the Peninsula Children's Theater Association Award
for 1973-74.
Carolyn Gillespie portrays the tortured Electra.
Over the past two years, Gillespie has played
prominent roles in "Twelfth Night," "Ghosts," and
"Edward II." Her gifts as an actress have brought
her an engagement with the Ashland Shakespeare
Festival's forthcoming summer season.
"Orestes" is directed by John Olon-Scrymgeour,
who directed "Twelfth Night" for the Drama
Department last November.
