## 'Godspell' Weaker In Film Version 
### KEVIN SMITH 
"Godspell," performed on the
stage, was one of the most
refreshing musicals to come along
in quite a while. Unfortunately, as
a new movie, this musical version
of the Gospel according to St.
Matthew loses many of the
qualities which made it such a fine
stage production.
"Godspell" is one of those
plays that demands a lot of
audience rapport to succeed. The
audience must be infected by the
spirit of the actors. By putting the
actors on a screen, much of that
essential feeling between the
audience and actors is lost, and
watching the movie simply
becomes a passive process.
Another problem is that
"Godspell" has no real plot, but
consists of a series of skits and
songs. This sort of production
works beautifully on the stage,
but "Godspell" just doesn't have
enough substance to make the
transition to the screen successful.
Still Enjoyable
Nevertheless, despite these
drawbacks, the movie is still
enjoyable. The original play was
set on a bare stage and since that
simplicity would have been
tedious on the screen, the movie

was filmed in New York City.
Although this new setting
ultimately fails, since the
characters seem very out of place
and even more detached from the
audience, it creates some
interesting moments.
For example, the famous
Accutron dock in Times Square is
put to good use as two figures
dance on top of it while the
Accutron lights silhoutte their

dance movements to produce a
nice effect. Similarly, Judas
arriving to betray Jesus, while
accompanied by two police cars,
adds a very fine touch.
Several of the original scenes
from the play come off quite well
with some clever innovations. The
scene portraying the Prodigal Son
parable makes a very funny use of
old movie clips, with Charlie
Chaplin, Buster Keaton and
others, to illustrate the points of
the parable. This is one of the best
scenes in the film, played with

just the right amount of sarcasm
and humor.
The finale is powerful, showing
Jesus affixed to a chainlink fence
with the flashing red lights of the
police cars illuminating the faces
of all of his anguished disciples.
However the finale becomes too
overdramatic when the disciples
begin shaking the fence
hysterically in despair, which
somewhat destroys an otherwise

moving moment.
This overacting displays itself
in other ways. The whole movie is
somehow a little too
cute—certainly cuter than I
remembered the play. Perhaps,
though, the cuteness just becomes
more apparent on the screen.
Whether in play or movie form,
the music still remains by far the
best part of "Godspell." The
movie contains all of the original
songs plus one new number
entitled "Beautiful City."
However the screen separating the

audience from the performers
hampers the songs considerably. It
is like the difference between
seeing and hearing a concert live,
and watching and listening to it
on a movie screen.
Original Cast
The cast of 10 includes five
members from the original New
York production and an
additional five performers from
various other productions of

"Godspell" around the country.
Only six of the ten performers are
listed in the screen credits,
however, which is very odd.
While most of the songs are
performed well, some of the best
songs are disappointing and do
not match up to the qualityof the
same songs from the fine original
cast recording.
For those of you who like the
hit song "Day by Day," Robin
Lamont does as fine a job singing
it in the film as she does on the
original recording. The cast also

offers a lively version of "Light of
the World" while on a ship
cruising around New York harbor
with the Statue of Liberty in the
background.
However two of the finest
songs are considerably below par.
The greatly satirical 'Turn Back,
0 Man," sung by Joanne Jonas
who was in the original cast but
did not sing this song, is not as
exaggerated as it should be. The
song becomes much more
effective when sung by a singer
who dredges up images of Mae
West, as in the original, rather
than one who comes on like
Marilyn Monroe, as Jonas does.
Bad Performance
In addition, one of the finest
songs every written—the
hauntingly beautiful "By My
Side"—is not performed well at
all. The original version was much
prettier and less syrupy, and the
voices in the movie seem almost
out of tune.
The music and several of the
scenes make the movie a
worthwhile one, but "Godspell" is
perfectly designed for the stage
and simply does not have enough
substance to become a really
satisfying movie.
The screen placed in between
the performers and the audience
detracts from the vitality of the
production immensely, and the
New York City setting, while
adding some nice touches, has the
overall effect of making the
performers seem out of place
instead of making them more
"relevant" as was obviously
intended. "Godspell" isn't a bad
movie, but if you have the chance,
go see the play.
