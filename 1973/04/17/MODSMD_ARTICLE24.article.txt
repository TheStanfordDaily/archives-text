# Volenti Gives Lively Concert
## 
### BRUCE LAMOTT 
A harpsichord recital in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium Friday
night presented two real
entertainers—Fernando Valenti
and Domenico Scarlatti, the
former playing sonatas of the
latter. Dismissing any expectation
of musical erudition from the
start, Valenti stated his intention
to "bomb right through one batch
after another until I drop." This
banter between performer and
composer resulted in a
performance of irresistible verve.
The 550-plus keyboard sonatas
by Scarlatti (1685-1757) are
identified only by key and
catalogue number, though it
seems inconceivable that their
variegated personalities could have
escaped nicknames in the
nineteenth centuries. Thus the
audience received no printed
program, relying instead on the
artist's colorful commentary.
Valenti's monologue introduced
composer to audience like old
friends, shedding the formality of
recital protocol.
Nearly all of the sonatas are

short, structured in the same
binary form, though their diverse
characters belie this similarity.
They exploit the harpsichord
idiom to its maximum, employing
crossed hands, octave
passagework, and startling
textural and harmonic changes.
Vigorous Rhythm
As Scarlatti spent his last years
in service to courts in Portugal
and Spain, his music exhibits
much of the vigorous rhythm and
colorful harmony of virtuoso
guitar literature. One selection
bore astonishing similarity to a
mazurka (the composer also
served the Queen of Poland).
Further variety was heard in the
curious work introduced by the
remark, "When Scarlatti writes in
the key of b-minor, he thinks he's
Brahms!"
Valenti well met the
extraordinary technical demands
of these works, of which he has
made numerous recordings.
Though his technique is
particularly heavy-handed and
pianistic, there is no arguing with
his deadly accuracy and rhythmic

vitality.
A large Challis harpsichord
provided a complete bag-of-tricks
for registration changes. Though
tempos were somewhat
exaggerated, partly through the
selection of a disproportionate
number of Allegro sonatas, there
is much to be siad for Valenti's
perception of the capricious
humor of the music.
The Valenti-Scarlatti duo, if it
does not adhere to the letter of

historical performance practices,
does indeed convey the spirit of
the late eighteenth century. To
create the good-natured intimacy
of hte chamber in the spacious
void of the concert hall is a
difficult task neatly accomplished
by Valenti the entertainer. And
the jovial, sometimes rhapsodic
musical statement of Valenti the
performer calls for delight, not
reverence.
