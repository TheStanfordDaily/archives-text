# 'Dance Spectrum' Exhibits Choreographic Diversity
## 
### RUST EDDIE 
If, as Jean Anouilh has said, "talent is like
a faucet," Carlos Carvajal has not turned his
off. Carvajal's conduit is "Dance Spectrum"
which under his direction combines ballet,
modern dance, jazz and ethnic styles.
Carvajal's "Gala" program staged Saturday
evening at Lone Mountain College in San
Francisco was the sixth in a six-week season
of 18 performances. The "Gala" consisted of
three separate pieces—"lridis," "Sacateca,"
and "Counterpoise"—the first having its San
Francisco premiere plus the second and third
having world premiers the week before.
I saw the "Gala" with a packed and paying
public that laughed and screamed and nudged
one another tellingly. Drawing on his
experience and following with the San
Francisco Ballet up until three years ago,
Carvajal, as director of his own company, has
grown through artistic license.
Modesty
Master or near master, the great virtue of

Carvajal's show is its modesty, with tickets
priced accordingly, a virtue to be cherished
just now since there is so little of it around.
Even the homemade refreshments offered
during both intermissions in the lobby of
Lone Mountain College's pinchy Wade
Theater were bargain-priced.
The first work performed Saturday from
the "Gala" trilogy was "Iridis" a classical,
romantic ballet danced to Ravel's, "Le
Tombeau de Couperain." Choreographed by
Carvajal for the Kansas City Ballet last year,
"Iridis" alone would justify a trip to see
"Dance Spectrum." Carvajal's female dancers,
harmonizing evenly, look like well-endowed
nymphs searching for shepherds in Carolyn
Houser's handsome body veils—so fine they
could be pulled through the ring on your little
finger.
"Sateca," the evenings second feature, is a
modern ballet by Jean Mathis set to Toru
Takemitsu's, "Cassiopeia." An on stage

flammability test before a scalable macrame
backdrop add to this voltage experience.
Disappointing Ending
The "Gala" evening ended with
'Counterpoise" which, despite Carvajal's
competent choreography, I disliked most
cordially. Performed with the polish and
glitter of a Las Vegas nightclub act, Carvajal's
staging to Prokofiev's 'Third Paino Concerts"
slips into the pure modern rococo
expressionism that has been endemic now for
about 40 years.
Saved largely through inspired
performances by the company's tallest and
shortest male dancers, repsectively Dudley
Brooks and Sulpicio Wagner, "Counterpoise"
provides an object lesson in punctuality, for
the "Gala" evening ended on a downbeat.
Yet, the skill with which Carvajal deploys
his large cast on a small stage is exemplary and
the dancers become part of the work in a
manner that holds out great hope for
Carvajal's future.

Theater were bargain-priced.
The first work performed Saturday from
the "Gala" trilogy was "Iridis" a classical,
romantic ballet danced to Ravel's, "Le
Tombeau de Couperain." Choreographed by
Carvajal for the Kansas City Ballet last year,
"Iridis" alone would justify a trip to see
"Dance Spectrum." Carvajal's female dancers,
harmonizing evenly, look like well-endowed
nymphs searching for shepherds in Carolyn
Houser's handsome body veils—so fine they
could be pulled through the ring on your little
finger.
"Sateca," the evenings second feature, is a
modern ballet by Jean Mathis set to Toru
Takemitsu's, "Cassiopeia." An on stage

flammability test before a scalable macrame
backdrop add to this voltage experience.
Disappointing Ending
The "Gala" evening ended with
'Counterpoise" which, despite Carvajal's
competent choreography, I disliked most
cordially. Performed with the polish and
glitter of a Las Vegas nightclub act, Carvajal's
staging to Prokofiev's 'Third Paino Concerts"
slips into the pure modern rococo
expressionism that has been endemic now for
about 40 years.
Saved largely through inspired
performances by the company's tallest and
shortest male dancers, repsectively Dudley
Brooks and Sulpicio Wagner, "Counterpoise"
provides an object lesson in punctuality, for
the "Gala" evening ended on a downbeat.
Yet, the skill with which Carvajal deploys
his large cast on a small stage is exemplary and
the dancers become part of the work in a
manner that holds out great hope for
Carvajal's future.

UPCOMING CONCERTS — The New York String Sextet will present two concerts at Stanford April 24
and 28 at 8 in Dinkelspiel Auditorium. Tickets are $4.50, with a 75 cent reduction for students.
If, as Jean Anouilh has said, "talent is like
a faucet," Carlos Carvajal has not turned his
off. Carvajal's conduit is "Dance Spectrum"
which under his direction combines ballet,
modern dance, jazz and ethnic styles.
Carvajal's "Gala" program staged Saturday
evening at Lone Mountain College in San
Francisco was the sixth in a six-week season
of 18 performances. The "Gala" consisted of
three separate pieces—"lridis," "Sacateca,"
and "Counterpoise"—the first having its San
Francisco premiere plus the second and third
having world premiers the week before.
I saw the "Gala" with a packed and paying
public that laughed and screamed and nudged
one another tellingly. Drawing on his
experience and following with the San
Francisco Ballet up until three years ago,
Carvajal, as director of his own company, has
grown through artistic license.
Modesty
Master or near master, the great virtue of

Carvajal's show is its modesty, with tickets
priced accordingly, a virtue to be cherished
just now since there is so little of it around.
Even the homemade refreshments offered
during both intermissions in the lobby of
Lone Mountain College's pinchy Wade
Theater were bargain-priced.
