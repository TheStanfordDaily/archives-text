# The 						Stanford Daily Entertainment
## String Sextet To Perform 
### 
The New York String Sextet will present two
Stanford concerts at 8 April 24 and 28, in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
Tuesday's program will be the Boccerini Quintet
Op. 13, No. 4 in F Major; the Mozart Quintet in C
Major, K. 515; and the Brahms Sextet Op. 36, No. 2
in C Major.
On Saturday the group will play a Haydn Double
Trio in E-Flat Major ("The Echo"); the Schoenberg
Sextet Op. 4 ("Verklaerte Nacht"); and the
Schubert Quintet Op. 163 in C Major.
Sextet members are Renato Bonacini and Jean

Tai, violinists, Paul Doktor and Heidi Castleman,
violinists, and Janos Scholz and Evemarie Ell,
cellists.
The sextet was founded by Paul Doktor in 1960
to perform rarely heard masterpieces for five and six
strings. A permanent group of six like this one
should have the advantages of being better rehearsed
and integrated in their playing of quintets and
sextets than a quartet which invites one or two
guest artists to join for a specific occasion.
Tickets at $4.50 are now being sold at Tresidder
Union. A student discount of 75 cents is available at
Tresidder Union or at the door.
