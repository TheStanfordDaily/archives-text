# Duke Ellington Still Entertaining
## 
### DAN FORTE 
Friday night, April 13, Duke
Ellington and his orchestra
appeared at the Great American
Music Hall in San Francisco. It
was one concert that I'm sure I'll
never forget. Ellington and his
band played with such vitality and
finesse that it was everything I'd
hope for and more.
An extra bonus that comes
with every Duke Ellington concert
is Ellington himself. Now 72 years
old, Ellington comes across as one
of the warmest personalities I've
ever seen on stage. His quotes are
priceless. In fact, everything he
says seems to be thought out, as
though it were meant to be
quoted.
Duke Ellington is probably as
famous as any musician alive, and
is easily the most influential
jazzman around today. The band
with which he performed in San
Francisco consisted of 14
members (not counting Duke),
including some of the best jazz
musicians working, both old and
new.
Some of the members were
Harold Ashby on tenor
saxophone, Russel Procote on alto
and clarinet, Harold Miller (sic) on
alto and flute, Paul Gonsalves on
tenor (who has been in the band
since 1951), Harry Carney on
baritone sax (who first joined
Ellington in 1923), Johnny Cole,
Money Johnson, and Mercer
Ellington (Duke's son) on
trumpets, and drummer Rufus
Jones. There were also three
trombones, a French horn, and a
string bass whose names I didn't
catch.
The band preceded Ellington

with great renditions of three of
his standards, "C-Jam Blues,"
"Perdido," and "Cottontail."
When Ellington made his
entrance, he sat down at the piano
and started with perhaps his most
famous composition, "Satin
Doll." He dedicated it to "the
most beautiful girl in the house,
because you know she knows that
we know who she is."
The next number featured the
band's "apprentice painist,"
Ellington. It was "Rockin' In
Rhythm." His piano work was
very tasteful.
Some of the other Ellington
standards included: "In A
Sentimental Mood," with
Gonsalves playing to a girl in the
front row. (At one point during
his solo, after hitting a perfect
"blue note," Gonsalves stopped
and said, "Hey Duke, how about a
raise?"); "Creole Love Call,"
featuring the clarinet section; and
"Warm Valley," by request.
McLuhan Inspirational
Before taking an intermission,
Ellington ended the first half of
the show with part of a suite he
wrote entitled "Afro-Eurasian
Eclipse." Duke said he got the
inspiration for the songs title from
a quote by Marshall McLuhan.
'The whole world is going
oriental, and it's getting hard for
one to keep his own identity."
For me, the best song of the
first set, the whole night, and of
all time was Ellington's theme
song, "Take the 'A'Train."
Throughout the evening, the
band was making jokes about Paul

Gonsalves' "over indulgence in the
most over-indulged form of over
indulgence." It was something else
to see him get up for a solo
staggering and then proceed to
blow an incredible tune like
"Diminuendo In Blue," (not to
mention "Sentimental Mood").
Also included in the second set
was "Mack The Knife," with
Money Johnson singing a Louis
Armstrong vocal. "Sophisticated
Lady" featured a beautiful
baritone sax solo by Carney. He
hit one note that must have lasted
about sixty seconds.
At the end of the show,
Ellington brought up his vocalist,
Tony Watkins, who sings sort of a
Billy Ekstine impersonation with
a touch of soul. I didn't care for
him at all. He was too stagey, and
the whole thing seemed out of
place.
Watkins sang "Solitude," "I
Love You Madly," "You Made Me
Blue," and a soul number called
"One More Time." I thought this
was a very inappropriate way to
end a concert of swing music.
The one thing that really
struck me, looking back on the
whole concert, was the fact that
so many people aren't really
aware of Duke Ellington other
than just hearing of his name. Few
young people have any idea of
what the Big Band Era was all
about, and unfortunately those
same people passed up a great
opportunity to find out firsthand.
Duke Ellington is practically
the last of the big bands, and he
won't be around forever. People
don't realize it now, but in 20

years, people will definitely be
sorry when Swing is no longer. If
you ever do get a chance to see
Ellington in person, I can
guarantee it will be an experience
to tell your kids about.
I would like to mention one
thing about The Great American
Music Hall. Although the tickets
for the Ellington show were

priced at six dollars each, it was
definitely worth it, because the
place offers a nice atmosphere
with a good view from every seat.
No one had to sit more than 50
feet from the stage. The Great
American Music Hall plans to bring
a lot more good jazz to the Bay
Area, and I would suggest
checking them out.

was one concert that I'm sure I'll
never forget. Ellington and his
band played with such vitality and
finesse that it was everything I'd
hope for and more.
An extra bonus that comes
with every Duke Ellington concert
is Ellington himself. Now 72 years
old, Ellington comes across as one
of the warmest personalities I've
ever seen on stage. His quotes are
priceless. In fact, everything he
says seems to be thought out, as
though it were meant to be
quoted.
Duke Ellington is probably as
famous as any musician alive, and
is easily the most influential
jazzman around today. The band
with which he performed in San
Francisco consisted of 14
members (not counting Duke),
including some of the best jazz
musicians working, both old and
new.
Some of the members were
Harold Ashby on tenor
saxophone, Russel Procote on alto
and clarinet, Harold Miller (sic) on
alto and flute, Paul Gonsalves on
tenor (who has been in the band
since 1951), Harry Carney on
baritone sax (who first joined
Ellington in 1923), Johnny Cole,
Money Johnson, and Mercer
Ellington (Duke's son) on
trumpets, and drummer Rufus
Jones. There were also three
trombones, a French horn, and a
string bass whose names I didn't
catch.
The band preceded Ellington

with great renditions of three of
his standards, "C-Jam Blues,"
"Perdido," and "Cottontail."
When Ellington made his
entrance, he sat down at the piano
and started with perhaps his most
famous composition, "Satin
Doll." He dedicated it to "the
most beautiful girl in the house,
because you know she knows that
we know who she is."
The next number featured the
band's "apprentice painist,"
Ellington. It was "Rockin' In
Rhythm." His piano work was
very tasteful.
Some of the other Ellington
standards included: "In A
Sentimental Mood," with
Gonsalves playing to a girl in the
front row. (At one point during
his solo, after hitting a perfect
"blue note," Gonsalves stopped
and said, "Hey Duke, how about a
raise?"); "Creole Love Call,"
featuring the clarinet section; and
"Warm Valley," by request.
McLuhan Inspirational
Before taking an intermission,
Ellington ended the first half of
the show with part of a suite he
wrote entitled "Afro-Eurasian
Eclipse." Duke said he got the
inspiration for the songs title from
a quote by Marshall McLuhan.
'The whole world is going
oriental, and it's getting hard for
one to keep his own identity."
For me, the best song of the
first set, the whole night, and of
all time was Ellington's theme
song, "Take the 'A'Train."
Throughout the evening, the
band was making jokes about Paul

Gonsalves' "over indulgence in the
most over-indulged form of over
indulgence." It was something else
to see him get up for a solo
staggering and then proceed to
blow an incredible tune like
"Diminuendo In Blue," (not to
mention "Sentimental Mood").
Also included in the second set
was "Mack The Knife," with
Money Johnson singing a Louis
Armstrong vocal. "Sophisticated
Lady" featured a beautiful
baritone sax solo by Carney. He
hit one note that must have lasted
about sixty seconds.
At the end of the show,
Ellington brought up his vocalist,
Tony Watkins, who sings sort of a
Billy Ekstine impersonation with
a touch of soul. I didn't care for
him at all. He was too stagey, and
the whole thing seemed out of
place.
Watkins sang "Solitude," "I
Love You Madly," "You Made Me
Blue," and a soul number called
"One More Time." I thought this
was a very inappropriate way to
end a concert of swing music.
The one thing that really
struck me, looking back on the
whole concert, was the fact that
so many people aren't really
aware of Duke Ellington other
than just hearing of his name. Few
young people have any idea of
what the Big Band Era was all
about, and unfortunately those
same people passed up a great
opportunity to find out firsthand.
Duke Ellington is practically
the last of the big bands, and he
won't be around forever. People
don't realize it now, but in 20

years, people will definitely be
sorry when Swing is no longer. If
you ever do get a chance to see
Ellington in person, I can
guarantee it will be an experience
to tell your kids about.
I would like to mention one
thing about The Great American
Music Hall. Although the tickets
for the Ellington show were

priced at six dollars each, it was
definitely worth it, because the
place offers a nice atmosphere
with a good view from every seat.
No one had to sit more than 50
feet from the stage. The Great
American Music Hall plans to bring
a lot more good jazz to the Bay
Area, and I would suggest
checking them out.

hope for and more.
An extra bonus that comes
with every Duke Ellington concert
is Ellington himself. Now 72 years
old, Ellington comes across as one
of the warmest personalities I've
ever seen on stage. His quotes are
priceless. In fact, everything he
says seems to be thought out, as
though it were meant to be
quoted.
Duke Ellington is probably as
famous as any musician alive, and
is easily the most influential
jazzman around today. The band
with which he performed in San
Francisco consisted of 14
members (not counting Duke),
including some of the best jazz
musicians working, both old and
new.
Some of the members were
Harold Ashby on tenor
saxophone, Russel Procote on alto
and clarinet, Harold Miller (sic) on
alto and flute, Paul Gonsalves on
tenor (who has been in the band
since 1951), Harry Carney on
baritone sax (who first joined
Ellington in 1923), Johnny Cole,
Money Johnson, and Mercer
Ellington (Duke's son) on
trumpets, and drummer Rufus
Jones. There were also three
trombones, a French horn, and a
string bass whose names I didn't
catch.
The band preceded Ellington

with great renditions of three of
his standards, "C-Jam Blues,"
"Perdido," and "Cottontail."
When Ellington made his
entrance, he sat down at the piano
and started with perhaps his most
famous composition, "Satin
Doll." He dedicated it to "the
most beautiful girl in the house,
because you know she knows that
we know who she is."
The next number featured the
band's "apprentice painist,"
Ellington. It was "Rockin' In
Rhythm." His piano work was
very tasteful.
Some of the other Ellington
standards included: "In A
Sentimental Mood," with
Gonsalves playing to a girl in the
front row. (At one point during
his solo, after hitting a perfect
"blue note," Gonsalves stopped
and said, "Hey Duke, how about a
raise?"); "Creole Love Call,"
featuring the clarinet section; and
"Warm Valley," by request.
McLuhan Inspirational
Before taking an intermission,
Ellington ended the first half of
the show with part of a suite he
wrote entitled "Afro-Eurasian
Eclipse." Duke said he got the
inspiration for the songs title from
a quote by Marshall McLuhan.
'The whole world is going
oriental, and it's getting hard for
one to keep his own identity."
For me, the best song of the
first set, the whole night, and of
all time was Ellington's theme
song, "Take the 'A'Train."
Throughout the evening, the
band was making jokes about Paul

Gonsalves' "over indulgence in the
most over-indulged form of over
indulgence." It was something else
to see him get up for a solo
staggering and then proceed to
blow an incredible tune like
"Diminuendo In Blue," (not to
mention "Sentimental Mood").
Also included in the second set
was "Mack The Knife," with
Money Johnson singing a Louis
Armstrong vocal. "Sophisticated
Lady" featured a beautiful
baritone sax solo by Carney. He
hit one note that must have lasted
about sixty seconds.
At the end of the show,
Ellington brought up his vocalist,
Tony Watkins, who sings sort of a
Billy Ekstine impersonation with
a touch of soul. I didn't care for
him at all. He was too stagey, and
the whole thing seemed out of
place.
Watkins sang "Solitude," "I
Love You Madly," "You Made Me
Blue," and a soul number called
"One More Time." I thought this
was a very inappropriate way to
end a concert of swing music.
The one thing that really
struck me, looking back on the
whole concert, was the fact that
so many people aren't really
aware of Duke Ellington other
than just hearing of his name. Few
young people have any idea of
what the Big Band Era was all
about, and unfortunately those
same people passed up a great
opportunity to find out firsthand.
Duke Ellington is practically
the last of the big bands, and he
won't be around forever. People
don't realize it now, but in 20

years, people will definitely be
sorry when Swing is no longer. If
you ever do get a chance to see
Ellington in person, I can
guarantee it will be an experience
to tell your kids about.
I would like to mention one
thing about The Great American
Music Hall. Although the tickets
for the Ellington show were

priced at six dollars each, it was
definitely worth it, because the
place offers a nice atmosphere
with a good view from every seat.
No one had to sit more than 50
feet from the stage. The Great
American Music Hall plans to bring
a lot more good jazz to the Bay
Area, and I would suggest
checking them out.
Friday night, April 13, Duke
Ellington and his orchestra
appeared at the Great American
Music Hall in San Francisco. It
was one concert that I'm sure I'll
never forget. Ellington and his
band played with such vitality and

hope for and more.
