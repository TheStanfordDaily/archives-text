# Garcia, Saunders 'Together' At Boarding House Theater In SF
## 
### JAY HARLOW 
Friday night, Jerry Garcia and
Merl Saunders returned to the
Boarding House in San Francisco
for a two-night stay. They were
joined by guitarist George
Pichner, who seems to me an
important enough part of the
group to deserve equal billing.
The show got under way quite
late. To get good seats at the
Boarding House, one has to either
come for dinner or show up about
8 for a 9:00 show.
So, by the time 9:15 rolled
around, the crowd began to get a
bit noisy. About 9:30 we got the
word that the band was still
waiting for the bass player. Five
minutes later, he was outside
looking for a parking space, and
eventually came walking in
through the audience, being
occasionally booed and heckled.
The music started a little

before 10:00 with "That's the
Touch I Like," which mainly
spotlighted Garcia on guitar and
Saunders on organ. Garcia's guitar
has a very clear, unadulterated
sound, with the same sort of
cleanness as a good dry white
wine. A friend named Sarah
helped with the vocals on some
numbers, and particularly shone
on "Honey Child." Her voice is
not great, and might not stand on
its own, but it blends very nicely
with Garcia's guitar.
In the middle of the set, there
was a long, beautiful instrumental
number in which everyone had
some solo space. Saunders has a
very powerful style, with such a
range of dynamics, tone, and
phrasing that it is unbelievably
expressive. Pichner, who had been
playing mostly rhythm guitar so
far, did some good leads, a la Eric
Clapton at times. His somewhat

harsher tone sets off Garcia and
Saunders very well.
The rhythm section did some
excellent work too. Drummer Bill
Vitt is one of the more
imaginative drummers I have
heard, and doesn't haveto pound
the hell out of the things to let
you know he's there. And bassist
John Kahn was certainly worth
waiting for. Both in backup and
solo playing, he is a real stylist. At
times the flair in his left-hand
fingerings reminded me of a
classical guitarist.
At one point I got the feeling
that there were five solos going on

at once, each complementing the
others, and never getting in each
other's way. That's awfully hard
to do, but they pulled it off.
The rest of the set was a
variety of styles, from easy
rocking Dead-style tunes like
"That's All Right" to "Lonely
Avenue," a blues sung by Garcia,
and Stevie Wonder's old rhythm &
blues hit, "I Second That
Emotion," again with Sarah on
vocals. Each one was marked by
Garcia's unmistakable guitar style,
as well as the sound of a bunch of
first-rate musicians really working
together.
