Military Cutbacks Revealed
WASHINGTON — Congressmen say the Pentagon
notified them yesterday it will close down or cut
back 274 military installations by the end of next
year in the biggest base cutback since 1970.
The closure will eliminate 21,172 civilian and
16,640 military jobs, a reliable Senate source said
after a Pentagon briefing.
A 3-inch thick cutback list obtained by The
Associated Press shows two major shipyards in
Boston and San Francisco, two naval bases, two Air
Force bases and at least seven Naval air stations are
to be closed down.
The Army will reportedly suffer separate
cutbacks this summer when the six U.S. Army
commands are reorganized.
Sen. Edward W. Brooke (R.-Mass.), quoted
Pentagon officials as saying the base closings and
cutbacks will slice $275 million off military
spending the first year.
Secretary of Defense Elliot L. Richardson has so
far accepted former secretary Melvin R. Laird's
figure of a total long-range $1 billion savings from
the cutbacks.
Three California naval bases and an Air Force
base — San Francisco's Hunter's Point Naval
Shipyard, Long Becah Naval Shipyard, Imperial
Beach Naval Air Station and Hamilton Air Force
Base — were listed among those bases that will be
shut down.
Flying activity at Alameda Naval Air Station will
be transferred to Moffett Field at Sunnyvale, the
Pentagon said.
House Rejects Price Rollback
WASHINGTON — The House voted a one-year
extension of President Nixon's economic powers
Monday, rejecting all proposals for price freezes or
rollbacks. The vote was 293 to 114.
The House action, following passage of a similar
bill by the Senate, gives Nixon a thumping triumph
in his confrontation with the Democratic-controlled
Congress on the cost of living issue.
Some Democrats ruefully noted this during the
debate.
The possibility remained that the bill, finally
enacted, after a House-Senate conference, will
contain some mandatory rent control sections.
In a related development, administration officials
said that Nixon was considering wage-price controls
and that a decision may come this week.
Sources said Nixon is weighing options ranging
from a freeze to tightening of the present largely
voluntary controls, to returning to a free market
system free of control.
Nixon and the practically solid House
Republicans held out for a one-year extension of
the President's discretionary control powers, which
expire April 30, with no strings tied.
The House bill comes close to this. One
amendment adopted provides that, when wage
control actions result in a reduction in actual pay or
in negotiated settlements, a public hearing must be
provided.
Republicans answered all pleas for a

Congress-mandated control program with the
argument that the lawmakers should not deny the
executive flexibility.
Watergate Committee Backs Ervin
WASHINGTON - The Senate Watergate
investigating committee yesterday backed its
chairman's insistence that all witnesses, including
White House aides, give sworn public testimony.
Chairman Sam J. Ervin (D-N.C.), said there have
been recent "feelers" from the White House on a
possible compromise but that "no deals" have been
worked out.
The committee voted to begin hearings about
May 15, to open them to public and press and to
have all witnesses testify under oath.
Ervin said the seven-member panel also approved
a set of guidelines governing the hearings. They will
be issued publicly later, he said.
Ervin's statements appeared to dash persistent
rumors that agreement was close between the White
House and the committee on an arrangement
permitting aides to appear.
Ervin has said he is prepared to ask for the arrest
of any person who refuses to testify, including
high-ranking White House staff members.
U.S. Atty. Gen. Richard Kleindienst recently
declared the doctrine of executive privilege permits
Nixon to forbid any of the nation's 2.5 million
federal workers from testifying before Congress.
Ervin said of the White House aides: "We've been
praying to the good Lord they will come and
testify" without a constitutional confrontation with
the Congress.
He again rejected a White House suggestion that
the aides be questioned through a series of written
questions and answers.
Ervin said live television would be allowed to
cover the hearings except for possible
"extraordinary" circumstances which he said he
can't foresee.
Meany Attacks 'Nixonomics'
WASHINGTON — President Nixon thanked "hard
hat" labor leaders yesterday for supporting his
Vietnam policies, but drew a stinging attack from
AFL-CIO President George Meany for failing to
curb inflation.
Meany called the administration's economic
game plan Phase One through Phase Three "a
complete, miserable failure," and declared the only
hope is for Congress to approve legislation rolling
back all prices, interest rates and rents and curbing
excess business profits.
There can be no equity for the working man as
long as wage increases are held to 5.5 percent while
prices skyrocket, Meany told delegates to the
AFL-CIO Building and Construction Trades
Department's annual legislative conference.
In his speech, Nixon skirted economic issues. He
stressed instead the need to hold down government
spending and thanked the construction workers for
backing him on Vietnam.
Nixon said he was giving it to them "straight
from the shoulder," in explaining why he recently
vetoed legislation including the vocational

rehabilitation act, to hold down government
spending.
If spending goes unchecked, said Nixon, taxes
will go up, prices will rise and unemployment will
increase.
Ellsberg Justifies Disclosures
LOS ANGELES — An intense Daniel Ellsberg told
the jurors yesterday that he copied the Pentagon
Papers after assuring himself their release could not
have injured the national defense or caused the
death of U.S. soldiers serving in Vietnam.
"I believed ... that not a page of those
documents could injure the national defense if
disclosed to anyone," the defendant testified. "If I
had believed otherwise I would have not copied
them."
Ellsberg added, "I did not feel that any of that
information could cause the death of a single soldier
serving in Vietnam or yet to go to Vietnam ... it
was information that was very stale by that time."
Ellsberg, interrupted frequently by objections by
the government prosecuter, managed to tell jurors
that he wanted to get the papers to Congress in
1969 because "my conclusion, summing up these
papers, was that the war would not end until the
Congress shared this information ..."
Ellsberg said he knew the release of the top
secret papers — an in depth study of the U.S. role in
Vietnam — would be "painful" to officials. "It was
painful knowledge, but it was important to the
United States," he said.
He said the papers had changed his own mind
about the war — leading him to believe that four
presidents of the United States had been lying to
the American public.
Court Rejects HEW Appeal
WASHINGTON — A federal appeals court yesterday
rejected the Nixon administration's appeal for
postponement of the deadline for the Department
of Health, Education and Welfare to step up
desegregation enforcement.
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia issued the ruling less than an hour after
government attorneys argued that HEW had shown
"good faith" in implementing earlier court-ordered
integration plans.
A Feb. 16 ruling by a lower court judge held that
by today, HEW must send letters to 116 secondary
and elementary school districts advising them of
hearings on their desegregation plans.
Under the ruling, another 85 districts were to
have been asked by today to explain statistics
indicating they are still practicing segregation.
The appeals court decision does not cut off
federal funds to the districts, but merely requires
HEW to issue notices that desegregation plans are
being re-examined.
