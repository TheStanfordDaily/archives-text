# Cambodian Problems Continue
## U.S. Renews Laotian Bombing 
### 
WASHINGTON — North Vietnamese
and Communist Pathet Lao forces
overran a town in Laos yesterday,
prompting the Pentagon to order U.S.
bombers to hit targets in that country
for the first time in six weeks.
At the same time, South
Vietnamese forces crossed tlu
Vietnam-Cambodia border to
investigate reports that a Communist
division had moved into a cluster of
hills near the border town of Tinh
Bien, South Vietnam.
Pentagon spokesman Jerry W.
Friedheim said the Laotian bombing
was in response to "a major violation
of the cease-fire."
The Pentagon spokesman said
Communist forces, led by tanks and
supported by heavy artillery, had
rumbled through and taken control of
Tha Vieng, south of the vital Plaine De
Jares region in central Laos.
"There has been a considerable fire
fight there for a couple of days,"
Friedheim said of the battle between
Communist forces and Royal Laotian
troops for control of the town.
Details Unavailable
Beyond that, he could provide no
details on the size of the North
Vietnamese or Pathet Lao forces, or
casualties suffered by forces under the
control of Laotian Premier Souvanna
Phouma.
A Pentagon source said American
852 bombers and Fill
fighter-bombers were hitting
Communist troop concentrations
around Tha Vieng, but nowhere else in
Laos.
American bombers have been
hitting targets in Cambodia for about
six weeks.
There has been no bombing by
Americans in Vietnam since the
cease-fire was signed Jan. 27.
More Protests Expected
Congressional critics have attacked
the Cambodian bombing campaign as

having no constitutional basis and the
new attacks in Laos are sure to draw
more of the same kind of protests.
A brief announcement from
headquarters of the U.S. Pacific
Command in Honolulu said, "At the
request of the Royal Laotian
government, U.S. aircraft including
852s . .. conducted operations over
Laos."
Pentagon officials would disclose
neither the number of sorties nor how
long they expect the strikes in Laos to
continue.
Reason For Bombing
But one source said the presence of
the tanks and heavy weapons was the
primary reason why American
bombers were ordered in for the first
time since Feb. 23.
While U.S. air attacks over Laos
resumed, South Vietnamese armored
vehicles and helicopters swept back
and forth across the
Cambodia-Vietnam border yesterday
near Tinh Bien.
Sharp fighting was reported deeper
inside Cambodia between government
troops and Communist command
forces east of Phnom Penh. Thirty-two
Cambodian soldiers, including three
top officers, were reported killed.
Cambodian Excursion
About 25 South Vietnamese
armored vehicles wheeled across the
South Vietnamese border near Tinh
Bien into Cambodia following reports
that a Communist division had moved
into a cluster of hills.
Despite witness' accounts to the
contrary, some local commanders and
Saigon command spokesmen deny
their forces have crossed the frontier.
The border was later sealed off to
newsmen.
"We are conducting a screening
operation," said Col. Hoang Due Ninh,
who commands South Vietnamese
forces in four border provinces.
He gave no explanation for the ban

on newsmen, except that it had "come
from Saigon."
Ninh reported his troops had
captured a North Vietnamese sergeant
and his interrogation revealed that
elements of Hanoi's Ist Division had
moved into the hills just inside
Cambodia.
Several villages at the foot of the
hills have been burned and hundreds
of Cambodian refugees fled into South
Vietnam.
Troop Withdrawal
Under the terms of the cease-fire
agreement, the United States, South
Vietnam, the Viet Cong and North
Vietnam are to end all military
operations in Cambodia and Laos and
withdraw troops from both countries.

/ cease-fire went into effect in
Lao on Feb. 22, but there has been
no truce agreement in Cambodia.
Th« United States and South
Vietnam charge that North
Vietnamese troops still are fighting
alongside native Khmer Rouge
insurgents, Cambodia's equivalent of
the Viet Cong.
The Communist side denies this.
Newsmen who reached the border
at Tinh Bien before the ban was
imposed saw armored personnel
carriers maneuvering across dried-up
rice paddies. They wheeled back and
forth across the frontier, crossing
about half a mile into Cambodia on
either side of Highway 2 which leads
to Phnom Penh.
