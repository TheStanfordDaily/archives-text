C.B. Morton has completed seven
weeks of radiation therapy for an
early-stage prostate malignancy at the
Medical Center and is expected to
return shortly to Washington, D.C.
Dr. Malcolm A. Bagshaw, chairman
of the department of radiology, said
that Morton responded well to the
therapy, noting that "There is every
reason to be optimistic about his
condition."

Morton was ambulatory during his
treatment, maintaining an office at the
U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park.
