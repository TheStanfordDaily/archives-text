# University Press Caters To Scholarly Interests
##

Would you like to read a good book? How about "Law
and Social Change in Zinacantan," or "The Genera of
Fishes?"
Both of these books have been published by the
Stanford University Press and are an indication of the
type of scholarly material that the Press publishes. One of
about 70 university presses in the United States, the
Stanford Press specializes in non-fiction books by
scholars.
In addition to its publishing duties, the Press does the
printing for the University; the university catalogue and a
wide variety of brochures are printed at the facility
located on campus at the corner of Panama and Lomita.
"We exist to serve the academy," says Leon Seltzer,
director of the Press. "The university presses, which also
call themselves 'scholarly publishers,' do 'things which in
commercial terms are absolutely uneconomical,' " he says.
Not Commercial
For example, the average printing of a Stanford Press
book will be around 2500, less than the comparable
average run for a commercial publisher. In addition, the
Press will frequently reprint 1000 copies of a book that is
only expected to sell 75 copies per year, according to
Seltzer, thus "tying up capital for 12 years." They do this
to meet the needs of scholars working in the field covered
by the book.

The Press only publishes about 30 new books a year.
By the time the book conies out, it has gone through a
long selection process. Seltzer estimates that the Press
annually receives 500-600 proposals, in the form of
manuscripts or outlines. Many of these proposals are
unsolicited.
Seltzer, Editor J.G. Bell and one executive editor go
over the manuscripts. Most of these they reject, not
necessarily because of poor quality, but because their
market appeal is extremely limited.
Appraisal Process
On the whole, says Bell, "we cannot simply
commission a money-making manuscript, because in the
end we have to have a manuscript that will get through
the scholarly appraisal process." After the Press has
expressed interest in a manuscript, it is sent to one or two
"readers" outside Stanford.
These are scholars recommended by Stanford faculty
members, who know something about a manuscript's field
and are in a position to judge the work's merit. If the
readers express approval, the manuscript is submitted to
an eight-person Stanford faculty committee for final
judging.
The function of the faculty committee is to "improve
the presentation" of the author. Bell says that, at the
outset of the book's existence, "lackluster writing is
perhaps pretty close to the norm."

Professors who publish via the scholarly press should
not anxiously await large financial reward because of the
limited market for scholarly books. "Royalties are paid,"
Bell says, "but authors would be unwise to expect to pay
their bills that way."
Scholarly Prestige
Still, there are reasons for a scholar to have his or her
work published by a university press. In many cases, a
commercial house simply will not print the limited
editions of books that the scholarly house will.
Thus, the scholar often has no choice; it is either a
university press or nothing. Being published by a
university press also offers prestige to the scholar.
Stanford professors cannot automatically have their
books published by the press. All manuscripts must be
approved by the same process. In addition, some Stanford
professors have contracts with other firms, for a variety of
reasons.
It is true, however, that some of the Stanford Press'
most prominent and successful titles have been authored
by Stanford professors. The list includes "The
Development of Sex Differences" edited by Psychology
Prof. Eleanor Maccoby. According to Bell, "it is selling
extremely well. A new edition is cpming out."
Subject Variety
The book offers an interesting example of the way in
which a scholarly publication may precede public interest

in an issue. Maccoby's book was copyrighted in 1966, b
didn't start selling well until 1970, after the attention
given to the women's movement.
The Press has also published the award-winning "The
Limits of the Criminal Sanction" by the late Law Prof.
Herbert L. Packer and a volume of ex-English Prof. H
Bruce Franklin's criticism of Herman Melville. The I'res
published, in 1959, the first biography of the blac
scholar W.E.B. Dußois.
Perhaps the most interesting book being planned for
future release is one that Seltzer calls "the definitive
biography of Captain Cook," which, he anticipates, will
appeal to the general public.
Financial Troubles
Never big money-makers, even in the years of the post
World War II education boom, university presses began to
run into financial trouble in the late 60's. Since 1967,
according to Seltzer, "the publishing situation has been
erratic. University presses have been no exception."
He says, "Almost all university presses are heavily
subsidized. This press for the most part has not been
subsidized," although it is temporarily receiving a $35,000
yearly subsidy from the University budget.
The Press takes in a total of $2,400,000 per year,
"which, with the subsidy, just about recovers its costs,"
he says. According to Seltzer, the Press is basically a
"break-even" proposition.

Seltzer, thus "tying up capital for 12 years." They do this
to meet the needs of scholars working in the field covered
by the book.

The Press only publishes about 30 new books a year.
By the time the book conies out, it has gone through a
long selection process. Seltzer estimates that the Press
annually receives 500-600 proposals, in the form of
manuscripts or outlines. Many of these proposals are
unsolicited.
Seltzer, Editor J.G. Bell and one executive editor go
over the manuscripts. Most of these they reject, not
necessarily because of poor quality, but because their
market appeal is extremely limited.
Appraisal Process
On the whole, says Bell, "we cannot simply
commission a money-making manuscript, because in the
end we have to have a manuscript that will get through
the scholarly appraisal process." After the Press has
expressed interest in a manuscript, it is sent to one or two
"readers" outside Stanford.
These are scholars recommended by Stanford faculty
members, who know something about a manuscript's field
and are in a position to judge the work's merit. If the
readers express approval, the manuscript is submitted to
an eight-person Stanford faculty committee for final
judging.
The function of the faculty committee is to "improve
the presentation" of the author. Bell says that, at the
outset of the book's existence, "lackluster writing is
perhaps pretty close to the norm."

Professors who publish via the scholarly press should
not anxiously await large financial reward because of the
limited market for scholarly books. "Royalties are paid,"
Bell says, "but authors would be unwise to expect to pay
their bills that way."
Scholarly Prestige
Still, there are reasons for a scholar to have his or her
work published by a university press. In many cases, a
commercial house simply will not print the limited
editions of books that the scholarly house will.
Thus, the scholar often has no choice; it is either a
university press or nothing. Being published by a
university press also offers prestige to the scholar.
Stanford professors cannot automatically have their
books published by the press. All manuscripts must be
approved by the same process. In addition, some Stanford
professors have contracts with other firms, for a variety of
reasons.
It is true, however, that some of the Stanford Press'
most prominent and successful titles have been authored
by Stanford professors. The list includes "The
Development of Sex Differences" edited by Psychology
Prof. Eleanor Maccoby. According to Bell, "it is selling
extremely well. A new edition is cpming out."
Subject Variety
The book offers an interesting example of the way in
which a scholarly publication may precede public interest

in an issue. Maccoby's book was copyrighted in 1966, b
didn't start selling well until 1970, after the attention
given to the women's movement.
The Press has also published the award-winning "The
Limits of the Criminal Sanction" by the late Law Prof.
Herbert L. Packer and a volume of ex-English Prof. H
Bruce Franklin's criticism of Herman Melville. The I'res
published, in 1959, the first biography of the blac
scholar W.E.B. Dußois.
Perhaps the most interesting book being planned for
future release is one that Seltzer calls "the definitive
biography of Captain Cook," which, he anticipates, will
appeal to the general public.
Financial Troubles
Never big money-makers, even in the years of the post
World War II education boom, university presses began to
run into financial trouble in the late 60's. Since 1967,
according to Seltzer, "the publishing situation has been
erratic. University presses have been no exception."
He says, "Almost all university presses are heavily
subsidized. This press for the most part has not been
subsidized," although it is temporarily receiving a $35,000
yearly subsidy from the University budget.
The Press takes in a total of $2,400,000 per year,
"which, with the subsidy, just about recovers its costs,"
he says. According to Seltzer, the Press is basically a
"break-even" proposition.
Would you like to read a good book? How about "Law
and Social Change in Zinacantan," or "The Genera of
Fishes?"
Both of these books have been published by the
Stanford University Press and are an indication of the
type of scholarly material that the Press publishes. One of
about 70 university presses in the United States, the
Stanford Press specializes in non-fiction books by
scholars.
In addition to its publishing duties, the Press does the
printing for the University; the university catalogue and a
wide variety of brochures are printed at the facility
located on campus at the corner of Panama and Lomita.
"We exist to serve the academy," says Leon Seltzer,
director of the Press. "The university presses, which also
call themselves 'scholarly publishers,' do 'things which in
commercial terms are absolutely uneconomical,' " he says.
Not Commercial
For example, the average printing of a Stanford Press
book will be around 2500, less than the comparable
average run for a commercial publisher. In addition, the
Press will frequently reprint 1000 copies of a book that is
only expected to sell 75 copies per year, according to
Seltzer, thus "tying up capital for 12 years." They do this

an eight-person Stanford faculty committee for final
judging.
The function of the faculty committee is to "improve
the presentation" of the author. Bell says that, at the
outset of the book's existence, "lackluster writing is
perhaps pretty close to the norm."

Professors who publish via the scholarly press should
not anxiously await large financial reward because of the
limited market for scholarly books. "Royalties are paid,"
Bell says, "but authors would be unwise to expect to pay
their bills that way."
Scholarly Prestige
Still, there are reasons for a scholar to have his or her
work published by a university press. In many cases, a
commercial house simply will not print the limited
editions of books that the scholarly house will.
Thus, the scholar often has no choice; it is either a
university press or nothing. Being published by a
university press also offers prestige to the scholar.
Stanford professors cannot automatically have their
books published by the press. All manuscripts must be
approved by the same process. In addition, some Stanford
professors have contracts with other firms, for a variety of
reasons.
It is true, however, that some of the Stanford Press'
most prominent and successful titles have been authored
by Stanford professors. The list includes "The
Development of Sex Differences" edited by Psychology
Prof. Eleanor Maccoby. According to Bell, "it is selling
extremely well. A new edition is cpming out."
Subject Variety
The book offers an interesting example of the way in
which a scholarly publication may precede public interest

in an issue. Maccoby's book was copyrighted in 1966, b
didn't start selling well until 1970, after the attention
given to the women's movement.
The Press has also published the award-winning "The
Limits of the Criminal Sanction" by the late Law Prof.
Herbert L. Packer and a volume of ex-English Prof. H
Bruce Franklin's criticism of Herman Melville. The I'res
published, in 1959, the first biography of the blac
scholar W.E.B. Dußois.
Perhaps the most interesting book being planned for
future release is one that Seltzer calls "the definitive
biography of Captain Cook," which, he anticipates, will
appeal to the general public.
Financial Troubles
Never big money-makers, even in the years of the post
World War II education boom, university presses began to
run into financial trouble in the late 60's. Since 1967,
according to Seltzer, "the publishing situation has been
erratic. University presses have been no exception."
He says, "Almost all university presses are heavily
subsidized. This press for the most part has not been
subsidized," although it is temporarily receiving a $35,000
yearly subsidy from the University budget.
The Press takes in a total of $2,400,000 per year,
"which, with the subsidy, just about recovers its costs,"
he says. According to Seltzer, the Press is basically a
"break-even" proposition.
Would you like to read a good book? How about "Law
and Social Change in Zinacantan," or "The Genera of
Fishes?"
Both of these books have been published by the
Stanford University Press and are an indication of the
type of scholarly material that the Press publishes. One of
about 70 university presses in the United States, the
Stanford Press specializes in non-fiction books by
scholars.
In addition to its publishing duties, the Press does the
printing for the University; the university catalogue and a
wide variety of brochures are printed at the facility
located on campus at the corner of Panama and Lomita.
"We exist to serve the academy," says Leon Seltzer,
director of the Press. "The university presses, which also
call themselves 'scholarly publishers,' do 'things which in
commercial terms are absolutely uneconomical,' " he says.
Not Commercial
For example, the average printing of a Stanford Press
book will be around 2500, less than the comparable
average run for a commercial publisher. In addition, the
Press will frequently reprint 1000 copies of a book that is
only expected to sell 75 copies per year, according to
Seltzer, thus "tying up capital for 12 years." They do this
to meet the needs of scholars working in the field covered
by the book.

The Press only publishes about 30 new books a year.
By the time the book conies out, it has gone through a
long selection process. Seltzer estimates that the Press
annually receives 500-600 proposals, in the form of
manuscripts or outlines. Many of these proposals are
unsolicited.
Seltzer, Editor J.G. Bell and one executive editor go
over the manuscripts. Most of these they reject, not
necessarily because of poor quality, but because their
market appeal is extremely limited.
Appraisal Process
On the whole, says Bell, "we cannot simply
commission a money-making manuscript, because in the
end we have to have a manuscript that will get through
the scholarly appraisal process." After the Press has
expressed interest in a manuscript, it is sent to one or two
"readers" outside Stanford.
These are scholars recommended by Stanford faculty
members, who know something about a manuscript's field
and are in a position to judge the work's merit. If the
readers express approval, the manuscript is submitted to
an eight-person Stanford faculty committee for final
judging.
The function of the faculty committee is to "improve
the presentation" of the author. Bell says that, at the
outset of the book's existence, "lackluster writing is
