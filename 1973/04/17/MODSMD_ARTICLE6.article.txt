## School Boards 
### 
This is election day for board members in the Palo Alto
Unified School District and the Foothill Community College
District. Both these districts include the student and faculty
housing areas of the campus as well as the city of Palo Alto.
For the Palo Alto Unified School District board, the
Daily recommends Rebecca Morgan. Unlike her opponent,
Morgan realizes that there is — and should be — more to
education today than the "three R's." The Palo Alto schools
are known throughout the nation for the large quantity and
high quality of their educational programs, and their
willingness to innovate and experiment. Morgan promises to
continue this trend; her opponent insists on curtailing it.
For the Foothill board, which operates DeAnza and
Foothill Colleges, the Daily recommends David F.
Moskowitz and Mary Lou Zoglin.
Moskowitz, a 23-year-old Foothill student, would bring
to the board a perspective it does not now have — that of a
young person and a student. Although the colleges serve
people of all ages, a majority of their students are young
adults and the opportunity to put such a "consumer" on the
governing board should not be passed by.
Moskowitz notes that the Foothill District colleges are
among the best such institutions in the nation, bur rightly
points out that that does not give their officials a mandate
to ignore the problems that do exist. He promises to attend
to those problems and help make these two colleges even
better places in which to learn.
Zoglin, a 12-year veteran of the board, is one of the
principal reasons that the two colleges are so outstanding.
She has been a leader in innovations that have made higher
education available to almost all adults in the North County
area. Rather than resting on her laurels, she appears
committed to tackling the problems and obstacles that face
the district with the same innovative spirit as in the past.
Fellow community college officials have recognized her
ability by electing her president of the California Junior
College Association as the first trustee ever to hold that
position.
