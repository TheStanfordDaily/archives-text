# Promises Kept
## Support KZSU 
### 
e Lloyd Snook

Last year at this time, when
KZSU was campaigning for our
current fee assessment, we
promised to use that money to
convert to stereo broadcasting and
higher power. We have kept those
promises: we will be stereo in
weeks, when a new transmitter
arrives, and our application for
higher power has been "accepted
for filing," meaning that it has
cleared the first, and largest,
hurdle in the way of approval. We

i could be broadcasting at 500
• watts (50 times our current
> power) within a month.
i The conversion to stereo and
I higher power cost about $22,000;
■ it is virtually complete. It was a
one-time expenditure, one that we
• will never need again.
• Unfortunately, however, keeping
the radio station on the air
requires that we ask for money
every year. We can't escape our
operating expenses of $19,000,

which is why KZSU is requesting
a refundable fee assessment of
two dollars — one dollar per
quarter per student for two
quarters. Students are now paying
one dollar per quarter for four
quarters, so we are asking for less
money next year than we are
receiving this year.
Where does KZSU spend
$19,000 a year? Almost none of
the money goes to salaries. Only
our business manager and a
secretary are paid. Almost all of
the money goes directly to pay
for the things that keep us on the
air — recording tape, transistors,
and records. As radio stations go,
KZSU is run on a shoestring.
Services
What does KZSU do for the
students? We have
up-to-the-minute coverage of local
stories 24 hours a day, which you
can't get anywhere else. From our
live coverage of the
demonstrations last spring to late
bulletins on the burning of the
Band Shack Saturday night,
KZSU News covers the campus.
Our Public Affairs Department
produces programs on local issues
and people — interviews, lectures
(such as John Kaplan's Law 107
this spring) and documentaries on
William Shockley or the fate of
Western Civ. We broadcast
programs dealing with local
minority problems — "Black Air,"
"Ondas Chicanas," "Out of the
Doll House." We carried all of the
home football and basketball
games, and important speeches
such as the SCOPE conference
were broadcast live.
Our disc jockeys play all kinds
of music — from classical and folk
to some of the hardest rock to be
found on the radio. Whatever
your musical taste, it can be
found on KZSU. And finally, we
give students a chance to learn
how radio works, regardless of
their prior experience.
Support
These are all services that we
are glad to be able to offer, but
they take money. We are a
non-commercial station, meaning
that we aren't allowed to
advertise. The source of revenue
for almost every other radio
station is unavailable to us. As a
result, KZSU must depend on the
support of the community we
serve: the Stanford community.
Without that support, the more
expensive aspects of our operation
— news and public affairs, in
particular — will be endangered.
We try to provide a public service,
but to do that we need your
support. Please vote "Yes" for
KZSU.

requires that we ask for money
every year. We can't escape our
operating expenses of $19,000,

which is why KZSU is requesting
a refundable fee assessment of
two dollars — one dollar per
quarter per student for two
quarters. Students are now paying
one dollar per quarter for four
quarters, so we are asking for less
money next year than we are
receiving this year.
Where does KZSU spend
$19,000 a year? Almost none of
the money goes to salaries. Only
our business manager and a
secretary are paid. Almost all of
the money goes directly to pay
for the things that keep us on the
air — recording tape, transistors,
and records. As radio stations go,
KZSU is run on a shoestring.
Services
What does KZSU do for the
students? We have
up-to-the-minute coverage of local
stories 24 hours a day, which you
can't get anywhere else. From our
live coverage of the
demonstrations last spring to late
bulletins on the burning of the
Band Shack Saturday night,
KZSU News covers the campus.
Our Public Affairs Department
produces programs on local issues
and people — interviews, lectures
(such as John Kaplan's Law 107
this spring) and documentaries on
William Shockley or the fate of
Western Civ. We broadcast
programs dealing with local
minority problems — "Black Air,"
"Ondas Chicanas," "Out of the
Doll House." We carried all of the
home football and basketball
games, and important speeches
such as the SCOPE conference
were broadcast live.
Our disc jockeys play all kinds
of music — from classical and folk
to some of the hardest rock to be
found on the radio. Whatever
your musical taste, it can be
found on KZSU. And finally, we
give students a chance to learn
how radio works, regardless of
their prior experience.
Support
These are all services that we
are glad to be able to offer, but
they take money. We are a
non-commercial station, meaning
that we aren't allowed to
advertise. The source of revenue
for almost every other radio
station is unavailable to us. As a
result, KZSU must depend on the
support of the community we
serve: the Stanford community.
Without that support, the more
expensive aspects of our operation
— news and public affairs, in
particular — will be endangered.
We try to provide a public service,
but to do that we need your
support. Please vote "Yes" for
KZSU.

Last year at this time, when
KZSU was campaigning for our
current fee assessment, we
promised to use that money to
convert to stereo broadcasting and
higher power. We have kept those
promises: we will be stereo in
weeks, when a new transmitter
arrives, and our application for
higher power has been "accepted
for filing," meaning that it has
cleared the first, and largest,
hurdle in the way of approval. We

i could be broadcasting at 500
• watts (50 times our current
> power) within a month.
i The conversion to stereo and
I higher power cost about $22,000;
■ it is virtually complete. It was a
one-time expenditure, one that we
• will never need again.
