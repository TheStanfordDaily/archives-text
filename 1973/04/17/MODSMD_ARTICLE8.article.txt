# Last Assessment
## Yes On Us

Ibs Charlie Hoffman

When most people heard that
the Daily was asking for a $1
refundable fee assessment for next
fall quarter, they asked, "Hey, I
thought the Daily was
independent. What are they doing
asking for money?"
It is true that after three years
of work and planning, we
achieved our legal independence
on Feb. 1 of this year. Full
financial independence cannot be
reached as quickly however.
The Daily has always been
highly dependent on student fee
assessment support. In the late
sixties, we received about $27,000
a year from students. Three years
ago, the Daily was in severe
financial trouble. Irresponsible
financial management and the
strain of putting out special issues
to cover demonstrations had
saddled us with a sizeable debt. It
was at this point that we began
seriously working for legal
independence and financial
security.
Support Ending
We hired business managers
from the Graduate School of
Business and published small
papers with a high percentage of
nds. We also increased our
requests for fee assessment
support and the students
responded. The Daily received
$35,800 in 1970-71 and $46,300
in 1971-72. We requested and
received $20,000 this year ($1 for
winter and spring quarters) and
have only asked for $10,000 next
year.
Our long range financial plan
calls for all student financial
support to be ended after the

coming year. So, barring financial
disaster, this $1 fee assessment
request will be our last. We will
continue to receive a University
subsidy for faculty and staff
subscriptions until 1974-75. After
that we will be financially
independent.
Our long range financial plan
dictates that student and
University support be phased out
and replaced with yearly increases
in advertising revenue. We have
been able to maintain this
schedule and are confident about
our financial future. It was
printed in the Daily as early as
last spring that we would ask for
one more dollar for 1973-74 as
part of our financial plan for
independence.
Through hard work and the
support of all segments of the
University community, we have
achieved legal independence. We
would appreciate your helping us
to take the last few steps to
complete financial independence.

The voluntary fee assessment
proposal does not affect the Daily
since we plan to phase out student
support after next year. But it
does pose a tremendous threat to
student organizations like KZSU
and the Band which depend on
fee assessments.
It is worth a few dollars a year
to keep these organizations alive.
Keep supporting student
organizations and defeat the
voluntary fee assessment proposal.

independent. What are they doing
asking for money?"
It is true that after three years
of work and planning, we
achieved our legal independence
on Feb. 1 of this year. Full
financial independence cannot be
reached as quickly however.
The Daily has always been
highly dependent on student fee
assessment support. In the late
sixties, we received about $27,000
a year from students. Three years
ago, the Daily was in severe
financial trouble. Irresponsible
financial management and the
strain of putting out special issues
to cover demonstrations had
saddled us with a sizeable debt. It
was at this point that we began
seriously working for legal
independence and financial
security.

We hired business managers
from the Graduate School of
Business and published small
papers with a high percentage of
nds. We also increased our
requests for fee assessment
support and the students
responded. The Daily received
$35,800 in 1970-71 and $46,300
in 1971-72. We requested and
received $20,000 this year ($1 for
winter and spring quarters) and
have only asked for $10,000 next
year.
Our long range financial plan
calls for all student financial
support to be ended after the

coming year. So, barring financial
disaster, this $1 fee assessment
request will be our last. We will
continue to receive a University
subsidy for faculty and staff
subscriptions until 1974-75. After
that we will be financially
independent.
Our long range financial plan
dictates that student and
University support be phased out
and replaced with yearly increases
in advertising revenue. We have
been able to maintain this
schedule and are confident about
our financial future. It was
printed in the Daily as early as
last spring that we would ask for
one more dollar for 1973-74 as
part of our financial plan for
independence.
Through hard work and the
support of all segments of the
University community, we have
achieved legal independence. We
would appreciate your helping us
to take the last few steps to
complete financial independence.

The voluntary fee assessment
proposal does not affect the Daily
since we plan to phase out student
support after next year. But it
does pose a tremendous threat to
student organizations like KZSU
and the Band which depend on
fee assessments.
It is worth a few dollars a year
to keep these organizations alive.
Keep supporting student
organizations and defeat the
voluntary fee assessment proposal.

When most people heard that
the Daily was asking for a $1
refundable fee assessment for next
fall quarter, they asked, "Hey, I
