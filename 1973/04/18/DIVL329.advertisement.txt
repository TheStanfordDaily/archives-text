I THE PSYCHOLOGY
OF CONSCIOUSNESS
by Robert E. Omstein
"This is an original and explosive book. It starts out
by making psychology, the science of the mind what it
actually is — as exciting and suspenseful as a good
mystery story. It goes on to create an important new
model of human consciousness, and human
possibilities, and ends by challenging each of us to
expand our concept of our world and ourselves. An
essential text for cultural transformation."
