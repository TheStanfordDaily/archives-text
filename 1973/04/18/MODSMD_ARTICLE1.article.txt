# Construction Starts In 1974
## New Engineering Center Planned 
### JIM WASCHER 
Plans for a $9.2 million engineering
center on campus were announced
yesterday by University President
Richard Lyman.
The center will be named for
Frederick E. Terman, vice president
and provost emeritus, and
construction is tentatively scheduled
to begin in summer 1974.
Principal donors to the center are
William R. Hewlett, David Packard and
their wives. Their gifts made in earlier
years combined with gifts and pledges
made to the Campaign for Stanford
will assure construction of the Terman
Center.
Hewlett is currently a member of
the Board of Trustees and Packard is a
former Board President. Both studied
under Terman while they were
students here.
The Terman Center will be located
at the corner of Panama and Lomita
Streets, across Panama from the
Durand Aeronautics and Astronautics
Building and across Lomita from the
University Press. The site is currently
occupied by a parking lot and an earth
sciences laboratory.
The building will include
administrative offices for the School
of Engineering and will allow
consolidation of scattered departments
within the school. The site will place
the Center in close proximity to the
School's several buildings.
Will Consolidate Functions
William M. Kays, dean of the
school, commented that "the Terman
center, by consolidating functions
presently dispersed throughout the
campus, will permit our faculty and
students to blend their talents and
their work more effectively than has
ever before been possible."
According to Associate Engineering
Dean Lauress L. Wise, the School's
various departments have "been spread
all over campus." He said that the
Terman Center will allow the School
"to be more interactive between
disciplines." However, Wise said that
the new building "really won't add

much more space to engineering."
Space presently occupied by
engineering on the Quad will be used
by departments in the School of
Humanities and Sciences after the
center is built.
Hewlett, Packard Statement
In a joint statement released
yesterday, Hewlett and Packard said
they were "extremely pleased to be
able to participate in the establishment
of the Terman Center.
"Over the span of nearly a
half-century, Professor Terman has
made immense contributions to
Stanford, to higher education, and to

the engineering profession.
"It is largely through his untiring
efforts that the University's School of
Engineering today ranks among the
best in the world. We believe the new
Terman Center will reflect his high
standards of excellence and be a
source of inspiration to future
generations of faculty and students."
'Unbelievably Nice'
Contacted last night, Terman said
"if you take an interest in your
students over the years, some of the
nicest things can happen." He added
that "this is just unbelievably nice."
Son of the distinguished

psychology professor, Lewis M.
Terman, Frederick Terman joined the
faculty here as an electrical
engineering instructor in 1925. He was
named executive head of the
Department of Electrical Engineering
and dean of the School of Engineering
in 1944.
Terman was appointed University
Provost in 1955 and Vice President in
1959, holding both posts until his
retirement in 1965. He was elected a
member of the National Academy of
Sciences and was a founding member
of the National Academy of
Engineering.

ALL WASHED UP — One squirt squirts another at Saturday night's Band Shak blaze. Firefighters at the scene
concentrated on containing the fire. Since nobody remembered to bring the marshmallows, a brief dousing appears to
have been the next best way to have a hot time.
