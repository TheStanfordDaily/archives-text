# Adherence Of Critical Importance
## On The Honor Code 
### 
Gerald Af. Halligan

In 1921, Stanford students'
deeply-felt resentment of the
proctorial examination system
spurred the adoption of the
Honor Code by the Academic
Council. Veterans returned from
the war in Europe demanded that
emphasis be placed on individual
integrity, and approximately 1700
students submitted individual
written requests asking that the
Honor Code be adopted. The
adoption of the code transferred
responsibility for the proper
conduct of examinations from the

instructors to the studentsâ€”where
the responsibility remains today.
In March 1973, the Campus
Judicial Panel had its first
opportunity to address the issue
of sanctions for Honor Code
violations. In a guideline decision,
the CJP considered the seriousness
of violations of the code and
concluded that the normal
penalty for such violations should
be suspension from the University
for one academic quarter.
The decision was based on the
recognition that an atmosphere of

trust in the honesty and integrity
of teachers and learners is a
necessity, not a luxury, in an
academic community. Otherwise,
suspicion and doubt would
intrude deeply into the process of
free inquiry and true scholarship.
The CJP also observed that
academic dishonesty threatens the
integrity of the Univesity's
grading system and the value of
the degrees and other academic
credentials awarded the vast
majority of honest students.
Procedure
The President's Office initially
examines possible violations of
the Honor Code. Any student or
faculty member who has reason to
believe that a violation of the
code may have occurred should
contact Gerald Halligan, Assistant
Staff Counsel to the President,
University extension 4625. If it
appears that a violation has
occurred, the President's Office
will bring the case to the attention
of the CJP according to the
regulations of the judicial system
adopted in November 1971. The
University Administration, not
the reporting instructor or
student, will become the
complaining party and will pursue
the case to completion.
As an alternative to a CJP
hearing, any student disciplinary
cai>e may be heard by the Dean of
Student Affairs if a student so
requests and the Dean agrees.
Hearings before the Dean are
informal; his decisions and
recommendations are based solely
on his discretion instead of the
standard of "beyond a reasonable
doubt" used in hearings under the
CJP.
In cases heard by the CJP, as
distinct from those heard by the
Dean of Student Affairs, a student
defendant has the opportunity to
be represented by counsel, to have
a public hearing, to present
witnesses in his defense, and to
confront and cross-examine
witnesses against him.
Judicial
Honor code offenses (as with
other violations of rules of
student conduct) must be
processed through the University's
judicial system. Thus only the CJP
or the Dean of Student Affairs,
with the consent of the instructor,
may deprive a student of credit
for a course or lower a student's
grade solely because of a belief
that the student has violated the
Honor Code. That is not to say,
however, that an instructor may
not lower a grade or refuse credit
in a course if a student has not
done acceptable required course
work aside from Honor Code
questions.
While student disciplinary
matters handled by the CJP or the
Dean of Student Affairs are kept
confidential at the option of
student defendants, the decisions
are published after deletions of
material which would identify the

students involved.
Effectiveness of the Honor
Code is not assured solely by
publication of instances of its
enforcement; participation of
instructors and students is
essential. As a constant reminder
of this, each student who submits
an examination in a bluebook is
expected to certify in writing on
the cover that he will neither
receive nor give unpermitted aid
on the examination and that he
will report, to the best of his
ability, all Honor Code violations
he observes.
Adherence to the Honor Code
is of critical importance. The
restrictions and suspicions
inherent in the alternative
proctorial system would clearly
undermine the conditions of trust
and integrity which are essential
to optimum academic
performance at this University. It
is therefore hoped that this
publication of the appropriate
procedures together with the
result of the recent decision by
the CJP will serve to strengthen
the entire community's
commitment to the Honor Code.

staff counsel to the president.)
