Ah, France
Editor:
I would like to respond to
Lloyd Snook's article (Daily,
April 12) in support of the
recommendation to move the
French overseas campus 10 Paris.
It is one thing to argue mat there
are more cultural activities
available in Paris. It is quite
another to say that Paris and
France are one and the same or
that Paris is even representative of
French culture or spirit.
Snook states that the "Gallic
Character" is "not only urban but
explicitly and joyously Parisian."
To make this statement is to
ignore hundreds of years of
French history. France for many
years was almost totally a rural
society. Due to underpopulation
in the country, the French people
faced no pressure to move to the
cities. Thus urbanization in
France came much later than in
most of its European neighbors.
In spite of this shift in
population a disproportionate
amount of political control has
been left to the rural leaders in
the French Senate. Although
France may now be termed an
industrialized nation, the rural
personality that has traditionally
characterized the French people
cannot be discounted.
It is true that the government
bureaucracy is centered in Paris
and that the French government
has been engaged in efforts to
decentralize. This, however, only
shows that the administrative seat
in France is centered in Paris—and
says nothing of the French
character. Provincial sentiment
remains strong in France. Many
provincial Frenchmen share a
certain resentment of the
influence that Paris exerts on the
rest of France. These Frenchmen
would vehemently object to many
generalizations that group them
indiscriminately with Parisians
and especially to the notion
"Paris, c'est la France; la France,
c'est Paris."
In order to understand the
character of France and her
people one must be aware of the
existence and sometimes
opposition of the Parisian and
provincial life styles. The idea
that, by knowing Paris, somehow
one has a total insight into French
life is simply erroneous. It must
be understood that a decision to
move the Tours campus to Paris is
simply a substitution of one part
of French culture for another.

The Statue
Editor:
The year 1899 saw the
completion of a bronze statue of
the Leland Stanford family by the
scuptor Larkin G. Mead.
For several years it has stood,
hidden and almost forgotten, in
• the shadows on the veranda of the
Stanford Art Gallery. It should be
placed in a more conspicuous
location on campus, for all eyes to
see.
An ideal location would be
between the pillars at the entrance
to the quad, or in the courtyard in
front of Memorial Church.
Perhaps others might have other
suggestions.
