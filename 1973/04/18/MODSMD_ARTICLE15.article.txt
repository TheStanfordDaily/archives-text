# Three Programs On Women Offered
## 
### 
Three spring quarter programs
focused on women will give
students and the University
community the opportunity to
discuss alternative ideas and life
styles.
The newly created Women's
Studies Research Institute
(WSRI) is sponsoring a noontime
lecture series which will feature
Stanford faculty and Bay Area
women involved in research
related to women's roles.
Jointly sponsored by the
Career Planning and Placement
Center and the WSRI, a two -day
program on women in the
professions is scheduled Apr.
26-27. Its theme will be "Focus
on Women: New Voices of the
705."
"Latin American Women and
the Chicana: The Theory and
Practice of Women's Liberation"
will be the subject of another
conference, May 12-13.
The noon lecture series will
open Thursday with Michele A.
Rosaldo, assistant professor of
anthropology, in room 58 of the
Graduate School of Business,
discussing "Women, Culture, and
Society."
Future Programs
Subsequent programs will be
Apr. 19, "Women's Art: A Slide
Show Presentation," with J.J.
Wilson and Karen Petersen,
Department of English, Stanislaus
State; May 3, "Sex Differences,"

Research In Women's Roles
The Women's Studies Research
Institute has been organized by a
group of Stanford women faculty
and students who are interested in
research related to women's roles.
"We want to introduce the idea
of women's studies at Stanford by
showing the progress to date,"
explains Dorothy McNoble, senior
in anthropology.
Myra Strober, assistant
professor of economics in the
Graduate School of Business,
expects that the lecture series will
demonstrate a widespread interest
on campus in such academic
analysis and will suggest the
possibilities for interdisciplinary
research.
Much Interest
"We think there is a lot of
interest among both faculty and
students, but there hasn't been a
way for people to get together.
The whole women's research area
is a very fertile one, and we hope
the lecture series will encourage
people to investigate the
possibilities," Strober comments.
"Focus on Women: New
Voices in the 70s" will begin
Thursday afternoon, Apr. 26,
with a panel discussing the impact
of working women on the
country's economy. Scheduled
participants include women in
medicine, law engineering,
education, and business.
That evening, another panel
will discuss women "Merging
Lifestyle and Career." The nine
panelists will include a
professional single woman, several
working couples who have
developed different methods of
joining two careers, and a woman
involved in volunteer work.
Panels on Friday will discuss
women in management, the
ministry, psychiatric social work,
and in communications and the
media.
