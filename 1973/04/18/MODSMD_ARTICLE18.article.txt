# U.S. Automakers Trail Japanese
## Low-Pollution Engine Sought 
### 
DETROIT (AP) - U.S. auto
makers who have won a one-year
extension on meeting the 1975
exhaust emissions requirement
still face a question prompted by
their Japanese competitors:
Why can't Detroit with all its
technological muscle cut down
on auto pollution as quickly as
Japanese auto makers?
Basically, all four American
companies contend the
technology does not exist to
enable them to meet the
controversial standards on a full
production basis over the period
of durability testing—so,ooo
miles. And if the technology was
developed in time, it would cost
the car buyer an exorbitatnt
amount—hundred of dollars extra
for a new car and more hundreds
on later maintenance, according
to American Motors Board
Chairman Roy D. Chapin Jr.
Ford officials have said costs
would rise $300 a car,, with no
profits.
But Toyo Kogyo—the maker of
the Wankel-powered Mazda—and
Honda, both of Japan, say they
can meet the stadards, even by
1975. A Honda official said his
company's engine could be
mass-produced by any auto maker
and "would prove to be applicable
to large engines in the near
future."
Not Easy With V-B's
American companies dispute
the idea that meeting the
standards with their big V-B's is as
easy as with the little rotary and
Honda engines. And producing
emission-free engines in the
quantity demanded by the

American consumer is another
problem.
While some critics have blasted
the industry for not coming closer
to the emission standards,
company reports indicate a huge
amount of money and manpower
spent on meeting the
requirements.
General Motors has reported
spending or planning to spend $2
billion to meet the standards—in
engineering, tooling, research and
development, not including the
price of devices or parts for cars.
Method Questioned
That the American companies
are expending great resources in
attempting to meet the standards
is not questionable. The method
being used has been.
All four domestic companies
are committed to the use of
catalytic converters—a device for
precipitating pollutants out of
auto exhaust. Other companies
plan to use different methods, and
of those in use the National
Academy of Science rated
catalytic converters as one of the
worst.
It suggested if American
companies use the converters it
might be a long time before they
switch to "superior" nonpiston
systems.
The problem with emissions
almost certainly was the impetus
which propelled Detroit into its
first large-scale development of
alternative power plants in
industry history, according to
industry observers.
Chrysler Hasn't Moved
The impact of the Wankel
rotary engine and the sales figures

have a financial stake in producing
rotary-engine cars in this decade.
All but Chrysler have taken steps
to secure the engine.
General Motors plans to put
rotary engines into its Vega
subcompact by 1975. American
Motors will put the engine in its
Gremlin about the same time.
But because of massive
changeover and technical
problems the switch won't be
easy. GM has revealed its rotary
has problems to be ironed out,
especially for large-scale
production.
Why The Wait?
Why has Detroit waited until
the 1970s to develop an
alternative powerplant to the
piston engine?
The answer is a combination of
financial and technological
considerations, according to
Richard Wright, engineering editor
of the Automotive News.
While domestic companies have
long examined such sources of
power as steam, electric, turbine
and diesel engines, all have been
too expensive, technically
undesirable or both, Wright said
recently.
Realism Needed
"I don't thnk Detroit has been
dragging its feet," Wright said.
"Detroit has always kept its eye
on realistic proposals. But the
emphasis is a little different here
than overseas."
The availability of large
amounts of fuel and the
popularity of large engines, tuned
slightly below maximum
performance—com;'emented by
foreign autos getting more
power than smaller engines—has
until now made it easier and
cheaper to produce piston engines
than to retool and produce a new
engine.
The combination of
government regulations and
consumer demand forcing a trend
toward smaller cars, the economic
threat from the Mazda and the
emission advantage of the rotary
engine "tipped the scales" finally
to production of another type of
engine, Wright said.

the late 1950s he invented an engine "substantially the same" as the newly-announced Japanese Honda

Detroit automakers in the engine, however, and turned over all his patents on it to Stanford.

almost certainly was the impetus
which propelled Detroit into its
first large-scale development of
alternative power plants in
industry history, according to
industry observers.
Chrysler Hasn't Moved
The impact of the Wankel
rotary engine and the sales figures

have a financial stake in producing
rotary-engine cars in this decade.
All but Chrysler have taken steps
to secure the engine.
General Motors plans to put
rotary engines into its Vega
subcompact by 1975. American
Motors will put the engine in its
Gremlin about the same time.
But because of massive
changeover and technical
problems the switch won't be
easy. GM has revealed its rotary
has problems to be ironed out,
especially for large-scale
production.
Why The Wait?
Why has Detroit waited until
the 1970s to develop an
alternative powerplant to the
piston engine?
The answer is a combination of
financial and technological
considerations, according to
Richard Wright, engineering editor
of the Automotive News.
While domestic companies have
long examined such sources of
power as steam, electric, turbine
and diesel engines, all have been
too expensive, technically
undesirable or both, Wright said
recently.
Realism Needed
"I don't thnk Detroit has been
dragging its feet," Wright said.
"Detroit has always kept its eye
on realistic proposals. But the
emphasis is a little different here
than overseas."
The availability of large
amounts of fuel and the
popularity of large engines, tuned
slightly below maximum
performance—com;'emented by
foreign autos getting more
power than smaller engines—has
until now made it easier and
cheaper to produce piston engines
than to retool and produce a new
engine.
The combination of
government regulations and
consumer demand forcing a trend
toward smaller cars, the economic
threat from the Mazda and the
emission advantage of the rotary
engine "tipped the scales" finally
to production of another type of
engine, Wright said.

ANOTHER ALTERNATIVE—Engineer-inventor Ralph Heintz (center) a Stanford alumnus, says that in
the late 1950s he invented an engine "substantially the same" as the newly-announced Japanese Honda
engine (see story below). Heintz, showing the engine to Prof. A. Louis London (right), could not interest
Detroit automakers in the engine, however, and turned over all his patents on it to Stanford.
DETROIT (AP) - U.S. auto
makers who have won a one-year
extension on meeting the 1975
exhaust emissions requirement
still face a question prompted by
their Japanese competitors:
Why can't Detroit with all its
technological muscle cut down
on auto pollution as quickly as
Japanese auto makers?
Basically, all four American
companies contend the
technology does not exist to
enable them to meet the
controversial standards on a full
production basis over the period
of durability testing—so,ooo
miles. And if the technology was
developed in time, it would cost
the car buyer an exorbitatnt
amount—hundred of dollars extra
for a new car and more hundreds
on later maintenance, according
to American Motors Board
Chairman Roy D. Chapin Jr.
Ford officials have said costs
would rise $300 a car,, with no
profits.
But Toyo Kogyo—the maker of
the Wankel-powered Mazda—and
Honda, both of Japan, say they
can meet the stadards, even by
1975. A Honda official said his
company's engine could be
mass-produced by any auto maker
and "would prove to be applicable
to large engines in the near
future."
Not Easy With V-B's
American companies dispute
the idea that meeting the
standards with their big V-B's is as
easy as with the little rotary and
Honda engines. And producing
emission-free engines in the
quantity demanded by the

American consumer is another
problem.
While some critics have blasted
the industry for not coming closer
to the emission standards,
company reports indicate a huge
amount of money and manpower
spent on meeting the
requirements.
General Motors has reported
spending or planning to spend $2
billion to meet the standards—in
engineering, tooling, research and
development, not including the
price of devices or parts for cars.
Method Questioned
That the American companies
are expending great resources in
attempting to meet the standards
is not questionable. The method
being used has been.
All four domestic companies
are committed to the use of
catalytic converters—a device for
precipitating pollutants out of
auto exhaust. Other companies
plan to use different methods, and
of those in use the National
Academy of Science rated
catalytic converters as one of the
worst.
It suggested if American
companies use the converters it
might be a long time before they
switch to "superior" nonpiston
systems.

still face a question prompted by
their Japanese competitors:
Why can't Detroit with all its
technological muscle cut down
on auto pollution as quickly as
Japanese auto makers?
Basically, all four American
companies contend the
technology does not exist to
enable them to meet the
controversial standards on a full
production basis over the period
of durability testing—so,ooo
miles. And if the technology was
developed in time, it would cost
the car buyer an exorbitatnt
amount—hundred of dollars extra
for a new car and more hundreds
on later maintenance, according
to American Motors Board
Chairman Roy D. Chapin Jr.
Ford officials have said costs
would rise $300 a car,, with no
profits.
But Toyo Kogyo—the maker of
the Wankel-powered Mazda—and
Honda, both of Japan, say they
can meet the stadards, even by
1975. A Honda official said his
company's engine could be
mass-produced by any auto maker
and "would prove to be applicable
to large engines in the near
future."
Not Easy With V-B's
American companies dispute
the idea that meeting the
standards with their big V-B's is as
easy as with the little rotary and
Honda engines. And producing
emission-free engines in the
quantity demanded by the

American consumer is another
problem.
While some critics have blasted
the industry for not coming closer
to the emission standards,
company reports indicate a huge
amount of money and manpower
spent on meeting the
requirements.
General Motors has reported
spending or planning to spend $2
billion to meet the standards—in
engineering, tooling, research and
development, not including the
price of devices or parts for cars.
Method Questioned
That the American companies
are expending great resources in
attempting to meet the standards
is not questionable. The method
being used has been.
All four domestic companies
are committed to the use of
catalytic converters—a device for
precipitating pollutants out of
auto exhaust. Other companies
plan to use different methods, and
of those in use the National
Academy of Science rated
catalytic converters as one of the
worst.
It suggested if American
companies use the converters it
might be a long time before they
switch to "superior" nonpiston
systems.
The problem with emissions
almost certainly was the impetus
which propelled Detroit into its
first large-scale development of
alternative power plants in
industry history, according to
industry observers.
Chrysler Hasn't Moved
The impact of the Wankel
rotary engine and the sales figures

have a financial stake in producing
rotary-engine cars in this decade.
All but Chrysler have taken steps
to secure the engine.
General Motors plans to put
rotary engines into its Vega
subcompact by 1975. American
Motors will put the engine in its
Gremlin about the same time.
But because of massive
changeover and technical
problems the switch won't be
easy. GM has revealed its rotary
has problems to be ironed out,
especially for large-scale
production.
Why The Wait?
Why has Detroit waited until
the 1970s to develop an
alternative powerplant to the
piston engine?
The answer is a combination of
financial and technological
considerations, according to
Richard Wright, engineering editor
of the Automotive News.
While domestic companies have
long examined such sources of
power as steam, electric, turbine
and diesel engines, all have been
too expensive, technically
undesirable or both, Wright said
recently.
Realism Needed
"I don't thnk Detroit has been
dragging its feet," Wright said.
"Detroit has always kept its eye
on realistic proposals. But the
emphasis is a little different here
than overseas."
The availability of large
amounts of fuel and the
popularity of large engines, tuned
slightly below maximum
performance—com;'emented by
foreign autos getting more
power than smaller engines—has
until now made it easier and
cheaper to produce piston engines
than to retool and produce a new
engine.
The combination of
government regulations and
consumer demand forcing a trend
toward smaller cars, the economic
threat from the Mazda and the
emission advantage of the rotary
engine "tipped the scales" finally
to production of another type of
engine, Wright said.

ANOTHER ALTERNATIVE—Engineer-inventor Ralph Heintz (center) a Stanford alumnus, says that in
the late 1950s he invented an engine "substantially the same" as the newly-announced Japanese Honda
engine (see story below). Heintz, showing the engine to Prof. A. Louis London (right), could not interest
Detroit automakers in the engine, however, and turned over all his patents on it to Stanford.
