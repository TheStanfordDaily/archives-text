# ASSU Balloting To Begin Today
## 
### SUE KING 
Students may vote at any one of six
polls in today and tomorrow's ASSU
presidential election, Elections
Commissioner Mike Nilsson has
announced.
The Engineering corner and Post
Office polls will be open from 10 a.m.
until 4 p.m. and polls at the School of
Business, History corner, Medical
School and Physics Tank will be in
operation between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m.
Five slates are running for the
ASSU Council of Presidents. They are:
—Judy Gans and Buzz Thompson;
—Kevin O'Grady, Beth Garfield,
Charles Ogletree, and Jim Friend;
- Peter Van Petten, Jim Anderson,
Tom Flohr, and Charles "Buck"
Schott;
—Fred Choate and Ed Ryu; and
Robert Carlos Garcia and Dave
Meyer.
Other Measures
Other measures on the ballot
include six ASSU Constitutional
amendments and five refundable fee
assessments.
The proposed amendments would
- make fee assessments voluntary

rather than refundable;
—strengthen the veto power of the
ASSU President;
—create a commission with final
authority to interpret the ASSU
Constitution;
- necessitate a 20 percent voter
turnout for a fee assessment election
before the election results become
valid;
—set the date of the Program Fee
assessment election so it would
coincide with the presidential election;
and
—clarify ASSU financial operations.
Fee Assessments
The Daily and the Stanford Legal
Counseling Office are requesting a $1
assessment for autumn quarter, while
students will be asked to approve $1
assessments autumn and winter
quarters for the Band, KZSU and the
ASSU Program fee.
In special additions to the ballot,
the class of 1974 will be asked to vote
for a Senior Class Council of
Presidents, and the class of 1973 will
select two professors to give brief
addresses to the senior class on
Graduation Weekend.

Final election results will not be
available until all ballots have been
returned from the overseas campuses,
according to Elections Commissioner
Mike Nilsson.
Med School Poll
At an ASSU Senate meeting Nilsson
proposed that the polling station at
the Medical School remain open only
from noon until 1 p.m. According to
Nilsson, this time change would save
money, as only a few people have
voted at the Medical School poll in
previous elections.
O'Grady, who is a medical student,
asked that the hours remain as they
were originally, from 10 a.m. until 2
p.m. Nilsson complied with the
request, explaining that it would be
unfair to O'Grady to close the Medical
School poll early.
Nilsson says that he will submit the
change to the Senate for approval after
the election.
A Stanford ID card showing that
the student is registered for spring
quarter will be needed to vote.
No electioneering or campaigning
will be allowed within 100 feet of a
polling station.
