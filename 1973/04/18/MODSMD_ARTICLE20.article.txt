## Hicks, Hot Licks Steal Show 
### DAN FORTE 
On the way to Winterland last Saturday
night, a friend of mine asked me, "Have you
ever heard of Mason Proffit?"
"No, but I bet they get a standing ovation
and come back for an encore."
This has come to be a standard at nearly all
rock concert halls, especially Winterland. Who
you are, or how good your music is, doesn't
seem to matter as long as you "boogie."
Mason Proffit's group was no exception. 1
think this was the band's first gig since leaving
their garage in Bakersfield. This country-rock
septet was for the most part just very
unoriginal.
My definition of a second-rate group is any
band whose finale number is "Bo Diddley."
Guess what Mason Proffit closed his set with
Saturday night.
For their encore, the group did a too-fast
version of Earl Scruggs' "Foggy Mountain
Breakdown." The banjo player and fiddler
were both good, but made the mistake most
banjo and fiddle players make of trying to
play as fast as they can, which isn't always the
best way to show off.
Hicks Enters
This rough, amateur-ish band was followed
by the polished and tasteful Dan Hicks and his
Hot Licks.
Despite the cynical, tongue-in-cheek humor
which characterizes the Hot Licks, the group
consists of some very serious, dedicated
musicians. Their sound ranges from Swing to
country, but it all has a definite nostalgic
quality to it.
Their set included many Dan Hicks
favorites, such as: "Evening Breeze," with
some nice Andrews Sisters-type harmonies by
the Lickettes, Naomi "Miami" Eisenberg and
Maryann Price; "By Hook Or By Crook,"

which featured a phenomenal solo by violinist
"Symphony Sid" Page; the country-flavored
"How Can I Miss You (When You Won't Go
Away);" "I'm An Old Cowhand," sung by
Maryann; "Where's The Money?;" and their
all-time-biggie, "Milkshakin' Mama."
They closed with the moody "I Scare
Myself" with "Johnny Guitar" Girton on
flute. They were then brought back (twice)
for encores; first "I Feel Like Singing" and
then "Shorty Falls In Love."
The remainder of the group consisted of
Jaime Leopold (a.k.a. "Skippy Sanchez") on
string bass, Hicks on acoustic rhythm guitar,
and a drummer.
In my own biased opinion, they definitely
stole the show. Dan Hicks is always a hard act
to follow.
Hard-Rock Kinks
The last time I saw the Kinks must've been
on "Shindig" or "Hullabaloo" doing
something like 'Tired Of Waiting For You."
Since then they have gone through some
personnel and musical changes, but basically
they are still the same big beat, hard rock
band.
Their present line-up includes Ray Davies
(lead vocal, rhythm guitar, and harmonica),
Dave Davies (lead guitar), John Gosling (piano
and organ), Mick Avory (drums), and John
Dalton (bass).
They took the stage at Winterland still
looking very Mod-ish, almost like in the old
days. Ray Davies was wearing a white suit and
a black velvet bow-tie.
They got right under way with one of their
bigger hits in recent years, "Victoria." Ray
Davies moves around a lot somewhat like
Mick Jagger, and sometimes picks up a guitar
and pretends to be really working out, but
actually he's not much of a musician at all.

For that matter, none of the members are
what you'd call virtuosos, but then they don't
try to be either. Most of their set alternated
between fast numbers emphasizing the beat,
and softer ballad-type songs.
Good Ballad
One of their better songs of the latter type
was "Celluloid Heroes" from their newest LP,
"Everybody's In Showbiz." Some of their
other songs were "Alcohol" and "Acute
Schizophrenia Paranoia Blues" (both from
their "Muswell Hillbilly" album), and a couple
of their earlier hits, "Til The End Of The
Day"and "Lola."
During "Alcohol," Ray Davies threw about
a case of beer, one can at a time, into the
audiece. Be prepared for that if you should
ever see them in person.
About three fourths of the way through
the set, things seemed to be dragging a little,
so the Kinks ended with two old rock 'n' roll
numbers. First was a medley of "Dry Bones"
and "Rock Around The Clock;" then Dave
Davies sang "Good Golly Miss Molly."
Old-Time Hit
After much applause, the Kinks came back
and broke into their first hit ever, "You
Really Got Me." Aaargh!! A huge, junior high,
David Cassady fan-scream arose from the
audience. It was almost as if the Beatles were
back together and did "I Want To Hold Your
Hand" for an encore.
This shifted into the Kinks' second hit,
"All Day And All Night," which wasn't hard
to since the two songs are nearly identical.
These two were my favorites of the Kinks'
set. Although I liked many of their newer, I
still don't think they've ever surpassed their
earlier numbers. But, as I said, they're still
basically the same type of band, and still have
the potential to put out more good hard rock.
