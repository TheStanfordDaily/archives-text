# 'Incredibles' Exhibit Stylistic Diversity
## 
### JAY HARLOW 
"Incredible" is an overworked
adjective, and I am probably one
of the worst offenders. However,
the Incredible String Band is such
a diverse combination of musical
and performance styles that it
seems somehow beyond belief.
Last weekend, I was fortunate
enough to hear them at the Palace
of Fine Arts Theater in San
Francisco, and to interview Robin
Williamson, one of the founders
of the band.
Williamson played fiddle in a
folk duo with Clive Palmer in
Scotland in 1965, and the two
were later joined by guitarist Mike
Heron and formed the Incredible
String Band. Palmer left the group
after their first album, and Robin
and Mike went on together, later
joined by two female singers.
During this time, their music was
a loosely woven tapestry of
Eastern and Western styles and
instruments.
In 1969, the Incredibles went
on a short tour with a mime
troupe called Stone Monkey, One
of the mimes, Malcolm LeMaestre,
joined the band a year or so later
as both mime and musician. The
most recent addition to the band
was Gerard Dott, a Scottish jazz
musician who had known both
Mike and Robin before they knew
one another.
Background Variety
Saturday's show reflected this
variety of background. Robin,
Mike, Malcolm, and Gerard moved
around freely between
instruments and styles, with help
from "Stanley-the-roadie," their

technical director, on bass, and a
drummer. Most of their music is
currently played on Western
instruments, and is generally
intended to be less exotic and
"more accessible," according to
Robin.
They opened with Robin on
fiddle, Mike on guitar, Malcolm
on mandolin, and Gerard on
clarinet, with a British folk tune.
This was the sort of traditional
music from which descended most
Appalachian folk music of this
country.
Robin also played flute, organ,
and acoustic guitar from time to
time. "Saturday Maybe" was a
nice, quiet song about a girl he
knew in Edinburgh. One of his
later songs was a long story,
"Giles Crocodile," to which
Malcolm did a dance-pantomime
melodrama about (you guessed it)
a crocodile.
Malcolm is also a singer and a
songwriter, and the band played
several of his songs, including "My
Father Was a Lighthouse Keeper."
This one featured some good rock
guitar by Mike, who has recorded
a solo album, "Smiling Men With
Bad Reputations."
Anecdotes
In addition to singing, dancing,
and imitating the rhythm section of
a circus band on "Circus Girl,"
Malcolm filled the tuning breaks
with anecdotes about his father,
TV commercials in L.A., and
various other spontaneous topics.
Gerard joined on clarinet, sax,
organ, and banjo, and while
Malcolm changed for the mime
number, filled in with a couple of

Scott Joplin piano rags. Mike was
similarly variable, playing guitars,
bass, and piano, including one
beautiful song, "Maker of
Islands."
The band's finale was a medley
of fiddle tunes and Irish folk
songs. The instrumentation was
that of a traditional American
bluegrass band—fiddle, guitar,
banjo, mandolin, and bass.
This shows an interesting
history: folk music from the
British Isles was preserved in the
Appalachians, and with the advent
of the banjo, an Afro-American
instrument, the present bluegrass
band was born. Robin invited the
audience to get up and dance to
this one, and in spite of the
theater seats, many did.
Eclectic Musician
The Incredibles were preceded
by guitarist Robbie Basho, a
similarly eclectic musician whose
music reflects both American folk
music and Eastern music, and
some American Indian influences
as well.
He was followed by Uncle
Vinty, a local performer. Uncle
Vinty is a bearded, wild-haired
singer and pianist whose show
consists of sing-alongs, crazy
costumes, a dramatization of
"Little Miss Muffet," and other
delightful madness. He was an
excellent introduction for the
Incredible String Band, whose
music—sometimes whimsical,
sometimes serious, sometimes
beautiful, sometimes quiet,
sometimes good solid rock—made
for one of the most enjoyable
concerts I have heard.
