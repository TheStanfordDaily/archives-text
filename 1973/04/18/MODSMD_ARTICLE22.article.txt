SUNSEED
Directed by Fredrick Cohn
Produced by Ralph Harper Silver
New Age Films
"Sunseed" provides a unique
opportunity to participate and
experience in depth many
different paths of Eastern spiritual
realization currently being
practiced by American young
people today. More than eighty
hours of filming and two years of
editing went into the final 92
minutes of this splendid color
documentary. The shooting of
religious ceremonies, ritual
practices and interviews was done
in India, Tibet, Nepal, Israel and
the U.S.
No attempt is made to
editorialize the experience of the
film. In the words of its director,
Fredrick Cohn, formerly with
KQED, "the material is its own
commentary."
The Sufi Choir provides
appropriate background music,
chanting and song.
Above all, "Sunseed" is a
celebration of a spiritual
awakening, the dawning of the
Aquarian Age in American
consciousness. All the holy men
come out in open priase of

American youth as those who
most seek spiritual enlightenment.
"Drugs are not the answer,"
explains Yogi Bhajan, "that's like
jumping into darkness," "No
freaking out!" says Swami
Muktananda as he leads his yoga
class.
Montage sequences highlight
daily Indian religious life, a
Tibetan Tea ceremony, festivals at
different Asian ashrams, various
celebrations on communes in New
Hampshire and Arizona, and Sufi
dances in San Francisco. Short
shots move the film at a fast pace,
sustaining interest and touching
on many varieties of religious
experience.
Globally there seems to be an
understanding that we are living in
a period when the struggle for
mastery of this planet is being
waged on many levels, requiring
immense changes. "Sunseed" is an
attempt to explore the spiritual
changes that are taking place and
have, as yet, gone unnoticed in
film. It is an intimate and joyous
experience.

SCORPIO
Directed by Michael Winner
Written by David W. Rintels
and Gerald Wilson
"Scorpio" is an outmoded spy
thriller, complete with insipid
international intrigue and double
dealing. Burt Lancaster stars as
Gerald Cross, a top CIA agent
who may or may not be defecting
to the other side. His boss (John
Colicos) orders he be dispatched
for security reasons and bribes a
French secret agejit (Alain Delon)
to do the job. The film moves
from Paris to Washington, to
Vienna, and then back to

defect to. After such a brilliant
performance in the lead role of
"A Man For All Seasons," one
wonders what sort of machination
brought him into this film at all.
He plays a dedicated "true"
communist whose role in the plot
is minimal but whose name will
certainly help sell the film.
A combination team of writers
conceived the hackneyed script,
which is as uninteresting as it is
unoriginal. The Central
Intelligence Agency seems to be
run by faceless, methodical
psychopaths whose only rule is to
"keep the game going."
Girlfriends become informers and
everyone is double crossed
somewhere along the line.
Some pithy snatches of
dialogue in "Scorpio:" "One
move and I'll splash you across
the sheets;" "I want Cross and I
want him burned;" "I won't cry if
the goon dies;" 'There's a gun out
for you;" "I don't play games
when the rules are bent;" and, my
favorite, "So far you haven't said
anything that lit candles in the
dark."
