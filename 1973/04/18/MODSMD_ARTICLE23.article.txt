# Film Majors At Stanford
## 
### JEFFREY GREENWALD 
If you are considering going into film and
broadcasting, forget it! The Graduate School of
Communications at Stanford only accepts sixteen
students into its school every fall and according to
Ron Alexander, senior lecturer in Communications,
'The school's policy is to encourage only
non-Stanford students to enroll."
While no pre-requisites are needed to apply and
the course outline for the year program is broad and
interesting, an M.A. in Film and Broadcasting will
not reserve for you a very lucrative job after
graduation as the unemployment rate in the film
industry runs seasonally as high as 60 percent.
The year program prepares the student to
complete in entirety a thesis film of length 30 to 60
minutes. This film must be written, edited,
produced and formatted using sincronized sound by

the student who has completed 3 quarters of
required classes in the school of Communications.
Animation is taught in the second quarter and
throughout the year course teaching assistants work
closely with the students in preparing short films in
preparation for the thesis projects.
As many schools in the United States are turning
out "film majors," it is often difficult to be
guaranteed an editing job at a studio or a camera
shooting job at a network broadcast station. Self
discipline and self-initiative is needed in starting up
a business in the film industry. In Palo Alto
Veriation Films was started by four graduate
students in the school of Communications.
Unless you are willing to go into a field that has
very limited job opportunities with few high paying
jobs, it is a good idea to look elsewhere for a career
in Film and Broadcasting.
