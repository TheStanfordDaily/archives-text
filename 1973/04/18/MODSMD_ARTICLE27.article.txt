# Cards Hope To Break Golf Slump At Prestigious Western Tourney
## 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
Stanford will try to break out
of its midseason golf slump at the
Western Intercollegiates, which
begin today at Pasatiempo Golf
Course in Santa Cruz.
The three-day, 54 hole tourney
features a strong 26 team field,
including four squads ranked in
the nation's top 10 by Golf World
magazine. Defending champion
Arizona State (currently ranked
sixth nationally), seventh ranked

USC, and eighth ranked Brigham
Young are entered, along with the
10th ranked Cardinals.
All of the other top teams on
the West Coast will also compete
at Pasatiempo, including Fresno
State, a fast-improving team
which won its own Fresno State
Classic last weekend and
triumphed in the University of
Pacific Invitational two weeks
ago. San Jose State and San Diego
State are other possible
challengers for the team title.
Prestigious Tourney
This impressive field and the
difficult Pasatiempo course
annually make the Western
Intercollegiates "the most
prestigious tournament on the
West Coast," according to
Stanford coach Bud Finger.
"Outside of the NCAA's and the
Pac-B's, we'd rather win the
Western Intercollegiates than any
tournament on our schedule,"
Finger said.
If the Cards are to win,
however, they will have to play
considerably better than they
have the past two weeks, when
Stanford finished third in the
UOP tourney and sixth at the
Fresno State Classic. "Everyone
has just been playing bad," said
Card number-one man Aly

Trompas. "It seems like ever since
we lost Bruce (Robertson), we
haven't been playing well."
Trompas also offered another
possible explanation for the
Cards' slump. "I think we played
well at Santa Barbara [Stanford
won the Pacific Coast Invitational
there three weeks ago] because it
was during spring vacation and all
we had to think about was golf.
Hard To Prepare
"Now its a lot harder to really
prepare for a tournament when
there's so much else to think
about. I know I always play better
in the summer when I can really
concentrate on my game."
However Trompas indicated
that things might get better for
Stanford this week. "This is a
really good tournament and we all
like the golf course," he said.
"That should help us get ready."
Dave Baskins should be
particularly confident, having
finished sixth in last year's
tournament as a freshman on
rounds of 73-74-71. Last year the
Cardinal team finished fourth
behind Arizona State, USC, and
San Jose State.
Finger has listed Trompas,
Baskins, Conrad Nilmeier, Denny
Colvin, George Pettinger, and Bob
Chapman as Stanford's entrants in
this week's tourney.
