# Tennis Star Isn't Satisfied
## Delaney Says He'll Try Football 
### BILL WEINSTEIN 
"I've always enjoyed football
and basketba 1 ' more than tennis,"
says Stanfon' - :inis star Jim
Delaney. A J u<- Davis Cupper, a
freshman All-American, a finalist
in the National Amateur Clay
Courts Championship, undefeated
in varsity singles play this year as
Stanford's number two man,
Delaney plans to turn out as a
wide receiver for varsity football
in September.
Football? Delaney casually
explained that "I really like the
sport a lot. I like the contact."
And for Delaney, knowing his
own abilities, that was answer
enough.
For Delaney's chief sport in
high school was not tennis, but
basketball. He was named an
All-Star Basketball player—of the
Far East.
The Far East? Delaney
matter-of-factly mentioned that
he had lived in the Orient 12
years. His father, a member of the
State Department, had served in
both Taiwan and Japan.
Fluent Japanese
"I went to an American school
over there," he said. However,
Delaney said he learned tennis
with Japanese friends and now
can speak fluent Japanese.
Delaney said he liked Japan
but wished he "had gone back to
school back here," because
"competition really makes a
difference" in his athletic
improvement. "I had to play with
my little brothers," he related.
Asked how he expected to do
in football, Delaney replied, "I
know it will be a lot of hard work,
but I've done pretty well so far. I
think I have more natural ability
than other guys. I think I can
become a pretty good player."
Tennis Coach Dick Gould said
Delaney "has a tremendous
amount of natural talent" and is
an "outstanding prospect for his
age in the U.S."
Good Serve
Delaney's reply: "I guess my
serve is pretty good and I cover
the court all right." Smiling, he
quickly pointed out that because
he learned tennis in the Far East,
"I was really 'wristee.' He [Coach

Gould] has tried to cut it out."
Gould admitted Delaney's
movements are somewhat jerky
but sa the sophomore "has
made a tremendous amount of
progress. Now for the first time,"
the coach said, "he is on the way
to becoming a great player."
Last season, Delaney
immediately established himself in
Stanford's top four, and thus
made it to the NCAA
championships, where he reached
the fourth round. He and his
doubles partner Chico Hagey also
won the Southern Mens' Doubles
Tournament.
For his 1972 accomplsihments,
Delaney was ranked 43rd among
all men in the U.S. This followed
a ranking of fourth among juniors
the previous year.
Thus far this season, Delaney
has been playing the best tennis of
his life. He has beaten his foes
from USC and UCLA twice
already, and is currently
Stanford's only undefeated
player.

"If I keep going the way I am I
could make a lot of money in
tennis," Delaney said, referring to
a possible in professional tennis.
Asked about a pro football
career, he laughed and then said,
"I can't see myself getting that
good. The chances of that
happening are pretty remote."
Delaney, who lives at the Zeta
Psi fraternity, says of Stanford, "I
really enjoy my classes here.
Unfortunately, it's hard to spend
as much time in classes with
tennis." A possible political

science major, he hopes this
summer to play against many of
the major pro tennis players. "My
game is getting better all the
time," he said.
Unassuming, dedicated,
confident, "a super kid"
according to Gould, Delaney
looks forward to success on the
courts—and on the gridiron.
Sitting back in his chair, he smiled
and then chuckled. "Like
anything, if you work at it you
can get half-decent," he said. In
Delaney's case, that may be the
understatement of the year.
