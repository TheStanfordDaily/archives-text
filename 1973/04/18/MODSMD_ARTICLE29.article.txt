# Netmen Breeze To 8-1 Victory
## 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
Heavy winds couldn't stop the
Stanford tennis team from
breezing to its tenth win of the
year against only two losses as the
Cardinals topped UC San Diego
8-1 yesterday.
Jim Delaney, playing first
singles for the Cards, looked like a
father teaching his son how to
play as he relaxed his way to a
6-0, 6-4 win over Andy Rae.
The smaller-than-average crowd
at the Varsity Courts also watched
Pat DuPre and Chip Fisher,
playing second and third singles,
win easily, although both had to
play more aggressively than
Delaney.
Other singles winners were
John Whitlinger, Paul Sidone, and
Mark Mitchell, none of whom lost
a set.
The Cards' only loss came at
first doubles, where Chip Fisher
and Delaney were beaten, 6-4, 7-6
in a match which ended in a
near-hurricane and was frequently
interrupted by stray equipment
blowing onto the court.
The second doubles team of
DuPre and Mitchell proved that
you can have a good time and still
win, as they literally laughed their
way to a 6-0, 6-3 decision. Jake
Warde and Craig Johnson added a
6-2, 6-2 win to round out the
Cards' victory.
Today the team hosts Arizona,
one of the nation's 10 best teams,
in the final tuneup for this
weekend's (JSC and UCLA
matches.
