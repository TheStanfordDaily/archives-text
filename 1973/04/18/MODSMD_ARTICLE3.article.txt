# Nixon To Suspend Staffers Indicted In Watergate Case
## 
### Associated Press 
WASHINGTON - President Nixon
yesterday said there have been "major
developments" pointing toward the
truth in the Watergate affair, but
disclosed no details.
Nixon said he will immediately
suspend any members of the executive
branch who may in the future be
indicted by a federal grand jury
considering the matter.
The President dropped his
longstanding insistence that no
administration officials were involved
in the wiretapping case.
Nixon also capitulated to a special
Senate investigating committee that
has -insisted, over his objections, that
any White House aides summoned
must give sworn testimony in public
hearings.
He said his aides would appear
voluntarily and "answer fully all
proper questions," while reserving the
right to invoke executive privilege and

remain silent on some specific
inquiries.
CRP Offers Settlement
In a related development, the
Committee to Re-elect the President
has reportedly offered to pay damages
to the Democratic party to settle
lawsuits over the Watergate raid.
Democratic National Committee
Chairman Robert S. Strauss made the
announcement last night.
Democrats had sued for $6.4
million, and officials of the Nixon
campaign had counter-sued for a total
of $7.5 million. The Committee for
the Re-election of the President
reportedly has offered to pay
$525,000 and to drop its own suits.
'Serious Discussions'
Strauss said "serious discussions"
about an out-of-court settlement had
been going on for months, and that "it
has become intense in the past several
weeks."
But he added, "We won't settle it
until we see what goes on in the public
inquiry and are sure that our
settlement does not diminish the scope
of that inquiry."
Strauss wouldn't deny the reported
$525,000 amount of the settlement
offer.
Nixon Statement
In a three-minute statement at the
White House, Nixon said he personally
ordered an intensive new investigation
into the raid on Democratic Party
headquarters last June 17, because of
serious charges raised in March.
"I can report today that there have
been major developments in the case
concerning which it would be
improper to be more specific now,
except to say that real progress has
been made in finding the truth,"
Nixon said.
He answered no questions.
The President said he ordered a
second administration investigation of
the Watergate affair on March 21

because of "serious charges which
came to my attention, some of which
were publicly reported . .
First Investigation
The first White House probe was
conducted by Nixon's official lawyer,
John W. Dean 111. Last Aug. 29 Nixon
said Dean's investigation indicated that
nobody at that time on the White
House staff or in the administration
was involved.
In recent weeks Dean himself, and
others, have been implicated in
hearsay testimony reportedly given in
secret by James McCord, one of seven
men convicted in last year's break-in
and bugging of Democratic offices in
the Watergate building.
The President didn't explain the
significance of the March 21 date. It
was two days later that McCord,
appearing for sentencing on his
conviction, handed Chief U.S. Dist.
Judge John J. Sirica a letter in which
he said he knew of others involved in
the case who hadn't been caught, that
perjury had been committed during
the trial, and that "political pressure"
was applied to silence defendants in
the case.
Secret Testimony
Since then McCord has testified in
secret before the Senate investigating
committee and before a federal grand
jury.
Reliable sources have quoted
McCord as saying G. Gordon Liddy, a
Nixon campaign official also convicted
in the case, had told him Dean, former
Att.y. Gen. John N. Mitchell and Jeb S.
Magruder, who was second-in
command at the Nixon campaign,
helped plan bugging and other related
operations.
Nixon said he would fire any
employee convicted in the case and
has told law enforcement officials that
nobody is exempt from prosecution,
including present or former
administration officials.

Since then McCord has testified in
secret before the Senate investigating
committee and before a federal grand
jury.
Reliable sources have quoted
McCord as saying G. Gordon Liddy, a
Nixon campaign official also convicted
in the case, had told him Dean, former
Att.y. Gen. John N. Mitchell and Jeb S.
Magruder, who was second-in
command at the Nixon campaign,
helped plan bugging and other related
operations.
Nixon said he would fire any
employee convicted in the case and
has told law enforcement officials that
nobody is exempt from prosecution,
including present or former
administration officials.
WASHINGTON - President Nixon
yesterday said there have been "major
developments" pointing toward the
truth in the Watergate affair, but
disclosed no details.
Nixon said he will immediately
suspend any members of the executive
branch who may in the future be
indicted by a federal grand jury
considering the matter.
The President dropped his
longstanding insistence that no
administration officials were involved
in the wiretapping case.
Nixon also capitulated to a special
Senate investigating committee that
has -insisted, over his objections, that
any White House aides summoned
must give sworn testimony in public
hearings.
He said his aides would appear
voluntarily and "answer fully all
proper questions," while reserving the
right to invoke executive privilege and

remain silent on some specific
inquiries.
CRP Offers Settlement
In a related development, the
Committee to Re-elect the President
has reportedly offered to pay damages
to the Democratic party to settle
lawsuits over the Watergate raid.
Democratic National Committee
Chairman Robert S. Strauss made the
announcement last night.
Democrats had sued for $6.4
million, and officials of the Nixon
campaign had counter-sued for a total
of $7.5 million. The Committee for
the Re-election of the President
reportedly has offered to pay
$525,000 and to drop its own suits.
'Serious Discussions'
Strauss said "serious discussions"
about an out-of-court settlement had
been going on for months, and that "it
has become intense in the past several
weeks."
But he added, "We won't settle it
until we see what goes on in the public
inquiry and are sure that our
settlement does not diminish the scope
of that inquiry."
Strauss wouldn't deny the reported
$525,000 amount of the settlement
offer.
Nixon Statement
In a three-minute statement at the
White House, Nixon said he personally
ordered an intensive new investigation
into the raid on Democratic Party
headquarters last June 17, because of
serious charges raised in March.
"I can report today that there have
been major developments in the case
concerning which it would be
improper to be more specific now,
except to say that real progress has
been made in finding the truth,"
Nixon said.
He answered no questions.
The President said he ordered a
second administration investigation of
the Watergate affair on March 21

because of "serious charges which
came to my attention, some of which
were publicly reported . .
First Investigation
The first White House probe was
conducted by Nixon's official lawyer,
John W. Dean 111. Last Aug. 29 Nixon
said Dean's investigation indicated that
nobody at that time on the White
House staff or in the administration
was involved.
In recent weeks Dean himself, and
others, have been implicated in
hearsay testimony reportedly given in
secret by James McCord, one of seven
men convicted in last year's break-in
and bugging of Democratic offices in
the Watergate building.
The President didn't explain the
significance of the March 21 date. It
was two days later that McCord,
appearing for sentencing on his
conviction, handed Chief U.S. Dist.
Judge John J. Sirica a letter in which
he said he knew of others involved in
the case who hadn't been caught, that
perjury had been committed during
the trial, and that "political pressure"
was applied to silence defendants in
the case.

secret before the Senate investigating
