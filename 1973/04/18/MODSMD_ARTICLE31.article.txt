Lon Nol Regime May Reorganize
PHNOM PENH, Cambodia - The Lon Nol
government was reported in agreement last night on
reorganizing itself to induce insurgents into peace
talks and a cease-fire.
The new government would include opposition
leaders, informed sources said.
An announcement was expected today, provided
final details are worked out, the informants added.
It was learned from senior government officials
and confidants of Lon Nol that the Cambodian
leader agreed to the move under pressure from
President Nixon, who sent his special emissary, Gen.
Alexander M. Haig Jr., to Phnom Penh a week ago
when the military situation in the Cambodian
capital became critical.
Communist-led forces and other insurgents made
big military gains, cutting all of the major highways
leading into Phnom Penh.
It was understood that Lon Nol would continue
as president, although it was not certain whether the
Communist side would accept him in any future
negotiations.
During the past two years, the 59-year-old
Cambodian head of state has become increasingly
isolated from the people. He is partially paralyzed.
His regime is considered corrupt.
Some Cabinet members will be dismissed and
replaced by non-Communist opposition elements
with whom it is hoped the Communists and other
insurgents will negotiate.
Cambodia is the only Indochina country that
remains without a cease-fire agreement. A V\9tnam
truce was officially declared Jan. 28 and a cease-fire
went into effect in Laos Feb. 22, although fighting
continues in both countries and no political
settlements have been reached either among
thyopposing Vietnamese or Laotian parties.
Many political observers believe that only U.S.
backing, including massive American air strikes, has
kept the Lon Nol government from collapsing.
Two Shot At Wounded Knee
WOUNDED KNEE, S.D. — Two members of the
Indian force holding Wounded Knee were wounded
yesterday when heavy gunfire erupted between
militants in the village and federal officers
surrounding them, a federal spokesman said.
Asst. U.S. Atty. Gen. Stanley Pottinger said there
was about a 90-minute exchange of heavy gunfire
yesterday morning, followed by sporadic exchanges

through the afternoon.
It was the first announced violation of a
cease-fire which has been in effect for three weeks
at the village, held by American Indian Movement
members for seven weeks.
However, government sources said there has been
unannounced sporadic gunfire from the village
almost every night.
Pottinger said he was aware of two reported
casualties, one of them a serious head wound.
He said Indians brought the man to a federal
roadblock. He was taken by helicopter from there
to a hospital at nearby Pine Ridge, then flown to a
Rapid City hospital.
Teamster-UFW Battle Continues
COACHELLA — The jurisdictional struggle between
the Teamsters Union and the striking United Farm
Workers Union heated up yesterday and the
Riverside County sheriff's department went onto
12-hour shifts with no days off.
Undersheriff Robert Presley ordered the
emergency procedure, beginning at midnight
Tuesday and lasting indefinitely, because "the
problem appears to be accelerating in severity."
Thirty-three pickets were arrested and four more
table grape growers obtained temporary restraining
orders to limit picketing.
Presley's reference to "severity" applied to the
frequency of law violations rather than their nature,
a department spokesman said. Most of the alleged
violations involve misdemeanor trespassing, he said.
UFWU officials conceded that some work was
still being done on the raches of growers who signed
contracts with the rival Teamsters but said the work
force was far below normal.
In Washington, D.C., Cesar Chavez was joined at
a news conference by Rep. Edward Roybal
(D-Calif.). They said they had indications that
growers had been intimidated into signing with the
rival Teamsters.
The UFWU went on strike Monday after most of
the table grape growers in the Coachella Valley
signed with the Teamsters instead of the Chavez-led
group, which had negotiated the workers' first
contract three years ago.
Both unions claim to represent a majority of the
grape workers here.
Richardson Defends DoD Cuts
WASHINGTON — Secretary of Defense Elliot L.
Richardson said yesterday that his sweeping new
base reduction order is "timely and necessary" and
hinted that more shutdowns are coming over the
next few years.
"I would not wish to represent that the
realignments that have been announced here today
are the last realignments that will take place over
the next few years," Richardson told a news
conference.
He said a total of 274 base closings, reductions
and consolidations should save about $3.5 billion
over the next 10 years.
But he acknowledged that the Pentagon actually
will have to lay out an additional $64.4 million in

the first year to cover relocation and other costs.
A total of 40 Army, Navy and Air Force bases in
the United States are to be closed, most of them
over the next 14 months. The rest of the reduction
will involve cutbacks in activities at various bases,
plus some consolidations.
Over-all, Richardson said, there will be a net
reduction of 42,800 positions, military and civilian.
Shultz Says Freeze Unlikely
WASHINGTON — Secretary of the Treasury George
P. Shultz yesterday all but ruled out a new
wage-price freeze but hinted that President Nixon
may have some announcements on new
anti-inflation controls later this week.
A price freeze or price roll-back had been
regarded as one administration option in dealing
with the fastest price increases since the Korean
War.
But Shultz told newsmen Tuesday: "A general
across-the-board wage-price freeze is not under
active consideration by the President as far as I
know."
He said President Nixon might make a statement
on the anti-inflation program when and if Congress
sends him an acceptable bill extending his authority
to control wages and prices.
A White House spokesman said yesterday the
President is conducting a continuing review of
economic matters, but said no final decisions have
been made.
The President's control authority expires April
30. The administration scored a significant victory
Monday when the House voted a simple one-year
extension without the amendments on price
rollbacks and freezes that it had threatened earlier.
Airline Employees Walk Out
NEW YORK - Eastern Airlines cancelled flights out
of New York, Miami, Chicago and Washington last
night after flight attendant personnel walked off
jobs.
A spokesman at Eastern's company headquarters
in Miami said the walkouts occurred although
negotiations between the airline and the Airlines
Stewards and Stewardesses Association continued in
Washington.
Eastern President Samuel L. Higginbottom said
in Washington that the strike was unauthorized.
A local representative of the ALSSA, however,
insisted the walkout was legal, although there was
no word from the union on why members were
picketing while talks continued.
A strike by the union had been set for midnight
Monday, but negotiators agreed to an 18-hour delay
which officially expired at 3 p.m. yesterday. The
union seeks a new contract covering wages and
working conditions.
