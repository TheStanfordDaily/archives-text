# Lyman Discusses P.A. Annexations

### JAMES LOBSENZ 
"From our own point of view the
annexation of Stanford residential
land by the City of Palo Alto would be
somewhat advantageous," President
Richard Lyman asserted on KZSU's
"Campus Conference" last night.
Palo Alto City Council candidate
Robert Cullenbine has suggested the
city annex Stanford residential land in
order to allow campus student and
faculty residents to take part in
municipal government.
Lyman maintained that annexation
would relieve Stanford of the financial
responsibility of maintaining its own
fire, police, and road maintenance
departments.
But the proposal would not be
entirely attractive to all Palo Alto
residents, Lyman pointed out, for
"although the Palo Alto Unified
School District gets about $9 or $10
million dollars out of the Stanford
district every year, they wouldn't get
nearly that amount of revenue out of
residential taxes.

"Furthermore, there would be
mixed feelings in Palo Alto about
having a large part of their electorate
composed of students, on grounds of
age, and simply because most students
don't really live here," he added.
In another matter, Lyman said he
was pleased with the progress of the
Campaign for Stanford, which has
already netted a third of its $300
million goal in gifts and pledges. "It
would be foolish not to be
encouraged, but I find myself hesitant
to encourage anyone to be
complacent," he observed.
To the question "Isn't the first
hundred million always the easiest?"
Lyman answered "both yes and no.
There is certainly a rocky road ahead,"
he admitted, "but we have not by any
means reached all the major potential
donors. There are literally hundreds of
potential contributors that haven't
even been approached yet."
Solicitations for smaller donations
don't begin until the third year of the
campaign, stated Lyman.
