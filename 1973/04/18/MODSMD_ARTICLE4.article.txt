# Run-Off Possible In Oakland Mayoral Election
## 
### KEVIN SMITH 
In two cliffhanging elections
yesterday, it was still unknown
whether Oakland Mayor John Reading
would be forced into a run-off with
runner-up Bobby Seale and whether
radicals would manage to take contr '
of the Berkeley City Council.
With all of the 436 precincts
counted in Oakland, Reading fell 84
votes short of the 50 percent needed
to avoid a run-off with his closest
challenger, Black Panther Party
Chairman Bobby Seale, who compiled
19 percent of the vote. Otho Green, a
former manpower coordinator for the
Office of Economic Opportunity,
finished third with 16 percent of the
vote while City Councilman John
Sutter had 14 percent.
In Berkeley, where four City
Council seats were contested, the
radical April Coalition needed to pick
up two seats in order to gain a
five-member majority. The Coalition's
main opposition came from the
"liberal" Berkeley Four slate, which
had accused the Coalition of being
"irresponsible."
With 172 of 189 precincts counted,
incumbents Wilmont Sweeney and
Susan Home, both with the Berkeley
Four, narrowly held onto the top two
positions. Radical Ying Lee Kelley

followed very closely in third place
while liberal Henry Ramsey Jr. clung
to fourth.
A fifth candidate, Margot Dashiell
of the April Coalition, still had a good
chance to break into the top four.
During the early returns, it
appeared that the entire radical slate

might be headed for victory, and
Kelley and Dashiell held the top two
positions throughout most of the race.
However, the votes that came in later
tipped the balance toward the
Berkeley Four.
Berkeley voters also considered
seven initiatives and one referendum.

The widely publicized marijuana
initiative, which requires that police
make marijuana laws their "lowest
priority," passed by a two to one
margin. The initiative also prohibits
police from making marijuana arrests
without the authorization of the City
Council, and is possibly

unconstitutional.
All four initiatives concerning the
Berkeley Police Department seem to
have passed, some by very close
margins.
Berkeley voters approved the
creation of a Police Review
Commission made up of Berkeley
citizens by a three to two margin and
passed an ordinance requiring City
Council approval of all mutual aid
pacts between the Berkeley Police and
other law enforcement agencies by a

similar majority.
Two initiatives, one forbidding the
police from carrying any weapons
larger than small handguns and one
requiring all Police Dept. employees to
live in Berkeley, both seemed to pass
by small majorities.
