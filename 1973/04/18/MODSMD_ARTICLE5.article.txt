# Liberal Candidate Gains P.A. School Seat; Two Incumbents Returned To Foothill Board
## 
### ROBERT BACON 
Liberal Rebecca Morgan trounced
conservative Virginia Williams for a
seat on the Palo Alto Unified School
District board yesterday.
In another election, two incumbent
candidates for the Foothill
Community College District board
easily turned back the challenge of a
Foothill College student.
With about 40 percent of the vote
counted last night, Morgan had 2,103
(73 percent) while Williams had 769
(27 percent).
In the Foothill contest, with about
60 percent tallied, board Chairman
Mar> r Lou Zoglin led the field with
8,441 votes (45 percent); incumbent

Alfred P. Chasuk had 7,737 (41
percent); and Foothill College student
David M. Moskowitz had 2,603 (14
percent). Two seats on the Foothill
board were at stake.
Light Turnout
The turnout, almost always light in
school board contests, was further
reduced by the coincidence of the
election with the public schools'
Easter vacation.
Williams had staked her campaign
on a belief in "basic education" and
charged that the district had
emphasized educational innovation
and enrichment programs at the
expense of basic instruction.
Morgan responded that she felt,
along with a majority of the present
board, that the district had the
capability — and the duty — to provide
both instruction in the basics and less
conventional programs.
Morgan, 34 and a housewife,
replaces Agnes Robinson who retired
after ten years on the board. Morgan
will serve a five-year term on the
five-member board.
Foothill
In the Foothill contest, Zoglin ran
substantially without opposition when
Moskowitz announced that he sought
to unseat Chasuk in the three-way
race.
Zoglin, who serves as president of
the California Junior College
Association, is a 12-year veteran of the
Foothill board and has played a
leading role in the expansion of the
district's programs. She emphasized
her record of accomplishments in
office. Age 44, she is the wife of a Los
Altos physician.
Chasuk, 49, a Mountain View
lawyer, has served one four-year term
on the board. He, too, emphasized to
voters a long list of advances the
district had made during his term.
Young Person
Moskowitz, 23, claimed that
Chasuk did not relate well to students
in general and members of minority
groups in particular. Moskowitz

insisted that the board needed a young
person and particularly a student
among its members.
Both districts include the Stanford
campus.
Voter turnout here was extremely
light, with less than 10 percent of the
4984 registered voters on campus
going to the polls.
The best record was recorded at
Nixon School, where nearly all the
registrants were faculty housing

residents. The turnout there was 16
percent.
Escondido Villagers, voting at
Escondido School, recorded a seven
percent turnout. About the same
percentage came to the polls at
Tresidder Union.
Low turnout for the campus was at
Wilbur Hall, where an electorate
consisting entirely of dormitory
students recorded only a six percent
turnout.

LOW TURNOUT — One of a very small number of voters who cast ballots at
Tresidder Union yesterday takes a ballot from an election official. The official,
seated, reported yesterday evening that less than 10 percent of those eligible on
the campus — both students and faculty — went to the polls to vote for school
board members.
