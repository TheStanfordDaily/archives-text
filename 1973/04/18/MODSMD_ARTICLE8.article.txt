# War Caused By U.S. Intervention
## Cambodia: Civil War Or Invasion? 
###

The final groups of U.S. prisoners of war have come home.
President Thieu has come to the U.S. to express his gratitude for
assistance over the past ten years. This might have been a scenario to
the end of a war but this is not to be.
The war in Indochina continues much as before, and the deepening
"crisis" in Cambodia threatens to destroy whatever progress has been
made towards peace. One might then ask who is fighting in Cambodia,
and why the U.S. continues to bomb.
Since the overthrow of the former Chief of State Prince Sihanouk,
(deposed by Lon Nol in March of 1970) Cambodia has been declared
by her new military leaders, under Lon Nol, the Khmer Republic. Lon
Nol insists that his country is being attacked by the Viet Cong and the
North Vietnamese. Prince Sihanouk, presently the leader of the
National United Front of Cambodia (which is fighting Lon Nol), says
that his kingdom suffers from the aggression of the U.S. imperialists.
To make sense of the present situation these two statements must be
considered.
Disparity
Prince Sihanouk said in Peking last month that since the summer of
1972, no North Vietnamese or Viet Cong units had been operating in
Cambodia, and that the fight now going on against U.S. support Lon
Nol is being carried out exclusively by the Khmers.
After the Paris Agreements had been formally signed, many
western observers—such as Sir Robert Thompson, the well known
expert on counter-insurgency and an advisor to many Southeast Asian
countries—admitted that the Viet Cong and the North Vietnamese had
been moving out of Cambodia.
It is stated in the March 12, 1973 edition of U.S. News & World
Report, that the number of North Vietnamese combat troops at that
time was "fewer than ten thousand."
Even taking into consideration the disparity of these three
statements it is inconceivable that this many foreign troops could in
any way account for the confinement of Lon Nol's 200,000 man
army to the capital and the control of 85 percent of Cambodia by the
National United Front at the present time.
Treaties
The Paris Agreements (Article 20) do not permit continued
military activities by any outside country in Cambodia. The 1954
Geneva Accords (Article Seven) do permit Cambodia to solicit foreign
military assistance for the purpose of territorial defense. By
attributing the leadership and motivation of the Khmer Rouge, the
leftist segment of the National United Front to North Vietnam, the
Lon Nol government can call upon outside aid in the form of U.S.
military assistance, continued bombing, and an invasion by South
Vietnamese troops.

In this manner Lon Nol, who is functionally little more than the
mayor of Phnom Penh, could call in the U.S. and South Vietnam to
defeat the "invasion." It is quite clear that such a move would
constitute the most flagrant violation of the Paris Accords to date,
further jeopardizing the possibility of peace in the entire Indochina
region.
Peace in Cambodia can be achieved through negotiations if all
parties agree to talk to one another. Last month Prince Sihanouk said
from Peking that his armed forces were ready to enter into bipartite
talks with the U.S., and Lon Nol has expressed a willingness to talk
with North Vietnam. Neither the U.S. or North Vietnam have shown
an interest in such talks.
Sihanouk and Lon Nol refuse to talk to one another. Sihanouk's
reason is that he sees Lon Nol as little more than a funnel for the 300
million dollars in combined military and economic aid now coming in
from the U.S. Lon Nol must insist that Hanoi is responsible for the
rebellion in order to perpetuate the myth of invasion. Sihanouk's
popularity with the peasantry is such that the mere mention of him as

Lon Nol's enemy would only further undermine his already tottering
regime, thus Lon Nol has never admitted the presence of the Khmer
Rouge or the United National Front.
There is considerable evidence that Lon Nol's government is
growing steadily weaker. In the April 9, 1973 edition of the Far
Eastern Economic Review, for example, it was reported that
intellectuals and students have been fleeing Phnom Penh to join the
National United Front.
The war in Cambodia has been caused by U.S. intervention to serve
its purposes in South Vietnam. (The ousting of Prince Sihanouk in
March of 1970 followed in the subsequent month by the invasion of
Cambodia was anything but coincidental.) The U.S. is responsible for
ending this war peacefully and quickly. The simplest way would be to
cut off funds to Lon Nol which would lead to the immediate collapse
of his government, permitting the groups of the National United
Front to determine the shape of the new government, a government
which already controls most of Cambodia at the present time.
