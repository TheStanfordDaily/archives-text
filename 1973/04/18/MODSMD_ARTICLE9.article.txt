# Institute An Encouraging Sign
## Feminism Marches On 
### 
Doyle McManus

There are encouraging signs that the women's movement is coming
of age here.
It may be less 'political' than before, less militant, or probably
merely less apocalyptic. But it also appears to be acquiring a wider
base of support among men and women, moving into areas - like
scholarly inquiry—that were hitherto neglected, and, in the end,
achieving a position of considerable power in both University affairs
and general social criticism.
On the one hand, a group of faculty, staff, and students are hard at
work on the establishment of a Women's Studies Research
Institute to aid and encourage women's research. On the other
University officials are finding that the women's movement is not

fading away in the manner of other political rehabilitation
movements— and that, as the History Department is currently
discovering, organized women can make things very uncomfortabk
indeed.
Institute
The Women's Studies Research Institute is the more concrete ol
these developments, and its birth is good news indeed. There has long
been a crying need for more scholarly work on women and women's
affairs. Nothing points this up better than the fact that for many years
the guiding literary lights of the women's movement were Kate Millett
and Germaine Greer, both of whose works were slightly
hysterical—and, on balance, nearly as flawed as they were valuable.
The WSRI may be a step toward giving the women's movement the
intellectually-developed base any crusade must have. Beyond that, it
seems to me that there is an intrinsic need for studies in the area,
insofar as the vast majority of anthropological, sociological, literary,
historical, and political scholarship we now have has been done by men
in male academies about institutions defined by male roles.
The Institute is intended to provide "a positive environment for
the intercommunication and encouragement of research in women's
studies." To that end, it expects to hire two half-time co-directors to
administer seminar programs and compile bibliographies, lists of
conferences, and so forth, and to fund three or four fellows every
year. The Fellows, interestingly enough, will be expected to teach
courses as well as do research and consulting.
Seminars
The Institute, incidentally, is even now holding a series of
Thursday noon seminars by local researchers on women. Last
Thursday, Michelle Rosaldo of Anthropology discussed "Women,
Culture, and Society" in cross-cultural perspective; tomorrow, two
members of the English Department at Stanislaus State University will
present a slide show on women's art.
The high point of the series promises to be a debate on May 17
between University Affirmative Action Officer Anne Miner and the
Hoover Institution's rather irrepressible Sidney Hook.
As always, money is a major roadblock, and the Institute's
application for funds is currently pending under consideration by
Undergraduate Studies Dean James Gibbs. Should any semblance of
adequate funding be accomplished, however, the Institute will be a
real addition to the University's research activities and facilities.
History
Then there's this matter of the History Department.
It's a small development, but perhaps a significant one. There is at
present only one woman teaching history here who is not a visiting
professor, Margot Drekmeier. But Mrs. Drekmeier has resigned, and it
appeared for some time thattherewould be no women faculty at all in
the department—one of the University's largest—next year.
That may no longer be the case: a History women's caucus quickly
organized itself, has protested the situation, and has apparently been
heard. While the department is understandably loath to dispense much
information on the subject, it appears there is now a position open for
a woman-who can teach Enlightenment history.
Indeed, it is not difficult to envision a time in the near future when
the administrator's headache will be not anti-imperialist radicals, but
women. There are more of them, which makes them harder to
suspend.

Hoover Institution's rather irrepressible Sidney Hook.
As always, money is a major roadblock, and the Institute's
application for funds is currently pending under consideration by
Undergraduate Studies Dean James Gibbs. Should any semblance of
adequate funding be accomplished, however, the Institute will be a
real addition to the University's research activities and facilities.
History
Then there's this matter of the History Department.
It's a small development, but perhaps a significant one. There is at
present only one woman teaching history here who is not a visiting
professor, Margot Drekmeier. But Mrs. Drekmeier has resigned, and it
appeared for some time thattherewould be no women faculty at all in
the department—one of the University's largest—next year.
That may no longer be the case: a History women's caucus quickly
organized itself, has protested the situation, and has apparently been
heard. While the department is understandably loath to dispense much
information on the subject, it appears there is now a position open for
a woman-who can teach Enlightenment history.
Indeed, it is not difficult to envision a time in the near future when
the administrator's headache will be not anti-imperialist radicals, but
women. There are more of them, which makes them harder to
suspend.

There are encouraging signs that the women's movement is coming
of age here.
It may be less 'political' than before, less militant, or probably
merely less apocalyptic. But it also appears to be acquiring a wider
base of support among men and women, moving into areas - like
scholarly inquiry—that were hitherto neglected, and, in the end,
achieving a position of considerable power in both University affairs
and general social criticism.
On the one hand, a group of faculty, staff, and students are hard at
work on the establishment of a Women's Studies Research
Institute to aid and encourage women's research. On the other
University officials are finding that the women's movement is not

fading away in the manner of other political rehabilitation
movements— and that, as the History Department is currently
discovering, organized women can make things very uncomfortabk
indeed.
Institute
The Women's Studies Research Institute is the more concrete ol
these developments, and its birth is good news indeed. There has long
been a crying need for more scholarly work on women and women's
affairs. Nothing points this up better than the fact that for many years
the guiding literary lights of the women's movement were Kate Millett
and Germaine Greer, both of whose works were slightly
hysterical—and, on balance, nearly as flawed as they were valuable.
The WSRI may be a step toward giving the women's movement the
intellectually-developed base any crusade must have. Beyond that, it
seems to me that there is an intrinsic need for studies in the area,
insofar as the vast majority of anthropological, sociological, literary,
historical, and political scholarship we now have has been done by men
in male academies about institutions defined by male roles.
The Institute is intended to provide "a positive environment for
the intercommunication and encouragement of research in women's
studies." To that end, it expects to hire two half-time co-directors to
administer seminar programs and compile bibliographies, lists of
conferences, and so forth, and to fund three or four fellows every
year. The Fellows, interestingly enough, will be expected to teach
courses as well as do research and consulting.
Seminars
The Institute, incidentally, is even now holding a series of
Thursday noon seminars by local researchers on women. Last
Thursday, Michelle Rosaldo of Anthropology discussed "Women,
Culture, and Society" in cross-cultural perspective; tomorrow, two
members of the English Department at Stanislaus State University will
present a slide show on women's art.
The high point of the series promises to be a debate on May 17
between University Affirmative Action Officer Anne Miner and the
Hoover Institution's rather irrepressible Sidney Hook.
