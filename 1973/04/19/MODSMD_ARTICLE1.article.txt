# Final Vote Today
## ASSU Turnout Small 
### 
Voter turnout in yesterday's ASSU
balloting appeared to be lighter than
last year. Elections Commissioner
Mike Nilsson said yesterday.
Nilsson said that 1551 persons
voted in the first day of the two-day
election, down from approximately
1800 at this point last year.
Nilsson said he didn't know what
caused the drop, unless it was "an
overall lack of concern with the
ASSU." He said that second-day
voting is generally heavier than
first-day.
He said that unofficial results will
be available late Thursday night. They
will appear in Friday's Daily.
Final official returns will be
withheld until overseas campus ballots
are tallied.
At stake in the race are six
constitutional amendments, five fee
assessments, the ASSU Council of
Presidents election, and the senior

class presidential election.
Five slates are seeking the ASSU
presidency, and if no slate receives an
absolute majority in the primary, a
runoff between the top two slates will
determine the winners.
The slates are:
—Young Socialists Fred Choate and
Ed Ryu;
—Libertarians Judy Cans and Buzz
Thompson;
—Robert Garcia and Dave Meyer;
—Kevin O'Grady, Beth Garfield,
Charles Ogletree, and Jim Friend;
—and Peter Van Petten, Jim
Anderson, Tom Flohr, and Charles
Schott.
The Engineering corner and Post
Office polling places will be open from
10 a.m. to 4 p.m. today, while
Business School, History corner, Med
School, and Physics Tank locations
will be open from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m.
