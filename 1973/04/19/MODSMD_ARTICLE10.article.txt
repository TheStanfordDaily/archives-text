Still A Problem
Editor:
Now that our POW's are out of
North Vietnam and now that the
light at the end of the tunnel has
been left in the hands of a regime
that one would be reluctant to
entrust with the possession of a
burnt-out match, we should
return our energies to more
pressing matters at home.
While the "liberal" faction in
our country threw itself wholly
into the castigation of the
perpetrators of the Vietnam
debacle it chose to ignore another
problem: the still prevalent plight
of the Black American.
In all fairness to the left, the
problem was hidden under a
veritable tide of federal money
and public relationsâ€”but that
does not excuse an abandonment
of reasonable perspectives.
In the famous civil rights
frenzy of the middle '60s, many
people (including myself) were
caught up in the ideological
euphoria that followed the
successful voting rights legislation.
The thing that I and others, as
Black people, should have
remembered was that attitudes do
not necessarily change with the
passage of legislation.
The attitude of white
supremacy is still virulent in the
general population, as any
minority person can readily tell.
Through the slick platitudes and
hooplah, no minority person who
had the slightest grain of
awareness let down his guard.
Yet the Ellsbergs and the
Fondas dismissed the problem in
their own country for one more
exotic and glamorous.
The attitudes that caused the
problem are still here. The effects
of the problem are still evident in
the minority community and in
its psyche.
A new confrontation is clearly
in the offing. The Nixon
administration, working
vigorously to maintain Daniel
Patrick Moynihan's policy of
"benign neglect," only brings it
closer.
Fonda brings it closer with her
insistent harping about the
validity of the prisoners of war.
This, too, is benign neglect of the
American special problem.
I suppose the POW's are telling
the truth. It's a shame that one of
them branded the North
Vietnamese as "little more than
animals." What the North
Vietnamese did was so
characteristically human. We
would do well to realize that,
learn our lesson from it, and put
our own house in order.
