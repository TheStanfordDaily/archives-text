# Prisons: A Ray Of Optimism
## Eight-Cent Hope 
### 
Dennis Conrad

At a time when Stanford
students are being continually
chided for their apathy and lack
of social concern, perhaps a faint
ray of optimism should be
mentioned.
This seeming non-sequitur is a
program called Inside/Out, which
entails no more than writing to a
California prisoner. At present,
nearly 200 students and one
young Political Science professor
have become involved, and that
response is beyond our most
far-reaching expectations. Yet our
list of inmates is growing
constantly; we would like to see
everyone sharing this truly human
expression of concern.
Inside/Out was not the
brainchild of two lonely Stanford
post office box owners; it was
begun by Ken McEachern, an
inmate in Atlanta, and has already
spread to 12 states. It was started
under the assumption that
communication and awareness are
necessary preludes to any
meaningful change in our penal
system, and McEachern hoped
that Inside/Out would help break
the harsh misconceptions and
stereotypes that many people
have of prisoners. As far as we can
tell, 200 people are now writing
to 200 other people; for them the
"prisoner" has become a person, a
unique individual with feelings,
thoughts, worries, passions, and
yes, even intelligence.
Entanglements
From the beginning we have
worried about the possibility of
male-female entanglements, as
years behind bars can often make
for more than sharp pencils. Yet
by letting the prisoners know that
we are not a match-making
service, we have generally avoided
the guy who is looking for a love
affair. We have eased some of the
fears of female students by
offering a list of female prisoners,
and in the few remaining cases
where the inmate still comes on

too strong, we urge the women to
set him straight in a very firm
manner, as we have discovered
that this is the best way of
alleviating some of his wild
fantasies.
The prisoners are now
generally aware of the sincere and
reform oriented goals of
Inside/Out, and we have been
getting as many as 10 letters a day
from men wishing to
communicate their dehumanizing
existence to someone. "All I ask is
that this person be sincere," say
most of the letters.
Some potential correspondents
have wondered if Inside/Out is a
meaningful way to become
involved, as negative connotations
of the term "pen pal" stick in
their minds. But for those who
desire it, the opportunities for
caring beyond the written page
are endless. For instance, one
Inside/Out member is seeking to
organize a visiting program for
those people writing to Soledad
prisoners (call Don at 329-8015).
Another is seeking ways to have
the prisoner's book manuscript
typed. Other students are securing
legal advice, job opportunities)
small luxuries (books, cookies,
etc.), or news clippings.

We are aware that some
students have not yet written to
their assigned correspondents. To
these people we can only say that
each day you procrastinate is one
more day that the prisoner sees
only the concrete, the steel, and
the same disinterested faces.
Letters are his only contact with
the outside world, and in many
cases what you would be telling
him is all that he might hear.
Please write as soon as possible.

California. Besides this
correspondence program, we have
a job placement service, a dental
assistance project at the Elmwood
County Jail, an upcoming
Conference on Prisons, a monthly
newsletter, teams of speakers,
showings of the Stanford Prison
Experiment, dorm discussions and
other prison-related activities. If
you wish to browse, gather
information for a paper, or write
to a prisoner, stop by the Old
Firehoue or call ext. 2677. As
McEachern would say, "Is 8 cents
too great a price to pay to give a
man some hope?"

At a time when Stanford
students are being continually
chided for their apathy and lack
of social concern, perhaps a faint
ray of optimism should be
mentioned.
This seeming non-sequitur is a
program called Inside/Out, which
entails no more than writing to a
California prisoner. At present,
nearly 200 students and one
young Political Science professor
have become involved, and that
response is beyond our most
far-reaching expectations. Yet our
list of inmates is growing
constantly; we would like to see
everyone sharing this truly human
expression of concern.
Inside/Out was not the
brainchild of two lonely Stanford
post office box owners; it was
begun by Ken McEachern, an
inmate in Atlanta, and has already
spread to 12 states. It was started
under the assumption that
communication and awareness are
necessary preludes to any
meaningful change in our penal
system, and McEachern hoped
that Inside/Out would help break
the harsh misconceptions and
stereotypes that many people
have of prisoners. As far as we can
tell, 200 people are now writing
to 200 other people; for them the
"prisoner" has become a person, a
unique individual with feelings,
thoughts, worries, passions, and
yes, even intelligence.
Entanglements
From the beginning we have
worried about the possibility of
male-female entanglements, as
years behind bars can often make
for more than sharp pencils. Yet
by letting the prisoners know that
we are not a match-making
service, we have generally avoided
the guy who is looking for a love
affair. We have eased some of the
fears of female students by
offering a list of female prisoners,
and in the few remaining cases
where the inmate still comes on

too strong, we urge the women to
set him straight in a very firm
manner, as we have discovered
that this is the best way of
alleviating some of his wild
fantasies.
The prisoners are now
generally aware of the sincere and
reform oriented goals of
Inside/Out, and we have been
getting as many as 10 letters a day
from men wishing to
communicate their dehumanizing
existence to someone. "All I ask is
that this person be sincere," say
most of the letters.
Some potential correspondents
have wondered if Inside/Out is a
meaningful way to become
involved, as negative connotations
of the term "pen pal" stick in
their minds. But for those who
desire it, the opportunities for
caring beyond the written page
are endless. For instance, one
Inside/Out member is seeking to
organize a visiting program for
those people writing to Soledad
prisoners (call Don at 329-8015).
Another is seeking ways to have
the prisoner's book manuscript
typed. Other students are securing
legal advice, job opportunities)
small luxuries (books, cookies,
etc.), or news clippings.

We are aware that some
students have not yet written to
their assigned correspondents. To
these people we can only say that
each day you procrastinate is one
more day that the prisoner sees
only the concrete, the steel, and
the same disinterested faces.
Letters are his only contact with
the outside world, and in many
cases what you would be telling
him is all that he might hear.
Please write as soon as possible.
