# Big Cities Cite High Cost
## Clean Air Standards Called Unrealistic 
### Associated Press 
Most of the nation's big cities
say they qannot meet a May 31,
1975, federal deadline to clean up
their air, without controls that
could cost motorists hundreds of
dollars and forbid some private
cars from entering the city.
With little public attention,
plans are being drawn or
completed that would
fundamentally change the lifestyle
in many cities, could threaten
segments of the local economy
and force sizeable expenditures on
local taxpayers without federal
aid.
Under the Clean Air Act of
1970, 21 states and the Distrist of
Columbia had until Monday to
file plans to control
auto-produced carbon monoxide
and smog in 38 cities or urban
areas.
The federal Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) has not
tallied the responses, but an
Associated Press survey found
that at least 14 states failed to file
their plans.
The survey of complete and
incomplete plans showed that
many states, even as they outlined
measures required to meet the
1975 standards, requested

two-year delays. Some are
refusing even to consider the
actions necessary to comply with
the law.
Several states said they were
banking on federal auto emission
standards to help them meet their
requirements. Now they say that
Environmental Protection
Administrator William
Ruckelshaus' decision last week to
give automakers a one-year
extension to 1976 to meet
emission standards has thrown off
their calculations and is forcing
them to consider even harsher
controls.
All these states told EPA last
year that they would need some
transportation controls to get
excessive auto pollution down to
levels that protect public health.
The approaches in the plans
vary from state to state.
Only 20 persons turned out for
the final public hearing April 4 on
plans to reduce Baltimore's traffic
by 40 percent to meet 1975
standards. The draft plan called
for giving different colored license
plates to the 800,000 autos in the
metropolitan area. Cars would be
permitted in the central city on
alternate days according to the
color of the license plate â€” a

measure to encourage car pooling
and bus use.
Pennsylvania submitted a plan
to meet the standards for
Philadelphia and Pittsburgh by
1975 but called the restrictions
''totally unacceptable" and asked
for an extension to 1977.
The plan for 1975 called for
cutting the number of cars
entering the state's two largest
cities by as much as one-third.
One way suggested would restrict
cars on a rotating basis, assigning
cars to groups based on their
license plate number, and banning
specified groups on a given day.
But Pennsylvania said it could
meet the standards by 1977
without the controls by
expanding bus and rail service,
charging higher parking and toll
fees for private cars, giving buses
exclusive highway lanes and
instituting a tough maintenance
and inspection program for auto
emission control devices.
Salt Lake City would eliminate
curb parking in the downtown
area, set up mass parking lots on
the outskirts of town and
encourage businesses to stagger
work hours. *
Arizona, which is asking for an
extension to 1977, would require

owners of 1.5 million vehicles to
pay $90 to $100 to install
catalytic converters on their
vehicles.
New York would require
owners of 5 million cars around
New York City to install $175
emission control devices on
pre-1975 vehicles.
The New York City plan would

also ban the sale of leaded
gasoline by mid-1974 and ban
cruising taxis in the central
business district.
In Los Angeles, where a court
has extended the deadline to
1977, EPA itself proposed
reducing the gasoline available by
86 percent through rationing in
order to cut traffic by 80 percent.
