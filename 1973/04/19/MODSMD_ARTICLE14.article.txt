# Mock Obscenity Trial Set Today
## 
### 
Law students here will participate as attorneys in
a mock obscenity trial today at 7 p.m. in Room
163-E of the Law School.
The students will question expert witnesses
about the obscenity of the hypothetical movie
"Tongue in Cheek." Sergeants-at-Law co-chairman
Rich Singer explained that "though no film will be
shown, the subject move is modeled after the
current controversial film 'Deep Throat,' and all of
the questions of obscenity are actually aimed at that
film."
Psychiatry Prof. Donald Lunde will testify
whether the dominant theme of the move appeals to
prurient interests. Communication Prof. Henry
Breitrose will testify whether the film is utterly

without redeeming social value.
The third witness, an expert from the Palo Alto
Unified School District, will testify about
community standards.
The mock trial will include two teams composed
of three student attorneys each. One team will
represent the district attorney's office and the other
will represent the defendant.
Singer said "nothing is rehearsed and the student
attorneys will have to rely on their own skill,
intelligence and intuition in representing their
client." Singer added that the entire University
community is welcome to attend and said "this
promises to be both an educational and an
enjoyable trial."
