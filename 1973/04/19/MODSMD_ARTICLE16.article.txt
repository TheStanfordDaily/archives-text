# Carnegie Commission Notes Better Financial Status Here

### 
Stanford's financial position
today is better than two years
ago, according to a report
submitted to the Carnegie
Commission on Higher Education
by Earl F. Cheit, professor of
business administration at the
University of California's Berkeley
campus.
If present trends continue,
Cheit believes Stanford, Harvard
and Chicago will be in "about the
same" financial condition three
years hence.
Four major public universities
— Berkeley, Michigan, Minnesota,
and Texas — will not be in as good
condition, he predicts.
Cheit's study, called The New
Depression in Higher Education —
Two Years Later (McGraw-Hill,
83 pp., paper $2) is a follow-up of
an analysis of 41 institutions in
1971, when he reported Stanford
as one of 11 "in financial
difficulty."
Cheit's major finding is that
after their descent from the
"golden years" of the 1950s and
19605, colleges and universities
generally have reached a plateau
of "fragile stability."
In a foreword to the new book,
Carnegie Commission Chairman
Clark Kerr notes that "broadly
speaking .. . private institutions
seem to have adjusted more

quickly and more adequately than
public institutions, and research
universities have been affected
most adversely of all — yet they,
in particular, are most widely
related to the national welfare.
"Two particularly interesting
developments are: 1) the more
central role accorded to the
administration in the new
environment and 2) the securing
of change by a process of
substitution rather than through
growth — and this is a very tough
way to get change."
What Kerr terms "heroic
efforts" to control costs should
help renewed public confidence in
higher education, Kerr adds.
Overall, Cheit found, the 41
institutions studied had an
expenditure growth per student of
five percent annually between
1969-70 and 1972-73, only one
half a percent greater than the
average annual increase in the
consumer price index, 4.5
percent. (During the 19605,
educational costs per student rose
3.4 percent faster than the price
index.)
"A considerable part of the
reduction in expenditure growth
has been achieved by holding
down the increase in faculty
salaries and by deferring
maintenance," Cheit adds. "These
methods of economizing set in
motion conditions that in time
tend to increase costs....
Administrators clearly have a
sense they are living on borrowed
time."
Another reason for regarding
the current fiscal situation as
fragile is concern for future
inflation. Cheit says informal
estimates are that educational
costs rise about one and one-half
times as fast as the consumer price
index.
