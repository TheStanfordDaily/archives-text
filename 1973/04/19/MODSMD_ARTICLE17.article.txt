"The blame which has been placed on LSD as a chromosome
breaking agent may indeed have belonged to marijuana." That's the
conclusion reached by Dr. Morton A. Stenchever of the University of
Utah Medical Center from a study of marijuana users.
Stenchever studied 49 known marijuana users and 20 control
subjects who had not been exposed to any drugs or medications for
six months prior to the study. The user group averaged 3.4 cells with
broken chromosomes per 100 and Stenchever feels this might mean
that marijuana use is related to birth defects and cancer. The control
group showed almost no breaks.

In a recent issue of Changing Times, a former used car dealer
offered the following tips to used car buyers:
"Never ever go near a car lot when you have the car-buying fever.
The salesman can spot that condition from five blocks away. He can
tell you have the symptoms before you even know you're running a
temperature.
"Decide what your price limit is before you go looking. Unless you
are sure of your limits and your needs, you'll end up with something
you had no intention of buying and that you may not even want.
"If at all possible, bring along a savvy friend or hire a working auto
mechanic to come with you and give you a verdict on the spot.
"Insist on a test drive and you and your mechanic do the driving.
Don't leave the title to your own car as security. You may come back
to find your car already shipped out to some other dealer. And if they
say they can't permit a test drive because of insurance laws and so on,
get off that lot quick.
"Look under every mat and cover for rust spots, holes and signs of
decay. Crawl over the car, under it and through it. Don't be shy. If
they see that you are insistent about seeing everything, they won't try
to heist a bummer on you. If you live in a state where car inspection is
the law, insist on being allowed to take the car through inspection
before you close the deal.
"Never buy a car in the rain. Rain can hide the worst paint job, the
worst bump-out fender job. Some engines even run better in the rain.
And you are less likely to crawl under it and spend the time it takes to
give it a good going over.
"Beware of the high-spirited, backslapping office routine or the
offer of a free drink. Too much glad-handling means that they are
hiding something and you are about to get it.
"Never leave the car with the dealer after the deal has been made.
The new tires you saw may be replaced with worn ones and the good
battery may be switched for an old one.
"Never pay the displayed price. Always offer $100 to $150 less
and stick with it. Your chances of getting the hundred are good,
especially if it's near the end of the month. The first ten days of the
months also are a good time to bargain.
"When buying from an individual, be very careful not to get stuck
with a stolen car or one about to re repossessed by a finance
company. Try to know something about the person you are making
the deal with. And do the buying with a recorded, certified check."

Mrs. Ray Greene, a Baltimore mother of 12, feeds her family well
on $70 a week. Here are some food-buying tips of Mrs. Greene's
which were recently printed in The Baltimore News American.
Mix whole milk with non-fat dry milk. Mrs. Greene says this saves
$5 weekly.
Always use margarine instead of butter.
Always use unit pricing as a guide when shopping and plan to
spend enough time in the supermarket for serious price comparison.
For a very inexpensive sandwich spread, mix leftover meat,
chopped onions and pickles in the blender.
An inexpensive after-school drink for children can be made out of
dry milk, cocoa, cream and sugar.
If you have a large family, buy bread in quantity at a budget
bakery. Bread can be easily frozen.
