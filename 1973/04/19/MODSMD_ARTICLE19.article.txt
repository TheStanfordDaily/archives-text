Ellsberg Claims 'War Crimes'
LOS ANGELES — Daniel Ellsberg told jurors yesterday
that the Pentagon papers reveal possible American "war
crimes" in Vietnam, "some of which, I regret to say, I
participated in myself."
Ellsberg said that high U.S. officials planned to break
the Geneva peace accords of 1954 and probably
committed "a crime against the peace. .. under the
Nuremberg principles, as I understand them."
Asst. U.S. Atty. David Nissen raised the "war crimes"
question after U.S. District Judge Matt Byrne barred
asking Ellsberg whether he believed he had broken the law
when he copied the Pentagon study.
The prosecutor apparently was seeking to show that
Ellsberg did not support the policies of his own country
and acted against the country's best interests when he
published the papers.
Ellsberg and Anthony J. Russo are charged with
espionage, conspiracy and theft in connection with the
copying, and distribution of the documents known as the
Pentagon Papers.
Ellsberg, 42, once an adviser to government officials,
stressed that the men making war decisions probably were
"patriots" who meant only the best for their country but
ended by doing the w
"I knew all the time," he said, "that the people I
worked for and with were patriotic men, sometimes the
best of this country."
Segments of the Pentagon papers read to jurors showed
that U.S. agents helped plan a 1963 coup against South
Vietnamese President Ngo Dinh Diem, who was
assassinated.
"In the 1964-65 period," Ellsberg said, speaking
directly to jurors, "the planning documents are evidence
of direct operations against North Vietnam, a country not
at war with us." He called this illegal intervention.
Incumbents Lead Local Elections
OAKLAND, Calif. — Black Panther chairman Bobby
Seale's political career is off to a shaky start — saved from
an early conclusion by a scant 84 votes in a nine-way race
for Oakland mayor.
Those 84 votes were the margin by which white
incumbent Mayor John Reading failed to win a majority
of 110,851 votes counted in Tuesday's municipal election.
In Berkeley, a university city of 117,000 spread along
industrial Oakland's northern border, a student-backed
radical slate won only one of four open council seats,
falling one seat short of a takeover attempt of city
government begun two years ago.
But Berkeley voters approved several radical-sponsored
city statutes, including one designed to halt arrests of
marijuana users in the city.
Although Seale, 36, ran a distant second to the
55-year-old Reading and received less than half the votes
of the incumbent conservative business executive, he
topped the field of eight challengers to win a place on a
May 15 run-off ballot.
"The people made it clear to me that they want me to
unseat Reading," Seale said. "We made a strong showing
in relation to the nine other candidates."
"It is clear that we have not failed and that victory is
around me corner in May," he said in a prepared
statement. "I call upon all our fellow candidates and the
people to unite and win."
Despite the large turnout, Seale said 60,000 registered
voters didn't cast ballots. To win the run-off, he said the
Panthers will seek support from beaten candidates and try
to get more non-voters to the polls
City hall observers said before the election that the
best Se-ile rould hope for was to win a run-off with
Readir" But Seale had predicted that he would be swept

into office with an overwhelming majority.
Final, unofficial totals were Reading 55,342, or 49.92
percent, and Seale 21,314, or 19.26 percent. Otho Green,
a liberal black businessman ran third with 17,460 votes.
White councilman John Sutter, who was backed by
liberals and environmentalists, was fourth with 15,340.
Reading said he believes Seale has "pretty well peaked"
and won't gain more than 8,000 to 10,000 votes in the
run-off.
"He will pull some of Green's votes — half of them, or
25 percent," Reading added, predicting that he will defeat
Seale in the run-off by a two-to-one margin.
Hanoi Demands Leadership Change
SAIGON — Despite planned reforms in the Cambodian
government, North Vietnam made clear in a Radio Hanoi
broadcast yesterday that there can be no progress to peace
until President Lon Nol steps down.
Official Washington sources remained optimistic that
the reorganization might encourage cease-fire talks, but
observers in Phnom Penh tended to support the Hanoi
position.
Commenting on Lon Nol's announced plans to form a
new government that would include members of
opposition parties, Radio Hanoi said the reorganization
"is aimed at settling internal conflicts of the Lon Nol
puppet government which is deteriorating while
confronted with greater and greater military and political
defeats."
"Under American pressure," Radio Hanoi continued,
"Lon Nol has been forced to introduce a number of
so-called opposition elements into his cabinet so that it
may have a 'broader political base.'
"However reformed it may be, the Lon Nol puppet
government still remains an instrument of the U.S.
imperialists . .
The Radio Hanoi statements indicated that Cambodian
insurgents would continue a military drive in hopes of
forcing Lon Nol out.
Nixon Drops Oil Tariffs
WASHINGTON — President Nixon took steps yesterday
to stimulate increased imports of oil as well as greater
domestic production, in the face of a potential energy
crisis.
The President's energy message to Congress was greeted
with "disappointment" by the Consumer Federation of
America, and with pleasure by the American Petroleum
Institute, whose main complaint was that it did not adopt
all the energy industry's proposals.
Treasury Secretary George Shultz, the President's
principal energy adviser, told newsmen at a White House
briefing that energy costs will have to rise, but that
Nixon's proposals and actions would tend to restrain
those price increases.
"From the standpoint of the consumer," Shultz said,
"if all of these proposals are adopted, he and she will have
more energy at lower prices than they would if the
proposals were not adopted."
Nixon, using presidential authority, removed present
limits and eliminated present tariffs on oil imports,
effective next May 1, replacing them with a system of
import fees to be phased in over the next seven years.
Oil imports, now allocated under a quota system which
began in 1959, will continue to be allowed at the levels set
for 1973, free of any fee payment.
But the level of no-fee imports will be gradually
reduced until all oil imports are subject to fees by April
30,1980.
Imports above the no-fee levels will require fee
payments depending on the type of import, with a higher
fee on refined products than on crude oil.

Peking To Open Liason Office
WASHINGTON — A 10-man delegation from the People's
Republic of China arrived yesterday to open a liason
office here, ending a 23-year diplomatic void with the
United States.
The smiling, hand-shaking group was met at Dulles
International Airport by a five-man delegation from the
State Dept. and representatives of several embassies.
Han Hsu, deputy chief of the Chinese liason office,
told a welcoming delegation of five Chinese from the
Washington area that "we want to express our thanks to
all Chinese-Americans and our warm greetings to all of our
American friends."
Among the official State Department greeters was John
Holdridge of the National Security Council, who is the
counterpart of Han Hsu. Holdridge will be deputy director
of the new U.S. liason office in Peking.
Noticeable for their absence were representatives from
the Soviet Union.
The Chinese have been given full diplomatic privileges
for their liaison mission here. American officials were
seeing to it that the Chinese group received every
attention, even though there is no diplomatic tie linking
the two governments.
U.S. Ambassador to Peking David K.E. Bruce is
expected to leave for China in early May. His Chinese
counterpart, Huang Chen, also is expected to arrive here
next month.
Meany Charges "Union Busting 9
WASHINGTON — AFL-CIO President George Meany
accused the Teamsters of "union busting" in taking over
California field worker contracts, and pledged full support
yesterday to Cesar Chavez' United Farm Workers union.
Meany said the Teamsters, in collusion with the
growers, were trying to wipe out Chavez' rival AFL-CIO
affiliated union.
"The Teamsters' union busting drive would be
absolutely disgraceful under any circumstances," Meany
complained in a statement. "But for the nation's largest
union to seek to destroy this smaller union representing
some of the most exploited workers in the nation is
intolerable."
The AFL-CIO leader joined Chavez' plea for a
congressional investigation of alleged illegal payoffs to the
Teamsters, and said he was sending the federation's top
organizer back to California "to give the farmworkers all
the assistance we can provide."
The payoffs being alleged are from growers to
Teamsters, inducing the Teamsters to organize in
competition with the UFW.
The bitter inter-union dispute also will be brought
before the AFL-CIO executive council next month to

discuss what further measures can be taken, Meany said.
Teamsters President Frank Fitzsimmons branded the
payoff charges "absolutely ridiculous and unfounded."
The battle lines were drawn Sunday when the
Teamsters announced they had signed contracts with
grape growers in California's Coachella Valley covering
5,500 workers whose contract with the UFW expired.
Soviets Drop Jewish Exit Tax
WASHINGTON — The Soviet Union has told the White
House it has suspended indefinitely the collection of
heavy education taxes applied to Jews leaving the
country, Senate Republican Leader Hugh Scott said
yesterday.
Scott said Congress should be satisfied with the
suspension of the controversial exit tax. He warned that
further steps to penalize the Soviets by passing restrictive
trade legislation could endanger newly improved relations.
Critics of the Soviet Union's exit tax said they were
not satisfied.
They questioned the good faith of the Soviet Union
and said they would press for passage of an amendment
by Sen. Henry M. Jackson (D-Wash.), denying
"most-favored-nation" treatment to the Soviet Union if
President Nixon does not periodically certify that the exit
tax has ceased to apply.
Scott said he got his news from Henry A. Kissinger,
President Nixon's foreign policy adviser.
Oklahoma Forfeits Football Games
NORMAN, Okla. — Recruiting irregularities have forced
the University of Oklahoma to forfeit nine of the 12
football games the second-ranked Sooners played last
season — including the Sugar Bowl victory over Penn
State.
And Oklahoma officials said yesterday that Kerry
Jackson, the first string quarterback of the Sooners' spring
drills, would be ineligible for next season and that
offensive line coach Bill Michael had resigned.
The forfeiture and resignation came after Big Eight
conference officials verified that the transcripts of
Jackson and Mike Phillips, both from Ball High School in
Galveston, Tex., had been tampered with, Oklahoma
Athletic Director Wade Walker said.
Walker said Michael had admitted having knowledge of
the tampering of Jackson's transcript. He said Jackson
stayed two nights in an OU athletic dormitory as a high
school student — a violation of conference regulations.

Fair through tomorrow. Low both nights in the 40s. High

Soviets Drop Jewish Exit Tax
WASHINGTON — The Soviet Union has told the White
House it has suspended indefinitely the collection of
heavy education taxes applied to Jews leaving the
country, Senate Republican Leader Hugh Scott said
yesterday.
Scott said Congress should be satisfied with the
suspension of the controversial exit tax. He warned that
further steps to penalize the Soviets by passing restrictive
trade legislation could endanger newly improved relations.
Critics of the Soviet Union's exit tax said they were
not satisfied.
They questioned the good faith of the Soviet Union
and said they would press for passage of an amendment
by Sen. Henry M. Jackson (D-Wash.), denying
"most-favored-nation" treatment to the Soviet Union if
President Nixon does not periodically certify that the exit
tax has ceased to apply.
Scott said he got his news from Henry A. Kissinger,
President Nixon's foreign policy adviser.
Oklahoma Forfeits Football Games
NORMAN, Okla. — Recruiting irregularities have forced
the University of Oklahoma to forfeit nine of the 12
football games the second-ranked Sooners played last
season — including the Sugar Bowl victory over Penn
State.
And Oklahoma officials said yesterday that Kerry
Jackson, the first string quarterback of the Sooners' spring
drills, would be ineligible for next season and that
offensive line coach Bill Michael had resigned.
The forfeiture and resignation came after Big Eight
conference officials verified that the transcripts of
Jackson and Mike Phillips, both from Ball High School in
Galveston, Tex., had been tampered with, Oklahoma
Athletic Director Wade Walker said.
Walker said Michael had admitted having knowledge of
the tampering of Jackson's transcript. He said Jackson
stayed two nights in an OU athletic dormitory as a high
school student — a violation of conference regulations.
Today's Weather
Fair through tomorrow. Low both nights in the 40s. High
today and tomorrow in the mid 60s to low 70s. North to
Northwest winds 15 to 30 mph.
Ellsberg Claims 'War Crimes'
LOS ANGELES — Daniel Ellsberg told jurors yesterday
that the Pentagon papers reveal possible American "war
crimes" in Vietnam, "some of which, I regret to say, I
participated in myself."
Ellsberg said that high U.S. officials planned to break
the Geneva peace accords of 1954 and probably
committed "a crime against the peace. .. under the
Nuremberg principles, as I understand them."
Asst. U.S. Atty. David Nissen raised the "war crimes"
question after U.S. District Judge Matt Byrne barred
asking Ellsberg whether he believed he had broken the law
when he copied the Pentagon study.
The prosecutor apparently was seeking to show that
Ellsberg did not support the policies of his own country
and acted against the country's best interests when he
published the papers.
Ellsberg and Anthony J. Russo are charged with
espionage, conspiracy and theft in connection with the
copying, and distribution of the documents known as the
Pentagon Papers.
Ellsberg, 42, once an adviser to government officials,
stressed that the men making war decisions probably were
"patriots" who meant only the best for their country but
ended by doing the w
"I knew all the time," he said, "that the people I
worked for and with were patriotic men, sometimes the
best of this country."
Segments of the Pentagon papers read to jurors showed
that U.S. agents helped plan a 1963 coup against South
Vietnamese President Ngo Dinh Diem, who was
assassinated.
"In the 1964-65 period," Ellsberg said, speaking
directly to jurors, "the planning documents are evidence
of direct operations against North Vietnam, a country not
at war with us." He called this illegal intervention.
Incumbents Lead Local Elections
OAKLAND, Calif. — Black Panther chairman Bobby
Seale's political career is off to a shaky start — saved from
an early conclusion by a scant 84 votes in a nine-way race
for Oakland mayor.
Those 84 votes were the margin by which white
incumbent Mayor John Reading failed to win a majority
of 110,851 votes counted in Tuesday's municipal election.
In Berkeley, a university city of 117,000 spread along
industrial Oakland's northern border, a student-backed
radical slate won only one of four open council seats,
falling one seat short of a takeover attempt of city
government begun two years ago.
But Berkeley voters approved several radical-sponsored
city statutes, including one designed to halt arrests of
marijuana users in the city.
Although Seale, 36, ran a distant second to the
55-year-old Reading and received less than half the votes
of the incumbent conservative business executive, he
topped the field of eight challengers to win a place on a
May 15 run-off ballot.
"The people made it clear to me that they want me to
unseat Reading," Seale said. "We made a strong showing
in relation to the nine other candidates."
"It is clear that we have not failed and that victory is
around me corner in May," he said in a prepared
statement. "I call upon all our fellow candidates and the
people to unite and win."
Despite the large turnout, Seale said 60,000 registered
voters didn't cast ballots. To win the run-off, he said the
Panthers will seek support from beaten candidates and try
to get more non-voters to the polls
City hall observers said before the election that the
best Se-ile rould hope for was to win a run-off with
Readir" But Seale had predicted that he would be swept

into office with an overwhelming majority.
Final, unofficial totals were Reading 55,342, or 49.92
percent, and Seale 21,314, or 19.26 percent. Otho Green,
a liberal black businessman ran third with 17,460 votes.
White councilman John Sutter, who was backed by
liberals and environmentalists, was fourth with 15,340.
Reading said he believes Seale has "pretty well peaked"
and won't gain more than 8,000 to 10,000 votes in the
run-off.
"He will pull some of Green's votes — half of them, or
25 percent," Reading added, predicting that he will defeat
Seale in the run-off by a two-to-one margin.
Hanoi Demands Leadership Change
SAIGON — Despite planned reforms in the Cambodian
government, North Vietnam made clear in a Radio Hanoi
broadcast yesterday that there can be no progress to peace
until President Lon Nol steps down.
Official Washington sources remained optimistic that
the reorganization might encourage cease-fire talks, but
observers in Phnom Penh tended to support the Hanoi
position.
Commenting on Lon Nol's announced plans to form a
new government that would include members of
opposition parties, Radio Hanoi said the reorganization
"is aimed at settling internal conflicts of the Lon Nol
puppet government which is deteriorating while
confronted with greater and greater military and political
defeats."
"Under American pressure," Radio Hanoi continued,
"Lon Nol has been forced to introduce a number of
so-called opposition elements into his cabinet so that it
may have a 'broader political base.'
"However reformed it may be, the Lon Nol puppet
government still remains an instrument of the U.S.
imperialists . .
The Radio Hanoi statements indicated that Cambodian
insurgents would continue a military drive in hopes of
forcing Lon Nol out.
Nixon Drops Oil Tariffs
WASHINGTON — President Nixon took steps yesterday
to stimulate increased imports of oil as well as greater
domestic production, in the face of a potential energy
crisis.
The President's energy message to Congress was greeted
with "disappointment" by the Consumer Federation of
America, and with pleasure by the American Petroleum
Institute, whose main complaint was that it did not adopt
all the energy industry's proposals.
Treasury Secretary George Shultz, the President's
principal energy adviser, told newsmen at a White House
briefing that energy costs will have to rise, but that
Nixon's proposals and actions would tend to restrain
those price increases.
"From the standpoint of the consumer," Shultz said,
"if all of these proposals are adopted, he and she will have
more energy at lower prices than they would if the
proposals were not adopted."
Nixon, using presidential authority, removed present
limits and eliminated present tariffs on oil imports,
effective next May 1, replacing them with a system of
import fees to be phased in over the next seven years.
Oil imports, now allocated under a quota system which
began in 1959, will continue to be allowed at the levels set
for 1973, free of any fee payment.
But the level of no-fee imports will be gradually
reduced until all oil imports are subject to fees by April
30,1980.
Imports above the no-fee levels will require fee
payments depending on the type of import, with a higher
fee on refined products than on crude oil.

Peking To Open Liason Office
WASHINGTON — A 10-man delegation from the People's
Republic of China arrived yesterday to open a liason
office here, ending a 23-year diplomatic void with the
United States.
The smiling, hand-shaking group was met at Dulles
International Airport by a five-man delegation from the
State Dept. and representatives of several embassies.
Han Hsu, deputy chief of the Chinese liason office,
told a welcoming delegation of five Chinese from the
Washington area that "we want to express our thanks to
all Chinese-Americans and our warm greetings to all of our
American friends."
Among the official State Department greeters was John
Holdridge of the National Security Council, who is the
counterpart of Han Hsu. Holdridge will be deputy director
of the new U.S. liason office in Peking.
Noticeable for their absence were representatives from
the Soviet Union.
The Chinese have been given full diplomatic privileges
for their liaison mission here. American officials were
seeing to it that the Chinese group received every
attention, even though there is no diplomatic tie linking
the two governments.
U.S. Ambassador to Peking David K.E. Bruce is
expected to leave for China in early May. His Chinese
counterpart, Huang Chen, also is expected to arrive here
next month.
Meany Charges "Union Busting 9
WASHINGTON — AFL-CIO President George Meany
accused the Teamsters of "union busting" in taking over
California field worker contracts, and pledged full support
yesterday to Cesar Chavez' United Farm Workers union.
Meany said the Teamsters, in collusion with the
growers, were trying to wipe out Chavez' rival AFL-CIO
affiliated union.
"The Teamsters' union busting drive would be
absolutely disgraceful under any circumstances," Meany
complained in a statement. "But for the nation's largest
union to seek to destroy this smaller union representing
some of the most exploited workers in the nation is
intolerable."
The AFL-CIO leader joined Chavez' plea for a
congressional investigation of alleged illegal payoffs to the
Teamsters, and said he was sending the federation's top
organizer back to California "to give the farmworkers all
the assistance we can provide."
The payoffs being alleged are from growers to
Teamsters, inducing the Teamsters to organize in
competition with the UFW.
The bitter inter-union dispute also will be brought
before the AFL-CIO executive council next month to

discuss what further measures can be taken, Meany said.
Teamsters President Frank Fitzsimmons branded the
payoff charges "absolutely ridiculous and unfounded."
The battle lines were drawn Sunday when the
Teamsters announced they had signed contracts with
grape growers in California's Coachella Valley covering
5,500 workers whose contract with the UFW expired.

Among the official State Department greeters was John
Holdridge of the National Security Council, who is the
counterpart of Han Hsu. Holdridge will be deputy director
of the new U.S. liason office in Peking.
Noticeable for their absence were representatives from
the Soviet Union.
The Chinese have been given full diplomatic privileges
for their liaison mission here. American officials were
seeing to it that the Chinese group received every
attention, even though there is no diplomatic tie linking
the two governments.
U.S. Ambassador to Peking David K.E. Bruce is
expected to leave for China in early May. His Chinese
counterpart, Huang Chen, also is expected to arrive here
next month.
Meany Charges "Union Busting 9
WASHINGTON — AFL-CIO President George Meany
accused the Teamsters of "union busting" in taking over
California field worker contracts, and pledged full support
yesterday to Cesar Chavez' United Farm Workers union.
Meany said the Teamsters, in collusion with the
growers, were trying to wipe out Chavez' rival AFL-CIO
affiliated union.
"The Teamsters' union busting drive would be
absolutely disgraceful under any circumstances," Meany
complained in a statement. "But for the nation's largest
union to seek to destroy this smaller union representing
some of the most exploited workers in the nation is
intolerable."
The AFL-CIO leader joined Chavez' plea for a
congressional investigation of alleged illegal payoffs to the
Teamsters, and said he was sending the federation's top
organizer back to California "to give the farmworkers all
the assistance we can provide."
The payoffs being alleged are from growers to
Teamsters, inducing the Teamsters to organize in
competition with the UFW.
The bitter inter-union dispute also will be brought
before the AFL-CIO executive council next month to

discuss what further measures can be taken, Meany said.
Teamsters President Frank Fitzsimmons branded the
payoff charges "absolutely ridiculous and unfounded."
The battle lines were drawn Sunday when the
Teamsters announced they had signed contracts with
grape growers in California's Coachella Valley covering
5,500 workers whose contract with the UFW expired.
Soviets Drop Jewish Exit Tax
WASHINGTON — The Soviet Union has told the White
House it has suspended indefinitely the collection of
heavy education taxes applied to Jews leaving the
country, Senate Republican Leader Hugh Scott said
yesterday.
Scott said Congress should be satisfied with the
suspension of the controversial exit tax. He warned that
further steps to penalize the Soviets by passing restrictive
trade legislation could endanger newly improved relations.
Critics of the Soviet Union's exit tax said they were
not satisfied.
They questioned the good faith of the Soviet Union
and said they would press for passage of an amendment
by Sen. Henry M. Jackson (D-Wash.), denying
"most-favored-nation" treatment to the Soviet Union if
President Nixon does not periodically certify that the exit
tax has ceased to apply.
Scott said he got his news from Henry A. Kissinger,
President Nixon's foreign policy adviser.
Oklahoma Forfeits Football Games
NORMAN, Okla. — Recruiting irregularities have forced
the University of Oklahoma to forfeit nine of the 12
football games the second-ranked Sooners played last
season — including the Sugar Bowl victory over Penn
State.
And Oklahoma officials said yesterday that Kerry
Jackson, the first string quarterback of the Sooners' spring
drills, would be ineligible for next season and that
offensive line coach Bill Michael had resigned.
The forfeiture and resignation came after Big Eight
conference officials verified that the transcripts of
Jackson and Mike Phillips, both from Ball High School in
Galveston, Tex., had been tampered with, Oklahoma
Athletic Director Wade Walker said.
Walker said Michael had admitted having knowledge of
the tampering of Jackson's transcript. He said Jackson
stayed two nights in an OU athletic dormitory as a high
school student — a violation of conference regulations.

Ellsberg Claims 'War Crimes'
LOS ANGELES — Daniel Ellsberg told jurors yesterday
that the Pentagon papers reveal possible American "war
crimes" in Vietnam, "some of which, I regret to say, I
participated in myself."
Ellsberg said that high U.S. officials planned to break
the Geneva peace accords of 1954 and probably
committed "a crime against the peace. .. under the
Nuremberg principles, as I understand them."
Asst. U.S. Atty. David Nissen raised the "war crimes"
question after U.S. District Judge Matt Byrne barred
asking Ellsberg whether he believed he had broken the law
when he copied the Pentagon study.
The prosecutor apparently was seeking to show that
Ellsberg did not support the policies of his own country
and acted against the country's best interests when he
published the papers.
Ellsberg and Anthony J. Russo are charged with
espionage, conspiracy and theft in connection with the
copying, and distribution of the documents known as the
Pentagon Papers.
Ellsberg, 42, once an adviser to government officials,
stressed that the men making war decisions probably were
"patriots" who meant only the best for their country but
ended by doing the w
"I knew all the time," he said, "that the people I
worked for and with were patriotic men, sometimes the
best of this country."
Segments of the Pentagon papers read to jurors showed
that U.S. agents helped plan a 1963 coup against South
Vietnamese President Ngo Dinh Diem, who was
assassinated.
"In the 1964-65 period," Ellsberg said, speaking
directly to jurors, "the planning documents are evidence
of direct operations against North Vietnam, a country not
at war with us." He called this illegal intervention.
Incumbents Lead Local Elections
OAKLAND, Calif. — Black Panther chairman Bobby
Seale's political career is off to a shaky start — saved from
an early conclusion by a scant 84 votes in a nine-way race
for Oakland mayor.
Those 84 votes were the margin by which white
incumbent Mayor John Reading failed to win a majority
of 110,851 votes counted in Tuesday's municipal election.
In Berkeley, a university city of 117,000 spread along
industrial Oakland's northern border, a student-backed
radical slate won only one of four open council seats,
falling one seat short of a takeover attempt of city
government begun two years ago.
But Berkeley voters approved several radical-sponsored
city statutes, including one designed to halt arrests of
marijuana users in the city.
Although Seale, 36, ran a distant second to the
55-year-old Reading and received less than half the votes
of the incumbent conservative business executive, he
topped the field of eight challengers to win a place on a
May 15 run-off ballot.
"The people made it clear to me that they want me to
unseat Reading," Seale said. "We made a strong showing
in relation to the nine other candidates."
"It is clear that we have not failed and that victory is
around me corner in May," he said in a prepared
statement. "I call upon all our fellow candidates and the
people to unite and win."
Despite the large turnout, Seale said 60,000 registered
voters didn't cast ballots. To win the run-off, he said the
Panthers will seek support from beaten candidates and try
to get more non-voters to the polls
City hall observers said before the election that the
best Se-ile rould hope for was to win a run-off with
Readir" But Seale had predicted that he would be swept

into office with an overwhelming majority.
Final, unofficial totals were Reading 55,342, or 49.92
percent, and Seale 21,314, or 19.26 percent. Otho Green,
a liberal black businessman ran third with 17,460 votes.
White councilman John Sutter, who was backed by
liberals and environmentalists, was fourth with 15,340.
Reading said he believes Seale has "pretty well peaked"
and won't gain more than 8,000 to 10,000 votes in the
run-off.
"He will pull some of Green's votes — half of them, or
25 percent," Reading added, predicting that he will defeat
Seale in the run-off by a two-to-one margin.
Hanoi Demands Leadership Change
SAIGON — Despite planned reforms in the Cambodian
government, North Vietnam made clear in a Radio Hanoi
broadcast yesterday that there can be no progress to peace
until President Lon Nol steps down.
Official Washington sources remained optimistic that
the reorganization might encourage cease-fire talks, but
observers in Phnom Penh tended to support the Hanoi
position.
Commenting on Lon Nol's announced plans to form a
new government that would include members of
opposition parties, Radio Hanoi said the reorganization
"is aimed at settling internal conflicts of the Lon Nol
puppet government which is deteriorating while
confronted with greater and greater military and political
defeats."
"Under American pressure," Radio Hanoi continued,
"Lon Nol has been forced to introduce a number of
so-called opposition elements into his cabinet so that it
may have a 'broader political base.'
"However reformed it may be, the Lon Nol puppet
government still remains an instrument of the U.S.
imperialists . .
The Radio Hanoi statements indicated that Cambodian
insurgents would continue a military drive in hopes of
forcing Lon Nol out.
Nixon Drops Oil Tariffs
WASHINGTON — President Nixon took steps yesterday
to stimulate increased imports of oil as well as greater
domestic production, in the face of a potential energy
crisis.
The President's energy message to Congress was greeted
with "disappointment" by the Consumer Federation of
America, and with pleasure by the American Petroleum
Institute, whose main complaint was that it did not adopt
all the energy industry's proposals.
Treasury Secretary George Shultz, the President's
principal energy adviser, told newsmen at a White House
briefing that energy costs will have to rise, but that
Nixon's proposals and actions would tend to restrain
those price increases.
"From the standpoint of the consumer," Shultz said,
"if all of these proposals are adopted, he and she will have
more energy at lower prices than they would if the
proposals were not adopted."
Nixon, using presidential authority, removed present
limits and eliminated present tariffs on oil imports,
effective next May 1, replacing them with a system of
import fees to be phased in over the next seven years.
Oil imports, now allocated under a quota system which
began in 1959, will continue to be allowed at the levels set
for 1973, free of any fee payment.
But the level of no-fee imports will be gradually
reduced until all oil imports are subject to fees by April
30,1980.
Imports above the no-fee levels will require fee
payments depending on the type of import, with a higher
fee on refined products than on crude oil.

Peking To Open Liason Office
WASHINGTON — A 10-man delegation from the People's
Republic of China arrived yesterday to open a liason
office here, ending a 23-year diplomatic void with the
United States.
The smiling, hand-shaking group was met at Dulles
International Airport by a five-man delegation from the
State Dept. and representatives of several embassies.
Han Hsu, deputy chief of the Chinese liason office,
told a welcoming delegation of five Chinese from the
Washington area that "we want to express our thanks to
all Chinese-Americans and our warm greetings to all of our
American friends."
Among the official State Department greeters was John
Holdridge of the National Security Council, who is the

domestic production, in the face of a potential energy
crisis.
The President's energy message to Congress was greeted
with "disappointment" by the Consumer Federation of
America, and with pleasure by the American Petroleum
Institute, whose main complaint was that it did not adopt
all the energy industry's proposals.
Treasury Secretary George Shultz, the President's
principal energy adviser, told newsmen at a White House
briefing that energy costs will have to rise, but that
Nixon's proposals and actions would tend to restrain
those price increases.
"From the standpoint of the consumer," Shultz said,
"if all of these proposals are adopted, he and she will have
more energy at lower prices than they would if the
proposals were not adopted."
Nixon, using presidential authority, removed present
limits and eliminated present tariffs on oil imports,
effective next May 1, replacing them with a system of
import fees to be phased in over the next seven years.
Oil imports, now allocated under a quota system which
began in 1959, will continue to be allowed at the levels set
for 1973, free of any fee payment.
But the level of no-fee imports will be gradually
reduced until all oil imports are subject to fees by April
30,1980.
Imports above the no-fee levels will require fee
payments depending on the type of import, with a higher
fee on refined products than on crude oil.

Peking To Open Liason Office
WASHINGTON — A 10-man delegation from the People's
Republic of China arrived yesterday to open a liason
office here, ending a 23-year diplomatic void with the
United States.
The smiling, hand-shaking group was met at Dulles
International Airport by a five-man delegation from the
State Dept. and representatives of several embassies.
Han Hsu, deputy chief of the Chinese liason office,
told a welcoming delegation of five Chinese from the
Washington area that "we want to express our thanks to
all Chinese-Americans and our warm greetings to all of our
American friends."
Among the official State Department greeters was John
Holdridge of the National Security Council, who is the
counterpart of Han Hsu. Holdridge will be deputy director
of the new U.S. liason office in Peking.
Noticeable for their absence were representatives from
the Soviet Union.
The Chinese have been given full diplomatic privileges
for their liaison mission here. American officials were
seeing to it that the Chinese group received every
attention, even though there is no diplomatic tie linking
the two governments.
U.S. Ambassador to Peking David K.E. Bruce is
expected to leave for China in early May. His Chinese
counterpart, Huang Chen, also is expected to arrive here
next month.
Meany Charges "Union Busting 9
WASHINGTON — AFL-CIO President George Meany
accused the Teamsters of "union busting" in taking over
California field worker contracts, and pledged full support
yesterday to Cesar Chavez' United Farm Workers union.
Meany said the Teamsters, in collusion with the
growers, were trying to wipe out Chavez' rival AFL-CIO
affiliated union.
"The Teamsters' union busting drive would be
absolutely disgraceful under any circumstances," Meany
complained in a statement. "But for the nation's largest
union to seek to destroy this smaller union representing
some of the most exploited workers in the nation is
intolerable."
The AFL-CIO leader joined Chavez' plea for a
congressional investigation of alleged illegal payoffs to the
Teamsters, and said he was sending the federation's top
organizer back to California "to give the farmworkers all
the assistance we can provide."
The payoffs being alleged are from growers to
Teamsters, inducing the Teamsters to organize in
competition with the UFW.
The bitter inter-union dispute also will be brought
before the AFL-CIO executive council next month to

discuss what further measures can be taken, Meany said.
Teamsters President Frank Fitzsimmons branded the
payoff charges "absolutely ridiculous and unfounded."
The battle lines were drawn Sunday when the
Teamsters announced they had signed contracts with
grape growers in California's Coachella Valley covering
5,500 workers whose contract with the UFW expired.
Soviets Drop Jewish Exit Tax
WASHINGTON — The Soviet Union has told the White
House it has suspended indefinitely the collection of
heavy education taxes applied to Jews leaving the
country, Senate Republican Leader Hugh Scott said
yesterday.
Scott said Congress should be satisfied with the
suspension of the controversial exit tax. He warned that
further steps to penalize the Soviets by passing restrictive
trade legislation could endanger newly improved relations.
Critics of the Soviet Union's exit tax said they were
not satisfied.
They questioned the good faith of the Soviet Union
and said they would press for passage of an amendment
by Sen. Henry M. Jackson (D-Wash.), denying
"most-favored-nation" treatment to the Soviet Union if
President Nixon does not periodically certify that the exit
tax has ceased to apply.
Scott said he got his news from Henry A. Kissinger,
President Nixon's foreign policy adviser.
Oklahoma Forfeits Football Games
NORMAN, Okla. — Recruiting irregularities have forced
the University of Oklahoma to forfeit nine of the 12
football games the second-ranked Sooners played last
season — including the Sugar Bowl victory over Penn
State.
And Oklahoma officials said yesterday that Kerry
Jackson, the first string quarterback of the Sooners' spring
drills, would be ineligible for next season and that
offensive line coach Bill Michael had resigned.
The forfeiture and resignation came after Big Eight
conference officials verified that the transcripts of
Jackson and Mike Phillips, both from Ball High School in
Galveston, Tex., had been tampered with, Oklahoma
Athletic Director Wade Walker said.
Walker said Michael had admitted having knowledge of
the tampering of Jackson's transcript. He said Jackson
stayed two nights in an OU athletic dormitory as a high
school student — a violation of conference regulations.

Ellsberg Claims 'War Crimes'
LOS ANGELES — Daniel Ellsberg told jurors yesterday
that the Pentagon papers reveal possible American "war
crimes" in Vietnam, "some of which, I regret to say, I
participated in myself."
Ellsberg said that high U.S. officials planned to break
the Geneva peace accords of 1954 and probably
committed "a crime against the peace. .. under the
Nuremberg principles, as I understand them."
Asst. U.S. Atty. David Nissen raised the "war crimes"
question after U.S. District Judge Matt Byrne barred
asking Ellsberg whether he believed he had broken the law
when he copied the Pentagon study.
The prosecutor apparently was seeking to show that
Ellsberg did not support the policies of his own country
and acted against the country's best interests when he
published the papers.
Ellsberg and Anthony J. Russo are charged with
espionage, conspiracy and theft in connection with the
copying, and distribution of the documents known as the
Pentagon Papers.
Ellsberg, 42, once an adviser to government officials,
stressed that the men making war decisions probably were
"patriots" who meant only the best for their country but
ended by doing the w
"I knew all the time," he said, "that the people I
worked for and with were patriotic men, sometimes the
best of this country."
Segments of the Pentagon papers read to jurors showed
that U.S. agents helped plan a 1963 coup against South
Vietnamese President Ngo Dinh Diem, who was
assassinated.
"In the 1964-65 period," Ellsberg said, speaking
directly to jurors, "the planning documents are evidence
of direct operations against North Vietnam, a country not
at war with us." He called this illegal intervention.
Incumbents Lead Local Elections
OAKLAND, Calif. — Black Panther chairman Bobby
Seale's political career is off to a shaky start — saved from
an early conclusion by a scant 84 votes in a nine-way race
for Oakland mayor.
Those 84 votes were the margin by which white
incumbent Mayor John Reading failed to win a majority
of 110,851 votes counted in Tuesday's municipal election.
In Berkeley, a university city of 117,000 spread along
industrial Oakland's northern border, a student-backed
radical slate won only one of four open council seats,
falling one seat short of a takeover attempt of city
government begun two years ago.
But Berkeley voters approved several radical-sponsored
city statutes, including one designed to halt arrests of
marijuana users in the city.
Although Seale, 36, ran a distant second to the
55-year-old Reading and received less than half the votes
of the incumbent conservative business executive, he
topped the field of eight challengers to win a place on a
May 15 run-off ballot.
"The people made it clear to me that they want me to
unseat Reading," Seale said. "We made a strong showing
in relation to the nine other candidates."
"It is clear that we have not failed and that victory is
around me corner in May," he said in a prepared
statement. "I call upon all our fellow candidates and the
people to unite and win."
Despite the large turnout, Seale said 60,000 registered
voters didn't cast ballots. To win the run-off, he said the
Panthers will seek support from beaten candidates and try
to get more non-voters to the polls
City hall observers said before the election that the
best Se-ile rould hope for was to win a run-off with
Readir" But Seale had predicted that he would be swept

into office with an overwhelming majority.
Final, unofficial totals were Reading 55,342, or 49.92
percent, and Seale 21,314, or 19.26 percent. Otho Green,
a liberal black businessman ran third with 17,460 votes.
White councilman John Sutter, who was backed by
liberals and environmentalists, was fourth with 15,340.
Reading said he believes Seale has "pretty well peaked"
and won't gain more than 8,000 to 10,000 votes in the
run-off.
"He will pull some of Green's votes — half of them, or
25 percent," Reading added, predicting that he will defeat
Seale in the run-off by a two-to-one margin.
Hanoi Demands Leadership Change
SAIGON — Despite planned reforms in the Cambodian
government, North Vietnam made clear in a Radio Hanoi
broadcast yesterday that there can be no progress to peace
until President Lon Nol steps down.
Official Washington sources remained optimistic that
the reorganization might encourage cease-fire talks, but
observers in Phnom Penh tended to support the Hanoi
position.
Commenting on Lon Nol's announced plans to form a
new government that would include members of
opposition parties, Radio Hanoi said the reorganization
"is aimed at settling internal conflicts of the Lon Nol
puppet government which is deteriorating while
confronted with greater and greater military and political
defeats."
"Under American pressure," Radio Hanoi continued,
"Lon Nol has been forced to introduce a number of
so-called opposition elements into his cabinet so that it
may have a 'broader political base.'
"However reformed it may be, the Lon Nol puppet
government still remains an instrument of the U.S.
imperialists . .
The Radio Hanoi statements indicated that Cambodian
insurgents would continue a military drive in hopes of
forcing Lon Nol out.

into office with an overwhelming majority.
Final, unofficial totals were Reading 55,342, or 49.92
percent, and Seale 21,314, or 19.26 percent. Otho Green,
a liberal black businessman ran third with 17,460 votes.
White councilman John Sutter, who was backed by
liberals and environmentalists, was fourth with 15,340.
Reading said he believes Seale has "pretty well peaked"
and won't gain more than 8,000 to 10,000 votes in the
run-off.
"He will pull some of Green's votes — half of them, or
25 percent," Reading added, predicting that he will defeat
Seale in the run-off by a two-to-one margin.
Hanoi Demands Leadership Change
SAIGON — Despite planned reforms in the Cambodian
government, North Vietnam made clear in a Radio Hanoi
broadcast yesterday that there can be no progress to peace
until President Lon Nol steps down.
Official Washington sources remained optimistic that
the reorganization might encourage cease-fire talks, but
observers in Phnom Penh tended to support the Hanoi
position.
Commenting on Lon Nol's announced plans to form a
new government that would include members of
opposition parties, Radio Hanoi said the reorganization
"is aimed at settling internal conflicts of the Lon Nol
puppet government which is deteriorating while
confronted with greater and greater military and political
defeats."
"Under American pressure," Radio Hanoi continued,
"Lon Nol has been forced to introduce a number of
so-called opposition elements into his cabinet so that it
may have a 'broader political base.'
"However reformed it may be, the Lon Nol puppet
government still remains an instrument of the U.S.
imperialists . .
The Radio Hanoi statements indicated that Cambodian
insurgents would continue a military drive in hopes of
forcing Lon Nol out.
Nixon Drops Oil Tariffs
WASHINGTON — President Nixon took steps yesterday
to stimulate increased imports of oil as well as greater
domestic production, in the face of a potential energy
crisis.
The President's energy message to Congress was greeted
with "disappointment" by the Consumer Federation of
America, and with pleasure by the American Petroleum
Institute, whose main complaint was that it did not adopt
all the energy industry's proposals.
Treasury Secretary George Shultz, the President's
principal energy adviser, told newsmen at a White House
briefing that energy costs will have to rise, but that
Nixon's proposals and actions would tend to restrain
those price increases.
"From the standpoint of the consumer," Shultz said,
"if all of these proposals are adopted, he and she will have
more energy at lower prices than they would if the
proposals were not adopted."
Nixon, using presidential authority, removed present
limits and eliminated present tariffs on oil imports,
effective next May 1, replacing them with a system of
import fees to be phased in over the next seven years.
Oil imports, now allocated under a quota system which
began in 1959, will continue to be allowed at the levels set
for 1973, free of any fee payment.
But the level of no-fee imports will be gradually
reduced until all oil imports are subject to fees by April
30,1980.
Imports above the no-fee levels will require fee
payments depending on the type of import, with a higher
fee on refined products than on crude oil.

Peking To Open Liason Office
WASHINGTON — A 10-man delegation from the People's
Republic of China arrived yesterday to open a liason
office here, ending a 23-year diplomatic void with the
United States.
The smiling, hand-shaking group was met at Dulles
International Airport by a five-man delegation from the
State Dept. and representatives of several embassies.
Han Hsu, deputy chief of the Chinese liason office,
told a welcoming delegation of five Chinese from the
Washington area that "we want to express our thanks to
all Chinese-Americans and our warm greetings to all of our
American friends."
Among the official State Department greeters was John
Holdridge of the National Security Council, who is the
counterpart of Han Hsu. Holdridge will be deputy director
of the new U.S. liason office in Peking.
Noticeable for their absence were representatives from
the Soviet Union.
The Chinese have been given full diplomatic privileges
for their liaison mission here. American officials were
seeing to it that the Chinese group received every
attention, even though there is no diplomatic tie linking
the two governments.
U.S. Ambassador to Peking David K.E. Bruce is
expected to leave for China in early May. His Chinese
counterpart, Huang Chen, also is expected to arrive here
next month.
Meany Charges "Union Busting 9
WASHINGTON — AFL-CIO President George Meany
accused the Teamsters of "union busting" in taking over
California field worker contracts, and pledged full support
yesterday to Cesar Chavez' United Farm Workers union.
Meany said the Teamsters, in collusion with the
growers, were trying to wipe out Chavez' rival AFL-CIO
affiliated union.
"The Teamsters' union busting drive would be
absolutely disgraceful under any circumstances," Meany
complained in a statement. "But for the nation's largest
union to seek to destroy this smaller union representing
some of the most exploited workers in the nation is
intolerable."
The AFL-CIO leader joined Chavez' plea for a
congressional investigation of alleged illegal payoffs to the
Teamsters, and said he was sending the federation's top
organizer back to California "to give the farmworkers all
the assistance we can provide."
The payoffs being alleged are from growers to
Teamsters, inducing the Teamsters to organize in
competition with the UFW.
The bitter inter-union dispute also will be brought
before the AFL-CIO executive council next month to

discuss what further measures can be taken, Meany said.
Teamsters President Frank Fitzsimmons branded the
payoff charges "absolutely ridiculous and unfounded."
The battle lines were drawn Sunday when the
Teamsters announced they had signed contracts with
grape growers in California's Coachella Valley covering
5,500 workers whose contract with the UFW expired.
Soviets Drop Jewish Exit Tax
WASHINGTON — The Soviet Union has told the White
House it has suspended indefinitely the collection of
heavy education taxes applied to Jews leaving the
country, Senate Republican Leader Hugh Scott said
yesterday.
Scott said Congress should be satisfied with the
suspension of the controversial exit tax. He warned that
further steps to penalize the Soviets by passing restrictive
trade legislation could endanger newly improved relations.
Critics of the Soviet Union's exit tax said they were
not satisfied.
They questioned the good faith of the Soviet Union
and said they would press for passage of an amendment
by Sen. Henry M. Jackson (D-Wash.), denying
"most-favored-nation" treatment to the Soviet Union if
President Nixon does not periodically certify that the exit
tax has ceased to apply.
Scott said he got his news from Henry A. Kissinger,
President Nixon's foreign policy adviser.
Oklahoma Forfeits Football Games
NORMAN, Okla. — Recruiting irregularities have forced
the University of Oklahoma to forfeit nine of the 12
football games the second-ranked Sooners played last
season — including the Sugar Bowl victory over Penn
State.
And Oklahoma officials said yesterday that Kerry
Jackson, the first string quarterback of the Sooners' spring
drills, would be ineligible for next season and that
offensive line coach Bill Michael had resigned.
The forfeiture and resignation came after Big Eight
conference officials verified that the transcripts of
Jackson and Mike Phillips, both from Ball High School in
Galveston, Tex., had been tampered with, Oklahoma
Athletic Director Wade Walker said.
Walker said Michael had admitted having knowledge of
the tampering of Jackson's transcript. He said Jackson
stayed two nights in an OU athletic dormitory as a high
school student — a violation of conference regulations.

Ellsberg Claims 'War Crimes'
LOS ANGELES — Daniel Ellsberg told jurors yesterday
that the Pentagon papers reveal possible American "war
crimes" in Vietnam, "some of which, I regret to say, I
participated in myself."
Ellsberg said that high U.S. officials planned to break
the Geneva peace accords of 1954 and probably
committed "a crime against the peace. .. under the
Nuremberg principles, as I understand them."
Asst. U.S. Atty. David Nissen raised the "war crimes"
question after U.S. District Judge Matt Byrne barred
asking Ellsberg whether he believed he had broken the law
when he copied the Pentagon study.
The prosecutor apparently was seeking to show that
Ellsberg did not support the policies of his own country
and acted against the country's best interests when he
published the papers.
Ellsberg and Anthony J. Russo are charged with
espionage, conspiracy and theft in connection with the
copying, and distribution of the documents known as the
Pentagon Papers.
Ellsberg, 42, once an adviser to government officials,
stressed that the men making war decisions probably were
"patriots" who meant only the best for their country but
ended by doing the w
"I knew all the time," he said, "that the people I
worked for and with were patriotic men, sometimes the
best of this country."
Segments of the Pentagon papers read to jurors showed
that U.S. agents helped plan a 1963 coup against South
Vietnamese President Ngo Dinh Diem, who was
assassinated.
"In the 1964-65 period," Ellsberg said, speaking
directly to jurors, "the planning documents are evidence
of direct operations against North Vietnam, a country not
at war with us." He called this illegal intervention.
Incumbents Lead Local Elections
OAKLAND, Calif. — Black Panther chairman Bobby
Seale's political career is off to a shaky start — saved from
an early conclusion by a scant 84 votes in a nine-way race
for Oakland mayor.
Those 84 votes were the margin by which white
incumbent Mayor John Reading failed to win a majority
of 110,851 votes counted in Tuesday's municipal election.
In Berkeley, a university city of 117,000 spread along
industrial Oakland's northern border, a student-backed
radical slate won only one of four open council seats,
falling one seat short of a takeover attempt of city
government begun two years ago.
But Berkeley voters approved several radical-sponsored
city statutes, including one designed to halt arrests of
marijuana users in the city.
Although Seale, 36, ran a distant second to the
55-year-old Reading and received less than half the votes
of the incumbent conservative business executive, he
topped the field of eight challengers to win a place on a
May 15 run-off ballot.
"The people made it clear to me that they want me to
unseat Reading," Seale said. "We made a strong showing
in relation to the nine other candidates."
"It is clear that we have not failed and that victory is
around me corner in May," he said in a prepared
statement. "I call upon all our fellow candidates and the
people to unite and win."
Despite the large turnout, Seale said 60,000 registered
voters didn't cast ballots. To win the run-off, he said the
Panthers will seek support from beaten candidates and try
to get more non-voters to the polls
City hall observers said before the election that the
best Se-ile rould hope for was to win a run-off with
Readir" But Seale had predicted that he would be swept
