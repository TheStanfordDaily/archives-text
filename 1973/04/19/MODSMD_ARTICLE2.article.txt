# Earthworms Displace Keats
## Bio Tops Psych Major In Popularity 
### KITTY PATTERSON 
Earthworms, organic chemistry and
MCATs have apparently replaced
Keats, Marx and drinking as primary
conversation topics for students.
According to the University Registrar's
office, biological sciences has displaced
psychology as the most popular
undergraduate major here. Human
biology ranks third.
According to the just-released
statistics for last fall quarter, the
number of students majoring in the
so-called "hard sciences" — biology,
chemistry, and physics — has shot up
by one-third since 1969. A primary
reason seems to be that the number of
women science majors has doubled in
that time, going from 15 to 30 percent
of the total.
Almost 18 percent of Stanford
undergraduates are currently pursuing
premedical studies, a figure that has
been steadily climbing in the last
several years. According to Dean of
Admissions Fred A. Hargadon, the

percentage of premeds in next year's
freshman class will surpass all previous
records.
Along with the rise in premeds, the
number of humanities majors has
dropped 30 percent since 1969.
Dr. Donald Stilwell, a premed
advisor, attributed the increased
interest in medicine to both
humanities and pragmatic reasons.
"People in the sciences want to go into
useful professions, but they want to
live well too," he explained.
Migration
According to Stilwell, a few years
ago hard science majors had a
relatively easy time obtaining Defense
Dept. grants to continue advanced
studies. Recently, however, this supply
has dried up. "Many of the people
who would otherwise be in some other
science have thus migrated into
medicine," he said.
Citing the fact that the number of
students indicating interest in law has
also increased, Hargadon termed the

trend toward the professions
"careerism."
With the shrinking job market,
he said, "more students are tending to
think in terms of linking their future
occupation with the education they
get in college." Students are thus
gearing their studies toward
professions where job prospects are
brighter.
Many Premeds Quit
Students' plans don't always work
out, though. Stilwell estimated that
about half of all freshman premeds
quit the program during their first year
because they get discouraged.
However, he noted that the number
of students who switch to a premed
program during their sophomore year
just about offsets the freshman
attrition.
Peter Pansing, co-ordinator of
preprofessional advising programs at
the Academic Information Center,
estimated that between 60 and 80
percent of all Stanford premed
graduates are admitted to medical

school — about twice the national
average.
Expansion And Contraction
Among those students who don't
end up as premeds, an unknown
number turn to prelaw. Since law
schools do not require a set prelaw
curriculum, this number expands when
the law boards are given — and
contracts when the law board scores
are returned.
After biology, men still prefer
majors in the traditional law school
training grounds; political science and
history. But the number of students in
history has declined over 20 percent in
the last year.
There may be a "safety"
consideration that helps explain the
larger number of premeds. A student
need not decide whether he wants to
apply to law school until his senior
year. A student wanting to attend
medical school, however, must make
up his mind no later than his
sophomore year, so he can take the
required courses.

freshman class will surpass all previous
records.
Along with the rise in premeds, the
number of humanities majors has
dropped 30 percent since 1969.
Dr. Donald Stilwell, a premed
advisor, attributed the increased
interest in medicine to both
humanities and pragmatic reasons.
"People in the sciences want to go into
useful professions, but they want to
live well too," he explained.
Migration
According to Stilwell, a few years
ago hard science majors had a
relatively easy time obtaining Defense
Dept. grants to continue advanced
studies. Recently, however, this supply
has dried up. "Many of the people
who would otherwise be in some other
science have thus migrated into
medicine," he said.
Citing the fact that the number of
students indicating interest in law has
also increased, Hargadon termed the

trend toward the professions
"careerism."
With the shrinking job market,
he said, "more students are tending to
think in terms of linking their future
occupation with the education they
get in college." Students are thus
gearing their studies toward
professions where job prospects are
brighter.
Many Premeds Quit
Students' plans don't always work
out, though. Stilwell estimated that
about half of all freshman premeds
quit the program during their first year
because they get discouraged.
However, he noted that the number
of students who switch to a premed
program during their sophomore year
just about offsets the freshman
attrition.
Peter Pansing, co-ordinator of
preprofessional advising programs at
the Academic Information Center,
estimated that between 60 and 80
percent of all Stanford premed
graduates are admitted to medical

school — about twice the national
average.
Expansion And Contraction
Among those students who don't
end up as premeds, an unknown
number turn to prelaw. Since law
schools do not require a set prelaw
curriculum, this number expands when
the law boards are given — and
contracts when the law board scores
are returned.
After biology, men still prefer
majors in the traditional law school
training grounds; political science and
history. But the number of students in
history has declined over 20 percent in
the last year.
There may be a "safety"
consideration that helps explain the
larger number of premeds. A student
need not decide whether he wants to
apply to law school until his senior
year. A student wanting to attend
medical school, however, must make
up his mind no later than his
sophomore year, so he can take the
required courses.
Earthworms, organic chemistry and
MCATs have apparently replaced
Keats, Marx and drinking as primary
conversation topics for students.
According to the University Registrar's
office, biological sciences has displaced
psychology as the most popular
undergraduate major here. Human
biology ranks third.
According to the just-released
statistics for last fall quarter, the
number of students majoring in the
so-called "hard sciences" — biology,
chemistry, and physics — has shot up
by one-third since 1969. A primary
reason seems to be that the number of
women science majors has doubled in
that time, going from 15 to 30 percent
of the total.
Almost 18 percent of Stanford
undergraduates are currently pursuing
premedical studies, a figure that has
been steadily climbing in the last
several years. According to Dean of
Admissions Fred A. Hargadon, the

percentage of premeds in next year's
freshman class will surpass all previous
records.
