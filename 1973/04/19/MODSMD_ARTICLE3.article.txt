# Newspaper Says Mitchell, Dean Implicated In Watergate Case
## 
### Associated Press 
WASHINGTON - A one-time
top-level Nixon aide now says that
former Atty. Gen. John N. Mitchell
and White House counsel John W.
Dean 111 approved and helped plan the
Watergate bugging incident, the
Washington Post said today.
The allegation was made by Jeb
Stuart Magruder to federal prosecutors
last Saturday, the Post said.
The story was attributed to sources
in the White House and the Committee
for the Re-election of the President.
Magruder was a White House deputy
to Chief of Staff H.R. Haldeman and
later was deputy chairman of the
President's re-election committee.
Meanwhile, the New York Times
quoted sources as saying that Atty.
Gen. Richard G. Kleindienst had
disqualified himself from the case.
The Times said the action "was
reported to have been taken so that he
would not be in the position of having
to prosecute" present and former
administration colleagues who might
be indicted.
Past Associations
The Times quoted Mitchell as
calling Kleindienst's action "entirely
appropriate and correct" because of
the attorney general's past
associations.
Asked about the Post story, Gerald
L. Warren, deputy press secretary,
said: "The White House is not
prepared to react to a story based on
sources. At a time when the rights of
individuals would not be jeopardized
by a comment, an appropriate
comment will be made."
The Post story quoted one source
as saying that Mitchell and Dean had
arranged to buy the silence of the

seven convicted Watergate
conspirators.
Magruder Will Testify
Magruder, according to the paper,
will testify today before the grand jury
investigating the case.
Magruder, Dean and Mitchell could
not be reached for comment.
The Post story said that Haldeman
also may resign as a result of the
Watergate disclosures, but, the paper
pointed out, there is no known
evidence linking him to any criminal
involvement.
Magruder now is director of policy
planning for the Commerce
Department. The Post quoted one
source as saying he "chose to talk
because he felt the walls were coming
in on him."
No Immunity
Magruder, according to the Post,
will not be granted immunity from
prosecution, but hopes to receive some
sort of favorable treatment.
The story was published as the
grand jury continued its probe amid
unconfirmed reports that more
indictments would be handed down
soon, possibly for perjury and
financial irregularities.
Gordon S. Strachan, a former aide
to the White House chief of staff, H.R.
Haldeman, was seen for the second
straight day in the office of federal
prosecutor Earl Silbert. Strachan
wouldn't discuss the purpose of his
visit. Some accounts have accused him
of helping set up a political espionage
ring for the Nixon campaign.
Grand Jury Subpoena
The grand jury also subpoenaed
Frederick C. Laßue, who held a high
place in President Nixon's re-election
campaign. News reports have quoted
investigative sources as saying he

helped direct a coverup of the break-in
and wiretapping at Democratic
national headquarters last year and
handled $70,000 in unreported
campaign money, the purpose of
which is unknown.
Reports of impending indictments
came from various quarters. A source
close to the Senate's special Watergate
investigating committee quoted
sources within the Justice Department
as saying about eight persons probably
would be indicted soon.
The Senate source said he had
heard the indictments would include
charges of perjury, both at the
Watergate trial and before the grand
jury, and of illegal handling of Nixon's
campaign funds.
Others Face Indictments
Those reportedly facing indictment
include present and former members
of the White House staff and the
Nixon campaign, the source said. The
second-hand report could not be
confirmed.
The Washington Star-News quoted
a Justice Department official as
predicting "major new indictments."
Justice Department spokesman John

C. Hushen said he knew of no
indictments being written, but added,
"I'm sure that anybody could predict
that something is up by what the
President said last night."
Nixon, saying he considered no
administration official exempt from
prosecution, added that he would
suspend anyone indicted and fire
anyone convicted.
The President also dropped his
long-standing claim that all members
of the White House staff and the
administration had been cleared of
involvement in the matter.
No Further Comment
The Justice Department and the
White House declined to discuss the
Watergate case further.
President Nixon's spokesman
declared he would answer no questions
on the subject "no matter how they
are phrased."
Press secretary Ronald L. Ziegler
said that on advice from"the proper
legal authorities" any responses by
him to the many Watergate questions
posed by newsmen might prejudice the
rights of individuals, the efforts of
federal prosecutors and the judicial
process.

indictments would be handed down
soon, possibly for perjury and
financial irregularities.
Gordon S. Strachan, a former aide
to the White House chief of staff, H.R.
Haldeman, was seen for the second
straight day in the office of federal
prosecutor Earl Silbert. Strachan
wouldn't discuss the purpose of his
visit. Some accounts have accused him
of helping set up a political espionage
ring for the Nixon campaign.
Grand Jury Subpoena
The grand jury also subpoenaed
Frederick C. Laßue, who held a high
place in President Nixon's re-election
campaign. News reports have quoted
investigative sources as saying he

helped direct a coverup of the break-in
and wiretapping at Democratic
national headquarters last year and
handled $70,000 in unreported
campaign money, the purpose of
which is unknown.
Reports of impending indictments
came from various quarters. A source
close to the Senate's special Watergate
investigating committee quoted
sources within the Justice Department
as saying about eight persons probably
would be indicted soon.
The Senate source said he had
heard the indictments would include
charges of perjury, both at the
Watergate trial and before the grand
jury, and of illegal handling of Nixon's
campaign funds.
Others Face Indictments
Those reportedly facing indictment
include present and former members
of the White House staff and the
Nixon campaign, the source said. The
second-hand report could not be
confirmed.
The Washington Star-News quoted
a Justice Department official as
predicting "major new indictments."
Justice Department spokesman John

C. Hushen said he knew of no
indictments being written, but added,
"I'm sure that anybody could predict
that something is up by what the
President said last night."
Nixon, saying he considered no
administration official exempt from
prosecution, added that he would
suspend anyone indicted and fire
anyone convicted.
The President also dropped his
long-standing claim that all members
of the White House staff and the
administration had been cleared of
involvement in the matter.
No Further Comment
The Justice Department and the
White House declined to discuss the
Watergate case further.
President Nixon's spokesman
declared he would answer no questions
on the subject "no matter how they
are phrased."
Press secretary Ronald L. Ziegler
said that on advice from"the proper
legal authorities" any responses by
him to the many Watergate questions
posed by newsmen might prejudice the
rights of individuals, the efforts of
federal prosecutors and the judicial
process.
WASHINGTON - A one-time
top-level Nixon aide now says that
former Atty. Gen. John N. Mitchell
and White House counsel John W.
Dean 111 approved and helped plan the
Watergate bugging incident, the
Washington Post said today.
The allegation was made by Jeb
Stuart Magruder to federal prosecutors
last Saturday, the Post said.
The story was attributed to sources
in the White House and the Committee
for the Re-election of the President.
Magruder was a White House deputy
to Chief of Staff H.R. Haldeman and
later was deputy chairman of the
President's re-election committee.
Meanwhile, the New York Times
quoted sources as saying that Atty.
Gen. Richard G. Kleindienst had
disqualified himself from the case.
The Times said the action "was
reported to have been taken so that he
would not be in the position of having
to prosecute" present and former
administration colleagues who might
be indicted.
Past Associations
The Times quoted Mitchell as
calling Kleindienst's action "entirely
appropriate and correct" because of
the attorney general's past
associations.
Asked about the Post story, Gerald
L. Warren, deputy press secretary,
said: "The White House is not
prepared to react to a story based on
sources. At a time when the rights of
individuals would not be jeopardized
by a comment, an appropriate
comment will be made."
The Post story quoted one source
as saying that Mitchell and Dean had
arranged to buy the silence of the

seven convicted Watergate
conspirators.
Magruder Will Testify
Magruder, according to the paper,
will testify today before the grand jury
investigating the case.
Magruder, Dean and Mitchell could
not be reached for comment.
The Post story said that Haldeman
also may resign as a result of the
Watergate disclosures, but, the paper
pointed out, there is no known
evidence linking him to any criminal
involvement.
Magruder now is director of policy
planning for the Commerce
Department. The Post quoted one
source as saying he "chose to talk
because he felt the walls were coming
in on him."
No Immunity
Magruder, according to the Post,
will not be granted immunity from
prosecution, but hopes to receive some
sort of favorable treatment.

posed by newsmen might prejudice the
rights of individuals, the efforts of
federal prosecutors and the judicial
process.
WASHINGTON - A one-time
top-level Nixon aide now says that
former Atty. Gen. John N. Mitchell
and White House counsel John W.
Dean 111 approved and helped plan the
Watergate bugging incident, the
Washington Post said today.
The allegation was made by Jeb
Stuart Magruder to federal prosecutors
last Saturday, the Post said.
The story was attributed to sources
in the White House and the Committee
for the Re-election of the President.
Magruder was a White House deputy
to Chief of Staff H.R. Haldeman and
later was deputy chairman of the
President's re-election committee.
Meanwhile, the New York Times
quoted sources as saying that Atty.
Gen. Richard G. Kleindienst had
disqualified himself from the case.
The Times said the action "was
reported to have been taken so that he
would not be in the position of having
to prosecute" present and former
administration colleagues who might
be indicted.
Past Associations
The Times quoted Mitchell as
calling Kleindienst's action "entirely
appropriate and correct" because of
the attorney general's past
associations.
Asked about the Post story, Gerald
L. Warren, deputy press secretary,
said: "The White House is not
prepared to react to a story based on
sources. At a time when the rights of
individuals would not be jeopardized
by a comment, an appropriate
comment will be made."
The Post story quoted one source
as saying that Mitchell and Dean had
arranged to buy the silence of the

seven convicted Watergate
conspirators.
Magruder Will Testify
Magruder, according to the paper,
will testify today before the grand jury
investigating the case.
Magruder, Dean and Mitchell could
not be reached for comment.
The Post story said that Haldeman
also may resign as a result of the
Watergate disclosures, but, the paper
pointed out, there is no known
evidence linking him to any criminal
involvement.
Magruder now is director of policy
planning for the Commerce
Department. The Post quoted one
source as saying he "chose to talk
because he felt the walls were coming
in on him."
No Immunity
Magruder, according to the Post,
will not be granted immunity from
prosecution, but hopes to receive some
sort of favorable treatment.
The story was published as the
grand jury continued its probe amid
unconfirmed reports that more
indictments would be handed down
soon, possibly for perjury and
financial irregularities.
Gordon S. Strachan, a former aide
to the White House chief of staff, H.R.
Haldeman, was seen for the second
straight day in the office of federal
prosecutor Earl Silbert. Strachan
wouldn't discuss the purpose of his
visit. Some accounts have accused him
of helping set up a political espionage
ring for the Nixon campaign.
Grand Jury Subpoena
The grand jury also subpoenaed
Frederick C. Laßue, who held a high
place in President Nixon's re-election
campaign. News reports have quoted
investigative sources as saying he

helped direct a coverup of the break-in
and wiretapping at Democratic
national headquarters last year and
handled $70,000 in unreported
campaign money, the purpose of
which is unknown.
Reports of impending indictments
came from various quarters. A source
close to the Senate's special Watergate
investigating committee quoted
sources within the Justice Department
as saying about eight persons probably
would be indicted soon.
The Senate source said he had
heard the indictments would include
charges of perjury, both at the
Watergate trial and before the grand
jury, and of illegal handling of Nixon's
campaign funds.
Others Face Indictments
Those reportedly facing indictment
include present and former members
of the White House staff and the
Nixon campaign, the source said. The
second-hand report could not be
confirmed.
The Washington Star-News quoted
a Justice Department official as
predicting "major new indictments."
Justice Department spokesman John

C. Hushen said he knew of no
indictments being written, but added,
"I'm sure that anybody could predict
that something is up by what the
President said last night."
Nixon, saying he considered no
administration official exempt from
prosecution, added that he would
suspend anyone indicted and fire
anyone convicted.
The President also dropped his
long-standing claim that all members
of the White House staff and the
administration had been cleared of
involvement in the matter.
No Further Comment
The Justice Department and the
White House declined to discuss the
Watergate case further.
President Nixon's spokesman
declared he would answer no questions
on the subject "no matter how they
are phrased."
Press secretary Ronald L. Ziegler
said that on advice from"the proper
legal authorities" any responses by
him to the many Watergate questions
posed by newsmen might prejudice the
rights of individuals, the efforts of
federal prosecutors and the judicial
process.
