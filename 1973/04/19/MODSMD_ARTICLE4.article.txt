# Arbiter Hears Arguments In Fire Department Case
## 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
An arbitration officer heard
arguments yesterday on a dispute
between the University and Local 1-12
of the International Association of
Firefighters over duty assignments.
Tony Spitaleri, president of the
firemen's union, called yesterday's
session "a good productive hearing,"
and said that "we'll abide by his
[arbiter John Lauritzen's] decision,
even if it goes against us."
Spitaleri had earlier stated that the
union would "shut this place down" if
the decision went against them.
Yesterday's hearing concerned the
stand-bys system, by which firemen
swap duty shifts. Late last summer,
Fire Chief Frank Jurian ruled that
firefighters could no longer work two
consecutive 24-hour shifts. In the past,
the men had been able to work up to
72 hours straight.
Disagreement
The University argues that Jurian's
decision comes under the rights of
management; the union claims that it
concerns working conditions, and thus
is subject to union approval.
Spitaleri has also charged that
Jurian revised the long-standing policy
on stand-bys in retaliation for difficult
contract negotiations between the
union and the department last
summer. Jurian denies this.
After direct negotiations on the
stand-by dispute between the two
sides broke down, Lauritzen, a
professional arbiter, was called in by
mutual agreement. While his decision
is binding, it can be overturned by the
courts on "very limited legal grounds,"

according to University staff counsel
Doug Barton.
Ruling Expected
However, both sides have now
indicated they'll abide by Lauritzen's
ruling, which is expected in about five
weeks.
Yesterday's session was "pretty
much concerned with presenting the
cases," Barton said. "I think everyone
entered into it in the proper spirit."
Spitaleri said there were no
negotiations between the two sides
yesterday. "We weren't there to
negotiate any more. We were there to
present our side of the case." Barton
noted that binding arbitration "is the
last formal step" in settling a dispute
short of going to court.
Neither side expected any
negotiation to take place during the
period until Lauritzen reaches his
decision.
Transcript
According to Barton, the next step
will be the preparation of a transcript
of yesterday's six-hour session. In
about two weeks, attorneys for both
sides will submit written briefs on the
case. Lauritzen's decision is not
expected for at least another two or
three weeks beyond that.
Spitaleri's word that the union
would abide by the decision was a
reversal of his previous vow to set up
informational picket lines if the arbiter
decided in favor of the University.
He said yesterday that his reversal
came after consultation with his
attorney and other union officials.
The firefighters' agreement reached
with the University last summer
includes a no strike-no lockout clause.

union would "shut this place down" if
the decision went against them.
Yesterday's hearing concerned the
stand-bys system, by which firemen
swap duty shifts. Late last summer,
Fire Chief Frank Jurian ruled that
firefighters could no longer work two
consecutive 24-hour shifts. In the past,
the men had been able to work up to
72 hours straight.
Disagreement
The University argues that Jurian's
decision comes under the rights of
management; the union claims that it
concerns working conditions, and thus
is subject to union approval.
Spitaleri has also charged that
Jurian revised the long-standing policy
on stand-bys in retaliation for difficult
contract negotiations between the
union and the department last
summer. Jurian denies this.
After direct negotiations on the
stand-by dispute between the two
sides broke down, Lauritzen, a
professional arbiter, was called in by
mutual agreement. While his decision
is binding, it can be overturned by the
courts on "very limited legal grounds,"

according to University staff counsel
Doug Barton.
Ruling Expected
However, both sides have now
indicated they'll abide by Lauritzen's
ruling, which is expected in about five
weeks.
Yesterday's session was "pretty
much concerned with presenting the
cases," Barton said. "I think everyone
entered into it in the proper spirit."
Spitaleri said there were no
negotiations between the two sides
yesterday. "We weren't there to
negotiate any more. We were there to
present our side of the case." Barton
noted that binding arbitration "is the
last formal step" in settling a dispute
short of going to court.
Neither side expected any
negotiation to take place during the
period until Lauritzen reaches his
decision.

According to Barton, the next step
will be the preparation of a transcript
of yesterday's six-hour session. In
about two weeks, attorneys for both
sides will submit written briefs on the
case. Lauritzen's decision is not
expected for at least another two or
three weeks beyond that.
Spitaleri's word that the union
would abide by the decision was a
reversal of his previous vow to set up
informational picket lines if the arbiter
decided in favor of the University.
He said yesterday that his reversal
came after consultation with his
attorney and other union officials.
The firefighters' agreement reached
with the University last summer
includes a no strike-no lockout clause.
An arbitration officer heard
arguments yesterday on a dispute
