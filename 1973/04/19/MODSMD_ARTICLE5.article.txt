# White Plaza Vendors Like Sun, Students And 'Vibes'
## 
### CHRISTY WISE 
Over the past year or so, White Plaza craftspeople have
become as much a part of the plaza area as Tresidder,
Dink and the Old Union.
The festive, friendly atmosphere created by the
presence of the vendors, and by their interchange with
browsers and buyers, adds to the energy of the plaza. It is
particularly noticeable by its absence on weekends and
holidays.
The craftspeople operate more as a community than as
hostile competitors. The number of days each vendor
comes to White Plaza varies depending on such things as
weather, where they are traveling from, where else they
sell their wares, and the demand for their goods.
Bruce runs a flower stand five days a week. According
to Chris, who occasionally takes charge of the stand, he
has been selling flowers at White Plaza "for about three
months." He sells flowers at other Bay Area campuses and
is opening a store soon in San Jose.
Chris terms the business at Stanford as "average. Some
days are good, some not so good . . . there isn't any kind
of pattern. Every day is different for me." She added, "on
Tuesdays and Thursdays Bruce thinks he doesn't do as
well."
Chris noted that "more people buy at the end of the
week. Mostly flowers, because they're doing something on
the weekend."
Jewelry Maker
Mary Markley retired from work early and started
making jewelry for profit about five years ago. She has
been coming here since last September, for about "one or
two days a week. When I don't have a class or
work . . . some weeks I don't come at all because of
weather. It depends. I have to stay home and make things
every once in awhile."
A lot of Mary's chokers, necklaces and rings are made
out of wire, shells,silverware,string and yarn. "I like to

make things out of found objects, castoffs ... people tell
me I can make something out of anything!"
Mary likes "the vibes" at White Plaza, and likes talking
with students and with the visitors on campus. "I have a
few repeat customers. It's fun to see someone wearing
something I made."
Mary also enjoys the community feeling. "You get so
you know the other vendors too and thats kind of nice."
Spoons And Forks
For the past eight months, Jim McAndrew had been a
Thursday and Friday regular at White Plaza. He sells
necklaces, bracelets and rings made out of spoons and
forks. "I make all my own things and do my own selling."
Jim has been making jewelry for a "little over a year."
He has no store, "just a little garage where I work." He
supports himself off his craft. "I'm not getting fabulously
wealthy, but I'm making a living."
The people at one of the leather goods tables have been
coming to White Plaza since last June. They are one of the
few groups that work through the summer, claiming that
business is "excellent in the summer." The campus is "full
of tourists, conferences."
Alternative To Macy's
The couple want to show the students they have a
choice; "they don't have to go to El Camino or
Macy's ... they can buy from people who are living and
working in the community. We're an alternative to Macy's
with good quality stuff for lower prices ... People can
talk with the maker, not a sales person."
"We're a non-rip-off trip .. .We feel righteous about it.
We satisfy ... We like to let the student know. We're here
trying to do a good thing and we'll talk to them about it."
She explained that there are no rules set up by the
University for the vendors, although one day last summer
a policeman decided that the White Plaza people shouldn't
be allowed to peddle their wares. When the craftspeople
