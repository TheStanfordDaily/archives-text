# Sighs Of Relief Far From Justified
## Don't Look Now: The Draft Is Still There 
### 
Jerry Norton

President Nixon's announcement that he expected to do no more
drafting of young men for military service this year brought sighs of
relief—from those concerned about being drafted and from those
opposed to the draft on principle, the principle being that the draft is
involuntary servitude, yanking two years out of the lives of young
men and giving them to the state, which can then bend, fold, spindle
and mutilate those lives as it wishes, making the draftee wear what the
state wants him to wear, eat what the state wants him to eat, go where
the state wants him to go, and sometimes die when the state wants
him to die.
That collective sigh of relief was far from entirely justified,
however, for the fact is that under existing legislation, the President
has the authority to start drafting again any time the spirit moves him,
and as the President's history in office has shown, what the spirit
moves him to do one day isn't necessarily what it will move him to do
the next.
The President's authority to draft is due to expire June 30th of this
year, but Congress can decide to extend that authority, as it always
has since the late 19405. Powerful voices in Congress have no kind
words for the volunteer military concept. They include Senate and
House armed services committee chairmen—the now ailing Sen. John
Stennis (D—Miss.), and Rep. F. Edward Hebert (D—La.), who has
said—in so many words—that he believes the only way to get a
volunteer army is to draft it.
Neo-Fascist
Coupled with them are a number of liberals who would like to see
universal compulsory national service, a mouthful that means
everyone at a certain age would have to give a year or two to the state,
whether in the military or in Peace Corps, VISTA, or Civilian
Conservation Corps type projects. The Big Brother, neo-fascist aspects
of that proposal are obvious.
Other liberals favor a continued military draft because as their
foremost spokesman, Sen. Edward Kennedy (D—Mass.) puts it, they
believe a volunteer army would be an army of the black and the poor
(never mind that all the evidence indicates that they're dead wrong,
and even if they were right, their position would mean shutting the
black and the poor off from what those groups saw as an avenue of
improvement—or maybe it's just that Kennedy doesn't trust the black
and the poor).
Even if the anti-volunteer military forces lose, there's a catch in
President Nixon's requests that will make it easier for the draft to be
renewed sometime after June 30. He's asking Congress to continue
funding the Selective Service System, and he wants the SSS to
continue registering 18-year-olds and have everything ready to go if
the draft should come back. If the President should shift his position,
Congress is likely to be much more sympathetic than otherwise if the
machinery is there and ready to go, and if young men—by having
registered—are at least somewhat adjusted to the idea that they might
still be drafted.
Nuclear
Objections that this would cripple the President's authority to
defend the country in a pinch ignore some salient factors. First, in a
nuclear exchange, the war would be over before a draft could be
instituted and men trained no matter how efficient the machinery
(and its efficiency after a nuclear war would probably not be at a
peak).
Second, Vietnam should have taught us that any commitment of
American troops to a limited war should come only after long and
hard thought and discussion, and a decision that the war is worth

fighting and winning.
Third, the National Guard and the reserves are there, theoretically
as battle-ready troops that can be called up on a moment's notice.
President Johnson simply chose to ignore them in the case of
Vietnam, because he thought drafting would hurt him less politically.
The National Guard and the reserves, however, bring up another
argument likely to be used by the draft lovers. They will argue that
the two groups cannot get enough men, and therefore exceptions need
to be made for them. Similar arguments ard likely to be heard for
making an exception for drafting doctors and bthers whose specialties
are in short supply in the military.
But the way they say they intend to use it, and the way the law
says it can be used, will be two different things. Friends of the
volunteer military would thus be wise to press for a complete end to
drafting authority, and enough increases in pay and benefits to attract
the requisite numbers of men in these specialized groups (they should
also investigate the numbers of men the Pentagon says are necessary

for the Guard and reserves, because a good deal of data indicates
present manpower requirements are unrealistic-ally high.) If that fails,
volunteer military advocates could work to extend authority to draft
only the specific groups, rather than the general power to induct at
presidential whim.
All things considered, though, anti-draft forces will probably do
best if they lobby for the strongest possible position, that is, a
complete end to drafting authority and a complete end to the
Selective Service System. Collectivists have shown in the last 40 years
of American history that if you ask for the moon you many not get
all of it, but you'll probably get a lot more than if you just ask for a
piece. It's a lesson friends of freedom would do well to learn.

and mutilate those lives as it wishes, making the draftee wear what the
state wants him to wear, eat what the state wants him to eat, go where
the state wants him to go, and sometimes die when the state wants
him to die.
That collective sigh of relief was far from entirely justified,
however, for the fact is that under existing legislation, the President
has the authority to start drafting again any time the spirit moves him,
and as the President's history in office has shown, what the spirit
moves him to do one day isn't necessarily what it will move him to do
the next.
The President's authority to draft is due to expire June 30th of this
year, but Congress can decide to extend that authority, as it always
has since the late 19405. Powerful voices in Congress have no kind
words for the volunteer military concept. They include Senate and
House armed services committee chairmen—the now ailing Sen. John
Stennis (D—Miss.), and Rep. F. Edward Hebert (D—La.), who has
said—in so many words—that he believes the only way to get a
volunteer army is to draft it.
Neo-Fascist
Coupled with them are a number of liberals who would like to see
universal compulsory national service, a mouthful that means
everyone at a certain age would have to give a year or two to the state,
whether in the military or in Peace Corps, VISTA, or Civilian
Conservation Corps type projects. The Big Brother, neo-fascist aspects
of that proposal are obvious.
Other liberals favor a continued military draft because as their
foremost spokesman, Sen. Edward Kennedy (D—Mass.) puts it, they
believe a volunteer army would be an army of the black and the poor
(never mind that all the evidence indicates that they're dead wrong,
and even if they were right, their position would mean shutting the
black and the poor off from what those groups saw as an avenue of
improvement—or maybe it's just that Kennedy doesn't trust the black
and the poor).
Even if the anti-volunteer military forces lose, there's a catch in
President Nixon's requests that will make it easier for the draft to be
renewed sometime after June 30. He's asking Congress to continue
funding the Selective Service System, and he wants the SSS to
continue registering 18-year-olds and have everything ready to go if
the draft should come back. If the President should shift his position,
Congress is likely to be much more sympathetic than otherwise if the
machinery is there and ready to go, and if young men—by having
registered—are at least somewhat adjusted to the idea that they might
still be drafted.
Nuclear
Objections that this would cripple the President's authority to
defend the country in a pinch ignore some salient factors. First, in a
nuclear exchange, the war would be over before a draft could be
instituted and men trained no matter how efficient the machinery
(and its efficiency after a nuclear war would probably not be at a
peak).
Second, Vietnam should have taught us that any commitment of
American troops to a limited war should come only after long and
hard thought and discussion, and a decision that the war is worth

fighting and winning.
Third, the National Guard and the reserves are there, theoretically
as battle-ready troops that can be called up on a moment's notice.
President Johnson simply chose to ignore them in the case of
Vietnam, because he thought drafting would hurt him less politically.
The National Guard and the reserves, however, bring up another
argument likely to be used by the draft lovers. They will argue that
the two groups cannot get enough men, and therefore exceptions need
to be made for them. Similar arguments ard likely to be heard for
making an exception for drafting doctors and bthers whose specialties
are in short supply in the military.
But the way they say they intend to use it, and the way the law
says it can be used, will be two different things. Friends of the
volunteer military would thus be wise to press for a complete end to
drafting authority, and enough increases in pay and benefits to attract
the requisite numbers of men in these specialized groups (they should
also investigate the numbers of men the Pentagon says are necessary

for the Guard and reserves, because a good deal of data indicates
present manpower requirements are unrealistic-ally high.) If that fails,
volunteer military advocates could work to extend authority to draft
only the specific groups, rather than the general power to induct at
presidential whim.
All things considered, though, anti-draft forces will probably do
best if they lobby for the strongest possible position, that is, a
complete end to drafting authority and a complete end to the
Selective Service System. Collectivists have shown in the last 40 years
of American history that if you ask for the moon you many not get
all of it, but you'll probably get a lot more than if you just ask for a
piece. It's a lesson friends of freedom would do well to learn.

President Nixon's announcement that he expected to do no more
drafting of young men for military service this year brought sighs of

involuntary servitude, yanking two years out of the lives of young
men and giving them to the state, which can then bend, fold, spindle
and mutilate those lives as it wishes, making the draftee wear what the
state wants him to wear, eat what the state wants him to eat, go where

has the authority to start drafting again any time the spirit moves him,
and as the President's history in office has shown, what the spirit
moves him to do one day isn't necessarily what it will move him to do
the next.
The President's authority to draft is due to expire June 30th of this
year, but Congress can decide to extend that authority, as it always
has since the late 19405. Powerful voices in Congress have no kind
words for the volunteer military concept. They include Senate and
House armed services committee chairmen—the now ailing Sen. John
Stennis (D—Miss.), and Rep. F. Edward Hebert (D—La.), who has
said—in so many words—that he believes the only way to get a
volunteer army is to draft it.
Neo-Fascist
Coupled with them are a number of liberals who would like to see
universal compulsory national service, a mouthful that means
everyone at a certain age would have to give a year or two to the state,
whether in the military or in Peace Corps, VISTA, or Civilian
Conservation Corps type projects. The Big Brother, neo-fascist aspects
of that proposal are obvious.
Other liberals favor a continued military draft because as their
foremost spokesman, Sen. Edward Kennedy (D—Mass.) puts it, they
believe a volunteer army would be an army of the black and the poor
(never mind that all the evidence indicates that they're dead wrong,
and even if they were right, their position would mean shutting the
black and the poor off from what those groups saw as an avenue of
improvement—or maybe it's just that Kennedy doesn't trust the black
and the poor).
Even if the anti-volunteer military forces lose, there's a catch in
President Nixon's requests that will make it easier for the draft to be
renewed sometime after June 30. He's asking Congress to continue
funding the Selective Service System, and he wants the SSS to
continue registering 18-year-olds and have everything ready to go if
the draft should come back. If the President should shift his position,
Congress is likely to be much more sympathetic than otherwise if the
machinery is there and ready to go, and if young men—by having
registered—are at least somewhat adjusted to the idea that they might
still be drafted.
Nuclear
Objections that this would cripple the President's authority to
defend the country in a pinch ignore some salient factors. First, in a
nuclear exchange, the war would be over before a draft could be
instituted and men trained no matter how efficient the machinery
(and its efficiency after a nuclear war would probably not be at a
peak).
Second, Vietnam should have taught us that any commitment of
American troops to a limited war should come only after long and
hard thought and discussion, and a decision that the war is worth

fighting and winning.
Third, the National Guard and the reserves are there, theoretically
as battle-ready troops that can be called up on a moment's notice.
President Johnson simply chose to ignore them in the case of
Vietnam, because he thought drafting would hurt him less politically.
The National Guard and the reserves, however, bring up another
argument likely to be used by the draft lovers. They will argue that
the two groups cannot get enough men, and therefore exceptions need
to be made for them. Similar arguments ard likely to be heard for
making an exception for drafting doctors and bthers whose specialties
are in short supply in the military.
But the way they say they intend to use it, and the way the law
says it can be used, will be two different things. Friends of the
volunteer military would thus be wise to press for a complete end to
drafting authority, and enough increases in pay and benefits to attract
the requisite numbers of men in these specialized groups (they should
also investigate the numbers of men the Pentagon says are necessary

for the Guard and reserves, because a good deal of data indicates
present manpower requirements are unrealistic-ally high.) If that fails,
volunteer military advocates could work to extend authority to draft
only the specific groups, rather than the general power to induct at
presidential whim.
All things considered, though, anti-draft forces will probably do
best if they lobby for the strongest possible position, that is, a
complete end to drafting authority and a complete end to the
Selective Service System. Collectivists have shown in the last 40 years
of American history that if you ask for the moon you many not get
all of it, but you'll probably get a lot more than if you just ask for a
piece. It's a lesson friends of freedom would do well to learn.

President Nixon's announcement that he expected to do no more
drafting of young men for military service this year brought sighs of
relief—from those concerned about being drafted and from those
opposed to the draft on principle, the principle being that the draft is
involuntary servitude, yanking two years out of the lives of young
men and giving them to the state, which can then bend, fold, spindle
and mutilate those lives as it wishes, making the draftee wear what the
state wants him to wear, eat what the state wants him to eat, go where
the state wants him to go, and sometimes die when the state wants
him to die.
That collective sigh of relief was far from entirely justified,
however, for the fact is that under existing legislation, the President
has the authority to start drafting again any time the spirit moves him,
and as the President's history in office has shown, what the spirit
moves him to do one day isn't necessarily what it will move him to do
the next.
