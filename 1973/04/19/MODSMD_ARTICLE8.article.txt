# Baby, Bath Water
## What Tours Offers 
### 
Ben C. Scheible

On April 12, an article appeared
in the Daily by J. Lloyd Snook 111
asking for implementation of the
Merryman Commission
recommendation that the French
overseas campus be relocated in
Paris. Reasons for this move were
statements such as "one of every
five Frenchmen live in or around
Paris" and "Paris, c'est la France;
la France c'est Paris."
General De Gaulle once said,
"Je suis la France." So where
should the campus be located
now?
To be brief I will only answer
one of Mr. Snook's questions—and
pose one or two myself. Mr
Snook asks "What does Tours
have to offer the Stanford
student?" He answers this
question by saying, "Very little.
Almost nothing that couldn't be
found in Paris easier and better."
F'irst of all. Tours is not as

culturally barren as Mr. Snook
would want one to believe, but I
won't argue with him on this
point. Paris is certainly a greater
cultural center, especially for "Joe
Tourist." But what are some of
the many things that Tours has to
offer the Stanford student that
can't be found easier and better in
Paris?
1. A building. The Merryman
recommendation is based on the
assumption that such a move is
even remotely practical on an
economic and administrative level.
This is not a very safe assumption.
2. The opportunity to have a
French family and friends.
Assistant Director de Renusson
has made this available by
breaking down cultural and
language barriers and establishing
a rapport with the community
that would take years, if ever, to
do in Paris.

3. A close working relationship
with a major University. All of the
facilities at the University of
Tours are available to Stanford
students and we can audit any
courses we want to. Anyone
acquainted with the French
university system knows that
many of the facilities in Paris
aren't even available to some of
the French students. Does
Stanford expect to have these
facilities opened to Americans?
4. Finally the loss Mr. Snook
admits. The Stanford-in-France
faculty and staff. M. LeMoal and
M. Borious are only two. We
would be losing others such as
Mile, du Renusson whom I
mentioned earlier.
Mr. Snook ends his argument
by citing the decreasing
enrollment at overseas campuses.
Will moving to Paris remedy this?
I don't know; perhaps. But the
assumption that the present
location is a major factor in the
decreasing enrollment is, again, a
very big assumption. How many
students have not gone to the
French campus because it isn't
located in Paris or because it is
located in Tours?
Alors que faire? — Certainly
improvements can and should be
made in the French Program
overseas — but let's not throw out
the baby with the bath water.

Tours are available to Stanford
students and we can audit any
courses we want to. Anyone
acquainted with the French
university system knows that
many of the facilities in Paris
aren't even available to some of
the French students. Does
Stanford expect to have these
facilities opened to Americans?
4. Finally the loss Mr. Snook
admits. The Stanford-in-France
faculty and staff. M. LeMoal and
M. Borious are only two. We
would be losing others such as
Mile, du Renusson whom I
mentioned earlier.
Mr. Snook ends his argument
by citing the decreasing
enrollment at overseas campuses.
Will moving to Paris remedy this?
I don't know; perhaps. But the
assumption that the present
location is a major factor in the
decreasing enrollment is, again, a
very big assumption. How many
students have not gone to the
French campus because it isn't
located in Paris or because it is
located in Tours?
Alors que faire? — Certainly
improvements can and should be
made in the French Program
overseas — but let's not throw out
the baby with the bath water.

On April 12, an article appeared
in the Daily by J. Lloyd Snook 111
asking for implementation of the
Merryman Commission
recommendation that the French
overseas campus be relocated in
Paris. Reasons for this move were
statements such as "one of every
five Frenchmen live in or around
Paris" and "Paris, c'est la France;
la France c'est Paris."
General De Gaulle once said,
"Je suis la France." So where
should the campus be located
now?
To be brief I will only answer
one of Mr. Snook's questions—and
pose one or two myself. Mr
Snook asks "What does Tours
have to offer the Stanford
student?" He answers this
question by saying, "Very little.
Almost nothing that couldn't be
found in Paris easier and better."
F'irst of all. Tours is not as

culturally barren as Mr. Snook
would want one to believe, but I
won't argue with him on this
point. Paris is certainly a greater
cultural center, especially for "Joe
Tourist." But what are some of
the many things that Tours has to
offer the Stanford student that
can't be found easier and better in
Paris?
1. A building. The Merryman
recommendation is based on the
assumption that such a move is
even remotely practical on an
economic and administrative level.
This is not a very safe assumption.
2. The opportunity to have a
French family and friends.
Assistant Director de Renusson
has made this available by
breaking down cultural and
language barriers and establishing
a rapport with the community
that would take years, if ever, to
do in Paris.

3. A close working relationship
with a major University. All of the
facilities at the University of
Tours are available to Stanford
students and we can audit any
courses we want to. Anyone
acquainted with the French
university system knows that
many of the facilities in Paris
aren't even available to some of
the French students. Does
Stanford expect to have these
facilities opened to Americans?
