# Twisted Egalitarianism
## The 						Politics Of Envy 
### 
Bill Evers

The March 1973 issue of
Worldview (published by the
Council on Religion and
International Affairs) contains a
fascinating article on
egalitarianism, the doctrine
maintaining that equality is the
highest political goal.
The article is by a German
sociologist named Helmut
Schoeck, whose book on envy was
acclaimed by "new journalist"
Tom Wolfe as one of the best
books of 1970.
Schoeck's current article,
entitled 'The Paradoxes and
Psychology of Egalitarianism,"
questions the widespread
contention by social democrats
and others that the masses of the
population desire across-the-board
equality of income.
Examples
Schoeck seeks to bolster
empirically his hypothesis by
taking two polar examples: one is
the holder of a winning lottery
ticket; the other is an expert (like
a physicist) who is widely viewed
as having rendered the members

of society some exceptional
service during a crisis (like
wartime).
Interestingly enough, as a
general rule even in the most
politically democratic and socially
egalitarian countries in the world,
the lottery winner, whose gains
come as a result of random chance
(real chance, not the residual
category of "luck" employed by
Christopher Jencks in his recent
study), is not expropriated by the
tax laws.
Similarly, exceptional and
meritorious service by an expert
during a crisis (a doctor battling a
plague single-handed) is
generously rewarded.
Life-Span
Schoeck argues that "most
people do not accept the
prescription of the egalitarian"
that rewards should be equally
distributed. Schoeck takes as an
illustration unequal distribution
of life-spans:
"A favorite ... strategy of the
egalitarian is to expose with more
or less reliable statistics that only
x percent of the population owns,
say, y percent of all stock or real
estate.
"Well, then, since most men
would agree that life is a more
important and even less
reproducible good than financial
resources, wouldn't it be an
appallingly unjust society in
which only a tiny minority of all
living individuals reach the age
bracket of eighty and up?
"We might make this case even
more invidious by finding out the
percentage of a population of
eighty years or older who enjoy
their live in reasonable health."
Absurd
Theft is generally easier than
murder, whether one calls oneself
a bandit or a government official.
But, as Schoeck points out, this is
not a satisfactory escape hatch for
the egalitarian who logically
should advocate equalizing
life-spans (by killing) as well as
incomes (by stealing).
It seems then that the
egalitarian position reduces itself
to the absurd. To borrow an
example from an author other
than Schoeck, it flies in the face
of reality to claim that an
inhabitant of the Indian
subcontinent should have an equal
opportunity with a New Yorker
to enjoy the Manhattan skyline. It
is similarly absurd to maintain
that a New Yorker should have an
equal opportunity with an Indian
to swim in the Ganges river.
Human beings do have different,
unequal attributes and do find
themselves in different, unequal
situations.
Furthermore, as Schoeck
indicates in his article, if one
equalizes some attributes of
individuals, say income, then envy
and invidious comparison will
increasingly fasten themselves

upon other distinguishing
attributes, like life-span, height,
beauty, etc. In fact, L.P. Hartley's
science fiction work Facial Justice
takes as its theme precisely this
phenomenon. Schoeck even offers
anthropological data on a society
in which long life is envied.
Those who are serious about
politics have to recognize not only
that equality is an absurd
goal-orientation, but also that
political liberty and social

equality are in direct conflict.
Milton Kotler of the New Left
think-tank the Institute for Policy
Studies acknowledges the fact of
this conflict in his 1969 book
Neighborhood Government.
Kotler comes out for a radical
politics that stands for political
freedom and decentralization
rather than social engineering and
national equalization.
