\ xM the nostalgic retrospective

J JA just one year ago. Now bigger
Um and better than ever with r~* Tfi fjßpW
jKI some special premieres ad-
GROUCHO MARX IN YOU BET YOUR LIFE (1957)
The secret word in tonight's show is arm .Say the secret word and the duck descends. A
lengendary masterpiece. Stanford premiere.
JACK WEBB'S ORIGINAL DRAGNET (1956)
This is the genuine classic item, different from last year's 1970 DRAGNET. Here we have
Webb as Joe Friday and the great Ben Alexander as partner Frank Smith. And Friday says
those Famous words: "I work here. I'm a cop." Complete with original Chesterfield
cigarette ads. Stanford premiere.
SERGEANT BILKO (1958)
Stars Phil Silvers. A repeat from last year's show as Bilko leads his lost squadron to a
wedding during Colonel Hall's war games. Unsurpassed.
I JIMMY DURANTE SHOW (1951)
Another premiere of tremendous poignant clips of this vaudeville giant as he bids good
night to Mrs. Calabash and picks up the beat with partner Eddie Jackson.
MARX BROTHERS INCREDIBLE JEWEL ROBBERY (1959)
Their very last appearance together. An extremely rare short made for CBS.
OZZIE AND HARRIET (1958)
This is the one everybody has asked to see. Called Father's Night At The Fraternity
features Wally at his ridiculous best and Ricky blasting out some golden oldies.
AMOS 'N ANDY (1953)
Another Stanford premiere different from the one shown recently at Palo Alto High
Called The Broken Clock as Andy and the Kingfish throw a monkey wrench into a United
States defense factory that is in the bomb manufacturing business. A howl from start to
m finish
WHAT IS COMMUNISM? (1952)
I The term back by popular demand truly applies to this camp bit of insanity from the Joe
McCarthy years. Watch Herbert Philbrick of I Led Three Lives Fame smear the noble
Communist Party and pinko students!
T.V. COMMERCIALS GALORE (1950'5)
Some of the wildest ads ever made and worth six laughs a second. Comic absurdities in
purest form.
