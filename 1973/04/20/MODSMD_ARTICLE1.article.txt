# O'Grady Just Short Of First Round ASSU Win
## 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
ASSU Presidential candidate Kevin
O'Grady apparently fell agonizingly
short of claiming a first ballot victory
in yesterday's election.
Incomplete unofficial returns
showed O'Grady just seven votes short
of the absolute majority needed for
election. Incumbent Vice President
Peter Van Petten ran a distant second.
Elections Commissioner Mike
Nilsson said returns from the overseas
campuses could decide whether there
will be a runoff. He was attempting to
contact the campuses early this
morning, and the returns were
expected soon.
The third and final canvass
conducted last night gave the slate of
O'Grady, Beth Garfield, Charles
Ogletree and Jim Friend 1357 votes,
or 49.7 percent.
The slate of Van Petten, Jim
Anderson, Tom Flohr and Charles

Schott won 642 votes, or 23.6
percent. Judy Gans and Buzz
Thompson took 495 votes for 18.2
percent; Robert Garcia and David
Meyer 163 for 6.0 percent; and Fred
Choate and Ed Ryu 69 for 2.5
percent.
Concede?
Nilsson said he would ask Van
Petten to concede the election based
on the returns to avoid the cost of
running another balloting. Van Petten
said last night he would meet with the
rest of his slate before deciding
whether to withdraw.
All five fee assessments — for the
Program fee, KZSU, the Daily, the
Band, and the Stanford Legal
Counseling Office — passed. The most
controversial constitutional
amendment, which would have made
all fee assessments voluntary rather
than refundable, received a majority
but fell far short of the necessary
two-thirds needed for passage.
Votes on the fee assessments:
—The ASSU program fee received
1693 yes votes (62 percent) against
1042 no votes (38 percent). The fee
calls for $1 for two quarters.
—The Daily assessment ($1 for one
quarter) received 2211 yes votes (77
percent) to 641 no votes (23 percent).
—KZSU ($1 for two quarters)

received 2024 yes (71 percent) to 813
no (29 percent).
—The Band ($1 for two quarters)
received 1824 yes (66 percent) to 939
no (34 percent).
—The new Legal Counseling Office
($1 for one quarter) received 1536 yes
(55 percent) to 1316 no (45 percent).
Voluntary Amendment Fails
The constitutional amendment
establishing voluntary assessments
obtained a narrow majority, 1252 to
1123. However, the proposal needed a
two-thirds vote of approval; it received
only 53 percent.
Incumbent President Scott Burke's
proposal to establish a commission
which would interpret the constitution
appeared to be going down to a
narrow defeat. It received 1366
affirmative votes to 727 negative — a
65-35 percent spread that was just two
percent short of approval. Overseas
ballots could well determine the
outcome.
Another B u r k e-proposed
amendment to strengthen the
president's veto power was also
defeated, 1123 no (52 percent) to
1070 yes (48 percent).
Other proposals to update the
ASSU's financial procedures, ensure
that the program fee election is always

CLIFFHANGER — The O'Grady-Garfield-Ogletree-Friend ticket missed an outright victory over the Van
Petten-Anderson-Flohr-Schott slate by a mere seven votes in the ASSU elections. The Van Petten forces will decide today
whether to concede.
