# O'Grady Just Short Of First Round ASSU Win
## 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
ASSU Presidential candidate Kevin
O'Grady apparently fell agonizingly
short of claiming a first ballot victory
in yesterday's election.
Incomplete unofficial returns
showed O'Grady just seven votes short
of the absolute majority needed for
election. Incumbent Vice President
Peter Van Petten ran a distant second.
Elections Commissioner Mike
Nilsson said returns from the overseas
campuses could decide whether there
will be a runoff. He was attempting to
contact the campuses early this
morning, and the returns were
expected soon.
The third and final canvass
conducted last night gave the slate of
O'Grady, Beth Garfield, Charles
Ogletree and Jim Friend 1357 votes,
or 49.7 percent.
The slate of Van Petten, Jim
Anderson, Tom Flohr and Charles

Schott won 642 votes, or 23.6
percent. Judy Gans and Buzz
Thompson took 495 votes for 18.2
percent; Robert Garcia and David
Meyer 163 for 6.0 percent; and Fred
Choate and Ed Ryu 69 for 2.5
percent.
Concede?
Nilsson said he would ask Van
Petten to concede the election based
on the returns to avoid the cost of
running another balloting. Van Petten
said last night he would meet with the
rest of his slate before deciding
whether to withdraw.
All five fee assessments — for the
Program fee, KZSU, the Daily, the
Band, and the Stanford Legal
Counseling Office — passed. The most
controversial constitutional
amendment, which would have made
all fee assessments voluntary rather
than refundable, received a majority
but fell far short of the necessary
two-thirds needed for passage.
Votes on the fee assessments:
—The ASSU program fee received
1693 yes votes (62 percent) against
1042 no votes (38 percent). The fee
calls for $1 for two quarters.
—The Daily assessment ($1 for one
quarter) received 2211 yes votes (77
percent) to 641 no votes (23 percent).
—KZSU ($1 for two quarters)

received 2024 yes (71 percent) to 813
no (29 percent).
—The Band ($1 for two quarters)
received 1824 yes (66 percent) to 939
no (34 percent).
—The new Legal Counseling Office
($1 for one quarter) received 1536 yes
(55 percent) to 1316 no (45 percent).
Voluntary Amendment Fails
The constitutional amendment
establishing voluntary assessments
obtained a narrow majority, 1252 to
1123. However, the proposal needed a
two-thirds vote of approval; it received
only 53 percent.
Incumbent President Scott Burke's
proposal to establish a commission
which would interpret the constitution
appeared to be going down to a
narrow defeat. It received 1366
affirmative votes to 727 negative — a
65-35 percent spread that was just two
percent short of approval. Overseas
ballots could well determine the
outcome.
Another B u r k e-proposed
amendment to strengthen the
president's veto power was also
defeated, 1123 no (52 percent) to
1070 yes (48 percent).
Other proposals to update the
ASSU's financial procedures, ensure
that the program fee election is always

CLIFFHANGER — The O'Grady-Garfield-Ogletree-Friend ticket missed an outright victory over the Van
Petten-Anderson-Flohr-Schott slate by a mere seven votes in the ASSU elections. The Van Petten forces will decide today
whether to concede.
held during the Presidential primary,
and require a 20 percent turnout for
fee assessments to be valid all passed
by solid margins.
O'Grady Pleased
O'Grady said last night he was
"very pleased" with the outcome of
the balloting. He refused to say
whether he thought the election
represented a repudiation of Burke's
policies, but noted that "we did attack
a record that was public knowledge."
He would not directly call upon
Van Petten to pull out if the overseas
results were unconclusive, but
observed that "I personally would
concede if I was in his position."
Charles Ogletree, vice presidential
candidate on the O'Grady ticket,
refused to comment on whether Van
Petten should withdraw. "That's a
decision he'll have to make himself,"
Ogletree said.
Van Petten told the Daily last night
that he attributed his defeat to "two
things: first, distortions by our
opponents, and the Daily's
endorsement."
No Formal Endorsement
(The Daily did not issue a formal
endorsement; in an editorial printed
last week, the paper's editorial board
said it was split between endorsing
O'Grady and making no
recommendation.)
Van Petten accused O'Grady of
taking portions of the editorial out of
context and representing it as an
endorsement in campaign literature.
Van Petten was asked if he thought
the O'Grady slate waged an overall fair
campaign.
"I think they fought a good
campaign," he replied. "We tried to be

honest with the students; I don't think
they were ready for that."
Burke, who endorsed the Van
Petten slate, last night predicted that
the overseas ballots would give
O'Grady a solid majority.
Nilsson said only 2898 students
voted in the election — the lowest
turnout in a presidential primary since
1963. No presidential candidate has
received a majority in the primary
since 1967.
Burke said last night that he didn't
think the election results were a
personal repudiation, but admitted
that it was a "possibility" that the
failure of some of his proposed
amendments was a reaction to his
term.
"But I was very pleased to see that
the Legal Counseling Office, which I
proposed, passed," he said.
Charles Schott, vice presidential
candidate on the Van Petten slate, said
that his slate would meet today to
decide on a course of action.
In other voting yesterday, the slate
of Terry Albert, Scott Miller, Dean
Smith and Debbie Stinchfield was
elected to the senior class presidency,
defeating Rischa Williams, Zeus
Roesler, Nora Sweeney and Pat Smith.
