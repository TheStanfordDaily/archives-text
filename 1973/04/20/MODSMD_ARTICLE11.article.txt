Wounded Knee Rally
There is a war going on in the
middle of this country and the
people here don't seem to know
about it.
Over 300 federal marshalls and
troops use flares at night, burning
large areas of grassland. They're
armed with M-16s (standard issue
in Vietnam). 50 caliber machine
guns and M-16s rake the village at
night, and sometimes in the day.
If you look, you'll find M-l
spider rifles with
infra-red scopes, 15 armoured
personnel carriers with M-60s or
M-60 moutings, 30-06 rifles, gas
cannisteus, mace, flack-jackets,
and silencers for some weapons.
And then there are the
helicopters.
The scene is very much like
Vietnam. Only this time the
targets are women, men, and
children living and working in
freedom for ti)u second time in
the Oglala Sioux nation, and
fighting to keep it. They are being
shot at because they are
reclaiming their right to live their
own (legally) land and to control

their own lives.
Some facts behind Wounded
Knee:
(1) Indian male life expectancy
is 44.5 years.
(2) Suicide rate is 15 times the
national average.
(3) Median yearly income for a
family is $1000.
(4) U.S. has effectively
controlled Indian affairs since
1834.
(5) 75-80 percent of the people
signed impeachment petitions
which were never recognized by
the U.S. council chief Richard
Wilson, or his superiors in the
Bureau of Indian Affairs.
A couple of days ago six
people in Wounded Knee were
shot (not the two reported in the
press). One, a 60-year old Indian
man, was shot through the head
and is in critical condition. The
situation is getting increasingly
heavy, and at the same time the
media are more and more
reporting just the government side
and "playing down" what's really
happening.
Stanford workers and students
should show the same support for
the Indians in their own country
that they showed for the
Indochinese during Cambodia,
Laos, and Haiphong. The struggle
in South Dakota is very similar to
that revolutionary war in Vietnam.
Both are fights for national
liberation.
Support Wounded Knee.
COME TO THE RALLY FRIDAY
NOON, WHITE PLAZA.

Racial Bigotry
Editor:
Racial bigotry is not always
manifested as open defiance of
the civil rights of minorities. Nor
need racists be coarse or stupid as
Agnew was when he noted the
"fat Jap" in his airplane. Often
they are well-meaning but
insensitive people who cannot see
themselves as tainted in any way.
The producers and directors of
the play Caucasian Chalk Circle,
performed last week at Stanford,
are a case in point. Their
simplistic production depicted the
chief villains of the play as Asians.
In contrast, the heroes were
depicted as whites.
This dichotomy between
yellow and white was not due to
the written play itself. Rather, it
was a result of its production by
students of the Drama 200
Workshop. The playwright,
Bertolt Brecht, intended his play
to be set in the Caucasus
Mountains of what is now Soviet
Georgia. The prologue was to take
place following the Soviet
revolution. The play proper was
set in feudal Caucasus before the
invention of firearms. (Caucasian
Chalk Circle, Part 1, Scene 1, Line
2; and Willett, The Theatre of
Bertolt Brecht.) The class
dichotomy in Brecht's play was
between powerful whites and
oppressed whites.
Fu Manchu
It was the production which
deliberately introduced the
slant-eyed, high cheek-boned
masks reminiscent of mass media's
inglorious depiction of "Fu
Manchu" (whose part was also
played by whites). The masks
were worn by actors portraying
the opulent and despotic rulers
and their lackeys in the play.
Invariably,the heroes, heroine, and
peasants were white.

The play is centered around
the custody of a child who was
raised by a white peasant girl but
born to a deposed ruler. It was
not surprising that the child is
depicted as white. Apparently, his
being raised by the heroine of the
play cleansed him of the
biological responsibility of
donning a slant-eyed mask.
It is relevant to note that, in
reality, the roles of the two classes
of people in the performance are
reversed. The past two centuries
are replete with historical
examples of white oppression of
Asians, Blacks, and Chicanos
alike.
Slyness
It was noble of the producers
of Chalk Circle to include in the
program a note praising the spirit
of modern China for which the
prologue of the play was to
reflect. It requires either a
schizophrenic or deceitful mind to
praise someone in words and to
defame him in action. To whom
now, should the qualities of
slyness and sneakiness be
attributed?
The students involved in
producing, directing, and
performing in Caucasian Chalk
Circle have violated the
Fundamental Standard of student
conduct. A public apology from
them to the Stanford Asian
community is in order.

Intolerable
Editor:
As a freshman, I have been
surprised by many of Stanford's
idiosyncracies. The shortage of
housing, the overcrowded
lectures, the skyrocketing
pricesâ€”these are things, distressing
as they are, I can put up with. Yet
the level to which political
campaign and persuasion has
dropped is a thing I can no longer
tolerate.
Words such as dismayed,
appalled, aghast and disheartened
fall short of describing my
opinion of the depths sunk to by

the Van Petten and o'Grady
slates. I find the manner in which
the candidates have addressed
themselves to me, your typical
Joe Stanford, importunate, galling
and a bit embarrassing. In short, I
say it's time to bring the
campaigns into the open and out
of the bathrooms.
Gone are the days when a
student, pained and fed up with
the day's studying, financial
affairs, ill will, etc., could take a
quiet, relaxing time-out in the
stall of his choice. To have this
solitude breached by the
acrimonious rantings and ravings
of political confrontation must
therefore be a crime against
nature.
I also don't like the idea that
while I'm in the bathroom doing
my duty, some Rasputinish
representative of one of the slates
is also in there. The nerve of that
troublemaker, scurrying about the
bathroom, spoiling its inherent
beauty and probably spying on
me.
The only kind of paper I like
to see next to a toilet comes in a
little tear-off squares on a long
roll. Perhaps the Van Petten and
O'Grady people would be good
enough to make some
arrangements with Crown
Zellerbach or somebody to print
their blurbs on regulation toilet
paper. That way, voters would not
only be able to be informed of the
issues by their leaders, but would
also be able to generate that
necessary voter feedback in what
they do with the politicized
paper.
Apparently my Utopian vision
of ASSU electioneering is not
destined for the near future. My
only wish is that you, dear readers
and friends, will come to vote not
just for clean government, but for
clean bathrooms as well.
