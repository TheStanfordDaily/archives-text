# Apartment Manager Licensing
## PA Awaits Strict Rental Law 
### ROBERT BACON 
"Truth in renting" with the sanction of law
comes to Palo Alto July 1 when the city's
recently-adopted apartment manager licensing
ordinance takes effect.
The ordinance requires apartment
managers to keep written records of vacant
apartments and the terms under which they
can be rented, which they must show to
prospective tenants if asked.
Managers found guilty of violating state or
federal anti-discrimination laws, or of failing
to keep the records required by the ordinance,
may have their occupational licenses revoked.
The measure was first proposed as an
attempt to combat racial discrimination, but
both its supporters and its opponents note
that it is also amenable to disputes between
landlords and their current tenants. Tenants
may invoke it in objecting to what they
believe is arbitrary or unlawful behavior by
their landlord.
One of the First
The ordinance, one of the first of its kind
in the nation, was enacted last month by the
Palo Alto City Council after considerable
debate. The concept had been developed by
the city's Human Relations commission
(HRC).
The project had its genesis in a 1971 study
of housing discrimination in Santa Clara
County conducted by University of Santa
Clara Law Prof. Stuart L. Deutsch. Deutsch
found that "apartment managers perform
regular and continual housing discrimination
within their apartment compelxes."
He urged the county to enact an ordinance
similar to that which Palo Alto has now
adopted.
Simultaneously, the Midpeninsula Citizens
for Fair Housing (MCFH) was conducting
"audits" of the largest apartment
developments in the area. By sending matched
black and white volunteers to separately
inquire about apartments, MCFH was able to
determine whether apartment managers
quoted identical terms to all prospective
tenants.
A 1971 study found 58 percent of Palo

Alto's larger apartment complexes
discriminated against nonwhites. After an
educational campaign for managers conducted
by MCFH and city officials, a 1972 audit
revealed that 56 percent of the same sample
still practiced discrimination.
Hence, said Mary Davey of MCFH, "we
began to believe that education alone wasn't
the answer. We looked for ways to monitor
the behavior of apartment mangaers."
Late last year, the HRC conducted hearings
and developed the ordinance, which was put
into legal language by assistant City Attorney
Marilyn Norek.
It requires that a sign be posted at each
apartment complex informing prospective
tenants of the anti-discrimination laws and of
the fact that they may ask to see written
records of vacancies. The sign will direct
complaints to the city manager's office.
To aid city inspectors in investigating
complaints of discrimination, each apartment
manager must keep a list — open only to city
officials, not to the public — of persons who
inquire about rentals. No prospective tenant is
required to give his name to the manager,
however.
"The ordinance is only as effective as
tenants make it," opined Julian Birnbaum of
the Palo Alto Tenants Union (PATU). "We'll
publicize it and encourage people to make use
of it."
Guilty
Norek noted that apartment managers can
be penalized only if found guilty of violating
the record-keeping requirements of the
ordinance, whether by criminal proceeding or
administrative hearing, or if found guilty in a
court proceeding of violating state or federal
anti-discrimination laws.
Short of suspending or revoking a
manager's license, the city can refer
complaints to the HRC or MCFH for
mediation, she explained.
She indicated that the ordinance is "only
concerned with conduct detrimental to the
public as a whole, not to problems between an
individual landlord and an individual tenant or
prospective tenant."

Some would like to see a tighter ordinance.
Birnbaum said the requirement of a court
conviction "weakens it a great deal. ... The
tenant must know that he has rights, and must
summon up the courage to file a
conplaint. .. . There are problems in having
tenants enforce the law."
Birnbaum also objected to the fact that the
ordinance does not cover rental single-family
homes. "It should cover all rentals. We
[PATU] suggested that and they had
considered it, but they decided against it.. . .
Every landlord ought to obey the law. We
want uniformity."
The ordinance applies to groups of two or
more adjacent dwelling units under one
ownership, with the exception of duplexes in
which the owner is a resident.
Real Estate
Not everyone favored the ordinance. Real
estate organizations were unanimous in their
opposition.
"We think education is a better way to
correct discrimination," pointed out Dale
Denson, Acting President of the Palo Alto
Real Estate Board.
'There are very strong state and federal
laws which prohibit discrimination. To
encorce them and to educate people would
solve the problem," he continued.
Harassment
Realtors charged that the ordinance was
one-sided, invaded the privacy of apartment
managers, and would open managers to
harassment by militant tenant organizations.
"Of course, now that apartment
manager licensing is enacted, we hope it
works. ... We hope it does some good,"
Denson added.
The real estate groups succeeded in having
the ordinance amended so that persons
holding real estate broker's licenses from the
state are not subject to city sanctions should
they violate the ordinance.
Norek noted that in case of an alleged
violation by a realtor, "we assume the state
real estate department will act approximately
the same as we would do. If not, we may
reconsider this exemption."
