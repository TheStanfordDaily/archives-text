# Most Meat Remains At Ceiling Price Level
## 
### Associated Press 
The shopper with a taste for
steaks, chops or even hamburger is
finding meat prices as high as they
were at the start of the month,
despite the week-long meat
boycott, an Associated Press
sampling shows.
The AP survey also showed
that more than half the meat
items checked were selling at the
maximum allowed under the price
ceilings imposed by President
Nixon on lamb, beef and pork late
last month.
Sources in the Nixon
administration said, meanwhile,
that the President may impose a
new price freeze. Their comments
came after House passage Monday
of a bill extending Nixon's
authority to impose economic
controls.
The AP checked the prices of
eight meat items in 15 cities on
April 2 — the first business day of
the boycott and the day the
Internal Revenue Service started
enforcing the price celings. It
rechecked the same cuts at the
same supermarkets on April 16.
There were a few bright spots.
Pork chops decreased in certain
areas as did a number of items on
special sale.
The survey also compared the

April 16 prices with the ceilings
posted last week. It found 63
items — 52.5 percent — were
selling at the ceiling price; 50
items were selling below the
ceiling; and 7 were unavailable.
Of the items below the ceiling,
almost half were between 6 and
10 cents per pound lower and
about 20 percent were between
11 and 20 percent lower.
None of the supermarkets
involved in the survey was among
those which announced a policy
of keeping prices below the ceiling
levels.
The items checked were one
pound each of: round steak,
center cut pork chops, chopped
chuck, sirloin steak, rib lamb
chops, veal cutlet, leg of lamb and
standing rib roast. The cities were
Baltimore, Kansas City, Oklahoma
City, Chicago, Phoenix, Atlanta,
Washington, Columbus Boston,
New Orleans, Newark,
Philadelphia, Detroit, Seattle and
Los Angeles.
