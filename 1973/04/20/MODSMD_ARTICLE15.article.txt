# Many Consumers Overlook New Auto Repair Regulations
## 
### BRUCE KADDEN 
Most people are aware of the strict smog control
laws that the state of California has imposed
regulating automobile exhaust emmissions. But
California also has some interesting and lesser
known statutes regulating auto repairs.
The Automotive Repair Act of 1971 set most of
the regulations to which all business establishments
that repair automotive vehicles must adhere.
Although the law has been in effect since June 31,
1972, many people are not aware of these
protections.
Under the act, all repair shops must be registered
with the Department of Equilization for which they
pay a $50 fee.
Besides a state license, the shops must obtain a
permit to register, a tax number from the Internal
Revenue Service, and a local license.
Service Stations Too
Mike Harris, of San Francisco Consumer Action,
a private consumer group, says that under terms of
the act, "repair shops" include service stations and
anyone working for others out of his own garage, as
well as the normal automotive repair shops.
Harris pointed out, that the chief fault with the
current state law is that there is no quality
guarantee. Many consumer groups are trying to get
enacted a "bill of competency" for mechanics.
Another important requirement found in the act
is that customers be provided with a written
estimate of the work to be done, including all new
parts that will be used and their costs. No charge in
excess of this estimate can be assessed unless the
customer is notified and gives his oral or written
consent.
Wrong Problem
Harris said that most consumer complaints occur
when a problem is originally diagnosed incorrectly.
He explained that a mechanic could diagnose the
problem as a bad valve, and after taking the engine
apart, discover that it is a much worse and costlier
problem.
If the customer chooses not to have the car
fixed, he is stuck with footing the bill for having his
engine taken apart and being put back together.
Harris is currently lobbying for a type of "reverse
contract," where if the problem is diagnosed
incorrectly, the shop must put the car back

together wihtout a charge at the owner's request.
Following the repair of a car, the mechanic or
shop must present the customer with a written
invoice explaining exactly what was done and how
much was charged for each part of the job.
This written invoice must state if any parts have
bee rebuilt. It must also have the odometer reading
at the time of service, so the customer can tell how
many miles a certain part lasts.
Anotheer part of the act states that a customer
can request to have any replaced parts returned to
him. It also provides that the customer be provided
with a copy of everything that he is required to sign.
The final part of the act forbids a repair shop
from sending a car to another shop without
notifying the customer.
Strictest Laws
Harris said that California "has the strictest
automobile repair laws at the present time. A lot of
states have not provided any guarantees at all."
Despite these strict regulations, many people run
into problems. "A lot of mechanics and service
stations do break the law because they know that
their customers are not aware of their rights," Harris
said.
"Usually women are hit and professional-type
people too," he added. Sometimes it is a case of
simply not reading the fine print on a paper the
customer signs, he explained, but generally he is
convicned people are not aware of the law.
Three Inspections
Harris suggested that if a car needs to be repaired
it should be inspected by at least three people
before the owner decides if it should be repaired.
For a transmission problem, he said the dealer
who sold the car and two transmission specialists
should be asked to inspect the car, diagnose the
problem and given an estimate.
if they all agree as to the problem, then the
person should be able to go ahead with repairs. "But
the customer shouldn't base his decision only on the
cost," Harris said.
The Automotive Repair act, Senate Bill 51, was
originally introduced on Jan. 6, 1971. Senators
Anthony Beilenson (D—Los Angeles), Alfred Song
(D—Los Angeles), and James Whetmore (R—Orange)
co-authored the bill which was amended eight times
before being passed.

If the customer chooses not to have the car
fixed, he is stuck with footing the bill for having his
engine taken apart and being put back together.
Harris is currently lobbying for a type of "reverse
contract," where if the problem is diagnosed
incorrectly, the shop must put the car back

together wihtout a charge at the owner's request.
Following the repair of a car, the mechanic or
shop must present the customer with a written
invoice explaining exactly what was done and how
much was charged for each part of the job.
This written invoice must state if any parts have
bee rebuilt. It must also have the odometer reading
at the time of service, so the customer can tell how
many miles a certain part lasts.
Anotheer part of the act states that a customer
can request to have any replaced parts returned to
him. It also provides that the customer be provided
with a copy of everything that he is required to sign.
The final part of the act forbids a repair shop
from sending a car to another shop without
notifying the customer.
Strictest Laws
Harris said that California "has the strictest
automobile repair laws at the present time. A lot of
states have not provided any guarantees at all."
Despite these strict regulations, many people run
into problems. "A lot of mechanics and service
stations do break the law because they know that
their customers are not aware of their rights," Harris
said.
"Usually women are hit and professional-type
people too," he added. Sometimes it is a case of
simply not reading the fine print on a paper the
customer signs, he explained, but generally he is
convicned people are not aware of the law.
Three Inspections
Harris suggested that if a car needs to be repaired
it should be inspected by at least three people
before the owner decides if it should be repaired.
For a transmission problem, he said the dealer
who sold the car and two transmission specialists
should be asked to inspect the car, diagnose the
problem and given an estimate.
if they all agree as to the problem, then the
person should be able to go ahead with repairs. "But
the customer shouldn't base his decision only on the
cost," Harris said.
The Automotive Repair act, Senate Bill 51, was
originally introduced on Jan. 6, 1971. Senators
Anthony Beilenson (D—Los Angeles), Alfred Song

co-authored the bill which was amended eight times

REPAIRS NEEDED — State statutes regulating auto repair have apparently been overlooked amid the
strong smog controls being discussed on the national and local levels. The Automative Repair Act of 1971
requires registration and licensing of all auto repair shops in the state.
Most people are aware of the strict smog control
laws that the state of California has imposed
regulating automobile exhaust emmissions. But
California also has some interesting and lesser
known statutes regulating auto repairs.
The Automotive Repair Act of 1971 set most of
the regulations to which all business establishments
that repair automotive vehicles must adhere.
Although the law has been in effect since June 31,
1972, many people are not aware of these
protections.
Under the act, all repair shops must be registered
with the Department of Equilization for which they
pay a $50 fee.
Besides a state license, the shops must obtain a
permit to register, a tax number from the Internal
Revenue Service, and a local license.
Service Stations Too
Mike Harris, of San Francisco Consumer Action,
a private consumer group, says that under terms of
the act, "repair shops" include service stations and
anyone working for others out of his own garage, as
well as the normal automotive repair shops.
Harris pointed out, that the chief fault with the
current state law is that there is no quality
guarantee. Many consumer groups are trying to get
enacted a "bill of competency" for mechanics.
Another important requirement found in the act
is that customers be provided with a written
estimate of the work to be done, including all new
parts that will be used and their costs. No charge in
excess of this estimate can be assessed unless the
customer is notified and gives his oral or written
consent.
Wrong Problem
Harris said that most consumer complaints occur
when a problem is originally diagnosed incorrectly.
He explained that a mechanic could diagnose the
problem as a bad valve, and after taking the engine
apart, discover that it is a much worse and costlier
problem.
If the customer chooses not to have the car
fixed, he is stuck with footing the bill for having his
engine taken apart and being put back together.
