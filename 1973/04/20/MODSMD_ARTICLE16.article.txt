One reason many people do not ride their bikes on bike paths is
that most of the ramps at street crossing are too steep, while at some
crossings the concrete linings make almost a verticle step about Wto
1" high. It is obvious that the designers of these ramps and concrete
borders never ride bikes -at least, not on those ramps. The designers
should keep in mind that bikes do not come with shock absorbers and
those little concrete steps hit hard on the rim of a wheel while
climbing a ramp. Do you think this situation can be corrected? J.P.
Roads and Grounds Manager Perry Hackett said that the ramps were
built a number of years ago and that this is the first complaint that he
has received.
He went on to say that some of them are fairly steep because they
were built as ramps into the street rather than cuts in the curb.
Hackett would like J.P. to call him at ext. 4388 and give him
additional information about the location of the especially steep
ramps. He said that the reason ramps and bike paths are built is to
encourage bicyclists, and if bicyclists are unhappy, something should
be done about the situation.

Why was Stern Hall built in its ugly barracfis style, and have
exterior "fixes" been considered to bring its appearance more in
harmony with other campus buildings? G.I.
Edward Scoles, Director of Housing Management, said that the
main reason for Stern's "Spartan design" was Stanford's budgetary
limitations when Stern was being built. This was confirmed by Roger
Cairns of the Planning Department, who added that Stern was built in
increments beginning at the time of the Depression and at this time
funds were difficult to get.
Improvements to the exterior of Stern Hall have been considered,
but they are low priority and high-cost.
In 1963, for example, the Undergraduate Student Housing
Committee made recommendations for improving student's living
quarters. Their priorities, in order, were: student rooms, public areas,
and exteriors.
It was estimated that the costs of landscaping, painting and
repairing the exterior of Stern would be $240,000, and this cost
doesn't include such things as a red tile roof, which would make Stern
look more like other campus buildings.

harmony with other campus buildings? G.I.
Edward Scoles, Director of Housing Management, said that the
main reason for Stern's "Spartan design" was Stanford's budgetary
limitations when Stern was being built. This was confirmed by Roger
Cairns of the Planning Department, who added that Stern was built in
increments beginning at the time of the Depression and at this time
funds were difficult to get.
Improvements to the exterior of Stern Hall have been considered,
but they are low priority and high-cost.
In 1963, for example, the Undergraduate Student Housing
Committee made recommendations for improving student's living
quarters. Their priorities, in order, were: student rooms, public areas,
and exteriors.
It was estimated that the costs of landscaping, painting and
repairing the exterior of Stern would be $240,000, and this cost
doesn't include such things as a red tile roof, which would make Stern
look more like other campus buildings.
