# 'SLAC Operates Bubble Chamber
## 
### 
The world's fastest bubble chamber—another
advanced tool of physicists for unlocking secrets of
the atom—is in operation at the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center (SLAC).
Built by a SLAC team of bubble chamber
specialists, the RCBC (rapid-cycling bubble
chamber) makes invisible subnuclear collisions
visible at the rate of 20 per second. It is expected to
boost this to .30 per second soon, and eventually to
60 per second.
To particle physicists experimenting with the
two-mile, 20-billion-volt linear electron accelerator,
this means many more nuclear "events" — releases

of energy or new particles from particle collisions —
can be photographed.
Some events are so rare they occur only once in
every 100,000 or so collisions. The speedup
therefore means a great increase in information
because of the RCBC's ability to detect more events
per second. It also allows physicists to give more
attention to rare particle interactions they
previously found difficult to study.
The RCBC contains liquid hydrogen at
approximately 411 degrees below zero Fahrenheit,
slightly above its boiling point, in a cyclindrical
bubble chamber 5V2 inches high by 15 inches in
diameter.

political points. Protection of the property of members of the community against damage from deliberate
acts of others has long been treated as a basic aspect of the Fundamental Standard." —Stanford Judicial
