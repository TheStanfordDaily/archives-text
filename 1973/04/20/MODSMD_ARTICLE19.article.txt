# 'Kweli Kwa Weusi' Combines Variety Of Artistic Talents
## 
### CHARLES OGLETREE 
"Kweli Kwa Weusi" (Black
Truth) an original musical
production featuring dance, music
and poetry, had its premiere
Sunday, April 15 in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium.
"Kweli Kwa Weusi" centers
around an ancient African
philosophy adopted by Maulana
Karenga, who gathered his ideas
from the Ki-Swahili people. It is
based on the seven principles of
Karenga's system which are
Umoja (unity), Kujicha Gulia
(Self-determination), Ujima
(collective work and
responsibility), Ujamaa
(Cooperative economics), Nia
(purpose), Kuumba (Creativity),
and Imani (faith). The system is
called Kawaida, which means
"that which is customarily or

traditionally adhered to, by black
people."
The performance begins with
the sound of thunder and the beat
of drums emerging from the pit.
From the left of the stage,
Wha-Lee, the featured poet in the
performance, approaches the
audience and with an explosive
force shouts the following: "To
anybody that thinks a devil will
change his horns. ..
"You a punk,
yo'daddy's a skunk,
Wid-who yo mama
freaked off wid,
To git-cha,
how she got-cha
Eatin' all the shit
He can throw at cha!
Immediate Involvement
The power of Wha-Lee's

opening lines immediately gets the
audience involved in the
production. The first dance is
called the "Dance of Unity" based
on the first principle. Reggie
Johnson and Anne Kenney the
major characters in the Umoja
dance, display exceptional agility
and coordination in performing
several difficult routines.
Kujichaguiia (self-determina
tion) features Warren Hayman,
Jr., Ben Bluitt, Reggie Ishman,
and Gary Cain with Bob Dixon
playing flute.
Ujima (collective work and
responsibility) the third principle,
involves the entire cast, utilizing
poetry dance and the fourteen
piece rhythm section. As the cast
performs the third principle,
Wha-Lee enters reciting one of his
original poems entitled "I wonder
Why." Throughout the recitation,
Wha-Lee plays the Kalimba.
Ujamaa involved an original
musical score composed by Steve
Gill. It's very difficult to sit
through this performance — there
is an urge to leave your seat and
get involved in this moving
performance..
New Light
At this point the performance
takes a new light. Nia, the fifth
principle, explains the purpose of
the principle as well as a need to
define one's goals and objectives.
Gary Cain provides a unique
touch to the song "A Change Will
Come." Cain's version of the tune
is so effective that the entire cast
and audience are moved.
The dance of creativity, which

is choreographed by Ben W.
Dunn, provides an excellent free
mind, free will approach to
creative thought.
The finale, appropriately
entitled Imani (faith), was a
prefect display of talent and
artistry. The idea of "Black Seeds
Keep on Growing" sets in the
minds of the audience as the cast
performs the last number.
As the cast begins to exit.
Wha-Lee crosses the stage as
boldly as he had during his initial
entrance and recites:
"Well, un ... you've heard every
thing I've had to say.
But, I un ... see you still gonna
act the same old way.
Well, luh .. . Can't do nuthin'
but say,
"O-K
Fuck it..."
and you ...
and the Horse
that you rode here on . . .
right on . ..
right on . ..
Brenda Saunders, musical
composer-arranger, and Delores
Cayou, choreographer, combined
their professional talents resulting
in an excellent performance. The
only word that can adequately
define Wha-Lee is fantastic. The
rhythm section and choir also
performed exceptionally well.
This is a performance you would
regret missing. But don't take my
word. Go see it. There will be a
performance Saturday, April 21,
at 8. There will be no
performance tonight.
