# Kleindienst Quits Watergate Case
## 
### Associated Press 
WASHINGTON - Atty. Gen. Richard
G. Kleindienst announced yesterday
he has withdrawn from the Watergate
investigation because it involves
friends and associates.
His announcement followed reports
that President Nixon's campaign
deputy accused John N. Mitchell and
Counsel to the President John W. Dean
III of planning the Democratic party
bugging.
In another development, a lawyer
has filed papers in court saying that an
unidentified client last summer took
eight cardboard boxes of documents
from the White House complex,
including plans for the Watergate
wiretapping, before the FBI had a
chance to see them.
The charge that Mitchell and Dean
helped the Watergate planning was
attributed to Jeb Stuart Magruder,
formerly the number two man in the
Nixon campaign organization.
No Scapegoat
Dean, the President's official
lawyer, did not respond directly but
told newsmen he will not become a
scapegoat in the case. His statement
apparently took the White House by
surprise.
The allegations were published in
yesterday's Washington Post. Mitchell
called them "nonsense."
Kleindienst, who replaced Mitchell
as attorney general when Mitchell
became Nixon's campaign director,
said he turned the probe over to Asst.

Atty. Gen. Henry Peterson because it
"related to persons with whom I have
had personal and professional
relationships."
"It would be entirely inappropriate
for me to exercise control over the
sensitive matters being developed by
the Department of Justice," the
attorney general said.
Sources close to the Senate's
Watergate investigation say the Justice
Department plans to seek grand jury
indictments against eight present and
former Nixon administration officials
and employees.
Indictments Next Week
Indictments against four of the
eight are likely to be handed down
next week by a federal grand jury,
sources said. They added that Justice
Department plans to ask for perjury
charges against Magruder and Sally
Harmony, secretary to one of the
Watergate conspirators.
Senate sources told the Associated
Press that besides Magruder and
Harmony, indictments may be sought
against Mitchell, Dean, Frederick C.
Laßue, Gordon Strachan, Dwight
Chapin and Charles W. Colson.
Laßue, a Mitchell associate and

high official in the campaign, and
Strachan, a former aide to White
House Chief of Staff H.R. Haldeman,
could be charged with financial
misconduct in connection with the
handling of campaign funds, the
sources said.
The charges against Mitchell and
Dean would center around the
planning of the break-in.
Harmony, former secretary to
Liddy, might be indicted to bring
pressure on Liddy to talk, the sources
said. Liddy's attorney, Peter J.
Maroulis, visited him yesterday in jail,
where he is serving a sentence for
contempt of a court order to tell what
he knows about Watergate.
Planners
The Washington Post reported that
Magruder told federal investigators
Saturday that Mitchell and Dean
approved and helped plan the
wiretapping of the Democratic
headquarters and later "arranged to
buy the silence of the seven convicted
Watergate conspirators."
Warning
Dean cautioned against "drawing
any conclusions as to the guilt or
involvement of any persons until all

the facts are known."
But he added: "Some may hope or
think that I will become a scapegoat in
the Watergate case. Anyone who
believes this does not know me, know
the true facts, no' understand our
system of justice ... I believe that the
case will be fully and justly handled by
the grand jury and the Ervin select
committee."
Peter H. Wolf, a Washington
attorney, said in papers filed in federal
court Thursday he represents a former
employee of the re-election committee
who picked up the eight cartons at the
Office Building, adjacent to
the White House, the day after the
break-in at the Watergate office
building.
He said the cartons included
materials from the office of E. Howard
Hunt, one of the seven convicted
Watergate conspirators, who had
worked at the White House.
Hunt's desk and safe were opened
after the White House learned of his
connection with the break-in and the
contents were held for a week by Dean
before Dean turned them over to the
FBI.

The Washington Post reported that
Magruder told federal investigators
Saturday that Mitchell and Dean
approved and helped plan the
wiretapping of the Democratic

Warning
Dean cautioned against "drawing

Peter H. Wolf, a Washington
attorney, said in papers filed in federal
court Thursday he represents a former
employee of the re-election committee
who picked up the eight cartons at the
Office Building, adjacent to
the White House, the day after the
break-in at the Watergate office
building.
He said the cartons included
materials from the office of E. Howard
Hunt, one of the seven convicted
Watergate conspirators, who had
worked at the White House.
Hunt's desk and safe were opened

connection with the break-in and the

WASHINGTON - Atty. Gen. Richard
G. Kleindienst announced yesterday
he has withdrawn from the Watergate
investigation because it involves
friends and associates.
His announcement followed reports
that President Nixon's campaign
deputy accused John N. Mitchell and
Counsel to the President John W. Dean
III of planning the Democratic party
bugging.
In another development, a lawyer
has filed papers in court saying that an
unidentified client last summer took
eight cardboard boxes of documents
from the White House complex,
including plans for the Watergate
wiretapping, before the FBI had a
chance to see them.
The charge that Mitchell and Dean
helped the Watergate planning was
attributed to Jeb Stuart Magruder,
formerly the number two man in the
Nixon campaign organization.
No Scapegoat
Dean, the President's official
lawyer, did not respond directly but
told newsmen he will not become a
scapegoat in the case. His statement
apparently took the White House by
surprise.
The allegations were published in
yesterday's Washington Post. Mitchell
called them "nonsense."
Kleindienst, who replaced Mitchell
as attorney general when Mitchell
became Nixon's campaign director,
said he turned the probe over to Asst.

Atty. Gen. Henry Peterson because it
"related to persons with whom I have
had personal and professional
relationships."
"It would be entirely inappropriate
for me to exercise control over the
sensitive matters being developed by
the Department of Justice," the
attorney general said.
Sources close to the Senate's
Watergate investigation say the Justice
Department plans to seek grand jury
indictments against eight present and
former Nixon administration officials
and employees.
Indictments Next Week
Indictments against four of the
eight are likely to be handed down
next week by a federal grand jury,
sources said. They added that Justice
Department plans to ask for perjury
charges against Magruder and Sally
Harmony, secretary to one of the
Watergate conspirators.
Senate sources told the Associated
Press that besides Magruder and
Harmony, indictments may be sought
against Mitchell, Dean, Frederick C.
Laßue, Gordon Strachan, Dwight
Chapin and Charles W. Colson.
Laßue, a Mitchell associate and

high official in the campaign, and
Strachan, a former aide to White
House Chief of Staff H.R. Haldeman,
could be charged with financial
misconduct in connection with the
handling of campaign funds, the
sources said.
