## Fine 'Thoreau' Production 
### MARC D. KAYE 
Last Saturday night I had the
opportunity to see one of the
finer dramatic productions
presented on campus this year.
Stanford's own amateur student
dramatic group, the Company,
performed Lawrence and Lee's
"The Night Thoreau Spent in
Jail," in of all places, the Branner
Hall Dining Room.
For a group bereft of essential
resources, especially financial, the
show was very well done. Talent
on a shoestring budget
predominated: the lighting and
sound effects, and the stark but
powerful staging transformed a
Stanford dining hall into a local
neighborhood theatre.
Beyond the acting, which in
most cases was superlative for
such a student group, the effort
and time expended in preparation
for the show was very evident.
The stage had movable elements,
which shows an eye for
imaginative staging.
Authentic Costumes
The costumes were authentic
enough. And the makeup was
equally so. The use of foreground
and background action, often in
contrast, made for a refreshing
version of the play. The two parts

of stage thrust out at the audience
on which the secondary characters
acted and commented on Thoreau
certainly involved the audience.
'The Night Thoreau Spent in
Jail" was an excellent choice of
material for a student audience.
The theme was serious and at
times philosophical yet the plot
was peppered with an abounding
humor which lightened the
evening. At times the play got a

bit too heavy and ideological, but
this is the doing of the playwright.
The acting, except in a few
instances, was as natural as
Thoreau's 'Walden Pond.' And the
acting flowed and really captured
the audience's attention. Jeff
Segal, in the lead role, was at ease
and convincing on stage. He
believeably drew the audience
into Thoreau's highly moral yet
humorous world.
Duf Sundheim playing Bailey,
Thoreau's simple minded
character foil in jail, was simply
excellent. He achieved a nice

mixture of humor and serious
naivete to bring his role off—to
the audience's delight.
John Magee as the
cantankerous and wise cracking
Ralph Waldo Emerson, Thoreau's
elderly mentor, should be
appreciated. Besides looking like
the Waldo Emerson, Magee
exhibited many of the quaint
mannerisms of the time and era,
as well as Emerson's

procrastinating, ruminating, and
slightly hypocritical character
traits.
Hopefully, Emerson had as
foxy a wife in real life as Magee
had on stage. The highly sexist
remark in the play uttered by
Thoreau that the ideal wife ought
to be brainless was met with
appropriate hisses from the
audience.
Yet Magee's stage wife, Wendy
Marshall, was an appropriate
object for not only Emerson's
elderly desires, but also for
Thoreau's (when Waldo was away

in England discoursing with
Carlyle!). And Marshall's Lydian
was very intelligently performed,
albeit a bit restrained.
Good Acting
Susie Malouf merits mention as
Thoreau's devoted and religious
mother. Brad Fischer as Thoreau's
brother John was amusing to
watch. He approached his
character with a good deal of
enthusiasm and vitality: so fitting
a tragic character who passed
away in the prime of life — having
cut himself with a rusty razor
while laughing aloud to himself!
John Manley was rightly an
uptight old codger of a New
England deacon. And Dennis
Young was touching as Sam, the
runaway slave. Tom Ehrlichman
was quite a sight as a rickety,
arthritic bent over old man, who
became enraged quite easily over
Henry David's excesses.
All in all, the Company did an
entertaining service to the
community by presenting "The
Night Thoreau Spent in Jail,"
directed by Marc Emrich. This
young and striving Company has
more ambitious projects in
the making, with the vital help of
the Stanford community.
For the future, the Company is
planning to present Synge's classic
"Riders of the Sea," a version of
Goethe's "Faust," and a rendition
of "Romeo and Juliet." Such an
effort warrants our support, both
financially and in terms of
interested talent. The Company
welcomes and deserves any such
contributions from the Stanford
community.
