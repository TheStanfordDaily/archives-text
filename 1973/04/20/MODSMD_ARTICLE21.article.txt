# 'Orestes' Newly Translated
## 
### 
"Orestes," the text of which is
derived from Prof. John Chioles'
new translation of the play,
continues tonight and tomorrow
and April 24-28 in the Little
Theater on the north side of
Memorial Auditorium.
The most widely performed
and respected translation of
"Orestes" was published by
William Arrowsmith in 1958.
Chioles, assistant professor of
dramatic literature and criticism,
feels that Greek masterpieces
should be newly translated for
each generation.
"Greek translations become

quickly dead and lose their
immediacy," Chiole says.
"Today's English, poetic and
otherwise, is drawing nearer to the
power and directness of the
Greek."
Chioles, born in Greece, is both
a scholar and "a man of the
theater."
Chioles has already written and
has produced his own translations
of Euripedes' "Electra" and
"Alcestis," as well as Sophocles'
"Ajax" and Aristophanes'
"Lysistrata." In addition, he has
worked professionally as a
director and actor in New York
and at the Berkeley Repertory
Theater. During recent summers
Chioles has worked with the
Greek National Theater where he
directed Tragedienne Auro
Synodinou.
At Stanford Chioles directed a
production of Genet's "Death
Match" and is presently directing
Arrabal's 'The Architect and the
Emperor of Assyria," which opens
a 16-performance run at the
Nitery May 8.

The setting for "Orestes" has
been designed by M.F.A. design
student Donnell Brendan Walsh.
The costumes are designed by
M.F.A. design student Judith
Dolan. Stage manager is Thomas
Arntsen, sound engineer is Shawn
Murphy.
Both settings and costumes
reflect the stark decay of a great
civilization with monochromatic,
fragmentary, sculptural effects.
The abstract elements of the
environment freeze the action of
the play in time, emphasizing the
ambiguity of time, place, and sex.
Orestes is played by Eric Booth
Miller, and Electra by Carolyn
Gillespie. The play is directed by
John Olon-Scrymgeour. Peter
Moore plays Orestes' friend,
Pylades.
Tickets are at Tresidder box
office, Ticketron agencies and in
the lobby box office in the Little
Theater at 7:30 nightly. All
curtains are at 8 p.m. Late comers
cannot be seated until there is an
appropriate break.
