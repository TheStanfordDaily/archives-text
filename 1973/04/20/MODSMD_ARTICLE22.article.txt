# Irrelevant 'Relevance' In 'Gentlemen Of Verona'
## 
### JEFFERY SEGAL 
A large serving of Papp is being
fed to the audience on the stage
of the Curran Theater in San
Francisco these days in the Tony
award-winning musical, 'Two
Gentlemen of Verona." It is easy
to see why this show, produced
by Joseph Papp and the New
York Shakespeare Festival is such
a crowd pleaser.

Also reflected plainly in the
popularity of this energetic
inferior work, the degree to which
the theater public has had to
compromise its taste these days in
its headfirst plunge into the quest
for vapid, escapist, entertainment.
Based very loosely on
Shakespeare's play of the same
name, "Two Gentlemen of
Verona" features Larry Kert as

Proteus and Clifton Davis as
Valentine, two young men of
Verona who pledge each other
their life-long friendship.
Valentine then sails to seek his
fortune at the court of the
Emperor of Milan. Proteus,
however, remains in Verona to
win the heart of fair Julia, played
by Edith Diaz.
But after winning from Julia
her heart and more, Proteus leaves
her with nothing but a string of
pearls to remember him by, and
sails away to find Valentine in
Milan. Julia, now pregnant, and
her girlfriend, Lucetta, acted by
Jaque Lynn Colton, disguise
themselves as men for safety, and
travel to Milan in pursuit of
Proteus.
Quick Exchange
Meanwhile Proteus has quickly
exchanged the memory of Julia's
love for more immediate rapture,
having fallen in love with the
daughter of the emperor of Milan,
Silvia, portrayed by Jonelle Allen.
Proteus, not recognizing his
former love, hires her dressed as a
boy to help him woo Silvia. But
affairs are further complicated,
because Silvia and Valentine are in
love. Therefore, Proteus decides
to betray his friend to the mayor,
who would prefer to marry off
Silvia to a wealthy local castrato,
and to abscond with Silvia
himself.
But he is again thwarted by
fate and beaten to his intended
capture by her former lover,
Eglamour, just returned from the
war. A scene in the forest on
Silvia's wedding night brings all
the would-be lovers together, and
as the magic and folly of love
would have it, everybody gets
happily mated to the proper
party.
In a recent Vogue Magazine
interview, Papp talked about the
elements which attracted him to
Shakespeare and eventually led to
the founding of his festival.
"I was interested in the
richness of the language, and I was
interested in the humanity of
Shakespeare—and I was interested
in finding an American way of
playing him ... do justice to the
language and still be real; find a
kind of American speech that was
not localized in any way but that
was good, American speech."
Sadly, only parts of his artistic
thesis hold up in this production.
Musical Blend
In an effort to bring
Shakespeare into the hearts of
contemporary Americans, this
production blends rock music and
lyrics with both original and
additional dialogue. The cast is
multiracial, with leads played by
blacks, whites, Chinese, and
Puerto Ricans. Thus the play
becomes a metaphor for New
York City itself, a theatrical
melting pot. This concept is
interesting and effective.
But George Bernard Shaw
made a good point when he said
that America and England are two
countries separated by a common
language. Papp's view that the
Americanization of Shakespeare is
the way to communicate the
essence of his thought to the
American people is part of the
unfortunate approach taken to
Shakespeare in this musical. This
supposedly justifies subjecting the
audience to hearing New Yorker
Larry Kert and Cleveland-born
John McCurry who plays the
Duke, sabotage the beauty of the
Bard's poetry.
Luckily, the dignity of this
native American approach is saved
by some skilled performances.
Clifton Davis blends a beautiful
voice with an appealing vocal
style, and brings a warmth and
naturalness to his role that takes
full advantage of the flow of the

language in an unaffected,
innately American sense. Davis is
the show's best asset.
Also excellent is the
performance of Jonelle Allen.
Loudness and sensuality are the
two basic prerequisites of her
character, which she polishes off
with a keen comic timing.
Effervescent Character
Effervescent Jaque Lynn
Colton, although a subordinate
character, always overshadows the
often self-conscious acting of
Edith Diaz whenever the two are
together on stage. Like a cross
between Peggy Cass and Totie
Fields. Colton literally and
delightfully fills the stage with her
presence.
These three performers inject a
vitality and immediacy into the
show that the writing and
direction failed to provide as well.
The script by John Guare, author
of "House of Blue Leaves" now
playing at the ACT, and Mel
Shapiro, also the director of this
production, is basically a choppy,
confused mixture of
Shakespeare's own lines and
modern slang idioms such as
"Right on!" thrown in at the end
of a section of Shakespearian
dialogue. Supposedly, this makes
the Shakespeare relevant and
"now."
The awkwardness of the

writing is further accentuated by
Shapiro's direction. He allows his
actors to zip through the
Shakespearian dialogue as if it
didn't exist just to get to the
laugh he wants by the interjection
of a "Peace, brother!," or some
such phrase. This technique
should elicit only embarrassed
laughter from an audience of
taste.
Neither writer nor director give
the Bard credit for having written
a funny play himself, and both try
to work the humor around it. This
approach is a far cry from the
brilliance of director Peter
Brook's interpretation of "A
Midsummer Night's Dream,"
which so skillfully cut through to
the essential humanity of
Shakespearian comedy.
Forgettable Lyrics
For the most part Buare's
infantile lyrics are as easily
forgettable as Gait MacDermot's
banal melodies. Both get
hopelessly lost in MacDermot's
efforts to experiment with new
rhythms against very standard
rock back up beats and
orchestrations. Co-orchestrator is
Harold Wheeler.
Not all of the score, however,
deserves this blanket dismissal. In
paticular, the number "Night
Letter," as performed by Davis
and Allen, is one of the most

rousing, sensual, and suggestive
numbers seen on the musical
stage. It is a new generation of the
love scene, in which the heroine
writhes in emotional ecstacy on a
table, beating time with trembling
thighs, while the hero sings of his
love in this metaphorical sense.
Visually the stage is graced by
a brilliant, constructivist, unit set
designed by Ming Cho Lee. A
skeletal jungle gym of multilevel
platforms is the basis of the set,
and suggestive, flown fragments
complete the required visual
pictures. Sadly, the staging
possibilities of the set are put to
minimal use by director Shapiro.
The costumes by Theoni V.
Aldredge are unobtrusive and
blend well into the production.
Lighting by Lawrence Meltzner

and choreography by Dennis
Nahat are competent and
functional, although rather
uninspired.
The saving grace of this
production is the apparent
enjoyment within the cast of each
other when onstage. No doubt
this feeling of camaraderie exists
in the show primarily because the
actors have nothing to cling to but
themselves. Sadly, a good deal of
potential worth is hopelessly
bogged down in general inanity.
A timeless play has become a
timely musical in the mistaken
belief that to focus on current
elements of popular culture is a
quicker way to touch modern
man than to help him slice
through all the glitter, and find his
humanity beneath.
