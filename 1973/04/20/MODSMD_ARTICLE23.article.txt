# 'Heartbreak Kid': Funny, But True
## 
### LUCIA SCHULTZ 
"The Heartbreak Kid" is a comedy, but don't go expecting just to
laugh. Like 'The Graduate," "Taking Off" and "Made for Each
Other," this movie is part of a new breed of American comedies, in
which funny reflections of modern life reveal the bitter ironies and
truth hidden beneath them.
The last film Neil Simon wrote, 'The Out-of-Towners," was so
malicious and its comedy so forced that it quickly ceased to be funny
at all and became quite unpleasant. "Heartbreak Kid," however, has
its serious side but never loses its ability to amuse. It is Elaine May's
movie; she takes the Simon material and fills it with her own
marvelous insight into character, setting, and detail.
Lila and Lenny, a young Jewish couple, are newlyweds on their
honeymoon in Miami Beach. Three days after the wedding, Lila is in
bed with a sunburn and Lenny has fallen madly in love with a cool
blond from Minnesota.
The characters are just stereotypical enough that they can be
laughed at, yet they are sketched so precisely that they may seem
painfully real. Jeannie Berlin (Elaine May's daughter) is Lila, the
young bride who eats Milky Ways in bed on her wedding. Having
planned her life for the next fifty years with Lenny, she is rudely
shocked when her husband decides to dump her after five days.
Her performance is wonderful, as is Charles Grodin's as Lenny, the
brash young go-getter with a sort of desperate ingenuity. Cybill
Shepherd plays the body beautiful. She effectively demonstrates that
acting ability is no object and for a large part of the audience her
mere physical presence is enough.
Even so, she does play a number of scenes qujte well and is in fact
ideal for the role of the girl whose response to the man who has just
left his wife and everything he owns for her, is "Gee,l'm really
flattered." As her parents, Eddie Albert, appropriately stone-faced
and hard-nosed, and Audra Lindley, as the concerned mother, are
excellently cast.
'The Heartbreak Kid" is funny, and at the same time very sad.
Lenny finds his American Dream all too easily within his grasp; the
mixed feelings experienced by the audience are his, as he is left
suspended between a crazy, mixed-up past and an empty future.
