# Elsen Lectures On Picasso
## 
### MELODY BROADBENT 
"There's the artist, warm flesh
in one hand and cold champagne
in the other. No other artist was
so in touch with reality as
Picasso." A group of 300 people
absorbed with great appreciation
the lecture and slides presented by
Prof. Albert Elsen Monday night.
Even a non-artsy poli sci major
like myself got caught up in the
spirit of an evening of Culture.
Giving, "not a memorial
lecture, but a Thanksgiving,"
Elsen eloquently outlined the
style of Picasso and his gifts to
mankind. For Picasso, the
statement or ethics of modern art
needed to be personaUzed. His
motto was that one must "work
from personal experience in a
style individually acquired."
The idea of "art as work"
began in Picasso's childhood.
Under the guidance of a father
who wanted his son to become a
famous artist, Picasso worked
every day at making art since his
childhood. This is one reason that
Picasso has given so much to the
world, just in the sheer number of
works he produced.
Child-like Spirit
It wasn't until Picasso was an
adult, however, that he learned to
draw like a child. Studying
children's art and comic strips,
Picasso instantly admired the
directness, truthfulness, and
economy of effort that a child's
work exhibits. Picasso felt that
most artists bludgeoned ideas
through belaborment rather than
capturing their spirit.
For Picasso, art meant
capturing ideas in form. To
belabor the idea was to obscure
the form. At the same time,
though, he would never let an
option pass. Before going to bed,
he would have Francoise (his
lover) make a copy of the art he
had completed that day. The
following day he could then
explore the work as much as
possible, though still able to come
back to the original if he disliked
his newest creation. He never
threw anything away because his
art was always in a state of flux.
Picasso also felt deeply that the
artist must not become an
illustrator. For him, the
expression of art resided in what

the artist did and not what his
characters did. Stating that
"Expression is more than just a
face," Picasso used his paintings as
an outlet for intense emotions.
One of his more revealing
statements was "I don't
appreciate anything, I either love
it or hate it."
Transcends Form
In an attempt to transcend
form, Picasso took art inside the
human body where he could dwell
on the purity of shapes which he
loved. In essence he revised the
grammar or syntax of the human
body. From this perspective came
the birth of cubism.
In Elsen's words, "Picasso
knew how to make love to a
woman in a myriad of ways
through art." As exhibited in
much of Picasso's work, there is
the attempt to show the entire
beauty of a woman's form in just

one painting. A woman's
buttocks, breasts, and face appear
simultaneously in one form to
indicate three different states of
mind.
To criticisms that Picasso never
did have a definite style, he
responded, "God is just another
artist. He invented the giraffe, the
lion, etc. He showed no consistent
style." Picasso was fond of
considering himself "a colony of
artists." In an unorthodox
manner, his mood would
determine the mode of his art.
Enthusiastic Audience
The obvious richness of Picasso
and his style exuded from Elsen's
lecture and was eagerly absorbed
by the audience. One had the
impression that the 300 people in
attendance had all loved Picasso
and had come together to share
their appreciation on the day of
his burial.

Elsen also discussed Picasso's
artistic contributions to history.
His utilization of African art
allowed the world to look in an
unprejudiced way at the art of
other cultures. For Picasso, "His
experience with African art
introduced an alternative to
museum niceties. '
Other contributions mentioned
were Picasso's gentle reminders
that contemporary art is enriched
by our experiences with older art,
and that we can look on
everything that man makes as
having a face and an expression.
As Elsen commented, "Picasso
liked the oscillating life of
objects."
As Picasso utilized line to
create harmony, so the audience
Monday night was shaped into a
form with harmony and balance.
A great time of Picasso-reverie was
had by all.
