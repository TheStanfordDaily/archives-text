# Vengeful Netmen Host UCLA, USC
## 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
Stanford's varsity tennis team
gets its chance to avenge its only
two defeats of the year as the
Cardinals host UCLA and USC
today and tomorrow, respectively.
The team's attitude is grim
going into the weekend matches,
as they know that if Stanford
doesn't win both matches, their
status as favorite for the NCAA
title will be irretrievably
shattered.
Capacity crowds of about 1000
are expected to throng to both
events, which match the three
finest collegiate teams in the U.S.
Prospective spectators are urged
to arrive about one-and-a-half
hours prior to the 1 p.m. starting
times to ensure themselves of a
good seat.
Coach Dick Gould has changed
his lineup considerably since
Stanford lost 6-3 to USC and 5-4
to UCLA in Los Angeles two
weeks ago, in an effort to bolster
the team's sagging fouth and fifth
singles slots and weak doubles
lineup.
The verdict on Gould's new
lineup (see box) is not yet in, but
prospects are high for wins at the
lower singles positions. "Pat
[DuPrel, Chip [Fisher] and John
[Whitlinger] have all been playing
real well," Gould said, "against
Cal, against San Diego, and against
Arizona."
Unexpected Trouble
The Cardinals won all three of
these tune-up matches, most
recently topping Arizona 6-3
Wednesday. However, while

Stanford got wins at the
lower positions, a new and
unexpected source of trouble
popped up against Arizona—the
top singles slots.
Number two man Jim Delaney
lost his first match of the year
Wednesday in a real upset, while
third player Rick Fisher also was
defeated.
The Cards' top player, Sandy
Mayer, barely averted defeat
against Arizona by winning a
third-set tiebreaker over Rand
Evett. Thus, Stanford nealy blew
all three top matches against an
Arizona team which is good, but
certainly not as tough as either
USC or UCLA.
'Better Play Better'
"Our top three'd better play
better than they did today," a
nervous Gould said abstractly as
he watched the doubles matches
Wednesday. "We've got to do
better to win."
The near-loss by Mayer was
a real shocker, as the junior is not
yet in top form. Mayer this
weekend faces the two players
most likely to halt his drive for
the NCAA singles title.
These center-court matches
will offer a contrast in styles.
UCLA's Jeff Austin likes to hit
every shot hard, while USC's Raul
Ramirez, the only college player
to beat Mayer this year, is a deft
"touch player."
Doubles Changes
The last time Stanford played
the Los Angeles powers, the
singles matches broke even (3-3)
both times, leaving the match up
to the doubles teams. And both
times, Stanford blew the doubles.
Gould's new doubles lineup is
specially modeled to avert future
catastrophes. Mayer and Delaney

have been paired for the first time
at first doubles, and although this
"dream team" may not yet be
experienced enough to beat USC
and UCLA's top teams, it certainly
will do well in the NCAAs in
June.
The Mayer-Delaney pairing
relegates Gery Groslimond and
Rick Fisher to second doubles.
The Fisher-Groslimond team, one
of the best in the nation, should
win both its matches this
weekend.
At third doubles, Chip Fisher
and Whitlinger will have to prove
their abilities, as the pair has lost
two straight matches.
USC Slightly Better
USC, Saturday's opponent, is
probably slightly ahead of UCLA
right now, as the Trojans downed
the Bruins 6-3 at UCLA last
weekend.
Tuesday, San Diego's team was
crowded into Gould's office,
waiting for the final match to be
completed. One of the San Diego
players glanced at a newspaper
clipping hanging on the wall and
said "Look Coach, they beat USC
9-0 last year."
The San Diego coach replied in
a wise-sounding Scandinavian
accent, 'That was last year. USC's
a lot better now."
Winning this year won't be
easy.

NCAA CHAMP?—AIex "Sandy" Mayer, Stanford's top player, is
considered a favorite for the NCAA singles championship this June.
His main competition will come from UCLA's Jeff Austin and USC's
Raul Ramirez, both of whom Mayer will play here this weekend.

DUPES—Freshman Pat DuPre will play fourth singles for the Cardinals
this weekend against USC and UCLA, two positions higher than he
played two weeks ago. The Belgian-born star has been the hottest
player on the Stanford team recently, and has a 10-1 record this year,
best on the team.
