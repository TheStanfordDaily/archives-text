# Lacrosse Team Returns Home
## 
### MARK WHITE 
After splitting two away games last weekend,
Stanford's lacrosse team returns to its home field
tomorrow to face the Oakland Lacrosse Club on the
rugby field behind Maples Pavilion at 1 p.m. The
Cards then follow with a non-league contest against
Oregon Sunday, also at 1 p.m.
We feel we are in the situation now where we
must win our next four games to have any kind of
chance in our league," coach Peter Schneider
explained," and I think we'll win this weekend if we
can continue to hustle like we did last weekend."
Although the Cards lost to UCLA Saturday 7-6,
Schneider felt it was one of the teams' best
performances. Butch Hazlett, who leads the Cards in
scoring with 26 goals, scored three goals before
being kicked out in the fourth quarter on one of
several questionable calls by the referee.
"I must say it was the strangest job of officiating
I have ever seen," said Schneider. "The fact that

after taking away four goals from us the ref
admitted that he was mistaken leaves no doubt in
my mind that there was something a little weird
about that game. The situation became a little
clearer when we found out the next day that the ref
was the goalie for Temple City's team, the team we
played Sunday."
Needless to say, the Cards were excited about
Sunday's game and gained a small measure of
revenge on the goalie/ref by trouncing Temple City
11-3. Dave "Sugar Bear" Ruiz broke into the
scoring column for the first time. Four goals by
Hazlett and two each for Buz Haddow and Shell
Gordon rounded out the Cardinal scoring.
"If our defense can play as well as it did last
week, we should be able to shut off Oakland's two
all-star attackmen," explained Schneider. "Once
again it should be a physical contest, but if we can
continue to maintain the old Stanford swarm, like a
bunch of hungry bees, we should come out on top."
