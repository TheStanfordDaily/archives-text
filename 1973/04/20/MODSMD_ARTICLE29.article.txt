# Track Action Resumes As Girds Meet Talented Trojans
## 
### PHIL HUBBARD 
The track squad returns to
action tomorrow against USC
following the 101-50 loss to
UCLA two weeks ago. The meet
will be held at Edwards Stadium
in Berkeley and will also feature
competition between California
and UCLA.
Stanford comes into the meet
with a 2-2 record in dual
competition, while USC is 1-0.
The teams both competed at the
Santa Barbara Relays earlier this
year, the Trojanc taking second
and the Cards third.
USC has been one of the
leading track powers in the
country for the past couple of
decades. The last time the Cards
beat the Trojans in dual
competition was 1933 and this
year promises more of the same.
Although USC is not quite as
strong as the last few years, its
team has won two major relay
events and placed sixth in the
NCAA indoor championships so
far this season.
Tomorrow's meet gets

underway at 1:15 p.m. with the
field events. The long jump will
have Tom Anderson and Kenny
Kring fighting for second and
third with USC's Ed Washington
and Tom Cocheq. Randy Williams,
the gold medalist at Munich last
year, is more than two feet ahead
of the rest of the field and should
have little trouble taking first.
The pole vault will have Kring,
who has jumped 14'6" so far this
year, facing Bob Pullard (16'6")
and Jon Kwan (15'0").
Albritton Competes
The shot put will see Stanford
record holder Terry Albritton
facing Mike Budincich. SC's Bruce
Dow should dominate the javelin,
with Steve Hopkins and Rick
Larson throwing for the Cards.
The Cards' foursome in the
discus, Jim Howard, Pete
Dreissigacker, Jim Royer, and
Albritton, have all thrown farther
than Budincich, the Trojan's top
discus man, so there is a good
chance of a Stanford sweep here.
In the triple jump, Rod Utley
will be head to head with
Washington and Cochee. All three

jump in the vicinity of 50 feet.
The high jump features USC's two
seven-foot leapers, Dean Owens
and Jerry Culp, against Tom
Anderson and Bob Laney.
The running events begin at
1:45 p.m. with the 440 relay.
Stanford's team of Ken Curl, John
Kessel, Matt Hogsett, and John
Anderson have run 41.5, while
USC's group has run 39.8.
In the 100 and 220, Curl will
represent the Cards. His chief
opponent in both races will be
Don Quarrie, an Olympian from
Jamaica. Both have lifetime bests
of 9.3 in the 100, but Quarrie has
a 20.4 to his credit in the 220 to
Curl's 21.1.
Sensational Frosh
The 440 will feature USC's
sensational freshman Ken Randle,
who has run 46.4 this year. Facing
Randle and his teammates will be
John Anderson, John Kessel, and
Bruce Henry, who ran a lifetime
best of 48.5 in the JV meet
Wednesday.
Brian Mittelstaedt and Vernell
Jackson are Stanford's hopes in
the 880 against James Baxter and
Nathan Burks. The mile should be
dominated by Mittelstaedt and
Les McFadden. McFadden has run
4:05.7 this year, and Mittelstaedt
ran a liftime best of 4:04.0 in the
Trojan Invitational last Saturday.
Mittelstaedt is also scheduled
to run the two mile, along with
Tony Sandoval and Mark
McConnell. In the 3,000 meter
steeplechase, Kurt Schoenrock
will be trying to crack 9:10. He
has already brought his iime down
to 9:13.4 this year.
In the high hurdles, Dave
Bagshaw will be fighting for a
place behind USC's trio of Jerry
Wilson, Ed Washington, and Bob
Coffman, all of whom have run
under Bagshaw's best time of
14.2. The intermediate hurdles
will have Coffman facing
Bagshaw, Hogsett and Kring.
The final event, the mile relay,
could be won by the Cards only if
a major disaster hits the Trojans.
USC has run 3:07.1 to Stanford's
3:16.4.
