# Skinny Southpaw Boasts 0.73 ERA
## Opposing Hitters Dazzled By DiPietro 
### SCOTT DAILEY 
"If you're doing a profile of
Bob DiPietro, get it from the
front, because if you get it from
the side, he'll disappear."
Baseball coach Ray Young's
photographic analysis of a news
profile of Stanford's star junior
lefty seems appropriate. DiPietro
is 6-1 and weighs 180 pounds, but
it looks like the last 20 pounds
got lost somewhere.
"Look at him," laughed Ken
Grolle as DiPietro sat in front of
his locker after the Cards' 5-2 win
over San Jose State Wednesday.
"Does this guy look like he should
be pitching? He looks like he
should be in a library."
DiPietro could easily pass for a
bookworm. His wire-rimmed
glasses and the calm, calculating
expression on his face give him
the look of the lawyer that he
hopes someday to be.
But first, he wants to play pro
baseball.

Pitching coach Tom Dunton
believes he can. "I think he has
excellent potential," asserted
Dunton Wednesday. If he keeps
pitching the way he does, he may
sign, and I certainly wouldn't
keep him from it."
The way DiPietro has been
pitching of late has been
impressive. He fanned 13 batters
and held USC to three hits in the
first game of last Saturday's
doubleheader, fashioning a 1-0,
nine-inning shut-out in a game
that was scheduled to last only
seven innings. His ERA stands at

0.73. He has struck out 40 batters
and has yielded only four earned
runs in 49-1/3 innings.
"The only question is his
velocity," Dunton said. "He
doesn't really have a fastball that
he can blow past somebody. In
pro ball, if you're going to rely on
a fastball to get people out, you
have to have a fastball that's
really quick. DiPietro has a good
live fastball, and it's certainly
adequate."
DiPietro doesn't really rely on

his fastball, though. It is his
smooth curve, his change of pace,
and his ability to anticipate the
batter's expectations that enable
him to pitch effectively.
'Knows How'
"He really knows how to
pitch," said Dunton. It's a big
advantage because we don't have
to teach him as much."
Dunton estimates the Pac-8 is
equivalent to AA minor league
baseball, and believes DiPietro's
pitching knowledge will insure
only a short stay in the minors.
"He's very coachable and has
great poise. If he pitches the way
he did Saturday, he can give
anyone trouble. He did a great job
of off-speed pitching—he had
great control of his change of
pace. He threw every pitch almost
exactly where he had to."
Against SC, DiPietro used his
curve and his changeup
magnificently. Trojan batters were
stirring up heavy winds at the
plate, swinging around DiPietro's
deliveries, which dipped and
curved out of their reach all
afternoon.
Had Fun Against SC
"I just had a feeling we were
going to win," DiPietro said. "I've
never concetrated as hard on the
batters as I did in that game. I had
more fun pitching that game than
I have in a long time. I was
concentrating, but I wasn't really
nervous.
"It puts more pressure on you
when you're not getting any runs,
especially when you're playing a
team that can beat you with one
swing of the bat. Every time
Putman came up, I was scared,
but I thought if I can get him out,
then Bob Adolph's up next, and I
can get him.

"Then Adolph would get up,
and I'd think there's a guy who
can beat you with one swing of
thebat.'so you have to concentrate
on him, too."
One thing that DiPietro has
been concentrating on is his
decision about pro baseball.
"I want to play pro ball this
summer if I can, but my last year
of school is paid for if I don't
sign."
Finish Education
Even if he does sign, DiPietro
said that he will definitely finish
his education.
He and Dunton are not
disclosing prospective financial
figures, but DiPietro will probably
hold out until the pros offer an
attractive bonus. "I'm not going
to be hard to get, but I want to
make it right."
"I'm his agent," hollered
backup catcher Ed Orizzi from
across the locker room. "All he
wants is a farm in Mexico."
Said Dunton, "If everything's
right, then he'll probably sign.
We'd hate to lose him, but in all
honesty, you have to do what's
best for the player. We've been
talking about it, and I certainly
wouldn't begrudge him if
the money's right.
"It helps us too—it helps
recruiting. We've been fortunate
to have him for three years."

magnificently. Trojan batters were
stirring up heavy winds at the
plate, swinging around DiPietro's
deliveries, which dipped and
curved out of their reach all
afternoon.
Had Fun Against SC
"I just had a feeling we were
going to win," DiPietro said. "I've
never concetrated as hard on the
batters as I did in that game. I had
more fun pitching that game than
I have in a long time. I was
concentrating, but I wasn't really
nervous.
"It puts more pressure on you
when you're not getting any runs,
especially when you're playing a
team that can beat you with one
swing of the bat. Every time
Putman came up, I was scared,
but I thought if I can get him out,
then Bob Adolph's up next, and I
can get him.

"Then Adolph would get up,
and I'd think there's a guy who
can beat you with one swing of
thebat.'so you have to concentrate
on him, too."
One thing that DiPietro has
been concentrating on is his
decision about pro baseball.
"I want to play pro ball this
summer if I can, but my last year
of school is paid for if I don't
sign."
Finish Education
Even if he does sign, DiPietro
said that he will definitely finish
his education.
He and Dunton are not
disclosing prospective financial
figures, but DiPietro will probably
hold out until the pros offer an
attractive bonus. "I'm not going
to be hard to get, but I want to
make it right."
"I'm his agent," hollered
backup catcher Ed Orizzi from
across the locker room. "All he
wants is a farm in Mexico."
Said Dunton, "If everything's
right, then he'll probably sign.
We'd hate to lose him, but in all
honesty, you have to do what's
best for the player. We've been
talking about it, and I certainly
wouldn't begrudge him if
the money's right.
"It helps us too—it helps
recruiting. We've been fortunate
to have him for three years."

ROWING THE BOAT—Stanford's crew team, shown here racing

LANKY LEFTY- Junior southpaw Bob DiPietro leads the Cardinal
pitching staff with a microscopic earned run average of 0.73. DiPietro,
who also sports a 4-1 record and has struck out 40 batters in 49
innings, will pitch against California in the first game of tomorrow's
doubleheader in Berkeley.
"If you're doing a profile of
Bob DiPietro, get it from the
front, because if you get it from
the side, he'll disappear."
Baseball coach Ray Young's
photographic analysis of a news
profile of Stanford's star junior
lefty seems appropriate. DiPietro
is 6-1 and weighs 180 pounds, but
it looks like the last 20 pounds
got lost somewhere.
"Look at him," laughed Ken
Grolle as DiPietro sat in front of
his locker after the Cards' 5-2 win
over San Jose State Wednesday.
"Does this guy look like he should
be pitching? He looks like he
should be in a library."
DiPietro could easily pass for a
bookworm. His wire-rimmed
glasses and the calm, calculating
expression on his face give him
the look of the lawyer that he
hopes someday to be.
But first, he wants to play pro
baseball.

Pitching coach Tom Dunton
believes he can. "I think he has
excellent potential," asserted
Dunton Wednesday. If he keeps
pitching the way he does, he may
sign, and I certainly wouldn't
keep him from it."
The way DiPietro has been
pitching of late has been
impressive. He fanned 13 batters
and held USC to three hits in the
first game of last Saturday's
doubleheader, fashioning a 1-0,
nine-inning shut-out in a game
that was scheduled to last only
seven innings. His ERA stands at

0.73. He has struck out 40 batters
and has yielded only four earned
runs in 49-1/3 innings.
"The only question is his
velocity," Dunton said. "He
doesn't really have a fastball that
he can blow past somebody. In
pro ball, if you're going to rely on
a fastball to get people out, you
have to have a fastball that's
really quick. DiPietro has a good
live fastball, and it's certainly
adequate."
DiPietro doesn't really rely on

his fastball, though. It is his
smooth curve, his change of pace,
and his ability to anticipate the
batter's expectations that enable
him to pitch effectively.
'Knows How'
"He really knows how to
pitch," said Dunton. It's a big
advantage because we don't have
to teach him as much."
Dunton estimates the Pac-8 is
equivalent to AA minor league
baseball, and believes DiPietro's
pitching knowledge will insure
only a short stay in the minors.
"He's very coachable and has
great poise. If he pitches the way
he did Saturday, he can give
anyone trouble. He did a great job
of off-speed pitching—he had
great control of his change of
pace. He threw every pitch almost
exactly where he had to."
Against SC, DiPietro used his
curve and his changeup
magnificently. Trojan batters were
stirring up heavy winds at the
plate, swinging around DiPietro's
deliveries, which dipped and
curved out of their reach all

photographic analysis of a news
profile of Stanford's star junior
lefty seems appropriate. DiPietro
is 6-1 and weighs 180 pounds, but
it looks like the last 20 pounds
got lost somewhere.
"Look at him," laughed Ken
Grolle as DiPietro sat in front of
his locker after the Cards' 5-2 win
over San Jose State Wednesday.
"Does this guy look like he should
be pitching? He looks like he
should be in a library."
DiPietro could easily pass for a
bookworm. His wire-rimmed
glasses and the calm, calculating
expression on his face give him
the look of the lawyer that he
hopes someday to be.
But first, he wants to play pro
baseball.

Pitching coach Tom Dunton
believes he can. "I think he has
excellent potential," asserted
Dunton Wednesday. If he keeps
pitching the way he does, he may
sign, and I certainly wouldn't
keep him from it."
The way DiPietro has been
pitching of late has been
impressive. He fanned 13 batters
and held USC to three hits in the
first game of last Saturday's
doubleheader, fashioning a 1-0,
nine-inning shut-out in a game
that was scheduled to last only
seven innings. His ERA stands at

0.73. He has struck out 40 batters
and has yielded only four earned
runs in 49-1/3 innings.
"The only question is his
velocity," Dunton said. "He
doesn't really have a fastball that
he can blow past somebody. In
pro ball, if you're going to rely on
a fastball to get people out, you
have to have a fastball that's
really quick. DiPietro has a good
live fastball, and it's certainly
adequate."
DiPietro doesn't really rely on

his fastball, though. It is his
smooth curve, his change of pace,
and his ability to anticipate the
batter's expectations that enable
him to pitch effectively.
'Knows How'
"He really knows how to
pitch," said Dunton. It's a big
advantage because we don't have
to teach him as much."
Dunton estimates the Pac-8 is
equivalent to AA minor league
baseball, and believes DiPietro's
pitching knowledge will insure
only a short stay in the minors.
"He's very coachable and has
great poise. If he pitches the way
he did Saturday, he can give
anyone trouble. He did a great job
of off-speed pitching—he had
great control of his change of
pace. He threw every pitch almost
exactly where he had to."
Against SC, DiPietro used his
curve and his changeup
magnificently. Trojan batters were
stirring up heavy winds at the
plate, swinging around DiPietro's
deliveries, which dipped and
curved out of their reach all
afternoon.
Had Fun Against SC
"I just had a feeling we were
going to win," DiPietro said. "I've
never concetrated as hard on the
batters as I did in that game. I had
more fun pitching that game than
I have in a long time. I was
concentrating, but I wasn't really
nervous.
"It puts more pressure on you
when you're not getting any runs,
especially when you're playing a
team that can beat you with one
swing of the bat. Every time
Putman came up, I was scared,
but I thought if I can get him out,
then Bob Adolph's up next, and I
can get him.

"Then Adolph would get up,
and I'd think there's a guy who
can beat you with one swing of
thebat.'so you have to concentrate
on him, too."
One thing that DiPietro has
been concentrating on is his
decision about pro baseball.
"I want to play pro ball this
summer if I can, but my last year
of school is paid for if I don't
sign."
Finish Education
Even if he does sign, DiPietro
said that he will definitely finish
his education.
He and Dunton are not
disclosing prospective financial
figures, but DiPietro will probably
hold out until the pros offer an
attractive bonus. "I'm not going
to be hard to get, but I want to
make it right."
"I'm his agent," hollered
backup catcher Ed Orizzi from
across the locker room. "All he
wants is a farm in Mexico."
Said Dunton, "If everything's
right, then he'll probably sign.
We'd hate to lose him, but in all
honesty, you have to do what's
best for the player. We've been
talking about it, and I certainly
wouldn't begrudge him if
the money's right.
"It helps us too—it helps
recruiting. We've been fortunate
to have him for three years."
