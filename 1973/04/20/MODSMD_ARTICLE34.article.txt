# Cards Meet Bears
## 
### 
Baseball coach Ray Young hopes to finally hear something
from his team's silent bats this weekend as the Cards meet
California in a three game Pacific Eight series. A single game is
scheduled for today at 2:30 at Sunken Diamond with a noon
doubleheader set for tomorrow in Berkeley.
After scoring only two runs in three games last weekend
against USC, Stanford's team batting average dropped to a meager
.165 in Pac-8 play, a full 156 percentage points behind league
leader Oregon. Those figures make one wonder what Stanford's
record would be if it weren't for a pitching staff that has a
combined earned run average of 1.62 in the league and 2.44
overall.
This afternoon pitching coach Tom Dunton will send Dan
Shaw (5-3, 2.24) to the mound against the Bears, with Bob
DiPietro (4-1, 0.73) and Ken Grolle (3-3, 2.08) scheduled to pitch
in tomorrow's doubleheader.
Wednesday the Cards improved their record to 24-12
(Stanford is 2-4 in the league) with a 5-2 victory over San Jose
State at Sunken Diamond. A 1 Arthur allowed only two
baserunners in his seven innings of work as he improved his
record to 5-1. A 1 O'Brien had three hits for the Cards, Bob
Hampton had two hits and three RBl's, and Mark Lucich added
tow hits.
California is currently 1-5 in the league and 14-19 overall. The
Bears' top hitter is football quarterback Steve Bartkowski, who
leades the team with a .350 batting average and five home runs.
