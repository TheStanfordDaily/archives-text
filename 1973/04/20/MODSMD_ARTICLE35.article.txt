## Cardinal Crew 
### Mike Chasson 
The Stanford Crew Association travels to Eugene this weekend to
face Oregon, Oregon State, University of British Columbia, and Pacific
Lutheran College.
The race appears to be competitive with Stanford, Oregon State
and British Columbia battling it out for first place. The Cards earlier
loss to Oregon State was marked by the fact the Beavers were rowing
six strokes per minute higher than the Cards.
If the Beavers were rowing efficiently at that rate they would have
defeated Stanford by a much larger margin than one length. Stanford
hopes to row at a higher rate this weekend, with no loss of power in
the boat, enabling them to gain revenge against the Beavers.
One of the most exciting races of the day should be in the
lightweight division. The Cards have been defeated only once this
season, last weekend to Santa Clara, but they had defeated the
Broncos earleir in the season.
Oregon State's lightweights are rated close to defending West Coast
champion UCLA. If the Cards can defeat the Beavers or finish close to
them they will have a good chance for victory at the Western Sprints,
the meet which determines the champions of West Coast crew.
The West Coast crew picture finds Washington once again at the
top in every division, with the possible exception of the lightweights.
The Huskies run a well-financed program with excellent facilities.
They house all their team together at the boat house and offer
scholarships to promising freshmen.
The crew program in Washington finds a tremendous amount of
support from the residents in the Seattle area. An estimated 50,000
people showed up to see UCLA defeat Washington for the first time
ever on their home course three years ago.
In the past UCLA has been the Huskies'primary challenger, but the
last two years the Bruins have been weak except in the lightweight
division. UCLA has one of the finest facilities on the Coast for their
shells and a large budget from the athletic department allows for
scholarships and travel.
This is all in contrast to Stanford's club sport program which is
barely supported by the athletic department and must rely on a few
alumni and current squad members to keep the team going. The
coach, Len Sherr, is paid no money for his services as is the freshman
coach, Doug Blayney.
One example of the crew's problems occured two weeks ago when
Sherr attempted to go out to run the varsity workout in the team's
power launch. The shells had already headed out for their warmup
when Sherr attempted to catch up. Halfway to the shells the motor
froze solid and the launch skidded to a stop.
Sherr was then forced to call to Blayney to tow him in to the dock,
where he then had to borrow the freshman launch. This launch had
two inches of water in the bottom from a leak and operated with a
motor that would slip into neutral at any time. Sherr ended up
watching approximately five minutes of his squad's workout.
An incident such as this can only point out the severe handicaps
the Stanford crew must operate under in its quest to achieve success
in West Coast racing. Sherr believes because the team operated under
such adversity, the Cardinal rowers are more dedicated since they are
rowing only for themselves
The other coaches on the Coast in most cases talk with respect for
the Stanford oarsmen because they know the handicaps Stanford must
operate under to achieve success. They understand that for an athlete
to get up every morning for a 6 a.m. workout that is over 20 minutes
away from campus, he has to be dedicated.
