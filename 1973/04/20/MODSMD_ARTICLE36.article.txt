### DAVE ROBINSON 
SANTA CRUZ - After 36 holes
in the 54-hole Western
Intercollegiate Golf Tournament,
it looks like the only real winner
will be the Pasatiempo Golf
Course.
A total of 156 golfers from 26
teams have tested the challenging
layout the past few days, and only
one player has managed to better
Pasatiempo's elusive par 71.
Bob Harris is Pasatiempo's lone
conquerer, firing a 70 yesterday as
his Brigham Young team took the
36-hole lead with a 594 total, four
strokes ahead of USC and five
ahead of third place Long Beach
State.
Stanford is well off the pace
going into today's final round.
The Cards have a 617 total, partly
because of a barrage of double
and triple-bogeys during
yesterday's second round.
Aly Trompas suffered a
triple-bogey eight on the sixth
hole, Conrad Nilmeyer had a
triple-bogey at the same hole, and
Dave Baskins finished with a
triple-bogey on 17 and a
double-bogey on 18 after playing
the first 16 holes in only three
over par.
Big holes were also costly for
the Cards during Wednesday's first
round. Trompas hit two tee shots
out-of-bounds as he shot a
disasterous 82. Yesterday, the
sophomore came back with a 74
despite the triple-bogey on six.
Harris, Don Baker of USC,
Arizona State's Tom Purtzer, and
Beau Baugh and Mike Krantz of
Long Beach State are tied for the
individual lead, all with three-over
par 145 totals. Only 11 players
are under 150 for the first 36
holes.
"The last time I can remember
scores being this high was around
1956 when John Brodie was

playing," said Stanford Coach
Bud Finger, "and that year it
rained all three days."
This year rain hasn't been a
factor, but gusty winds have
bothered the golfers considerably,
especially the late afternoon
starters.
Stanford scores reflect both
the wind and a series of mental
lapses by all six Card golfers, with
the possible exception of Denny
Colvin. Colvin is the only
Stanford golfer in the top 20,

after shooting rounds of 76 and
75 for a 151 total.
The other Cardinal scores are:
Conrad Nilmeier (78-77, 155);
Dave Baskins (76-79, 155);
Trompas (82-74, 156); Bob
Chapman (78-83, 161); and
George Pettinger (79-87, 166).
Today's final round promises
an exciting team battle between
BYU, USC and Long Beach State,
with fourth place Fresno State
and fifth-place Arizona State also
possible challengers.
