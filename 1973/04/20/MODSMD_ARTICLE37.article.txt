Kerner Sentenced
CHICAGO — Federal Appellate Court Judge Otto
Kerner was sentenced yesterday to three years in
prison and fined $50,000 for taking bribes while he
was governor of Illinois.
A federal judge sentenced Kerner to three years
on each of 12 counts and ordered that they be
served concurrently.
Kerner was the first active federal appeals judge
to be convicted and sentenc r d for a crime.
Theodore J. Isaacs, a long-time associate, also was
sentenced to three years in prison and fined
$50,000.
The two were convicted Feb. 19 in U.S. District
Court of conspiracy, bribery, fraud and income tax
evasion. Kerner also was convicted of perjury.
Judge Robert L. Taylor told Kerner before
sentencing: "In 23 years on the bench, this is the
most difficult trial I have ever had. Now comes the
most difficult part."
Kerner, 64, a two-term governor of Illinois, said:
"I have said all I can say. I do not envy your
position."
The judge ruled that Kerner could be granted
parole at any time during his term. He and Isaacs
were allowed to remain free on recognizance bond
pending appeal.
Low Job Placement For Poor
WASHINGTON — The government has found
private jobs for only eight percent of the more than
one million welfare recipients required by a new law
to register for work, according to unpublished
figures.
Federal officials say the program has not been
more successful because of high unemployment,
federal budget-cutting and lack of skills or
ineligibility of those registered.
Of the 82,075 persons placed in these jobs
between July 1, 1972, and Mar. 31, 1973, the
Department of Health, Education and Welfare
estimates that 60 percent eventually will be
removed from welfare rolls and that many of the
others will have benefits reduced.
The Senate sponsor of the workfare law, the only
major portion of President Nixon's ill-fated welfare
reform program to be passed by Congress last year,
has said stiff enforcement could clean up more of
what he called the "welfare mess."
HEW and Labor Dept. figures show that
1,023,083 persons were registered for work or
training during the last nine months. Under
provisions of the Talmadge amendment to the
six-year-old Work Incentive (WIN) program, they
must register or lose their relief checks.
Roughly one out of four, or 256,678 were
certified able-bodied and 146,359 were placed in
the government-funded job training or
"employment orientation" positions, HEW said.
The private jobs, not subsidized by the
government, were found for 82,075, and no
openings in either category were found for more
than 18,000.
Fitzsimmons Attacks Rival
WASHINGTON — Teamsters President Frank E.
Fitzsimmons yesterday dismissed the AFL-ClO's
union-busting charges in the California farm workers
dispute as "show-boating and name-calling," and

said he would welcome a congressional
investigation.
"Farm workers are turning to us in greater and
greater numbers," Fitzsimmons said, "because the
Teamsters are strong and have the reputation for
getting the job done."
His statement was in answer to charges
Wednesday by AFL-CIO President George Meany
that the Teamsters, in secret collusion with
California grape growers, are trying to crush the
rival AFL-CIO affiliated United Farm Workers
Union.
The UFW, headed by Cesar Chavez, called for a
strike and nationwide boycott of California table
grapes this week after the Teamsters signed
contracts w'th nearly all of the growers in the
Coachella Valley. They had been under contract to
the UFW but these pacts expired last weekend.
Meany accused the Teamsters of "vicious,
union-busting" tactics in their battle with the UFW
for representation of California farm workers. He
pledged the AFL-ClO's backing to the UFW.
In reply, Fitzsimmons said if Meany "really has
the interests of farm workers at heart" he would
join the Teamsters in urging coverage of farm
workers under the National Labor Relations Act.
This way, the Teamsters leader said, they could
vote in secret, government-supervised elections for
the union of their choice. But Fitzsimmons said
Chavez opposes this.
"On the question of union-busting, I know for a
fact that as a result of Teamster activity, more farm
workers are enjoying benefits of a union contract
than ever before in history, and are enjoying wages,
hours and conditions undreamed of five years ago,"
Fitzsimmons said.
"If that be union-busting, then George Meany
and I have different definitions of the phrase."
Study Shows Economy Booming
WASHINGTON — Spurred by soaring inflation, the
country's economy expanded at a near-record level
in the first quarter of 1973, the government
reported yesterday.
Economists warned that there are signs the
economy is overheating and will have to be slowed
down.
The Commerce Department released its quarterly
report on the Gross National Product, which
showed that the value of the country's output of
goods and services increased a record $40 billion
from January through March to an annual growth
rate of 14.3 percent. Inflation increased at an
annual rate of six percent.
The GNP is increasing at a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of $1,235 trillion, the report said,
compared to $1,164 trillion at the end of 1972.
Consumers were both buying more and paying
more, the figures showed, and a top government
economist said the United States was experiencing
inflation under conditions of strong demand.
The economist, chairman Herbert Stein of the
President's Council of Economic Advisers, called the
first-quarter inflation rate extraordinary.
Inflation, accounting for six percent of the
increase in GNP, scored the biggest quarterly jump
since a 6.3 percent inflation in the fourth quarter of
1970. It was more than double the rate of 2.8

percent in the fourth quarter of 1972. The rate of
inflation for all of last year was three percent.
If the six percent inflation is maintained
throughout the year, it would mean that consumers
would be paying $1.06 at the end of the year for
each dollar of purchases at the beginning of the
year.
Mine-Sweeping Halt Charged
WASHINGTON — The United States has stopped
observing two key provisions of the Vietnam
cease-fire agreement, saying North Vietnam has
failed to live up to all parts of the settlement.
In separate announcements yesterday, the
Pentagon and the State Department said
mine-clearing operations by the U.S. Navy in North
Vietnamese waters has been halted and the chief
American delegate to a joint U.S.-North Vietnamese
economic commission had been called home from
Paris.
By pulling Maurice Williams out of the Paris talks
on an American economic aid program, the United
States has halted its effort at carrying out Article 21
of the Jan. 27 cease-fire agreement.
That provision pledges that "the United States
will contribute to healing the wounds of war and to
postwar reconstruction of the Democratic Republic
of Vietnam."
By suspending the mine-sweeping operations, the
United States is no longer complying with Article
Two of the Paris agreement, which states:
"The United States will remove, permanently
deactivate or destroy all the mines in the territorial
waters, ports, harbors and waterways of North
Vietnam as soon as this agreement goes into effect."
U.S. officials acknowledge these are violations,
but they charge the North Vietnamese and their
allies started the trouble by choosing those
provisions of the settlement they would observe.
Government officials would not say the
American actions, or even the alleged continuous
violations by Hanoi, indicated the peace agreement
was in imminent jeopardy.
"The two actions yesterday are similar to the
bombing of Laos this week," one source said.
"They are efforts to convince the Communists
we mean business, not that we have given up on the
agreement."
This official expressed the hope that Hanoi will
realize it has tested President Nixon's will to its
limit and will begin full observance.
State Department spokesman Charles W. Bray
said that whether the agreement can be saved "is
entirely a function of the actions of the other side."
If Hanoi and its allies in the rest of Indochina
continue violations, the United States will continue
retaliation," he indicated.
North Vietnam reacted angrily to the halt of the
mine-sweeping. It was Hanoi who yesterday
disclosed the suspension had begun Tuesday. The
Pentagon confirmed this later in the day.
Today's Weather
Mostly fair through tomorrow. High temperature
today and tomorrow in the 60s to low 70s. Low
both nights in the 40s.
