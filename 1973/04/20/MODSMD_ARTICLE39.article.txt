# PA Council Contest Intensifies

(Continued from front page)
Coalition candidates — Jeffrey
Youdelman — angrily disrupted a
January Council meeting.
The ABC candidates appear very
uncomfortable when forced to discuss
Council disruptions. It is a hot potato
in that no matter what they say,
someone objects — vigorously.
Mayor Kirke Comstock, seeking
re-election to the council on the ABC
ticket, has steered the Council through
a number of stormy sessions with
enforcement of a time limit on
speakers, reading of the anti-disruption
statute at each meeting, stern warnings
to those speaking without recognition,
and on rare occasions recesses while
the disorder subsided.
Incumbents
Incumbency is no guarantee of
victory. An "establishment"

incumbent was beaten two years ago,
and in the stormy 1967 election four
"residentialist" incumbents were
turned out of office.
One of those four, Stanford Law
Prof. Byron Sher, is attempting a
comeback this year.
Five incumbents will be on the
ballot May 8 — two carrying the ABC
banner and three under PA '73's flag.
The strength of the two factions in
the city is nearly equal.
Who will win on May 8? It's too
early to tell. Among the possible
outcomes is one in which the
Community Coalition draws enough of
the left-of-center vote to enable PA
'73 to capture four or five seats with
less than half the ballots.
That would indicate for certain the
end of two-"party" politics in the City
of Trees.
