# New Chem Building Planned
## 
### 
Syntex (U.S.A.) Inc. has pledged $1
million toward construction of the
University's new chemistry building,
Stanford spokesmen announced
yesterday.
Syntex made the pledge on
condition that approximately $5
million in additional funds needed to
complete the building can be raised by
1975.
The pledge is part of the five-year,
$300 million Campaign for Stanford.
The announcement of the Syntex gift
came two days after President Richard
Lyman revealed plans for a $9.2
million dollar engineering center on
campus.
Syntex Corporation Board
President and Board Chairman Dr.

George Rosenkranz said: "Our
relationship with the University has
focused our attention on the
importance of Stanford being able to
maintain and enhance its commitment
to continuing excellence in the manv
academic disciplines for which it has
received international recognition and
acclaim."
Syntex built its first U.S. research
laboratory — the Syntex Institute of
Molecular Biology — in the Stanford
Industrial Park in the early 1960s and
has maintained close links with the
University ever since.
The Institute's first director was Dr.
Carl Djerassi, now a professor of
chemistry here.

In acknowledging the pledge,
Lyman said: "We are delighted to have
this generous incentive and hope that
Stanford's friends will rise, as they
always have in the past, to the
challenge. The new building for
chemistry is certainly one of our most
urgent Campaign needs."
The new building will replace the
present chemistry building, built in
1900 and today totally inadequate for
the numbers of students using it and
the kinds of modern laboratory
research in which they are involved.
