# PA City Council Race Reflects Old Divisions, Some New Issues
## 
### ROBERT BACON News Analysis 
Something old, something new — at
times the Palo Alto City Council
campaign resembles those of past
years, but some differences are also
readily apparent.
The city's voters will choose six
Council members from a field of 18
candidates on May 8.
Six of the candidates form the
"residentialist" Association for a
Balanced Community (ABC) slate; six
make up the "establishment" Palo
Alto '73 ticket; four are running under
the banner of the leftist Palo Alto
Community Coalition; and two are
conducting independent campaigns.
Every city council election for a
decade has been fought between the
"residentialists" — who prefer to see
the city remain predominantly
residential and tend to object to new
commercial and industrial
development — and the
"establishment," more favorably
inclined to business and industry.
The current candidates show this
philosophical heritage, although the
words "residentialist" and

"establishment" haven't been heard
this year.
Open Space
The ABC candidates advertise their
commitment to open space and their
battles against past development
proposals. PA '73 hopefuls pay more
attention to the revitalization of
downtown.
In general, the ABC candidates
point to their membership in
conservation and human relations
organizations; the PA '73 candidates
tend to stress their experience in
business and in organizations such as
the United Fund and the PTA.
But there are other issues this year.
More important to many voters than
open space and business development
are child care, low-income housing,
and drug abuse control. Other voters
insist that the candidates discuss
disruptions of city council meetings,
crime, and communal living by
unrelated persons.
Radical Slate
This election mtorks the first
appearance of I slate of radical council
candidates In Palo Alto. Two years
ago, a sintfe radical carried the

Venceremos standard in the Council
contest.
The radicals claim — with a
substantial degree of truth — to have
been responsible for bringing to the
attention of the present Council
members many of the issues which
have dominated the last two years in
the city — child care . facilities,
low-income housing, landlord-tenant
relations.
They criticize ABC's emphasis on
parks, bicycle paths, and conservation.
"Necessities before niceties," the
Community Coalition says. It claims
to speak for the until-recently-silent
minority of Palo Altans who are poor,
non-white, or young, in a city that is
predominantly white and middle-class.
But they are the only one of the
three slates to have no non-white
candidate, and their slate has one
woman while the others each have
two.
It could also be said that the
radicals are responsible for disruptions
of Council meetings being an issue.
Not lost on those who raise this issue
is the fact that one of the Community
