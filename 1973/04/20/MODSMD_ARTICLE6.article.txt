# New School Board Faces Hayman Issue
## 
### JAMES LOBSENZ 
Warren Hayman, resident fellow of
Roble Hall, faces continued
controversy in his bid to be named
permanent superintendent of the
Ravenswood Elementary School
District in East Palo Alto.
Last Tuesday's elections brought to
the school board three members who
favor appointing Hayman, now serving
as acting superintendent.
The incumbent school board,
however, has already hired John
Cleveland, the director of urban
education at San Diego State
University, to fill the position.
Cleveland is scheduled to take office in
July.
Barbara Hatton, Mavis Knox, and
the Rev. James Daniels were easy
winners in the seven-candidate field
Tuesday. The three incumbents whose
terms expire this year — all of whom
had voted to hire Cleveland — did not
seek re-election.
Although Hayman hesitates to
admit that his retention was a major
issue in the campaign, Daniels
disagrees. "Hayman may be very
modest," states Daniels, "but he was
an issue in this campaign, and the
voter turnout would have been much
smaller without this issue."
Mandate
Hatton maintains that the election
results show a mandate for keeping
Hayman. "The people have spoken
and there is no misinterpretation this
time."

What will happen now is up to
Cleveland, maintains Hatton. "If he
wishes not to hear what the
community says, he can take that
choice. I hope he hears."
The newly elected slate cannot
reverse the decision to hire Cleveland,
who has already reportedly signed a
$30,000 a year, four-year contract
with the district.
But the members of the new board
clearly hope that Cleveland will change
his mind and refuse to accept the job,
in light of the election results.
Hay man, who succeeded
Superintendent John Minor last
October, was the first choice of the
screening committee that reviewed the
merits of 80 candidates for the
permanent job. Cleveland was the
fourth choice.
Daniels considers the old board's
decision to hire Cleveland instead of
Hayman "a slap in the face of the
community."
New Program
Hayman is credited with the
initiation of the Community Family
Guided Education program. According
to Daniels, the program embodies the
concept that "everyone in the
community should be involved in
education. We all work together now,
like brothers and sisters, forgetting
about big salaries. We just want to do a
job."
Daniels also praises Hayman for the
institution of school "miniboards"
that "supply information to the Board
of Trustees and the administration,"
and "saturates the community with
information as to what's going on."
Daniels claims that "in the past five
months good things have been
happening, and that's why Warren
Hayman impressed us. We want to
hold onto this man."
As for Cleveland, Daniels maintains
"we just don't know. We're not
familiar with him, we don't want to
jeopardize our program. We are
fighting a war, a learning war, and we
don't want to change horses in the
middle of it. The people know what
they have in Warren Hayman. They
believe in what they have. They are
attached to him."
Silence
The old board, which supports
Cleveland, "hasn't spoken out on why
they support him" asserts Daniels.
"Maybe he told them he could sell
himself to us."
Hayman himself seems to take the
entire controversy stoically, observing
that the new board "can't undo what
the old board has already done. There
is very little that they can do unless
Cleveland refuses to take the job."
Hayman says he will remain until
July 1 in any case. As for Cleveland's
merits, he says simply "I don't know. I
never met the man."
Syrtiller Kabat, a member of the
current school board that supports
Cleveland, would not comment any
further than to say that "Mr.
Cleveland is a fantastic man and we are
very lucky to have given him the
contract."

TROUBLES - Warren Hayman and the Ravenswood School Board have
troubles. The new board members, elected Tuesday, favor keeping Hayman, the
acting superintendent of schools, as permanent boss. But the outgoing board has
already hired someone else.
