# Let The Garnet Begin
## Presidential Follies 
### 
„ Jerry Coleman

Good afternoon, ladies and
gentlemen. This is your
announcer, direct from Stanford
Stadium, bringing you the
action-packed play-by-play
coverage of this year's ASSU
Games!
We have a little extra time right
here as we wait for Dave Ruiz to
put valve oil in his trumpet and
play the National Anthem, so let
me add a little background color
to the games. As most of you
know, the ASSU stands for the
Articulate Stanford Stadium Users.
these yearly games are a way for
the student body to pick their
student officers.
Back in the Spring of 1973,
after a particularly bitter
campaign for student office, the
President's Select Committee on
Improbable Ideas recommended
to the Faculty Senate that the
usual election procedure be
abolished and replaced by the
present system. Today, rather
than elect officers, the students
stream into the stadium to judge
the gridiron performance of the
major teams, or "slates," as they
are called.
Spree
These slates struggle for
possession of the microphone,
which they then proceed to move
up and down the field through
various verbal maneuvers.
By now, this spring spree has
become quite a ritual and is well
attended by even the most
skeptical of students, for even
they love a good show. And I see
the games are about to begin; the
slates are out on the field and
their rooting sections are roaring
their approval: "Slate One — we
wanna have some fun!" "Slate
Two — F*** you!"
Ah, yes, the true exuberance
and good humor of the students
really shines at times like these.
The crowd, the teams, the Spring
air — it's almost intoxicating!
Realistic Action
There's the coin toss now, and
Slate One has chosen to receive
the mike. One has got it on the
20, they break the huddle
and .. . and it's a long
qualification to the left end.
That's good for 28 yards and a
first down.
One's out of the huddle once
again. . . . This time ... it's a
misrepresentation up the
middle . .. but wait a minute!
Two has caught the mike in a

stunning interception and they're
running back with a lively
response.
It's all Two's mike now as
taunt follows sarcasm, with a few
facts thrown in to take out the
left tackle. Two makes a claim
and ... Fumble! One's got it and
are countering the claim for
formidable yardage. Finally, a
time out is called and we can rest
a bit from the frenetic pace of this
year's games.
De Minimus
Gosh, I remember last year
when we had a slate that based its
offense on those slow but
dependable facts and experiences.
They weren't spectacular but they
made regular yardage. Their
opponents tried some slander and
innuendo late in the fourth
quarter but they just couldn't
grasp control of the mike long
enough to win.
Great jumpin jimminies!! While
the time out's been called, a small
slate from the stands has stormed
on the field and is trying to tear
down the goal posts! The crowd is
booing loudly, and finally the
Santa Clara Tac Squad is springing
into action, clubbing this radical
slate off the field.
It's really a shame, but it seems
like every year, some group or
another is always trying to stop
the games. Maybe they think the
ticket price is too high, but
whatever the reason, they vent
their anti-social feelings upon the
goalposts until public opinion and
the long, vigilant arm of the law
can drag them off.
Non Curat Lex
Well, that just about does it for
first half action. And now we have
some halftime entertainment
provided by the Incomparable
Leland Stanford Junior University
Marching Band, just back from its
recent student-funded out-of-state
tour of Venezuela.
First, the Band salutes "Both
Sides Now" by symbolically
dropping trou. Spelling out ASSU
on the field, the Band next offers
this handy advice to any would-be
student officers: "Keep The
Customer Satisfied." And finally,
forming Three giant Z's, the Band
questions the relevance of student
goverment with the musical
question, "Does Anybody Really
Know What Time It Is?
As the Band marches
backwards off the field, our
second halftime entertainment act

can be seen goose stepping
through the South gate:
presenting a special attraction so
appropriate to today's games, the
Inconceivable University of
Southern California Rubber Band!
Box
Playing such favorites as, "Hail
to Thee, My USC," and "I'm "I'm
Proud to be a Trojan," the SC
band moves in and out of intricate
box formations in their
light-hearted attempt to add zest
to this all-star afternoon.
The slates are back on the field
now folks as our main event
moves toward its climax. Two's
got the mike and they're moving
steadily up the field with
promises, promises. Hammering
away at One's defense, Two
continues to gain small yardage
with plea after mournful plea. It
looks like they're nearing a first
down and ... no — wait! A flag's
down: Two is being penalized 15
yards for begging.
Real Realism
And there's the final gun,
ladies and gentlemen. Both slates
are approaching midfield as the
voting is about to begin. To
express his or her vote, every third
student in the stands makes a
thumbs up or thumbs down
gesture, while the other two
students throw their stunt cards
into the breeze.
The floating cards lend color to
the stadium as well as making an
accurate count of the thumbs
exceedingly difficult. All attempts
are made to approximate reality
in this voting exercise, though
within the stadium context. Now
the highest ranking administrator
present, the Director of Food
Service Produce Purchasing, has
tentatively determined Slate One
to be the winner.
The crowd goes wild as Slate
One moves over to the North Goal
to sign autographs and Committee
Appointments. Slate Two
meanwhile remains in the center
of the field to receive the losers'
traditional consolation prize:
50,000 Banana cream pies thrown
from the stands.
What an afternoon this has
been! I hope to see you all here
for next year's exciting ASSU
games. Until then, this is your
announcer signing off with the
timely motto: "Keep clowning
around — the real world can
wait!"
(Jerry's column returns next week.)
