# Politics & Fee Assessments
## A 						Big Question About Legal Aid 
### 
Citizens Advocates

Those students proposing a fee assessment for the Legal Counseling
Office on this week's ASSU ballot took pains to disassociate
themselves from Citizen's Advocates, the proposed public interest law
firm defeated last March. Bill Bolger, the current president of the
Stanford Legal Aid Society, stated in a Daily article last Friday that
Stanford students had no business funding a public interest law firm
when they didn't have a student interest law firm. He wanted you to
know that not a penny of your dollar will go to aid anyone but a
Stanford student.
We find this appeal to self-interest distressing, particularly in light
of Citizen's Advocates overwhelming defeat last month. We proposed
Citizen's Advocates believing that Stanford students are an
appropriate group to fund an experimental public interest law project:
generally from affluent families, they could afford one dollar a term
(those who couldn't could retrieve their dollar); fortunate enough to
attend an elite institution, they could use their position to support
some small improvements in society at large. Citizen's Advocates
failed because our critics convinced a large number of students that
there was nothing in it for them.
Sophomoric
During our campaign, Scott Burke assembled a group to spread the
campus with leaflets reading "Take a minute to save yourself a buck â€”
Vote no on Citizen's Advocates." Scott's sophomoric, but effective
response was at least more honest than the elliptical reasons offered
by the Daily for not supporting Citizen's Advocates. Why, asked the
Daily in an editorial couldn't the University pay for it, if the idea of a
public interest law project was sound? With a moment's consideration
the Daily could have answered its own question: first, direct
university funding inevitably precludes complete independence from
the Board of Trustees; and secondly, direct university funding is still,
in large part, ultimately student funding in the form of tuition (a

more coercive form of student funding than the proposed fee
assessment, since no part of your tuition is refundable).
We cannot believe, however, that the Daily s proposal for
University funding of the project was serious; the true motivation of
the Editorial Board majority appears to have been the same selfish
"save-yourselves-a-buck" response that Burke displayed.
The suggestion that some other group should address itself to a
social problem strikes a distressingly familiar cord today. Whenever
you say "let someone else do it" everyone understands the code; you
really mean "let's not do it at all."
Nixon's The Same
Nixon, the master of this code, justifies the elimination of federal
poverty programs with the suggestion that these programs can be
continued under state auspices (through revenue sharing funds that
have already been allocated to pay for more police or to grant citizens
a tax refund). Why do people feel it is necessary to resort to this
code? Why not honestly insist that those who enjoy the status quo
have no interest in programs which might upset it; and really its a
little irrational of others to expect them to act differently. It sounds
of course not quite respectable to state the proposition so badly.
We never believed that our proposal for Citizen's Advocates was
beyond criticism. We had doubts ourselves about the ultimate
effectiveness of an organization which would depend so enormously
on student efforts. However, we heard no thoughtful criticism about
the structure or possibilities of Citizens Advocates, but merely
whining statements about students being "coerced" to support a
project which would not benefit themselves directly. This careless
response to our proposal from students in positions of leadership no
doubt led others to believe that these selfish motivations furnished
respectable reasons for voting against Citizen's Advocates.
Selfish
The care those now proposing the Legal Counseling Office take to
distinguish themselves from Citizen's Advocates and to insist that
their office will benefit no one but students works further to
legitimatize these selfish interests.
Fortunately, the shortsightedness and selfishness displayed in the
campaigns against Citizen's Advocates and for the Legal Counseling
Office does not run as rampant on other university campuses as it
does at Stanford. Students have established public interest firms
through fee assessments on over a dozen leading campuses in the
country, and every other major campus in the Bay Area has a project
similar in conception to Citizen's Advocates. The Stanford student
body has revived its national reputation as a hotbed of complacency.
Those of us who worked hard on Citizen's Advocates are not
opposed to a fee assessment for the Legal Counseling Office. We
recognize that there is a need on the part of some students for regular
legal aid services and that even those students who can afford to hire
attorneys at least need initial advice on where to find legal assistance.
We hope, however, that our dollars will not go to support legal
representation for those who can well affold to pay for it themselves
and that some day the Office will incorporate other interests into its
operation besides the immediate, short-term interest of Stanford
students. You don't have to be a Weatherman to know which way the
wind is blowing, but it's unfortunate that those students proposing
the Legal Counseling Office, like politicans everywhere, are willing to
use any foul wind in the air to fill their sails.
