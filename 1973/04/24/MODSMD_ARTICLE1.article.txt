# ASSU Presidential Election
## One Slate Run-Off Planned 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
ASSU Elections Commissioner Mike Nilsson said
yesterday that a Presidential run-off election will be held
tomorrow with only one name on the ballot—Kevin
O'Grady's.
The bizarre "one-man election" decision came after a
weekend of negotiations with other candidates in last
week's primary. O'Grady won the primary with about
49.7 percent of the votes, just a handful of ballots away
from taking an outright majority.
Vice President Peter Van Petten, who finished a distant
second, withdrew his slate from contention over the
weekend. Normally, Van Petten would have faced
O'Grady in the run-off.
Nilsson reversed himself several times before settling on
the one-man run-off as the only way to satisfy what he
called "contradictory provisions" in the ASSU
constitution and by-laws.
Gans Spokesman
Chris Hocker, spokesman for the Judy Gans-Buzz
Thompson slate that finished third in last week's voting,
said he thought "the fair thing to do" would have been to
put Gans on the run-off ballot after Van Petten's
withdrawal, but said that Gans would not challenge
Nilsson's ruling. "There's not much we can do," Hocker
said.
On election night, Nilsson said he would ask Van
Petten to withdraw because O'Grady came as close to
obtaining an absolute majority. At that time, Nilsson
indicated that a Van Petten withdrawal would be
tantamount to an O'Grady victory.
The constitution and by-laws, however, say that the

president must be elected by a majority of those voting.
They also mandate a run-off between the top two
vote-getters if no one receives a majority in the primary .
Run-Off Procedure
Since Van Petten withdrew according to the procedure
outlined in the by-laws, he was no longer a candidate. But
since Gans finished third in the primary, sh<? could not be
considered one of the top two vote-getters to be included
in a run-off, according to Nilsson.
Sources participating in the weekend negotiations
claimed that Nilsson was "bowing to political pressure" in
arranging the one-slate run-off.
Nilsson, however, defends his decision as the only one
feasible. "I admit, I think this is the most farcial thing,"
he said yesterday. But he said it was the only
constitutional solution.
Possible Waiver
There is still a chance that another election could be
avoided. The ASSU Senate could use its power of
constitutional interpretation to waive the
majority-necessary requirement, and cancel tomorrow's
election. The Senate is scheduled to meet tonight, but
some sources foresee difficulty in obtaining a quorum.
Nilsson said yesterday that he will ask the Senate to
call off the election if a quorum is reached.
Poll hours will be frcm 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. tomorrow at
the only two polling places, the engineering corner and
the post office, assuming the election is held as scheduled.
O'Grady and the rest of his slate—Beth Garfield,
Charles Ogletree and Jim Friend—will take office
immediately after the Senate accepts the results of the
election.

call off the election if a quorum is reached.
Poll hours will be frcm 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. tomorrow at
the only two polling places, the engineering corner and
the post office, assuming the election is held as scheduled.
O'Grady and the rest of his slate—Beth Garfield,
Charles Ogletree and Jim Friend—will take office
immediately after the Senate accepts the results of the
election.

PROGRESS—Despite a particularly rainy winter which slowed construction of the new Law School, Dean of the Law
School Thomas Ehrlich says he still hopes the building will be ready by Autumn, 1974. Meanwhile, graffiti artists have
taken advantage of the boards surrounding the construction site.
ASSU Elections Commissioner Mike Nilsson said
yesterday that a Presidential run-off election will be held
tomorrow with only one name on the ballot—Kevin
O'Grady's.
The bizarre "one-man election" decision came after a
weekend of negotiations with other candidates in last
week's primary. O'Grady won the primary with about
49.7 percent of the votes, just a handful of ballots away
from taking an outright majority.
Vice President Peter Van Petten, who finished a distant
second, withdrew his slate from contention over the
weekend. Normally, Van Petten would have faced
O'Grady in the run-off.
Nilsson reversed himself several times before settling on
the one-man run-off as the only way to satisfy what he
called "contradictory provisions" in the ASSU
constitution and by-laws.
Gans Spokesman
Chris Hocker, spokesman for the Judy Gans-Buzz
Thompson slate that finished third in last week's voting,
said he thought "the fair thing to do" would have been to
put Gans on the run-off ballot after Van Petten's
withdrawal, but said that Gans would not challenge
Nilsson's ruling. "There's not much we can do," Hocker
said.
On election night, Nilsson said he would ask Van
Petten to withdraw because O'Grady came as close to
obtaining an absolute majority. At that time, Nilsson
indicated that a Van Petten withdrawal would be
tantamount to an O'Grady victory.
The constitution and by-laws, however, say that the

president must be elected by a majority of those voting.
They also mandate a run-off between the top two
vote-getters if no one receives a majority in the primary .
Run-Off Procedure
Since Van Petten withdrew according to the procedure
outlined in the by-laws, he was no longer a candidate. But
since Gans finished third in the primary, sh<? could not be
considered one of the top two vote-getters to be included
in a run-off, according to Nilsson.
Sources participating in the weekend negotiations
claimed that Nilsson was "bowing to political pressure" in
arranging the one-slate run-off.
Nilsson, however, defends his decision as the only one
feasible. "I admit, I think this is the most farcial thing,"
he said yesterday. But he said it was the only
constitutional solution.
Possible Waiver
There is still a chance that another election could be
avoided. The ASSU Senate could use its power of
constitutional interpretation to waive the
majority-necessary requirement, and cancel tomorrow's
election. The Senate is scheduled to meet tonight, but
some sources foresee difficulty in obtaining a quorum.
