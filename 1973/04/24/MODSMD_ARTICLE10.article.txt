THEN YOU ARE A POTENTIAL
WITNESS BEFORE A GRAND
JURY.
Special grand juries are being
used by the Internal Securities
Division of the Justice
Department much as the House
Unamerican Activities Committee
was used during the McCarthy era
— as a tool of political repression.
A common tactic of the
government is to avoid movement

leaders and to subpoena instead
those on the fringe of the
movement.
Recently, Ed Kohn outlined
the state of the grand jury system
today. (Daily, April 6, 1973) In
this article, I will present a
specific case — that of Kenneth
Tierney and his experiences
before the Fort Worth Grand
Jury.
Patriot
Kenneth Tierney, a nurse and
physical therapist at Columbia
Presbyterian Hospital in New
York City and a father, is an Irish
American immigrant and a
naturalized American citizen. Mr.
Tierney participated in several
Irish American organizations in
New York City. He considered
himself an American patriot with
strong feelings for Ireland.

In June, 1972 Kenneth Tierney
was subpoenaed in New York City
to appear before a grand jury
sitting in Fort Worth, Texas. He
was given about one week notice
to appear. The government
refused to reveal the purpose of
its investigation or to give reasons
why the witnesses had to travel to
Texas to appear.
On June 16, 1972 Kenneth
Tierney appeared before the grand
jury alone, his attorney not being
allowed - to enter the grand jury
room. Tierney faced a government
attorney and Fort Worth citizens.
No judge was present.
On that same day the
government revealed the purpose
of the investigation — to uncover
those involved in an alleged
shipment of guns to Northern
Ireland.

Tierney refused to testify on
several grounds: 1) his Fifth
Amendment right to protection
from self incrimination; 2)
tainting of evidence due to illegal
electronic surveillance of his
attorney and himself (Fourth
Amendment); 3) Ninth
Amendment right to privacy; 4)
his right to counsel which, he
claimed, included the presence of
his attorney in the grand jury
room.
Fifth Amendment
He was then given a hearing at
which he received "use
immunity" after his Fifth
Amendment argument was
upheld. Use immunity compels a
witness to answer government
questions in return for immunity
from prosecution using his own
testimony, but does not guarantee
the witness protection from
prosecution — the witness remains
subject to indictment based on
evidence from other sources. In
effect, use immunity steals the
Fifth Amendment rights, giving
almost no protection in return.
Returned to the grand jury
room, Tierney was again asked
questions and again he refused to
testify claiming his legal rights. He
was quickly given a contempt
hearing at which he once again
raised his rights and was once
again denied them.
The judge held that Kenneth
Tierney was in civil contempt,
remanded him to the Tarrant
County Jail, and denied him bail
pending appeal — all without
being charged with any crime or
convicted of any offense.
All Denied
All Tierney's appeals have been
denied and the Supreme Court
refused to hear his most recent
one.
Kenneth Tierney has spent five
months in prison, and his
imprisonment may well continue
through the life of the current
grand jury due to expire on Nov.
2, 1973. On Nov. 3, 1973, he
could be served with a new
subpoena to appear before a new
grand jury with the possibility of
as much as another eighteen
months in prison if he refuses to
testify.
There are several reasons why
witnesses all across the United
States are refusing to testify
before the abusive Nixon grand
juries. Among these are:
1. Many rights guaranteed by
the Constitution (e.g., sth, 4th,
Ist, and 9th Amendments) and
many procedures granted
defendants in court trial are
denied to a witness and/or abused
in grand jury proceedings.
2. A witness may unwittingly
reveal information, which on the
surface uncovers only legal
activities, but which may lead to
future grand jury probes or may
give the government useful
information for future
government investigations.
Representative Bella Abzug,
Senator Edward Kennedy, the
ACLU, and the National Lawyers
Guild have spoken out strongly
against the repressive nature of
modern grand juries and against
the gross violation of civil
liberties. Senator Kennedy:
.. we have witnessed the
birth of a new breed of political
animal — the kangaroo grand
jury ... a dangerous modern form
of Star Chamber secret inquisition
that is trampling the rights of
American citizens from coast to
coast."
Tonight at 7:30 p.m., there
will be a Forum On The Grand
Jury in Tresidder Union, Room
281 (Large Lounge). There will be
witnesses, jurors, and a film.
COME ONE; COME ALL.
