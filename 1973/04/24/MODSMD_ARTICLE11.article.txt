# It's On The Way
## Help For Med Redhots 
### 
Bogus, Peterson

On Friday, April 13, the
Biology department lodged a
formal complaint concerning
Economics 1 people who stayed
later than their allotted time while
taking a test before a Bio 23 class.
They were upset because it took
Econ 1 people so long to get out.
Well, guess what? We have
trouble getting out of two of our
classes. And guess what classes
follow? Bio 23 follows Econ 1
and Bio 1 follows Human Biology
48. These people are so eager to
learn that they are coming in
before our classes are over.
MCATS!
So we would like to lodge a
formal complaint against the Bio

department for failure to control
their students. MCATS! The
trouble is that the only way to
control these people is to give
tests or start lecturing. Then the
heads will be buried in the
notebooks for fifty minutes.
Courtesy
After going through the core in
Human Biology and also being
exposed to Bio people (they're
worse), we considered giving them
a class in courtesy — but we
decided they would cheat on the
tests to get A's, so we've dropped
the idea.
Instead of trying to reform
these pre-Meds, we are going to
help them on their merry way. We

would like to officially announce
the formation of the Stanford
chapter of the Future Doctors of
America (FDA). MCATS! The
purpose of this organization is to
foster the attainment of an MD.
Dues will be $200 per quarter and
refundable if the person does not
Med school. This might
sotfnd pretty steep ($6OO/year or
$2,400/4 years), but consider the
benefits.
New techniques for cheating
on the MCAT (including
micro-cheat sheets which can be
easily inserted into your
electronic calculator) will be
offered with an option of having
someone take the test for you
($5OO extra). SWOPSI courses will
be instituted on stealing reserve
books and all-around cheating.
Techniques for phoning in bomb
scares to midterms will be taught.
(Don't laugh, this takes accurate
timing.) MCATS!
Phony
Phony, but as good as you will
get anywhere, recommendations
for Med Schools will be included.
Also, for those who feel
completely lost in Humanities
classes, we are accumulating an
inventory of term papers by
Stanford students over the past
five years (all A papers).
An added bonus is that your
membership in the FDA will
entitle you to a 50 percent
discount at Term Paper, Inc. if
our service is not good enough for
you. MCATS!
Finally we will provide
individual copies of midterms and
finals for important classes of the
past two years. We will also offer
the option of getting copies of
actual midterms ($2O) and finals
($5O) within 24 hours of the test.
Horse Pitute?
We do not want to sound
anti-intellectual, but we feel there
is a difference between learning
and horse pitute. It is not our
intent to raise curves in the red
hot classes. Rather our idea is
formulated to give more time to
the individual so he can better
allot his time to things important
to him. If that happens to be
organic chemistry, we'll just have
to reckon that some people are
sick.
We only want to help those less
fortunate than ourselves make it
big. MCATS! We hope to insure
that the people who really want
to be doctors can make it. For

meeting (in case you do not want
your friends to know you are

America (FDA). MCATS! The
purpose of this organization is to
foster the attainment of an MD.
Dues will be $200 per quarter and
refundable if the person does not
Med school. This might
sotfnd pretty steep ($6OO/year or
$2,400/4 years), but consider the
benefits.
New techniques for cheating
on the MCAT (including
micro-cheat sheets which can be
easily inserted into your
electronic calculator) will be
offered with an option of having
someone take the test for you
($5OO extra). SWOPSI courses will
be instituted on stealing reserve
books and all-around cheating.
Techniques for phoning in bomb
scares to midterms will be taught.
(Don't laugh, this takes accurate
timing.) MCATS!
Phony
Phony, but as good as you will
get anywhere, recommendations
for Med Schools will be included.
Also, for those who feel
completely lost in Humanities
classes, we are accumulating an
inventory of term papers by
Stanford students over the past
five years (all A papers).
An added bonus is that your
membership in the FDA will
entitle you to a 50 percent
discount at Term Paper, Inc. if
our service is not good enough for
you. MCATS!
Finally we will provide
individual copies of midterms and
finals for important classes of the
past two years. We will also offer
the option of getting copies of
actual midterms ($2O) and finals
($5O) within 24 hours of the test.
Horse Pitute?
We do not want to sound
anti-intellectual, but we feel there
is a difference between learning
and horse pitute. It is not our
intent to raise curves in the red
hot classes. Rather our idea is
formulated to give more time to
the individual so he can better
allot his time to things important
to him. If that happens to be
organic chemistry, we'll just have
to reckon that some people are
sick.
We only want to help those less
fortunate than ourselves make it
big. MCATS! We hope to insure
that the people who really want
to be doctors can make it. For
information on an organizational
meeting (in case you do not want
your friends to know you are
joining) call, toll free,

On Friday, April 13, the
Biology department lodged a
formal complaint concerning
Economics 1 people who stayed
later than their allotted time while
taking a test before a Bio 23 class.
They were upset because it took
Econ 1 people so long to get out.
Well, guess what? We have
trouble getting out of two of our
classes. And guess what classes
follow? Bio 23 follows Econ 1
and Bio 1 follows Human Biology
48. These people are so eager to
learn that they are coming in
before our classes are over.
MCATS!
So we would like to lodge a
formal complaint against the Bio

department for failure to control
their students. MCATS! The
trouble is that the only way to
control these people is to give
tests or start lecturing. Then the
heads will be buried in the
notebooks for fifty minutes.

After going through the core in
Human Biology and also being
exposed to Bio people (they're
worse), we considered giving them
a class in courtesy — but we
decided they would cheat on the
tests to get A's, so we've dropped
the idea.
Instead of trying to reform
these pre-Meds, we are going to
help them on their merry way. We

would like to officially announce
the formation of the Stanford
chapter of the Future Doctors of
America (FDA). MCATS! The
purpose of this organization is to
