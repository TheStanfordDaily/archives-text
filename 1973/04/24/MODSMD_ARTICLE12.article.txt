# A 						'Sick Giant'
## Auto Biz Blues

Thomas M. Rees

Detroit has won another round in its campaign to pollute the
atmosphere of this country. With the Environmental Protection
Agency giving in on its effort to force the Detroit automakers to
adhere to the 1975 pure air standards, Americans can look forward to
more bouts with dirty, choking, eye-searing and killing smog.
It's always been so. What the automakers want, they usually get.
The "damn the public welfare" attitude that has always seemed to
prevail continues to rule the roost at General Motors, Ford, and
Chrysler.
As odd or shocking as it might seem, practically all the
improvements to the American automobile designed to protect the
public, such as seat-belts, adequate bumpers, and now air pollution
control devices, have been mandated by the Congress and forced on
the automakers over their opposition. They prefer utilizing their
efforts on developing sales gimmicks and designing new garish front
grills, tail fins, or hydraulic toe rests.
Demented
Our auto industry is sick — it's been sick a long time. Our auto
exports shrink as the import of foreign autos skyrockets. Detroit's
answer to the Volkswagen was the Edsel. Here is an industry isolated
in the machinations of its own ego — the demented king who claims
supremacy as his once great empire wastes away.
The prime example of the ineptness of this sick giant is its inability
to clean up the dirty engine. But while Detroit insisted that it could
not possibly meet the 1975 clean air standards, foreign automakers
have shown that they can.
Toyo-Kogyo Company, a Japanese automaker which produces
Mazda, an automobile with a Wankel rotary engine built under a
German patent, qualified; so did Mercedes, a German automaker with
a diesel engine. Another Japanese automaker, Honda, stated that it
would be able to meet the 1975 standards.
Most of these automakers — all foreign — which have met the clean
air standards have developed new technology which enables them to
redesign the motor in order to create their low emission autos.
Detroit, on the other hand, is still fiddling around with a catalytic
converter concept that is not very effective and has been around for
too many years to remember.
Let's face it, with regard to automobiles the United States has
become an underdeveloped country. Our vaunted technology has been
long outmoded. Maybe the Japanese and the Germans should include
us in their foreign aid program; they could teach us how to build
efficient smog-free motor vehicles.
