## TWO LETTERS FROM THE WOMEN'S HISTORY CAUCUS 
### 
One For The Dean . ..
Dear Dean Hastorf,
We would like to express our
extreme dissatisfaction with the
fact that there will be no women
on the faculty of the History
Department next year. The
women who are now with the
department will not be on the
faculty after this year, and none
of the three new positions being
filled this year are being filled
with women.
Inasmuch as search committees
proceed in secrecy, we cannot
know the details of their
activities. However, it is
inconceivable to us that there are
no qualified women for at least
one or two of these positions.
(See the American Historical
Association Newsletters for
September 1971 and May 1972.)
We do know that there are doubts
about the thoroughness and
equity of one of the searches in
particular, and that there is not
unanimous satisfaction with the
quality of at least two of the
candidates.
It seems unnecessary to
rehearse again the reasons why
efforts should be made to recruit
women for the Stanford faculty.
It is a matter of both justice to
women faculty and justice to
female (and male) students who
are otherwise deprived of the
benefits of a fully coeducational
education.
Two of these appointments
have not yet been approved by
the University. We urge you to
make a full investigation of this
matter before deciding to approve
these appointments. We
recommend that no permanent
appointments for these positions
be made this year unless excellent
candidates can be found.
The History Women's Caucus
. . . And One For The 'Daily'
Editor:
A few corrections are in order
concerning Doyle McManus'
column [Daily, April 18] on
feminism at Stanford. The History
Women's Caucus is in its third
year of existence, rather than only
having sprung up recently.
Certainly, we have increased our
activity a good deal in light of the
recent developments in the
department.
Presently, there are two
women, other than visiting
professors, who are teaching in
the department, not one. It is our
understanding that neither woman
will be with the department next
year, though this is not absolutely
certain for one.
Regarding the position opening
in Enlightenment (or early
modern European intellectual
history): indeed, it has been let
out that this would be a position
for a woman. But it is illegal for a
department to specify that a
position is for a woman only — all
searches must be open and
thorough, so there can be no
absolute assurance that this new
position will go to a woman. In
any case, the chance of filling the
position by next fall would be
pretty dim. Of the three positions
now being filled in the
department, the shortest search
lasted two years.
Thank you for your
sympathetic coverage. The
department is indeed "loath to
dispense much information on the
subject," so your factual errors
are understandable. We are
opposed to such secrecy; there
would be fewer misunderstandings
if more information were
available, and the department
would have more difficulty
getting away with some of the
things that it does.
Last fall the Stanford
Affirmative Action report
designated the History
Department as one of the six
"problem areas" in the
Humanities and Sciences. It is
even more of a problem now than
it was then. The situation must be
remedied immediately.

The History Women's Caucus
. . . And One For The 'Daily'
Editor:
A few corrections are in order
concerning Doyle McManus'
column [Daily, April 18] on
feminism at Stanford. The History
Women's Caucus is in its third
year of existence, rather than only
having sprung up recently.
Certainly, we have increased our
activity a good deal in light of the
recent developments in the
department.
Presently, there are two
women, other than visiting
professors, who are teaching in
the department, not one. It is our
understanding that neither woman
will be with the department next
year, though this is not absolutely
certain for one.
Regarding the position opening
in Enlightenment (or early
modern European intellectual
history): indeed, it has been let
out that this would be a position
for a woman. But it is illegal for a
department to specify that a
position is for a woman only — all
searches must be open and
thorough, so there can be no
absolute assurance that this new
position will go to a woman. In
any case, the chance of filling the
position by next fall would be
pretty dim. Of the three positions
now being filled in the
department, the shortest search
lasted two years.
Thank you for your
sympathetic coverage. The
department is indeed "loath to
dispense much information on the
subject," so your factual errors
are understandable. We are
opposed to such secrecy; there
would be fewer misunderstandings
if more information were
available, and the department
would have more difficulty
getting away with some of the
things that it does.
Last fall the Stanford
Affirmative Action report
designated the History
Department as one of the six
"problem areas" in the
Humanities and Sciences. It is
even more of a problem now than
it was then. The situation must be
remedied immediately.

One For The Dean . ..
Dear Dean Hastorf,
We would like to express our
extreme dissatisfaction with the
fact that there will be no women
on the faculty of the History
Department next year. The
women who are now with the
department will not be on the
faculty after this year, and none
of the three new positions being
filled this year are being filled
with women.
Inasmuch as search committees
proceed in secrecy, we cannot
know the details of their
activities. However, it is
inconceivable to us that there are
no qualified women for at least
one or two of these positions.
(See the American Historical
Association Newsletters for
September 1971 and May 1972.)
We do know that there are doubts
about the thoroughness and
equity of one of the searches in
particular, and that there is not
unanimous satisfaction with the
quality of at least two of the
candidates.
It seems unnecessary to
rehearse again the reasons why
efforts should be made to recruit
women for the Stanford faculty.
It is a matter of both justice to
women faculty and justice to
female (and male) students who
are otherwise deprived of the
benefits of a fully coeducational
education.
Two of these appointments
have not yet been approved by
the University. We urge you to
make a full investigation of this
matter before deciding to approve
these appointments. We
recommend that no permanent
appointments for these positions
be made this year unless excellent
candidates can be found.
