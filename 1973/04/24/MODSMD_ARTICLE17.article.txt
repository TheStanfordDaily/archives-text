# Nixon Battles Congress
## Executive Privilege Claim Protested 
### Associated Press 
WASHINGTON - President
Nixon's insistence on broad
authority for executive silence
began at the Watergate's edge —
but gave way to compromise and
a tide of congressional and
political protest.
His decision to permit
testimony by his aides in the
Senate's Watergate investigation
averts what could have been a
constitutional showdown on the

doctrine of executive privilege.
But that issue hasn't gone
away. And there remain disputes
over warmaking powers and
presidential authority to undo
programs enacted by Congress.
All three involve what the
Constitution says and what it
means.
As lawyer, candidate and
President, Nixon has pronounced
himself dedicated to a strict
interpretation of the Constitution.

He set that as his test for Supreme
Court nominees.
The current controversies
between Congress and the White
House hinge on who does the
interpreting. Presidential
authority in the areas of executive
privilege, undeclared war and the
impoundment of appropriated
funds involves powers that are
implied, not spelled out, in the
Constitution.
Before he became President,
Nixon criticized the Supreme
Court for decisions he said moved
it into lawmaking areas that really
belonged to Congress.
. . Under our Constitution,
the true responsibility for writing
the law is with Congress," he said
on July 7, 1968. "The
responsibility for executing the
law is with the executive and the
responsibility for interpreting the
law resides in the Supreme Court.
I believe in a strict interpretation
of the Supreme Court's
functions."
Nixon critics contend now that
his actions are blurring those lines
of constitutional authority.
Executive privilege is a
doctrine — not a law — under
which presidents have refused to
permit congressional testimony by
their aides.
Earlier in the Watergate
controversy. Nixon expanded
upon it to declare that past and
present members of his staff
would decline to appear before
formal sessions of congressional
committees. The administration
said it could be invoked to cover
any executive branch employee if
the President decided silence was
in order.
In yielding to permit
appearances, but not necessarily
answers to all questions, in the
Watergate investigation, Nixon
said he was making an exception,
not dropping his rule.
Pressure and protests from
leading figures in his own
Republican party preceded the
shift by a President who once had
challenged the Senate to a
Supreme Court test on the issue.
It could flare again another,
lesser controversy, for the White
House has cited executive
privilege in refusing to give
Congress records of
government-financed travel during
the 1972 presidential campaign.
The war powers controversy
arose time and again during the
Vietnam conflict, and it has been
revived by new U.S. bombing in
Cambodia and Laos.
Nixon critics contend he has
no legal or constitutional
authority for the bombing, and
there is a move underway in the
Senate to ban it unless Congress
specifically approves.
The administration has claimed
authority for Indochina actions in
the President's constitutional role
as commander in chief.
"The administration's
constitutional authority to bomb
Cambodia rests on the

circumstance that we are coming
out of a 10-year period of
conflict," said Secretary of
Defense Elliot L. Richardson.
"This is the windup."
That has been challenged in
Congress. Sen. Walter F. Mondale
(D-Minn.), contended that any
new action in Indochina is in
effect a new war, requiring
approval of Congress.
Legislation now pending, and
opposed by the administration,
would define and limit executive
authority to use U.S troops
abroad in any future conflict.
In the third area of disputed
prerogatives, the administration

has been challenged in court for
refusing to spend money on some
programs despite laws creating
and financing them.
Twice, in cases involving
impounded highway aid funds and
the dismantling of the Office of
Enonomic Opportunity, federal
judges have ruled that the
administration acted illegally.
Either case could wind up in
the Supreme Court. And
legislation in the Senate would
empower Congress to overrule the
President whenever he seeks to
impound appropriated funds.
Nixon has withheld at least $8.7
billion voted by Congress.

impoundment of appropriated
funds involves powers that are
implied, not spelled out, in the
Constitution.
Before he became President,
Nixon criticized the Supreme
Court for decisions he said moved
it into lawmaking areas that really
belonged to Congress.
. . Under our Constitution,
the true responsibility for writing
the law is with Congress," he said
on July 7, 1968. "The
responsibility for executing the
law is with the executive and the
responsibility for interpreting the
law resides in the Supreme Court.
I believe in a strict interpretation
of the Supreme Court's
functions."
Nixon critics contend now that
his actions are blurring those lines
of constitutional authority.
Executive privilege is a
doctrine — not a law — under
which presidents have refused to
permit congressional testimony by
their aides.
Earlier in the Watergate
controversy. Nixon expanded
upon it to declare that past and
present members of his staff
would decline to appear before
formal sessions of congressional
committees. The administration
said it could be invoked to cover
any executive branch employee if
the President decided silence was
in order.
In yielding to permit
appearances, but not necessarily
answers to all questions, in the
Watergate investigation, Nixon
said he was making an exception,
not dropping his rule.
Pressure and protests from
leading figures in his own
Republican party preceded the
shift by a President who once had
challenged the Senate to a
Supreme Court test on the issue.
It could flare again another,
lesser controversy, for the White
House has cited executive
privilege in refusing to give
Congress records of
government-financed travel during
the 1972 presidential campaign.
The war powers controversy
arose time and again during the
Vietnam conflict, and it has been
revived by new U.S. bombing in
Cambodia and Laos.
Nixon critics contend he has
no legal or constitutional
authority for the bombing, and
there is a move underway in the
Senate to ban it unless Congress
specifically approves.
The administration has claimed
authority for Indochina actions in
the President's constitutional role
as commander in chief.
"The administration's
constitutional authority to bomb
Cambodia rests on the

circumstance that we are coming
out of a 10-year period of
conflict," said Secretary of
Defense Elliot L. Richardson.
"This is the windup."
That has been challenged in
Congress. Sen. Walter F. Mondale
(D-Minn.), contended that any
new action in Indochina is in
effect a new war, requiring
approval of Congress.
Legislation now pending, and
opposed by the administration,
would define and limit executive
authority to use U.S troops
abroad in any future conflict.
In the third area of disputed
prerogatives, the administration

has been challenged in court for
refusing to spend money on some
programs despite laws creating
and financing them.
Twice, in cases involving
impounded highway aid funds and
the dismantling of the Office of
Enonomic Opportunity, federal
judges have ruled that the
administration acted illegally.
Either case could wind up in
the Supreme Court. And
legislation in the Senate would
empower Congress to overrule the
President whenever he seeks to
impound appropriated funds.
Nixon has withheld at least $8.7
billion voted by Congress.

EXECUTIVE PRlVlLEGE—President Nixon's insistence upon the
privilege of silence for members of his staff began with the first
rumblings over the Watergate bugging case and has been widely
criticized by certain members of Congress.
WASHINGTON - President
Nixon's insistence on broad
authority for executive silence
began at the Watergate's edge —
but gave way to compromise and
a tide of congressional and
political protest.
His decision to permit
testimony by his aides in the
Senate's Watergate investigation
averts what could have been a
constitutional showdown on the

doctrine of executive privilege.
But that issue hasn't gone
away. And there remain disputes
over warmaking powers and
presidential authority to undo
programs enacted by Congress.
All three involve what the
Constitution says and what it
means.
As lawyer, candidate and
President, Nixon has pronounced
himself dedicated to a strict
interpretation of the Constitution.

He set that as his test for Supreme
Court nominees.
The current controversies
between Congress and the White
House hinge on who does the
interpreting. Presidential
authority in the areas of executive
privilege, undeclared war and the
impoundment of appropriated
funds involves powers that are
implied, not spelled out, in the
Constitution.

Nixon criticized the Supreme
Court for decisions he said moved
it into lawmaking areas that really
