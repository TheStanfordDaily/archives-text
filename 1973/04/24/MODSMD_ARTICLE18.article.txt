Is the futurists' seminalization theory of Hoover Tower valid, or
merely a result of fertile imagination? H.D.
Two University experts on the subject, James Siena, Legal Advisor
to President Lyman, and Vice Provost and Advisor to the President,
Robert Rosenzweig, gave these statements:
Rosenzweig: Yes and no.
Siena: I never comment on matters under litigation.
Why do the garbage trucks come around at 7:30 in the morning?
Can't they come at any other time? R.B.
According to Roads and Grounds Manager Perry Hackett there are
two reasons why the garbage trucks have to make their rounds
beginning at 6 a.m. for faculty and staff residences and dorms at 7
a.m.:
1. If they wait until later the traffic is so heavy that the garbage
trucks can't get into some areas, and
2. Because of increased traffic later in the day the drivers would
have to cover their routes more slowly and the cost of garbage
collection would go up.
It seems, then, that there is no chance of getting the hours of
collection changed. You can take some comfort in this, though:
Hackett says that trucks start later here at Stanford than anywhere
else in the Bay area. He also noted that people at Moffett Field are
complaining about the hours of garbage collection, too â€” but their
trucks begin operating at 5:30 a.m.
How did the Nitery get its name? G.I.
No one knows for sure how the Nitery, located in the Old Union,
got its name.
The first reference to it in the Daily was on Nov. 11, 1947. In the
article, the building was referred to as "the Nitery."
Wendell Cole, acting chairman of the Drama Dept., said that what
is presently the Nitery was a part of the Men's Union when it was
built, which was around World War I. He said that the name "Nitery"
may go back to that time.
Cole hypothesized that the name grew up because the building was
used as a kind of lounge where speeches, dances and other evening
events of various kinds were held.
