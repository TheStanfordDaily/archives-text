# Watergate Allegations Mount
## White House Cover-Up Charged 
### 
From The Associated Press
WASHINGTON — Senate sources
said yesterday that investigators have
evidence there was an elaborate White
House effort to cover up high level
involvement in the Watergate affair.
The evidence indicates presidential
aides H.R. Haldeman and John D.
Ehrlichman were among the
participants, the sources said.
They said there is no question
President Nixon was aware of a
coverup effort, perhaps as early as a
few days after the break-in at
Democratic headquarters in the
Watergate building June 17.
The sources refused to describe the
reported cover-up in detail, but said
one phase included "attempts to
pressure other officials in the
government to go along." The sources
said the other officials included
ranking members of the Justice
Department and FBI.
Acting FBI Director L. Patrick

Gray presumably was in that group,
and his testimony before the Senate
Judiciary Committee regarding the
Watergate investigation indicated he
refused to cooperate with the reported
coverup.
"The coverup is even more
damning than the Watergate itself,"
the sources, said, and it likely will
result in more resignations from the
White House staff."
Ehrlichman, they predicted, will be
among those forced to resign when the
details of the operation become
public.
Ehrlichman, chief of President
Nixon's domestic affairs council, sc far
has escaped prominent mention in
reports of White House involvement
in Watergate.
News Leaks
Gray did say in his Senate
testimony, however, that Ehrlichman
and presidential counsel John W. Dean
111 called him on the carpet following

news leaks regarding the FBl's
Watergate investigation.
The prosecutor in the Watergate
case, Earl J. Silbert, has been quoted
by frie/ids as saying that Atty. Gen.
Richard G. Kleindienat called him into
his office early in the Watergate
investigation and told him to "go
slow" in returning indictments. Silbert
reportedly refused.
Siib« >• publicly denied Friday ever
having told friends of such a meeting,
or ever having met privately with
Kleindienst.
The Senate sources said there
indicates the President didn't know
about j < Vatergate raid until after it
occurred but that he was aware there
was a political espionage operation
within the Committee for the
Re-election of the President.
When former Atty. Gen. John N.
Mitchell resigned as director of the
re-election committee two weeks after
the break-in, "the President knew why
he was resigning — that it was because
of Watergate," the sources said.
Mitchell's public explanation for
leaving his post was to devote some
more time to his wife, Martha.
Intelligence System
Recently, Haldeman told a group of
Republican congressmen that he had
set up a system to gather campaign
intelligence, but said the system used
purely legal means such as clipping
newspapers and recording speeches by
the other side.
The sources also said James McCord

testified to Senate investigators that he
had been offered presidential
clemency if he went to jail without
identifying anyone else higher up in
the Watergate affair.
Meanwhile, the Florida White
House maintained silence Monday on
the developing Watergate investigation,
but President Nixon was depicted as
spending "a great deal of time" on it
during his Easter visit here.
Secret Fund
In other developments, The
Washington Star-News said the Nixon
campaign kept a secret cash fund of up
to $500,000 to use, at least in part, for
political spying and disruption. The
newspaper said the President's
personal lawyer, Herbert Kalmbach,
controlled the money.
And, in Washington, a lawyer for
President Nixon's re-election finance
committee turned over three more
cartons of documents to U.S. District
Court Monday.
Daniel Coon, a lawyer for the
Finance Committee to Re-elect the
President, said he was acting at the
behest of committee treasurer Paul
Barrick and had not known until
Saturday that there were more records
involved than those already turned
over to the court.
Coon said Barrick apparently was
under the "misunderstanding" that
only records pertaining to
contributions and income were wanted
and not disbursements.
