# 'Orestes': Fine Show
## 
### STU ALLEN 
The tragedy of Orestes, who
killed his mother after she
murdered his father, is being
played out again in the Little
Theater this week. The drama
department production is actually
a premiere of a play written more
than two thousand years ago, for
John Chioles has written a fresh
translation of Euripides'
masterpiece. If the Little Theater
isn't sold out for every show this
week, it should be; the show is
exceedingly effective.
As the play begins, one first
becomes aware of the cooperation
that Director John
Olon-Scrymgeour got from his
Scene Designer, Donnell Brendan
Walsh, his Lighting Designer,
Jeffrey Sultan, and his advisor for
the chorus, Michael Hackett. The
set consists of pieces of palace
suspended above the stage, and
which have a surface quality much
like fine marble. With a large
mirror above one half of the stage
to represent the sky, the scene is
very imaginative; and John Olon
uses its potentialities extensively,
sending the action into all corners
of the set.
Even a play with excellent
designing could not succeed
without fine acting, and it is two
actors and two actresses that
make "Orestes" a show to see.
Eric Booth Miller plays Orestes
with enthusiasm and grace.
Smooth Portrayal
The portrayal of the leading
character is smooth and
well-thought-out, which is an
achievement because Orestes is a
split character. He will try to
prove that black is white and
white black and he is innocent,
but then he will turn around and
cry that the Gods have laid such
guilt on him. Without Miller's
energetic and original
interpretation, one could easily
dislike Orestes.
Electra, sister of Orestes, is
played by Carolyn Gillespie, who
raises what is actually a rather flat
part to an interesting level. Electra
is a bitter woman, and in the
hands of a lesser actress, could be
boringly so. In the new
production, Electra and Orestes
have a relationship quite
suggestive of incest, and it all gets
quite interesting when it turns out
that Orestes has an equally
suggestive relationship with his
best friend Pylades, played by
Peter Moore.
This note should explain that
"Orestes" is not a hyper-serious
show that pretends to offer the
wisdom of the ancients. It is a
lively show that brings one to
laugh at the same time it has an
earnest social commentary.
Peter Moore as Pylades is like a

rooster, and all the exaggeration
sits well with him. Intensely,
insensitively cocky, his speeches
about the joys of a "good friend"
become quite humorous. The
second actress that helps the show
sparkle is Suzanne Bales as
Corypheus, the Chorus Leader.
The chorus is far more involved
in the action in this show than
one would customarily expect
from Greek tragedy, and this
involvement is carefully
orchestrated to flit in and out of

what we call reality.
Euripides wrote "Orestes" to
decry the religious slavery of the
Greeks, and to emphasize the
ludicrousness of their willingness
to blame all on the Gods. The
ending of the play, in which
Apollo intervenes to alter the
course of the human events, is just
sop to the Greek audiences, and
John Olon quite rightfully makes
it into a ridiculous finale. His
show has balance, and it moves
quickly. See and enjoy this one.
