You are now reading the first
in a series of semi-regular
entertainment columns featuring
reviews of some current
pornographic films in San
Francisco. Call these films
"underground," "stags," or "art
films," they represent a form of
cinematic entertainment
occasionally viewed by certain
elements of the Stanford
community.
Though the general reader can
follow these columns along to get
a feel for the latest trends in the
porn scene, it is for the potential
viewers' benefit that the reviews
appear. From now on, viewers,
you need not go up to the City
unprepared or half-cocked: check
the review first, see what the
movie has to offer, then make an
intelligent choice between the
many films available.
Most of the films reviewed
should be currently playing; those
no longer being screened will very
likely return to another theater in
the near future, so you may want
to clip out and save these
columns. Enough of such
introductions: let us proceed
onward and upward to the first
set of reviews, which I dedicate to
my wonderful friends and hosts,
the members of Delta Tau Delta
Fraternity.
Pre "y
"IT HAPPENED IN
HOLLYWOOD" - Three hours of
films I sit through, and the one

that gets the highest rating is the
five minute preview of coming
attractions! Billing itself as "a
pornographic Laugh-In," "It
Happened In Hollywood" is a
bawdy and merry satire of the
film industry. Contained in this
fast-paced preview were such
scenes as love on a trapeze, an
egg-laying heroine, and an
academy award trophy that must
be obscene to be believed. To top
it all off, the special effects
presented make this one film we
shouldn't want to miss.
Over-Exposed
"COUSIN PAULINE" - This
film receives the second highest
rating for its Continental touch
(filmed entirely in Paris), and the
beauty of its actresses. The scene
opens with a sequence of rooftop
shots of the French capital and
some lively background music.
The plot concerns rich and
depraved Pauline, who along with
her husband and her manservant,
Peter, plan to bring Pauline's
innocent young cousin, Jennifer
to the city for fun and games.
There's only one catch: Jennifer
has a boyfriend, and in a tender
scene, we are let in on the secret
of their pure relationship —
Jennifer observes an
approach-avoidance technique to
lovemaking that is stimulating yet
ultimately unrewarding to her
boyfriend.
They travel to Paris seeking a
change of pace, unsuspecting of

the plans Pauline has for
manipulating them. The first night
of their stay, Pauline secretly
seduces Jennifer's boyfriend, then
retires to plan for the next day.
Morning features a long walk
through Paris for the refreshingly
lovely Jennifer and her beau. The
camera lingers upon the upthrust
structure of the Eiffel Tower, in
an attempt to reveal the symbolic
meaning behind Springtime in
Gay Paree.
That night, the boyfriend is
drugged unconscious, and Jennifer
made so groggy as to be helpless,
while cousin Pauline and Peter
have a go at her. Pauline's
husband roves around the bed
with a Nikon, snapping away for
blackmail purposes. Many groans
later, the scene shifts to the
kitchen. It is morning, and as
Pauline gloats over her cousin's
newfound "education," her
husband surprises everyone with
the statement, "You're filthy rich,
Pauline, but you're also terribly
sick. I mean to get you committed
and get the money, and for
insurance against you trying
anything, I've got these!"
In this turn-about ending, he
reveals photos of Pauline's
encounter with Jennifer's
boyfriend, and laughs his way into
the credits. Overall it was an
entertaining film except for two
minor problems: the dialogue was
almost entirely unintelligible and

Peter desperately needed
orthodontal work.
Bird In Hand
The elongated caption is "A
Bird In The Hand is Worth Two in
the Bush."
"THE INNOCENT COUPLE" -
A true
third-rater, this flick features a
simplistic plot, totally
unredeeming dialogue, some
bizarre props, and three fat
women. After 55 minutes of
viewing, I gathered that a certain
Mr. Barnes was hot for his
neighbor's shy, young wife, so he
arranges a masquerade party for
six people (Barnes, his wife, the
neighbors, and another couple).
All sorts of combinations are
tried out, with Barnes finally
getting what he was after. His wife
prepares for the party by shaving
in the morning, donning some
skimpy leather attire and a Long
Ranger mask, and buying a box of
long, allergy-provoking feather
dusters.
Some choice lines of dialogue
include, "Oh boy look at that!,"
"Now you're going to get it,"and
"Oh my God — it's my wife!" For
all you wrist fetishists, don't
bother seeing this one — Barnes
wears a watch the whole time.
