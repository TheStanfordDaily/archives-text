# SF Symphony
## Excellent 'Requiem' Performance 
### BRUCE LAMOTT 
Seiji Ozawa directed an
awesome performance of the
Verdi Requiem with the San
Francisco Symphony and soloists
Martina Arroyo, Maureen
Forrester, Placido Domingo, and
Martti Talvela in the Opera House
Wednesday night, April 18. The
concert also marked the debut of
the professional Symphony
Chorus, directed by Joseph
Liebling.
The Requiem, begun in
memoriam to Rossini but
completed in commemoration of
the death of Alessandro Manzoni,
traverses the provinces of liturgy
and operatic drama. And through
his thorough perception of these
seemingly divergent influences,
Ozawa sketched a sensitive
portrait of Verdian piety.
The chorus establishes the
liturgical setting in the intoned
Requiem aeternam and the a
capella Te decet, joined by the
quartet for a sumptuous but
restrained Kyrie. Suddenly all hell
breaks loose (literally) in the
demonic Dies irae which recurs,
rondo-like, four times within the
work. Only in retrospect did the
listener appreciate how carefully
the conductor prepared for this
moment.
Bracing himself against the
fury of the Dies irae with
monumental stance, Ozawa
unleashed an impressive ensemble
of mature, energetic voices and
full orchestral sonority. More than
an orgy of bombast, the tight
rhythmic precision made a
statement of incredible impact.
Foremost among the
distinguished soloists, tenor
Placido Domingo sang the
aria-hymn Qui Mariam absolvisti
with appropriate Italian operatic
passion, yet later in the Hostias
adopted an etheral quality
transcendent of the theater. His
voice is clear and unabrasive,

demonstrating musical beauty
more than force.
Soprano Martina Arroyo
reached her heights in the Libera
me, changing character from the
subdued intonation of the
plaintive Requiem aeternam to
the desperate pleading of
deliverance from eternal death.
Her voice is powerful and
assertive, though sometimes
jeopardizing intonation in favor of
strength.
Likewise Conralto Maureen
Forrester tends to 'test' her notes
before letting their dark sonority
develop, resulting in a consistent
slide into pitch. For both women,
this tendency was less detrimental
in their solo passages, but caused
some slippery intonation in
ensembles, particularly the Pie
Jesu. Nonetheless the limitless
depth of Miss Forrester's voice
was the perfect vehicle for the
foreboding Liber scriptus and the

expressive void of Nil inultum.
Though as capable vocally as
the rest of the quartet, Bass Martti
Talvela seemed ill at ease with the
score, and sang with the dramatic
intensity of an apprehensive
chorister. His tone is satisfyingly
profound, but his interpretation
lacked the characteristic warmth
and passion of his colleagues,
perhaps the demonstration of
Scandinavian piety. His priestly
reserve was appropriate to Mors
stupebit, but separated him from
the ensembles.
Though Stanford students
privileged to have sung under
Maestro Ozawa will regret the
appearance of a professional
symphony chorus, we must
grudgingly admit that he is
worthy of such a force. The
intensity of these trained voices,
precise diction, and rhythmic
flexibility and control — which
faltered only briefly in the

Sanctus — made them a fitting
complement to the high
professional expectations of this
performance.
The orchestral was superb,
particularly in the brass and
tympani. Tuba mirum featured
antiphonal trumpets in Aida-like
grandeur. Not only is the San
Francisco Symphony a formidable
orchestra ensemble in its own
right, it is a splendid
accompanying instrument,
reaching a sensitive parlance with
soloists and chorus.
Ozawa's triumph in
undertaking this work resulted
from taking Verdi at his word,
neither underplaying the very real
dramatic conception which leads
him to the spectacular and the
sentimental, nor ignoring the
liturgical reference and public loss
which occasioned the Requiem.
