# Laxmen Win Twice, Face Cal Tomorrow
## 
### MARK WHITE 
After posting a come from
behind 8-6 victory over Oakland
Lacrosse Club Saturday and a 7-4
win over Oregon Sunday,
Stanford's lacrosse team takes on
the Cal Bears tomorrow at 1 p.m.
in Berkeley in one of the most
important contests of the season.
Currently 6-3 overall and 2-1 in
their league, the Cards almost
have to win Wednesday's league
contest to stay in title contention.
And since they lost 10-8 to the
Bears on April 8 the Cards will
have to win by at least three goals
tomorrow in order to claim the
coveted Broken Stick Award
which goes to the series victor
each year.
"If we can continue to swarm
as we have in the last four games,
we should win" claimed coach
Peter Schneider. "We looked
awful — we didn't do anything
right against Oakland in the first
quarter Saturday, but we came
back and dominated them the
final two and a half quarters. If
we can repeat those last two and a
half quarters against Cal, we'll
win."
As they have from time to
time, the Cards opened cold
against Oakland and only got off

nine shots in the first half while
the visitors controlled the game
and took a 5-1 lead midway in the
second quarter.
The second half was Oakland's
undoing as the Cardinals took
command of the game, holding
Oakland to a single goal in the
half. Steadily wearing down the
Oakland defense with 22 shots in
the third quarter and 20 in the
fourth, Stanford scored four times
in the third and twice in the fourth to
win 8-6. Buz Haddow and Butch
Hazlett paced the Cards with two
goals apiece.
Haddow and Hazlett once
again led the scoring in Sunday's
7-4 victory over Oregon with two
more goals apiece. Oregon broke
on top with a goal three minutes
into the game as several of the
Cards were still reeling from
Saturday night's victory
celebration.
Goals by Haddow and Steve
Taylor gave the Cards a lead they
never relinquished in the second
period as the contest settled into a
tight defensive struggle marked by
several near-goals and good
goaltending. In the end the Cards
scored just enough to post their
sixth victory of the season, 7-4.

the third quarter and 20 in the
fourth, Stanford scored four times
in the third and twice in the fourth to
win 8-6. Buz Haddow and Butch
Hazlett paced the Cards with two
goals apiece.
Haddow and Hazlett once
again led the scoring in Sunday's
7-4 victory over Oregon with two
more goals apiece. Oregon broke
on top with a goal three minutes
into the game as several of the
Cards were still reeling from
Saturday night's victory
celebration.
Goals by Haddow and Steve
Taylor gave the Cards a lead they
never relinquished in the second
period as the contest settled into a
tight defensive struggle marked by
several near-goals and good
goaltending. In the end the Cards
scored just enough to post their
sixth victory of the season, 7-4.

STANDOFF IN ROUND TWO—Chip Fisher won both of his singles
matches this weekend as Stanford defeated UCLA and USC, ending
round two in the battle for national tennis supremacy in a draw.
Stanford won round one by capturing the National Indoor title at
Madison, Wise, but round two is a standoff after the Cards split their
dual matches against the Bruins and the Trojans. Round three begins
Thursday at the Ojai Intercollegiates.
After posting a come from
behind 8-6 victory over Oakland
Lacrosse Club Saturday and a 7-4
win over Oregon Sunday,
Stanford's lacrosse team takes on
the Cal Bears tomorrow at 1 p.m.
in Berkeley in one of the most
important contests of the season.
Currently 6-3 overall and 2-1 in
their league, the Cards almost
have to win Wednesday's league
contest to stay in title contention.
And since they lost 10-8 to the
Bears on April 8 the Cards will
have to win by at least three goals
tomorrow in order to claim the
coveted Broken Stick Award
which goes to the series victor
each year.
"If we can continue to swarm
as we have in the last four games,
we should win" claimed coach
Peter Schneider. "We looked
awful — we didn't do anything
right against Oakland in the first
quarter Saturday, but we came
back and dominated them the
final two and a half quarters. If
we can repeat those last two and a
half quarters against Cal, we'll
win."
As they have from time to
time, the Cards opened cold
against Oakland and only got off

nine shots in the first half while
the visitors controlled the game
and took a 5-1 lead midway in the
second quarter.
The second half was Oakland's
undoing as the Cardinals took
command of the game, holding
Oakland to a single goal in the
half. Steadily wearing down the
Oakland defense with 22 shots in
the third quarter and 20 in the
fourth, Stanford scored four times
in the third and twice in the fourth to
win 8-6. Buz Haddow and Butch
Hazlett paced the Cards with two
goals apiece.
