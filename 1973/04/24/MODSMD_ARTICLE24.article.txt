# Singles Victories Spark Stanford Tennis Sweep
## 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
Winning 10 of a possible 12
singles matches, Stanford's tennis
team avenged earlier defeats to
UCLA and USC by beating the
Bruins 7-2 and the Trojans 5-4
over the weekend.
Over 1200 Stanford fans sat,
stood, climbed bushes, and peered
through fences around the varsity
courts each day to witness the
triumphs over the only two
schools in the nation with a
reasonable chance to stop
Stanford in its drive for the
NCAA championship.
The Cardinals proved their
mettle in the clutch by capturing
eight of 11 tiebreakers in the
matches. Third singles player Rick
set the tone by winning
three tiebreakers en route to his
two singles victories.
Below Rick in the Stanford
order, Pat DuPre, Chip Fisher, and
John Whitlinger also all won both
their singles matches, thus
showing the wisdom of Coach
Dick Gould's lineup reshuffling.
Against UCLA Friday, the only
players who had trouble were
Stanford's top stars, Sandy Mayer

and Jim Delaney. UCLA wisely
moved its Number Two player,
Bob Kreiss, up to play Mayer in
the featured match, and Kreiss
responded by playing the guttiest
tennis of his life, finally losing
only 6-4, 0-6, 7-6, to a much
better opponent.
No Love Lost
Meanwhile, Jeff Austin, usually
UCLA's top man, had little
trouble with Delaney, downing
him >7-6, 6-2 in a hard-fought
match with no love lost between
the competitors.
Mayer and Delaney, an
inexperienced doubles team, did
put up a strong fight against
Austin and Kreiss, but UCLA's
Afro-haired duo finally won 3-6,
6-4, 6-3.
Elsewhere it was all smiles for
the Cards, now 13-2 for the
season. Rick Fisher outgutted
Steve Krulevitz 7-6, 7-6 and took
a 2-1 season's edge on the UCLA
star in the continuing saga of two
of the most evenly-matched
players in the U.S.
Pat DuPre proved conclusively
that the fourth singles slot belongs
to him as he downed Ray no

Seegers 6-4, 6-2. Since only four
singles players for each team are
allowed in the NCAAs, DuPre's
great play solves what could have
been a major Cardinal problem.
Fisher, Whitlinger Win
Chip Fisher chipped in with
great net play to down Brian
Teacher, 6-3, 6-2, while John
Whitlinger, despite spending
almost as much time on his back
as on his feet, slipped by Spencer
Segura 7-6, 6-7, 6-4.
Stanford also won at both
second and third doubles, as the
teams of Rick Fisher and Gery
Groslimond and Whitlinger and
Chip Fisher both came through
with three-set wins.
Saturday, both these teams, as
well as the Delaney-Mayer team,
lost, disappointing Gould. "I feel
we should've beaten them at two
and three [doubles] and didn't.
This time we got away with it but
we won't be able to at the
Pac-B's," Gould said.
Stanford did get away with
dropping all three doubles
matches to USC only because the
Cards won five of six singles
matches duplicating their feat of
the previous day.
Mayer Loses
The only defeat was by Mayer,
who dropped a hard three-setter
to Raul Ramirez, 7-6, 2-6, 6-4.
The cool Mexican star, whose deft
play was appreciated by the fair
(though partial) Stanford fans, has
now downed Mayer twice in a
row.
"Sandy's not razor-sharp yet,"
Gould said, "but I haven't lost
any confidence in him. The key
for him is not to press. He's got to
be ready for the NCAAs and he
will be," Gould added
definitively.
At second singles, Delaney
rebounded from the previous
day's defeat by destroying India's
Sashi Menon, 6-2, 6-3.
Rick Fisher once again came
up with a clutch victory, coming
from behind to beat John
Andrews (a higher-ranked player)
4-6, 7-6, 6-4.
• DuPre once again beat strong
competition, this time downing
Mike Machette 7-6, 6-4, while
Chip Fisher also won again,
beating John Holladay 6-4, 6-4.
Gould singled out Chip's play
as "outstanding for a player who's
never gone against USC or UCLA
before."
At the sixth singles position,
Whitlinger's superb ground strokes
annihilated England's Mike
Wayman, 6-2, 6-4.
Thus, Stanford has completed
its section of Round Two in its
battle for the national crown. The
round has ended in a standoff,
with Stanford beating each Los
Angeles school once and losing to
each once.

only 6-4, 0-6, 7-6, to a much
better opponent.
No Love Lost
Meanwhile, Jeff Austin, usually
UCLA's top man, had little
trouble with Delaney, downing
him >7-6, 6-2 in a hard-fought
match with no love lost between
the competitors.
Mayer and Delaney, an
inexperienced doubles team, did
put up a strong fight against
Austin and Kreiss, but UCLA's
Afro-haired duo finally won 3-6,
6-4, 6-3.
Elsewhere it was all smiles for
the Cards, now 13-2 for the
season. Rick Fisher outgutted
Steve Krulevitz 7-6, 7-6 and took
a 2-1 season's edge on the UCLA
star in the continuing saga of two
of the most evenly-matched
players in the U.S.
Pat DuPre proved conclusively
that the fourth singles slot belongs
to him as he downed Ray no

Seegers 6-4, 6-2. Since only four
singles players for each team are
allowed in the NCAAs, DuPre's
great play solves what could have
been a major Cardinal problem.
Fisher, Whitlinger Win
Chip Fisher chipped in with
great net play to down Brian
Teacher, 6-3, 6-2, while John
Whitlinger, despite spending
almost as much time on his back
as on his feet, slipped by Spencer
Segura 7-6, 6-7, 6-4.
Stanford also won at both
second and third doubles, as the
teams of Rick Fisher and Gery
Groslimond and Whitlinger and
Chip Fisher both came through
with three-set wins.
Saturday, both these teams, as
well as the Delaney-Mayer team,
lost, disappointing Gould. "I feel
we should've beaten them at two
and three [doubles] and didn't.
This time we got away with it but
we won't be able to at the
Pac-B's," Gould said.
Stanford did get away with
dropping all three doubles
matches to USC only because the
Cards won five of six singles
matches duplicating their feat of
the previous day.
Mayer Loses
The only defeat was by Mayer,
who dropped a hard three-setter
to Raul Ramirez, 7-6, 2-6, 6-4.
The cool Mexican star, whose deft
play was appreciated by the fair
(though partial) Stanford fans, has
now downed Mayer twice in a
row.
"Sandy's not razor-sharp yet,"
Gould said, "but I haven't lost
any confidence in him. The key
for him is not to press. He's got to
be ready for the NCAAs and he
will be," Gould added
definitively.
At second singles, Delaney
rebounded from the previous
day's defeat by destroying India's
Sashi Menon, 6-2, 6-3.
Rick Fisher once again came
up with a clutch victory, coming
from behind to beat John
Andrews (a higher-ranked player)
4-6, 7-6, 6-4.
• DuPre once again beat strong
competition, this time downing
Mike Machette 7-6, 6-4, while
Chip Fisher also won again,
beating John Holladay 6-4, 6-4.
Gould singled out Chip's play
as "outstanding for a player who's
never gone against USC or UCLA
before."
At the sixth singles position,
Whitlinger's superb ground strokes
annihilated England's Mike
Wayman, 6-2, 6-4.
Thus, Stanford has completed
its section of Round Two in its
battle for the national crown. The
round has ended in a standoff,
with Stanford beating each Los
Angeles school once and losing to
each once.
Winning 10 of a possible 12
singles matches, Stanford's tennis
team avenged earlier defeats to
UCLA and USC by beating the
Bruins 7-2 and the Trojans 5-4
over the weekend.
Over 1200 Stanford fans sat,
stood, climbed bushes, and peered
through fences around the varsity
courts each day to witness the
triumphs over the only two
schools in the nation with a
reasonable chance to stop
Stanford in its drive for the
NCAA championship.
The Cardinals proved their
mettle in the clutch by capturing
eight of 11 tiebreakers in the
matches. Third singles player Rick
set the tone by winning
three tiebreakers en route to his
two singles victories.
Below Rick in the Stanford
order, Pat DuPre, Chip Fisher, and
John Whitlinger also all won both
their singles matches, thus
showing the wisdom of Coach
Dick Gould's lineup reshuffling.
Against UCLA Friday, the only
players who had trouble were
Stanford's top stars, Sandy Mayer

and Jim Delaney. UCLA wisely
moved its Number Two player,
Bob Kreiss, up to play Mayer in
the featured match, and Kreiss
responded by playing the guttiest
tennis of his life, finally losing
only 6-4, 0-6, 7-6, to a much
better opponent.

great net play to down Brian
Teacher, 6-3, 6-2, while John
Whitlinger, despite spending
almost as much time on his back
as on his feet, slipped by Spencer
Segura 7-6, 6-7, 6-4.
Stanford also won at both
second and third doubles, as the
teams of Rick Fisher and Gery
Groslimond and Whitlinger and
Chip Fisher both came through
with three-set wins.
Saturday, both these teams, as
well as the Delaney-Mayer team,
lost, disappointing Gould. "I feel
we should've beaten them at two
and three [doubles] and didn't.
This time we got away with it but
we won't be able to at the
Pac-B's," Gould said.
Stanford did get away with
dropping all three doubles
matches to USC only because the
Cards won five of six singles
matches duplicating their feat of
the previous day.
Mayer Loses
The only defeat was by Mayer,
who dropped a hard three-setter
to Raul Ramirez, 7-6, 2-6, 6-4.
The cool Mexican star, whose deft
play was appreciated by the fair
(though partial) Stanford fans, has
now downed Mayer twice in a
row.
"Sandy's not razor-sharp yet,"
Gould said, "but I haven't lost
any confidence in him. The key
for him is not to press. He's got to
be ready for the NCAAs and he
will be," Gould added
definitively.
At second singles, Delaney
rebounded from the previous
day's defeat by destroying India's
Sashi Menon, 6-2, 6-3.
Rick Fisher once again came
up with a clutch victory, coming
from behind to beat John
Andrews (a higher-ranked player)
4-6, 7-6, 6-4.
• DuPre once again beat strong
competition, this time downing
Mike Machette 7-6, 6-4, while
Chip Fisher also won again,
beating John Holladay 6-4, 6-4.
Gould singled out Chip's play
as "outstanding for a player who's
never gone against USC or UCLA
before."
At the sixth singles position,
Whitlinger's superb ground strokes
annihilated England's Mike
Wayman, 6-2, 6-4.
Thus, Stanford has completed
its section of Round Two in its
battle for the national crown. The
round has ended in a standoff,
with Stanford beating each Los
Angeles school once and losing to
each once.
Winning 10 of a possible 12
singles matches, Stanford's tennis
team avenged earlier defeats to
UCLA and USC by beating the
Bruins 7-2 and the Trojans 5-4
over the weekend.
Over 1200 Stanford fans sat,
stood, climbed bushes, and peered
through fences around the varsity
courts each day to witness the
triumphs over the only two
schools in the nation with a
reasonable chance to stop
Stanford in its drive for the
NCAA championship.
The Cardinals proved their
mettle in the clutch by capturing
eight of 11 tiebreakers in the
matches. Third singles player Rick
set the tone by winning
three tiebreakers en route to his
two singles victories.
Below Rick in the Stanford
order, Pat DuPre, Chip Fisher, and
John Whitlinger also all won both
their singles matches, thus
showing the wisdom of Coach
Dick Gould's lineup reshuffling.
Against UCLA Friday, the only
players who had trouble were
Stanford's top stars, Sandy Mayer

and Jim Delaney. UCLA wisely
moved its Number Two player,
Bob Kreiss, up to play Mayer in
the featured match, and Kreiss
responded by playing the guttiest
tennis of his life, finally losing
only 6-4, 0-6, 7-6, to a much
better opponent.
No Love Lost
Meanwhile, Jeff Austin, usually
UCLA's top man, had little
trouble with Delaney, downing
him >7-6, 6-2 in a hard-fought
match with no love lost between
the competitors.
Mayer and Delaney, an
inexperienced doubles team, did
put up a strong fight against
Austin and Kreiss, but UCLA's
Afro-haired duo finally won 3-6,
6-4, 6-3.
Elsewhere it was all smiles for
the Cards, now 13-2 for the
season. Rick Fisher outgutted
Steve Krulevitz 7-6, 7-6 and took
a 2-1 season's edge on the UCLA
star in the continuing saga of two
of the most evenly-matched
players in the U.S.
Pat DuPre proved conclusively
that the fourth singles slot belongs
to him as he downed Ray no

Seegers 6-4, 6-2. Since only four
singles players for each team are
allowed in the NCAAs, DuPre's
great play solves what could have
been a major Cardinal problem.
