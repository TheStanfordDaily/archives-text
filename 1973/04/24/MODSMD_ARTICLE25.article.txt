# Three Game Series Against Cal
## Puzzling Cards Drop Two 
### GLENN GARVIN 
"This team has been a great
puzzlement to me," baseball
Coach Ray Young mused
yesterday morning as he talked
about last weekend's games
against Cal.
"All through the league play,
we've had fine pitching and no
hitting. This weekend we finally
did some hitting and the pitching
was all gone," he said in a slightly
exasperated tone.
It is no big surprise that Young
is exasperated. This spring he
expected the Card ballclub to be a
major threat to Southern
California for the Pacific Eight
crown; now, halfway through the
Pac-8 season, his team sits in the
cellar with a 3-6 record.
"We have played right to the
level of competition. We aren't a
team with peaks and levels, we're
a team with peaks and valleys.
We're way up for one game and
way down for the next," Young
said sadly.
The Cards took a trip through
their latest valley this weekend
against Cal, dropping two out of
three to a team with a 1-5 league
mark and 14-19 overall record.
They try to get back into the win
column this afternoon with a
game at Cal State-Hay ward.
No Pitching
Stanford blew the Berkeley
series because, as Young said, the
pitching suddenly failed. A
pitching staff with a 1.62 league

ERA gave up 20 runs in three
games.
A series of flukes cost the
Cards Friday's game, 4-1. Cal
opened the scoring in the second
when catcher Steve Bartkowski
hit a fly to deep center and
freshman Bruce Robinson fell
dowrj chasing it. Bartkowski
tripled and scored a moment later
on a sacrifice by third baseman
Don Thomas.
In the fifth, three Bear singles
loaded the bases, but it seemed
pitcher Dan Shaw had dampened
the rally by picking a man off
second. He tried to pick another
runner off third, however, and a
run scored when the throw was
wild. The last two Cal runs scored
in the seventh when second
baseman Nick Tulk pulled a triple
down the rightfield line, so close
that it actually kicked up chalk
dust.
The Cards rallied in the eighth
when pinch-hitters Ed Orrizzi and
Glen Johnson walked. Shortstop
A 1 O'Brien singled in one run, but
Johnson was thrown out when he
hesitated rounding second base.
"That turned the game around,"
Young observed later. A last rally
in the ninth died when, with the
bases loaded, pinch-hitter A 1
Arthur struck out.
Slugfest
Stanford won the first game of
Saturday's doubleheader, a 12-10
slugfest. The Cards notched eight
runs in the second inning when

Cal pitcher Ike Eichelberger lost
his control and gave up four
walks, three singles, and a double
to Mark Lucich. Cal got four runs
in the bottom of the inning, and
racked three pitchers, including
ace Bob DiPietro, for 10 hits, but
the Cards hung on for the win.
It looked like Stanford might
sweep both games when the Cards
led 4-3 in the seventh inning of
the second contest. But Ken
Grolle walked one Cal batter and
then Bartkowski unloaded his
seventh home run of the season,
one short of the Berkeley record
set 20 years ago by Jackie Jensen.
The winning run scored later in
the inning on an error by Bob
Reece.
Stanford again rallied in the
ninth. Dave Baker singled in one
run, and pinch-hitters Robinson
and Orrizzi walked, but O'Brien
grounded out to end the game.
Young, despite his
disappointment, isn't planning
any major changes for this
weekend's series with USC in Los
Angeles. "I'm going to go with
basically the same team that
started the season a couple of
months ago," he told the Daily.
"They have an obligation, if that's
the word, to get us out of
whatever situation we're in, since
they got us there."

Stanford again rallied in the
ninth. Dave Baker singled in one
run, and pinch-hitters Robinson
and Orrizzi walked, but O'Brien
grounded out to end the game.
Young, despite his
disappointment, isn't planning
any major changes for this
weekend's series with USC in Los
Angeles. "I'm going to go with
basically the same team that
started the season a couple of
months ago," he told the Daily.
"They have an obligation, if that's
the word, to get us out of
whatever situation we're in, since
they got us there."
"This team has been a great
puzzlement to me," baseball
Coach Ray Young mused
yesterday morning as he talked
about last weekend's games
against Cal.
"All through the league play,
we've had fine pitching and no
hitting. This weekend we finally
did some hitting and the pitching
was all gone," he said in a slightly
exasperated tone.
It is no big surprise that Young
is exasperated. This spring he
expected the Card ballclub to be a
major threat to Southern
California for the Pacific Eight
crown; now, halfway through the
Pac-8 season, his team sits in the
cellar with a 3-6 record.
"We have played right to the
level of competition. We aren't a
team with peaks and levels, we're
a team with peaks and valleys.
We're way up for one game and
way down for the next," Young
said sadly.
The Cards took a trip through
their latest valley this weekend
against Cal, dropping two out of
three to a team with a 1-5 league
mark and 14-19 overall record.
They try to get back into the win
column this afternoon with a
game at Cal State-Hay ward.
No Pitching
Stanford blew the Berkeley
series because, as Young said, the
pitching suddenly failed. A
pitching staff with a 1.62 league

ERA gave up 20 runs in three
games.
A series of flukes cost the
Cards Friday's game, 4-1. Cal
opened the scoring in the second
when catcher Steve Bartkowski
hit a fly to deep center and
freshman Bruce Robinson fell
dowrj chasing it. Bartkowski
tripled and scored a moment later
on a sacrifice by third baseman
Don Thomas.
In the fifth, three Bear singles
loaded the bases, but it seemed
pitcher Dan Shaw had dampened
the rally by picking a man off
second. He tried to pick another
runner off third, however, and a
run scored when the throw was
wild. The last two Cal runs scored
in the seventh when second
baseman Nick Tulk pulled a triple
down the rightfield line, so close
that it actually kicked up chalk
dust.
The Cards rallied in the eighth
when pinch-hitters Ed Orrizzi and
Glen Johnson walked. Shortstop
A 1 O'Brien singled in one run, but
Johnson was thrown out when he
hesitated rounding second base.
"That turned the game around,"
Young observed later. A last rally
in the ninth died when, with the
bases loaded, pinch-hitter A 1
Arthur struck out.
Slugfest
Stanford won the first game of
Saturday's doubleheader, a 12-10
slugfest. The Cards notched eight
runs in the second inning when

Cal pitcher Ike Eichelberger lost
his control and gave up four
walks, three singles, and a double
to Mark Lucich. Cal got four runs
in the bottom of the inning, and
racked three pitchers, including
ace Bob DiPietro, for 10 hits, but
the Cards hung on for the win.
It looked like Stanford might
sweep both games when the Cards
led 4-3 in the seventh inning of
the second contest. But Ken
Grolle walked one Cal batter and
then Bartkowski unloaded his
seventh home run of the season,
one short of the Berkeley record
set 20 years ago by Jackie Jensen.
The winning run scored later in
the inning on an error by Bob
Reece.
Stanford again rallied in the
ninth. Dave Baker singled in one
run, and pinch-hitters Robinson
and Orrizzi walked, but O'Brien
grounded out to end the game.
