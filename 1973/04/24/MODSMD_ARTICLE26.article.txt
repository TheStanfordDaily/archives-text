# Stanford Sailors Win At UC Davis Regatta
## 
### TOM WINOKUR 
The Stanford sailing team
continued its late season surge at
UC Davis Saturday, dominating
the competition with several
single race firsts and a first overall
in the last regatta of the regular
season.
The victory culminated a two
week drive that saw Stanford
climb all the way from seventh
place to fourth in the Northern
California Intercollegiate Yacht
Racing Association standings.
Lake Washington provided
perfect conditions for the regatta
and Stanford sailors provided
excellent sailing for the lone
spectator that accompanied the
team to Davis. Skipper Susy
Salisbury and her crew Craig
Daniels dominated the "B"
division with a first, second, and
sixth.

Bill Ridge, returning after an
absence of two quarters, took a
first and two thirds in the "A"
division. The resulting score
provided a fairly comfortable
winning margin of four points
over runnerup San Jose State.
Another encouraging feature of
the weekend was the performance
of a new boat that Stanford sailed
unofficially at Davis. The boat
was designed by Stanford sailors
over the past several years and the
mold was also a home product.
The boat was designed to be
used on Lake Laguinta but the
design is so comfortable and the
hull so light that it may, with
some work, be the fastest Flying
Junior made in the U.S. The
Sailing Association is hoping to
sell some in the near future to
provide revenue for their ov n
fleet.
