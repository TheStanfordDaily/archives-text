# Western Intercollegiates
## Cards Sixth In Golf Tourney 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
SANTA CRUZ — A strong final
round performance helped
Stanford regain some
respectability Friday, as the Cards
finished sixth in a strong 26 team
field at the Western Intercollegiate
golf tournament.
Battling heavy winds all day,
Aly Trompas shot a three over par
74, and Dave Baskins and Denny
Colvin each added 75's, moving

Stanford up four spots from the
10th place slot the Cards occupied
after 36 holes.
USC won the tournament with
an 897 total, followed by Brigham
Young, Long Beach State, Fresno
State, Arizona State, and
Stanford. The Cards' 54 hole
score was 922.
Most of the talk around
Pasatiempo golf course Friday
didn't concern team champion
USC or individual winner Don
Baker of the Trojans. Instead
most of the golfers and coaches
were talking about the windswept
Pasatiempo course, which yielded
only one subpar round during the
three days of the tournament.
"I think the wind really got to
everybody," said Stanford coach
Bud Finger. "This is certainly a
tough golf course but I think the
scores were high mainly because
of the abnormal conditions."
Still Finger wasn't too
disappointed with his team's
performance. "We played well the
last 18 holes," he said. "We
haven't been playing well the last
few weeks, but this proves we're
still one of the top teams in the
Western states."
Finger's statement can be
easily justified, since the 27th
annual Western Intercollegiates
included every one of the top golf
teams west of the Rockies. Five of
the teams (including Stanford)
have been ranked in the nation's
top 10 at least once this year.
The individual field was
equally outstanding. Baker played
consistent golf throughout the
tournament, firing rounds of
73-72-72 for a four over par 217
total, one stroke ahead of Bob
Harris of Brigham Young and
Long Beach State's Beau Baugh,
the older brother of 1971 U.S.
Women's Amateur champion
Laura Baugh. Arizona State's Tom
Purtzer was fourth at 219 and
defending Pac-8 champion Craig
Griswold of Oregon rounded out
the top five with a 221 total.
Colvin was Stanford's highest

individual finisher, placing 13th
on rounds of 76-75-75 for a 226
total. Colvin had a chance to
finish well into the top 10, but
shot 40 on the back nine Friday
after playing the front nine in one
under par 35.
Trompas and Baskins were
next for the Cards, both with 230
totals. Trompas finished with two
consecutive 74's after opening
with an 82 while Baskins shot
76-79-75. The other Cardinal
scores were: Conrad Nilmeier
(78-77-81, 236), George Pettinger
(79-87-76, 242), and Bob
Chapman (78-83-85, 246).

THE STEEPLECHASE — Runners from Stanford, USC, and California compete in the grueling 3000
meter steeplechase event Saturday during the double dual meet at Berkeley. Gunner Dalen of USC (far
left) came from behind to win the Stanford-USC event in 9:22.6. Stanford's Dick Day (second from left)
was second at 9:38.6 but the Cards' Kurt Schoenrock (third from left) was forced to drop out of the
event after three laps with a leg injury. Cal's Emerson Davis (right) recorded an impressive 9:16.2 clocking
but his victory didn't figure in the UCLA-Cal scoring.
