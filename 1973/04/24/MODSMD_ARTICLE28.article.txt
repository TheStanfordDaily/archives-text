A 60 yard scoring pass from
quarterback Mike Boryla to split
end Bill Singler highlighted a 40
minute controlled football
scrimmage Saturday on the
Stanford practice field.
Boryla quarterbacked the team
for two 10 minute periods and
upcoming sophomores Jeff
Siemens and Jerry Waldvogel each
took one 10 minute turn.
Christiansen was impressed with
the work of all three
quarterbacks, and especially liked
the Boryla-Singler passing
combination.
"Boryla threw the ball pretty
good and Singler made a couple of
good catches," Chris said. "And
good things went on on both sides
of the line."
Christiansen also said that he
thinks reserve quarterback Dave
OTtmar "will be ready when we
start fall practice." Ottmar
underwent knee surgery on
Tuesday and will wear a cast for
five or six weeks. Offensive tackle
Mark Ferguson and linebacker
Bob Hertenstein will undergo
knee surgery later this week.
Three more weeks of spring
practice are scheduled before the
annual Red-White scrimmage in
