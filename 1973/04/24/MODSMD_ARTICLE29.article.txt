# USC Edges Cards, 80-73
## Spikers Scare Powerful Trojans 
### PHIL HUBBARD 
The Stanford track team came
within one event of pulling the
upset of the season Saturday in a
dual meet against USC at
Berkeley. The Trojans led by only
two points, 75-73, going into the
mile relay. If the Cards had won
that event, they would have
beaten USC for the first time in
40 years.
The Trojans relay foursome
was too fast for the Cards to
handle, though, and the final
score was USC 80, Stanford 73. In
the other half of the double dual,
Cal was humiliated by UCLA,
114-31.
Despite the loss, Coach Payton
Jordan termed the meet, "the
greatest team effort" in his 17
years at Stanford.
The meet got off to a doubtful
start for the Cards when Kurt
Schoenrock, Stanford's leading
steeplechaser, was forced to drop
out of that event after the third
lap with a leg injury.
USC's team of Randy Williams,
Jerry Wilson, Ken Randle, and
Don Quarrie took the 440 relay
away from Stanford to the
surprise of no one. The Cards
picked up the pace in the next
event, the mile, with a 1-2 finish
by Brian Mittelstaedt and Les
McFadden. Mittelstaedt's time of
4:08.3 was excellent considering
he knew he had to run the
two-mile less than two hours later.
Trojans Take Hurdles
The Trojans took the points
right back, though, as Wilson and
Bob Coffman won the first two
places in the high hurdles. Dave
Bagshaw was third for the Cards
with a 14.4.
In the 440 that followed,
co-captain John Anderson pulled
an upset for the Cards. Letting
USC's sprinters set the pace in the
first half of the race, he
accelerated through the final 220
to grab the victory in 48.3.
Meanwhile in the field events,
frosh sensation Terry Albritton
continued his domination of the
shot put with a 58-8% victory.
Ralph Bakkensen had his best put
of the season in taking third at

52-3'/4.
Tom Anderson broke the
24-foot barrier for the first time
this year with a 24-3/4 leap,but
could still manage only second
behind Olympic gold medalist
Randy Williams' 24-8%.
Hopkins Wins Javelin
The javelin saw another
surprising 1-2 finish for the Cards.
Steve Hopkins won the event at
201-1 and Rick Larson was
second at 199-6. In the Cal-UCLA
half of the meet, Berkeley's Bruce
Kennedy set a new school and
meet record with his 259-8 toss.
The discus was the only sweep
of the meet for either team. Pete
Dreissigacker won the event for
the Cards at 164-10. Jim Howard
was second at 162-1 and Jim

Royer third at 160-8. Albritton
came over from the shot ring and
took fourth to further humiliate
the SC discus crew.
Rod Utley pulled out a
season's best 49-914 triple jump on
his last leap for an upset victory in
that event. Mel Ho picked up
another point for the Cards as he
took third with 45-8.
Kring Vaults 14-6
Ken Kring took a surprising
second in the pole vault at 14-6.
John Kwan, USC's 15-footer,
could manage only 14 for third.
Bob Pullard won the event for the
Trojans at 16-6.
Vernell Jackson was second in
the 880 with a 1:54.4 clocking.
Ken Curl picked up an impressive
double sprint victory in the 100

and 220. He held off USC's Ken
Randle in both races, winning the
first in 9.6 and the second in 21.3.
The high jump was dominated
by USC's Dean Owens and Jerry
Culp at 6-10. Tom Anderson took
third for Stanford at 6-4.
Mittelstaedt picked up his
second victory of the day in the
two-mile, with an impressive 8:51
clocking, less than a second slower
than his all-time best. The
nine-minute barrier continued to
elude freshman Tony Sandoval as
he took third in 9:01.
In the mile relay which decided
the meet, USC's squad ran 3:13.9
to Stanford's 3:16.5.

Saturday for the Mt. San Antonio

within one event of pulling the
upset of the season Saturday in a
dual meet against USC at
Berkeley. The Trojans led by only
two points, 75-73, going into the
mile relay. If the Cards had won
that event, they would have
beaten USC for the first time in
40 years.

was too fast for the Cards to
handle, though, and the final
score was USC 80, Stanford 73. In
the other half of the double dual,

114-31.
Despite the loss, Coach Payton

out of that event after the third
lap with a leg injury.

by Brian Mittelstaedt and Les
McFadden. Mittelstaedt's time of
4:08.3 was excellent considering
he knew he had to run the
two-mile less than two hours later.

right back, though, as Wilson and
Bob Coffman won the first two
places in the high hurdles. Dave
Bagshaw was third for the Cards
with a 14.4.

co-captain John Anderson pulled
an upset for the Cards. Letting
USC's sprinters set the pace in the
first half of the race, he

continued his domination of the
shot put with a 58-8% victory.
Ralph Bakkensen had his best put
