# Burts' Trial Begins; First Statements Made
## 
### TERRY ANZUR 
The trial of Andrea Holman Burt
and Benton Douglas Burt began
yesterday in San Bernardino Superior
Court with opening arguments by
defense attorney Charles Garry and
prosecutor Joseph D. Canty, and the
testimony of one witness.
The Burts face charges of murder,
assault with a deadly weapon, and
lynching (removal of a prisoner from
lawful custody). An all-white jury of
five men and seven women was
selected last week for the trial, which
is expected to last three months.
In his opening statement, Canty
said he would proceed on proving a
conspiracy theory by introducing
evidence corroborating the testimony
of Ronald Wayne Beaty, the prisoner
the Burts allegedly helped to escape
from the Chino Institute for Men Oct.
6.
Beaty was recaptured after the
ambush-escape, in which one prison
guard, Jesus Sanchez, was killed and
another was wounded. Beaty pleaded
guilty to a murder charge in a plea
bargain, received a life sentence, and
testified before the grand jury that
indicted the Burts. His testimony
implicated Jean Hobson, Robert
Seabock, and members of Venceremos
in the escape plan.
Conspiracy Theory
The prosecution will produce
evidence showing that Benton Douglas
Burt and Beaty knew each other in
prison and discussed the escape plan,
that later plans were made through
phone calls and letters, that Burt
actually freed Beaty from the car in
which he was being transported, and
that Andrea Burt drove one of the two
ambush vehicles, Canty said yesterday.
Evidence gathered in the
Hobson-Seabock murder trial will be
used against the Burts, the district
attorney indicated. The prosecution
maintains that conspirators planned
the escape and subsequently made
provisions to conceal Beaty.
The defense has argued that any
conspiracy that may have existed
ended when Beaty was freed. But the
main issue in the defense attorney's

statement was the credibility of Beaty
as a witness.
Credibility Challenge
In his opening remarks, Garry
called Beaty "a person no one can
believe" who "uses people in the most
degrading manner." Garry emphasized
the complete innocence of all four
defendants (the Burts, Hobson, and
Seabock), and Venceremos.
Despite a recent ruling by Superior
Court Judge Thomas Haldorsen which
stated that Venceremos may not be
mentioned in court unless directly
related to the crime, Garry specifically
mentioned the revolutionary
organization in his remarks and
stressed the innocence of its members.
"The evidence will show that Beaty
cultivated a relationship with
Venceremos to the point that in the
event his escape plan fell through he
would trade off Venceremos to get a
better deal," Garry said. He also
claimed Beaty had worked with a Nazi
organization while he was in prison.
First Witness
Yesterday afternoon Garry told the
Daily, "It is not the politics of
Venceremos that are on trial. The
attitudes of the defendants are
relevant." He said he would attempt to
discredit Beaty's testimony through
cross-examination, but added that he
was under a gag rule. "Haldorsen
doesn't appreciate me talking about
the case," he remarked.
The prosecution yesterday called its
first witness, pathologist Harry Wayne
Scott. Scott examined photographs of
the slain guard, Sanchez, and
attributed his death to a gunshot
would which caused hemorrhaging and
severed the carotid artery and jugular
vein. The death certificate was
admitted as evidence.
Fitzgerald, the guard who was
wounded by the ambushers, will
testify today. He was unable to
identify Benton Douglas Burt in a
lineup and Garry has maintained that
this failure to recognize the defendant
is a good indication that Burt was not
present at the escape. Fitzgerald has
undergone hypnosis in an effort to
recall the details of the incident.

the complete innocence of all four
defendants (the Burts, Hobson, and
Seabock), and Venceremos.
Despite a recent ruling by Superior
Court Judge Thomas Haldorsen which
stated that Venceremos may not be
mentioned in court unless directly
related to the crime, Garry specifically
mentioned the revolutionary
organization in his remarks and
stressed the innocence of its members.
"The evidence will show that Beaty
cultivated a relationship with
Venceremos to the point that in the
event his escape plan fell through he
would trade off Venceremos to get a
better deal," Garry said. He also
claimed Beaty had worked with a Nazi
organization while he was in prison.
First Witness
Yesterday afternoon Garry told the
Daily, "It is not the politics of
Venceremos that are on trial. The
attitudes of the defendants are
relevant." He said he would attempt to
discredit Beaty's testimony through
cross-examination, but added that he
was under a gag rule. "Haldorsen
doesn't appreciate me talking about
the case," he remarked.
The prosecution yesterday called its
first witness, pathologist Harry Wayne
Scott. Scott examined photographs of
the slain guard, Sanchez, and
attributed his death to a gunshot
would which caused hemorrhaging and
severed the carotid artery and jugular
vein. The death certificate was
admitted as evidence.
Fitzgerald, the guard who was
wounded by the ambushers, will
testify today. He was unable to
identify Benton Douglas Burt in a
lineup and Garry has maintained that
this failure to recognize the defendant
is a good indication that Burt was not
present at the escape. Fitzgerald has
undergone hypnosis in an effort to
recall the details of the incident.
The trial of Andrea Holman Burt
and Benton Douglas Burt began
yesterday in San Bernardino Superior
Court with opening arguments by
defense attorney Charles Garry and
prosecutor Joseph D. Canty, and the
testimony of one witness.
The Burts face charges of murder,
assault with a deadly weapon, and
lynching (removal of a prisoner from
lawful custody). An all-white jury of
five men and seven women was
selected last week for the trial, which
is expected to last three months.
In his opening statement, Canty
said he would proceed on proving a
conspiracy theory by introducing
evidence corroborating the testimony
of Ronald Wayne Beaty, the prisoner
the Burts allegedly helped to escape
from the Chino Institute for Men Oct.
6.
Beaty was recaptured after the
ambush-escape, in which one prison
guard, Jesus Sanchez, was killed and
another was wounded. Beaty pleaded
guilty to a murder charge in a plea
bargain, received a life sentence, and
testified before the grand jury that
indicted the Burts. His testimony
implicated Jean Hobson, Robert
Seabock, and members of Venceremos
in the escape plan.
Conspiracy Theory
The prosecution will produce
evidence showing that Benton Douglas
Burt and Beaty knew each other in
prison and discussed the escape plan,
that later plans were made through
phone calls and letters, that Burt
actually freed Beaty from the car in
which he was being transported, and
that Andrea Burt drove one of the two
ambush vehicles, Canty said yesterday.
Evidence gathered in the
Hobson-Seabock murder trial will be
used against the Burts, the district
attorney indicated. The prosecution
maintains that conspirators planned
the escape and subsequently made
provisions to conceal Beaty.
The defense has argued that any
conspiracy that may have existed
ended when Beaty was freed. But the
main issue in the defense attorney's

statement was the credibility of Beaty
as a witness.
Credibility Challenge
In his opening remarks, Garry
called Beaty "a person no one can
believe" who "uses people in the most
degrading manner." Garry emphasized
the complete innocence of all four
defendants (the Burts, Hobson, and
Seabock), and Venceremos.
