# Weekend Crew Races Bring Mixed Success
## 
### 
The Stanford crew met with mixed success last Saturday in races
with Oregon, Oregon State, and Pacific Lutheran at Eugene, Oregon.
The varsity finished second by a length in a three-boat race with
Oregon and Pacific Lutheran.

Stanford had a chance for
victory until midway down the
course where the boat was hit by
a wake which upset the timing in
the boat. The Cards were unable
to regain their timing and the
Ducks went on to win.
The lightweight varsity was
defeated by a highly-rated Oregon
State team by a slim half-boat
margin. The Cards were closing in
on the Beavers at the end of the
race but the finish line came too
soon.
The junior varsity posted a
one-length victory over Oregon
State, while the freshmen boat
lost by the same margin to
Oregon. The second freshmen
boat defeated the Ducks in an
easy victory.
This week the Cardinals travel
to Santa Barbara to race UC Santa
Barbara and UC San Diego.
The following week the crew
will take another trip south, this
time to compete against UCLA
and USC in Los Angeles.
