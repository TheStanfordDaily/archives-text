# Shuffling The Cards
## Golf Is A Crazy Game 
### Dave Robinson 
A group of 10 golfers from Stanford and San
Jose State were sitting in a Santa Cruz restaurant
Thursday night, bemoaning the inconsistency which
had left both teams far off the pace after 36 holes
of the 54 hole Western Intercollegiate golf
tournament.
At that point Stanford stood 10th in the 26 team
field and the Spartans had barely survived the cut as
the 10th place team. The next day things improved
slightly, the Cards finishing the tournament in sixth
place with San Jose State two strokes back in
seventh.
But it was those stories at dinner Thursday night
that explained the frustrating tournament for the
two Bay area golf powers. "Yesterday I eagled the
first hole," said George Pettinger, who had struggled
through a disastrous round of 87 a few hours earlier,
"but today I bogeyed it. And today I shot 38 on the
front nine and 49 on the back."
"That's nothing," said San Jose's Jim Knoll, who
a month ago shot 66-74 for a 140 total and an easy
victory in the Cal State Hayward tournament at
Silverado. "I made a nine on the 11th hole today."
Then Aly Trompas explained how he suffered a
triple bogey on the sixth hole without any penalty
strokes, Dave Baskins told of his triple bogey-double
bogey finish after playing the first 16 holes in only
three over par, and Bob Chapman gave a short
dissertation on his putting woes.
Everybody had a problem, and as typical golfers,
each player had a story to top the previous one.
Then Knoll came up with an idea that sent
everybody's head spinning. "I wonder what our
score would be if we added the worst score on each
hole from the 10 of us."
Knoll went through the course hole by hole, and
all 10 golfers made at least one contribution.
Pettinger seemed to dominate the back nine since he
shot 49 all by himself, but Knoll's nine on 11 and

Baskins' seven on 17 sent the composite score
skyrocketing.
Finally the mythical score was added up and it
came to 112, 41 strokes over par, which is quite a
few shots considering the fact that all 10
contributing golfers have handicaps of three or less.
Knoll then decided to repeat the process, this
time taking the best score for each hole. The
composite best ball came to 62, nine under par and
50 strokes under the worst ball total.
All of which goes to show that golf is a very
crazy game.

While the golfers were struggling in Santa Cruz
and the baseball and track teams both absorbed
defeats (although the track loss represented a moral
victory), Stanford's tennis weekend was a complete
success. Over 2500 spectators watched Coach Dick
Gould's netmen defeat UCLA and USC over the
weekend, once again establishing tennis as one of
the most popular spectator sports at Stanford.
"This area is the tennis capital of the world,"
said Gould. "Tickets went on sale at 12 noon and
both days they were sold out by 12:15."
Gould indicated that the possibility of increasing
the seating capacity at the varsity courts is being
looked into by the athletic department, but no
plans have been finalized.
Meanwhile the Stanford coach is making sure
that the Cards will have plenty of talent for future
fans to watch. Nick Saviano and Gene Mayer
(Sandy's brother) were both on hand for the
matches over the weekend and Gould says
Stanford's chances are excellent for landing th*> two
prep stars, both of whom he considers am or
"the top five high school prospects in the ro nitr
Both Saviano and Mayer have aire. ,n
admitted to Stanford.
