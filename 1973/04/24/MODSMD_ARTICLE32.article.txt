Kissinger Criticizes N. Viet Violations
NEW YORK — Henry A. Kissinger, President Nixon's
foreign policy adviser, said yesterday the North
Vietnamese had "systematically" and "cynically violated"
the Paris peace agreement.
"The profound problem we face as a nation today,"
Kissinger said at the annual Associated Press membership
meeting, is whether the signing of the agreement "should
simply be treated as irrelevant."
On the Watergate scandal, Kissinger said he was sure
the President would "insist on a tull disclosure."
"Then we will have to ask ourselves whether we can
afford an orgy of recrimination," he said. "Faith in the
country must be maintained."
Kissinger, responding to questions from the audience,
said, "We have been very disappointed with the
compliance by the North Vietnamese" with the Paris pact.
"We have used our influence with our friends in Saigon
to bring about substantial compliance with the
agreement," he said. "No one can seriously believe that
we are looking for pretexts to remain involved."
"We want nothing else than the observance of an
agreement freely negotiated," he stated.
"Our purpose in negotiating the agreement was to end
the American involvement in Southeast Asia," he said.
In his prepared address, Kissinger said President Nixon
was seeking to wo rk out a new Atlantic charter with
America's European allies that will reflect the new
economic power structure, including Japan.
He said the outline — "not an American prescription
but an appeal for a joint effort" — was based on easing the
economic frictions and continuing the presence of U.S.
forces in Europe.
Gunman Captured In Shoot-Out
MERCED, Calif. —A gunman described by his landlady as
"someone you'd adore" lay chained to a hospital bed
yesterday facing warrants that accused him of killing two
women, raping two others, kidnaping 10 persons and
firing at police three times during a 400-mile weekend
crime spree.
John P. Bunyard, 27, a truck driver, was arrested here
after a police shootout that pumped gunshot into his legs
and stomach Sunday. He was in satisfactory condition
complaining of pain, Merced Hospital spokesmen said.
Dist. Atty. Richard Gimblin in neighboring Mariposa
County charged Bunyard with murdering two women who
were shot in the head, with kidnaping two other persons,
armed robbery and assaulting a policeman.
Bail was set at $1 million by Mariposa Justice Court
Judge Claude Walton.
Merced Sheriff John Latorraca said hold orders were
placed on Bunyard by San Francisco police on an
attempted rape and attempted murder warrant, by
Oakland police on a kidnaping and rape warrant and by
South Lake Tahoe police on a kidnaping and rape
warrant.
San Francisco detectives said they were showing
Bunyard's picture to victims of the so-called "Nob Hill
rapist" who has killed one woman and raped two others in
San Francisco's Nob Hill area. Inspector Chris Sullivan
said Yoshika Tanaka, 19, a Japanese woman who was
stabbed 20 times and left for dead at her Nob Hill
apartment, identified Bunyard from photographs as her
attacker.
"We are further satisfied now that he is responsible for
the sexual assaults in the Nob Hill neighborhood,"
Sullivan said.
John Reed, FBI agent in charge in Sacramento, said
two federal kidnaping complaints were being prepared
against Bunyard.
Meanwhile, the landlady at Bunyard's Nob Hill
apartment described him as "a very nice person; someone

you'd adore." The landlady, who declined to give her
name, said Bunyard moved in last January.
Brezhnev Discusses Emigration Tax
MOSCOW — Soviet Communist party chief Leonid I.
Brezhnev conducted an unusual 3'/i-hour Kremlin meeting
yesterday with seven U.S. senators to discuss
Soviet-American trade and congressional opposition to
Soviet emigration policies.
Three of the senators told newsmen after the meeting
that Brezhnev gave them information on the status of
Moscow's disputed education tax and added that they will
report their findings to President Nixon.
The fact that Brezhnev received the senators and spent
3'/ 2 hours with them demonstrated the high priority
Soviet leaders place on Soviet-American trade and
indicated official Kremlin concern about the fate of a
U.S.-Russian trade bill in Congress.
Sen. James B. Pearson, R—Kan., indicated, however,
that discussion of the education tax did not go far beyond
the Soviet assurances to Nixon last week that the levy will
no longer be collected. The assurances were seen as a
Soviet concession to members of Congress who refuse to
vote for trade concessions to the Soviet Union unless
restrictive emigration policies are changed.
The Soviet government imposed the tax with the
proclaimed aim of recouping money spent by the state on
education of those who later leave for another country.
With its tradition of education and its widespread desire
to emigrate to Israel, the Soviet Jewish population was
particularly hard hit. Some Jewish leaders decried the tax
as nothing more than disguised ransom for Jews.
Pregnancy Discrimination Examined
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court yesterday agreed
to examine the constitutionality of rules that force
women off the job solely because they are pregnant.
The issue reached the high court in two cases from the
classroom.
The Cleveland city schools appealed the ruling of the
U.S. Circuit at Cincinnati that found a ban on teachers
more than five months pregnant "clearly arbitrary and
unreasonable."
On the other side of the issue, the high court will also
hear the appeal of a Chesterfield County, Va., teacher,
Susan Cohen.
The U.S. Circuit Court in Richmond upheld a
regulation similar to that struck down in Cleveland. The
school boards argued in briefs that termination was
necessary because of a lessened ability to perform duties
and to protect the pregnant woman's health.
Lawyers for the teachers in the two cases said a blanket
policy that did not take into account the individual's
fitness for the job constituted an invidious form of sex
discrimination.
State Will Retry Magee
SAN FRANCISCO — Because of a possible stiffer penalty,
the state will retry convict Ruchell Magee of aggravated
kidnaping charges but not murder charges in the 1970
slaying of a Marin County Superior Court Judge, Atty.
Gen. Evelle J. Younger said yesterday.
The San Quentin inmate will be tried on a charge of
aggravated kidnaping which can result in a life term
without parole. A murder conviction can bring a life term
with possible parole.
Today's Weather
SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA - Mostly fair through
tomorrow except patches of low clouds near coast
extending inland locally night and mornings. Lows tonight
in the low 40s to low 50s. Highs both days in the 60s near
the coast to the 70s inland. West to northwest wind 10 to
