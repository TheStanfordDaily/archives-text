# University Committee Members
## Students Feel Influence Limited 
### JANET SANDERS 
Student members of University
committees have an opportunity to
play an active role in changing
administration policies. But student
political power this year may be more
of a potentiality than an actuality.
"Students can make an impact,"
said sophomore Mark Cushing,
chairman of Committee on Services to
Students (C-OSS). But far more often,
their influence is not asserted.
Most student members of the 25
University committees open to
students agree that it makes no
difference whether they are there or
not. This can partly be explained by
the lack of controversy at most
committee meetings this year. Few
committees have experienced any split
between faculty and students.
But the lack of student political
power is also due to student apathy
and inexperience, according to James
Lyons, dean of student affairs.
Lack Time, Experience
"The student starts without the
experience which the faculty and
administration already have," Lyons
said. He pointed out that many staff
members work full-time on the
problems that come before a
committee for approval. "It is rare
that the student has enough time to
make the in-depth study necessary to
seriously question a proposal," he said.
Cushing remarked that there is "a
natural deference to a faculty or staff
member's informational expertise."
The student is often overwhelmed by
his lack of information on a subject
and keeps quiet, he added.
"If you have never heard of it
before, how can you question it?,"
asked junior Harvey Motulsky, a
member of the Committee on Land
and Building Development. He said
that the two-hour meetings held twice
a quarter consist of "listening to
University officials tell us what's going
on and then approving their plans for
the future."
Initiative Needed
Motulsky went on to say that this
so-called rubber-stamp nature of the
committee exists "because no one has
taken the initiative to change it.
Everybody is just too busy."
Larry Diamond, a former member
of the Committee on Undergraduate
Admissions and Financial Aid
(C-UAFA) for two and a half years,
said, "Power on a committee is largely
a matter of knowledge. If students
gather information on the issues, they
can have a profound impact on
decisions." But most members do not
have the desire or time to do this
necessary homework, he added.
A certain amount of tenacity is
required to push through an issue,"
said Lyons, claiming that usually one
or two active members control the

committee's decisions. He said that
most students lack this tenacity.
Shortage of Interest, Applicants
"Many students join a committee
just to have it on their record for
graduate schools," said Neal Weir,
member of the Committee on Foreign
Study Programs.
Cushing also pointed out that
students applying for committee
positions often do not get their first or
second choices. As a result, many
student members have little interest in
the committee's business.
Cushing said there are not enough
student applicants for committee
positions to carefully select those who
are truly interested. Most present
members saw an advertisement in the
Daily for committee openings and
were appointed after a short interview
with ASSU Presidents Scott Burke and
Peter Van Petten, Co-Chairmen of the
Student Senate Committee on
Nominations.
Relevant Skills
"There should be more of an
emphasis on actively recruiting
students who have the skills and
interest relevant to a committee," said
Lyons. He expressed disappointment
at the lack of student involvement in
student affairs.
But student political power and
interest is not absent in all University
committees. Junior Margaret Bullitt,
member of the Committee on the
Education and Employment of

Women in the Unviersity said, "Our
student members definitely have an
impact on decisions." She felt that the
administration paid attention to the
proposals that the committee made.
But such a statement is not typical.
'There is a big discrepancy between
what we are supposed to do and what
we actually do," said senior Richard
Miller, member of the C-UAFA. The
committee, which meets only twice a
quarter, "has not made any policy
changes this year," he said.
Membership Controversy
Student membership on University
committees was a controversial topic a
few years ago. Until February, 1969,
student committee members v/ere
appointed by the University President
and had no voting power on any
committee.
The comprehensive Study of
Education at Stanford led to a change
in this policy. The ASSU now selects
student members and the nominations
are approved by the Student Senate
and the Committee on Committees.
Although there is no student
majority on any committee except
C-OSS, at least three students vote on
each of 25 committees and
commissions of the University. Some
committees, including the Faculty
Senate committees, still have no
student members.
Student members of next year's
committee positions will be selected
sometime this spring.

are truly interested. Most present
members saw an advertisement in the
Daily for committee openings and
were appointed after a short interview
with ASSU Presidents Scott Burke and
Peter Van Petten, Co-Chairmen of the
Student Senate Committee on
Nominations.
Relevant Skills
"There should be more of an
emphasis on actively recruiting
students who have the skills and
interest relevant to a committee," said
Lyons. He expressed disappointment
at the lack of student involvement in
student affairs.
But student political power and
interest is not absent in all University
committees. Junior Margaret Bullitt,
member of the Committee on the
Education and Employment of

Women in the Unviersity said, "Our
student members definitely have an
impact on decisions." She felt that the
administration paid attention to the
proposals that the committee made.
But such a statement is not typical.
'There is a big discrepancy between
what we are supposed to do and what
we actually do," said senior Richard
Miller, member of the C-UAFA. The
committee, which meets only twice a
quarter, "has not made any policy
changes this year," he said.
Membership Controversy
Student membership on University
committees was a controversial topic a
few years ago. Until February, 1969,
student committee members v/ere
appointed by the University President
and had no voting power on any
committee.
The comprehensive Study of
Education at Stanford led to a change
in this policy. The ASSU now selects
student members and the nominations
are approved by the Student Senate
and the Committee on Committees.
Although there is no student
majority on any committee except
C-OSS, at least three students vote on
each of 25 committees and
commissions of the University. Some
committees, including the Faculty
Senate committees, still have no
student members.
Student members of next year's
committee positions will be selected
sometime this spring.
Student members of University
committees have an opportunity to
play an active role in changing
administration policies. But student
political power this year may be more
of a potentiality than an actuality.
"Students can make an impact,"
said sophomore Mark Cushing,
chairman of Committee on Services to
Students (C-OSS). But far more often,
their influence is not asserted.
Most student members of the 25
University committees open to
students agree that it makes no
difference whether they are there or
not. This can partly be explained by
the lack of controversy at most
committee meetings this year. Few
committees have experienced any split
between faculty and students.
But the lack of student political
power is also due to student apathy
and inexperience, according to James
Lyons, dean of student affairs.
Lack Time, Experience
"The student starts without the
experience which the faculty and
administration already have," Lyons
said. He pointed out that many staff
members work full-time on the
problems that come before a
committee for approval. "It is rare
that the student has enough time to
make the in-depth study necessary to
seriously question a proposal," he said.
Cushing remarked that there is "a
natural deference to a faculty or staff
member's informational expertise."
The student is often overwhelmed by
his lack of information on a subject
and keeps quiet, he added.
"If you have never heard of it
before, how can you question it?,"
asked junior Harvey Motulsky, a
member of the Committee on Land
and Building Development. He said
that the two-hour meetings held twice
a quarter consist of "listening to
University officials tell us what's going
on and then approving their plans for
the future."
Initiative Needed
Motulsky went on to say that this
so-called rubber-stamp nature of the
committee exists "because no one has
taken the initiative to change it.
Everybody is just too busy."
Larry Diamond, a former member
of the Committee on Undergraduate
Admissions and Financial Aid
(C-UAFA) for two and a half years,
said, "Power on a committee is largely
a matter of knowledge. If students
gather information on the issues, they
can have a profound impact on
decisions." But most members do not
have the desire or time to do this
necessary homework, he added.
A certain amount of tenacity is
required to push through an issue,"
said Lyons, claiming that usually one
or two active members control the

committee's decisions. He said that
most students lack this tenacity.
Shortage of Interest, Applicants
"Many students join a committee
just to have it on their record for
graduate schools," said Neal Weir,
member of the Committee on Foreign
Study Programs.
Cushing also pointed out that
students applying for committee
positions often do not get their first or
second choices. As a result, many
student members have little interest in
the committee's business.
Cushing said there are not enough
student applicants for committee
positions to carefully select those who
are truly interested. Most present

Cushing remarked that there is "a
natural deference to a faculty or staff
member's informational expertise."
The student is often overwhelmed by
his lack of information on a subject
and keeps quiet, he added.
"If you have never heard of it
before, how can you question it?,"
asked junior Harvey Motulsky, a
member of the Committee on Land
and Building Development. He said
that the two-hour meetings held twice
a quarter consist of "listening to
University officials tell us what's going
on and then approving their plans for
the future."
Initiative Needed
Motulsky went on to say that this
so-called rubber-stamp nature of the
committee exists "because no one has
taken the initiative to change it.
Everybody is just too busy."
Larry Diamond, a former member
of the Committee on Undergraduate
Admissions and Financial Aid
(C-UAFA) for two and a half years,
said, "Power on a committee is largely
a matter of knowledge. If students
gather information on the issues, they
can have a profound impact on
decisions." But most members do not
have the desire or time to do this
necessary homework, he added.
A certain amount of tenacity is
required to push through an issue,"
said Lyons, claiming that usually one
or two active members control the

committee's decisions. He said that
most students lack this tenacity.
Shortage of Interest, Applicants
"Many students join a committee
just to have it on their record for
graduate schools," said Neal Weir,
member of the Committee on Foreign
Study Programs.
Cushing also pointed out that
students applying for committee
positions often do not get their first or
second choices. As a result, many
student members have little interest in
the committee's business.
Cushing said there are not enough
student applicants for committee
positions to carefully select those who
are truly interested. Most present
members saw an advertisement in the
Daily for committee openings and
were appointed after a short interview
with ASSU Presidents Scott Burke and
Peter Van Petten, Co-Chairmen of the
Student Senate Committee on
Nominations.
Relevant Skills
"There should be more of an
emphasis on actively recruiting
students who have the skills and
interest relevant to a committee," said
Lyons. He expressed disappointment
at the lack of student involvement in
student affairs.
But student political power and
interest is not absent in all University
committees. Junior Margaret Bullitt,
member of the Committee on the
Education and Employment of

Women in the Unviersity said, "Our
student members definitely have an
impact on decisions." She felt that the
administration paid attention to the
proposals that the committee made.
But such a statement is not typical.
'There is a big discrepancy between
what we are supposed to do and what
we actually do," said senior Richard
Miller, member of the C-UAFA. The
committee, which meets only twice a
quarter, "has not made any policy
changes this year," he said.
Membership Controversy
Student membership on University
committees was a controversial topic a
few years ago. Until February, 1969,
student committee members v/ere
appointed by the University President
and had no voting power on any
committee.
The comprehensive Study of
Education at Stanford led to a change
in this policy. The ASSU now selects
student members and the nominations
are approved by the Student Senate
and the Committee on Committees.
Although there is no student
majority on any committee except
C-OSS, at least three students vote on
each of 25 committees and
commissions of the University. Some
committees, including the Faculty
Senate committees, still have no
student members.
Student members of next year's
committee positions will be selected
sometime this spring.
