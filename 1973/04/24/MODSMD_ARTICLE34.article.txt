# Noted Economist Dies
## 
### 
Prof. Emile Despres, one of the
world's foremost specialists in
international economics and economic
development, died Monday afternoon
at his Portola Valley home. He was 63.
Despres had been in declining health
for several years following a brain
hemorrhage.
Called "one of the most insightful
minds of our time" by Nobel Laureate
Paul A. Samuelson of MIT, Despres
joined the Department of Economics
in 1961 after teaching at Williams
College for 15 years.
A Phi Beta Kappa graduate of
Harvard University (1930) he worked
extensively with the Federal Reserve
Sytem, the Office of Strategic'
Services, the State Department, and
Agency for International
Development, among others. A former
adviser of the Federal Reserve System
Board of Governors, he was a member
of the U.S. delegation to the Potsdam
Conference in 1945.
While known to scholars around the
world, Despres never received a Ph.D.
and rarely wrote for publication. Prof.
Gerald M. Meier of the Graduate
School of Business, who edited many
of his informal works into a book,

International Economic Reform:
Collected Papers of Emile Despres,
said "his remarkable intuition and
judgment" made him "one of the most
astute policy advisers of his
generation."
Economics Department Chairman
Moses Abramovitz called Despres "one
of this generation's most profound
students of economic affairs and
business life. Much of what we know
about the complexities of
international economic relations and
about the directions in which to search
for national solutions, we owe to him.
Though he wrote little, economists all
over the world looked to him for
illumination and inspiration."
Born Sept. 12, 1909, in Chicago, he
married Joanna Eakin in 1939. She
and three children survive. They
include two sons, John, an economist
with the RAND Corporation, Santa
Barbara; and Charles, a student at the
Medical School of Los Altos; and one
daughter, Lani Burack, of New Haven,
Conn.
Arrangements are pending for a
memorial service. The family prefers
memorial contributions to the
American Friends Service Committee.
