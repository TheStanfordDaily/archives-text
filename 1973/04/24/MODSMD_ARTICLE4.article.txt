PLEA FOR A PARK—Don Kamprath was among the residents of the Scott
Street neighborhood who addressed the Palo Alto City Council last night urging
that the city purchase two vacant lots in the area to build a mini-park. The
Council voted 6-3 to direct city officials to negotiate for purchase of the lots, a
move enthusiastically supported by a large part of the capacity audience of
about 150.
