# Wounded Knee Resolution
## PA Council Won't Support Indian Demands 
### ROBERT BACON 
The Palo Alto City Council last
night refused the request of its Youth
Advisory Council (YAC) that it
support the demands of militant
Indians occupying Wounded Knee,
South Dakota.
Earlier in the meeting, the Council
voted 6-3 to authorize city purchase of
two vacant lots on Scott Street near
the Palo Alto Medical Clinic for use as
a mini-park.
The Council disregarded the pleas
of a majority of the YAC and five
members of the audience to support
the Wounded Knee occupation. No
Council member supported the
proposal.
The Council members offered
varying reasons for their position.
Councilman Alan Henderson and
Councilwoman Enid Pearson told their
colleagues that they did not feel they
knew enough about the Wounded
Knee situation to pass judgment.
Federal Question
Councilman John Beahrs insisted
that this was a federal question outside
the city's jurisdiction. Councilman
John Berwald said he refused to
defend a group opposing the United
States government.
Mayor Kirke Comstock said he had
"concluded that the Wounded Knee
occupation won't solve the problems
of the Indians, that it will be
counter-productive."
A sizeable portion of the audience
enthusiastically supported the
pro-Indian position, applauding each
pro-Indian speaker and occasionally
interrupting the council members. The
meeting was never in serious danger of

disruption during the Wounded Knee
debate, however.
The Council did vote, 6-2 with one
abstaining, to permit the YAC to issue
the statement under its own name.
Beahrs and Berwald opposed this
motion, and Vice Mayor Stanley
Norton abstained.
Acceptable Statement
The other members said that they
supported YAC's right to issue a
statement acceptable to a majority of
its members, whether or not the City
Council agreed with its sentiments.
Among those addressing the
Council was George Martin of San
Jose, a member of the American
Indian Movement (AIM), the group
responsible for the Wounded Knee
occupation. "Wounded Knee to us
means our last stand. We aren't going
to give up. We'll make the U.S.
government talk to us," he said.
The YAC's resolution called AlM's
occupation of Wounded Knee "a
major step in the Indians' fight for
their rights" and declared YAC's
"support for the Indians at Wounded
Knee and their demands."
Fifteen Member YAC
The YAC, made up of fifteen
students of Palo Alto junior and senior
high schools, adopted the statement
on April 5 by a vote of 8-2. It was
presented to the Council last night by
Dana Bergen, a sophomore at Palo
Alto High School and a YAC member.
The proposal for city purchase of
the Scott Street lots also had wide
audience support. Five nearby
residents addressed the Council, all
favoring the purchase and all
applauded by a substantial segment of

the audience.
Scott Street is a one-block street
near downtown Palo Alto which is
dominated by older low- and
rioderate-income housing units. It was
to be the site of the downtown
hospital, plans for which were dropped
after voters refused to approve a
necessary zone change in 1970.
Supporters of the park proposal
pointed to the wide neighborhood
support for the park, and the absence
of parks in the surrounding area.
Opponents claimed that the site was
too small and was not properly located
for a park.
Best Site Available
Supporters responded that the site
was the best one available, and that
the city must offer to buy the
property now or not at all, since
apartments would soon be built on the

site should the city decline to buy it.
The Council last night did not give
formal approval to the purchase, but
only directed the city staff to enter
negotiations for its purchase.
Councilmen supporting the project
stressed that the city was not
committing itself to construction of
the park. They said that should a
better site be found nearby, the park
might be located elsewhere and the
Scott Street site put to other use. The
purchase negotiations were approved
by a 6-3 vote with Beahrs, Norton, and
William H. Clark opposed.
The meeting was abruptly
adjourned by Comstock at 12:30 a.m.
today when members of the audience
complaining about police relations
with the city's drug abuse program
began repeatedly disrupting the
meeting.

Among those addressing the
Council was George Martin of San
Jose, a member of the American
Indian Movement (AIM), the group
responsible for the Wounded Knee
occupation. "Wounded Knee to us
means our last stand. We aren't going
to give up. We'll make the U.S.
government talk to us," he said.
The YAC's resolution called AlM's
occupation of Wounded Knee "a
major step in the Indians' fight for
their rights" and declared YAC's
"support for the Indians at Wounded
Knee and their demands."
Fifteen Member YAC
The YAC, made up of fifteen
students of Palo Alto junior and senior
high schools, adopted the statement
on April 5 by a vote of 8-2. It was
presented to the Council last night by
Dana Bergen, a sophomore at Palo
Alto High School and a YAC member.
The proposal for city purchase of
the Scott Street lots also had wide
audience support. Five nearby
residents addressed the Council, all
favoring the purchase and all
applauded by a substantial segment of

the audience.
Scott Street is a one-block street
near downtown Palo Alto which is
dominated by older low- and
rioderate-income housing units. It was
to be the site of the downtown
hospital, plans for which were dropped
after voters refused to approve a
necessary zone change in 1970.
Supporters of the park proposal
pointed to the wide neighborhood
support for the park, and the absence
of parks in the surrounding area.
Opponents claimed that the site was
too small and was not properly located
for a park.
Best Site Available
Supporters responded that the site
was the best one available, and that
the city must offer to buy the
property now or not at all, since
apartments would soon be built on the

site should the city decline to buy it.
The Council last night did not give
formal approval to the purchase, but
only directed the city staff to enter
negotiations for its purchase.
Councilmen supporting the project
stressed that the city was not
committing itself to construction of
the park. They said that should a
better site be found nearby, the park
might be located elsewhere and the
Scott Street site put to other use. The
purchase negotiations were approved
by a 6-3 vote with Beahrs, Norton, and
William H. Clark opposed.
The meeting was abruptly
adjourned by Comstock at 12:30 a.m.
today when members of the audience
complaining about police relations
with the city's drug abuse program
began repeatedly disrupting the
meeting.
The Palo Alto City Council last
night refused the request of its Youth
Advisory Council (YAC) that it
support the demands of militant
Indians occupying Wounded Knee,
South Dakota.
Earlier in the meeting, the Council
voted 6-3 to authorize city purchase of
two vacant lots on Scott Street near
the Palo Alto Medical Clinic for use as
a mini-park.
The Council disregarded the pleas
of a majority of the YAC and five
members of the audience to support
the Wounded Knee occupation. No
Council member supported the
proposal.
The Council members offered
varying reasons for their position.
Councilman Alan Henderson and
Councilwoman Enid Pearson told their
colleagues that they did not feel they
knew enough about the Wounded
Knee situation to pass judgment.
Federal Question
Councilman John Beahrs insisted
that this was a federal question outside
the city's jurisdiction. Councilman
John Berwald said he refused to
defend a group opposing the United
States government.
Mayor Kirke Comstock said he had
"concluded that the Wounded Knee
occupation won't solve the problems
of the Indians, that it will be
counter-productive."
A sizeable portion of the audience
enthusiastically supported the
pro-Indian position, applauding each
pro-Indian speaker and occasionally
interrupting the council members. The
meeting was never in serious danger of

disruption during the Wounded Knee
debate, however.
The Council did vote, 6-2 with one
abstaining, to permit the YAC to issue
the statement under its own name.
Beahrs and Berwald opposed this
motion, and Vice Mayor Stanley
Norton abstained.

The other members said that they
