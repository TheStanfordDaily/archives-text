# 1923 Judgment Found!
## File Uncovered 
### 
► Daniel Brenner

For several months the News and Publications Services of this
university have bought pages of display space in the Daily to publish
in toto summaries, edicts, findings, and other official papers. Their
purpose, no doubt, is to better inform the commonweal of the
bureaucratic decision-making upon which this school functions. To
this laudable — and for the Daily, financially rewarding — end,
huzzahs and horrays are in order.
The most recent of these complete texts was entitled, "Results of
Student Disciplinary Cases — A Summary of CJP and Dean of Student
Affairs Recommendations." In case you didn't wade through the
columns of press-wire type, during autumn and winter quarters a total
of four cases were decided by the CJP and two adjucated by the
Dean's office. While I wonder about the wisdom of providing every
Daily reader with the unabridged version of the decisions (perhaps a
couple on file in the campus libraries would suffice), far be it from me
to denounce the construction of a new bridge of communication.
At any rate, the Daily Opinions Page research staff looked through
several old file boxes of old judicial opinions and came up with these,
as yet unpublished, rulings. So, just to show that the Daily isn't trying
to rip-off the University by forcing it to pay for every official
document published, the Opinions Page proudly presents, gratis, Texts
of Opinions from 1923.
In Re Q
The defendant was charged with violating the Honor Code by
cribbing the natural logarithm table onto his sport shirt for a calculus
examination.
The defendant claimed that the crib notes had nothing to do with
his examination and alleged that it was part of a fraternity rush prank.
This argument we find to be unpersuasive.
The defendant also claimed that the crib notes were not of the
natural logarithm tables but of thyperiodic weights of the first eight
natural elements. He said he had a chemistry test the same day. We
find this argument to be unpersuasive, and we note for the records to
initiate proceedings into his performance on his chemistry test.
The defendant finally claimed that, even if it was a mathematical
crib sheet, every other student in the class had one, and why shouldn't
he. This, we bought.
The panel recommends that the defendant not be penalized. Case
dismissed.

In Re X, Y, and Z
The defendants were charged with selling elevator tickets in
geology corner to unsuspecting freshmen. Moreover, when the
President of the university asked them what they were doing, they
offered him a pair of tickets at half price. When he refused, the
defendants socked a water balloon at him.
The defendants claimed that the tickets were only a harmless
prank, and that the $649.75 they had collected was going to be used
to purchase rooter seats at basketball games. This argument we find to
be unpersuasive.
More Claims
The defendants also claimed that they did not recognize the
President, for if they had, they would have given him the tickets free
of charge. This too we find to be unpersuasive.
Finally, the defendants have the nerve to allege that they socked
the President with the water balloon under the belief that this would
"cool him off." Even if this did "cool him off," we find it hard to
believe that a more discrete method, say, a flex straw filled with
water, would have done the trick without ruining the President's suit.
The panel recommends, first: that all defendants return all money
collected; second, agree to dry clean the President's suit; and third,
promise members of this commission a free ride on the elevator.

In Re W-2
The defendant was charged with holding down two campus jobs at
the same time while enrolling as a full-time graduate student in
medical microbiology. When W-2 appeared before the commission, he
did not deny the charges but alleged that tuition increases were
driving him to file two time cards.
While the commission understands W-2's problem, we are at a loss
to explain why he did not seek advice from his faculty advisor. The
defendant claimed that he did try to visit his advisor on several
occasions but found his door shut. Later, it was determined his
advisor was moonlighting as a term paper writer in order to make ends
meet.
Understanding
While the commission understands the advisor's problem, we are at
a loss to explain why he did not seek advice from his dean. The
advisor, in a friend of the court letter, stated that he did try to visit
his dean on several occasions but found him unavailable. Later it was
determined his dean was on a lecture circuit trying to raise scholarship
money for the medical microbiology program.
The panel recommends that W-2 be given a suspended sentence, a
new advisor, and five bucks for out-of-pocket expenses. Also, his
advisor has been requested to cease his moonlighting, as his presence
on the labor market threatens those members of the panel who,
reluctantly, also moonlight to make ends meet.
