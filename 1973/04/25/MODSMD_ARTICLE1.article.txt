# Nixon May Tap Rogers To Overhaul White House
## 
### Associated Press 
WASHINGTON - ABC News reported
yesterday that President' Nixon has
called upon Secretary of State William
P. Rogers to overhaul the White House
staff in the wake of the Watergate
case. A presidential spokesman denied
it.
ABC correspondent Bill Gill said
Nixon wants Rogers to help restore
"an impeccable integrity" to the White
House operation.
Talking with reporters en route to
Washington from Key Biscayne, Fla.,
last night, White House Press Secretary
Ronald L. Ziegler said there was "no
discussion at all along that line" in a
telephone conversation between Nixon
and Rogers.
Ziegler also said that Nixon "has
made no decision at all regarding staff
resignations" that might arise from
Watergate.
Telephone Conversation
Gill, who reported that he had been
told Rogers conferred secretly with
Nixon in Florida over the weekend,
later said that their conversation was
by telephone.
A State Department spokesman
said Rogers spent the weekend in
Williamsburg, Va.
Gill quoted White House sources as
saying they expect the President to
announce that Rogers will personally
direct an overhaul of the President's
staff.
Rogers Denies Role
Another administration official said
he had talked to Rogers by telephone
and that the secretary told him he
hadn't been asked to play such a role
in the Watergate aftermath.
A spokesman for the State
Department would not comment

yesterday on the report that Rogers
had been tapped for an administration
housecleaning, which followed rumors
that Nixon planned just such a move.
Others mentioned in speculation were
John B. Connally and Melvin R. Laird,
members of the Nixon cabinet in his
first term.
Meanwhile, Presidential aide John
D. Ehrlichman and former Nixon
campaign chief Clark MacGregor
disagreed yesterday over whether an
internal investigation was made in the
campaign organization last August
when the affair was just unfolding.
Aide Wanted Disclosure
Ehrlichman said he proposed then
"the fullest disclosure" to MacGregor
and to the whole planning group, but
the in-house investigation was not
made. His comments were reported in
the Washington Star-News, then
confirmed by the White House.
MacGregor said no such
investigation was proposed to him.
Deputy press secretary Gerald L.
Warren confirmed in Florida that John
J. Wilson, the lawyer for Ehrlichman
and White House chief of staff H.R.
Haldeman, met with President Nixon
last Thursday at the White House.
Nixon's Calls
He also said Nixon had made Easter
Sunday telephone calls to Haldeman,
Ehriichman and presidential counsel
John W. Dean 111 to "wish them well
on Easter."
Wilson was spotted by newsmen at
the White House again yesterday while
the President still was in Florida. Later
he showed up at the federal
courthouse where the Watergate grand
jury was meeting, but said the visit was
in connection with another case.
DeVan Shumway, spokesman for

the Committee for the Re-election of
the President, also was at the
courthouse meeting with prosecutor
Earl J. Silbert.
Not Told Truth
Asked if he now felt he had been ,
deceived into issuing his past denials'
that staff members of the Nixon
campaign were involved in the affair,
Shumway said "I think I was not fully
told the truth at all times."
MacGregor issued a statement in \
response to Ehrlichman's
that he had wanted an in-house
investigation of the re-election
committee.
"At no time during the months of
August 1972 did any Nixon
administration official request
MacGregor to conduct any Watergate
investigation," he said.

ALMOST ONE YEAR AGO TODAY—Newcomers may not believe that over 200 people could gather in White Plaza for
any reason. Over 1200 massed there on April 21, 1972 as part of a protest of the escalation of U.S. bombing in Viet
Nam. 205 people, including 116 Stanford students, were arrested the next day for blocking traffic at the corner of El
Camino Real and Embarcadero Road.
