# Exploitation, Broken Treaties
## Violence Against Latin Indians 
### 
Arturo G. Munoz

Various influential Latin
American intellectuals have stated
that one of the salient positive
features of Latin American
society is the widespread mixture
between whites, Indians and
Negroes. Jose Vasconcelos, for
example, argues that this mixed
Latin American "race" is the race
of the future since it unites the
three major races of Mankind. It is
a concrete expression of the
equality and brotherhood of men.
In keeping with this line of
thought, Latin American
intellectuals have frequently
pointed disparagingly to the
treatment of the Indians in the
United States as a prime example
of the triumph of racism and
materialism over humanism.
North Americans themselves are
increasingly willing to accept this
judgment, and there has been a
basic reevaluation of the westward
expansion of the United States in
terms of the resulting genocide of
the native Indian population.
Yet, whether or not it is
assumed that Latin American
culture is more humanistic and
spiritual than North American
culture, there is incontrovertible

evidence that unassimilated tribal
Indians in South America are
currently being exploited or
exterminated as part of a process
of economic development and
national expansion similar to that
experienced by the United States
in the 19th century.
South America
The "International Work
Group for Indigenous Affairs,"
with headquarters in Copenhagen,
is an international coalition of
writers and social scientists
devoted to researching and
publicizing the contemporary
plight of the tribal Indians in
South America. The general
pattern which emerges from the
research of this Work Group is the
following: the historic lack of
transportation and
communication in South America,
coupled with the existence of
formidable geographic barriers,
produced an isolated environment
in which numerous small Indian
groups were able to maintain their
tribal lands and their traditional
way of life; h u
In our own day, however,
modern technology has vitiated
the barriers to these isolated areas

and the population explosion has
precipitated a stream of settlers
and adventurers which is
overrunning Indian lands
throughout the South American
wilderness area. Thus, as the 20th
century progresses there is an
increase of frontier conflict
between tribal Indians and
national settlers.
South American governments
with this frontier problem are in a
paradoxical situation since they
are generally committed to the
protection of the Indians while at
the same time they pursue policies
of economic growth and national
expansion which necessarily entail
the exploitation of Indian lands.
Many observers believe that it
makes little difference what the
policy of the government is since
much of this frontier conflict
takes place outside the effective
domain of the national
government.
Expansion In Cuiba
One of the most publicized
recent examples of uncontrolled
frontier expansion is in the Cuiba
(or Guahibo) Indian territory of
the Colombian "llanos," where
cattle ranching is currently being
developed. Alfredo Torres,
executive secretary of the
"Asociacion pro-Indigenas de
Colombia," has travelled in the
Cuiba territory and, in the
January 17, 1973, El Espectador,
he gives various accounts of
unprovoked shootings of Indians
by ranchers, rapes of Indian
women, and forced labor without
pay on ranches.
The most notorious case of
violence against the Cuibas is that
of a group of cowhands who
readily admitted to massacring a
band of 16 Indian men, women
and children. At the preliminaries
for their trial, reported in the May
12, 1972, El Tiempo, they
expressed genuine surprise at the
fact that it was a legal crime to
kill Indians. "I didn't know it was
bad to kill Indians," protested one
of the cowhands, while another
defendant added that out in the
frontier uncivilized Indians were
classified as "wild animals." At
the end of their trial, the
cowhands were acquitted on
grounds of " invincible
ignorance," however, a second
trial has been ordered due to
public pressure.
The Brazilian authorities, still

sensitive over the international
scandals in 1968 caused by the
revelations of massacres of Indians
carried out by the Indian
Protection Service, are striving to
avoid an uncontrolled frontier
situation such as that in the Cuiba
territory. While still making a top
priority of the Trans-Amazon
highway and the economic
development of the interior, the
Brazilians have endeavored to
relocate the tribal Indians in the
path of this progress on
reservations where they are
expected to adjust eventually to
modernization.
No Protection
Roberto Cardoso de Oliveira
and other Brazilian
anthropologists, however, have
criticized the manner in which the
reservation system is carried out.
He argues that the reservations
have failed to protect the rights of
the Indians and that, rather than
helping the Indians adjust to
modernization, they have merely
prolonged the process of
extinction. Sandy Davis and Terry
Turner, two American
anthropologists who have recently
returned from doing field work in
the Upper Xingu, have both stated
that the whole idea of reservations
is currently being contradicted by
the policy of building roads across
some of the Indian reserves, such
as the road cutting across the
Kayapo reserve administered by
the famed Villas Boas brothers.
These roads will inevitably
bring settlers and land speculators
which will exacerbate the frontier
conflict. Moreover, thousands of
settlers have already invaded
various reservations, such as the
Karaja reserve at El Bananal, and
they have not yet been evicted by
the authorities. It appears that the
Indians in Brazil, like the Indians
in the United States, are being
pushed along a trail of broken
treaties by the national
authorities.
The frontier conflict in South
America raises several questions
such as whether tribal Indians are
necessarily doomed to extinction
by modernization, whether the
South American governments are
making sufficient efforts to
safeguard the rights of their
Indians, and what the role of U.S.
investment is. These and other
issues will be discussed at a
conference sponsored by the
Stanford American Indian
Organization on Thursday, April
26, at 4.15. The conference will
be attended by guest speakers and
will be held in the Tresidder Large
Lounge.
