Information About
Dogs And Cats

I recently read of the campaign
to enforce the Santa Clara County
leash law because of the problems
associated with dogs running loose
on campus. The leash law is for
the protection of the pet: to
prevent dogs from biting people,
to prevent dogs from being
poisoned, being hit by cars or
being stolen. A dog license gives
the dog rights which are not
extended to a dog not wearing
one. A dog wearing a license can
be returned to the owner in case
of loss.
A dog license and/or I.D. tag
can save your pet from being
killed because they establish that
your pet is not a stray but an
owned pet.
1 would like to take this
opportunity to make your readers
aware that there is a serious side
effect of allowing their pets to run
at will, and that is unwanted
litters resulting from random
breeding. There is a national pet
population explosion which has
reached epidemic proportions in
California. The humane society
has stated they receive as many as
300 dogs and cats a day and 90
percent of them are destroyed
simply because not enough homes
exist.
Untold numbers of unwanted
cats and are abandoned by
cruel, thoughtless people in the
mistaken belief that cats and dogs
can survive on their own or that
some kind person will take them
in. Nothing could be further from
the truth because these animals
have become so domesticated and
dependent on humans for care
and protection they are totally
unable to fend for themselves.
Spaying the female and
neutering the male is the only
positive and safe method for
preventing unwanted litters. There
is no magical pill, vaccine, or lUD
available. Why should you spay or
neuter your dog or cat? Because a
spayed or neutered pet is
healthier. There will be no
possibility of infections or cancer
of the reproductive organs.
Because a spayed or neutered
pet is a better pet. Male dogs and
cats will not fight among
themselves over females. (Fewer
vet bills!) Females will not come
into "heat" and will not attract
males from blocks away. Because
dog license fees are less if your
dog is spayed. Over the lifetime of
your pet this savings will pay for
the spaying operation.
Because there is a pet
population explosion. Did you
know there are 150,000 unwanted
homeless dogs, cats, puppies and
kittens destroyed YEARLY on
the Peninsula? Don't let YOUR
pet contribute to this problem.
In recent years the cost of
spaying has been beyond the
financial reach of a great many
pet owners. Now, however, there
is a specialized Clinic with low
prices. This is the Santa Clara
County Low-Cost Spay/Neuter
Clinic which is sponsored by the
County Health Department,
Animal Control Division. Prices at
the low-cost clinic are: $20 to
spay a female dog or cat; $15 to
neuter a male dog and $10 to
neuter a male cat.
You must live in Santa! Clara
County to use this clinic and all
dogs must be licenseid. A
distemper vaccination is included
in the above prices if your pet has
not been vaccinated in the last
two years. Do your pet, yourself
and the community a favor, have
your pet spayed or neutered. For
further information, call Santa
Clara County Animal Control:
286-3016.

into "heat" and will not attract
males from blocks away. Because
dog license fees are less if your
dog is spayed. Over the lifetime of
your pet this savings will pay for
the spaying operation.
Because there is a pet
population explosion. Did you
know there are 150,000 unwanted
homeless dogs, cats, puppies and
kittens destroyed YEARLY on
the Peninsula? Don't let YOUR
pet contribute to this problem.
In recent years the cost of
spaying has been beyond the
financial reach of a great many
pet owners. Now, however, there
is a specialized Clinic with low
prices. This is the Santa Clara
County Low-Cost Spay/Neuter
Clinic which is sponsored by the
County Health Department,
Animal Control Division. Prices at
the low-cost clinic are: $20 to
spay a female dog or cat; $15 to
neuter a male dog and $10 to
neuter a male cat.
You must live in Santa! Clara
County to use this clinic and all
dogs must be licenseid. A
distemper vaccination is included
in the above prices if your pet has
not been vaccinated in the last
two years. Do your pet, yourself
and the community a favor, have
your pet spayed or neutered. For
further information, call Santa
Clara County Animal Control:
286-3016.

Information About
Dogs And Cats

I recently read of the campaign
to enforce the Santa Clara County
leash law because of the problems
associated with dogs running loose
on campus. The leash law is for
the protection of the pet: to
prevent dogs from biting people,
to prevent dogs from being
poisoned, being hit by cars or
being stolen. A dog license gives
the dog rights which are not
extended to a dog not wearing
one. A dog wearing a license can
be returned to the owner in case
of loss.
A dog license and/or I.D. tag
can save your pet from being
killed because they establish that
your pet is not a stray but an
owned pet.
1 would like to take this
opportunity to make your readers
aware that there is a serious side
effect of allowing their pets to run
at will, and that is unwanted
litters resulting from random
breeding. There is a national pet
population explosion which has
reached epidemic proportions in
California. The humane society
has stated they receive as many as
300 dogs and cats a day and 90
percent of them are destroyed
simply because not enough homes
exist.
Untold numbers of unwanted
cats and are abandoned by
cruel, thoughtless people in the
mistaken belief that cats and dogs
can survive on their own or that
some kind person will take them
in. Nothing could be further from
the truth because these animals
have become so domesticated and
dependent on humans for care
and protection they are totally
unable to fend for themselves.
Spaying the female and
neutering the male is the only
positive and safe method for
preventing unwanted litters. There
is no magical pill, vaccine, or lUD
available. Why should you spay or
neuter your dog or cat? Because a
spayed or neutered pet is
healthier. There will be no
possibility of infections or cancer
of the reproductive organs.
Because a spayed or neutered
pet is a better pet. Male dogs and
cats will not fight among
themselves over females. (Fewer
vet bills!) Females will not come
into "heat" and will not attract
males from blocks away. Because
dog license fees are less if your
dog is spayed. Over the lifetime of
your pet this savings will pay for
the spaying operation.
