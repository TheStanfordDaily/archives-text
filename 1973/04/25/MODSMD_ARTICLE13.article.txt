# Daniel Heifetz Performs For Enthusiastic Audience
## 
### DANIEL BRENNER 
Classical music concerts scare people, who
like myself, lack the required 18th and 19th
century musical background with which to
score esoteric points during intermission.
So it was a particular treat to enjoy the
engrossing, energetic performance of 24-year
old Daniel Heifetz last Friday evening at
Dinkelspiel. Here was classical music
performed as its creators must have wished —
with compulsive enthusiasm and precision.
Heifetz, in my opinion, doesn't play the
violin — he seizes and manipulates it with a
gusto matched only by the enthusiastic
response accorded him by his listeners.
Accompanied by a compelementary yet
distinctive pianist named Anne Epperson, the
young virtuoso made one feel that he
considered this concert as a special one, albeit
it was one of a long chain of one-nighters.
Heifetz, who is no kin to the great Jascha,
began with a Ciaconna by Tommaso Vitali

(born ca. 1665) which for me was the
highlight of the evening. The Vitali piece
maintains a melodic thematic movement
which Heifetz artfully elicited in his rendition.
Of particular merit was Heifetz's rendition
of Bela Bartok's Rumanian Dances. Bartok's
work is a musician's headache, leapfrogging as
it does between tonals and antonals. Yet
Heifetz played these difficult passages with
considerable ease. And by his informal
explanation of what each movement of the
piece represented, he added to the listener's
sensory awareness of the composer's musical
message.
The three standing ovations which the
performer received were gratiously rewarded
with encores, one of which was the celebrated
Dance Espagnol. For those of us who are only
occasional listeners of "Radio Concert Hall,"
Dance Espagnol was a familiar acquaintance,
played with a lively flair by the
white-tie-and-tails violinist.

Included also on the formal program were
Franck's Sonata in A major; Bach's Chaconne
in D minor; and Ravel's Tzigane.
Heifetz, who had arrived the day before
the performace from a cross-continent tour of
Europe, appeared relaxed at Dink, although
his amiable, nay at times humble, attitude did
not deter him from performing with intensity.
Under the direction of Hurok Concerts, the
career of Heifetz has been allowed to flower.
And the young performer, whose desire to
meet listeners on their level has led him to
performances in prisons from New York to
California, is happy with the development of
what promises to be an important career for
performing arts in America.
Those who missed Heifetz this time
around, should not make the same mistake
the next time around. Even for the individual
only distantly familiar with classical sounds,
Heifetz will involve you in the music.

Franck's Sonata in A major; Bach's Chaconne
in D minor; and Ravel's Tzigane.
Heifetz, who had arrived the day before
the performace from a cross-continent tour of
Europe, appeared relaxed at Dink, although
his amiable, nay at times humble, attitude did
not deter him from performing with intensity.
Under the direction of Hurok Concerts, the
career of Heifetz has been allowed to flower.
And the young performer, whose desire to
meet listeners on their level has led him to
performances in prisons from New York to
California, is happy with the development of
what promises to be an important career for
performing arts in America.
Those who missed Heifetz this time
around, should not make the same mistake
the next time around. Even for the individual
only distantly familiar with classical sounds,
Heifetz will involve you in the music.

DANIEL HEIFETZ — A violin performance by Daniel Heifetz took place last Friday evening in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium. He played classical pieces as well as works by Bartok. For a review of the
performance, see article at right.
Classical music concerts scare people, who
like myself, lack the required 18th and 19th
century musical background with which to
score esoteric points during intermission.
So it was a particular treat to enjoy the
engrossing, energetic performance of 24-year
old Daniel Heifetz last Friday evening at
Dinkelspiel. Here was classical music
performed as its creators must have wished —
with compulsive enthusiasm and precision.
Heifetz, in my opinion, doesn't play the
violin — he seizes and manipulates it with a
gusto matched only by the enthusiastic
response accorded him by his listeners.
Accompanied by a compelementary yet
distinctive pianist named Anne Epperson, the
young virtuoso made one feel that he
considered this concert as a special one, albeit
it was one of a long chain of one-nighters.
Heifetz, who is no kin to the great Jascha,
began with a Ciaconna by Tommaso Vitali

(born ca. 1665) which for me was the
highlight of the evening. The Vitali piece
maintains a melodic thematic movement
which Heifetz artfully elicited in his rendition.
Of particular merit was Heifetz's rendition
of Bela Bartok's Rumanian Dances. Bartok's
work is a musician's headache, leapfrogging as
it does between tonals and antonals. Yet
Heifetz played these difficult passages with
considerable ease. And by his informal
explanation of what each movement of the
piece represented, he added to the listener's
sensory awareness of the composer's musical
message.
The three standing ovations which the
performer received were gratiously rewarded
with encores, one of which was the celebrated
Dance Espagnol. For those of us who are only
occasional listeners of "Radio Concert Hall,"
Dance Espagnol was a familiar acquaintance,
played with a lively flair by the
white-tie-and-tails violinist.

Included also on the formal program were
Franck's Sonata in A major; Bach's Chaconne
in D minor; and Ravel's Tzigane.
