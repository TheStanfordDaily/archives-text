# Doc, Merle Watson Blend Variety Of Musical Styles
## 
### JAY HARLOW 
Doc and Merle Watson
appeared last week at the
Boarding House in San Francisco,
performing, in Doc's words, "just
some good country pickin' and
singin'." Their show was
American folk music at its best —
a blend of many different vocal
and instrumental styles by a
couple of first rate musicians.
They began Wednesday night
with a version of the Casey Jones
story, "Freight Train Boogie,"
with Doc on guitar, harmonica,
and vocals, and son Merle on
guitar. Next was a funny song
dedicated to "lazy people

everywhere," entitled "Life Gets
Tedious, Don't It?"
Both Doc and Merle switched
freely between flat-picking and
finger-picking, showing a strong
background in many styles of
American music. Merle's guitar on
"Goin' Down the Road Feelin'
Bad" showed the country blues
influence of Mississippi John
Hurt; he was equally at home
playing bluegrass banjo and
"Matchbox Blues" by Blind
Lemon Jefferson. They also
performed more recent works,
including Tom Paxton's "Last
Thing on My Mind," and Melre
Travis' arrangement of an old

spiritual, "I Am A Pilgrim."
Relaxed Mood
Throughout the set, the mood
was relaxed and easy, as reflected
both in the picking and in Doc's
unpretentious vocal style. Doc
filled in between the songs with
jokes, stories about the composers
of each song, and comments
about Merle's playing.
He seemed genuinely
concerned that everyone was
having a good time. From the
reaction of the audience, which
was mostly but not entirely young
people, I would say he was
successful.
The Watsons shared the bill

with High Country, a bluegrass
band from Marin Country which
could easily headline by itself.
Their instrumentation was strictly
traditional with fiddle, mandolin,
banjo, guitar, and bass, and most
of their tunes were bluegrass
standards with a few originals
thrown in.
Each of the three lead
instruments did short but
impressive leads on most of the
numbers, and lead vocals were by
guitarist Chris Boutwell, with help
from mandolinist Butch Waller
and bassist Larry Cohea. Waller's
solo on "Beaumont Rag" was
especially good, as was fiddler Ed
Neff on "Grey Eagle." Other
highlights of the set were 'Truck
Drivin' Man" and "Muleskinner
Blues," with Boutwell doing
vocals and yodels.
Concluding Song
They finished with "Foggy
Mountain Breakdown," a Flat &
Scruggs banjo-picker's tune
featuring Bruce Nemerov. This
song is probably best known as
the theme song from the movie
"Bonnie and Clyde."
"Country music" has been
used to describe all sorts of styles,
from jug bands to the Grand Ole
Opry to the New Riders of the
Purple Sage. If you are confused, I
suggest that you try an evening
with Doc and Merle Watson.
You will find it a sampler of
the best of white American folk
music, with a liberal sprinkling of
black country blues influence.
And for a more thorough
treatment of a particular style,
listen to High Country, as good an
introduction to bluegrass as
anybody around today.

music, with a liberal sprinkling of
black country blues influence.
And for a more thorough
treatment of a particular style,
listen to High Country, as good an
introduction to bluegrass as
anybody around today.
Doc and Merle Watson
appeared last week at the
Boarding House in San Francisco,
performing, in Doc's words, "just
some good country pickin' and
singin'." Their show was
American folk music at its best —
a blend of many different vocal
and instrumental styles by a
couple of first rate musicians.
They began Wednesday night
with a version of the Casey Jones
story, "Freight Train Boogie,"
with Doc on guitar, harmonica,
and vocals, and son Merle on
guitar. Next was a funny song
dedicated to "lazy people

everywhere," entitled "Life Gets
Tedious, Don't It?"
Both Doc and Merle switched
freely between flat-picking and
finger-picking, showing a strong
background in many styles of
American music. Merle's guitar on
"Goin' Down the Road Feelin'
Bad" showed the country blues
influence of Mississippi John
Hurt; he was equally at home
playing bluegrass banjo and
"Matchbox Blues" by Blind
Lemon Jefferson. They also
performed more recent works,
including Tom Paxton's "Last
Thing on My Mind," and Melre
Travis' arrangement of an old

spiritual, "I Am A Pilgrim."
Relaxed Mood
Throughout the set, the mood
was relaxed and easy, as reflected
both in the picking and in Doc's
unpretentious vocal style. Doc
filled in between the songs with
jokes, stories about the composers
of each song, and comments
about Merle's playing.
He seemed genuinely
concerned that everyone was
having a good time. From the
reaction of the audience, which
was mostly but not entirely young
people, I would say he was
successful.
The Watsons shared the bill

with High Country, a bluegrass
band from Marin Country which
could easily headline by itself.
Their instrumentation was strictly
traditional with fiddle, mandolin,
banjo, guitar, and bass, and most
of their tunes were bluegrass
standards with a few originals
thrown in.
Each of the three lead
instruments did short but
impressive leads on most of the
numbers, and lead vocals were by
guitarist Chris Boutwell, with help
from mandolinist Butch Waller
and bassist Larry Cohea. Waller's
solo on "Beaumont Rag" was
especially good, as was fiddler Ed
Neff on "Grey Eagle." Other
highlights of the set were 'Truck
Drivin' Man" and "Muleskinner
Blues," with Boutwell doing
vocals and yodels.
Concluding Song
They finished with "Foggy
Mountain Breakdown," a Flat &
Scruggs banjo-picker's tune
featuring Bruce Nemerov. This
song is probably best known as
the theme song from the movie
"Bonnie and Clyde."
"Country music" has been
used to describe all sorts of styles,
from jug bands to the Grand Ole
Opry to the New Riders of the
Purple Sage. If you are confused, I
suggest that you try an evening
with Doc and Merle Watson.
You will find it a sampler of
the best of white American folk
music, with a liberal sprinkling of
black country blues influence.

treatment of a particular style,
listen to High Country, as good an
introduction to bluegrass as
anybody around today.
