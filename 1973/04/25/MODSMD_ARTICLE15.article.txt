# 'Journey' Recommended
## 
### RUST EDDIE 
Following its superior "Gala" debut on the first
two weekends in April, Dance Spectrum's second
program, "The Journey," presented last weekend in
Lone Mountain College's Wabe Theater seemed the
wrong moment for Spectrum director Carlos
Carvajal to take a bow.
The pertinacity of Carvajal's 18-performance, six
week season at Lone Mountain College though,
indicates that Dance Spectrum must have fans — to
whom this show is recommended.
"The Journey," a cyclical trilogy choreographed
by Carlos Carvajal consists of three dances, "The
Way," "Orfeus," and"The Awakening." These
three ballets concern Orfeus' mythical journey
through the labyrinth.
"The Way," a lengthy expose which stretches
from the hero's (Dudley Brooks) birth to manhood
conveys, by choreographic confusion, the
pandemonium to maturity. On stage rollerskating
amplifies this tumult. Orfeus' attention remains
largely unfocused until near the end when love,
taking form as Euridice (Carolyn Houser) conquers.
"Orfeus," the evening's best work, followed.
Pairing Blanch Phillips Howard's bronze sculpture to

his own choreography, Carvajal forcefully interprets
the struggle between thought and feeling. Hermes
(Sulpicio Wagner) contorting thought, vainly
attempts to dissuade the hero from pursuing his
love.
World Premiere
"Orfeus" had its world premiere last weekend
and"The Awakening" was taken from a 1968
sketch. Dealing with the hero's spiritual rebirth,
"The Awakening" concluded "The Journey."
Caught in the crossfire of Folsommen's
monotonously futuristic costumes and Warner
Jepson's electronic tape, "Orfeus" suffered.
It is doubtful whether any of these dances except
for "Orfeus" could stand alone. The audience is
hardly conscious of the point of departure seeing
these three works performed together.
Not only do principals vary but so does the
music. Carvajal choreographed "The Way" to music
by Toru Takemitsu, "Orfeus" to a score by Maki
Ishii and"The Awakening" to a commissioned score
by Warner Jepson. At times everything seems to be
on the move except the plot.
"The Journey" will be repeated next weekend.
"Grand Circus" will begin on May 3.
