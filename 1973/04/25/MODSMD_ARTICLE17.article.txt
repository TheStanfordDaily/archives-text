# U.S. Collegiate Invitational Opens Tomorrow
## Cards Host Huge Golf Field 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
The Stanford golf course will
probably resemble Maples Pavilion
on registration day tomorrow, as
204 players representing 34 teams
begin play in the sixth annual U.S.
Collegiate Invitational golf
tournament.
Tee-off times start at the
ungodly hour of 5:46 a.m. and
continue through 2:38 p.m. to
accommodate the huge field.
Stanford coach Bud Finger boasts
that the tournament features the
"biggest field in collegiate golf,"

but admits that the 34 teams
represent "quantity not quality."
In fact this year's U.S.
Collegiate Invitational should
develop into a Stanford vs. San
Jose State dual match with a
gallery of 192 players. The Cards
and Spartans are the only entrants
which could be legitimately
considered among the top teams
on the West Coast, although
Washington, Washington State,
UC Santa Barbara, or Cal State
Northridge could possibly
challenge for the team title.

The rest of the field is littered
with a conglomeration of teams
like Cal State-Dominguez Hills,
Southern Oregon College, Hawaii,
St. Mary's, San Francisco State,
etc. None of those institutions
have ever been known for their
contributions to professional golf.
Stanislaus Hackers
The clear-cut choice for last
place is Stanislaus State, a team
which could probably lose to 95
percent of the high school teams
in the United States. Two weeks

ago at the University of Pacific
Invitational, Stanislaus finished a
convincing ninth in a nine-team
field, 107 shots behind
tournament winner Fresno State.
Stanislaus is led by Stan
Lacore, who last year made some
of the spectators at Stanford feel
right at home by shooting a 33
over par 104 in the first round of
the tournament.
While the majority of the field
digs divots on Stanford's fairways,
Finger's Cardinal players will try
to hold their concentration long
enough to win the tourney for the
fifth time in six years. Last year
the Cards won by seven shots over
a slightly stronger field as all six
Stanford golfers scored between
222 and 226 for the 54 hole
distance.
Four Return
Four of those players return
this year to defend the title. Aly
Trompas, Denny Colvin, Dave
Baskins, and Conrad Nilmeier all
played on the varsity during last
year's tourney. George Pettinger
and Bob Chapman will join those
four in the Cardinal lineup.
Finger also will enter a junior
varsity team and a freshman
squad. Freshman Bob Steele, Bob
Harrington, John Beers, and Steve
Oliverio could possibly move up
to the varsity for future
tournaments if they perform well
this week. Both the JV and
freshman teams have a good
chance to finish in the top 10, and
the JV could possibly manage a
top five finish.
Trompas, Baskins, Colvin, and
Nilmeier could all be rated as top
challengers for the individual title,
as well as Mark Lye, Jim Knoll,
Phil Barry, and Don Thames of
the Spartans. Other possible
individual contenders include
John Beutler and Jeff Urban of
Washington State, Washington's
Jim Irwin and Gary Sater, UC
Santa Barbara's Scott Hoyt and
Larry Austin, and Steve Van
Herpe of Cal State Northridge.
The tournament runs from
tomorrow through Saturday, with
18 holes scheduled for each day.
After Friday's second round the
field will be trimmed to the low
16 teams and all individuals
within 10 shots of the leader.

THE SAND MAN — Denny Colvin hopes to stay out of sand traps this week during the U.S. Collegiate
Golf tournament, which opens tomorrow on the Stanford course. Last week the consistent senior from
Yakima, Washington finished 13th in a field of 156 at the Western Intercollegiates in Santa Cruz, carding
rounds of 76-75-75 for a 226 total.
