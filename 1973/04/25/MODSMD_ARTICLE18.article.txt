## 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
Familiar foes Stanford, USC,
and UCLA will square off once
again at the Ojai Intercollegiate
tennis tournament Thursday
through Sunday at Ojai.
The tourney can be classed as
"round three" in the five round
struggle for supremacy between
the three tennis powers. Round
one, at the National Indoor
Championships in Madison, was
won by Stanford. Round two, the
series of dual matches between
the three schools, has ended in a
stand-off from Stanford's point of
view.
The Cardinals are defending
champions in Ojai's Pac-8 division,
which is the feature of the

tournament. Last year, they won
their first Ojai team title ever by
one point when Sandy Mayer beat
USC's Raul Ramirez in the final
round of singles play. The Cards
also are defending the doubles
title won last year by Rick Fisher
and Gery Groslimond.
Ramirez and Mayer are both
entered again this season, and the
pair is favored to play in Sunday's
singles championship match.
Team honors will be decided in
the same way they are in the
NCAA tourney, with each
individual win counting as one
team point.
The Stanford lineup will be the
same as the one which beat USC
and UCLA over the weekend,

with the single exception of the
third doubles spot, where John
Whitlinger will team with Pat
DuPre instead of Chip Fisher.
In addition, Paul Sidone and
James "Chico" Hagey will play
both singles and doubles in the
non-scoring Open division.
In a tune-up match yesterday,
Stanford, behind John
Whitlinger's 6-0, 6-1 first singles
win over Andy Moffat, dumped
San Jose State 8-1. Stanford's
record is now 14-2.
