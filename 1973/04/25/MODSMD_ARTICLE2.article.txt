# O'Grady ASSU President—Finally
## 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
Kevin O'Grady will be the new
president of the ASSU—finally.
In a situation liberally sprinkled
with elements of low comedy, the
ASSU Senate last night reversed
Elections Commissioner Mike Nilsson's
decision to hold a runoff election
between O'Grady and Vice President
Peter Van Petten, who ran a distant
second in last week's primary.
Van Petten withdrew from the race
last weekend, and runoff ballots
printed yesterday included a notation
to that effect.
Nilsson had reversed himself

numerous times over the weekend. On
Thursday night, he indicated that
there would be no runoff if Van
Petten withdrew.
During a of intense, and at
times heated, negotiations with
representatives of several slates, other
solutions were considered, adopted,
and ultimately discarded.
Various Solutions
On Monday, Nilsson announced
that a runoff would be held with just
one name on the ballot — O'Grady's.
Yesterday morning, he reached an
agreement with representatives of the
Van Petten and O'Grady slates, as well

as Senate Chairman Rocky Barber, to
run Van Petten's name along with the
disclaimer of candidacy.
But the Senate, by a 10-7 vote,
used its power of constitutional
interpretation to throw out that
solution and, in effect, cancel the
election.
Thursday Confirmation
Barber has called a meeting for
noon Thursday to confirm the results
of the election, thus allowing O'Grady
to take office immediately.
All parties seemed reasonably
pleased by the Senate's action last
night, including Nilsson, who will no
longer have to worry about another
election.
The negotiations leading up to the
Senate vote created a dense aura of
confusion around the entire matter.
'Farcical' Election
Incumbent President Scott Burke,
representing Van Petten, didn't want
Van Petten's name on the runoff
ballot. Because the ASSU constitution
and by-laws require that a president be

elected by a majority, Nilsson was
prepared Monday to run an election
with only O'Grady on the ballot —
which he termed "farcical" even as he
announced it.
Although the third-highest
vote-getters in the primary —
Libertarians Judy Gans and Buzz
Thompson — were willing to take Van
Petten's place in the runoff, O'Grady
supporters argued that the by-laws call
for a runoff only between the top two
vote-getters.
In the end, Burke agreed to allow
Van Petten's name onto the ballot, as
long as the disclaimer of candidacy
appeared.
But the Senate ruled last night that
a section of the by-laws concerning the
withdrawal of a nomination also
covered withdrawal of candidacy from
a runoff.
Final, complete returns released
yesterday showed that O'Grady
received about 49.8 percent of the
primary vote — just nine votes short of
a majority.
