Lon Nol Reorganizes Government
PHNOM PENH — Cambodian President Lon Nol has
announced the formation of a four-member "high
political council" to govern Cambodia in what he termed
a "search for peace." He suspended the National
Assembly for six months.
The announcement came in radio broadcast to the
nation a week after the resignation of the 15-member
cabinet.
In addition to Lon Nol, members of the new
government will be General Sisowath Sirik Matak, who is
former prime minister and leader of the Opposition
Republican Party, former Chief of State Cheng Heng, and
former Chairman of the National Assembly In Tarn.
Sirak Matak, extremely popular with the American
embassy, is credited with masterminding the 1970 coup
which ousted Prince Norodom Sihanouk as Cambodian
Chief of State.
Observers say the formation of the "high political
council" is the most significant change in government in
Cambodia since the overthrow of Sihanouk.
Witness Says 'Papers' Aided Reds
LOS ANGELES — A former Marine general who is now a
news executive testified against Daniel Ellsberg and
Anthony Russo yesterday, saying a segment of the
Pentagon Papers could have aided the Communist Chinese
when the defendants copied it.
Retired Lt. Gen. Victor Krulak's government
testimony contradicted a defense witness, Rep. Paul N.
McCloskey, R—Calif. Krulak then underwent a probing
cross-examination by defense attorneys challenging the
substance of his testimony and implying he is biased
against the defendants.
Krulak, who is director of editorial and news policies
for the Copley newspaper group, was a Marine for 34
years and acknowledged when questioned that his
nickname is "Brute."
He differed strongly with McCloskey's testimony that a
volume of the Pentagon Papers detailing the 1965 Marine
landing at Da Nang was long out of date and useless to an
enemy when Ellsberg and Russo copied it in 1969.
Krulak said the volume told more than just what
happened at Da Nang. He said it revealed that the landing
was just the first phase of a contingency plan which
anticipated possible reactions to an "overt" act by the
Red Chinese in Vietnam. The witness said such data
would help the Red Chinese "target their intelligence"
and would simplify intelligence gathering for them.
However, Krulak told prosecutor Warren Reese he
doesn't know whether information about these plans was
"in the public doman" in 1969. "I don't think so," he
added.
The diminutive Krulak, who frequently paused and
covered his eyes while he considered questions, spent
most of his testimony disputing McCloskey's description
of an elaborate military exercise which Krulak
commanded.
The exercise around Camp Pendleton, Calif., in 1964
concerned possible U.S. "counter-insurgency" attacks in a
small country threatened by Communist takeover by a
bordering country. McCloskey had said this was a
rehearsal for the landing at Da Nang in March 1965 and
said he played the role of then ambassador to South
Vietnam Henry Cabot Lodge.
Death Penalty Restoration Attempted
SACRAMENTO — A measure to impose a mandatory
death penalty in California for convicted hried killers,
police and prison guard slayers, and torture killers was
sent to the Senate floor yesterday after an

emotion-charged committee hearing.
The Senate Judiciary Committee voted 9-2 to approve
the bill after a three-hour-long hearing that was dotted
with angry verbal sparring between opponents and
supporters.
The California Supreme Court ruled Feb. 18, 1972 that
capital punishment violated the state constitutional ban
on cruel and unusual punishment. But a ballot initiative
last Nov. 7 amended the state Constitution to permit the
legislature to decree death for certain crimes.
A U.S. Supreme Court ruling last July is being
interpreted by some authorities as permitting capital
punishment only when there is no discretion, such as an
optional sentence of life imprisonment.
Sen. George Deukmejian, the Long Beach Republican
who authored the bill, testified that voters said "loudly
and clearly" that they wanted the death penalty
reinstated when they approved Prop. 17 by a 2-1 margin
in November.
'Racist' Group Fights In Prison
SAN QUENTIN — Six prisoners, including a Manson clan
member convicted of murder, fought with knives and
clubs inside San Quentin Prison yesterday in what an
officer said appeared to be a power struggle in the white
racist Aryan Brotherhood.
Three inmates were hospitalized with stab wounds and
broken bones and three more were treated at the prison
hospital and placed in segregation cells, said San Quentin
spokesman Lee Deßord.
"We've found two prison-made knives and two baseball
bats in the area where the incident took place," in the
prison's lower yard during the lunch period, Deßord
said.
Investigators determined that the six inmates were
"members or suspected members of the white supremist
Aryan Brotherhood prisoner organization," Deßord said.
"It appears it was an in-house struggle, possibly for
power."
The hospitalized inmates all were in satisfactory
condition.
They included Bobby Beausoleil, 25, a member of the
Charles Manson murder clan who was convicted in April
1970 of murdering musician Gary Hinman at his Malibu
home in July, 1969.
'Saturday Review' Files Bankruptcy
NEW YORK — Saturday Review, after less than two years
under new owners and editors, filed bankruptcy
proceedings yesterday.
Norman Cousins, its long-time head, announced he
would merge the publication with his new magazine,
World.
'The marriage is a natural one," said Cousins, who had
served as head of the Saturday Review for 30 years.
Saturday Review, taken over by a group headed by
John Veronis and Nicholas H. Charney in December,
1971, and Saturday Review Industries, Inc., listed debts as
$3.76 million greater than assets in their petitions in San
Francisco.
In San Francisco, Frederick S. Wyle, executive
committee chairman of the Saturday Review board, said
the magazine was not dead and he looked forward to a
quick reorganization under Cousins' editorship.
