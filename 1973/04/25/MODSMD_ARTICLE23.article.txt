# Provost Cites Vital ASSU Role
## 
### GLENN GARVIN 
Despite the low turnout in last
week's ASSU election, Provost William
Miller would be "disappointed" if
student government were abolished as
some candidates have proposed.
Only 2898 students voted in last
week's presidential primary that
apparently elected the Kevin O'Grady
slate. The turnout was the lowest in 10
years.
"I believe student government is
more important at certain times and
less important at other times. You
could say that about all governments,"
Miller said last night on KZSU's
"Campus Conference."
Miller said student government
played roles in both education and
communication at Stanford. He added
he thought the appointments ASSU
officers make to University
committees were a "particularly
effective" line of communication.
"Their role is more one of keeping
the administration honest than one of
action," Miller admitted. "But there is
opportunity [for student government]
to stress and foster innovation in
teaching, opportunity to stress and
foster quality in teaching."
One reporter noted the low voter
turnout probably indicated low
interest in the ASSU and asked if it
justified the $92,000 cost of running
the organization.
"I am not in a good position to put
a dollar value on the ASSU," Miller
replied. "It might be compared to
local elections. Even if there's a low
turnout, you might want to keep
them."
Miller said he was uncertain if a
number of proposals (including an
on-campus pub) by the o'Grady slate
could be implemented. "I'm not much
of an authority on that sort of thing.
They would get serious consideration.

A lot of things would have to come
into existence before they could
function," he said.

"The proposals were not given in
any detail, at least not in any detail
that I saw," Miller added.
