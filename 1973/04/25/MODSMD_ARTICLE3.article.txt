# Labor Election Scheduled For June 6
## 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
A National Labor Relations Board
examiner yesterday set June 6 as the
date for an upcoming election to
determine whether some 1,600
University employees will join a union.
The date was set following meetings
between the three parties to the
election yesterday in San Francisco.
The three parties, the University, the
United Stanford Employees
(USE), and the Stanford Joint
Council, reached an agreement on the
exact composition of the bargaining
unit after three hours of talk.
The Stanford Joint Council and the
USE are both seeking to organize the
employees, and will campaign until the
June 6 date.
Since USE has recently affiliated
with the Service Employees
International Union of the AFL-CIO,
this means that two AFL-CIO unions
will be on the June ballot, along with a
"no union" choice.
Doug Barton, University staff legal
counsel, said that there was "some
discussion but everyone was basically
content with [the agreement]."
Definition
The proposed bargaining unit has
been defined as follows:

"All regular staff, main employees,
laboratory staff personnel, custodians,
food service employees, audio-visual
operators, non-exempt computer
operations personnel, and book
preservers, who are employed [by the
University] in Northern California."
The bargaining unit excludes a large
number of classifications, including all
employees currently represented by a
union, all employees at Stanford
hospital, guards, supervisors, and other
employees.
Other Elections
In addition to the main election,
four other elections will be held on the
June 6 date, according to Barton.
These elections will be for three
groups of employees in Stanford Press
as well as meat cutters in the
commissary.
These employees will have the
option of voting for either of the two
slates seeking to represent the entire
group, the individual union seeking to
represent them, and the "no union"
choice.
The NLRB also decided that no
employee joining the labor group after
April 15 would be eligible to vote.
The election date which is on the
Thursday just prior to the beginning of

finals week, is somewhat later than the
Stanford Joint Council had wanted.
The parties agree that it is the earliest
date possible in order to insure
adequate time for campaigning.
If none of the three parties on the
main ballot receives a majority, a

ranoff election will be necessary
between the top two vote-getters.
If this happens, as it did last year
when the Teamsters lost to the "no
union" choice in a runoff, there may
be scheduling problems due to the
summer break.
