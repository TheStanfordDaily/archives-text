# 'Liaison' Winbigler Wins No Fame In Busy Job
## 
### MARK SIMONIAN 
"I see myself as a liaison between faculty and
administration. Basically I am here to serve and to help."
Not many students on campus know who he is. Not
many students know what he does. But he is a man who,
in the past, has served here as a speech, drama and
education professor, as Registrar, and as Dean of
Students.
The man is H. Donald Winbigler, Academic Secretary
to the University.
The Academic Secretary, in charge of distributing
official documents and resolutions to the Academic
Council and Faculty Senate, is perhaps one of the busiest
and most uncelebrated men behind-the-scenes in the
University administration.
Keeps Records
Winbigler keeps all faculty committee records. He
works as "an administrative dean, an academic
administrator," organizing and filing thousands of
important University documents. Since he began as
Academic Secretary in 1967, Winbigler has sent more than
5000 different documents to faculty, administration, and
staff members.
The Secretary's duties also include presiding over the
bi-weekly meetings of the Faculty Senate as
parlimentarian and keeping the minutes of all Faculty
Senate, Academic Council, and Senate Steering committee
meetings.
Winbigler began his career in education over 40 years
ago as an instructor in speech and director of the college
theater at Monmouth College in Illinois, his alma mater.
He completed his masters and Ph.D. work at the
University of lowa, where by 1940, he had advanced from
research assistant in dramatic art to Head of Speech in the
university's experimental school.
Speech Prof
That year he and his wife moved west. Winbigler
accepted a position as Asst. Prof, of Speech, Drama, and
Education here at Stanford, and in three years he became

an associate professor. In 1949 he was made a full
professor.
As a part-time duty, Winbigler became Assistant
Registrar in 1942 to "lend a hand." During the year he
held that post, Winbigler worked in the position now
established as the Director of the Career Planning and
Placement Center.
In 1943 he became Associate Registrar and devoted
more of his time to administrative work, holding the
position now called Dean of Admissions. Two years later,
he was appointed Registrar.
"I never intended to get away from teaching,"
Winbigler remarked about his administrative roles.
"At first, I was working 25 percent of the time in the
Registrar's office and teaching 75 percent of the time.
Next, my time was evenly divided, 50-50. Then I was
teaching only 25 percent of the time. Finally I had to
quit teaching altogether."
Dean of Students
The year 1950 saw Winbigler in a different chair, Dean
of Students. He occupied this position for 17 years until
he stepped down to assume his present role.
"In 30 years I have seen tremendous change in this
University. In 1940, Ray Lyman Wilbur was President,
and the depression of the 30s was hanging over Stanford.
But it was a much more leisurely place then, with classes
in the morning, labs in the afternoon.
"Our largest enrollment in the 40s was 4,385. That was
divided roughly one-third lower division undergraduates
(freshmen and sophomores), one-third upper division
undergraduates (juniors and seniors) and one-third
graduate students. Everything is so vastly different now,"
he observed.
More Crowded
"It's much more crowded. Enrollment has just about
tripled, and there has been no great expansion in
classroom facilities. In the remodeling of many buildings
in the quad, we lost classrooms to offices."

... Little Fame For Key Role
Commenting on the student bodies then and now,
Winbigler said, "The students haven't changed
fundamentally over the years. Their manner, dress,
custom and superficial interests have changed a bit, but in
1940 dirty jeans were the uniform. Today, those jeans are
covered with many different kinds of patches."
Curriculum Changes
Winbigler praised the changes in curriculum providing
for new "exciting and valuable" programs, but he
cautioned that the demise of the general studies
requirements has "not been satisfying in and of itself."
"Many of the changes I've seen have been a result of
expansion of faculty and the development of new
programs," such as the Human Biology curriculum.
"We didn't have as much excitement in the 40s and 50s
as we do today. But I think there is a need for more
structure in the undergraduate curriculum."
The Secretary also had praise for the contributions of
the Faculty Senate to University administration and
policy.

"I think we have a good system," he stated. "The
Senate serves as a means of dynamic communication
between the administration and the faculty.
"But, the Senate has been basically a policy-making
body. Its strength comes not from its power, but from its
influence.
Improve Faculty Morale
"Both the Senate and the faculty committee system
have added much in improving faculty morale. They have
helped us to move into a period of stress and strain
without a great deal of difficult conflict," he explained.
Asked if he might ever return to teaching, Winbigler
said, "Well, I'm one year away from retirement, so there's
not much of a possibility that I'll go back."
Although the Academic Secretary is seldom in the
University limelight, his job is nevertheless an important
function to the Faculty Senate and to the administration.
After 33 years and a myriad of roles at Stanford, H.
Donald Winbigler may not receive headlines for his work
as Academic Secretary, but his efforts cannot go
unnoticed.
