# Deception, Corruption
## That's Politics 
### 
• Chris Hocker

The only difference between
Republican political corruption
and Democratic political
corruption is that, last time
around, the Republicans got
caught.
That's hardly a profound
statement. Nearly everyone,
regardless of the depth of their
hostility toward President Nixon,
would admit in their heart of
hearts that the Democrats, given
the chance, would have behaved
no differently from the
Republican spies at the Watergate.
Calling for honesty in politics
is like calling for cleanliness in a
cesspool. Politics — the
mechanism by which people
attempt to control others —
necessitates deception. There are
degrees, of course: the politicians
whom we label "dirty" are those
who make their deception
obvious.
Doorbells, Leaflets
I was told once that 10-25
percent of every freshman class at
Stanford were former presidents
of their high school student
bodies or the equivalent. At least
the same percentage must have
run for student office and been
defeated. And, of the rest, a
relatively high proportion have
run doorbells or handed out
leaflets or in some other way
proselytized on behalf of a
candidate at some time.
So, most Stanford students
have some first-hand experience in
the political process. They know,
then, that there are very few
political acts which do not involve
a degree of deception. Even
putting a bumper sticker on your
car implies a hope that you will
influence someone's vote, not
through rational deliberation, but
through some sort of unspoken
pressure by which the undecided
voter might say, "Well, he looks
like he's a reasonable sort of
person and he's voting for
Candidate X, so maybe I will,
too."
Direct Proportion
The degree of political
dishonesty rises in direct
proportion to the stakes involved
in the election. When you ran for
the presidency of your
fourth-grade class, for example,
the most poignant moral question
you had to face was whether or
not to vote for yourself. Chances
are, you magnanimously voted for
your opponent and, when he won
by one vote, you shrugged your

shoulders and basked in your
secret martyrdom.
If you ran for high school
office, though, you took things a
bit more seriously. You probably
made an effort to be friendly with
people you really weren't all that
friendly with, and to say things in
ordinary conversation that you
usually didn't say. And you
probably made at least one speech
to the student body in which you
promised things that you knew
even then that you couldn't
deliver.
If your personal involvement
with politics lasted through
college, you probably came into
contact with a great deal of
outright cheating, fraud, and lies,
as well as the usual assortment of
innuendo and half-truths.
Stakes High
The stakes are highest, of
course, when there is money
involved, especially if it is money
taken from other people for the
purpose of not only paying you
and your friends, but for
subsidizing those programs and
implementing those policies which
must be continued in order for
you and your friends to stay in
office.
Thus, we see the incredible
spectacle recently of one
candidate for a vacant seat in the
California Assembly spending
$370,000 to get himself elected,
while his opponent spent "only"
$160,000.
C'est Un Genre
When you're dealing in that
magnitude of money, the only
wonder is that corruption of the
Watergate genre is not more
widespread than it is. And yet, as
usual, those who scream the
loudest about the Watergate are
the same people who are to be
found raising the stakes — that is,
increasing the amount of money
that government can play with
and thereby increasing the
incentive to get in office by any
means necessary.
Only by drastically reducing
the stakes — by cutting from
government whole areas of waste,
inefficiency, and pork-barrel
programs — can the incentive for
corruption be cut back. And, if
government ever gets small
enough, elective office will be
attractive only to those who
believe in a government of laws
instead of men.

secret martyrdom.
If you ran for high school
office, though, you took things a
bit more seriously. You probably
made an effort to be friendly with
people you really weren't all that
friendly with, and to say things in
ordinary conversation that you
usually didn't say. And you
probably made at least one speech
to the student body in which you
promised things that you knew
even then that you couldn't
deliver.
If your personal involvement
with politics lasted through
college, you probably came into
contact with a great deal of
outright cheating, fraud, and lies,
as well as the usual assortment of
innuendo and half-truths.
Stakes High
The stakes are highest, of
course, when there is money
involved, especially if it is money
taken from other people for the
purpose of not only paying you
and your friends, but for
subsidizing those programs and
implementing those policies which
must be continued in order for
you and your friends to stay in
office.
Thus, we see the incredible
spectacle recently of one
candidate for a vacant seat in the
California Assembly spending
$370,000 to get himself elected,
while his opponent spent "only"
$160,000.
C'est Un Genre
When you're dealing in that
magnitude of money, the only
wonder is that corruption of the
Watergate genre is not more
widespread than it is. And yet, as
usual, those who scream the
loudest about the Watergate are
the same people who are to be
found raising the stakes — that is,
increasing the amount of money
that government can play with
and thereby increasing the
incentive to get in office by any
means necessary.
Only by drastically reducing
the stakes — by cutting from
government whole areas of waste,
inefficiency, and pork-barrel
programs — can the incentive for
corruption be cut back. And, if
government ever gets small
enough, elective office will be
attractive only to those who
believe in a government of laws
instead of men.

The only difference between
Republican political corruption
and Democratic political
corruption is that, last time
around, the Republicans got
caught.
That's hardly a profound
statement. Nearly everyone,
regardless of the depth of their
hostility toward President Nixon,
would admit in their heart of
hearts that the Democrats, given
the chance, would have behaved
no differently from the
Republican spies at the Watergate.
Calling for honesty in politics
is like calling for cleanliness in a
cesspool. Politics — the
mechanism by which people
attempt to control others —
necessitates deception. There are
degrees, of course: the politicians
whom we label "dirty" are those
who make their deception
obvious.
Doorbells, Leaflets
I was told once that 10-25
percent of every freshman class at
Stanford were former presidents
of their high school student
bodies or the equivalent. At least
the same percentage must have
run for student office and been
defeated. And, of the rest, a
relatively high proportion have
run doorbells or handed out
leaflets or in some other way
proselytized on behalf of a
candidate at some time.
So, most Stanford students
have some first-hand experience in
the political process. They know,
then, that there are very few
political acts which do not involve
a degree of deception. Even
putting a bumper sticker on your
car implies a hope that you will
influence someone's vote, not
through rational deliberation, but
through some sort of unspoken
pressure by which the undecided
voter might say, "Well, he looks
like he's a reasonable sort of
person and he's voting for
Candidate X, so maybe I will,
too."
Direct Proportion
The degree of political
dishonesty rises in direct
proportion to the stakes involved
in the election. When you ran for
the presidency of your
fourth-grade class, for example,
the most poignant moral question
you had to face was whether or
not to vote for yourself. Chances
are, you magnanimously voted for
your opponent and, when he won
by one vote, you shrugged your

shoulders and basked in your
secret martyrdom.
If you ran for high school
office, though, you took things a
bit more seriously. You probably
made an effort to be friendly with
people you really weren't all that
friendly with, and to say things in
