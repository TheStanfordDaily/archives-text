# "We're Getting There"
## An Update On Tresidder Union 
### 
Gordon Starr

Tresidder often seems to
receive publicity on its problems
rather than its progress — which
perhaps is only natural, since
problems typically make for
better reading. We do have
problems — to be sure — and a lot
of them. But we're also working
hard toward improvement and
toward making Tresidder once
again an active and viable campus
center.
Due to the efforts of a lot of
people, progress has been made in
many areas. Other structural and
organizational changes have been
made to provide the basis on
which to make further progress
rapidly. I'd like to summarize
some of the changes effected to
date.
ORGANIZATION
Major changes in Tresidder's
organization have been
accomplished in order to bring
new resources to bear on solving
the problems which have
snowballed during the last four
years.
1. Tresidder's reporting
relationship changed from a
committee to the Dean of
Students Office, and a secondary
reporting relationship was
established to the Office of
Business and Finance, thereby
giving Tresidder a direct line to
University administrative
resources.
2. Major changes were made in
top management at Tresidder.
3. Tresidder divested itself of
all Faculty Club responsibilities
(which represented a substantial
drain on TMU management
resources).
4. The Campus Affairs division
was established (under Associate
Dean Dan Williams), consolidating
student activities and
organizations with Tresidder space
resources and retail activities, and
allowing for the creation of a
Tresidder programming unit.
5. The Clubhouse and
Firehouse space resources were
added to compliment the minimal
Tresidder space resources.
MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS
1. Implementation of
comprehensive management
information system, including

detailed time-phased budgeting
for thirteen discrete cost centers
(previously no budgeting of this
type existed for Tresidder at all).
2. Comprehensive revamp of
the accounting system.
3. Performance evaluations for
all employees.
4. Student pay plan, providing
for wage increases for length of
service and for merit.
5. Staff meetings and in-depth
individual management reviews,
neither of which previously
existed.
PROGRAMS
Just now in the development
stages and doing well with
minimum funding. For instance,
over 1,000 people were at
Tresidder for various programs the
Friday before last.
1. Friday night film series
combined with 25c discount at
the Coffee House (just started last
week).
2. Monthly art exhibits from
members of the Stanford
Community (no more 'travelling'
art displays — there's plenty of
talent right here).
3. Facilitated establishment of
the Student Art Coop upstairs at
TMU.
4. Christmas Crafts Faire —
brought craftsmen from all over
the Bay Area.
5. Tresidder is open on
weekends — used to be closed.
6. Minor modification in
upstairs lobby to make it more
amenable for reading, relaxation.
7. Noontime activities (the
clowns), Stanford at Marine
World, 'Infinite Images' (the
mirror display), Coffee House
entertainment, the 'beverage bust'
with the Stanford Band, TGIF
entertainment, Renaissance Faire
tickets and rides, Frosh Dance,
and so forth — more to come.
RETAIL
1. Wells Fargo Bank — began
operations in September.
2. Breakfast specials —
omelettes, big breakfasts for
decent prices.
3. Noontime, $1 specials.
4. Sunday Buffet.
5. Coffee House Renovation —
designed to increase service,
provide better control, handle

more customers — scheduled for
June.
6. New products in the drug
store — more food, ice cream,
40c on cigarettes — second cash
register to reduce lines.
7. More bowling leagues —
including a junior league.
8. Pinball machines — seven of
them and more to come.
9. Soup, natural food
sandwiches at the Coffee House.
10. Reduced labor in the
Cafeteria — new hours.
11. Advertising — so people
know what we have — never done
before.
12. Competitive purchasing.
FINANCIAL PROBLEMS
Our problem financially is not
that improvements have been
lacking; they just haven't come
fast enough. For instance, in

August, Tresidder as a whole had
an annualized deficit of $322,000;
in February it had improved by
17 percent. Food Services' direct
losses show a 30 percent
improvement since August.
The point is this: a lot of
people here have done a lot of
good work to bring about the
changes that have been made. We
hope we're starting to generate
some positive feelings about
Tresidder, and eliminate many of
the negative ones. We realize we
have a long way to go in many
respects. But we're getting there,
and we solicit the comments and
ideas of the Stanford Community
to help us get there faster and
more effectively.

accomplished in order to bring
new resources to bear on solving
the problems which have
snowballed during the last four
years.
1. Tresidder's reporting
relationship changed from a
committee to the Dean of
Students Office, and a secondary
reporting relationship was
established to the Office of
Business and Finance, thereby
giving Tresidder a direct line to
University administrative
resources.
2. Major changes were made in
top management at Tresidder.
3. Tresidder divested itself of
all Faculty Club responsibilities
(which represented a substantial
drain on TMU management
resources).
4. The Campus Affairs division
was established (under Associate
Dean Dan Williams), consolidating
student activities and
organizations with Tresidder space
resources and retail activities, and
allowing for the creation of a
Tresidder programming unit.
5. The Clubhouse and
Firehouse space resources were
added to compliment the minimal
Tresidder space resources.
MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS
1. Implementation of
comprehensive management
information system, including

detailed time-phased budgeting
for thirteen discrete cost centers
(previously no budgeting of this
type existed for Tresidder at all).
2. Comprehensive revamp of
the accounting system.
3. Performance evaluations for
all employees.
4. Student pay plan, providing
for wage increases for length of
service and for merit.
5. Staff meetings and in-depth
individual management reviews,
neither of which previously
existed.
PROGRAMS
Just now in the development
stages and doing well with
minimum funding. For instance,
over 1,000 people were at
Tresidder for various programs the
Friday before last.
1. Friday night film series
combined with 25c discount at
the Coffee House (just started last
week).
2. Monthly art exhibits from
members of the Stanford
Community (no more 'travelling'
art displays — there's plenty of
talent right here).
3. Facilitated establishment of
the Student Art Coop upstairs at
TMU.
4. Christmas Crafts Faire —
brought craftsmen from all over
the Bay Area.
5. Tresidder is open on
weekends — used to be closed.
6. Minor modification in
upstairs lobby to make it more
amenable for reading, relaxation.
7. Noontime activities (the
clowns), Stanford at Marine
World, 'Infinite Images' (the
mirror display), Coffee House
entertainment, the 'beverage bust'
with the Stanford Band, TGIF
entertainment, Renaissance Faire
tickets and rides, Frosh Dance,
and so forth — more to come.
RETAIL
1. Wells Fargo Bank — began
operations in September.
2. Breakfast specials —
omelettes, big breakfasts for
decent prices.
3. Noontime, $1 specials.
4. Sunday Buffet.
5. Coffee House Renovation —
designed to increase service,
provide better control, handle

more customers — scheduled for
June.
6. New products in the drug
store — more food, ice cream,
40c on cigarettes — second cash
register to reduce lines.
7. More bowling leagues —
including a junior league.
8. Pinball machines — seven of
them and more to come.
9. Soup, natural food
sandwiches at the Coffee House.
10. Reduced labor in the
Cafeteria — new hours.
11. Advertising — so people
know what we have — never done
before.
12. Competitive purchasing.
FINANCIAL PROBLEMS
Our problem financially is not
that improvements have been
lacking; they just haven't come
fast enough. For instance, in

August, Tresidder as a whole had
an annualized deficit of $322,000;
in February it had improved by
17 percent. Food Services' direct
losses show a 30 percent
improvement since August.
The point is this: a lot of
people here have done a lot of
good work to bring about the
changes that have been made. We
hope we're starting to generate
some positive feelings about
Tresidder, and eliminate many of
the negative ones. We realize we
have a long way to go in many
respects. But we're getting there,
and we solicit the comments and
ideas of the Stanford Community
to help us get there faster and
more effectively.

Tresidder often seems to
receive publicity on its problems
rather than its progress — which
perhaps is only natural, since
problems typically make for
better reading. We do have
problems — to be sure — and a lot
of them. But we're also working
hard toward improvement and
toward making Tresidder once
again an active and viable campus
center.
Due to the efforts of a lot of
people, progress has been made in
many areas. Other structural and
organizational changes have been
made to provide the basis on
which to make further progress
rapidly. I'd like to summarize
some of the changes effected to
date.

resources and retail activities, and
allowing for the creation of a
Tresidder programming unit.
5. The Clubhouse and
Firehouse space resources were
added to compliment the minimal
Tresidder space resources.
MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS
1. Implementation of
comprehensive management
information system, including

detailed time-phased budgeting
for thirteen discrete cost centers
(previously no budgeting of this
type existed for Tresidder at all).
2. Comprehensive revamp of
the accounting system.
3. Performance evaluations for
all employees.
4. Student pay plan, providing
for wage increases for length of
service and for merit.
5. Staff meetings and in-depth
individual management reviews,
neither of which previously
existed.
PROGRAMS
Just now in the development
stages and doing well with
minimum funding. For instance,
over 1,000 people were at
Tresidder for various programs the
Friday before last.
1. Friday night film series
combined with 25c discount at
the Coffee House (just started last
week).
2. Monthly art exhibits from
members of the Stanford
Community (no more 'travelling'
art displays — there's plenty of
talent right here).
3. Facilitated establishment of
the Student Art Coop upstairs at
TMU.
4. Christmas Crafts Faire —
brought craftsmen from all over
the Bay Area.
5. Tresidder is open on
weekends — used to be closed.
6. Minor modification in
upstairs lobby to make it more
amenable for reading, relaxation.
7. Noontime activities (the
clowns), Stanford at Marine
World, 'Infinite Images' (the
mirror display), Coffee House
entertainment, the 'beverage bust'
with the Stanford Band, TGIF
entertainment, Renaissance Faire
tickets and rides, Frosh Dance,
and so forth — more to come.
RETAIL
1. Wells Fargo Bank — began
operations in September.
2. Breakfast specials —
omelettes, big breakfasts for
decent prices.
3. Noontime, $1 specials.
4. Sunday Buffet.
5. Coffee House Renovation —
designed to increase service,
provide better control, handle

more customers — scheduled for
June.
6. New products in the drug
store — more food, ice cream,
40c on cigarettes — second cash
register to reduce lines.
7. More bowling leagues —
including a junior league.
8. Pinball machines — seven of
them and more to come.
9. Soup, natural food
sandwiches at the Coffee House.
10. Reduced labor in the
Cafeteria — new hours.
11. Advertising — so people
know what we have — never done
before.
12. Competitive purchasing.
FINANCIAL PROBLEMS
Our problem financially is not
that improvements have been
lacking; they just haven't come
fast enough. For instance, in

August, Tresidder as a whole had
an annualized deficit of $322,000;
in February it had improved by
17 percent. Food Services' direct
losses show a 30 percent
improvement since August.
The point is this: a lot of
people here have done a lot of
good work to bring about the
changes that have been made. We
hope we're starting to generate
some positive feelings about
Tresidder, and eliminate many of
the negative ones. We realize we
have a long way to go in many
respects. But we're getting there,
and we solicit the comments and
ideas of the Stanford Community
to help us get there faster and
more effectively.

Tresidder often seems to
receive publicity on its problems
rather than its progress — which
perhaps is only natural, since
problems typically make for
better reading. We do have
problems — to be sure — and a lot
of them. But we're also working
hard toward improvement and
toward making Tresidder once
again an active and viable campus
center.
Due to the efforts of a lot of
people, progress has been made in
many areas. Other structural and
organizational changes have been
made to provide the basis on
which to make further progress
rapidly. I'd like to summarize
some of the changes effected to
date.
ORGANIZATION
Major changes in Tresidder's
organization have been
accomplished in order to bring
new resources to bear on solving
the problems which have
snowballed during the last four
years.
1. Tresidder's reporting
relationship changed from a
committee to the Dean of
Students Office, and a secondary
reporting relationship was
established to the Office of
Business and Finance, thereby
giving Tresidder a direct line to
University administrative
resources.
2. Major changes were made in
top management at Tresidder.
3. Tresidder divested itself of
all Faculty Club responsibilities
(which represented a substantial
drain on TMU management
resources).
4. The Campus Affairs division
was established (under Associate
Dean Dan Williams), consolidating
student activities and
organizations with Tresidder space
resources and retail activities, and
allowing for the creation of a
Tresidder programming unit.
5. The Clubhouse and
Firehouse space resources were
added to compliment the minimal
Tresidder space resources.
