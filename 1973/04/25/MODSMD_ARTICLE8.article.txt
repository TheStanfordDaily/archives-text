# Historical Precedent
## No Hanoi Aid 
### 
John R. Rarick

Those Americans old enough to remember the
days following World War 11, find it difficult to
understand the President's avowed commitment to
rebuild North Vietnam. The analogy often used by
the pro-aid lobby is that Germany and Japan were
reconstructed with U.S. assistance and money. This
comparison is a weak attempt to rewrite that period
of history.
Contrasts between the two wars are clear and
unmistakable. The Second World War was declared,
with our fighting men ordered to win the conflict
by unconditional surrender of the enemy. Their
territory was invaded and occupied. The political
regimes that waged the war were overthrown. Not
only were the governments ousted, but the
responsible political and military leaders were
arrested, tried and convicted as war criminals.
North Vietnam, in contrast, suffered no defeat
and never surrendered. The Communist warlords

and political strategists who waged the war, killed
46,000 Americans, wounded and maimed hundreds
of thousands more, remain in complete control. The
North Vietnamese goal of domination of all
Indochina remains, despite the shaky ceasefire.
The reason most often given at the time for
rebuilding Germany and Japan was that after
destroying their countries and removing their
leaders, if the U.S. did not step in to fill the
leadership void, both countries would suffer a
Communist take-over. The bitter hatred of war did
not dim our national compassion to save these
people from exploitation by the Communists. Aid
to North Vietnam will not accomplish this, but only
use our tax dollars to further subsidize Communism.
We never rebuilt or sent aid to the Communist
apparatus of North Korea â€” this is the historic
precedent we should follow now.
