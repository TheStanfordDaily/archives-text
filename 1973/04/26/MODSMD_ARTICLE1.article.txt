# Midterms Evoke Frequent Disregard For Honor Code
## 
### JOAN HINMAN 
"HONORABLE CONDUCT in
academic work is the spirit of conduct
in this University."
With midterms approaching,
students will once again be faced with
the Honor Code statement printed on
the cover of each official examination
blue book. For some, the Honor Code
represents what one freshman male
describes as, "just another blank to fill
in."
While there is no evidence to
support a claim that cheating has
increased in recent years, there have
been more spectacular examples.
During Autumn quarter, bomb threats
were phoned in which cleared
examination rooms where midterms
for Biology 21 and Organic Chemistry
were being held. Students reportedly
gathered in groups and collaborated on
answers to exam questions.
In the case of the Biology 21 exam,
Professor Phil Hanawalt received six
reports that cheating had occurred,
and some students requested that the

results of the test be invalidated.
Hanawalt wrote a letter to the Daily in
which he requested that those who
had cheated drop the course.
"It was a rhetorical request
perhaps," states Hanawalt in
explaining that to his knowledge no
students admitted cheating or dropped
out of the course. If Hanawalt had
known the identities of the students
involved, he would have reported them
through proper University channels.
Violation Procedure
In cases of cheating, the alleged
violation is reported first to the
President's Office through Gerald M.
Halligan, assistant staff counsel to the
president. The President's Office
brings the case to the Campus Judicial
Panel; it is the University, and not the
individual instructor, which has the
authority to prosecute Honor Code
violations.
If a student desires, he may request
a hearing before Dean of Student
Affairs James Lyons. The dean has the
right to refuse such a hearing, in which

case the student's case is heard before
the CJP. Lyons will hear only
uncontested cases.
According to CJP Chairman William
Cohen, the number of Honor Code
cases tried by the CJP may be, "the tip
of an iceburg. Our case load just isn't
representative of what's going on."
Only five cases have been brought to
University officials since September.
There is little doubt that most
cheating goes either undetected or
unreported, and this may be the major
failing of the honor system. Cohen
notes a "real reluctance not only on
the part of students, but on the part of
professors as well," to turn in
suspected cheaters.
Informants
Although it is a stipulation of the
Honor Code that students report any
cheating which they observe, there
seems to be no inclination among
students to report each other. "I'd
never turn anyone in," commented
one sophomore. "I'd never cheat, but
I'd never turn anyone in."

Most students are reported by
clever teaching assistants according to
Halligan. "English TAs are good at
picking things up. They're just so
widely read that they notice these
obscure little things that no one else
would ever notice."
Halligan said that probably only the
most blatant cheating is ever
discovered. "It's usually common
errors in problems or something like
seven solid pages of plagiarism that
gets someone caught."
Few Charges
However, it seems that most TAs
are reluctant to formally charge a
student with cheating. According to
qne graduate TA in Computer Science,
"I don't believe in the Honor Code
because it forces people to turn other
people in. I wouldn't trust the CJP
after the punishment they gave in the
meal ticket case. It's just too severe."
An undergraduate TA in Human
Biology states that she would talk to a
suspected cheater personally. "I'm still

mainly a student myself," she added
sympathetically.
Threat to Honor Code
Lyons sees the tendency of
professors and TAs to deal with
students personally as a threat to the
Honor Code. Rather than being dealt
with by individuals, Lyons feels
violations should be, "of institutional
concern."
Lyons feels that the Honor Code
should be constantly reaffirmed in the
minds of students, faculty, and
administration. Although he feels that
signing a blue book cover may make a
student reflect briefly, Lyons feels
that a concentrated effort to explain
to freshmen the importance of the
Honor Code is essential.
"In high school," comments Lyons,
"there's no question. It's okay to tell a
white lie. We know it's okay to
cheat..." During recent years
Stanford has enrolled more first
generation college students than ever
before. How many of those students
know what plagiarism is when they get
here? I suspect that most of the
professors assume they know, but do
they really?
"One person's plagiarism is another
person's forgotten footnote."
Little Cheating
Lyons believes there is no solid
evidence for the widely held belief

that most cheating occurs in
pre-medical courses. Of cases reported
this year, none were in pre-medical
courses; the Biology 21 and Organic
Chemistry cases were never formally
reported. However, along with
Halligan and Cohen, Lyons suspects
that the tendency to cheat might be
higher among pre-meds.
"You aren't talking about honesty
or dishonesty, you're talking about the
consequences of failure. When failure
now determines how well you're going
to be doing 20 years from now, or
even if you only think it does, you're
going to cheat."
In reference to the recent CJP
decision which set one quarter
suspension as a standard penalty for
future Honor Code violations,Halligan
speculated on what effect it would
have on the number of students turned
in.
Suspensions
"The professors may not want to
turn people in if they know they'll be
suspended. Professors may have a
greater tendency to deal with the case
themselves. On the other hand the
professors may turn in more students
because they now know that positive
action will be taken.
"I suspect we'll find out after
midterms."
