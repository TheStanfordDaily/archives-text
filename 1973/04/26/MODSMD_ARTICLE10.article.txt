# 'Nothing Ventured, Nothing Changed'
## Reflections From A Red Tile Roof 
### 
Tim Toomay

Why bother? Kilroy did. James
Joyce did. Presumptions yield
presumptions, but nothing
ventured nothing changed.
Anyway, in the beginning it was
yellow walls, concrete, heavy
doors, bookcases on either side,
two beds and a stranger. No
choice but to dive in; submerge in
the new spirit of independence. A
new person emerges from the
protections of family life, throws
himself into a mass of other new
people. Nobody cares or asks
what anyone else is doing, just do
it and compare levels. Some of us
felt strange, others felt relieved.
All were standing around, faces lit
by the glow of American dreams,
examining the prospects . . .
Come to Science and
Technology: "Ladies and

gentlemen, witness the
shimmering accuracy of the
Golden Rule. Rest easy knowing
the sun never sets on the
International Bureau of
Standards .. ." Or find yourself in
the Liberal Arts: "Well, here we
are, immersed in subjective
reality. Now class, as you learn to
love me, I want you to think
about the feelings and power
imbedded in this work of art and
weave a tapestry of ideas thick
and lush and let it be your cover
when you sleep." Sounds inviting.
Rest easy, learn to sleep well,
maybe even all the time.
So it is we fall into the great
mixing pot. All the brightest lights
in the bulb industry turning on
and burning out. Back at the
house the frat boys have all the

fags, geeks, niggers and whores
spotted. Down the row
communication with the dolls is
strictly by rumor. Outside the
Union space cadets rub elbows
with business men, diffusing
together. "Hey man, you tried
this stuff yet? Hey now, theres a
whole other thing here everyone
should know about."
'Jesus Is Here'
You get the away from home
stoned wasted problem set blues,
you visit your acquaintance from
the other side, he sets you up for
a night in God's lap and after that
you're on your own. The worthy
cats cut off a piece of the robe
and keep it for themselves, shine
it on. Some wonder if its OK.
Others take it seriously: "Have
you heard the word? Jesus is here.

Get in with the in crowd, its the
only way to fly." A few take it
too seriously. Like those peace
freaks fighting over the best way
to stir up the trash can. It was fun
while it lasted. Spring nights filled
with the roar of crowds moving
against one another. "Break it
down to build it up!"
Yeah, right. A little temper
tantrum, maybe you got a bloody
head to look at in the mirror.
Sure, let the folks back home
know you're a sunshine patriot.
You'll fight for what's right with
all your might, as long as your
brothers and sisters do it too, as
long as the sun shines it's
warm, as long as it's just spare time
you waste. But it's all right.
Nobody gets far anyway. Even the
other side of the world is within
phoning distance.
Meanwhile, back on the farm,
life as usual is waiting its turn.
Some people are on the track with
no switches in sight. Some people
don't have a direction at all. If
you don't know you don't say. Or
else you ask around, maybe, for a
little advice.
Hangup
"Speaking of advice, son, is it
the same old sex hangup? I've
been advising you kids for years,
heh heh, gotta be the old sex
hangup." Uh, no, its not the same
old sex hangup. Its the first sex
hangup I've ever had. How far do
you have to run to leave these
doupts behind?
Broken marriages, rape, a visit
with the law, quiet re-evaluation
(gotta stay with it), and at last the
kid makes it. Finds out he's not
only potent, he's a mother loving
stud. At least that's what she says,
and that's enough, right? See, she
knows Venus, knows her well.
You can see her in her eyes. But
Venus keeps pretty much to her
self, walking solo, avoiding the
paws of crawling desperados.
Lonely? Seek the less sought
after. They know what you mean.
Try the chubby ones, they'll let
you in. They know loneliness. Let
me speak from experience when I
tell you. They feed on loneliness
and they eat more than they need.
And to you with the bitter taste
in your mouth and the tear inside,
I give thanks. Thanks for the
offer, thanks for the ride.
Glories Faded
But let us not abide in the
ruins of faded glories. Life goes
on. Yes, of course. Automatic,
right? Right. But never the less,
the question remains. It's like the
tail end of a fortune cooky. You
eat the sweet and there's a prize
inside. But it doesn't say which
way is up. It only points at you
and asks: "What's behind all this
well kept landscape and theme
architecture?"
Don't ask me, I only just got
here. Don't ask me, I'm just the
gardener. Don't ask me, I'm just
the R.A. Don't ask me, I'm just a
professor with increasing
seniority. Don't ask me, I'm just a
basket weaving major. Don't ask
me, I'm just studying nuts and
bolts. Don't ask me, I'm just
passing through, how about you?
