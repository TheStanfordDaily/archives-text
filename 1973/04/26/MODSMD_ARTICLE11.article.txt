# President Against Congress
## Financial Aid Battle In House 
### 
Paul N. McCloskey

Congress has finally won a
round in the continuing and
sometimes bitter confrontation
between Congress and the
President. The occasion was last
week's vote on the funding of
federal programs for financial
assistance to college students.
For some reason, in flat
violation of a law passed less than
10 months ago, President Nixon
tried to terminate two of three
existing student aid programs, the
Economic Opportunity Grant
(EOC) and the National Defense
Student Loan (NDSL) programs,
by merely deleting funds for these
programs from next year's budget.

The President proposed to spend
the money saved in a new
program authorized by Congress
last year — the Basic Opportunity
Grant (BOC) program — despite
the fact that the law creating such
program required continuing
funding at last year's levels for the
old programs, with only excess
monies applied to get the new
program under way.
The President's proposal threw
the nation's colleges into
confusion, since no college or
university could advise applicants
what they might expect in
funding assistance next fall, or
from whom, and no student could
know whether or not there would

be funds available to him or her
after July 1, 1973. At colleges
such as San Jose State and CSM, a
substantial percentage of the
student body was affected.
Require President
By an overwhelming voice vote
on April 12, the House agreed to
require the President to fund the
three existing programs at their
1972 level for another year. The
figures are $270 million for
National Defense Student Loans,
$210 million for Educational
Opportunity Grants, and $270
million for the Work-Study
program. An additional $122
million was approved to initiate
the Basic Opportunity Grant
program. The total figure, $872
million, is the same figure
proposed by the President's
budget and represents an increase
of nearly $100 million over last
year.
The vote on final passage of
the bill was 367 to 0, and similar
Senate action is expected in the
near future. This is one issue on
which a presidential veto would
undoubtedly be overriden, since
the matter is not only of how
much money is involved, but in
the determination of how it will
be spent.
The arrogance of the
President's proposal, in direct
contravention of a law he himself
signed only a few months ago, is
hard to understand, but perhaps
no more so than that of Attorney
General Kleindienst on executive
privilege or the new OEO
director's original position that he
was free to dismantle OEO and to
terminate the legal service
program for the poor.
Money Involved
1973 is beginning to stack up
as a year of head-to-head
confrontations, of which the
student assistance vote was the
first where a matter of principle
rather than money was involved.
The President should win on most
budget-cutting items, but where
principle is involved, it appears
that Congress is finally getting its
collective back up.
The issues of authority to
bomb in Cambodia and the right
of Congress to get the truth from
the Administration are now the
crucial questions. If Congress can
now move to end the bombing
and also end the expanded
concept of executive privilege
advanced by Mr. Kleindienst, we
may yet demonstrate that the
Constitution of 183 years
duration is still alive and well.
