# Police Question Ordinance
## Berkeley Law 'Protects' Pot Users 
### Associated Press 
BERKELEY, Calif. - The long
arm of the law won't reach
marijuana users in this university
community if a new city
ordinance is enforced — the first
such measure passed in the nation.
The marijuana measure, passed
in a 28,116-to-18,032 municipal
vote, orders police to give the
lowest priority to enforcing "laws
against possession, use and
cultivation" of the euphoric weed.
Local law officers must obtain
permission from the city council
before making any such arrests.
"It doesn't mean anything,"
Berkeley Police Inspector Earl
Bergfeld said last Wednesday.
"The voters can't nullify a state
law just by saying they don't want
it enforced in Berkeley."
The group which sponsored the
move to halt pot arrests raised
funds by selling chances for a kilo
of "guess what." The winner was
announced by number only at a
rally last Monday on the
University of California campus
here. The prize was to be
delivered after last Tuesday's city
election.

"I've always been a little
paranoid about smoking dope in
Berkeley," a 22-year-old male
comparative literature student
said. "Now I feel I can smoke it
socially without any fear of
arrest."
Janet Teel, 24, a nonstudent,
said: "I've been busted and so I've
been extra careful. I've never put
myself in a situation where I
could be raided. I might now put
myself in such a situation.
"But no matter what
happens," she added, "I'm not
going to do anything stupid."
In San Francisco, a 19-year-old
dance student said she did not
think passage of the marijuana
measure would cause a migration
of pot puffers to the hills of
Berkeley.
'Flocking Over'
"I wouldn't bother to go clear
over to Berkeley to smoke," said
Susan Dean. "I don't see people
flocking over there because I
don't see any problem about
smoking in San Francisco."
Berkeley Deputy City
Attorney Michael Lawson said the
ordinance would have no

immediate effect.
"As it presently has been
adopted, nothing will happen
immediately," Lawson said.
'Establishes Priorities'
"The ordinance simply
establishes priorities. The question
is whether a policeman can be
directed not to arrest for
marijuana offenses.
"Berkeley has not been moving
very heavily for the last year or
two in the area of marijuana

offenses," he added. "I don't see
any immediate problems."
Lawson said the city attorney's
office was conferring with county
officials, the police chief and
other officials about how to
handle the pot measure.
'Marijuana Arrests'
"Our priority for marijuana
arrests for use and possession have
always been pretty low," said Lt.
Jim Polk of the Berkeley police.

"We go out for people selling it or
growing it to sell."
Inspector Randy Berry, in
charge of the narcotics detail,
agreed with Polk that the police
have been focusing on pushers and
not users in recent years.
However, he said, the marijuana
measure "will restrict us if we
were to abide by it." He added
that policemen are still under oath
to uphold state law.

such measure passed in the nation.
The marijuana measure, passed
in a 28,116-to-18,032 municipal
vote, orders police to give the
lowest priority to enforcing "laws
against possession, use and
cultivation" of the euphoric weed.
Local law officers must obtain
permission from the city council
before making any such arrests.
"It doesn't mean anything,"
Berkeley Police Inspector Earl
Bergfeld said last Wednesday.
"The voters can't nullify a state
law just by saying they don't want
it enforced in Berkeley."
The group which sponsored the
move to halt pot arrests raised
funds by selling chances for a kilo
of "guess what." The winner was
announced by number only at a
rally last Monday on the
University of California campus
here. The prize was to be
delivered after last Tuesday's city
election.

"I've always been a little
paranoid about smoking dope in
Berkeley," a 22-year-old male
comparative literature student
said. "Now I feel I can smoke it
socially without any fear of
arrest."
Janet Teel, 24, a nonstudent,
said: "I've been busted and so I've
been extra careful. I've never put
myself in a situation where I
could be raided. I might now put
myself in such a situation.
"But no matter what
happens," she added, "I'm not
going to do anything stupid."
In San Francisco, a 19-year-old
dance student said she did not
think passage of the marijuana
measure would cause a migration
of pot puffers to the hills of
Berkeley.
'Flocking Over'
"I wouldn't bother to go clear
over to Berkeley to smoke," said
Susan Dean. "I don't see people
flocking over there because I
don't see any problem about
smoking in San Francisco."
Berkeley Deputy City
Attorney Michael Lawson said the
ordinance would have no

immediate effect.
"As it presently has been
adopted, nothing will happen
immediately," Lawson said.
'Establishes Priorities'
"The ordinance simply
establishes priorities. The question
is whether a policeman can be
directed not to arrest for
marijuana offenses.
"Berkeley has not been moving
very heavily for the last year or
two in the area of marijuana

offenses," he added. "I don't see
any immediate problems."
Lawson said the city attorney's
office was conferring with county
officials, the police chief and
other officials about how to
handle the pot measure.
'Marijuana Arrests'
"Our priority for marijuana
arrests for use and possession have
always been pretty low," said Lt.
Jim Polk of the Berkeley police.

"We go out for people selling it or
growing it to sell."
Inspector Randy Berry, in
charge of the narcotics detail,
agreed with Polk that the police
have been focusing on pushers and
not users in recent years.
However, he said, the marijuana
measure "will restrict us if we
were to abide by it." He added
that policemen are still under oath
to uphold state law.
