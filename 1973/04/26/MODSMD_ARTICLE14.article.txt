A second area television repair shop owner has been arrested and
charged with two counts of petty theft for allegedly installing
unnecessary parts in television sets he repaired failing to give written
estimates and exceeding an oral estimate.
Joe R. Hernandez, owner of Aero TV, in San Jose, was arrested
earlier this month as the result of an investigation conducted by the
State Department of Consumer Affairs Bureau of Repair Services, and
was scheduled to be arraigned in San Jose yesterday. State owned sets
were run through Hernandez's shop after numerous complaints were
received by the Bureau.
Donald Peacock, chief of the Bureau, said that his office will be
watching Santa Clara Valley repair shops very closely as a result of an
"excessively large number of consumer complaints" received from this
area.
Bureau regulations require a service dealer to furnish the consumer
with a claim receipt listing the dealer's address, and the type of set
being serviced, and a written estimate (if requested) for cost of
repairs. The dealer may not charge in excess of the estimate without
previous consent of the consumer.
The dealer is further required by law to furnish the consumer with
a repair invoice listing the replaced parts and giving an adequate
description for labor charges and services performed. Replaced parts
must be returned to the consumer with the exception of warranty
parts, picture tubes or exchange items.
Complaints against any local TV repair dealer should be phoned in
to the bureau's local office at (408) 277-1251, or mailed to the
Bureau of Repair Services, 1021 "O" St., Sacramento, Ca. 95814.

Recently, a consumer telephoned the State Department of
Consumer Affairs to ask how she could cancel a contract she had
signed the day before to buy a mobile home. She had signed the
contract after a high pressure sales pitch, thinking she had three days
to cancel. Unfortunately she had to be referred to an attorney,
because the three day "cooling-off" period for contracts in California,
effective since March 1972, applies only to home solicitation
contracts of over $50.
Briefly the law states:
1. The buyer has the right to cancel a home solicitation contract or
offer, until midnight of the third calendar day — excluding Sunday —
after the day on which he signs an agreement or offer to purchase.
2. Cancellation occurs when the buyer gives written notice of
cancellation to the seller at the address specified in the agreement.
3. Notice of cancellation, if given by mail, is effective when
deposited in the mail, properly addressed and with postage paid.
4. If you cancel and you have already ade some payment to the
seller, the seller is entitled to retain five percent of the cash price, but
in no event may he retain more than $15.
5. If you cancel, the seller must return to you any payment made,
less cancellation fee, and any goods or other property, in substantially
as good condition as when received, or a sum equal to the amount of
the trade-in allowance, and any other note or other evidence of
indebtedness.
6. After cancellation the seller is entitled to receive back from you
— at your address — any goods delivered by him to you, providing he
has returned any payment and goods or other property received from
you. If the seller does not call for his goods at your address within 20
days after you give notice of cancellation, you may keep them as your
own.
7. These provisions do not apply to a contract which is executed in
connection with emergency repairs or services that are necessary for
the immediate protection of persons or real or personal property. Also
excluded are contracts coverd by the Federal Consumer Credit
Protection Act (basically home improvement contracts).
