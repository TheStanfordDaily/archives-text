# Major State Gas Firms Expect Fuel Crisis' End
## 
### Associated Press 
LOS ANGELES - Major
California gasoline companies say
they expect to weather the fuel
crisis gripping the nation, but
some smaller producers and
refiners complain of feeling the
pinch of short gasoline supplies.
"We have every expectation of
taking care of our customers'
normal requirements," said a
spokesman for Standard Oil Co.
of California.
"The situation is pretty bleak,"
commented an official of Beacon
Oil Co., an independent refinery
in Hanford.
The situation nationally has
been blamed on a variety of
factors, including lack of new
domestic sources of crude oil,
import quotas, a shortage of
refineriews and the fact that
refineries were required to
concentrate on winter heating oils
rather than gasoline.
The big companies concede
that their supplies are tight but
say they don't look forward to
outright shortages and rationing
during the peak driving season this
summer, but a number of small
companies say they already are in
a serious bind.
California Standard said "there
could be times this summer when
some stations will be out of gas
temporarily."
Texaco said its inventories are
lower now than a year ago and
that spot shortages could be
expected in the summer. The
company announced last month
that as distributor agreements
expire, renewal agreements will
provide for a maximum supply,
usually equal to the amount sold
in 1972.
Atlantic Richfield said it
expected to be able to meet all of
its obligations to existing and
committed business, and that it
was not considering a rationing
program.
Shell Oil Co. said in San
Francisco that the supply

situation is not as tight on the
West Coast as it is in the East but
it may become tighter in 1974.
"We don't anticipate any
allocation to our customers in this
area this summer," it said.
"Demand has been increasing
from 5 to 7 percent a year and
our refinery capacity peaked out
last year on the East Coast, but*
we still have a little leeway on the
West Coast." Shell's West Coast
refineries are at Martinez and
Wilmington, Calif., and Anacortes,
Wash.
A spokesman for Phillips
Petroleum in Sacramento said
"It's possible we may be short in
limited areas for a limited time
due to increases in demand, such
as the past weekend. But we don't
anticipate any broad shortage. It's
tight and it's going to remain
tight. I think the energy crisis is
probably with us."
The Beacon spokesman said
that company's production was
close to 20 percent below a year
ago because of a shortage of crude
oil and was likely to go lower as
the year goes on. "We are really
being squeezed and we are having
to curtail and allocate," he added.
American Oil Co., a division of
Standard Oil Co. of Indiana, said
its service stations in California,
New Mexico, Texas, Arizona and
Nevada are being put up for sale
because of the gasoline shortage.
The number of stations was not
disclosed.
A district office already has
been closed in California and a
bulk plant in Mesa, Ariz., is
scheduled to close June 1, an
American Oil spokesman said.
In the Sacramento area,
independent and cut-rate suppliers
are beginning to feel the squeeze
because they sell the surplus
gasoline of the major producers.
An official of Short Stop, a
food-gasoline chain with 84 stores
in Northern California said,
"We're having trouble getting
supplies but we haven't run out

yet. We're hearing more about a
shortage than experiencing one."
An independent gasoline
wholesaler serving 90 stations in
Northern California and Nevada
saiD "the pinch is under way." He
added, "I anticipate that through
the year we may experience some
shortages."
The City of San Francisco has
just signed a contract with Union
Oil Co. for about 300,000 barrels
of gasoline for city vehicles to run
through Feb. 28, 1974. The city is
paying 22.6 cents a gallon, up 4.2
cents from last year. The
purchasing department said there
were only two bidders this year,
compared with five last year.
"It's likely that governmental
agencies will not enjoy the
tremendous price advantages they
have in the past," said an oil
industry source.
