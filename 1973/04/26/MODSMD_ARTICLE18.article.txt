# 'Soylent Green':
## Dismal Projection Of Future 
### ROBERT SHERWOOD 
"Soylent Green" presents a devastingly
stark projection of the future of American
society. Set in New York City in the year
2022, the film depicts a bleak world that has
overpopulated and overpolluted itself. Half of
New York's 40 million people have no work
and subsist on the scarce supply of synthetic
"soylent" food derived from plankton. They
live in overcrowded tenements, makeshift
shelters and junked cars.
Charlton Heston stars as detective Thorn
who is trying to solve the murder of a rich
Soylent Corporation executive. He works in
conjunction with his "book" or researcher,
played by Edward G. Robinson in his final
screen role.
Thorn's first activity in the case is to pilfer
the rich man's apartment of a bar of soap, a
bottle of Bourbon, a head of lettuce and two
apples. He sneaks these highly scarce and
precious items back into his dingy two-room
flat.
The few plush apartments left are supplied
with "furniture," a permanent resident
mistress. The executive's "furniture," played
by Leigh Taylor-Young, offers Thorn some
clues which lead him to suspect assassination.
Although he is dismissed from the case, Thorn
continues his probe at the possible cost of his
job. At the film's climax he discovers a bitter
truth the Soylent Company has kept a
well-guarded secret.
Given special access to the last remaining

library in New York City, Thorn's "book,"
Sol Roth, discovers the secret himself. No
longer wishing to live, he leaves Thorn a note
that he is "going home." Roth makes his way
to a euthanasia center where he queues up
with countless others.
In a poignant scene he is led into a room
which is programmed to make his death as
comforting as possible. Rare preserved films
of nature are projected before his incredulous
eyes, which widen as if he were viewing
heaven itself.
"Soylent Green" is a drama of survival in a
world where man has destroyed his own
environment. When hungry mobs threaten to
riot, they are scooped up into riot-prevention
trucks like garbage. A job is considered an
exclusive privilege and death is the only sure
profit as each corpse is worth $50 to the next
of kin.
Stanley R. Greenberg loosely adapted the
provocative screenplay from a novel by Harry
Harrison. He recently wrote the celebrated
television special "Pueblo," and also the
successful picture "Skyjacked."
Veteran Hollywood director Richard
Fleischer directed "Soylent Green," his 32nd
film in 23 years. His recent credits include
"The Last Run,""The New Centurions," and
"Tora, Tora, Tora." He also brought
"Fantastic Voyage" and "20,000 Leagues
Under The Sea" to the screen. On the set
Fleischer worked closely with producer
Russell Thacher, who recently did 'Travels

With My Aunt."
At a cost of just under three million,
"Soylent Green" was shot in 42 days on
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's backlot sets in Culver
City, California. Much of the film takes place
indoors due to the increased complex city of
shooting outdoors. New York City street sets
and futuristic-looking buildings in the Los
Angeles area were used to provide a realistic
backdrop for the drama.
Many special effects are used to enhance
the photography of the film. The movie
begins with a ten-minute montage of still
photographs that take us from the year 1900
to 2022, as we watch the landscape become
increasingly crowded, polluted and filled with
junk. A smoggy-greenish haze is apparent in
all the exterior shots in the film, done with a
smoke overlay that has been toned green.
Excellent use of laboratory matte
projections creates realistic skyrise buildings
in the background of many shots. The
photo-panorama in the euthanasia room is
equally ingenious and its classical music score
dramatically counterpoints the shots of deer,
sheep, the sea, and various sunsets.
"It is impossible to do a message picture
that succeeds today," states producer Russell
Thacher, "so we had to provide a drama that
would both entertain and makes the audience
think."
"Soylent Green" is successful on both
counts and is the most important thriller to
come out of Hollywood in recent years.
