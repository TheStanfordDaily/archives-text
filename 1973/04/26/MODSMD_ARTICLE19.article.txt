# New TV Shows Prove Disappointing
## The 						'Daily' Entertainment 
### DAN KRAVETZ 
If you ever want to realize how
humble a creature you are, try
walking on Sixth Avenue in
Manhattan some afternoon. There
are no signs labeling the street as
such, for its official name is
Avenue of the Americas, a much
more appropriate title for a
thoroughfare which houses,
within the space of four blocks,
the corporate headquarters of our
three broadcast networks.
In the past month, the heads of
NBC, CBS and ABC have been
busily at work in their respective
skyscrapers, putting together the
1973-74 television season. For
better or worse, here is what we
will — and will not — watch this
fall:
For sentimental purposes, the
most significant casualty is
"Mission Impossible," last of a
nine-year trail of spy shows which
ranged in quality from 'The Man
from UNCLE" and "Get Smart"

(the best) to "Batman"
(progenitor of America's most
boring cult since Davy Crockett).
Another victim of the Grim
Reaper is "Mod Squad," whose
three young heroes now cast
doubt in the minds of Americans
that they were really police
officers.
Cynical Cops
Our law-enforcement ideals are
now embodied in not-so-young,
rugged-looking, cynical career
cops. And we shall have more of
these men: "Cojak," "Shaft,"
"Toma," "Griff" (starring Lome
Greene), and the protagonists of
"Chase" and "Police Story."
Legal fans will be treated to a
husband-wife lawyer team; the
idea is an old one, so don't be
fooled by the title, "Mr. and Ms."
And then there's 'The New
Adventures of Perry Mason"; the
stars of the old series have left this
earth with the exception of
Raymond Burr, who between

takes of "Ironside" played Pope
John XXIII in a recent special,
and Barbara Hale who was last
seen plugging a microwave oven.
There are some shows to whom
it will be a pleasure to yell "Good
riddance!" "The Doris Day
Show," a CBS staple, which KPIX
has mercifully refused to
broadcast in its own locale, is no
more. Perhaps the most welcome
departure is that of "Bridget
Loves Bernie," a program which
in one season has managed to last
longer than many Jewish-Gentile
marriages.
Paul Lynde, who tried to
return to his "Bye Bye Birdie"
character in a family show, is back
on Hollywood Squares delivering
fake ad-libs. Julie Andrews has
returned to Great Britain. Her
departure deprives Rich Little,
one of the best impressionists, of
a series spot.
Void Filled
To fill the comic void, we will

be given 'The Girl With
Something Extra" (No, it's ESP,
dum-dum!), "Bob and Carol and
Ted and Alice" (knowing the
censors, they probably do no
more than play mixed-doubles
tennis) and "Calucci's Dept.,"
which promises to take us inside
the offices of a state
unemployment bureau. And if
you're luck enough to watch TV
during non-network hours,
you might catch a new syndicated
comedy called "Dusty's Trail,"
starring Bob Denver in one of his
lovable half-wit roles, courtesy of
Gilligan and Maynard G. Krebs.
Finally it grieves this reporter
to note the death of "Laugh-In,"
which brings back fond memories
of high school days and yelling
slogans like "Here Come The
Judge!" and "Sock It To Me" on
crowded subway trains, scaring
hell out of the innocent.
"Laugh-In" elevated a dozen or so
people to stardom, and created a

new form of TV comedy that put
Jackie Gleason and Red Skelton
out of business, while forcing
Carol Burnett, Dean Martin and
others to change their comic
outlook from the bland to the
jolting.
"Laugh-In" lost its freshness
when it ceased to be unique, but
it was a truly great program in its
initial years. Of its original cast,
only Rowan and Martin remain,
along with Ruth Buzzi, in the
closing episodes. Will there be
another bold innovation in the
near future? It may be time for
porno-TV, but unless
"B&C&T&A" surprises us, better
wait 'til next year.

idea is an old one, so don't be
fooled by the title, "Mr. and Ms."
And then there's 'The New
Adventures of Perry Mason"; the
stars of the old series have left this
earth with the exception of
Raymond Burr, who between

takes of "Ironside" played Pope
John XXIII in a recent special,
and Barbara Hale who was last
seen plugging a microwave oven.
There are some shows to whom
it will be a pleasure to yell "Good
riddance!" "The Doris Day
Show," a CBS staple, which KPIX
has mercifully refused to
broadcast in its own locale, is no
more. Perhaps the most welcome
departure is that of "Bridget
Loves Bernie," a program which
in one season has managed to last
longer than many Jewish-Gentile
marriages.
Paul Lynde, who tried to
return to his "Bye Bye Birdie"
character in a family show, is back
on Hollywood Squares delivering
fake ad-libs. Julie Andrews has
returned to Great Britain. Her
departure deprives Rich Little,
one of the best impressionists, of
a series spot.
Void Filled
To fill the comic void, we will

be given 'The Girl With
Something Extra" (No, it's ESP,
dum-dum!), "Bob and Carol and
Ted and Alice" (knowing the
censors, they probably do no
more than play mixed-doubles
tennis) and "Calucci's Dept.,"
which promises to take us inside
the offices of a state
unemployment bureau. And if
you're luck enough to watch TV
during non-network hours,
you might catch a new syndicated
comedy called "Dusty's Trail,"
starring Bob Denver in one of his
lovable half-wit roles, courtesy of
Gilligan and Maynard G. Krebs.
Finally it grieves this reporter
to note the death of "Laugh-In,"
which brings back fond memories
of high school days and yelling
slogans like "Here Come The
Judge!" and "Sock It To Me" on
crowded subway trains, scaring
hell out of the innocent.
"Laugh-In" elevated a dozen or so
people to stardom, and created a

new form of TV comedy that put
Jackie Gleason and Red Skelton
out of business, while forcing
Carol Burnett, Dean Martin and
others to change their comic
outlook from the bland to the
jolting.
"Laugh-In" lost its freshness
when it ceased to be unique, but
it was a truly great program in its
initial years. Of its original cast,
only Rowan and Martin remain,
along with Ruth Buzzi, in the
closing episodes. Will there be
another bold innovation in the
near future? It may be time for
porno-TV, but unless
"B&C&T&A" surprises us, better
wait 'til next year.
If you ever want to realize how
humble a creature you are, try
walking on Sixth Avenue in
Manhattan some afternoon. There
are no signs labeling the street as
such, for its official name is
Avenue of the Americas, a much
more appropriate title for a
thoroughfare which houses,
within the space of four blocks,
the corporate headquarters of our
three broadcast networks.
In the past month, the heads of
NBC, CBS and ABC have been
busily at work in their respective
skyscrapers, putting together the
1973-74 television season. For
better or worse, here is what we
will — and will not — watch this
fall:
For sentimental purposes, the
most significant casualty is
"Mission Impossible," last of a
nine-year trail of spy shows which
ranged in quality from 'The Man
from UNCLE" and "Get Smart"

(the best) to "Batman"
(progenitor of America's most
boring cult since Davy Crockett).
Another victim of the Grim
Reaper is "Mod Squad," whose
three young heroes now cast
doubt in the minds of Americans
that they were really police
officers.
Cynical Cops
Our law-enforcement ideals are
now embodied in not-so-young,
rugged-looking, cynical career
cops. And we shall have more of
these men: "Cojak," "Shaft,"
"Toma," "Griff" (starring Lome
Greene), and the protagonists of
"Chase" and "Police Story."
Legal fans will be treated to a
husband-wife lawyer team; the
idea is an old one, so don't be
fooled by the title, "Mr. and Ms."
And then there's 'The New
