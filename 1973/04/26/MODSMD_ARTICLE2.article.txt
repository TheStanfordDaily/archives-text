# Fragile Peace Agreement Falters, Paris Meeting Pursues Solution
## 
### Associated Press 
WASHINGTON - The United
States and North Vietnam nave agreed
to hold new direct negotiations in
Paris beginning tomorrow on the
faltering Vietnam cease-fire agreement.
Meanwhile, in Paris, the Saigon
government and the Viet Cong quickly
rejected each other's conflicting
proposals for a final political
settlement in South Vietnam.
Initial U.S.—Hanoi sessions will be
held between Villain H. Sullivan, a
deputy assistant secretary of state, and
Nguyen Co Thach, vice minister for
foreign affairs in the Hanoi
government.
Barring unforeseen developments,
they will be followed in mid-May with
talks between Henry A. Kissinger,
national security adviser to President
Nixon, and North Vietnamese
Politburo member Le Due Tho.

The Sullivan-Thach meetings were
announced simultaneously yesterday
morning at the White House and the
North Vietnamese Embassy in Paris.
Later, Charles W. Bray, a State
Department spokesman, said the
diplomatic move was initiated by the
United States "as part of an effort to
bring the agreement as a whole back
into an effective force."
In a formal note two weeks ago,
North Vietnam accused the United
States and South Vietnam of "grave
violations" of the Jan. 27 agreement,
including military thrusts at areas in
the South under Viet Cong control.
The United States responded last
weekend with a note charging Hanoi
and "its agents" with several serious
breaches, including a clandestine
buildup of supplies and 300,000
troops in South Vietnam.
Elsewhere in Indochina, the United

States has accused Hanoi of illegally
supporting insurgents against the
governments of Cambodia and Laos,
while North Vietnam has criticized
U.S. bombing operations in the two
countries.
Ronald L. Ziegler, the White House
press secretary, said the purpose of the
Sullivan-Thach talks is "to prepare a
review of the implementation of the
Paris agreement and of appropriate
measures to bring about the strict
implementation of the agreement."
U.S. officials said, meanwhile, that
if Hanoi shows that it intends to
observe all provisions of the
agreement, the Navy will resume
minesweeping operations in North
Vietnamese waters and delegate
Maurice Williams will be sent back to
Paris to continue discussions with
North Vietnam on the economic
reconstruction of the country. Both
minesweeping and reconstruction aid
are required under the agreement.
In Paris, the Saigon government and
the Viet Cong handed each other
sharply conflicting proposals yesterday
for a final political settlement in South
Vietnam.
Each side quickly rejected the key
provisions of the other side's plan and
acknowledged failure to meet
tomorrow's deadline set by the Paris
cease-fire accord for settlement of the
political stalemate.
For the first time since the talks
opened March 19, the two sides failed

to set a date for their next meeting.
Representing the two sides are
Saigon's deputy premier, Nguyen Luu
Vien, and Minister of State Nguyen
Van Hieu of the Viet Cong.
Throughout the first seven sessions
of their political talks, Hieu and Vien
remained deadlocked on their agenda
and never even began a discussion of
substance. At yesterday's eighth
session, they bypassed the agenda
dispute and simultaneously presented
their rival plans for South Vietnam's
political future.
The 10-point plan presented by
Vien and the six-point plan presented
by Hieu in essence restated each side's
long-standing position, although there
were changes of emphasis in the two
plans indicating possible minute moves
toward compromise.
The Saigon plan for the first time
dropped the insistence that future
elections must be held within the
framework of the existing
constitution.
The Viet Cong plan for the first
time hinted that the Communist side
might be willing to discuss withdrawal
of North Vietnamese forces from
South Vietnam — but only after all
Communist conditions have been met
and elections have been held under the
auspices of a national council of
reconcilization.

North Vietnam accused the United
States and South Vietnam of "grave
violations" of the Jan. 27 agreement,
including military thrusts at areas in
the South under Viet Cong control.
The United States responded last
weekend with a note charging Hanoi
and "its agents" with several serious
breaches, including a clandestine
buildup of supplies and 300,000
troops in South Vietnam.
Elsewhere in Indochina, the United

States has accused Hanoi of illegally
supporting insurgents against the
governments of Cambodia and Laos,
while North Vietnam has criticized
U.S. bombing operations in the two
countries.
Ronald L. Ziegler, the White House
press secretary, said the purpose of the
Sullivan-Thach talks is "to prepare a
review of the implementation of the
Paris agreement and of appropriate
measures to bring about the strict
implementation of the agreement."
U.S. officials said, meanwhile, that
if Hanoi shows that it intends to
observe all provisions of the
agreement, the Navy will resume
minesweeping operations in North
Vietnamese waters and delegate
Maurice Williams will be sent back to
Paris to continue discussions with
North Vietnam on the economic
reconstruction of the country. Both
minesweeping and reconstruction aid
are required under the agreement.
In Paris, the Saigon government and
the Viet Cong handed each other
sharply conflicting proposals yesterday
for a final political settlement in South
Vietnam.
Each side quickly rejected the key
provisions of the other side's plan and
acknowledged failure to meet
tomorrow's deadline set by the Paris
cease-fire accord for settlement of the
political stalemate.
For the first time since the talks
opened March 19, the two sides failed

to set a date for their next meeting.
Representing the two sides are
Saigon's deputy premier, Nguyen Luu
Vien, and Minister of State Nguyen
Van Hieu of the Viet Cong.
Throughout the first seven sessions
of their political talks, Hieu and Vien
remained deadlocked on their agenda
and never even began a discussion of
substance. At yesterday's eighth
session, they bypassed the agenda
dispute and simultaneously presented
their rival plans for South Vietnam's
political future.
The 10-point plan presented by
Vien and the six-point plan presented
by Hieu in essence restated each side's
long-standing position, although there
were changes of emphasis in the two
plans indicating possible minute moves
toward compromise.
The Saigon plan for the first time
dropped the insistence that future
elections must be held within the
framework of the existing
constitution.
The Viet Cong plan for the first
time hinted that the Communist side
might be willing to discuss withdrawal
of North Vietnamese forces from
South Vietnam — but only after all
Communist conditions have been met
and elections have been held under the
auspices of a national council of
reconcilization.
WASHINGTON - The United
States and North Vietnam nave agreed
to hold new direct negotiations in
Paris beginning tomorrow on the
faltering Vietnam cease-fire agreement.
Meanwhile, in Paris, the Saigon
government and the Viet Cong quickly
rejected each other's conflicting
proposals for a final political

Initial U.S.—Hanoi sessions will be
held between Villain H. Sullivan, a
deputy assistant secretary of state, and
Nguyen Co Thach, vice minister for
foreign affairs in the Hanoi
government.
Barring unforeseen developments,
they will be followed in mid-May with
talks between Henry A. Kissinger,
national security adviser to President
Nixon, and North Vietnamese
Politburo member Le Due Tho.

The Sullivan-Thach meetings were
announced simultaneously yesterday
morning at the White House and the
North Vietnamese Embassy in Paris.
Later, Charles W. Bray, a State

diplomatic move was initiated by the
United States "as part of an effort to
bring the agreement as a whole back
into an effective force."
